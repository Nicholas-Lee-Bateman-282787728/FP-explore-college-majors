82602,1,0788832492,"I have not seen this film on DVD, as nearly every review I have read has advised otherwise, but I can say that to release a featureless disc of one of the most technically significant films of all time is nothing short of  travesty. I'm ignoring the fact that Disney actually removed footage from  this film, and we're not talking about the infamous laserdisc edition. Is  it possible for Criterion to get their hands on this? They did do the super  edition of ""Armageddon"", now let's see them work on a film that  actually deserves it. I don't care if it costs $60, issue a two-disc set  with commentaries (by Zemeckis and Richard Williams, the great animation  director who was completely screwed over on his labor of love, ""The  Thief and the Cobbler), an extensive documentary, every piece of  promotional material, an anamorphic transfer, a guide to all the cartoon  characters who appear, and, while we're at it, how about those three  ""Maroon Cartoons"" (Tummy Trouble, Rollercoaster Rabbit, and Trail  Mix-up) that were until recently available on video and laserdisc before  the Mouse house decided to pull them off the market. All right, I've ranted  long enough. The point is, put out an edition of this film that truly does  justice to the film itself and people will spend the necessary currency to  obtain it. May the dream of an ultimate ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit""  DVD one day become a reality!",947548800,46,1408,4.775933609958506
82603,1,0788832492,"This is one of my favorite movies ever; there's not a moment that I don't believe that toons and humans are interacting...but this version is a censored version of the film.  They cut parts without the consent of the  director, and for this reason, I beg you not to buy this version.  Wait  until they correct the bowdlerization of this masterpiece",939686400,70,348,4.655737704918033
82604,3,0788832492,"I want to give the movie 5 stars because it is one of my favorites, and I was so looking forward to this DVD coming out (it was actually a huge surprise for me when I learned that this movie was going to be released on  DVD the next day!).  I bought it the day it came out (I guess that would be  today).  On the cover of the DVD it says that the trailer from the movie is  on here.  Well, it's not.  As for the picture & sound quality, very  nice, but it would have been nicer if Touchstone had slipped in those  ""bonus scenes"" that we only got to see once on TV.If I were  behind the DVD version I would have included all the extra scenes, the  behind-the-scenes special, as well as the trailer.

82744,5,0788832492,"A film noir detective story combined with cartoon characters just shouldn't work.
But this one does.
Brilliantly.
I first saw ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" in the theater more than 30 years ago and loved it. I only recently found it on DVD and, remembering how much I enjoyed it back then, decided to purchase it. So glad I did because, despite the fact it's three decades old, it hasn't lost any of its charm. It's funny, very well acted by the humans in the film, and just as fresh in its concept as it was back in the day.
The script has all the plot elements of a classic film noir movie from the Forties: A down-at-the-heels private eye, a long-suffering girlfriend, an intriguing mystery, and a villain worthy of the name. Set in Los Angeles just after World War II, it captures the glory of Hollywood in its heyday when the studios reigned supreme and movie stars were glamorous. It has classic cartoon characters woven into the storyline: Betty Boop as a cocktail waitress, Droopy Dog running an elevator, and Donald Duck and Daffy Duck playing piano at a nightclub are just some of the many cartoon characters that make appearances in this very clever film.
Charles Fleischer, as the voice of Roger Rabbit (and a few other characters as well) is brilliant and Warner Bros. legendary voice actor Mel Blanc brings his special talents to the film as well. The late Bob Hoskins, as the slightly seedy private eye investigating the murder of a man who sells joke gadgets, is great in the role. He brings just the right touch of humor to the role without overdoing it. Christopher Lloyd as the judge of Toontown is downright scary in the role.
The blend of animation and live action is seamless, which is pretty remarkable given the age of this film. These days we've come to expect that from filmmakers but 30 years ago there were very few studios that would have attempted to do it because of the expense, the time-consuming process, and the often-less-than-stellar results. Touchstone Pictures and producer Steven Spielberg are, in my opinion, to be congratulated for taking the risk as is director Roger Zemeckis for agreeing to helm it.
In summary: A great film with memorable characters, a lot of humor, and a movie that you can watch with your kids that is worth every one of 5 stars.",1489881600,6,2290,4.6567901234567906

82746,5,0788832492,This is a good movie.

82815,5,0788832492,"Bos Hoskins is just a magnificent actor in many of his roles. He left too soon. At any rate going back through some of his catalogue, you arrive at the pop sensation that is this film from Zemeckis and Co. in an age where CGI and digital trickery was in its infancy. And dear lord does the bluray finally do it justice. Amazing. That is about all that needs to be said. A nice layer of grain accentuates a not perfect but totally great transfer to bluray. It's almost everything you wanted it to be. Furthermore, it isn't some horrid trainwreck of DNR nor was much altering of the source even considered. For a film from 1988 it could hardly look better unless given the full 4K restoration. Even then the look of the film gels with the 1940s thematic elements.

What you are stuck with here is a one of a kind film. Never before or since has Hollywood merged all kinds of different toons together with such whacky animation. And it's all surrounded by a great tale. Some doubt it will ever happen again.

What you need to know is that this film has never looked even close to this good. Pick it up immediately. If you are not a fan it's at least worth it to see where Hollywood and Zemeckis were in this era, experimenting and wallowing in zany, disastrous glee. Toons and humans will never be the same. The humor still holds up. As I said at the beginning, Hoskins gives a remarkable performance as the hard drinkin' detective Eddie Valiant. A glorious release! Fully Recommended.",1476489600,,1482,4.464944649446495

Who can forget the first time they saw Jessica Rabbit, ""What a woman!""? Each character is so well embedded in the live action it is hard to believe they are not real.  If you have never seen this gem of a movie, you have no idea what you are missing.  So, ""Eddie, PLLLLLLLLEASE!"", give it a view.

82927,5,0788832492,"Combining live action and animation had been going on for years but in this movie, it's at its best. Who Framed Roger Rabbit set a standard which has been difficult to best and I don't think it hasn't been, even today. The story, offering a Looney-Toons version of a film noir detective story is just offbeat and goofy enough to catch the imagination.  There are puns galore, both verbal and sight gags and the abundance of cartoon characters is a surfeit for the eye as well as the memory.  The more popular ones are present, such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy and Donald Duck, and Yosemite Sam.  Not merely Warner Brothers' characters but also Disney creations are represented...Mickey and Minnie, Goofy,etc., as well as some Fantasia cameos. For the oldsters in the audience, the originals...Betty Boop in all her black-and-white glory, Droopy, and Lena the Hyena. The multi-vocal talents of the late Mel Blanc and of Charles Fleischer round out an all-star animated cast.

The story is basic: a private eye is hired by Maroon Studios to follow their star attractions wife and see if she's ""playing pattycake"" with anyone. When the studio's partner is discovered to be the other player and is subsequently murdered and the star, one Mr. Rabbit, is accused of the crime, the way is open for the wildest investigation in animation history.

With a twist at the end as far as the villain goes,this is a movie for everyone...the kids will like it for the cartoon characters, the adults for the sheer absurdity that somehow manages to still make sense.

It's a delightful, wacky entertainment which, because of all the animated elements, should be viewed more than once...for the story, for the puns and gags, and for the characters themselves. Difficult to believe it was filmed 20 years ago because it still holds up today.

This movie was purchased as a DVD and no remuneration as involved in the writing of this review.",1460851200,5,1912,4.82874617737003

82993,5,0788832492,"I have one of the ol' region 1 version of the DVD and I LOVE IT!!!! This movie is amazing! It combines humour with mystery as deftly as it does live action and animation. It is BRILLIANTLY written and acted and is one of the most original and groundbreaking films Hollywood and Disney/Touchstone has ever produced. This is directed by Robert Zemeckis, one of the people behind Monster House and the recent movie Flight, but this is by far one of his best works. It's about a parallel 30's era LA, where Eddie Valiant detective who hates Toons after one killed his brother and his girlfriend, Delores, who runs the local bar, lives, as well as the beautiful and sultry toon Jessica Rabbit and her goofy husband, Roger Rabbit. After Roger has been set up for the murder of Marvin Acme, the CEO of the Acme company, Eddie, Roger, Jessica, and Delores must team up to find the real killer as well as Acme's will to save Toontown from annihilation. And maybe, just maybe, Eddie will also find his lost sence of humor along the way. This is a great film for movie lovers and animation geeks, as it is a rather historic film for both: It's one of the most ambitious animated and live action combinations, as well as getting Disney and Warner Brothers cartoons all together in one movie, which was quite an accomplishment, considering they were animation rivals.",1453939200,,1354,4.622406639004149

83181,5,0788832492,"Awesome ""cartoon mixes with real life people"" classic movie from the 80's.  I was a young kid when I first saw this movie and I could not get enough of it, the acting, animation, plot, 40's film noir music, stunts, and cartoon themed adventure had been simply spectacular.

 1940's era tough guy film noir Detective Bob Hoskins is hired to take pictures, and spy on Cartoon movie mogul RK Maroon & his alleged affair with the sexually dynamic fem fatale Jessica Rabbit.  But when RK Maroon is mysteriously murdered, the legal ""Toon"" authorities, run by the dark maniacal Judge Doom (Christopher Lyod of Back to the Future & Star Trek), attempts to apprehend the magical cartoon star Roger Rabbit with the intention of summarily executing him for the crime.

  Roger Rabbit is desperate, and seeks Bob Hoskins help to try to clear his name, while also trying to investigate and figure out the real sinister plot at foot.

 With all of America's cartoon stars including Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Donald Duck, and Daffy Bob Hoskins with the help of a cartoon car named ""Benny"" navigate through the crazy and wild cartoon world of ""Toon Town"" to prevent the innocent Roger Rabbit from being scapegoated for the crime.

  This is a movie for all ages and is highly fun with amazing special effects and great acting, two thumbs way up and an A for ""Roger Rabbit"" one of the signature movies of the 80's.  I would have rated this film G or PG.",1426291200,,1436,4.650793650793651

And he jumped around a lot, which I found annoying rather than amusing or endearing.  I turned it off after five minutes.

83303,5,0788832492,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a humorous movie that makes you laugh and keeps you wanting more.  It was directed by Robert Zemeckis who prior to this was best known for Back to the Future which I will be reviewing later so I won't tell you anything about that now.  Who Framed Roger Rabbit is loosely based on a novel written by Gary K. Wolf, while Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman wrote the screenplay.

This movie was very enjoyable to watch.  It is set in the 1940's in Los Angeles. It is a world were Humans and Cartoons both exist which to me would be awesome. A famous toon known as Roger Rabbit (Charles Fleischer, voice) thought he had an easy life that is until he discovers that his wife, Jessica Rabbit (Kathleen Turner, voice) is having fun with R.K. Maroon (Alan Tilvern), after that things get really bad for Roger as he is now accused of murdering Mr. Maroon. Roger must now go to detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) , who has it out for toons for killing his brother.  Even though he doesn't want to he decides he will help Roger, escape from Judge Doom, and even try to clear Roger's name, in order to do this, he must travel all over L.A. and even into Toontown.

Who-Framed-Roger-Rabbit

The scene pictured above is one of my favorite in the movie.  Earlier Roger Rabbit slaps the handcuffs on the two of them which makes things very difficult for as far as navigating around L.A.  Then they get to a safe place to try and cut them off and Roger just slips his hand right out of them.  This makes Eddie very angry and Roger told him he could only do that when it was funny, which it was.

The special effects in this film were flat out amazing.  Throughout the movie you truly believe that toons and humans live in a world together because between the acting, animation and the editing of the scenes it was flawless.  This movie won an Oscar for Best Film Editing for Arthur Schmidt's work on the film as well as one for Best Effects, Visual Effects for the work by Ken Ralston, Richard Williams, Ed Jones and George Gibbs.
Overall I would give this movie an A because for 1989 you don't see anything like this as far as special effects and acting.  This movie was all around an enjoyment to watch and if you haven't seen it yet I highly recommend that you do.

It is difficult to find movies for her that she can appreciate that aren't steeped in too much violence or foul language.  While this movie has violence it is not gory or gratuitous and it serves the neo-noir plot (there is also one ""sad death"" of an animated shoe/character). But this is all made up for by the mystery plot, slapstick,  and wonderfully imagined world where ""toons"" and humans co-exist side-by-side.

83341,4,0788832492,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a live action/animated feature that revolutionized filmmaking...if only slightly. The combination of the two had not been carried out nearly as successfully until this film came to fruition. I must say, it was my favorite film of all time, that is until 2006 when tinseltown produced such gems as ""Ultraviolet"" starring Milla Jovovich and the original ""Step Up"" (not the sequels). But i digress, Who Framed Roger Rabbit takes you on a wacky and zany exploration that conjures of one's own childhood thru the indelible images it paints. Our story begins in 1947 where we are whisked away to Toontown the most terrible excuse for an online video game the world has ever seen. If you were a child in the early to mid 2000s you understand the frustration. None the less we arrive in Toontown an area close to Lost Angeles, to meet our protagonist Roger Sterling along with his wife Messica Rabbit, and the J. K. Maroon-Rowling the human owner Moron Cartoon Studios. J.K. hires junkie private eye Eddie Vedder to investigate rumors that Roger's broad is cheatin. Eddie has held a Ved-detta against Sterling and his crony tune friends after years earlier his own brother was murdered by grand piano falling on him; in classic cartoon fashion. Eddie Vedder then uncovers a conspiracy in which Messica IS in fact cheating (but not really) on Sterling with Toontown's owner Starvin Marvin Acme. Upon discovery of this Rog becomes distraght and runs away to be alone with his thoughts. However the next day Starvin is MURDERED thus placing Mr. Sterling as the most likely culprit. Ahh we arrive at the scene of the crime wherein Eddie Vedder meets MF DOOM who has been villianously plotting against the toons to dispatch them one by one over some fire beatz. Whether or not Roger will escape this predicament is a mystery, ill leave up to you to watch. But one thing is for sure, in Tunetown, nothing is quite what it seems. Tombtown is a city where you go in with your eyes open, or you don't come out at all. I highly recommend watching this.",1408406400,2,2061,4.727777777777778

Andrew's Bu-ray Review: Among the summer blockbusters of the 1980s, Who Framed Roger Rabbit [1988] stands out as a true original and audacious in concept, and bursting with ideas and innovation. Robert Zemeckis' film felt like something entirely new upon release, and because of the painstaking, hand-crafted animation and effects employed, and the unheard-of cooperation between studios, it remains a unique movie experience to this day.

Shortly after its publication, Walt Disney Pictures bought the film rights to the 1981 novel, Who Censored Roger Rabbit? by Gary K. Wolf. The book is set in modern day, and Roger is the star of a newspaper comic strip. He and his comic strip friends exist three-dimensionally in the real world, their word balloons visible above their heads when they speak. Early in Walt Disney Pictures script development, the concept was changed to cartoon characters living amongst humans. Director Robert Zemeckis was shown a draft of the script in 1982; he was enthusiastic, but the Disney regime of the time backed off due to budgetary concerns. Steven Spielberg later saw the script and arranged for his production company, Amblin Entertainment, to co-produce the film with Walt Disney Pictures, and bring Robert Zemeckis in as director. Robert Zemeckis turned the story into a period piece, specifically setting it in 1947. As he told Animation Magazine, ""I had three reasons for that change: First, that it would make it timeless, second, it would help suspend the disbelief that this was happening in a Once upon a time era; and third, I couldn't figure out how you could mix the different styles of animation, so I felt we had to draw the line before the era of television.""

'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' has aged remarkably well. 25 years after its release, in a time when mixing live-action with CGI creations is commonplace, 'Roger Rabbit' is still relevant. The way the live-action characters like Bob Hoskins specifically, interact with the animated characters is just as believable as modern day movies that are working with exponentially more technology than Robert Zemeckis had in 1988.

It wasn't the first time that animation and live-action were mixed, but it was the best. Robert Zemeckis recently gave an interview, in which he discussed how they were able to create the illusion so effectively. One aspect that he mentions is the fact that the camera actually moves around the animated characters, with the living actors still in frame. This was an extremely difficult job since up until then animations had simply been placed flat on the frame with the actors trying to act like they were really there. The technical wizardry applied here still astounds me. However, its technical savvy isn't the only reason to admire 'Roger Rabbit,' it's pretty damn funny too.

The world Robert Zemeckis developed here is one of the most immersive movie settings I've ever experienced. He creates a living breathing world in which humans and cartoons share the same space. Nothing ever feels forced or out of place. Instead, the entire experience is so completely integrated that you believe it implicitly. There's no need for strenuous, overdrawn exposition about why the Toons exist along with humans. All you need to know is that they do.

Roger Rabbit [Charles Fleischer] is the most famous Toon in Toontown. He was born... I mean drawn, to make people laugh. Sadly, he's fallen on hard times. His smokin' hot wife Jessica Rabbit [Kathleen Turner] may be cheating on him, and to top it all off, somebody has framed him for murder. Thrown into the mix is lonely private eye Eddie Valiant [Bob Hoskins]. Eddie hates Toons, ""A Toon killed my brother,"" he sneers. But, Eddie also loves money, so he takes a job spying on Roger Rabbit's wife to see if she's up to no good.

What makes 'Roger Rabbit' so successful, other than the deftly executed technicalities of it all is the fact that the movie is wholly self-aware. It understands why Toons are funny and plays with the clichs. You get a sense of that awareness at the very beginning when Roger Rabbit, acting in an animated short, is unable to conjure up floating stars after being smashed by a fridge. Instead, tiny birds pop up and start flying around his noggin. ""Stars, Roger! Stars!"" the director yells. The movie is replete with this type of scene, moments that embrace the wackiness of a bygone era, when animated shorts involved little more than an anvil being dropped on someone's head.

'Roger Rabbit' is refreshingly adult. It doesn't shy away from cartoons cursing. It's also strange to see Mickey Mouse inhabiting the same screen as Baby Herman, but it happens here. Not to mention the fact that this is one of the only places you'll be able to see a brightly coloured clash of the imaginations of Walt Disney and Chuck Jones. Watching a Donald Duck and Daffy Duck duelling piano show is one of the many delights of the film. 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is a true classic in terms of technical prowess and storytelling. Hoskins work here is more believable than many modern day actors can pull off with CGI helping them out. This is still, arguably, Robert Zemeckis' most inventive. Finally having it on Blu-ray is a treat. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a landmark animation film to those in the animation industry. It came as a much-needed shot in the arm at a time when TV cartoons had reached a low point and feature-length animated films were bombing at the box office.

Blu-ray Video Quality  'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' comes to Blu-ray with a 1080p presentation. You'll notice inconsistent blacks, wavering grain structures, flickering animation, and a line of other oddities as the film progresses. What you won't notice is any sign of extreme age or wear and tear. A lot of love has gone into bringing this movie to Blu-ray, yet the source material holds it back from becoming perfect. The good news is that most of the movie looks great. Whenever the stage is lit well the live-action and animation both shine. Detail is rich, giving us uninterrupted views of Bob Hoskins' inhuman amount of shoulder hair. Each hair is well-defined, as are the textures of Eddie's stereotypical private eye getup. I've never seen Jessica Rabbit's dress look so clear and gorgeously rendered. The moment she walks out on stage is a wow moment. Not just because of her well-endowed features, but because this is where you can tell the finer resolution is really giving this movie more visual oomph than it's ever had.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The Touchstone Entertainment 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix also features some troubling aspects that cropped up as a result of the tricky way in which the film was filmed. You'll most likely notice quite a few scenes, particularly the first time Eddie and Roger visit the bar, where some instances when inconsistent and muffled voices stick out like a sore thumb. In that scene, a few voices sound otherworldly, and a few instances remain where sound doesn't sync up to the moving lips. Alan Silvestri's memorable score, which not so coincidentally has a ton in common with the score to 'Back to the Future,' holds up very well here. His rousing strings and booming drums are given ample room to spread out and keep the movie tense. Rear channels are filled with ambient sound. The busy streets of Los Angeles feature cars driving by in the background and people milling about, whereas the zany streets of Toontown are an all-out riot in the rear channels. It really adds to the overall enjoyment of the movie. It's like you're being surrounded by Toons. Aside from a few dialogue missteps here and there, most of it comes across as being clearly intelligible. Cartoon-inspired sound effects have a decent depth to them and is deep and well-resolved. I found the Touchstone Entertainment audio mix to be a playful, immersive experience.

Finally, there are so many reasons to love 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' It's an innovative idea that was taken to a whole new level by Robert Zemeckis and his crew. He truly had a vision of what the movie could be like if done right and they succeeded by any measure. Not only is the technical side of the movie impressive, but the entire world created here is completely overpowering. It sucks you into a strange alternate reality where cartoons inhabit the same world as people. Disney has done an admirable job restoring the animation film for HD treatment. The video has a few problems here and there, but should, on the whole, make fans happy. The audio mix sounds great though, barring a few minor glitches. 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' is highly recommended and ever since I viewed this at the cinema and on an inferior Region 1 DVD I have loved the film, as it was at the time so ahead of its time in combining Actors and Cartoon Characters with Disney and the M-G-M Musicals, which has been always successful, but with today's computer technology the process of putting Actors with Cartoon Characters is so much easier, whereas when this film was made, the logistics were so much of a headache. But despite this, this is a fantastic beautiful Blu-ray and it has now gone pride of place in my ever increasing Steven Spielberg Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump) somewhat perfected the art of animation mixed with live action, though ""Mary Poppins"" did it as well (20+ years earlier). Having seen it's initial release, I thought I should have this in my collection. Certainly, it's clever and cute and fun, and Bob Hoskins' performance is outstanding, but if it was a live action film, it would only be mildly amusing. There are some clever lines, and Kathleen Turner's Jessica Rabbit is spot-on, but it didn't blow me away.

The music and mood are more ""cinema noir"" than almost all American attempts to actually be cinema noir.

83452,5,0788832492,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a really interesting film - humans interacting with cartoons, Loony Toons and Disney Cartoon characters appearing side by side, a decidedly sexed up cartoon wife, and an alcoholic detective. It's not really the classic ""Disney Image"" we're used to -  probably why Disney made the decision to release it under its Touchstone banner, much like it did with Nightmare Before Christmas a couple years later. That said, it's great to finally see Roger Rabbit get a bluray release.

As far as the release goes, the movie has been digitally remastered and looks great on bluray. An added bonus is that it's a combo pack so you get the bluray and a DVD. Focusing on the special features - they are perfect. The biggest inclusion for me were The Roger Rabbit Shorts (Tummy Trouble, Rollercoaster Rabbit, Trail Mix-Up) which have also been remastered. Other special features of note include a making of documentary, audio commentary with the filmmakers (although the late great Bob Haskins did not contribute to the commentary, sadly), and Behind The Ears: The True Story Of Roger Rabbit.

My one source of contention with this release is the packaging. For such a landmark film, being released for the first time on bluray, I had hoped that the packaging wouldn't be so cheap and flimsy. It's a fairly standard bluray case, but the material seems thinner, less sturdy. There's no inserts or booklets included. It's literally just 2 discs inside a cheap case.

Heard of the movie and seen snippets in my youth in the 90's, but not 'til 2003 (coincidentally the year of the film's 15th anniversary at the time) did I start to see it and loved it ever since (though mostly with Jessica Rabbit at the time). As time pass by, I started to enjoy more of it from cute little Roger Rabbit to his and Jessica's relationship with each other (which is beautiful in my opinion). Another great thing is that both Disney AND Warner characters star together (the only time probably you'll see Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny on-screen together). In short, the best live action/animated hybrid film I've seen and can still be enjoyed by kids and their families. The Blu-ray transfer looks fantastic as does the shorts and additional extras include a commentary by Robert Zemeckis and crew, a making of documentary, a featurette, triva track, and the deleted Pig Head sequence which was shown on early 90's cable TV airings. Whether you're a fan of the golden age of animation, an 80's fan, new to the film, or just any fan, this film is a worthy addition to your collection. Highly, and I mean HIGHLY recommended!",1398556800,,1346,4.6125
83461,5,0788832492,"Great re-issue of the original flick in higher quality. Plus three extra animated shorts, and a commentary from the actor who did the voice for Roger Rabbit.",1398556800,,157,4.851851851851852
83462,5,0788832492,"What is not to like about Roger Rabbit? I don't have a high definition TV so excuse me if I liked it just fine as is! It was one of the earlier CGI/actor/cartoon interactions, but the cast, the direction, the story, everything works on every level. Those of us who grew up with cartoons was characters from all eras which was nice that studios got over ""corporate protections"" and lent their characters to meld in ""Toonland."" This is one of those movies that is endless and timeless. One that we watch several times. Great movie for and indoor afternoon. Pop a bag of popcorn, sit back and relax and just enjoy. Two thumbs up for the movie, God bless, and make it your best day!",1398384000,,678,4.432

83464,5,0788832492,"This was a fun show.  I have never seen anything like it.  I was not sure how it should be rated.  Since I can not give it a 4.6, I gave it a 5 Star.  I will probably watch the movie every couple of years, because it is so unique.  The lead actor is blended in with cartoons.",1397433600,,275,3.6724137931034484

Not only does it have the movie, along with a dvd version, but it has the 3 original Roger Rabbit shorts. While Disney characters had a hand in this, it's clear that Zemeckis had his heart in the WB universe, where most of the wackiness in this comes from. A fun story with some great twists, but it has a lot of heart too. Well worth adding to anyone's collection!",1394928000,2,527,4.227722772277228

(children of the 90's and anything prior to that) we need a resurgence of roger rabbit. it will do our society well. the best christopher lloyd movie along side back to the future and the very best bob hoskins film. the best zemeckis film along side back to the future. someone please start making roger rabbit and baby herman shorts to show before movies again besides awful trailers for awful films, we need to get our money's worth somehow when going to the theater.",1388966400,,935,4.473684210526316

The audio and picture are both phenomenal.  No distortions, no grainy appearance or compression artifacts.  Really made a fantastic gift for the family.  About the only thing I wish it had would be English subtitles that are NOT for the hearing impaired.  The only english subtitles available have audio cues for noises, music, etc, instead of just speech. I didn't take any stars off for it though because that sadly is the case for at least 90% of the US release BluRays I've tried out.",1388016000,2,629,4.621621621621622

And before and after scenes complete with the shorts 1989's Tummy Trouble shown before Honey I Shrank the Kids (Shrunk is grammatically incorrect) Roller Coaster Rabbit shown prior to Dick Tracy in 90 and Trail Mix-Up (prior to the boring) A Far Off Place in 91.,1381017600,,474,4.654761904761905

83582,5,0788832492,"Roger Rabbit is one of my favorite classic films and it is still my favorite now. Who Framed Roger Rabbit had many cartoon characters like Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse, Daffy Duck, Droopy Dog, and Bugs Bunny. My favorite scenes are when the Toon weasels who cannot stop laughing to they die and the piano duel between Daffy and Donald. It is 1947 where Toons and humans coexist together, a Toon hating and drunk private eye (Hoskins) whose brother was killed by a Toon, had no sense of humor and was hired by a greedy and short tempered producer (Tilvern) to follow Roger Rabbit's (Fleischer) wife, Jessica Rabbit (Turner) who is ""cheating"" on Roger. He does not know that he will battle a corrupt judge with a dark secret (Lloyd) and his idiotic and murderous Toon weasel henchmen to free Roger of murder charges of a factory owner (Kaye). Who Framed Roger Rabbit is so funny and I promise you will not regret this recommend if you buy this funny film.",1380067200,,950,4.594117647058823

83584,5,0788832492,"This movie works on a lot of different levels, foremost being nostalgia for the appearances (albeit brief) of so many beloved cartoon characters.  My favorite scene remains the piano duel between Donald Duck and Daffy.  It also benefits from a great cast, starting with an irascible performance by Bob Hoskins.  Joanna Cassidy is perfect as his longsuffering girlfriend and Christopher Lloyd makes a great villain.  Outstanding special effects, a visual treat from start to finish.

83677,5,0788832492,"I recently took a look at one of my all-time favorite films, recently released on Blu-ray, Who Framed Roger Rabbit. I must say that it is held up extremely well after nearly a quarter of a century, and remains, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. The plot is a classic whodunit made in the style of 1940s noir, like The Maltese Falcon, a style that it captures quite well. The plot does keep you guessing (assuming you've never seen it before), with clues and red herrings aplenty. The protagonist Eddie Valiant, played by Bob Hoskins in a superb performance, has the perfect accent and outlook to pull off the closed off hard-boiled detective type. Christopher Lloyd as the villain Judge Doom is another perfect casting, as a threatening and formidable threat to the safety of Toontown.

What propels this film to its legendary status is the unbelievable and unparalleled cinematography. The audience's suspension of disbelief is complete and all encompassing, as you truly do believe that these cartoon characters are interacting with the real world. The shadows match, the perspective matches, essentially everything about these cartoons is made to look real part from the celluloid. Roger Rabbit and the fellow citizens of Toontown, who range from all of the different animation houses of the era from Disney to Warner Bros. and beyond, are believable in their presence and personalities, which all stay true to the original incarnations. The effects are so great that the cartoons can even interact with real-world objects, and the objects move believably. Helped by all of this are the actors' performances, who all behave as those cartoons are really in the room. Behind the scenes, the voice actors really were in the room, lending to the realism of the dialogue. All in all, this film is as close to perfect, I believe, as a film can get.

The extras for the Blu-ray release a great too. It includes all of the documentaries from earlier DVD releases, so nothing is lost in the upgrade. Also included are the original Roger rabbit shorts that appeared in front of Disney films in the early 1990s, which are all great and stay true to the tone of the film. This really is a great film and a great release, worth every penny of the purchase price. I give it my highest recommendation for any film lover, animation lover, or just anybody who likes cartoons from when they were a kid.",1372118400,,2401,4.797101449275362

83701,5,0788832492,"I love this movie so much. It's such a fun movie and it is extremely well made.

The film is based on a novel by Gary K. Wolf, and it takes place in a town filled with cartoon characters and real people. The film is about a detective named Eddie Valiant, and a rabbit named Roger who is an actor that plays in cartoons. Eddie is getting payed to take pictures of Roger's beautiful wife Jessica, who seems to be having an affair with a real man. We later find out that was not true, and that Jessica was forced to pose for those pictures, otherwise Roger would never work in that town again. Throughout the movie, a creepy man called The Judge and his Toon Patrol are after Roger after he gets framed for murder.

This is an amazing movie in so many ways. It is also the film that helped the Disney company get back on it's feet when it was going through a hard time. I totally recommend this movie to anyone.",1371772800,,908,4.182857142857143
83702,2,0788832492,I would advise anyone to be careful about the versions that you buy. The Region 2 version won't play in American DVD players and only on your computer.,1371513600,,151,4.428571428571429
83703,5,0788832492,"Another film where the bad guys are only in it for, ah, the money. Intimately reconstructed Los Angeles of the 1940s, where people said things like ""who needs a car in LA, we've got the best public transportation system in the world."" Wild noir stuff, contrasted with goofy kids stuff. ""A toon killed his brother. Dropped a pianio on his head."" Wild Donald versus Daffy sequence... with guns. ""Can anybody underthtand what thith duck ith th-th-thaying?"" Flipping patty-cake photos imitate animation - very cleverly meta-cinematographic. Baby Herman is over the top - ""my problem is I got a 50-year-old's lust and a three-year-old's dinky."" Toon violence, shave-and-a-haircut two bits. Eddie grabs Delores' shirt. Freaky deaky ending very screamingly weird, man!

The film comes with great extras: Deleted ""Pighead"" scene, which includes weird equipment Bob Hoskins had to wear on set. ""Tummy Trouble"" short with Nurse Jessica and all the syringe insanity, and a killer sadistic Droopy. ""Roller Coster Rabbit"", featuring the world's most psychotic roller coster. Hostage Jessica, Snidely Droopy says ""Curses, foiled again."" ""What's the matter, toots, afraid of a little... bang?"" ""Trail Mixiup"" shows Ranger Jessica. Between legs shot: ""Only you can prevent forest fires"" in sexy voice. Most back office guys who give comments in the special features have facial hear - mustaches at least, or full beards. Why is that? The guy who did the voice of Roger Rabbit wore a Roger Rabbit costume while he did his voice acting. One year of post production, no CG!!!

I love you more than any woman has ever loved a rabbit.

Jessica is somewhere in between a human and a toon. The sneak previews were bad. Zemekis had final cut, he didn't budge on it. The film was called by many who were on the cast and crew as ""difficult to make.""

The challenge of designing the rabbis is that they had to make him distinct from Bugs Bunny. They rushed out the Roger Rabbit design, too many colours, triangle-shaped like a dunce hat, needed a peach impediment (lip ruffle?). Chapinesque tex Avery style of animation. JOel Silver first human actor in the whole show. Bob Hoskins did a perfect American accent. ""There's really no reason to shoot a film in the US."" This was the first time to get all of the cartoons of the various studios into one film. Why is there no question mark after the title. Toon swearing was a problem for Disney. Roger has no shoulders (or nose), Jessica has no waist so that there would be no accusations that a human actor was used and then rotored out. ""Why Don't You Do Right"" by Peggy Lee was sung by Amy Irving. An actor who was strangeld by Darth Vader is in Roger Rabbit.",1371254400,,2682,4.811279826464208

83705,5,0788832492,"This is a very underrated movie by most people.

83765,4,0788832492,"This is an amazing accomplishment in animation combined with life action.  Disney had done this sort of thing -- ""The Three Caballeros"" (1945) being an excellent example -- but not to this degree of finesse.  The animated characters have been made to appear as three dimensional objects in the real world.  Nearly every detail was addressed in this film,  although the reflection of the weasels in the side of their black car was, I believe, missed.  The ""live"" cast was quite good here, especially Christopher Lloyd, unforgettably evil.  A few of the original voices were used for some of the animated characters, including the great Mel Blanc and Mae Questel (Betty Boop).

But the Blu-ray process has its own oddities in exposing all the details of a given frame.  In the shots combining animated characters with live actors, of which there are several, the evidence of their being process shots is more apparent in the Blu-ray format.  The crystal clarity noted in scenes with actors without animated subjects backs off slightly in scenes combined with animation.  The previous editions in VHS, LD and even DVD could not disclose this degree of information, but Blu-ray is merciless in its divulgence of data and, as the saying goes:  You have to take the bitter with the batter.

This is not to say that I didn't enjoy watching this groundbreaking film in Blu-ray -- I certainly did.  But Blu-ray lays it all out in front of us.  Like it or not, it's all there.",1367625600,4,1466,4.788844621513944

83828,1,0788832492,"My husband and I bought the film this week and were very excited that one of our favorite movies as kids was finally getting the Blu Ray treatment.  It's a great film and not to be missed, especially for Disney and animation fans in general.

Though the reason I write this review is not because the movie is disappointing.  Far from it, it's a wonderful film.  The reason why I am giving a one star review is for a 25th Anniversary edition Blu Ray. It's far from perfect and in fact, it's a very bad and disappointing transfer to high definition.

Upon putting the Blu Ray into our PS3, first issue is how much ""snow"" and fuzziness was in the opening animation.  It was hard to watch with the amount of noise.  Nothing was clean and watching it long enough eventually hurt our eyes.  Usually playing on a blu ray player and watching on a high definition TV could fix or clean it up, but no such luck.  When my husband jump forward to live action sequence, it was not much different.  The noise made scenes darker and nighttime scenes harder to watch than the animation sequences.

My main beef with the Blu ray is if Disney/Touchstone passed it off as a 25th anniversary edition, it should have gotten the 25th anniversary treatment.  It is second rate at best and looks like it wasn't worked on enough, if not at all.  What is sad is that I had purchased the Vista Series DVD in 2003, and the transfer on that DVD from 10 years ago looks better than this Blu Ray....  Another review I read online from another site, a ""professional"" reviewer claims that the reason why the Blu Ray transfer was bad was because the movie was filmed wrong from the beginning.  I find that hard to believe, or the reviewer didn't know what he was talking about.  If other companies or Disney themselves can take the time to restore films like The Wizard of OZ or Cinderella and make them look like they were filmed yesterday; than it should not be that hard to restore this film, no matter how ""poorly"" it was originally filmed.

Sad to say, my husband and I returned the Blu Ray.  It was a huge letdown, or maybe we're now spoiled.  Either way, Disney did not do this film justice and it is really sad, because it's a great film.",1365552000,7,2212,4.3906633906633905

When the Bluray was announced, I immediately ordered it, but when I received it in the mail, I began to be a little disappointed. The packaging is completely bare bones with no insert, pretty rare for a 25th anniversary. I popped the disc in to watch and found the menus to be pretty standard, but when the movie started, that's when the real disappointment came...

The film has not been remastered. This is just a Bluray of what was on the DVD. It's grainy and not is true high definition. For a film like Who Framed Roger Rabbit? on its 25th anniversary, it was a real let down.

Still, it is Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and I'd enjoy it in any format. It's a classic nostalgic trip to the golden age of Hollywood cartoons, with all your favorite Warner Bros, Disney and MGM cartoon characters. Hilarious and touching, with excellent performances by Bob Hoskins (Eddie Valiant) and Christopher Lloyd (Judge Doom), Who Framed Roger Rabbit? is great for both kids and adults, especially those who grew up with all those classic cartoons.

But for the price, you should probably wait until they shed the DVD in the package and lower the price. Or perhaps until they come out with a remastered version. 50th anniversary anyone?",1365120000,6,1372,4.5465587044534415

83847,4,0788832492,"An iconic film that ushered in a whole new wave of animated blockbusters, Robert Zemeckis' box-office smash from the summer `88 was one of those movies -- much like ""Terminator 2"" and ""Jurassic Park"" - that people rushed out to see repeated times for its landmark visual achievements alone.

Live action and animation were combined in a seamless, almost three-dimensional manner by animator Richard Williams and ILM for Zemeckis' frothy 1988 ""cartoon noir."" Based on a novel by Gary K. Wolf, ""Roger Rabbit"" examines the craziness that ensues once alcoholic private eye Eddie Valiant (the terrific Bob Hoskins) is hired to investigate the possible relationship between toon star Jessica Rabbit and cartoon guru Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye). What Valiant finds is that Acme is murdered and all signs point to Jessica's husband -- cartoon star Roger Rabbit. With Roger in tow, pleading his innocence, Eddie reluctantly uncovers a seedy underworld buried beneath ""Toontown,"" where Disney, Warner Bros., and MGM stars hang out after hours at clubs and other secluded hideaways.

An old-fashioned movie in more ways than one, ""Roger Rabbit"" was produced with hand-drawn animation and motion capture techniques that gave the animated characters a 3-D like appearance when set against live-action backdrops. That this process worked so much better here than in any prior attempt at mixing live-action and animation is entirely due to the craftsmanship of Zemeckis, Williams and particularly the ILM visual effects crew. Made in the pre-CGI era, the filmmakers relied on tried-and-true techniques in making their film come to life - they just did a more effective job than anyone else ever had, and their attention to detail still shines through in high-definition.

""Roger Rabbit"" rightly copped several Oscars for its technical wizardry, which help compensate for a somewhat over-praised script (credited to Jeffrey Price and Peter Seaman), which is never as compelling as the visceral element of the film. Hoskins' performance, though, is the glue that holds the movie together, and is rightly singled out by director Zemeckis in his audio commentary.

Disney's Blu-Ray boasts what certainly looks like an unadulterated 1080p AVC encoded transfer that preserves the sometimes varied appearance of the film. Dean Cundey's golden-hued cinematography is like a love letter to post-WWII Hollywood, but because of all the special effects processes, grain is predictably more visible in some sequences than others. Given all the technical challenges involved in bringing the film to life, it's understandable, and for the most part, the transfer is quite good (and either way, it's unlikely the film will ever look better than it does here). The 5.1 DTS MA audio is active throughout, boasting an energetic and at-times bittersweet score by Alan Silvestri that ranks as one of his best.

Extra features are cobbled together from prior DVD releases of the film, though most fans will be thrilled to learn that the set includes three remastered Roger Rabbit shorts that were released with other Disney films in the late '80s (""Tummy Trouble,"" ""Trail Mix-Up,"" and ""Rollercoaster Rabbit""). These shorts - the release of which apparently irritated producer Spielberg at the time (he wanted one of them playing in front of his Amblin co-produced ""Arachnophobia"") - look spectacular here, with glorious detail and color that's absent from the film itself.

In addition to a 10-minute ""Making Of"" hosted by Roger's voice Charles Fleischer and aimed at kids, the BD rehashes other supplements from the 2003 DVD, including a full group audio commentary by Zemeckis, Frank Marshall, the writers, and ILM supervisor Ken Ralston; a 40-minute documentary featuring interviews with the cast and crew;  split-screen comparisons of before-and-after FX footage; and the infamous ""Pig Head"" sequence, which was deleted from the film but added to CBS' network TV broadcasts in the early '90s. An accompanying DVD in the package (the same Disc 1 from the 2003 DVD in fact) also includes ""The Valiant Files,"" which compiles still photos from various stages of production, as well as the original theatrical trailer via an easter egg (select ""Movie Theater"" on the on-screen menu and press down four times to access it).

""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is one of those dizzying, frantic Zemeckis films that pushed the technical boundaries of its day, remaining a favorite of both animation fans and fantasy aficionados. It's a shame that reported squabbles between Spielberg and Disney curtailed a long-in-development sequel (or prequel), which at one point was to have featured five original songs written by Alan Menken. While it's hard to think of another genre blockbuster to make as much money as ""Roger Rabbit"" and not generate a follow-up, the 1988 film is still a unique viewing experience that's lost none of its charm.",1365033600,7,4885,5.2618741976893455
83848,4,0788832492,"For all of my childhood, Who Framed Roger Rabbit has been one of my favorite movies.  Thankfully, it's another one of those movies that still holds up really well as an adult.

1988 was quite a year for animation.  Out in Japan, Grave of the Fireflies, My Neighbor Totoro, and Akira were released in theaters and were all superbly animated films that in scales from good to masterful, delivered storylines and themes unheard of at the time.  Over in America, we were treated to Who Framed Roger Rabbit, which gave audiences a hybrid of live-action film and animation that to this day, is unmatched in how sublime it is, which is also helped by its other strong qualities (more on that later).

STORY

It's 1947 in Los Angeles, and cartoons (known as ""Toons"" in this movie) aren't mere pictures on celluloid, but rather like real actors.  Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is an alcoholic private detective in LA, and after being paid by cartoonist R.K. Maroon (Alan Tilvern) to take pictures of Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye) playing patty cake with Jessica Rabbit (voiced by Kathleen Turner), causing Jessica's husband, Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) to lose his mind.  Eddie soon gets tangled in a murder mystery after Marvin Acme was murdered, and must uncover the truth as to who really killed Acme.

CHARACTERS

For the most part, the characters in this movie are done really well.  As an adult, I really appreciate the fact that Eddie is a troubled man struggling with booze because given the tragedy he had in the past (I won't spoil it for you), gives him a layer of realism.  Also, Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) is one of the creepiest villains from movies in my childhood, as he maintains a consistently menacing persona and does really cold-blooded things that can put Doom in the same league as the best horror icons.  Roger and Jessica Rabbit are great at providing solid humor, along with Doom's gang of cartoon weasels.  However, I wish characters like the bartender Dolores (Joanna Cassidy) had more time to develop.

HUMOR

The humor in this movie is really solid.  The humor is a perfect homage to the masterful slapstick and exaggerated bodily distortion of the classic Tex Avery and Looney Tunes cartoons.  One of the funniest things in this movie was when Eddie goes to the nightclub the night Acme gets killed, and the opening act is Daffy and Donald Duck in a piano battle.  Seeing these two iconic cartoon ducks engage in slapstick antics against each other was hilarious (especially when Donald fired a cannon at Daffy).  Another was when Eddie faces his fears about driving into Toontown, he dumps his glass flask of whiskey and using a cartoon gun that Yosemite Sam gave him some years back, fires a cartoon bullet that's a caricature of an American Indian, and the bullet uses a giant tomahawk to smash the flask.  Another is when Dolores catches Eddie in his office with Jessica with his pants down (literally), and she says to him ""Are you dabbling in water colors, Eddie?""  There's plenty of other funny parts in this movie, but I think you get the picture.

APPEARANCE

The cinematography for this movie is marvelous.  The set designs perfectly capture that 1940's noir feeling, and the designs of the cartoons perfectly fit the setting it takes place in.  The animation of the characters is totally fluid, and is even more impressive considering that the ""interactions"" with the cartoons and real people was seamless.  With this being made before the age of CGI, it's even more impressive to see all this and see the cartoon characters believably carry around real props like guns.  I think along with John Carpenter's The Thing, Who Framed Roger Rabbit has some of the most remarkable special effects and visuals ever done in cinema.

On a sidenote, the interior of the Acme gag factory looks a bit like something out of Tim Burton's imagination.

SOUNDTRACK

Alan Silvestri's score for this movie is near perfect.  Like the visuals, the music fits the setting of this movie like a glove, and one of my favorite pieces of music is near the end, when Eddie has a showdown with Judge Doom and his weasel minions, since it's so heart-pumping and memorable.  The original song ""Why Don't You Do Right"" is pretty catchy and is a great fit for the style of the movie.

MATURE CONTENT

Even though this is a PG movie, there's some scenes that kids might not get or could scare them.  Some of the adult innuendo provided by Jessica Rabbit and even the weasels at times will probably fly over some kids' heads.  However, there's a really creepy scene near the beginning where Judge Doom demonstrates his brand of justice by grabbing a squeaking cartoon shoe and slowly kills it in a barrel full of a chemical cocktail made specifically to ""kill"" cartoons called ""the dip.""  This scene scared me a lot when I was a little kid and even as an adult, still get creeped out by this scene.  Similarly, there's some parts near the end during Eddie's showdown with Doom that were creepy, but I won't mention these because I don't want to spoil anything big in relation to the movie's story.

On another sidenote, it's funny to think that there's plenty of bad anime titles like Elfen Lied and Gantz that abuse bloody gore and dismemberment scenes ad nauseam to seem ""creepy"" yet the dark scenes in WFRR actually feel intimidating without using bloodshed.

FINAL WORD

Who Framed Roger Rabbit is certainly a classic, and a really good homage to 1940's noir and of the Golden Age of Cartoons.  If you love the aforementioned things, you owe it to yourself to reserve a movie night for this live-action/cartoon hybrid gem.",1364947200,3,5638,4.757201646090535

I've owned it on VHS, and on DVD, and now on Blu-Ray, and yes, the Blu-Ray edition does look better -- but it doesn't look MUCH better. The film obviously hasn't been remastered, just cleaned up and upscaled. I realize that for a film like this, with the separate animation and live action sources, that remastering just may be out of the question, and they would have gotten 4 stars out of me if that was all that was wrong with this edition, but, for a 25th anniversary edition of the film -- THIS is what they give the fans, REALLY?!

As I show in the video, in comparison with the DVD version of the film (released in 2003), this edition is so bare-bones it is pathetic. Aside from the film and the same special features as the DVD version you get ... the case ... and that's it. And it was a bait-and-switch case at that. I am thinking of returning the version they sent me, and re-ordering it in proper Blu-Ray packaging. (When I pre-ordered it, they were just listing it as the Blu-Ray release of the film, NOW they are talking about the DVD vs. Blu-Ray packing (they obviously had supply issues, I cannot imagine a plausible reason for any studio to release a Blu-Ray film in DVD packaging)). Even the menu for the Blu-Ray is just a static background with clips from the film playing, and a menu list. Compare that to the interactive (and obviously created for the DVD release) menus of the DVD, and you can a stark difference. I don't object to a lack of interactive menus, per se (I realize that some people regard that as useless clutter), but the fact that they didn't do ANYTHING bothers me. It is just a clip show and a menu list, anyone with basic video editing equipment could have thrown that together, heck, I could have thrown that together with the same tools I used to make the video review -- and that is just insulting for a 25th anniversary release of a film.

The video shows a comparison of the presentation of the 2 editions in their packaging, their main menus, and a scene from the movie (to show video quality).  Overall, I am disappointed with this release of the film. I LOVE the film, and I intend to keep my Blu-Ray copy of it -- but I also intend to keep the older packaging, because quite frankly, the current edition's packaging is garbage and insulting for a 25th anniversary release.

As for the Blu-ray Disc, the quality is great. Good audio and video. It's still edited, but that will never change.(If you want to see Jessica Rabbits crotch, get the VHS.)

83907,5,0788832492,"When I first saw Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, it was like an epiphany. While the combination of live action and animation was and still is remarkable (and astonishingly great considering that the effects were all optical and pre-digital), what resounded with me was the cartoon characters cameos and the grand assemblage of them all together (I won't spoil it for those who have not seen it).

I and many fellow animation enthusiasts felt vindicated for all those years of what some termed ""baby stuff."" Animation was hip, cartoons were now cool and Steven Spielberg was buying cels. Roger Rabbit the film became a benchmark for animation for every age, especially adults who grew up with it and wanted to see it aimed at them.

Thus came The Simpsons and copycats that imitated both Roger and Homer. There were cartoons for kids, cartoons for grownups and a new ""golden age"" at Disney, where now-classics like Beauty and the Beast delighted everyone. Many of the artists -- and there were TONS of them -- cut their teeth on the huge international effort that went into producing Who Framed Roger Rabbit and went on to greater successes on their own.

So how does it look now? Gorgeous on Blu-ray, particularly the Toontown sequence, but also even the darker scenes take on a luster and sheen because every detail is defined. It holds up quite well, not as shockingly adult as it seemed to parents back in 1988, as compared to today, with far more racy scenes and strong language more prevalent in mainstream media, even ""family"" films and TV.

It seems likely that many of the cartoon characters who pop up in Who Framed Roger Rabbit may become more and more obscure, sadly, except to animation and Disney buffs. Several generations have missed out on regular TV viewings of classic cartoons, so the character cameos do not all have the impact they had back in '88. It's like watching Around the World in 80 Days today with people who are only familiar with the here and now. They may not know David Niven, much less Cantinflas, and the star-studded parade they encountered in what was a sensation in its day.

83908,2,0788832492,"If I were reviewing the movie it would get 5 stars, A+, two thumbs up. But I am writing this in regards to the blu ray release. So it gets two stars, C-, no thumbs.

This release has ZERO new extras from the DVD release from 10 years ago. No effort put into making it for the fans of the movie and no real benefits from the blu ray capabilities. The movie looks good, no complaints there. But there is so much more they could have done, and seeing a lot of blu ray releases of old movies have a lot of time and effort put into them (Casablanca, North by Northwest, Jaws ect) we know they could have but decided to be cheap. You don't even get the Benny the Cab menu that was on the DVD.

The DVD version in this combo pack is a fullscreen version, and no talk on if they will correct this or just let it go. Thankfully if you have the old DVD Collectors Edition, disc 2 is all in Widescreen, including the special features. There was a good amount of effort put into that 10 years ago. I wish at least half that effort was put into this one.

They could have done better.",1363305600,7,1071,4.0424528301886795
83909,1,0788832492,"Ok let me start by saying This has nothing to do with Amazon.com nor do I hate the movie in and of itself. In fact it was a big favorite of mine.  I saw the movie in the theater.  It was an amazing work.  Fastforward 3 years later when it came to VHS.  I noticed several lines and scenes were cut from the movie for home release.

 1)The early scene where Eddie Valient talks with Brer Bear is gone.  2)In the night club where Donald and Daffy Duck have their piano duel Daffy originaly said""Of course you realize this means war.""  It's cut to him only saying ""This means war.""  3) The scene Roger and Eddie are handcuffed in his office and the weasles come to investigate:  Smart Ass(yes that is the lead weasle's name) Asks ""Where's Da rabbit?"" Eddies the said "" You mean  the one with the orange pants, long ears, and clodhopper feet?""  SA:  ""Yeah.""  Eddie:  ""Haven't seen him.""  This is cut to ""Where's the rabbit?"" ""Haven't seen him.""  Sure took away one of the funniest parts to me. 4)When Roger and Eddie are hiding out in the movie theater Eddie tells Roger and Delores "" I just don't get the connection between R K Maroon and Cloverleaf.""  Shortly a news reel comes up explaining R. K. Maroon and Cloverleaf became business partners which proved the conection.  Am I cursed with an excellent memory?
Maybe/not.

Now that is off my chest I figured when it came out on DVD it would be fully restored.  Wrong.  Yes it was widescreen which is an improvement but not restored.
Yes, I was disappointed.

Now I saw it come to Blu Ray and 25th anniversary  I thought ""Surely for this edition it would finally be fully theatically restored.""  I was crest fallen.  I mean compared the regular DVD there is little else to offer in the movie nor the bonus features. The picture and sound qualities were only slightly better than DVD edition.

This why I gave an otherwise great film a crappy rating.  I would give it a half star if I could.

If you are generally a fan of WFRR and want it on Blu Ray, buy it. If you are like me and expected more out of it with this edition you will be disappointed.  Am I being too nitpicky? Maybe so.  I do feel I was ripped off buying it.  I felt apprhensive in the checkout line.  I wish I had followed my gut.",1363046400,23,2244,4.304556354916067
83910,5,0788832492,"Classic line. Classic flick.

The claims that this edition has been censored are generally correct. In the opening scene, where Baby Herman sticks his hand up the dress of the script girl (?), his middle finger is extended on the LaserDisk. On the Blu-ray, it's been redrawn so it isn't extended. In the scene where Jessica is thrown from the car, there are several frames on the LV in which ""something"" is visible between her legs. On the BD, these frames have been redrawn to hide or remove whatever that ""something"" is. Thanks to Paul Mular for kicking me to confirm this. (Though Toons leave paint behind when they rub against rough surfaces, and can be dissolved with a mixture of turpentine, acetone, and benzene, there is no explanation of their ontogeny. The idea that what is apparently a man-made image can reproduce is strange, to say the least. As they can move around in the human world, I guess it's not unreasonable to grant them ""reproductive rights"".)

""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (there's no question mark, as Hollywood believes question marks are an audience turn-off) is based on Gary Wolf's fantasy novel ""Who Censored Roger Rabbit?"" (""censored"" meaning ""murdered"" -- Roger is Not A Nice Toon). In Wolf's story, comic strips are created by photographging Toons. (One shudders at the thought of a Dondi Toon.) This misses the far more pregnant conceit that Toons are characters in animated films. Combining this with ""racial"" discrimination against Toons, and a ""Chinatown""-like story about the destruction of Los Angeles' trolley lines to make room for automobiles, resulted in an animated film with adult substance. It's a classic.

The three Roger Rabbit shorts are included. They've never struck me as particularly funny, but I've become quite grumpy (and perhaps a bit dopey) in my declining years.

""Roger Rabbit"" is easily the equal of anything made during Hollywood's ""Golden Age"". We finally have it in a format that does justice to its innovative visual effects.

Image & Sound Quality
--------------------------
I have both the LV and DVD of ""Roger Rabbit"". This edition looks less contrasty (probably a good thing) and a bit lighter (which will likely provoke complaints). Though in color, ""Roger Rabbit"" is stylistically film noir, but the BD isn't as atmospherically dark as we expect such films to be (and as I remember it). Excerpts in the supplemental material show a noticeably darker film. You might wish to experiment with your display's Black Level setting.

This lends credence to the belief that the people doing Disney transfers are less interested in the original looked like, than what looks good to them, or might please a newer audience. I suspect this new edition is taken from the composite negative (not a print), and no comparison was made with projection prints. (It's worth noting that Zemeckis's ""Back to the Future"" trilogy was transferred to Blu-ray from freshly struck prints -- not negatives. Clearly, Zemeckis wanted the home video to resemble the theatrical presentation as closely as possible.)

Disney seems to be paying attention to videophiles who don't want grain reduction or edge enhancement. Grain /is/ visible, but it's fine and tight. Thank you, Disney!

The DTS-HDMA 5.1 soundtrack is quite clear; I can understand more of the dialog than in previous editions. The sound has a rich, ""round"" quality, appropriate for film noir.

Supplemental Material
-------------------------
This includes running commentary with Fleischman, Zemekis, Marshal, and others; a brief ""making of"" with Fleischamn; an extended making-of; the deleted ""pig head"" sequence; and shots of how rubber figures stood in for the Toons on live-action sets. The running commentary is especially good, with a great deal of interesting material.",1363046400,7,3780,5.163398692810458

83957,5,0788832492,Who Framed Roger Rabbit is by far one of my favorite animated movies I have in my collection of comedy movies.  I gave it a 5 star rating because you can't but to laugh at the toon parts and the stupid stuff they do to make people laugh out loud.  I hadn't watched this movie is so much time past that I had actually forgotten certain parts of the movie so I enjoyed it a lot because of the memories from when I watched it before many years ago.  My viewpoint is this is a classic movie for anyone's collection of movies that they should own.  If you have yet to buy this movie you are missing out on a very funny and classic animated movie that is within the 100 best movies list of this century and I have to agree totally with that statment and list.

84019,1,0788832492,"This so-called ""anniversary edition"" has two discs (unnecessary, really) --- one for widescreen presentation, and one for full-screen.  The first disc, the full-screen,  is supposed to have ""family friendly"" features but they are not present.  There are five, mysteriously-worded options on the menu, for which ""Movie Theatre"" leads into playing the movie, one is for options (language, subtitles, etc.) and the other three (which includes ""Cartoon Studio"") are inaccessible.  The first disc is supposed to contain the three cartoon shorts that came with the movie (""Tummy Trouble,"" etc.) but they are not available.  Instead, ""Cartoon Studio"" just merely and lamely directs one to insert disk 2, and of course, they are not on that disc.  I supposed I COULD stick the disc in my computer to see if I can find the missing cartoons, but I'm so annoyed now that I would rather just get rid of the entire package.

But more than that, I keep wondering, why is this movie so popular?  It was great the way they combined live action with animation, but other than that gimmick, this movie has absolutely nothing going for it.  The ""humor"" consists of either gags that were old when I was young (and that's old) or new gags that just aren't funny.  Moreover, the character of Roger Rabbit is thoroughly unlikeable; one actually keeps hoping that he gets ""gacked"" so that he won't be heard anymore.  And ""Jessica Rabbit"" is not an anthropomophized rabbit at all, but a caricature of Rita Hayworth that's so exaggerated that she's rather annoying too.

Moreover, this is NOT a ""family picture"" or even a movie for kids --- one of the scenes at the beginning, where the villain (Christopher Lloyd) slowly murders a living toon, who was begging and pleading for mercy, by dipping him into dissolving acid, was disturbing even for an adult.

The animation, I admit, is beautiful, but even there, I founed the colors to look very pastel and washed-out; not at all as bright and vibrant as they could have been.  Considering how much this movie was built up before I saw it, this is a major, unfunny disappointment.  I ended up leaving this package downstairs in the laundry room for whoever wanted it, but I'm thinking, on second thought, I should have just broken the discs and thrown them out.  As a homage to old cartoons, it's a minor bit of fun.  As a story, it's a total wash-out, just like the colors in its cartoon parts.",1349568000,2,2417,4.771634615384615

Or, they are so eager about what they can do with the CGI and how they can ""impress"" us, they don't worry about other things they should, like acting or plot.

However, their included animation did not have the 3-D effect that Roger Rabbit did. (But I must empathize that they did what they did do extremely well - they were both older movies - and the actors interacted very well with the animated characters. Both amazing movies.)

As someone who loves art, I really appreciate the time and effort that went into making Roger Rabbit look good. (Of course, as someone who loves acting and movies, I also appreciate the acting and story that made it a good movie.) Like I said, I really like a lot of computer-animated movies, but as far as I can tell from watching the special features on those movies, the computer does most of the work. It seems like once the computer program is set up, the animator just presses some buttons and clicks the mouse. Not that that doesn't take talent, but it's a different kind of talent. Roger Rabbit is more of a traditional, actual type of art. Real people actually drew all that. Then they went in there and added shading and somehow made 2-dimensional animated characters look like they fit in with 3-dimensional actors. What skill!

Even with all the new technology we have today, 'Roger Rabbit' still surpasses them. I don't know if it's lack of really good story telling or the lack of really good actors.(Perhaps a little of both?)
Made in the 80's and set in the 40's, 'Roger Rabbit' drew you in and for a couple of hours, could make you suspend belief.  From live action to the animation, these perfect cast of actors portrayed their characters in a seamless fashion.  They actually made you believe we could interact with these animated characters; characters that we are very familiar with such as Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny and many other Looney Tunes and Disney characters.  This movie dealt with the scandals of Hollywood while cleverly mixing in genius animation, making it a classic for any one, young or old, to enjoy.
Who doesn't love that goofy Roger Rabbit, who was able to win over the gorgeous Jessica (and even the heart of that 'sour-puss', Eddie Valiant)?

84095,5,0788832492,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (hereafter WFRR) is an exhilarating example of a ""Hamlet Syndrome"" movie. I define a ""Hamlet Syndrome"" work as one that is so important, revolutionary, and/or complex that it has been endlessly analyzed from multiple perspectives, and therefore impossible to make an original comment upon. In other words, what can I say about this movie that hasn't been said before? For example, I'm sure I'm not the only poster who has seen this movie multiple times in the theater (5 times in my case). Also, many posters must own the VHS or DVD version; in fact, WFRR was my first VHS movie purchase and someday I will purchase the DVD. Like many posters, I adore the masterful, seamless, phantasmagoric merger of live action and animation. Sigh! I think I'll comment upon the main factor that, in my opinion, made WFRR such a success - its matter-of-fact, focused intelligence.

It seems strange to call the anarchic, partly animated WFRR world focused and intelligent, but it is. The dialogue is whip-smart, sizzling, and meaningful at every moment, even when a toon is speaking it. The development of the murder mystery involving the death of Acme Products's practical joker king Marvin Acme is appropriately convoluted, twisty, and elusive. The detective Eddie Valiant is still street-smart, shrewd, and clever despite his descent into alcoholism and despair over the murder of his brother (poignantly summarized by a photo montage). Likewise, his transition from enjoying to hating toons because his brother was killed by one. The implication of the goofy Roger Rabbit in Acme's murder because of his supposed dalliance with his stunning human toon wife Jessica Rabbit. The stubbornly growing relationship between Roger and his reluctant protector Eddie. The sinister machinations of the cadaverous Judge Doom. Even the toons' fantastic feats which as Roger explains can occur only if they are funny. Every aspect of the film impresses you with its intelligence, because it is smarter than its audience.

WFRR is indeed intelligent, and its intelligence extends to pleasing both kids and adults without being condescending or boring to either. Almost inevitably, this means the movie presents risqu dialogue and situations (e.g. Baby Herman's lament about his 40-year-old lust and his 3-year-old dinky, or Eddie's sometime girlfriend and speakeasy owner Delores commenting on the rabbit extending from his pocket). But the movie is agile and lighthearted enough to avoid offending anyone (unlike, say, Rango). The action, jokes, one-liners, and asides are all sharp and really require you to think.

The entire tone of WFRR is smart, too, as well as underplayed and low-key. Even when someone acts crazy, as for example in the climax when Eddie attempts to save Roger and Jessica from being immersed in the ""dip"" by...I'm not telling, it has a serious objective. Humans interact with cartoons and sometimes even enter Toontown, the toons's abode, but they never BECOME cartoons. The tone bolsters the underlying serious themes of the movie, which are not only will Roger be acquitted, but also whether Eddie will redeem himself professionally and socially. WFRR will also teach you something about '40s film noir and detective movies, if you are observant.

WFRR does something more. Its overall craft and brilliance affirms how great human beings can be, when they set their minds to something. Who would expect a collision of flesh-and-blood humans, irreverent Looney Tunes characters, and boisterous Disney characters to do that?",1302652800,,3593,5.241739130434783

84097,5,0788832492,"This great 80's classic was made in 1988 and was directed by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Steven Speilberg.  based on the novel by Gary K. Wolf ""Who Censored Roger Rabbit?"", ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is a movie about live action cartoons living in a 3d world with us, and work and star in cartoons and movies instead of being drawn.  Roger Rabbit(Charles Fleischer) is a crazy, fun-loving rabbit who as an amazingly attractive wife Jessica Rabbit(Kathleen Turner).  When Jessica is suspected of having an affair, R.K. Maroon, the owner of the cartoon studio, hires Eddie Valiant(Bob Hoskins) to take some pictures of Jessica ""cheating"" on Roger with Marvin Acme, the owner of toon town, where all the toons live.

When Roger finds out, he goes crazy and runs away, so the next morning when Acme winds up dead, Roger is the prime suspect, and the evil Judge Doom(Christopher Lloyd), who has created a way to kill toons for good by dipping them in an acid-like substance called ""The Dip.""  So it's up to Eddie Valiant to prove Roger's innocence.

This movie is great for kids and adults as it has cartoons and funny gimmicks in the movie that will be great for kids, as well as some adult humor.  Which is probably why it received so much praise at the box office.  Many movies combine live-action and animation but this one perfected it.  No movie since has been able to replicate the finesse of making it seem as the animation really ties in so well with the live-action.  It included some very famous cartoon characters interacting with each other that no one had ever seen before and has never seen ever since.  For example, there is a scene where Eddie is sitting at a show watching Daffy Duck and Donald Duck playing pianos together and fighting with each other.  Or later in the movie, where Eddie is falling off a building and Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny show up to talk with him.  It was very groundbreaking for its time.

The movie received much financial success at the box office and went on to win 4 academy awards, and is one of the most expensive animated films ever made, with a budget of $70 Million.  It's a cult classic that left a huge impact on our culture.  There was also talk of an unproduced prequel, ""Who Discoverd Roger Rabbit"".

84098,3,0788832492,"I have mixed feelings about Walt Disney Pictures' and Steven Spielberg's first (and so far only) collaboration ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" First off, it was a good movie; funny and entertaining. BUT did it have to be full of sexual innuendo and strong profanity (one use each of ""Bastard"" and ""S.O.B."") which are not associated with Disney? I didn't like Baby Herman in this movie. did he have to be so crass, especially in the scene in the hallway (smacking his sexy mommy on the rear and saying, ""I got a 50 year-old lust and a three year-old dinky"")? And what was that gag about prostate & probate? Totally NOT Disney material. GREAT SCOTT!!! What in the Space Time Continuum is Doc Brown doing in this future?!!!  Could have been released as a Disney movie without the innuendo and strong profanity. ""The Rocketeer"" should have also been released via Touchstone Pictures, as it had a strong profanity and innuendo. Rated PG, but should have been rated PG-13. Walt Disney himself would be ashamed of this movie.

Walt Disney Pictures isn't known for making this type of movie, so thankfully it was released via Touchstone Pictures. Nor is Steven Spielberg known for making junk like this. Former Disney head Michael Eisner was smart to release this under the Touchstone Pictures' banner, but why were Walt Disney Pictures and Steven Spielberg still involved after they read the script?

84123,5,0788832492,"The movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit is famous for many reasons : It was a film that combined actors with cartoon characters. It featured Disney icons alongside their Warner Brothers counterparts.

But Roger Rabbit is perhaps equally as infamous for the racy urban legends surrounding the film.

When Jessica is riding a taxi through Toon Town with Bob Hoskins, the taxi crashes into a lamppost, sending both of them flying out of the car. Jessica lands spinning and her dress begins hiking up her body. Hidden in just a few frames--in other words, unnoticeable while playing the movie in its normal speed--Jessica's underwear seems to disappear, briefly leaving her exposed.

Was this an error in the coloring process, or was this a gag perpetrated by an animator working on the film? No one can say for sure, kids. This one stays a mystery.

Another rumor surrounding Roger Rabbit that has yet to be substantiated concerns Disney CEO Michael Eisner.

In the scene where Bob Hoskins goes into a bathroom in Toon Town, graffiti on the wall reads : ""For a good time, call Allyson Wonderland... ""The Best Is Yet to Be."" The second phrase was supposedly replaced with Eisner's phone number in a single frame. But this did not show up in the laser-disc version of the film, and may have only been hidden in the theatrical version.

The only Urban Legend in Roger Rabbit that can actually be validated is a scene in which Baby Herman walks off of the set and sticks his middle finger up in the air just before going underneath a woman's dress. Herman then emerges with a spot of drool on his upper lip.  Hmm... What could he have been doing?",1280707200,3,1633,4.668989547038327

From the best of my knowledge, Space Jam and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? have held up all these years. But before there was Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny, there was Bob Hoskins and Roger Rabbit. This is a dark, silly, and extremely fun film with a whole lot of humor and a whole lot of (cartoonish) action. The special effects are especially top-notch, and none of it looks dated. The cartoon characters look authentic, as if they're actually there onscreen with the real actors. Christopher Lloyd is dead-on as Judge Doom, while Bob Hoskins delivers the goods as Eddie Valiant. Charles Fleischer has the right voice for Roger Rabbit, while Jessica Rabbit look nice as Roger's girlfriend (even though I think that she's not very attractive as a cartoon woman).

If you're looking for a deep, thought-provoking film, then this is not the perfect choice. What it is, however, is a wildly fun movie with lots of brilliant effects and perfectly-timed humor. I wouldn't necessarily say that it's for really small kids, but hey, it's good for the rest of us.

Roger Rabbit was one of the great eye candy surprises of my life when I saw it in the theatre in '88; it truly deserves to be seen on a big screen. Soooo, it really needs a great blu-ray transfer. Hello, Bob Zemeckis and studio...

One thing many fans of this film miss is that it is in fact a very cleverly-disguised conspiracy film; if you know anything about the history of L.A. and its streetcars, etc, you know what I mean. Won't say more for those who haven't seen it yet.

But no one misses how perfectly constructed the script and plot are, and how fine Hoskins and Lloyd are in bringing it all to life. Hoskins's work is even more impressive when you watch the extra that shows him acting to the blank bluescreen; the guy hits his marks like a true pro, and his believable conversations with the toons are some amazing acting in every way. The man has imagination!

As did the makers of this gem. It's all about Bugs Bunny and friends, of course, and they could never make this now; they got rights to use almost every old toon, and they never would these days, so rejoice that corporate greed was only halfway home in the late 80s (and we thought then it could never get worse, hoho!). Seeing all these characters together only brings home what fabulous art the classic toon makers created. This is made for adults, but kids can watch it with much joy as well. It's both very funny and very clean, no mean feat.

The mixed live action/toons are done to near-perfection, and the way the toons slide around the screen adds to the feeling. The first time you see this is a real trip; be prepared and watch it on a big screen if you can.

There are some extras here, and they're not bad, but what really matters is we get to see the letterboxed original version, which really matters in a film shot with this much love and care.

A true work of art in most every way, the Wabbit deserves a perfect blu-ray transfer, with tons of new extras!!",1265587200,,1958,4.333333333333333

Come on, you had Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse together falling from the sky!

You had Donald and Daffy Duck together playing piano in some theater!

You had Roger Rabbit himself who was fantastic because he was so entertaining and had you laughing constantly.

Most importantly, you had reality and cartoons combined and it looked totally believable like the real people were actually communicating with the cartoon characters.  Come on, back in the late 80's many people (children and adults) were a bit surprised film directors were able to pull off something like this.  It was bizarre, it was unique, and the movie is quite entertaining as a result and worth watching several times over.  This movie was a huge step forward for film directors and I'd say it was a pretty big influence on todays films.

Along with the Back to the Future movies, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the greatest movies at the time, and honestly the film still holds up and looks remarkable today.

What's interesting is that I'm defending a movie that I honestly HATED when it first came out, but the reason I hated it was because I was a child in the late 80's and expected nothing but a cartoon from beginning to end.  Now I understand the appeal.

The ONLY problem with this film is that the final 20 minutes get insanely whacky to the point it's somewhat hard to follow.  A remarkable film, and a classic future generations of children and adults must watch at least once.

84185,5,0788832492,"I have very fond memories of sneaking downstairs late at night as a young child and snuggling up with my big sisters on the couch to watch `Who Framed Roger Rabbit'.  I was merely five or so at the time, but I can still remember it quite vividly.  Each and every time I watch this wonderful movie I get that same sense of calming comfort that I had resting in their arms.

That's what movies are all about, right?

`Who Framed Roger Rabbit' was a total breakthrough at the time it was released, and it serves today as the foundation for the perfect family feature.  The combination of live action and animation has been achieved since, and even before, but in my opinion it has never been achieved with this same sense of perfection.

`Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is unlike any movie you've ever seen.

The film tells the story of Eddie Valiant, a detective who abhors toons after one killed his brother.  He used to be a defender of the toons, now he despises them.  He's hired to follow around Jessica Rabbit, the wife of toon star Roger Rabbit.  He uncovers a secret that may or may not have led Roger to kill a man.  Roger of course claims innocence and pleads with Eddie to help him clear his name.  Hiding from the sinister Judge Doom, Eddie and Roger embark on a perilous adventure to uncover the truth behind this grisly crime.

I adore Hoskins.  He's just such a naturally charming acting, his gruff exterior included.  He fits into this role so wonderfully, giving the right amount of feeling to his character in order to make him real and not a walking caricature.  This could have been nothing more than a campy film, but it isn't campy at all.  Christopher Lloyd is his usual zany self, and he fits the role beautifully.  The voice work done (mostly by Charles Fleischer) is also spot on perfect.

`Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is the definition of a movie experience.  It is smartly written film and it is masterfully directed by Robert Zemeckis who balances the dark live action underworld with the crisp animated world brilliantly.  This film is deliciousness to the eyes, most definitely, but it never substitutes glamour for brains.  The film never once insults our intelligence.

Gee... What can I say?

What can be said that hasn't been said a zillion times about this movie before? By film critics, film buffs, the other user posters on IMDb and every other person who saw this one?

But you know what? I'm not here to really promote this movie, or analyze it... I'm here to write my love letter for it. We're all here to share our movie-going experiences, aren't we? Well, [...], here's mine.

I still remember being a little prepubescent boy sitting in the theater watching this movie, totally amazed and astounded by what I saw. Seeing this wacky cartoons going through a routine Tom-and-Jerry-type episode... and then... it was amazing how these movie actually tricked you, convinced you to believe that human and cartoons can exist in the same universe and dimension of reality.

There are many a great pleasures and moments in this movie, one of them is the duet at a ""toon"" night club called ""The Ink & Paint Club"" where Eddie goes to get information about Roger's wife, and the opening act is a dueling duet on the piano featuring two great legends, Daffy Duck and Donald Duck (I doubt there's any biological relation there) together at last. Why did it take so long for these two to get together? Well, they are rival entertainers for rival studios, so...

But of course, the dueling duet ends in an all-out war. Come on, we both know the hatchet wasn't going to stay buried very long.

The whole movie is worth renting just to see the two great legends, Daffy and Donald, put their differences aside for one memorable dueling piano duet ALONE.

""Roger Rabbit"" pioneered not only animation and film-making style, but acting, writing, directing and a meshing together of different genres.

Imagination, luck, brilliance, skill... it's all been blended so perfectly here... just like the animation and live-action.

Funny, sharp, satirical, smart, thrilling, skillful, bright, bold, hard-boiled, colorful... at even at times, a little scary.

It one three Oscars, not to mention an Honorary Award for it's Technical Advancements.

Hell, it deserved every single Oscar it got! And a few it didn't. It should've won every single Oscar that year. Maybe some from others...

God, you know, I still remember finding my little Rescue Ranger toy in my pocket and running in back-and-forth through my fingers... I remember being very careful not to loose it as I watched this. And it was hard, damn it, all of what was going up there on the screen.

There's the best of the everything here. Everyone should see it, pure and simple. It's a movie... for pretty much everybody. A masterpiece in more ways than one.

So help me God, I cannot think of a better actor for the role of the classic, hard-boiled, rock-bottom, not-too-smooth P.I. than Bob Hoskins. I don't think he's ever played a better role in his whole life. He seems to be a strange collision of Sam Spade and W.C. Fields, in some strange way.

Christopher Lloyd proves yet again (as he does in all his roles) that he's one of the most underrated actors in the business. He's known for playing the bizarre, the crazy, the wired. But his ability to play villains, particularly more sedate and low-key ones, is overlooked so much, it's grounds for a discrimination lawsuit.

Kathleen Turner is damn perfect as Roger's Mrs; especially considering that all she does here is a voice.

Roger Rabbit"" pioneered not only animation and film-making style, but acting, writing, directing and a meshing together of different genres. Literature purists and scholars (yes, I mean geeks) will note that this movie is adapted from a novel by Gary K. Wolf, who specializes in science-fiction.

For those of you who are enamored with this movie and just learning this, are actively considering dropping this review right this instant and running to your nearest library and bookstore to pick up a copy to read as an addition to the movie or just out of curiosity, I should warn you that the movie is completely unfaithful to the novel.

Oh, both are clever and well-written spoofs of the whole ""hard-boiled private-detective mystery noir genre,"" but the two are so completely different, in writing-style, character dialouge, plot, theme, even ending, you wonder why they even bothered to get Wolf's permission and pay him a royalty. Gee, usually these Hollywood types are a little more snaky and know how to exploit all these loopholes.

You've no doubt heard the old saying, ""You can't please everyone, so don't even bother."" Because when you try, you wind up ultimately pleasing no one. Least of all, yourself. It's strange, this movie seems like an exception to that one little rule. I mean, I know there's an exception to every rule, but this is one you're sure is completely iron-clad. This is a movie for everyone. This is a movie that will please everyone. And you know what else? It never got the credit for that. Think about what a big train-wreck this movie could have been. How many things could have gone wrong.

How many years Disney and Warner have been at war, all this time, money for a experiment that could have gone worse than than the killer bees and the atomic bomb. And yet, glory be, it didn't. We all live for days like this, filmmakers, film critics... and film lovers.

The best part? After it was all over... Roger and Baby Herman went on to star in several of their own cartoon shorts before the movie for real (""Dick Tracy"" and ""Honey, I Shrunk The Kids"").

Good for them.

84230,5,0788832492,"""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is one of the most important milestones in movie history.  The first thing that blew me away was the unprecedented coorporation of the two biggest rivals in animation, Disney and Warner Brothers.  Until this movie came out, no one but no one ever dared to dream that Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse would appear in the same frames.  Also included were characters from Max Fleischer (Betty Boop), Walter Lantz (Woody Woodpecker) and others.  Great technical strides had been taken since Jerry Mouse danced with Gene Kelly.  The interaction between live and animated characters was convincing and lifelike all the way through the movie.  The film was loaded with innuendos and inside jokes, which only added to the pleasure of watching it.  I thought the casting was perfect, too.  Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom was spot-on.  If I could give this movie seven stars, I would.
  Now about the DVD format itself.  The clarity of transfer is outstanding.  However I do have one little beef about the formatting of the menu.  I would have greatly preferred being able to go straight to a menu instead of having to wait for Benny the cab to go all over the place and then having to go three layers deep before being able to select from the menu.  That old rather fast.  I'm not going to knock off a star for that, though.  On its own the formatting would be two stars out of five.

However, the character of Roger is WAY too silly, stupid, and lacking in appeal for me. Imagine Jerry Lewis as a cartoon rabbit and you get the idea. A bit overdone in that aspect. But the business with Jessica Rabbit is amusing as well as the Robert Hoskins character (who interacts quite well with the cartoons-no mean feat for an actor).

It contains a solid plot, excellent acting, smart script, fantastic visuals, and an abundance of your favorite LOONEY toons!

Do expect plenty of laughs and the wonderful added mystery and suspense!

From its plot, a brilliant homage to the great film noir thrillers of the 1940s', to the fantastic visuals, still impressive even today, to its smart, funny, fast paced script, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is a truly timeless piece of cinema.

Taking place in 1947, Detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is a hard boiled Hollywood private eye haunted by his past. He has gone from a well respected cop, to a brutal, booze swilling drunk. When Marvin Acme, owner of Acme Gag Factory and head of Toontown, is murdered, the prime suspect is Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer), Toontown's most famous star. Desparate to prove his innocence, Roger enlists Valiant for help, and manages to drive Valiant nuts. This doesn't sit well with the power hungry Judge Doom (a frighteningly brilliant Christopher Lloyd), who is intent on bringing Roger to justice. As Roger's innocence becomes more apparent, so does Doom's plot to destroy Toontown and turn it into a freeway (an homage to ""Chinatown""). It is up to Valiant and Roger to save Toontown from total chaos. Not that these two are working alone: Valiant's on again, off again gal Dolores (Joanna Cassidy) helps out, and then of course their's Roger's mindbustingly sexy wife, Jessica (voiced like no other by Kathleen Turner, who imbues the character with such a vibrant amount of sex appeal that once can't help but fall in love with her, despite the fact that she's a cartoon).

As I said, this is an absolutely brilliant piece of cinema, and it now looks even better on this special edition dvd, which is loaded with two discs worth of bonus features as well as superb picture and sound remastering job.

For example, the Toons have shadows, and when one is thrown against a venetian blind, it bends and makes the sound of somebody actually hitting a venetian blind.  The interaction between live action and animation is so good, you quickly forget they're not really together at all -- and much of the credit for such realistic ""interaction"" must go to live actor Bob Hoskins.  There are a load of extras in this 2-disc package, including both fullscreen and widescreen versions, audio commentary, a deleted scene, and a very interesting ""before and after"" split-screen comparison with and without animation.

84290,5,0788832492,"This has got to be my favorite movie of all time. It's got music, it's got murders, and most importantly of all, it's got TOONS!!!!!!!!! Everything a movie should have. Robert Zemeckis is a well-acclaimed director who's done films like Back to the Future and the ""newly-released"" Polar Express, (but those are completely different reviews... all of which should be very good). Bob Hoskins is hilarious and makes the movie seem realistic. (He's somewhat of a ""Scrooge"" character). Christopher Llyod is great as he portrays the villain, Judge Doom. (I like that the original concept was that he was the guy who shot Bambi's mother). Though all the actors gave a splendid performance, Charles Fleisher (the voice of Roger Rabbit) was the best. He even wore a rabbit suit on set of the film. I'm also amazed at the wonderful effect of putting toons and actors together in the same frame. (I guess that's why, ""Roger Rabbit"" has won an academy award.) Probably never again will anyone see Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, and Donald Duck in the same frame together. Everyone who hasn't seen this should go watch the flick right now. They can last for 104 minutes. The DVD is also worthwhile, too. There are Roger Rabbit shorts that were originally seen in theaters and an interactive game in which you save Toontown. It was considered that there would be a sequel to ""Roger Rabbit""; one that would go directly to video and DVD. If a sequel was made, I'm sure it would be great. In the words of the sexy Jessica Rabbit, ""Why Don't You Do Right"" and Zemeckis surely has done right in making this a periodic, memorable movie. It has secured a place in film history.",1135641600,4,1662,4.695205479452055

Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Back to the Future) and stars Bob Hoskins

as Eddie Valiant, a private eye who hates toons after one killed his brother. Anyway, Eddie is hired to take pictures of Jessica Rabbit in order to stir some jealousy in Roger Rabbit which will get him to perform better in a movie that he's working on. After Eddie takes the pictures of Jessica with Marvin Acme; Acme turns up dead and the first suspect is Roger. Well, Roger asks Eddie to protect him from the toon-killing Judge Doom (a virtually unrecognizable Christopher Lloyd) and unwittingly Eddie does. The movie is not only well done (animation and such), but it's actually pretty entertaining and funny. A-",1133136000,3,914,4.967320261437909

Donald Duck and Daffy Duck fighting each other just to show off who's better (Favorite Scene). Betty Boop, Dumbo, Yosemite Sam, Droopy, Mickey and Bugs share a scene (A first with these 2 legends.) Also this is one of the last perfomances of Mel Blanc (The voices of the Looney Tunes). The Movie is very high tech for it's time. This is one of the most funniest and greatest movies of all time.

84294,5,0788832492,"Sometimes digital groundbreaking images get in the way of artistry and actually creating good art. Robert Zemeckis is a director who's similar to James Cameron and George Lucas as they try to incorporate new film techniques into their films. George Lucas oddly enough has great visuals but bad films(except Episode 3) while Cameron and Zemeckis make good films that still are visually great. Add Roger Rabbit to the list of not only groundbreaking films but good films overall.

It's the late 40's and animated characters are not drawn, they actually exist side-by-side with humans. Well Eddie Valiant used to be a private detective who specialized in toons until one killed his brother so now he's on all-toon hating rampage. R.K Maroon, owner of Maroon Cartoons wants to use Eddie to take pictures of Jessica Rabbit's infidelity, who's husband is also Maroon Studios big star, Roger Rabbit. After photographing them play pattycake(the actually clapping game that is), Roger gets upset. Then he's a suspect when Marvin Acme, the other pattycake and owner of Toontown as well as behind the same company Wile E. Coyote uses to get that Roadrunner.

So Valiant becomes a reluctant of Roger when he's being hunted by Judge Doom and trying to solve the mystery of not only who killed Marvin Acme but why and what's it got to do with not only Roger but R.K Maroon and a odd company called Cloverleaf. Also on the hunt for Roger is weasels, kind of like Judge Doom's cronies.

This film not only looks great(although real-life/animation combo shots look a bit off such as when a character is holding a cartoon) it's actually a really great film period. I still feel sorry for that shoe that has the unfortunate luck of being near Judge Doom and there's many funny lines (""nose? that doesn't rhyme with walls! no, but this does <kicks him in the....yep, those>). The fact that the animation never calls attention to itself is a testament to the film.

This film is very much like a guess that cartoon as there's so many characters, even obscure ones. I saw Jose from the Three Cabelleros, that kid from Boy Who Cried Wolf, that hippo from a Fantasia segment and faves like Yosemite Sam and Dumbo. Original characters are great such as Roger himself and my favorite weasel Psycho(time to kill the rabbit! hee hee!)

Besides the Back to the Future trilogy, this is probably one of Zemeckis' best films. Cast Away went nowhere while Death Becomes Her wasn't that interesting. Forrest Gump was good but best picture? Pssh. For best film, go all the way to Roger Rabbit.",1131580800,,2558,4.804545454545455
84295,2,0788832492,"This movie introduced and was focused on a new animated character Roger Rabbit.  However, the selling point of this movie was the inclusion of tons of characters from previously competing cartoon franchises.

The movie was much more a display of the Disney Company flexing its muscles in regards to it's business-level victory over its competition and to show its current financial dominance over the various animation companies from animation's Golden Age.

So we have Daffy Duck in piano playing competition on the same screen with Donald Duck!  What makes this extremely annoying is taking characters such as Daffy with such an established rich history of character development.  Here in Roger Rabbit, Daffy is just a ""daffy duck"" playing a piano.  My expectations were to see DAFFY DUCK playing a piano along with all that that implies.  WFRR's daffy duck was similar to the early black and white Daffy Duck during the Leon Schlesinger time of Looney Tunes.  I certainly enjoy the Looney Tunes of Schlesinger's era but it certainly does not represent the rich character that Daffy developed into.  And even then Daffy still had more personality then just being 'daffy' as presented here.

We also have my all-time favorite cartoon character Droopy being poorly drawn not at all faithful to Tex Avery's character just appearing for a second in a stupid cameo to give a line that was presented in a way also unfaithful to Droopy's established personality.

We have a slew of these cameos from Betty Boop, Woody Woodpecker, Mighty Mouse, etc.  None of which showed any respect to these characters but were obviously Disney showing its financial might in having the rights to use these characters.

Not that WFRR didn't do the same with Disney characters.  Not being a big fan of Disney animation, I didn't mind as much.

I guess I can consider the possibility that WFRR did not mean to purposefully sell the borrowed characters short.  It shows a difference in the focus of the different cartoon franchises.  Disney animation focuses much more on story and technical artistry of the features.

In contrast to Disney was Warner Brothers and MGM.  While the artistry was superior to Disney it was in a less intricate and focused on style instead of technically grand design of Disney.  However, the most dividing difference in Disney and WB/MGM animation was Disney showed little interest in establishing characters.  WB/MGM were almost entirely focused on making characters.

In other words, Disney character's personalities were designed to serve the story.  WB/MGM's stories were designed to serve the characters.

That is where WFRR offends, we have all these great characters just appearing randomly at best but usually contrary to character.

This movie really should have had only the Roger Rabbit story in it.  It really wasn't that bad.  In fact, it was good. The animation was fine.  The story was funny and enhanced by the gags (only the ones by WFRR original characters).

As for Roger Rabbit himself, he's made for this movie which is fine.  But he's not a character that is interesting in himself outside of his place in this movie.  Nothing wrong with that.  It would have been an enjoyable movie if left at that.

The poor treatment of classic characters really caused me to dislike this film.",1131148800,7,3308,4.989031078610603

84311,4,0788832492,"If you haven't seen it, this is a brilliant merger of live-actors and animated characters. Oh, it's been done before, all the way back to the 1930s or -40s, but never so well. The animated figures don't just talk to the live actors and cast shadows, they open doors, bump into things, and visibly press against the actors they are supposed to be touching. Just a few minutes in, disbelief is thoroughly suspended. The technical achievement sinks into the background (as it should), and the plot moves on.

The story's a good one, too. There are lots of ins and outs, a complex land grab, a personal tragedy, and loyalties that surface under pressure. It's kid-safe and -comprehensible, but has enough to keep an adult interested.

Not least is the remarkable legal feat of combining dozens of cartoon characters, with copyrights owned by competing studios. Disney, Warner Bros, and Hanna Barbera all contributed. Who ever expected to see Daffy Duck across from Donald? Bugs across from Mickey? Even minor characters appeared, like animated extras from Fantasia, Peter (of wolf fame), and the dragon from Disney's 1941 adaptation of Grahame's book, ""The Reluctant Dragon"". Of course, Roger, his wife Jessica (""I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way""), and lots of other `toons all came to life exclusively for this movie.

It's not necessary to have kids in order to have a collection of kids' movies. This one's great for the kid in anybody.

84313,5,0788832492,"There have been many movies and television shows that have tried to replicate the premise of 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit, yet even the most recent attempts have, for the most part, failed (although Greg the Bunny came pretty close).  In the world of WFRR, cartoons, or just toons for short, are real.  They live among us, and act in their own movies and cartoons.  They just happen to be animated.  For the most part, the whole point of being a toon is to make people laugh, and many of them excel at it.

Dateline: Hollywood, 1947.  Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is a down-and-out private investigator who has become a drunk grouch ever since the death of his brother and partner, Teddy.  The pair specialized in toon cases (they cleared Goofy of espionnage charges), and frequented Toontown, an animated city that was home to the toons.  That is until a deranged toon killed Teddy and left Eddie for dead.  Now, Eddie can barely find work, and spends most of his time drinking.  Roger Rabbit (Charles Fleisher) is an up-and-coming toon, the new star of Maroon Cartoons shorts.  Although lately, he has been having trouble with his lines.  Studio boss R.K. Maroon (Alan Tilvern) believes that it is the fault of Roger's wife Jessica (Kathleen Turner/Amy Irving), a stunning redhead whom Maroon believes is cheating on her husband.  Maroon hires Eddie to trail Jessica and take pictures incriminating her.  It turns out that Jessica is doing something outside of her marriage (though not what you'd think) with Maroon's buddy Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye), the CEO of the company that makes all of those gadgets that Wile E. Coyote tries to use against the Road Runner.  When Roger finds out, he is heartbroken, and the next day, Acme is found murdered.  Immediately, Roger is blamed, and the man with jurisdiction over Toontown, Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) is set to execute Roger without even a trial.  His new invention, dip (comprised of turpentine, acetone, and benzene), is the only proven way to actually kill a toon, and he has no qualms about using it on Roger.

Roger claims that he is innocent, and begs Eddie to help him out.  He originally declines, but he is eventually drawn into the case.  And what seems like a simple frame job continues to unfold as more and more clues point in new directions.

For what may be seen as a kids' movie (which it definitely isn't), there is a complex story, interesting character development, and good dialogue.  Also, the special effects are superb, espcecially considering that this movie was made in 1988.  The toons are integrated nearly seamlessly into the real world and vice versa.  Also, this is probably the ONLY time anyone will ever see Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny interacting with each other.  There were probably loads of conditions that had to be met by both Disney and Warner Bros. to make that happen, and due to studio politics, will probably never happen again.

Overall, this is a great movie that is a testament to the talents of director Robert Zemeckis (who also directed Back to the Future and Castaway) as well as the effects team.  We will probably never get another movie like this.",1119830400,,3157,4.787430683918669

84315,5,0788832492,"First off, allow me to correct a common mistake that was made by more than one reviewer here: This is most certainly not the first film ever made where animated characters interact with live actors. Pete's Dragon (1977), Mary Poppins (1964) and Song of the South (1946) all predate it, and if you want a lesson in cartoon history, so does Gertie the Dinosaur (1914). But that doesn't mean Who Framed Roger Rabbit is not a landmark film. It was revolutionary for its degree of interaction between the toons and the human characters, done so perfectly that they seem completely natural at first glance, but then amaze when you take a closer look - little things like Jessica Rabbit pinching Eddie Valiant's cheek, or Roger Rabbit hiding under the water in Valiant's sink, or beneath his coat, little details that took very creative special effects to be made convincing. It's also unique and original in the fact that some of it takes place in the real world, featuring animated characters, and some in an animated world, featuring live actors; and in that manner, it predates Cool World, Space Jam and anything following.

Who Framed Roger Rabbit is wonderfully funny, directed more at an adult audience than children. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd make a terrific impression in the lead roles, and manage to stay remarkably serious and convincing while conversing and interacting with entirely imaginary characters. Charles Fleischer is beyond brilliant in the voice of Roger Rabbit (as well as that of Benny the Cab) and Kathleen Turner as Jessica Rabbit is also terrific, a femme fatale so classic that it's ridiculous. The entire film excels with intelligent humor that would appeal to both children and adults, and it's a treat for animation buffs, with references to historical toons from the Foxy cartoons of the 20s, through Betty Boop, Dumbo and Bambi to Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse.

Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the defining films of my childhood; I think that's true for almost anyone born in the 80s. I still have a warm place in my heart for Roger and Eddie Valiant, and a cold one for Judge Doom, who gave me nightmares for weeks after I saw it upon its initial release when I was four (he still gives me chills, by the way, when he first starts talking in his squeaky voice).

I am sure I saw it many times as a kid, but never saw it as the genius piece of filmmaking that it is. This movie is brilliant in every way, and with the release of the Vista Series DVD I have been reacquainted with it. I am 20 years old now and this is one of my top 5 favorite movies. That is the great thing about this movie, that all ages can enjoy something that this has to offer whether it be the animation sequences or just the fun storyline. I love both.
Here is the story. Someone has killed Marvin Acme, owner of ToonTown and Roger takes the heat for it. Of course he was framed but by who and why? Roger seeks the help of Eddie Valiant, a once prominant detective that fell into hard times after his brother was killed by a toon. Thus was his reluctance to help Roger since he was a toon. But he does help Roger, and he must get to the bottom of the mystery before Judge Doom finds and kills Roger by ""dipping him"". Eddie feels sorry for the rabbit so he investigates before it is too late, and along the way he discovers more and more about why Acme was killed and that ToonTown itself is in danger. Oh yeah, and Roger was the perfect one to frame because his wife Jessica Rabbit had been seen meeting with Acme before he died. So most people probably know the plot already, but if not it is highly original and entertaining.
This masterpiece couldn't get any better treatment than this, a fully loaded 2 disc set sporting both a family-friendly version on disc 1 and enthusiast version on disc 2. There are so many extras that it will take you a long time to see everything. I admittedly have just begun to see the treasures contained within.

It is sheer movie magic, and something I could watch all the time and never get tired of seeing it. Director Zimeckis has done a remarkable job with this film, and we also great great performances from Bob Hoskins (Eddie Valiant), Christopher Lloyd (Judge doom) and pretty much everyone else appearing in the film with the addition of the voices of Roger and Jessica who were terrific.

84340,5,0788832492,"More than 15 years after its initial theatrical release, in this era when computer-generated animation and CG special FX are the mandatory norm, 1988's WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT still stands firm as a groundbreaking, awe-inspiring, and wonderfully entertaining cinematic tour de force.  In technical terms, it is the first film to convincingly combine living actors and animated cartoon characters in the same frame and make it look convincing.  Thematically, it is a spoof of the noir films of the 1940s and 1950s, a slapstick comedy, and a satire of pre-civil-rights racial relations all rolled into one, sometimes referred to as the first genuine ""cartoon noir.""
Based on the novel WHO CENSORED ROGER RABBIT? by Gary K. Wolf, the script by Jeffrey Price & Peter S. Seaman appropriately replaces Wolf's comic-book and newspaper-strip cartoons with more cinematic animated cartoon characters, but it retains the novel's satiric sociological subtext.  The film is set in an alternate-universe Hollywood of the 1940s where cartoon characters (colloquially referred to as ""toons"") live and breathe and interact with flesh-and-blood humans.  The toons are the social minority, and as with the minorities of the real-world U.S.A. during the early 20th century, they are given employment only as menial service workers or as entertainers, and for housing they are relegated to a Harlem-like ghetto (known in the film as Toontown).
The story itself follows hard-boiled gumshoe Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) as he tries to uncover evidence that will exonerate zany toon Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) of a murder rap.  Roger became the #1 suspect in the recent murder of Marvin Acme after it was discovered that the famous and wealthy gag-prop mogul had been rendezvousing secretly with Roger's sexy wife, Jessica Rabbit (voiced by an uncredited Kathleen Turner), and playing patty-cake with her.  Though Valiant once vowed never to work for a toon again after one murdered his brother, the cynical ol' sleuth turns out to be a bit sentimental and, feeling sorry for the funny bunny, takes Roger's case anyway.  But as the gushy gumshoe snoops for clues, he learns that there is more to Acme's murder than just a ploy to frame Roger; he uncovers a conspiracy that could lead to the demise of Toontown and its inhabitants!
Alternately hilarious and suspenseful, WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT is replete with the kinds of throwaway gags, inside jokes, and one-liners that audiences would expect to see in an old-time cartoon short, while at the same time it unfolds into an intelligent who-done-it mystery worthy of Bogart's Sam Spade.  WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT represents the apex of 20th century filmmaking, but it is also wholesome family entertainment that offers something for kiddos and adults alike.  This one will still be enjoyed by audiences of all ages long after it becomes an icon in the history books.
As mentioned before, WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT offers the most convincing mix of live-action performers and hand-drawn animation ever put to celluloid.  While this is certainly due in part to the awesome skill and artistry with which the animators have inserted the cartoon characters, excellent performances from the ""live"" cast members--particularly Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd--also help to sell the illusion of realism.  Instead of cartoonishly overacting, overREacting, or pushing their performances too far over the top, the actors adopt a natural, matter-of-fact posture towards the cartoons, and this makes the audience believe that the human characters interact with animated critters on a daily basis.
The two-disc ""Vista Series"" DVD set from Disney Home Video is the definitive home-theater edition of the wonderful film.  Not only does it offer a pristine restored & remastered anamorphic widescreen transfer of WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT (by the way, there's also a pan-and-scan version), there are tons of interesting and fun bonus features.  These include a really entertaining feature commentary with director Zemeckis, the screenwriters, and other crew members; a making-of featurette; three Roger Rabbit cartoon shorts that played in theaters before OTHER films (just like in the old days, folks); a deleted scene; and lots more!
The DVD collection of any serious film enthusiast will certainly contain a copy of this ""cartoon noir"" fantasy.  This is a must-own DVD of a must-own film!",1083196800,5,4408,5.296561604584527

The DVD offers the fan everything that he/she wants to know about the making of the movie.
The only complaint that I could register would be in the first disc's compilation of the three theatrical Roger Rabbit ""shorts"". Viewing them back to back reveals their shortcomings. While it is obvious that Zemeckis and company were paying homage to the great Tex Avery 'toons of the thirties, forties, and fifties, these newer films lacked Avery's brilliant over-the-top ""bite."" Avery had a lunacy unlike any other director of animated films and he couldn't be imitated.

The ""Trouble in Toontown"" Game
Audio Commentary with the filmakers
""Toontown Confidential""  an intriquing  & hilarious facts and trivia viewing option

The Vista Series Edition of Roger Rabbit was a delight and I'm happy with this purchase.

84369,5,0788832492,"This DVD set is sure to please anyone who enjoyed the ambitious, innovative and hilarious movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit. In 1988, Roger Rabbit earned several Oscars, combined animation with live action, made British actor Bob Hoskins a star and featured cameos from dozens of Disney, Warner Bros, MGM and Universal cartoon stars.  Director Robert Zemeckis would also direct the Back to the Future series.
The story takes place in 1947 and it all begins with the lovable goofball Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) co-starring with the cute but not-so-innocent Baby Herman (offstage, Herman is a whiney, scowling cigar smoking midget) in What's Cookin'.  It's not long before Roger is under investigation by hapless no-nonsense detective Eddie Valiant (Hoskins).  Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye), owner of Toontown, has been murdered.  Judge Doom (Back to the Future and Taxi's Christopher Lloyd) and his pack of scheming weasels suspect Roger is the culprit, particularly after Acme plays a game of patty-cake with Roger's sultry wife, Jessica (Kathleen Turner).  Jessica's defense: ""I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way!""  Roger, Jessica and Valiant do their best to prove Roger's innocence and save the fate of Toontown.  Benny the wisecrackin' Cab is there to help Valiant get to the bottom of it all.  Cameos include Daffy and Donald Duck, Bugs Bunny (voiced by the late Mel Blanc), Yosemite Sam, Mickey Mouse, Tweety, Droopy Dog, Betty Boop (with the original voice of Mae Questel) and many others.  The musical score is composed by Alan Silvestri (Forrest Gump, Lilo and Stitch).
Now for the extras.  There is a spoken commentary as well as a ""pop-up video"" style commentary on the picture, outtakes including the ""pig head"" sequence, information on before/after animation, a DVD game Trouble in Toontown, options of widescreen and fullscreen, and (if you're bi-lingual) dubbed in versions in French and Spanish.
Finally, it includes 3 Roger Rabbit short films, including Tummy Trouble (where Baby Herman swallows everything), Rollercoaster Rabbit (where Roger babysits Herman in an amusement park; my favourite of the 3) and Trail Mix-Up (where Roger takes Herman camping around Yellowstone Park; watch for Jessica's cameos in all of these!).
Give yourself a week or 2 to enjoy the movie and all the extras!  Enjoy the ride and leave the driving to Benny, your faithful tourgide!",1059264000,6,2388,5.2088772845953

84372,5,0788832492,"Amongst the numerous all-time favorite classics of mines, 1988's ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" stands out brightly against almost every other all-time favorite movie of mines. The reason ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" stands out in this case is not only is it fun, but brilliantly joins together two separate worlds, the real world, and the toon universe in such a brilliant way, there's no way one can resist loving every moment of this classic.
The plot revolves around a humorless and even cold-hearted ACME detective named Eddie Valiant (Played by Bob Hoskins) who is on a case to investigate the murder of toon president Marvin Acme and also the killing of his brother by a `toon' which has embittered Eddie against associating with the toon world. Unfortunately for him, much to Valiant's disgust, he is sought after for help by a toon who is one the run, being considered the prime suspect but the truth is, a criminal crime lord named Judge Doom (Played by Christopher Lloyd) is the one who is responsible for the murders of Marvin Acme and also of Eddie's brother and not only that, Doom is on a spree to take over toon town, destroy the `caf district' and replace it with a super freeway, jammed with smog-generating traffic, & lined with gas stations, billboards, and giant strip malls `as far as the eye can see'. Now with the help of the twitchy Roger Rabbit, Detective Valiant is now on the case to foil the evil Judge Dooms plans, and save both the `real' world, and the toon universe from his malicious ambitions.
I just don't know where to begin to explain the high level of brilliant casting and great plot that propels this already great movie to unforgettable classic status. Each of the two separate worlds, the `real' world, and the toon world, are just in a chaotic state of fun as Roger Rabbit and his sidekick/nemesis team up in their fight against their common enemy Judge Doom and his `toon' thugs and to find out who is/was responsible for the murders of Marvin Acme and Eddie Valiant's brother. From here, it's an incredibly wild and often hilarious ride as they go on their mission to stop Doom from being able to take over the toon world and build his `superfreeway' and urban sprawl `as far as the eye can see' and turning the toon world into a giant, smog-ridden suburb.
Christopher Lloyd's eccentric personality reaches it's peak with his awesome and chillingly funny role as the main villain Judge Doom.
From what I'm guessing is that those who were involved in the making of this classic went through painstakingly hard work, drawing over 840, 000 animation cels to create the characters and then they were eventually incorporated into the live action shoots and voila! You have a brilliant yet laugh-inducing classic. I don't know about you but the crew must have had lots of fun making this movie. In the end, it all results in an amazing and extremely hilarious classic for the ages. ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is one of the best movies that 1988 produced. Not only does it bring lots and lots of laughs but combines the humor with a mix of brainless but intelligent dialogue and outstanding storylines.",1056412800,,3132,4.727605118829982

84398,5,0788832492,"""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" finally came onto a DVD release (instead of that crappy 1999 release) that is teeming with extras.
1) The Movie
Based on the book ""Who Censored Roger Rabbit"" (which had the characters as comic strip stars instead of cartoon ones), the film has characters Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) and Roger Rabbit (voice by Charles Fleischer) hoping (no pun intended) through a murder mystery. Eddie is sent out to prove Roger's sensual wife Jessica Rabbit (voiced by Kathleen Turner) is having an affair with the owner of the Acme company. Eddie succeeds and shows Roger the pictures, which makes Roger extremely sad and jealous. The day after it turns out that Mr. Acme was hit on the head with a safe (what else?) in the Acme Warehouse the night before. It also turns out that Roger was at the Acme Warehouse around the same time! All fingers point to Roger, as he must be the one who did it because he was jealous about Mr. Acme's ""supposed"" fling with Jessica. The evil and supicious Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) wants Roger for the murder...now. He has plans to excute him a new fashion that is being used to kill toons, Dip (which turns out is made of the same elements to clean animation cels in the commentary). Roger soon turns up at Eddie's office for help. Eddie, extremely reluctant at first, starts to grow a friendship with Roger. It comes to an hilarious end in this wonderful movie, and it is the only film to find Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny in one scene...together...talking to each other!
2) The Extras
There are two discs: Family-Friendly and For the Enthusiast. Don't worry, the movie is on both discs.
The family-friendly disc has sparse features, though. It also is very easy to navigate, and this disc doesn't have a director's commentary. Basically this disc was made so even a 5 year-old could get to the movie by himself.
The extras on the family-friendly disc are 3 Roger Rabbit shorts, a breif 10-minute kid-friendly ""Who Made Roger Rabbit"", hosted by Roger himself, Charles Fleischer, and a ""Trouble In Toontown"" game.
The 3 Roger Rabbit shorts are the only reason (except for the hidden original theatrical trailer. Hint: Push down on the main menu) to pop in the disc if you're a film enthusiast and/or a Roger Rabbit fan. They all feature the same basic story: In a Maroon Cartoon, Roger has to take care of Baby Herman and ends up in wild fashion. The real treat of each of these are the endings. Shown with Disney films through 1993, the shorts are extremely well thought out, clever, and hilarious with a personal touch by Mr. Spielburg himslef. The shorts are as of follows:
*Tummy Trouble (1989, released with ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"") is the first animated short to be released by Disney since 1961. It was also the most expensive animated short at that time. It features Roger trying to help Baby Herman when he swallows a baby rattle. Wouldn't you know that a Roger Rabbit short helped the ""Honey, I"" franchise to get popular. Many Roger fans flocked to it to see the short, yet they were also pleasantly suprised to see what followed. (NOTE: Freeze-frame the part where Roger and Baby Herman are falling through the hospital floors, and they reach a bathroom. Mickey Mouse is inside one of the stalls)
*Roller Coaster Rabbit (1990, shown with ""Dick Tracy"") immediately followed, also helping ""Dick Tracy"" get a decent run in the box office. It features Roger and Baby Herman trying to chase a red balloon, and yes, as the title suggest, ends on a wild roller coaster ride. Did you know that Spielburg wanted this short to preceed ""Arachnaphobia""?
*Trail Mix-Up (1993, shown with ""A Far Off Place"") was a big suprise to many Roger fans, as a short (this is also the last short) had not been produced and released in almost three years. It is also the first cartoon short to use computer animation, and it shows. This is defintely the best looking of the shorts, with excellent effects to keep you watching and laughing. It features Roger trying to chase Baby Herman through the forest, leading to a Splash Mountain-esque ride through a saw mill.
The only bad thing about the shorts is that they don't come with commentary.
Now, onto the ""For the Enthusiast"" disc, this IS the disc for film buffs. A little hard to navigate (they could've sharpened up the menu a bit), but wonderfully done. This disc features both the movie and the commentary, along with a slew of extras.
The commentary is great, with Robert Zemickis and others who pitched in with the film. They offer great trivia, such as the fact that Judge Doom used to be the one who shot Bambi's mother!
Other extras are a ""Before and After"" featurette, having Bob Hoskins going through Toontown...with both the final product and the original shot product with blue-screens simutaneously. Another is ""On-Set!"", a look at the Benny the Cab scenes before the animation. Another has puppet figures as stand-ins for the toons.
""Toontown Confindental"" is a trivia opition that allows you to have continous trivia along with the film. ""Behind the Ears: The Making of Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is an excellent 36-minute documentary that you really just need to take the time and sit for.
""The Pig-Head Sequence"", a deleted scene is feature also here. It has Eddie snooping through Jessica's office, and Judge Doom finds out. To get back, the Judge has his weasels throw Eddie into Toontown. Eddie comes back with an animated pig head on his face. At his office, Eddie uses turpintine to get the pig head off. Now you know why Eddie wasn't wearing a shirt when Jessica came to greet him in the final film.
""Valiant Files"" combines image gallerys with a snoop-feature. You can look through Eddie's office for images, or just use the cheat sheet if you're lazy. This has some great images and drawings, a must-see.
Well, that's pretty much the DVD in my words. A wonderful buy for all. The film has themes and language that a 10-12 year old could pick up and not be suitable for, but anyone with an age lower than that would not catch it. You'll be on your couch for hours, as my title says, watching this DVD...",1050710400,3,6117,4.685873605947956
84399,5,0788832492,"Reviewing the movie: ""Who frameed Roger Rabbit"" (without the question mark, because it's bad luck) was the ""E.T."" from the end of the eighties; when this movie was released, almost there was no CGI graphics in the movies (the ""Digital era"" began at the mid of the 90's); this movie was a land mark in the way of the making special effects and animation (every single animated frame was made with pencil and ink -- everything was drawed), but not only that, it's the first (and maybe the only and last) movie that brings together the Looney Tunes and the ""Mouse Pack"" among other Toons.
This movie was directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump) and produced by Steven Spielberg (Jaws, The Schindler's list) and it won 4 Academy Award (with a special achievement award for animation direction).
The plot is about a detective, Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) that must help a Toon to clean his name of the charge of homicide, this toon is Roger Rabbit (Chales Fleischer); in this world, all the humans and the toons coexist hand in hand (even the toons that we saw in all the animated shorts from the 40's and 50's were actor under the contract of the many Hollywood studios); however, all the toons are segregated in a place named Toontown (here, we can see a couple of references of the racism that US lived in the post-war era).
The movie is rated PG, because it's sexual innuendo and the mature subject (i feel that this movie is more oriented to adults than kids)
Reviewind the DVD: This package contains 2 dvd: Family Friendly (with the Full screen format of the movie and the Roger Rabbit's animated shorts, among other kids oriented to kids, like games and puzzles) and For Enthusiasts (with the widescreen version, deleted scene (the famous ""Pig Head""), comparisions before and after the toons where added to the film (specifically the Toontown secuence), production notes, audio documentary, featurettes, etc); the sound is very good (THX certified... even a speaker of mine fall down in the ""THX sound""); the case of the dvd was something like a card-box (pretty, but i prefer the plastic cases); in the foreign language support, i feel that it could be better, the movie includes french, english and spanish tracks, but lacks form spanish subtitles (i think that it has french subtitles, but i'm not sure), the worst part is that all the extras has no subtitles at all! (not even english subtitles) so if you don't know english, you're going to suffer a little.
Anyway, this DVD is much better that the first (that was released a couple of years, and if you love this movie, you'll love the dvd!",1049587200,2,2620,4.710239651416122
84400,5,0788832492,"Animated movies have continued to improve successively with each passing year culminating with entire movies composed only of computer graphics.
Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an exceptional fusion of live action and animation that helped break the mold.  The continuity of the scenes are so fluid that you can't distinguish the seperation of the live from the animated.  There are no computer graphics whatsoever and all the animation is hand drawn which is pretty incredible.
If you're one of the viewers, like myself, who opted to avoid the first release of this movie on DVD for something better, then you know that the Vista Series release is something special and a wonderful 2 disc set at a great price.
Split between one disc for children and families and one disc for special feature enthusiasts, there is enough material here to keep everyone pleased for hours.  The demonstrations of the melding technique of live action and animation is especially interesting.
The movie itself is vibrantly colorful and crystal clear.  DTS surround sound is superb and compliments the whole experience.  Filled with great humor from start to finish and a huge cast of cartoon characters from all genre's past and present, this movie is a top-notch crowd pleaser all around.

84422,1,0788832492,"What the heck is wrong with Disney?!?!?  The ONLY version worth buying is the Original VHS release... TRUST ME.  Back a couple years when the first DVD release was made, it was quickly discovered to be CUT and ALTERED for younger audiences.  First, in the scene early in the film where Baby Herman throws a fit on the movie set.  In the original version, he walks under a woman's legs and sticks his arm up her dress and says ""Excuse me Toots!"".  On that DVD, Baby Herman's arm was re-drawn so it just stays by his side!  Another scene is when Valiant first meets Jessica Rabbit.  When he first enters the Toon Strip Club, we can see that Betty Boob is onstage with her shirt off and she's shaking her b%%b$ (don't get excited, her back is to the camera).  This scene is completely CUT from the DVD.  Later in the film when Jessica Rabbit and Valiant are riding on the car in Toontown... the car screeches out of control and crashes, throwing Valiant and Jessica onto the streets.  For a second or two in the original version, it was VERY obvious that Jessica had NO underwear on and the dress was very wide-legged.  In that first DVD, they added white underwear.  NOW WE HAVE THIS VISTA SERIES DVD!!  The version that they tote on TV as the ""Definitive version""... AHH, yeah right.  They HAVE gone back and fixed Baby Herman's arm.  Now his arm reaches back up the dress.  THANK YOU.  But the scene of Betty Boob is still cut!!  Not only that, but the scene with Jessica being thrown from the car has been RE-DRAWN!!  Now her dress has been extended so that it is now pulled down revealing nothing!!  These scenes may sound like ""No big deal"" to the average viewer, but what of us who love WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?  What of us who want the film we remember seeing??  Altering this film is just as offensive as what Lucas has done to STAR WARS!!  Take my advice and STEER THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY from this trite.  If we all demand that we want ROGER RABBIT the way it WAS, and refuse to buy this new ""Kid-Friendly"" version... maybe Disney will take notice.  Maybe...",1049241600,30,2066,4.402116402116402
84423,5,0788832492,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit is nothing short of a masterpiece and way ahead of its time. At first glance, the film appears to be for the kiddies, but this is a somewhat complicated murder mystery with plenty of dark humor and hilarious jokes. The special effects and flawless blend of animation and live action--which are remarkable--never detract from the story and in the end they add a great dimension to this fine motion picture.
Simply put, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a landmark film. You could sit and marvel at the breathtaking special effects, and be fooled into thinking that they are the only reason it is any good. But even though the special effects are stunning, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a film experience like no other. It's a brilliant piece of work, utilising numerous elements to make it unforgettable. It blends comedy, film noir, romance, drama, horror, and any other style you can think of, into one roller coaster ride of a movie.
The film takes us back to 1947, into the hectic life of Hollywood. The only difference here is that Toons are living, breathing creations, that interact with humans. Toons live in Toon Town (obviously) but also come out to play in our world, and also to make a living in the glitzy world of showbiz. Roger Rabbit is a big star with Maroon Cartoons, but life isn't being very good to him lately. He can't seem to get a scene right, and no matter how many times he bangs his head, he just won't see stars. Studio owner R.K. Maroon is suspicious that Roger's wife, the seriously smouldering Jessica Rabbit, is being adulterous, so he enlists the help of private detective Eddie Valiant to catch her out. Eddie is a bitter, sullen man, and has a deep hatred for Toons ever since his brother and partner Teddy was killed by one (via a piano being dropped on his head). Still, Eddie takes the case, and catches Jessica playing ""patty cake"" with Marvin Acme, the head of the Acme Corporation, responsible for such things as hand buzzers and singing swords. When Roger finds out, he becomes hysterical, and vanishes into the night. The next morning, Acme is found dead, and Roger becomes the prime suspect in the case. On the run, Roger hooks up with Valiant, and swears that he was set up, an intriguing mystery in a truly wonderful film.
Who Framed Roger Rabbit never slips up in the quality department on any level. The performances are strong, the script switches from comedy to drama with ease, the direction is potent, and the special effects are amazing. Even after over a decade, they still look as fresh and real as ever. Bob Hoskins does a great job as Valiant; completely believable as a sour man out of his depth on a job he could do without. Christopher Lloyd is suitably terrifying as Judge Doom. His climactic scenes are ones that will stay with you long after the film has ended. Joanna Cassidy is under-used but effective as Dolores, giving a sexy and snappy performance. The vocal performances are also first rate; Charles Fleischer is perfect as maniacal Roger, and Kathleen Turner makes Jessica into one of the most sensual animated characters ever created. Robert Zemeckis does a great job directing the piece, and you can't review the film without mentioning the many cameos from popular cartoon stars. Highlights include Donald Duck and Daffy Duck in a war of piano skills, and Tweety Bird's rather callous treatment of Eddie as he clings to his life off the side of a skyscraper.
Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an essential film that everyone simply needs to see. Once seen, it will stay with you forever. A film deserving of the term ""classic"".",1049241600,2,3607,4.690851735015773
84424,4,0788832492,"The fourth home video incarnation of WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT? is a fully-loaded, double disc set with tons of extras and a great commentary track.  The film has never looked better. There's a family friendly full screen version as well as a pristine widescreen transfer. Part film noir, part period who dunnit and part cartoon, this breakthrough mixed genre is most remarkable for Bob Hoskins' incredible performance as an American gumshoe's  bad acid trip into a demented toon town. And there's not a single frame of computer generated imagery.
The publicity material claims this is a restored version, but alas the infamous frames (about 76 minutes into the film) of a panty-less Jessica Rabbit remain excised. I could find no Disney spokesperson who would comment on this silly censorship. Sorry, you'll have to see the original VHS tape or the laser disc if you want to be titillated by Jessica's cartoon crotch. Recommended.",1049241600,4,929,5.065359477124183
84425,5,0788832492,"It seems difficult to believe that this movie came out in 1988.  As I watched the new Vista Series release, one part of me kept thinking computer graphics, but I knew that there were no digital computer effects in this movie.  All the effects that you see are a combination of animation and physical special effects.  However, you do not need to know that there were no computer effects in this movie to enjoy it.
The story:  Roger Rabbit was framed for the murder of Marvin Acme, played by Stubby Kaye.  Bob Hoskins, playing gumshoe Eddie Valiant, finds that he has been suckered into being part of setting poor Roger up to take the fall.  Sounds like film noire, and in fact it is, with one tiny twist; Roger Rabbit and many of the characters in this movie are ""Toons"", short for cartoons, of course.  What follows is a twist on the detective movies of the 30s and 40s, only with everything larger than life and with a good dose of humor.
The animation in this movie is nothing short of fantastic.  The special effects used to simulate the interaction of the cartoon characters and the human actors are so seamless that eventually you accept that the cartoon characters are ""real"".  The animation was so good that the movie won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects in 1988, along with several other Academy Awards.
One fascinating feature of the animated characters is the appearance by characters from multiple studios.  Though Touchstone Pictures, a division of Disney, made this film, there are Warner Brothers characters, Woody Woodpecker, Betty Boop, Droopy Dog and a host of Disney characters from Dumbo to Donald Duck.  Such inter-studio cooperation is unusual, but works extremely well for this movie, making the movie much more believable and enjoyable.
The combination of film noire, animation and humor in the movie make the movie suitable for adults and children.  However, some scenes are somewhat intense, garnering the movie a PG rating, so parents should consider whether the movie is suitable for the youngest members of the family.
While I could spend more time on the movie itself, I think the movie speaks for itself.  It was highly lauded by a number of critics when it came out, and the movie did very well at the box office and in release on video.  Instead, I'd rather focus on the features of the Vista Series release.
This release contains two DVDs, with more features and extras than I was aware existed.  The two DVD's contain three animated shorts that were made after the success of ""Who Made Roger Rabbit"".  There are commentaries, pictures, and several features related to how portions of the movie were filmed.  One of the most interesting features show comparisons between Bob Hoskins and his actions against a blue screen in comparison to how the final scenes came out.  Another interesting feature shows how plastic dolls were used to aid in setting up shots.  A deleted scene with Bob Hoskins in a pig's head is also included, along with the reasons the scene was deleted.  One of the complaints regarding the previous releases has been that there was this wealth of material available, but not available on a video release.  I think much of the material regarding how this movie was made and the trivia associated with it is included in this DVD.  I spent several hours going through the material and I'm not sure that I've seen it all yet.
I only have one small complaint regarding all this material.  The material was not well-organized and I had a hard time finding specific features, and found myself jumping from screen to screen to find everything.  In fact, I'm not sure I've found it all yet.  Of course, that also means you get the thrill of discovery each time you find a feature listed on the box that you struggled to find in the first place.
For the aficionado of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" that has sought more information about the movie than was previously available, your version of this DVD is here.  The movie itself is just as fresh and amazing today as it was in 1988.  The extras are numerous and are nearly worth the price of the DVD by themselves.

-The packaging is very nice.  Typical ""Vista Series"" Quality.
-The extras are first rate.  Something for everyone.
-3 short Roger Rabbit films (that I never knew existed) are amazing.
-Sound Quality is excellent. Maybe a notch bellow LOTR.
-The menu is incredible.  Spend 5 minutes just watching that.  Good stuff.
-Keep your eyes open.  This is the who's-who of Pre-50s cartoons.
-The animation is of a rare quality.  It's style and quality rivals the High tech animation of today with a very soft feal to it.

-Full of sexual inuendo.  Might go over your kid's head... ...might not.
-You could spend hours playing with the special features and watching the menu do it's ""tricks"".

84428,3,0788832492,"""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is a hybrid of genres: a film noir murder mystery grafted onto the hyper-text of the animated cartoon. The plot centers on washed up detective, Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins).  Shifting between his own inner demons of a brother who was killed on a case and his alcoholism, Eddie's luck appears to take a turn for the better when R.K. Maroon hires him for a cheap and easy snoop job. But the job is a set up directly linking the murder of a night club owner to the mystery behind a missing last will and testament. Roger (voiced by Charles Fleischer), a five foot tall animated rabbit is the prime suspect. He and Eddie go together like oil and water but with the help of Roger's lusty busty wife, Jessica (voiced by Kathlene Turner) the two embark on a burgeoning friendship destined to save Los Angeles from the dreaded Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd).
At the time of its release the seamless blend of traditional animation and live action won Disney and Touchstone a host of accolades and the respect of the entire industry, not to mention a couple of technical achievement Oscars for good merit. However, in the intermission between 1988 and the present this sort of complexity has become rather pass (seen in everything from theater promos to television commercials). Thus in retrospect the film has dated much more as a clich than might be expected. Instead of maintaining timelessness there is the faint odor of formaldehyde teeming from the cheering sidelines of animation's finest and most enduring creations. Everyone from Bugs Bunny to Betty Boop appear in cameos but the effect no longer enthralls as much as it seems the expected sideline to an otherwise stagy cinematic experience.
The original DVD release of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" was not anamorphic and although that problem has been rectified on Touchstone's newly minted two disc special edition, there remains a host of digital anomalies that seem new to this incarnation. In a pre-digital domain environment of editing, the source elements for the duped and animated plates in this film seem exceptionally worn, suffering from a barrage of dirt and scratches. Screen flutter is excessive in almost every scene in which cartoons and humans interact. There are also a few cases where either the human element or the cartoon characters appear slightly out of focus. Shadow effects on animated characters create a disturbing and distracting halo effect that is unflattering to say the least. Digital grit is at times excessive, especially in the opening cartoon sequence. Fine details occasionally shimmer. Colors are overall well balanced. But there are a few inconsistencies. For example, watch how Roger's red pants change from red to orange, then back to red, throughout the film. Also, ""the Red Car"" street cars register more orange than red. All of these problems, I suspect, are the result of cramming too much info on one disc.
Even though this is a two disc set, Disney/Touchstone has reserved the first disc for a full frame copy of the movie and an audio commentary only. The rest of the features, including an extensive array of well produced documentaries, deleted scenes, trailers and other extras, have all been crammed onto disc #2 along with the widescreen version of the film. The result is less than optimal picture quality. The sound for both versions of the film is a 5.1 remix that is identical to the previously issued DVD. It is strident and shrill at times and very well balanced at other moments. With all the hype surrounding this re-issue, more should have been expected and delivered from the folks over at Disney.",1048723200,3,3634,4.928221859706362
84429,3,0788832492,"""Roger"" looks terrific after 15 years, sporting THX-certified audio and video that tops all previous versions of the film.
Disney spilt the new set into discs titled ""Family Friendly"" and ""Enthusiast."" Segregating the extras makes sense -- it worked great on ""Shrek"" -- but here the kids get the short end of the schtick. Aside from a fun game and a trio of ""Roger"" shorts, there's little worth revisiting in this part of Toontown. Kids are rarely puzzled by widescreen anymore, so for most folks it's an extra $10 or so for a disc they'll rarely play. Here's a pie in the face for that decision -- and minus one star.
The ""family"" version comes full screen (1.33:1) with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround. The adults' DVD unspools ""Roger"" in widescreen (1.85:1) enhanced for 16x9 screens, with the welcome addition of DTS sound. Live-action images look a bit flat at times, but the vivid cartoon colors jump off the screen. Audio in either format is front-biased, with the rear speakers used mostly for music accents, not the many sound effects.
DVD menus star Bennie the Cab, mixing animation and live action, like the film. They're fun at first, but repeat viewers won't appreciate waiting for the menu gimmicks to play out.
Director Robert Zemeckis, producer Frank Marshall and four other ""Roger"" veterans provide the feature-length commentary (recycled from the laserdisc), which is loaded with good vibes, great stories and a fair amount of tech talk. (It's nearly impossible to keep track of who's talking most of the time.) The filmmakers clearly love their film and delight at their co-workers' craft (""Look at those shadows!""). They remain astonished at the performance of then-unknown Bob Hoskins, who conjures up the spirit of Buster Keaton.
The fast-moving 36-minute documentary ""Behind the Ears"" is new and quite good, with a snazzy parade of images.
The DVD set includes a surreal deleted scene in which Hoskins' character is forced to wear a giant pig's head. The clip would pass for a Pink Floyd video.",1048636800,2,2012,4.955621301775148
84430,5,0788832492,"If you really WANT to hear Donald saying what some allege he says to Daffy in this film, you might be able to convince yourself that's what you hear. But it just isn't true.
This movie wasn't made that long ago, folks; there's no way on God's green earth that a film comedy with a profile this high would EVER have made it to release with Donald Duck using the words attributed to him. What he actually does say is a variation on the same sort of stuff he has ALWAYS said in situations such as this ... and this doesn't include profanity, not today nor back in the 1930s. This movie does have some elements that will only be appreciated by adults, but they're either the sort of innuendo that won't register with kids, or freeze-frame moments that are well-nigh impossible to catch at full speed (and even slowed down, children will not see the significance).
I mean, kids hearing Dolores ask Eddie, ""Is that a rabbit in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?"" aren't going to get the full significance of the line, unless someone explains it to them, if then -- and they're too busy watching Eddie struggling to keep Roger hidden anyway.
For kids, there's little here that's more salacious than the appearance of Jessica Rabbit ... or Betty Boop, for that matter.
I do believe that, counting the original release, the VHS release and the first DVD, I've watched this film somewhere between 35-50 times (more than any other movie). If Donald were calling Daffy such a vile name, I'd know.
This film is just a masterpiece, a landmark in movie history. There are so many great moments that I wouldn't know where to start. Suffice to say this is one of those rare movies where every aspect of the creative talents brought to bear came together perfectly, from the music to the sets to direction to casting to the animation to lighting and whatever else you might think of. This is one movie that truly lived up to (or even surpassed) the hype and expectations built up prior to release.
The cameos by virtually every memorable cartoon character in existence in 1947 was unprecedented, and really adds both to the fun and the sense that Toontown could have actually existed.
Two favorite moments: The ""singing sword"" Eddie briefly tries to use against the villain (I'll not name this villain, just on the off-chance someone's never seen the film), and the torch song Jessica Rabbit sings (her singing voice is actually that of Amy Irving) when we see her for the first time.
I wish only that they had included the other couple of deleted/shortened scenes that were in the movie when it was shown on network TV.

This film still remains a classic, and retains the highbar status of melting live-action with animination. Bob Hoskins plays Eddie, a down on his luck private eye, assigned by R. K. Maroon to do some undercover work. His findings set in motion the wonderfully creative story. Part film noir, part hysterical comedy, part magic, this film blends so many elements together to produce an incredible product.
The DVD release is also pure magic. Finally, for fans and newbies alike, this DVD treats the film with the respect it deserves. The two disk set gives you a wealth of information on the film, from its making to deleted scenes, to commentaries. It's amazing just to watch the film, but to learn about how this film was made will astonish you. I particularly enjoyed the ""deleted scene"", which in reality is a series of scenes cut out that were hysterical.  Little gems like this really make for a great buy.
Back to the film, everytime I watch this movie, and perhaps this happens to you, you FORGET that Roger, Jessica, and many other characters, are animated. It's in that suspension of belief that lies the reality of it all. The filmmakers were successful in their goals of doing that. No, they were more than successful, they were the magicians. Who Framed Roger Rabbit will stand as a testament to the art of filmmaking at its finest.

84453,5,0788832492,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the best film ever that mixs animation with live action. Lame movies such as Cool World and Space Jam have tried to be like Roger Rabbit but have failed.
 Roger Rabbit has been framed for murder by an evil toon and only one man can save him, the former detective for toons Eddie Valent. Eddie Valent used to take cases for toons until one killed his brother. He has to come face to face with his past in-order to save Roger.
 Bob Hoskins is great as Eddie Valent as is Christopher Lloyd as the villain. It's the special effects that are the real star in Who Framed Roger Rabbit though. They're flawless and you get the feel that the actors are really talking and interacting with the toons.
 I really would of loved if they made a few sequels but it's a little late for that now since you don't really see Bob Hoskins around anymore. He had much more star power then than he does now as well.
 The only problem that I still have with the film is that it has a very adult theme to it and isn't as much for kids as a movie with a bunch of famous cartoon characters should be. There's one point where Donald Duck calls Daffy Duck a really bad prejudice word for instance. You have to listen hard to hear it but it's there. Still though Daffy versues Donald is so much fun that I wouldn't mind a sequel just to see go at it again.
 The dvd for this movie is a dream come true for me. When they released that no feature version on dvd I was really disapointed. This dvd totally makes up for it though. It's one of the best dvd's of this new year for sure. I've only seen the Roger Rabbit short Tummy Trouble but this dvd gives you the chance to see all 3 of his shorts. It's just an awesome dvd.

I can say however, that this is a much better and more enjoyable presentation than the special edition CAV Laserdisc (even as nice as that was). The picture looks great, the 5.1 mix is great, you have more choices of how to spend your time with this set than a barrel full of weasels. You really couldn't ask for much more. I wish all DVD releases had this much thought and effort put into them.
I won't go into a review of the film, there are plenty of those already. I've loved it since it first jumped from the cinema screens. I still love it today. Even as good as computer art has become, there is a special magic sometimes from brush and ink that can't be replaced. Adding in the incredible live action interactions makes Roger hard to top.

84455,5,0788832492,"""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" was a huge hit when it was released in 1988 and made Bob Hoskins a star.  It successfully combined live action with animation and featured a strong and funny cast of characters and an entertaining storyline.
To best describe this film to the uninitiated would probably require a comparison with ""L.A. Confidential"" (with PG-friendly/cartoon violence) and a Looney Tunes movie.  It is fun, boisterous and entertaining with memorable performances by Bob Hoskins (as Eddie Valiant), Christopher Lloyd (as Judge Doom), Roger Rabbit (as himself) and that sultry scene-stealer Jessica Rabbit (as herself and voiced by Kathleen Turner).  A veritable who's who in animation, this film features cameos by Mickey & Minnie Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Yosemite Sam, Daffy Duck, Goofy and Betty Boop, to name a few.
The VISTA SERIES is especially impressive given the many, many special features that are included.  The packaging alone - with a case that looks like a detective's portfolio/folder - is a treat.  Add to that the following:
1) Audio commentary by the filmmakers led by director Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump)
2) Facts and trivia
3) ""The Pig Head Sequence"" deleted scene
4) ""Before and After"" split-screen comparisons
5) 2 behind-the-scenes documentaries, including an new, exclusive in-depth featurette
6) A DVD game
7) 3 animated shorts
and more!!
The film itself is well worth the price of the DVD. Add to that the wealth of special features and this promises to be one of the best DVDs of the year.

disc 1 is for the kiddies, it contains the full-frame version of the movie and a couple extras that briefly go over how the movie was made and so forth.
disc 2 is for longtime fans and film buffs (the people dvds were made for in the first place). it contains the widescreen version of the film, plus tons and tons of supplemental material on the making of the movie. through interviews, rough cuts, on-set footage and more, you get to see every stage of production and all the info you could ever want on what went into making such a visionary film. this disc is loaded and will not disappoint.
WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT is a classic because they just don't make movies like this anymore. this isn't a children's movie, it's a movie period. it doesn't insult the intelligence of its viewers and wasn't made to cash in. it has withstood the test of time, because i loved it as a kid and now with this special edition, i can enjoy it on a whole new level as an adult. my kids can watch the first disc and be completely entertained as i was, then as they get older they can dip into disc 2 and who knows? maybe they'll be inspired to get out there and bring their imagination to life the way these filmmakers did.",1047945600,3,1986,4.355795148247979
84457,5,0788832492,"This film was released in 1988, and told the story of adorable and whacky cartoon characters spilling over into the ""real"" world as studio contract players.  It's basically a buddy cop noir detective story between a hard boiled detective (Bob Hoskins) and a fuzzy white animated rabbit he is helping.  Amazingly enough NO CGI was used at all - 840,000 hand painted cells were overlaid onto live action!  It's amazingly real, and hasn't really been topped before or since.
Previously ROGER RABBIT was released as a bare bones single DVD without any extras, bells or whistles.  Buena Vista corrects this oversight with a stunning loaded new package which contains two DVDS.
The first is labeled the ""Family Friendly"" version, and contains the pan and scan version of the film and a kid friendly documentary about the movie.  Also included are three cartoon shorts featuring Roger and Baby Herman previously only seen in theatres.  There is a rather remote intensive game included as well that should keep youngsters entertained, but not quite up to their Playstation standards.

Much like director Robert Zemeckis' BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy, time has done very little to tarnish the charm of this amazing fantasy film.  It's all the more impressive when you realize it was made without ANY computer animation.  Every cell of animation (all 80,000 of 'em) was done the old-fashioned way: by hand.  But enough about the film itself.  It looks and sounds great.
The Vista Series release gives you 4 options for viewing the film.  In addition to watching the film in your choice of widescreen or full-frame, you can choose from two informative supplemental tracks.  One is an audio commentary from the filmmakers, the other is a ""Pop Up Video""-style feature which provides a constant barrage of on-screen tidbits about the film.  The pop-ups do tend to digress (yes, we know that Tex Avery influenced the style of Roger Rabbit, but do we really need Tex's biography here?), but they are nonetheless informative and often amusing.
A well-done half-hour documentary takes viewers behind the scenes.  And Charles Fleischer (the voice of Roger) hosts a more kid-friendly featurette that nicely evokes the irreverent style of its subject matter.  Plus, there's a fun ""Toontown"" game you can play with your DVD player's remote control, and a few other featurettes on various technical aspects of the production.  Oh, and the 3 original Roger Rabbit shorts that were shown with selected Disney films in the late 80's and early 90's.

84459,4,0788832492,"I am a big fan or Roger Rabbit. It's silly. It's fun. Bob Hoskins is entertaining. I was surprised to watch it again and discover just how well the combination of the animation and the live action photography has held up. It's not completely seamless, but it's not really meant to be. It looks good -- vibrarant -- and it's really neat to watch cartoons manipulate live action props. I had always wondered how that was accomplished.
That's what the DVD is for. It will answer that question and any others you may have. It also shows you extensive footage of the live action characters reacting to nothing, reacting to stand-in puppets, and reacting to electronic devices that do some of the animators' work for them. The supplemental material is interesting and well organized. The first disc is essentially for kids and passing fans. It has a full screen version so that little kids won't cry upon seeing black lines.
The second disc is for more interested adult spectators. It has the widescreen version and the commentary.
I would recommend the DVD for its extras as much as for its actual film content. There is even a fun set-up where you must search for some of the special features. Silly as this sounds, it ended up being kind of fun, partly because they had the good sense to make it an actual search, fraught with disappointing leads that bring you nowhere.

This Vista Series DVD brings the film to us with a crisp & clean picture, THX sound, and a beautifully packaged set of extras that include a very clever interactive menu, plus loads of goodies presented smartly, with humor and surprises.

Taking a Chinatown-like story of early Los Angeles with some basis in fact (destroying the Red Line to make way for freeways) complete with murder & intrigue & marrying it to the screwy conceit that cartoon figures, aka Toons, actually lived and worked as live actors and inhabited a section of LA called Toontown is such a manifestly dopey idea that it would take enormous inspiration, intelligence and attention to detail to make it even nominally work.  All of those qualities were present, as the extras demonstrate, in abundance here, and the result was movie magic.
Made prior to CGI coming into its own, the characters were brought to the screen brilliantly.  As one of the animators pointed out, even early CGI was rejected because the film-makers wanted the characters to maintain their cartoon look, only brought into  3 dimensions.  The hows and whys of what they did to achieve this magic are worth a look.
Anchored by the great casting of Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd and Joanna Cassidy and Charles Fleischer, brilliant technical work, and a clever story strung through with great good humor, dialogue and jokes for kids and adults, this film has some cherished, favorite lines, from Baby Herman's ""That's my problem, I've got a 50 year-old lust, and a 3 year-old dinky."", to  Jessica Rabbit's: ""I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way."", to Eddie on the wayward bullets ""Eh, Dum Dums!""  This is great stuff.
""Toons, gets em every time!""  Some kind of classic here, and well worth your while.",1047686400,49,2229,4.768831168831169
84461,5,0788832492,"Filmmakers have been combining animation and live action since the days of silent film--but 1988's WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT not only bested everything done previously, it set a standard that is unlikely to be surpassed.  Although it has been available on VHS and in a mediocre DVD release for quite a few years, the film finally gets the star treatment in this ""Vista Series"" double DVD release, which includes the film in both pan-and-scan and letterbox formats and an assortment of extras, many of which are quite interesting.

The concept and story are well known: cartoon characters are not drawings, but are living entities who work in the film industry, and when Maroon Cartoon star Roger Rabbit is accused of murdering Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye), he turns to private detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) for help.  Trouble is, Eddie hates ""Toons.""  After all, one of them offed his brother, and Eddie hasn't been sober since.  The concept is a clever one, and the story could have gone in any number of directions--but ROGER RABBIT hops down a completely unexpected trail.  Set in 1947 Los Angeles, the film uses classic ""noir"" elements (and references everything from THE MALTESE FALCON to CHINATOWN); it also makes considerable sly social commentary on racism, with the ""Toons"" performing in a Cotton Club-like nightclub, literally working for peanuts at the studios, and more or less confined to living in ""Toontown,"" which might easily be read as social ghettoization.  And all of these sidelights are interesting and entertaining.  But the most attractive thing about ROGER RABBIT is that it is just plain fun to watch.

Part of that fun comes from the marvelous performances of Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd (as the evil Judge Doom), and Joanna Cassidy (Valiant's sidekick Delores), who lead the live action cast.  Another chunk of the fun is the way in which the film cameos a host of famous cartoon characters, ranging from Betty Boop to Bugs Bunny and the Warner Bro.s gang to Dumbo--and animation buffs will love the fact that Betty Boop and Bugs Bunny, to name but two, are voiced by the artists (Mae Questel and Mel Blanc) who created the character voices in the first place.  But the big deal here is the extremely believable way in which the ""Toons"" fit into the real world.  They rendered with astonishing detail and remarkable three dimensionality.  It's just an amazing thing to watch.

The overall DVD package is a bit odd, for it offers less in the way of bonuses than one might expect.  The first disk includes a pan-and-scan version of the film, three Roger Rabbit/Baby Herman shorts, a kid-friendly documentary, and a CD-ROM game; the second disk offers the letterbox film with extras that will appeal to more mature viewers, most particularly on-set shots and a nifty documentary called ""Behind the Ears.""  The upshot is really a one-disk release that has been expanded to two by the trick of cramming both pan-and-scan and letterbox versions into a single package.  That's annoying--but even so, this is easily the best release of this film to date.  It at gives the rabbit some justice at last, and I give it five stars on that basis.

84482,5,0788832492,"""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" Vista Series Edition is one of the best DVDs in my collection. I was fortunate enough to obtain an advance copy, and I can honestly say: anyone with a TV should get this DVD. Also, a DVD player.
I've watched ""Roger Rabbit"" over and over again on VHS, but I can tell you this: watching the Vista Series Edition was like seeing a whole new movie. The widescreen presentation (enhanced for 16x9 televisions) perfectly showcases the movie's incredible special effects. The razor-sharp image makes the interaction between live-action and animated characters seamless, and you find yourself sucked even deeper ""into Toontown"" than ever before.
The DVD packaging is also top-notch. The Vista Series Edition is made for serious movie fans, and the packaging (with its holo-foil cover and cool ""leather-notebook"" interior design) makes this DVD a real premium item.
There are two discs, just packed with goodies. You'll watch the bonus material as often as you watch the actual movie--I certainly have!
Run, don't walk, to buy a copy of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit."" Or better yet, just stay here and click ""Add to Shopping Cart."" But make sure you're getting the Vista Series Edition!",1047600000,3,1199,5.030150753768845
84483,5,0788832492,"If you haven't seen Roger Rabbit, it's probably because you weren't alive when this movie was first released in 1988. An incredible live-action and animation combination, containing special effects never before attempted in any film, Roger Rabbit took the country by storm and became the must-see hit of the summer. But things weren't so rosy prior to it's release. In fact, Robert Zemeckis claims people were literally walking out of the theater during the initial test screening.
If there was ever a movie that could fill a DVD with extras, it would be this one. Unfortunately, the first DVD release of Roger Rabbit was woefully lacking of additional material. I was going to knock a star off in sympathy for the fans who have to buy this movie twice, but I notice Touchstone offers a five dollar rebate for the ""upgrade."" So what do you get? Well this edition contains two DVD's containing Roger Rabbit in Fullscreen and Widescreen edition plus the following supplementary material:
1) A simultaneous split-screen before and after featurette of the scene where Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) falls off the skyscraper and meets Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse on the way down.
2) A deleted scene dubbed ""Pig Head"" where Eddie is captured by Toons and released with a giant pig head drawn over him. His only way out, a long shower with a bucket of turpentine to scrub off and wash his animated attachment down the drain.
3) A featurette explaining the use of plastic puppets as stand-ins for the animation and voice acting from Charles Fleischer (Roger Rabbit) and others to give the impression of realism Hoskins could use during filming. Hoskins even went to mime school to learn techniques that would give them impression of throwing 60lbs of weight around, for instance, when all he was doing was moving air. If the judges saw the amount of work Hoskins had go through in order to act and react to these invisible characters, he probably would've won the best actor oscar for the year.  Less understandable, is Fleischer's odd insistence on wearing a Roger Rabbit costume throughout the taping. Lou Hirsch (the voice of Baby Herman) refused to wear a diaper.
4) A well done documentary of the making of Roger Rabbit including interviews with director Robert Zemeckis, Bob Hoskins, Charles Fleischer, and the animation and visual effects crew. Words and phrases like ""survivor,"" and ""hardest movie ever"" become commonplace. SFX house Industrial Light and Magic needed to create over 1000 visual effects shots for Roger Rabbit.  Prior to this, the most they ever did was 300 for Return of the Jedi. Long before CGI animation became commonplace, all animation in Roger Rabbit was hand-drawn, right down to the individual frame and a good portion of the interview is devoted to the trials and tribulations the animators went through.
Additional material includes the Roger Rabbit shorts that appeared in conjunction with other movies back in the 80's, a DVD game, and a THX optimizer to help dial in your home theater system. The companion booklet isn't much, just brief descriptions of what's on the different DVD's, but you also get autographed headshots of Roger and Jessica Rabbit (total babe!)
The menus are intuitive (hosted by Benny the Cab), but I couldn't move up and down the different selections to pick my choice. I don't know if it was a problem with my particular DVD player but the best I could do was select by number, which was problematic as the selections weren't numbered. In spite of this glitch, the ""Vista Series"" release of Roger Rabbit is a comprehensive collection for fans of the movie as well as movie-making in general. They got it right the second time around.",1047513600,4,3684,4.902243589743589
84484,3,0788832492,"First of all, sorry to contradict you, Luis Arturo Gutierrez Calv, but ""...Roger Rabbit"" does NOT have CGI effects!  While I was living in Los Angeles shortly after the film was released, one of the animation directors for the film was a speaker at a special ""...Roger Rabbit"" symposium at an animation festival. He directly answered a question from the audience about CGI in the film by stating that even though some effects LOOK computer-generated (specifically, the reflective kitchen floor in the opening cartoon segment), everything (even the sequins on Jessica Rabbit's show gown reflecting light like minature flashbulbs) was done the old-fashioned way, by HAND!! Yes, Richard Williams (main animation director) is JUST THAT GOOD!!! As the speaker (whose name escapes me for now) put it: (and I'm paraphrasing by memory here) ""the only time the animators used their computers was in figuring out equations"" for camera angles and such!
That same director also mentioned three scenes that were cut. Namely, the ""Aaah! I'm a pig!!"" scene (which was in commercials for the movie during its theatrical run!) that has since been shown on network television (and is included on this dvd), the scene leading up to that one: Eddie Valiant being caught...in Jessica Rabbit's dressing room, I think...by Jessica, Judge Doom, the Weasels and the Gorilla Bouncer, and gag tycoon Marvin Acme's funeral, featuring Forhorn Leghorn delivering the eulogy (which are not!)!!
Also, I was fortunate enough to be acquainted with voice-over actress Norma MacMillan who recorded lines for ""...Roger Rabbit"" as Casper, The Friendly Ghost!! But where WAS the little guy?? Perhaps at the aforementioned funeral??  Why isn't this scene included??  Even a 'rough' animated pencil test of it would be MORE than welcome!!
We were also treated, that evening, to seing the ENTIRE 'Bob Hoskins in Toontown' sequence WITHOUT the animation!!  It was simultaneously fascinating and hysterically funny seeing the brilliantly talented actor (who truly deserved an Academy Award nomination for his under-rated work in this movie!) reacting to such devices as wooden sticks with 'x's taped to them, representing Bugs and Mickey!!
Well, the movie itself is still a classic, but why weren't these truly special 'extras' included??  Hopefully, this will be rectified by an 'anniversary', or 'SPECIAL-special' edition.
But THIS version's lack of goodies which I KNOW are out there (such as footage of Joe Pantoliano...remember Ralphie from 'The Sopranos'?....playing Eddie Valiant (!) in a VERY early animation test!)  will cause me to hesitate from buying this dvd on March 25th. And for someone like me....for whom animation and cartooning are pretty much my LIFE!!...that's a hard thing to admit, indeed!",1043539200,33,2769,5.324942791762013

84487,5,0788832492,"Disney's Who Framed Roger Rabbit was one of the largest acheivments of movie making history.  This movie's amazing special effects combining live action and animation put Mary Poppins' to shame.  This unique and captivating story is truley one of Disney's finest.  The mystery of ""greed, sex, and murder"" is made even more entertaing by combining Disney and Warner Bros. characters (such as Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Tweety Bird, andBetty Boop along with many other favorites make an appearence).  Don't miss this movie!",1029110400,,533,5.309523809523809
84488,4,0788832492,"There have been numerous films which mixes live action with animation but never before has anything like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" been made. This movie is literally sharing the human world with the animated world.
When a detective, Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), has his brother killed by a toon, he swears he will never work with toons again. So after doing one quick job for Roger Rabbit's boss, he believes he'll never have to be with any toon again. Unfortunately, Roger Rabbit (voice by Charles Fleischer) is framed for the murder of the man who owns toon town! With the help of Dolores (Joanna Cassidy), Eddie must discover who the murderer is, and also find out what the murderer's evil plan is. Of course Jessica Rabbit (Kathleen Turner), Roger Rabbit's wife, is acting mighty suspicious... And so is the Vile Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd). Could either of them have had anything to do with the framing of Roger Rabbit?
""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" must surely be congratulated for the spectacular cartoon and special effects work. The story and plot might be a bit overboard but just watching all the eye-popping fun is worth it. And the movie is filled with underlying jokes and lots of slapstick humor. The acting is also done pretty well, from Eddie Valiant the hard-bitten and serious detective and to most noticeably, Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom who isn't all who he seems.
Also you get to see all of your favorite cartoons who you've known forever, along with hearing the guys who did the original voices: Mickey Mouse and his gang, and Mel Blanc doing the voices of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Sylvester and Tweety Bird. There also Mae Questel as Betty Boop who had done her voice from 1930 until the character was retired in 1949. And plus plenty for characters including one of my favorites, Droopy Dog!
But I can't tell you any more of the story or any of the jokes and fun parts or I'll ruin it for you. So if you're in the mood for a funny movie with lots of cartoons AND people, check out ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". The movie is rated PG for some language and some pretty obvious and sometimes subtle innuendo (just look at Jessica Rabbit...).
A bit of trivia, Kathleen Turner who did the voice of Jessica Rabbit was uncredited. And Amy Irving did Jessica's singing voice.",1027468800,6,2302,4.68641975308642

This movie I thought seemed so cool because it had to make the cartoons interact with live people and it looked so real!  This movie could never be done again because movies are to involved in special effects of the computer and not with animation anymore.  It's actually kind of sad.  This movie released June 21st 1988 grossed 154 Million dollars and deserved it.  There were many followers such as ""Cool World"" and the Paula Abdul video ""Opposites Attract"".  The DVD is fine if you really want the movie now but wait there will be a better release of this movie just wait.",1026432000,,643,4.508620689655173
84510,4,0788832492,"Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Castaway), Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an eye-popping delight for kids and adults alike with it's clever comedy, inventive animation and seamless cartoon interactions with the actors. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd are great, and the combination of cartoonish humour creates a nuance that woks well. Alan Silversti's lively score suits the film's tone, using the same themes as Back to the Future yet bringing new ""cartoony"" music to the film. The brilliant combination of effortlessly clever humour and high-sprited fun make this one a superb classic.

The DVD has much to be desired with no film notes, director's commentary, nor trailers. I was especially hoping to see the deleted scene in which Eddie Valiant breaks into Jessica's dressing room only to get knocked out by the bouncer and has an early dreadful encounter with Toontown that has only been shown once on a CBS airing of the film. Animation has been edited and redone in several places. Disney really needs to realize that they truly have a film gem here and stop placing it in the back burners of their achievements.

The transfer is a botch job with blurs, sandy in the tan areas, overbright in reds, has a grimmy sound transfer, and IS censored in two parts.

Despite being called a 'special edition', it contains not a single extra feature. The widescreen format is not anamorphic, which means that the MPEG aspect ratio is 4:3 and the picture resolution of the viewable area is lower than it should be. The quality of the film print used is poor and contains scratches and white speckling. The film has also had some bits edited out, so I suppose you could say it contains a negative number of special features: i.e. some normal features taken out. This is a shocking misuse of the format because the DVD standard contains the possibility for having optional scenes which can be shielded from young viewers, so why wasn't this used?
I doubt it will be long before the next version comes out, the 'collector's special edition' or whatever they will call it, so my advice would be to wait for that.",990144000,51,935,4.571428571428571

In particular are shots with very few cartoon characters, each from a different studio.

This is the work of the animation half, a genre hostile to boundaries and reason, even if the thriller plot here means it is not quite as liberated as the average Looney Toon.  Not only is this possibly the first blockbuster film to allude to Joyce's 'Ulysses' (the Toon Town/Night Town sequence), but it is also an allegory of the McCarthy era, reminding us how animation bravely protested when live action kept ingloriously schtum.",984700800,,781,5.149606299212598

I was entranced by the very notion of Who Framed Roger Rabbit from the beginning, and it played an enormous part in the stories, drawings and games I became involved in my pre-teens. When I finally did see it it fulfilled all of my expectations, and has remained for over ten years in my top five favourite films of all time.

WFRR paints a convincing portrait of life just after WWII, and I could not imagine a better era for the story to be set. 'Toons are a needed force, a source of vitality and joy in a world bruised and damaged. It is easy to believe that they were living right alongside humans, interacting with them in an entirely natural way.

84547,5,0788832492,"This movie came out when I was 8, and I believed it!  Chalk it up to Robert Zemeckis, Steven Spielberg, Walt Disney animators and Industrial Light & Magic FX technicians!  The story of Roger Rabbit accused of mudering gag king Marvin Acme makes for an intriguing story as we try to find out who did it.  It does seem hard to believe that help could come in the form of Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskin's greatest role).  Eddie is a man who's brother was killed by a toon, and since then, his life has gone downhill to teh point of over drinking alochol (making him a joke to many on the police force).  Roger Rabbit does what he does best: try to make Eddie crack a smile, and at the same time help him crack the case.  But Eddie not only has to put up with Roger, but a gang of insidious weasels out to stop Roger, a loud-mouthed cartoon cab, and the ever evil Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd during his Doc Brown years).  Many people go away form this movi remembering Jessica, and it's easy to see why: modeled after the female contour of aniamtion during the 40's and 50's, the animators capture the feminine charm that was instilled in the cartoons of the greats like Tex Avery.  The art is incredible for the fact that the characters do not wield Computer-generated props, but actual items (at times you can see the wires, which is funny), which the animators had to animate around.  The visual effects guys did an incredible job of adding little touches like shadows, lighting details on the characters, and much more.  Also the fun comes from seeing things that probably would never happen again, like seing Daffy and Donald battling it out over the Hungarian Rhapsody on Piano, and Mickey mouse and Bugs Bunny skydiving.",969753600,2,1720,4.5372168284789645
84548,5,0788832492,Wow I can't say enough good things about this movie. I remember being amazed at age 14 when I first saw it. It is great fun trying to spot all  the different characters. Absolutly entertaining I can't watch it enough.,967420800,,217,4.425
84559,4,0788832492,"Zemeckis hybridized the too-adult world of Ralph Bakshi and the  too-juvenile world of Looney Toons and make Roger Rabbit ""just  right"". Mixing the cartoon zanyness of classic Disney and Looney Toons  shorts with the film noir hard-drinking detective and the very adult  Jessica Rabbit was a brilliant idea.
Although I started to find Roger  Rabbit's constant hyperactivity a bit annoying by the end of the movie,  they kept his endearing traits strong enough that I was happy that the  fatal ""dip"" was not to be. At the same time, half the thrill of  the movie was to see the juxtaposition of the Disney and Warner Brothers  cartoon characters (all contractually paired up and given equal time), as  well as the insider jokes spread through the movie.
The movie was  considered groundbreaking in its mixture of live action and cartoons.  Although it was not by any means the first, the level of quality was very  high.
This movie was on the leading edge of a wave of animation, wherein  animation became popular again. As a consequence, much of the terrible  low-quality Saturday morning animation of the 70's and 80's suddenly had a  higher bar to reach. Toons became decent again!
Like a great Disney  movie, Roger Rabbit works for both young and old audiences. The very young  may find some of the violence intense, and their guardians may have some  discomfort explaining Jessica Rabbit's anatomy, but otherwise age 9 and  above is probably fine.",965001600,2,1451,4.893004115226337
84560,5,0788832492,"I have been waiting for this movie to be released (in Australia) for ages now, and I have been thinking about buying this DVD version, but I have decided to register a protest vote against Disney and the tactics they  appear to be using to make the world a sanitised artificial place by  censoring anything that does not agree with their world view.
It was  pointed out on a local TV show that Disney spent millions on their lifelike  CGI dinosaurs and yet they have no 'waste removal organs'. How lifelike is  that?
If enough people refuse to buy their products (especially the well  informed DVD buying market), then we may be able to force them to release  more complete versions of their old classics. Register a protest vote  today!",964828800,4,737,4.615384615384615
84561,5,0788832492,"After buying the video, and watching it three times in two days, I still want to see it again.  I remember taking my sister to see it the day after I saw it for the first time at the theater.  This is a roll-down-the-aisles  funny movie.
  Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is called in to spy on Roger  Rabbit's (voiced hilariously by Charles Fleischer) wife Jessica (voiced by  Kathleen Turner).  The pictures he takes of Jessica are assumed by most to  be the cause of Roger murdering Marvin Acme.  But there's one catch.  Roger  didn't do it.  Judge Doom (Christopher LLoyd), the menacing villain  and residing judge of Toontown is hot on his trail.  Through it all, we see  an enjoyable send-up of private eye movies, and a cast of thousands of  stock cartoon characters from the 30's, 40's and 50's.
  Don't miss  the sizzling singing number when we first meet Jessica Rabbit.  ""That's Jessica Rabbit! ""  The singing, by the way, is not  Kathleen Turner, but Amy Irving.",964656000,5,970,4.642857142857143
84562,5,0788832492,"My brother and I count Roger Rabbit as one of the best movies ever made.  We used to have all-day Roger Rabbit festivals, where we would watch the movie over and over again.  The movie is THAT fun.  I venture to say it is  a movie for all ages.  Adults will find subtle humor that will go over kids  heads, and kids will love the animation and slap-stick jokes.  This is one  of the most visually amazing movies ever made, and you forget that most of  the characters are cartoons.  This is a movie where the toons truly come to  life.",964310400,,534,4.188118811881188
84563,1,0788832492,"The 1 star is for the DVD not the film. Roger Rabbit is EXCELLENT, but the DVD is very poor. The menu is borning and rushed, the conversion from video to DVD is not amazing and you can see a lot of grains of dust on the film  which cause the blobs you associate with old movies...The sound is  excellent and colour too. No extras, no trailer, no good as a DVD. I would  wait for Disney to make a 'Collector's Edition' which to you and I is what  we expect of an normal DVD. 5/5 for the film, 1/5 for the DVD!",963360000,17,508,3.9029126213592233
84564,4,0788832492,I love Roger Rabbit. Most of you have seen it at the movies or on VHS so I won't bore you with those details. Its still the same old movie. It does appear to have been censored from stories I have heard -- where you could  freeze frame at certain points in the video and see clever things inserted  by the animators. The reason for the 4 stars are  a) There are no extra  features at all b) The transfer production is not great. Looks like very  little work was done on this movie to restore the video quality or upgrade  the sound track. Its just VHS quality video and sound. There is no  advantage over the VHS version except it may last a little longer. :-/,957052800,7,660,4.149606299212598
84565,5,0788832492,"Technicaly Dazzling. This is one of the best animated films of all time, it is certainly different, but in a good way. It vaguely resembles detective movies, particularly 'Chinatown' and 'The Maltese Falcon'. It is  one of the most entertaining movies of the 80's. Demanding of multiple  viewings to spot all of the cartoon stars. The voices for the 'toons' are  perfect especially Charles Fleischer as Roger Rabbit and Kathleen Turner as  the sexy Jessica Rabbit. Filled with lots of memorable characters,  stand-outs on the 'human' cast are Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd. Great  Entertainment. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 9!",952905600,2,643,5.018867924528302
84566,5,0788832492,"I already have two copies of this movie, original release VHS and Laserdisk.  The Laserdisk has developed some sort of plague in the metal sheet.  It looks the same on both sides.  I ordered the DVD today to  replace the Laserdisk.  I hope that the reports of censoring are  exagerated, too much tamperiong would be a travesty against this wonderful  film...
But to the point!  Something that the prior reviews have missed  is that ""Roger"" is essentially a remake of ""Chinatown.""  Watch ""Chinatown"" and then watch ""Roger"", but do it at  your own risk -- you may heve to go to the ER with a busted gut from  laughing so hard!",950572800,,624,4.5225225225225225

84568,5,0788832492,"Simply stated, the movie is WONDERFUL. It gives us our only glimpse, ever, of Donald and Daffy together! It provides a (rather bumblingly) heroic rabbit lead! It is a fine mix of live action and animation! It is a great  detective film! It has everything needed in a great movie: drama, suspense,  sexy heroines, loathsome villains, cuteness, wit, etc. A MUST SEE! A MUST  BUY!
The movie is particularly noteworthy for two reasons: it marks a  fine collaboration between Warner Brothers and Disney Studios (and thus the  interactions of their characters), and it has a flawless combination of  live action and animation, and uses this very well. It still holds up even  with the sophistication of effects in more recent movies.",948758400,,727,4.958677685950414
