6605042,1,B00N176XGE,The complete series is a joke as it only contains the previous season sets and doesn't even include any deleted or extended scenes.  Why would I or any other fan who bought the previous seasons pay $300 for a box set of the seasons we already own?  Could give us fans some extra bonuses as a reason to buy them all again.,1409702400,23,321,4.161290322580645

6605047,3,B00N176XGE,"This is the most rediculous series ever. First time I seen it I've stopped watching after the first season. To tell the truth, I got bored with it after the 5 episode. All this is is that Jason Stackhouse banging every female he sees. Also rediculous story lines. I gave it a three star because of the creepy stuff. However I do love the vampiric scenes.",1518739200,,354,4.378787878787879

6605055,2,B00N176XGE,"It started out really good but by the fifth season it started to go down hill really quick. A lot of good characters died toward the end of season 6 and in season 7. The final episode was a complete disappointment (unless you like overly happy endings) because it didn't end like I thought it would (I all read ""spoilers"" which turned out to be incorrect so that was a let down as well, my fault though). The writers could have done a better job with how Warlow ended up being portrayed (seriously wanted it to be for the better as he was a good actor and his character development was short lived). Overall, debating on returning this series because I most likely will not watch it again.",1515542400,,689,4.390625

6605068,3,B00N176XGE,What I have watched works but there are only 2 episodes per disc and no play all option. I like to watch as I fall asleep which is about 3 episodes before out cold. Defeated part of the purpose. May as well hit play on fire tv instead.,1502755200,,235,3.9166666666666665

6605071,1,B00N176XGE,"I read the entire series before watching this on Amazon. It's my firm belief that the person doing the adaption read the cover blurbs rather than the books. True Blood from HBO is a _very_ loose adaption of the books and does not do them justice.

There are too many character and storyline changes to make this enjoyable unless one is able to totally disconnect the books from the video.

The series shares a title, some character names, and a few events from the series.

This was an utter disappointment.",1502150400,,507,4.611111111111111

6605073,1,B00N176XGE,Unfortunately I read the books first and what Alan Ball did to this series was appalling! The episodes went from the sublime to ridiculous! Each season got more and more absurd with more and more porn! I am ashamed of Charlaine Harris for going along with this and allowing them to make CRAP out of her wonderful series of books!,1498089600,,329,4.5

6605112,2,B00N176XGE,I changed the rating to 2 stars because it js completely missing season 3. A compete series shouldnt be missing a middle season.

The discs are just like the individual releases and include subtitles for three languages if I remember correctly. This set also includes Digital & UltraViolet copies. The show itself is fantastic and has a few intentional and not intentional funny moments. Mainly though the shows elements are mainly that of horror, dramatic and sometimes are very sexual or at least sensual moments. It is not for children and pretty much has everything an adult could want from a tv series. There are 7 seasons and the show starts to fizzle out near the end. It definitely held its own and is even good enough for repeated viewings.

6605153,3,B00N176XGE,"Despite seven seasons of very uneven television, you cant really accuse HBOs True Blood of getting lazy, losing focus, or even jumping the shark, because it basically had all three of those qualities coming right out of its pilot episode. The writing for True Blood immediately established a tone of pulpy, over-the-top, sloppy harlequin romance and then, to fit with the vampire-crazed times, it added in any and every supernatural element it could think of whenever possible. That was all True Blood ever aspired to be. That it also managed to be fun and entertaining and drew you into caring about one or two characters (even if they weren't Anna Paquins Sookie Stackhouse, Stephen Moyers Bill Compton, or Alexander Skarsgards Eric Northman), just serves as proof that True Blood was right at home in HBOs stable of inconsistent but always engrossing serials.

Stripped down to its core, True Blood is a love story set in Louisianas bayou about a waitress (Paquin) and the two vampires (Moyer and Skarsgard) who take a liking to her in a time in fictional American history when vampires have made their presence to humanity known. And while the love triangle drives a good portion of the drama for the series seven seasons, that wrinkle about the world of man just now becoming aware of vampires, as well as a larger world of the supernatural, is really what makes True Blood, as a concept, interesting. Few shows set in a semi-ground realistic world go the route of exploring how mankind copes with the new supernatural revelation, with the vast majority being about how to either suppress that knowledge or keep people from having to encounter it. With True Blood, the cat was out of the bag from the get-go, and it allowed the writers to explore some interesting conflicts between and within the realms of man and the fantastical.

Unfortunately, that element of the series story typically came second or third thanks to the Sookie love triangle and whatever each seasons mostly disappointing supernatural evil happened to be. The one exception to True Bloods lackluster season-capping villains, and also the shows finest moment, came in the form of Denis OHare as antagonistic vampire Russell Edgington. Its tempting to say Edgington was True Bloods best villain because the show built him up and developed him across multiple seasons unlike other villains who simply rose up and eliminated between a single seasons start and end, but really its more than that. Unlike other season-long villains who occupied one part of the shows narrative arc while a number of other subplots continued on alongside it, largely unaffected, Russell Edgingtons appearance tied together so many subplots that, for the entirety of its fifth season, True Blood seemed like it really knew what it was doing.

If youd watched the first four seasons or the two that came after that, however, you know the fifth season was really just a flash in the pan. After that, the various subplots drifted apart again and viewers once again had to latch on to the one or two that really appealed to them. To make matters worse, those other subplots were by no means created equally, with some based on characters who became increasingly grating as the show went on and others who simply never got developed quite enough to really leave an impact. The best example of the latter might be Sam Trammells Sam Merlotte, the owner of the diner who can shapeshift into any animal. Though the character is given plenty to do from one season to the next, the impact of his stories are minimalized or altogether truncated to accommodate other arcs. As for the former example of characters who annoy rather than intrigue, you have Nelsan Elliss Lafayette Reynolds who starts off as the token sassy homosexual character of the series who gets drawn too far into the spotlight as a pawn in the fourth seasons villains plans.

The absolute least that can be said for True Bloods seven season run is that it fulfilled its promise of a supernatural-tinged love story. At most, True Blood is an incredibly uneven but often enjoyable supernatural soap opera that never shies from being ridiculous or really funny when the opportune moment arises. As long as you know going in that True Blood makes no attempt to be anything more than these two high and low points, then its rather good for what it is, but if you want strongly written drama with developed characters, then True Blood isn't what you're looking for.

6605179,5,B00N176XGE,"Finally a series that sucks! literally! True Blood is based on the book series, and follows the adventures of Sookie Stackhouse in a small town of Louisiana. There she discovers she has an ability to read people's thoughts, working in a bar and grill establishment, She met an estranged fellow by the name of Bill. She got intrigued by him, because She can't hear his thoughts and that's how She discovers that He is in fact a Vampire. From there, the series develops into an an erotic, drama, action, plot twists, suspense, some violent scenes, nude-o-rama.  It has plenty of nudity, sex, vampires, and more. To sum up the series in a couple of lines is a disservice to it. The review is for the collection on Blue-Ray, which comes separately for every season, which is good, no gadgets or extras to amp up the price. The picture and audio is top notch, and each season comes with documentaries to add flavor to the already succulent stew. If you love the series and are going to invest in it, this is the perfect collection so far. Pick it up and watch people do bad things to each other. Get it now!",1419811200,,1102,4.482587064676617

Blind loyalty is what keep this series going.  There will always be fans of this show regardless of how dumb it got, and i know there are a lot of Vamp- heads out there that enjoyed the blood, sex, and gore, but it was poorly written and just not worth your time.  So sad that a CW show about Vampires is actually better than an HBO produced show about Vampires.

Well, I have to say that this has definitely disappointed my theory of buying a complete set with ""bells and whistles."" I'm not sure why HBO decided to not show some love to True Blood, but this set was completely disappointing. Where HBO has put out some very nice complete series sets (i.e. original Sex in the City set in book type format, Six Feet Under with grassy top of set, etc), they took no care in putting this set together. What we get is all seasons exactly the same as standard releases in jewel cases. So we are even missing some of the great artwork that was inside the individual releases. There is no special ""episode guide book,"" no bonus disc of extras, and even the slip case is mediocre at best. I wish HBO would have taken the time to show the fans some love and create a release worthy of the show. Maybe make a coffin shaped box or a True blood bottle shaped box, include a bonus dvd including the final True Blood panel at San Diego Comic Con, amongst other extras. I did not notice, but include the ""Baby Vamp"" episoded of Jessica. Not sure what HBO was thinking.

 About True Blood: The Complete Series
 Thanks to a Japanese scientist's invention of synthetic blood, vampires have progressed from legendary monsters to fellow citizens overnight. And while humans have been safely removed from the menu, many remain apprehensive about these creatures ""coming out of the coffin."" In the small Louisiana town of Bon Temps, local waitress Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) is open-minded about the integration of vampires - particularly when it comes to Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), a handsome 173-year old living up the road. But at the service of Bill's less virtuous vampire associates, Sookie is drawn into a series of catastrophes that will put their love to the test.

 About True Blood: The Complete Seventh Season
 This year, a season-opening battle between raging Hep-Vamps and their Bon Temps prey sets the stage for a season-long series of hair-raising denouements for Sookie, Bill, Eric (Alexander Skarsgrd), Jason (Ryan Kwanten), Sam (Sam Trammell), Alcide (Joe Manganiello), Tara (Rutina Wesley) and their human/vampire allies and adversaries. As we'll see, some of True Blood's most beloved figures will meet cruel fates, while others will cheat death (true and otherwise) to forge happily-ever-after relationships that will leave fans surprised and, ultimately, satisfied. What will happen to your favorite True Blood character?
