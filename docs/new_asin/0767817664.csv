13714,5,0767817664,"BOTTOM LINE: One of the THE BEST horror movies pretty much EVER, actually. It has a timeless quality, despite the obvious hairstyle & clothing selections which squarely pegs it as an 80's flick. Top-shelf acting across the board, with the wonderful Roddy McDowell being a stand-out. (IMHO, he deserved an Oscar for his terrific turn as hollow, egotistical B-movie has-been, Peter Vincent.) Excellent practical & optical effects still provide the jolts needed to keep you jumping throughout. Sensuous, slick synth soundtrack by Brad (Terminator, T2) Fidel. This Blu-ray plays flawlessly on all machines and the picture is worlds above the previous DVD editions. The extras alone rate 5 STARS, but with the superb hi-def transfer as well, this would be a 10 STAR release, if such a thing were allowed. :-)

THOUGHTS: I have loved this movie ever since first catching it on cable decades ago. It is one of those movies that you never get tired of, the kind where if you come across it on TV you'll settle in and watch it, no matter how far along into the film it is. Writer/director Tom Holland crafts a full-blooded film that takes many of the time-honored vampire tropes and embraces them, while at the same time adding new wrinkles, all without smudging the trappings we've come to know and love about the genre. Every actor here is putting in A+ work, with only Charlie's mom coming across as over the top/farcical in her performance, (though it's still not too far-out and, thankfully, her needed presence is brief). Chris Sarandon as new pain-in-the-neck neighbor Jerry Dandridge is smooth & suave yet also frighteningly threatening... yet still a little sad. Young William Ragsdale makes for a wholesomely good all-American boy next door as our hero, Charlie Brewster. Amanda Bearse, as Charlie's girlfriend Amy, is both a quirky cutie pie and a smoldering seductress (post neck-bite). Stephen Geoffreys is hilarious and appropriately scatterbrained as Charlie's dorky monster nerd pal, 'Evil' Ed. And rounding out the main cast, is legendary thesp Roddy McDowell, playing an in-joke former sort-of 'star' as Peter Vincent. Vincent is on his last legs; eking out a living milking his tarnished status as a former horror film icon to host a chintzy local late night creature feature TV show (which, much to his bitter disappointment, has just been cancelled). He lives in the rose-colored past, pompously clinging to his former (not so glorious) glory days. The character arc for Peter is wonderful, and lifelong yeoman actor McDowell masterfully exploits his character's hidden strengths and abundant weaknesses to their fullest. His transformation from bitter, self-important fop to fearless slayer of all things evil is a joy to behold. (And his quiet monologue in his apartment when Amy & Ed come to visit him is unexpectedly touching.) Truthfully, the man should've gotten the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance, or at the very least a nomination. He did however win the Saturn Award in that category that year, so his work in FRIGHT NIGHT wasn't completely ignored.

THE BLU-RAY/DVD COMBO SET: I wasn't sure about ordering this, as it was a non-US release, but took a chance based on the recommendations of other Amazon customers. Shouldn't have worried. This Blu plays just fine in Region 1 machines. The picture & sound jump in quality from the old DVD release is like day & night. A 4k restoration results in a super-sharp picture, with little in the way of dirt & debris not much artifacting, pixelation, edge-enhancement nor crush to spoil it. Vibrant color palette, without accursed over-saturation, bleeding or the villainous use of DNR to ruin the original vision of the cinematographer & the director. Likewise, the soundtrack & audiomix are worlds improved. The mix is properly balanced here now, allowing you to fully enjoy composer Brad Fidel's haunting, sensual score, without it overpowering the dialogue scenes. The BIG bonus for fans of the film is the wealth of fantastic bonus features, the best of which is a thoroughly exhaustive 'Making of...' piece that's almost two and half hours long!!! Lots of other great stuff is included as well. This Blu-ray/DVD combo will likely be THE definitive edition to own for some time to come. Do yourself a favor and buy this! (Score some brownie points with a friend who doesn't yet have a Blu-ray player and give them the DVD .)",1514332800,3,4421,5.021798365122616
13715,5,0767817664,Just recieved this. Case is cheaply made but thats not my concern. The bluray transfer looks fantastic on my 4k tv. It plays perfectly on my PS4 if anyone had questions about that. Very happy,1514073600,,191,4.485714285714286

13717,5,0767817664,"Let me start by clarifying that this version of Fright Night (1985) Blu-ray plays on American Blu-ray players. I thought I should clarify this first because there are inconsistencies about the way this particular version is presented on Amazon. For instance, the link for the product says [Region Free] but then on the Product Description it says Region B (won't play on most Blu-ray players in America) but then down below there is another note that says ""it will play on American Blu-ray players"". The product link says ""Blu-ray only"" but the sticker on the product image says Blu-ray/DVD Dual copy. I was confused so I called Amazon customer service. Agent, after putting me on brief hold, told me that the item is Region B only and probably won't play on American Blu-ray players. But because I trust Amazon's return policy,  I decided to take the chance and purchase. I thought to myself, if it didn't play I could always return it to Amazon. I am glad I did that. As soon as I inserted the disc to my Blu-ray player (Sony 4K Blu-ray player ubp x800), it played without any issues. My other 4K Blu-ray Player, Samsung UBD-KMC85C also plays it without any issues. And it is dual copy, there is a Blu-ray disc and a DVD.

This is a Christmas wish come true as Fright Night Blu-ray has been the most elusive Blu-ray commodity in the past 10 years. There are many other Blu-ray versions, there is a German Blu-ray version, I believe there is also a Blu-ray Australian version none of which were playable on American Blu-ray players. Then there was the 30th anniversary Blu-ray edition that was released in 2015 that was sold out quickly. Now, finally there is a Fright Night Blu-ray version UK import that plays on American Blu-ray players.

Picture and audio quality is excellent. They did a fantastic job with the transfer. I watch it on LG OLED 55C7 TV. Make sure you go to audio settings and select 5.1 surround sound (if you have surround sound system) because the audio setting is default to stereo selection.

There are tons of special features all of which are listed on the product description - not inconsistency there. They are all on the Blu-ray disc. If you love this movie and concerned about the Blu-ray format, you should not have any fears. You should definitely add this to  your collection, turn off your lights and enjoy Fright Night on Blu-ray....for real :)",1513382400,8,2380,4.684210526315789

13735,5,0767817664,Classic vampire movie! I think this and The Lost Boys were the two best vampire flicks of the 80's...,1501804800,,101,4.368421052631579
13736,5,0767817664,"This is an old favorite and, having just seen it for the first time in 15+ years, I can see why. The practical effects and humor hold up surprisingly well and the gore is pretty feisty.  Not at all scary, just loads of gross fun.

Charley (William Ragsdale; Fright Night 2, The Reaping), his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse; Married with Children) and his quirky friend Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys; 976-Evil, The Chair, and according to IMDB a bunch of porn) discover that his new neighbor Jerry (Chris Sarandon; The Resurrected, The Sentinel) is actually a vampire!

This 80s horror classic boasts the standard teen tropes when, upon Charleys initial discovery of his blood-drinking neighbor, he starts yelling vampire to everyone (his mother, the police) and, not surprisingly, no one listens to this nonsense.  But thankfully his buddy Ed knows the tricks of the monstrous trade (for some reason; not unlike the Frog Brothers of The Lost Boys).  Also following the standard yet somewhat pleasing tropes of the time, his mother grants invitation to her very single fanged suitor (again, followed suit by The Lost Boys).

Our vampire snacks on apples for dental health, makes some idle threats to a teenager, strangles and toys with the kid when he could have just ripped his head off, and is thwarted by a pencil wound to the hand.  However silly, this all leads us down a rabbit hole of more exaggerated antics when Charley canvases his room with rosaries, crosses, garlic and candles (he must have a big allowance) and then our teenaged protagonists enlist the help of television horror host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall; Embryo, Shakma, Fright Night 2), who happens to be an actual expert when it comes to dealing with the fanged undead.

And lets not forget the needlessly long seduction dance scene which, given this film is pretty old, gets me wondering if it wasn't one of the first movies with such a scene (i.e., a long dance scene whose entire purpose was to be sexy or to seduce, LOL).  There was Return of the Living Dead (1985), although not deliberately seductive there was A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddys Revenge (1985), I only mention the Lost Boys (1987) because that singer might have gotten that saxophone pregnant, perhaps the undead ballerina solo in Evil Dead 2 (1987), then of course there was Night of the Demons (1988) and Night of the Demons 2 (1994) with their blatant and numerous demonic sexy dances.

The first hour of the movie offers little in the way of gore and some decent semi-scary vampire make-up, but in the final 30 minutes things get really good.  I mean, its still silly.  But this movie features a looong gory death scene that doubles as a gooey transformation scene (to a werewolf-looking form), a super disgusting melting death, a huge and ugly vampire bat, and the monstrously over-sized vampire mouth that would subsequently be used in the Fright Night (2011) remake and the From Dusk til Dawn (1996) films.

Director Tom Holland (Childs Play, The Temp, Thinner) really hit this one out of the park.  There are no scares, nor are there meant to be, although the monsters look menacing enough.  This is entirely funsometimes funny, sometimes gross-out gory, but always a rewatchable joy that withstands the test of time.",1501200000,2,3271,4.857913669064748

Fright Night is still a fun movie, overall, but it has not dated very well. The music, the look of it, is all very very 80's. The effects are good, but nothing spectacularly better then other films of the time. And none of the actors are putting their best foot forward. Roddy McDowell and another actor share a scene near the end that does manage to capture some real pathos, but other then that it's all too campy, with writing and plot that doesn't support that choice. Camp acting in a dark and serious plot is just not a good mix.",1474502400,,780,4.277027027027027

13791,5,0767817664,"Fright Night is a pretty cool 80's comedy horror family market aimed film.  Some special effects look a bit dated today, and the street, alleyways and some places look studio lot tour fake rather than the real thing, but Fright Night also has some cool puppet creatures that still look really cool more than 30 years after the movie originally came out such as the wolf and its transformations post running into Peter Vincent, the bat that also fights with VIncent looks awesome too.  If you liked Gremlins and haven't seen this, that's the sort of level of puppet special effects you get with Fright Night.  Way better than CGI creatures that appear in films today.

Roddy McDowall does a great job playing an olden days movie hero who doesn't believe in vampires then is forced to be what he plays on screen.  William Ragsdale does a pretty good job as a teen who is a big fan of old horror movies and is convinced his new neighbour isn't just a serial killer but a vampire as well.  Stephen Geoffreys does a great job too as his fellow high school loser friend who likes to make fun of him at every opportunity.  It's a bit odd seing Amanda Bearse playing a supposed teenager when of course she was more well known for playing the parent age Marcy from Married With Children that would have been on air only a year or two after this hit cinema screens. She even has the same Marcy haircut.  She definitely looks way older than a teenager, though granted so does Ragsdale, but not to the same extent.

But you can forgive the obvious older than characters thing, as Fright Night is simply a fun movie.  Fun horror and kid friendly horror.  They don't make many like this anymore.",1471824000,,1681,4.496710526315789

The cast is terrific with William Ragsdale and Roddy McDowell as our heroes and Chris Sarandon in a fantastic villainous vampire performance. Also Stephen Geoffreys gives a great and really bizarre performance as well. I love 80s horror films and just 80s films in general and Fright Night has some of the best 80s style of any film of the 80s with its lighting, music and cinematography. The infamous and outstanding dance club scene is one of the best and biggest highlights of the film. Fright Night is a lot of fun along with the extremely rare and underrated sequel. Stay far away from the remake though. A must own for horror buffs especially of 80s horror. Other notable fantastic vampire films are the masterpiece Let Me In, From Dusk till Dawn, John Carpenter's Vampires, Tales from the crypts Bordello of blood and the other classic 80s vampire flicks The Lost Boys, Near Dark and the hugely underrated Vamp.",1470441600,,1067,4.772972972972973

As much as I liked David Tenant in Doctor Who, he is no Roddy Mcdowall. Mcdowall's portrayal of a nervous, less-than-confident actor turned vampire hunter Peter Vincent is far superior. The original version also lacks the constant foul language of the new one.

The charm of the original version, is that it has a very traditional feel to it, like watching a modern version of a vampire movie from the 50's or 60's. You have the traditional religious symbol (cross, holy water, etc..) lacking in the new version which feels like a typical modern horror movie, more interested in foul language and heavy secularism. almost all traditional vampire elements are removed from the new version.

13915,5,0767817664,"High school student, Charlie Brewster is a horror movie nerd and occasionally stays up late to watch his favorite show, titled Fright Night, which is hosted by his hero, Peter Vincent. One night, while spying on a beautiful woman having sex with his new neighbor, Jerry Dandrige, Charlie comes to the conclusion that he's a vampire after seeing his inhumane sharp fingers and seeing him drag a coffin into the basement.

Charlie tries to convince everyone from his adorably cute girlfriend, Amy; to his mom, Judy; to his annoying friend, Ed, and even the police that Jerry is a vampire, but they all think he's bluffing and that all the horror movies have finally gone to his head. After causing so much trouble, Jerry confronts Charlie one night and threatens to make him the next victim. When his friends and family won't believe him, Charlie turns to his idol, the washed up, has-been, Peter Vincent as a last resort. Can Charlie manage to prove to everyone that Jerry Dandrige is a vampire or will his convictions lead to his last stand?

Overall: I don't know if it's necessary to classify Fright Night as a horror, but maybe more of a thriller. It lacks true scares, but it has its creepy moments and delivers to a T in the entertainment department. It has its comical moments, but for the most part it's a gripping story that pulls you in within the first 10 minutes and keeps you captivated until the end. They couldn't have picked a better person than Chris Sarandon to play the role of Jerry Dandrige. He's got the smooth looks, an easy going tone in his voice, and a sly personality that makes him the perfect, dangerous vampire. Stephen Geoffreys, who commonly got the role of the nerdy kid back in the day pulls off the annoying, pesky, nerdy friend of ""Evil Ed"" really well. The make-up effects that went into giving the vamps their true form in this movie are extremely impressive and definitely give a meaning to the word, creep. Fright Night also has a great soundtrack, with the most notable piece being the captivating instrumental version of Come To Me by Brad Fiedel. A similar movie by the name, Lost Boys would make its way out 2 years later and was just as amazing as Fright Night. Overall, Fright Night is a treat as a whole and one of the best and most popular ""horror"" vampire flicks to ever be made. Awesome plot, spectacular performances, grade A effects, amazing soundtrack. This movie has it all. You can't be a horror/thriller fan and not enjoy Fright Night",1443830400,,2489,4.64172335600907

13919,2,0767817664,"I am amazed that this film gets so many positive reviews. I love horror films, and I want them to be scary, frightening, etc. I'm not a big fan of the horror comedy genre. There are a few good ones. But, this is not one of them. This is simply a bad comedy, and there are no real jokes here -- just kind of ""stupid comedy"": the characters constantly simply act stupidly, and that is supposed to be funny. There is nothing clever here. There is no believable character, with the exception of Roddy MacDowell. He is the one saving grace, and his professional acting ability shines way above the rest. He is playing a comically ""reluctant"" vampire killer, who doesn't really believe in vampires but plays a vampire killer in his films and on TV. Now he has to actually kill a vampire, after he finally comes to believe they are real. Thankfully, Roddy MacDowall is in this film. But the plot, the other actors, the ""jokes"" are really bad. The special effects are mostly consisting of ""melting faces"", and were done on the cheap. Good special effects for the time and for a low budget -- but, not very good for scaring the audience. At the time this was made (1985) perhaps it deserved good reviews as a send-up of horror films. But, it really does not stand the test of time, in my opinion.

There is a remake (2011) that actually is fairly good.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fright-Night/dp/B003Y5H5FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fright Night</a>.

13922,4,0767817664,"For a very long time, this remained on my wish list. Despite its being held in high regard, I feared Fright Night would be a half-witted foray into my favorite genre (the vampire film) since it had a cheesy aura to it and was produced smack dab in the middle of a decade I have no wish to relive. I also was awaiting a rerelease of the Blu-ray version that came with extras: this never rematerialized, so now the Region A Blu-ray is fetching exorbitant prices (perhaps it is being mistaken for the Screenarchives version, which was limited to 3000 copies worldwide).

Sure enough, upon watching I found Fright Night replete with the worst of 1980s culture and topped with Cheez Whiz (the nightclub scene was particularly unbearable). Nonetheless, the special effects are both intentionally and unintentionally humorous, the story mildly creative (although predictable), and the 106 minutes not wasted. Stephen Geoffreys as ""Evil Ed"" was so over the top that he actually was a pleasure to watch, inciting laughter despite what passes as funny in the 21st century. And honestly, the special effects are still commendable for a pre-CGI world, right down to the uncomfortable custom contact lenses made for the vamped out actors. Considering that vampire films need to be graded on a curve, Fright Night remains a work worth watching, if only for some laughs.

The Region Free Blu-ray version (Dutch import) of Fright Night looks fantastic! If considering DVD still, check out this double feature that is currently dirt cheap:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fright-Night-Urban-Legend-Two-pack/dp/B001DB6J5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fright Night / Urban Legend (Two-pack)</a>.",1440720000,2,1717,5.549618320610687

14008,5,0767817664,"Rating is for the film, not this edition that scalpers are selling for more than it is worth.  This early Twilight Time Blu-Ray release of Fright Night arrived 3 years ago (in 2011).  At the time, Twilight Time was still young as a company and worked out a few deals with other companies to secure releases that the bigger studios deemed not popular to release on their own.  In the three years since, TT has grown significantly themselves and has started securing extras for their Blu-Ray releases.  Though limited to 3000 copies generally, some titles proved popular enough that TT has been able to re-release a few titles (Fright Night being one of the four re-releases).  The new edition can be purchased directly from screenarchives.com (whom Twilight Time has partnered with as their Blu-Ray distributor).
It has a wealth of extras such as two commentary tracks, a Fright Night reunion panel from FearFest 2 (from 2008), Vintage EPK with Behind-the-Scenes Raw Footage, among others.  It won't last but at $29.95 it's a bargain, especially since the original TT FN release is out of print.

14026,5,0767817664,"80'S Classic Horror film Fright night finally gets the respect it deserves after 30 years now
there has been more than one blu-ray release of Fright night since 2010
the Sony pictures German release which is ALL REGIONS
the Sony pictures U.K. and U.S. releases which are ALL REGIONS anyway
but are barebones releases, have no extras on them at all except for Theatrical trailer
for some reason a big mainstream Distributor like Sony pictures who owned the rights to Fright night
did not bother giving this film any special treatment at all which is tragic

in the end it took a Independent Distributor TWILIGHT TIME to finally give this film new special features
that it Deserves
this new 30th Anniversary edition is the 2nd Twilight time reissue of Fright night
Twilight time's first blu-ray release was back in 2011 which was s*** release, had no new special features at all, waste of money
well Twilight time decided to re-release it again as 30th Anniversary blu-ray
the picture quality looks beautiful, very sharp & clear in 2:35:1 widescreen hardly no Grain/Dirt at all
 with an all new 5.1 Master audio mix to the sound quality which does boost the sound quality aswell

there's new special features this time
tragically thou no new retrospective Documentary with cast & crew interviews which is what i was expecting
instead twilight time have given fans these special features
FRIGHT NIGHT REUNION PANEL-FEAR FEST 2
professional filmed back in 2008 at a Fear fest convention, not amateur filmed from someone in the Audience
this reunion panel is a 55mins Q & A moderated by Rob Galluzo
with only the cast from the film except for Roddy McDowall of course who passed away many years ago
Tom Holland, Chris sarandon, william Ragsdale, Johnathon stark, Amanda Bearse & Stephen Geoffreys
are on the Panel, Julie carmen & Tommy lee wallace from Fright night II are also on the panel at the end of the table
there are couple questions from Audience about Fright night II so Tommy lee wallace does talk about the film
the Audio quality is a bit off throughout the 55mins so you have to listen closely to the comments from the
cast on the panel
personally i would've preferred new retrospective interviews with Tom Holland, Chris sarandon, william ragsdale etc

Doesn't stop there,
there's also a new pro filmed 25min interview with Tom Holland himself a Shock til you Drop featurette
Tom Holland talks about his early writing career, talks about Fright night
this new interview is split into 3 parts for some reason, very pathetic
the whole interview could easily be played as a whole 25mins interview for sure instead it's been split into 3 parts, how stupid
still is a very interesting 25mins

and Twilight time has also added a vintage EPK Behind the scenes footage goes for 70mins
all the footage was filmed back in 1984 when the film was being made for a 1985 Theatrical release
mainly contains Promo TV interviews with all the cast and some of the crew
very Indepth detailed interviews with
Tom Holland, Chris sarandon, william ragsdale, Amanda bearse, Roddy McDowall, stephen Geoffreys.
special effects makeup artist Richard edlund is also interviewed which is the Highlight for me
Richard talks alot about the special effects in the film and how it was a Big challenge to do because of no CGI effects

plus 2 Video clips of the J Geils band performing Fright night single plus interview with the J Geils band
the Promo TV interviews and the Video clips are not seperated on the special features menu
looks like Twilight time got the footage and just quickly added the whole raw footage directly on the blu-ray
without editing and no separating, which i think is very pathetic it shows Twilight time were being lazy
when it came to doing the special features
so you can't use skip button on the remote, you have to use the fast forward button if you want to skip something
there is lots of blank screen in between the Video clips & the promo TV interviews
the first 20mins is the 2 Video clips plus an interview with J Geils band
the rest is the cast & crew interviews
still are very interesting 70mins of watching behind the scenes footage making the film

there's stills & memorabilia Gallery from Tom Hollands archives
plus you get 2 new Audio commentary tracks aswell
1st commentary is with Tom Holland, and Actors Chris sarandon & Jonathon stark
moderated by Filmmaker Tim sullivan
2nd commentary is with Tom Holland, william ragsdale, stephen Geoffreys and FX artist Randall cook
moderated by Filmmaker Tim sullivan
both commentaries are very informative & worth listening to
moderater Tim sullivan keeps Tom Holland and chris sarandon and others on track for the fans that are listening

and you also get the different Theatrical release versions of the film
for some very stupid reason Twilight time only released this as Limited edition release for $30 which has sold out now
so you can only get a copy from a ebay seller from Ebay for over $100 just for the blu-ray
i was very lucky to get a copy for only $80 plus the shipping on top
there's now lots of sellers on amazon that are selling their copies from $100 and up

if your a big fan of Fright night like myself, Definitely worth the cash to get a copy for sure
the Sony pictures blu-ray versions are barebones terrible versions
so your better of saving some cash and getting the 30th anniversary version by Twilight time
5 stars i gave it based on so much special feature content on 1 Disc",1415145600,,5463,4.724029380902413

This marketing strategy is really stupid and is the reason the black market is kicking your Buttocks! 3000 copies and then out of print, it is laughable.

And I think a lot of it is because my favorite character in the entire movie is Evil Dead...he's like the same character as Corey Feldman in Bordello of Blood. He was lonely outcast teenager who gets turned into a vampire, not these weird T2 Super-Killer vampires some people are expecting, and as I've said before Shut Up! That is Not what vampires are about; and that's why I have no interest in seeing the Re-make; cause that is exactly what they're trying to do....so next topic.....Love and Marriage---She actually makes a pretty good vampire....it's kind of that funny Judd Nelson Way too old to be in High school joke, plus Charlie seems more like he'd date someone more like Sissy Spaceck in Carrie, not someone old enough to be his mother....but I do like the cool club scene with that great song that fit So perfectly.....and I liked how she was like one of the Three Sister vampires Dracula always has (odd though that they always say sisters) But why did they have to kill off Evil Dead? He was a great vampire and they killed him off! They did that in Bordello of Blood with Corey---Why?  These vampires without souls aren't Always hurting people and that ---when you're looking at Evil Dead you're not looking at your friend you're looking at the thing that killed him....Shut Up! I've Never bought into that, cause for one thing, not only is that Not the case we're back to talking about those stupid T-2 Vampires again, I mean--yeah sometimes you get one like Luke, in the 1st episode of Buffy (who I did like, also as The Judge and as The Silence of The Lambs guy in Joe Dirt, but I just think that's a cool actor...so once again Enough!

14090,4,0767817664,"One of the better 80's horror films, Fright Night takes a slightly new twist on an old story and entertains us the whole way through.

 Charlie spies on his new neighbors and discovers one of them is a suave vampire named Jerry Dandridge, but it's not always easy to convince doubting friends, and Charlie has a hell of a time getting his pal Evil Ed and girlfriend Amy to see the light. The addition of Charlie being a young teenage horror fan was pretty clever on Holland's part. Because of his fascination with the dark side, it limits his credibility when he start spewing off about ancient vampires right next door.

 Unfortunately time is running out and Jerry knows he knows, and knows he knows that he knows he knows. And yes, something in there makes sense. In desperation Charlie tries to get the help of a horror monster show host Peter Vincent (nix the name Peter Cushing and Vincent Price). Things don't go as planned but the guy grudgingly agrees to try and assist; from then on we're on our way to a knee-jerking climax.

 The major strength of this film lies in Christopher Sarandon's bi-sexual portrayal of Jerry. This man is a wet dream come true and makes every shot pure gold. He has the personality of old-world vampire charm and it's really a shame I haven't seen him in more horror (although he's been in plenty). Every time he's on the set my eyes remain glued to the screen and my glands start salivating. Maybe I should stop now while I'm ahead...

 His daywatcher/human servant (Billy Cole) is creepy in a way and his cup holds its own volume of twisted charm. Amanda Bearse (pre-Married with Children) shows up as Amy and does a surprisingly good job as a cute, bubbly, and interesting side-character. Charlie (William Ragsdale), the main character, does the role well and his friend Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) plays the part to a tee but his character is a little annoying. Another great charm is the cowardly vampire hunter Peter (Roddy McDowall) -- he brings plenty of humor when he walks in. A recently fired, non-believer he has to be convinced but when he sees it's real his knees begin to shake and his pants become a little wet but this just makes it all the more comical.

 This movie isn't frightening but it's not meant to be. It does have some nail-biting suspenseful moments -- especially when Dandridge pays a visit to Charlie's house and visits with him and his mother. There's also a good dosage of comedy but never goofy. Lot's of old time spoof nods to past vampire legends and rules of the trade in a flattering, fun way. A nice nod to the 80's, it had some great music that enhanced and never took away from the quality. (Tangerine Dream -- Firestarter; and Brad Fiedel (The Terminator, Serpent of the Rainbow)

I own a Blu-ray copy and purchased it for $29.99 from Screen Archives Entertainment (the issuing company) in October of 2011 when it was released. If I ever sold it, I would do so at a FAIR price of $20.00 because one, it has been viewed over 12 times now, and two, it is not my intention to rip people off.

This movie is surely the benchmark by which all other vampire films should be measured. But, why rip people off to get rid of it? I don't, can't, and never will understand human greed. You people all sicken me. The reason you haven't sold your Blu-ray copies is not because the movie is not popular. It is. You haven't sold your copies because you are trying to steal from your buying public. It's too bad Amazon has not shut you down yet, worse, that they allow it.

14158,3,0767817664,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this vampire movie...

Fright Night (1985) is a cheesy vampire movie that blends horror and humor and is straight from the heart of the 1980s.  The best performance is by Roddy McDowall, who plays a vampire hunter.  Personally, I don't really care for vampire movies that are campy.  I like my vampire movies scary and more serious, such as my all-time favorite vampire movie, Salem's Lot (1979).  Or, a lot of the Dracula movies over the years.  Some of the Hammer vampire and Dracula movies have moments of borderline cheesiness, however, it's all made up for with serious horror, scary vampires, and lots of blood.

Fright Night does not make my list of ""My Top 13 Vampire Movies"".  I would rank Fright Night probably 20-something at best.  It's a decent movie, but not one I would want to watch multiple times.  I must say, though, that it's FAR better than those horrible Twilight movies.  I would rank those Twilight movies around 224th on my list of favorite vampire movies.",1362268800,,1061,4.737704918032787

14161,5,0767817664,"Charley Brewster has a problem... It seems his neighbor may be a vampire, so he has enlisted the help of his friends and local celebrity Peter Vincent to oust the fanged fiend from the neighborhood, but his toothy adversary won't be going without a fight. ""Welcome to Fright Night!"" Tom Holland brings us his own hilarious homage to the traditions of Gothic Horror in the 1985 classic. The clever plays on genre conventions are pleasing to any Horror fan, as Holland exploits the vampire mythos for maximum effect. Cloves of garlic, crosses, holy water... All of the standard rules still apply, but it is how Holland uses them that casts such a sharp reflection on the Universal and Hammer films. FRIGHT NIGHT is filled with wonderful performances from the entire cast, beginning with William Ragsdale in a coy lead as the paranoid Charley Brewster. Roddy McDowall's campy portrait of Peter Vincent, vampire hunter, is a wonderful caricature of the characters played by both Peter Cushing and Vincent Price. The homage to DRACULA in which McDowall discovers that Jerry is truly a vampire is a shining moment in the film. Stephen Geoffreys is just as amusing as Charley's eccentric friend, ""Evil"" Ed Thompson, whose shrill, nasally voice and wicked sense of humor have made him a fan favorite for years. And then, of course, there is Chris Sarandon as the vampire Jerry Dandridge. Sarandon brings all of the same suave sophistication and courtly manner as his Gothic counterparts, yet he never feels out of place amidst the modern setting. The film's wit is only matched by its incredible special effects, which give a horrifying new look to its vampire hosts. With the help of NEAR DARK and THE LOST BOYS, FRIGHT NIGHT helped to reinvigorate the vampire film in the 1980's, and it has since endured to reach a cult status in Horror.

14200,5,0767817664,"Ok first off the 2011 remake was horrible don't buy it, full of lousy acting and even worse CGI in almost every scene,infact the best part of the remake is the end credits. I wonder who the studio executives think want to see these remakes. The original Fright Night takes you back to a great time the 80's there is no internet, smart phones, CGI and the characters don't tweet in every scene. The story is great about a young all american boy next door Charlie Brewster  who loves classic horror films and wants to score with his girlfriend. The trouble begins when a vampire moves in next door. As the film shifts into gear he now has a ticked off vampire after him and his friend ""Evil Ed"" and his girlfriend Amy don't believe the guy next door is a vampire. The only one he can turn to is the local TV horror host Peter Vincent. The two then do battle with this vampire in a great fight sequence. This film creates an excellent atmosphere set in an all american town instead of cheesy Las Vegas and Roddy Mcdowell is brilliant as the Horror host Peter vincent. To bad they don't show horror films on local TV anymore, I mean seriously those were the days of great old horror films being shown by a horror host dressed like a ghoul or some other creature of the night. By the way""Evil Ed"" steals the show and is not a whiny geek like in the remake. The film also pays homage to the classic Uniiversal horror films as well as the Hammer films you can see little signs of both hear and there in the background. So if your tired of crapy, wimpy, sissy vampire fare such as True Blood and the Twilight films buy 1985's Fright Night. I just wish there were more special features other than the trailer, c'mon not even a tribute to the late Roddy Mcdowell.",1346803200,4,1753,4.328267477203648

14217,5,0767817664,"I realize this movie is going on 30 years old.  It might seem ""old"" to many viewers.  But the fact that it is colorfully set in suburban America of the mid-80's, and not in some B&W Hollywood version of Transylvania, (complete with creepy castles and torch bearing villagers) - make it, to me at least, a more or less modern day setting.  Certainly contemporary for its time, and with very few exceptions, it has maintained a fresh and modern look about it.

Charlie Brewster, a typically under-achieving teen, seems to have but two passions in his life:  His love of horror movies, locally presented on late night TV by faded B-movie actor Peter Vincent.  And his girlfriend Amy, whose pants Charlie is desperately trying to get into.  When he spots his new next door neighbor carrying what looks like a coffin into his house late one night, the stage is set for one of the funniest, scariest, and most entertaining vampire films ever made.  All of the aforementioned events take place during the first five minutes.  After that, it's just full-on frightening fun.  Charlie soon begins spying on his neighbor from his bedroom window, and quickly learns just what the purpose of that sinister looking coffin is!

Beautifully crafted, well-written, and expertly acted, Fright Night delivers the goods on so many levels.  The scares work, the humor works, and the expertly done special effects hold their own against any other film of the period.  Chris Sarandon is perfect as vampire Jerry Dandridge.  His outward demeanor exudes a cool, sexy charm, while beneath burns the vicious, tortured monster who will stop at nothing to get what he wants (in this case, Charlie's girlfriend Amy), and ensure his own survival.  Roddy McDowall gives a brilliantly hammy performance as Peter Vincent, the ""great vampire killer"" from his long-since passed days in low budget horror movies.  I simply cannot imagine any other two actors playing those roles (I have yet to see the 2011 remake).  I suppose any two good young actors of the day could have played Charlie and Amy, but William Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse made those roles their own.  And Stephen Geoffreys delivers a wonderfully likable comic portrayal of Charlie's friend, ""Evil"" Ed.

The film takes a very deliberate timeline, deftly maintaining a perfect balance between the humor and the horror.  In many ways, it goes one better in that department than my other favorite horror/comedy from the 80's, An American Werewold In London.  As much as I love AAWIL, the humor in it can occasionally seem a bit forced or out of place.  Not so in Fright Night.  It hits all the marks in perfect sequence, and results in a delightfully scary roller coaster ride of a movie.

As I mentioned, I have not seen last year's remake with Colin Farrell and David Tennant, so I cannot compare the two.  I will have to make it a point to watch it someday.  But I have seen the direct sequel to 1985's Fright Night, and while entertaining in its own way, it simply cannot hold a stake to the original.  To me, the original Fright Night became an instant classic immediately upon its release, with its perfect blend of acting, story, and direction, the latter two both courtesy of Tom Holland (Child's Play, also with Chris Sarandon).  A perfect example of fun film making from the 80's that has scarcely aged at all, and today is as fresh, frightening, and funny as it was almost three decades ago.  Fright Night is... for REAL...!",1340150400,3,3460,4.797297297297297

14222,5,0767817664,"Fright Night has been one of my favourite horror films since I saw it on VHS in the mid-eighties at the tender age of eleven. Even before I watched it, a friend told me the premise and it immediately seemed tantalising. Not for one moment did my eyes leave the screen.
The highlights of course are veteran actors McDowall and Sarandon who turn in perfect performances as the cowardly TV host and vampire respectively. Much like many films of this genre in the 80's, they were a labour of love for the filmmakers; Tom Holland wrote and directed as did Richard Wenk with Vamp. Yes, they are camp and a little dated these days, but the hard work shows on screen. The special effects were probably quite elaborate for the time, but hokey or not, aren't they meant to look a little crooked? Afterall, Fright Night is a wink and a nod to all those late night horror movies we loved staying up to watch as a child - Peter Vincent (PETER Cushing/VINCENT Price)!!
And now we have it on glorious Blu-Ray with a DTSHD audio track, and a bonus audio track of Brad Fiedel's floral music score. A gift for any fan. The film stock used to shoot the movie probably wasn't the best as the colour scheme's don't quite jump off the screen as I'd hoped, but it's a clean enough transfer in mighty 2.40:1 aspect ratio.

14224,4,0767817664,"This review is strictly on the movie itself, not the DVD.

Fright Night, a 1985 horror film that combined the elements of horror and comedy, is another winner from the 1980's and is one of the best films that the decade had to offer.

This film offered a unique perspective from the point of view of a young man who lives in a very peaceful neighborhood, who one day, discovers that his new neighbor living next door is an actual vampire.

The film starts with a young man named Charlie Brewster(William Ragsdale)watching his favorite TV show, called Fright Night, with his girlfriend Amy Peterson(Amanda Bearse)when he hears and sees that there is a new person living next door that is strangely moving in during the middle of the night. Soon, after seeing a familiar face on the TV news, that of a known prostitute that he saw the previous evening and also, after accidently witnessing his neighbor Jerry Dandridge(Chris Sarandon)with fangs and about to bite a young lady on the neck, he realizes that he has a vampire living next door to him and tells people that he knows about it and the reaction that he gets is one of disbelief. After surviving an attack by his neighbor, where Charlie stabs his hand with a sharp pencil and in revenge, the vampire totals Charlie's classic Mustang. He first goes to his some time friend ""Evil Ed"" Thompson(Stephen Geoffreys)and asks him for advice on how to defeat and destroy the vampire living next door to him. Also, in desperation, he turns to his hero, the host of Fright Night, Peter Vincent(Roddy MacDowall, may he rest in peace), who was a big star in early films as ""The Famous Vampire Killer"" and hopes that Mr. Vincent will believe him and hopefully, help him do something about him. After a few failed attempts, Mr. Vincent accidently discovers that Charlie's neighbor is indeed a vampire as Dandridge cast no reflection in his pocket mirror. After that, Dandridge decides to go out and follows Charlie, Evil Ed and Amy throughout the town. Evil Ed abandons them and winds up becoming Dandridge's victim by biting him. Charlie and Amy try to hide out in a dance club, but Amy winds up under the spell of the vampire and doesn't notice that Dandridge casts no reflection and after a scuffle in the club that has Dandridge kidnap Amy and orders that Charlie and Peter Vincent come to his house if they ever want to see Amy stay a mortal, but it is actually a trick as Amy has already been bitten and it is up to Charlie and Peter to stop Dandridge before he does it to somebody else or the rest of the human race. Again, I won't give too much away as I don't want to spoil it for anyone who might not have seen this movie as of yet.

Writer/Director Tom Holland effectively blends horror and comedy together to create a very unique viewing experience. The film will scare the daylights of you and will have you on the edge of your seat, but will also make you laugh a little because this film does teter on the edge of spoof. It doesn't skimp on the scares nor does it skimp on the laughs as you will both be scared and be laughing a little as this film entertains very well. The film is well acted, well written and wonderfully directed by Tom Holland as he keeps the pace going and the action never lets up until the bitter end. Tom Holland works wonders with his script and his direction. It all works. It is a fun filled scary and funny movie that never gets dull no matter how many times you watch it.

PROS: The DVD has the movie looking great with the audio sounding terrific. The soundtrack also sounds wonderful. The film is available in both FullScreen (Side 1)and WideScreen (Side 2)

CONS: No special features like a commentary by the crew, cast or both. No behind the scenes featurettes and no interviews by the cast and crew reflecting on their time working on and making the movie and the fun that they had working on it. The only feature is the theatrical trailer for the movie. I suppose that the theatrical trailer is better than nothing, but still, it would have been better if the DVD had a lot more to offer.

Despite the shortcomings, it is wonderful to have this classic 1980's film on DVD.

I watched this back in 1986 on HBO while spending the night at my sister's house and I enjoyed it immensely. Years later, I would buy a VCR and I would buy this film on VHS, alongside it's sequel Fright Night Part 2, and I still enjoyed it as much as I did when I first saw it on HBO. I now have the DVD and that is great as well. I still enjoy this film immensely as this film is a very entertaining movie from both their respective genres and from the decade that it was released.

Overall, Fright Night is one of the best films that the 1980's had to offer and also, one of the best horror films ever made. If you are a fan of horror, comedy or both, this movie is for you and if you saw this movie back in the day and enjoyed it then, get the DVD so you can rediscover it and enjoy it once again. No fan of horror, comedy or both should be without this classic film of the 1980's, which helped define what the 1980's were all about. This is must have for anyone who loves films of the 1980's and lovers of horror films, lovers of comedy films or both.",1326585600,2,5221,4.385330578512397

As for the movie itself, I like it. It has a tongue and cheek feel with some great gore. Roddy Mcdowall hands in an excellent performance and the vampire next door story runs well from beginning to end. It's an 80's movie that was on the ""B"" shelf with mostly unknown actors, barring of course Mr. McDowall, it transcended its genre and budget. When I saw it as a teenager when released to theaters I was very surprised by it and I think it has withstood the test of time.

I got mine thankfully because the sellers on here are charging alot more than I paid for it.  35.00 is what they paid for it , as did I. , and they are jacking up the price on you. sadly this only had 3,000 copies made for some dumb reason. I think that eventually this will come out in a regular edition and I will see it five years from now for ten dollars. But maybe not. SO I had no choice; as I loved this version of the movie ever since I saw it at the theater in 1985. the picture looks alot better on this blu ray for sure.  go online to search for a copy if you want one , maybe there is a copy left at 34.00 including shipping. That's what I paid. And perhaps if you wait ,years from now or sooner this will be released again. maybe. it's a bad idea to do limited edition things in my opinion. when I ordered this there was less than five hundred left. so maybe by the time anyone reads this , the only hope you will have of owning this edition is buying a one of this gouging sellers blu rays.  Anyways, this is a classic movie of a nerd who wins the girl by fighting the vampire and his kin. It's alot better than the new version and it has the late great roddy mcdowell in it as the vampire hunter. It's a salute to hammer horror films and more in this modern horror classic.

They have a special deal with Sony Pictures for more experimental titles and they're only releasing 3000 copies of most.  I got this one and Mysterious Island on HD and am a very happy camper.

I'm not going to review the movie because the only reason anyone would be interested in this blu ray would be if they already have seen it.  I'm going to recommend trying to find and grabbing a copy based on the transfer and sound.  This thing has never looked this good.  Great care was taken in transferring the picture.  It looks crisp and bright, but not overly that the dark atmosphere is overshadowed.  There's no Predator like DGR in this thing.  There is grain but appropriate grain that helps give the images depth and character.  The sound is stunning.  My speakers were really getting a work out with the mix.  There's sounds that I didn't even ever remember hearing in any other viewing.  The special effects laden finale is a real showcase for the picture and sound.

Special features are a let down I'm sorry to say.  There really isn't any.  You get two trailers, which are not in HD.  And you get an isolated music score by Brad Fiedel which is AWESOME.  Fright Night has my all time favorite synth score, with Carpenter's Escape From New York right under it.  The package comes with a four page booklet with an essay going into depth of the merrits of the film in horror history.  The essay is penned by Julie Kirgo and she does a really good job of praising this film.  She hits the nail on the head regarding how much is really going on tin the subtext of this film beyond the in jokes, fun characters, gore, and frights.  The only problem is that she spends a decent amount of time talking about the gay undertones of the film.  This I don't understand.  I don't think there are any.  In retrospect you can place them there, but I don't see them there naturally.  I don't think Jerry's relationship with his live in carpenter Billy is homoerotic AT ALL.  Sorry.  Billy is Jerry's version of Refield.  That's it.  She also goes into the gay undertones involving the character of Evil Ed.  Again, I just don't think it's there.  I think he's an outcast due to his quirks and personality and nerdiness.  Jerry offers him power, not sex.  Now the actor who played Evil Ed went on to do gay porn and that's common knowledge to most horror fans at this point, but that has NOTHING to do with the film at hand.  I think some people like to place it there in retrospect due to the actor's career decisions.  Whatever.

I love this movie.  I loved it at eight years old and I still love it now all these years later.  If you can still get one of these blu rays from the above mentioned website or off of ANY other website, I hight recommend you do.  If you love this film as much as I do you won't get buyer's remorse.

PS: Inside the booklet theres a web address, iconsoffright, and it states that this site features some audio commentaries for the film.  I say why not get one included on the disc?  I gurantee director Tom Holland, Williams Ragsdale and Chris Sarandon are game.  Hell, Sarandon even contributed a wicked cameo in the recent remake which I enjoyed very much.  WAIT A MINUTE, I know all above mentioned are game!

14267,3,0767817664,"Fright Night, 1985 film

This story is more of a parody than a horror movie (like the classic ""Love at First Bite""). A family has new neighbors, two men in their thirties. Is there something funny about this couple? One of the men doesn't go out in the daytime. Neither seems to go to work (trust fund babies?). Then Charley sees a strange sight at night - one neighbor is a vampire! He tells his friends and the police, but who believes in vampire legends today? Charley seems to be a crank. The local TV station has old horror movies from long ago. This show is called ""Fright Night"". The host is Peter Vincent, a former actor. Charley contacts the host of this show because he knows how to fight vampires. [You won't find ""Vampire Killers"" listed in your local Yellow Pages.]

And so the story runs on about ridding the neighborhood of these undesirable characters. The police can't help, there is no zoning law against vampires in that city. [What about your town?] There is a complication with Charley's girlfriend. Will Amy be attacked and bitten to turn her into a vampire? If so, can she be saved by killing that vampire before sundown? There is a lot of scary action. Can Peter Vincent succeed in killing that vampire, like he did on those old shows? Of course, the good guys win in the end. You will be amused and entertained by this low-budget comic horror movie if you are not too picky about its story. Was any animal hurt in this movie?",1320105600,,1450,4.488636363636363
14268,5,0767817664,"My second favorite Vampire film of all time! ""Fright Night"" (the original) is the perfect blend of scares & laughs, as Charlie (William Ragsdale) believes his new neighbor, Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon) is a Vampire, after seeing Jerry & his roommate, Billy, carrying a coffin in to the cellar, through an outside cellar door. Murders have been happing around town with the victims head cut off, & Charlie is determined to prove he knows who the killer is, his neighbor.

Chris Sarandon puts on a marvelous performance as the Vampire, Jerry Dandrige. He is smooth, intelligent, aristocratic, has a sense of humor, & exudes loads of sexuality, like most great Vampires, male or female. There is an underlying aura of menace, to his demeanor, very subtle, but all the more powerful for it . He is a cat silently stalking it's prey, sleek, graceful, & lethal.

Charley is perfect for his role, as the prying, upstanding, though slightly inept high school boy, trying to convince everyone that Jerry is a Vampire. His friend, the scene stealing, Evil Ed, (Stephen Geoffreys, who pursued a porno star career afterwards) tells Charley all he needs to know about Vampires, for $8.00, LOL. He tells Charley his best protection right now is not to invite a Vampire in to his house, as a Vampire can not enter another's home, unless invited, so Charley feels relatively safe until his mothers calls him downstairs to meet his new neighbor, Jerry Dandrige, to Charley's horror! The tension of this scene is so real it's almost physical.

Charley finally goes to horror movie host/actor Peter Vincent, ""Vampire Killer,"" in desperation of someone to believe him, & is met with the same skepticism as all the others. Peter Vincent, played by Roddy McDowall, is the complete opposite of Chris Sarandon's, Jerry Dandrige. Bumbling, inept, cowardice, played with all the conviction of non-conviction this fine actor can muster! Peter Vincent is a major ingredient to why this film works so well, as he is finally bribed by Charley's girlfriend to help prove that Charley is wrong about Jerry Dandrige being a Vampire, in another tense scene.

Peter Vincent adds the comedic element to this film, along with Evil Ed, & it is quite the performance, as Peter Vincent finds out Jerry is a Vampire, turns tail & runs, then later finds the courage within himself to help Charley in trying to destroy Jerry Dandrige.

""Fright Night,"" easily has some of the best make up & special effects for any horror film of the 80's, especially a female Vampire with a gaping maw, filled with razor sharp teeth. It helped set a standard for Vampire's appearances to this day. Not just blood shot eyes & fangs, but a metamorphosis, not unlike land mark Werewolf film's, ""An American Werewolf in London"" & ""the Howling. ""Fright Night"" can make a pretty air tight claim to the Vampire sub-genre, that those films did for the Werewolf sub-genre. It can also stand along with those films as one of the best examples of it's ilk, a modern updating of the Vampire film legacy, even though we have ""the Boy Who Cried Wolf"" plot, seldom has it been done so convincingly well! Scary, & funny, all at once!

For Vampire lovers with a sense of humor, you can't go wrong with ""Fright Night,"" it's laughs & scares are one seamless perfection! Truly, a landmark film for the horror genre!

14296,5,0767817664,"After I finished reading the truly horrible script for the 2011 remake of Fright Night I found myself with a new appreciation of the original movie.

  Peter Vincent is probably the most enjoyable character in this film.  Roddy McDowall stole the show as the slightly cowardly TV horror host who grows a spine and rises to be the heroic vampire killer he had always pretended to be.  The soundtrack is incredible.  The acting is brilliant.

  I have always loved Gothic Horror, particularly the old Hammer horror films such as what Peter Vincent shows on his TV show.  Not only do I not see a purpose in the Fright Night remake but I feel it fails on my many levels where the original excels.  The vampires of the original Fright night had the powers of Dracula, himself. They could turn into horrible little bats, or wolves, or mist.  They could enthrall human wills and could show up on film as a human might.  In the remake they have no such abilities and this is not so-well compensated by an excess of explosions.
  The writer of the remake claims that horror movie hosts don't exist anymore.  Not only is this not true but there are more horror movie hosts on TV AND Internet today than there ever were on TV in 1985.  Elvira's Movie Macabre, Mystery science theater 3000, Nostalgia Critic, just to name a few...  I think they made a huge mistake in changing Peter Vincent to a nearly unrecognizable stage magician in the remake.  If anything the movie host is more relatable now than ever before.

  Skip the remake, stick with the original. It makes more sense. It has more accessible characters.  Peter Vincent actually has depth rather than the show pretense of depth with the added backstory given in the remake.  Charlie is a lot nicer and a lot more sympathetic in the  original. And this one had memorable and catchy songs on the soundtrack. The vampires are more frightening while at the same time more charming and strangely sympathetic while also terrifying and deadly.  The humor isn't forced and there's no obnoxious product placement.  The remake...  has none of these qualities.  This is by far the superior film.  Skip the remake, kids.  Stick with the original!",1309824000,4,2184,4.698412698412699

14299,4,0767817664,"I saw the trailer for the unnecessary remake of the classic mid-1980's flick and I am not impressed. I'm not putting it down just because it's a remake; a remake could be good, though I cannot really name one off the top of my head. The trailer just looked boring and Colin Farrell as Jerry Dandridge, the head-vampire, doesn't look the part. I'll give it a rental, but have no interest in seeing it in the theatre.

I saw this original there and got it on DVD for just $2 at a yard sale recently. The DVD's best 'special feature' is simply the movie, as there is nothing else. It has widescreen on one side and full-screen on the other, so that's good for those who have a preference. As well, this has subtitles in the most languages that I have on any DVD on I own. However, watching it with the English subtitles, it seemed that there were many points were there were no words for quite a while.

When Dandridge became the bat, I liked that a lot and, especially when he was destroyed, I thought it was awesome. It had a lot of old, practical effects and makeup that were really good for the time. I'll pick puppetry and classic effects over computerized, fake stuff any day. The remake will most-surely be filled with expensive CGI and that will make it lose appeal for me. However, I love magic and to have the Peter Vincent character be a stage magician instead of a horror-movie host is an interesting idea. Will Mr. Vincent use illusion to trick the vampire into his demise? I think that idea could be used well.

However, Mr. Vincent will not be played by and elderly man, so I think that won't be as interesting. Also, this will be in an over-populated place (Los Angeles, I believe) and that is not preferred. In the original, it took place in 'Anytown, USA'. That gave it a better atmosphere, thinking that it could happen in any common neighbourhood much like the one you're probably in. I hear that Chris Sarandon, who played Dandridge in the original, is supposed to have a cameo in the new flick and that would be cool (yet, most assuredly, it will be too small a part). I hope that the FRIGHT NIGHT theme from J. Geils Band plays a lil' bit somewhere, too...perhaps on a radio station in someone's car? Lastly, concerning the remake, I'm hoping that they re-release the original and the sequel with more features. Specifically FN2 as its cost is ridiculous.

Okay, so back to this flick: it's great.

I don't fully understand the dude who lived with Dandridge. He walked around in the daylight, obviously wasn't human because he was eventually shot multiple times and lived, but a wooden stake through his heart did kill him. His demise was more like a zombie's -- but don't they usually expire when they are shot in the head? When you saw Dandridge's coffin being discovered in the basement, I just noticed that there were two coffin's there. One contained Jerry and the other was open and, I assume, was for the roommate. So...what was that guy? A werewolf in human form? I imagine...and the bullets that Peter Vincent fired weren't silver bullets? Yet can a werewolf be killed with a stake? Whatever...it was still a cool death when he melted into goo and sand.

I was probably more scared as a kid when I watched this; now, it still has some spooky moments but I had 'fun' with it. There's a fair amount of blood, but it's the teeth of the ghouls...noises and sound effects...and eerie locations that add the most to it. It was a bit emotional, too, especially when 'Evil' is dying from being impaled in wolf-form by Peter Vincent and is in the process of converting back to a human. The half wolf/half human and then fully human 'Evil' reaching out to Vincent was something. Roddy McDowall appears honestly affected by this and must feel sad as well as simultaneously relieved that the monster didn't get him. Remember that everything he's seeing was for real and vampire movies were coming to life before his very eyes. He was a fine actor and will always be the genuine vampire killer.",1307404800,5,4010,4.539419087136929

You probably already know the premise of the boy who has trouble convincing his friends and everyone else that the guy who just moved in next door is a vampire on a killing rampage. The boy is a fan of a late night tv show, Fright Night, whose host is played my McDowall. The casting of McDowall is one of those things that could have exploded in the face of the producers, but as it turns out it worked brilliantly. McDowall made a career camping it up in B-grade horror movies, and here he plays someone who made a career camping it up in D-grade (pun intended) movies. This type of self-parody is carried to an extreme, because the movie spends most of its first half making fun of the established cliches of the genre, only to use them all, ALL, in the second half, with a straight face, and to great effect. It is not nearly as gory as the reality-horror we see these days, and I know that to some this will detract from the film, but not for me. Also, this may have been the first movie where the vampire transformation changed the whole facial demeanor of the monster, at least to my knowledge, so there's a little innovation in the genre's rules right there. And then there's Geoffreys' performance (the scene with the mop on his head, then reading the note, is the type of disturbing scary that stays with you, rather than boo-hoo scary), and Sarandon's, suave and threatening, Bearse's seduced virgin, and Ragsdale's earnest geek.

Charley's problem is that no one believes him and his time is running out since Jerry is looking for his first opportunity to silence the snooping teenager for good.

Directed by Tom Holland, ""Fright Night"" offers loads of humor, horror and suspense yet many of todays younger audience will probably find this movie dated. After all, it has none of todays technical wizardry that is CGI. It appears every Fantasy, Science-Fiction and Horror film of today is saturated with it. I personally do not mind CGI if it is well done and in a fantasy element but so far, every attempt to create decent fright effects in horror films have failed miserably and I strongly feel that CGI is aiding in the death of the horror genre. I cannot tell you how refreshing it is to revisit these films. The special effects are brilliant and there is nothing more effective than seeing 3 dimensional beings in terrific vampire make-up. Apparently Chris Sarandon spent several hours in the make-up chair (gotta love those elongated fingers) and I am sure Amanda Bearse and Stephen Geoffreys, the other 2 vampires, did too but the end result was probably worth it as ""Fright Night"" is one of the most enjoyable vampire films Hollywood has given us in the last few decades. Just like Joe Dante's classic ""The Howling"" and John Landis' epic ""An American Werewolf in London"" which still reign supreme as far as werewolf movies are concerned, the same can be said for this gem.

The pacing in this film is virtually flawless as the action, horror and comedy are shifted around from one scene to the other and boredom never sets in. The performances are also worth mentioning because the entire cast delivers in spades. Roddy McDowell, who provides his quirky mannerirms and charm, is his usual brilliant self as the doubtful Vampire Killer. Chris Sarandon is effective and charming as the modern day Dracula. A pre-""Married with Children"" Amanda Bearse is also note-worthy. She is pretty enough as Charley's girlfriend possessing all the qualities of the girl next door and all the charateristics of a jealous girlfriend. Once infected however, her metamorphoses is stunning and she is almost unrecognizable as a sultry vamp. That is of course before her final transformation and once the fangs come into play, she resembles a Carly Simon-esque freakshow in need of serious dental work. The young lead, William Ragsdale, also turns in a good performance but his foolish character may have some viewers rooting for Mr Vampire. But where will the horror genre be without these nonsensical teenagers?

Those who never lived the 80's will probably be shocked at the amount of cheesy fashion sense draping our actors. The younger generation must remember this movie was made before their time and should forgive the 80's tackiness. It is unfortunate that many great films were made during this fashion disaster decade and sometimes the actors wardrobes provide unintentional laughs. The film also starts off almost resembling a B grade, low budget horror schlock-fest but thankfully within the first quarter we are reassured of it's high quality.

Those who haven't seen ""Fright Night"" and are serious horror buffs need to check it out. The cast, direction, special effects and make-up effects are all top notch and this movie was cool way before ""Buffy"", ""Angel"", ""True Blood"" or the ""Twilight"" saga ever came into the picture.",1261872000,3,3830,5.007849293563579
14351,5,0767817664,"I decided to write up this review since this is the ""scary season.""  ""Fright Night"" is one of those great chillers that takes every cliche about vampires and somehow makes it all work well.  Chris Sarandon, a very underappreciated actor (Prince Humperdink from ""The Pricess Bride"" and the voice of Jack Skellington), plays vampire Gerry Dandrige to a charmingly oily, serpentine perfection without being remotely campy.  Stephen Geoffreys, who plays uber-geek best friend ""Evil Ed,"" lightens the mood of the film with sometimes horrific comedy, and Amanda Bearse (""Marcy D'Arcy"" from ""Married With Children) and William Ragsdale are perfectly cast as teenagers caught up in a battle of wits and wills with Dandridge.  But, the icing on this cake is Roddy McDowell's homage to Peter Cushing as the embittered, washed-up B movie vampire movie star who manages to find both his dignity and his faith as he comes to the ultimate realization that vampires DO exist and he is the unlikely choice to do battle against them.  McDowell's performance was so fine - alternatively funny and prosaic - it is worth watching this film to see how an older actor can still turn in stellar performances, who uses the script and props without letting them overpower his range.  It is such a pity this wonderful actor has since passed on since ""Peter Vincent, Vampire Killer"" is arguably one of his best roles.

The movie does have scary parts, so I would be leery of showing it to kids under thirteen.

Just a really, really fantastic vampire movie and well worth watching.

14352,5,0767817664,"When it comes to horror of any genre, Vampires don't typically sit too high on Sid's priority list. It's not that the thought of a blood craving creature isn't scary but for some reason most of these film portray vampires as being a bit fruity. However there are some exceptions to our opinion with one being the 1985 classic Fright Night. A perfect blend a scares with laughs makes this one perfect for Sid's horror Octoberfest, and even gets the vampires into the mix. This one brings back memories of being very young which always adds a lot in the way of sentimental value.

Fright Night is centered around young Charlie Brewster, his old lady, and annoying half pint buddy Evil Ed Thompson. Charlie is a horror movie junkie who spends most late nights watching some fine b(sounds a lot like someone we know). One night while watching a vampire flick he notices his new next door neighbors and they seem to be getting rid of a body and becomes very unnerved. The more he watches the neighbors the more he starts to think they're actually vampires. After telling his friends, who think he's nuts, he decides to enlist the help of his favorite washed up actor who plays a vampire killer in b movies. Seems logical. Now that he's assembled his crew of a couple high school kids and a old man it's time to take down the vampire neighbors which doesn't go so down too easy.

Fright Night turned out to be just as good as it was nearly 24 years ago, just naturally a little less scary. It's a classic for a reason. It's even one of those feel good older horror films that could become an annual watch around the Halloween season simply for the memories it brings back. We even may hand out an woody award to the squeaky voiced Evil Ed for Hey Baby of the year. All around it was just right for what we'd hoped for in the vampire department. It certainly was enjoyed now as it was many years ago and comes with strong recommendation from the old boy Sid.",1255046400,3,1951,4.43175487465181

Chris Sarandon mugs it up as the bloodsucker who moves next door, and our teen leads are suitably cute and pathetic as they run around trying to enlist the aid of skeptical cops and the narrator of a nightly horror show called, of course, FRIGHT NIGHT.

There are a few things you might cringe at.  I found the spikey-haired friend (Ebo?  Is that what they kept calling him?) to be shrill and annoying.

The special-effects are good and the film is played strictly for fun, even with the suspenseful scenes. In fact, it reminds me of the word ""camp"" because it's so hokey in spots. Yet the film definitely has its scary moments.

The cheesey attempts at humor were completely embarrassing as jokes/humor(if You call it that) felt like it was written by a 12 year old!! The comics that I read for Fright Night didn't meddle in worthless jokes and in general made them poignant. It wasn't just about dumb laughs for no real reason such as this turd of a movie possessed. I found William Ragsdale's performance as Charlie Brewster to be dorky! And needless to say he was alot better on Herman's Head. Chris Sarandon was not only very inconsistant in his laughable performance as vampire Jerry Dandridge but he was neither funny nor clever! To say nothing of that scene where one moment he's telling Charlie Brewster that he would give him a chance to forget all about him and what he knows then the next he's strangling him while trying to push him out the window. My gosh are they sure this is a comedy? 'Cause that was a crude moment. Anyway I liked Chris alot better in Child's Play a few years later. Amanda Bearse in a Pre-Married With Children role as Charlie's love interest was a forgivable enough performance despite her not giving it her all! Whoever that really annoying dork was that played Ed/Evil Ed he was just too unbearable and not very funny. The only thing he did that would even remotely pass as funny was his poor attempt to try and fly out a window appearing to fall. I'm sorry but there just isn't any excusing this bucket of vomit at all! Needless to say Roddy McDowell should just stick with Planet of the Apes!

14368,5,0767817664,"***********  Warning:  Spoilers  *******************

Fright Night is by far one of the best scary movies ever made.  The characters, plot and imagery are very easy to follow, and the gore is not something out of the ""Saw"" movies.  That said, this movie has some great humor in it as well.

First and foremost, the storyline is very original.  We have an ordinary boy named Charlie who seems to lead a life that most of us know.  High school.  Girlfriend.  Homework.  Beat up car.  But wait, what's this?  A new neighbor has moved into the old house next door, and he is carrying a coffin into his basement???

The characters are so interesting to watch.  I especially like the sophisticated and devilish nature of Jerry Dandridge, and I know how evil this dangerously deceptive person is.  I see them all the time, especially in the democrat party.  Our heroes are strong-willed and determined to save the day, and I really like the dynamic of Charlie and Peter working together to destroy the neighborhood vampire.  Poor Amy is caught in the middle of good and evil, and Ed completely turns on his friends.

The humor is great, and I love the scene where Amy pushes a hamburger into Charlie's face for ignoring her.  I am fairly certain that some men can relate to this type of treatment from their women.  It was funny, and there are other moments of levity as well.

Yeah, it's got some violence in it.  I mean, we are talking about a vampire that kills people, so of course the good guys have to kill him in order to save the innocent people.

All in all, it's a fun movie to watch, and it's not too scary.",1225152000,2,1611,4.491349480968858

14389,4,0767817664,"Vampire movies are almost by definition parodies, the only variable being the degree and the quality of the parody elements vs the scare elements. ""Fright Night"" (1985) is neither the best parody nor the scariest thriller, but it has the distinction of being the all-time best mix of the two. Both its parody and its scare elements work extremely well and their juxtaposition really makes the film worth seeing.

""Fright Night's"" production design will remind you of ""Gremlins"", a contemporary film, but the spirit of the film is more along the lines of Polanski's ""Fearless Vampire Killers"".

Average suburban teen Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) accidentally discovers that his new neighbor is an evil vampire. The vampire is not particularly discrete, not bothering to pull the window shades and disposing of a victim in a plastic garbage bag. Charley unwisely goes public with his accusations. This tips off the vampire that his teenage neighbor may be a threat. But he is still safe because nobody believes vampires are real.

Not only does no one believe Charley but the vampire discovers that Charley's girlfriend Amy resembles his lost love, which makes her a target. Amy is played by a young Amanda Bearse (""Married With Children""), which you will probably find a bit disconcerting for several reasons but it is kind of interesting to see her as a hot teen love interest.

In desperation Charley goes to Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), the host of the local television show called ""Creature Features"".

The special effects are excellent and not overdone. Dorothy Fielding who plays Charley's airhead mother should get special mention for her excellent performance. One of the running gags during the first half of the film is her failure to find anything suspicious about her new neighbor or his nighttime activities.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only an inner child.",1190764800,4,1884,5.080906148867314
14390,4,0767817664,"If you're into 80s horror movies--especially vampires ones, once you've had enough of Freddy and Jason--then FRIGHT NIGHT needs to go on your required viewing list. Like its younger brother, THE LOST BOYS, this movie is campy as often as scary (which is a minor critique, but a critique nonetheless), but it is also far more traditional.

Rather than the contemporary pack-o-vampires motif so prevalent today (see ""TEETH"", by yours truly, if you don't mind another gratuitous plug), FRIGHT NIGHT comes back to the single domestic vampire with a servant or two, a motif established by Bram Stoker and, more recently, revisited by Stephen King. So, what you have, basically, is a classic tale in modern dressings, decent special effects, and pretty good acting all around. The standout in this movie is Roddy McDowell, who plays Peter Vincent, the vampire killer. Somewhere out there, Buffy's got to be giving this man his props (or at least laying roses and garlic on his grave).

My only lament for this, and its 80s brother in vamping, is the ""safeness"" of the tone. There's so much comedy in both, you often forget to be really scared. Fun stuff, but easy to watch with the lights on or off.

14392,5,0767817664,"Fright Night is a horror movie in its most simplistic form.  A teenage boy named Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale, ""Herman's Head"") believes that his next door neighbor Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon, ""The Princess Bride"") is a vampire.  Of course no one believes him, especially his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse, ""Married with Children"") and his buddy ""Evil"" Ed (Stephen Geoffreys, ""Heaven Help Us"").  Oh by the way, Evil Ed's classic line in this movie is, ""Oh you're so cool Brewster.""

Amy and Ed are concerned about Charlie's well being and figure humor his claims that his neighbor is a vampire.  So Amy and Ed go to speak to Peter ""The Great Vampire Killer"" Vincent (Roddy McDowall, ""Planet of the Apes""), a burnt out horror movie star turned late night T.V. show host for campy horror films (mainly his own).  Charlie is a huge fan of Peter Vincent's work and conceders him a hero.  This is why Charlie's friends seek Peter out.  On the flip side, Amy and Ed are thinking Charlie's imagination is running amuck about Jerry because of all of his Peter Vincent viewing.  Anyway I digress; Amy and Ed talk to Peter about their friend Charlie and the obsession that Jerry is a vampire.  Now how two teenage kids are able to convince a movie star (burnt out or not) to speak with their ""potential"" insane friend, still befuddles me.  Anyway, after some pretty definitive proof, it is discovered that Jerry REALLY IS A VAMPIRE!  Charlie's confirmation is now fact and the other characters are quite shocked at this finding.

I will not give away any details or spoil this flick for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.  Fright Night is really a fun movie and yes it does have some creepy and scary parts to it.  I will also add that the movie has some pretty good special effects, they really aren't that cheesy.  This movie was also made in 1985, which is the zenith of the 1980s, however this movie really doesn't seem dated.  As a matter of fact, it is quite possible this movie is as relative today as it was back in 1985.  The one part of the movie that could be abased for having a 1980s flare is the night club scene.  There is the peachy music, ""colorful"" outfits and the hair sprayed hair.  Then again, 1980s fashion is somewhat neo in these contemporary times, so it might not seem so dastardly.  Ultimately, this movie isn't overshadowed by the fact that it was made in the 1980s.

Now when I say that this is the best vampire movie ever made, that is exactly what I mean.  This movie has nothing to do with Dracula it is a basic vampire movie, so any comparisons with a Dracula is dubious.  Hence Fright Night it is a marvelous vampire movie, not a marvelous Dracula Movie.

The acting in this movie is also really good; Chris Sarandon is smooth and suave as a vampire.  He makes being a creature of the undead look like a lot of fun.  Roddy McDowall is awesome as Peter Vincent (I love the throwback to Peter Cushing and Vincent Price in the character's name); he is dichotomy in his grapples with believing in vampires and faith.  I think this was a bold performance by McDowall.  William Ragsdale did a good job as Charlie.  He looked a bit older than a 17 year old teenager, but then again this type of realism isn't why I am watching Fright Night.  If that was the logic, then Elizabeth Shue was way too hot to be a hooker in Leaving Las Vegas.  Consequently, these are the little persnickety thoughts I place into the box labeled ""it is only a movie"".  Amanda Bearse was also fine as Amy, being both reserved and sexy.  Stephen Geoffreys was also quite vexing in a jovial sort of way in his performance as Evil Ed.  I also like how Jerry's ""roommate"" looks like a Xerox of Bill Paxton.  Did anyone else notice that or was it just me?

As for the DVD itself, it is presented in letterbox/widescreen.  There are several subtitles that can be utilized, so it is foreign speaking friendly.  The original preview/trailer is included, which is somewhat a disappointment.  It seems rather a mundane promotion for such a great movie.  Nevertheless, it is cool that the trailer itself is included on the DVD.

Fright Night is great horror movie period.  It also spawned a pretty good sequel in Fright Night 2.  However, Fright Night stands fine by itself and I wish future vampire movies would use this movie as a paradigm.  Mainly by having a basic story, good characters/acting performance and special effects that don't totally rely on computer graphics.

14412,3,0767817664,"Fright Night is an enjoyable horror.  Its fast paced simple story keeps you watching as to how a young teenager tackles the fact that a vampire has moved in next door to him.  Fright Night is a very predictable 80's horror flick with bubbly performances from its teenager stars and the over exaggerated acting from its adult leads.  Don't get me wrong, the acting IS acceptable for this type of film and works well.  Keeping to the theme of the film, strange things start to happen (for example): a coffin is seen brought into the house next door, a mysterious man is seen with a woman and a body in a bag is seen dragged out of the house.  Of coarse this all leads up to one thing, that there is a vampire living in the next house and the frightened tenager tries to warn everybody before the vampire kills again.  It not surprising what happens next, as the vampire visits and fights back (but for some strange reason) with comedic effect.

Fright Night does have a lot of ridiculous but humerous moments with 80's style make up and special effects.  The special effects however, are quite good and impressive for its time.  Eventhough this film is very enjoyable and a good Halloween flick, it does have a couple of flaws.  One is that the story is very simple and dreary, while the second is that some parts of the film could have been done better.

Overall, Fright Night is a forgetable film but it is very entertaining and fun to watch.  Its a film I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could.  So I gave it 3, as it will take me a while to watch again.",1150070400,3,1551,4.325259515570934
14413,4,0767817664,"I wasn't in the right mood when I saw this, so it took a long time for me to think 'urbane parody' instead of 'why is Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) such a screw-up.'  Most of this was due to a start that got most of its laughs from scenes of Charley ignoring his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) to spy on Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon), the vampire who has moved in next door.  The sight gags simply don't work very well and until the film actually develops some dialog it doesn't really shift from 'yet another clich' ridden horror film with a big cast' to 'Hey! That was cool.'

So Charley discovers that Dandridge is lunching on the local joy girls while Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark) the ghoul redecorates the nest by painting the windows black.  Charley attempts to raise the alarm, but only manages to convince everyone that he is having a lot of 'teenage' moments.  In desperation, he turns to the local horror show host Roger Vincent (Roddy McDowell) and suddenly the film shifts into high gear.  He gives a one-man demonstration of the acting abilities that have put him in some 250 films, playing a crotchety ex-actor whose nickname was 'The Vampire Slayer,' now reduced to a late nite host with slipping ratings.

McDowell plays the part as frightened man who knows that vampires really don't exist and then discovers that they do.  He squeezes every bit of humor there is to be had out of the part and somehow gets everyone else up to his level.  Just when you think the film is in danger of failing in spite of Sarandon's coolness, McDowell demonstrates that there is still a lot of life in those old clich's.  Fright Night can't help being light weight, but it does manage to be successfully entertaining.  And you get some interesting special effects when people go vampy face or dissolve upon staking.",1149120000,10,1822,4.6625
14424,5,0767817664,"This is one of my favorite horror movies of the 1980s.  It's an updated version on an old theme:  Save the young heroine from the evil, blood-sucking vampire.

Chris Sarandon (Lifetime Movie Channel staple) has an absolute field day playing the villainous Jerry Dandridge.  Amanda Bearse (""Married with Children"") plays Amy, the young high school target of Dandridge's desires.  And William Ragsdale (a Hollywood newcomer at the time) plays Charley, the young hero who does his best to convince others to help him save Amy.

No one really believes Charley's rantings that his new neighbor next door is a vampire.  Charley's geeky best friend (played devilishly well by Stephen Geoffreys) doesn't believe him; nor does Amy.

Desperate, Charley enlists the help of has-been horror actor and TV host ""Peter Vincent, Vampire Killer.""  Equally desperate, Vincent takes the job as Charley's ""savior"" because he was fired as TV host and needs the money.

Roddy McDowall plays Peter Vincent extraordinarily well - first as an actor out to (wink-wink) ""convince"" Charley that Jerry Dandridge is NOT a vampire, and then genuinely terrified when he discovers evidence that Charley's suspicions are true.

Dandridge, upon meeting Amy, sees her unearthly resemblance to a woman he once loved.  He is immediately infatuated with the young girl.

But first, realizing his secret is out, Dandridge acts quickly to rid himself of the problem of Charley and his pesky friends.

The special makeup effects in this film are terrific and imaginative.  The script is tightly written and well acted and Tom Holland's direction makes it work.  (Holland's other works include ""Child's Play,"" ""The Temp,"" and ""Thinner"").

The DVD transfer is sharp and clean.  The disc features both a standard full screen version (4:3) and a widescreen version (2.35:1).  Sound is presented as 2-channel, Dolby Surround.

The only DVD extra is the theatrical trailer.  Sub-titles are available in several languages:  English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai.  The disc is also close-captioned for the hearing impaired.

14425,4,0767817664,"Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) is your typical teenage boy.  He lives with his mother and has a girlfriend, Amy (Amanda Bearse).  His favorite TV show is Fright Night, which shows horror films hosted by faded film star Peter ""The Great Vampire Killer"" Vincent.

When a new neighbor moves in, Charley notices strange things.  Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is suave and sophisticated and is never seen before sunset.  When some girls start missing, Charley starts to suspect that Jerry might be a vampire.  When he cannot convince anyone else of this, he goes to Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell).  Peter, at first, is skeptical, like the rest.  But eventually Charley brings him around.

Charley, Amy and Vincent go against Dandridge.  Of course, you know how it has to end.  This film combines comedy with horror to make a fine hybrid.  Roddy McDowell was a great character actor in early days of MGM (best as Liz Taylor's sidekick.)  This was a comeback for McDowell.

Fright Night is a great Halloween film for the preteens up.  It's scary, but with a sense of humor.

14427,3,0767817664,"My kids found this movie amusing and, reading the reviews here, I'm wondering if I'm the only one who thought this was not a very good vampire flick. I liked the story line but the acting in some cases (Stephen Geoffreys and Chris Sarandon) was quite shoddy. I loved the ""seduction"" music and was a bit ticked when I bought the tape and found it a vocal instead of the sexy sound I heard in the movie.

William Ragsdale was quite good as Charlie, all hormones and teenage lust, and still fairly normal in spite of his dingbat mother. Amanda Bearse is sweet. I liked her maturing transformation on the dance floor. In fact, this is Sarandons one good moment in the film. The dance is all about seduction and he does an incredible job. As long as he isn't trying to actually spout lines he does all right. Stephen Geoffreys was bloody awful and I do not find it a mystery that I've seen him in nothing since.  Johathan Stark as the modern day ""Igor"" is very, very good. A great addition to a small budget film and I wouldn't mind seeing him in other things, he was that believable.

Roddy McDowall is not a great film actor. Maybe he is better on the stage, I don't know. However, he gives an adequate performance here as PETER VINCENT, VAMPIRE KILLER. I think Vincent Price (who I adore and who was also NOT a great actor), could have had a ball in this role and it's a shame that he didn't get the chance to try. Regardless, McDowall also has some fun here and he is amusing to watch.

To me, this is a nice old vamp flick, good with popcorn and a group of teenie-boppers. I don't think the older teens will like the lack of special effects and adults will see the lack of acting talent.  Great to rent, good to buy only if you get a good deal on the price.",1127520000,2,1757,4.248502994011976

Roddy McDowall plays the part of a late-night television horror film emcee, and he adds a nice touch as he haplessly helps his young friends defeat Dracula with his ""vampire kit.""

14429,5,0767817664,"Chris Sarandon makes an excellent vampire. As a matter of fact, the whole cast works out great and brings life to the storyline -- that of a high school student, Charlie Brewster, that is convinced that a vampire has moved into the house next-door. A series of screams coming from the house over the next few days, and odd comings and goings fuel his suspicions. These are confirmed while spying on  Jerry Dandridge's house with a pair of binoculars. Through Dandridge's bedroom window, he spies his neighbor attempting to bite the neck of a woman -- fangs and claws bared. As Dandridge leans in for the kill, he happens to glance up and notice Charlie watching. From that point on, Charlie's a marked man.

Charlie's friends, ""Evil"" Ed and girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bierce), attempt to convince him that he's just imagining things by paying a visit to Dandridge's house with the horror show host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell). Peter Vincent thinks he's going through the motions to dispel Charlie's overactive imagination until, on the way out, he notices Dandridge doesn't cast a reflection.

From there it's a game of cat and mouse that makes for an enjoyable horror movie -- one of my favorites.

It may seem a little dated, being made in 1984, but the special effects still hold up pretty well. The acting's good, the storyline's good, and there are some good scares to be had. What more could you want from a horror movie?",1126310400,4,1426,4.761133603238866
14430,5,0767817664,"After twenty years Fright Night remains one of the best Vampire films of the last couple of decades and still scary.  A perfect film to watch on dark nights.  What makes the movie go is the very believable characters.  Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) is a typical teenager.  He's a horror movie fan and maybe a bit of a nerd.  When a new neighbor moves in next door Charley becomes convinced he is a vampire.  He tells his friends Amy (Amanda Bearse) and Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) but they think he's nuts.

Peter tries to enlist the aid of an old horror movie host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell), the vampire killer, but he thinks Charley is crazy too.  Eventually they all try to humor him by going to the house to meet the new resident Jerry Dandridge played by chris Sarandon.  It's all kind of a joke to everyone until Vincent looks in his little mirror and sees that Dandridge does not cast a shadow.  With the realization that Dandridge really is a vampire Vincent wants to flee the town.  Meanwhile the vampire now comes after Charlie and his friends, kidnapping Amy and taking her to his old, gothic looking Victorian.  Charley now has to rescue Amy and figure out a way to stop the Vampire and his servant Billy Cole.

Fright Night has a great atmosphere and is really a throwback to old classic Universal and hammer films which relied on great suspense and atmosphere over blood and gore.  The scenes as Charley and Vincent stalk the vampire in the house are truly scary as is Charley's final battle with Dandridge.  William Ragsdale and Chris Sarandon are fantastic in their roles.  While Ragsdale was actually in his early 20's at the time, his young appearance made him believable as a teen.  Bearse was even older at 26, but still pulled off her teen character.  Chris Sarandon exuded sexuality as the vampire Gary Dandrige but was equally menacing as well.

Cast:  William Ragsdale, Chris Sarandon, Roddy McDowall, Amanda Bearse, Stephen Geoffreys.

Running Time:  105 minutes.

Rated R for vampire violence, gore, nudity, and some language.

Rivals ""The Howling"" as the quintessential vampire film of the past quarter-decade, ""Fright Night"" excels even more in the humor department.  William Ragsdale plays Charley Brewster (perhaps the best, cheesy high-schooler name ever), a regular teenager who finds himself emotionally distraught and disturbed in adolescence, but for much different reasons than any of his classmates.  Charley is convinced that his new neighbor Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is a blood-sucking, bat-winged vampire and he will stop at nothing to get his friends and family to believe him.

As Charley and his girlfriend (played by Amanda Bearse) realize that his initial perceived nightmare is true, they enlist the help of former television vampire hunter has-been Peter Vincent (in a wonderfully funny performance from the great Roddy McDowall) to bring the vampire-next-door to light.  Director Tom Holland uses a great, clever script to near perfection, mixing the elements of terror and tongue-in-cheek humor to the fullest, making ""Fright Night"" one of the most enjoyable and entertaining horror films of the middle decade.  Ragsdale is innocently exceptional with his performance and Sarandon is perfect as the seducing, scheming vamp.  Very good special effects and some great one-liners.  Can be enjoyed to all movie-goers, not just buffs of the horror genre.  A true campy, cult landmark.",1117584000,3,1591,5.598326359832636
14454,5,0767817664,"It's safe to say that Charley Brewster has a short attention span. In fact, that's probably an understatement. But, when Charley oversees his new neighbor committing murder through his bedroom window, he finally gets some focus in his life. Much to the dismay of his family and friends, however, his new focus is on vampires. After a violent confrontation with Jerry, the creature next door, Charley is desperate to destroy the monster, and he attempts to enlist the aid of local ""Fright Night"" horror host Peter Vincent, the fearless vampire killer, to do it. Unbelieving Peter is reluctant, but Charley's girlfriend Amy and creepy-geek friend, Evil Ed, convince him with a bit of financial persuading. Their intention is to prove to Charley that Jerry Dandrige is not a vampire at all, but they are in for the scare of their lives, and it's anybody's guess who will survive the real ""Fright Night!""

""Fright Night"" is an 80s vampire flick for the classic horror fanatic! Paying homage to such staples as Dark Shadows and the Hammer Dracula franchise, this surprising little horror film supplies vampire lore and cliches aplenty, put together so skillfully that the result is this horror fan's favorite vampire indulgence. Of course, this favoritism is in no small part due to spectacular effects and performances! The cast seems tailor made for their roles as they play them, even if some choices seem a bit odd superficially. Hard to imagine this vampire pining away over the centuries for Married With Children's Marcy D'Arcy, but Amanda Bearse plays the role of the teenage object of Chris Sarandon's desires to perfection. Chris, himself, is powerfully convincing and menacing as the hip, 80's vampire. Extremely well adjusted to the times, too. His slave-boy zombie, Billy Cole, is played by an excellently creepy Jonathan Stark, but he's out-creeped by the always somewhat disturbing Stephen Geoffreys as Evil Ed. Of course, William Ragsdale IS Charlie Brewster, and his portrayal is what propels the film. The icing on THIS cake, however, aside from the teenage victim in the window that I've had a crush on all my life, played by someone named Irina Irvine, is the brilliant performance of one of my all-time faves, Roddy ""Bullwhip"" McDowall, as Peter Vincent, vampire killer! The late, great Roddy McDowall is definitely the yeast that raises this film from vampire movie mediocrity. Despite the nearly bare bones disc, featuring only a trailer and double-sided widescreen/fullscreen selection, this DVD is a must own for vampire, horror, and McDowall fans alike. Be prepared for some cheezy 80's music and a great time that you'll want to experience again and again!

14455,5,0767817664,"I'll make this really short.  I was 14 years old when I saw this film.  It scared the living hell out of me.  It also thrilled me to undeath.  The first DVD I bought when I bought a DVD Player in the Spring of 2000 was this one.  It is my favorite vampire film of all time.  Christopher Lee opened my eyes to the fun of vampirism with ""Horror of Dracula"" and ""Dracula Has Risen From the Grave"".  Public television used to run these films on Friday nights when I was a teenager.  So I say, thanks, Uncle Ted.  He was the host of the monster movie show which brought you older movies.

  Fast Forward to the eighties horror where sometimes vampires aren't seen or they're laughed at.  Don't do that to Mr. Holland.  His direction is extraordinary.  Twenty years have passed and this classic deserves a special packaging from Paramount Pictures with some bonus stuff if any exist.  All the traditional things you know about vampires are in this film.  Mr. Holland doesn't fool around and try to put a tolerance level of sunlight on vampires.  The crucifix is definitely painful, as is being staked.  Bram Stoker doesn't have to haunt the screenplay writer.  This is a wonderful horror film.  Treat it with respect.  It's even human enough that it pays tribute to Peter Cushing and Vincent Price.  Applause from me.  These guys made it possible for a film like this to be made.  Some humor is thrown into the film, since there is humor in life.  Real emotions.  Real actors.  20th Anniversary ought to be in session.  Mr. Sarandon, if I could, I'd hand you some kind of ""Christopher Lee Award"" for vampire portrayal excellence.

14456,4,0767817664,"Although ""Fright Night"" is considered to be an 80's classic, it is actually more than that. The film is an endearing and energetic homage to horror cinema especially the Hammer productions and the Universal horror cycle. Yes, the film has a humorous tone, but it is not campy nor is it trashy. It is a competently written, stylishly directed and wonderfully performed horror film which features amazing special effects by Richard Edlund (back when effects depended on imagination, not processor speed) and a truly original and haunting score by Brad Fiedel. But the highlight of this movie has to be Roddy McDowall's performance as Peter Vincent (which is Tom Holland's tribute to actors PETER Cushing and VINCENT Price) as his portrayal of the fading horror star who hosts a second rate late night horror show who reluctantly becomes a real life vampire killer, is both terrific and arguably his career best. With an atmosphere that is nothing short of a horror buff's dream, good performances and a terrific, special-effects laden climax, this is a horror classic that is unmissable for fans of horror and especially vampire films. *The Region 1 dvd features a gorgeous anamorphic transfer, but is sadly missing the 5.1 sound remix that is featured on the region 2 edition, however both features the excellent trailer, which is also restored*.",1113091200,5,1345,5.063063063063063

William Ragsdale stars as Charley, a horror loving teen who suspects his new neighbor (Chris Sarandon) is a vampire.

Other reviews give a detailed analysis of the plot so no need to rehash it here.  If you're looking for a good and enjoyable vampire flick 1980's style (complete with the spiky hair and cheesy club music), this is the movie for you.

I just can't believe it's been nearly 20 years since the film's release.  But, even after all that time, it's still got it.",1102377600,4,663,4.333333333333333
14459,4,0767817664,"Fright Night has all the classic and yes, cliched elements one expects and wants in a tongue-in-cheek, teen/camp or chick horror flick.  It's fun, stylish, has a handsome vamp, heros who keeps trying when the chips are down, and a heroine who has to decide who and what are important to her life.

  Roddy McDowall plays aging actor Peter Vincent (Vincent Price allusion no doubt) who starred in countless horror films as a Vampire Slayer who now hosts Fright Night, a horror movie hour on the local network that could easily have been USA in the 80s or an local yokel station. All his films come to life for him in sickening reality when he is called upon by the teenager Charlie Brewster, an avid fan of the Fright Night show for help in dispatching the vampire next door.

 The vampire next door, Jerry Dandridge is played with fun melodramatic flair by Chris Sarandon,(who was in that other memorable Holland film, Child's Play)  best remembered for his other evil role as Prince Humperdink in the Princess Bride. Dandridge also has a creepy and edgy sociopathic henchman who manages to be scary than him at times. There is an undercurrent of the serial-killer duo between them mixed with a metrosexual edge that leaves you wondering.

  This film does an uncliched legend blaster when it shows that the vampire is a disgusting and revolting. A vampire doesn't love you -- he needs you -- and thus another part of the vamp mystique is exposed to harsh sunlight.

  His hideous transformation starts out with long feminine nails as he shape shifts into a ghastly blood-sucker with a mouth truly like a bat from hell.

 Charlie puts two and two together when call-girls Dandridge orders show up decapitated on the news.

  Of course, Charlie has problems without a vampire or his weird henchman living next door: His girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) has decided she's not ready to lose her virginity, right before Dandridge moves in. Charlie's mom is single. Soon, Charlie's mom invites vamp-o in to their home, and Charlie knows his days are numbered. It's a classic case of invasion, and too many changes for Charlie, psychologically. What I find most interesting is how Dandridge doesn't want to kill Charlie if only he'll keep his mouth shut. In fact, Dandridge shows odd compassion throughout the film, making his character more complex and vulnerable. This vulnerability shows through the most when he is with Amy. I don't really know any other vamps who've offered a chance to walk away, but once again it touches on a malevolent vein of serial killer fraternity. After all, Dandridge had let Charlie watch as he seduced one of the call girls up to the point he began to change.

 At the same time, Amy begins re-thinking her choices because she thinks Charlie's acting strange since she wouldn't have sex with him. In an effort to win back his love, she pays Peter Vincent to fake a holy water test on Dandridge hoping this will get Charlie to leave Dandridge alone. Unfortunately, this is when Dandridge meets Amy. Amy is immediately drawn to Dandridge, more so then the usual victim, and we find out why. She is the likeness of someone he knew centuries ago.

  In irony, she gives to Dandridge what she would not to Charlie . Then again, perhaps it is not so ironic. With the vampire she will have forever, but as she and Charlie are just teenagers there is no security with him. The scene of seduction between Dandridge and Amy shows that it is Amy's choice in the end.

The first time I watched this film I was a pre-teen, and took it very seriously and now that I'm an adult it is sheer fun.",1101081600,4,3605,4.676703645007924

I was extremely intrigued by every action in this film, and now at the age of 19, this film has become a truly wonderful film to watch. William Ragsdale plays the teenage detective obsessing over his next door neighbor, stating that he positively is a creature of the night. Charley Brewster (ragsdale) then goes to his tv hero, Peter Vincent ( Roddy McDowall) the great vampire killer. Peter rejects Charley's belief and later Charley is forced to go in alone. Another great aspect of this film is the sly, seductive vampire, played by Chris Sarandon. I believe he plays the perfect vamp in this tale. I honestly think that if you are in the mood to rent a hip, fun, scary, and classic vampire flick, then this is the movie.

So yes, in its own way, Fright Night is cheesy.  At the same time, though, it is oh so much more than you would expect - an entertaining, somewhat creepy vampire film that features some great acting and some really impressive special effects.  You expect to see really bad, noticeably cheap special effects in a film like this, but Fright Night hits a home run in this department.

William Ragsdale plays Charley Brewster, a typical horror-loving kid who just so happens to find out that his new neighbor is a vampire - naturally, no one believes him, including his friend Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys in a truly annoying performance) and his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse, who went on to play Marcie on Married With Children).  For some reason, Charley decides to be open about his suspicions, thus letting the vampire know that he knows his little secret - not a smart move, as Charley soon learns courtesy of a little visit from the new guy in town.  This vampire, I must say, looks nothing like your typical Count Dracula; he actually looks like a reject from Dance Fever, making it a little hard for me to take him seriously (although the threat of ""Deney Terrio"" busting out some disco moves in the film's one night club scene certainly had me feeling uneasy).  In desperation, Charley goes to the only man he thinks can help him - Peter Vincent, Vampire Killer (Roddy McDowall).  Vincent killed many a vampire - in the movies - and he is now the local host of Fright Night, a late-night horror show.  As you might expect, Vincent doesn't really believe in vampires and, once he sees that Charley is telling him the truth, he isn't too anxious to fight them, either.  McDowall is really great in this movie; he is the lynchpin upon which most of the movie's success depends.

I can't say enough about the special effects, especially those in the film's climactic moments.  As a horror fan, I really appreciate the filmmakers spending the time and money to give me such an impressive show.  The plot features a number of clich&eacute;s as well as a couple of ""oldest tricks in the book,"" but the inspired performance of Roddy McDowell combined with the fantastic special effects leads me to bump my rating up from four to five stars.  This probably won't be the best vampire film you've ever seen, but I am sure that fans of the genre will not fail to get quick a kick out of Fright Night.",1098144000,44,2766,4.616326530612245

That says a lot about this completely enjoyable, suspenseful nugget of mind candy. Roddy McDowell turns a splendid tongue-in-cheek performance as a horror movie t.v. emcee who is way beyond his prime, and is now enlisted by a couple of teens to fight real a vampire. Chris Sarandon as the vampire, Jerry, does a terrific job as a super-smug bloodsucker.
Much of the plot is nothing new: teens discover mayhem; adults don't believe teens; teens begin to endure in-fighting; the mayhem grows more menacing; teenage girl falls victim to mayhem; unlikely courage and heroes emerge to save the girl and the town. But that doesn't matter. The true strength of this film is its ability to draw from these conventions and make it turn and twist on themselves. And the humor that's drawn out keeps the pace lively while setting you up for more horror. This same formula worked for another relatively unknown film, ""Return of the Living Dead.""

He maked the movie very enjoyable.  I was a bit younger when I watched this film.  I don't mean like 9 or 10 I was about 23 when this came out and now I'm 42.  The special affects are great and the camera tricks are dazzling and great.  Lot's of nudity in this vampire flick and this one was way better than it's horrible and depressing sequel.  So, just take my word for it, don't go near the sequel.  Anyway, the acting in this gets a 5/5 and the plot gets a 5/5.  Even by looking at the front cover of this movie you can tell that it is a cool and exicting film.  This is the best vampire movie I've seen really, and trust me, I've seen a batch of vampire movies.  Let's say this film hits number 1 because of these three reasons,
1. There is tons of gore
2. It isn't fake looking like alot of other vampire movies
3. It has a great and interesting plot
What more do you need to know that this movie is great and well worth your money no matter what the price is.  SO go ahead and get this movie, take my word for it, you won't regret it.  Not at all.

(USA - 1985)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Stereo

Unable to convince anyone that his new neighbor (Chris Sarandon) is a vampire, a desperate teenager (William Ragsdale) summons the help of a reluctant TV 'horror host' (Roddy McDowall) to confront the monsters in their midst...

Produced at a time when the American horror film seemed to have lost its way following the glut of low-budget independent shockers which proliferated in the wake of HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13th, Tom Holland's FRIGHT NIGHT attempts to straddle the gap between 'traditional' horror and the effects-driven blockbusters which had begun to dominate genre movies in the early 1980's. The plot is a little thin, and there's a couple of items which date the narrative squarely within its decade (notably the disco sequence, and a cringe-inducing theme song by the 'J. Geils Band' during the closing credits!), but Holland's script reserves its major fireworks for a dramatic second half, in which the forces of Good and Evil make their final stand against one another, resulting in a barrage of monsters and mayhem, courtesy of Richard Edlund's superb visual effects.

Ragsdale and love interest Amanda Bearse are saddled with stock juvenile characters, but Sarandon relishes his role as the vampiric predator, toying with Ragsdale as the boy's accusations of supernatural horror are met with incredulity by all around him. However, McDowall steals the movie as a faded horror star whose old-fashioned values have fallen out of favor in an increasingly cynical age, and who finds himself confronted at the end of his career by very real monsters indeed. Though somewhat underwritten, McDowall portrays the man's cowardice, sadness and ultimate redemption with a deftness and clarity that brightens the entire movie.

Some observers have discerned a homoerotic subtext in Ragsdale's obsession with his handsome, vampiric neighbor, and also in Sarandon's pursuit of Ragsdale's high school buddy (Stephen Geoffreys, also known as 'Sam Ritter', star of gay adult movies like VIRTUAL STUD and SEX ON THE BEACH), and while there's some merit in this particular reading, it doesn't get in the way of the slam-bang melodramatics. Geoffreys adopts a range of tics and mannerisms which will infuriate some viewers and endear him to others, but his final sequence - one of the best in the entire movie - is charged with genuine emotion (rendered even moreso by McDowall's extraordinary, wordless performance on the sidelines), and the 'death rattle' which accompanies Geoffreys' departure is one of the creepiest sound effects this reviewer has EVER heard!!...

Fright Night is a 1986 vampire flick written and directed by Tom Holland(Child's play).  Charlie Brewster is a high school kid who lives with his mother and has a girlfriend. He notices that his next door neighbor Jerry Dandridge is carrying a coffin into his bassment for his sleep during the day.  He gets Peter Vincent to help him out.  This movie is AWESOME. Horror Movies from the 1980's are the best(except Halloween ""1979"").  Chris Sarandon is great as an intimidating SCARY vampire.  i rented this movie and kept it overdue for almost a month because of repeated viewings.

14480,5,0767817664,"This is an older movie but it still is a very entertaining film. It's campy, for sure, and a bit dated now, but the actors did such a fine job you can totally get drawn into the story- and that is really all that matters.
No one believes Charlie Brewster when he states that the neighbor is a vampire- and believe me, Charlie, the goofy high school student, has tried everything: telling his friends, his mom, and even the police. Unfortunately, Mr. Dandridge, the vampire, is extremely charming and everyone is so taken with him-even poor Charlie's girlfriend- that they think Charlie needs to stop watching horror films and get a life.
When he manages to get the  washed up and cowardly horror film actor who hosts his favorite show (""Fright Night""- the snippets shown of the fictional TV show are hilarious) involved things really start cracking...and it's about time, because Dandridge is intent on winning the popularity contest; he tranforms buddy Evil into his minion, and next on the list is girlfriend Amy. It's up to bumbling Charlie and his Hollywood buddy to save the day...and it's no easy task given that no one under Dandridge's spell wants to be saved...
Given how seductive Chris Sarandon was in this, I wouldn't have wanted to be saved either...In Amy's own words: He's really ""NEAT!""

Will Ragsdale probably leaves something to be desired but Roddy Mcdowall as Peter Vincent steal the show anyway. This movie does an excellent job of satirizing the vampire genre while at the same time respecting itself and traditional vampire lore. This mix keeps it from taking itself to seriously and makes this a fun mvie to watch again and again. The sequel directed by Tommy Lee Wallace (director of Halloween 3)instead of Tom Holland is second rat in comparison but still do yourself a favor and grab them as a two pack. This would be a great franchise for a remake if appropriate cast could be found.,1073347200,,681,4.544715447154472

The use of special effects is done really well, in that they compliement the story, and not try to cover up the fact that the story is weak and full of holes, like in other movies.  This movie is about a guy named Charlie who finds out that a vampire has moved in next door to him, and has started killing people.  The more he tries to convince others of this, the crazier he appears to look.  He tries to enlist the help of a local TV personality, the character played by Roddy McDowall, who hosts his own creep show called 'Fright Night', with little intial success.  Eventually some of the other characters see that Charlie is right, and this leads to the climatic finale.  I think Chris Sarandon plays his role as the vampire realy well, not over the top but right on the money.  He's charming, seductive, and alluring, with a sinister side that only Charlie can see until the vampire exposes himself for what he is....Roddy Mcdowell is great also, playing his role as Peter Vincent, a sort of washed up character actor trying to squeeze as much as he can out of his past celebrity.  A fun movie with a lot of charm and appeal.  I am amazed that this movie came out like 18 years ago....seems like only yesterday...where does the time go?",1050969600,5,1375,4.356862745098039

 Chris Sarandon is so evil in this film as ""Jerry Dandrige""-- The Vampire that I could not watch him in another film. Good acting.
 Last but not least is Roddy McDowall, as brilliant an actor as he was, he played ""Peter Vincinct"", a man who is a tv host for broadcast horror movies and ""Charlie"" (William Ragsdale) hires him to rid of the vampire living next door to him.
Roddy McDowall was a well-liked professional actor who began his acting as a child.

It was hinted a little bit in tv-movie, Mae West (1982). He died October 3, 1998 of lung cancer. He never had an enemy.
 I'm glad Roddy McDowall agreed to do this film and the sequel. This film is made with class, style and great well-made special effects. Great soundtrack too.

 William Ragsdale stars as Charley Brewster, a normal guy who spends some spare time trying to get his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) to put out. Unbeknownst to Charlie, his new next door neighbor is a vampire (Chris Sarandon). As the vampire - Jerry - closes in on his mom, Charley realizes he must stop the vampire at once. But that's not so easy. With the help of Amy, his friend Ed (hilarious Stephen Geoffreys), and creature feature host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell), he begins his attempt to rid of the creature of the night.
 Throughout the movies are great horror moments tied in with simple humour. Mostly the dorkyness of being a teenager, and trying to unveil a ""supposed"" vampire. Tom Holland's direction is pretty on, especially the whole alley scene and the showdown between Evil Ed and Peter Vincent. All of the actors put on believable performances. Stephen Geoffreys left behind a classic character in the horror genre.

Since then I have seen the film over 20 times, purchased the poster, soundtrack and the film both on VHS and DVD (not many extras on the DVD version, unfortunately)  This film has great acting by all leads, but Stephen Geoffreys as ""Evil Ed"" steals the show - my favourite quote is when William Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse are resigned to defeat by vampires and ""Evil Ed"" remarks ""Then we'd have vampires taking over the whole town (looks out window) - not that it'd be much of a loss...""  Great score by Brad Fiedel (""The Terminator"") and attention to detail - smash cut camerawork and great flying effects.  This is an ideal horror movie to show anyone uninitiated in the genre - couple it with ""The Lost Boys"".  The sequel is also worth watching (once).",1025913600,5,1015,4.51912568306011
14523,5,0767817664,"I agree with everyone's assessment of Fright Night. It is,by far, the best vampire movie of all time....it's funny, yet serious and spooky. And isn't overly gory and it doesn't exaggerate on killings. It gives you just enough to satisfy your vampire tastes. And what makes it even more great is that it is a very open-ended movie, by that I mean that although we are shown that Jerry is a vampire, we see his fangs, we see him turn into a bat etc., it is not necessarily set in stone.....could it just be Charley's overactive imagination? And for that matter, Peter Vincent's imagination as well, as he has just ben fired from his long time job and perhaps needs something to make his dull life interesting? The plot is very unique,and it's up to the viewer to decide. And the dance club scene is the stuff of legend.....it simply rocks. Anyone who hasn't yet seen this movie has surely been deprived of top notch entertainment. So if u are tryng to decide whether or not to buy this movie, it's very simple: Buy it!!

14525,4,0767817664,"Alfred Hitchcock didn't die of old age  -  he shuffled off this mortal coil because the movies went to the teenagers.  But if he'd lived, and ever delved into the supernatural, he might easily have made this movie.
Average high school kid Charlie has a debonair new neighbor, Mr. Dandridge, who seems to entertain a different knockout girl every night.  Problem is, after they've been to Dandridge's house, the next place they're seen is on the evening news  -  dead.  As if that isn't bad enough, Charlie's seen fangs in Dandridge's smile, and Dandridge only comes out at night.  Who can Charlie get to believe him?  His mother, friends, and the local police think he's seen too many vampire movies.  But Dandridge knows what Charlie's seen.  And he's not about to let him go on talking about it.
This is a great cat-and-mouse thriller, that just happens to be about a vampire instead of a mere serial killer.  The script is clever, the performances good.  Chris Sarandon is charming and menacing, in equal measure, as Dandridge.  Roddy McDowall gets to play cowardly hero as the first person Charlie gets to believe him  -  a late-night horror movie host/has-been actor, who sets out to cure Charlie of his ""delusion"" and instead meets the devil next door.  A pre-Married With Children adorable Amanda Bearse plays Charlie's girlfriend.
The effects are quite good, as are the atmosphere and musical score.  The film's only drawback is that it is sometimes directed with a heavy hand, and spends too much time on the juvenilia of Charlie and his friends  -  though the latter works to good effect, in the sense that it makes them very believable high schoolers, hardly up to facing the menace of an experienced and supernaturally powerful killer.",1019433600,4,1747,4.837837837837838
14526,5,0767817664,"I loved watching this movie.  Roddy McDowell was excellent in this fim as Peter Vincent, ""Fearless Vampire Killer"".  Yeah, right.  If this is what made him so famous on screen, why was he living in a small, cramped, and cluttered one bedroom apartment with a job hosting horror flicks on a show that scraped the bottom of the barrel in ratings??
  As for Chris Sarandon, this is the best I've seen him look in a long time, especially in his vampire make-up.  What's so attractive is that he is so suave when he seduces Evil Ed into taking his hand.  The way he kidnapped Amy was classic too.  Dandridge's 'attraction' to Amy was almost otherworldly, if a somewhat typical throwback to the B-Movies of the 1950's.

I especially liked when Charlie, the typically sex-starved teenager, gets curious and discovers his neighbor, Jerry Dandridge's secret.  It's really funny when he tries to convince the policeman of a murder.  Even Amy thought he was cracked.

Yes, the plot holes were there as far as the script, but at least no one was dumb enough to stand in the path of the vampire screaming. This is what gave the movie strength, despite the troubles with plot.  Peter Vincent did stammer and cower after he visited Charlie's neighbor.  It's amazing how he rebounds though.

14539,3,0767817664,"Chris Sarandon is terrific as Jerry Dandridge, the charming neighborhood vampire. In watching his performance one evening after I bought this tape, I finally understood why it was that the vampire story will never die, no matter how many stakes get driven into its heart: the near-death ecstasy and the orgasmic ecstasy are biochemically identical. Whether it is the act of creating human life or the act of taking it away- the human physical response is the same.  With the tale of the vampire, when the male vampire is in the act of ostensibly making love to his victim, we get both actions [ostensibly giving and taking] the same time.  The raw power of the scene in the book, ""Dracula,"" where the vampire baptizes Mina with his own blood, adds a third element to this powerful biochemical mix: a spiritual element, a religious esctasy.  We don't have this in ""Fright Night"", but instead we have the setting of an entirely normal central character and his friends, in an average town in Anywhere, America.  This ""brings it home"" in an unexpected way, as the spiritual aspect is replaced by a social one.  Context is the difference, one which is exploited very well.  And of course, the struggle of a fatherless boy trying to grow into manhood and the man finds himself fixating on [the vampire] adds another dimension.  The vampire has been a man and moved beyond it; Charley wants to be a man and finds that he is both helpless and threatened by the vampire.  And of course, the vampire is just as helpless under certain conditions and threatened by almost everything in the ordinary daylight world- Charley through the looking glass.
Roddy McDowell shines in his role as the washed-up B-movie star.  The supporting cast is also very good.  And the music isn't even bad-- very 80's, but this adds to its charm.",1011916800,3,1814,4.748407643312102
14540,5,0767817664,"What would you do if a vampire moved in next door?  That's the question this movies asks as young Charlie Brewster gains a most unwelcome neighbor at the beginning of the movie.  Charlie isn't the smartest guy in the world but he does figure out that a vampire has moved next door and immediately tries his best to tell others about him... a strategy that is obviously doomed to failure since no one will believe a hysterical teen yelling that a vampire next door is killing people.  Without giving away any more of the plot, most of the rest of the movie involves Charlie and his friends trying to survive long enough to kill their new nemesis.

One of the great things about this movie is that it isn't trying to add some weird twist to the idea of vampire movies.  It isn't a comedy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-at-First-Bite/dp/B00094ARKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love at First Bite</a>), a grand drama (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Interview-with-the-Vampire/dp/B00004RFFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Interview with the Vampire</a>), an action movie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vampires/dp/6305258287/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vampires</a>), etc.  It's a suspenseful vampire movie.  Period.  That sounds like such a simple idea, yet I've rarely seen any other vampire film actually pull it off like this one.  We meet a small group of fairly interesting people, they're put in danger, and we spend the rest of the film on the edge of our seats hoping they get out alive.

Finally, this movie is worth watching just to see Roddy McDowall's performance.  The entire cast does a great job, but McDowall really stands out as he plays a washed up actor.  A small and frightened man, he is forced to confront extreme terrors or die.  McDowall is so expressive and believable that the movie gains a depth that another actor might well have failed to deliver.

14542,5,0767817664,"""Fright Night"" is a very fun, frightening tale about a boy, Charlie Brewster, played by William Ragsdale.
 (Remember, Herman's Head on Fox?)  His girlfriend, Amy, who he has been pressuring into having sex, is played by Amanda Bearse, who is probably best known as the annoying neighbor, Marcy, from Married with Children.  Suddenly Charlie is more interested in learning who his new neighbor is and not so interested in Amy.
Stephen Geoffreys plays Evil Ed, with his annoying voice and his nerdy looks, he pretty much steals alot of the show with his antics.
My favorite in this movie has to be Chris Sarandon, who plays Jerry Dandridge. He is the vampire, and he is very sexy.  A perfect choice for the role.  I also thought Roddy MacDowell was very good as the fearless vampire killer, in movies, but when it comes to real life he doesn't seem to have much faith.
The story unravels as Charlie learns that Jerry is in fact and vampire.  He is trying to convince his friends that there is a vampire living next door.  and Roddy Macdowell enters when the friends are trying to convince Charlie that vampires don't exist.
This movie works for me..it's fun to watch, and the special effects are decent.  The acting is by far much better than it is in most horror movies.

14544,4,0767817664,"Young Charley Brewster discovers that a murderous vampire has moved in next door, but his mom, his girlfriend Amy, and his kooky friend Evil Ed don't believe him.  To convince Charley that he is in error, Amy and Evil Ed hire the late-night TV horror host, Peter Vincent, to subject the purported vampire to ""the test.""  But once the motley troupe enter the vampire's lair, the FRIGHT NIGHT truly begins.
Despite a predominately youthful cast, this is definitely not the average cookie-cutter teen horror flick.  Writer-Director Tom Holland's boy-who-cried-wolf script is both humorous and scary, and he has ingeniously employed all the typical conventions of the vampire sub-genre in fresh and interesting ways that sidestep the cliche.  This, combined with outstanding special effects and top-notch performances, helps rank FRIGHT NIGHT among the cinematic vampire classics.
The acting is excellent.  The three younger principals-William Ragsdale as Charley, Amanda Bearse as Amy, and Stephen Geoffreys as Evil Ed-all deliver their roles with an honesty few young actors can achieve, and they are therefore quite convincing as teenagers facing a horrific situation.  But it is Chris Sarandon and Roddy McDowall that truly carry the film.  As the vampire neighbor Jerry Dandrige, Sarandon is at times flippant and at other times downright terrifying.  He knows just when to play it straight and when to be a ham, and he never misses a beat.  And veteran thespian Roddy McDowall is perfectly cast as ersatz vampire hunter Peter Vincent.  He handles his character's shift from Shakespearean bravado to whimpering cowardice (and back!) so deftly that his performance is nothing less than a sheer joy to watch.
The bulk of the special effects, and therefore the biggest shocks, come during the last third of the film.  But that doesn't mean that the first part of the film isn't scary.  Even in the lighter moments, Writer-Director Holland maintains a spooky atmosphere throughout, and he is helped in this by Sarandon's smarmy vampirish charm and by Ragsdale's convincing depiction of a young man spiraling into the pit of abject fear.
The DVD version of FRIGHT NIGHT doesn't have a lot of extras, but it's still well worth the cost.  To quote the trailer: ""If you love being scared, this could be the night of your life!""",1003017600,8,2320,5.122015915119364

He begins to see very mysterious happenings involved with them, and when he reports them, nobody seems to believe him.

The story was well written, some of the old vampire cliches  are there, but not in the same old way like the crucfix tht does not effect  the vampire because Peter Vincent needed to believe for it to work. The  visuals are great, there is gore, but fortunately it is not overdone. Roddy  McDowell was a great choice as the vampire killer. The few scenes of him as  a movie vampire slayer were a hoot. Chris Sarandon is a very suave vampire,  certainly one of the best vampires in a modern setting. This is certainly  one of the strongest horror films of the 1980's.",965174400,2,948,4.5058823529411764

Next to RADU( SUBSPECIES) Vampire Jerry Dandrige(Chris Sarandon) is one very bad Vamprie,Roddy McDowell is perfect as PETER VINCENT:FEARLESS  VAMPIRE KILLER, and William Ragsdale as Charlie Brewster (the stubborn  teenager who tries to tell everyone about the Vampire who lives next-door  and no one believes), and Stephen Geoffreys as Evil Ed, plus Amanda BEARSE(  T.V's Married with Children) as Charlie Brewster's girlfriend.(can you  believe it I forgot her character's name, and I just watched this movie  again about 2 days ago).

I think  there should be a Fright Night official webpage with all sorts of stuff  containing pictures, scenes of the movie, and everything about the movie,  with sound effects and even movie clips.

My favourite character is evil ed with Chris  Sarandon a close second. My favourite scene has to be the famous nightclub  scene in particular the bit where Charlie tries to hit Jerry who catches  his fist. But the magic is in the soundtrack where once again Brad Fiedel  proves how good he really is,the songs by Autograph,Sparks, Ian Hunter and  White Sister all being rip roaring slabs of classic 80s rock,and as i did a  couple of days back i urge anyone who remotly liked the soundtrack or 80s  music to grab a copy of the score as it is an absolute master peice.",957052800,3,742,4.257142857142857

The horrible transformationthat Jerry Dandrige takes on is exactly how I always thought  Vampires should look. Not the black cape Bela Lagosi look. And the part were  he crushes the Cross and saysYou got to have faith for this to work on me  Mr Vincent. And digging up the Banister with his fingernail was just  cool. Chris Sarandon is the bestVampire ever. Cool,Class and scary. Check  out his walk when he is in Charliesmothers room. I sware he is gliding.

I've read the reviews below about how great Sarandon and McDowall were, and believe me  they were, but the best was William Ragsdale.  As teenager Charlie  Brewster, he conveyed a realistic teenager who has no idea what to do about  his 'different' neighbors.  He took this from a scared, curious boy at the  beginning of the flick, to the headstrong man that helped rid his town of  demons.  Give the guy some credit, he held his own against McDowall and  Sarandon.  So buy this if you can afford it, it's a classic and it has held  up over time.

7788980,5,0767817664,"First, let me say, really, Eureka. This is the best release for both picture and audio and it was put out by the wonderful people over at Eureka in the UK. Second, let me say that I really hope you'll watch this one, whether you buy this version or not. This film is special and endlessly enjoyable.

How enjoyable? Well, I can still remember how crummy I felt on the day I realized that Fright Night had been released on Blu-ray in the US and I had missed it. I was rather desperate for an HD copy and this was near the top of my list for film I most wanted to see remastered. That original release was sold out and I was, to put it mildly, genuinely sad. Cut to 2017 and a friend says, ""Hey'd ya see the new Fright Night?"", to which I responded, ""Why would anyone think Fright Night would work in a tract neighborhood with a sexy Mom, uber-sexy girlfriend and Colin Farrell? How's it supposed to feel like real life?"", to which he responded, ""The new Blu-ray"", to which I responded, ""Go, look it up. Look it up now."" I purchased on the spot, with no knowledge of special features, as the description he had given while typing here on Amazon was, simply, ""AWESOME"".

I've watched this Blu-ray several times now, including all the features, and, to be clear, this is, actually, quite AWESOME. The remastered transfer is beautiful. The film looks better than it did the first time I saw it (in a theater) and sounds absolutely fantastic. It has that striking, cinematic quality we are all looking for in a home viewing that is meant to substitute for what it used to be like going to the movies. The disc includes several featurettes, extended interviews, a 146 minute version of the incredible retrospective documentary, ""You're So Cool, Brewster!  The Story of Fright Night"", on loan from Cult Screenings UK LTD (the full doc is much longer and has even more special features), a bunch of photos and such, and, most importantly to me, the full Fear Fest REUNION PANEL, that is including the question and answer session at the end, from 2008 with the surviving cast (the great Roddy McDowell sadly passed away in 1998) and directors of both Fright Night and Fright Night 2.

What else can I say? If you are looking for Fright Night, this is the Blu-ray edition with all the bells and whistles, the best they've made in any country, as of 2018, the Eureka edition with ASIN  B01MTZUC46 . I have since compared to the better-encoded of the two sold out US editions, which weren't as good on picture quality and which lacked the many, many features on this magnificent, did I mention, REGION FREE disc. I love it and I hope you will as well. Good luck finding what you're looking for.",1523404800,2,2681,4.496919917864476
