Performances, obviously, are exceptional (Sidney Poitier &  Rod Steiger, Henry Fonda, Earnest Borgnine, and others I was surprised and delighted to see).  These DVDs will remain in my collection for many years.",1437436800,,254,5.461538461538462
8644137,5,B00IOFMZV0,"All 3 classics in their own right.  Superb acting and excellent storylines.  In the Best Picture nominated  ""12 Angry Men"", you felt you were sitting in that deliberating room deciding the fate of a young Hispanic defendant charged with the murder of his father....... in ""Marty"" ,( Oscars for Best Picture and Ernest Borgnine received an Oscar for Best Actor)  it's about 2 lonely, plain looking 30ish single people who find each other and experience happiness.  Wonderful, Wonderful movie.
 In the ""Oscars for Best Picture & Best Male actor for Rob Steiger) Heat of the Night, it's classic progressive North vs  the old South politics and bigotry.",1424736000,,649,5.009345794392523
