3730303,5,B001OI36GW,I thought it was excellent. The site also had quite a bit of informaton about Dr. Gonzales which was what Ihad been looking for for a long time.,1350950400,8,144,4.178571428571429
3730304,1,B001OI36GW,"Don't waste your time and money on this DVD. According to Amazon, custom made only by your order.  On the Amazon web site, there is a disclaimer that this material is presented by an ""ACTOR"".  This is a terrible presentation.

 I bought this DVD because it was linked with a BLOCKBUSTER:  ""Burzynski Cancer is Serious Business"".  With all due repect for Dr. Gonzalez, (I am sure he is very ably qualified),  the Gonzalez DVD is an extremely boring, disjointed & pedantic lecture in which the speaker incessantly rambles and meanders for about 1 1/2 hours referencing anecdotal stories, and bits and pieces of history. Interesting: Yes.  Cohesive: no.  More appropriate and useful information could have and should have been included and referenced with use of at least basic audio visual aids.

At the end, this viewer came away with dissapointment.  The doctor's time might have been spent better pursuing other strengths which I am sure he has. And THIS doctor's time, (mine) might have been better invested not viewing the DVD.

Forgive my humor, but, to any of you who have trouble sleeping, please buy this DVD.

3730305,5,B001OI36GW,"I read the valuable, but to the lay person an extremely dry clinical style book by Dr. Gonzalez called, One Man Alone: An Investigation of Nutrition, Cancer, and William Donald Kelley [Paperback].  I decided to buy the DVD so that I could learn the information about Enzymes and Cancer in an easier way and to see Dr. Gonzalez speak in person.

I'm so glad I did.  Dr. Gonzalez is an interesting speaker.  I recommend setting your DVD to display minutes or progress display of some sort so that you can mark places in the lecture you'd like to revisit.  There is a lot of information and Dr. Gonzalez delivers the information very quickly and almost non-stop.

This could have been an audio file as there are no visuals, except watching Dr. Gonzalez deliver the lecture - even so I would opt to watch him versus listen to an audio file.  It is much like attending any good university lecture where you leave energized and informed versus seeking caffeine and sugar.

I have no idea if Dr. Gonzalez reads these reviews, but on the off chance I would like to say thank you!  Thank you for bringing Dr. Kelley's work to light and carrying it forward and for continuing in this important work!",1314921600,59,1189,4.570754716981132
3730306,5,B001OI36GW,"I recently purchased this DVD and would like to encourage others interested in curing cancer and understanding it's origins, to purchase this DVD also.  It is simply excellent and well worth the price.  The first half of the DVD outlines the history of cancer research and the origins of cancer - something most doctors do not even understand, they blindly treat without knowing the process by which cancer develops.  The second half focuses on Dr Gonzales' experience with Dr Kelley, who cured his own pancreatic cancer and aided thousands of others to see their own cancers cured.  I found it a valuable addition to Kelley's book, ""One Answer to Cancer"" as it explains the origins better and the biology behind cancer development. Dr Gonzales is clearly one smart cookie and really knows his stuff but he also seemed refreshingly down to earth.  Every cancer patient needs to hear this information, knowing the origin helps tremendously to know what one can do with diet and supplements to effect a cure or at the least delay a progression of disease.",1267574400,80,1053,4.893258426966292
3730307,5,B001OI36GW,"I am impressed by Dr. Gonzalez' courage and perseverance in examining what appears to be a viable and extraordinarily innovative approach to cancer treatment.  I admit that I was initially prepared to hear the usual alternative medical mumbo jumbo, accompanied by unwarranted diatribes against traditional medicine.  Dr. Gonzalez pleasantly surprised me with a highly intelligent, well researched approach to tumor biology and treatment.  This DVD serves as an introduction to his work, which is expanded upon in a multi-hour lecture he gave to the Royal Society of Medicine in London.  This is clearly and enthusiastically presented material describing a scientific and promising approach to a most difficult problem.",1252627200,50,718,5.62037037037037

3730341,4,B001OI36GW,"I love Dr. Gonzalez and was shocked as everyone else to hear of his untimely passing.

This video is a taping of one of his lectures he gave before a live audience. The information is worth the price of the video but Dr. Gonzales, possibly due to time constraint, speaks very fast throughout this video. He lays out a lot of ground work leading up to why enzymes are the answer that need to be laid out to bring credibility to his point that some may find boring. The video taping isn't high quality, it was someone taping a live lecture. But worth having the information on video.",1442880000,12,581,4.37962962962963

3730345,5,B001OI36GW,Dr Gonzales talks continuously for 1hr 42min with the most comprehensive history of how enzymes were found to have curative properties of cancer.  This is one of the most interesting stories I have heard about cancer treatments.  It is wonderful to know that the treatment programme is working exceptionally well to this day which makes one take more notice of this philosophy.  Fascinating,1414108800,5,390,5.158730158730159
