5962477,1,B00F0R0FY4,"I could not watch the DVD because it is made for region B I believe it said, and will NOT play on my BluRay player.

I guess I must have missed Amazons site saying it was a region other then a USA type DVD.

In the future, might I suggest that you make it quite obvious and BOLDLY state what region any given DVD is made for.
thanks",1397606400,,332,3.8676470588235294

8611186,5,B00F0R0FY4,"Bummer that many did not pay attention to the region.  I would love to have this on Blu Ray as my computer will play it just fine linked to my entertainment system.

This is one of the best movies of the period.  The visuals, dialog, and music are fantastic.

You can rent (and I think buy) this on amazon Prime.",1453593600,,312,4.15

8611188,5,B00F0R0FY4,"Great retro movie. Very good acting by all involved.  Granted, perhaps just a bit cliche and over the top but you don't watch escapism movies in order to be grounded in reality. Truly great rock & roll music throughout the movie.  As for the folks that can't read and bought the DVD for a region that it's not for, get a life. You don't give a bad movie review because of your own stupidity.",1437523200,2,391,4.27027027027027

8611190,5,B00F0R0FY4,"Don't ya just hate when these stupid ****s lower a film's rating because THEY didn't pay attention? One of my favorite films, there's tons of reviews elsewhere, I just have to help raise the rating. I have an All-Region Blu-Ray player (buy one NOW!) and the film looks stunning, with great extras including a RECENT CAST REUNION! If this dosen't tempt you to upgrade......",1422489600,9,372,4.828125
8611191,1,B00F0R0FY4,"What a load of garbage. It should have been listed that this was a ""Region B"" disc and will not work on certain players. Nice scam.",1406592000,,131,4.076923076923077
8611192,1,B00F0R0FY4,Was in the wrong format or wrong region. I really wanted this one. Will have to settle on the standard DVD version instead of Blue Ray,1404172800,,134,4.1923076923076925
