7834329,5,6302970016,"Laurence Olivier did not give many interviews but he made an excellent choice when he agreed to partake in this retrospective of his life, which was edited and presented by Melvin Bragg (now a Lord, as was Olivier).

Bragg is a wonderful interviewer - incisive yet always a gentleman, admiring but never fawning - and his narration, choice of topics and selection of film clips is delightful and unerring.

He converses with Olivier, (as opposed to merely ""interviewing"" him) and did so over the course of a number of months, in a number of different situations. The result is a vivid, engaging, and moving portrait of a remarkable man who was made a Peer and remains peerless.

The VHS is of fine quality, but I hope that someday the program will be made available in the more lasting DVD form.",1365379200,,795,4.664285714285715

Laurence Olivier, who was always considered a very private individual, let his guard down, and specifically went out of his way to be as insightful as possible during the making of this documentary.

He does set a few limits. He refuses to rehearse a role in front of the camera. That's no joking matter - don't go there. When asked how he could play two extremely opposing roles on the same night (as he once did on the London stage, playing a double bill of OEDIPUS, followed by a light-hearted comedy role in TARTUFFE), Olivier is evasive: ""An actor spends 20 years of his life learning and perfecting his craft. It's a set of techniques that are built up over time."" The interviewer asks for more insight. Olivier, somewhat annoyed, responds: ""The whole point was showing off my versatility. That's precisely what I've been working for my entire life! The ideal would be that nobody would recognize me from the previous play.""

The documentary covers Olivier's childhood. He tells numerous stories about his growing up. The most interesting anecdote is that after a favorable response from church attenders, his father insisted he become an actor. Olivier had appeared in some church plays, and looked forward to joining the British military service and going over to India - the same way his older brother did. No. His father was adamant. ""It's quite clear that your destiny is to be an actor."" His father sent him off to London to audition for the headmistress of a major acting school. Olivier's father told him - he HAD to win a scholarship, because he simply could not afford to pay for the school.

Lots and lots of fascinating stories in this documentary. Olivier recounts how he had a horrible case of the ""giggles"" whenever he went on stage. A terrible affliction he had for years.

His life-long friend Ralph Richardson is interviewed throughout this documentary. Unfortunately, the sound level is low on all of Richardson's interview footage. He mumbles a bit, but is very animated and gesticulates frequently - so you are able to grasp what Richardson is saying, by his quirky comic gestures.

This documentary covers Olivier's first trip to Hollywood. His subsequent return to British Film. His second trip to Hollywood. His marriage to Vivian Leigh. His Shakespeare films. And his time spent as director of The National Theatre.

By 1973, due to poor health, he had to stop acting on stage. But, throughout this documentary, Olivier's love of the theatre stays in the foreground. He seems somewhat embarrased by his initial work in movies. ""I did films because I had to. I needed the money."" Well, he was fortunate for films. Later, in his life, with his deteriorating health, it was the only way he could continue to act.

We are fortunate to have such a thoughtful documentary of Olivier. Richardson died just one year after this film was made. Olivier passed away a mere 7 years later.

LAURENCE OLIVIER: A LIFE is basically an autobiography on film. The 75-year-old Olivier openly discusses many aspects of his life. This documentary makes you feel like you are visiting with an old friend. However, if the subject turns to his craft - watch out! Olivier guards his acting techniques with the ferocity of a pit bull.",1152489600,6,3422,4.8061224489795915
