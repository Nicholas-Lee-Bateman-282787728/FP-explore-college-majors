4950393,4,B0064M88ZC,"Hiyori is a shy country girl. She spends most of her time gardening and farming. For some reason, she has a thing for Tomoki. She is too shy to say anything because he is always surrounded by beautiful girls. One day she gets the courage to join the New World Discovery Club. She is accepted and liked by the other members. One day an accident happens and she begins to vanish from everyone's memory. Was she really even there? Who is this new Angeloid that looks just like Hiyori, and why is she attacking?

This movie was kind of disappointing at first. I am a big fan of this series, and I expected something a little more. The first 45 minutes of the movie is a recap of seasons 1 and 2 told from Hiyori's perspective. At the 30 minute point, I was really frustrated. I fast forwarded to the 45 minute point. That's where Hiyori joins the club. The second half of the film is pretty good. It's what you would expect from this series. I think that the recap from Hiyori's viewpoint was an attempt to introduce her character, but it could have been done much better. One of my favorite parts is a really touching scene where Nymph crawls in bed with Tomoki to comfort him. It's one of those moments where her sweet side shows. I wish there had been more original material, but it's a good setup for the next season. Overall, I'm pretty happy.",1362009600,9,1344,4.376
4950394,3,B0064M88ZC,"I was really look forward to this movie, having enjoyed the first two seasons but watching this movie was basically like watching seasons 1 & 2 on fast forward. There was an exception to the last maybe 45 minutes that was new material instead of a recap. I did enjoyed the different perspective and cant wait to see season 3. I'd hold off from buying this, I was more disappointed than anything.",1362009600,,395,4.5
4950395,4,B0064M88ZC,I just got it in the mail from Amazon and watched it without interruption.  The animation is by far the best I have ever seen but for the most part it was redone scenes from the first two seasons.  It was almost like watching a slightly extended version of different key scenes.  I thought it was a great movie but the total original content was only about 20 minutes or so and I was hoping for more.  It definitely makes me want to see the third season.,1361923200,4,454,4.183908045977011
4950396,5,B0064M88ZC,"I don't have a comment to make, just a question.  Why do so many United State citizens feel the need to insists that anime is best watched with English sub?  They say this as if it somehow validates them as a true anime fan.  You can be a true fan of anime and yet enjoy it in the language in which you speak and understand.  This ideal of being anti English language somehow separates you from the average American anime fan is ridiculous and foolishly arrogant.",1361836800,2,463,4.348837209302325
4950397,5,B0064M88ZC,"If you're a fan of the series this is a must have!  As other people have said, this takes place after season 2 and prior to season 3.  The ecchi ""pervy"" scenes are mainly for comedy purposes and some fan service but the plot is much deeper and unique.  Best watched in Japanese with English subs.",1361318400,2,296,4.25
4950398,5,B0064M88ZC,He will really enjoyed it. We wil be getting most of his movies here. It was all I had hoped for at a reasonsable price.,1361318400,,120,3.84
4950399,5,B0064M88ZC,"I completely agree with  Alan Villegas. its a great way to get ready for season 3 (witch i cant wait for!) its pervy but touchy they did a great job on this one. Im a big fan of this anime and I have been waiting for it to be released here. So this is definitely a buy for me! And for you guys that RALLY understand anime this is worth to watch.

I currently own season 1 witch is awesome and WILL be geting 2 and this one.",1358812800,4,423,3.7954545454545454
4950400,5,B0064M88ZC,"For fans of the series this is not only a continuation of the series as it's a bridge between season 2 and season 3 (which will be released in a few months) but also a recap of previous episodes shown in a different point of view.
This divulges into the ""Hiyori Kazane"" arc, a resident of Sorami City and the film's main heroine, and she introduces herself and explains how she met and fell in love with Tomoki, while also narrating about how she took part in several events from the two previous anime seasons, all the while observing Tomoki and his friends, and even becoming acquainted with most of them.
While staying true to the series it shows Tomoki's usually pervy high-jinks, but also divulges into more of what the Synapse really is and how the world that many of the characters are in isn't ""reality"".
This movie is a great way to prepare for the 3rd season so for fans of the series buy it.
(Edit)
It seems that Kadokawa Pictures, the owners of the anime series, are no longer going to make a 3rd season and instead adapting it into a second movie and thus ending the series.",1358380800,34,1087,4.412935323383085
4950401,5,B0064M88ZC,Good but it's gonna make your jaw drop. There are quite a few big changes. It's mostly a flashback from a Hiyoris view. It also shows some things you will not see in the third season which might be a plus. It's how you wanna look at it i guess. Do i recommend buying this? Yes it's quite good i just want to make it clear that it's not going to pretain to the new season coming up.,1331856000,,381,3.8974358974358974

4950416,5,B0064M88ZC,"If you love ""Heavens lost Property,"" then you'll most likely like this movie as well. The first forty minutes of the movie sort of shows all that happened from series one and two while bringing in a different character. Then towards the end it starts to pick up a bit. So it was not thaaat great of a movie, but I liked it because I'm a fan of the show. The trailers not too bad at all either, give that a watch before buying. I hope they come out with a third season soon.",1473379200,3,473,4.042553191489362
4950417,3,B0064M88ZC,This is a fun anime.  It only gets three stars because of how it operated with the fan service.  Either have fan service or don't.  It is really irritating when it has all kinds of rather mature subject matter and then doesn't actually have any kind of nudity.  Trying to please everyone with a milquetoast representation of fan service without going all the way just irritates people.,1470096000,3,385,4.701492537313433
4950418,4,B0064M88ZC,"I wanted to give it 5 stars, I love the show that much. BUT...as others say, it spends half of the show recapping previous episodes; from a new stand point, yes, but I really wish there was more new material. There was so much more they could have done with both Hiyori and Tomoki. There is one scene that is almost as funny as the 'flying flock of pantsu', I will leave that to be discovered. Another reviewer mentioned the scene with Nymph comforting Tomoki. This was absolutely needed and I wish they had spent more time on Nymph as a free angeloid. My favorite angeloid is Astreaa, Baka Baka Baka, but I always felt empathy for Nymph; the smart one but the lone one. She really deserved more time and more chances to be happy, especially after the abuse she suffered.

I bought this later than most of the reviewers (when the price was less than half of the original $35) and it came quickly and in new condition. Was it worth $15? In a heartbeat. $35? Not so sure. If it were out of print, sure.

Anyways, if you really liked Heaven's Lost Property, you need to see this. If only for the 30 minutes of feeling like you felt when you first watched HLP: horrified, giggly, shocked, bewildered and falling on the floor laughing. I read a meme about 'Soul Eater' (also a favorite of mine) - 'Soul Eater, the one anime to make you ask aloud ""WTF is going on?""' Sorry Maka, HLP and Angeloid top that, and with Fudge sauce!",1468195200,,1421,4.3584905660377355

4950421,5,B0064M88ZC,The first part of the movie is flashes through scenes from the anime but was funny anyways to see them again with the extra character added.

4950467,4,B0064M88ZC,I was torn between three and four stars but decided on four in only because I love the anime. Half of it is like a recap of the series. Unless you've never watched it will feel like an agonizing drag. To the point once it's done with the literal hour long recap it picks up fast I only wish it was longer so I could enjoy the main story more. Other than that it was a good movie and any fan should at least see it just once.,1439251200,,424,3.8295454545454546

4950490,3,B0064M88ZC,"The only thing I have against this movie is the first half has new stuff mixed in with a clip show. I guess they just wanted to make this long enough to make it a movie without editing the manga arc as it was, but please never add a long clip show into a movie mixing it in with the new scenes. It's in a way that you can't just skip ahead to where the movie starts. Maybe if people needed a refresher add the clip show into the special features or just don't have a clip show in a movie.

As for the movie it's pretty good, but do be ready for some major feels at times. If you liked the series then there shouldn't be anything holding you back from this.",1418774400,,656,3.9323308270676693

4950520,4,B0064M88ZC,"While I loved the series, and definitely enjoyed this movie, the movie starts with 30-45 minutes of recap which pretty much adds no material to the show. If someone has not seen the series, I don't think the recap is good enough to bring you up to speed, so it's best to watch the first two seasons first.

After the overly extended recap, the new material starts to build on a ""new"" character; not really ""new"", but she had about two scenes in the prior two seasons. I'm not really willing to give spoilers, but there is some nice stuff going on here, along with the typical Tomo pervvy behavior. If you're the type who stops a movie at the closing credits, don't.

I've heard rumors that there will not be a third season, and that the second movie (which should have been already released in Japan by now) will be the end of the series. That's a shame. I've really come to enjoy this series, probably more than I should have!",1398643200,3,927,4.383720930232558

The movie takes place after season 2 but leaves an opening for a third, if one were to ever be made. Which I hope !! I do read the manga, but its much more funnier to watch the anime.

4950545,5,B0064M88ZC,"Before I say anything about this movie, I recommend that you watch seasons one & two before you watch this movie. First thing I will say is that it continues the series very well. If you are a fan of the anime series, then you must get this movie because it only continues the story where the second season left off. We are introduced to a new character, who will only warm your heart and make you appreciate the ongoing story even more. Honestly, by the end, you may be crying. I also highly recommend that you watch the post-credit scene or you won't be satisfied with the movie.

Now we've all heard the rumors of a third season and a second movie. The ending of Angeliod of Clockwork clearly suggests a continuation. From what information I have gathered from Funimation and other websites, they planned to release a second movie in Japan next year (2014)entitled Heaven's Lost Property Final. So that would mean that we probably won't see a DVD/Blue-Ray release until 2015. The title ""Final"" clearly suggests that this would be the last movie of the series. As of December 2013, the manga of this story (Sora No Otoshimono) is still ongoing, and I also know that the anime is different from it. Honestly, what movies/TV shows is exactly like the books they're based on?

Overall, if you want to see another movie and/or season, I would ask that you support it by buying the seasons and the movie. The bottom line is if you want this story to continue, you got to support it. Anime is not more than a business. If a product makes money, then the business will continue to make it.  A set of Blue-rays is much more affordable than the fine you have to pay for an illegal download. Plus, you get all the bonus features along with the episodes/movies. What more could you want, right?

Thanks for reading!",1385510400,,1806,4.530674846625767
4950546,5,B0064M88ZC,"What a great movie this was. Starts out with Tomoki fighting off the chicken they left out of Heaven's Lost Property Forte and turning Sohara into a giant to fight the chicken all for Sohara to realize he did it to be a pervert. Deadelus talks about Ikaros, Nymph, and Astrea for a few minutes then it goes into the main story about the girl that Sugata saw in the dome in Forte. The whole first half of the movie is a flashback of the entire 1st and 2nd seasons but the girl that Sugata saw is the main character in all the flashbacks. Soon though she dies and awakens only to realize what happens and is turned in an an angeloid that needs to kill Tomoki. The ending is kinda dumb like ending it with a cliff hanger. Overall it was good and it's hilarious what Tomoki does to that girl.

Worth the $20 I spent for it.",1380412800,,819,4.150943396226415

I so can not wait for a season 3 to come out. until then I'm good with what heaven's lost property has out.,1378425600,,553,4.276190476190476

The first 30 or 40 min of the movie is a recap of season 1 & 2 but from the view of the new heroine. The rest of the movie is all new content. This movie I do not believe will be required to understand everything in season 3 but it will give you some insight and probably answer questions you may have during the upcoming season. I am an avid Heaven's Lost Property watcher and I highly recommend it. The animation is incredibly done and audio is HD crisp and clear. The English dub is amazing as usual for this franchise. Oh and make sure to watch all the way past the credits or you may miss something important and if you felt the way I did when the credits started rolling it may just make you shed a tear of eager joy.,1374019200,2,901,4.067415730337078

Redundant because, for most part, this movie is a ""best of"" collection of the events from the two previous tv series. Same dubbing, same animation, same everything, the only difference stands in Hiyori showing up from time to time just to smile and say her 2-3 lines (those I won't spoil).

This is the premise for the 2011 animated film ""Heaven's Lost Property: The Angeloid of Clockwork"".

What is ""Heaven's Lost Property""?

In 2007, mangaka Suu Minazuki created the manga series ""Sora no Otoshimono"" (Heaven's Lost Property) which was published in the manga magazine ""Shonen Ace"" and is still ongoing in Japan.

With the popularity of the manga series, an anime adaptation by AIC was produced and aired on television on Oct. through Dec. 2009, with a second season that continued in Winter 2010 and a film that was released in June 2011.

With the first two seasons of ""Sora no Otoshimono"" having been released in the U.S. courtesy of FUNimation, a Blu-ray and DVD combo set for ""Heaven's Lost Property: The Angeloid of Clockwork"" will be released in Feb. 2013.

While Hisashi Saito (""Bamboo Blade"", ""Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai"") becomes the chief director of the film, the main director is Tetsuya Yanagisawa (""Fate/Stay Night"", ""Knight Hunters"", ""Eat -Man""), screenplay by Yuuko Kakihara (""Fairy Musketeers"", ""Kage Kara Mamoru!, ""Persona 4: The Animation""), music by Motoyoshi Iwasaki (""Hamtaro"", ""Geobreeders 2, ""Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat""), character design by Yoshiro Watanabe (""Bamboo Blade"", ""Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai"", ""Onegai Teacher!"") and art direction by Hiromasa Ogura (""Jin-Roh - The Wolf Brigade"", ""Ashita no Joe 2, ""Spirited Away"").

The series was known for its mature-themed anime series along with ""Sekirei: Pure Engagement"", ""Rosario+Vampire"", ""B Gata H Kei: Yamada's First Time"" featuring perverse humor, fan service and sexual themes.

""Sora no Otoshimono: Heaven's Lost Property"" focuses on a young high school teenager named Tomoki Sakurai, a perverted young man (who was influenced by his equally perverted grandfather) who has panties and sexual things that are constantly on his mind.  And if there is one girl he occasionally likes to check out, it's his neighbor and childhood friend Sohara Mitsuki.  Who is aware of Tomoki's perverseness and is unafraid to give him her special karate shop and knock some sense into him.

Despite how she tends to dislike his perverseness and constantly beats him up, she knows deep inside that she is in love with him. Sohara is also aware that for some reason, Tomoki has had some unusual dreams involving an angel which tends to awaken him like a nightmare since he was young.

Meanwhile, with the start of a new school year... Tomoki meets Eishiro Sugata, a scientist who is trying to discover a ""New World"" and his friend Mikako Satsukitane, a buxom sadist who has a mafia background and is also the Student Body President.

One day, while Tomoki was outside, he sees something in the sky, a UMA (Unidentified Mysterious Animal) and she happens to crash land on Earth.  The UMA reveals herself as Ikaros, a ""Pet-Class Angeloid, Type Alpha"" and together, the two are bonded by an invisible chain and Tomoki becomes her master.

In the beginning, Ikaros is an emotionless individual and because she is bonded to him and goes wherever he goes, it becomes somewhat of an annoyance for Tomoki, but at the same time, he realizes that with her abilities, it can help him make his perverted dreams come true.

Eventually, Sohara, Eishiro and Mikako learn about Ikaros and the two young women try to help Ikaros learn about how humans behave, while Eishiro tries to learn more about her programming and why she was sent to Earth, especially why she chose Tomoki.  And in order to keep the activities of Ikaros private, they join Eishiro's ""New World Discovery Club"" to see if Ikaros may have some tie to this new world of Angeloids and Synapse that Eishiro is currently researching.

Meanwhile, another Angeloid has appeared on Earth, and her name is Nymph, an ""Electronic Warfare Angeloid, Type Beta"" who can't stand humans and is sent to Earth to confront Ikaros. But similar to Ikaros, the more time she spends with Tomoki and friends, she gets to learn about human-kindness and what a nice master that Ikaros has.  Unlike Nymph, her master  (Master of Synapse) is abusive, maniacal and evil...but because she is tied to him, she will do as he wishes.

It is then revealed after a confrontation between Ikaros and Nymph that she was sent by the sadistic leader ""Master of Synapse"" to possibly destroy human-kind, something Ikaros does not want to do...especially now that she has started to discover newfound emotions...love for Tomoki.  But not just Ikaros, but also Nymph as she wishes more and more each day that she had someone like Tomoki as her master.

In ""Sora no Otoshimono: Heaven's Lost Property Forte""

With ""Sora no Otoshimono: Heaven's Lost Property Forte"", the sequel continues a few months later, but this time, a new Angeloid has been sent to Earth to kill Tomoki.  Her name is Astraea, blond, well-endowed and is a close-combat Angeloid, Type Delta sent by Synapse to kill Tomoki, but despite her awesome power, she is very dumb.  So, no matter what she does to try to kill Tomoki, due to her ability to keep falling all the time, Tomoki uses those moments to feel her up.  And at first she is clueless and doesn't like it but she starts to realize that she may be falling for Tomoki.

Meanwhile, Nymph shows Sugata that they can enter their own dreamworld.  But when Sugata ventures into Tomoki's dreamworld, for some reason certain things that can only exist in the dreamworld is also existing in the real world.

And while Tomoki and friends try to deal with Astraea, a new Angeloid named Chaos is sent to destroy Tomoki's friendly Angeloids.

Which leads us to...

""Heaven's Lost Property: The Angeloid of Clockwork""

In the animated film, through flashbacks seen from ""Sora no Otoshimono: Heaven's Lost Property Forte"", scenes from the second series are replayed, but this time, behind-the-scenes is Hiyori Kazane, a teenager who has a crush on Tomoki.  In fact, she has had a crush on him for quite a long time but is shy and not sure how she can get close enough to talk to him.

She sees how fortunate Tomoki is to have friends and a cool group and she wants to join, so she can be close to Tomoki.

And as Tomoki goes into perverted mode and setting Hiyori up for ""special testing"" in order to become a member of the group, Eishiro feels  he knows Hiyori from somewhere...but from where?

VIDEO:

""Heaven's Lost Property: The Angeloid of Clockwork"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  Because this is an animated film and not a TV series, everything from the scenes featured on the TV series and the footage shows much more shading and detail than the TV Series.  Picture quality is much more vibrant, colorful and detailed.  Art backgrounds are well-painted and  there is a good amount of lighting effects, especially when featuring the Angeloid's in battle or Ikaros wings come out. If anything, I found ""Heaven's Lost Property: The Angeloid of Clockwork"" looks very good on Blu-ray and AIC A.S.T.A. did a pretty good job with anime production.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Heaven's Lost Property: The Angeloid of Clockwork"" is presented in English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 2.0. It's important to note that despite me typically watching anime series in Japanese, I chose to watch this series with an English dub because of the better dynamic range but mostly because FUNimation Entertainment really enhanced the perverseness  and the craziness of the series through its dialogue.

Dialogue is crisp and clear with the action-scenes on both lossless tracks utilizing the surround channels.

The biggest difference is the Japanese version, while perverted is appropriate for Japanese audiences while the English dub really runs wild with mature themes and sexual perversion.  But it all comes down to preference.  Both versions are well-acted and I did watch it both in Japanese and English and enjoyed both voice acting, it's just that the English version was much more perverted and the dialogue changes made the series quite fascinating and hilarious.

""Heaven's Lost Property: The Angeloid of Clockwork"" comes with the following special features:

  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by ADR Director Christopher Bevins, Greg Ayres (Tomoki) and Carlie Mosier (Astrea).

EXTRAS:

""Heaven's Lost Property: The Angeloid of Clockwork"" comes with the Blu-ray and DVD version of the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have to say that when it comes to the ""Heaven's Lost Property"" anime series and this animated film ""Heaven's Lost Property: The Angeloid of Clockwork"", there is this perverted humor and style that is so unusual but just so darn funny, that you can't resist watching it.

Yes, the series was created with fan service and major boobage galore, but unlike ""Urusei Yatsura"" or even ""Chobits"", the perverted humor is heightened in FUNimation's English dub but it's the audacious nature of the series and its unusual character, Tomoki that draws you in.  He may be the most perverted guy there is, but he's a guy with a good heart.

The animated film is quite fascinating, because if you watched the series prior to watching this movie, you will see various scenes replayed.  But this time, featuring a character who has fallen in love with Tomoki, no matter how others look down on him, she just loves him.

And as she begins to talk with him, she finds herself wanting to be part of the group like the other girls, but is not sure how to do it.

Of course, the girls are ready to take her in, but for Tomoki, he wants her to engage in his perverted tests.  And as much as things are crazy, perverted and as always, Tomoki getting himself punished for his behavior, there is a side of him that is affected deeply because Hiyori is the first to show her true emotions towards him and confesses.

Of course, ""Heaven's Lost Property: The Angeloid of Clockwork"" is not all about love.  There is the sci-fi element that the series is known for and in this case, what happens when Eishiro recognizes Hiyori from the Synapse?  And why does Daidalos have an interest in her?

Without revealing too much, let's just say that things get action-packed towards the end of the film, but also surprisingly emotional.

So, make no doubt about it, this sci-fi harem anime series is perverted and full of sexual themes but its important to note that there is no full frontal nudity or intercourse or anything like that. Private parts are covered by hair (or some cloud) and if anything, the series is more comedy-driven through Tomoki's behavior and of course, the harem element as we know that Nohara, Ikaros and Nymph have fallen for Tomoki, add in another girl to the mix.  But considering the mature humor, this film is not for the kids!

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is very good because it is a movie and not a TV series but also wonderful acting for both Japanese and English dubs, with a heightened perversion and humorous dialogue for the English dub.  And a pretty wild, audio commentary.

Overall, ""Heaven's Lost Property: The Angeloid of Clockwork"" is actually a very good film if you enjoyed the previous series.  It's full of fan service and sexual humor, so for those not into that, this is not for you.  But for those who are and also enjoy sci-fi action, I do recommend watching the series before watching the film, so you know who the characters are and their part in the series.

""Heaven's Lost Property: The Angeloid of Clockwork"" is an animated film that fans of ""Sora no Otoshimono: Heaven's Lost Property"" will enjoy!",1364601600,,12408,4.938283510125362

ive reviewed the previous shows HLP and HLPF which are the first 2 seasons of heavens lost property

but you DONT really need to watch these before watching this movie as the movie recaps the majority of the seasons

overview
show starts of with tomoki and gang doing the usually crazy stuff, I.e fighting a giant chicken ... with what angeliod fusion. how is this possible ? the answer is YES

after this the show is just a recap (very boring if you have already watched the series)

near the end it gets interesting with a new angeliod appearing with ability to control time
the 3 origionals angeliods must try to save this angeliod

i won't spoil it but i enjoyed it and this movie is the bridge to the upcoming ... SEASON 3 of HLP ! so don't miss it",1363996800,,764,4.314685314685315

4950604,5,B0064M88ZC,"I actually own the original version that came out in 2011, (Japanese w/ English subs.) and was dying to see the English dubbed version.
They really focused this movie on a new character (that you see once in forte) when Sugata runs into the temple.
The movie actually makes you really think, and its a awesome way to prepare for the third season.
Yes season 3 has been confirmed (yay!) which I am very exited to watch. All though they did have some new clips + a bunch of old clips from seasons 1 + 2 but including the back line with hiyori.
The ending to the movie is actually very exiting because it does have a amazing scene at the end with a bunch of action and a bit of drama.

I personally can't wait for the third season, as a die hard Sora No Otoshimono fan, I will be one of the first few thousand people to watch it :P",1363564800,,828,4.111111111111111

4950607,4,B0064M88ZC,"This movie comes as a sequel to season two of Heavens Lost Property, Forte technically. First and formost, this movie stays true to the Heavens Lost Property series. It is perverted beyond belief, a tad confusing at certain points, and overall stupid at times. Part what makes this show great, however, is its ability to still be freakishly good. This movie is rated mature for a reason, do not let little children watch this, and granted I may not be of age myself, but this is really not for little kids. only mature teenagers and adults. It has a bit of cursing though not a crude amount. The bad part of this show is the fanservice and vulgaridy. It does not show um, how to say, private parts, but about twice gets close. And this show believes that two things should be big: hips and breasts. But that also does not make the show bad for boys or girls.
Now for the movie itself. The first half of the movie, not sure exactly how long in, is a recap of the two seasons of the show through the eyes of a previously un-named background character. This is a double edged sword as it is good and bad at the same time. It revisits some of the shows best and funniest moments as well as less exciting ones that nobody cares about. And a mention worthy of its own sentence, the band episode, witch itself is umm a bit more than a double edged sword. Part of what makes this rewind interesting is that this character really was in the show previous to the movie but was just an unnamed character in the background with one speaking role in the entire series. Unfortunately this is overshadowed by the intenseness of how uninteresting this character is, not to say she is unlikable but just plain. After the recap is a bit of brand new material featuring this new character joining the New World Discovery Club, and the events that follow. Not to mention an ending that is not a common ending type for Heavens Lost Property.
Now is the product itself. It is a Blu-Ray, DVD combo pack, which is pretty darn convenient for every reason. The movie is 95 minutes long, remember a bit of that is a rebute of the show. It is in both english and japanese dub as most Funimation products are. The box isn't too bad though it feels like it could be better. Special features include a US commentary, featuring the voice director, the voice of Tomo, and the voice of Delta talking over the movie making their own comments, which is fun but isn't for everyone. original commercials, a promotional video, japanese trailers and previews, the original trailer, the US trailer, and trailers for other products from Funimation. All of which are fun to watch but are not nearly as good as the main event of the disc.
All in all it is a good product in my opinion. If you liked the show and you haven't seen it in a while, you will love this movie. If you watched a Heavens Lost Property marathon in excitement for this movie then you will be bored for the beginning of the movie. If you have never seen Heavens Lost Property, then I would first reccommend watching the show before buying or watching this movie. Yes it has a rebute, but it skips important events of the show due to being from a different view point. So in conclusion, Heavens Lost Property The Movie The Angeloid Of Clockwork is a good movie and a must have for about any anime collection and especially any Heavens Lost Property collection.
Thank you and remember, be as awesome as you were yesterday!",1362268800,,3447,4.455696202531645
4950608,3,B0064M88ZC,"To start off, I am a HUGE Sora No Otoshimono/Heaven's Lost Property fan, but...

Oh, and please excuse the potential typos, etc. I am on a mobile device.

I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed. Especially since I pre-ordered and was looking forward to watching this for a long time before it actually came in the mail.

Well, to start off, a good 60% + of this movie is just rehashed material from the first two seasons of the show. They literally showed the EXACT scenes from previous episodes, except they showed how Hiyori Kazane (the heroine introduced in The Angeloid Of Clockwork) was present at the time and what she saw from her perspective.

Is the movie honestly bad? Ehhhh...A lot of it seems really redundant. The movie itself was alright, I guess, but I feel that the product was a bit overpriced due to the lack of genuinely new material. Mind you, I paid the full $35 + for it. And to me, The Angeloid Of Clockwork doesn't have much ""replay"" value, if any at all.

Also, this is just a personal annoyance, but in their English dub, they pronounced ""buffet"" (by Astraea) and ""bon appetit"" (by Tomoki) incorrectly...You would assume that people who do this for a living would know better, you know?

Another personal annoyance was that this product is about the size of a typical Blu-Ray case. Which is a tad bit unfair since the first season was the size of a typical DVD case. Basically, they don't look ""right"" next to each other on my shelf (I'm fairly OCD).

And this is just a question, but, did they also get new voice actors for some of the characters in the English dub? They sounded a bit off to me.

Well, in short, if you're an avid fan of Heaven's Lost Property (like myself), by all means buy this. It helps support the series financially, but don't get your hopes up. I think this was meant to be somewhat filler for Season Three's upcoming, anyway. Well, as praise, I have to admit that Hiyori is ADORABLE and I hope that she will be returning in the near future. And the scenes that WEREN'T rehashed were pretty good too.

Eh, maybe everyone should just wait for this movie's price to drop, because I definitely feel ripped off for spending so much.",1362268800,14,2187,4.474874371859296
4950609,5,B0064M88ZC,"Overview:

  This movie, for the fist half of it, recaps what happens in the first two seasons from someone else's point of view, Hiyori's. It shows how she was involved with some of the things that happened in the first two seasons. She secretly has a crush on Tomoki and joins their club to get close to him. They spend a lot of time together until something bad happens and she goes back to her real body as an angeloid. She returns to sarimi to try and kill tomoki.

Warnings:

  1. As seen by the rating, this is a mature show and in the echhi catagory. If you are not open to sex or do not like low brow, perverted comedy, do not buy it.
  2. The second part of this movie, I have noticed, does not completely follow the manga.

My opinion:

It is a great movie and a great beginning to the third season that might be released by the end of the year. It is well worth the money and anyone up for perverted hijinks, touching parts that may make you cry, explosive action scenes, and an all around good time should buy this.",1362182400,,1028,4.16751269035533
4950610,5,B0064M88ZC,"This movie was a great way to revisit a fantastic imaginary world and the memorable characters.  The first 40 minutes is somewhat of a ""recap"" of past events,  but don't let this bug you.  This has a purpose with the new character being introduced and really sets up for a more emotional twist of events as the movie progresses. This movie is a great way to set up the 3rd season and a great addition for those that are already a fan of the series. Although, if you haven't seen the first 2 seasons,  I would recommend watching those first. Starts out a little slow but ends with a bang!",1362009600,,587,4.3090909090909095

8492630,4,B0064M88ZC,"This movie was meant to be a bridge from Season 2 to Season 3 of Heaven's Lost Property.  As I made mention in my review for Season's 2, this differs some what from the manga/book version.  I am certain that some people would agree with me giving 4 stars for this review and others may not and honestly I can understand that as well as there is a point to be made on a reason to gripe with this movie.

  Case in point:  This movie though it opens up with a scene showing a little backstory before Ikaros falls down to Tomoki in season 1 and showing a situation in battling against a giant chicken (a fairly humorous scene by the way), this movie contains numerous scenes from season 1 & 2.  In someway a person can purchase or rent this movie to see if they may want the first two seasons of this show as several parts of the first two seasons are highlighted in this movie.  This is done to bring us up to speed on Hiyori which you actually briefly see in season 2 with Sugata as he was using the dive game with Nymph assisting him.  In fairness I can see a person who is not a die hard fan complain that there is not enough new material to justify a purchase or a high rating.  For me, I can overlook most of this except that I was dissatisfied with the ending sequence as there was really no closure satisfactory for me.

  This purchase will give you the standard and blu-ray disc.  I would consider the extras on the disc more or less standard with nothing dull but also nothing monumental.

  One point that I feel needs to be made is that at this point with the show material that is available at this point with Heaven's Lost Property, is that this movie is a falling point that unfortunately drops sharply following this movie.  You may find yourself finding you want some questions answered as there is a point in the movie that adds to the events of Tomoki from season 2 where the group couldn't go into his dream from the dive game but rather found themselves in the synapse by the large pillar ""I think its the rule or written rule"".  Tomoki is not affected as others which makes you ask why and even ask if he is human based on Hiyori's character.  I suggest those interested should read up on the manga to fill in the blanks.  Also it is sad to report there is no season 3 that is known of but there is another movie (Sora no Otoshimono Final: Eternal My Master) and apparently it is the last chapter.  In fact, the final movie moves extremely fast from what I have heard as I haven't seen it just yet but will in the next few days.  There is little hope but I've heard there could be a part 2 to the final movie but it doesn't look good.  In short I've heard most people where more disappointed with the last movie than approved.  With that thought it would've been good for this movie to end strong and it really didn't in my opinion.

  Overall, I am a massive fan of Heaven's Lost Property as I even own anime figurines along with the nintendo ds game.  I am bias and I do love how the character of Ikaros is written and performed by the English and Japanese actress.  Also in all fairness I believe the other cast members are exceptional. Yeah I just really am taken by the progression of the Ikaros character & I find myself rooting for her in every scene.  I enjoy how they pick their spots for the drama and heart tugging scenes throughout all of the perverted adventures of Tomoki.  If you are unsure of this movie and haven't got either of the 1st two seasons, I suggest getting them instead.  I think you would find more closure in the end after season two than the end of this movie.  But if you are a big fan of Heaven's Lost Property than this is a nice pic up.  Once again there is a lot of replayed scenes but if you enjoy the show, you would like this movie in the end. Honestly, I love the show but I was disappointed enough to only give it 4 out of 5 stars.  I just wish there was more in this movie and more seasons of Heaven's Lost Property because I would be picking that up here at Amazon or at least somewhere as soon as I can depending on who has it first.

  Thank you for reading this review and I hope you are able to make a confident decision to purchase or not to purchase.",1488499200,2,4219,4.18091697645601

8492632,4,B0064M88ZC,"I stumbled on the first season and liked it. Juvenile perverted humor but done in the right way. Of course I had to pick up the second and when I found this movie I had to get it.

Just about every long running series has a flash back episode. Dont know why but they just do. Such is the case with this move.

The sequences are from the viewpoint of a new character. Different. But, I would wonder if the time could have been better spent on the new character and even given one of the originals more story time?

Even though the sequences are supposed to fully introduce the character, you should still watch the previous series before this one. You will appreciate the scenes and humor.

Overall, I like the movie but I would consider the price.  Anything over 30?  Hmm. I am not so sure. Maybe if it was not sold anymore.

I heard there was another season or movie planned.  Comments were from a couple of years ago. I would get it.",1485648000,,935,4.2727272727272725
