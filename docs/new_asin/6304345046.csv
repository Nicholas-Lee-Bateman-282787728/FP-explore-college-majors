The two lead actresses are fantastic, and I reccomend this movie to women ages 22-30 in particular. Female friendship is a powerful thing, in all its beauty, and, as this film addresses, at times, its envy. Kevin Corrigan in a small but great role--an underrated actor who deserves great(better?) work. My only complaint is that, in a way, not much happens, but you relate and care about the characters too much to care. ANY film that has a cat named Big Jeans is going to make my faves list..",1041552000,2,631,4.401709401709402
845748,5,6304345046,"In the movie ""When Harry Met Sally"" there is a scene where two of the characters argue about whether or not people give up their single friends, when they get married. The film ""Walking and Talking"" uses this as it's theme in a comedic examination of two women's friendship. Ann Heche (in one of her earlier indie film roles)plays Laura, who gets engaged to her boyfriend, Frank. This deeply affects her close girlfriend, Amelia, wonderfully played by Catherine Keener. Amelia's life is a mess between her cat who has contracted cancer and her long history of bad relationship's (past, present and probably future) with men. Keener really does a superb job presenting us with a women, who is lonely and upset, because she feels she is loosing her best friend to marriage. Anne Heche, also is very good at showing us the flip side of the coin, because her character feels guilty about neglecting her fiend for her fiance'. The film's  excellent supporting cast includes Liev Schreiber as Amelia's mooching, ex boyfriend and Todd Field as the nice guy Fiance'. One special mention should be made for character actor, Kevin Corrigan, who plays one of Amelia's geeky dates. He takes a small role that could have been trite and one dimensional and instead he gives his character real feelings and empathy. His chemistry with actress, Catherine Keener is wonderful. He practically steals all the scenes he is in. The film also has a very enjoyable soundtrack, which includes some excellent tunes from  singer, Billy Bragg and the Australian, New Wave/pop group, Frente. This is a warm movie about the meaning of friendship, that provides some good laughs and entertainment.",1011571200,7,1667,4.971326164874552
845749,4,6304345046,"I don't know of any other film that successfully captures that moment in life between the 'dating' mode and the 'I'm a grown-up now and getting married' mode as well as this film.  As one friend moves toward marriage, her friend played by Catherine Keener has to adjust to feeling left out but also facing the fact that when your best friend gets married, you both leave a kind of gap in the other person's life.  It's not saying that the unmarried friend's life is worse than the one getting married -- in fact, the one getting married might have a life of boredom ahead of her -- but it's about that bittersweet spell in the air when a female/female friendship goes out of its intense mode into one in which the men upon whom women focus their lives inevitably bring about a distance and change in female friendship.  Rented apartments, borrowed clothes, not making much money -- that time in one's life that dissolves once the grown-up changes come along is perfectly shown here.",989193600,2,982,4.6
845750,3,6304345046,"How new relationships and the inevitable changes that occur with the passing of years affects two lifelong friends is considered in ""Walking and Talking,"" directed by Nicole Holofcener.  Amelia (Catherine Keener), has achieved a track record of disastrous relationships with the men in her life, and currently she is unattached and in therapy.  Laura (Anne Heche), on the other hand, is about to become a practicing therapist, but more importantly, she has a successful, long standing relationship with Frank (Todd Field), a jewelry designer who has just, in fact, asked her to marry him.  Laura is concerned about how Amelia will react to their engagement, especially in light of the fact that the only guy who seems to be interested in her is Bill (Kevin Corrigan), a video store clerk who Amelia simply refers to as ""The ugly video store guy.""  Confusing matters somewhat, as well, is the friendship Amelia insists on maintaining with Andrew (Liev Schreiber), an ex-boyfriend with whom she had an obsessive relationship.  And so it is that Amelia and Laura find themselves at a crossroads; regarding not only the direction of their individual lives, but the future of their relationship with one another.
 Working from her own screenplay, Holofcener shows some insight into human nature and the course one's life is often compelled to take.  It's a fairly perceptive examination of emotional vulnerability, as expressed through the character of Amelia, as well as of the strength of resolution we find in Laura.  It's a thoughtful presentation, focused through the interrelationship of the two women and the three men in their lives, which develops a profile that pretty much covers the entire emotional spectrum.  And Holofcener does it realistically and effectively, avoiding stereotypes while making her characters believable, if not necessarily sympathetic.
 Keener is the most engaging of the bunch, affecting a naturalness while painting a vivid portrait of an emotionally challenged, somewhat confused and directionless young woman perpetually mired in an emotional wasteland; all of which Keener conveys extremely well.  And Heche does an excellent job with her portrayal of Laura, who is somewhat self-absorbed, and who has obviously developed on an emotional level quite different from Amelia.  She comes across as rather cold at times, which keeps her at arm's length from the audience, but it allows the viewer to make an even stronger connection with Amelia, whose situation is one with which many will be able to identify.
 Field makes a good impression here, making Frank more than the typical male caricature to which a part like this often succumbs, and Schreiber gives a good performance as well, as something of the masculine counterpart of Amelia, though a bit more on track with his life.
 Kevin Corrigan makes Bill the one with whom you can most readily empathize, however, as he captures the emotional complexities of his character with an extremely subtle, understated performance.  And it's through Bill that we gain valuable insight into the true nature of the other characters.  It's a supporting, but pivotal role, sensitively and effectively rendered by Corrigan, who is a terrific character actor, and a definite asset to this particular film.
 The supporting cast includes Randall Batinkoff (Peter), Joseph Siravo (Amelia's therapist) and Vinny Pastore (Laura's Devil-Seeing Patient).  It covers rather familiar territory, but Holofcener does it quite well, and makes ""Walking and Talking"" an entertaining, if only moderately involving film.  She has a nice touch, and though it may not be anything ground breaking, with the presence of Keener and Corrigan, especially, it certainly makes this endeavor worth a look.",988675200,2,3750,5.293423271500843
845751,3,6304345046,"Humans grow up (or are supposed to) in two stages.  One is when you first encounter the world and your view is forever changed, that's adolescence; the other is when you are out in the world and honing your coping skills on real life experiences.  This film is about that second stage and how a long-time friendship rides out some of the lessons learned.  While it doesn't break new territory in its genre, it is carefully made.  Catherine Keener and Anne Heche are naturals who keep it floating.  I found it genial, but I'm female and past stage two.",988156800,2,551,4.525252525252525
845752,3,6304345046,"The story meandered a bit and seemed pointless at times, but it was a pleasant enough ride nonetheless. Catherine Keener was lovely as always, and Liev Schreiber was charming as Keener's ex-boyfriend who is indebted to the phone company because he has run up too many high phone bills engaging in phone sex with some woman (a stranger) in California. Keener's best friend is portrayed by Anne Heche in her pre-Ellen days, but she is no less annoying for that. This is one of her less annoying roles. Heche's character is a psychotherapist who is going to marry a jewelry designer.  At the heart of the story is the friendship between Keener and Heche and how that friendship changes as a result of Heche moving out of their apartment and in with with her fianc. In this way Keener is really the focal point of the picture because Heche has moved on and is basically happy, which meanwhile, Keener is left working in the same job and living in the same place feeling like she has lost her best friend. The tensions build while Keener feels more and more lost and jealous. Entertaining dialogue and overall good performances from the actors here will keep you watching.",982368000,,1167,4.665048543689321
845753,4,6304345046,"This is such a calm, natural movie, absolutely believable and funny.  Keener and Heche very convincingly play life-long friends who are together, for better or worst, despite the strains and occasional boredom.  Todd Fields and Kevin Corrigan fit in the picture perfectly, and Liev Schreiber is hilarious as Keener's aimless, porno renting ex-boyfriend.  The soundtrack is great, too.",970185600,3,384,5.586206896551724
845754,5,6304345046,"Writer/director Nicole Holofcener's film is low key and likeable. It's about the friendship between student therapist Laura (Ann Heche) and editor Amelia (Catherine Keener) which is tested when Laura announces her  engagement to ringmaker Frank (Todd Fisher). Heche and especially Keener  give such natural and inventive performances that draw you in to these  women's seemingly small concerns - Laura is scared of being attractived to  other men in spite of her engagement, and Keener's cat has cancer, sleeps  with the video guy and is still friends with her ex, Andrew (Lieb  Schrieber). The lighting is sometimes careless. Skin tones tend to become  red in some scenes for no reason and the only visually interesting part is  seeing how much Heche looks like Grace Kelly in her wedding dress. But  Holofcener writes characters with intelligence, sensitivity and humour and  it can be refreshing to see relationships that aren't tortured by  dramatics. This is one of the indie films like Living in Oblivion that  pushed Keener into later mainstream success in titles like Your Friends and  Neighbours, and Being John Malkovich, though her performance in 8MM is best  passed over.",964828800,6,1183,5.223404255319149

I purchased 3 of them and I have to say that I somewhat enjoyed them, but not excited enough about them to suggest them to family and friends.  Of the 3 I purchased, ""Walking and Talking"", Lovely and Amazing & Friends With Money"", I enjoyed the last one the most.

And, ""Lovely and Amazing"" is superb.  As a result of those two pleasant viewing experiences, we rented ""Walking and Talking.""  Holofcener's trademark are her natural, course-of-live screenplays which result in actors who don't seem like they're acting.  You feel like you could know these people.  Of course, when you've got Catherine Keener (the centerpiece of the three films) to deliver your lines, that certainly adds a lot of credence to your efforts.  In ""Walking and Talking,"" it's a treat to see early efforts by Keener and by Liev Schreiber, in his first meaty role.",1166745600,,743,5.141666666666667

845905,4,6304345046,"A small movie but a note perfect one. Terrific acting from all 4 leads and a stellar support from Kevin Corrigan as the video guy. I found the core Heche/Keener friendship utterly believable - it's a real pity Holofcener hasn't been able to work more, she showed a great eye and ear here (if I owned a movie studio, I'd offer her a long-term contract to make one of these relatively cheap sorts of movies each year for the next five years - actors crawl over broken glass to do this sort of stuff!). Soundtrack mainly by Billy Bragg is *wonderful*. Maybe Holofcener could entice him to get back to that classic Bragg late 80's guitar sound on some new project?

All told, W&T is much better than, say _Kissing Jessica Stein_ or any of Ed Burns's rom com's: I think it's one of the 3 or 4 best rom com's of the 90's.",1127520000,2,815,4.292207792207792
845906,5,6304345046,"This is the film that introduced me to the wonderment of Catherine Keener, Liv Schreiber and Anne Heche.  Plus it has the ultra cool, funny Kevin Corrigan.  A film about 20's somethings and their relationships and what happens when you feel you are losing your best friend to an impending wedding.  Catherine Keener plays a neurotic woman who has no idea what she wants out of a relationship, so she relies heavily on her best friend (Heche) and her ex-boyfriend and male best friend (Schreiber).  They are there to comfort her and are outlets to express her doubts on love and life.  But one of her outlets is about to get married and she has a hard time adjusting to that fact.  It's a good story about life in your 20's.  There is a wonderful appearance by Kevin Corrigan who just steals most of the scenes he is in.  It's not over the top acting (as you get in your better known dramas) and its not just caricatures... It's just a little low-budget film with some really good acting.  The right amount of acting that is required for a film of this quality.  And I found it rather enjoyable.",1078185600,17,1094,4.452261306532663
845907,4,6304345046,"As you may have watched in the recent ""Lovely and Amazing"" movie by the same director, she chooses to focus on the truth in relationships, instead of presenting what's fake and flowery. Amelia is best friends with Laura. They grew up together, lived together, and shared a cat together. Now, Laura is getting married to her live-in boyfriend, and Amelia takes it hard. She is trying to put a handle on this, and at the same time, be single in New York. It seems that she has no other friends really, except for Andrew, a recent Amelia stalker victim, who she once dated. In fact, everyone she dates, she ends up obsessing about for a little while.
This movie is not too well known or accessible, but I have always liked it for the fact that Amelia, played by Catherine Keener, is so real, with her tangly brown hair, and hilarious facial expressions. Although I haven't really been a fan of Anne Heche, she nails the part. She is interesting to watch with her cynical personality, who can be kind of abrasive, though sometimes sweet. She is trying to accept getting married, and wondering whether she wants to be there.
Walking and Talking is fun, depicting a couple at night, stating, ""You want to play around?"" then grabbing a Boggle game from under the bed. Liev Schreiber, who has boyish charm and a machine-gun laugh, plays Andrew. He has a need for ""adult videos"" and stimulating phone conversations with women, he hardly knows. In addition, Todd Field, before directing, ""In the Bedroom,"" always has that sweet, calm demeanor. The characters are hard to forget. Although the story is very simple, it still holds true with healthy and dysfunctional relationships. Anyone who wants to understand women and how they deal with each other should watch it!",1053907200,12,1757,4.7639344262295085
845908,4,6304345046,"I can't stand Anne Heche.  I know this is an earlier film, but that woman irritates me in every single film she is in.  I would give this movie 5 stars if she were not it.  So, let me talk about the ones who made the movie great Catherine Keener and Liev Schreiber.  Their timing together is wonderful and I was far more interested in their relationship than the one Anne Heche was in.  Well, I thought Anne's fiance was very nice and well played, but she was in them and, well you get the drift.  This movie is funny and very moving.

The movie is about friendship, dating, and love set in New York City.  Anne Heche and Catherine Keener play Laura and Amelia respectively.  Laura just became engaged and as her life is changing her friendship is changing with her longtime pal Amelia.  Meanwhile Amelia is trying to find love and is envious of her friend and it seems nothing is going right for her.  Also in the film are Todd Field (In the Bedroom's director) who plays Heche's financee and Liev Shrieber who plays Keener's friend.  The movie is quirky and funny and sad and makes a lot of sense of relationships.",1044576000,,705,4.637096774193548

7868205,3,6304345046,"It's always a pleasure to watch Catherine Keener and Liev Schreiber, and here they are, at the beginnings of their respective careers, playing characters who combine likeableness with irritating-ness in about equal proportions -- that's to say, they're representing ordinary folks as Nicole Holofcener sees them.  For Holofcener herself, this was her first feature, and it's like the other two of hers I've seen in its attention to details of middle class life and an eschewal of the kind of melodrama that passes for realism in our current cinematic conventions.  It's quiet, though that's not to say that its characters aren't a mass of anxieties of the kind that one often reads about in advice columns.  The structure is simple and symmetrical: as Amelia (Keener) has just broken up with Andrew (Schreiber), her best friend Laura (Anne Heche) becomes engaged to her boyfriend  Frank (Todd Field).  No sooner have these changes taken place, but the two young women begin to have second thoughts about them.  Amelia wants connection; Laura and Frank start getting tense with one another.  The two women also become aware of how circumstances seem to be forcing them to see  and consult with one another less as time goes on, so the nature of THEIR relationship also becomes a source of stress.  These are commonplace occurrences, and I think that the popularity of Holofcener's movies has to do with the way in which an audience of a certain age see themselves and all their insecurities in them.  Both women have jobs, and we see them at work, but their work seems to mean less to them than what's going on in their heads about their relationships.

Maybe it's unfortunate that I've seen Holofcener's movies in reverse chronological order.  ""Enough Said"" was an excellent movie, and ""Friends with Money"" was very good.  This one, from 1996, is less interesting.  The problem, I think, is the writing -- Holofcener writes and directs.  I don't think that the characters are intrinsically less interesting than those in ""Friends with Money,"" but the writing seems less effective.  It's not easy to make credible everyday language dramatically pointed without inflating it into rhetoric, and Holofcener, to her credit, never inflates -- but here it isn't all that pointed and fresh either.  In this respect, it's less successful than her later films and a film like Stillman's ""Metropolitan,"" whose characters are equally mundane folks living largely inside their heads.  The actors are credible, and they do what they can, and they're as engaging as the material allows.  It's nice to know that they and Holofcener went on to better things.",1447977600,,2641,5.01605504587156

One of my favorite actors, Catherine Keener, plays Amelia, a woman who has had several romances but none stick. Her best friend, Laura, is a therapist who becomes engaged to her boyfriend. Amelia and Laura have been friends since childhood. When Laura becomes engaged she immediately says, ""What will Amelia think?"" Her fianc&eacute;e could care less. He likes Amelia, but he wants to marry Laura. Amelia is in-between boyfriends, the guy at the Video store asks her out, but she thinks of him as a nerd. Immediately after Laura's engagement she accepts his invite to a horror flick. She hates it, gets anxious. At the same time she as given notice to her therapist, that she wants to quit therapy. When she tries o get back on the schedule, he has already signed someone else up for her spot. Amelia becomes more anxious about her future.

Laura, on the other hand is more confident about her future. A fiancee and her work is going well. But, then, doubt begins to set in, does she over him enough? Is he what she wants? No big crisis and these questions are pretty much sidestepped.

Amelia's video store friend does not call for another date and she worries about that. She is really date able, and she is taking her time to find her true love, but it makes her feel anxious. One of the highlights of the film, is a young,Liev Schreiber, as Amelia's ex- boyfriend. As the film proceeds they get back together again to see if they can work things out.

No big events take place in 'Walking and Talking.' It is a quiet film, too quiet for me.

The film has some moments of small genius (the scenes with Heche and Todd Field discussing a mole on his chest and Keener's interactions with great Kevin Corrigan). The film mostly rings honest when other 90's female films don't. In the end, the film is not saying much, but like Holofcener's other films it's a great slice of life film.
