3792479,4,B001TN1EG6,I started watching the show last season.  I loved it so much that I wanted to purchase the older seasons in order to understand the show's dynamics.,1260316800,,148,4.481481481481482
3792480,5,B001TN1EG6,I started watching The Closer during the fourth season and was hooked and had to get all the previous seasons.  It's such a good series with drama and humor.  It was interesting to watch from season one how Brenda Leigh evolved into who she is in the fifth season.  Can't wait for the new episodes to begin in December.  If you love a good drama series you'll want to watch.,1259625600,2,374,4.3
3792481,5,B001TN1EG6,I love his show !  I could not find these CD's anywhere else for this price. I am enjoying them at my convenience and very satisfied with the prompt delivery.,1258502400,,158,4.266666666666667
3792482,5,B001TN1EG6,"RECIVED ALL FOUR SEASONS IN A-1 CONDITION, & IN ONLY A WEEK - I'LL DEFINATELY BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN!",1251676800,,105,4.3
3792483,5,B001TN1EG6,"Kyra Sedgwick closes cases in her unique way, southern charm with a quick barbed wit that gets the job done.  The interaction with her squad, boss & fellow employees are fun to experience; the drama & humor are good entertainment.  Blend in Brenda Leigh Johnson's personal life and you have a perfect show to watch!",1246665600,,315,4.709090909090909
3792484,5,B001TN1EG6,"This series centers on a soft spoken feminine detective boss with a Southern accent, who, once she gets her teeth into solving a crime and getting the culprit doesn't let go. Her methods leave you gasping with your jaw hanging open most of the time. Her colleagues just sit back and watch in awe (and entertainment). Most of the time, one just doesn't see what is coming. This series is extremely witty, dramatic, well acted, and just plain entertaining. Kyra Sedgewick is amazing in this role. Go on! Get hooked!",1243296000,,513,4.711111111111111
8342075,5,B001TN1EG6,I loved the series when it was on so much I had to have the DVD set.  We've watched these many times and the stories never get old.,1408838400,,131,3.6785714285714284
8342076,5,B001TN1EG6,"All the seasons of the Closer are wonderful. There is the right amount of humor at certain places at just the right moments. The acting is always the best from Kyra Sedgwick A.K.A Brenda Lee Johnson of the LAPD. If you like shows like Castle then this is right up your alley. So pop a bowl of popcorn, get a blanket and curl up on the couch and get ready to be blown away.",1405814400,,372,4.04054054054054
8342077,4,B001TN1EG6,"We've been enjoying this series in reruns, but decided to get the DVD set to watch the episodes in order. Because the characters develop across the first two seasons, I highly recommend buying the DVDs. The series is much more enjoyable when watched the way they originally aired.",1304208000,2,280,4.854166666666667
8342078,5,B001TN1EG6,"The dvd's arrived in a timely manner and, and was everything I expected.  Very nice.  Will buy from again.  Thanks!!",1294444800,,116,4.7

8342080,1,B001TN1EG6,"Love, love, love this series.  Hence the purchase of the ""complete seasons 1-4"".  The problem is the 4 seasons came as 4 separate containers, seasons 1-2 with 2 disks in each pack and an outline of each show, seasons 3-4 were one container with 4 disks with show titles only, and  were then they SCOTCH TAPED THE 4 CONTAINERS TOGETHER!  Amazon I expect more from you.  Very disappointed in this ""set"".  You can save at least $25 by buying each season separately and then you can tape them together yourself (but, why would you want to)?",1282348800,12,536,4.53125
8342081,5,B001TN1EG6,Getting the whole series up to date is wonderful.  This is such a fabulous show.  It arrived on schedule and new.,1280620800,,113,4.333333333333333
8342082,5,B001TN1EG6,"I started watching this series last year, bought the DVD's to catch up.  Very enjoyable and have recommended to friends.",1268524800,,120,5.0
8342083,5,B001TN1EG6,"We really enjoyed seeing this show on TV, so decided to watch the whole series from beginning to end. I purchased the first four seasons for my fiance as a Christmas present, and we've been obsessively watching at least one/day since they arrived. The writing is terrific, the acting is excellent, and the situations drawn with enough shades of moral ambiguity that it's always compelling.

So far, we've watched the first two seasons and it's just getting better. The DVDs contain basic menus, many of the episodes having deleted scenes, and there are some other extras like a gag reel and a mini documentary on Interrogation.",1262822400,5,627,4.915094339622642
8342084,5,B001TN1EG6,"Kyra Sedgewick as Brenda Lee Johnson is the ultimate woman, very feminine, very quirky, very smart and tough when needed!!  The whole cast of characters is perfect!  Love everyone in the show.  They better never get rid of any of them.  They are great!! You will spend hours enjoying this set.  Best gift I have given myself in years!!  The writers of the show keep it current, smart, entertaining, and manage to surprise you and make you laugh even when you don't expect it!  Great all around show.  Best on tv!",1260403200,,512,4.549450549450549
