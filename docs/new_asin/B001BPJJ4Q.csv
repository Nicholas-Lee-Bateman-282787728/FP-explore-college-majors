8284203,5,B001BPJJ4Q,"CBC often brings superb viewing to its Canadian audience (""Murdoch Mysteries"" and ""Republic of Doyle"" are just two of its hit shows). Since moving back to the US, however, I sorely miss having CBC as a cable option; even their evening news (""The National"") is one of the best there is. ""jPod"" is one of those great CBC shows, which I was able to watch as weekly episodes when the series first aired. And, although the series seemed way too short to me, it was nonetheless satisfyingly complete in its single (and singular) season. ""jPod"" author, Douglas Coupland, is truly a Canadian treasure, only a few notches below Leonard Cohen and, of course, Alan Thicke, who played Jim Jarlewski, the main character's father. Not all of the actors are Canadian, however. The lovely Emilie Ullerup (playing Kaitlin Joyce) is from Denmark; she is also known for her role as Ashley Magnus in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sanctuary/dp/B008I34Z34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sanctuary</a>"" (another excellent Canadian series), and more recently acted in ""Arctic Air,"" another CBC series.

The story arch of ""jPod"" through the season is angular and always veering off in unexpected directions on a seat-of-the-pants joy ride. Anyone familiar with Douglas Coupland's writing (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Girlfriend-in-a-Coma/dp/006162425X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Girlfriend in a Coma</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miss-Wyoming/dp/0375707239/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miss Wyoming</a>,"" are two of my favorites) will also be familiar with his post-postmodern worldview and sense of dark humor, which is on full display in this show. Fortunately, ""jPod"" is one of those rare TV or movie renderings that remains as faithful as any I've seen to the original story and, more important, the sensibility and mood of the book. After nearly ten years, I would love to see this show made available as an Amazon video for us Prime members. Also worthy of mentioning here is the fitting theme music, ""Flutter,"" by Bonobo from their album ""Dial 'M' for Monkey."" It always set the tone and prepared me for the mayhem that inevitably followed. If you are an old-school gamer or programmer, you'll love this show.",1481673600,,2318,5.878338278931751
8284204,5,B001BPJJ4Q,A masterpiece by Douglas Copeland. Almost as good as the book.,1427241600,,62,4.7272727272727275
8284205,5,B001BPJJ4Q,This was a great book adaption into a single season show.  Character development was rich in such a short span.  It was constant comedy and a blast to watch.  If you are in the tech industry this is a great show to watch.,1400198400,,221,4.093023255813954
8284206,5,B001BPJJ4Q,"Loosely based on Douglas Coupland's novel 'jPod' (and better for the distance), the CBC's version of jPod is a geek's delight.

Take one standard developer pit, turn up the saturation, sprinkle with suburban grow-ops, ballroom dancing, comic gore, and a love-smitten rogue AI...",1349308800,,278,5.465116279069767
8284207,3,B001BPJJ4Q,"A Canadian TV production is of a twenty-something generation X (Y-?) and their baby-boomer ancestors, murdering and crime surrounding have been screened in a laughable manner and, probably, sustain that what feudalistic-style liberties mean for local folks, highlighted by comparison with China depicted in a way traditionally-prejudiced.

Easy watching for loving gore and sex, foreign viewers from the post-communist and third world countries are especially welcomed.",1338422400,3,469,6.106060606060606
8284208,5,B001BPJJ4Q,"J Pod is extremely well written and well acted (especially Emilie Ullerup and Sherry Miller).  The characters are well drawn, unique three dimensional people.  The dialouge is witty and sparkling.  The show manages to be funny and serious, absurb and dramatic all at the same time.  Everyone should see this show.  It is far superior to anything on the air now.",1282262400,4,361,4.852459016393443
8284209,3,B001BPJJ4Q,"I ADORE Douglas Coupland's writing.

I had to PRE-ORDER 'Generation X' back before it was even released -  based on a review in a December,1991 Rolling Stone. His books, with a couple exceptions, have really spoken to me. I thought with this book he was back to his glory days of 'Generation X' and 'Microserfs.' I have met him a couple of times and several of my Coupland books have been signed.

Yes, I'm a fan.

When I heard that Jpod was going to be a series I was thrilled. More than thrilled.

After the first couple episodes, my interest started to wander. By the time I read it was going to not going be renewed I was actually ok with it.

It was like the 'Lisa the Vegetarian' episode of the Simpsons when Homer's suckling pig goes airborne and he keeps saying 'It's still good....it's still good...' when obviously it isn't going to be the longer it goes on and it's just become wishful thinking.

I generally liked the cast - it was a sympathetic, interesting group - with the possible exceptions of Alan Thicke and Colin Cunningham, who I rather like in other things but was just kind of wrong in this. Alan Thicke just freaked me out - that taut, overly-face lifted face hamming it up for the camera? Ack. Some of the supporting cast actually made it a much weaker effort. Sherry Miller was fine, David Kopp was fine.

The settings were how I envisioned them so that was ok.

I guess I just found the whole effort kind of stilted - either the timing was wrong, or the supporting people detracted enough from the really good main actors carrying the series or I don't know what - the last few episodes just became like the Bataan Death march. Maybe my expectations were too high.

So, although I own multiple copies of most of his books, I can't envision buying this series.",1275004800,,1786,4.450920245398773
8284210,5,B001BPJJ4Q,"Great mental series, if you have any interest in games and randomness then this is a must funnily random comedy series. It's a shame not many people have seen this series im not one to order from USA to the UK but i just had to with this dvd. I have read the book and watched the series back to front to be honest i prefer the dvd. Such a shame the series was cut short. What to expect and great range of characters, unusual plot lines and lots of intertextuality",1269993600,2,463,4.0989010989010985
8284211,5,B001BPJJ4Q,"I'm a huge fan of Douglas Coupland and loved jPod (the book) so I pre-ordered this as soon as it came out on Amazon.ca (Canadian website). After patiently waiting for a few weeks, I received my copy to find that Episode 8 on disk 2 was only a partial episode and would cut back to the menu after the first ""commercial break"". I've read other reports on the same issue on the internet.

I ended up returning my copy and I'll try again someday.

Aside from that disappointment, the DVD is awesome and if you're a fan of Douglas Coupland (especially jPod and Microserfs) you'll LOVE this DVD.",1228780800,3,589,4.444444444444445
