602195,5,6303234674,"I bought this video sight unseen by default when my children's book club sent it to me by accident.  It turned out to be one of the happiest accidents ever.
At first I assumed that my then-two-year-old son would be bored by a musical story of little animated animals wandering through Mother Goose land (This is a kid who worships Bob the Builder).  One day I put it in when a favorite TV show was preempted by the news, and he was entranced.  Soon the production-quality tunes were stuck in both our heads and we could be heard 'round the house singing ""little Bo Peep"" and ""Three Little Kittens who lost their mittens"".  This a great way to memorize nursery rhymes and they will stick with him for life.
In a world of slickly animated action cartoons designed to plug kids for merchandise, this Richard Scarry video is a breath of fresh air your family should not be without.",1035763200,49,877,4.49685534591195
602196,5,6303234674,"This is the best series of infant/toddler videos EVER! My daughter has been watching them for about 4-5 months and she asks for ""Huckle"" and ""Lowly"" every night before bed. She has actually learned some of the songs and she's only 19 months old! We own every one of these fun and educational videos!",971654400,9,299,4.555555555555555
602197,5,6303234674,My 19mos old daughter never watched tv or any video for more then few minuts till she watched this one. She loves it and wants to watch it  everyday. It sweet and simple and quite entertaining. I highly recommend  it.,967939200,6,217,4.4
602306,5,6303234674,"Found this video in the children's section of the local library when three grandchildren were coming to visit.  Two-year-old Maddie suffered a ""classic-toddler fracture"" of her right leg going down playground slide with grandma shortly after arriving.  Together we watched this video about ten times that weekend because it soothed and entertained hurting Maddie.  Subsequently purchased DVD from Amazon.  Since then grandchildren from 6 months to 6 years have enjoyed the quiet, comforting story line mostly when they are ""under the weather.""  It never fails to calm our ailing grandchildren.",1173312000,2,593,5.544444444444444
602307,5,6303234674,"We have five of the Richard Scarry DVDs, but this one is definitely my three-year-old's favorite. (And mine!) It's also a good one to wind down before bed time, as it has a kind of bed time theme.  It's Huckle the Cat's bed time, but he wants to find his friend, Lowly the Worm.  Huckle drifts off to Mother Goose land in search of Lowly, where he meets many familiar characters, such as Little Bo Peep, The Kittens Who Lost Their Mittens, etc.  One thing I really liked about this video is the way they got rid of some of the unsavory parts of the traditional nursery rhymes without it seeming ridiculously PC. For example, the Old Woman who Lived in a Shoe with the prolific family is a rabbit (how funny is that?) and instead of ""whipping them all soundly"" she ""kisses them all soundly"" and sends them to bed.  Countless baby rabbits line up to get a bowl of broth and a good night kiss from mother. It's done so naturally that you hardly notice the nursery rhyme has been ""edited."" Another instance is the Four-and-Twenty Blackbirds baked in a pie. Well, they're not exactly baked in.  The baker tells the blackbirds to hide in the pie to amuse Old King Cole. It makes sense, because he is a Merry Old Soul after all, and in the last scene was dancing a jig with his bubble pipe and encouraging Huckle to stay around for the fun and games in his court.

It ends with a very sweet, old-fashioned lullaby that always makes my daughter look up, no matter what else she's doing. I'd never heard it before. It starts out with the line ""Sleep, baby, sleep. Thy father carts thy sheep.""

I would definitely recommend this title the most out of all the Richard Scarry videos. The singing and the storyline are good quality entertainment, and definitely not annoying!",1172534400,5,1762,4.470404984423676
602308,5,6303234674,I have to say that this is my favorite (and also my daughter's) of the 4 videos I bought my 2 yr old daughter.  She asks for Mother Goose and will sit contently as it plays and even asks for it again.,1169251200,6,200,3.761904761904762
602309,4,6303234674,"The characters are cute, the songs are contagious.  It is a great video!",1163030400,7,72,4.538461538461538
602310,5,6303234674,"I don't own this video, however, I rent it from the public library and my almost two year old loves it!!  We rent it every other week because other parents love the video too.  There are so many catchy and fun tunes. Like other viewers had said, my daughter gets excited and entranced by it too.  My daughter refers to this video as ""Lowly."" I grew up on Richard Scarry books and my daughter will too, along with the fun videos. I highly recommend this video along with the Busiest People ever and the ABC one!  We will be purchasing this real soon!",1158710400,5,549,4.300970873786408
602311,5,6303234674,"Like a previous reviewer said, I am not a fan of TV for children, but we do let our 2-year-old watch about 30 minutes of TV every other day.  We also have the Richard Scarry Mother Goose book (along with countless others) and my daughter loves nursery rhymes, so this DVD is a perfect fit for her.  It has such a cute story and she is always talking about ""Mother Goose Land"" and the characters in the DVD.  The songs are well sung and it has a very slow (but enjoyable) pace.",1152403200,6,476,4.1521739130434785
602312,5,6303234674,"I bought this video when my granddaughter (now 6) wasn't quite 2 years old.  She wanted to watch it over and over.  Now that she has a sister who is not quite 2, she too wants to watch it over and over, and the 6 year old seems to still be enjoying it the second time around.  Kids just seem to be mesmerized by this video. If you have a young child they MUST have this video!  You won't be sorry you bought it.  The one I got also has the three tales now sold as Richard Scarry's Silly Sing Along Stories, and busy people, but I don't see that one for sale... too bad, because they're all great, and it makes a nice all in one video.",1142812800,4,634,3.921875
602313,4,6303234674,"My 2 year old likes this video.  She sits through the whole thing without ever looking away!  I wouldn't say it gets her excited the way her Elmo videos do though.  Some other videos get her off her feet and the Elmo videos have her dancing.  This is a nice, calm video though and a good one for naptime.",1135123200,8,304,4.101694915254237
602314,5,6303234674,"I adore this DVD.  If you loved Richard Scarry books as a kid, you will have every reason to appreciate this DVD.  Huckle leads you through Mother Goose Land on a search for Lolly Worm and on the way meets many of the characters from the Mother Goose books.  The songs are simple, sweet, and well sung with good accompanying music.  Runs at about 30 minutes with no replay feature, but well worth the buy.  My 15 month old daughter is fixated on this video.",1065139200,11,457,4.329411764705882
602315,5,6303234674,"I'm not a big fan of TV/videos for young children, but this DVD is one of the few exceptions in our house.  My 2 year old son loves Huckle and Lowly the worm -- since we have a Mother Goose book, the songs are all familiar to him and that much more fun to see in action.  The animation is not jerky and fast like some other videos and is a perfect 30 minutes in length.  Definitely recommend this one for the preschoolers!",1035936000,19,422,4.0602409638554215

7841402,5,6303234674,I used this for years teaching kindergartners their nursery rhymes and now I wanted a copy for my grandkids.  This is probably the best video of nursery rhymes I've used with children in 33 years as a school librarian.  Little children love this video!,1374278400,,252,4.704545454545454
7841403,5,6303234674,If you buy just 1 children's dvd......this is the one to buy!!!!  It has the best graphics and the singing is wonderful and very contagious!  It teaches Mother Goose rhymes as they have never been taught before.  This is the best and worth every penny!  A+++++++++++++++++++  I misplaced my original copy during a move so invested in a 2nd one.,1358726400,,344,4.666666666666667

So many songs on it,and he do like it
sometime he sing a song",1339891200,,96,3.619047619047619
7841405,1,6303234674,I bought this for my grandsons (ages 11 & 10 months). They were bored to death!!! Not much more to say except I guess you get what you pay for.,1225411200,,143,3.8
7841406,5,6303234674,I first purchased this when my twins were 9 or 10 months old. They love Baby Einstein so I wasn't sure if they'd like this. The Richard Scarry style animation was new to them and they didn't seem interested. After the first few minutes I shut it off. When they were 13 months I took it back out and this time they seemed interested so I watched with them and that is when I realized how good it was. The little scenes and singing are so cute even an adult can enjoy this. My twins love it too. We usually watch it at bedtime since it begins and ends with Huckle the Cat in bed. They will sit and watch the whole thing without getting bored. The songs are all catchy and cute and it's a great way for them to learn nursery rhymes. This is a must have for your child's DVD/video collection.,1187481600,,788,4.123376623376624
