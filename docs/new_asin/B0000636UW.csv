8604181,2,B0000636UW,"This video really only taught one thing: weapon disarms.  It taught how to disarm someone who is holding a knife or gun to your head and that's it.  First, the techniques are easy to learn but laughable.  If the person is moving the weapon around, like he's giving orders to a large group of people and motioning with the weapon, the techniques will still work but be far more difficult to do...and he doesn't go over those applications.

Second, it doesn't teach you anything after the disarms.  Ok, so someone is holding a knife to your head and you take it away...what next???  It doesn't cover that.  It doesn't cover what to do after to you take the weapon or discuss the fact that even though you now have the weapon that the attacker is still a threat.

The format of this video is that the karate gi clad instructor teaches a group of novices these techniques.  The instructor brings one person up, teaches the technique a few times, and then has the person demonstrate it while another partner resists.  There is little to no discussion of actual terrorist pathology or methodology or how to survive a hostage situation.

An ok video on disarm techniques but doesn't deliver what it advertises.  A much better video program on surviving a hijacking is ""BlueSky Tactics"" at [...].  And no, I am not affiliated with that organization in any way.",1286064000,,1352,4.654008438818566
8604182,5,B0000636UW,"I have been in martial arts and self defense for over 40 years. I have trained in many disciplines, taught Amry Special Forces and Rangers, Military and civilian law-enforcements and over 10,000 Americans. I watched the video completely he first time, then watched it the second time and go the feel of the techniques, the way Grandmaster Villareal presented them and the simplicity of the movements. This is a great video for the average citizen who finds their life was in danger and nowhere else to turn. These are easy to learn techniques that most people can do... and yes they do work.

I recommend this video to every average citizen and to self-defense instructors as base to develop you basic terroism survival course.",1148947200,,727,4.862903225806452
8604183,5,B0000636UW,"Mr. Villareal demonstrated techniques that I was able to learn in a short time.  This is the first video I watched where the instructor not only teaches the techniques effectively, but also went into the psychological aspect of effective self-defense.  I really like the series on disarming a pistol and knife from an assailant.  It's pretty deep.  This is not just a technique tape, it's a smart tape, used to train your mind as well.
It's worth paying the small amount they want for the tape considering the stuff you learn could save you or a family member someday.",1035158400,,568,4.707070707070707
8604184,5,B0000636UW,"I purchased this video for my son who is a green belt in Karate thinking that he would be able to learn from it. I watched it with him and was pleasantly surprised that the techniques were so simple, that I could even perform them. I always thought that stuff like this was only for ""Kung-Fu Masters"", but apparently this video was developed for your ""Average Joe"". The best part is that the instructor not only shows  you the techniques, but he also explains the physics behind it so that you can understand why they work. I'm glad I have this video, and I keep showing it to my friends and relatives. With the holiday travel season starting soon. I just wanted everyone to be safe. This is another reason why I even bothered to post this message. God Bless America!",1034899200,,767,4.439716312056738
