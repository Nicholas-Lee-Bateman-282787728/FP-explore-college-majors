2772203,5,B000NKTOQI,I really enjoyed practicing the djembe by following along with this tutorial.  Highly recommend it to all beginners.,1235088000,,116,5.444444444444445
2772204,3,B000NKTOQI,"I am an absolute beginner when it comes to drumming, and this DVD wasn't very helpful for me.  The hand movements are too fast.  Also, I would have preferred that the angles be shot from the same view I'd have while playing a drum instead of the opposite.  It is simply too confusing to watch the hand movements from the opposite direction.  It definitely isn't  a good teaching tool for someone who doesn't already know how to drum.  This DVD seems like it would be helpful for someone who can just listen to the rhythms and pick them up.  I think I might find this DVD useful in the future once I am able to learn the basics of drumming and that is why I rate it with a least a 3.",1206230400,,682,4.121212121212121
2772205,5,B000NKTOQI,"I am impressed at the sheer volume of rhythms that are taught on this DVD. Anyone wishing to become proficient on hand drums would benefit from owning this. This is a straight up DVD showing you the hand patterns for numerous hand percussion rhythms. These rhythms could be used in any drum circle setting or for just playing along with friends on musical instruments. I've been a hand percussionist for many years and there is enough material on this to keep me busy for at least several months trying to learn and commit to memory the volume of different rhythms like Shannon Ratigan has done. I've owned several instructional DVD's on hand drumming and this one has by far the most material and is definitely the best value for the money! A beginning drummer might find this a bit overwhelming at first, but this is not intended as a step by step ""Learning to Play the Hand Drum"" video. This is a must have for any hand percussionist who already has a basic understanding of hand drumming techniques OR for the beginner that can use this for practice after learning the basics of hand drumming from a second introductory DVD or instructor. I highly recommend this DVD!!!",1202083200,,1173,4.671497584541063
2772206,5,B000NKTOQI,"Searching for a demo tape just like this for a long time. Now all one needs to do is book time in one's own mind to practice,and create the space and place to do so. Then follow along until each rhythm is learned by heart -
I will count how long it takes me to learn them all. Then perhaps I will feel the need to meet the challenge of a drum circle,although maybe I can
find another to accompany & play as a two-or-threesome if I get good enough to be able to inspire others. So if you are hesitant to begin on your own here's a chance to begin right from the start and tap some beats then repeat
. . . next thing you know you'll be DRUMMING! Who knows where this might lead! Thanks to Shannon for providing this instructional DVD.",1201996800,,732,4.055172413793104
2772207,5,B000NKTOQI,"As a classical musician (piano and organ) who has always learned by the academic approach, I have thought that I would love to learn an instrument using the other side of my brain! I have all sorts of drums around the house and knew that I wanted a more intuitive, aural approach to learning as opposed to my Conservatory type of training. This DVD was perfect for what I was looking for. There are no explanations about different ways of hitting the drums, no charts or printed how-to's. Nothing written down at all. Just sit in front of a great drummer and try to copy what he is doing. Of course, it is challenging and for a person who wants it slowed down, or notated, or whatever, this is not the approach for you. But most any DVD player that I have ever used has an A-B Repeat function. Use that and loop these rhythms over and over till they become easy. Then go back and improvise your own rhythms against Mr. Ratigan's playing. I've never had so much fun, and I think my Mozart on the piano might even be helped. Hope so! Thanks, Mr. Ratigan, for a great DVD.",1201996800,2,1069,4.323383084577115
2772208,4,B000NKTOQI,I am new to drumming and found this DVD just what I was looking for. Easy to see hand movements and rhythms for all occasions. I look forward to hours of learning these rhythms and playing with my friends.,1201996800,,205,4.282051282051282
2772209,2,B000NKTOQI,"I am a beginner and as such have several issues with this DVD.  All with the way it was put together.  There is only one view,frontal.  An over the shoulder viewing angle would be easier to follow.  Also, there is just one speed.  So getting the hand movements is a challenge.  Did use the DVD player controls to slow it down but can't hear the rhythm.  The one thing I can't get the DVD player to do is to go to a particular selection.  Its either watch each rhythm sequentially or hit fast forward and skip 5 at a time.  The GO TO on the player doesn't get a response from the DVD.  Was generous with a 2 star rating.",1201478400,2,619,4.083333333333333
2772210,5,B000NKTOQI,"The DVD ""101 Drum Circle Rhythms"" is by Shannon Ratigan, a drum circle facilitator in Florida.  It is an excellent and noteworthy DVD because it is a simple, easy to use video showing hand movements for more than 101 different rhythms that can be played in drum circles or by a drummer playing alone.  The demonstrations are played on a djembe, but the rhythms could be played on almost any type of drum.  Those of us who work with beginning drummers welcome a basic drumming learning tool such as this.  It differs from a lot of more complex drumming videos in that it focuses just on the rhythm and how to play it, and someone playing along can ""get it"" without being distracted by multiple players, voiceovers, and complex rapid rhythms.  Every drummer has a preferred learning style, and this DVD fills a need for simplicity.  Just watch and play along.",1179705600,6,857,4.642384105960265
8179138,5,B000NKTOQI,"Very helpful. Altho, the easiest drum beat sets to follow are last. I think the cd should start with the simple stuff and work up to the hard stuff for us newbies.
I must add..I think my set was bootleg. The drum sets, being backwards, skillwise, is crazy.",1433980800,,256,4.354166666666667
8179139,3,B000NKTOQI,"It is what it is, but I thought there would be at least an introduction.  Got to be serious about learning the drum rhythms.",1358121600,,124,4.166666666666667
8179140,5,B000NKTOQI,This CD is helpful to anyone who leads a drum circle or is called upon to offer a rhythm.  I record some of the rhythms to a small recorder and then use that as a reminder when I'm in the drum circle.,1353715200,,200,3.761904761904762
8179141,5,B000NKTOQI,"101 Drum Circle Rhythms is exactly what I was looking for. I am brand new to djembe drumming and needed clear visual directions for playing typical rhythms. Each rhythm is played sufficiently long to be able to ""catch on"" after awhile. I like the challenge of copying the rhythm! Plus, Shannon includes 120 rhythms instead of 101. And, since I don't have a drum circle near me, the additional drum circle CD gives me a chance to try out the rhythms while playing with others. I highly recommend the set to anyone who loves to drum!",1313366400,,531,4.541666666666667
8179142,5,B000NKTOQI,these cds are very helpful when you need some inspiration for a drum circle and I haven't listened to them all yet! Samples are arranged in small groups of progressive enhancement on a theme-good for skill building. Great personal service from the vendor and very fast receipt. Thanks,1307318400,,284,4.9375

Quotes not needed.

The DVD is exceptional, with wonderful rhythms across a range of ethnic styles.  I use my DVD or PC media player to A-B loop the section I want, then adjust the playback speed as I get up to speed with Shannon's moves.  What I particularly love about his playing, is that in some of the tracks are what are called ""muff"" or ""ghost"" drum taps.  These act as timekeepers to fill out the way your body flows into all the nuances of the rhythm.  Really adds depth and precision to your playing.  As well as just engaging more of your body and left right brain coordination.  It feels fantastic to play like this.

And about Shannon himself.  All I can say is that this guy embodies an authentic African spirit of generosity, courage, and community building.  (Truly in the spirit of Olatunji.)  I've asked him questions occasionally via email and he always responds quickly with helpful information.  I get that his drum circles are this way also, grounded, earthy, respectful, learn by doing not necessarily by talking or commanding.  This guy is a real ambassador of the drum.  Please support his work and all the outreach he does.",1295654400,,1565,5.275303643724697
8179144,5,B000NKTOQI,"This DVD is extremely helpful for anyone wanting to learn how to play a hand drum.

I had some short lessons in central africa and then returned home, with a drum, but without the money to pay for lessons.  Since I'm a graduate student and without much extra cash, I figured I could easily find videos on youtube and other online sources and not have to pay for anything.

I found I was largely mistaken--that most videos on youtube are not in fact for beginners--even the ones that say they are.  They were also nearly impossible to learn from because of the angles of the drummers, the speed of the drumming and the poor quality of the videos.

I always like to support local artists, so when I saw Shannon Ratigan's DVD I figured I would try it out--still trying to save the money for a teacher.

And I was *so* pleased to view it.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  It is helpfully broken up into sections to make electronic scrolling easy.  Ratigan gives the perfect amount of time for each beat, and begins them slowly so you can watch his hands and then emulate.

His DVD really is quite a good idea--compiling 125 beats for drummers at any level.  The DVD is a great resource for anyone.  My friends and I have been breaking it out at dinner parties just to get us going on our djembes.  Also, I joined a drum circle and this DVD helped immensely to get me up to speed to be able to drum with everyone.  I use the DVD for a bit before going to the drum circle, as a kind of warm up.

As you can see, I highly recommend it.",1286755200,,1536,4.212328767123288
8179145,5,B000NKTOQI,"I was introduced to drum circles a few years ago at the Naturist Festival in Florida. It was a very spiritual experience for me as a dancer to move to the beat of the drums and let the fire and vibrations transport me to the heavens. I came back home with a great desire to learn to drum as well as dance. Some time later I remodeled a basement for a man from Ghana. At the end of the project he went to visit his family in Ghana and brought back a djembe for me! I am classically trained in music and have never been successful at just picking up an instrument and learning to play it. I suppose that given enough time I would have eventually gotten the hang of it, but when I heard about 101 Drum Circle Rhythms I jumped at the opportunity to buy it. I've had small bits and pieces of instruction from friends but there was never enough opportunities. Now all I had to do was slip in the disk and pick up my drum! The simplicity of mimicking the beats until I get it right took me over that edge that I just wasn't able to cross. I still have many more rhythms to master but I'm finally making real music with my beautiful drum! Thank you for providing just what I needed.",1262736000,,1174,4.108695652173913
8179146,5,B000NKTOQI,"I own the DVD, ""101 Drum Circle Rhythms"" and love it. It has a wealth of drum rhythms to add to any drum circle. I learn best by watching, and the techniques used on the DVD are very helpful. Each rhythm is shown for long enough amount to allow you to pick up the rhythm and play along. I am very pleased with the versatility of the drum rhythms. This DVD is an asset for anyone who plays hand drums, especially in a drum circle, and has something for everyone - from the basic to advanced drummer. This DVD has been a great tool for me and it is well worth the investment.",1245715200,,573,4.079646017699115
8179147,2,B000NKTOQI,"This DVD has a large collection of nice rhythms with clear views of hand pattern and should be nice to drum along with after one learns the rhythm.  Unfortunately it is not easy for beginners to pick up the rhythms, which is a shame.  If he would start each rhythm in slow motion (say, half speed) for a few rounds before going into normal speed, that would make life so much easier for learning. It would also help to ""sing"" the rhythms in the beginning (e.g. ga-da-gung-dung or base-slap-tone type of thing).  These are all simple techniques used in most drum videos.  I hope he would adopt them in a future release.  It would also be nice to have these rhythms written down in a simple notation for quick reference.",1238976000,2,718,4.492307692307692
