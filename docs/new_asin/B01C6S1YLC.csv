7672695,5,B01C6S1YLC,"Damn, so honestly I do not know where to start. I loved the series when it first came out. Very interesting looking drawings with awesome development of scenery to boot. After watching season one, I must say I wasn't engulfed in it as much as I wanted to but I would be lying to say I rated it 10/10. As for the second series, a little bit better with more action but still lacking. And watching the third which technically is the prequel, it didn't engage me as much considering less talk about the demons and more talk about the new guy. However, when the movie came out, things were totally different.

Now before I get into that, know the series is a Otome game. So basically it's what you call a girl's game in English. But if you are watching the movie, the storyline is a lot more engaging and it doesn't feel like an Otome at all. The characters are created in different scenarios with the same plot, only better. The characters grow more on you and they even have darker scenes with you understanding the villain's point of view. Sadly I do not think it would have gotten the bad reviews it did if the first and second season was like this movie. Don't want to give too much away, but the voice acting has changed so be prepared for that. I personally watched it in Japanese first, but the English cast for the movie is good.

If you have never seen Hakuouki, watched this version first...better than the original ten fold. Kind of remind me how they made Hellsing and then Hellsing Ultimate. In this case, the classics aren't always better.",1467244800,4,1550,4.435087719298245

8752359,5,B01C6S1YLC,Loved this movie. Can't wait to get the series. This movie is #1 and basically is a summary of the season. Has some amazing character development and makes you love each one of the introduced characters. This is definitely a good starter anime movie. I'd say it's not good for kids under 12. Because there is a lot of bloody scenes,1485043200,,331,4.442622950819672

8752364,4,B01C6S1YLC,"Gorgeous theatrical production of the first season. Action sequences are beautifully choreographed. I loved the characterizations they ran with. The demonic transformations were a spectacular addition. This is a fun action movie, but one has to take into consideration that due to the length of the film they could only include so much storyline and historical events. Fights are combined from different historical poits due to time constraints and the overall film fills rushed. I've played the PSP and PS3 games and watched all of the available anime. As such, my brain filled in a lot of the skipped over plot points and though it was a goregous adaptation there was a portion of me that was left wanting afterward. If you're a fan of the series I believe this adaptation is a must see none the less. If you're looking for meat and have never seen Hakuoki before then you should definitely watch the anime series as it more closely follows Hijikata's route, which the movie also follows, from the game.",1469664000,2,1005,4.848837209302325
