8331821,3,B001P0DR54,"The English subtitle work for this product is good up until around episode 7.  From there on, the English subtitles take on that poor quality that many buyers of Japanese drama DVDs have come to recognize: character names become Chinese, translations become fragments with many spelling and grammar mistakes, and some translations just make no sense at all.  I understand some Japanese, so I could pretty much figure out what was going on.  If you depend on English subtitles, I would suggest that you look around before considering this product.

As for the story itself, it's very enjoyable.  Matsumoto Jun fans should definitely watch!  You'll also like Sato Ryuuta and Karina :).",1264982400,,683,5.053571428571429
8331822,5,B001P0DR54,"Great Japanese comedy/drama series. The star, Matsumoto Jun, is a common element in other Japanese television series. Not geared toward any specific age group - as long as you can read, you can watch and enjoy! Very appropriate timing for this series, what with all the cooking shows such as ""Hell's Kitchen"", ""Last chef Standing"", etc... that are on nowadays.",1235433600,,360,5.016666666666667
