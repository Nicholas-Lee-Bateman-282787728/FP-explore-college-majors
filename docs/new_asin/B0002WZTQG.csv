2130288,1,B0002WZTQG,"i m a huge fan of richard pryor, and i m very disapointed by this dvd, i was waiting for unreleased stand up, and all i had was a ""not too bad documentary"" hbo level, with extract of already realeased show...live on the sunset, new orleans stand up and the late 70's one with the monkey's joke... i m very very very very dispointed, and pissed off, not for the money but for the joy i made myself about wieving something new about pryor, no just exploitation of the goldmine...hope more dvd will be released with old treasure that i don t know about...plus on the dvd it is nowhere written that its a documentary...",1101340800,19,615,4.356521739130435

2130339,5,B0002WZTQG,"Who doesn't love Richard Pryor,
He is one of the best when it comes to original comedy
The seller took good care of these item. no scratches or marks on case or dvd",1387152000,,164,4.0
2130340,2,B0002WZTQG,"If you want Richard Pryor's stand up, just buy the stand up dvd's.  This is bunch of comedians talking about Richard Pryor's other stand up (which due to this dvd i ended up buying) and Pryor's stand up career.

I didn't really read the descriptions so I'm not sure what it says, but this isn't his stand up.",1361059200,,308,4.293103448275862
2130341,5,B0002WZTQG,"Item is excellent, I am a big fan of Richard Pryor and I feel like I have purchased a little slice of history. Have watched it numerous times and it plays perfectly. Thanks so much",1358726400,,180,4.171428571428572
2130342,1,B0002WZTQG,I really did not like this very much. In my opinion it was more of a chance for those that had bad things to say about Richard Pryor to voice their opinion. Not everyone put him down but the two that did ruined the whole movie for me.,1350086400,,234,3.8958333333333335
2130343,1,B0002WZTQG,"I ordered 2 DVD's, Live In Concert and this one.
L.I.C. is great, but this one's not. I thought this was going to be an actual concert/show
like L.I.C., but its just a bunch of celebrity commentaries. Wish I didn't order this one.",1332115200,,230,4.372093023255814
2130344,1,B0002WZTQG,"Disappointed I thought this a DVD of his Comedy, but instead it is full of interviews.  Not what I expected.",1294704000,,108,4.4
2130345,5,B0002WZTQG,"This tribute DVD was filmed before Richard's death.  It shows footage of some of his greatest comedy routines and movies with Gene Wilder.  It's a sweet, funny, heartwarming tribute to a great man.  The celebrities in this DVD give proper respect to one of the true Kings of Comedy.  I'm glad I bought this DVD and wish I had bought it before he died.  It's worth the price to see Richard perform one more time.",1255824000,5,411,4.426666666666667
2130346,5,B0002WZTQG,"We received this video in the mail it was in great condition, and plus it's a classic if you haven't seen it and like stand up like the kings of comedy or eddie murphy this is where it all orginated from",1245024000,,203,3.975609756097561
2130347,2,B0002WZTQG,"It is not the show I was looking for. My mistake, however, it is NOT very clear. Ergo, a big deception once I played the DVD at home expecting the show..... Still have not found a DVD with the show itself. Anybody ??",1206662400,,216,4.046511627906977
2130348,3,B0002WZTQG,"This is a tribute to Richard Pryor, NOT a comedy routine. I wouldn't have purchased it if I'd known that. It wasn't horrible, but I was disappointed nevertheless. I want some of Richard Pryor's actual taped routines on DVD. Guess I didn't pay enough attention when I bought this.

2130379,4,B0002WZTQG,not bad.  A great tribute to one of the best comedians of our time.,1178409600,,67,3.7857142857142856
2130380,1,B0002WZTQG,"Waste of money! If this DVD would have cost one dollar it would have been too much money. I wish I would have read the reviews before buying it, I would have saved myself from getting the worst Richard Pryor DVD ever made! I don't care to type anymore about it because once I really get started I won't shut up and this DVD is not worth my time. I didn't want to even give it one star but in order to do this review it showed I had to give at least one star. I think if it doesn't deserve a star it shouldn't get one!",1172880000,3,517,3.8411214953271027
2130381,1,B0002WZTQG,"Perhaps the worst tribute DVD I have ever seen. Jump cut editing will give you ADD (we're talking literally two-second sound bytes!), the grabs are pointless with very few comedians talking about Pryor getting more than one sentence in before they jump to the next trendy talking head. None of them say anything funny or enlightening either, which is surprising for something that is supposed to be a comedy/tribute DVD.  A handful of Pryor clips from an existing concert (just one) and two short clips from the Richard Pryor show. The sycophantic background laughter at EVERYTHING their interviewees say (and I mean EVERYTHING, it's pathetic) is really grating.  And there's too many terrible comics on here - Margaret Cho, Cedric the Entertainer, George Wallace, Jamie Foxx and a bunch of sub-Martin Lawrence jarheads.  Spend your money on one of his live concert DVDs.  This is rubbish made by people who think they have a sense of humour.  It's a beer coaster.",1149120000,20,964,4.962732919254658
2130382,4,B0002WZTQG,Very nice tribute. need to do a beeter job of packaging and handling your dvd movies this is the case for all the dvds i've bought from you guys so far.,1142467200,,152,3.935483870967742
2130383,2,B0002WZTQG,"I was expecting a glimpse of some of richard's funniest acts. the DVD does not do that. It merely interviews people who knew him and give you a glimpse about his career with some takes from some of his stand up shows.

I was under the imppression that I am purchasing a DVD that shows some of his funny shows, stand ups and maybe a DVD of something new about richard. (A never before seen show or something like that)

Never the less, He never fails to be the funniest comedian that ever lived.",1141344000,3,494,4.24468085106383
2130384,2,B0002WZTQG,This is about other people talking about Richard Pryor with a fe clips of Pryor.,1140998400,2,80,4.4
2130385,2,B0002WZTQG,"Let's be honest here, this IS a rip-off. After all the cut and paste done by the editors, one would expect a proper show to begin, preferably with some unseen material, then it ends briefly in the middle of a huh! moment. The marketing and packaging was good cos those who bought it, like me, thought it was another obscure, raw and previously unrealesed material by Mr RP the genius. It does this great man a HUGE disservice, may he rest in peace. For someone who got a standing ovation as he entered heaven, this dvd does not do him good.",1136332800,5,540,4.356435643564357
2130386,2,B0002WZTQG,"As you have gethered by now, this is not a complete Richard Pryor stand-up show.  I Ain't Dead Yet, originally aired on Comedy Central, is a tribute/biography/documentary of the legendary comedian, showcasing clips of his various acts shuffled in with interviews and opinions from Steve Harvey, Jamie Foxx, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, Dave Chappelle, Denis Leary, Whoppi Goldberg, and Robin Williams among others.  The program itself, which is less than 45 minutes long and is here in all in uncensored glory, is worth a look for fans of Pryor who didn't see it when it originally aired, but the DVD features are scant, and considering the price of the DVD, this is a rip-off.  All in all, worth a look for fans of Pryor, but for all others, this is worth avoiding.",1126483200,13,762,4.757575757575758
2130387,1,B0002WZTQG,"My husband and I just finished watching this and to say we were disappointed would be an understatement.  We were under the impression that we would be watching Richard Pryor doing his amazing standup and what we got were small clips of him interspersed with comedians putting their two bits in, copying  him, and all this other garbage.  I don't even understand how this was supposed to be entertaining in any way - it was quite simply totally annoying and pointless.  We fast forwarded through most of it that didn't involve Richard.  Don't buy this.",1124582400,12,552,4.768421052631579
2130388,3,B0002WZTQG,"Ok, so Richard Pryor is the greatest stand-up comic in the whole freaking world and he still is because nobody's been able to surpass his comic genius. Anybody who doesn't think R.P is the greatest should go f**k themselves. So, why did I give this dvd a 3 star rating? Because it is just a bio with some commentary and some clips of his material. Now, don't get me wrong, I have nothing against a biography, but if you ask me, I think they they could make a lot more money if they make this: A three dvd set. Two of those dvd's hold all of R.P's material, and the other dvd holds the biography and commentary of other stand up comics. I think that would be the ultimate dvd set ever! Anybody who is with me on that idea, please answer yes when it says, ""was this review helpful to you?"".
