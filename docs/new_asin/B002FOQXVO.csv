3923920,5,B002FOQXVO,"Tremble in fear Pekoponians! For Sgt Keroro is here to conquer your planet! As soon as he finishes his chores and completes this one last Gundam model....
Keroro is the inept Sargent of a platoon of 5 Keronians sent as the advance guard to the invasion of the Earth. But due to his bumbling, the invasion is called off and he and his platoon are abandoned on Earth. Keroro gets adopted into the Hinata family where Aki Hinata hopes to use him as inspiration for manga. But Keroro has not given up hope of a successful invasion! He has big plans! Fortunately for us Earthlings, his plans are always terrible.

I read the first volume of manga for this series and was only mildly interested in it. But when I read a review of the anime on ANN that praised the English dub to the stars, I figured I'd give it a shot. The reviewer was so right.
The Japanese dub relied heavily on puns, word plays, and pop culture references that didn't make much sense in English. So Funimation opted to come up with English versions of the jokes. They did an excellent job of it. In addition, the voice actors were top notch and they deliver their lines with great enthusiasm and comedy. I tried watching a couple episodes in Japanese to compare the two and I was surprised to find that I found the Japanese dub to be boring. This was a strange feeling for me, since I watch most of my anime in Japanese. But with Sgt. Frog, the jokes either flew right over my head or when I did catch them, I didn't find them very funny.
But in English this is one of the funniest anime I have ever seen. And I've seen lots of anime.

This set contains 26 episodes of froggy goodness with the option of Japanese or English audio. Amazon claims it is only 2 discs, but it is actually 4 discs (I own it, and I counted).

3923923,5,B002FOQXVO,"Unique, fun and gut-bursting humor!  ""Sgt. Frog"" is probably one of the most odd and crazy anime series you'll ever see.  Hilarious in Japanese but the writing for the English dub definitely takes things up a notch!

Since 1999, the manga series ""Keroro Gunso"" (aka ""Sgt. Frog"")  by Mine Yoshizaki (""Arcade Gamer Fubuki"", ""Chibi Kero"" and ""Seven of Seven"") has been entertaining readers.  Since 2004, the anime series has been entertaining viewers and both continue to be popular long-running series in Japan.  Now the award winning series gets its first US anime DVD release with the first 13 episodes now arriving in the US.

The anime series is directed by Yusuke Yamamoto (""Welcome to the NHK, ""Sakura Taisen"", ""Mobile Suit Victor Gundam"" and Arjuna"") and features character designs by Fumitoshi Oisaki (""Romeo x Juliet"", ""Ontama"" and ""Kaleido Star"").  The series is known for its use of parodies of pop culture and in the Japanese case, you will see a plenty of pop culture references to anime and video games.  While, the English dub features a slightly different script than the Japanese and utilizes American pop culture (which I will describe more in the video and audio segment of this review).

The series revolves around an alien race of frogs who have come to conquer the planet Earth.  But somehow along the way, things didn't go as expected and the leader of the platoon, Sergeant Frog finds himself living with the Hinata family.  Always up to mischief and trying to find a way to conquer Earth, he is befriended by the weak and paranormal/supernatural obsessed boy Fuyuki, beaten to a pulp by his strong sister Natsumi and given a place to live by their mother (and manga editor) Aki who uses him as a source of ideas for her new manga.

With his obsession for Mobile Suit Gundam models, television and snacks, Sgt. Frog gets too used to human life, that is until his fellow platoon finds out that he has been neglecting his duties.

""Sgt. Frog - Season One, Part 1' features a total of 13 episodes on two DVD's.  Each episode consists of two mini-episodes, most often at times are related to each other. but sometimes you get two different stories per episode.  Here is a spoiler-less summary:

DISC 1:

  * EPISODE 1-  Meet the Sergeant! - The introduction of Keroro and how he came to live with the Hinata family.
  * EPISODE 2- Bag of Secrets! - We are introduced to Momoka Nishizawa who is in love with Fuyuki Hinata.  We are also introduced to the alien frog, Tamama.
  * EPISODE 3 - Amphibian On the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown - With Tamama getting all the things he wants, Keroro is bored by living at the Hinata home.  Meanwhile, a mysterious thing has been spying on the Hinata's.
  * EPISODE 4 - Blood Violence Death Kill! - We are introduced to Corporal Giroro and Giroro comes up with an idea to make Keroro more of a warrior.
  * EPISODE 5 - The Day Gundam Cried! - Keroro wants a Gundam at a toy store and needs Fuyuki's help.
  * EPISODE 6 - Ghost Kiss-Perer! - Momoka invites Fuyuki to a private island and next thing you know the Hinata family and frogs are all coming.  Will Fuyuki and her butler Paul be able to make Fuyuki like him?
  * EPISODE 7 - Apocalypse Later! - The Lord of Terror makes her appearance.  Meanwhile, we learn that Tamama is jealous of her.

DISC 2:

  * EPISODE 8 - Base: The Final Frontier! - Keroro builds a secret base inside the fridge.
  * EPISODE 9 - Desperately Seeking Brains! - Mutsumi Saburo introduces a member of the Armpit Platoon... Kururu. Meanwhile, Kururu creates an age manipulation gun that can make anything many years younger and Aki Hinata volunteers.
  * EPISODE 10 - Sgt. Frog versus the Cavitians of Cavity 9! - Keroro is suffering from a cavity (alien invaders have taken control of Keroro's cavity) and Kururu comes up with an idea to take them on.
  * EPISODE 11 - Fake It `Til You Make It! - Celebrities from a galactic TV show want to do a show on Earth at the Hinata home.
  * EPISODE 12 - Pop Startled! - A pop star (a third runner-up of ""Galactic Idol"") visits the Hinata home.  And Giroro loses his weapon's sash.
  * EPISODE 13 - Viper? I Hardly Knew Her! - The introduction of Dororo and Koyuki.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Sgt. Frog"" is presented in 4:3.  For the most part, the entertaining part of ""Sgt. Frog"" are its characters but also the little Japanese pop culture references, especially Keroro's love for ""Gundam"" (which the model kits are featured in the anime series).  The colors are vibrant and for a television show, the animation works great for this series.  Keroro and his members of the Armpit Platoon are frogs with a cool and cute character design, that it's no surprise that this series has an extensive merchandise collection in Japan.

As for audio, the English dub is featured in Dolby Surround Sound and the Japanese is featured in stereo.  For the most part, I have watched both in English and Japanese and the voice acting on both are great.  As for audio quality, I preferred to watch the series with my receiver setting at stereo on all channels but for the most part, the English dialogue is front and center channel driven if watched via 5.1 Dolby Surround.

Now when it comes to audio and watching it on both languages, there is a difference between the English and Japanese version.  For the most part, the English version has a rewritten script that utilizes the same storyline as the Japanese version but features American pop culture references and more dialogue.  So, for example, when the Japanese dialogue is quiet, in the English dialogue, you may hear the narrator speaking.

Although I tend to prefer watching anime in Japanese, I have to admit that I found the English dub quite wild and crazy.  For example, during one scene in which Hinata siblings and the aliens meet a fellow Galactic pop star, in the Japanese dialogue there is discussion of how popular she is.  While in the English dub, they use ""American Idol"" references to showcase her popularity.

Granted, some people may not be familiar with the American pop culture references (especially since certain situations are taken from that time period, for example the Miley Cyrus and Asians comment) and may easily fly over the heads of those who are not familiar with American pop culture but for the most part, the rewritten screenplay by Jamie Marchi, Jared Hedges and Joel Bergen will easily make people laugh.  For those familiar with what Joel Bergen did with ""Crayon Shin Chan"" will know what kind of humor to expect from the series albeit a more PG rating.

Subtitles are featured in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Crazy, enjoyable and just all out fun!  I have to admit that I was completely unfamiliar with the story of ""Sgt. Frog"" before watching this DVD.  I knew about the character Keroro and the platoon members through the various merchandise seen at many Japanese and Chinese shops but I really didn't know anything about the series.

And what can I say, after watching ""Sgt. Frog - Season One, Part 1',  I've become a fan!  I really don't think anyone can be disappointed with this DVD set as its absolutely fresh, wild and crazy.  As people are wanting to find a series that is fun and unique, I think that anime fans that are into comedy-based series can find something to like about ""Sgt. Frog"".

Having watched the episodes in Japanese and English, the Japanese version was hilarious but being an American and familiar with the pop culture references in the dialogue and the Japanese pop culture references on the show, I had a great time watching it with the English dub.  You can tell there was great care on the American side into utilizing the time of the series to create additional dialogue and of course, coming up with something new to make the characters much crazier for an American audience.

It's important to note that FUNimation Entertainment went with the original names for the dub, so for those who saw the test episode on YouTube and were not satisfied with the name changes, FUNimation Entertainment did fix that up with only Giroro's cat keeping the name ""Mr. Furbottom"" and the voice talent changed for the final cut.

As for the parents who are wondering if the show is safe for children, although the series is rated TV PG, there is no naughty talk or any profanity.

There is only one scene in episode 9 in which a young Aki Hinata (who looks like Fuyuki) is hugged by Momoka Nishizawa and in the process of that hug, Nishizawa who wraps her arm around Aki and her hands on the side of her chest, she wonders why Fuyuki has breasts.  And of course, there is a lot of mayhem and some fight scenes but seriously, the series is quite tame and is even aired to children in Japan (as evident by its targeted merchandise towards children in Japan) and various parts of the world.  And I also shared the series with my six-year-old son who absolutely loved the series.

Overall, this is an anime series that is worth purchasing!  For those who enjoyed ""Crayon Shin Chan"" (US dialogue version) may enjoy this much tamer but hilarious anime series.  But really, this series really can't be compared to anything.  It's that fresh, wild and crazy.  One can definitely expect ""Sgt. Frog"" to be a series that has cool and fun characters and outrageously written episodes, definitely make this anime series worth the purchase!

Highly recommended!",1252454400,15,9832,4.67463556851312
3923924,4,B002FOQXVO,"Sgt. Frog is one of those rare anime properties that could only be made possible by global cooperation.  The look, the feel, the animation-style (heck the main character perhaps most of all) are all of Asian influence but much of this particular set's charm stems from its American dub work.  In all honesty, it would seem very easy to screw things up the way Funimation went about combining the artistic influence of two very-different nations but after having just completed this collection, I can state with confidence that they defied the odds with this one!  But before we get ahead of ourselves here, let's take a look at the cold hard facts, shall we?

Funimation has recently acquired the rights to the show and has wasted little time in getting the first part of the first season (Episodes 1-13) release out to the North American public for the first time ever. Coming in at a total runtime of 325 minutes, Sgt. Frog Season One Part 1 spans 2 discs and comes packaged as a pair of thin packs within a cardboard slipcase.

The show wears an appropriate if slightly conservative TV PG rating, which is presumably based more on adult-themed references and cartoony violence over nudity, foul language or gore.

Language options are typical sub & dub meaning the option of original Japanese dialog track (stereo) or an English dub (5.1 Dolby Surround) and English subtitles available under either language choice.

Extras include Pekopon Invasion Recon Data, textless songs and a host of Funimation trailers.

The story, which actually works far better than I can possibly summarize here, goes something like this: Keroro is an adorable member of a militant race of Space Frogs (a sergeant in fact) who arrived to earth as part of an early attack squadron intending to conquer the planet.  Once the invaders discover that humans aren't quite the pushovers they initially perceived, the mission is aborted and the few frog troopers in the first wave of attack are abandoned.

Of course that first wave includes the title character, Sgt. Keroro and we follow along on the adventures of he and his adoptive earth family which includes a 9-year-old boy nerd, a 13-year old tom boy girl, and their mother- a crotch-rocket riding comic book artist.  Best of all they give our hero a room that was a former-bomb shelter beneath the stairway of their house that just so happens to be haunted by the ghost of a tortured young girl.

Keroro isn't quite ready to abandon all hopes of planetary conquest despite the fact that he discovers that he is actually growing quite fond of the human race and worse still, has developed an addiction to anime (Robotech), toys (Gundam models) and of all things, karaoke.

As the show progresses, he discovers that some of his fellow frog troops are actually right in his own neighborhood and have been adopted by human families as well.  Their collective mission remains in the hopes that their entire army will one day return to fulfill the goal of conquering earth but in the mean time there is plenty of adventure to be had on the ""blue planet"".

If this sounds a little goofy to you so far, don't worry it is.  Although the overall theme harkens back to the type of animorphic-action that was big here in the U.S. in the late 1980s (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, anyone), the truth is this show works on an entirely different plane.  Namely it's funny.  No not just witty banter between its lead characters but pop-culture funny with references that come fast and constant.  Little things like ""Boy this is just like the beginning and ending scenes in all of the Jurassic Parks"" or ""You're more picky than (David) Fincher!"" or perhaps even ""This will allow me to become invisible like the conceal option on Facebook"" should provide an indication of the tone here.  While some may argue the original Japanese dialog is funny enough to stand on its own merit, I must counter that Funimation went the extra mile in the English dub to keep the humor on point!

It's common knowledge that Funimation spent a lot of time screening early versions of the dub to North American test audiences (including making clips available for review on Youtube) before being satisfied with the dub.  The good news is that the attention to detail pays dividends.  The bright over-the-top cutes-ness of the visuals will keep the younger set interested while the dialog (sociological references especially) will ensure that the adults will be snickering.

This is one of very few times I will go as far as to say that the English dub is superior to the original Japanese dialog track.  Yes, it really works that well.

In all I would be exaggerating if I were to say that this is an animated show for everyone but it will certainly appeal to a wide audience thanks to a near-endless succession of little gags and bits that work on many levels.  The grand story arc, while in no danger for being mistaken for a modern day masterpiece, is just quaint enough to keep the situations advancing from episode to episode.  It's the humor and zing of the characters within (and that includes the narrator and subtitles) that steal the show.  Kudos to Funimation for recognizing the potential of the source material and for custom-tailoring it to appeal to its target audience.",1252454400,8,5279,4.783039647577093

3923947,5,B002FOQXVO,"My usual method with watching anime is to watch the English dub (if there is one) to familiarize myself with the show, then watch the Japanese version for nuance. I have found this a good way to enrich my enjoyment of a show.
But that didn't work with Sgt. Frog.  I watched the English version and liked it okay...and then I went to the Japanese, and it was a totally different anime...and a much better one.  The narrator, although often befuddled, is much more polite (his attempts to ""teach the kiddies"" are hilarious), the jokes don't aim immediately for the cheap laugh, and the on-screen Japanese captions are translated correctly!  Also, there are times when the English version seems determined to needlessly distort aspects of an episode, like in ""Wet Hot Beaches"" (the English titles are irritating, too!), when they say that the beach is polluted.  (In Japanese, it is made clear that the beach is ""out in the sticks"" and that's why so few people go there.)  And, honestly...what was so wrong with the name ""Keroro Platoon""?  The ""unfortunate acronym"" used in English is just plain cheap.  It was also quite reassuring to discover that Giroro's ""crush"" on Natsumi is actually more innocent and gallant than the ""creepy stalker"" vibe implied by the English version.
On the positive side, both versions of the show rely heavily on ""breaking the fourth wall,"" or having the characters and the narrator interact with us in a way that deliberately blurs the line between fantasy and reality, so if you like that, then you can't miss.
But for the rest...the Japanese version is better.  Really.  You just need to have a little patience.",1403049600,,1641,4.832142857142857

3923963,5,B002FOQXVO,"Sgt. Frog (or Keroro Gunsou) is some of the best animated comedy out there in general, period, especially in English. It hits the same ""nerve"" shows like Adventure Time and Regular Show do, as all the people I've introduced it to (who, by the way, ALL love it-- yes, it's THAT endearing and infectious, even to those not all that into anime)/are already fans of this are also fans of at least one of those two. The humor is varied, rapid-fire (as in machine gun rapid; there are jokes you will probably miss on first viewing but catch in a rewatch), has references galore, whether visually or through dialogue, to anime from the mainstream to the obscure and from old to new (though refs to western pop culture and famous people are added in the FANTASTIC dub, really widening it's appeal) and best of all, it's appropriate for all ages, which means you can also sit the kids down in front of the TV and they'll also have a ball with it. It's honestly crazy this hasn't already hit the airwaves in the states, to be viewed by a mass audience, because this has the makings of a massive success!

Anyhow, if you like this set of the first 26 episodes, and odds are you will, it'll be a no brainer for you to get the other 2 seasons currently out at the moment, because it only gets better and better.

3/28/14 EDIT: Funimation has put their release of this awesome show on hiatus since about a year ago, but don't fear! Potential buyers, the only way we'll get more of this show-- episode 79-103 and onward-- sooner rather than later is by voting with your wallets (and of course, spreading the love/awareness is a great thing to do, too!)

4/1/14 EDIT: One thing nobody has mentioned, not even the description, is that according to the back of the box, all DVD sets of this show are Regions 1, 2, and 4, meaning this is importable to those in the UK/Ireland, Australia/NZ, South Africa, and all other countries those areas cover.",1378598400,2,1928,4.487179487179487

3923971,5,B002FOQXVO,"A fun-filled adventure as misguided and easily-distracted space-amphibians try to take over the world, but end up doing housework and building Gundam models.  Loads of fun in both english and nihon go!",1356307200,,201,5.28125

3923983,5,B002FOQXVO,"Sgt. Frog is amazing!  I fell in love with this show the moment I saw episode 1 on FUNimation's website.  I bought the DVD set, and I really enjoy it.  Keroro is hilarious and, someone whom I'd like to call, ""stupidly funny"".  He wants to conquer us, but is too lazy and stupid to do so, and whenever he does, he always fails...always.  The other cast of characters do a good job revolving around him and this great box of episodes.  Bottom line: BUY IT!  You'll love it!",1348185600,,471,4.284090909090909
3923984,5,B002FOQXVO,i love this show its funny and the voice cast is great the humor is great ive watched it so much i love best anime ever,1344902400,,119,3.6153846153846154
3923985,5,B002FOQXVO,I loved this collection.  I found it very funny and fast paced.  My 11 year old and I watched the whole season together and enjoyed it so much that I ordered the next set.  Its nice to have a good anime that I can watch with my child and not have to worry about surprises.  Its humor is good for tweens since it is not babyish either.  I would watch this even if I didn't have kids because it is so funny but I like it even more since I can enjoy it with my daughter. We will watch it again so it is worth owning.,1334880000,,513,3.80188679245283
3923986,5,B002FOQXVO,"This is an amazing series! No questions asked, if you like being trolled with evangelion references then great! Watch it! If you like Gundam and Bandai then Great Watch It. These cute and very energetic (Right...) alien frogs from the A.R.M.P.I.T platoon are aggressively seeking to take over Pekopon (Earth)...... and they fail every time.",1325116800,4,340,5.2
3923987,5,B002FOQXVO,"How could a show about a frog and his platoon trying to take over Earth and failing horribly not make for an amazing show? Both the original Japanese audio and the Funimation dub are great in their own rights and are worth a watch. The show is great for people of all ages, jokes and references are great for kids as well as adults. This version of the box set is Funimation's complete first season and a great buy.

I would really recommend that every anime fan picks this series up and have it in their collection. It is a great must have for a show that is always going to make you smile.",1320969600,3,591,4.184210526315789
3923988,5,B002FOQXVO,"I love this show, period.  The frogs are endearing, the show is hilarious, the english voice cast does a wonderful job, and anybody who watches this show ends up loving it almost as much as I do.  Yet somehow, due to slow DVD sales, Funimation may be dropping this series soon (along with D.Grayman)!  That stinks!

I know what you're thinking: ""Anime is so expensive, I can't afford it!""  I can tell you that it's a steal at $30, it really is, especially considering that a place like Best Buy or some mall outlet would easily charge you something like $55-$60 for it.

So, here's what I'd like you to do:  buy this box set, or if you're feeling really generous, buy the two half-seasons.  You'll be helping to make sure that Funimation can continue licensing the series for all of us to enjoy!  And I PROMISE that you'll be happy with your purchase too.

If you yourself are not interested in a comedy gem like this, then Christmas is coming along and you have to know *someone*who would enjoy some froggy goodness.  And hey, somebody has a birthday soon, right?  Get one for them too!  Get them the other two seasons as well if you wanna be an extra good friend ;)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sgt-Frog-Season-Two/dp/B004GZZH9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sgt.

3923989,5,B002FOQXVO,"This started out as 15 min episodes, that shared a time slot with another show!  The dubs make this hilarious by current American standards, and even improves on the original.  This is 5 star quality anime.  Great dubbing, great new script, funny, and good original source material!",1315526400,,282,4.957446808510638
3923990,5,B002FOQXVO,"I found this show to be the funniest thing that I've ever watched on my television screen (even including The Simpsons).  The series seems to be filled with jokes and pop culture references that don't suck.  If you're not a fan of English voiceovers (often referred to as English dubs) then you will be in luck because these four DVDs come with the original Japanese audio as well.

Overall if you want a comedy that isn't as offensive as Hetalia but will still make you laugh and that you can show to audiences of various ages then this would be your anime.  If you're not looking for an anime you need to at least give this one a try.",1314662400,,636,4.319327731092437
3923991,5,B002FOQXVO,"Well written. Actual laugh out loud funny. An Anime that constantly breaks the fourth wall with pop culture references and quirky characters and absurd plotlines...But not just ""kick you in the crotch"" humor.

It is the Japanese equivalent of Invader Zim.

Funny and well worth it.",1308873600,3,281,5.086956521739131

8369510,5,B002FOQXVO,"A friend of mine recently recommended to me the Sergeant Frog series, and I'm happy I decided to check it out! Keroro, a sergeant from the planet Keron, is left behind on Earth when a planned invasion is called off. After being ""captured"" by a Pekoponian (human) family, he soon adjusts to a life more marked by household chores than battle. Sgt. Frog is a fun, lighthearted series with many laugh-out-loud moments full of puns, slapstick humor, and pop-culture references. I would recommend this series to any anime fan. I haven't yet made it all the way through this Season 1 collection, but when I do I definitely want to pick up Season 2.",1465257600,,642,4.640350877192983
