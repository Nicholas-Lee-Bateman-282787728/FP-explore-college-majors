There are a lot of word plays, the camera finds many attractive angles, scenes are well-arranged with different activities in foreground and background, and there is one hilarious dance number. The background music sounds funny, often commenting the dialogues.

The actors perform heavy duty facial gymnastics and gesture away. The whole thing rolls off with good speed and is over in less than two hours, mercifully short by Indian movie standards. Khichdi also shows by far the most respectless funeral scene I ever saw in a Hindi film, they even sing the lascivious Beedi Jalaile from Omkara within the ceremony. And not at all to be taken for granted in an crass comedy made in Mumbai or south thereof, Khichdi has no vulgarity or violence whatsoever.

Khichdi mischiveously parodies many other Bollywood movies and actors; actually this TV sitcom turned movie is best viewed if you have already seen a few dozen other Hindi films. While Khichdi seems to plunder movie scenes from across Bollywoodlandia, it often resembles something like a poor man's Om Shanti Om - that grand scale 2007 movie also parodied Bollywood films and habits by the dozens; interestingly, Om Shanti Om's director Farah Khan has a short cameo within Khichdi, playing a director there. Obviously, the 1995 hit film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge also inspired several scenes in Khichdi; and Khichdi's main actor (and producer) J.D. Majethia copies some Shah Rukh Khan's histrionics, the hero of both Om Shanti Om and DDLJ.

I laughed a lot, more than in most other Hindi comedies, and i felt well entertained throughout - unlike Om Shanti Om or DDLJ, Khichdi doesn't contain endless dull stretches. I even laughed a lot on my second Khichdi viewing, even though by then I felt that some scenes were perhaps a tad drawn out and that certainly some receipies for jokes had been used too often. It remained a riot, but you have to follow actress Kirta Kulhari's advice given in the Making-of: Leave your brain at the door and have fun.",1392854400,,2145,4.93628808864266
