6044438,5,B00G1X52FS,"This is my favorite of Titus' shows.  Dealing with issues arising in the wake of 9/11 as it applies to the context of family, Titus uses his trademark wicked wit and dark edge to extract laughter (sometimes against your will) at the craziness of the world around us.  And, he does it all with a heart that he wears on his sleeve and an energy that must be seen to be believed.

Do yourself a favor and pick this one up.  You'll thank yourself later.  Or if not, then you can have a reason to apologize . . .",1393372800,,507,4.08080808080808
6044439,4,B00G1X52FS,"For a long time (since 2006), us Titus fans had to be content with an edited (and censored) version of this show, taped off of Comedy Central. Not anymore. Titus got the show back from CC and reedited the show for a full-length dvd a couple years back. He still sells it via his website, but he has now joined the Amazon world! As soon as I had the cash, I ponied up here since I wasn't able to see him in concert (I was in the middle of moving across the country and had to save $$).

If you have the CD version of this show (completely different recording), buy this too. Listening to Titus isn't the same as watching him. The mannerisms, the hand flailing, the faces, and yes... the inner retard (first seen here, and fully fleshed out in later shows).

Buy this and everything else from Combustion Lounge, Titus' company. I do hope some of you were lucky to buy the TV show on dvd before it became a collectors item. Go see him live, too. I saw him when he was working out Love Is Evol, but also did bits from this dvd, in 2007. I liked to call that phase ""Love is the End Of The World.""

Oh yeah, check out his podcast on his website or on itunes. It's funny as hell, which should go without saying....",1393200000,2,1207,4.14957264957265
6044440,5,B00G1X52FS,"I find it hard to believe no one else has reviewed this! Simple review ""Buy this!"" If you are a fan of brilliant standup, do not hesitate in adding this (and anything else of his you can get ) to your collection. Do not wait till it can not be bought here, as Titus usually only sells these through his own website, & the only way to pay is via Paypal. Do it! press the ""Add to cart"" button & get it now",1387065600,2,403,3.8674698795180724
