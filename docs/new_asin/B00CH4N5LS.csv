A lot of the information in the video is pertinent to everyone on a scrum team, but some of it is more useful for a dedicated scrum master, which makes sense given the title.

The format of the video is the author white-boarding the discussion he is having with his audience.  At times the whiteboard drawing would get a little distracting, and the speed of the author's content would slow down or speed up; this was something easy for me to overlook due to the usefulness of the actual content.

On a side note, if you ever get the chance to see Daniel Markham speak, you should definitely try to attend.  I enjoyed his in-person presentation more than the video, but there are a bunch of goodies in the video that I found a lot of value in.",1381276800,,868,4.333333333333333
