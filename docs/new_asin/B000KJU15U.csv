2693055,5,B000KJU15U,"I began showing this to my Spanish classes as soon as it came out.  In fact, one of my Mexican-American students told me about it (gracias Ian!).  I teach in an urban school with a diverse population.  Social justice is a huge issue in our building and community.  I have been amazed at how much this film has impacted my students.  They connected deeply with the students in the film.  There are so many discussion topics that came out of the film: inequality, poverty, heritage languages, student activism, cultural chasms, the connection to the civil rights movement, I could go on.  I urge everyone to watch this film.  I encourage my fellow teachers to incorporate this film into their curriculum.  And you don't have to be from an urban area to feel the power of the inequalities in the film or be Latino to feel the pride of these students.  It gives me chills everytime I hear a student call ""Walkout!"" or ""Viva la Raza"" or ""Chicano Power!""",1178755200,17,948,4.589285714285714
2693056,3,B000KJU15U,"Good intentions doesn't make a good movie, that's what I felt  when I saw Walkout, the tale of a group of mexican americans (or chicanos as they are proud to be called) LA students in the late 60's, who fight, among other things, for the right of history recognition, respect of their heritage and equal treatment. So far so good, the fight for civil rights (Costa Gavras, Spike Lee, to  name  two  directors who have acomplished great movies dealing political issues)  can be material for the kind of  films that stick in your soul  for a lifetime, but  Walkout falls short  of achieving that goal,  even though the ambientation is great, the movie is episodic and not very interesting.  Its  like a cable tv  political panflet. I like Edward James Olmos and  his passion for the latino cause, I hope his next  project will be  less obvious, that's what art and movies are about.",1177804800,5,880,4.616883116883117
2693057,5,B000KJU15U,"La pelicula me encanto. Me esperaba algo muy bueno porque me encanta como trabaja Edward James Olmos y no me senti defraudada para nada, todo lo contrario.

Yo tengo apenas 5 aos que llegue a vivir a este pais y debo reconocer que no conocia esta historia. Asi que me senti muy orgullosa al ver lo que hicieron.

El guion, las actuaciones, las caracterizaciones, la direccion, todo excelente. Felicidades a todos los que pariciparon haciendola.

Me encanto ver al final de la pelicula a los participantes de las manifestaciones contando su experincia. Sobre todo el ultimo, debo reconocer que me ganaron las lagrimas cuando vi al profesor decir que se sintio orgulloso de ser chicano.

Tengo hijos que llegaron aqui muy chiquitos y uno que nacio aqui, asi que quiero que ellos se sientan orgullosos de ser chicanos tambien.

Gracias a todos las personas que pusieron su granito de arena para que nios como ellos tengan acceso a la universidad, no sean golpeados por hablar espaol y gracias tambien por todas las demas cosas por las que lucharon.

Felicidades.",1173571200,5,1059,4.888268156424581
2693058,5,B000KJU15U,"I love this movie. The version I saw was an all but finished screening with the director a few weeks before the movie was shown on HBO. The movie had its cheesy moments but ultimately redeemed itself. I thought it was very well done.

I agree with the previous reviewer...this movie will make you proud of Chicano history the way Iron Jawed Angeles makes you proud of Women's History.",1172620800,3,384,4.565217391304348
2693059,5,B000KJU15U,"My introduction to the social activism of young Latinos during the Civil Rights Era came via a C-Span promotion of a book entitled ""We Were There, Too"", which features stories about real-life teenagers who helped  shape the course of American  History during various eras.
  This HBO film, which is 2006's answer to ""Iron Jawed Angels"", fleshes out the characters involved, many of whom take part in the reenactment of their story.
 It is early 1968 in East Los Angeles, California. Young Paula Crisostomo (a beauteous, effervescent, and charismatic Alexa Vega) and honor student at the predominantly Chicano Abraham Lincoln High School, observes the indignities imposed upon her fellow students by condescending White school authorities. Students are denied access to the school restrooms at certain times of the school day, but are punished for going to the bathroom behind the bushes of the campus or on grilles in the pavement.  They receive corporal punishment for speaking Spanish in class (which, in real life, included slapping by teachers, although this is not portrayed in the film), they receive no information about Chicano contributions to American Society in History Class, are denied recommendations for Universities, and when in detention, are forced to do janitorial duty. The White principals  don't even care to learn how to pronounce students' names properly, and when students' petition for better treatment is met with apathy by the predominantly White School Board, Paula, who has joined a group of radical Chicanos whom she met at a student leadership conference, suggests that the inner city schools stage a walkout.
 Michael Pena, as Sal Castro, is fun-loving, instructional, and inspiring as the only Chicano teacher on the LHS faculty, who guides the young students through their struggle.
 Paula, who works in a movie theatre, also faces opposition from her father(Yancey Arias), a janitor, who disliked her association with perceived  agitators, but receives a bit more support from her mother (Laura Harring--still as lovely as she was when crowned Miss Universe in 1985), who expresses concern about Paula's potential repetition of a life mistake that she made.
  March 6, 1968 begins with tense anticipation (as well as continued police surveillance) for Paula, Harry Gamboa(Germain de Leon), Mita Cuaron (Marisol Romo), Moctezuma Esparza(Bodie Olmos), and all the young leaders of the protest.
 But at 9AM, an anxious, and initially weak-voiced Paula bravely fulfills her end of the bargain, as do the others. It is a truly powerful moment captured by the media.
 A fun moment follows as we watch Sal, the students, and Brown Berets dance to ""Land of a Thousand Dances"" in celebration of their peaceful protest.
 They receive word from the Chicano member of the School Board, Julian Nava (a dignified Edward James Olmos, who masterfully directed this production) that their demands would be considered the following week. Ultimately, the student leaders are not satisfied with that, and there is a second walkout the following day (in which some schools participate, but others do not), which has hazardous results.
  The leaders of the protest are fully aware of a police informant among their ranks, although they were unable to place him, or her. The protests of March 9 are met not only by police brutality towards unarmed students-some of whom are hospitalized--but also by innacurate commentary
about the event by a condescending White news commentator who lacks any real understanding of minority issues to add insult to injury.
 The final school protest finds Lincoln High School students participating in the walkouts yet again, only this time, joined by their parents in the wake of potential police hostility.
 As Sal observed, it was a beautiful day to be a Chicano.
 The beauty and solidarity of that moment is soon shattered by the arrests of the Brown Berets, Sal, and others as Paula prepares for her prom. A weeping Vickie Castro (Tonantzin Esparza), the college student who befriended Paula, comes to collect the High School Senior to figure out a plan of action.
 The Chicano community rallies in protest against the unlawful arrests, and we see students aspiring to become more than society allows them to be.
 One of the most stirring and heartening scenes is when Bobby Verdugo's brother (Gabriel Torres), asks him, ""What are you going to be when you grow up, Bobby?"", and Bobby responds, ""I don't know. But when I find out, I'm going to be it!""
 Que viva la esperanza!
 Paula eventually confronts the informant as she and a crowd of Latinos demand the release of the East L.A. 13, and the American systems of justice and education gain a few more friends that day.
 The walkouts spread across the country, and America is a better place in many ways as a result.
 The question the majority of Americans should ask as they watch this brilliant film is how they would feel if their children were treated the same way in school. An interesting question considering that the same year the East L.A. 13 had their convictions thrown out of court, four white students (who were protesting more violently than the Latinos) were shot dead at Kent State.
 Generally, this is a thoroughly commendable production about Chicanos, by Chicanos, capturing the turbulence of the '60s with precison, but leaving us with the message that anyone can change things for the better.",1165622400,27,5415,5.103057757644394

2693077,5,B000KJU15U,A very good movie.  I agree with 99% of the student's suggestions.  The only thing that seemed a little trivial was serving Mexican food in the cafeteria.  I am 84 and am of Hispanic descent and love Mexican food.  I feel that if a student wanted it so much they could wait  till they got home or go to a Mexican fast food vendor.,1442880000,,330,4.09375

2693090,5,B000KJU15U,"This is another movie that all American's need to watch. The American people need to be aware of their history and how the American people are treated by the ruling elite and their private army the police officers when they stand up for their rights as human beings.

Directed by Edward James Olmos this is a film shows the abuse toward Chicano students in the government schools in East. L.A.
in the late 1960s.

Michael Pena plays the role of Sal Castro the high school teacher who helped the students as they gathered together in order to

protest and stand up for their rights as human beings.

The reason for the Text in the Subject Heading of this Comment is because the actor Michael Pena who plays the part of Sal Castro in this film, also plays the part of Cesar Chavez in the new movie that just came on Cesar's birthday 3-31-14 which has
now become Cesar Chavez Day.

There was a funny line in the movie that makes me laugh even now when I think about it. Alexa Vega comes home from a meeting one evening and tells her dad that she is a Chicana. And her father tells her no she's not a Chicana because he was born in the Philippians, then he said that makes her a Chilipena.",1396310400,3,1185,4.31981981981982

2693094,5,B000KJU15U,This movie is great. It shows a part of the civil rights movements that has not been taught at schools. It is rare to find any type of movie of Latinos in the United States and this movie vividly showed the emotion and how it does make an impact.

2693099,5,B000KJU15U,This movie exemplifies how an organized group of people have power as long the protesting purpose is just and is in done a peaceful way.

All parents with kids who want to teach their kids right from wrong, need to allow their kids to watch this wonderful film.

2693103,5,B000KJU15U,"There isn't much in the textbook about Mexican-Americans trying to gain civil rights, so this DVD is a great addition to the U.S. History teacher's library. It realistically portrays walkouts staged by Mexican-American high school students in East L.A. in 1968 to protest the unequal education they were receiving--not learning about their heritage, being punished for speaking Spanish in school, not having bathrooms available at lunch, not being encouraged to apply for college, etc. Some of those walkouts turned violent because the police began beating the students on national TV, much to the horror of the viewing audience. After that, networks censored the protests. Eventually, students were able to present their complaints to the Board of Education, but little was done to help them. This is a harsh lesson for students--just because a group is in the right and tries really hard, doesn't mean they will win.",1356134400,3,918,5.2517006802721085

They wanted to be treated Equally, with respect, they had to get swated and paddled just for speaking spanish? Who would treat somebody else's kids like that? It was time to take a stand, those kids got into College, the school board allowed these kids to put their foot down, and say what they had to say. So, I wanna send a big CONGRATULATIONS to these kids who took a stand for their Education, and to Mr. Castro for allowing these kids to Stand Up As One. WE LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!

This movie would have been better if it had shown more positive portrayals of them.  It would have been nice to see some of them walking alongside the Chicanos, as a show of unison.  I take exception because I am of Anglo-Saxon ancestry and I wish that these movies would stop villifying my ethnic group.  We're not all racist monsters.",1331251200,,544,4.945054945054945

The history of Chicanos in California, and their Civil Rights struggle, is so often overlooked in American history. This is a well-made, engaging movie that keeps you enthralled and teaches you a little bit about what the Chicano students in California once went through.

2693113,5,B000KJU15U,"Walkout not only came in perfect shape, with the plastic still over the cover, but is an excellent movie describing the conditions of certain low-classed students in a rundown part of the suburbs who were willing to stand up for their rights and freely protest the poor treatment given to them in their schools, which offered little hopes for their education, and future in general. I didn't much like the way the police came in and arrested many of these students, especially with them taking a few whacks at the underage minor kids as if they were terrorists of a sort, but in the end, even their parents came to help support them in their cause, and the movie has a moral to it: That every student in this country is entitled to a better education, despite their ethnic background and the color of their skin, or how their names sound.

I first watched Walkout on an HBO viewing three years ago, and ever since then, I had vowed to put that movie on my shelf that holds hundreds of other movies. If not for Amazon, I probably would have spent the next 20 years trying to find it in every store and rundown pawn shop, and probably failing.

2693116,5,B000KJU15U,This is a great movie to show to young Latino youth that are messing up in school. So they can see what the Latino/Chicano/Mexican American youth had to endure and fight for in the 60's against the public school system. When I have shown this movie to my students in Sunday School at our church it totally changed them!,1248048000,,319,4.423728813559322
2693117,5,B000KJU15U,"Great movie! It was very well done, I especially like the scene where the teacher is asking the student to read something from the textbook she'll never find - our part in the history of America! (American History! Native American History!)

I'm glad they mentioned the educational tracks. I know about the tracks, kind of like a ""glass ceiling"" only worse because it can hold a child back for the rest of their life. In my case, six years before this took place in east LA, they discouraged me from going to college for vocational school instead. (I am Pueblo & American-Mexican Indian)

This movie reminded me of the fear I felt back then of what the police would do and it brought back the tears of pride at what they accomplished. It was great to see the students at the end and what they are doing today.

When HBO releases movies on topics like this, respectfully done, it give me hope. Thank you HBO and Amazon.",1183766400,,918,4.485029940119761
2693118,5,B000KJU15U,"With so many negative role models in the media and real life for minority children, this film exposes society to a truly inspiring idea--the disenfranchised CAN succeed in mainstream America!  ""Walkout"" is an amazing piece of history that should be required viewing for everyone, from Congress trying to legislate immigration reform to impoverished high school students who have never thought of a way up and out in life.  Thank you, HBO, for championing this project and giving our society this authentic and moving testament to the power of education.",1180569600,10,553,5.202247191011236

8157727,5,B000KJU15U,"This was a great DVD.  I'm glad that I saw this before the recent so-called ""walkout"" after the February 14, 2018 school massacre in Parkland, Florida.  THAT was a walkout that was really a national event run from above, where students did not have to disobey teachers.  THIS DVD showed a REAL walkout, initiated by students against the wills of their teachers.  My only problem, besides of course wondering how much the movie reflected what really happened (movies tend to change things), was that the star is a girl who complains about lack of educational opportunities, while instantly recognizing German and Hebrew books in the library of another school.  To know that the book was Hebrew and not Yiddish or Aramaic, and to recognize German, is NOT the mark of someone with little educational opportunity.  But leave it to Hollywood...",1521936000,,839,4.957142857142857

The movie will only play up to the beginning credits then it stops working. Very disappointed not sure if I'll ever buy DVDs here again,1496534400,,326,3.8805970149253732
