2411398,5,B000BBOF90,"I had never seen Kimba before, although I was certainly aware of the Japanese animation appearing on American television in the '60's.  Along with Kimba, there was Speed Racer, Marine Boy and Astro Boy, as well as many others.  I purchased this product based on word of mouth and the reviews online, including here at Amazon.

I was not disappointed at all.  Physically, the product arrived as advertised.  All the DVDs were packaged in high quality materials, brightly designed.  I couldn't wait to view the programs and extras.

The included booklet and bonus features disc were informative and entertaining.  The inclusion, on the bonus disc, of songs from the original Japanese version made me wish I could understand Japanese.  A minor nitpick: Subtitles would have been nice here, but subtitles -are- included for the included original Japanese version of the first episode.

No worries though, as the rest of the 52 original episodes, as they appeared on 1960's American television, had been expertly dubbed into English at the time.

The Japanese version of Kimba was the first anime series broadcast in color in Japan.  Kimba is an odd sort of cartoon, a kind you unfortunately don't see much on television these days.  Certainly it was designed for children; there are bright colors, songs and entertaining and sympathetic characters.  I would suggest Kimba for any family with children.

But there's more.  There are lessons here for children and adults alike.  Tezuka's original story, as it appeared in manga (Japanese comic books, basically) in the 1950's, had very adult themes at times.  The main character, orphaned by humans, fought against his own animal instincts and desires for revenge in an attempt to live peacefully with all creatures, including humans.  Death happens, usually leading to an epiphany for the main character or a sort of ""deathbed"" conversion of the unfortunate.  These are certainly odd topics for an American cartoon of the 1960's, made even more odd by the dubbing and editing attempts made by the Americans to soften events.

""Kimba"" tells the story of the first half of the life of the young lion prince.  The adult portion of his life was covered in the 1960's Japanese animated series ""Jungle Emperor: Onward Leo"" as well as in a big-budget theatrical release in 1997 called ""Jungle Emperor Leo.""  This movie is available from Amazon.  Be warned though, both the sequel series and the movie are darker and more realistically violent, while retaining there lessons about life and family.  The movie ends as the orginal manga did, with the ultimate sacrifice of a major character, and the promise of the continuation of the main character's progeny.  NOT for small kids, in my opinion.  But worth seeing.

The music in Kimba is incredible, once again above and beyond anything in ""Made in America"" cartoons.  This is because the music, scored for full orchestra and choir, was created by Isao Tomita.  Tomita went on to create great electronic music in the 70's and 80's, but it is said that he believes his works for Kimba (especially in it's Japanese form Jungle Emperor) was some of his best.

In summary, Kimba is worth having for it's historical and nostalgic value.  Moreover it has important messages for children (and adults!) who may otherwise be lost in a sea of violent videos and cartoons.  I highly suggest you give it a look.

2411399,5,B000BBOF90,"This is the one that fans of Kimba the White Lion have been waiting for!  It contains the original theme music and voices from the 1965 version!  The video releases of some Kimba episodes in the 1990s were disappointing, containing a new, somewhat boring theme tune, and different character voices.  This box set is superb - all 52 episodes are fully restored, complete with the original soundtrack, and the discs are beautifully presented.  It brought back wonderful memories, and the new generation just love the stories!",1131062400,52,523,5.046511627906977
2411400,5,B000BBOF90,"Finally they are coming out with an ultimate box set!  I have been waiting for this for a while.  I am so happy, and I am sure anyone who is a fan of Kimba will want this.",1130889600,12,171,3.5945945945945947
2411401,5,B000BBOF90,"Kimba The White Lion is one of the greatest animated series of all time. It has been (and is) shown all over the world and is still popular today, 40 years after it was first made. It is accessible to the youngest children, and its themes of love for all life and the need for understanding between humanity and the animal kingdom keep it alive in adults' hearts.

Kimba is publicized as the first color anime. You might then think that it is primitive, but the use of color in the show was truly joyous, and the quality of animation is fully the equal of any TV anime today--often superior. The rich, expressive full-orchestral score by Isao Tomita (played by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra) is a major asset, too.

For the American dubbed version, experienced radio actors were employed to give voices to the characters. (Billie Lou Watt, the voice of Kimba, had an impressive list of credits reaching up to the recent Courage The Cowardly Dog.) Their superb skill and talent make me wonder what happened to the art of dubbing since then.

Kimba the White Lion is a brilliant, fun, and thoughtful show. Everyone to whom I've shown this show, loves it.

The shows on this DVD set are the original, 1966 version with Billie Lou Watt as Kimba. I have seen test pressings of these DVDs, and they present Kimba looking better than ever before. You can safely trash any and all Kimba DVDs you might have bought before. These are that much better.",1126828800,60,1444,4.607003891050583
2411402,1,B000BBOF90,"I am absolutely stunned at the one-sidedness of the reviews here. As of my writing this, all 5 stars except for one 4. Perhaps you fell in love with it as children and further romanticize the memory of it because you haven't seen it since then. Such may be deserved for some things, but least of all this. It's as if you've all been brainwashed. Now it deserves a LITTLE credit considering it came from the era of the 1960s and maybe all the stuff about equality of the animals may have been an allegory for the civil rights movement, but it went beyond absurd. It is more absurd than the most tongue-in-cheek satire the South Park guys have ever been capable of creating, and it doesn't even do it deliberately.

First of all, let me get this straight. His father, Caesar, the white lion king, believed so strongly that all animals should be free and live happily that he took livestock from farms. Oh no, he didn't eat them. He FREED them. Yes, you heard me. Awww, doesn't that just warm the cockles of your heart? The image of a LION freeing domesticated livestock so that they can prance around in the jungle, or the Okavango or wherever in Africa it was supposed to be? (they wouldn't survive a week, by the way) It makes me wonder. Just WHAT did he EAT? What exactly did the just and mighty Caesar live off of? Love? It may be possible for their bodies to tolerate soy protein or something - though it has never been done in captivity, and I don't think he had crops growing, but otherwise an adult lion needs to eat 5 or 10 pounds of meat a day on average or he'll wither away and DIE! And there is nothing bad about it. They don't eat meat out of maliciousness or evil, they eat it because they need it. There is no equality of the animals, and it is a lousy allegory to racial issues among humans. That's the mistake Hitler made in his Mein Kampf, equating interracial relations to interspecies relations.

Then there's the part where Kimba's teaching the other animals to talk. Now this part was worthy of George Orwell, though again, not deliberately! What with their goal to talk like a human, to WALK like a human. I couldn't help thinking 'four legs baaaaaaaaaaad, two legs gooooooodddddd!'. If Kimba learned to talk that's one thing, that's all fine and dandy. Ok, one lion that has learned to talk. Good for him. Nice for him to know that if he ever needs to he could put on a suit and a tie and maybe make it in the human world, make millions selling his biography maybe. But what came next was just... really, really annoying.

And then Kimba is just so tirelessly moralistic it's disgusting. Fighting is wrong, fighting is wrong, fighting is wrong, he repeats. Yeah, animals in the jungle should never HURT each other! That would be WRONG! Those bad old villainous hyenas, 'bullying' that poor deer. They should just go and eat some soybeans or something. Get some fast food. And be nice to each other. Yeah! Oh, and don't worry about where that meat the guy hands you actually came from, but object to the practices that procure it just the same (we actually see Kimba get fed meat by the first 'good' guy in episode 2).

Kimba first escaped the boat in episode 1 with the help of the rats who were being oppressed by those 'awful' cats, who were also given cliche sinister attributes. All they were missing were top-hats and handlebar mustaches. Maybe a damsel, a bunch of rope, and a train. It reminded me of a Tom and Jerry cartoon. And then why exactly is it he jumps into the ocean again? Because it's SAFER than being on the boat which is headed for a storm? Yes, kids, remember now! If you're on large ocean-liner and a storm is approaching, you should definitely jump overboard because it is much safer without a boat in the middle of the ocean in a storm than with one, because it just might sink! I think it would be far healthier to imitate Beavis and Butthead, don't you?

Of course, in Kimba's deals with humans, I've noticed that all the 'bad' ones are ugly while the 'good' ones are rather dashing. So trite. But of course it doesn't end there. The first bad one isn't just a poacher or something, he's a freaking A-bomb dealer! I mean, come ON! And then the first 'good' one (back to episode 2), who can talk to Kimba (this is before Kimba learns to 'speak' - of course they talk all the time and all non-human species can communicate amongst each other with COMPLETE ease - and we hear English - or Japanese if it was AVAILABLE as an audio track - but like in Garfield we're just supposed to imagine that's what the animal's saying in some sort of animal language that all animals but humans understand) because he's just so close to animals or something, and they escape together and journey across - what was that, the Sahara desert? He has a beautiful death leaving Kimba with the lesson that not all humans are 'bad'. Well, I've got news for you little leo. The good humans' garbage smells just as bad, and their cars' exhaust does too! The 'few bad ones' aren't the human threat you have to worry about. They don't have a monopoly on making your ecosystem vanish. I don't want to wipe out nature, nor am I using traditional Chinese medicine (i.e. body parts from endangered species) but I sit here writing this in my air-conditioned room on a planet with twice as many humans as it had when I was born and still more born-again believers in the manifest destiny thinking it's god's will to have large families, and you can't tell me that we won't wipe 'em out no matter how well-meaning some of us may wish to be.

Well, that's enough. In conclusion, I'd have to say, something earns camp status if it's bad enough. But this is just so bad, so NAIVE, I feel it loses it again. It's like Star Trek to the 10th power with its endless shallow morals! And it REALLY deserves an opinion to offset the crazy string of 5-star reviews by its patron brainwashees. I wish I wasn't suckered into trying this sucker out by its unanimous praise. Hopefully I can save a few other saps from the same with this warning. I started watching it thinking Disney was the shameless bad guy for not giving credit where credit was due, but you know what, I think I get them now: referring to this as an influence would be something to be embarrassed about!",1212883200,12,6274,4.4371205550737205
2411403,5,B000BBOF90,"Picked this DVD box set a few months back for my 6 year old daughter for Xmas.  I had always loved Kimba as a child, and was Sure my little girl would, too.  I was right.  Although, there are few reminders of Kimba nowadays (except for Disney's The Lion King rip-off), the stories and Japanese anime last the test of time.

Kimba combined both high-spirited adventures, charming stories, and a touch of sadness (in some of the stories).  Episodes often deal with problems larger than a child could really grasp, but not in a heavy-handed manner.  There are some sad story lines, like the first, when Kimba is orphaned, but the sadness is tempered with Kimba learning to be aGreat Leader as his father, Caesar, was.",1210896000,6,714,4.626984126984127

2411406,5,B000BBOF90,"Leo the Lion (Kimba in English) is the principal character in a set of three Japanese original animated series that were dubbed into several languages.  The characters and stories in all the series are based on Osamu Tezuka's 1950s manga (graphic novel) Jungulu Taitei (Jungle Emperor).  All the video in any release of Leo (or Kimba) is Japanese and was created by Mushi/Tezuka Productions.  Dialog, subtitles, theme songs, and (in one case) background music have been added by other parties.  Editing was also done by others to cut time from the show to fit a production format (usually to make room for commercials).  Theme songs which ran with the opening and closing credits were created in the target languages.

The 1965 series is Kimba (Leo) as a cub.  This series was funded by NBC and it is the one for sale here.  Some (initial) technical help with color production was provided by people from Disney. It is a purely Japanese product (video, dialog, music, sound effects), but it was made to be dubbed, that is, the dialog track was kept separate from the other audio so that it could easily be replaced with another language.  (NBC needed it that way, of course.)  Because the first English dub was released in 1966, some people refer to this as the ""1966 version"" of the show.  This is confusing because the Japanese sequel was released in 1966 and should be known as the 1966 version.

The NBC dub of the show, ""Kimba, the White Lion"", changed the character names (Leo became Kimba), created a wonderful theme song, and set a very high standard for the vocal acting.  The show has also been dubbed into Italian (as Kimba), German (as Kimba), French (as Leo), and Spanish (as Kimba).  What differs among these dubs is the dialog (including character names), the cuts, and the opening and closing themes.  The video, music, and sound effects are the original Japanese.

A second English dub was released in 1993 using only the video from the 1965 series.  All the audio was replaced.  This dub is sometimes referred to as the ""1993 version"" but it is simply a more radical dub of the 1965 series.  This is the dub that appears on single DVDs in dollar stores and has generally poor video quality.

The 1966 series is Leo as an adult and father.  It is a sequel that Mushi did without any outside funding.  Mushi offered it to NBC but they declined.  It continues the story line with new episodes but retains only a few of the major characters from the 1965 series.

The 1989 series is a re-invention of the 1965 series.  Sometimes called ""The New Adventures of Kimba"" (in English).  It is an attempt by Tezuka to convert the fantasy into something more realistic and serious.  It follows a similar story line (Leo's youth) but the episodes are original.  A handful of the major characters from the 1965 series were retained but most are unique to this series.  Complicating the controversy regarding the artistic merit of the series is the fact that Tezuka died shortly after production began, so that his direct influence ended with the sixth episode.

I am inclined to believe that Eiichi Yamamoto deserves far more credit than he ever receives for the appeal of the animated version of Leo's character.  Tezuka's drawings and Yamamoto's animation are quite different.  The animated character is strikingly beautiful.  And the stories were softened and redirected toward a worldwide youthful audience.  Yamamoto was caught between Tezuka's hard-edged manga and NBC's demand for a children's show.  It must have cost him a lot of sleepless nights but the result is a masterpiece.  (Even so, there are episodes of Kimba that are still banned in Germany.)  IMO Kimba '65 is the best children's animated TV series ever produced.",1187136000,9,3738,4.802507836990595

My only criticism, and many may not notice, is that the dark black areas look dark grey to me on my Pioneer plasma.  To compensate, I simply turn down the brightness, until those areas turn true black and voila, you can remaster it to match current TV technology.

The sound is well balanced, the images clear, aside from a few artifacts, here and there, easily masked by turning down sharpness on your TV.  There's even a bonus DVD featuring interviews with the creator of Kimba and shots of the drawing boards, etc., a must for true anime or Kimba fans.

For those unfamiliar with Kimba, this is the original Simba story that we all know as the Lion King.  In this version, his father's fate is not at the hands of an evil uncle, but I will leave it to you to discover the rest, as the story is inspired by, but not a complete copy of this one.

As you watch the first episode, and then the rest, you discover and so will your kids, a remarkable show that features great music, great animation (for its time) and multiple layers of meaning.  Each story teaches a lesson, but over all the morality and intelligence behind them all shines through.  Violence should only be used as a last resort, team work wins the day, protect those that are weak from bullies, forgive, be strong, those that we lose are always with us in spirit, size is unimportant, fight for what is right, and courage in the face of fear is the mark of a true hero.  All these universal lessons and more are adeptly taught in the context of all animal kingdom led by one of the cutest white lions you'll ever meet.
