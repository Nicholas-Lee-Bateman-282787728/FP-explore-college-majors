988040,5,6305205825,"Galaxy Invader is a home made movie written and directed by Don Dohler that I first heard about as a kid living in New England.  The news had a piece on the movie, mostly because it was a movie made in Maryland by local people.  I later saw it as the credits of Pod People, which was being shown by MST3K, and it made my memory jump.  The scene where the crashing spaceship causes the car to stall is the same one the news casters showed AND was on the MST3K tape.  But it wasn't till years later, when I saw George Stover in the movies Stakes and Vampire Sisters, both Don Dohler films, did it hit me.  Also the fact that a few of the people, in the behind the scenes features for those DVDs, talked about the movie kind of helped me remember also.
So I went on a search.  And found it on VHS.  As of now it is also on DVD.  Anyway the plot is simple.  Alien crashes.  Some people try to help him and some want to sell him for money.  The fun is in the delivery and, boy, is it funny.  Also the guy playing the college professor somehow reminded me of the guy who was Captain 20 when I lived in Virginia.  Go figure.
Not only is it cool, in that cult classic kind of way, but because it was in the background of my life, dancing just out of the corner of my eyes, I feel like I grew up with this film even if I only saw it, from start to finish, this year.",1186963200,2,1357,3.9267399267399266
988041,1,6305205825,"Alien spaceman, who looks like a cross between Swamp Thing and the Sleestaks from ""Land of the Lost"", crashes in a backwoods Maryland forest and gets chased around by busch guzzling rednecks intent on selling him. To whom exactly? Typical disfunctional redneck family drama with an alien subplot thrown in. The middle of the film seems to drag forever. The music is cheesily dated and the acting is sub-porn level. GI is included on the Mill Creek Sci-Fi Classics package, and it's defintely one of the clunkers in the lot. Could be entertaining after eating mushrooms and drinking a bottle of sangria, but you'll get more out of watching the designs on the wallpaper move or trying to write the next great American road novel and taking off for LA, forgetting you have to work at McDonalds in the morning.",1152403200,,806,4.764285714285714

They eventually capture it but then it eventually escapes. Also the dick of the group named Joe played by the not so talented Richard Ruxton finds an interest in the creatures weapon which is a gun and there is a white ball which makes it power up so it can shoot it. What the hell?! That creature looked like if you meshed together Swamp Thing with the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Not mistaken the Creature from the Blue Lagoon which was Brooke Shields but you get my drift. Mix in a little Toxic Avenger while you're at it and that's what the ridiculous creature looked like. It even took a pose when it shot someone! The music is classic but this isnt. It could be one of the worst films ever made and I'll jot that down in my book. Everything stinks in this movie.

This movie should never be watched by anyone, ever. It has long been available on VHS, but until now most people were safe, but no longer: I am afraid to report that ""The Galaxy Invader"" is now available on two different compilation DVD sets, and my advice to you is this: run away as fast as you can. I am a very devoted fan of extremely bad films, but this film treads in an area rarely seen: the movie so bad that it is excruciating.

I have no idea who thought this was a good idea, and I have even less of an idea about who thought these people could act. The film starts with the typical 1980s synthesizer-laden credit sequence reminiscent of ""Space Mutiny"" though with less craft and panache. The plot is vaguely like ""Pod People"" only not as intelligent or coherent. The premise is that a spaceship lands on earth near Harleyville (really) and a lone green occupant wanders around the countryside for a while alternately getting captured by and escaping from the stupidest rednecks in history. In the entire cast there is not a single person who can act, but at least the characters make up for their thespian ineptitude by being thoroughly disagreeable and wholly detestable.

The alien (or as the idiots term him ""the green man"") has a glowing ball device that somehow powers a hairdryer-like taser weapon that the rednecks want. During all this there is back story about a drunken father and his relationship with his family as well as a geeky student and a professor (""Dr. Tracy"") who not only has the ugliest clothes you have ever seen, and not only drives the most ridiculous car you have ever seen, but is without any question the very worst actor you have ever seen.

Please pay particular attention to the sophisticated plan for capturing the green man put forth by the redneck posse. (Hint: it involves a lasso made of clothesline cord.) After they catch the green guy, they put him in a garage. An actual garage. What I'm saying here is that much of this movie was actually made in someone's garage. Eventually Dr. Tracy and his young cohort free the green man in one of the least ingenious plans ever and a chase ensues. The tide turns when a girl with Leif Garrett hair brings the ball and hairdryer to the alien and there is gunplay in the woods. Please also note the hand-to-hand tussle in the woods, which features the very worst fight choreography ever. The conclusion is not to be missed, as the alien guy sustains some heavy injuries (we think he's dead but can't be sure as this has happened about four or five other times), while the chief redneck gets done in by a cunning plan involving his skull, a rifle stock, and a mountain. This action culminates in the most fake looking dummy in history being tossed over a cliff during the ""redneck plunge of death"" sequence.

This movie is relentless. It is not only painful, but boring. It really and truly is in a class of films that are reserved exclusively for battle-hardened veterans of other truly pathetic films. Any movie that makes ""Chickboxer"" look good has got to be bad, and I would rather watch ""Chickboxer"" one hundred times followed by the entire Coleman Francis catalog than ever sit through ""The Galaxy Invader"" again. It's that bad.",1146700800,3,3263,4.6286701208981
988044,1,6305205825,"This movie is just plain awful.  The acting is horrible, the plot is dumb, and the special effects are beyond cheesy.  In the pantheon of bad movies, this one has little in the way of redeeming characteristics and much in the way of groans.

An alien lands on earth for reasons that the movie never discusses.  The alien looks something like the ""Creature from the Black Lagoon,"" except he has a skimpy costume, which I am sure is highly attractive to other similar aliens, and his skin is bumpier, which I attribute to too much time in tanning salons.  Unfortunately for this alien, he has landed in the middle of red-neck hell, the capital of which seems to be Harleyville, Maryland.

Given that the people in Harleyville seem to have little to do, someone spotted the alien's spaceship landing.  The next thing you know, the local rednecks try to play ball with the alien.  Then the locals try playing hide and seek at night with the alien.  When the alien appears to be winning, the locals try to shoot the alien.  Unfortunately, the alien's weapon is much more powerful and accurate than those of the locals, and shoots powerful fireworks that zoom all over the place and yet seem to be lethal, like old guy farts.

We get several subplots in this movie.  There is the relationship between Carol Montague (Faye Tilles) and Michael Smith (Cliff Lambert), which red-neck father Joe Montague (Richard Ruxton) disapproves.  We frequently see Carol and David running about trying to help the alien.  Then there is Dr. Tracy (Richard Dyszel, who has also played Bozo the Clown in some local markets) and his former student David Harmon (Greg Dohler), who first spotted the alien ship landing.  Dr. Tracy and David Harmon are interested in the scientific aspects of what they initially think is a meteor.  How can you tell Dr. Tracy is a scientist?  Well, he uttered the classic line, ""My sources in the scientific community,"" when he referred to the nature of the meteor.  Real scientists talk like that.  Really.  I am not kidding.  Really.  Never mind.

Then there is Joe Montague and Frank Custor (Don Leifert), who initially want the alien's ball, and then later want the alien because they see a great opportunity to make a bundle from selling the alien to Asians who want to make the alien into an aphrodisiac.  Okay, I made that last part up, but they did want to sell the alien, and it could have been to Asians.  Frank Custor also has a really hot girlfriend, Vicky Johnson (Theresa Harold), who is in a three-way competition with Frank and Joe to see which has intelligence closest to a box of rocks.

There are a few moments in the movie where there are almost moments of tension, but I was groaning so much that I failed to be tense.  Scenes of the alien skulking in someone's basement I found puzzling.  The fight scenes where everyone was moving slowly enough to make sure they really did not hit each other was like something from an awful Kung Fu movie.  The stupidity of the majority of the actors in combination with the terrible acting turned this whole movie into a joke.

The best part of this 1985 movie is the music, which is full of synthesizers and rock music that seems to struggle to be 70s or 80s music; the music never really decides which.  I occasionally wondered whether the music was trying to escape this movie.

There is a class of movies that are mediocre, but worth watching.  Then there is a class of movies that are so bad that they become a kind of classic, such as Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 from Outer Space.""  Between these two classes of movies is a class of just plain awful movies that should be allowed to disintegrate into fertilizer; this movie fits into this category.",1140566400,2,3708,4.6106870229007635

988101,4,6305205825,"I really enjoyed this film for a few reasons.  First people can say what they want about it being a bad film,  but when you first start out everything you do making a film will not always be perfect in the Independent Genre.  So a lot of people try to compare Independents to Hollywood which if you pay attention have hundred million dollar budgets that go wrong and badly for the Directors, Producers and Studios from time to time meaning nothing is always a perfect fit.
I have seen the film several times and I like the film because it also opened up the door to watching Don Dohler's future works that would eventually make him a cult film Legend before his passing.  As well I think for the time and the budget this was actually done better than some people are giving it credit here.  Plus with all of the crazy CGI of today I liked the lower tech things in this film quite a bit and it actually isn't as bad a story as some have tried to paint it if you just give it a chance.
I have seen a lot of really bad movies and honestly this one is not as bad as some of the reviewers have tried to paint it.  Plus it was one of those great VHS movies we use to sit around and watch on a Saturday Afternoon when it was raining outside where I grew up before the days of the always connected Internet world.  Something the youth of today really has no idea about.  For me I still enjoy watching this movie and am glad to see it on Amazon.
Plus there is a gentleman by the name of George Stover in this film that went on to play in many Independent Productions out there meaning I believe this should be considered a piece of Independent Film History!",1414886400,,1648,4.160377358490566

I am sure that even the late, great Ed Wood would find this movie well below his standards.  It is a 'movie' only by the loosest definition, as the characters do appear to move on the screen.  Production Values: the version I saw was so drab and the color so washed out that one would suspect it was made with an 8mm Kodak Brownie.  Acting:  Was there any? I believe that if Stanislavsky wasn't already dead, he would commit suicide while viewing this movie.  Dialog: It would have been better if they had eliminated it altogether.  Special Effects: The Alien's Ball device (whatever it was supposed to be) was pretty good as far as balls go, being quite round.  Music: Possibly the best part of the movie, but that is not saying much. In short, I enjoyed it immensely and watch it every time it airs.",1410307200,,910,4.466666666666667

Two UFO researchers try to find the alien before the crazed posse turns it into mincemeat. Of course, the alien is armed with the obligatory ray gun, so the stage is set for some hefty action.

And then, maybe not.

I didn't know embarrassingly bad movies were made as late as 1985. Apparently, I was wrong. ""The Galaxy Invader"" looks like a comic rock video from the period in question. Unfortunately, neither Weird Al Yankovic nor Twisted Sister ever shows up. Instead, we are treated to bad acting and a badly dressed alien who couldn't scare a child. But sure, ""The Galaxy Invader"" does contain a few unexpected twists, showing that the script writer did try to come up with *something*, LOL.

988106,4,6305205825,"This is a very campy film made by the Dohler family who wrote, directed, and starred in this production. Long before the era of MIB to confront galaxy invaders, there were ""rednecks."" Joe Montague (Richard Ruxton) leads the group of country folk hunting the green man. He wears an early version of a ""wife beater shirt"" and indeed he has no respect for women, his family or himself.

In one scene where Frank (Don Leifert) removes his cigar from his mouth, a long stream of saliva comes out. Vicki (Theresa Harold) his girlfriend was equally funny. Please note that Frank drank Busch as his daytime beer, but switched to Bud at night for serious drinking. I like a film that captures those real life details, especially when it misses on everything else.

The dialouge had me laughing, as Joe proclaimed about an alien power ball, ""It's for something, I'm sure of that.""

Filmed in Baltimore, most likely the result of a John Waters influence.

988161,2,6305205825,"The Galaxy Invader ought to come with complementary clothespins because this is one heaping pile of cinematic cow patty. I'm sure there are lots of Dohlers out there who are as fine a folks as you could ever want to meet, but I personally fully intend to run away as fast as my legs can carry me the next time I see or hear that name again. This movie is just plum full of Dohlers - writer/director/editor Don Dohler had his hand in just about everything, and the three different Dohlers included in the cast aren't content to merely make fools of themselves in front of the camera either, choosing to dabble in cinematography and production coordinating (whatever that is). I hope the guy who played the alien used a fake name - since he never appeared without his bargain bin Creature From the Black Lagoon costume on, he alone of everyone associated with The Galaxy Invader might actually be able to hold his head up in public by now (the film dates back to 1985).

Basically, you've got this weird alien dude crashing his spaceship (which we never see hide nor hair of, incidentally) just outside the extremely rural town of Harleyville, Maryland - or, to put it bluntly, Hicksville, USA. The alien does some snooping around for no apparent reason, but he spends the vast majority of his time wandering around in the woods. That's where Joe Montague (Richard Ruxton) finds him while he's out chasing his twenty-five-year-old daughter with a shotgun because she won't stop seeing the son of the Hatfield to his McCoy. He shoots at the creature, knocks a giant ping pong ball off his suit, and scurries home with it, convinced it's going to make him rich. Once local slimeball Frank Custor (Don Leifert) gets wind of it, he sells Joe on the idea of recruiting some local rednecks and going out to catch the ""green man"" himself. The end result of all this is far too much running around in the woods by everyone in this movie; even Robert L. Lippert would be all pooped out after watching so much aimless walking and running.

The alien is almost a secondary plot point, as most of the action centers around the permanently drunk, ripped-T-shirt-wearing, I-had-a-comb-but-lost-it-upteen-years-ago Joe Montague. The man doesn't make a move without a Pabst Blue Ribbon can or liquor bottle in his hand, even though he spends half his time chasing the alien or members of his own family with a shotgun. You could pickle cucumbers in this guy's sweat - that's how sauced he is at all times. The really weird thing is that Joe sometimes sounds like he might be Jimmy Stewart's long-lost (and hope he's never found) brother. Not to be outdone, Frank Custor sounds like - actually, I don't know exactly who or what Frank Custor sounds like, but if Green Acres' Mr. Haney had been from Maryland, he would have been ole Frank. This movie also features a college professor and his former student trying to get to the alien before the hicks do - but these guys are so stiff and bland, you could iron shirts on their backs.

I'm giving the film two stars instead of one just because you can't help but be entertained by the sheer idiocy of the whole project. The script is beneath contempt; the special effects are, uh, not very good; the acting is just embarrassingly pathetic (no one in the entire cast could act like he was wet if you threw him in the ocean); and the ending is exceedingly lame. Worst of all, there's not even one remotely attractive woman in the entire town of Harleyville, which probably explains why all of the men stay drunk 24 hours a day.",1297123200,2,3553,4.618670886075949

The alien (or as the idiots term him ""the green man"") has a glowing ball device that somehow powers a hairdryer-like taser weapon that the rednecks want. During all this there is back story about a drunken father and his relationship with his family as well as a geeky student and a professor (""Dr. Tracy"") who not only has the ugliest clothes you have ever seen, and not only drives the most ridiculous car you have ever seen, but is without any question the very worst actor you have ever seen.

Please pay particular attention to the sophisticated plan for capturing the green man put forth by the redneck posse. (Hint: it involves a lasso made of clothesline cord.) After they catch the green guy, they put him in a garage. An actual garage. What I'm saying here is that much of this movie was actually made in someone's garage. Eventually Dr. Tracy and his young cohort free the green man in one of the least ingenious plans ever and a chase ensues. The tide turns when a girl with Leif Garrett hair brings the ball and hairdryer to the alien and there is gunplay in the woods. Please also note the hand-to-hand tussle in the woods, which features the very worst fight choreography ever. The conclusion is not to be missed, as the alien guy sustains some heavy injuries (we think he's dead but can't be sure as this has happened about four or five other times), while the chief redneck gets done in by a cunning plan involving his skull, a rifle stock, and a mountain. This action culminates in the most fake looking dummy in history being tossed over a cliff during the ""redneck plunge of death"" sequence.

This movie is relentless. It is not only painful, but boring. It really and truly is in a class of films that are reserved exclusively for battle-hardened veterans of other truly pathetic films. Any movie that makes ""Chickboxer"" look good has got to be bad, and I would rather watch ""Chickboxer"" one hundred times followed by the entire Coleman Francis catalog than ever sit through ""The Galaxy Invader"" again. It's that bad.",1240358400,,3232,4.613913043478261

This movie should never be watched by anyone, ever. It has long been available on VHS, but until now most people were safe, but no longer: I am afraid to report that ""The Galaxy Invader"" is now available on DVD, and my advice to you is this: run away as fast as you can. I am a very devoted fan of extremely bad films, but this film treads in an area rarely seen: the movie so bad that it is excruciating.

I have no idea who thought this was a good idea, and I have even less of an idea about who thought these people could act. The film starts with the typical 1980s synthesizer-laden credit sequence reminiscent of ""Space Mutiny"" though with less craft and panache. The plot is vaguely like ""Pod People"" only not as intelligent or coherent. The premise is that a spaceship lands on earth near Harleyville (really) and a lone green occupant wanders around the countryside for a while alternately getting captured by and escaping from the stupidest rednecks in history.

988167,2,6305205825,"The Galaxy Invader ought to come with complementary clothespins because this is one heaping pile of cinematic cow patty.  I'm sure there are lots of Dohlers out there who are as fine a folks as you could ever want to meet, but I personally fully intend to run away as fast as my legs can carry me the next time I see or hear that name again.  This movie is just plum full of Dohlers - writer/director/editor Don Dohler had his hand in just about everything, and the three different Dohlers included in the cast aren't content to merely make fools of themselves in front of the camera either, choosing to dabble in cinematography and production coordinating (whatever that is).  I hope the guy who played the alien used a fake name - since he never appeared without his bargain bin&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creature-From-the-Black-Lagoon/dp/0783240953/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creature From the Black Lagoon</a>&nbsp;costume on, he alone of everyone associated with The Galaxy Invader might actually be able to hold his head up in public by now (the film dates back to 1985).

Basically, you've got this weird alien dude crashing his spaceship (which we never see hide nor hair of, incidentally) just outside the extremely rural town of Harleyville, Maryland - or, to put it bluntly, Hicksville, USA.  The alien does some snooping around for no apparent reason, but he spends the vast majority of his time wandering around in the woods.  That's where Joe Montague (Richard Ruxton) finds him while he's out chasing his twenty-five-year-old daughter with a shotgun because she won't stop seeing the son of the Hatfield to his McCoy.  He shoots at the creature, knocks a giant ping pong ball off his suit, and scurries home with it, convinced it's going to make him rich.  Once local slimeball Frank Custor (Don Leifert) gets wind of it, he sells Joe on the idea of recruiting some local rednecks and going out to catch the ""green man"" himself.  The end result of all this is far too much running around in the woods by everyone in this movie; even Robert L. Lippert would be all pooped out after watching so much aimless walking and running.

The alien is almost a secondary plot point, as most of the action centers around the permanently drunk, ripped-T-shirt-wearing, I-had-a-comb-but-lost-it-upteen-years-ago Joe Montague.  The man doesn't make a move without a Pabst Blue Ribbon can or liquor bottle in his hand, even though he spends half his time chasing the alien or members of his own family with a shotgun.  You could pickle cucumbers in this guy's sweat - that's how sauced he is at all times.  The really weird thing is that Joe sometimes sounds like he might be Jimmy Stewart's long-lost (and hope he's never found) brother.  Not to be outdone, Frank Custor sounds like - actually, I don't know exactly who or what Frank Custor sounds like, but if Green Acres' Mr. Haney had been from Maryland, he would have been ole Frank.  This movie also features a college professor and his former student trying to get to the alien before the hicks do - but these guys are so stiff and bland, you could iron shirts on their backs.

I'm giving the film two stars instead of one just because you can't help but be entertained by the sheer idiocy of the whole project.  The script is beneath contempt; the special effects are, uh, not very good; the acting is just embarrassingly pathetic (no one in the entire cast could act like he was wet if you threw him in the ocean); and the ending is exceedingly lame.  Worst of all, there's not even one remotely attractive woman in the entire town of Harleyville, which probably explains why all of the men stay drunk 24 hours a day.",1217808000,3,3724,4.856240126382306

This movie appears to have been made by someone who is a misogynist.  We aren't even talking down home stereotypical white trash family.  We're talking white supremacist.

This movie is so far beyond the realm of anything real that all I had was disbelief and I it was not something I could sustain.  Firstly, someone shoot the drunken idiot with the torn t-shirt.  He wasn't intelligent enough to manage what he pulled off so it was obviously bad writing driving awful character.

The alien, which was obvious some sort of space suit (wonder what was inside) looked like some hokey 1950's hack costume that was cobbled together by someone who had a penchant for Z grade movies.  I'm sorry folks, if a species develops faster than light and has a portable power pack (spheroid thing) their weapon better do more than make a lot of smoke and noise.  In a firefight that alien should have flattened those lame-wit inbreeds with a few carefully aimed shots.

There was never a true explanation as to why the alien was on Earth and as for Galaxy Invader, who was invading.  The traveler's ship came down, he walked around, got hit, shot at, tied, beaten around and generally didn't do much damage.

This movie is required viewing for anyone who wants to become a film maker.  I urge you to examine the
1: lack of plot
2: incoherent action
3: bad camera angles
4: ridiculously awful lighting.  (Jeez, even a few house lamps would have made for better lighting than this movie had)
5: terrible props
6: terrible locations (I mean really)
7: crap dialogue (a silent movie would have been better)
8: Unnecessary characters (the cast was loaded down with a bunch of worthless detritus actors)
9: Oscar level bad acting and I mean really BAD!!!!
