5379744,5,B00A2XQU6I,"Let me start by saying that when my son was a baby he loved the baby first channel. I would record the educational programs and we would watch them together to help him interact. (As this channel has many shows that do not use alot of words and he was a verbally gifted at a very young age.) I always loved the lullaby and good night programs. Soft soothing music accompanied to slow calming pictures and scenery would do the trick to calm him down for bed. And now, 5 years later, his little sister is 18 mos and we no longer have access to that channel. So when I found this DVD I was thrilled! I absoltely love this! My little one cant even make it through the whole thing without falling asleep and daddy and I find ourselves entranced in it as well (We love the sand artist. Hes mesmerizing lol.) This truly is a must have.",1394841600,2,828,4.213836477987422

5379746,5,B00A2XQU6I,"My 2 year old daughter has a tv in her room and we have used it to keep her entertained at night until she fell asleep. Now that's she's older, we wanted something to calm her down instead of keeping her up. She loves the Baby First TV Channel, so we though this would work and it does. It keeps cycling throughout the night, so we don't have to worry about going back in to hit play when the dvd is done. My daughter (and now our 8 month old) have been watching this every night since Christmas and (usually) fall right asleep. It was a good choice for us and I recommend it.",1389830400,2,576,4.06140350877193
5379747,5,B00A2XQU6I,"My 2 year old niece loves Baby First tv channel.  When she is at my house, that is all we watch,
unless we are watching movies!!",1380672000,,128,3.923076923076923
5379748,5,B00A2XQU6I,"I love this DVD!  I discovered the program at my mother's house and my 4 mo. daughter really seemed to enjoy watching it--she would settle down and drift to sleep.  My husband and I were planning a road trip, driving 12 hours to Alabama with my 3 yr old son and daughter.  I paid for overnight shipping, hoping that my daughter would be able to watch this on a portable DVD and that it would be soothing; helping to make the journey nice at least some of the time.  The DVD is 2 hrs of soothing images and music.  It was a big hit.  Not only would she watch it, but my son would watch it and fall asleep too.  Best few bucks I could have spent.  I wish an electronic version was available for my Kindle or iPAD.  Thinking of buying an extra DVD for her overnight bag or to keep in the car.",1376784000,5,789,4.038709677419355

5379750,4,B00A2XQU6I,"I like this dvd except for the sound between sections. It puts my son to sleep in the car, but if I have it just a tad too loud (and it's not loud at all) the scares him awake. So I keep it really, really low in volume and it's nice.",1372032000,4,233,3.588235294117647
5379771,5,B00A2XQU6I,"A true lifesaver. This helped to keep our two year old clam and peaceful during an extended hospital stay. I would put it on to relax and sooth her, especially before nap or bedtime. The images kept her engaged and the music calmed her, and to be honest they were soothing for me too. I purchased several to donate to the children's hospital to help sooth babies and toddlers.",1454544000,2,376,4.463768115942029

5379776,5,B00A2XQU6I,"We had picked up this DVD on a whim because my little one LOVES many of the segments featured (Black and White, Color Symphony, and Sandman, among many) on another BabyFirst compilation series, and we couldn't beat the deal that we got it for. Needless to say, this is a relaxing set not just for kids, but for adults too. (I'm watching it right now, and even I want to curl up on the couch and fall asleep!) It's a great wind-me-down tool for parents who would like to find some soothing images and music to help their young ones fall asleep. If BabyFirst made a second volume, I'd buy it in a heartbeat!",1412467200,,605,4.315789473684211
