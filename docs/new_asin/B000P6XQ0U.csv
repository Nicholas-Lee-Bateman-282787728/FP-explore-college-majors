I have two girls, ages 3 and 7, and they can dance with Rochelle easily for an hour or more. She gives the girls' imaginations a work out, and helps them develop their listening ears (sensitivity to music and what emotions it invokes), while teaching them basic ballet movements.

The only caution I have about this product is that Rochelle wears a LOT of makeup (especially considering her young age), though I explained to my girls that this is stage make up and necessary so viewers who sit far away can still see her expressions.

Rochelle does a fine job with both of her dvds, and most families will find that their little ballerinas' dreams will come true when they have a chance to dance with her.",1301270400,,908,4.598765432098766

My daughter loves them.  Rochelle is very engaging and children love her!  And, she encourages them to dance and use their imaginations!

Great Christmas gift idea!",1192838400,2,235,5.444444444444445
