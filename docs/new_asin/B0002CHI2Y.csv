2077276,5,B0002CHI2Y,"If you're a fan of fantasy, old movies, or a history buff, I highly recommend this film. Though produced during the later days of the Nazi empire as a showcase film to rival Technicolor, the movie contains no politics. Given the times, the special effects were amazing. The DVD is presented in its native German, with English subtitles.

Hans Albers is excellent as the Baron, who is both sophisticated and philosophical, traveling through history to a bittersweet end.

There is some minor nudity (topless) so I'd probably not recommend this for kids under 15.

The DVD contains some very interesting extras that discuss the Ufa Studio, Agfa Color, history of the Munchhausen story, production during WW II, and technical restoration of the movie.",1178409600,8,748,5.065040650406504
2077277,5,B0002CHI2Y,"I saw this movie when I was about 11 or 12 years old, in occupied Belgium. I only saw it once but I was so enthralled with the story, images remained in my mind for over 60 years.  Hans Albers was perfect..those eyes.  I remember his flight riding a canon ball but especially the scene where he shot the two remaining ties of the air balloon simultaneously.  WOW!  I have been looking for this movie for years, but it was never available, until now.  I must say that I enjoyed it as much as when I was a little girl.  The special effects are absolutely awesome. Amazing what one can achieve without ""computer generated"". The costumes are fabulous, and so is the scenery.

I never knew it was Joseph Goebbels pet project, and he doesn't bother me. It is not about the Nazi war machine. The movie is a fantasy from a children's book. The only thing I noticed this time was the costumes  and head gear for the sultan/emir etc were totally ridiculous, made everyone look grotesque (which was probably done just for the reason that they were : Untermenschen), and the village fair in St. Petersburg was full of drunken Russians, kicking women, tearing the place apart. So much for Nazi subtlety.

For a movie salvaged from almost total destruction, they did a fantastic job, it took a long time , but it's worth it.  Enjoy the storyline, the actors, the costumes, the glorious Agfacolour, and Hans Albers' mesmerizing performance.  Take the time to watch the introduction by the Director of the Murnau Foundation and all the other extras.  The german dialogue was a little hard to follow, but there are subtitles.",1167782400,43,1608,4.623239436619718
2077278,5,B0002CHI2Y,"Finally somebody at least mentions the weird contradiction on this movie, where UFA-Filmex for their celebration production asked Erich Kastner to write the script. Kastner was an author forbidden by the Nazis. His books, with many others', had been burned in a medieval fashion long since. And Goebbels is supposed to have gone along with this? No way.

The script did not merely ""poke fun"" at the Nazis expense... it made the whole 1000-year Reich concept totally ridiculous. All this is very weird and smacks of intricate behind-the-UFA-scenes plots. 'Interesting' doesn't cover it. Haven't seen it yet (just read the script some 40 years ago), but it looks good to me!

By the way, ""up their"" is spelt ""up there"". No wonder Ed McBain, since very recently no longer with us, wondered how Amazon figured they'd sell books with this sort of stupid reviews. I had to admit I'm over 13 years old. Reminds you of Ben Hecht's Concerning a Woman of Sin. Read those reviews for fun and laughter, but never mind them. Except this one.

2077279,4,B0002CHI2Y,"This was meant to be a spectacular offering celebrating the 25th anniversary of the great UFA German film studios. Parts of it are impressive - extravagant set pieces that could match anything that Hollywood was doing at the time. Parts of it drag. It is definitely worth seeing if you love historically interesting films or the UFA product. There is nothing in it even hinting at the vast Nazi machinery backing it (Joseph Goebbels had his hand in most of the production). It is a light, well budgeted, sometimes amusing fantasy. The script has its moments but doesn't sustain interest for the length of the film. Best sections: the dinner party, Venice, the trip to the moon, the early agfacolor color film technique (which was quite good). One of the best WWII UFA films.

2077281,5,B0002CHI2Y,"MADE when 'You know Who' ran the country [sounds like a line from 'Wicked...'] this beautifully restored little gem of a fantasy is FINALLY forgiven and available on an extraordinary DVD.

SO many fascinating extras are included not about only this vehicles resporation but others too - thanks to UFA and the WF MAURAU Institute.

There's even quite a good cartoon - 'Winter Journey'  preceding the feature.

MORE OR LESS A FAUSTIAN TALE, we follow the Baron through the ages, from Cathy [Catherine] the Great ~ Brigitte Horney {stunning - literal}, to the topless - for 1943 - harem girls, etc - all very very tasteful.

I especially find the opening reels MASTERFUL - the deception about time ....

SAD history about this flic - the anonymous Jewish artists who also worked and contributed to this gem ... and here it is.  The costumes are quite memorable, as is the superb score and color by AGFA.

There's also a great deal of melahcholy about the movie -or story - as immortality strikes us - we watch the loved ones fade away.

PLOTLINE [carbon of the Gilliam version - but more pathos here].

HANS ALBERTS [especially those pale green eyes] ignite the screen!

A MUST FOR THE SERIOUS AND NOT TOO SERIOUS COLLECTOR .... and really fit for all.

BRAVO KINO - keep 'em coming!",1090713600,31,1280,4.665178571428571
2077282,5,B0002CHI2Y,"For years I have been familiar with the dog-eared 1978 reissue version of Munchhausen,apparently pieced together from different 16mm prints, from annual showings at Harvard's Carpenter Center, but this new DVD is a revelation. It almost looks new. The color is clear instead of blotchy, the image is clean instead of liney, and scenes that I had read about but not seen are now back in the film. The '78 edit had some crude jump cuts, which are smoothed over and repaired in this version,taken from an original negative that was perhaps only found some time after the previous restoration had been completed. The picture quality is amazing,the reds particularly vivid. Thanks to the F.W. Murnau foundation we can finally see what Munchhausen looked like in 1943, or at least a close approxamation. Contrary to reports, Munchhausen HAS been released on video in the U.S. previously, in a disappointing transfer [probably a 16mm print copied through a film chain]by an outfit called 'Video City'in the early 80's. But a few things about Kino's liner notes:Erich Kastner was a banned author, but he was not Jewish. Kino stresses that Munchhausen was not classified 'politically valuable'but that didn't matter very much:many films otherwise approved were not, and Munchhausen played right up to the German surrender. The bonus animation is also quite impressive, also with brilliantly preserved color. Other bonus clips will give you a glimpse of Nazi-era[and after]diva Marika Rokk, who just died at 90.",1090627200,52,1501,5.181069958847736

2077337,5,B0002CHI2Y,"For the 25th anniversary of Germany's UFA Studios, the company produced a lavish, fantasy spectacle in answer to similar imaginative fare like THE WIZARD OF OZ (1939), and THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (1940). MUNCHHAUSEN, released in 1943, tells the tale of the legendary 18th century baron (Hans Albers) who was granted eternal youth while his exploits take him from Germany, Russia, Turkey, Italy, and ultimately to the moon.

Directed by Josef von Baky, MUNCHHAUSEN is a sumptuous, inventive feast for the eyes, and a truly unique fairy tale for grown-ups; there is even a sequence with topless harem girls. Photographed in the lush, warm pastel tones of the Agfacolor process, the film evokes a distinctly storybook aesthetic unlike anything else made at the time. The intricacy of its production design is in everything from the luxurious costumes to the grandiose sets. The special effects are clever and well executed. The entire film contains a charming whimsicality that disguises a more poignant theme - that of human mortality, markedly Faustian in spirit.

Some viewers today cannot look at MUNCHHAUSEN without attatching political significance to it, since it was made in Nazi Germany. There exists a purposeful need to put a damper on any German films made in the '40's, regardless of their nature. The fact is, MUNCHHAUSEN contains no wartime propaganda whatsoever - unless, of course, one chooses to believe it does. It was made purely to serve as an escape from the harsh realities engulfing audiences of the day. Nazi critics didn't consider it politically valid, but did acknowledge it as an artistic triumph. And that is what 21st century audiences should focus on: the film's cinematic merits, not the political ideology of the time.

Kino's edition of MUNCHHAUSEN has been gloriously restored in all its rich splendor - both visually and audibly. The special features are generous as well: a making of documentary; the original trailer; an animated short from 1944; a photo gallery; restoration examples; an excerpt from the Agfacolor DIE FLEDERMAUS (1944); and a gallery of MUNCHHAUSEN pop-culture imagery.

My highest recommendation.",1394150400,,2148,5.217391304347826

Propaganda Minister Goebbels commissioned the production of this movie simply to showcase the advances in German cinema.  In this respect, the film did well.  The acting, writing, costuming, and set design were all first-rate.  In fact, I would say that the film was ahead of its time.

2077354,4,B0002CHI2Y,"Made in Germany in 1943, while WWII was still being fought, Munchausen is a retelling of the tall tales of Baron von Munchausen, a larger-than-life man whose exploits seem impossible. In a tradition like that of Paul Bunyan and Gulliver, Munchausen has an extensive love life (Catherine the Great was one of his women), military prowess (he rides a cannonball into a Turk fortress) and travels to the moon in a balloon. There are all sorts of gags in this film, like it being so cold in Russia that the notes froze in a horn and a wardrobe catching rabies from a coat bitten by a mad dog. The Propaganda Ministry put a lot of resources in this film, especially in getting the color processing done, and it is pretty impressive. The costumes alone must have required considerable effort. Most of the special effects were very good, given the limits of technology at the time.

Munchausen is definitely worth looking into if you've never seen this kind of film before.",1375833600,4,966,4.682352941176471
2077355,4,B0002CHI2Y,"I first saw Mnchhausen in my native Romania as a child during the war (I mean WWII) and the scene of the barons landing on the moon and having a conversation with the head, lying on the ground, of a woman who left the rest of her body in her lunar home, made such a powerful impression on me that to this day I remember it in all its funny details. It was also the first movie in color I had ever seen; yes, those were the days when movies, as a rule, were in black and white.

Revisiting the movie now, as a euphemistically labeled senior citizen, I was surprised that it holds up quite well. It amuses, it surprises, it is well acted, the dialog is clever, written after all by the famous novelist Erich Kstner under a pseudonym to cover up the fact that the Nazis saw themselves forced to employ him after burning his books.

There is something quite disturbing in hindsight about this movie. Why was it made? It was released in the year between the  battle of Stalingrad and the Allied Normandy invasion the two events that were to seal Germanys fate. Was it an attempt to sustain both at home and abroad the far-fetched illusion that the war was going so well that all the German people cared about was laughing at the Baron Mnchhausens lies? Or was it an attempt at showing that Babelsberg could produce a grand spectacle just as well as Hollywood? And if a spectacle was being offered, why, in a country in which mass murder and deception were the order of the day, was even the hero to be a liar?

I am asking these questions because much in this movie is disturbing for reasons related to them. Take the Baron himself, played in this movie by Hans Albers, the greatest star, the Clark Gable of German movies in those years, yet by the time of this movie a man in his fifties pretending to be irresistible to females. It is as if MGM had cast an aging Adolphe Menjou as Rhett Butler in ""Gone With the Wind."" Now Albers is a fine actor, but to enjoy the movie you definitely have to suspend disbelief and pretend that the aging actor riding the cannonball is not bothered by arthritic pain.

The sets look more like cheap nouveau riche furnishings and the costumes are cut from wartime stock. Ilse Werner, as Princess Isabella dEste, is as beautiful as ever, and as Count Cagliostro we get to see Ferdinand Marian, the actor who just a few years earlier had disgraced himself by playing the lead in ""Jud Sss,"" the most disgusting anti-Semitic propaganda film ever made, a fact that ultimately led Marian to alcoholism and a DUI death at wars end, considered a suicide by many.

Now, one can say, lets just watch the film for what it is, and not in its historic context. But then, Marians acting of Cagliostro, a swindler, is crafted with the same mannerisms he used in creating the Jew Sss. In short, the undeniable artistic qualities of this movie are infected with the severe moral deficiencies of its makers, and this surprisingly renders the movie more interesting than it has any right of being. This is what disturbs me.",1365897600,2,3033,4.455855855855856
2077356,4,B0002CHI2Y,"It it rare to find early German movies, let alone one made in the middle of the second World War.
The copy of the film that is a digital ""print"" compiled from the surviving prints and negatives of the film.
This restoration project apparently was done by the F.W. Murnau Foundation, which has the stewardship of the UFA film library.
The story of Munchhausen is one that does not fit into a single genre, fantasy, science fiction, romance, comedy, tragedy, satire, morality play, tall tales.
To describe what the movie is like, I'd say it  is a combination of themes and elements from ""Highlander"" and ""The Wizard of Oz.,"" but set in Eighteenth Century Europe
Spoiler alert: The Baron has been given eternal youth for as long as he wants it you see.

2077357,4,B0002CHI2Y,"Folks, I find this film interesting to compare with Disney's Song of the South, which was made 3 years later. Both deal with the cherished folklore of their respective countries (the Baron Munchausen tales of Germany and the Uncle Remus/Brer Rabbit stories of America) and both are loads of fun until you look deeply and consider some historical and political implications (slavery and sharecropping in SOTS and the Holocaust in this film).

Basically, this film appears to be set at first in the 1700s until a clever trick in the plot (which I will not give here) makes you realize that this is really contemporary Deutschland. Then, we have a supposed descendant of the classic German tale spinner and loveable rouge Baron Von Munchausen tell some really entertaining yarns to a young man and his fiance about his wild adventures in Europe and Asia in the 1700s (as well as the moon in a rather eerie segment).

The film is filled with rip-roaring adventure and enjoyable special effects. There is also a delightful sense of humor that does not really get lost in the translation and a lot of not too subtle ribald sex humor (especially in the scenes where our man gets in a tryst with Catherine the Great and he is quite an ogler of female mammary organs) that would have never been shown in a mainstream American theater at the time. However, the much discussed topless scene is no big deal (a group of harem girls bathing in a pool for no more than 2 minutes) and this film would probably get a PG 13 by modern standards.

The slap happy fun continues up to the moon sequence. From there up to the end, things get somber up to the film's conclusion, where for reasons I will not spoil here, we get into rather serious meditations of mortality up to the surprise ending. After over two hours of being solidly amused and entertained by the wily Baron's adventures, the film ends with you really pondering over the true message of this tale. What is that message? see it and find out.

Unfortuantely, history buffs are aware of the Nazi connections of this film. As has been discussed in other reviews and in a documentary on the DVD, Adolf's propaganda chief Joseph Goebbles used this film as a distraction for the German public from the failures of their regime. However, you would not know this from viewing the film as there is no apparent nazi propaganda in the story. In either case, knowledge of this does put a slight damper on things (just as knowledge of the true nature of race relations at the time affects one's perception in ""Song of the South"").

On the whole, since I'm a big folklore fan, this film has gotten me interested in the Baron Munchausen saga and I will soon get the original book of Baron Munchausen tales and the 1989 version with Eric Idle.",1330300800,2,2772,4.603238866396761

2077359,5,B0002CHI2Y,"Made in Germany, circa 1943 ""Munchausen"" starring Hans Albers is a superb interpretation of Raspe's stories, based on a German noble of the eighteenth century who took great pleasure in telling tall tales.

And here we have several layers.  On the surface, this is a movie that made great use of the technology of the day and the locations available to Germans at the height of World War II.  Beautiful costumes and magnificent settings (especially Venice) support lively action, very compentent acting, and a great story.  The story is that of Hieronymous Baron Munchausen, an adventurer, rogue, officer in the German and Russian armies, lover, and all around charming scoundrel.  He falls into the bed of Catherine the Great, Tsarina of Russia, flies on a cannon ball, travels to the moon, finds himself in the serigalio of the Sultan of Turkey, and romances his way across Europe.

The truth of Freiherr Munchausen is only slightly less exciting.  He was a Prussian noble and really served in the Russian and German armies, travelled all over Europe, and generally lived life to its fullest.  Certainly the kind of guy you'd want at a party, but not the sort of guy you'd trust around your wife or daughter.  And telling the sort of story that inspired this movie was a great pleasure for him.

And while made in Germany in 1943, there is no obvious propaganda.  I didn't observe any, and it certainly didn't impact the plot.  It is important to note that the lead actor's lover fled German for Switzerland in the 1930's, and they were reunited after the war.  Albers is unlikely to have had any loyalty to the regime at the time of production.

A quick note; if you are sensitive to displays of the female form or romantic inuendo, this one may not be for you.  To my sensibilities, the casual attire and discussions of intimate adventure were tastefully handled.

A great movie from some of the best classical stories.

As for the movie itself, I love it, not the best German movie in the mid-40s story-wise, but the colour, scale of production ,etc, are all first rate. I must admit that with these films, I often wonder how many of the cast and crew were still alive in 1950, how many survived Germany's post war reconstruction?",1436486400,,550,4.392156862745098

8026317,5,B0002CHI2Y,"I have to admit - I was flip flopping on whether or not to invest the time to watch this movie............but I am SO happy I did!  So, the only 'Munchausen' I know is the 'Baron Munchausen' movie from the '80s.  I never saw that one but I understood the general story.  I was totally ignorant to the fact that this is apparently an old German fable.  From my perspective, not only was the story interesting but I still can't get over the difference in German cinema versus American cinema circa WWII!  I had heard from my elders that at that time Europe was far more socially advanced than we were - and I think this film proves it.  I think, even now, this movie would probably herald a big fat R rating here in the states.  If you're on the fence about buying or watching this flick - jump in with both feet!  Enjoy your pretzels and beer!",1430092800,4,842,4.251572327044025
