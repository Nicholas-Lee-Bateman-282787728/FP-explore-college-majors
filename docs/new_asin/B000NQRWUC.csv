With his techniques under my belt and the knowledge I learned to help me develope my own style I'm sure I will find many freelance jobs in the Entertainment Industry plus I am starting a Post Production House soon with other partners so I consider myself lucky I found these dvd's now.
After watching the dvd for only a few chapters, for almost an hour I immediately went on amazon and searched for the rest, I couldn't wait I mean I had to wait until I found them affordable but in any case I wanted them just the same! So to sum it all up, ""Digital Sets 1"" is definitely worth buying, I would probably even spend the full retail price of ""what is it?"" $69 each yeah! they are that good. Definitely worth watching!",1211673600,3,1015,4.291666666666667
