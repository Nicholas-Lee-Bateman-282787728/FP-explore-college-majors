4189743,3,B003SWFLPG,"Title says it all.  If you really enjoyed Paranormal Activity and watch Paranormal State then you will enjoy this.
The cast is a mash up of ok too horrid but they pass just enough.  There are the requisite cheap scares and the pacing keeps it moving without losing your interest.

This is the type of movie that girls would get for slumber party or make a cheap date night movie.  Don't go in expecting anything more than that.

No gore, pretty consistent swearing and a little bit of skin may make this a little much for anyone under 13.",1287100800,,538,4.393939393939394

Maybe SCARIER than' Paranormal Entity',Just because we recognize this ghost as pure evil.
Great group of ghost hunters who literally gave their last breath to entertain us.
Not a fan of poster,Could have used some clown ghost image ?
Need to google the real house that John Wayne Gacy did his thing in and see `Wassup?'.
All the doors and closets leading nowhere reminds one of ` Mystery Of The Winchester House' too.
Some of the ghost hunters were alot rounder and softer than Gacy was used to,Guess that's a cop-out to reality television ratings.",1285113600,,600,4.834951456310679

4189753,1,B003SWFLPG,I have seen some bad horror movies in my time. Some so bad they were funny. 8213: Gacy House is so bad it's not even funny!!

4189754,1,B003SWFLPG,"Camcorder or ""found footage"" films are inherently lazy, but they're cheap to make, so a lot of filmmakers are making them in the hopes that they will be the next Blair Witch or Paranormal Activity. 8213: Gacy House is one of these films and at first glance it looks like it's got everything it needs to be a winner. A serial killer, the paranormal, and a young good looking cast are usually the recipe for a very successful movie, but not here. I don't care much for these types of films to begin with, the acting is usually shitty and the constant movement of the camera makes me nauseous, but those aren't the only reasons to dislike 8213. The story makes no sense whatsoever and before making something like this, you'd think the director would have watched at least a couple episodes of Ghost Hunters. What kind of paranormal investigator goes ghost hunting with a half dozen people and then leaves the lights on!? Besides that huge flaw in the film, they're always saying they can feel something, with no evidence or hint that there's anything wrong, and when they do feel something, that's usually when nothing happens! The acting is awful, the cinematography is nauseating, the story is ridiculously stupid, and the special effects are complete garbage. The bottom line, 8213: Gacy House is a waste of a rental.",1361491200,2,1318,4.734782608695652

4189756,4,B003SWFLPG,"Now, I admit, I adore B movies, especially the haunted house, spooky kind.  When you enjoy such things, you take into account that they aren't going to be the greatest when it comes to things like acting, special effects and such.  This was one of the better ones out there.  It's in the genre with movies like the Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity and such but with the original premise that a paranormal investigative team was going to spend the night and investigate the house that was built on the grounds where John Wayne Gacy (serial killer) had lived and killed his victims.  This was fairly original when it comes to movies of this kind.  There were some things off that I noticed that were akin to glaring errors (such as the house they stayed in wasn't the standard ranch style build during that era but something from the 50's or earlier and a two story) and that there was a crawl space that was more akin to a basement but, overall, this was good.  There was, of course, some bad acting and over dramatics (in a bad way) but it was good.  Don't expect much as the way of a seriously dramatic script or superb special effects but it's good for a couple of jumps here and there and worth the money.",1321574400,5,1208,4.414414414414415
4189757,3,B003SWFLPG,"This movie is okay for a low budget film. It has some hot/sultty girls for ghost hunters. It's 2 out of 3 star movie. I give it that rating because the girls do start showing nudity for people.

Minor spoiler:

I kind like how, the ghost was supposed to be a guy that molested young boys and then killed them. Well, I wasn't expecting this, but in the movie there is a young guy in the group of ghost hunters. He actually dare the ghost to get him and said ""if he is here, I'm a young boy and I know that's what you like"". Well, at the end of the movie, you see him being held up and his pants just come ripping off!!! Then, he is dragged to somewhere to the back of house by his legs. It looked really funny because he is on his belly and he is screaming for help, while his hands are on the ground forward and his legs are being dragged up backwards. This really seemed like some kind of ghost man prison raped scene to me. lol

Afterwards, the ghost seemed to kill the man and other ghost hunters. But, one person lived, but is missing. We don't know where that person is now. Then, the movie just ends.

I loved the comedy at the end. So, I wasn't expecting that at all.",1317600000,,1174,4.047413793103448

4189760,2,B003SWFLPG,"A paranormal investigation at the site of John Wayne Gacy's house of death?  Sign me up for that.  I don't care how cheap and problematic the story is - I'm a total sucker for films like this.  And with The Asylum hosting this shindig, I couldn't wait to fire this DVD up, sit back, and just enjoy myself.  There really is no mystery to 8213: Gacy House, though, as this is just another film constructed on the Paranormal Activity model (which The Asylum exploited to great effect, in my opinion, with Paranormal Entity).  We're told right off the bat that all of the paranormal investigators died during the night of their big investigation and that this film is made up of the footage they took during that fateful night (although the film and the box cover can't agree on whether it happened in 2004 or 2006).  The suspense comes in learning when and how each one died - that's the idea, anyway.  It's a great - albeit less than original - premise, but the film itself turns out to be fraught with problems.

The house itself is a big issue.  For starters, it's not the John Wayne Gacy house because his house was destroyed following Gacy's arrest and conviction.  The introduction of this movie acknowledges this fact and tells us that another house was built on that lot - a house that has now been abandoned.  Unfortunately, none of the actors or script writers in the film seemed to get that memo, as they - on more than one occasion - talk about how fuses blow or weird sounds are heard in ""an old house"" like the one they are investigating.  And get this - this new house just so happens to have a sizable crawlspace underneath it, and that area is a prime focus of the paranormal investigation.  My theory is that the filmmakers completed filming and then - at the last minute - discovered that the original John Wayne Gacy house no longer exists; in order to cover up for this huge blunder, they threw that bit about a newly constructed house into the introduction (in reality, no house has ever been built on the lot where Gacy's house stood).

Another big problem with this film is the acting.  It's not very good.  It is, however, increasingly annoying.  Once weird things really begin happening, we're forced to endure one group shouting match after another between those who want to get the hell out of there and the manic director who insists on staying, sure that he'll get the proof that will catapult him into fame among paranormal circles.  The young male camera tech is the worst of the lot, constantly launching into obscene tirades over the merest hint of actual paranormal activity.  To make matters worse, all of the characters somehow make the time in the middle of all their hectic scurrying to and fro, to visit a little testimonial room and talk about their feelings.

The biggest problem with this movie is the fact that it just isn't scary or suspenseful.  A lot of the special effects are hackneyed at best - a door swinging closed, lights going out, etc.  There are a few good moments - such as one investigator suddenly being slammed against a door - but these are too few and far between.  As for the ultimate payoff, prepare to be disappointed - honestly, it plays better in the trailer than it does in the full movie.  I hate to say that John Wayne Gacy deserved better, seeing as he was a sick and perverted monster, but this film really doesn't do justice to his dark legacy of evil.",1302393600,3,3423,4.528455284552845
4189761,1,B003SWFLPG,"This review contains spoilers.  However, reading this review will save you the time and money that I spent watching this rather pedestrian movie.

""8213: Gacy House"" is a movie similar to ""Blair Witch Project"".  Unfortunately, it falls far short of being a good horror movie.  The best action is in the trailer.  Most of the movie plods along with little tension or suspense.  When Gacy finally appears on film, he is not frightening; an ""infrared"" person is not much of a payoff.

This movie has some genuinely creepy bits.  Unfortunately, only two are memorable:

(1) During a seance: a teenage boy's shirt is offered to the spirit of Gacy.  Ummm . . . that just made me feel dirty.
(2) While being attacked by Gacy's spirit: a male character has his pants removed by the spirit of Gacy.  The implications are obvious and disturbing.

The movie would have been more frightening (though more predictable) by the use of more ghostly sounds and images.  Out-of-place figures captured on tape would also have added some suspense and creepiness to the movie.

The ""documentary"" that accompanies the feature is entertaining and tells how the movie was allegedly made.  While not plausible (no one removed the movie footage from the house), it adds another layer to the movie.  It is more entertaining than the movie it documents.

My advice is to buy or rent another movie.  ""8213: Gacy House"" is not innovative, not frightening, and not engaging.  Asylum's own ""Monster"" is a monster movie in a similar vein --- it mimics the docu-monster-y ""Cloverfield"".  Rent that if you like ""found footage"" movies.",1302048000,3,1599,4.895522388059701
4189762,1,B003SWFLPG,"This (and I say it with all I can muster)""Movie"" is possibly the worst movie I've seen in the past 25 years. It was all based on a lie. I grew up in the town next to Des Plaines/Norwood Park, IL. Where John Wayne Gacy Lived and burried his victims. I remember when the crime happened and watching the news every night for the new body count. The house was demolished at the end of the digging process and a patch of grass eventually covered his lot.  There was NEVER A SECOND HOUSE BUILT. That's where the story becomes incredibly stupid. This movie is laughable. They want you to think it's the old house but remind the viewers every few minutes that it's a new house. This movie was not creepy at all.

4189763,1,B003SWFLPG,"I don't know how anyone could possibly like 8213: Gacy House, but some people do. I, on the other hand, found it be extremely boring and badly acted, not to mentioned bloodless. It's basically trying to cash in on the success of The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity, which I honestly wasn't a fan of either of those. But I wanted to see 8213: Gacy House because I am fascinated with William H. Gacy, and I had just seen the interesting Dear Mr. Gacy. But this movie is just a silly joke. ""Gacy"" doesn't even appear until toward the end of the movie, a movie which doesn't contain anything scary, awesome, or cool. For a better movie about Gacy, check out the aforementioned Dear Mr. Gacy or even Gacy. And for a better haunted house flick, check out The House On Haunted Hill or Thirteen Ghosts.

I grew up in a neighborhood near Des Plaines Illinois and remember when this event occurred as a child.  Most found footage movies have slow starts and nothing really happens until the end of the movie, but this movie had things happening right after the crew arrived on scene.

It's supposed to break it and bad things or spirirts can get out...SIGH THEN they didn't properly colse the circle because THEY DIDN'T CLOSE IT AT ALL!! >_<
The angles they have on some of the camaras are HORRIBLE! Like in the kitchen? They just film he counter? WHY NOT THE WHOLE KITCHEN?!
Why are they investigating with the lights on? EVERYONE knows you don't investigate with them ON. If the people that were in there after they sold the house and the investigators said ""there is nothing in the house"" THEN WHY ARE THERE THINGS IN THE HOUSE?!? The kitchen, bedrooms and the such? How is there pictures that the thing keeps throwing around, and the beds and stuff come from?
Now the characters: The main guy who thinks that EVERYTHING is a sign of a ghost. Then he gets mad when one doesn't show up for like 10 minutes!! Mad when he doesn't get a response from anything! Then the stupid psychic chick who is scared of everything and doesn't want to stay. Why did she even come if she just wants to leave? She goes WAY overboard and just seems really like an airhead and like she knows nothing about ANYTHING! WAIT.. I thought Loki was the god of Mischief... WHY would you want to bring him there?

8404751,2,B003SWFLPG,"I remember the Gacy case only from watching Brian Dennehy play the sadistic serial killer in the television movie. This film version is about a group of people who spend a night on the property at the old Gacy house. According to the movie, there was a second house built on the original location and six murdered bodies were found there in an abandoned house long after Gacy was executed. The house is abandoned but it doesn't look it.

This movie is a takeoff on the ghost hunters episodes and documentaries where parapsychologists and ghost enthusiasts visit haunted locations. The original Gacy house was torn down shortly after the bodies were found in the basement and crawlspace. I don't know if the cast are actually actors or just real people in for an adventure.

I would have rather seen more about the history of the crimes and the location's history. Since this film is largely fictional, I wouldn't have bought it. It's not that entertaining but Gacy's ghost still lingers in society. There is a fascination with Gacy and his crimes. He was an evil sadistic killer. If the movie was based on an actual night on the location, I would have probably enjoyed it more. I don't know anything about the cast of characters.

The DVD states that it has original crime scene footage from the Des Plaines police department but it wasn't new or shocking to me. I wished the film would not have stated facts and mixed it with fiction. At least, please tell the viewers that this is a fictional adventure. What is true or isn't? is unanswered.

If the premise was real, I would have taken an interest in it. Sadly according to one reviewer from the area, there was never a second home built on the original location and there were never six murdered bodies found in the second home. The Gacy home was demolished and left untouched by builders perhaps wise to keep the location as a memorial to the young men and boys who were tortured savagely and killed by a deranged serial killer I hope to never see another John Wayne Gacy in my lifetime.
