8251702,5,B0013L7KCQ,"As always this Thunderbirds tape was worth the price. It was loaded with excitement to the end. It's good fun for all ages. You don't have to be afraid of this tape being filled with questionable language and scenes. Buy it while it is still availabe and sit back and hang on for a well produced video.
Pop some corn and heat up the tea because this video adventure will keep you inthralled to the very end. I've noticed that the prices on this video are going up. Grab it on Amazon while you can.",1357603200,,497,4.242105263157895
