1196382,4,B000006QEJ,as with all tapes by biography is tells about Bundy. All Bio shows are good. if you are into true crime do buy this dvd.,1255737600,,120,3.84
1196383,3,B000006QEJ,"Good video, but more sanitized for TV.  It wasn't accurate on certain behaviors he exhibited in my opinion.  But a good video to get you up to speed on this notorious criminal quickly.",1228262400,2,184,4.545454545454546
1196384,5,B000006QEJ,"A good biography of Ted Bundy.  It's very scary that someone can look and act so normal and have this horrible, murderous, hidden other side. Not all serial killers look like monsters.  That's what's so scary. Worth buying especially for people majoring in criminal justice.",1220918400,4,274,5.066666666666666
1196385,4,B000006QEJ,"I am 43 years old and from the time I was 5, my mother and I shared a common interest. We love ture crime. This docmentary sheds light on how Bundy may have became a sociopath. I liked Dr. Park Dietz explations of Bundy's behavior. He was freindly and convsational not clinical at all. this DVD have us a real look at Bundy.",1188172800,4,324,4.158730158730159
1196386,5,B000006QEJ,"Ted Bundy got what he wanted, everyone knows who he was and what he did and in some respects I know that I am one of many keeping this ""Things"" story still alive and I sometimes wonder if ""WE"" are his last victims. Even though this is an gripping bio on Ted and we see him as he really was, it shows the hold he has over us all. Ted's story is one of great sadness,loss, and missed chances. As one author has stated, ""In the end of Ted's story everyone loses, no one wins except Ted who got his wish to be remembered as a famous man"". Well he got it and we still know little about him because he was skilled at hiding, even from himself.",1185840000,8,637,3.984375
1196387,3,B000006QEJ,"I was a bit disappointed in this biography, especially after reading the other reviews. I had expected a biography, starring Ted Bundy, to focus primarily on clips of him. Instead, the biogrpahy focused on the views of others, with only small clips of Bundy going to and from court, walking around in the courtroom and being interviewed. For the most part, his movements are accompanied only by a voice-over. The reviews of this DVD led me to believe that his rage was captured on film, as it was during his trial in Florida,  but there is only a still photograph of him with his mouth open like he's yelling. I would not recommend this biography to anyone who has read about Ted Bundy because it won't add much to what he/she already knows.",1185321600,27,741,4.571428571428571
1196388,5,B000006QEJ,"I'm going to save myself the work of translating, and say,
I agree with Marcelo Figueredo and all others who sad
it definitely is worth the money and very informative,

Anyone who can recommend others like these, let me ;)",1183161600,,222,4.55
1196389,4,B000006QEJ,"I always wonder how Ted Bundy was really like, well I first only red about him and seeying this documentary on him finnally make me see what Ted Bundy behaviors, voice and look were like.  He seem really normal, the way he speak was professional, he do have a cameleon look, sometime he look so different and you think this is Bundy?  A very weird part in this documentary is when he asked Carol Boone to married him, he asked her in the middle of his court trial!  If you want to know how Bundy really his buy or rent this tape but of course you won't know the real Bundy, he never really show his true self.",1047945600,6,609,4.1440677966101696

7904961,5,B000006QEJ,"I would just like to say that ted bundy was a evil monster and will not be missed. He should roast in hell with saddam hussein, adolf hitler and osama bin laden. Ted may be remembered but it's a dam shame that his victims won't be remembered, i would've loved to be the one to throw the switch on his worthless ass and send him straight to hell.",1484524800,,345,4.088235294117647

7904967,3,B000006QEJ,"This Biography presentation of Ted Bundy provides a good overview of his early life, his crimes, and his ultimate conviction.  It has lots of still photos and interviews with people he knew.  There are also some re-enactments of various events that took place in the course of his crimes.

One interviewee is Ann Rule, who did volunteer work alongside Ted Bundy in the 1970s, and later wrote the blockbuster true-crime book 'The Stranger Beside Me'.  They also interview others who knew Bundy and thought he was a promising and intelligent young man, but it was all a facade.

On the downside the presentation glosses over his victims and does not mention even half of them.  There are some chilling details with some of these cases and those were barely mentioned.  Also, the re-enactments were mediocre at best.  While I recommend the DVD it could have provided more details instead  of the re-enactments which added little to the documentary.",1369699200,,945,4.930379746835443
7904968,5,B000006QEJ,After viewing this I didn't find out anything new about Ted bundy but I didn't see anything missing either. This is a great way to learn about the killer from beginning to end if you're into this sort of thing. And unless you want to wait for an airing on the bio channel this is a must buy.,1279497600,,291,4.0344827586206895
