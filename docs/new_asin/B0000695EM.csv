1731184,5,B0000695EM,"LOVE IT!!!  I bought this video for my daughter for her 4th birthday.  She has played it almost every day for the past six months, especially when she has a ""play date.""  We, yes I participate too, enjoy the creative dance and fitness in the video.  I have also bought the Move N Groove video for my sister who is Kindergarten teacher in Baltimore and she uses it once a week in her curriculum.  It is a ""must have"" for every 2+ year old!",1073433600,2,438,4.166666666666667
1731185,5,B0000695EM,"This video is a wonderful combination of practicing specific movements and free dancing. Deborah Damast and Sara Lavan bring so much energy, and the kids on the tape are clearly having a blast. The tape is incredibly inviting, making it a lot of fun for parents and kids to dance along with together. I can't wait for the next volume!",1045699200,10,334,4.583333333333333

1731188,5,B0000695EM,"My kids enjoy this dvd. We have workout time in our house. We ""play"" this one and then I can have my workout time. It is fun. It is energetic. We like the freeze game a lot. And stretching is great too!",1460419200,,202,3.8333333333333335
1731189,4,B0000695EM,Cute video for toddlers. I think some two year olds might not grasp all moves yet but mine seemed to just do her own thing once she could figure out some moves they were showing her. A great excessive alternative when you can't go outside and play. The dancing part at the end kind drags on a bit but I like that it's free style. Would recommend for winter excercise for toddlers.,1454889600,,380,4.291666666666667
1731190,1,B0000695EM,This stinks! My two year old hated it. It is so boring. No fun music to move and dance too either. The picture quality is awful as well. It's more like a kiddie work out video. Boring.,1452902400,,184,4.0
1731191,5,B0000695EM,Fun,1452038400,,3,3.0
1731192,1,B0000695EM,"Trying to find a ""dance music"" video for my one year old grandson. He adores music and will stop what he is doing when he hears something that speaks to him....with the most adorable moves.
I read reviews on several products. This one seemed to be a good choice based on reviews.
Unfortunately, it was not. Neither he nor my other grandchild were the least bit interested in the slow paced, blan, and down right boring video.",1450915200,,425,4.532467532467533
1731193,5,B0000695EM,My students love this video during indoor exercise time.  The video goes at a pace my students can keep up with and it makes exercises fun.  Highly recommend,1450742400,,157,4.571428571428571
1731194,1,B0000695EM,Boring and my three year old was not the least intrigued.  Too much adult talk and too many description of what they are going to do before they do it.  Makes it difficult to keep the attention of children this young.,1448150400,,217,4.2682926829268295
1731195,3,B0000695EM,I expected something else. I thought it was going to show dance moves. The video is more of kids moving around doing different things; I imagine the idea is for kids to imitate and get moving. My 3 year old was not as interested. My 4 year old seemed to enjoy it for a longer period.,1447459200,,283,4.071428571428571
1731196,5,B0000695EM,"I bought this for my 3 year old Toddler, at the beginning she would watch the series and would not do much, after a couple of weeks she would watch it and do some of the exercises (and have me do them with her) and now after 10 months of having it she loves the entire routine and can actually do it twice in the same day! It may seem like a silly and simple video for us (adults) but its a fun way for them to exercise.",1444953600,,420,3.784090909090909
1731197,5,B0000695EM,"Actually gets my toddlers moving around. Great for rainy days, or if I just need a few minutes to get things done, but without my kids just vegging on TV.",1444348800,,154,4.166666666666667

1731199,5,B0000695EM,"My 3 year old son and I tried Mommy and me Yoga and that lasted all of about 5 minutes.  We did Move N Groove Kids together and he stayed and did the whole video with me!  I am so happy with it.  I purchased this video to not only get more exercise myself but to have him grow up knowing that you should work out to stay healthy and it could be fun.  It was fun, he especially loved the jump over me part, he was laughing the entire time.  They changed activities quickly enough to hold his attention.  I would recommend this video!",1439251200,,532,4.019047619047619
1731200,5,B0000695EM,"Perfect for preschool! I used this as a center exercise activity and it was perfect, although there was one section I skipped over.",1431648000,,131,4.739130434782608
1731201,5,B0000695EM,Fun video for preschoolers,1427932800,,26,5.75
1731202,5,B0000695EM,Such a fun little exercise dvd for kids! 2 year olds can do it with some help and older than that can do it independently for sure!,1426982400,,131,3.888888888888889
1731203,1,B0000695EM,I was disappointed to find out it was just exercise movements. I thought they would teach them dance moves.,1425945600,,107,4.684210526315789
1731204,3,B0000695EM,"What little there is to this video is good.  Both of my preschool grandchildren got up and danced to the music, but there is very little direction.  You just have to watch to see what they are doing and follow along.  This worked for a 1 year old and a 3 year old.  I was surprised that it was less than 1/2 hour in length for the price that I paid for it.  I'm sure the length was listed on the Amazon site and I just didn't notice.  The focus is on the children and not on the two instructors, and the children are adorable..",1425254400,3,527,3.9714285714285715
1731205,5,B0000695EM,My 4 year old loves exercising to this. I recommend this for a young child (2-5). Older children may benefit more from an exercise DVD with more structure. This one is somewhat erratic but that is what holds the young child's attention. I am happy with the purchase and my 4 yeard askes to exercise every day.,1424131200,,309,4.43859649122807
1731206,3,B0000695EM,"daughter wasn't really in to it as I thought, and I thought it was rather lame myself, no real exercises, just kids running around which we can do on our own",1423612800,,157,4.096774193548387

1731209,5,B0000695EM,My almost 3 yr old loves this DVD.  Just got it for her since she's gonna be home during my maternity leave and she's loving it!  She follows along so the video gets her moving while stuck inside during the winter with mommy and a newborn.  I read other reviews before buying if you looking for real dance instruction this isn't for you but if you are looking to just get your old active for a bit and to get some energy out this is perfect.,1421193600,2,441,4.104651162790698
1731210,4,B0000695EM,"My kids love this video, and I am happy to say the ladies are not annoying. I can listen to this video all day every day and I like that their is something not annoying to exercise to in the winter.",1416182400,,198,3.8536585365853657
1731211,1,B0000695EM,Kind of disappointed. I thought it was going to be a Dance DVD. It turned out to be more of an exercise video with music.,1416182400,,121,3.88
1731212,4,B0000695EM,"My two year old twins really get into this.  It is pretty structured and involves more movement activities than song and dance.  For example they want everyone to run, jump, leap, etc.",1415145600,,184,4.71875
1731213,5,B0000695EM,Great songs for kids,1412035200,,20,4.25
1731214,5,B0000695EM,"My 2-year-old granddaughter loves this DVD. She stays with me every Wednesday and always asks to do this in the morning. She knows some of the moves and is eager to learn other moves she has not mastered.  The program keeps her entertained and physically active. The length of the DVD seems to be what she needs.  She doesn't ask to turn it off before the end, nor does she ask to do it again after it has played. I also have a 5-year-old grandson. He is not at all interested in this DVD. Perhaps he feels it is too babyish for him or perhaps he just prefers to work on his Lego's",1409529600,,581,4.132743362831858
1731215,5,B0000695EM,"This is such a low-budget, lame video, but....  My daughter LOVES it!  And she does all the moves with it, which was the purpose of this purchase, to get her exercising",1405209600,,168,4.387096774193548
1731216,3,B0000695EM,This dvd was ok but not exciting to my daycare kids. Segments were too short.,1404691200,,77,4.2
1731217,5,B0000695EM,I bought this for an activity for my two toddler girls and I to do during the winter... they loved it!  the activities were fun and the ladies leading the activities enjoy children making it more enjoyable.  My 2 and 3 year old probably wouldn't do it on their own but they think its a blast with Dad.,1402272000,,301,4.172413793103448
1731218,5,B0000695EM,Move and Groove Kids is great. Its a little shorter than I would like for the money but my daughter LOVES it. She is 4 and wants to play it every day. We will be looking for more Move and Groove DVD's soon,1400544000,,205,3.7906976744186047
1731219,5,B0000695EM,"I read great reviews about this video before I ordered it, and I second those sentiments. It's easy for my son (20 months) to follow, it's catchy, and he really enjoys playing along. I treasure activities that can get the whole family involved while challenging coordination and incorporating additional physical activity. And it's just the right length - may be just a little too long for his present attention span, but I'm glad for some extra material he can grow into as he gets older and his attention span increases. It's also very easy to select a specific section of the video for those time we want to focus on a particular type of activity.",1400457600,,650,4.660869565217391
1731220,3,B0000695EM,I kind of liked it but it did not capture my granddaughters attention even though she loves to dance and move around.,1398902400,,117,4.363636363636363
1731221,4,B0000695EM,"My husband and I think it is really cheesy, but the kids love it.  make sure you get a scarf, at one point the kids run around with them flying through the air.  have it ready when you watch.",1391212800,,191,3.871794871794872
1731222,5,B0000695EM,I am a homeschool mom of a 6 and 8 year old. This is perfect for physical education time or just to get the wiggles out. I plan on doing more research to see if they have more videos out there.,1389225600,,193,3.731707317073171
1731223,1,B0000695EM,This dvd had so many good reviews I bought all 3 for my grandson who is special needs and has sensory issues and trouble with fine motor skills. He loves music so I thought this would help. It is so slow and boring it does not keep his attention at all and I could not even watch the whole dvds. I am very disappointed. Sesame Street Lets Dance is the one to buy. This one keeps him going and he try's to do the moves,1388966400,,417,3.9176470588235293
1731224,2,B0000695EM,"I guess it's my fault for not reading the ""details"".  This is a short video-25 minutes to be exact.  I expected more dance.  It's more of a warm up, skipping, galloping kind of video.  My 3 year old isn't too interested in this.",1388448000,,228,4.232558139534884
1731225,5,B0000695EM,"My two-year-old loves the Move 'N Groove Kids series. She likes all three videos, but her favorite is this one!

I used to be a dancer and dance educator, so I can say that what kids learn from the Move 'N Groove Kids videos is similar to what would be covered in a creative-movement or creative-dance class for pre-schoolers and younger elementary students. Deb knows what she's doing and the kids are learning much more from the movements than you would immediately assume.

This is our favorite of the three MNGKs videos. It's my daughter's favorite, and she knows it by memory. She follows along with the instructors and says ""Hi, I Sarah, I Deb"" as they introduce themselves. And I find her doing steps and rehearsing lines from the video throughout the day (when the video is not on). ""One leg, one leg, balance, whooooo!"" This video keeps her moving long after it's been turned off!

Move 'N Groove Kids have 3 videos: the original, MNGKs Go to the Park, and MNGKs Go to the Zoo. I prefer the original because it's presented like an actual class. The students on the video are actually taking a dance class, and the videography gets in between the kids as well as observes from the outskirts of the class. You can see the teachers demonstrating to the students, and see the students responding to the teacher. It is like being in the class yourself. I love that my two-year-old is (unbeknownst to her) learning how to function in a class environment while she was dancing along. This is an awesome bonus!

I highly recommend any of the videos in the Move 'N Groove Kids series, but this is our favorite!",1387065600,19,1610,4.579861111111111
1731229,2,B0000695EM,"I was hoping this would feature some actual dance moves, but it is just a videorecording of a kids' dance school with freeze dancing, a good deal of stretches while sitting in a circle, and running around. I didn't like it and it didn't make either of my kids (ages 3 and 6) dance.",1386633600,3,281,4.222222222222222
1731230,1,B0000695EM,The kids - who have great attention spans... followed through with it... but they found it boring and were not interested in doing it again. Bummer. I was hoping for something we could do together fro exercise and this was not it. It did not do anything physical for me and the kids were not interested...so... a bust.,1386547200,,318,4.5
1731231,5,B0000695EM,My nearly 6 year old still likes to jump around to this.  Hope they put out an updated one.  One feature that makes it interesting is that the presentation is like attending a fun jump and play class.  The backgrounds and effects are simple and they focus on modeling the behavior to the viewer.  My daughter likes to watch this when I'm busy and it keeps her active and entertained.,1384992000,,383,4.428571428571429
1731232,4,B0000695EM,"Not the best production quality, but our 4 year old loves it and now ""plays move and groove"" during other parts of the day. She has become quite the personal trainer and pressures us to get into it with her and keep with our routine of doing it every evening. It is easy to follow and easily translated into the living room. It has been great to get us couch potatoes moving! We purchased a Sesame street video at the same time and we (the grown ups) did not like it at all. It was just a bunch of dances. This one is a full workout sequence including stretching, warming up, lots of movement, and cooling down.",1384905600,,611,4.230769230769231
1731233,2,B0000695EM,I have a home daycare and it was not appropriate for their age and hard to keep interest. Hard to follow.,1380672000,,105,4.0476190476190474
1731234,5,B0000695EM,"My 2 and a half year old daughter just loves it since first play! Now we are playing this DVD at least 5 times in a row! Move N Groove Kids offers warm up stage, all different names and variety of movements, fun music. Teachers are fun, creative and participative. All the kids including teachers wearing bright clothes that makes my daughter like to watch (she is not a TV person). This DVD is her favorite and helps a lot for staying home(due to weather) and being busy. I really recommend Move N Groove to my friends with little kids.",1379635200,,537,4.38
1731235,1,B0000695EM,My two year old granddaughter watched it for about a minute before she ran off to do something else.  It was also defective. I was actually glad because I was able to get my money back for this.  I would rate Amazon excellent for customer service but this DVD is not worth any amount of money.,1379548800,2,293,4.214285714285714
1731236,5,B0000695EM,"movement, music, learning about music and new words while keep your body moving. the children in my childcare program just enjoy this crazy fast moving cd.",1375920000,,155,5.0
1731237,3,B0000695EM,Thought it was going to be more exciting for kids. It is too random not what I thought it would be.,1374019200,,99,3.761904761904762
1731238,5,B0000695EM,My daughter enjoys this more than her other dance DVD's. I think it may have something to do with the fact that she is able to watch the other children do the moves. Also the dance movements are fairly simple for a two year old to grasp. I also like that my daughter will often times specifically request this dance DVD instead of her favorite TV show.,1372636800,,352,4.268656716417911
1731248,1,B0000695EM,My daughter loves interactive dvds.  This one did not hold her attention or motivate her to dance and run around.  I was hoping to use it on rainy cold days for indoor activity.  The voices are kinda annoying and just not an impressive video.,1370563200,,242,4.454545454545454
1731249,5,B0000695EM,My 4 and 6 year old love this video. They Move N Groove as they giggle and act silly. So much fun!,1367798400,,98,3.5
1731250,5,B0000695EM,My daughter is VERY active.  I bought this video so she would have something to do indoors through the winter.  She actually asks to watch this video.  She will do the activities on her own but she likes it best when we join her.  Great morning routine for all to get your blood pumping.,1365638400,,287,4.2592592592592595
1731251,4,B0000695EM,"I got this video for my two year-old niece, because she LOVES to dance! Well, we popped this in and it was mainly activities, such as running, skipping, and stretching, but she still really really enjoys it anyway.  It is fun and entertaining. The two dance/activity instructors in the video are really nice, but they sometimes seem to talk over each other. And, the sound quality and production value could be way better.

All in all, it's not perfect, but it's fun and kids in the younger age groups will love doing it!",1365379200,,521,4.591397849462366
1731252,1,B0000695EM,"Thought this would be a fun dvd for my 2 yr old and I to work out with.  Very slow and boring music.  Didn't keep his, or my, interest for long.  Kept waiting for the great catchy songs and lively movement.  This dvd had slow stretches and a lot of way to basic actions.  ""Everyone run, everyone skip, everyone jump"" type stuff.  I can take my kid outside and do these without instruction.  Was hoping for more dance type moves and better songs.

I wish I could return it or get my money back.  So disappointed.",1365292800,,511,4.239583333333333
1731253,5,B0000695EM,Have used this in both a 2 and 3 year old classroom and the kids will get into the action. Seems to hold their attention pretty well as long as the teacher works with them. Great opportunity to exercise on those rainy/cold days when outside play is not possible.,1365206400,,262,4.36734693877551

1731257,5,B0000695EM,"When she first turned 2, my daughter wasn't able to follow this dvd much.  Now at 2.5 she loves this video.  As soon as I tell her I'm going to workout she asks for her workout.  So, some days I do her workout first as my warmup!  She loves it, picks up terms easily from it.",1357516800,,275,3.857142857142857
1731260,5,B0000695EM,"Our little girl (almost 3) is very active.  We thought this would be a great DVD to have in the WI winter months when we couldn't be outside as much.  We put it in the other night and my little girl moved the entire time the DVD was playing.  It's a little corny (for adults), but I think that is what makes it so good for kids!  The dance section is definitely the best (toward the end), but the whole DVD is definitely worth it.  Glad we purchased because my daughter likes to move around and dance!",1356652800,4,501,4.123711340206185
1731261,4,B0000695EM,I have high hopes that my granddaughter likes this present!  She loves to dance and sing and this seems to have a nice collection of songs and action to go along.  Her family lives in a small house but this won't take up a lot of room but should give my granddaughter plenty of activity and delight.,1356048000,,299,4.228070175438597
1731262,5,B0000695EM,"This DVD (we have the 1st dvd in the series) has been a great addition to our daily routine. We typically do the entire DVD 2-3 times a day. The DVD is 26 minutes in length, therefore it is a great aerobic activity. It breaks up our day especially in the winter! I love joining my son- keeps me moving throughout the day and adds to my daily exercise goals. We also do just dance on the Wii. Both have been a great gross motor learning tool. I'm planning to purchase the other DVDs in this series. I'm also planning to recommended these DVDs to my sons preschool.",1355702400,3,563,4.222222222222222
1731263,5,B0000695EM,Lots of fun and creative fun music.  Our toddlers are enjoying this everyday.  Very catchy music and they ask for it when it is not on.,1354579200,,135,4.153846153846154
1731264,5,B0000695EM,"I was having a hard time getting my 2 year old to follow simple directions. I bought this DVD in desperation because I don't have the benefit of any nearby mommy & me type classes. Anyway, I will say that the first 3 weeks, I had to push my kiddo to really participate. This is not one of those DVD's you pop in and walk away from (at the start), so I would move my toddler's body just as the on screen kids and teachers where doing. when it was time to run or skip I would tug her little hand and pull her along, even if she did not skip, I would and would offer up alternative moves if the ones on screen where too hard (at the beginning, all I could do was get her to walk around and run).

Even now the ""push and pull"" move is one she likes to watch me do but can't/wont mimic.
Well let me tell you, the DVD is a total hit now and I can even pop it in and watch my toddler do the movements on her own. That said, she much prefers me doing the video with her and I don't mind at all.. I have actually lost weight and got a stronger abdomen from it. I was in such bad shape before this DVD that I could not even lift my feet off the ground if I was sitting on the floor.. now I can lift both my arms and legs in the air like they have the kids do! lol!

This is also a good DVD for parents who need to provide physical education options for kids stuck indoors because of bad weather. Or to supplement a homeschooling program (keyword here is supplement. Kids need to get out as much as they can!).",1354060800,,1499,3.8794788273615635

1731267,5,B0000695EM,This is a great workout for the whole family.  The kids have fun and it gives mom a nice light workout.  Highly recommend for a good indoor family activity.,1339891200,,156,4.344827586206897

1731269,5,B0000695EM,Our 3-year old son LOVES these DVDs.  We got them as a gift and he immediately wanted to dance and sing along.  Usually he will zone out on the couch if we turn on the TV (which we hate) but with these videos he spends the whole time dancing and jumping around the living room.  Highly recommended!,1310256000,,298,4.192982456140351
1731290,5,B0000695EM,"I so wish someone would create more children exercise videos like this one!  Move N Groove is exactly what I was looking for!  My 3 year old son loves the video!  I would prefer to go outside anytime, but when weather, circumstances, or sickness keep us inside it's nice to have a kid-friendly exercise video to pop in to give my son some physical activity!  Especially when I am ill and can't keep up with him as much.  My son loves it so much, he acts out the routines while outside playing in the grass!  He loves the wiggle, kick, and punch part especially!!  I have already recommended this to friends, and am planning to buy another one for my niece and nephew who are close to the same age! Good idea for a birthday gift too!",1306281600,,732,4.299270072992701
1731291,5,B0000695EM,"I have daughters, two and three years old.  We purchased this DVD because my 3 year old has dance class one time per week and was asking everyday to go to dance class.  Now we have our ""dance class"" at home everyday.  She loves it and participates well for about 3/4ths of the video.  She gets a bit bored by the end.  My two year old likes the warm up but that is about it.  Overall this was a good purchase for the price.  I would recommend this DVD to others with toddlers.

Update:  We have now had this DVD for 10 months and it was worth every penny!  My girls are now 2.5 and 4 and on any given day one will love it and do the whole thing.  Some days both girls love it and do it together.  As with every movie, they may get bored and not do it for a couple months but they enjoy coming back to it.",1302998400,,804,3.8650306748466257
1731292,5,B0000695EM,"I got this DVD for my 4 yr old daughter who had seen me working out and wanted her own exercise DVD. It has been a huge hit! The first day we got it, we opened it up and put it in and she was totally enthralled for the entire length of the DVD. She loved it so much that she did it twice in a row! This is a great way to ""get her wiggles out"" on days when it's too wet or cold to go outside or in the winter when it gets too dark to play outside early in the evening. She really loves it when I do the DVD along with her, that makes for a lot of giggles! As an out of shape mom, this DVD is a workout for me too. The parts where you are running/jumping/marching/dancing are a great heart rate booster! I can see her enjoying this DVD until she's at least six, maybe seven.",1297123200,,772,3.7423312883435584

1731294,1,B0000695EM,"Received the video this morning today...popped it in the DVD and observed my son as it played. My 2.5 year old son watched it for about 1.5 mins and he got out of his chair and threw himself on the floor and threw a tantrum wanting me to take it out. My little son goes to a Little Gym once a week, and has been participating in over 20 sessions that does similar stuff as the Move N Groove video, he has never once thrown a fit at the Little Gym. But for some reason, he didn't respond to the Move N Groove video.  He loves watching Brainy Baby DVD's and Baby Rodenburg and has never cried about them being on, but for some reason he did not like Move N Groove. I am keeping my fingers crossed that tomorrow he will give it another try. Peace. Mommy in Knoxville, TN.",1294704000,,768,4.086092715231788

1731296,4,B0000695EM,"I don't own this, but we've borrowed it from the library a few times because both of my kids, ages 5 and 2, love it.  I have to say that as far as exercise videos go, this one doesn't really have them move around as much as I would like, but it is active.  It's obviously low budget, but I don't really care about that as long as my kids are being active and enjoying themselves.  My 2 year old doesn't really keep up with it very well, but she has a great time trying to do what her big brother is doing, so she gets some energy out as well.  I am going to buy it just because both kids like it and it's something good to do when they get antsy from being cooped up in the house when the weather is bad.  Anything they can do together that makes them both laugh and have fun without fighting is a winner to me.",1269302400,3,811,3.890909090909091

Luckily my kids have done it a couple times (which is why I gave it 2 stars not 1) but I am definitely on the hunt again for a decent kids exercise DVD. To sum it up; it would be perfect if you found it in the dollar bin at Wal-Mart, but for the price I paid it's a complete dissapointment.",1261526400,5,369,3.92

His favorite part is where the kids leap over the teacher because he gets me on the floor and leaps over my legs. First time we tried the 26min DVD he lost interest after 23min, but not now. We enjoy doing the creative movements and dance together. The moves are very simple (you could come up with it all yourself but who has the time?)... you get as much out of it as you put into it.

We must've literally played the tape everyday for the first year that we had it. It was my daughter's favorite video and she would do it all the way through, by herself, giving me uninteruppted time! I love the simple-to-follow exercises. The two women who lead it are good motivators, easy to understand, and not at all annoying. I have tried a few other childrens' exercise videos and this is the one my daughter likes the most. It also seems to keep her attention above all others.

There are a couple of things that she can't do yet - but for the most part she is able to do everything on the dvd.  We usually do it together when she is at my house but when she is at home with her parents - she does it by herself.  She loves it!  Definitely worth the money.,1142208000,39,425,3.730337078651685

My only complaint is that I wish they had an advanced version. I know that my daughter will grow out of this and will want something more challenging.
