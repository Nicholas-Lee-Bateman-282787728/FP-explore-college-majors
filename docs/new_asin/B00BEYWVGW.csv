8567398,5,B00BEYWVGW,"i personally thought doctor who. a kid's show , was always able to deliver the goods with fun stories and such. But this story remains one of my favorites of all time.  The doctor goes to a parallel universe where they are drilling to the earths core.  It's a cool story.  And for a kids show this is rather apocalyptic for sure.  The special edition adds more extras to this.  The picture is about the same from the other version.  Many fans of today's dr who, would not give this older stuff a chance, because of it's low budget. But these were fun and good shows.  I never analyze them much, remembering that this was at that time a kid's show. But they did a great job with what they had.  And this is equal to most adult sci fi in story.  That is quite a accomplishment for a kids show.",1470182400,,791,4.185430463576159
