2969663,3,B000WGYMTM,"In Rush hour 3, Chan and Tucker team up again to take down the Triad sydicate (who are trying to assasinate political figures). Chan appears to be working as a secret service agent, and Tucker appears to be a local cop (performing traffic duty). Somehow silly fate brings these 2 together again for Rush hour three!

As you can tell from the synopsis, you can't take this movie too seriously. If you are expecting good action scenes and funny jokes then you will like Rush Hour 3. If you are expecting an Oscar worthy drama, then prepare to be dissapointed.

Rush hour three is worse then ace ventura, but better then Starsky and hutch.",1187913600,3,636,4.5701754385964914

Like the two previous installments in the series, ""Rush Hour 3"" is an uneven mixture of low-ball humor and kick-ass action, with the amazingly nimble and athletic Jackie Chan once again playing the karate-chopping straight man to Chris Tucker's wisecracking cynic.

In this edition, detectives Carter and Lee go from the mean streets of LA to the cafes and sewers of Paris to find and protect a French woman who possesses information of great value to some sort of secret international organization.  Since the plot feels as if it were pretty much hammered out in a late night storyboarding conference, the filmmakers are forced to rely even more heavily on the charisma of the two lead actors than they did before; luckily, Chan and Tucker, intrepid troopers that they are, pretty much deliver what is asked of them in that regard.

I wish I could say the same for the screenplay by Jeff Nathanson and the direction by Brett Ratner.  For the most part, however, the humor in ""RH3"" is sub standard and derivative - a pale imitation of the classic ""Who's on First?"" comedy routine is particularly unfortunate and embarrassing - and the action sequences are not much better, until, that is, a spectacular fight scene between Chan and Lee's evil brother, played by Hiroyuki Sanada, set high atop the Eiffel Tower that finally brings the movie to life in its closing stretches.

For movie historians, the only real element of note here is the presence of legendary director Roman Polanski as an overzealous French inspector, and acting bulwark Max Von Sydow as World Criminal Court Director Varden Reynard.  As to the latter, what can one say about a career path that starts off with ""The Seventh Seal,"" then passes through something like ""Rush Hour 3"" on the way to its final destination?  Not much except, ""ain`t movies grand!""",1187654400,4,1832,4.868167202572347
2969665,3,B000WGYMTM,"After Rush Hour 2 (the best of the 3 films), this film was by far inferior. Chris Tucker seemed to lack the energy of the other two films and the plot of this film was extremely weak. Jackie Chan is his usually entertaining self with his usually death defying stunts. The whole movie revolves around Lee's friend (though he calls him his brother) trying to kill anyone who knows the identity of the head of the Chinese Tongs.

The scenes shift from Chicago to Paris, where the secret to the Tongs lies. This movie has a woman assassin who throws sharp objects at the boys. She is nowhere as intriguing as the female assassin from movie #2.

The movie also seems to end abruptly and lacks to comic interlude from the ending of the first two movies. As usual during the credits there are some funny outtakes which are funnier than anything in the movie itself.",1187568000,3,858,4.493589743589744
2969666,5,B000WGYMTM,"This third entry in the ""Rush Hour"" franchise is by far the best. Chris Tucker is funnier than ever and Jackie Chan shows he can still kick butt. There are a few surprises in store. By far, the most hilarious sequence is the one involving a zealous French cab driver. I choked on my popcorn several times during the film. Very funny.

Rated PG for action-violence.",1187395200,2,364,4.515151515151516
2969667,2,B000WGYMTM,"The first two were okay, and some of the action was in this one was okay, but the basic story is ever so stupid.
  *Spoiler*
I'll try not to give too much away, but there's a super important list of 13 names that need to get to the proper authorities. Unfortunately it's tattooed on a woman. Of course you want to save the woman, but why can't they send the list by some other means. Chris Tucker's character has a nice car and nice clothes, but he doesn't have a camera on his cell phone?
And Jackie Chan's character still works for the Chinese government, but he can't just write down the 13 names (they're in Chinese) and send them off to a couple of people??
Ughh!",1187308800,5,668,4.251968503937008
2969668,2,B000WGYMTM,"... but ""Rush Hour 3"" is the worst of the trilogy.

Here's what's good: the action scenes. I've always enjoyed the choreography of Jackie Chan's fight/flight scenes. But even these parts of the film are marred. For one thing, Chris Tucker intrudes on most of these parts without actually doing anything more than saying unfunny things (i.e: ""I know he's your brother, but make him into your sister!""). The other thing is, well, I suspect Chan has finally gone the way of stunt doubles for some of the work--and some of it is clearly enhanced by CGI.

The movie also insults the viewer with plot threads that don't make sense. Case in point, Chan and Tucker hijack a French cabbie at gunpoint--at gunpoint, mind you--and then, when they go into some random location to do some more fighting, they tell the cabbie to wait ... and he does! Come on, now. Puh-leease.

But the main thing is, there are maybe two or three funny parts in the whole darn movie, and that's not sustaining, not even for a shortie like this one. It's too bad. I liked the first two movies.

2969670,5,B000WGYMTM,"""Rush Hour 3"" is great! The cast led by Jackie Chan (as Lee) and Chris Tucker (as Carter) is great. The directing by Brett Ratner (who also directed ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006), ""After The Sunset"" (2004), ""Red Dragon"" (2002), ""Rush Hour 2"" (2001), ""The Family Man"" (2000), ""Rush Hour"" (1998), & ""Money Talks"" (1997) is great. The screenplay and story by Jeff Nathanson (who also wrote the screenplay to ""Fourth Installment Of The Indiana Jones Adventures"" (2008), ""The Terminal"" (2004), ""Catch Me If You Can"" (2002), & ""Rush Hour 2"" (2001) (also wrote the story) is great. The music by Lalo Schifrin (who also did the music to ""After The Sunset"", ""Rush Hour 2"", ""Rush Hour"", & ""Money Talks"") is great. The cinematography by J. Michael Muro (who also did the cinematography to ""Crash"" (2005) is great. The film editing by Mark Helfrich (who also did the film editing to ""X-Men: The Last Stand"", ""After The Sunset"", ""Red Dragon"", ""Rush Hour 2"", ""The Family Man"", ""Rush Hour"", & ""Money Talks""), Billy Weber (who also did the film editing to the upcoming ""The Love Guru"" (2008), & Don Zimmerman (who also did the film editing to the upcoming ""Jumper"" (2008) is great. The casting by Ronna Kress (who also did the casting to ""No Reservations"" (2007) & the upcoming ""The Invasion"" (2007) is great. The production design by Ed Verreaux (who also did the production design to ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" & ""Monster House"" (2006) is great. The art direction by Chad S. Frey (who also did the art direction to ""X-Men: The Last Stand"") is great. The set decoration by Kate J. Sullivan (who also did the set decoration to ""Monster House"") is great. The costume design by Betsy Heimann (who also did the costume design to the upcoming ""The Happening"" (2008), she also did the costume design to ""Lady In The Water"" (2006), ""Red Dragon"", & ""The Family Man"") is great. This is a great action-comedy that will keep you laughing. This is just as great as the first two ""Rush Hour"" films.",1186790400,,1968,4.707246376811594
2969671,4,B000WGYMTM,"Cops James Carter (Chris Tucker) and Lee (Jackie Chan) have since broken apart after an accident forced Lee and Isabella Molina to break up. But that is the least of Lee's problems, as he is assisting Ambassador Han (Tzi Ma), who plans on giving an adress to the World Criminal Court Summit that will reveal information about Triad gangs. However, not is all pleasant, and Han gets shot by whom appears to be Lee's brother Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada). It doesn't end well, what with Carter getting in the way and letting Kenji escape. After hearing that another World Criminal Court Summit in Paris, France will be the next target of attack, Carter and Lee take off to France to beat the Triads. The duo also meet an angry cab driver (Max von Sidow), a flamboyant French detective (Roman Pulanski), and a nightclub performer (Nomie Lenoir).

Due to a six-year wait, there's no doubt that ""Rush Hour 3"" couldn't have come out at a worse time. There was that whole drama with Chris Tucker aiming to get extra billing and the go-ahead to executive produce. Meanwhile, the action-comedy genre changed in different ways after Edgar Wright sended up the genre with ""Hot Fuzz"". Brett Ratner may not be able to overcome all these obstacles (except for Tucker, who still can wring out a laugh after six years in abscence), but he still offers a delectable entr that refuses to bow down in terms of entertainment.

""RH3"" may also have to live up to the second installment. Probably what I most remember about that film was the closing action scene where Lee and Carter jumped out of the Red Dragon in Las Vegas before being incinerated by a female assassin holding a bomb, then sliding down a pole and into a moving truck. Lee ran across it, while Carter just fell into it some times. It also helped win a best action scene at the 2002 MTV Movie Awards. Oh, and that film had a more rambunctious playground for Chan and Tucker to improv and break apart.

Things calmed down with ""RH3"", at least for the beginning. As usual, Carter and Lee are traveling across various places in LA and Paris, running into a very large kung fu teacher (played by Sun Ming Ming), running into a brothel (a very funny scene where Carter thinks Lee is tearing an Asian girl's butt up), dealing with the angry cab driver, and a couple more situations that I dare not give away.

Ratner can also film a couple good action scenes, with inspirations from John Woo (much like in the first one, Carter gets to fire two guns a la Chow Yun Fat, which shows Chris Tucker's newfound acrobatic skills that were hinted in ""Rush Hour 2"") to the Bruce Lee/Kareem Abdul Jabar film ""Game of Death"" (the aforementioned episode with Sun Ming Ming and Chris Tucker). The latter one, while not gut-bustingly funny, is very creative on Ratner's part. Hey, this guy did a good job in the last ""X-Men"" movie, so never doubt his Midas touch of directing solid scenes that rouse.

Even after six years, Chan and Tucker are still strong with their chemistry. Chan, even at the age of 53, is still capable of kicking up the action (pun intended) and offering some of the film's funniest lines (that even includes the outtakes, where he offers choices of what ""dirty movie"" he should play). Tucker hasn't waned much either, despite some old-hat lines that would've held up better in the '90s (especially during his love scene with Nomie Lenoir), what with his hilarious rendition of a classic Prince song and a funny musical number with Chan. Put these two together, and really, what could possibly go wrong?

For the finale, Ratner kicks things up a notch or two with an amazing fight scene at the Eiffel Tower. The director hardly overcompensates any lack of flair (though Industrial Light & Magic fills in any empty vessels in case of emergency), nor does Chan, as his swash-buckling with Hiroyuki Sanada is a sight to behold. I don't know if it will get any nods at next year's MTV Movie Awards, but it perfectly sums up the experience one viewer will have watching ""RH3"". Ratner may have to ride backseat of Edgar Wright, but I was genuinely happy with what he had to offer, and I hope it doesn't fade away any time soon.",1186704000,2,4163,4.611336032388664

2969800,4,B000WGYMTM,"I'm docking this film one star because it upset my wife so much.  She found Chris Tucker's womanizing, low class, black supremacist character (Officer Carter) annoying in all three Rush Hour movies, but he was particularly vulgar in this one, in an exchange with a French-speaking detainee and a Catholic nun for an interpreter, in which he made an oral sex joke about one of the detainee's female relatives whom he (Carter) had never actually, of course, met.  He later tells Lee that Lee can't be black, because there's ""a height requirement.""

Not to mention how Carter picked up two young women for himself and Detective Lee, quid pro quo, for leniency in a traffic stop in New York City, where he had been demoted to traffic cop after ruining Lee's chances of having sex with the Secret Service Agent they met in Rush Hour 2, by shooting her in the neck and leaving her disabled for the rest of her life.  When he picks Lee up in his car, with the two young women on board, he tells Lee that ""the fat one"" is his.  By then, Carter had already ""fat shamed"" the girl for weighing significantly more than her Driver's License indicated.

As in Rush Hour 2, there is plenty of eyecandy in this film.  For starters, the Chinese Consul's daughter has developed, as Carter quickly notes, a need for a bra in the past nine or ten years since he last saw her.  (No, they did not use the same actress nine years later.  The little girl was played by Julia Hsu in the 1998 film, and by Jingchu Zhang in this sequel, released in 2007.) Then the three of them go to Paris where they meet a showgirl named Genevieve, played by Noemie Lenoir, and a bevy of other showgirls, whom Carter undresses and redresses like dolls, under the ruse that he's their costume designer.  For those who like older, Oriental women, there's a villainous Dragon Lady, played by Yuki Kudo, Noemie's senior by eight years in reality.  Other fetishes are pandered to, as Noemie repeatedly displays her bald head with a tattoo on the back of it, making Carter think she is a man, although she emphatically and repeatedly insists that she's a woman.

Upon arrival in Paris, both Carter and Lee get beaten by the local police, whose Chief probes their anuses with a large ring on one of his fingers.  After walking bowlegged out of the police Chief's building, they get in a taxi cab with a French driver who hates Americans, and reappears throughout the film, badmouthing us, including a particularly poignant remark about not being an American and knowing ""what it's like to kill people for no reason.""  Presumably, this remark was included to advance the liberal gun control agenda, in spite of the extensive use of innumerable firearms by ""the good guys"" as well as the ""bad,"" throughout all of the Rush Hour films.

This French reception by their police reminds me of a similar scene in Jet Li's, Kiss of the Dragon.  Apparently, the French police have a reputation for being exceptionally corrupt and brutal, albeit ineffective, like the Pink Panther's Inspector Clouseau, as demonstrated by the recent massacres perpetuated by Moslems on their soil.  And Carter thought the L.A.P.D. was bad!

Besides tearing Paris apart and base jumping off of the Eiffel Tower with a makeshift parachute made out of a French flag, Lee and Carter (SPOILER ALERT!) rescue the girl and punch the French Police Chief in the face, after the taxi driver saves their lives.  But only after flushing themselves literally down a Parisian sewer...  Liberal Hollywood entertainers seem to have an obsession with excrement as well as homosexuality and gun control.",1469059200,,3608,4.733226837060703

2969838,4,B000WGYMTM,"This seemed like a somewhat forced attempt to create a trilogy for a series that really did not need one.  It, of course, brings back Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker and director Brett Ratner for the third installment of the buddy cop franchise.  The main focus is still the Lee/Carter relationship and elevating them from friend status to that of family.  Overall though the characters are what they are, and there is really no more room to develop them.

This time the bulk of the story involves the characters in France, trying to track down the list of the leaders of the Triad.  The scene stealer of the movie is anti-American sentiments from a cab driver (Yvan Attal) who eventually becomes an important and funny ally. Carter gets the girl in this movie, played by the gorgeous  (Noemie Lenoird) who is more important than she initially seems. There are also supporting roles by Max Von Sydow  and another great martial arts movie alum Hiroyuki Sanada, whom Ratner had to basically beg to return to the genere.  There are also tie backs to the first movie involving counsel Han, now Ambassador Han and his daughter.

Ultimately the Rush hour movies are what they are.  While I do not necessarily think this movie had to be made, chances are if you loved or enjoyed the first two, you will probably like this one too, although maybe not as much.  If you were lukewarm to the first two, then you may not like this one all that much.  For extras, you get a lot.  There is a commentary track on the movie by Ratner and the screen writer, trailers for the movie, and a second disc filled with a couple hours worth of making of and behind the scenes features and a production diary, which basically followed from the first day of shooting to the last.  It was interesting hearing Ratner describe doing the things in this one that he wanted to have in the others, like Chris Tucker getting beat up by a bunch of kids in a Karate Studio, a ""Reverse Game of Death"" type fight scene with a Chinese giant etc.  If you like going through bonus material you will really like all you get here.

I cannot say the movie will appeal to everyone, but if you have enjoyed the first two, I would say it is worth checking out.",1463270400,4,2206,4.4775

Not in making this movie.  Sadly, it seemed directed for money, not artistry.  I get annoyed with Chris Tucker playing an irresponsible self absorbed traffic cop dancing on the main road leading to a traffic disaster.  How is this funny??  It was annoying.  Nothing like the first 2 movies where Chris Tucker starts off as a crime busting cop.  Why is Chris tucker a traffic cop now? Wow.  And why is Jackie chan even having a prolonged, NOT funny, dialog about his girlfriend Isabella from Rush hour 2.  Terrible.  I'm a jackie chan fan but this was pretty bad.  The script was Very bad because who really cares about the plot.  They main characters look for Xia Xian throughout half the movie, and I didn't have the feeling like I cared enough about the cause it to follow the movie through.  Just roughly thrown together movie.  Surprisingly, the writers were the same as the previous movie so I was thinking to myself, ""What in the hell happened?""  There was no heart and spontaneous comedy in making this movie.  It was like constant ramblings from both actors that shot back and forth to make this movie seem so dull.",1427500800,,1301,4.586956521739131

2970165,3,B000WGYMTM,"Rush Hour 3(2007) does manage to please, but the magic is gone. This Rush Hour movie raises the violence and some of the storytelling is contrived. This Rush Hour movie experiments with vulgar humor! Inspector Lee talks about ordering a porno film in one scene. Chan is forcefed some awful dialouge in the movie. Rush Hour 3 takes place in Paris, France, yet it is a rehash of the first film. This is typical Hollywood product. Still, this movie is worth a rental or buying on DVD and Blu Ray if you have the cash! Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker return as Lee and Carter. I think Brett Ratner is the ""real star"" of this movie! The film's trailer uses a record scratch when someone tells a lame joke! The ""Chinglish"" scene was funny. There's rumors that a Rush Hour 4 is in the works. Rush Hour 3 is fun, but not the best Rush Hour installment.",1359936000,2,841,4.3630573248407645

2970208,1,B000WGYMTM,"In this movie, in our opinion, the movie makers made Jackie Chan's character out to be a real loser in his role of law enforcement officer.  He pursued and caught the man who had just shot the ambassador, and then let him walk away.  The fact he considered this man to be like a brother should not have interfered with him performing his duty.  Later in the film, Lee tells this man that the reason he had not shot him was because he (Lee) is not an assassin.  What a bunch of hooey!  My husband and I really enjoyed Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2, so we thought 3 would be at least as good.  Wrong!  Overall, this movie was a huge disappointment for us.",1345075200,3,649,4.144

2970211,2,B000WGYMTM,"A couple weeks ago I found a Rush Hour three pack on the bargain shelves at my local Ross Store. I had never heard of the Rush Hour movies before, but I thought they might make an interesting variation in the things that I watch as late-night entertainment. It did. ""Rush Hour"" was quite amusing in a strange way, I followed it up the next night with ""Rush Hour 2"" and it was very much the same way, except less so. Maybe I was burning out. So I took a break. Last night, my movie was ""Rush Hour 3."" Alas, I was very disappointed. It was just a weak imitation of the previous two.

""Rush Hour 3"" takes place largely in Paris, in contrast to Los Angeles and Hong Kong of the previous two, and is centered about the Eiffel Tower. Well, why not? It would give rise to some spectacular stunt scenes. Alas, the stunts are just not that good and nowhere near  the things observed in the original ""Rush Hour."" The  story is inconsequential, disorganized, and hard to follow. Well, who follows the story in these things anyway? The fights are somewhat weak relative to some in the earlier movies. After a while (the first half hour) I began to find the movie tedious. Then boredom set in and I began to wonder when it would ever end. And it just wasn't that funny either. I'd have to say that the series had run out of ideas, or it's always possible that I just burned out on an interesting and once-fresh idea.

2970215,3,B000WGYMTM,"Unsatisfying is the nicest thing I can say about this third entry in an otherwise entertaining series.  It's obvious that they've remade the first film too many times.  Chris Tucker was enjoyable, as usual, and kept up his end of the proceedings.  Jackie Chan, unfortunately, was another matter.  I just couldn't get past the gloomy pall he put on this outing by abruptly turning dour and remorse at the most inopportune of times (he would no doubt argue that he needed to go ""dramatic"" because of the awkward intrusion of a non-brother, brother who popped out of his past).  I'd counter with that being the exact moment you'd need to go funny.  Hello, he wasn't your real brother, he was a bad guy...oh wait, didn't they pull that ruse in RH #2?  (They also reused another gambit employed in the first movie only this time he was played by Max von Sydow.)  The ""who's on first"" routine with ""me & you"" was desperate but Chris Tucker forced it into funny, not so funny was the bizarre rant against Americans in the French taxi; it left me wondering who they were trying to skewer, the French or us.  And speaking of French, so much of the dialog could/should have been translated with subtitles.  The worst offense though was the disconcerting (some would say creepy) inclusion of exiled director Roman Polanski as a brutal cop.  My jaw dropped on that one.  What were they thinking!
This movie is a little above inept.  I did enjoy parts of it, some of the chase scenes/fight scenes, other parts were simply repetitious.  It's a keeper only because it's part of a set.  If it was a standalone movie, I'd ditch it in a heartbeat.

Sadly, there is word of a possible Rush Hour 4.",1300665600,,1678,4.561872909698996

2970229,5,B000WGYMTM,"I just saw Rush Hour 3 for the first time on TBS, and as a fan of the far more superior first two installments, I rather enjoyed this latest outing.

Sure, it got hammered by critics upon its theatrical release in 2007, and its box office returns, while robust, failed to live up to the expectations set by its predecessors. Granted, the plot is quite thin, and the series no longer has the new car smell of the first film.

But for me, it was fun to see Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker back in action. Chan as Hong Kong Inspector Lee and Tucker as LAPD Detective Carter make a great action-comedy buddy-cop duo. In fact, they are my favorite such pair. They still have great chemistry and play off each other very well. They are as hilarious in this movie as they are in the first two, especially as always in the outtakes.

Series director Brett Ratner is no slouch behind the camera, either. He has crafted yet another glossy, globetrotting affair, with Carter and Lee tracking the lethal Chinese Triad gang from Los Angeles to Paris. There, our heroes run afoul of a wacky French cop played by Roman Polanski, get driven around town in wild car chases by a local taxicab driver who fulfills his lifelong fantasy of being an American superspy, and face off with the bad guys in a spectacular climactic showdown at the Eiffel Tower. My appetite is whetted for Rush Hour 4.

2970268,4,B000WGYMTM,"For those who have been fans of the previous two ""Rush Hour"" films, it had been six years since the second film and many people highly anticipating the reunion of Director Brett Ratner (""X-Men: The Last Stand"", ""Red Dragon"" and ""Money Talks"") and talents Jackie Chan (""Supercop"", ""Shanghai Noon"" and ""The Forbidden Kingdom"") and Chris Tucker (""Jackie Brown"", ""Money Talks"" and ""The Fifth Element"").

Joining Brett is fellow ""Rush Hour 2"" screenwriter Jeff Nathanson (""The Terminal"", ""Catch Me If You Can"" and ""Speed 2: Cruise Control""), composer Lalo Schifrin (""Mission: Impossible"" films, ""Money Talks"" and ""The Sting II"") and cinematographer J. Michael Muro (""Southland"", ""Traitor"" and ""Crash"").

Because six years have passed, the film came out in the Summer of 2007 and with the excitement and comedy of the first two films, many fans were awaiting what would be in store for the third film.

The film was not exactly well-received by critics but ""RUSH HOUR 3"" is a film that manages to bring people to theaters who want a comedy/action flick to enjoy for the Summer.  The film which cost $140 million to make, grossed over $255 million worldwide and thus, paving way for a new ""RUSH HOUR 4"" film scheduled anywhere between 2010-2012.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

When ""RUSH  HOUR 3"" was released on Blu-ray back in December 2007, the Blu-ray release received the highest marks for its picture and audio quality.  With the Blu-ray release now over a year old, I am revisiting the film and seeing how it compares to the current releases of today.

The film sports a 1080p High Definition (2:35:1) transfer.  The film is definitely vibrant with many outdoor shots during the sunny day and detail featured during the Los Angeles and French scenes in the film.  The picture quality is not soft, lighting is definitely featured prominently in this film as its one thing to get vibrant colors during the outdoor scenes but in one nightclub scene, the colors that come through during the choreography screen shows how low-light combined with the various blue and purple lighting are equally vibrant and blacks are a nice and deep.

Even today, ""RUSH HOUR 3"" is still a vibrant looking film that retains its grain and overall, a great looking film on Blu-ray.

As for audio, I really enjoy these 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtracks and one thing you will notice from ""RUSH HOUR 3"" is that the soundtrack sounds absolutely nice.  Maybe not as much punch as a ""Quantum of Solace"" or ""Transformers: The Movie"" but the film manages to utilize all channels on my 7.2 system setup.  Rear surrounds are used primarily to enhance the music and certain sound effects which were nice.  Surrounds definitely made certain scenes feel immersive but for the most part, dialogue is clear (although some scenes by both Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan may be a bit difficult to understand at times and you may need to rewind the scene to better understand what is going on). Overall, a solid lossless audio soundtrack.

As for subtitles, subtitles are presented in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""RUSH HOUR 3' is definitely a Blu-ray release that deserves attention for picture and audio quality but the film also manages to include hours of special features which were quite enjoyable and all are featured in 1080p HD.

DISC 1:

  * Audio commentary by Director Brett Rather and Jeff Nathanson - People can listen to the commentary throughout the film or by enabling the Enhanced Visual Commentary which features both men in a picture-in-picture screen.  The Enhanced Visual Commentary didn't need any changing of Blu-ray audio setup like some Blu-rays will need for P-I-P display.  But as far as the commentary is concerned, both men go into the making of the film, working with Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker again and the other talents used in the film and much more.  A very entertaining commentary by both men.
  * Trailer - The original theatrical trailer for the film.

DISC 2:

  * Outtakes - (2:33) The outtakes from the film.
  * Deleted/Alternate Scenes - (7:12) People can watch seven deleted and alternate scenes including an alternate ending with optional commentary by Director Brett Ratner and Screenwriter Jeff Nathanson.  Here is what is included:  Extended Airplane, Extended Taxi, Extended Elevator, Hotel Hallway, Spotlight Guy: Follies, Extended Eiffel Tower, and Alternate Ending.  For the most part, both are rather humorous when discussing these scenes, scenes they wish they didn't cut out but most interesting is Ratner and Nathanson's discussion about the alternative ending and not sure why they created that.
  * Making of ""RUSH HOUR 3' - (1:28:10) Literally, the making of ""RUSH HOUR 3' from the script to the cast and the music.  Interviews with crew and talent and more.  Very in-depth featurette of what Nathanson wanted to accomplish with the script and what Ratner wanted to accomplish with the casting a worldwide talent of characters and more.  Here is what is included in this segment (can be watched ala ""View All"" or separately):

- The Story, The Script

- Casting the Rush

- Teaming Up

- Creating the Rush: Scene by Scene

- Cuts, Sound & Music

  * Visual Effects Reel - (2:03) An interesting look at various scenes and using digital characters instead of real life characters and going through scenes that looked real but were in CG.
  * Le Rush Hour Trois Production Diary -(1:05:05) A very candid look at Bret Ratner making ""Rush Hour 3' and the challenge the crew faced with the making of this film.  Including behind-the-scenes footage of certain scenes, what happened off camera and more.  Very fun to watch and informative.

EASTER EGGS:

There are two Easter Eggs.  The first is on Disc 2 and pressing up on ""Visual Effects Reel"" in the main menu.  You will see a logo show up and when you click on it, you will get a short video with Jackie Chan and Hiroyuki Sanada's characters fighting with light sabers.  The other is on subtitles and selecting the New Line Cinema logo to access credits for the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I really enjoyed ""RUSH HOUR"" and ""RUSH HOUR 2'.  Both films manage to showcase a good amount of humor and action and this odd couple manage to successfully bring in people to the theaters because you know that it's a fun film to watch.  Both Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are so unlike and they are the ultimate odd couple on screen but they manage to make it work.

But ""RUSH HOUR"" films are not films to expect a deep storyline.  If anything, there are many racial jokes on both sides of the film and as evident from the special features, there are lines that Jackie Chan has no idea what he's saying, nor does he know what they mean.

""RUSH HOUR 3' is simply a film that you just don't want to expect anything more from.  The laughs, the actions, the camaraderie are enough.

But with the Ratner and crew trying to come up with a new story six years later, I felt the movie felt as if it was rushed.  I felt that the duo dynamic was subdued. Similar to the ""Odd Couple"", these two are quite the opposites and both Lee and Carter who have now become good friends, like brothers was fine but it's been far too long since these Ratner, Chan and Tucker have worked with each other.

Chris Tucker did a fine role as Carter but for some reason, as much as I know Jackie Chan is a popular singer in Asia, I suppose that I wanted to see more action-based scenes with him rather than many singing scenes. It just seemed out of place. But knowing that Chan who was 53-years-old at the time, is not going to be doing a lot of action scenes as he did back in 1998 when the first film was released in theaters.  And if the fourth film is released in 2012, I'm not sure how much we can expect from, especially now as he wants to focus on serious films in Asia.

Also, I felt the character of George (The taxi driver) was a bit overused.  Fine for the first time but seeing him evolve as a character, again, with the film focused on Lee and Carter, seeing the character George being so prominent seemed a bit off.

Max von Sydow has always managed to have this mysterious allure to him.  From the 1975 film ""Three Days of the Condor"" to ""RUSH HOUR 3', the roles that he tends to play makes those familiar with his work automatically know where his character as Reynard is going to go.  But I felt there could have been much more potential with his character.

I really enjoyed Hiroyuki Sanada as Kenji.  His role as an action star in Japan was definitely showcased in ""RUSH HOUR 3'.  It was also great to see Ratner utilizing other worldwide talents such as Jingchu Zhang, Youki Kudoh and Noemie Lenoir.

But in the end, I was entertained by ""RUSH HOUR 3"".  There are some major laughs and action sequences in the film that manage to capture the soul of the ""RUSH HOUR"" films and on Blu-ray, you get a wonderful transfer with outstanding picture and audio quality and hours of special features which were enjoyable to watch.

For fans of the film or the trilogy, ""RUSH HOUR 3"" is a wonderful Blu-ray release.

Rush Hour 3 had some funny moments, starting with Chris Tucker directing traffic with Prince in his ears.  The sight jokes (girls butts on a car) and the fall-down gags got old after awhile.

Thin plot, some reality stretching and some characters left unexplained (the woman assassin was never explained and her demise was not missed, played by Sun Ming Ming.).

Favorites:  ""You're not my brother?"" -- to the tune of ""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word"".

""My name is you.  No not me.  I'm me.  Who's you?  I'm you.""  If you are familiar with Abbott and Costello's Who's on First, you're older than me!

Jackie's character knows he has an evil brother, who he tries to save even as his brother tries to kill  him anyway.  Amazing.  And Jackie loses nearly every fight scene and runs away.  Disappointing.

2970300,3,B000WGYMTM,"I am sorry folks, but after waiting over 6 years for the sequel to Rush Hour 2, I found this film to be disappointing.  I was underwhelmed by The stale gags that were very entertaining in Rush Hour 1&2 but were just stale in this one. Jackie Chan was actually Cris Tucker's sidekick here.  I would have liked a different plot that after such a time lag might have stood alone without the references to bits and pieces of the first 2 movies.
  The film opens with  Chris Tucker  directing traffic in a street cop uniform only to pick up a couple of girls.  Once again we see the Triad as a weak plot theme that brings us back to the Chinese ambassador and his now teen aged daughter with their lives in danger that the good Inspector Lee has to protect again.

 The friendly banter is not as funny between Chan and Tucker and although Jackie Chan can still do his own stunts, but  he is obviously not as young as he was when he was still doing his karate action stuff so the action sequences are more shoot em up and swinging from flying flags off the side of the Eifel Tower with a long lost ""brother"" from his past who we never heard about.  The Max Von Snydow character as the villain is underutilized as the French ambassador. And there is no plot tie up of loose ends.

If you like the Rush Hour films, the film is watchable not as entertaining as the previous films. Paying full price for it would be  frustrating.  I think Rush Hour 4 would be superfluous.",1217376000,,1462,4.2690909090909095

Furthermore, if this kind of American cinema had some finesse, he would have been able to make fun of French with intelligence. The criticism of France through the Atlanticist recurring themes of cowardice - our banned sacrifice in Iraq is still difficult to be understood the hawks bushists is vulgar and stupid.

Chris Tucker's character is just as annoying as before, although, he was bearable in the first two.  This one was a whole new level of annoyance.  Jackie Chan seemed tired.  He really should quit making these movies.  Don't get me wrong, I like Jackie Chan.  I think he is extremely talented and really brings alot to action movies.

Truly, the plot's a bit confusing. A diplomat who gets shot just as he was going to reveal the leaders of the Triads; a list of names tattooed on a woman's head; various factions after Lee and Carter and the woman and each other.

The action and jokes are pretty much what you'd expect if you've seen the first 2 movies. One of the bad guys, however, is Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada) Lee's ""brother"" (they'd grown up together), and that provides a nice bit of emotional conflict.

The other thing that distinguishes this movie from the first two is the Paris setting, with a cool action sequence on the Eiffel Tower, but mostly with the sneering Parisian cab driver George (Yvan Attal), who provides even more laughs and ends up making a surprising ally. The addition of his character to the Tucker/Chan duo kept it fresh, not unlike an old married couple with a new audience for their stories. I also really enjoyed his rather skewed view of America--it's not actually all that exaggerated.

It wasn't quite as good as the first two, but it was a fun way to spend an evening--we always enjoy Jackie Chan, even in his cheesiest movies (or maybe that's especially), and as my son's English teacher is won't to say, ""Chris Tucker is a funny man.""",1214265600,3,1478,4.587121212121212

Everything is a matter of convenience.  They always walk to the right place and there is always some minor character telling them where they need to go next.

I must comment that I was stunned by the comment someone made about age catching up with Jackie Chan.  He looks in top form to me, and I would like to see that reviewer do one-tenth of the acrobatics when he is JC's age.

Its a basic martial arts, buddy action comedy flick. that's it, and in that aspect, Rush Hour 3 delivers the goods. Granted, its not exactly oscar material, but then again it follows as a decent trilogy to the first 2. I would say the movie was a bit of a letdown more by the support actors apart from these two and the need to film it in Paris.

My favorite is the interrogation of the french triad member by these two in the prescence of the nun.

I really enjoyed Rush Hour 1 and 2. I thought the chemistry between the soft-spoken, but very acrobatic Jackie Chan and the motor-mouth Chris Tucker was very good for the first two films. The first Rush Hour worked well because we saw the culture change Jackie Chan experienced going to the United States and the second Rush Hour was humorous because we saw Chris Tucker experience the culture change in China. For the third and final act (hopefully final), both characters go to France, Europe to experience a new culture for both of them. However since Rush Hour 3 (2007) came nearly six years after Rush Hour 2 (2001) and Rush Hour 1 (1998), it seems the chemistry between Chan and Tucker dried up. I heard rumors that in real life the actors didn't like each other off screen.  Hard to believe if there was hatred between them when it looked fun while they were both singing and dancing to the ""War"" song in part one. If the rumors of their hatred for each other are true, than the efforts in part three can be justified.

Other than the fantastic stunt scene on the Eiffel Tower, Rush Hour 3 looked like a ""rushed"" effort done only to simply complete a trilogy that perhaps should have never been completed. It seems nowadays all movies that have a part two MUST have a part three so that a trilogy DVD set can be sold in the future. Other than humor that is practically non-existent in part three and no memorable antagonist or villain to counter Chan & Tucker not much worked well. I really wanted to enjoy part three despite the bad theatrical reviews it initially got since I bought the Rush Hour 3 DVD during the Christmas holidays (when the DVD was first available) in order for my wife and I to watch something new on a quite evening alone. I think the film would have worked better if it got a better protagonist or villain to counter Chan & Tucker.  By the way I really liked Ziyi Zhang from part two in which she played a great villain (or femme fatale). Perhaps part three could have used another major actor to play the main villain such as Jason Statham (who could have fitted in some sort of Frenchman role) or Jet Li (not that Jackie Chan would have a fighting chance against Statham or Li). In the end I think the producers of Rush Hour 3 truly fumbled with this effort. I think the wait was too long, laughs were few, action ordinary and the effort rushed. 5 stars for part one & two, but only 2 stars for part three.",1207785600,5,2661,4.740820734341253
2970333,3,B000WGYMTM,"I have always been a great Jackie Chan fan, and I liked the first two installments, but the third is a bridge too far. Plotwise it seemes to be a revised version of the first, which really lets you know beforehand when what is going to happen. Not a great trait. The action is of roughly the same caliber as its predecessors, although somehow a bit lacking. The jokes are funny enough though, but can't carry the film on their own.

I think this film is a good example of the worse side of this hollywood obsession with sequels these days. Some times it just was not meant to be. 2,5 stars.",1207699200,5,590,4.267857142857143
2970334,3,B000WGYMTM,"It's been so, so long since I've watched the other two movies.

To be honest, i remember nothing of the first movie which many think was the best.

Of Part 2 I remember the little asian girl singing Mariah Carey's ""Fantasy"" in the car. She was JAMMIN'! haha...
And the ending had a casino fight with a few thugs and I remember one of them, probably Chris, fighting this chick who was very good at fighting.
They both were!
But like I said it's been a LONG time so other parts are hazy or non-existent!!

But this movie...it starts off with Tucker directing traffic (he's a police officer this time) and he's singing ""Do Me"" by an old-school singer, that I can't remember.

It's not Stephanie Mills but it's one who came out around her time, I would think!

The fight scenes were OK, the comedy was OK and the rest had a been there done that feel.

It was underwhelming for sure and I didn't quite get through the whole movie.

I got really tired and I turned it off because it was leaving a lot to be  desired.

Shoot me down for not watching the whole thing but that's just how it went down.

Before I leave you though, I must say that this movie was actually pretty racist also. Not towards blacks, but from blacks in a sense. Whoever wrote the script, gave Chris a few lines of ""funny"" Asian jokes such as the china man and other racist, predictable fodder that was to an extent funny, but not funny enough to be worth saying.
He also has a line where he says to his partner in crime that he knows all he does eat is rice and such.

2.7 stars.

End note: Give me a bad rating if you want but all we have to do is look at the overall score. It reflects my opinion rather well. Don't get me wrong though. It wasn't a total bummer. There were funny parts. It's just that in between all that you were waiting for something...

I won't give anything away but I will say the first 30 minutes (give or take) have the funniest stuff in the film! After that it slows down with a few funny moments but doesn't really pick up on the action until the Eiffel Tower scene.

Overall, not a bad movie but I wouldn't pay $19.95 for it. I'd get it either used or at a reduced price. As for how it does against the first two, it is definitely three! Still an entertaining romp if you don't have anything for about 2 hours.",1204070400,,758,4.114864864864865

The weakest link in the first two films was always Chris Tucker, who is just embarrassing. It seems like he is trying to be a low-budget Eddie Murphy, and fails.

Fortunately in Rush Hour 3 he is older and a bit less hyper. Age perhaps is also showing in Jackie Chan, who is always fun to watch, but his stunts are less impressive this time around.

The problem here is either in the writing or the directing. The film just seems to be a series of (not very funny) comedy sketches strung together, with the actors just doing through the motions. Max von Sydow delivers his usual quality, but the resolution of his character is just a repeat from the first film and not a surprise.

Whereas in the first two films the story provided good fodder for letting these two provide hilarious comedy and cool action stunts, now they're left to basically fend for themselves because even the plot itself isn't taken seriously.  The return of Soo-Yun (who grew up really quickly in just a few years, from being a little girl to being a teacher!) helps a little, but not enough.  This time, the comedic formula doesn't stick very often and the action scenes are also disappointing.
It's just too silly for its own good, that's my issue with it.  Even if the film completely recycled stuff that worked in the first two films, I would have been cool with that.  But this time, even the execution is off, to the point where the film isn't even that interesting.

2970398,1,B000WGYMTM,"First, I agree with the critics who say there's an element of nastiness in this film.  Racism, for example.  I'm kinda surprised Chris Tucker let himself be cast this way.  He starts out as a traffic cop instead of a detective, against Chan's now being an ambassador's bodyguard.  Throughout most of the film, it seems he's the one who makes most of the blunders, and Chan is the one who does most of the bailing out and serious work.

Second, I think the film crosses the line into indecency.  It should be R-rated, not PG-13.

This may as well be the last Rush Hour film.  I enjoyed 1 and 2, but after seeing this, I'll probably not buy any more, unless I have reason to think there's been a big improvement.",1201478400,4,710,4.366412213740458
2970399,3,B000WGYMTM,"Fans of the Rush Hour series may (will likely) enjoy this one, but for the most part this is just more of the same action and plot that was in the first two Rush Hour movies.

All too predictable, all too easy to figure out who the good guys are (and who they aren't) long before the movie even really gets going, like the earlier Rush Hour movies the fun for this movie is in watching Jackie Chan's excellent action sequences and in snickering a bit at Chris Tucker's attempts to copy those or toss in a funny line here and there.

I have to ask the studio if they really felt it was necessary to waste a second disc on this, and have to wonder about the idea that Blu-ray has so much room per disc and yet this movie was released on two discs and not one?  I suppose it was just a choice by the studio, but I know that Blu-ray discs can easily hold much more content than just the movie, or just the movie and a commentary track and original theatrical trailer.

There are a good many extras available with this release, but those extras aren't on the disc with the movie.  In some ways that could be considered a good thing as you might be tempted to watch the movie again instead of simply putting the extras disc in the player and not having to worry about it.  It just seems a bit strange that the extras do come on another disc rather than having a single disc with movies, extras and everything on it.

Further confusion comes from the fact that the main feature itself only runs approximately 90 minutes.  (In many ways that can be considered a good thing about this movie).  At that relatively short length, one would expect there was plenty of left over space on the main disc to have included a lot of the content that was instead put on the second disc.  I suppose the trade off would have been that a bunch of content that is on the second disc might have been left out entirely in the name of saving the plastic used for make the second disc.  If that was truly the case, then in the words of Emily Latela, ""never mind.""

Is it worth the purchase?  If you can find it discounted go for it.  If not, try Unbox and watch it that way (and leave room in your cabinet for sets that are better than this middle of the road quality movie).",1201305600,2,2247,4.195348837209302

There is no ground breaking acting or film-making here...the same formula is in place...a buddy movie of action and comedy.  I really enjoyed the first movie, but Rush Hour 2 was just a little more bland.  Rush Hour was one of the first that coupled Jackie Chan with an American star to fuse his martial arts skills with comedy.  While I am not a big fan of Chris Tucker, I found myself liking this duo.  An African-American Comedian paired together with an Asian Action Martial Arts Legend for an action/comedy worked for me.  Now on its third installment seemed on face value to be an uninteresting stretch of the original and only out to make a quick buck.  However,after watching this as a rental I bought a copy.  This movie delivered as an entertaining reworking of the formula.

This movie finds them headed to Paris to find the assassin who attempts the Chinese Ambassador's life.  We find out that Jackie Chan's character was in an orphanage and has a connection of some sort of ""brotherhood"" with another boy that turns to a life of crime.  Now Jackie Chan is on a mission to bring down the Triads, despite his ""brother's"" involvement.  Chris Tucker continues to keep things funny with his stylish dancing, singing and comedic cop blunders...Jackie Chan continues to impress with his still agile martial arts moves.

A weak but exciting and sometimes funny sequel of the popular action-comedy franchise from director Brett Ratner! co-starring Maggie Smith and Max Von Sydow, the film doesn't quite have any of the charm of the first two movies but it is hilarious at time with such moments like the battle with the really tall Chinese man at the karate classic.

2970452,2,B000WGYMTM,"What do you call a movie that has no originality; paper thing story; big plot holes; forced humor; stereotypes and almost no laughs? Rush Hour 3 is your answer. This tiresome sequel from the Chan-Tucker team brings absolutely nothing new to the table. They all came back for the big paycheck and it's so painfully obvious. Tucker--the big winner here, financially speaking--doesn't even try anything new with his predictable humor and Chan looks tired and boring the whole time. I hope it all ends here because I don't like how they filmmakers deliberately recycle old materials to make a so called ""new"" film of this franchise.

Brief Intro Story:
Few years have passed and now Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) is a funny traffic cop, and Chief inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) is still a bodyguard for the Chinese Ambassador Han who is scheduled to give a speech at the embassy about the biggest crime organization in the world--the Chinese Triads. As he is giving the speech, he gets shot by a sniper. Chan goes after the shooter, but once they get face to face, he lets him go. Tucker appears at the scene but it's too late.

The Ambassador survived the shooting, but he is the hospital and needs protection. His daughter Soo Yung also shows up to see his condition. Meanwhile a group of killers also show up at the hospital to finish the job--the Ambassador is moved to another room, a la Godfather. The shooting begins and predictably our duo wins and captures a Chinese-French hostage that tells them that the key of this mystery is in Paris. They go to Paris to find out who is behind this.

Review:
The only thing I found hysterically funny about this sequel is the large amount of plot holes--for example; no cops to protect the Ambassador at the hospital, Tucker becoming a detective after being just a traffic cop, Ambassador's daughter ending up in Paris and so forth. Also the story itself is just a recycled version of the previous films--with just a small little twist that you can see it coming from a mile away. How many times have we seen the veteran actor Max von Sydow being the double-face guy? We get no originality from director Brett Ratner who brags about making films in no time--it definitely shows. Well, it also shows Chris Tucker's humor that is predictable, average, and for him, easy to generate--He can do this without too much effort, so let's not give him a lot of credit for it. Unfortunately Jackie Chan is not that great either. He looks bored and tired throughout the film. Does he really want to be in this third installment? His age definitely shows because his stuns are simpler and uses body doubles. He does, however, pulled few good stuns, but nothing like the previous films.

Besides the beat-to-death racial stereotypes and gratuitous partial nudity, we find another ""great"" accomplishment by the writer Jeff Nathanson who knows how to put America down by adding a hateful French taxi driver who bashes American international policy--in that uncomfortable moment, the audience went dead silence. Is it funny to talk like that? Sadly for some, it is. Thank you for reminding us about the hostility from the rest of the world and the terrible danger that we as a nation face everyday.

The Verdict:
Rush Hour 3 is a mechanical affair created solely to bring to the masses cheap mindless humor and collect some big paychecks for everyone involved in it. Nothing really stands out from the franchise that seems to be getting worse as time goes by. It just doesn't have the charm and fun of the previous films.",1199664000,4,3554,4.744336569579288

2970455,2,B000WGYMTM,"I remember thinking, when this movie came out.....Not too sure if I want to go and pay $8 at the movie theater, but I will see it when it comes out on DVD (rent not purchase). I added that to my ever growing list of ""movies to rent"" and forgot about it. So imagine my delight when I saw that it was on by Demand (what I think is the best invention in years...no lines, no waiting to see the movie, just sit at home and order it). Now I already knew that the Rush Hour movies are similar to the Matrix movies in that, you can't wait for the next one to come out, but deep down you know that it couldn't possibly be as good as the first. I see Chris Tucker around Atlanta on occassion, and even remember seeing him do standup locally before he was in Friday....he is usually very funny. But in Rush Hour 3, with a few pounds (and I know we all have gained them) he just wasn't as funny as he usually is. And the usual farter that happens between he and Jackie Chan didn't appear as effortless as in the previous installments of the Rush Hour series. And it is obvious that Jackie has aged as well because we were not privy to as many fighting scenes as he normally gives us.

Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan)and LAPD Detective Carter (Chris Tucker) have made a promise to the daughter of the Ambassador (again) that they will discover who shot her father while he was attempting to uncover the identity of the leader of an elusive secret organization. Pursuiting leads to Paris, we see the merry, yet reluctant pair bantering about their friendship and trying to understand who is behind everything. Tucker meets a beautiful woman, and Chan discovers something about a family member that he just doesn't want to accept while having several dangerous encounters with a knife carrying woman.

I gave this movie a 2 for the following reasons: (1) there were so many references to past Rush Hour movies, that if you have never seen the previous movies, you would have no idea who and what they were talking about. Even the main storyline....the one involving the ambassador referred back to the 1st movie. So when Tucker kept referring to the little girl and then a young adult hugged him, most people would probably not know what was going on. The references to Chan's Secret Service Agent girlfriend, and other mishaps were from other movies. Perhaps it would have been better had they created a movie that could have stood alone. (2) I have grown tired of Chris Tucker acting silly during times when he shouldn't. I would have preferred Tucker to really dig his teeth in the roll and really come up with something original, especially since it seems that he will only do Chan movies (these have been the only movies he has done in the last few years). What I do like about all of these Rush Hour Moviews are the outtakes at the end. They are always as funny, if not funnier than the movie.",1199491200,,2881,4.444234404536862
2970486,3,B000WGYMTM,"I loved the first Rush Hour, and found the second to be amusing enough to purchase.  This one however, just fell flat.  The action scenes were not of the caliber, quality or ingenuity of the previous films, or of a standard Jackie Chan film.  And as for the comedy, it really wasn't that funny.  The movie felt as if large parts of the dialogue were unscripted in the hopes that Chris Tucker would ""Say something funny"" which never happened.  Sure there were a few lines that made me smile, but nothing made me actually laugh.  The plot would have been okay if it hadn't been used already in a previous Rush Hour (spoiler: bad guy is posing as a friend who sent you to get bad guy in first place) then you add in the tired old ""It's his brother/sister/dad"" part of the plot, which I hope was not supposed to be a twist, because I figured it out as soon as they introduced him.

The biggest problem with this movie is that it is a rehash of Rush Hour 1 without everything that made Rush Hour 1 so charming, which was watching the two of them get to know eachother.  Chan takes the back seat in this picture to Tucker who, for some reason seems to be wandering blindly through the movie.  The only good addition to the film was the French Cab Driver.  Other than that, we just have a bunch of Tucker and Chan getting threatened, running away, getting caught, bursting into song, being attacked, chasing bad guys and bursting into song again.  Which seems like the formula for most good action flicks (other than the bursting into song part) only this one just doesn't fit together as well and doesn't have the heart that the others did.

Is the movie overall terrible?  No, it's okay for a Saturday afternoon on TV.  I am just dissapointed by the overwhelming mediocreness of the whole film.

2970490,3,B000WGYMTM,"I stand by my belief that Chris Tucker is one of funniest actors out their right now.  Sure, not all of his film choices showcase the range I believe he possesses but the surface funny he brings to each and every performance is undeniable.  From the opening sequence to `Rush Hour 3' where Tuckers Carter is dancing in the streets we know that whether or not this film stacks up to the previous films is null and void, we are still going to laugh.

Well, does it stack up?

Sadly, `Rush Hour 3' (good lord, this really is the year of the trilogy isn't it) is not as good as it predecessors, but like I mentioned, it still brings some funny.  Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan reprise their roles as partners in crime (or crime-prevention) James Carter and Lee.  I had heard rumors before this film began filming that Chan was out and they were thinking of replacing him with another Asian actor.  I'm so thankful that this was not the case.  Had it been I would not have seen this film.  I don't believe in changing actors within a franchise.  Let's just say that as much as I loathe `Spider Mess 3' I'll see any film in the series UNLESS its stars are replaced.  Why do you think no one saw `XXX - State of the Union'?

My point exactly.

The plot behind `Rush Hour 3' is not really anything new.  In fact I could swear the same thing was done in `Rush Hour 2' or was it the original, but whatever, it's nothing new that's for sure.  The Ambassador Han from the first film is nearly assassinated and Lee and Carter try and track down the men responsible (someone very close to Lee) only to have Han's daughter (now all grown up) kidnapped in the process (yes, just like the first film).  Now Lee and Carter have to save her.  They threw in the search for Shai Shen but even that seems vaguely familiar.  Like I said, nothing original, which is a shame since they have had a LONG time to work up something better.  `Rush Hour 3' comes off a bit, what's the word, oh yeah...rushed.  Despite the long lapse in time from the filming of the second film to this installment it feels as if it was thrown together in weeks, not years.  Obviously this was not mulled over and thought through entirely.

The action scenes are still thrilling and Chris Tucker is hilarious.  Jackie Chan has never really been the funny bone of the series, even though he has had his moments.  He has less of them here, but Tucker always knows when to pick up the slack.

`Rush Hour 3' is predictable and uninspiring but it's funny; mindless funny fun.  I wouldn't necessarily `rush' to the rental store to check it out but if you want to complete the series (I doubt there will be a forth installment) then by all means check it out without fear or hesitation.  No, it's not as good as the first two, but it's not a buzz-kill either.  You'll laugh, I promise.",1199232000,,2827,4.343511450381679

Like an earlier review, I feel that when it comes to the Rush Hour series you pretty much know what you can come to expect. Many laughs, a predictable story line and action.  The 3rd installment provides all of the above.  I think the movie is good, but not great. I am a strong believer that the 1st installment in any series is typically the best because it is original and one doesn't know often what to expect. I am giving it 5 stars because it gave me what I expect.  Jackie and Chris work well together.  I do feel that this series lacked an in-depth storyline. I do think that a Rush Hour 4 should not be produced not because of a lack of laughs or action but because of storyline. I really don't know how much further in storyline the producers can go. Nevertheless, from the moment I sat down to when I got up, I laughed, and there was action throughout.

2970493,2,B000WGYMTM,"I liked the first Rush Hour a lot.  The second one wasn't as fantastic but since they changed the location it made things kind of fresh.  I think they went for the same formula on the third one by taking them to France after being in LA for a while but it just wasn't entertaining.

Sure, there were a few spots of humor here and there.  When a French cab drivers insults Halle Barry in front of Chris Tucker his reaction made me laugh out loud.  However, this movie just never grabbed me.

To be honest, this reminds me of this great teacher I had.  When I first took his class he was funny and entertaining.  What made him really stand out was his great repertoire of one-liners that had the classroom rolling.  So when he was teaching another class I was excited to sign up and found that his silliness started wearing off on me and his ""great repertoire"" was actually the same old jokes from the previous class.  Though there wasn't anything different, it was just boring anyways.

This movie is like that.  There wasn't anything to keep this fresh, it was just a rehashing of the first two movies again.  Even references to ""Mu shoo"" were there like the makers thought we would still be laughing at that joke.  Come on, its old now.  The only thing they did to try and keep this fresh was filming it in Europe but I think this movie needed more.  Even Shrek needed to bring in new sidekicks to keep things fresh.

In the end, I never finished this movie.  Halfway though my son asked me if I wanted to play Guitar Hero and I thought that would be more entertaining.  After a few days I realized I never finished the movie and then realized again I had no desire to.

Unless Rush Hour still tickles your fancy I'd just avoid this one.  Others described it as watchable and I think that is the nicest thing I can say about this movie.  I mean, it wasn't horrible it just wasn't good.",1199145600,8,1886,4.313390313390314

After seeing Rush Hour 3 in theatres this year I was puzzled how the ending in this trilogoy seemed oddly short and how there was no actual Roselyn Sanchez in the film except for a photo even though she was credited on imdb. Well I knew I'd find some information about this when the DVD come out so my aim was to get the DVD for the commentary and deleted scenes. After watching the deleted/alternate scenes and commentary I am disappointed at the choices the producer and director took for this film. But before I get to that I found the producer and director's commentary to be disoriented as neither person seemed to remember much about the origins of the scenes in the film, nor remember the actors names or each other. Yes, Roselyn Sanchez is in this movie but she's in the alternate ending, which if you watch this DVD for that alternate ending you will be wondering why the producers didn't go with that ending instead of what the theatrical film contains, but surprisingly there's no understable reason given by the commentary as to why the alternate ending wasn't used except the mentioning that they were high during this shooting.

Not joking. The same crazy slapstick action comedy with Chan's brand of fighting and Chris tuckrts wise cracks and comic style. There is some story of the Hong Kong triads in Paris thrown in to make a ""rush hour 3"" (Why the hell are there chineese people in Paris ?) Some lousy story I did not even bother to follow the story line. I was there just to see the Jackie and Chris chemistry but I was surprised that I was so jaded with the stuff that I have seen twice already. All unreal stuff. Neither Chris or Jackie get bruised or wounded. They gleefully miss bullets, they bounce of 2 story jumps with just a scraped knee. No broken ribs. No broken bones. Lethal weapon gave some realism to violence in that Mel and Danny suffer bruises. They feel some pain. But this movie feels more like a cartoon but then again the movie is a continuation of the successful franchise set in motion with the first rush hour but with this movie it has exploited the last ounce of the ""rush hour"" barrel. It was like seeing the part 1 and part 2 again. Back then rush hour 1 was new and had an innovative feel to it but 2 and 3 got me so bored as after rush hour 1 we knew the tricks and gags that we could expect so it was just a question of Chris and jackie doing their big jumps, char chases, bickering and  Chris tucker's moon walk and michael jackson or prince like singing/dance impression. What prompted me to watch the movie also was that it is directed by Brett Ratner who did Xmen3 and I loved his vision and style of Xmen3 so I wanted to see what he did with Rush Hour 3 but RH franchise is so used up that even Brett could not instill any new life into an already dead doll.

Lee and Tucker are thrust back together to try and track down the villain(s).

The usual suspects pop up, including an old ""brother""of Lee's named Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada) and a diplomat named Varden Reynard (Max von Sydow,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Seventh-Seal/dp/6305174083/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Seventh Seal</a>).

A secret society. Carter and Lee get in way over their heads. They battle impossible foes doing equally impossible feats of daring duo all while being sprite, charming and funny.

In the end, they come out smelling like roses.

The end.

Rumors of filming a fourth Rush Hour film immediately after this third installment were apparently scrapped due to unknown reasons, but one could easily venture that failing interest in the series hamstrung such a project (but who knows ...maybe there will be a fourth).

Tucker and Chan still have a unique chemistry on-screen, one a speed talking black man and the other a soft talking Chinese gentleman. The blooper out-takes on the DVD are worth watching to check out Chan's difficulties with various English translations and his physical accident while trying to throw a piece of furniture with his legs (I've heard tell that he broke his sternum during that take. Ouch!).

Plenty of eye-candy awaits those guys who like to see marvelously curvaceous women whom you normally would only see air-brushed on magazine covers. Most notably is French actress Nomie Lenoir who plays Genevieve, a dancer with a very special head on her shoulders.

2970525,3,B000WGYMTM,"Remarkably redundant and yet still entertaining, Brett Ratner's ""Rush Hour 3"" brings back the exhilaratingly hilarious Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker duo. The villains are clich and ill-contrived, and the story is a mess of unnecessary subplots and meaningless back-story, but clearly comedy is key. From the first moments of the film to the predictable last, Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker demand attention and we willingly comply. The fight sequences are creatively uncommon, and the comedic chemistry between Chan and Tucker never ceases to amuse and amaze. By the time you've seen all three Rush Hour films, you won't be able to decipher the events from one to another, but you'll still be more than satisfied at having watched them.

Chief Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) and LAPD Detective Carter (Chris Tucker) are back in the U.S. to avenge Ambassador Han who is nearly assassinated when he attempts to disclose information about the ultra secretive crime syndicate, the Triads. Their investigation brings them to Paris where mysterious nightclub dancer Genevieve (Noemie Lenoir) may be the only clue to uncovering the assassination plot and the marks against their lives. Lee must also come to terms with his longtime friend Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada) who may be on the wrong side of the law and at the heart of the conspiracy.

Rush Hour 3 wastes no time leaping straight into action and comedy, which perfectly recreates the tone and mood of the first two films. Despite the fact that the story takes a backseat to the action, and the general events that occur are overly repetitious amongst the trilogy, it doesn't attempt to camouflage itself as anything more than meets the eye. Perhaps most disappointing is the predictability of the antagonists and the nearly identical counterpart demises and plot twists.

All the principle players return, including a few surprises, such as references to Isabella from Rush Hour 2 and a grown up Soo Yung, and even minor supporting characters such as the police chief. But the spotlight still unquestionably belongs to Tucker and Chan. While Chan is famous for his extraordinary martial arts skills and the fact that he does all of his own stunts, his age is beginning to interfere with the vigor and intensity of the stunts he's willing to attempt. Less spectacular fight sequences are replaced by humorous events choreographed into action - even green-screen work that demonstrates risibly illogical stunts make a disappointing appearance. Chan at least knows how to be creative with his fighting, and in his familiar fashion, makes use of tables, chairs and random props to engage in comical battle. The most impressive stunts are those of the villains who pursue the duo across the streets of Paris in fantastic van and motorcycle chases. It is refreshing to see violence portrayed in such a facetious manner and yet still be equally amusing and precarious. Tucker uses his fast-talking mouth instead of brawn, and while the first two films create a mild distaste for his brand of obnoxiousness, here it is channeled directly toward villains, so the audience can wholeheartedly side with his boisterous blathering.

The Rush Hour films have always been a series of action and comedy sequences loosely strung together by plot. It's as if the gags are derived first; the story often feels trite and unoriginal and Rush Hour 3 is no exception. But the chemistry between Tucker and Chan reaches a new high, and the sensational setting of ""The City of Lights"" allows for a whole new slew of racial jokes and political incorrectness. A ""Who's on first?"" routine (obviously inspired by Abbott and Costello), a prim nun translating foul language, and George the anti-American French taxi driver are examples of witty additions to the familiarly mischievous comedy showcased in the series. The inclusion of supermodel Noemie Lenoir is terribly expected, and screen legend Max Von Sydow can't seem to summon life into his predictable role. A showdown on the Eiffel Tower and the amazingly hilarious signature outtakes are other high points, but Kenji's forced villainy and pathetic character development remind us that Rush Hour 3 is a simple film with un-ambitious goals. While nothing is terribly memorable or awe-inspiring, constant bits of crudeness and slapstick humor make the occasion worthwhile even if you can't remember enough funny moments to tell your friends.

2970555,3,B000WGYMTM,"As you know, ""Rush Hour"" series have become popular action comedy series, and it is no surprise that the third installment is finally released. Now, if you want to see a Jackie Chan ""action"" film like me, perhaps you should forget ""Rush Hour 3"" and rent a DVD of his Hong-Kong-made films whatever that may be. ""RH3"" is more like a comedy film starring Chris Tucker (OK, and I'm not saying that is bad).

I am not going to talk about the script by Jeff Nathanson (""Catch Me If You Can"" fame"") which is about buddy-buddy adventure, beautiful ladies in France and the Chinese triad. In short, there is nothing new about it, but Jackie Chan's films are not known for tight storytelling or coherence, so that is OK. What is disappointing is the lack of actions, real ones.

I know Chan is now over 50 and that Hollywood studios would not allow him to do death-defying stunts like in Hong Kong. Still Chan can still do interesting tricks with his clever use of props (see his recent films like ""The Myth""), but his actions here are diminished to only several scenes where no his fast punches or kicks are included. Also, some shots of his agile movements are often cut and edited in the middle of his actions. The climax sword fight scene too does not look as thrilling and exciting as it should be partly because it is interrupted by another fight scene by Tucker, and partly because it does not have imaginative choreography.

The names of internationally assorted supporting actors are interesting, but only a few of them are given chance to show what they really can do. Hiroyuki Sanada who plays the baddie (recently seen in ""The Last Samurai"" and ""Sunshine"") can do much better than what he shows here (he was a famous action star in Japan during the late 70s and early 80s), but somehow we get only one action scene from him and Chan. Yuki Kudo (""Snow Falling on Cedars"" ""Memoirs of a Geisha"") is also a talented actress, but sadly her talent is somehow wasted in the same way as Zhang Ziyi in ""Rush Hour 2."" But what do you expect from director Brett Ratner who cast Zhang Ziyi as bomb-carrying assassin?

Tzi Ma and Philip Baker Hall briefly appear just to remind us that this is a sequel. Max Von Sidow, Yvan Attal, Roman Polanski show up, but have little to do. Sun Ming Ming also appears as ""Kung Hu Giant,"" nod to Bruce Lee film ""Game of Death"" and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, which is one of the funniest parts of the film.

Once again, if you want to see an action film, maybe you should try first ""Rush Hour."" And as comedy, yes, I laughed a few times, or maybe more, but sorry, not much enough. Maybe that is because I didn't like Chris Tucker's loud character, or I no longer feel the interaction between Chan and Tucker as fresh as before. Or probably it is because I still don't understand why it took about 6 years for New Line Cinema to make this enjoyable, but too light-weight film, and that's with Jackie Chan, one of the greatest action stars in the world, as Tucker's side kick.",1188000000,2,2992,4.472527472527473

As you can tell from the synopsis, you can't take this movie too seriously. If you are expecting good action scenes and funny jokes then you will like Rush Hour 3. If you are expecting an Oscar worthy drama, then prepare to be dissapointed.

Rush hour three is worse then ace ventura, but better then Starsky and hutch.",1187913600,3,636,4.5701754385964914

Like the two previous installments in the series, ""Rush Hour 3"" is an uneven mixture of low-ball humor and kick-ass action, with the amazingly nimble and athletic Jackie Chan once again playing the karate-chopping straight man to Chris Tucker's wisecracking cynic.

In this edition, detectives Carter and Lee go from the mean streets of LA to the cafes and sewers of Paris to find and protect a French woman who possesses information of great value to some sort of secret international organization.  Since the plot feels as if it were pretty much hammered out in a late night storyboarding conference, the filmmakers are forced to rely even more heavily on the charisma of the two lead actors than they did before; luckily, Chan and Tucker, intrepid troopers that they are, pretty much deliver what is asked of them in that regard.

I wish I could say the same for the screenplay by Jeff Nathanson and the direction by Brett Ratner.  For the most part, however, the humor in ""RH3"" is sub standard and derivative - a pale imitation of the classic ""Who's on First?"" comedy routine is particularly unfortunate and embarrassing - and the action sequences are not much better, until, that is, a spectacular fight scene between Chan and Lee's evil brother, played by Hiroyuki Sanada, set high atop the Eiffel Tower that finally brings the movie to life in its closing stretches.

For movie historians, the only real element of note here is the presence of legendary director Roman Polanski as an overzealous French inspector, and acting bulwark Max Von Sydow as World Criminal Court Director Varden Reynard.  As to the latter, what can one say about a career path that starts off with ""The Seventh Seal,"" then passes through something like ""Rush Hour 3"" on the way to its final destination?

The scenes shift from Chicago to Paris, where the secret to the Tongs lies. This movie has a woman assassin who throws sharp objects at the boys. She is nowhere as intriguing as the female assassin from movie #2.

Here's what's good: the action scenes. I've always enjoyed the choreography of Jackie Chan's fight/flight scenes. But even these parts of the film are marred. For one thing, Chris Tucker intrudes on most of these parts without actually doing anything more than saying unfunny things (i.e: ""I know he's your brother, but make him into your sister!""). The other thing is, well, I suspect Chan has finally gone the way of stunt doubles for some of the work--and some of it is clearly enhanced by CGI.

The movie also insults the viewer with plot threads that don't make sense. Case in point, Chan and Tucker hijack a French cabbie at gunpoint--at gunpoint, mind you--and then, when they go into some random location to do some more fighting, they tell the cabbie to wait ... and he does! Come on, now. Puh-leease.

But the main thing is, there are maybe two or three funny parts in the whole darn movie, and that's not sustaining, not even for a shortie like this one. It's too bad. I liked the first two movies.

However, not is all pleasant, and Han gets shot by whom appears to be Lee's brother Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada). It doesn't end well, what with Carter getting in the way and letting Kenji escape. After hearing that another World Criminal Court Summit in Paris, France will be the next target of attack, Carter and Lee take off to France to beat the Triads. The duo also meet an angry cab driver (Max von Sidow), a flamboyant French detective (Roman Pulanski), and a nightclub performer (Nomie Lenoir).

Due to a six-year wait, there's no doubt that ""Rush Hour 3"" couldn't have come out at a worse time. There was that whole drama with Chris Tucker aiming to get extra billing and the go-ahead to executive produce. Meanwhile, the action-comedy genre changed in different ways after Edgar Wright sended up the genre with ""Hot Fuzz"". Brett Ratner may not be able to overcome all these obstacles (except for Tucker, who still can wring out a laugh after six years in abscence), but he still offers a delectable entr that refuses to bow down in terms of entertainment.

""RH3"" may also have to live up to the second installment.

Lee ran across it, while Carter just fell into it some times. It also helped win a best action scene at the 2002 MTV Movie Awards. Oh, and that film had a more rambunctious playground for Chan and Tucker to improv and break apart.

Things calmed down with ""RH3"", at least for the beginning. As usual, Carter and Lee are traveling across various places in LA and Paris, running into a very large kung fu teacher (played by Sun Ming Ming), running into a brothel (a very funny scene where Carter thinks Lee is tearing an Asian girl's butt up), dealing with the angry cab driver, and a couple more situations that I dare not give away.

Ratner can also film a couple good action scenes, with inspirations from John Woo (much like in the first one, Carter gets to fire two guns a la Chow Yun Fat, which shows Chris Tucker's newfound acrobatic skills that were hinted in ""Rush Hour 2"") to the Bruce Lee/Kareem Abdul Jabar film ""Game of Death"" (the aforementioned episode with Sun Ming Ming and Chris Tucker). The latter one, while not gut-bustingly funny, is very creative on Ratner's part. Hey, this guy did a good job in the last ""X-Men"" movie, so never doubt his Midas touch of directing solid scenes that rouse.

Even after six years, Chan and Tucker are still strong with their chemistry. Chan, even at the age of 53, is still capable of kicking up the action (pun intended) and offering some of the film's funniest lines (that even includes the outtakes, where he offers choices of what ""dirty movie"" he should play). Tucker hasn't waned much either, despite some old-hat lines that would've held up better in the '90s (especially during his love scene with Nomie Lenoir), what with his hilarious rendition of a classic Prince song and a funny musical number with Chan. Put these two together, and really, what could possibly go wrong?

For the finale, Ratner kicks things up a notch or two with an amazing fight scene at the Eiffel Tower. The director hardly overcompensates any lack of flair (though Industrial Light & Magic fills in any empty vessels in case of emergency), nor does Chan, as his swash-buckling with Hiroyuki Sanada is a sight to behold. I don't know if it will get any nods at next year's MTV Movie Awards, but it perfectly sums up the experience one viewer will have watching ""RH3"". Ratner may have to ride backseat of Edgar Wright, but I was genuinely happy with what he had to offer, and I hope it doesn't fade away any time soon.",1186704000,2,4163,4.611336032388664

This is a martial arts comedy and as such you know there is going to be some level of sillyness and not expect it to move you all that much. It's an action movie after all.  If there were no fight scenes would we even go watch it at all?  If you liked the other two movies you will like this one too. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker work well together and kept me laughing. Sure there are some parts in the movie that are vulgar. But really, are you expecting a martial arts movie to be like kids Disney movie?
I'm not sure why people are judging the movie against what it never was intended to be.  If you don't like martial arts movies then why would you watch this in the first place?  If you don't like stupid humor comedy, again why would you even watch it?  It's not going to win an academy award for the best drama it's a martial arts comedy, indented to make you laugh and awe you with Jackie Chan's amazing fighting ability.

The script, pacing, and characters leave much to be desired. The highlights. The cinematography. Jackie can still climb and jump. The outtakes are the best part of this film. Hilarity ensues and Jackie getting smashed with table in the chest is the most impressive yet disturbing outtake I've seen in Jackie's films.",1469232000,,480,4.795180722891566
3204297,4,B000WGYMTM,"I'm docking this film one star because it upset my wife so much.  She found Chris Tucker's womanizing, low class, black supremacist character (Officer Carter) annoying in all three Rush Hour movies, but he was particularly vulgar in this one, in an exchange with a French-speaking detainee and a Catholic nun for an interpreter, in which he made an oral sex joke about one of the detainee's female relatives whom he (Carter) had never actually, of course, met.  He later tells Lee that Lee can't be black, because there's ""a height requirement.""

Not to mention how Carter picked up two young women for himself and Detective Lee, quid pro quo, for leniency in a traffic stop in New York City, where he had been demoted to traffic cop after ruining Lee's chances of having sex with the Secret Service Agent they met in Rush Hour 2, by shooting her in the neck and leaving her disabled for the rest of her life.  When he picks Lee up in his car, with the two young women on board, he tells Lee that ""the fat one"" is his.  By then, Carter had already ""fat shamed"" the girl for weighing significantly more than her Driver's License indicated.

As in Rush Hour 2, there is plenty of eyecandy in this film.  For starters, the Chinese Consul's daughter has developed, as Carter quickly notes, a need for a bra in the past nine or ten years since he last saw her.  (No, they did not use the same actress nine years later.  The little girl was played by Julia Hsu in the 1998 film, and by Jingchu Zhang in this sequel, released in 2007.) Then the three of them go to Paris where they meet a showgirl named Genevieve, played by Noemie Lenoir, and a bevy of other showgirls, whom Carter undresses and redresses like dolls, under the ruse that he's their costume designer.  For those who like older, Oriental women, there's a villainous Dragon Lady, played by Yuki Kudo, Noemie's senior by eight years in reality.  Other fetishes are pandered to, as Noemie repeatedly displays her bald head with a tattoo on the back of it, making Carter think she is a man, although she emphatically and repeatedly insists that she's a woman.

Upon arrival in Paris, both Carter and Lee get beaten by the local police, whose Chief probes their anuses with a large ring on one of his fingers.  After walking bowlegged out of the police Chief's building, they get in a taxi cab with a French driver who hates Americans, and reappears throughout the film, badmouthing us, including a particularly poignant remark about not being an American and knowing ""what it's like to kill people for no reason.""  Presumably, this remark was included to advance the liberal gun control agenda, in spite of the extensive use of innumerable firearms by ""the good guys"" as well as the ""bad,"" throughout all of the Rush Hour films.

This French reception by their police reminds me of a similar scene in Jet Li's, Kiss of the Dragon.  Apparently, the French police have a reputation for being exceptionally corrupt and brutal, albeit ineffective, like the Pink Panther's Inspector Clouseau, as demonstrated by the recent massacres perpetuated by Moslems on their soil.  And Carter thought the L.A.P.D. was bad!

Besides tearing Paris apart and base jumping off of the Eiffel Tower with a makeshift parachute made out of a French flag, Lee and Carter (SPOILER ALERT!) rescue the girl and punch the French Police Chief in the face, after the taxi driver saves their lives.  But only after flushing themselves literally down a Parisian sewer...  Liberal Hollywood entertainers seem to have an obsession with excrement as well as homosexuality and gun control.",1469059200,,3608,4.733226837060703

3204335,4,B000WGYMTM,"This seemed like a somewhat forced attempt to create a trilogy for a series that really did not need one.  It, of course, brings back Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker and director Brett Ratner for the third installment of the buddy cop franchise.  The main focus is still the Lee/Carter relationship and elevating them from friend status to that of family.  Overall though the characters are what they are, and there is really no more room to develop them.

This time the bulk of the story involves the characters in France, trying to track down the list of the leaders of the Triad.  The scene stealer of the movie is anti-American sentiments from a cab driver (Yvan Attal) who eventually becomes an important and funny ally. Carter gets the girl in this movie, played by the gorgeous  (Noemie Lenoird) who is more important than she initially seems. There are also supporting roles by Max Von Sydow  and another great martial arts movie alum Hiroyuki Sanada, whom Ratner had to basically beg to return to the genere.  There are also tie backs to the first movie involving counsel Han, now Ambassador Han and his daughter.

Ultimately the Rush hour movies are what they are.  While I do not necessarily think this movie had to be made, chances are if you loved or enjoyed the first two, you will probably like this one too, although maybe not as much.  If you were lukewarm to the first two, then you may not like this one all that much.  For extras, you get a lot.  There is a commentary track on the movie by Ratner and the screen writer, trailers for the movie, and a second disc filled with a couple hours worth of making of and behind the scenes features and a production diary, which basically followed from the first day of shooting to the last.  It was interesting hearing Ratner describe doing the things in this one that he wanted to have in the others, like Chris Tucker getting beat up by a bunch of kids in a Karate Studio, a ""Reverse Game of Death"" type fight scene with a Chinese giant etc.  If you like going through bonus material you will really like all you get here.

I cannot say the movie will appeal to everyone, but if you have enjoyed the first two, I would say it is worth checking out.",1463270400,4,2206,4.4775

3204538,1,B000WGYMTM,"It was sloppy put together movie.  Nothing says it faster than the first 5 minutes of watching the movie.  You usually know in those 5 minutes where the director's heart was at. Not in making this movie.  Sadly, it seemed directed for money, not artistry.  I get annoyed with Chris Tucker playing an irresponsible self absorbed traffic cop dancing on the main road leading to a traffic disaster.  How is this funny??  It was annoying.  Nothing like the first 2 movies where Chris Tucker starts off as a crime busting cop.  Why is Chris tucker a traffic cop now? Wow.  And why is Jackie chan even having a prolonged, NOT funny, dialog about his girlfriend Isabella from Rush hour 2.  Terrible.  I'm a jackie chan fan but this was pretty bad.  The script was Very bad because who really cares about the plot.  They main characters look for Xia Xian throughout half the movie, and I didn't have the feeling like I cared enough about the cause it to follow the movie through.  Just roughly thrown together movie.  Surprisingly, the writers were the same as the previous movie so I was thinking to myself, ""What in the hell happened?""  There was no heart and spontaneous comedy in making this movie.  It was like constant ramblings from both actors that shot back and forth to make this movie seem so dull.",1427500800,,1301,4.586956521739131

3204662,3,B000WGYMTM,"Rush Hour 3(2007) does manage to please, but the magic is gone. This Rush Hour movie raises the violence and some of the storytelling is contrived. This Rush Hour movie experiments with vulgar humor! Inspector Lee talks about ordering a porno film in one scene. Chan is forcefed some awful dialouge in the movie. Rush Hour 3 takes place in Paris, France, yet it is a rehash of the first film. This is typical Hollywood product. Still, this movie is worth a rental or buying on DVD and Blu Ray if you have the cash! Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker return as Lee and Carter. I think Brett Ratner is the ""real star"" of this movie! The film's trailer uses a record scratch when someone tells a lame joke! The ""Chinglish"" scene was funny. There's rumors that a Rush Hour 4 is in the works. Rush Hour 3 is fun, but not the best Rush Hour installment.",1359936000,2,841,4.3630573248407645

3204705,1,B000WGYMTM,"In this movie, in our opinion, the movie makers made Jackie Chan's character out to be a real loser in his role of law enforcement officer.  He pursued and caught the man who had just shot the ambassador, and then let him walk away.  The fact he considered this man to be like a brother should not have interfered with him performing his duty.  Later in the film, Lee tells this man that the reason he had not shot him was because he (Lee) is not an assassin.  What a bunch of hooey!  My husband and I really enjoyed Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2, so we thought 3 would be at least as good.  Wrong!  Overall, this movie was a huge disappointment for us.",1345075200,3,649,4.144

""Rush Hour"" was quite amusing in a strange way, I followed it up the next night with ""Rush Hour 2"" and it was very much the same way, except less so. Maybe I was burning out. So I took a break. Last night, my movie was ""Rush Hour 3."" Alas, I was very disappointed. It was just a weak imitation of the previous two.

""Rush Hour 3"" takes place largely in Paris, in contrast to Los Angeles and Hong Kong of the previous two, and is centered about the Eiffel Tower. Well, why not? It would give rise to some spectacular stunt scenes. Alas, the stunts are just not that good and nowhere near  the things observed in the original ""Rush Hour."" The  story is inconsequential, disorganized, and hard to follow. Well, who follows the story in these things anyway? The fights are somewhat weak relative to some in the earlier movies. After a while (the first half hour) I began to find the movie tedious. Then boredom set in and I began to wonder when it would ever end. And it just wasn't that funny either. I'd have to say that the series had run out of ideas, or it's always possible that I just burned out on an interesting and once-fresh idea.

3204712,3,B000WGYMTM,"Unsatisfying is the nicest thing I can say about this third entry in an otherwise entertaining series.  It's obvious that they've remade the first film too many times.  Chris Tucker was enjoyable, as usual, and kept up his end of the proceedings.  Jackie Chan, unfortunately, was another matter.  I just couldn't get past the gloomy pall he put on this outing by abruptly turning dour and remorse at the most inopportune of times (he would no doubt argue that he needed to go ""dramatic"" because of the awkward intrusion of a non-brother, brother who popped out of his past).  I'd counter with that being the exact moment you'd need to go funny.  Hello, he wasn't your real brother, he was a bad guy...oh wait, didn't they pull that ruse in RH #2?  (They also reused another gambit employed in the first movie only this time he was played by Max von Sydow.)  The ""who's on first"" routine with ""me & you"" was desperate but Chris Tucker forced it into funny, not so funny was the bizarre rant against Americans in the French taxi; it left me wondering who they were trying to skewer, the French or us.  And speaking of French, so much of the dialog could/should have been translated with subtitles.  The worst offense though was the disconcerting (some would say creepy) inclusion of exiled director Roman Polanski as a brutal cop.  My jaw dropped on that one.  What were they thinking!
This movie is a little above inept.  I did enjoy parts of it, some of the chase scenes/fight scenes, other parts were simply repetitious.  It's a keeper only because it's part of a set.  If it was a standalone movie, I'd ditch it in a heartbeat.

Sadly, there is word of a possible Rush Hour 4.",1300665600,,1678,4.561872909698996

3204726,5,B000WGYMTM,"I just saw Rush Hour 3 for the first time on TBS, and as a fan of the far more superior first two installments, I rather enjoyed this latest outing.

Sure, it got hammered by critics upon its theatrical release in 2007, and its box office returns, while robust, failed to live up to the expectations set by its predecessors. Granted, the plot is quite thin, and the series no longer has the new car smell of the first film.

But for me, it was fun to see Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker back in action. Chan as Hong Kong Inspector Lee and Tucker as LAPD Detective Carter make a great action-comedy buddy-cop duo. In fact, they are my favorite such pair. They still have great chemistry and play off each other very well. They are as hilarious in this movie as they are in the first two, especially as always in the outtakes.

Series director Brett Ratner is no slouch behind the camera, either. He has crafted yet another glossy, globetrotting affair, with Carter and Lee tracking the lethal Chinese Triad gang from Los Angeles to Paris. There, our heroes run afoul of a wacky French cop played by Roman Polanski, get driven around town in wild car chases by a local taxicab driver who fulfills his lifelong fantasy of being an American superspy, and face off with the bad guys in a spectacular climactic showdown at the Eiffel Tower. My appetite is whetted for Rush Hour 4.

3204765,4,B000WGYMTM,"For those who have been fans of the previous two ""Rush Hour"" films, it had been six years since the second film and many people highly anticipating the reunion of Director Brett Ratner (""X-Men: The Last Stand"", ""Red Dragon"" and ""Money Talks"") and talents Jackie Chan (""Supercop"", ""Shanghai Noon"" and ""The Forbidden Kingdom"") and Chris Tucker (""Jackie Brown"", ""Money Talks"" and ""The Fifth Element"").

Joining Brett is fellow ""Rush Hour 2"" screenwriter Jeff Nathanson (""The Terminal"", ""Catch Me If You Can"" and ""Speed 2: Cruise Control""), composer Lalo Schifrin (""Mission: Impossible"" films, ""Money Talks"" and ""The Sting II"") and cinematographer J. Michael Muro (""Southland"", ""Traitor"" and ""Crash"").

Because six years have passed, the film came out in the Summer of 2007 and with the excitement and comedy of the first two films, many fans were awaiting what would be in store for the third film.

The film was not exactly well-received by critics but ""RUSH HOUR 3"" is a film that manages to bring people to theaters who want a comedy/action flick to enjoy for the Summer.  The film which cost $140 million to make, grossed over $255 million worldwide and thus, paving way for a new ""RUSH HOUR 4"" film scheduled anywhere between 2010-2012.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

When ""RUSH  HOUR 3"" was released on Blu-ray back in December 2007, the Blu-ray release received the highest marks for its picture and audio quality.  With the Blu-ray release now over a year old, I am revisiting the film and seeing how it compares to the current releases of today.

The film sports a 1080p High Definition (2:35:1) transfer.  The film is definitely vibrant with many outdoor shots during the sunny day and detail featured during the Los Angeles and French scenes in the film.  The picture quality is not soft, lighting is definitely featured prominently in this film as its one thing to get vibrant colors during the outdoor scenes but in one nightclub scene, the colors that come through during the choreography screen shows how low-light combined with the various blue and purple lighting are equally vibrant and blacks are a nice and deep.

Even today, ""RUSH HOUR 3"" is still a vibrant looking film that retains its grain and overall, a great looking film on Blu-ray.

As for audio, I really enjoy these 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtracks and one thing you will notice from ""RUSH HOUR 3"" is that the soundtrack sounds absolutely nice.  Maybe not as much punch as a ""Quantum of Solace"" or ""Transformers: The Movie"" but the film manages to utilize all channels on my 7.2 system setup.  Rear surrounds are used primarily to enhance the music and certain sound effects which were nice.  Surrounds definitely made certain scenes feel immersive but for the most part, dialogue is clear (although some scenes by both Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan may be a bit difficult to understand at times and you may need to rewind the scene to better understand what is going on). Overall, a solid lossless audio soundtrack.

As for subtitles, subtitles are presented in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""RUSH HOUR 3' is definitely a Blu-ray release that deserves attention for picture and audio quality but the film also manages to include hours of special features which were quite enjoyable and all are featured in 1080p HD.

DISC 1:

  * Audio commentary by Director Brett Rather and Jeff Nathanson - People can listen to the commentary throughout the film or by enabling the Enhanced Visual Commentary which features both men in a picture-in-picture screen.  The Enhanced Visual Commentary didn't need any changing of Blu-ray audio setup like some Blu-rays will need for P-I-P display.  But as far as the commentary is concerned, both men go into the making of the film, working with Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker again and the other talents used in the film and much more.  A very entertaining commentary by both men.
  * Trailer - The original theatrical trailer for the film.

DISC 2:

  * Outtakes - (2:33) The outtakes from the film.
  * Deleted/Alternate Scenes - (7:12) People can watch seven deleted and alternate scenes including an alternate ending with optional commentary by Director Brett Ratner and Screenwriter Jeff Nathanson.  Here is what is included:  Extended Airplane, Extended Taxi, Extended Elevator, Hotel Hallway, Spotlight Guy: Follies, Extended Eiffel Tower, and Alternate Ending.  For the most part, both are rather humorous when discussing these scenes, scenes they wish they didn't cut out but most interesting is Ratner and Nathanson's discussion about the alternative ending and not sure why they created that.
  * Making of ""RUSH HOUR 3' - (1:28:10) Literally, the making of ""RUSH HOUR 3' from the script to the cast and the music.  Interviews with crew and talent and more.  Very in-depth featurette of what Nathanson wanted to accomplish with the script and what Ratner wanted to accomplish with the casting a worldwide talent of characters and more.  Here is what is included in this segment (can be watched ala ""View All"" or separately):

- The Story, The Script

- Casting the Rush

- Teaming Up

- Creating the Rush: Scene by Scene

- Cuts, Sound & Music

  * Visual Effects Reel - (2:03) An interesting look at various scenes and using digital characters instead of real life characters and going through scenes that looked real but were in CG.
  * Le Rush Hour Trois Production Diary -(1:05:05) A very candid look at Bret Ratner making ""Rush Hour 3' and the challenge the crew faced with the making of this film.  Including behind-the-scenes footage of certain scenes, what happened off camera and more.  Very fun to watch and informative.

EASTER EGGS:

There are two Easter Eggs.  The first is on Disc 2 and pressing up on ""Visual Effects Reel"" in the main menu.  You will see a logo show up and when you click on it, you will get a short video with Jackie Chan and Hiroyuki Sanada's characters fighting with light sabers.  The other is on subtitles and selecting the New Line Cinema logo to access credits for the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I really enjoyed ""RUSH HOUR"" and ""RUSH HOUR 2'.  Both films manage to showcase a good amount of humor and action and this odd couple manage to successfully bring in people to the theaters because you know that it's a fun film to watch.  Both Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are so unlike and they are the ultimate odd couple on screen but they manage to make it work.

But ""RUSH HOUR"" films are not films to expect a deep storyline.  If anything, there are many racial jokes on both sides of the film and as evident from the special features, there are lines that Jackie Chan has no idea what he's saying, nor does he know what they mean.

""RUSH HOUR 3' is simply a film that you just don't want to expect anything more from.  The laughs, the actions, the camaraderie are enough.

But with the Ratner and crew trying to come up with a new story six years later, I felt the movie felt as if it was rushed.  I felt that the duo dynamic was subdued. Similar to the ""Odd Couple"", these two are quite the opposites and both Lee and Carter who have now become good friends, like brothers was fine but it's been far too long since these Ratner, Chan and Tucker have worked with each other.

Chris Tucker did a fine role as Carter but for some reason, as much as I know Jackie Chan is a popular singer in Asia, I suppose that I wanted to see more action-based scenes with him rather than many singing scenes. It just seemed out of place. But knowing that Chan who was 53-years-old at the time, is not going to be doing a lot of action scenes as he did back in 1998 when the first film was released in theaters.  And if the fourth film is released in 2012, I'm not sure how much we can expect from, especially now as he wants to focus on serious films in Asia.

Also, I felt the character of George (The taxi driver) was a bit overused.  Fine for the first time but seeing him evolve as a character, again, with the film focused on Lee and Carter, seeing the character George being so prominent seemed a bit off.

Max von Sydow has always managed to have this mysterious allure to him.  From the 1975 film ""Three Days of the Condor"" to ""RUSH HOUR 3', the roles that he tends to play makes those familiar with his work automatically know where his character as Reynard is going to go.  But I felt there could have been much more potential with his character.

I really enjoyed Hiroyuki Sanada as Kenji.  His role as an action star in Japan was definitely showcased in ""RUSH HOUR 3'.  It was also great to see Ratner utilizing other worldwide talents such as Jingchu Zhang, Youki Kudoh and Noemie Lenoir.

But in the end, I was entertained by ""RUSH HOUR 3"".  There are some major laughs and action sequences in the film that manage to capture the soul of the ""RUSH HOUR"" films and on Blu-ray, you get a wonderful transfer with outstanding picture and audio quality and hours of special features which were enjoyable to watch.

For fans of the film or the trilogy, ""RUSH HOUR 3"" is a wonderful Blu-ray release.  Unfortunately, the film's storyline doesn't quite match the awesomeness of the Blu-ray release but nevertheless, it's a very entertaining, solid Blu-ray!  Definitely worth checking out!",1247702400,,9245,4.711970074812967
3204766,3,B000WGYMTM,"Well darn it, I never saw the first two, but loved the previews so wanted to check it out.  The DVD has both widescreen and fullscreen capabilities, but the ""special features"" are nothing to be excited about, previews and trailers.

Rush Hour 3 had some funny moments, starting with Chris Tucker directing traffic with Prince in his ears.  The sight jokes (girls butts on a car) and the fall-down gags got old after awhile.

Thin plot, some reality stretching and some characters left unexplained (the woman assassin was never explained and her demise was not missed, played by Sun Ming Ming.).

Favorites:  ""You're not my brother?"" -- to the tune of ""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word"".

""My name is you.  No not me.  I'm me.  Who's you?  I'm you.""  If you are familiar with Abbott and Costello's Who's on First, you're older than me!

Jackie's character knows he has an evil brother, who he tries to save even as his brother tries to kill  him anyway.  Amazing.  And Jackie loses nearly every fight scene and runs away.  Disappointing.

Mildly political, saying Americans only kill.  Hmmm....

3204767,3,B000WGYMTM,"The Bottom Line:

3204797,3,B000WGYMTM,"I am sorry folks, but after waiting over 6 years for the sequel to Rush Hour 2, I found this film to be disappointing.  I was underwhelmed by The stale gags that were very entertaining in Rush Hour 1&2 but were just stale in this one. Jackie Chan was actually Cris Tucker's sidekick here.  I would have liked a different plot that after such a time lag might have stood alone without the references to bits and pieces of the first 2 movies.
  The film opens with  Chris Tucker  directing traffic in a street cop uniform only to pick up a couple of girls.  Once again we see the Triad as a weak plot theme that brings us back to the Chinese ambassador and his now teen aged daughter with their lives in danger that the good Inspector Lee has to protect again.

 The friendly banter is not as funny between Chan and Tucker and although Jackie Chan can still do his own stunts, but  he is obviously not as young as he was when he was still doing his karate action stuff so the action sequences are more shoot em up and swinging from flying flags off the side of the Eifel Tower with a long lost ""brother"" from his past who we never heard about.  The Max Von Snydow character as the villain is underutilized as the French ambassador. And there is no plot tie up of loose ends.

If you like the Rush Hour films, the film is watchable not as entertaining as the previous films. Paying full price for it would be  frustrating.  I think Rush Hour 4 would be superfluous.",1217376000,,1462,4.2690909090909095
3204798,1,B000WGYMTM,"This is a far cry from the first successful opus, and further the previous success of Eddy Murphy. The story is bland, ultra-conventional and impossible to believe. The sub-zero degree of culture is achieved by the laudatory comments of the French popular papers ""Journal du Dimanche"" and ""Parisien"" that qualify this disaster, the back of the jacket of the DVD, ""hilarious"" and very funny"".

Furthermore, if this kind of American cinema had some finesse, he would have been able to make fun of French with intelligence. The criticism of France through the Atlanticist recurring themes of cowardice - our banned sacrifice in Iraq is still difficult to be understood the hawks bushists is vulgar and stupid.

Chris Tucker's character is just as annoying as before, although, he was bearable in the first two.  This one was a whole new level of annoyance.  Jackie Chan seemed tired.  He really should quit making these movies.  Don't get me wrong, I like Jackie Chan.  I think he is extremely talented and really brings alot to action movies.  But, when paired with someone who doesn't support him on screen, he loses that appeal.

Truly, the plot's a bit confusing. A diplomat who gets shot just as he was going to reveal the leaders of the Triads; a list of names tattooed on a woman's head; various factions after Lee and Carter and the woman and each other.

The action and jokes are pretty much what you'd expect if you've seen the first 2 movies. One of the bad guys, however, is Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada) Lee's ""brother"" (they'd grown up together), and that provides a nice bit of emotional conflict.

The other thing that distinguishes this movie from the first two is the Paris setting, with a cool action sequence on the Eiffel Tower, but mostly with the sneering Parisian cab driver George (Yvan Attal), who provides even more laughs and ends up making a surprising ally. The addition of his character to the Tucker/Chan duo kept it fresh, not unlike an old married couple with a new audience for their stories. I also really enjoyed his rather skewed view of America--it's not actually all that exaggerated.

It wasn't quite as good as the first two, but it was a fun way to spend an evening--we always enjoy Jackie Chan, even in his cheesiest movies (or maybe that's especially), and as my son's English teacher is won't to say, ""Chris Tucker is a funny man.""",1214265600,3,1478,4.587121212121212

I must comment that I was stunned by the comment someone made about age catching up with Jackie Chan.  He looks in top form to me, and I would like to see that reviewer do one-tenth of the acrobatics when he is JC's age.

Its a basic martial arts, buddy action comedy flick. that's it, and in that aspect, Rush Hour 3 delivers the goods. Granted, its not exactly oscar material, but then again it follows as a decent trilogy to the first 2. I would say the movie was a bit of a letdown more by the support actors apart from these two and the need to film it in Paris.

My favorite is the interrogation of the french triad member by these two in the prescence of the nun.

I really enjoyed Rush Hour 1 and 2. I thought the chemistry between the soft-spoken, but very acrobatic Jackie Chan and the motor-mouth Chris Tucker was very good for the first two films. The first Rush Hour worked well because we saw the culture change Jackie Chan experienced going to the United States and the second Rush Hour was humorous because we saw Chris Tucker experience the culture change in China. For the third and final act (hopefully final), both characters go to France, Europe to experience a new culture for both of them. However since Rush Hour 3 (2007) came nearly six years after Rush Hour 2 (2001) and Rush Hour 1 (1998), it seems the chemistry between Chan and Tucker dried up. I heard rumors that in real life the actors didn't like each other off screen.  Hard to believe if there was hatred between them when it looked fun while they were both singing and dancing to the ""War"" song in part one. If the rumors of their hatred for each other are true, than the efforts in part three can be justified.

Other than the fantastic stunt scene on the Eiffel Tower, Rush Hour 3 looked like a ""rushed"" effort done only to simply complete a trilogy that perhaps should have never been completed. It seems nowadays all movies that have a part two MUST have a part three so that a trilogy DVD set can be sold in the future. Other than humor that is practically non-existent in part three and no memorable antagonist or villain to counter Chan & Tucker not much worked well. I really wanted to enjoy part three despite the bad theatrical reviews it initially got since I bought the Rush Hour 3 DVD during the Christmas holidays (when the DVD was first available) in order for my wife and I to watch something new on a quite evening alone. I think the film would have worked better if it got a better protagonist or villain to counter Chan & Tucker.  By the way I really liked Ziyi Zhang from part two in which she played a great villain (or femme fatale). Perhaps part three could have used another major actor to play the main villain such as Jason Statham (who could have fitted in some sort of Frenchman role) or Jet Li (not that Jackie Chan would have a fighting chance against Statham or Li). In the end I think the producers of Rush Hour 3 truly fumbled with this effort. I think the wait was too long, laughs were few, action ordinary and the effort rushed. 5 stars for part one & two, but only 2 stars for part three.",1207785600,5,2661,4.740820734341253

Plotwise it seemes to be a revised version of the first, which really lets you know beforehand when what is going to happen. Not a great trait. The action is of roughly the same caliber as its predecessors, although somehow a bit lacking. The jokes are funny enough though, but can't carry the film on their own.

I think this film is a good example of the worse side of this hollywood obsession with sequels these days. Some times it just was not meant to be. 2,5 stars.",1207699200,5,590,4.267857142857143
3204831,3,B000WGYMTM,"It's been so, so long since I've watched the other two movies.

To be honest, i remember nothing of the first movie which many think was the best.

Of Part 2 I remember the little asian girl singing Mariah Carey's ""Fantasy"" in the car. She was JAMMIN'! haha...
And the ending had a casino fight with a few thugs and I remember one of them, probably Chris, fighting this chick who was very good at fighting.
They both were!
But like I said it's been a LONG time so other parts are hazy or non-existent!!

But this movie...it starts off with Tucker directing traffic (he's a police officer this time) and he's singing ""Do Me"" by an old-school singer, that I can't remember.

It's not Stephanie Mills but it's one who came out around her time, I would think!

The fight scenes were OK, the comedy was OK and the rest had a been there done that feel.

It was underwhelming for sure and I didn't quite get through the whole movie.

I got really tired and I turned it off because it was leaving a lot to be  desired.

Shoot me down for not watching the whole thing but that's just how it went down.

Before I leave you though, I must say that this movie was actually pretty racist also. Not towards blacks, but from blacks in a sense. Whoever wrote the script, gave Chris a few lines of ""funny"" Asian jokes such as the china man and other racist, predictable fodder that was to an extent funny, but not funny enough to be worth saying.
He also has a line where he says to his partner in crime that he knows all he does eat is rice and such.

2.7 stars.

End note: Give me a bad rating if you want but all we have to do is look at the overall score. It reflects my opinion rather well. Don't get me wrong though. It wasn't a total bummer. There were funny parts. It's just that in between all that you were waiting for something...

I won't give anything away but I will say the first 30 minutes (give or take) have the funniest stuff in the film! After that it slows down with a few funny moments but doesn't really pick up on the action until the Eiffel Tower scene.

Overall, not a bad movie but I wouldn't pay $19.95 for it. I'd get it either used or at a reduced price. As for how it does against the first two, it is definitely three! Still an entertaining romp if you don't have anything for about 2 hours.",1204070400,,758,4.114864864864865

The weakest link in the first two films was always Chris Tucker, who is just embarrassing. It seems like he is trying to be a low-budget Eddie Murphy, and fails.

Fortunately in Rush Hour 3 he is older and a bit less hyper. Age perhaps is also showing in Jackie Chan, who is always fun to watch, but his stunts are less impressive this time around.

The problem here is either in the writing or the directing. The film just seems to be a series of (not very funny) comedy sketches strung together, with the actors just doing through the motions. Max von Sydow delivers his usual quality, but the resolution of his character is just a repeat from the first film and not a surprise.

3204861,2,B000WGYMTM,"This buddy cop duo of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan is among the best ever made.  I really enjoyed Rush Hour in particular, and Rush Hour 2 was good fun as well.  However, this time around, it seems as if the plot of the movie is completely pointless.
Whereas in the first two films the story provided good fodder for letting these two provide hilarious comedy and cool action stunts, now they're left to basically fend for themselves because even the plot itself isn't taken seriously.  The return of Soo-Yun (who grew up really quickly in just a few years, from being a little girl to being a teacher!) helps a little, but not enough.  This time, the comedic formula doesn't stick very often and the action scenes are also disappointing.
It's just too silly for its own good, that's my issue with it.  Even if the film completely recycled stuff that worked in the first two films, I would have been cool with that.  But this time, even the execution is off, to the point where the film isn't even that interesting.

Throughout most of the film, it seems he's the one who makes most of the blunders, and Chan is the one who does most of the bailing out and serious work.

3204896,3,B000WGYMTM,"Fans of the Rush Hour series may (will likely) enjoy this one, but for the most part this is just more of the same action and plot that was in the first two Rush Hour movies.

All too predictable, all too easy to figure out who the good guys are (and who they aren't) long before the movie even really gets going, like the earlier Rush Hour movies the fun for this movie is in watching Jackie Chan's excellent action sequences and in snickering a bit at Chris Tucker's attempts to copy those or toss in a funny line here and there.

I have to ask the studio if they really felt it was necessary to waste a second disc on this, and have to wonder about the idea that Blu-ray has so much room per disc and yet this movie was released on two discs and not one?  I suppose it was just a choice by the studio, but I know that Blu-ray discs can easily hold much more content than just the movie, or just the movie and a commentary track and original theatrical trailer.

There are a good many extras available with this release, but those extras aren't on the disc with the movie.  In some ways that could be considered a good thing as you might be tempted to watch the movie again instead of simply putting the extras disc in the player and not having to worry about it.  It just seems a bit strange that the extras do come on another disc rather than having a single disc with movies, extras and everything on it.

Further confusion comes from the fact that the main feature itself only runs approximately 90 minutes.  (In many ways that can be considered a good thing about this movie).  At that relatively short length, one would expect there was plenty of left over space on the main disc to have included a lot of the content that was instead put on the second disc.  I suppose the trade off would have been that a bunch of content that is on the second disc might have been left out entirely in the name of saving the plastic used for make the second disc.  If that was truly the case, then in the words of Emily Latela, ""never mind.""

Rush Hour was one of the first that coupled Jackie Chan with an American star to fuse his martial arts skills with comedy.  While I am not a big fan of Chris Tucker, I found myself liking this duo.  An African-American Comedian paired together with an Asian Action Martial Arts Legend for an action/comedy worked for me.  Now on its third installment seemed on face value to be an uninteresting stretch of the original and only out to make a quick buck.  However,after watching this as a rental I bought a copy.

Brief Intro Story:
Few years have passed and now Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) is a funny traffic cop, and Chief inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) is still a bodyguard for the Chinese Ambassador Han who is scheduled to give a speech at the embassy about the biggest crime organization in the world--the Chinese Triads. As he is giving the speech, he gets shot by a sniper. Chan goes after the shooter, but once they get face to face, he lets him go. Tucker appears at the scene but it's too late.

The Ambassador survived the shooting, but he is the hospital and needs protection. His daughter Soo Yung also shows up to see his condition. Meanwhile a group of killers also show up at the hospital to finish the job--the Ambassador is moved to another room, a la Godfather. The shooting begins and predictably our duo wins and captures a Chinese-French hostage that tells them that the key of this mystery is in Paris. They go to Paris to find out who is behind this.

Review:
The only thing I found hysterically funny about this sequel is the large amount of plot holes--for example; no cops to protect the Ambassador at the hospital, Tucker becoming a detective after being just a traffic cop, Ambassador's daughter ending up in Paris and so forth. Also the story itself is just a recycled version of the previous films--with just a small little twist that you can see it coming from a mile away. How many times have we seen the veteran actor Max von Sydow being the double-face guy? We get no originality from director Brett Ratner who brags about making films in no time--it definitely shows. Well, it also shows Chris Tucker's humor that is predictable, average, and for him, easy to generate--He can do this without too much effort, so let's not give him a lot of credit for it. Unfortunately Jackie Chan is not that great either. He looks bored and tired throughout the film. Does he really want to be in this third installment? His age definitely shows because his stuns are simpler and uses body doubles. He does, however, pulled few good stuns, but nothing like the previous films.

Besides the beat-to-death racial stereotypes and gratuitous partial nudity, we find another ""great"" accomplishment by the writer Jeff Nathanson who knows how to put America down by adding a hateful French taxi driver who bashes American international policy--in that uncomfortable moment, the audience went dead silence. Is it funny to talk like that? Sadly for some, it is. Thank you for reminding us about the hostility from the rest of the world and the terrible danger that we as a nation face everyday.

The Verdict:
Rush Hour 3 is a mechanical affair created solely to bring to the masses cheap mindless humor and collect some big paychecks for everyone involved in it. Nothing really stands out from the franchise that seems to be getting worse as time goes by. It just doesn't have the charm and fun of the previous films.",1199664000,4,3554,4.744336569579288

3204952,2,B000WGYMTM,"I remember thinking, when this movie came out.....Not too sure if I want to go and pay $8 at the movie theater, but I will see it when it comes out on DVD (rent not purchase). I added that to my ever growing list of ""movies to rent"" and forgot about it. So imagine my delight when I saw that it was on by Demand (what I think is the best invention in years...no lines, no waiting to see the movie, just sit at home and order it). Now I already knew that the Rush Hour movies are similar to the Matrix movies in that, you can't wait for the next one to come out, but deep down you know that it couldn't possibly be as good as the first. I see Chris Tucker around Atlanta on occassion, and even remember seeing him do standup locally before he was in Friday....he is usually very funny. But in Rush Hour 3, with a few pounds (and I know we all have gained them) he just wasn't as funny as he usually is. And the usual farter that happens between he and Jackie Chan didn't appear as effortless as in the previous installments of the Rush Hour series. And it is obvious that Jackie has aged as well because we were not privy to as many fighting scenes as he normally gives us.

Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan)and LAPD Detective Carter (Chris Tucker) have made a promise to the daughter of the Ambassador (again) that they will discover who shot her father while he was attempting to uncover the identity of the leader of an elusive secret organization. Pursuiting leads to Paris, we see the merry, yet reluctant pair bantering about their friendship and trying to understand who is behind everything. Tucker meets a beautiful woman, and Chan discovers something about a family member that he just doesn't want to accept while having several dangerous encounters with a knife carrying woman.

I gave this movie a 2 for the following reasons: (1) there were so many references to past Rush Hour movies, that if you have never seen the previous movies, you would have no idea who and what they were talking about. Even the main storyline....the one involving the ambassador referred back to the 1st movie. So when Tucker kept referring to the little girl and then a young adult hugged him, most people would probably not know what was going on. The references to Chan's Secret Service Agent girlfriend, and other mishaps were from other movies. Perhaps it would have been better had they created a movie that could have stood alone. (2) I have grown tired of Chris Tucker acting silly during times when he shouldn't. I would have preferred Tucker to really dig his teeth in the roll and really come up with something original, especially since it seems that he will only do Chan movies (these have been the only movies he has done in the last few years). What I do like about all of these Rush Hour Moviews are the outtakes at the end. They are always as funny, if not funnier than the movie.",1199491200,,2881,4.444234404536862
3204983,3,B000WGYMTM,"I loved the first Rush Hour, and found the second to be amusing enough to purchase.  This one however, just fell flat.  The action scenes were not of the caliber, quality or ingenuity of the previous films, or of a standard Jackie Chan film.  And as for the comedy, it really wasn't that funny.  The movie felt as if large parts of the dialogue were unscripted in the hopes that Chris Tucker would ""Say something funny"" which never happened.  Sure there were a few lines that made me smile, but nothing made me actually laugh.  The plot would have been okay if it hadn't been used already in a previous Rush Hour (spoiler: bad guy is posing as a friend who sent you to get bad guy in first place) then you add in the tired old ""It's his brother/sister/dad"" part of the plot, which I hope was not supposed to be a twist, because I figured it out as soon as they introduced him.

The biggest problem with this movie is that it is a rehash of Rush Hour 1 without everything that made Rush Hour 1 so charming, which was watching the two of them get to know eachother.  Chan takes the back seat in this picture to Tucker who, for some reason seems to be wandering blindly through the movie.  The only good addition to the film was the French Cab Driver.  Other than that, we just have a bunch of Tucker and Chan getting threatened, running away, getting caught, bursting into song, being attacked, chasing bad guys and bursting into song again.  Which seems like the formula for most good action flicks (other than the bursting into song part) only this one just doesn't fit together as well and doesn't have the heart that the others did.

Is the movie overall terrible?  No, it's okay for a Saturday afternoon on TV.  I am just dissapointed by the overwhelming mediocreness of the whole film.

3204987,3,B000WGYMTM,"I stand by my belief that Chris Tucker is one of funniest actors out their right now.  Sure, not all of his film choices showcase the range I believe he possesses but the surface funny he brings to each and every performance is undeniable.  From the opening sequence to `Rush Hour 3' where Tuckers Carter is dancing in the streets we know that whether or not this film stacks up to the previous films is null and void, we are still going to laugh.

Well, does it stack up?

Sadly, `Rush Hour 3' (good lord, this really is the year of the trilogy isn't it) is not as good as it predecessors, but like I mentioned, it still brings some funny.  Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan reprise their roles as partners in crime (or crime-prevention) James Carter and Lee.  I had heard rumors before this film began filming that Chan was out and they were thinking of replacing him with another Asian actor.  I'm so thankful that this was not the case.  Had it been I would not have seen this film.  I don't believe in changing actors within a franchise.  Let's just say that as much as I loathe `Spider Mess 3' I'll see any film in the series UNLESS its stars are replaced.  Why do you think no one saw `XXX - State of the Union'?

My point exactly.

The plot behind `Rush Hour 3' is not really anything new.  In fact I could swear the same thing was done in `Rush Hour 2' or was it the original, but whatever, it's nothing new that's for sure.  The Ambassador Han from the first film is nearly assassinated and Lee and Carter try and track down the men responsible (someone very close to Lee) only to have Han's daughter (now all grown up) kidnapped in the process (yes, just like the first film).  Now Lee and Carter have to save her.  They threw in the search for Shai Shen but even that seems vaguely familiar.  Like I said, nothing original, which is a shame since they have had a LONG time to work up something better.  `Rush Hour 3' comes off a bit, what's the word, oh yeah...rushed.  Despite the long lapse in time from the filming of the second film to this installment it feels as if it was thrown together in weeks, not years.  Obviously this was not mulled over and thought through entirely.

The action scenes are still thrilling and Chris Tucker is hilarious.  Jackie Chan has never really been the funny bone of the series, even though he has had his moments.  He has less of them here, but Tucker always knows when to pick up the slack.

`Rush Hour 3' is predictable and uninspiring but it's funny; mindless funny fun.  I wouldn't necessarily `rush' to the rental store to check it out but if you want to complete the series (I doubt there will be a forth installment) then by all means check it out without fear or hesitation.  No, it's not as good as the first two, but it's not a buzz-kill either.  You'll laugh, I promise.",1199232000,,2827,4.343511450381679

3204989,5,B000WGYMTM,"Rush Hour 3, is a good movie and many say that this movie is dull and boring.  Like an earlier review, I feel that when it comes to the Rush Hour series you pretty much know what you can come to expect. Many laughs, a predictable story line and action.  The 3rd installment provides all of the above.  I think the movie is good, but not great. I am a strong believer that the 1st installment in any series is typically the best because it is original and one doesn't know often what to expect. I am giving it 5 stars because it gave me what I expect.  Jackie and Chris work well together.  I do feel that this series lacked an in-depth storyline. I do think that a Rush Hour 4 should not be produced not because of a lack of laughs or action but because of storyline. I really don't know how much further in storyline the producers can go. Nevertheless, from the moment I sat down to when I got up, I laughed, and there was action throughout.  For any Rush Hour fan of the previous installments you won't be disappointed.",1199145600,,1021,4.237113402061856
3204990,2,B000WGYMTM,"I liked the first Rush Hour a lot.  The second one wasn't as fantastic but since they changed the location it made things kind of fresh.  I think they went for the same formula on the third one by taking them to France after being in LA for a while but it just wasn't entertaining.

Sure, there were a few spots of humor here and there.  When a French cab drivers insults Halle Barry in front of Chris Tucker his reaction made me laugh out loud.  However, this movie just never grabbed me.

To be honest, this reminds me of this great teacher I had.  When I first took his class he was funny and entertaining.  What made him really stand out was his great repertoire of one-liners that had the classroom rolling.  So when he was teaching another class I was excited to sign up and found that his silliness started wearing off on me and his ""great repertoire"" was actually the same old jokes from the previous class.  Though there wasn't anything different, it was just boring anyways.

This movie is like that.  There wasn't anything to keep this fresh, it was just a rehashing of the first two movies again.  Even references to ""Mu shoo"" were there like the makers thought we would still be laughing at that joke.  Come on, its old now.  The only thing they did to try and keep this fresh was filming it in Europe but I think this movie needed more.  Even Shrek needed to bring in new sidekicks to keep things fresh.

In the end, I never finished this movie.  Halfway though my son asked me if I wanted to play Guitar Hero and I thought that would be more entertaining.  After a few days I realized I never finished the movie and then realized again I had no desire to.

Unless Rush Hour still tickles your fancy I'd just avoid this one.  Others described it as watchable and I think that is the nicest thing I can say about this movie.  I mean, it wasn't horrible it just wasn't good.",1199145600,8,1886,4.313390313390314

After seeing Rush Hour 3 in theatres this year I was puzzled how the ending in this trilogoy seemed oddly short and how there was no actual Roselyn Sanchez in the film except for a photo even though she was credited on imdb. Well I knew I'd find some information about this when the DVD come out so my aim was to get the DVD for the commentary and deleted scenes. After watching the deleted/alternate scenes and commentary I am disappointed at the choices the producer and director took for this film. But before I get to that I found the producer and director's commentary to be disoriented as neither person seemed to remember much about the origins of the scenes in the film, nor remember the actors names or each other. Yes, Roselyn Sanchez is in this movie but she's in the alternate ending, which if you watch this DVD for that alternate ending you will be wondering why the producers didn't go with that ending instead of what the theatrical film contains, but surprisingly there's no understable reason given by the commentary as to why the alternate ending wasn't used except the mentioning that they were high during this shooting.  Seriously the commentary on this DVD is absoultely awful, although they do hint on a possible plot for a Rush Hour 4 film in the commentary but I'll let you hear it for yourself to believe what they have to say regarding it.",1198800000,,1545,4.459363957597173

There is some story of the Hong Kong triads in Paris thrown in to make a ""rush hour 3"" (Why the hell are there chineese people in Paris ?) Some lousy story I did not even bother to follow the story line. I was there just to see the Jackie and Chris chemistry but I was surprised that I was so jaded with the stuff that I have seen twice already. All unreal stuff. Neither Chris or Jackie get bruised or wounded. They gleefully miss bullets, they bounce of 2 story jumps with just a scraped knee. No broken ribs. No broken bones. Lethal weapon gave some realism to violence in that Mel and Danny suffer bruises. They feel some pain. But this movie feels more like a cartoon but then again the movie is a continuation of the successful franchise set in motion with the first rush hour but with this movie it has exploited the last ounce of the ""rush hour"" barrel. It was like seeing the part 1 and part 2 again. Back then rush hour 1 was new and had an innovative feel to it but 2 and 3 got me so bored as after rush hour 1 we knew the tricks and gags that we could expect so it was just a question of Chris and jackie doing their big jumps, char chases, bickering and  Chris tucker's moon walk and michael jackson or prince like singing/dance impression. What prompted me to watch the movie also was that it is directed by Brett Ratner who did Xmen3 and I loved his vision and style of Xmen3 so I wanted to see what he did with Rush Hour 3 but RH franchise is so used up that even Brett could not instill any new life into an already dead doll.

In the end, they come out smelling like roses.

The end.

Rumors of filming a fourth Rush Hour film immediately after this third installment were apparently scrapped due to unknown reasons, but one could easily venture that failing interest in the series hamstrung such a project (but who knows ...maybe there will be a fourth).

Tucker and Chan still have a unique chemistry on-screen, one a speed talking black man and the other a soft talking Chinese gentleman. The blooper out-takes on the DVD are worth watching to check out Chan's difficulties with various English translations and his physical accident while trying to throw a piece of furniture with his legs (I've heard tell that he broke his sternum during that take.

Plenty of eye-candy awaits those guys who like to see marvelously curvaceous women whom you normally would only see air-brushed on magazine covers. Most notably is French actress Nomie Lenoir who plays Genevieve, a dancer with a very special head on her shoulders.

3205022,3,B000WGYMTM,"Remarkably redundant and yet still entertaining, Brett Ratner's ""Rush Hour 3"" brings back the exhilaratingly hilarious Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker duo. The villains are clich and ill-contrived, and the story is a mess of unnecessary subplots and meaningless back-story, but clearly comedy is key. From the first moments of the film to the predictable last, Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker demand attention and we willingly comply. The fight sequences are creatively uncommon, and the comedic chemistry between Chan and Tucker never ceases to amuse and amaze. By the time you've seen all three Rush Hour films, you won't be able to decipher the events from one to another, but you'll still be more than satisfied at having watched them.

Chief Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) and LAPD Detective Carter (Chris Tucker) are back in the U.S. to avenge Ambassador Han who is nearly assassinated when he attempts to disclose information about the ultra secretive crime syndicate, the Triads. Their investigation brings them to Paris where mysterious nightclub dancer Genevieve (Noemie Lenoir) may be the only clue to uncovering the assassination plot and the marks against their lives. Lee must also come to terms with his longtime friend Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada) who may be on the wrong side of the law and at the heart of the conspiracy.

Rush Hour 3 wastes no time leaping straight into action and comedy, which perfectly recreates the tone and mood of the first two films. Despite the fact that the story takes a backseat to the action, and the general events that occur are overly repetitious amongst the trilogy, it doesn't attempt to camouflage itself as anything more than meets the eye. Perhaps most disappointing is the predictability of the antagonists and the nearly identical counterpart demises and plot twists.

All the principle players return, including a few surprises, such as references to Isabella from Rush Hour 2 and a grown up Soo Yung, and even minor supporting characters such as the police chief. But the spotlight still unquestionably belongs to Tucker and Chan. While Chan is famous for his extraordinary martial arts skills and the fact that he does all of his own stunts, his age is beginning to interfere with the vigor and intensity of the stunts he's willing to attempt. Less spectacular fight sequences are replaced by humorous events choreographed into action - even green-screen work that demonstrates risibly illogical stunts make a disappointing appearance. Chan at least knows how to be creative with his fighting, and in his familiar fashion, makes use of tables, chairs and random props to engage in comical battle. The most impressive stunts are those of the villains who pursue the duo across the streets of Paris in fantastic van and motorcycle chases. It is refreshing to see violence portrayed in such a facetious manner and yet still be equally amusing and precarious. Tucker uses his fast-talking mouth instead of brawn, and while the first two films create a mild distaste for his brand of obnoxiousness, here it is channeled directly toward villains, so the audience can wholeheartedly side with his boisterous blathering.

The Rush Hour films have always been a series of action and comedy sequences loosely strung together by plot. It's as if the gags are derived first; the story often feels trite and unoriginal and Rush Hour 3 is no exception. But the chemistry between Tucker and Chan reaches a new high, and the sensational setting of ""The City of Lights"" allows for a whole new slew of racial jokes and political incorrectness. A ""Who's on first?"" routine (obviously inspired by Abbott and Costello), a prim nun translating foul language, and George the anti-American French taxi driver are examples of witty additions to the familiarly mischievous comedy showcased in the series. The inclusion of supermodel Noemie Lenoir is terribly expected, and screen legend Max Von Sydow can't seem to summon life into his predictable role. A showdown on the Eiffel Tower and the amazingly hilarious signature outtakes are other high points, but Kenji's forced villainy and pathetic character development remind us that Rush Hour 3 is a simple film with un-ambitious goals. While nothing is terribly memorable or awe-inspiring, constant bits of crudeness and slapstick humor make the occasion worthwhile even if you can't remember enough funny moments to tell your friends.

3205044,4,B000WGYMTM,I decided not to be swayed by the incredible number of lousy reviews I read by the critics and went to see Rush Hour 3. I'm glad that I did as I found myself doubling over with laughter throughout the entire film. Yes we were made to wait an exceptionally long time for this one and clearly Chan & Tucker are older but this film STILL delivers the comedy and moments of action that have made this series what it is. This is easily one of my favorites in the installment. A reviewer here mentioned that the public had certified this one D.O.A. which is funny because this film spent six weeks in the top 10 and took in more than $140 million at the box office. This after taking in $49 million in the opening week - obviously the word got out as to just how hilarious this film is!,1197763200,3,780,4.172185430463577
3205045,5,B000WGYMTM,"The always loveable Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan once again score big laughs on the screen with Rush Hour 3. If you loved the previous Rush Hour movies (and, if you didn't -- why are you reading this??) you are guaranteed a good time with this DVD.

If you missed seeing this in the theater, there is no risk here by buying it sight-unseen. Chris Tucker in the showgirls' dressing room might be worth the price of the movie, alone. And, Jackie Chan is fabulous just being himself.

Rush Hour 3 is the perfect mix of comedy, adventure and martial arts! I hope we can look forward to dozens more.",1197676800,,594,4.390909090909091
3205046,5,B000WGYMTM,"I don't know why people are trashing this movie because in my opinion I think it's as good as the first 1 or maybe even better! The formula hasn't changed, (Chan the serious crime fighter & Tucker the not so serious funny man) it was funny, & as always a fun movie from beginning to end. The only difference is that Tucker is noticably older (for some reason Jackie Chan never looks older than he is.) I know I'll be buying it as soon as it comes out!",1197504000,,451,4.136363636363637
3205047,5,B000WGYMTM,"I love the ""Rush Hour"" movies... I can watch all three over and over again.",1197158400,,75,4.066666666666666
3205048,2,B000WGYMTM,"After watching this movie, I realized all the funny scenes are already in the trailer! The rest of the movie is boring. This is one of the worst film staring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan.

It's still worth renting so that you can compare it with the other two installments.",1197072000,,273,4.46
3205049,3,B000WGYMTM,"RUSH HOUR 3 (movie theatre): B minus (After almost ten years they're back but even though it has some funny moments they aren't as good as the previous two. If you're a loyal fan, it's worth checking out but there are better comedies, old and new.)",1193443200,,248,4.413043478260869
3205050,2,B000WGYMTM,"Rush Hour was okay, Rush Hour Two was twice the punch and it's  disappointing to note that Rush Hour Three is anti-climax.  To bring continuity to the sequels, some old characters are brought back.  Rather than having a constructive and tight script, Rush Hour Three builds story around the gags that enables Jackie and Chris to shine.  What I find uncomfortable about this movie is having French characters proclaiming their love for the United States and if I were the French actors, I would be even embarrassed to do so.  Then, there are plots that are so inconceivable and so illogical.  Anyhow, Max von Sydow is clearly underutilised.  Chris and Jackie's gags are running thin after a while and the outakes are actually the one to look forward to.  Brett Ratner, the Director could have done better and I'm sure that both Chris and Jackie could have done better too.  Perhaps, they are too complacent and simply treating this as a money spinning machine.  Whatever that is, I'm losing faith in this franchise.  Disappointing.",1191542400,7,1030,4.862068965517241
3205051,5,B000WGYMTM,"I have a question, why are people giving this movie bad reviews that state themselves they didn't even really like the other two movies to begin with? Im not gonna go write a review about harry potter or something I hate and trash talk it cuz my opinion is irrelevant. If you liked the other two movies then this one will not be disappointing. This movie was supposed to be a comedy with some martial arts action poured on top and thats exactly what it was. Chris Tucker was hilarious in it and if he annoys you then don't watch the movie. I was in a completley packed theater and every person was laughing so hard people were losing their breath. So obviously SOMEONE thinks Chris Tucker is funny. All the haters need to back off of this post.",1189209600,102,744,4.359712230215828
3205052,3,B000WGYMTM,"As you know, ""Rush Hour"" series have become popular action comedy series, and it is no surprise that the third installment is finally released. Now, if you want to see a Jackie Chan ""action"" film like me, perhaps you should forget ""Rush Hour 3"" and rent a DVD of his Hong-Kong-made films whatever that may be. ""RH3"" is more like a comedy film starring Chris Tucker (OK, and I'm not saying that is bad).

I am not going to talk about the script by Jeff Nathanson (""Catch Me If You Can"" fame"") which is about buddy-buddy adventure, beautiful ladies in France and the Chinese triad. In short, there is nothing new about it, but Jackie Chan's films are not known for tight storytelling or coherence, so that is OK. What is disappointing is the lack of actions, real ones.

I know Chan is now over 50 and that Hollywood studios would not allow him to do death-defying stunts like in Hong Kong. Still Chan can still do interesting tricks with his clever use of props (see his recent films like ""The Myth""), but his actions here are diminished to only several scenes where no his fast punches or kicks are included. Also, some shots of his agile movements are often cut and edited in the middle of his actions. The climax sword fight scene too does not look as thrilling and exciting as it should be partly because it is interrupted by another fight scene by Tucker, and partly because it does not have imaginative choreography.

The names of internationally assorted supporting actors are interesting, but only a few of them are given chance to show what they really can do. Hiroyuki Sanada who plays the baddie (recently seen in ""The Last Samurai"" and ""Sunshine"") can do much better than what he shows here (he was a famous action star in Japan during the late 70s and early 80s), but somehow we get only one action scene from him and Chan. Yuki Kudo (""Snow Falling on Cedars"" ""Memoirs of a Geisha"") is also a talented actress, but sadly her talent is somehow wasted in the same way as Zhang Ziyi in ""Rush Hour 2."" But what do you expect from director Brett Ratner who cast Zhang Ziyi as bomb-carrying assassin?

Tzi Ma and Philip Baker Hall briefly appear just to remind us that this is a sequel. Max Von Sidow, Yvan Attal, Roman Polanski show up, but have little to do. Sun Ming Ming also appears as ""Kung Hu Giant,"" nod to Bruce Lee film ""Game of Death"" and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, which is one of the funniest parts of the film.

Once again, if you want to see an action film, maybe you should try first ""Rush Hour."" And as comedy, yes, I laughed a few times, or maybe more, but sorry, not much enough. Maybe that is because I didn't like Chris Tucker's loud character, or I no longer feel the interaction between Chan and Tucker as fresh as before. Or probably it is because I still don't understand why it took about 6 years for New Line Cinema to make this enjoyable, but too light-weight film, and that's with Jackie Chan, one of the greatest action stars in the world, as Tucker's side kick.",1188000000,2,2992,4.472527472527473
