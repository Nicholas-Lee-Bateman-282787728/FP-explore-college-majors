7817381,5,6301933028,"British animation humor at its best.  Absurd adventures, spy stuff, and some of the worst puns ever. Listen close!  They don't slow down.

This collection has one of my favorite episodes, ""The Invasion of Colonel K"", a delightful parody of ""Fantastic Voyage"".",1177632000,,259,5.119047619047619
7817382,4,6301933028,"This video is not my favorite of the 5, but it is classic.  Where else can you find washing machines taking over London?  Penfold's adventures back in time are a riot.  Fun for all ages...ranks up with one of my all-time top  five favorite tv series.",962236800,3,250,4.369565217391305
7817383,5,6301933028,"More absurd comic spy capers from the White Wonder. One episode features the first appearance of an early Count Duckula. I enjoyed this tape immensely but was puzzled by the online description which says that this  video contains 5 episodes. ""The Strange Case Of The Ghost Bus""  was not on the tape I received.",953510400,8,310,4.722222222222222
7817384,5,6301933028,"A marvelous cartoon show. Very funny,clever and at times side-splittingly absurd! The acting and animation are top-class an the intermissions with the narrator are a very good idea. I was slightly nervous about ordering  this video as I was not sure if would work on my British standard machine,  but I was pleasantly surprized! More of these tapes should be made  including Count Duckula, Victor and Hugo et al. I can't wait for my next  order to arrive!",951091200,3,455,4.794871794871795
