8758887,4,B01EIW2S8W,"My typical conflicted One Piece anime review: on the one hand, it follows the well written plot of the utterly fantastic manga quite well. On the other hand, the animation is shit and each episode contains about 15 minutes of meaningless stock footage because Toei is the cheapest anime studio in the industry. The dub is okay. It's not FUNimation's best, but not their worst. The biggest issue seems to be that there are simply too many characters for FUNi to be able to cast every character as well as they could be. Overall, if you have made it this far in the series, do you really need a recommendation? Either you like One Piece or don't at this point. If you do, you can tolerate the extremely low quality animation in order to get to the story that you know and love. Recommended to fans of the series, but not really anyone else.",1477440000,,838,4.4480519480519485
