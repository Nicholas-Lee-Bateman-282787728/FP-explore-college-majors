The action is intense extermly well done a classic would highly recommend this one.",1184803200,2,225,4.022222222222222
969853,4,6305104832,Plot was a little confusing at first. Great fight scenes at the end.,1179964800,,68,4.3076923076923075
969854,4,6305104832,"This is a great kung-fu flick.  Plenty of action, decent storyline, and fun fight scenes. If the old kung-fu movies are somthing you like, you'll be entertained by this one.

What sets this movie apart from many other movies of this genre are the fantastic views of the Chinese countryside.  Seriously, some of the settings for the action of this film are just amazing.

No, it isn't as good as the first movie with Gordon Liu, but how many martial arts movies are? Buy this movie already.",1105228800,4,489,4.586206896551724
969855,3,6305104832,"OK, not the best in the world, but worth the purchase.  Tons of silly dialogue, corny intros to the main characters (wait'll you see the stunt 'horse riding' antics), but the fight scenes are strong; extended in length, and choreographed very well.  The finale is gritty, but without a lot of excessive melodrama.  All in all, pretty good, but only when you have the extra bucks.",1088294400,4,379,4.712121212121212
969856,3,6305104832,"Don't think this is the sequel to the wu-tang classic starring gordon lui, cause it's not.  But it's still a good film.  In this one the Wu tang try  and take over the shoaling temple by placing one of their own as the abbot.  Some very interesting styles and fights follow, as the remaining shoaling  followers and a ban of shaolin masters fight to regain what was theres.",965088000,4,373,4.426470588235294
969857,5,6305104832,"From start to finish this movie is great. It has highly skilled martial arts. It takes place on location at the real shao lin temple and wu dang temple. some great styles, and great fight scences. Also there is a great  horse race battle with they are coming from mongolia.  Forget what the last  review said about realistic. Everything is realistic. In all chinese  movies. You just have to have some knowledge behind what they are doing.",960249600,5,439,4.662337662337662

7883396,4,6305104832,"This constitutes one of the better wushu flicks from Yu Rongguang, whom I consider to be one of the best martial arts practitioner from Hong Kong and a great athlete to boot, although he is greatly under used as an actor, given the fact that he continually portrays the bad guy within the genre, thereby, misleading the Asian audience into misidentifying him with the role he plays, and is, hence, rendered quite unpopular. There are only two movies in which he plays the part of the good guy, to commendable effect and great martial arts choreography, namely Iron Monkey and Champions, both of which I consider to be two of the greatest martial arts movies ever made, and both of which are considered to be his best movies to date. He doesn't perform to the high standards he has established for himself in this movie but, nevertheless puts in a commendable performance, only to be out shined by other less known actors, particularly the female cast.

All in all, a rather satisfying and good martial arts movie.",1399593600,,1013,4.72316384180791
7883397,2,6305104832,Well for starter i had this movie on VHS and i loved it the only problem with this movie.  In the setting for the language it didn't let me prompt it to play audio for english.  The setting was there but it didn't work and that to me was disappointing.  For this was a great movie audio is really important we don't speak the language.  The setting for subtitle work fine.  I have to call you on this one not happy with that defect.,1356048000,2,432,4.095238095238095
