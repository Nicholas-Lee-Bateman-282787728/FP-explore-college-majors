2394560,5,B000AU0460,"excellant documentary.  Reminded me of ""Just, Melvin"", but goes more into the psychological M O of this predator which I found enlightening and terrifying",1421625600,6,154,5.416666666666667
2394561,3,B000AU0460,"This movie was ok, lots of redundent clips and not enough information.  I wish is would have told more indepth information and had more information in regard to his child hood.",1382918400,,176,4.67741935483871
2394562,5,B000AU0460,"AS the father of two daughters, 18 & 26, respectfully, they are still mere students of this world. It's important to look after their well being whether 6 or 26. Parents with children of any age will understand what I mean, it's better to know these ""things"" and stay as informed as possible. Paranoia has no place in all this  but knowledge and information is true empowerment.",1367625600,5,378,4.641791044776119
2394563,4,B000AU0460,"After watching the show on NBC about Children sexual predators, I looked for a DVD and got this.

Its a documentary on Peter Ebel who has abused/rob children of their innocence. Though the children (now adults) didn't narrate every detail of the abuse, it is plain to see how they continue to bear the burden.

This DVD made me aware of another kind of predator--- the friendly type. Pretty creepy how he insidiously gained the family's trust because of his educational prowess.

He chose to pretend as a pilot instructor because children, particularly boys, dream of being one. He then lures them after giving kids what they want---prestige, an almost perfect father figure and more.",1284336000,2,684,4.930434782608696
2394564,5,B000AU0460,Incredibly interesting and compelling film that explores the psychological damage of male victims of sexual abuse. The director's brother was one of the victims and bravely tells his story about a sociopath who disguised himself as a teacher/ friend of his family.  This is the story of an American family destroyed by a truly evil man who went on to molest countless boys throughout the US and Europe before finally being caught nearly ten years ago.  The film also follows the trail of how he was eventually caught and the heroic people who brought him to justice  ( it will make you angry how short his prison sentence is ... ).  In a world of Jerry Springer trainwrecks ... this is a non-exploitive look into a tragedy that's not often told with so much compassion.,1227571200,2,769,4.674074074074074
2394565,4,B000AU0460,Excellent story of the victims of a prolific pedophile in one small town,1443398400,,72,4.615384615384615
2394566,2,B000AU0460,"Not especially coherent, which makes for a poor documentary.  Also hard to hear, due to amateur quality of filming.",1435881600,,115,5.052631578947368
2394567,5,B000AU0460,"important film about incorrigible pedophiles and the long term effects on their victims. If you're looking for titillation don't watch this serious film. If you'd like to learn why pedophilia continues on for generations and how one pedophile can touch the lives of hundreds, if not thousands of children, watch this film. My heart goes out to the victims of the starring pedophile of this film, and to all victims.",1434672000,,415,4.942857142857143
2394568,5,B000AU0460,"Well done story.  If a man shows a young person that much interest, that should raise red flags. Doesn't mean they're harming the child but they should be supervised.",1431388800,,166,4.724137931034483
2394569,2,B000AU0460,"In my opinion, drawn out and boring.",1430611200,,36,4.285714285714286

2394571,4,B000AU0460,Very nice but sad tale of little boys molested by a local pediatrician.  I was hoping for more of a national reporting and also info on the various clergy that has been involved.  That's the only reason I left off a star.  I would recommend viewing of this documentary for all parents.,1426896000,,285,4.4423076923076925
2394572,3,B000AU0460,What is up with the subtitles?  They don't match anything.,1424390400,,58,4.8
2394573,3,B000AU0460,"This film is written/produced/directed by the sister of one of the victims, and it clearly has been made with passion and sympathy towards this predator's countless victims.  But there's so much that needed to be said, even if just briefly.  The evildoer spends thirty years traveling the world preying on small boys.  He has the wherewithal to shuttle them back and forth across continents, somehow avoiding any questions from authorities.  I would like to know how a seldom-employed high school dropout became wealthy enough for such a lifelong enterprise.  Were there sponsors behind his nefarious activities?  Maybe this should be a separate film and investigation in itself.  A star is deducted for not even thinking about this aspect.

Another star is deducted for sloppy editing.  He's not a vice-""principle.""  The eastern European country is not ""Hungry.""

This is a modest, semi-professional effort, but it's from the heart.",1423699200,9,933,5.27891156462585
2394574,5,B000AU0460,"Excellent documentary - absolutely worth a rental. If you are fascinated by the mind of sociopaths and/or pedophiles, this well-produced, well-researched doco is worth your time. It is stunning to me how clever and manipulative some of these people are, which enables them to victimize vulnerable children for years - even decades - before being caught, if they are caught at all. In watching this doco, you'll be that much better armed in knowing a bit more about how these predators think and function in society. Know thy enemy - rent this video.",1423180800,5,549,4.913978494623656
8079837,4,B000AU0460,"anyone recall the big thing with reporters greeting guys who were seeking young girls. the 'gitls' were actually guys seducing the internet geeks, including what they wanted. age, etc. the girl made a date with these guys, who arrived with booze, flowers, sex toys. the girls  didn't sjhow but a guy who was there to greet them pretended to call them. then cops came in, mirandized them and hauled them out. some of the fellas actually kept saying' 'but where is she? is she inside?

those goons did not get it. this happened over and over in various cities, same director.etc.
the thing that was so great about this seies was insight into j the offenders, the sense of entitlement (sp). perfect picture them. I know. I had some victimized me.the ifiots. biut it was in the '40's and no one ever did anything..

8079840,3,B000AU0460,"Documentary was ok. It tells of a predator and how his actions destroyed so many lives. This is real and could be an eye opener to families. I have seen better documentary's on the subject, and would recommend for future shows to explain traits of a predator for public awareness.",1467072000,,280,4.62

8079846,5,B000AU0460,"The 5 stars I've given is for the content of this documentary, which as stated by the narrator is a telling of a story about a pedophilic predator and the impact he and his actions had on the narrator's brother and the rest of her family. She included stories of other key victims to illustrate the similarities and differences between the experiences of the young boys who had deep and intense attachments to the perpetrator, and to show examples of this predator's MO and psychopathology. It also provided an overall report of his activity, which helped provide the scope of his reach. And finally it told the story of his final capture and incarceration. I found the movie thorough, fair, and honest. It was plodding at times, and presentation was somewhat rudimentary, but it's hard I found the basic-ness of the film lent to its sincerity.",1447372800,,844,4.787671232876712
