3053340,5,B0010XB1WW,i watch this DVD one a year .. very nicely put together. i had a picture taken with coach wooden 10 years ago at the coffee shop he goes to daily so that was a treat to meet the man.  a model person and an icon,1397174400,,210,3.5652173913043477
3053341,5,B0010XB1WW,"There was no bigger fan of the late John Wooden and UCLA basketball in the sixties and seventies than myself. I watched it all in amazement as it happened and now after all these years their herculean accomplishments are still hard to comprehend. Needless to say watching this film is not only a wonderfully nostalgic stroll down memory lane detailing the Bruins achievements on the court and in the record book but also a fascinating social and political mosaic chronicling the turbulent times these events took place. My favorite moments however are the intimate. shared reminiscences by many of the pivotal players under Coach Woodens' tutorage. If you're a UCLA fan or just a sports fan in general you'll appreciate what this documentary has to offer.

The one thing that bothers me about this presentation is the noticeable absence of Kareem Abdul Jabbar (aka: Lew Alcindor), arguably the greatest Bruin of them all. I certainly can't imagine him not being invited to participate in the film, so what happened? If anyone knows the answer post a comment.",1376611200,,1058,4.977401129943503
3053342,5,B0010XB1WW,"Especially the parts on Bill Walton who is/was the best college player I ever saw.  The joy with which he played the game is infectious.  I also enjoyed the way the pedantic coaching methods of John Wooden were fondly remembered and translated into lessons for life by his players.

The history is informative, the selection of interviews entertaining, and the cameo appearances by Mark Harmon delicious.  You wouldn't know, from this video, that he was quarterback for the football team.

Fine sports reporting.",1372896000,,512,5.120481927710843
3053343,1,B0010XB1WW,This DVD was very disappointing. Only 10% was devoted to basketball. Far too much worthless coverage of 1960s Vietnam era dissent. Very little basketball and the dynasty.

3053347,5,B0010XB1WW,"Remarkable for its frankness and placing this legendary dynasty in the social, historical context-- Vietnam, political protests, and racial strife. UCLA teams were a part of the times and apart from them at the same time. It is first and foremost about basketball, but it is also about modern American history and about the Coach, John Wooden, who lived through it all. The UCLA Dynasty is an entertaining you-are-there civic lesson and personal accounts of victory and loss.

3053349,5,B0010XB1WW,"I had a chance to view this program on HBO television last year and i must say it is as about as informative of the UCLA basketball program as you can possibly get. John Wooden created something really special back in the 60's all the way through the mid 70's decade. And in doing so, he cemented his legacy for many years to come. And in the process producing some of the finest players in the history of the game in doing so.  I highly recommend this dvd documentary for any true basketball fan. I know for a fact that i will be copping it for my extensive hoop collection. I've always found the UCLA basketball program to be somewhat intriguing.",1204934400,14,648,4.355371900826446
