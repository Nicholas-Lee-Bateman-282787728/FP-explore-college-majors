7341243,4,B011T0C6HO,Miss Marple fan. Would have given a 4.5 but no half stars. Only con I have is that one of the movies is from PBS MASTERPIECE THEATER which means it the edited version and missing about 6 min. Other then nice it looks good so far.,1446163200,8,229,4.0
7341244,3,B011T0C6HO,"Sure, many of these mysteries are well done and the acting talents of Ms. McKenzie are apparent, but

but why did they have to change so many details of these stories?

A sampling:
In Murder is Easy the murderers motive is changed and 2 subplots are added, the first victims are killed differently than Agatha Christies book.

Why didn't they ask Evans? has the murderers motive changed, as well.

In ""The Secret of Chimneys"" both the murderer's identity and motive are changed.

In the Mirror Cracked, we have also a dozen small changes such as changing the characters names. The reason for one persons murder was changed also.

The changes for all these episodes is probably equal over a hundred so if you have read the books and are expecting the same basic story you may be disappointed (unlike in the Joan Hickson films which are far more accurate in following the details of Agatha Christies actual words).  By all means have a look at these ""adaptations,"" but just keep in mind that they are far more adapted than most representations of Agatha Christie stories made previous to this collection.",1444435200,11,1102,4.768421052631579
7341245,5,B011T0C6HO,"There have been three great stars that took their turn playing Miss Jane Marple. Of course Marple was the genius of Agatha Christie and the film versions of the stories do a great job of giving the story. Of course, even in feature-length filming, some of the book is left out. The films are worth the price.
Julia McKenzie played Marple 11 times. There all good, all here in this set. McKenzie was also in ""Cranford"", ""Fresh Fields"", French Fields"", and continues to act. For me, it is hard to pick a best Miss Marple. I also liked Geraldine McEwan and Joan Hickson. Each did the job a little differently, but all are good.

7341268,5,B011T0C6HO,"I also enjoyed the Miss Marples starring Joan Hickson and Geraldine McEwan, but Julia McKenzie embodies THE Miss Marple.  It's a sad they cancelled such a fine series, but choose to leave garbage series on to run for decades.",1519603200,,225,4.769230769230769

THE ENTIRE SERIES IS WELL DONE & A WONDERFUL WAY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE AND ALL ASPECTS OF THE ENGLISH SOCIETY IN THE TIME PERIOD THAT MISS MARPLE IS SET.  WONDERFULLY CAST.",1514332800,2,321,4.229508196721311

7341286,4,B011T0C6HO,"While the previous Marple looked more the part, this lady acted more the part, and the stories were maybe a little truer to the novels, though liberties were still taken.",1506556800,,170,4.7
7341287,5,B011T0C6HO,"I love Agatha Christie's Marple.  The show is very well done, and Julia McKenzie does an admirable job taking over for Geraldine McEwan.  Her style is different, of course, and she has more of a presence.  The mysteries are excellent and once again the show's producers manage to entice many quality English actors to help bring the world of Agatha Christie's Marple to life.",1506384000,4,375,4.828125

7341294,4,B011T0C6HO,"THIS actress who plays Miss Marple is not my favorite, but she's not horrible. Some of the episodes ARE NOT Miss Marple stories, which is one of the things I have a problem with.
The whole set-up of this actresses portrayal is another thing I'd like to pick away at.
Agatha Christie once lamented Margaret Rutherford's Miss Marple because she was dressed it tweeds & rushing about.
Christie's description of Jane Marple was more like Joan Hickson & Geraldine McEwen.
Viewers must've had a problem with THIS Miss Marple, too, as it got cancelled after one more season.",1491523200,2,567,4.795918367346939

7341312,3,B011T0C6HO,"This is comprised of two sets of stories. The first set (six or seven disks) is terrible, poorly acted, over produced, written by writers who thought they could improve on Ms. Christie's stories. Something happened before the second series appears. The main actress was replaced, sets and photography were improved. the stories were brought much closer to the originals. Not bad. Nevertheless there is an older BBC series that is sensationally better. Buy it and borrow these.",1484006400,3,476,5.194805194805195

7341316,5,B011T0C6HO,Exceptional cinematography.  Great story lines.  Ms. McKenzie is my favorite Miss Marple and is clearly excellent in her portrayal of the character.  Well known actors who are portrayed in this series include Benedict Cumberbatch from Sherlock and Hugh Bonneville from Downton Abbey.  Every single episode was a journey!

7341321,5,B011T0C6HO,This is a very good set of Miss Marple mysteries and well worth the price since they do not seem to be available for streaming at a cost that competes with buying the DVDs.

7341323,5,B011T0C6HO,"I enjoy this SO much! It very interesting, cerebral, and beautiful to watch. I also own Joan Hickson's Miss Marple and she is also Excellent, but I like the ""humble"" nature that Julia McKenzie brings to the character. Highly recommended!",1465084800,12,237,4.95
