I wish I could rave about the DVD more. It is 90% politics, war, drugs, earthquakes, homelessness, etc. I understand that it follows events that happened during that year and these things should be included, but that is all there is in this DVD. There is basically nothing about the fashion, music, movies, shows, etc. of this year. Nothing! This was a gift for my sister on her birthday because...you know..it's a birthday card! There was nothing happy in it at all. They should most difficulty thrown in some fun and happy topics too. Especially since they are on the card you would think they would be on the DVD. They aren't. My sister was very sad after watching nothing but these very unpleasant events on her birthday. Don't buy this unless you want to see only the unhappy parts of 1988.",1378080000,2,937,4.583333333333333
