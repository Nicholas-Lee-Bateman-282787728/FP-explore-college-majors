8053945,3,B0007YCMRI,"I bought this DVD for the B-25 gun camera footage. The seller's description, ""...factories, railroad yards, bridges, towns and anything else that moves. You can see people and animals..."" really excited me. I thought, oh man, I'm going to see some real carnage here...

The DVD does contain a tremendous amount of gun camera footage of B-25s strafing everything in sight. And it did completely surprise me, and changed the way I think of those B-25 gunship missions. The B-25s are mostly strafing empty fields! For most of the footage, there are no targets in sight. At best, they're firing at some empty villages and maybe an occasional lonely factory. But the ""people and animals""? There is one cow that the DVD editor slowed down and pointed out with an arrow, and a second cow much later on that they probably didn't see. People? There were probably some hiding out in those fields, but I didn't see any.

The video really did amaze me, because I fully believed that B-25s in WWII attacked actual enemy targets. As it turned out, they pretty much flew at tree-top level, presumably in their designated target areas, pressed down their triggers and fired long bursts at the ground, flying straight and level. There's no aiming, not even spray-and-praying. They just fill long straight stretches of dirt with .50 cal ammunition. In the entire hour or so this footage ran, I did not see a single truck, car, APC, tank, artillery piece, flak gun, parked aircraft, bunker, or even something as trivial as a few barrels of oil. Most of it is poor innocent bushes and trees getting the crap shot out of them.

Like I said, amazing footage, just not in the way I expected it to be.",1142467200,7,1677,4.697278911564626
