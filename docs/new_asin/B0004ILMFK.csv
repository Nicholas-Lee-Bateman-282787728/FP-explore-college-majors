8036133,1,B0004ILMFK,"The Raymarine C-Series color displays arrive with a 58 page

Installation manual, a half-inch thick Owners Manual, a 15

page weather resistant Operating Guide all sprial bound. The

documation is oustanding.

This DVD is nothing but sixty boring minutes in living color

of a hand pushing various buttons while the display is in the

simulator mode. You can do the same thing on your boat or on

your kitchen table with a 12 volt power supply from Radio

Shack. In fact I recomend this training at home since you will

get more from it than the distraction on your vessel.

If you want to throw away twenty bucks then by all means

buy this video. Otherwise... read the manuals supplied by

Raymarine. They are excellent! And if you want to know more

about marine radar I highly recommend David Burch's ""Radar

for Mariners which includes a truly useful DVD.",1114214400,26,860,4.684563758389261
