4113862,5,B003E697ME,Another great movie on the LMN channel. I own it! A young woman falls in love with her married lawyer who she works for as an intern.,1366243200,,133,3.962962962962963
4113863,4,B003E697ME,"Nothing planned for a lazy day?  This is a great way to spend a few hours.  The movie is filled with all that you would expect to keep your interest - murder, romance, betrayal.  What more could you ask for?  And just as good the second time around!",1354579200,3,249,4.125
4113864,4,B003E697ME,"Movies like this are good b/c they emphasize a very important life lesson:

IF HE/SHE DID IT WITH YOU, DON'T BE SURPRISED WHEN HE/SHE DOES IT TO YOU!!!",1307491200,6,151,4.392857142857143
4113865,4,B003E697ME,Typical lifetime movie worth watching,1440633600,,37,6.6
4113866,2,B003E697ME,I almost did not read the book because the movie was not done very well. The story is weak and the characters not well developed. Very glad that I did read the book because it is almost like a completely different story. I give the movie 2 stars but the book 4 stars.,1440633600,,267,4.056603773584905
4113867,5,B003E697ME,"A real good movie.  The male character was real piece of work, but I'm sure there are people like this person in real life.",1433116800,,123,4.125

4113871,2,B003E697ME,I did not overly enjoy the movie. I was an extra in it and did not understand it when it was being filmed in Calgary and was not overly impressed after viewing it. Maybe the book is better.,1420934400,,189,4.0

4113875,1,B003E697ME,"I could not believe this had a four star rating.  It was a movie version of a daytime soap opera; which I hate.  A story line that was implausible, random occurrences that were convenient for the story but were totally senseless or improbable, characters that were so unbelievable that they were a joke all added up to  mindless waste of an hour and a half.  Why did I watch it you may wonder?  Because my wife wanted to see how it ended.",1404000000,4,438,4.2926829268292686
4113876,5,B003E697ME,Great movie to watch on movie nights! Interesting twist. Glad I found it. I hope everyone enjoys them as much as I did!,1394668800,,119,4.217391304347826
4113877,1,B003E697ME,THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE STORYLINE IS SO STUPID! THE TITLE DEFINATELY DESCRIBES THE MOVIE; IT'S ABOUT A YOUNG MARRIED COUPLE WHO'SLIFE TURNS UPSIDE DOWN WHEN A NEW INTERN JOINS A LAW FIRM WHERE THE HUSBAND WORKS AND DOES EVERYTHING IN HER POWER TO RUIN THEIR MARRIAGE. IT SUCKS! DONT SEE IT YOU WILL BE DISGUSTED JUST AS I WAS. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO A FRIEND; I VALUE MY FRIENDSHIP WITH THEM TOO MUCH!,1392249600,3,446,4.321428571428571
4113878,4,B003E697ME,"A successful news producer with a bright future, Jill Plumley (Josie Bisset) decides to forsake her career in favor of her new role--the devoted wife of her lawyer husband, David. One day, while at David's company party, a sexy young student named Nicole boldly tells Jill that she's going to steal her husband--a courageous yet ironic assertion, considering that 4 years ago, Jill stole David away from his ex-wife.

Now that Jill is Mrs. David Plumley, could young Nicole be the other woman that Jill had been? Then, when David's boss is killed in his sleep and his wife confesses to the murder but claims self-defense, an overwhelmed Jill turns to old friend and fellow journalist Pete Henderson (Jason Priestley) to find out the truth. Based on the best-selling novel by Joy Fielding.

It was also interesting seeing Jason Priestley who is best known as the foxy Brandon Walsh on BEVERLY HILLS 90210 and Josie Bissett whom is best known for her role as sexy designer Jane Mancini on MELROSE PLACE, co-star in this drama together, especially since MELROSE PLACE was a spinoff of BEVERLY HILLS, 90210.",1390780800,,1103,4.893048128342246
4113879,4,B003E697ME,enjoyed this movie from beginning to end! it kept the viewer in suspense the whole time! the deceit of the husband added to the suspense!,1388620800,,137,4.52
4113880,3,B003E697ME,It was pretty predictable and did drag quite a bit.  Not much of a real plot and no known actors.,1375228800,,97,3.85
4113881,3,B003E697ME,"For a friend........not for me, so I really don't know about the storyline. The friend liked it, because I hadn't heard otherwise.",1369958400,,130,4.954545454545454

8395377,5,B003E697ME,I ordered this since the movie rarely plays on Lifetime anymore. It is a mystery type movie that Peaks your interest and keeps you guessing until the surprise ending.  Josie as always been one of my favorite actresses since Melrose Place. She continues to show her acting ability in all type rolls. Great cast of characters and a movie I enjoy watching over and over. Would definitely recommend this movie.,1520640000,,406,4.8
