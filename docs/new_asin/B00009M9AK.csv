Narrated by the late Walter Brennan with music by Robert Russell Bennett it is a sympathetic and realistic view of the American Indians in the western US, especially the Trans-Mississippi West.  Although this would be considered outdated it still does a fine job of demonstrating the culture of the Native America especially pantheistic religious view and the treatment of the natural surroundings.  The Native American lived with nature not against nature which created the tragic clash of cultures.  This was most valuable in teaching Western History to High School students.",1375315200,4,647,5.313725490196078
