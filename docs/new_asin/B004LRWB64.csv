8434718,5,B004LRWB64,"I saw it 50 years ago and I tried to buy it in Europe since more than 20 years. I still don't understand that a french movie is unabled to be found in France but is available in the USA, and even more, in french language.
However, such  a silly situation makes me smile and the main fact is : I got it, at last !

I love it. The story is not dated and could have been realised yesterday. The piano jazz sketches are great. A vanished period; Gainsbourg himself as player...",1416873600,,473,4.075268817204301
8434719,4,B004LRWB64,This film features Nico at one of the finer times of her career. I certainly felt it was worth purchasing.,1360886400,2,106,4.35
8434720,5,B004LRWB64,"As a hard core Nico freak,this was the missing item. I hadn't checked for awhile,and I was pleased to find I could see it at last after all these decades. It's a nice transfer,and looks really good.

Nico is just fun to watch in this,and some shots of her eyes give an early look at will become the basis for some of her parts in the Warhol films. But the best suprise is that this is a really good film. After being hidden for so long you start to assume it's because it's bad. Not true. It works on alot of levels,and is often very funny(for the right reasons). I think of one amusing quote from the owner of the club about her....""well,she has alot of guts...or she's an idiot"".

Even if you're not a Nico fan,if you are looking for a French film of this style and era,this should work for you.",1333756800,9,797,4.2026143790849675
8434721,5,B004LRWB64,"The movie tells the story of Ariane, a ballet dancer who loses the principal role in her company and then she accepts a job to do strip-teases in a club. The story is simple, but this French movie is very good and has the wonderfully beautiful and talented Nico as the star. The strip-teases scenes are very classy, especially as played by Nico, with little nudity. There is a biographic scene when Nico told that she already has been in a birthday with fireworks, remembering her childhood in the war devastated Berlin.

This is the only mainstream movie Nico has starred, aside the alternative movies she has made with Andy Warhol, Paul Morrissey and Philippe Garrel.

As from the title song, look for Nico's version, present in the CD box ""Le Cinema de Serge Gainsbourg"", much better than the melodramatic Juliette Grco's version that opens the movie.

This DVD is a must have for all Nico fans, the interviews with the writer of her biography, Richard Witts, and with the musician and one of her few true friend, Lutz Ulbrich, add great value to this DVD. The quality of the audio and of the video is excellent and it's a great French movie.",1315958400,19,1145,4.630541871921182
8434722,4,B004LRWB64,"It is a shame that France did not release this beautiful 1960's gem years ago after all it is a French Film). Simply beautiful, out of the ordinary. A kind of French-sentimental-comedy-meets-mondo-film (lots of night-club sequences).And the opening titles song by Juliette Grco, written by Serge Gainsbourg, definitely unforgetable. Some film genres are simply forgotten by the DVD industry.",1310169600,12,391,5.6440677966101696
