She says she has ""Potty Power"" and that she's a ""big kid"" just like in the video.  I can't say enough good things about it...you have to try it to believe it  :)",1104796800,8,284,4.30188679245283
2075099,5,B0002B55DO,"Our daughter is now going potty thanks to Potty Power. She loves the video and asks to watch it everyday. Since receiving this video she sat on the potty a lot more than usual (she has a baby sister which had slowed things down) Now she is going to the potty all the time. She takes the potty to the ""big"" potty and flushes bye-bye which she learned from once upon a potty. She also loves to yell ""Potty Power!"" when she went successfully. I am so thrilled with this video.

I also recommend this video for children with mild disabilities.",1103328000,5,539,4.336633663366337
2075100,5,B0002B55DO,"Ok, the truth is that, while I love my son tremendously,  I could never muster the level of enthusiam that these people deliver.  My son loves this video, and I believe he has learned from it.  If nothing else, he sees potty training as a positive thing, and that is worth the 10 bucks.  The woman who narrates this video is almost heroic in her presentation.  Buy it.",1100649600,14,368,4.352941176470588

It shows the kids why they need to use the potty, how to do it and what to do afterwards.  My daughter who is 2 1/2 yrs. really likes it.  We are still working on her going potty but the video has really helped.

Both my kids now are saying Potty Power and No more diapers! He's not trained yet but this was the perfect first step in potty training. We've watched it multiple times and is a cute short movie to pop in for 30 min and get the kids thinking about using the potty. Kept their interest the entire time!",1490486400,,441,4.080459770114943

2075118,5,B0002B55DO,"My son had turned three and was mostly potty trained.  He would do really well, but only if he was naked on the bottom.  If he wore a pull-up, if he wore underwear, if he wore pants, he always peed.  This went on for months and months.  We tried books, we tried new undies, we tried potty chairs, movies, etc.  He couldn't have cared less.  Finally, I ran across Potty Power, and it clicked!  At the same time, I let him know that we were all done with diapers and stopped buying them cold turkey.  When I had three left, I let him know that after those, he was going to be a big boy and use the toilet from now on.  After having watched Potty Power, he was looking forward to it, finally!  He became much more aware of his body signs, and he became fully trained (day AND night) within just a couple days.  When he has to go, he says ""I need to have Potty Power!"", and he runs off to the bathroom.

I like that they show other kiddies on their potties as I think my little one thought I was fibbing about other kids using the potty.... It's a cute video, although it wasn't quite enough to get my little one to potty train. It did however keep me from looking like a liar to my sceptical toddler.",1465862400,,449,4.232558139534884

The music is very engaging and my kids wanted to use the potty like big kids:) For us my son was 20 months when he showed interest in us using the potty and 2.5 3 he had learned to use the potty 95% of the time. With my daughter she was 22 months and used the potty most of the time by the time she was 2.5. Now with my youngest is 18 months and shows interest but I don't want to push it so we'll buy the dvd and let him hear the music....let him tell us when he is ready.
The child led way has worked well for us because trying to get a toddler to use the potty? LOL makes my hair curl thinking about it!

2075133,5,B0002B55DO,"I am a 28 year old first time Mommy. My husband and i first started potty training our triplets when they were 15months. Since they are my only kids, everything with me is new and a learning experience with only references from relatives with no experience in the triplet department. Nonetheless, i was always told not to rush your children to potty train but with so many kids learning earlier nowadays and the fact that we go through 2boxes of diapers weekly, i figured we could introduce them to it and see how it goes. At 15months old we did just that and it went ok. We would put them on it in the morning when i knew they had to use it and wait...and wait...and wait. After about two months they each would use it at least once a day so i was impressed and decided to start full time in the winter (we started in the spring of last year). However, my husband got a better job offer in a different state by the end off the summer and we decided to move. I stayed with my mother for two months until my husband found us a place and because i had to finish closing our current home in the state. During that time everything was so hectic between packing and moving that i didn't even attempt to continue the potty training routine for about a month and didn't really try to start again until we moved to the new state....thinking that we'd just pick up where we left off. That was a mistake! (Never slack off or stop training once you start). Once settled into our new home,i tried to begin the potty training process again and they weren't having it. They wouldn't even pee and they would hold their poop for So long that they'd get constipated so we purchased all new potties (2nd mistake). Although getting new potties is a great motivational tool for many kids, it was horrible for us with ours for the simple fact that we found their overall refusal to use their potties was simply because they were going through too many changes at once. We moved twice since their potty training began,moved away from family, bought them into a new town with a new house, and now we were getting them new potties. They were holding onto the diapers because that's what was familar to them and represented security and not change. So we held off potty training again and focused on getting them comfortable with their new home. They've adjusted really well here after 4months and turned 2 recently. They've started showing signs of independence since January of feeding themselves and helping clean up,etc. They copy everything on tv so i figured a dvd about potty training should be a piece of cake but with my triplets it has to keep their attention while motivating and teaching. I purchased this DVD along with Elmo's and after only watching this dvd only once,i ended up giving the Elmo dvd away lol(i watched half of the Elmo one so i won't do a negative review. I really didn't give it a chance once i looked at this one). This dvd has songs to keep them locked in,vibrant colors,kid interaction, and it teaches better than any other dvd I've seen. My babies love it. They dance along and sing and clap while they're sitting on their potties and my son (baby B) has both pee'd and pooped in his potty everyday since. He'll clap and yell ""potty power!!!"" with his fist in the air like the kids in the dvd. Mind you, he was always the most stubborn to go since day one of potty training last year. My other two pee on the potty but it's better than nothing so we reward them all with claps and a high five and stickers! It's only been day 3 of using this dvd but i am overly impressed at what it's done thus far. At this rate,they'll be potty trained in no time. The dvd is really corny to adults but it's not made for us,it's for kids and its made perfectly for them. They also have a section at the end where they talk to parents. It's awesome!

I should also add that it teaches the basics which, for boys, doesnt involve peeing while standing just yet but i don't see a problem with this either because kids need one lesson at a time. My husband plans to show my 2boys ""how to pee like a man"" Once they've mastered the basics!! Good luck",1458432000,5,4139,4.36139896373057

My daughter will be 5 in October and has been potty trained for quite some time now and I owe a lot of the ease of her potty training to this DVD. I tried to potty train her around 2 and she did not get it and had too many accidents, so I waited till 2 years 8 months and I purchased this DVD and had her just sit in the living room with her potty and watch it over and over.  I completely switched her over to panties and in public just took her to the bathroom like 7 times in an hour. Anyway she was basically potty trained in a week or 2 and had maybe like 3 accidents.

2075156,5,B0002B55DO,"This DVD isn't a special effects blockbuster nor does it star any famous, furry celebrities, but in our house, it succeeds wildly without those. It's on rotation in the DVD player for weeks at a time. The format involves a little bit of audience interaction, a simple-to-understand presentation of a concept, and then a catchy little song to reinforce the idea. (By catchy, I mean EVERYONE in the house is singing it at some point.) I could take or leave the goofy rhyming princess skit at the end of the DVD, but it does sort of tie all of the potty training concepts together to show the ups and downs of the potty training process in an amusing-for-a-kid way. However, that's just a small part of the program, and my little one seems to enjoy it. There is also a short presentation at the end for parents with tips for potty training (sorry, no catchy tunes).

This DVD has been useful for us for a few reasons. The first is that it shows kids who are our little one's size and age learning how to use the potty. She very much mimics what she sees so she has been willing to try some of the concepts she sees. She also loves to sing and dance, and this DVD incorporates music quite a bit into teaching about potty training. Another good thing about this DVD is that the content and terminology are appropriate for very young children. It's just the right amount of information kids that young need to know about potty training.

Our daughter was 2 when she first saw this, and I think it would still be entertaining and helpful for slightly older kids as well. Even though our daughter loves books, Potty Power has made much more of an impact on her learning about potty training than any other media we have used with her so far.",1434067200,,1733,4.429467084639499

That was pretty surprising as she loves music, singing, and the like, so I was sure she'd like this DVD.  I ended up getting her another DVD, that she loved,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Go-Potty-Go/dp/B002XKE1SM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Go Potty Go</a>.

Although my daughter didn't seem to be particularly impressed with this DVD, it was a favorite of my son's when he was potty training--he's now five years old.  He watched this DVD so many times that he knew all the words and could sing along whenever he watched it.  LOL  The best part is that while watching the DVD he very happily sat on his potty and oftentimes we would get some positive results!

I recently passed along this DVD and some others to my cousin who has a toddler aged child.  He is now being potty trained.  My cousin tells me that he LOVES this DVD and has no problems sitting on his potty while he watches.  I guess this DVD is great for some kids, while not so great for others.  Isn't that typical of life?",1431993600,,1339,4.642553191489362

She loves this video!  Although she has been VERY stubborn about even beginning to potty train, she is comparing herself to  the princess in the story and has agreed to begin training on her birthday. All of the characters in this video are fun to watch. The songs are cute, the explanations of potty training are perfect for three and four year olds, and my daughter actually sat and watched it several times.  I will play this video for her every day until we achieve success! I have potty trained six other children but NEVER had as much trouble as I am having with the youngest!

2075170,4,B0002B55DO,"My daughter loves this. She just turned two and she chooses what she wants to watch and she picks out this DVD a lot. She says potty power and shoots her arm up in the air. In my opinion, the kids are all 3 and 4 years old. Most parents potty train their kids between 1-2 1/2, so my only complaint is how the kids aren't the same age as the audience who is watching the DVD(in my case, I'm not speaking for everyone.) Other than that, she likes to sing along and she goes into the bathroom and brings out her potty chair when they start talking about it. She pulls her pants down, I take her diaper off, and she just sits and doesn't actually pee or anything and then says all done. Every child does learn at their own time and own pace. So I can't say if the DVD ""works"" or not because every child will have a different reaction and interpretation of the DVD itself. The singing from Jessica is annoying for parents like me, but she catches my daughter's eyes. Overall, for the low price, I say it's worth trying it out.",1426636800,,1021,4.161616161616162

2075179,5,B0002B55DO,"My daughter loves this movie and has definitely been encouraged to use the potty after this. We checked it out from the library a couple of times to try it out, but now we have our own. My daughter loves this movie so much we ended up needing to get our own copy. She loves the songs and the princess story at the end. She isn't really into princesses at all, but she thinks the jester is hilarious.

It is a very cheesy video and the production is cheap, but it shows a lot of kids using the toilet and dancing, which kids love. Just goes to show kids don't need super fancy animation. The kids look to be about 3 and 4 and my daughter loves videos that show real kids that look about her age. One of the kids looks just like one of her little friends (she thinks it is her friend) so she likes to point to the screen and say her friend is using the potty.

There's a part in the video where they demonstrate wiping on a teddy bear (Such a great idea. A lot of potty books and movies don't talk about that part!) and the kids who sing the wiping song look to be between 6 and 8 years old. Some little ones look up to older kids and siblings so I can see how this would appeal to a little kid.

My daughter knows the words to most of the songs and sings them with the dvd and throughout the day. She loves the washing hands song.

The princess segment might make you think that this dvd is geared more toward little girls, but there's a king and male jester in the segment and it's not super girly. There's no pink unicorns or glitter rainbows, etc. The potty chair is green, the princess wears a white dress, the queen wears red. There's no girly stuff and the princess does things all kids do, not just girls. If they'd used a prince for the segment instead of a princess all the girl's moms would be crying out ""This video is for boys!!"" Maybe they should have used boy and girl twins for the segment?

I think a little boy would get the point of a segment rather than being like ""ick, girly stuff"". If you're showing this to a 2 or 3 year old boy I doubt it will matter if there's a princess in the video for a few minutes. Also this boys little boys standing to use the toilet. There's a ton of boys in the video, and the princess segment is probably less than 5 minutes long. You can skip it if you're terrified of your young man being feminized by a potty video.

Kind of worried about the reviewer's child who said ""this is stupid, turn it off"" because I'm guessing the poor child has a bad home environment if she knows that word (at potty training age? 2 or 3 years old? really?) and thinks its okay to talk to a parent like that. I wouldn't take that review seriously, I believe its probably a fake.

I have a very stubborn child who is super resistant to any changes, and this has helped us. I have a couple of Listmania lists of different things we have used for potty training, so if you want to check those out please do. You can go to my profile to find the link to them. My daughter has been potty trained since she was 18 months old and we have used a ton of things since then to keep her on track and motivated.",1421280000,,3130,4.087947882736156
2075180,5,B0002B55DO,"I have two boys and a girl. All three trained right at 23-25 months old with the help of this video.  We used it in conjunction with a three-day potty training method (which takes more like a week, at least for my kids).  We had them start watching Potty Power about 4-6 weeks before we attempted training, and then we initated the potty training and had them keep watching the video daily for a few weeks until we were down to zero accidents.

I think the video works equally well for girls and boys.  The success of the video is really in how it gets the toddler mind working and associating using the potty with some of the other activities they like to do.  There's a baby or big kid section of the video that seemed to really appeal to all my toddlers. Most toddlers want to be big kids and the Potty Power DVD frames up using the potty as a indicator one has made the transition to Big Kid.  We made sure that every time there was potty success, we called out Potty Power and congratulated our Big Kid!

All of my little toddlers were very proud of their potty power.  My youngest has been trained for a month and he still does his potty power cheer a few times a day.",1421280000,,1174,4.209821428571429
2075181,5,B0002B55DO,"My 3-year-old daughter was very resistant the first time I started potty training her at age two. She absolutely did not want to do it and was not interested in it at all. Five days ago we got this DVD in the mail along with an Elmo potty book and some small figurine like toys (as prizes for going in the Elmo potty chair we already have). The day before we actually began fully training, we let her watch the show and she watched the entire movie; I was intrigued. The next day my husband and I began the ""naked"" potty training method and we watched the show once again. She, again, watched the whole thing. She of course made several accidents, but she went in the potty once on this first day! The second day she asked to watch this DVD and she went in potty 4 times with a few less accidents. I was surprised to say the least! The third day was similar to the second with few accidents and much success. Our daughter has been asking to watch this movie two or three times a day since her first time watching it. We've been training for a few days still will accidents here and there, but she is getting it we have been incorporating it into our routine in our home. That's all it really takes even for my stubborn little girl it seems :)

The show displays young boys and girls ages 2-4 sitting on the potty, washing hands, and singing songs about the potty (which my daughter absolutely loves). The host of the show is very friendly and personable to the children also. It's a 30 minute show, but get ready to unconsciously sing these songs all the time even when your kid goes to bed. ""No more diapers for me, I'm going to use the potty, gonna give it a try!"" ""What do you like to do while you're sitting.... on... the potty?!"" Hahaha.

Since watching this dvd, she'll go sit down on it by herself, although she hasn't actually pee'd or pooped yet. It's a step forward and I'll take it. I have a feeling the transition will go a bit smoother and this dvd has helped.

I will say, I hate the play at the end. The jester is creepy and I feel they could have executed the point in a much better way. My 2 year old seems okay with it though and it's not meant for adults anyway. I've been told that the woman narrating and singing sounds annoying, yes maybe, but it's also the perfect voice at the same time.

It goes through all the steps of what to do when you need to go potty, with everything from wiping, to flushing & washing your hands. Several cute songs to go with each, and being proud to be a big kid, that now gets to wear big kid underpants! Ends with now that you can do it yourself, you have potty power.

But, after about a week of throwing our hands in the air and shouting ""Potty Power"" back, she was back on the potty! She watched it a handful of times and I didn't think it was doing much, but it seemed to inspire her to be a big kid again.

A significant part of the movie is devoted to a woman talking into the camera explaining various aspects of potty training. She attempts to be engaging but I think kids really need more of a story line with characters to be engaged. On the other hand she LOVED potty time with bear and Elmo's potty movie. She still watches them all the time.,1373673600,2,420,4.397435897435898

Potty Power is not an elaborate DVD production, but it made an impression on my little girl. My daughter and I watched the DVD together and when her Daddy was home from work they watched it together. The next morning my daughter wanted to try the potty! Victory! In a few days she was using the potty all the time.",1373241600,,547,4.320388349514563

"" We tried giving her praise, putting her in time out, taking away snacks,  but nothing worked.  This kid is 2 learning two languages but would NOT go to the potty. I got desperate.  I know she likes TV so I found Potty Power.
This DVD discusses independence and the lady's bright eyes are engaging,  and the songs are great.  The little skit is clear to understand and the demonstrations of baby vs. Big kid are great.
My baby is potty trained today 100% and she still asks to watch Potty Power frequently.  I think her seeing that's what Big kids do caused her to want to use the potty. So it's not whether she could it's whether she wanted to, and THANK GOD she does. ""No more diapers for me!!""
I hope this helps another Mommy out Daddy because other reviews sure helped me!!

Get this DVD, especially if you have a strong willed child like me. They will watch it,  understand why they should go.  But it will be THEIR decision and hopefully they will go potty! !!",1372723200,,1060,4.308080808080808

The first time we were in target and I asked right as we walked in do you need to use the potty? Nope, so we walked around and went about our shopping and about an hr into it she tells me she has to go! So we race thru the store, make it onto the potty, and she does her business! I cheered so loud that when we came out of the bathroom stall, a line of ladies waiting cheered for my daughter too! It was the best potty training day ever! The pull-ups were gone the very next day and now we're on a two wk accident free streak. I give all the credit to this DVD!",1368144000,2,1042,3.943127962085308

The songs are catchy and it won't be long before everyone knows the words.  I would agree with other reviews that it does seem to be geared a bit more toward girls seeing as the story at the end is about a princess.  I have girls so that was a plus for me.

My daughter is glued to the TV when this video comes on (& she rarely will watch TV for more than 2 minutes at a time).  She watches the entire movie!!!  It's amazing.  We have had this movie for about a week and I have noticed that she is more interested in going to the potty now.  She will just take over her diaper, randomly, and be on her potty.  The movie does help.  I do agree with what another person said about the ""princess"" part of the movie--it does gear itself towards girls, but I think even boys would enjoy this movie.  For parents, after the movie is done, it does go into detail on how to effectively potty-train your child.  This movie is a definite plus for both child & parents in learning how to potty-train!

2075261,4,B0002B55DO,"We have purchased a lot of videos to get this potty party started. This one comes at it from the angle of the child wanting to be a ""Big Kid"". It only uses a ""Potty Chair"", not a real toilet. My son started wanting to use his potty chair again instead of the toilet as he had been doing. It is okay and beats some of it's competition for instruction and encouragement. I think it is contradictory though by singing ""I can do it myself, I'm a big kid now"" but then instructing the child to use a potty seat and asking an adult to empty it for them. Just getting him to sit on the potty is what matters to me, though.
I would also recommend, ""The Magic Bowl"", ""Potty Time With Bear"" and ""Potty Pirate"" for boys. We are watching all four and having some success. However, he requests ""Potty Power"" more than the others.",1358380800,,816,4.203821656050955

We are many years past the potty training stage (kids aged 5 and 8) but it was highly effective for our girl and boy although the story at the end does feature a little girl - however how many movies do girls sit through that have male heroes and still like them. Our son thought it was fantastic.  Only complaint is the songs are SO catchy my husband and I still find ourselves singing ""I can do it myself I'm a big kid now I can do it myself I've got POTTY POWER!"" and it's been at least 3 years since we played the damn thing. I also wonder about the career of the poor girl who is the MC of the video - how did she ever live that down? It must be hard to get a starring role as a hearthrob in Hollywood after you've sung songs about wiping your bottom to a generation of toddlers.. Anyway, well worth the money. Thumbs up!",1357084800,,866,4.034883720930233
2075264,5,B0002B55DO,"I have no idea why this video works, but it does.  I started potty training before my son turned 2 and he was doing great (I used the potty training boot camp - I would not recommend this methid) and then I gave birth to my second son and well things just went down hill from there.  I think we struggled for 6 months of accident after accident after accident, and no self-initiation to the potty.  I basically had to take my son on a schedule and if I missed the schedule then there was an accident. After six months of this, I decided to take a break and went back to diapers.  I would catch my son right before poops and he would go poop in the potty, but not pee. Anyways, I decided to try potty training again after my son pooped in his diaper and went and got a diaper for my mom to change him (she missed his poop cue).  I think someone on a youtube video recommended this video and I decided to buy it. You really have nothing to lose.  Well I sort of got lucky and the day the video came, Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood had a potty episode (if you have to go potty stop and go right away song). A couple of hours after the episode we watched the video and suddenly my son is yelling ""potty power"" and ""that's my potty chair!""!!! The first couple of days I still did the schedule and some stickers, but instead of going to the potty, my son is using his ""potty power"". Well, a couple of days after he actually told me that he had to go potty!! I nearly cried!! I rewarded him with a car that he had wanted (Mater) and his eyes told me that he knew he had done something special.  He's had maybe one accident and it was really my fault.  It's cold here and he wears jeans (I don't have enough warm sweats for him to wear), so he needs help getting his pants off.  But he is telling us when he needs to use the potty and loves yelling ""potty power!!!""  I think he is figuring out that he can't wait until the very last minute to go.  I don't know if the video sends some sort of subliminal message, but whatever, it worked!! I definitely recommend the video. This is what has worked for us and what I would recommend based on our experience.  If you are having a second child wait until after the baby is born to start the potty training, or start well before the baby comes.  We tried doing the cleaning of accidents, although my son now knows how to put wash clothes this did not deter him from accidents at all.  He actually enjoyed it.  Shaming/getting upset, taking away toys at accidents just made my son not want to have anything with the potty. I think he just blamed the potty for the ""bad"" things that were happening, not the accidents. If you do naked days, you will just end up cleaning pee.  One thing that I did the second time around was getting rid of diapers at night.  We covered the mattress with a pad and some plastic bags and have not looked back.  Don't let your kid feel the stress that potty training is causing you, because it's really not worth it.  Don't be afraid of accidents while going out, get a travel potty if you are a germaphobe like me.  Feel free to stop training and go back to diapers if it's just too much stress on you and your child! Good luck!",1356998400,,3191,4.157723577235773

The songs are cute and catchy and I found myself singing along to them right along with my son. My son is now 4 years old and he still asks to watch that video occasionally.

After 1 showing of this video, he ran to the potty and did his thing. After two showings, he absolutely refused to wear diapers. On the third day of watching the video once or twice daily, he's used the potty happily and washed his hands of his own initiative 7 times today, and is extremely proud of himself. As are we! :)
The songs are totally hokey, but he thinks they're cool and the impact of the visual 'peer pressure' to be like the big kids has worked pretty much instantly. I imagine by the end of the week he will be totally trained for daytime, and it's honestly been basically effortless on my part! Following his cues with the great help of the Potty Power video has equalled immediate success!
Wished there was a little boy equivalent to the fairytale at the end, but he doesnt seem to be bothered by it, so i guess my opinion is a bit moot! In any case, thanks immensely for this parenting aid!",1347494400,,1173,4.336363636363636

This is not top notch acting and it wasn't filmed with a million dollar budget - this is quite obvious, but the songs are catchy, and my daughter will sit and watch the entire video...almost, she loses interest at Princess and the Potty, but she loves the rest.  She has been running around the house shouting ""Potty Power!""

2075274,5,B0002B55DO,I have never ever written a product review before but I felt I it was owed here. My daughter is three in about a month and has not shown any interest in potty training before. We have had a potty for her since she was a year and a half. She played with it a little but that was it. She was one of those kids who didn't care if she was sitting in a poopy diaper or not. I put this video on for her and she wanted to watch it over and over all day long. She loved it! By eleven in the morning she wanted to sit on the potty and asked for her diaper off. She's in bed now and went successfully on the potty six or seven times and even poop once. I have no other explanation besides potty power is for real! It took my uninterested child and made her into a potty enthusiast.,1342742400,,771,3.825

Found this DVD and let him watch it everyday.  I didn't talk to him about it, I didn't bother him, just played the dvd everyday for a week.  That's all it took.  He decided to potty on his own after watching it.  I've since lended it to several friends who have had great success with it.  Now that I have another child who is getting ready to potty train I'm having to buy a new Potty Power DVD for him since so many people got use of my old one and it was never returned.  I like to think it's still out there helping some other parent and child. It's totally worth the money to get a new one.  :D",1335744000,,769,4.033112582781457
2075277,5,B0002B55DO,"We knew our 3 year old would revert after the birth of her sister in December, but she was never fully potty trained before the baby came so we weren't too stressed about it yet.  She is a smart girl so it was getting very frustrating that she was not cooperating.  We tried different potty seats, chairs, rewards (candy, toys), sticker charts, peer pressure, but it just did not faze her.  She would go #1 every now and then in the potty but would not go #2 at all.  She would get her reward then have accidents the rest of the day.  I came across Potty Power online and ordered it thinking that maybe it would help her ""get it,"" but I wasn't too excited about it. We watched it one time, and she immediately wanted to go use the potty.  I thought okay, maybe there is something to this.  That evening we watched it again, and for the first time in a year she went #2 on the big potty!  I wanted to cry with happiness, but I didn't want to get too excited in case it was one time thing.  She watched the video one other time (the very next day), and she still sings the songs around the house, and she made me walk into her room to help her say ""bye bye diapers.""  She has had maybe 3 #1 accidents since the purchase of Potty Power a month ago, and that has been when she's been busy playing outside.  Other than that she has gone on her own to the restroom or with a few reminders that it might be time to go.  I highly recommend this video to parents with an older toddler who is being stubborn about potty training.  The video is short enough to hold their attention, and it's not too painful for adults to watch it with them.  Hey, if it works then who cares, right?  It worked for us, and I have recommended it to my friends as well.",1333929600,,1739,4.103550295857988

2075283,1,B0002B55DO,"As in: Astoundingly bad, in so many ways. I can't believe how many good reviews this got, and I seriously wonder if these parents watched the DVD with their child.

This is my first review. I typically don't feel like I have the time or energy to review items. This time, however, my experience/reaction has been so counter to the majority of other reviews that I felt I had to share.

Content problems: It sets up a baby/big kid dichotomy that isn't really useful. It's one thing to tell kids that when they become a big kid they'll use a potty, and another to start off a DVD with a direct contrast between baby and big kid in various reals that implies being a baby is not a good thing. Kids develop in different areas at different times, so for a younger kid I could see this section just making some kids feel bad about themselves. In terms of practical potty issues, the DVD shows kids unrolling A LOT of toilet paper for wiping. NOT a behavior I want to encourage. It also takes the whole idea of ""you might have to wait a while"" to a new level, not just telling kids it's OK if they have to wait but making it sound like fun to sit for a long time on the potty. Seriously, if my daughter learned from this DVD she would use 1/5 of a roll of TP each time, and take 15 min to go. We've been working on focusing and going (she's most of the way there, just some motivation issues to step away from play and take time to go to the potty) and after watching this once she wanted to go read books on the potty.

I can't believe the other reviews that talk about walking around singing the tunes later. There's nothing catchy about them (and I say this as someone who is cursed to get the songs from my daughter's DVDs stuck in my head for days). Perhaps that's a good thing, but really, most people I know can come up with better when just noodling around on a guitar or piano.

Production problems: Wow, the production values are low. The sounds is the worst part of it, with levels running up and down (speaking is high, songs are low -- and levels change mid-song sometimes). Whoever created this had no ability with sound recording whatsoever. I was on my computer while we had this running and I looked up and asked my husband why he turned the sound down only to find out he hadn't touched it. Yes, it's that bad.

Annoying factor: So far, the most annoying child's DVD we own. The songs are a stretch lyrically and musically. The woman singing them really has no talent. And the low production values do her now favors. The acting in the princess skit is cheesy and painful. I've watched it twice. Don't think I can handle a third time.

Bottom line: It can only work (and I can't comment on whether or not it does EXCEPT to say that it has been counterproductive in terms of time spent on the potty so far) if we watch it a lot. And I can't handle that.

Current dilemma: What to do with this DVD. I like my friends far too much to pass this along to them. It seems wasteful to trash it. I may have to see if anyone on ebay wants it.",1315094400,5,3043,4.20926243567753
2075284,5,B0002B55DO,"My daughter was reluctant to use the potty, I took a few days off, started a potty prize bag & used this video and she was trained.  5 months later she is still singing the songs on this video.  I would definitely recommend it!  Tried the Elmo Potty DVD & she had no interest at all.

Since we were making very little progress with potty training our three and 1/2 year old son, I thought I'd give it a try. To my surprise he absolutely loved this video, and wanted to watch it again and again. Within a few days of watching this, he started using the potty on his own every once and a while, and removing diapers and pull-ups when we put them on him. Within a couple of weeks he was using the potty without being prompted and within three to four weeks of watching this video he is completely diaper free and very rarely has accidents. While I'm reluctant to claim that this is all due to this DVD, it is highly coincidental that my co-worker's child was also trained on a fairly similar timeline after purchasing/watching this. I'd say it's worth a try for anyone trying to potty train a child! The only potential caveat is that you may find the songs playing on repeat in your mind.. and with titles like ""I Love to Wear My Underwear"" and ""What Do You Do When You Sit On the Potty?"" you won't exactly be wanting to sing these at your desk at work!",1307491200,,1149,4.275229357798165

I disagree with some of the other reviewers here. I think that the jester steals the show. He is a wonderful actor, and I never get tired of watching his shenanigans. The singer/narrator is wonderful too. She speaks to kids on their own level, never talking down to them, and has a lovely voice. The kids in the video are all adorable, and I enjoy watching them too, especially ""Princess Jill."" Lovely little girl.

I tried buying her a potty chair and a potty seat for the toilet. She wouldn't sit on either one.

Then when I search on Amazon and saw that this video had great reviews. I purchased this and watched it with my daughter.  She sat and watched the video with interest and I couldn't help but laugh at the woman in the video b/c she didn't seem to blink at all. Right after watching this video my daughter started going potty in the toilet. I want to say it took two weeks to completely ween her off of using pampers.

2075291,4,B0002B55DO,"After potty training three kids and starting in on my fourth, I am still looking for that ""miracle"" product that will help skip over the weeks and months of potty ""combat.""  Sadly, I don't think it exists.  However, as annoying as this video can be- I felt like it was a very good way for my 29 month old daughter to start understanding about the potty.  Here are some thoughts I have about this DVD:

1. It shows lots of kids going to the potty (not graphic)which my daughter thought was cool.
2. It shows lots of kids sitting on the potty, waiting.
3. It mostly uses a potty seat and shows several different ones.  It also shows a child sitting on a toilet with a potty cover for those interested in skipping over the potty.
4. There are lots of different songs about all kinds of things- washing your hands, what you do on the potty while you are waiting, wiping, etc...
5. They do teach kids that wiping, flushing, washing & drying your hands are part of the job.
6. They refer to ""poop"" and ""pee"" in case you have other names for them.
7. They point out the differences between babies and big kids.
8. They play up how awesome ""big kid"" underwear are.
9. They do have a short skit at the end about a little princess and what gets her to use her potty which was not so great.
10. It contains a potty training Q & A section for parents.

It isn't going to do the job for you, but it does expose kids to what a potty is for and get them (hopefully) interested.  I don't have my two year old watch a lot of tv or movies, so this is a treat for her.  It doesn't feel as annoying as Barney or The Wiggles in my book but her older sniblings hate it.  But for the two year old, it seems to have gotten her attention because she does tell me almost every single time right after she has peed or pooped, so she is getting the associating down.

I would buy it again.  As mentioned before, it isn't the miracle, but it does seem to help.
P.S. Don't waste your money on disposible pull ups.

After he watched it, I got really excited when he immediately wanted to watch it again.  I found the storyline more geared towards girls and the ""friendly host"" Jessica sings and talks like a munchkin.

We don't watch a lot of TV in my house, but I wanted to do the potty training thing ALL the way which is why I implemented the DVD into the process. He was constantly asking to watch it and when he would go pee in the potty he would proclaim, ""Potty Power"". My son is 23 months ended up being very easy to potty train. I wouldn't contribute it all to the video, but I definitely think it influenced him. Seeing the kids sitting themselves on the potty, made him want to do it himself. There is a song about being a big kid and being able to do it all my himself and that definitely helped in convincing him to play along. There is also a song called, ""No more diapers for me"" which made a big impact. We used Pullups at night and naptime instead of diapers for the mental aspect of stepping into them like underwear and now he refuses to wear a diaper. I would recommend this DVD as a helping tool for potty training, but not for anyone younger than my son.",1260403200,,1084,4.093896713615023

He's super smart but something just wasn't clicking. We tried all we knew how. We put the dvd in and he watched it once BAHMMM! He wanted to go potty. Then he watched it over and over and over again! In the video it shows kids throwing diapers in a waste basket, No more dieapers for me, I'm a big kid now. Two days later he takes his diaper off and throws it in the trash. It wasn't even dirty. We were so amazed!! He would still have accidents and we had to actually sneak diapers on him while he was sleeping till he'd wake up dry everynight. He would get mad if we tried while awake. ""I'm a big kid now! I don't wear diapers!!"" I'd say, a little over a month it took before he'd tell us ""I have to go"" or just be in there by himself. We also bought the Go Potty Go video. He liked that equally as well. At the time we didn't know it was made by the same people till we watched the video. Our son would want to watch one then the other.

Well, if this sounds familiar, then ""Potty Power"" is the answer. I bought the 2009 version listed separately on Amazon (don't know the difference but went for the more current date). Dylan began watching it and within a week started getting to the potty instead of the corner. Very impressive.

She LOVES the video, especially the princess story at the end. She's showing more interest in the potty training concept than she ever had previously. I believe this will be what inspires her to use the toilet.
There is one part of the video with which I have an issue ~ it shows how to unroll the toilet paper in a messy, wasteful way. They could easily have explained how to pull it slowly and rip off an appropriate amount. Instead, they show toddlers wildly yanking yards of toilet paper onto the floor, which is worth keeping in mind if you know it's something your kid would latch onto.",1246492800,,727,4.515151515151516

He's been wearing underwear and using the potty for over a week now and I know there is no turning back for him now.

The video is pretty cute with very catchy tunes.  It helps a child understand the differences between babies and big kids, explains how to use the potty, washing hands and offers encouragement that using the potty doesn't happen over night and that it takes a little practice. He asks to watch it with me and sometimes on his own. Too bad they couldn't have included a Prince and the Potty and then we could set our DVD menu for the boy version, but our son doesn't seem bothered by the Princess and the Potty and he does watch that part sometimes.

I ordered Potty Power because it had such great reviews, and my daughter LOVES it! She asks to watch it all the time. It's cute, fun, simple- and not overly annoying to the rest of the family. As soon as she watched it, she wanted ""potty power"" and went on the potty right away! We're still working on her consistency, but I feel she is doing exceptionally well. (Since she is still having a hard time recognizing that she even needs to go until it's too late, I know that she's not totally ready to be trained yet.) Potty Power was able to give her the understanding that I was not, and I am very grateful!

2075352,4,B0002B55DO,"We normally don't let our almost-3-year-old use screen media, but in a fit of desperation we bought the Potty Power DVD because she had regressed somewhat with potty training. She was transfixed from beginning to end and immediately wanted to ""use"" the potty. I use quotes here because, ever since she first saw the video, she has been ""using"" the potty perfectly except for the essential step: peeing or pooping. She pulls down her pants and pull-up, sits on the toilet, and 5 minutes later stands up and proclaims ""I'm done!"" Then she washes her hands, singing ""Wash your hands, wash 'em real GOOD..."" (which drives me nuts because the appropriate adverb is WELL... but whatever). The video has definitely increased her enthusiasm for using the potty. We didn't see the miracle effect that other parents reported, but I'm glad we bought it.

Now for a few words about the video itself. The female narrator is adorable in a Disneyesque sort of way, and the first 80% of the video is populated by equal numbers of girls and boys (who all look like they're between the ages of 3.5 and 4), making the video gender-neutral. (However, parents of boys who are trying to teach them to stand while peeing or to point their wee-wees DOWN while sitting won't get any demonstration in the video.) The final section of the video features a story about a princess, but since girls are constantly expected to shape-shift their experiences and interests to accommodate stories about boys, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect boys to occasionally do the same with stories about girls. My main complaint with the video is that it covers every component of using the potty except elimination itself. There's no mention of the feeling or sound of pee or poop leaving the body and hitting the water or the bottom of the potty chair. Some people might find this gross, but I think such overt, concrete demonstrations are essential for preschoolers. Otherwise all they hear is that the proper protocol is to sit down, amuse yourself for a while, then stand up and wipe.  So as far as my daughter is concerned, she's doing everything absolutely correctly.

Another warning for parents: the neurotic jester character in the final story may inspire homocidal fantasies. He reminds me of Robin Williams pre-rehab. My spouse looked up the actor's webpage and found that he does video clips for the farce newspaper The Onion, which redeemed him in our eyes, but only somewhat. We still find him unbearable to watch. There's a scene where he's alone with the princess, and my spouse and I looked at each other and said simultaneously, ""I'd never leave my kid alone with that guy!"" My daughter thinks he's a hoot, though, so it's cool from her perspective. Also, the editing at the very beginning and end, in which video panels of different potty scenes of kids fly in and out from the top and sides of the screen, made both of us a little queasy.

In spite of these problems, my overall impression of the video is positive. It definitely increased my daughter's enthusiasm for using the potty, and she really enjoys the songs, as do I inspite of the grammatical errors (grrrr).",1231372800,,3155,4.772893772893773

Usually kids start to get annoyed with their mom reminding them of it all the time.  This DVD did the reminding for me.  any time I wanted to remind my 2 year old girl to go potty I would just play the DVD.  They had great songs, they were catchy and they were not annoying at all.  They really did a great job with getting the message to the little ones.

""I did it! I'm a big girl, and I didn't need anyone's help. I didn't even need a potty! Mommy wanted to wait until I was two years old to teach me how to use a potty. Claiming it would be ""easier"" then. Lazy Mommy!

On my 21-month birthday, when no one was looking, I took off my pants and my diaper, and went poo poo in my art desk! I didn't need any training other than the Potty Power DVD my aunt sent me!

(""The Write Desk"" has a bench seat that opens for storage)

Mommy and Daddy were really surprised and bothered when they saw me without my pants or diaper on. I was scared, but I brought them to my room to show them what I did. I was very embarrassed and thought I was going to get into trouble. But when they saw what it was that was making the whole house stink, they were so happy! They sung songs and hugged me! (but not too close) I was still really embarrassed, and really confused by their happiness, but I'm glad they like looking at my poop so much.

I don't know why they were so surprised. Last night Mommy watched as I put each one of my stuffed toys on the bench one at a time, said ""poo poo"".  I had them say bye bye to the poo poo, just like Daddy likes to,  and I closed the bench.

Mommy brought out a little white round thing out of storage, and called it a ""potty"", but it looks strange to me. I think my desk is the perfect poop place, and everyone should try it.

2075358,5,B0002B55DO,"If your child is struggling with toilet training and English is spoken in your home, this video will help get them through it.

Our son had been reluctant to even sit on his potty. We may have pushed him too hard at first - keeping up with neighbor kids whom I believe are either freaks of nature or were pushed too hard by their parents - and this caused him to clearly dread toilet training. To even see it in the room provoked a tantrum, to the point of sincere fear.

We received this DVD as a holiday gift. I took one look at the box and rolled my eyes like the first US domestic TV distributors all passing on Barney and The Power Rangers. Note the success of those two.

And after hours of marathon waiting amidst his groans and whines of not wanting to do it, I put the video on and parked his potty in front of the TV, a towel draped over his knees to keep him warm.

His body responded. Heck, it even made me wanna go. (ha!)

Now, he is peeing regularly after just one screening. We use this in coordination with the cold-feel phase of diapers.

This video is not intended to be a new edition of Sesame Street, which had Children's Television Workshop veteran actors and characters performing for an assumed audience of both under-5 year olds and grown ups, and a budget that could send a man to the moon. These filmmakers spend their resources wisely and do not try to use their video to audition for Jerry Brockheimer.

So, if parents are looking for a potty video aimed at their interests, try Dr. Phil. (It's not about us. We're already potty trained, or are well on our way.)

This video gambles on its pre-reading age Barney the Dinosaur fan base' desperate parents need to move their toddlers out of their comfort zones in bullet-proof diapers, and into the toilet phase of childhood where real underwear awaits them. The gamble pays off.

As many of our son's friends have had the social advantage of older siblings or pre-school peers, pushing them to imitate the toilet-users. Our son is the eldest without pre-school. And until pre-schools are cheaper than Ivy League under grad schools, we'll stick to our current game plan. The $5 video is cheaper than pre-school.

Every single portion of this video is designed to not just teach them how to pee in a modern day toilet, but motivate them to want to by becoming a 'big kid'.

Our son's apprehension turned to excitement before the end of the video.

So, if you're expecting ""The Great Muppet Caper"", or ""Veggie Tales"" or the latest episode of ""Law & Order: Special Potty Unit"", choose between your personal grown-up infotainment, and their need to learn.

(Sorry, previous criticism of this video annoyed me.) The video is under 30 minutes. It's not a lifetime. By the fourth viewing, our son would pee before the first song was finished, at which time I'd stop the video.

The video is not an instructional video for parents on how to demonstrate using a toilet. (That's a different genre.) It's for the kids, period.

And considering the headache that toilet training is, this video effectively does exactly what the title describes, minus the Happy Meal toy.

Its producers should take a bow. (flush). :)

For $5 or so, this video should find its own way onto Dr. Phil's show as an endorsement.",1229299200,2,3270,4.562393162393162

I put on the movie on a portable dvd player sitting on top of the tank of the toilet and let it play while he sat and tried to go potty (he sits facing the tank). Althought i do recommend that first time parents when potty training is that its best to start first thing in the morning. As soon as your child wakes take him/her to the potty start the movie and let them use potty. If they refuse to do so again before nap time, let them go as soon as they get up from a nap. they will get the just of things once they see when they have to go potty and how it feels to know when to go potty.

I read the reviews before buying the video and they are correct about the sound going up and down.  The songs are catchy and having real children in the video I think helped her identify easier than Bear in the Big Blue House (which I bought for my middle child).  She loves singing No More Diapers for Me and Potty Power, and now she plays Baby or Big Kid with her two dolls while sitting on the potty.  This isn't a miracle dvd but it has definetly helped her on the road to being trained; it wasn't overnight but the diapers are pretty much gone except for sleep times and long outings.

The songs in particular are contagious.  They're so catchy that they'll infect not only your child but you too.  I find myself humming the tunes while feeding lunch etc.  The reason this matters is because each song has a central message in the potty process.  Kids get it!

The whole production is a lot of fun but it's also effective. What a combination!

We have a 2.5 year old who had shown all the signs of being potty-ready, as well as interest, but wouldn't use it consistently; she also refused to have a bowel movement anywhere but in her pull-ups. So in searching for some children's books to help her along, I saw the posting for ""Potty Power"" and figured I would give it a try...I actually thought it would be a waste of money and  time, but am thrilled to report it wasn't...that she was actually ""potty trained"" within one day of watching the DVD. She watched ""Potty Power"" the evening the DVD arrived and that night didn't seem all that moved by it, however, the next morning she asked to watch it again...and after it was over immediately went to the potty; by that afternoon she made her first #2 on the potty ever! For the rest of the weekend she repeatedly asked to watch ""Potty Power"", insisted on underwear only...no diapers (except at night) and has consistently made her pee-pee and poop ON THE POTTY!

She is incredibly proud of herself and has gone 10 days now (to day care/preschool, shopping, restaurants, etc.) in panties and no pull-ups. She still asks to watch the DVD every day and often can be heard shouting ""potty-power"" afterwards and singing the catchy songs sung on the DVD. I have shared our experience with this DVD with all of our friends who have small children learning to potty and intend to give it as a gift to friends when their toddlers turn 2!

This DVD is GREAT, it is simple, with catchy songs, and very enthusiastic - also the host has a very child friendly face.  I must admit, it is more so intended for Girls.  They should come out with the ""little prince version"".  Anyway a week from my daughter's 2.5 birthday, she came up to me and told she would like to use the potty.  I assisted her, and she did a number 2! all by herself alone, no toys, no stickers, no books,no bribing, she entertained herself with singing the songs while on the toilet, and when she was done she said ""all done potty"" We exclaimed together POTTY POWER!. We immediately threw out the diapers, that very night, and sang ""No more diapers for me"". I guess she was ready to ""be a Big Kid, that's why"" :).

The problems I have with the other potty training videos/dvd's luckily Potty Power doesn't have. I am very delighted to say. I love the hosts of this dvd. She is very cute and sweet.

The other Potty Training Vidoes / dvds I own are:

Sesame Street - Elmo's Potty Time

Once Upon a Potty for Him.  Has Babies dancing with potty seats, putting potties on their heads among other strange things.

It's Potty Time
I love this on put it does have 2 things that have always bothered me. One the clown at the party takes the boys the go to the bathroom not the parents. And two a little tiny man is in the bathroom withe little girl while is on the toilet

I Can Go Potty! This DVD is mostly for parents and not the kids to watch

2075383,5,B0002B55DO,"This video was recommended to me by a mom who over heard me discussing my frustrations with training my 2 1/2 year old daughter.  I had tried everything and was completely out of ideas.  I read the Potty Training in One Day book from cover to cover and had two failed ""Potty Parties"".  I tried Dr. Phill's method and even used tips from the Potty Whisperer that was featured on the Today Show.  I took her outside to play in just underpants so she could have an accident to see how it felt and I also had a potty chart on the bathroom wall with plenty of stickers to stick on it.  She showed all the signs and then some...and Elmo's Potty Time was her favorite video.  Even the pediatrician said she was definitely ready.  So when this video was recommended to me it was my last hope.  I began reading the reviews and was so excited with the miracle reports of success with this video.  So, in my desperation, I order the Potty Power video at Amazon and had it shipped next day!

When it arrived I put it in the dvd player immediately.  Within 30 seconds of the opening theme song my daughter had taken off her pull up and sat on her potty.  Though she didn't have any successes that first day with the potty, she seemed so inspired by seeing actual kids using the potty.  She wanted to watch the video every waking hour.  We received the video late in the afternoon on June 19th.  By the 24th she was going pee pee all day all by herself in her potty and staying dry during naps.  She knew the routine.  She started poo pooing in the potty all the time by the 27th.

Like I mentioned before, we had been watching Elmo's Potty time for 6 months with no progress.  To her it was just another Elmo video.  I really think that the key here is that other little kids are shown sitting on the potty and going through all the steps of the potty process.  This is something Elmo lacked.  Only two scenes in that video even show anyone on the potty, once with Elmo as a baby and in one video a girl in diapers uses the potty.  I do think that Elmo is a great introduction to going the potty training process for a younger child who isn't actively training.  That being said, this is definitely a video for  the child actively potty training.  I honestly don't believe I would have seen the same results if my daughter wasn't ready to learn.

Obviously, I highly recommend this video to other parents who are actively struggling to potty train their toddlers.  This is actually the first product review I have done...so you know I must have been really impressed!",1214784000,2,2554,4.32

I bought this video just to get her familiar with pottying and brought her little potty in to the living room (which I always said I wouldn't do..HA!) just so she could see it was there. Within minutes she had taken off her diaper and sat on the potty.

By day 4 (with encourgement from us and a treat system as well) she was fully pee and poop trained. Now 10 days later she doesn't even use the little potty but the big potty with a potty ring and she goes in public bathrooms too.

I'm not sure why the jester gets left alone with the little girl, but I may just be over sensitive. All in all, it's a DVD about tolieting.

And, to my surprise there was an added benefit from watching this DVD as a family...my 20 month old began wanting to use the potty also.  He wasn't even 18 months old and he was insisting on sitting on the potty and using it.  So, I am saving money on his diapers now too.  He does not have success every time, but he is on his way to toilet success too.  He proudly wears his ""big kid"" underpants over his diaper, but he would not have it any other way.  He loves his underwear!

It compares going potty to other ""big kid"" things that my 27 month old can't do either; tie her shoes, ride a trike, etc.  I also thought there was too much focus on having to do the whole thing by yourself.  Maybe that part is more appropriate for pre-schoolers that are still asking for help because it isn't appropriate for toddlers just starting out who will need some help along the way.",1209081600,,561,4.41747572815534

I put it in the player when it arrived and the boys quickly removed it, so I put it back in and taped the dvd drawer shut so they couldn't take it out again.  The first day they wouldn't watch it through but they would peek in at it like they didn't want me to know they were watching it.  The next day they played with some toys in the same room while it was on, glancing up at it now and then.  By the end of the first week they were singing along with it and refused to where diapers anymore.  Yes we have had some accidents but the progress they have made in the last three weeks has been amazing!

2075393,4,B0002B55DO,"Inspired by the reviews I read here, I ordered this DVD for my 2 1/2-year-old twin girls. Instant hit. They wanted to watch it over and over (and over). The songs are rinky-dink but catchy (yes, you will catch yourself singing ""No More Diapers For Me"" throughout the day), and my daughters loved them right away. The narrator is a girlish, expressive young woman who looks a lot like Kelly Clarkson, and the girls respond to her with rapt attention. They also love seeing other little kids with potties like theirs.

The DVD emphasizes the transition from baby- to big-kidhood, and the agency of the child in *deciding* to give up diapers in favor of the potty, which is nice since, as you know, toddlers control the universe.

There is also a brief video potty-training FAQ for parents, which is helpful.

All of these things are great, but it's the Princess-and-her-potty story that sort of bugs me--why on earth is that silly jester so keen on getting the princess to wear undies? His inordinate attention to her potty habits sort of creeps me out--but, it doesn't bother my kids, and today one of my daughters peed in the potty for the first time, so I guess we'll keep playing it!",1206576000,,1185,4.633333333333334

A very warm host, Jessica, and an animated toilet paper roll named ""TP"" take you through the steps of using the potty, from waiting on the potty to wiping to washing hands to wearing underwear.  There are several simple songs throughout about the various topics and steps.  There is a cute fairy tale toward the end called ""The Princess and the Potty"" which my son loves.  There is also a ""guessing game"" toward the beginning ""Baby or Big Kid?"" where you guess which one does certain things like build a block tower, need help eating, etc with the last one being 'wears diapers (baby)' and 'uses the potty (big kid)'.  My only negative comment is that that part might be a bit ""shaming"" if a kid isn't ready to give up diapers completely at first--I think my son took this quite seriously and wouldn't use a diaper even if we were out and he was afraid to use the public restroom--but all in all it's a great video and a very useful tool.

The dvd is geared toward older children learning to use the potty, which was great.  The only complaint I have it that it doesn't come with a continuous play option.

Whenever I would ask if she wanted to give up her diaper (Pull-Ups), she basically said she wasn't ready. In an effort not to get into a tug-of-war, my husband and I backed off; not completely. We still asked if she had to sit, but we didn't insist if she said no. A few weeks after her 3rd birthday, my husband and I decided that we would have a potty training weekend. For a few days, we counted down to ""potty day"" and told my daughter that while she was awake, she would only wear big girl panties. We used the Potty Power video, which she asked to watch 2-3 times on Saturday morning. She also wanted to see it on Sunday. But no longer asked for it after the weekend. In addition to the video, we provided small gifts (i.e. a few Beanie Babies over the course of a week; plus a few M&Ms here and there) since she did ""such a great job going potty"". Over the weekend, we ventured away from home and made several visits to public restrooms. To the surprise of my husband and myself, she DID NOT have any accidents over the weekend, and 9 of 10 times now asks to go or goes when prompted. I would recommend Potty Power; especially for girls.

It is a good help for the kids to see someone else, other than Mom and Pop, talk about the subject and the things related, e.g., not needing diapers anymore because of one's age, washing hands, what to do while waiting on the potty.

There is a big kid versus baby segment.  It's really short, but it gave me ideas that I use on my children to get them to do ""big kid"" things like use the potty, eat with utensils instead of their hands, put on clothes themselves, etc.

My children wanted to emulate the kids in the video (a good thing in this case).  On the negative side, the production values are a bit cheesy.  But for kids, it's fine.",1203292800,,801,4.408163265306122
2075403,4,B0002B55DO,"We got this DVD one and a half weeks before my son's 2nd birthday.  He LOVES watching it.  It has peaked his interest in the potty and toilet paper, but his teddybear is now sitting on his potty, not him.  I think he will ""take a seat"" soon.  We have sat him on the potty occasionally since he was 18 months, so he knows what to do...he just isn't doing it, yet.  He is great at taking off all of his clothes and peeing......Just not in the potty.

This DVD shows what a potty chair is (different kinds including the kind that sits on top of a toilet), what to do while you're sitting on the potty (coloring or singing), how to wipe from front to back (the kids demonstrate this on a stuffed animal), how to flush, and how to wash your hands.  It also promotes being a big kid and doing things by yourself and not wearing diapers.  It has both boys and girls, so it's great for either gender.  There are cute songs for each part, too.

The narrator is very sweet and my son loves to listen to and watch her.  She is a cross between Tracy Gold and Janeane Garofalo with a personality sprinkling of Rene Zelweger.  I hope you like those actresses!

The only reason I gave this DVD a 4-star rating and not a 5-star rating is because of the last part.  It is a story of a 3/4 year old princess, her parents, and a jester.  They are all trying to help the princess to want to use her potty.  It is a cute story but my son is TERRIFIED of these medieval characters and their costumes.
The jester bears a slight resemblance to Boy George.  I have never seen my son react this way to anything.  He covered his eyes and started silently crying and walked over to me and asked me to hold him.  He was petrified.  I had to turn off the DVD.  He still wants to watch the DVD, but I have to be ready to ""stop"" it before the scary princess story begins.

We also purchased ""Go Potty Go"".  It does not hold my son's attention like ""Potty Power"" does.

Why the 2 rating? The sound recording is SO TERRIBLE! The sound goes up and down throughout and the woman's voice recording is very tinny.

2075407,5,B0002B55DO,"When I first got this when my child was 2.5, she wasn't interested at all.  I wish I had tried a little harder to make it a routine.  I tried again a few months after that and she protested (threw a huge fit) but I got her to watch it partly that time promising her that afterwards she could watch her favorite scooby do dvd.  From then on, we got into the habit that when she wakes up, we play it before she can watch anything else and she is now watching the full video, singing songs with them, engaging in the quiz, and outside the video I can see her gradually adopt the concepts and slogans.  She wants to be a big kid now and wants to wear her dora underwear that grandma bought her and wants to go to the bathroom a lot!  This didn't happen over night nor after the first two viewings so patience was a must for me.

I stuck with showing this video to her only because I saw the potential in it, otherwise I probably would not have been motivated to keep trying to get her to watch it.  Often in the beginning she didn't watch but bits and pieces of it while she played with coloring or drawing.  I think the kids and catchy tunes finally got to her.

About the video, it has fantastic songs and the children are adorable.

*They play a baby or big kid game where you name the action and who it goes to

*There is a song that points out that they already can do lots of things by themselves and they can add one more thing to that list to learn how to be the big kid that they are which is pottying.

*They explain why babies wore diapers and what big kids do differently.

*There is another song that is *no more diapers for me* and it is sure cute.  It has kids throwing their diapers away, putting them in their drawers, using the potty, waving bye bye to them, and shaking their head when they say No (this age loves that haha!)

*They explain what a potty is for in the kid's terms and involves them in a game to say where a potty can be found in.

*It gives them ideas what to do on the potty until something happens - cute catchy song

*tells them how to wipe by showing it on a stuffed bear and wash hands - both cute catchy songs  (my daughter often says she must wash her hands because that is what the big kids do on potty power)

*Lastly, there is a play that involves a princess, king, queen, and jester.  The princess didn't want to use the potty but ends up using it in the end.  During this play, underwear is introduced.  At first, my daughter wasn't interested in this at all, but after 5 or so viewings, she is now watching it more.  You can bet when she finally started watching it she demanded underwear!  She wouldn't take them off for bedtime but I did convince her to let me put a diaper on under them hehe.

*There is another section to choose that gives some tips for the parent during the potty training period.  Some of the tips were a helpful reminder to me.",1201132800,,2895,4.115864527629234

2075417,5,B0002B55DO,"We started potty-training our daughter at 22 months, so Potty Power was just one part of the training.  It's equally annoying as anything on PBS kids.  The songs are infectious, but they help us to connect with our daughter when it's time to ""wipe your bottom"", for example.  She's still in her nudist phase so we sing ""proud to wear your underwear"" to remind her not to be naked.  It's a short video, but direct, and the princess tale seems like it's just telling the parents to get rid of the diapers and be patient.  However, there is no way we could stand this more than 3 times a day, even with tolerance built up from PBS, so we also got the Elmo's potty time, which runs 45 minutes.  We can ask her if she needs to ""go #1 in the potty like Elmo?"".
Overall, it seems to have an influence on our daughter, and she likes the videos even though she wanders away from them to play.  We used the methods from [...] to train ourselves to be vigilant. I can honestly say after one week (with a vacation over the long weekend to set her back) we only have accidents in the high-chair (because she can't climb out), or when she's really tired.

My son immediately asked to watch it again once he saw it, and by the third time was dancing and singing along and responding to the narrator. He loves the Baby or Big Kid game and I think that is what really made him want to give the potty a try.

And, the results can't be beat!!I am proud to say that after one week of watch the DVD we are now on day 3 of no diapers and going strong!!

2075428,5,B0002B55DO,"I used this DVD along with the book Potty Train Your Child in Just One Day by Teri Crane. I found the book which appealed to me- after long, drawn-out potty training battles with my girls, I was not looking forward to doing that again. I read the book and planned my son's ""potty party"". This DVD was one of the library resources I checked out. We followed the instructions in the potty training book and things were starting to look a little hopeless. My son (3 1/2 yrs old) was NOT interested in sitting down to read potty books and the other 2 videos didn't catch his attention. I was afraid all our effort was going to waste... Then we popped Potty Power in the DVD player. At first, he acted as if it didn't interest him either, then I caught him sneaking peeks at the TV.

I could tell the songs were catching his attention, so I waited for a while, then played the DVD again. This time, when the other kids on the screen proudly displayed their potty chairs, he ran into the bathroom and hauled his new winnie the pooh potty chair out and yelled ""This is MY potty chair!""

By the time the video was winding down, my son was trying to sing ""I'm proud to wear my underwear"" and marching back and forth just like the other kids on the video.

Later on that night, he discovered 2 diapers in his room and his sister helped him throw them away while he shouted ""No more diapers for me!"", making the same hand movements the girl on the video does. He's constantly singing the songs on the DVD all day long and he asks to watch Potty Power several times a day.

I do have to agree that this may not work for all age ranges, but my son just happened to love it. I also agree with another viewer that it can get on the nerves a bit, so put it on for them while you're doing something else. Personally, I can't stand the jester in the ""Princess and the Potty"" story, but hey, it worked, so I just bought it. :) This video worked perfectly and covered almost every obstacle mentioned in the book we used. My son did have a little trouble with going number two and was starting to hold it in, but we found the solution in the book: get his potty doll to have a poo accident and instruct the doll (My son named his doll ""Bob"" with the help of his sisters.) that he's not supposed to poop in his big boy underwear, poop goes in the toilet. That worked too. :) It's been a week since his potty party and my son hasn't had any accidents at all in the last 2 days. :D",1189382400,2,2457,4.144654088050315

2075433,5,B0002B55DO,"I bought this DVD when my son was 3 yrs old and I was at the end of my tether trying to potty train him. This was my last hope.
It worked like a charm!
My son was hooked from the first time he watched it. He kept watching it over and over and over again for many months even after he became potty trained and until he 'outgrew' the DVD.
They make wonderful comparisons as to who is a baby and who a big kid is. The presenter is young lady, who is gentle,very calm and doesn't speak loudly, which helps to get the child's attention! They have not tried to make her look too distracting with costumes or funny hair styles.  Nothing in this DVD distracts the child.
There are so many things happening in the show, like a short play, questions and answers, songs. It seems like a low budget production but they have done their best and have covered all areas needed to help the child learn to be potty trained. The background music is medium tempo as is all the songs, it is not a fast paced or upbeat DVD. It is very appealing and the message is sent out very clearly. There are many many kids featured in this DVD who are sitting on the potty, reading a book or just thinking! and it looks realistic to the child watching it because it is what they typically do when they themselves are sitting on the toilet/potty. The songs are catchy with simple, clear lyrics and my son learned them in no time at all. we still sing them once in a way!
I kept my son's potty near the TV and he learned how to know when he should sit on it, by watching this DVD. I owe them a HUGE HUGE THANKS!! :)
I recommend this DVD to any parent tearing their hair out....over potty training! Good luck!",1188432000,2,1674,4.150769230769231
2075434,5,B0002B55DO,"This DVD is worth its weight in gold.  My three year old daughter was physically more-than-ready for potty training, but emotionally and mentally she was just not ready - very resistant and didn't even want to SIT on the potty.  I thought I would give this a try.  The second it arrived in the mail she wanted to watch it... and imagine my surprise when it had been playing for less than a minute and she asked if she could sit on her potty while she watched it!  She proceeded to sit on her potty for three straight viewings of the DVD.  By the second viewing she was singing along with the songs.  AND SHE HAS NOT WORN A DIAPER SINCE!!(It's been over two weeks now.)  In fact, later that same evening she informed me that I could get rid of her diapers, because ""Diapers are for babies, and I'm a big kid now!""  Something about the way this DVD was done made her become excited about potty training and removed her emotional resistance.  As far as I'm concerned this DVD is pure genius!

However, I do have to say that I don't know if it would work as well for younger kids, or kids who are not quite sure about the physical aspect of potty training yet.  I think it is designed for the kids who can tell you when they have to go, but just refuse for whatever reason to use the potty.  Even younger kids would enjoy watching the DVD, though - the songs are very cute & even my older daughter was singing along.  And my three year old still sings the underwear song every time she puts on her panties.  :)

Anyway, I will be recommending this DVD to everyone I can think of who might need it.  If it worked for my extremely opinionated, independent and stubborn little sweetpea, I think it would work for almost any kid who is ready for it.",1187913600,,1741,4.246200607902735

He knew how to potty & he showed all the signs of being ready to be potty trained, he knew we wanted him to go on the potty, but he just didn't care about it.  No amount of rewards, praises, CANDY would get him to ""go.""  He'd rather sit in yucky pants than pull himself away from whatever he was doing for two minutes to pee.  If you're in this situation get the dvd.  Parts of the video are annoying.  But, we didn't even have to watch it more than 5 times-TOTAL.  Potty Power just gave my son an incentive to go in the potty.  It made him think that going in the potty is cool and going in your pants is for babies....ok, my son still wanted to be a baby (we had a new one at the time) but the video kind of convinced him that he actually wanted to be a big kid.

I would also have to say, we really talked up the video to him before we even watched it.  It was an event in our house.  We planned it like it was a huge deal.  We sat down with him to watch it and acted all into it.  We commented throughout the whole thing about how good the kids were at going pee in the potty and about how he could do that now.  We told him that by watching the video he now had ""potty power.""  And before it was even over, he ran in to the bathroom to pee & said, ""I have potty power!""

The only negative:  it has a ""scary"" character in part of the video & my son would grab me every time he came on, but it was just more weird than anything (the Jester)",1187222400,,1506,3.7756410256410255

***UPDATE***
when i first borrowed this dvd, i took a preview and decided this wouldn't be something my twins would be interested in. later that week, i decided to give it a try. i was SHOCKED to see that my boys were mesmerized by the dvd. not only did they absolutely relate to the older kids, they started singing along to the catchy rhymes. what's great is that the dvd is *very* repetitive, so you don't have to be. the dvd drives home the message that you go on the potty, take your time, wipe your bottom, and wash your hands well. then you're a big kid that can wear underwear. a simple message, but one that busy parents rush through every day when kids learn best from repetition. anyhow, my kids are now addicted to this dvd, and sing along that they have to wipe thier bottom when they go potty. i don't understand how or why 2.5yo boys could relate to 5yos going to potty, but i suppose i don't have to.",1184716800,3,1588,4.244224422442244

Oh how I wish I had pre-screened before I let my son watch this.  I can not stand the whole ""baby"" vs ""big boy"" language that this thing bases itself on.  The very beginning starts with a game.  They show some activities and ask if a baby or a big kid can do them.  Need help eating = baby.  Build a tower out of blocks = big kid.  Use potty = big kid (and so on and so on).  So the viewer can infer that if they need help eating, they must be a baby.  If they aren't using the potty yet, they must be a baby.  After watching how great it is to be a big kid, anyone would feel shame for doing the ""baby"" things.

I just don't agree with shaming kids into doing what we want.

The skit at the end with the princess...oh....I don't think I have words to decribe how I felt watching that.

So I can't recommend it.  I like the idea behind empowering kids to use the potty, but there is entirely too much ""be a big kid"" language in it for me.

She wasn't interested in Prudence and the Potty, and she didn't sit through Potty Time with Bear. But this one she watched twice in one day, and I didn't mind sitting through it either. One song got on my nerves (the one about what do you do when you are sitting on the potty), but otherwise, it was a cute video with catchy tunes and a good message. I liked the fact that it had real kids and not cartoons or animals. It worked well for my daughter, too, because it had a princess in the video and we had a princess themed potty party and she loved it.",1175385600,,712,4.0928571428571425

The songs are cute and my son who just turned 3 watched it over and over and over, before we actually started full-on training. We let him ""master"" the DVD and then on his own he started putting what he learned on TV into action. We aren't using a toddler potty, and the video mostly focuses on them, but there is enough footage of the real grown up potty that he grasped the concept well. I highly recommend this tool to get kids excited and to learn some important stuff, like wiping well and washing hands afterwards.",1175385600,,639,4.289256198347108

On day five I caught him right before his accident and I encouraged him by singing a few of the tunes from the video-which are catchy.  Magic!  He has not failed to use the potty since and he follows through with all the steps on the video.  We also put up a chart to ensure continuance of his newly acquired skills.  I can't say the video is the only reason why he mastered it but I can safely say that when all else was in place, it definitely motivated him to try!",1174608000,3,732,4.23021582733813
2075469,3,B0002B55DO,"Not a bad DVD for kids to watch, but my son would only watch it twice and now he doesn't care to watch it.  BUT after the first time of watching it, that night he ran straight to me going ""mommy i need to poopy, I need to potty power"".  So in all honesty it does help.  He had the pee'ing down, it was the poo'ing we had trouble with.  There ae still problems, and it will take time, but atleast after watching the DVD, he is trying alittle harder.  For kids its a good DVD to get them interested.  It does focus more on pee'ing but not as much on poo'ing, which seems to be the harder part of potty training.  Most of my friends are in similar situations in training their boys.

I would suggest this DVD to help as a tool for potty training though.

As a parent, I suggest you walk out of the room, as it is pretty cheesy.

I was not impressed with the princess story at the end.  The jester in the story really freaked me out and I think he could have be ""toned"" down or even left out of the story.

I gave it 3 stars, because while it helps, there are things that could've been focused on more and somethings left out or toned down.  But it does hold a 3 yr olds attention and does help, which is really all that counts.",1174521600,,1224,3.9876543209876543
2075470,4,B0002B55DO,"Most kids in the video are 3-4-5 years old, maybe even 6 or 7 years old; one kid has missing teeth in the front.  So it is great for kids who are ""potty resistant"" and for desperate parents.  The tunes are catchy, it covers the basics of going potty in an entertaining way, but for training your kid to go potty, some essential details are missing.

The DVD shows kids wiping a teddy bear's bottom, but I can see how it might be difficult to demonstrate wiping one's own bottom.  As for the toilet paper, I don't think there's any need to ""teach"" kids how to pull the roll.  Most kids have the problem of stopping the toilet paper from rolling out, but this aspect is not shown.  In the hand washing segment, there is a 1/2-second clip of a kid grabbing a big bath towel to wipe her hands and while it shows the kids rinsing their hands, the rinse portion is not mentioned in the narrative or song.  So my daughter often thinks she's done after she sings, ""Twinkle Twinkle"" and her hands are full of soap.  I have to remind her to rinse and dry her hands.  In the middle of the DVD, the narrator (Jessica) does a bit of talking, ""after you've gone potty, all you have to do is... then all you have to is... and after that, all you have to do is...""  There are a lot of ""all you have to dos"" in her instructions, which makes the tasks not as simple as she is they are.  Then she gets to the part where you ""pull"" the handle.  I've never heard of someone pulling the toilet handle; I've always thought the action was more of a ""push"" than a pull.

The princess story in the end is very cheesey, can't imagine any little boy liking it much less a little girl.  That's when my daughter loses interest.

But overall, my 2-year-old daughter loves this DVD.  I played it for her right after her second birthday and now she is 26 months, can hold her pee much longer, stays dry during the day and occasionally, she is even dry at night.  We've watched this DVD so many times that my daughter has picked up on a minor error - a boy is kicking a basketball, yet the song says, ""you can kick a soccer ball...""  I hope a new edition comes out that fixes this detail and uses some younger kids.  In my humble opinion, ""potty training"" is not for kids who are already going to school - by then, if the kid is still in diapers, I'd call it ""peer pressure training.""",1174262400,2,2350,4.193763919821826

A day or two later he's already used the chair a few times a day and even at daycare, where he told the teacher he had ""potty power!"".  The video doesn't have much in the way of jokes, etc for parents, but then again this is not really about entertainment.

Somewhat like Blues Clues, you have a wide eyed host who's talking to the camera, which seems to hypnotize the kids and make them pay attention.

I really couldn't watch this one more than once.,1156291200,,352,4.208955223880597

She picked up on the songs quickly and she had a great day of dryness.  It is not the miracle cure but it reinforces the lessons I am teaching her about going potty.  I don't think my son would have liked the princess and the potty as much as my daughter does though. My personal opinion is that this is geared more toward a girl than a gender neutral video.  I hope this helps.,1156204800,5,503,4.144329896907217

The songs are cute and she often sings them to herself when she's not watching the dvd. I found ""Potty Power"" to be a very helpful tool in what is a very difficult process during my toddler's development.

Within minutes of the first viewing, she asked (without prompting) to sit on the potty and went.  She was successful again the same evening.  Our second day had no successes, but a couple hours into the third day and she's gone twice again.

I expect that we've still got a long road ahead (weeks, maybe a couple of months), but this video helped my daughter WANT to be potty trained.  It's well-crafted from a toddler's perspective, and very motivating.",1148515200,3,745,4.641221374045801

This DVD is amazing...we turned it on, and it wasn't even playing all the way through before he was in the bathroom sitting on the potty!!!  Seeing the other kids in the video (not a cartoon), actually reinforced the idea in his head, and he is now on his way to Potty Power!  He loves the songs, and I let him watch it as often as he wants.  I've heard him singing the songs and reciting the dialogue as he plays.

We were having trouble getting him to understand what he was supposed to do on the potty- he'd just sit there. This video really helped! The songs are catchy and simple, so he could understand and even sing them himself, and relate to what was happening. It also uses mostly older kids, which he liked, because he was interested in being a ""big kid.""

In all, this is a video to use if you have a child who is over 3 and still not using the potty. You may get the songs stuck in your head. When we first watched it, we were worried that it seemed more geared to girls than boys, but my sons both love it. The over-acting actually works well for the kids, too, and will make you giggle.

She brought her potty into the living room to sit on while she watched the movie. After about a week of watching the movie, we gave her Pull-ups (she was afraid to wear underwear at first) and she's been potty trained ever since with only a few accidents in the beginning. I would strongly recommend this movie for anyone having difficulty potty training an older child. It's ten dollars for the movie. If it doesn't work, it's only ten dollars and if it does, it's invaluable.

She is still saying...""I can do it just like Potty Power!!!""  She is so excited and so are we.  No more diapers OR Pull Ups OR accidents just 3 weeks after she decided to get serious about this.. Good luck..I highly recommend it. I must add that I think the ""power"" behind this little movie is that it uses some postive peer influences.  You see all these cute and happy little kids using the potty and being proud of themselves, throwing out diapers, etc.  Great idea..because the next best thing is having your toddler around another toddler who has started to potty train.",1144972800,3,976,4.537142857142857

I like that it's live action rather than cartoons, all the kids are older, the presenter is upbeat, more information is given (all the essentials, including handwashing and wiping front-to-back), lots of great songs and a very cute story at the end.  I think this one is finally going to work for us, better than Once Upon a Potty.  The context is ""I want to be a big kid now"".

I found it to be a great film with very concrete information that makes it easy to sit down and talk (as much as one can) with toddlers about potty training.  Not only does it discuss both small potties and the toilet, it includes wiping from front to back (which is an important hygiene lesson, especially for little girls), and handwashing (which is also obviously an important hygiene lesson).

The format of the video is targeted at young toddlers, which is a good thing in my opinion, but I was seeking a such an orientation in a DVD that also provided educational information.

She actually had a time period of about 2 weeks, when she was going potty maybe 6 times a day, on toilet. Then, she decided she didn't want to go anymore.  (We had been using both diapers & pull-ups.)  We always heard ""No! I don't want to sit on potty!""  Soooo frustrating when she already had gone tons of times on toilet. (Typical toddler power trip--doesn't want to go because the grown-ups DO want her to go.)  Well, this movie has really helped us start up again.  She says ""No more diapers for me,"" when the kids on movie say it. So, I got out the Gerber padded cotton training pants, & now she's wearing them. She's doing great--some accidents, though. But a whole lot better than no potty at all. She's not 100% dry yet, but I think she'll be there soon. I told her I put the diapers away for good--no more ever again.

My daughter is just over 2 years and we've run headlong into negativism in our attempts to potty train.  She knows EXACTLY what we want her to do when we sit her on the potty, and blatently refuses to do so (to the point of painfully holding in both ""number 1"" and ""number 2"").  In desperation, I ordered this video based on the positive reviews.

I have to say she has loved it FAR more than any books (which she has been mildly interested in), which makes sense since 2-year-olds are much more ""sucked in"" to the TV than a book.  In fact, I think creating a DVD on this subject was an ingenious idea!  She watched it once the day it came, and in the week following, she completely undressed herself 3 times on a whim (and to my complete surprise) and sat on her potty chair.  This was without me even mentioning it - just the sight of the chair triggered her enthusiasm.  She didn't go, but I figure getting her interested and willing to go alone is a BIG start!  When she watched it again, she insisted on it three times in a row before declaring it was time for Nemo.  :)

The kids in the video are about 3 years old, which I think is perfect because my daughter still considers them ""equals"" but they can talk and sit on the potty well.  The narrator is a pretty young woman with bright eyes that will easily attract any child.  Although they primarily talk about kids going potty on a potty chair, they do also show video of kids sitting on a toilet.  Some of the discussion might be a little advanced for my daughter, but all the video of real kids (no animation) using the potty chair has had powerful influence.

Here's a quick run-down of things in this 30 minute video:

-  The narrator defines the difference between being a baby and a ""big kid"" with a little game that shows what babies do (sleep in a crib, spoon-fed by Dad, wears diapers, etc) and what a big kid does (swings, stacks blocks, etc).

-  Sings a song about all the things a ""big kid"" can do by him/herself (sleep in a bed, eat ice cream, kick a ball, etc) and says that going potty by yourself is just one more thing big kids do.

-  The definition of ""pee"" and ""poop"" (terms they use) as being made by the body.  Babies go in their diaper and ""big kids"" and grownups go in the potty (the grown ups in a toilet).

-  Introduces the idea of the potty chair (versus the toilet) and explains that they come in different shapes and sizes.  Also introduces what toilet paper does - wiping yourself is just like when mom and dad wipe a baby with wet wipes.

-  Sings a song about what you can do while you're sitting on the potty for awhile - read, sing, play with a toy.  I really liked this part because it showed my daughter that she'll just spend some time sitting for awhile as part of her training.

-  Sings a song about wiping afterward - the children wipe a large teddy bear (front to back!) to illustrate since they obviously can't show the children actually doing it to themselves.

-  Sings a song about washing your hands, and says that you should scrub with soap and water for about 20 seconds, or as long as it takes to sing Twinkle Twinkle little star.  I LOVE this idea!

-  Mentions that learning to use the potty isn't an over-night thing, but that once you do, you've got POTTY POWER!!!

-  There is a princess story at the end that they could easily have left off as far as my daughter is concerned, but I would imagine a 3 or 4 year old girl (I'm thinking of my nieces) would LOVE the idea of becoming a princess with ""royal underwear"" after learing to potty.  I think the purpose of the princess story is to establish how great it is to get to wear underwear after you've got Potty Power.

The songs are simple and catchy, and I sing them to my daughter sometimes throughout the day (usually because they are - unfortunately - stuck in my head).  Obviously this video isn't going to replace parental training, but repetative viewing along with lots of book reading and a general ""toilet training"" mindset throughout the day is going to be a big help!",1136764800,283,4291,4.287313432835821
2075548,5,B0002B55DO,"I bought this video 18 months ago, when my daughter was 15 months old. Her Dr. thought that her withholding of ""waste"" (for lack of a better term) was because she was ready for potty training.  The Dr. recommended a potty-training video by Duke University, which I bought, and bought this video as well.  My daughter LOVED this video and the catchy songs right away, and it did encourage her to sit on the potty, which she did ALL DAY!  She just didn't have the physical/mental control to be able to consciously initiate urinating.  She was simply too young, and not ready!

I have not pushed her on the potty issue since she was 15 months old, figuring that she would initiate it if she was ready (because she's always ready for the next step before me!), and I was right! She's been asking occasionally to use the potty, and has been successful in urinating in it. Of course we make a very big deal out of it when she does go!  Other times, she just ""tortures"" us, running in and out of the bathroom, showing her bare hiney to our in-laws etc.  Well, last week she turned 33 months old and we had to stay home from work/school because she had an ear infection. Since I was going to have 6 days at home, I figured I might as well put that time to good use, and get to some potty training!  I really felt that she was ready for it, and since I suddenly had some unplanned time on my hands...  Well, I pulled out the Potty Power video on Wednesday morning, and she watched it over, and over, and over again! It's all she wants to watch!! In fact I've even had to feed her breakfast on the potty, because she refuses to get off! It's now been 7 days since we started the training, and she's only had 2 wet accidents in her Pull-Ups! She even had a BM in the potty last night! She loves to sing, ""I can do it myself, I'm a big kid now, I can do it myself, I got Potty Power!"" In addition to inspiring her to use the potty, it has really increased her self-confidence! She's even climbing into her car seat saying, ""I can do it myself, I'm a big kid now!"", which is great, considering that she was going through a phase saying, ""I'm a baby, I can't walk - pick me up!""

To the makers of Potty Power, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! You've produced a fantastic product that was instantly motivational to my daughter, and I will be forever grateful! I'll be buying additional copies for my daughter's school too!",1136246400,3,2407,4.258771929824562

Jessica, the hostess, sings and talks you through the motions of learning to be a ""big kid"" and use the potty.  Everything from throwing away the diapers, to wiping away the poop and thoroughly washing your hands is covered here in very simple to understand and easy to follow steps.  Only disappointing part is at the end when the dressed up characters of King, Queen and Jester try to convince the princess to begin using her potty.  It's slightly annoying for adults, but kids will think it's cute.

As my son watches Jessica and the children, you can see him mouthing some of the words and songs - although he hasn't come right out and started singing.

What a difference!  Even when she was feeling a little discouraged, you could still cheer her up by pumping your fist in the air and shouting ""POTTY POWER!!""

He definitely enjoyed watching the dvd, but it has not motivated him to start using the potty at all. If you have children who enjoy singing along to songs and like doing what other kids do, then they will probably benefit from ""Potty Power."" But for those with kids like my son who is more of the shy, independent type and does not like to sing-a-long, then this isn't the right pick.

This dvd, like many, many potty training materials is geared toward training with a potty chair and not the regular toilet. I'd like to find a dvd or book that is geared toward learning without using a potty chair first.",1128211200,4,701,4.351145038167939

Our daughter didn't magically become potty trained overnight after watching it!  But she wanted to try her potty right away.

After her holding it for 10-12 hours at a time and refusing to go, the doctor said it was a huge power trip she was on, and suggested we totally stop the potty training totally, and try again later.

Several months after my horrible defeat I decided to give it another try.  I had heard several good things about the Bear in the Big Blue house potty episode...while searching Amazon to order that one, I also saw Potty Power. After reading the reviews for Potty Power I decided what the heck--that will put me over the $25 to get free shipping haha.  I am SO glad I did!!!!!!!!!

The first night I put it on, after saying she wanted to watch it several times (who was I to complain??) she looked at me and said ""mama, no more diapers for me..."" UMMMM, OKAY??!!  I didn't know what to think.  Let's just put it this way.  She has been in big girl underwear ever since then (almost a month) and has had NOT ONE ACCIDENT!!!!!!!!! Let's just say I am totally shocked.  I can not attribute EVERYTHING to this DVD, she must have just been ready to make the transition....but who knows if it would have been as easy without this DVD.  She loved the concept of ""potty power"" and LOVED the songs.....yes, I even know all the songs by heart myself, and sing them often lol!

She still has some accidents and won't go away from the house right now, but she is trying and that is a HUGE improvement over just two weeks ago.  My youngest daughter wants to do it too, but she does not have the full control yet.  That will come soon.

2075582,5,B0002B55DO,My 3 year old had all the signs of potty readiness except for WILLINGNESS.  I tried everything including Dr. Phil's Potty Paul doll.  He watched this video twice and got on the potty and went pee.  We were amazed!!  It is done really cute.  I think what got him was a segment about the difference between being a baby and being a big kid.  Songs are adorable.  This should be sold in stores.  I have told all my friends!  I love this DVD!!  Now we haven't had any number 2's yet but this is the first thing that has even got us in the right direction.,1123372800,2,551,4.113207547169812
2075583,5,B0002B55DO,I bought this for my daughter who is 2-1/2.  I was having trouble potty training her and I'm telling you this video works.  Within 3 days of watching it she is now telling me when she has to go and keeping her Pull-Ups dry!  I never thought we would be at this stage so quickly.  I highly recommend this video to those parents who are having trouble getting your toddler to go.  POTTY POWER!!!!!,1123200000,,395,4.283783783783784
2075584,5,B0002B55DO,"when it comes to potty training, this video is the video to get!! I have been trying to train my 4 year old twin boys for almost two years. I tried ""Its Potty Time""& ""once upon a potty"" niether of them made any impact and I was at my wits end. This video is the answer to my prayers,in the week since we got this video the twins are 90% trained! They love to watch it and interact with the video. Best of all, they do not want the diapers and it has them leaning toward the toilet and not their potty chair. Hooray for POTTY POWER!!!!",1122854400,,534,4.0
2075585,5,B0002B55DO,"I have tried books, videos (including the episode of Blue's Clues and the episode of Bear In The Big Blue House), talking, and every other non-forceful way I could think of with my almost 3 year old. She ranged from partial disinterest to outright hatred of the potty, depending on the day and her mood. My older children were not this difficult to potty train, so I was becoming increasingly more unsure as to what to try next.

After buying this video and having it shipped, she watched it twice in a row and I could barely get her OFF the potty the rest of the day. She told me, ""No more diapers."" and was even singing one of the songs right before she went to sleep. Within less than a week, she was completely potty trained. I'm impressed!",1121731200,2,744,4.35251798561151

We introduced the potty at 2.5 and she was open to sitting on it and playing with it, etc.  However, it came down to using it and she refused.  We had tried everything.  I am a child development specialist with a Head Start program and should know how to do this, right?....wrong!!  We did stickers, pretty underpants, taking her every half hour, books, you name it and we did it.  I purchased this dvd as a last resort.  It has worked wonders.  She too has went around the house saying ""potty power"" and ""I'm a big kid.""  It gave her the words to use and the power to do these things by herself.  She wanted to be a big kid and this video reinforced her need for independence.  I would recommend this dvd to anyone and everyone struggling with training.",1121212800,2,842,4.265822784810126

2075589,5,B0002B55DO,"This video has worked like magic for us, unlike others we had tried!  We are on day two of training and our still having some accidents but many successes, and for the first time our daughter is excited about the process!

Our daughter will be three next month and we've been trying to potty train since her second birthday.  At the time, we bought the Once Upon a Potty video, a couple of books and a Fisher Price potty chair, and tried to do what all the experts said -- let her get used to the potty gradually, on her own timetable.  She asked for the video (which she called ""babies"") often.  After several months of watching the video she knew the terminology (wee wee, poo poo, etc.) but had no interest in sitting on the potty chair.  When we gently encouraged her to sit on it (in clothes or a diaper) she screamed and was terrified.  As months went on, I decided maybe the potty in that video looked so weird that she didn't associate her potty chair with it, so we bought the official one; it wasn't successful either -- the only thing she learned from the video was to put the potty on her head and say ""it's not a hat!"" while giggling madly.  At a friend's urging, I then bought a little seat to go on top of the adult potty in case she just didn't like potty chairs -- again, no interest.

After we passed two-and-a-half with no progress, we followed the advice of our regular sitter (an older woman who has potty-trained dozens of children as a nanny) who said we should insist our daughter at least sit on the potty.  We chose the seat that fit on the adult toilet and after some initial resistance, got our daughter to sit on it.  We switched to pull-ups during the day and even tried cotton training pants.  We would read to her or sing songs to occupy the time while she was on the potty and she seemed to enjoy that, but only peed in the potty a couple of times and that seemed to be sheer coincidence, because she still didn't seem to understand what was going on.  Lots of accidents with the training pants -- no successes.  Still no interest in her potty chairs.  About two months ago, we decided to just take a break -- but not for too long, because she starts pre-school in August and they require the kids to be potty-trained!

Day before yesterday, we introduced the Potty Power video.  She loved it and asked to watch it over and over again, and for once, we allowed that!  That night, we told her the next day she would begin being a big girl with potty power.  (We used the language of the video, talking about ""no more diapers"" and reminding her of all the things she can already do for herself.)  Yesterday, we brought out our original Fisher Price potty chair and went cold turkey on diapers (except for nighttime).  We made a really big deal of it in the morning (ala Dr. Phil's ""potty party"" idea).  She knew exactly what to do from the potty power video and seemed to ""get it"" right away.  She was excited and enthusiastic and by last night, was protesting putting on the nighttime diaper!  Yes, she's two months more mature than she was when we took our break, but I really credit Potty Power with providing her with the right role models -- not babies, but slightly older pre-schoolers.

As other reviewers have said, this is a Blue's Clues-style set with an enthusiastic host and lots of kids demonstrating the various steps.  It is filled with catchy songs -- no more annoying than the typical kids' video, but that doesn't mean parents won't get tired of it -- but hey, I can live with some annoying songs for a while if it works!  The video would be a perfect teaching tool if it showed some actual pee and poop in the bowl of a potty chair (gross, but important info for trainees!) and if it included the ""pull your pants down"" and ""pull your pants up"" steps before and after sitting on the potty (it doesn't explicitly mention those things.)

Day two and we have only had three accidents (and two happened while some workmen were here delivering a new refrigerator and were really more our fault than hers.)  Still a long way to go, but with each success she seems more confident and we are feeling better and better about starting her in pre-school!

I highly recommend this video, especially for the slightly older (2.5+) child who hasn't responded to other methods!",1120867200,6,4311,4.413400758533502
2075590,4,B0002B55DO,"You guys should buy this DVD!  My 2 1/2 yr. old daughter loves the songs. She goes to the bathroom and says ""I Got Potty Power!"". So, obviously, she's getting something from it. It won't magically make your child potty trained though but it's a GREAT addition for reinforcing potty training. Just be consistent with telling your child to use the bathroom and say...""You've got potty power!""",1119830400,,390,4.82089552238806
2075591,1,B0002B55DO,"The language tht they use in this DVD I feel is offensive and demeaning to children.  ""Only babies to do this, only babies do that!""  You don't need to be negative to potty train a child.  Also, there are no doctors or psychologists that recommend it. I would not get it for anyone.",1119830400,7,282,4.283018867924528
2075592,5,B0002B55DO,"I had to give this dvd 5 stars because IT WORKS.

As an adult, the nasal voice of ""Jessie"", the host of Potty Power, grates on my nerves like nails on a chalkboard.  My children, on the other hand, could watch this one 10 times in a row and still ask for more.  For three days we watched it at least 5 times/day, with not much of a result.  THEN yesterday, my son pooped on his potty two times!  Once in the morning and once in the evening.  I couldn't believe it!  He had never even tried to go before, and something about the video made him very determined.

Be warned, you cannot sit and watch this show without tuning it out, or you will go crazy.  However, if your kid is showing signs that he/she is ready to use the potty, then I think this dvd could give the extra push needed to help your toddler make sense of it all.",1118361600,3,827,4.055555555555555
2075593,2,B0002B55DO,"MY DAUGHTER IS 30 MONTHS, THE ONLY THING SHE LEARNED WAS TO FINALLY SIT ON THE POTTY INSTEAD OF BEING AFRAID OF IT BUT SHE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO IN IT.  THE DVD DOES NOT SHOW ANY FAKE PEE OR POOP SO THAT SHE CAN IDENTIFY WITH HER OWN PERSONAL PEE OR POO.

SHE SEEMS PUTZZLED ON WHY IN THE VDEO EVERYONE SITS ON A POTTY OR TOILET BUT SHE'S CLUELESS ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN IT. SHE TELLS ME PEE OR POOP BUT COMES WITH THE POTTY AFTER SHE'S DONE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE, OVIOUSLY ON THE CARPET, WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF THEM EVER DOING IT ON THE TILES?

I DID TRY TO SHOW HER MYSELF WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU SIT ON A TOILET BUT MY OPINIOON IS THAT IF SHE WOULD SEE A CHILD DO IT SHE COULD IDENTIFY MORE TOWARD ALL THIS PROCESS, OF COURSE I DON'T EXPECT A DVD TO SHOW A CHILDS PRIVATE PARTS (CONSIDERING ALL THE SICK-PYSCHOS OUT THERE)BUT PERHAPS THEY COULD SHOW A DOOL DO IT (I HAVE THE ONE ALREADY THAT PEES) OR SOMETHING INSIDE THE POTTY AFTER A CHILD GETS OFF OF THE POTTY.  IN ANY CASE I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED NOT JUST ABOUT THIS ONE, THE OTHER ONES I'VE SEEN ARE TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.

This movie needs to make more emphasis on going poopy and how it won't feel any different than going in a diaper, it's just cleaner.  I think that's the point missed by most books and movies, though.  They show you how to do it, but kids seem to associate going poopy in the toilet as something ""different"" and therefore don't want to do it.

Needless to say, he has watched it at least 2 dozen times since we got it 4 days ago!

It seems to be geared more toward a slighly older potty challenged kid, and it hasn't solved all our potty woes, but has definately helped with the positive attitude he was lacking.
