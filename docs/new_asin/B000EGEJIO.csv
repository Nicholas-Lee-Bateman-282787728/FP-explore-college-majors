2517604,4,B000EGEJIO,"Yea good job winning over a decade ago, but you guys gotta stop living in the past. The Rag team is good this year and to bring out a 15 dvd set (15 freaking dvd's are you kidding me?!?!) seems to take away from their good season this year.

What's next? A 45 DVD set due out next year celebrating the Rags return to the playoffs this year???",1143763200,4,342,4.029411764705882
2517605,5,B000EGEJIO,"Mark Messier swore he would give everything he had to bring the Stanley Cup back to New York.  In 1994, Messier captained the historic Stanley Cup winning New York Rangers team after guaranteeing the team's Game 7 victory of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New Jersey Devils, and facing off against the Vancouver Canucks in the Cup Finals that went all seven games. The team led by Messier and coached by Mike Keenan, included future hall of famers and role players including Brian Leetch, Adam Graves, Mike Richter, Alexi Kovalev, Sergei Zubov, Kevin Lowe, Alexander Karpovtsev, and Jeff Beukeboom; all of whom played extremely important roles in the team's victory.  This DVD collection features all the games from the Eastern Conference Finals and the Cup Finals; and every magic moment in between: Stephane Matteau's game winning goal against the Devils, Richter stoning Canucks sniper Pavel Bure in a penalty shot, and Messier hoisting up the Cup with a fan holding a sign saying ""Now I Can Die in Peace"".  It's indeed one of the greatest moments in NHL history, and for Rangers fans, well, you already know that this is a must own.",1143676800,18,1147,4.902061855670103
2517606,5,B000EGEJIO,This will be great to own all these amazing games.  Hey Devil fans Martin Brodeur is not so good when the players in front of him can't hold and tackle guys trying to score.  I believe Martin is not even in the top 15 for goalies while King Henrick is at the top of the league in almost every category.  One more thought they have never beaten the Rangers in the playoffs and they never will.,1143676800,4,392,4.131578947368421
2517607,5,B000EGEJIO,"It's pretty funny that these Devils fans are writing reviews. Why are they even here in the first place? Oh, maybe they want to learn why the ""World's Most Overrated Arena"", as one reviewer called it, attracts thousands of people with sell-out crowds and fans that are crazy and will kick your ---.  Yeah that's right, the Devils don't even have enough of their own fans to fill up the Meadowlands. That's why you see more Blue shirts and hear ""Let's go Rangers"" at every Devils game in NJ.

Let's not forget that the Devils need to retire more than one number in a year to just try and match the level of excitement that comes from retiring a number at MSG....and still, it doesn't even come close.

By the way, last time I checked Rangers were still up a cup on the Devils. A cup is still a cup no matter when it was won. Better luck at Newark, fans...

PS - Let's go rangers! MVP for Jagr! HENRIK is awesome!",1143676800,6,911,4.27906976744186
2517608,5,B000EGEJIO,"I was just 18 when my New York Rangers finally overcame the odds and won the coveted Stanley Cup.  I've seen some reviews from obvious (in the immortal Steve Somers' words) Ice-lander and Devils fans refering to ""buying"" a Cup (which is mostly untrue, as we traded young talent for more proven talent, which would bite us later as the traded players became stars elsewhere), but what they fail to realize was the amazing hockey that took place...the semi-finals against the Devils will go down as one of the greatest hockey series of all time!  As a Rangers fan, I can personally attest to many heart-stopping moments where it appeared the Rangers were destined to miss out yet again, but thanks to Messier, Leetch, Richter, Graves, Tikkanen and, of course, MATTEAU! MATTEAU! MATTEAU!, the Rangers overcame the past and claimed one of the most dramatic Cup victories of all-time.

It shouldn't matter what team you root for, the story of the 1994 Playoffs was GREAT HOCKEY!  If you are a true hockey fan, you should enjoy these discs as much as I will.  And if you're a Rangers fan, it'll be worth it just to see Ron Hextall getting yanked in Game One of the opening round and not taking off his mask on the bench in embarrassment as the Rangers blew out (and later swept) the Ice-landers.

By the way, the Devils are doing great now that you can't grab and pull down every player that comes near you, aren't they?",1142812800,6,1414,4.591269841269841
2517609,5,B000EGEJIO,"I'm looking forward to this set big-time, but I'm wondering which feeds did Warner Bros use for this set?  I tried contacting them about it but didn't get a reply.  I hope it's the MSG feeds with, IMO, the best NHL broadcast team in the league, ""Sam & J.D."".  I'm from Dallas but have been a Rangers fan since the 80's when I started watching them on the satt dish.  ""Let's go, Rangers"" :)",1142812800,7,389,4.216216216216216
2517610,5,B000EGEJIO,"A fifteen DVD set of two of the greatest rounds of hockey played in recent memory. Both series had more drama than you can break a new composite stick at. Sure people remember the drama of the Bure penalty shot in game four, the drama of a close 7th game to win the Cup. What most people will never forget is the seven game series against New Jersey, complete with guaranteed victory in game six when it seemed like the Rangers were down for the count.

So next time a Devils fan talks about the supposed superiority against the Rangers, remind them of the past playoff victories and put game six and/or game seven from this DVD set as a reminder of true superiority.",1140652800,13,667,4.379032258064516
2517611,4,B000EGEJIO,"The product description lists this as having the 7 games of the Western Conference finals.  Well, New York and New Jersey are hardly west!  It should read EASTERN Conference Finals.",1335139200,,181,5.0
2517612,5,B000EGEJIO,"I bought this for my 10 year old nephew who is obsessed with hockey and the Rangers.  He loves it, as does my brother who is 43 and has the same love for both.  Also, this was very reasonably priced.  If you buy it elsewhere it can be  priced for over $75.00.",1265587200,,259,3.923076923076923
2517613,4,B000EGEJIO,My father loved this for his 60th birthday.  I could only give it four stars because I'm a Devils fan.  The old man loves his Rangers and thoroughly enjoys this DVD set everytime he sits down for a hockey fix.,1245715200,,209,4.2
2517614,5,B000EGEJIO,"I don't think I've seen a series any better than the Devils-Rangers series in 1994 - worth the now reduced price of the DVD's alone. The coverage is a bit raw, just starts from the beginning of the game through the end, with commercial time cut out. You won't miss anything that impacted the outcome of the games, although I heard that a scrap in the Devils series is edited out (go figure). Things I would have done differently: 1) Since it's going to be primarily Ranger fans buying this, why not just stick with MSG coverage with Sam & JD all the way through?  2) Sound quality was dubious for a few minutes here and there - you would think they could have remastered the audio. 3) Would have been nice to have a little bit of the pre-game coverage.",1233619200,,752,4.333333333333333
2517615,5,B000EGEJIO,My husband loved receiving this video.  He will have hours of fun reliving this very important Rangers series year!,1232236800,,115,5.052631578947368
2517616,5,B000EGEJIO,"This is an obvious 'must have' for Ranger fans. It never gets old reliving 1994. This DVD set is excellent. I enjoyed the ESPN broadcasts of the Game 7's because the only broadcasts I've ever seen were the MSG Network's. There is some minor editing of the games too, but not enough that it bothers me. The video quality is pretty good for an SD broadcast. Too bad HD wasn't available at the time.",1232150400,,396,4.364864864864865
2517617,5,B000EGEJIO,"First of all, just because this info is missing in the listing, here are the details on the broadcast crews:

NJ-NYR series
Game 1--ESPN 2 w/ Sean McDonough and Brian Engblom.
Game 5--CBC w/ Chris Cuthbert and John Garrett
The rest are ESPN with the annoying Gary ""he did it! he did it!"" Thorne and Bill Clement.

Van-NYR series
The Final is thankfully all MSG Network feed with Sam ""it's a powerplay goal"" Rosen and John Davidson. Being a Canuck fan this was heaven not having to listen to the dreadful Bob ""where are the Make Belief players?"" Cole and Harry ""is the bar open?"" Neale.

All games axe the commercials and intermissions. the pic quality varies from amazing to the odd times, esp. the ESPN ones, where it's a tad off.

The jackets to each DVD have the scores and stats on them so if you do want to watch this fresh and don't remember the scores of each game, be forewarned. You will learn the score if you glance at the jackets.

Other than that, you know the hockey is great although much of the NJ-NYR series is, to be honest, frankly dull when NJ do the trap especially the overtimes where not much happens. Plus as you watch games 1 thru 5 and even two periods into game 6, you wonder how the NYR ever won this series. The Final is far more entertaining hockey by a country mile.

The bonus DVD on the Cup run has plenty of clips of both the NYR and Van runs to the Final as well as a ton of great I've never seen before behind-the-scenes footage and interviews. They also toss on the Messier Retirement Night (sponsored by Kleenex, as Mike Richter says).",1221350400,4,1573,4.351535836177474
2517618,3,B000EGEJIO,"This week, while being home from work, I was able to view the entire 7 game series against the Devils.  I haven't seen the final series yet. I enjoyed the entire series although I was a bit disappointed in a number of things regarding this DVD set.  Unfortunately for Rangers fans, they use ESPN broadcasts for all but 1 game.  The other game they use a Canadian Cable channel broadcast.  I'm pretty sure these games were broadcast on the Rangers regular MSG network and that is what should be on these disks.  Sam Rosen and John Davidson far surpass the announcer combinations on these disks.  I also would have loved to hear the different calls of the Matteau goal at the end of Game 6, especially the famous Howie Rose radio call (Matteau!! Matteau!! Matteau!). There were definite technical difficulties with blurry footage for during some of the games which was very annoying.  Plus, I wish they could have included some interviews of former players with their remembrances of each game as well as some pregame and postgame thoughts and interviews. Those would have been a fantastic addition to this series.  Those things hold down the number of stars I give to this collection. Otherwise, it was a terrific way to relive the Rangers - Devils series.",1206057600,6,1255,4.751152073732719
2517619,5,B000EGEJIO,"This is the greatest DVD set on the greatest team in sports (yes, I own season tickets). You are not a true Ranger fan until you add this to your collection. Only improvement would be to add the original MSG broadcasts for the network games. However, I got those from MSG during the strike and burned them to DVD. The quality is much better here, however.",1186617600,,355,4.393939393939394
2517620,5,B000EGEJIO,"As a massive Rangers fan, I was so happy to receive this as a birthday gift. With 15 DVD's crammed full of the conference and Stanley cup series, it is something that I have not been able to switch off. People have made comments about the broadcast quality, but you must remember that this is from a time when the technology was not as good as it is now and that over the 30 hours, the occasional glitch pales into insignificance.

I've collected other hockey DVD's from other teams as well - notably the Red Wings original six series - and it's great we get packages like this. More please!",1177804800,2,591,4.372727272727273
2517624,5,B000EGEJIO,"As a Rangers fan, how can you not like this? My only complaint is that the MSG broadcast was used for Game 7 of the Finals as opposed to the ESPN broadcast with Gary Thorne.",1171756800,2,173,3.9714285714285715
2517625,5,B000EGEJIO,This was a gift for my son in law for Christmas and he loved getting it.  Just what he wanted.,1168819200,,94,3.7
2517626,5,B000EGEJIO,"Looking at all of the reviews for this set its clear to see that New Jersey Devil Fans and New York Ranger fans obviously don't like each other very much and that is fine as rivalry's are what give sports the drama that makes an ordinary game not so ordinary.

With that being said, any New Jersey Devil fan coming on here making fun of this set is an absolute moron. Making comments like sure watch this as you have nothing else to watch just reaks of jealously. Maybe when or if you have a 15 DVD set commemorating one of your seasons you won't feel so obligated to bash other teams. I am not even a big Ranger fan as I live in Detroit and you can only guess which team I root for. However I remember this series as I watched every game and I not only remember what an amazing run it was for New York I can also see the historical significance of the 1994 series. Does it deserve to have a 15 DVD set to commemorate it, Absolutly. Do other seasons besides 1994? Absolutly and hopefully this is just the beginning of these sets as I can pick 4 or 5 years of the top of my head that would deserve sets like these. 90-91 Penguins, 91-92 Penguins, 92-93 Candians, 86-87 Oilers, 00-01 Avalanch and lets not forget the one that needs it the most 96-97 Red Wings - First Cup Win in 42 Years :-)

So let rivalry's be rivalry's but to bash this DVD set only shows your ignorance to NHL history and to the sport itself. 94 was an amazing season of hockey period regardless of which team you root for and the Rangers run to the cup was definitly one for the books and deserves a set like this. So congrats to all of you Ranger fans, this is by far one of the best commemorative sets that you can buy for any sport. I plan on purchasing this for myself if I can find a good deal on it, 85 bucks is a little pricey for me at the moment but for 15 DVD's is definitly a good price.

So to sum this up, great set, great team and great idea for future sets. Hopefully w see more soon!!

2517627,2,B000EGEJIO,"First of all, I'm a Rangers fun. I was looking forward to Messier's 2 disc ""collectors"" version promoted since last year, which was released this year as a 1 disc rehash. What a disappointment.

Then this Rangers 1994 15 disc set.

As other reviewers mentioned, this is edited game coverage of Conference finals against NJ, and Stanley Cup finals against VAN.

I take one star away because of this cuts.

Once I started to watch the set, I noticed the video quality of several segments are poor in Game 5 and 7 against NJ.

I take another star away.

Then the Game 2 against VAN, what terrible footages in 3rd period! Momentary black outs. Worst one lasting about one second.

I can't believe they release this kind of poor footages for hefty price.

As a die hard Ranger fan, I want NHL production or WB to replace those defective footages and send to us without charge.",1149465600,17,871,4.538461538461538
2517628,5,B000EGEJIO,"Quite possibly the best $[..] I've ever spent. I came across this by accident but immediately knew I had to have it. I just got it today and am watching game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals with the 2OT winner by Matteau. I remember sitting at home watching this game when I was in 4th grade. Its great watching and hearing Gary Thorne & Bill Clement saying some old-time names like Esa Tikkanen, Mike Gartner, Craig MacTavish, and Jeff Beukeboom. Absolutely love the DVD. Any true Rangers fan must have this!!!! I only wish I could have the Championship hat again...I wore it so much it turned brown because it never left my head.",1145491200,5,634,4.521739130434782
2517629,4,B000EGEJIO,"Clearly 5 stars for the overall quality and packaging of this set (even includes Mark Messier Night as a bonus.) However, I take away a star for the games not being completely uncut (e.g., the end of Game 6 vs. Devils - the skirmish between Anderson & Nichols is edited out.) A relatively minor point perhaps since no game time is lost, but this is still annoying and totally unnecessary. Regardless, a nice and overdue DVD addition to any hockey fan's library--especially Rangers fans! Also, die-hard Ranger fans beware: some games are taken from the ESPN feeds, so no Sam & J.D. Although it is interesting to see and hear these games via a different lens and commentary, I was a bit disappointed in this production choice for some of these games.",1145404800,16,748,4.674242424242424
2517630,5,B000EGEJIO,"Maybe K.Schaffer you should stick to reviewing more Full House box sets. Instead of worrying about the '94 Rangers you should worry about selling out your arena. NJ Devils, the easiest ticket in town. This box set gives us Ranger fans (the best fans there are in ANY sport) a chance to relive a wonderful time in New York sports history.

2517631,4,B000EGEJIO,This is the second installment of the NHL's Original 6 DVD Series. This Rangers set follows the sucessful albeit smaller set for the Detroit Red Wings. I am a Maple Leafs and truth be told have no love for either team. But this set is definitely a must have for serious hockey fans. It includes the classic Eastern Conference clash in its entirety (7 games) vs the New Jersey Devils. The watch arguably  the greatest Cup Finals in the post-expansion era. Watch as the Canucks battle back from 3-1 Series deficit to force a decisive Gm 7 at Madison Square Garden... I won't ruin the ending though. Anyways i hope the NHL continues with the Original 6 Series i will buy each set for sure. Wonder if they'll include Huet leading the Habs all the way this year?,1144368000,,757,4.4855072463768115
2517632,5,B000EGEJIO,"Why the Rangers they have won two cups since 1940 but this box set is a great idea especially if your a Montreal Canadiens fan now this team has a history to tell about, with 24 cups but the problem is the box set will contain about 300 Disc !!!! to tell all the past glorious richest stories that this fabulous team has to offer. I will need a mortgage on my house to buy this box set. But if they make this set for the lowly Toronto Maple Leafs team this box set will only be in Black and White since it has been so long that they won the cup.... I hope I did not offend anybody, It is all in fun about teasing between hockey fans that what make this sport so much fun to watch and do some ribbing after.

Next, we do not live in the past but you live with envy!!

Three Cups since 95 and you still cant get over being the ""red headed step child""!!!!!!!!

This disc set is a Great idea and I hope they put out others for the Oilers as well so we can all watch REAL hockey!

I cant wait for the post office to deliver it to me and I will go directly to game 6 of the Conference Finals game when Mess scored the hat trick, with two against Queen Marty!!

And please don't forget that the Ranger's were losing that game 2-0!!

We used to have several 1994 Stanley Cup VHS tapes and I wanted to upgrade to DVDs now that we only had DVD players in the house. This box set is absolutely awesome.

8109219,2,B000EGEJIO,"I'd actually give this 2 and a half stars if that were an option.

Pros:

1. Has all the games from the Conference and Stanley Cup Finals from one of the most exciting playoff runs in the past 25 years.
2. They are all on DVD (which, if you're like me, is a blessing since I can no longer view the VHS recordings I made of all 14 games way back when)
3. They are clearly and logically organized with packaging showing which games ion which side of the disc, along with a truncated box score.

Cons:
1. They have all the games... and by games, I mean JUST the games. No intro, no credits, no intermission report, nothing. Even stuff after the whistle in some cases has been edited out.
2. The editing, production and recording all looks like a High School AV Club could've done this as a project.
3. The masters obviously being tape quality (i.e. not digital) makes a grainy picture on today's modern LCD televisons.
4. All of these aforementioned lackluster bullet points are made all the more groan-worthy when you consider the price tag.

Seriously, the NHL should be ashamed to have slapped its logo and licensing on something a bootlegger could have done better.",1339545600,,1166,4.511848341232228
