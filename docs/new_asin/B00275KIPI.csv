3861541,5,B00275KIPI,"We saw this film at the Cinequest Film Festival.  We loved it!!  It is a story of four, basically disfunctional, individuals.  The four characters learn to love each other and themselves as they learn each of their secrets.  It is a show that makes you laugh and cry and keeps you thinking about the characters long after the show is over.",1249862400,2,339,4.508196721311475

8354104,3,B00275KIPI,Semi sympathetic characters but not given quite enough to do. Questions about why things were happening were not fleshed out until the last few minutes then not that compelling. An okay flick for a rainy afternoon.,1370736000,,214,4.972222222222222
8354105,4,B00275KIPI,"Nice film, easy to watch, lighthearted.  Not the greatest film you'll ever see, but you won't feel like you wasted 90 minutes of your life either.  The Sam Means soundtrack might be the highlight, though.  You'll want to download the album after you see the film!",1325894400,,263,4.673913043478261

8354107,4,B00275KIPI,This movie was fun.  It was interesting how is spanned across 3 people from a young boy to a young man to an middle age man all being somewhat in love with the same woman.  Also it was interesting what they discovered from each other and about each other.,1253404800,,255,4.183673469387755
8354108,5,B00275KIPI,This movie is fun for the whole family. I saw it last year at the Cinequest Film Festival and have been waiting for it to come out ever since! I'm always looking for new movies that I can watch with my kids because I get sick of all the regular cartoons that they want to watch all the time. So long Open Season.

8354110,5,B00275KIPI,"In the vain of Wes Anderson, but with a voice all its own, The Sinking of Santa Isabel is a gem of an indie comedy. First time writers and directors Michael and Jacob Hamblin deliver a heartfelt ""dramedy"" with all you could want from a film. In this character driven piece you couldn't ask for anymore from the cast as they take you on an emotion filled journey. The four main characters, despite vast differences in sex, age, careers, etc., are all similar in the sense that they are looking for something more in life. Through each other and the ups and downs of their lives and relationships they are able to find it.",1250208000,,620,4.447368421052632
