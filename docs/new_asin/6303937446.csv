Owen Hart v. Savio Vega
Decent opener with Owen doing his best to make Vega look good. Owen wins! **

Four Corners Elimination Match for the WWF Tag Team Championship:
The Smoking Gunns (Champions) v. The New Rockers v. The Godwinns v. The Bodydonnas
Not much to say here. Really boring. Gunns retain. 3/4*

British Bulldog v. Sid
The Sid push begins..um...that means Sid wins. *

Goldust v. Marc Mero
This was the match i thought would steal the show but it was subpar. Thought it was going to be alot better than it was. Goldie wins *3/4 However Mero gets the last laugh as he wins the Intercontinental title a month later.

Jerry Lawler v. Jake Roberts
Drinkng jokes turn into a DUD of a match & a Lawler win

Boiler Room Brawl:
The Undertaker v. Mankind
This match was missing something but still some great bumps & weapons used. Mankind wins cuz Paul Bearer turns on Undie!! ***

WWF Championship:
Shawn Michaels (Champion) v. Vader
Good match with TWO dusty finishes. Shawn worked his off ass to have a good match but its probably his worst title match in his first run as champ. Shawn retains. ***1/4

Overall just a horrible show but the effort was there.",1331424000,,1223,4.577981651376147
7856889,4,6303937446,"Once again, thanks to WWE Classics On Demand, I relived another classic event; this time being the 1996 edition of SummerSlam. Now during this time, Shawn Michaels was the WWF Champion & taking on all comers who were willing to take his gold. However, a month before at International Incident, HBK was beat in a six man tag (which for those keeping track, was the first time, Shawn had been pinned since before WrestleMania) & the man that did it was the man they call, Vader leading to this match. Also, the bitter feud between The Undertaker & Mankind continued here in the first ever Boiler Room Brawl. But the one thing that this event did succeed was that this event heavily made up & surpassed the awful SummerSlam from the previous year with a better card.

Owen Hart vs Savio Vega. This was during the period where Owen was wearing a cast for his injured hand, which did become a factor in this match at one point in time. Before that however, these two underrated performers went in & had a good back & forth encounter that did a great job in getting the crowd pumped up for the night with an ending that was not only typical Owen but a page out of Bob Orton's playbook.

Elimination Match: WWF Tag Team Champions The Smoking Gunns vs The Godwinns vs The Bodydonnas vs The New Rockers. A couple of interesting notes to mention here was that Sunny was originally a part of the Bodydonnas but here she was managing the Gunns, this was the SummerSlam debut of Leif Cassidy (who would later be known as Al Snow), Zip & the Godwinns while this was the first time that the tag team titles were on the line in this kind of match. Anyways, this was another good match to watch but if you look closely, you could tell that the Gunns were running into a break up due to the attitude that Billy Gunn kept showing when it came to Sunny.

Sycho Sid vs British Bulldog. This was the beginning of the best run of Sid's career as this was actually a much better match than you would normally expect from Sid as he & Bulldog had a nice powerhouse match with moments of both men using their power moves like the powerbomb & running powerslam. The bigger story here though was the appearance of Mason that would become a factor in not only the match but in the upcoming weeks.

It was around here that there was an interview with Faarooq Assad (who would later be known as just Faarooq) who was scheduled to face Ahmed Johnson for the Intercontinental Championship (which by the way, didn't happen due to Ahmed's first series of injuries)

Goldust vs Marc Mero. This was one of those matches that was focused more on another storyline that actually involved Mankind but also Sable which kinda took the attention away from this match. Not saying that this was a bad match at all but it just seemed to come off as a filler but a decent one nonetheless as both men worked well together.

Jerry Lawler vs Jake Roberts. The angle for this feud was based off Jake's real life substance abuse problems which was actually kinda sad to see. On top of that, Lawler brought an oversized bottle with him & just like the opener, it became a factor in this match. However unlike the opener, this match wasn't very good at all.

Boiler Room Brawl: The Undertaker vs Mankind. This was the most unique match that the WWF had did at the time as these two would start in the Boiler Room & you have to exit the Boiler Room & make your way to the ring where Paul Bearer was at to take position of the urn to win the match. This was really something to see for it's time as they brawled all over the Boiler Room with weapons like a steel pipe, a ladder & various other things coming into play before both men left the room to battle in the backstage area & eventually making it to the ring which lead to one of the most shocking turns in WWF history. Again for it's time, this was a wild & entertaining affair with quite the ending in the classic Taker/Mankind feud.

WWF Champion Shawn Michaels vs Vader. This was hyped up as HBK's biggest challenge yet as he was facing a much larger opponent who was not only very agile for his size but holds a pinfall victory over him. Shawn was always able to have a great series of matches with bigger men & this was no exception. This was probably Vader's best WWF match as they told a great story here with Vader being the dominate monster & overpowering Shawn on many occassions while Shawn had to use his speed & quickness to even get some surprising offense on Vader. There were many restarts in this match with HBK getting counted out at one point & later disqualified before the match continued after all that in which Shawn was able to survive & retain his title. Just a great main event & again perhaps Vader's best WWF match.

Overall, this was a much better edition than the 1995 edition as the WWF got it right here & for the most part delivered great action along with shocking twists to storylines that they were pushing at the time. This is one event that I would recommend.",1262044800,,4997,4.376077586206897
7856890,2,6303937446,"Savio Vega VS Owen Hart: Both men could wrestle. Sadly, it has one of the dumbest endings in WWF/WWE history. Hart hits Vega with his cast in front of the ref and Vince plays it off as the ref not being able to see the cast when it happened right in front of him. It was stupid and ruined a decent match.

Smoking Gunns VS Bodydonna's VS Godwinns VS New Rockers: Ah, gimmicks so bad you can smell crap coming from your tv set. Listen, all four men could wrestle but were given crappy names. This was a good match and was helped by the lovely Sunny being at ringside. I hate to say see was sleeping with half the locker room but who knows. Smoking Gunns wins in anther stupid finish. Sunny then cuts a heel promo.

Britsh Bulldog VS Sid: Wow, Bulldog being treated as a jobber? I don't know what he did but he deserved better. Sid wins in a quick squash.

Marc Mero VS Goldust: A decent match up between two men who could wrestle. I hate to say this but it was hard to ignore, Goldust had a big buldge in his pants. Hey Dust, cover it up! The match itself was decent but they would have better matches.

Sunny comes out with Faarooq Asad, a new comer. Who says she got around? Anyways, he says something about being IC champion and Ahmed Johnson. Anther crappy WWF gimmic circa 95-96, im glad they survived it.

Jake Roberts VS Jerry Lawler: Lawler talks and talks. Trys to give Roberts an oversized bottle, Roberts pulls out his snake and puts it on Lawler and he runs out. Mark Henry did guest commentary by the way. The match itself sucked and was a waste of time.

Undertaker VS Mankind: I love hardcore matches but some are by the books. This was a Boiler Room brawl so it was suppose to be different. Well I never got thru this whole match because it sounded stupid. Paul Bearer turns on Undertaker at the end, the only part worth watching.

Vader VS Shawn Michaels: A decent match up. Vader's career never fully recovered in America after jobbing out to Hulk Hogan in WCW. WWF tried to build him as a monster but that failed. He had a few good matches but can anyone remember what he did? This match had two false finshes until HBK finally pins Vader. A good match but not a classic.

Overall, anther weak year for WWF. I don't remember why Bret Hart was out but he might have helped this poor card. No matches are really worth going out of the way for.",1238630400,,2359,4.261744966442953
7856891,4,6303937446,"This SummerSlam was one of the better ppv's in over a year!  I mean this started out with Owen Hart beating Savio Vega and it was very comical.  The rest of the card up until the Boiler Room Brawl was back and forth average and above average matches.  Nothing really spectaculer until the brawl.  Now Mandkind and Undertaker put on a hell of a battle.  This was the most hardcore I have seen in the WWE since Diesel VS HBK IN UR HOUSE.  I think wat Vince was doing was trying to do the same thing as WCW and make PAul Bearer turn on the taker just like HOgan did to Savage.  SO after Mandkind won HBK pinned vader in what was a pretty good paced DAVID vs GOLIATH type main event

Overall a 8/10 ppv",1145664000,,698,4.080882352941177
