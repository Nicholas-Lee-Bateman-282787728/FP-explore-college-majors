264889,5,6300216373,"I finally had a chance to see a print of this film.  Absolutely amazing.  It is a shame that only a pan-and-scan poorly mastered VHS exists of it.

The truly sad thing is the new telecine (digital mastering) IS DONE!!  It has been done for 5 years now.... I've actually had a chance to see clips on the telecine machine at Paramount.  Absolutely stunning.  It's just that Paramount isn't sure there is an audience for it (and hence, profit for them) to put it in print.

Anyway, the film is brilliant.  Conrad Hall watched the VHS version before he shot any film (as horrid as the transfer was to VHS).  Storarro's cinematography is simply amazing.  Help with the writing campaign to get a DVD of this film released.",1099785600,7,716,4.5234375

it IS great in every way. The acting and cinemathography is superb. You won't be bored for a moment of watching it!
And the murder scene is one of the most dramatic scenes I,ve ever watched and it stays in your visual memory forever!
Only one warning: the dubbing is horrible. I,ve watched it
both, and there is no comparison. Ofcourse, there is very little hope that they will release it in original Italian version, but
we always hope that somewhere there is another perfectionist,
like us.
Maybe it would be interesting to know, that in the book this film
was made after, the hero, Marcello, dies in the very end, but
Bertolucci decided to keep him alive, probably as a subtle hint
that any generic conformist will take the new face to adopt..

264895,5,6300216373,"It has been a few years since I've seen ""The Conformist"". But, this was the first Bernardo Bertolucci movie I ever saw. And the film has stayed with me all this time. Like some of the other customers on here, I too feel this is Bertolucci at his best.
 To be honest I really can't quite remember the story-line so well. A man named Marcello (Jean Louis Trintignant)is sent to assassinate his old professor, Professor Quadri (Enzo Tararscio), who left Italy when the fascist took over.
 Bertolucci managed to tell such a powerful, abosorbing story, that even in at it's most gritty moments, I couldn't turn away from the screen. There's a scene where two people are shot at that would probably be describe by people as disgusting, but, my eyes were glued to the screen. And this is the power most of Bertolucci's films have. Well, at least on me.
 I too feel it's a shame this film it not available on vhs or dvd. And because of that this film is not as well known as it should be. Here is a movie that many would agree upon as being one of Bertolucci's best films, and no one can see it. All most of us can do is just recall moments of the first time we saw it.
 For anyone who ever gets a chance to buy this film or even rent, do it! It will truly be one of those rare films that will always keep coming back to you.
 Bottom-line: Simply Bernardo Bertolucci's best film! Powerful and absorbing. Bertolucci hits the bullseye.",1046995200,4,1425,4.342105263157895
264896,5,6300216373,"I agree that The Conformist should be released on DVD.  I also agree with the reviewer who said that The Conformist is undoubtedly Bertolucci's finest film and perhaps his only true masterwork. However, the dubbing is atrocious--and a similar problem exists with Truffaut's Day for Night--another film that is unavailable on DVD and which has previously been available only in a dubbed version.  Since I have seen The Conformist in the theater in the original language, I am confident that they could--with a little effort--release The Conformist in Italian.  The Conformist is a truly great film--with stunning cinematography. Bertolucci explores the question of why an intelligent thinker would care to become a fascist.  The answer is complex, startling and not ever comforting.  It's truly a shame that it has not yet been released on DVD; but it would be a travesty to release it on DVD as a dubbed version (as if voice is not part of acting.)",1038268800,18,948,4.974683544303797

A plot and a central character beautifully explored and rendered regarding the repression of one sexuallity and the repression of one's spirit.
Visually, this film is flawless...every set, every shot, so combined with a comtemplative and not so linear or literial presentation, it begs for multiple viewings.

264932,5,6300216373,"The social philosopher Hannah Arendt, an intellectual who was forced into exile from Europe to New York by the Nazis in the 1930s so she knew somewhat of where she spoke, famously described the actions of the common clay, those who actively went along with the regime, maybe would have followed any regime, during that Nazi reign collectively as agents of the banality of evil. By this I believe she meant that the human condition, human nature as it had evolved over the relatively short span of human existence had not moved all that far along despite all the efforts from the precept of humankinds inhumanity to its fellows when backed up against the wall, or even perceived that they had been backed up against the wall. Had either accepted evil regimes as the price for a quiet life, or actively participated in outrageously immoral acts in order to insure that quiet life. In short to conform. That premise can serve as the underlying theme in the film under review Bernardo Bertoluccis The Conformist. (Bertoluccis work last seen in this space in a review of his classic study of fascism in Italy down among the masses in the countryside-1900)

Here is how Arendts observation played out in this film. A scion of a wealthy family, an intellectual, Marcello, had been worried about his place in the sun, worried moreover about living the quiet life, the life where he is left alone to do his normal average quiet life thing whatever intellectual qualms he had about such mundane endeavors. But Marcello had been smart enough, had been opportunist enough to know that in the whirlwind of the 1930s in Italy under Mussolini that may not have been enough. So to protect himself, protect his future life with a woman whom he wished to marry, although he seemed indifferent to whatever charms had initially drawn him to her, and settle down with to that quiet life he volunteered his services to one of the Fascist security agencies. That may seem to you or me a hard way to protect the quiet life but, as seen in a series of flashbacks, Marcello had a lot to cover up in his past, or thought he did. Those included an adolescent homosexual experience (a no-no in martial manly Mussolini Italy) with one of the hired help, the murder of that person, and the drug dependency of his wealthy mother. Maybe any one of those, as he confessed them to a Catholic priest confessor would mean little but collectively they weighed on his mind. And hence his service to the state which he had no particular affinity for but was astute enough to see which way the winds were blowing and grabbed onto with both hands.

So Marcello joined a security service. Assignment: arrange the murder and cover-up of that murder of one of his old college professors, a devoted anti-fascist, who was then living in exile in Paris with his young attractive wife. The central portion of the film, aside from periodic flashbacks to his youth, involved Marcello setting a trap for the professor, and in the process falling in love with that professors young wife. Despite his best efforts to save the wife the professor and the wife were killed through his efforts (and those of a bunch of professional hit men.). And so as the film wound down after the murders we saw Marcello in a scene of seeming domestic tranquility playing with several years later. The quiet life assured. Problem: in 1943 Mussolini was overthrown by antifascist mostly Communist-led partisans. Marcello felt he was in social danger again. In the dramatic final scenes he was seen denouncing a former Fascist friend and probably anybody else he could throw on the scrapheap to save his silly little quiet domestic life. Yeah, Arendt was right on target with her banality of evil thoughts. Marcello the conformist, the chameleon, ready to take on any coloration no question. See this film that is also no question as well.",1465084800,5,3865,4.75

264951,4,6300216373,"Possible spoilers.  Many believe this film is Bernardo Bertolucci's masterpiece, and it would be hard to argue against that.  Set in 1938 Fascist Italy, Marcello Clerici (Jean-Louis Trintignant) is a mid-level employee of Mussolini's government.  He's assigned to travel to France and kill his former professor, a communist who left Italy when Mussolini came to power.

Marcello is dating the beautiful Giulia (Stafania Sandrelli) but when we see them together, it's clear that something is amiss.  Still, they get married.  Marcello and Giulia honeymoon in Paris and he arranges for a meeting with Prof. Quadri (Enzo Tarascio).  Quadri invites him to his home where Marcello finds Quadri surrounded by bodyguards.  In a terrific scene we also get to see Marcello dazzled by Quadri's young wife, Anna (Doninique Sanda, a heartthrob of my youth).  In a beautifully photographed film, the story has Marcello falling for Anna and sometimes Giulia, Anna for Marcello and sometimes Giulia and Quadri falling for Giulia.

Confused?  Well homosexuality has strong overtones throughout the film and provides a flashback scene with a young Marcello having a sexual encounter with an older chauffer that has a lasting impact.  In a climactic scene, Marcello and a partner, always in the background, follow the professor and Anna into the mountains where they are ambushed.  But Marcello doesn't have the courage to even confront his supposed friends.  ""The Conformist"" is a very interesting film that draws you in as the film progresses.  You must pay attention as much of the intrigue doesn't hit you over the head but is nuanced, much like the sexuality.  The reality is that bi-sexuality would be the operative word today in the various relationships.

What really makes the film stand out however, is the wonderful cinematography, startling camera angles and color combinations.  There is a great scene where the Quadris and the Clericis go to a club to dance.  The room draws attention from the professor and Marcello and everyone else in the room when Anna and Giulia, both outfitted in sleek, satiny gowns dance to a sultry song.  I like that memory... and the film as well.  Recommended.",1435795200,2,2185,5.1331444759206795

Excellent quality, comparable to CC releases. My only issue was that the font size of the subtitles was very small and the white letters were on occasion impossible to read.

There are two marvelous scenes in this.fine film that deserve special attention; the murder scene in the forest and the tango In the caf in Paris.

Also. Trintignant gives his usual subtle performance. He will give just a glimpse of a smile sometimes which conveys his understanding of a situation similar to what he did in ""Z"". Also, Bertolucci in the interview section of the BR gives him credit for supplying ""color"" to a gray role by his unexpected body language and hints of humor.

264975,5,6300216373,"[This review pertains to the 2014 US Blu Ray edition only.]

I love this film. I have previously owned it on VHS and DVD and I've watched it at least 50 times. I couldn't wait for Blu Ray and it does not disappoint. To be sure, the original material is subject to the limits of production that existed at the time it was made. Much of the movie is shot in softer focus than we are accustomed to these days. The titles still suffer from some color bleed and the soundtrack is still a bit tinny. But this is an art house movie. No one is ever going to underwrite a complete Blu Ray remaster and overhaul.

Instead, you can expect a HD transfer of a pristine print, giving you access to more of the cinematography, as it was intended for the big screen. This turns out to be very important, since this is universally acknowledged to be a masterpiece of cinematography. The images acquire a remarkable depth of field, and I found myself noticing details I'd never seen before. I found the extent to which this change alone amplified the film's drama and pathos quite remarkable.

The translation is also very, very good. Previous subs and dubs have failed to capture the literary nuance of the script, adapted from Alberto Moravia's masterpiece of the same name. Somehow the English dub here has been improved dramatically over it's incarnation in DVD, and a LOT more of the book comes through. It's not clear to me exactly what they did to fix it. The voices sound identical, and the memorable lines have been translated in the same way, but the speech fits the action much, MUCH better than the DVD sub did. Watching the English dub with Italian subtitles (and vice versa) gives access to much more of the Italian script than was possible with previous editions. One problem: the dub was missing from several scenes on my copy. I don't really care, but it is a little disappointing, mostly because the new dub is unusually good.

The Blu Ray edition also eliminates the abrupt between-scene cuts that featured prominently in older editions. I always found these jarring, and it's nice to learn that they were artifacts of a bad edit, and not a sour note by Mr. Bertolucci.",1418688000,27,2170,4.585051546391752

The Conformist was directed by directed by Bernardo Bertolucci in 1970. It has a dreamlike story arch that opens your mind in a familiar 1970's fashion.  There were many philosophical, risky, and challenging films that came out during this time period. The Conformist is certainly one of the leaders of the genre.
The story moves as effortlessly through past & present as it does through style & substance.  There is a lot going on here. Every frame holds answers and asks questions. This is essentially the story of a man with some seriously heavy things on his mind.  He is about to be married because he wants to be normal. His father is an institutionalized insane war criminal. Furthermore, he accidentally killed a man when he was 13.  This could possibly have set the tone for his entire decadent life. All of this has lead him up to his position as a card carrying member of the of the fascist secret police under Mussoli. He is a given a mission that only he can accomplish. He must get close to a man he greatly admires, and take him out.  On the outside he is normal, through the worlds eyes he is everything but that. All of this and he still desires to conform. Every strange element and experience this charter has is a statement by the director, Bernardo Bertolucci. The Conformist is an art film. It is deep, thoughtful, and striking. It is most certainly way out there, and at times, firmly planted in reality. The abstract line that it so confidently walks is it's greatest charm.",1345420800,,1644,4.559322033898305
265004,5,6300216373,"For my money Bertolucci's very best film. It combines many his recurring themes; politics (especially fascism in Italy and it's effects), sexuality and identity, the need to belong, the struggle to be an individual.

The film perfectly walks a knife's edge between realism and surrealism, supported by Vitorio Storraro's breathtaking and unique cinematography.

The film works brilliantly on a simple realist level. A sort of political thriller and character study (much like Coppola's 'The Conversation') we follow an agent of Mussolini's secret police (a great performance by Jean-Louis Trintignant, even dubbed into Italian) as he's sent to assassinate one of his old professors, now teaching in exile in Paris. On that level the film is filled with odd twists and turns as Marcello tries to carry out his mission.

But there's also something larger and more mysterious being explored here, from the constant not-quite-realistic images, to Marcello's
occasionally very odd (and sometimes funny) behavior, to the flashbacks to an early homosexual encounter, we are trapped, with the character, in a sort of Kafkaesque dream world. It's as if somehow Bertolluci has pulled off the very neat trick of making a film that's simultaneously objective and subjective, a dream and a reality, surreal and hyper-real. And he makes the two dance together to create a bigger whole.

My only tiny quibble;, a few moments seem a little too on the nose in their symbolism for a film of such subtlety, but that's a tiny complaint about a great film.

The Raro blu-ray is the very best transfer, at least to my eye.  Sharpest, deepest.  The UK Arrow blu-ray is fine, but lags a couple of steps behind.  The DVD is watchable, but I've upgraded twice since then, and this film deserves it.",1341619200,4,1772,5.065292096219931
265005,2,6300216373,"Except for cinematography by Vittorio Storaro, this film is way over rated. It is totally homophobic. The entire premise of the reason the protagonist was a Fascist murderer is because he thought he accidentally shot and killed a man who molested, or at least tried to molest him once when he was 13. The man was 6-10 years older. So he became a murderer for Mussolini. WTF? What about all those dozen adult men and women who are shown standing two feet away while a dozen kids his age have his pants pulled down and are molesting him en masse, for who knows how many times. No, that would not make him a murderer. The guy who molested him was not a homosexual. He was a child molester, because the boy was prepubescent, presumably. Later in the film, we see the ""homosexual"" trying to pick up a much older male prostitute. I don't think child molesters evolve to like older people as sexual partners, so this is not true to life. He is also shown to be a total wimp, a stereotype. The protagonist's new wife confesses to having been raped for 6 years by a man 50 years older and says she enjoyed it. She seems as normal as anybody in the film. Talk about a double standard! The director should have followed the golden rule of filmmaking: Make films about things you know about. The dialogue, dubbed or not is ridiculous. It's so baldly dubbed, they could have said intelligent things that people might actually say. added bonus, gratuitous exploitation of the star actresses tits. You can see the blue gel wrapping the dance room moving in the wind. The only person not dancing was the Fascist murderer and his assistant. How inconspicuous. Brutally grotesque murder scene tops it off. Francis Ford Coppola, Sidney Lumet, and other filmmaker wrote a letter to talk an American distributor into distributing the film. Perhaps they first should have consulted with their gay friends to see how they felt about being stereotyped in film or on TV as child molesters, too typical of the time the film was made, 1970.",1334275200,2,2013,4.625698324022347

Marcello's wife is the conformist,obedient to dictates of church and state,which is why Marcello marries her,and she offsets his shame at his mad father,addicted mother. Marcello struggles with abnormal tendencies,having shot Lino,a homosexual chauffeur when he was a teenager. He is uneasy with abnormality. The need for normality drives him to conform to society's mores,embrace fascism,marry a mediocre conventional,sensual woman. Safety in the herd,fear of being different,makes Marcello join a movement given to abnormality,and that asks him to repeat the action he ran away from:murder. The violent and selfish tendencies Marcel sees in himself are absorbed by a philosophy that condones them. We identify with him because Moravia depicts a complex person,with all his strengths and weaknesses,how easy it was to follow the political fashion.

However, Marcello doesn't do what he thinks is right but what other people think is right due to his ambivalent sexuality(also most of the characters fall in love with people who do not return their love).He fears his natural impulses,nearly giving in only to realize how dangerous it is. The normality that he had sought was entirely made up of abnormalities,he comes to realize. The hidden becomes revealed. He is shadowed everywhere by Manganiello,an agent with experience of spying and killing. He brings him his orders,checks on his progress,tells him to stop procrastinating and act.""Action must be swift and decisive"",he says,yet is resigned to Marcello's inability to act,pondering each situation excessively. This is conveyed in his confession to a priest,his conversation with a blind fascist mentor,showing the real tension beneath the external subject matter.

The noir elements are conveyed by the flash-back,chronology-chopping structure,the out-of-kilter camera angles framing the anti-hero,the cinematography of blue,red and yellow,showing the entirely cinematic perplexity and wonder. The rich colours,chiaroscuros,the rigid lines of fascist architecture set the tone of authoritarian hierarchy. Bertolucci,weaned from Godard's political and aesthetic radicalism,finds here his own style in which complex political and psychological exploration is presented through elegant camerawork. In The Conformist, the Parisian phone number of the betrayed professor is that of Jean-Luc Godard,a father figure he symbolically kills off. The past plays out while Clerici rides in his car, chatting with his fascist bodyguard(even the flashbacks themselves have flashbacks and keep us unsettled) the film is able to concentrate our attention on the present of decision-making whose results Bertolucci identifies with Fascism itself. The journey is really one agonizing process of choice - will Marcello intervene to save the life of his beloved, or will he watch her murder in complicitous passivity?The heroic ethos turns cowardly for Marcello on the road to Savoy.

The film has an excellent musical score,great acting from Trintignant as Marcello, Stefania Sandrelli as Giulia, Dominique Sanda(Lina) as the bisexual Professor's wife, and Gastone Moschin's Blackshirt;uses the brilliant cinematographer,Vittorio Storaro and the design of the film moves from highly ordered, spatial architecture, precise tracking shots,highly controlled movements by the actors,with the latter part of the film draped in shadows or brightly lit by harsh lights,to create a sense of violent social turmoil,chaos,disintegration with Il Duce's fall,odd lighting effects,collapsing symbols of fascism's fall,disorderly protest,the return of the suppressed into full view for the protagonist in this existential nightmare of image and dialogue.

265025,4,6300216373,"This is a movie that could be made in any era due to its timeless theme.  Fascist Italy, however, is a perfect setting for ""The Conformist"" where as in all totalitarian states conformity is required, not an option.  Jean-Louis Trintignant is perfectly cast as Marcello Clerici, a fascist assassin sent to Paris on a covert mission. Trintignant's slight figure, his humorless, unsmiling demeanor, and his consciously formal dress, including a hat that he cannot do without, project him as the perfect wannabe conformist.

Based upon a traumatic childhood experience Clerici not only has a need to conform he is impelled to take conformity to its extreme; assassinating non-conformists. His confession before his marriage is a brilliant scene and Trintignant's interaction with the confessor priest reveals the heart of his motivation and his sense of self.

His target is a former professor he admired as a student, Professor Quadri. The professor has left Italy for Paris due to his anti-fascist views and is viewed as dangerous by a mysterious arm of the fascist government.  The scene where he discusses Plato's cave with the professor is worth the price of admission in itself.

Two beautiful women in his life represent the extremes that pull at his conformist soul as he proceeds toward the intended assassination.  Stefania Sandrelli, as his wife Giula, represents the carefree, sensual, emotional part of his life.  Dominique Sanda, as the professor's wife, Anna, represents sensuality of a different type. She appeals to his intellect as well as his sense of real love.

When Anna is formally introduced to Clerici as the professor's wife Clerici is stunned and aroused.  Trintignant manages to convey both emotions with one look, the sign of a truly great actor.  He has seen her in very different circumstances earlier in the movie. Anna provides the tension and inner conflict for Clerici which leaves the assassination of the professor in doubt.

Sanda is quite believable as a woman who could have that effect on a man in real life.  One need not suspend a sense of disbelief to be convinced.  Without her presence there would be no doubt about the assassination for Clerici.  That tension and doubt results in a climactic scene that is stunning.

Bertolucci, in this 1970 release, is already displaying his trademark genius for visual beauty.  Even scenes which are ugly are shot in an extraordinary cinema graphic style.  His use of light, switching from black and white to color depending on the scene, shows real genius at work.  The same cinematographer, Vittorio Storaro, who later collaborated with him on ""The Last Emperor,"" was also a young man at the time of release.  The ""Special Features"" where the two discuss their innovations in the use of color and light is almost as fascinating as the movie.

The ""Special Features"" also present very interesting insights into the artistic process in film and the dynamism of plot development.  The only negative in this movie is that the flashback technique is overused to the point of confusion.  All the other elements of the movie, though, show the promise of a great director at an early age.",1226102400,,3162,5.026871401151632

But then this is not sufficiently clearly sketched to make any real sense; it's the kind of thing that can only be taken seriously in the context of a particular kind of left-wing European machismo of the 1960s. Otherwise it's nonsense. Perhaps one's not meant to take it as ""realism"" but as ""symbolism"" all the way through the film, but even then it fails to join the dots; certainly, it doesn't work as ""realism"".

The entire film is symbolism of man's search for himself and discovery of one's true identity.

In the course of the assignment, which incidentally takes place during Marcello's honeymoon in Paris, Marcello reconnects with his former philosophy professor he is tasked to eliminate.  With flashbacks from his childhood and completion of the assignment, Marcello finally uncovers that behind the facade of happily married man and a father, he is damaged homosexual whose denial led him to a life of professional assasin whose life is full of treason, murder and misplaced ideals.  This is a masterpiece of a film.  Everything is pure perfection: the actors, costumes, colors, symbols, music.

Bertolucci wrote the script which was later nominated for The Academy Award and made the perfect film, refined, complex, and visually amazing.  The film portrays the corrupting deadly power of Fascism and does it much better than the same  director's 5 hours long ""1900"" (1976) and ""Il Conformista"" does not even have a character like the monstrous Fascist, sadist-murderer Attila Mellanchini. ""Attilas"" of the world are obvious (it does not mean that they are less dangerous) but ""Marcello Clericis"" are not - all they want to do -is  to fit in, to be accepted, to look and act normal, to conform,  and there is no limit to how far they'd go on the road of lies and betrayal. Marcello Clerici (Jean Lois Trintignan) tries to suppress a childhood episode of sex abuse that had changed him forever and made him believe that he could become an assassin. To prove his loyalty to the fascist state, he accepts the order of the party superiors to assassinate his former college professor known for his liberal anti-fascist outlooks. The professor left Italy and resides in exile in Paris with the much younger wife (Dominique Sanda). Marcello is not a murderer but he belongs to the sort of humans on whom the famous publicist, Bruno Yasiensky gave the immortal description: ""Do not be afraid of your enemies. At most, they can kill you. Do not be afraid of your friends. At most, they can betray you. Be afraid of indifferent people! It is due to their silent indifference that the worst things happen in the world.""

""Il Conformista"" is deservingly famous for its stunning cinematography by Vittorio Storaro (who also shot for Bertolucci ""The Last Tango in Paris"" and ""The Last Emperor""), production design by Nedo Azzini,  Original Music by Georges Delerue, and Costume Design by Gitt Magrini.

The only critique that I could possibly make is that the violence in the film looks horribly fake -- a notion that is completely negated by the fact that The Conformist served to inspire the visual language that was used in films like The Godfather and The Unbearable Lightness of Being, to the point where it's legitimately prophetic.

The other roles were more movie-conventional, when you come to think about it. This goes for both Trintignant and Sanda, which is not to criticise them. The content of the story provides great mental stimulation, although I have some doubts. So people with a compulsion to conform are repressed homosexuals with traumatic childhood secrets? So anti-fascists are bi-sexuals who indulge in voyeuristic pleasures? Can't see much difference between fascist conformists and communist conformists, myself: there's always ""normalcy"", power and safety in joining the crowd, whatever the ideology or the politics. Not that the Professor is overtly presented as a communist, but the street violet-seller pointedly plugs the Internationale.

265043,4,6300216373,"Il Conformista (Bernardo Bertolucci, 1969)

Bertolucci's Oscar-nominated (Best Adapted Screenplay) The Conformist traces the life of Marcello Clerici (Jean-Louis Trintignant), a mousy individual trying to make a name for himself in Mussolini-era Italy by rising through the ranks of the Fascist party. To test his resolve, his superior gives him an assignment: go to Paris to assassinate one of his old college professors, Quadri (Enzo Tarascio). Clerici, who's engaged, moves up his wedding date and uses his honeymoon as cover for the Paris trip. His sheltered wife, Giulia (Stefania Sandrelli), knows nothing of his outside activities, but Quadri's daughter Anna (Dominique Sanda) sees right through him. Anna wants to keep an eye on Clerici, Clerici wants to keep tabs on Quadri, and Giulia is simply confused and somewhat lonely, so the three of them become something of an item, laced with tension both sexual and otherwise, as Clerici steels himself to do the deed.

This is one of those cases where, while I recognize the depth and technical mastery that went into this film, it just didn't seem to grab me the way I know it should. I'm not entirely sure why that is, because piecemeal, I loved everything about it. The soundtrack is perfect, the camerawork is great, the characters are well-realized, the acting is good, the script well deserved its Oscar nomination. I should have felt a thrill of bitter disappointment at the final scene; it's exactly what Bertolucci was after, and he set it up with precision and finesse. In fact, the entire construction of the movie, leading up to that final scene, is masterful in every way. And yet somehow, Clerici's actions there struck me as almost resigned (or, perhaps, I should say I was resigned to Clerici's actions in the final scene). There was no other way the movie could have ended to bring everything to a crux, and usually when that happens, and the director pulls it off, it's a thrill to watch. This time, I just didn't see it. Again, I have no idea why that is. I can't not recommend this movie; it should be used as a textbook in Film 101 for how to make an existential-angst flick. It's fantastic in every way.

265046,5,6300216373,"""The Conformist"" was Bernardo Bertolucci's first real masterpiece, where his editing style matured, thanks to Franco Arcalli. Bertolucci adapted the screenplay from Alberto Moravia's novel of the same name. Where the naturalistic tones and lack of visual contrivance typical in the cinema of the early 1970s can look amateurish or flat today, ""The Conformist"" exudes visual power through Vittorio Storaro's contrasting light and shadows and Ferdinando Scarfiotti's art direction. The sensuous glamour of 1930s Paris accentuates this powerful story of the Conformist, a man driven by his intense desire for normalcy in spite of his own nature, at a time when conformity meant fascism.

In Mussolini's Italy of the 1930s, Marcello Clerici (Jean-Louis Trintignant) intends to construct a ""normal"" life to ease his constant feelings of otherness. He proposes marriage to Guilia (Stefania Sandrelli), a frivolous young petite bourgeoise. He disposes of his mother's drug-dealing lover. He joins the Secret Police to ferret out the nonconformists. He is assigned the task of assassinating an anti-fascist expatriate living in Paris, where he and Guilia will be honeymooning. The man is Professor Quadri (Enzo Tarascio), whom Marcello knew as a student. But just as Marcello despises dissent and individualism, he is irresistibly drawn to it in the form of Quadri's beautiful and daring young wife Anna (Dominque Sanda).

Shifts in time early in the movie are disconcerting, but the unease created by the discontinuity echoes Marcello's discomfort with his own nature. Bertolucci has changed the ending. I might have preferred the ending from the book, though they both express futility. The bachelor party scene actually did not make the ""final"" cut, but was unearthed and added to the DVD version. Though it is a curious scene, I could have done without. But ""The Conformist"" is an uncompromising commentary on the implications of conformity under the wrong circumstances, as seen in a man who is smart enough to know very well what he is doing and why. Strange that he is almost sympathetic. Italian with optional subtitles.

The DVD (Paramount 2006): ""The Rise of the Conformist: The Story, the Cast"" (13 min) includes interviews with Bernardo Bertolucci about the script, casting, Marcello's character, and with cinematographer Vittorio Storaro about story and themes. ""Shadow and Light: Filming The Conformist"" (14 min) features Bertolucci commenting on Scarfiotti's art direction and the film's ending. Vittorio Storaro explains his use of distinct light and shadow areas to delineate character, including the ""prisoner of Plato"" scene in Quadri's office as metaphor for cinema as a shadow of reality. In ""The Conformist: Breaking New Ground"" (11 min), Bertolucci discusses preserving the ""wildness"" of the dailies in editing, the film's structure, and how the film almost didn't open in the US.

265069,5,6300216373,"Marcello Clerici (Jean-Louis Trintignant) is a fascist when the fascists are in power but becomes an antifascist when the fascists lose power.  Hence he is the conformist of the title of this extraordinary movie adapted by Italian film legend Bernardo Bertolucci from Alberto Moravia's novel.  But more significant than his political conformity is his ability to bend his sexual nature to what is acceptable.  The defining event of his childhood is his incomplete seduction by a gay chauffeur, whom he more or less accidentally kills.  When conformity to the fascist rule in Italy under dictator Benito Mussolini becomes the norm, Marcello marries the ordinary (but very pretty) Giulia (Stefania Sandrelli) whom he describes as ""all bed and kitchen.""  Marcello thereby sentences himself to a boring but secure petite bourgeois existence.  He will simply suppress his ""abnormal"" instincts.

In a sense this is a character study using a familiar theme, that of sexual repression leading to repressive political expression, such as psychoanalytic theory assigned to the fascist mentality.  But Marcello is less interested in sadistic expression as he is with a secure existence.  He is something of a shrewd coward, cold, calculating, and indifferent to the feelings of others.  We see this strikingly in the scene in the woods when Anna Quadri (Dominique Sanda), who is being chased by fascist thugs, pounds desperately on his car window.  But he is completely unmoved and just stares at her with consummate indifference.

But what really enhances this film, making it one of the best I've ever seen, is the beautiful cinematography by Vittorio Storaro and the extraordinarily designed sets and scenes envisioned by Bertolucci.  I am reminded of Michelangelo Antonioni's gorgeous Blow Up (1966) and Swedish director Bo Widerberg's stunningly beautiful  Elvira Madigan (1967) from the same era.  I think Bertolucci wanted to make a film that was politically and psychologically significant but also one that was strikingly beautiful.  He used not only sumptuous settings but hired two of the most beautiful actresses in Sanda and Sandrelli.  And because this movie is about sex (as it almost certainly must be, having been adapted from a novel by Moravia who was a master at expressing human sexuality) Bertolucci made the movie sexy and sensual.  Sanda, whom I previously saw in Vittoria De Sica's The Garden of the Finzi-Continis which came out a year after El Comformista (1970) where she played the beautiful, enigmatic, but icy Micol Finzi-Contini, here plays Anna the bi-sexual wife of one of Marcello's college professors--the man whom Marcello has been instructed to help kill.  Sanda is exquisitely sensual as she works to seduce Giulia while at the same time both teasing and rejecting Marcello's advances.

Sandrelli is not be outdone. She too is beautiful and sensual even if the character she plays is a bit ordinary otherwise.  The scene on the train where she describes to Marcello how she was ravished as a teen by an older man (the family lawyer) is very moving sexually, and very revealing because Marcello takes her description as a guide in how to make love to his wife!  We can see clearly that he needs some instruction since he apparently is not really moved by her beauty.

While the film itself stands alone as an artistic achievement, I want to compare it to the novel from which it was adapted.  The main difference is that in the novel we learn so much more about the character of Marcello because of Alberto Moravia's use of an interior monologue throughout.  Rather than merely a conformist, in the novel we see that Marcello's character is that of someone who seeks the trappings of conformity and normality because he rightly fears he is not the entirely normal person he would like to be.  Ironically it is Giulia who nearly always conforms to what is considered normal behavior and who harbors uncritically the knee jerk beliefs and opinions that she has learned from church and state.  Marcello is attracted to her not so much because she is pretty but because she is authentically ordinary and therefore by association he too is not abnormal.  It is abnormality that Marcello fears.

The ending in the novel is also different than in the movie although the sense of who Marcello is does not change.  In the novel Quadri is a hunchback and his wife is clearly a lesbian who has married him for convenience and security, whereas in this film she is bisexual and he is more like someone she might marry for love.  Another difference is in how what happens to the Quadris and the extent to which Marcello is responsible.  Bertolucci chose to have Marcello at the scene, whereas in the novel he has no direct experience of their fate.  Of course the novel, which is over a hundred thousand words long, goes more deeply into the character of Marcello than is possible in a film.  The true psychological complexity of his character comes through, especially his struggle with sexual ambiguity.  We see more clearly why he embraced fascism.

But the film is true to the novel in most respects and certainly in the main sense that Moravia intended, that of showing how a particular type of fascist mentality arises and is maintained.  But Marcello, although an authentic fascist is not necessary a typical one.  The idea that fascists in general follow the herd and adopt a superficial and uncultured world view is no doubt largely correct, but the essence of fascism is the belief in authoritarian rule, the stratification of society, intolerance of diversity, and a willingness, even an eagerness, to use force and violence to obtain such ends.  The psychology underlying the portrait by Moravia and Bertolucci is the idea that Marcello sees in himself violent and selfish tendencies and so it is only natural that he should adopt a political philosophy that condones and acts out such tendencies.",1181520000,4,5923,4.998980632008155
265070,5,6300216373,"Marcello (Jean-Louis Trintignant) wants to be ""normal,"" lead a normal life with a petite bourgeoisie wife: ""She's all bed and kitchen"" (Stephania Sandrelli) and all the accoutrements that that life brings with it: home, children, and a good job. But this is 1938 Italy and the ultimate in normalcy is being a fascist and so Marcello gets a job in a Fascist investigation bureau. His job is to find and assassinate any and all anti-fascists. At the age of 34, Marcello can see the light at the end of the tunnel that will take his life to what he considers normal: a mantra that he repeats over and over throughout director Bernardo Bertolucci's very fine film.

Marcello has spent his life in hiding from both his past as well as his present. He is wound up tightly, quiet, solemn, serious and seemingly not aware of the life that swirls around him. But whereas some people consciously hide yet are always aware of what surrounds them, Marcello walks around with blinkers on: blinkers that obfuscate almost every thing except his fantasy yellow brick road to Normal. What's particularly tragic about Marcello is that he doesn't understand that the concept of normalcy is a slippery slope, veritably indefinable and wholly unreachable.

There are only a handful of movies that feature a scene so unusual, so beautiful, perverse or extraordinary that it lingers in the mind long after the film ends. ""The Conformist"" contains such a scene: the iconic tango, dripping with over-the-top, blatant homosexual heat as performed by Stephania Sandrelli and Dominique Sanda in a Paris nightclub while the other dancers clear the floor, drop their jaws and marvel at the sensuality of it all. More importantly, Marcello,aghast glares at his wife both attracted and disgusted,his eyes filled with jealousy. But this is not a jealousy born from desire of her but jealousy born from Sandrelli's utter flamboyance and rigorous throwing off of any taboos about dancing with a woman (Sanda) who obviously wants her. This is something he could never, ever do.

Though directed with precision and gorgeously photographed by the master Vittorio Storaro, the psychology of Marcello's desperate need to subjugate himself emotionally and physically to the iron hand of fascism is facile and naive at best and murky at its worst: but also remember that the source material by Alberto Moravia is over 40 years old and this film dates from 1970: different times, different thinking. This only slightly mars Bertolucci's achievement here. As it is, ""The Conformist"" is a serious, thought-provoking, emotionally open and available film filled with amazing images and bursting with Life.",1180224000,3,2658,5.091743119266055

265073,5,6300216373,"So desperate is Marcello, portrayed by Jean-Louis Trintignant (""The Outside Man"") to lead a normal life after he suffers through the psychological  trauma of a sexual confrontation with the family chauffeur (played by the bizarre Pierre Clementi) when he was a child. As an adult he eventually succumbs to the political upheavals of Hitler's Nazi machine during the 1930's and conforms to Prime Minister Mussolini's fascist regime of Italy. Working as an agent for the government he's assigned a mission to assassinate a college professor in Paris France whom Mussolini believes to be a threat to the fascist party. The murder is to take place while he's honeymooning with his newly wedded wife played to perfection by the lovely and charming Stefania Sandrelli (""Desideria""), and who manages to steal every scene she's in.

While ploting the assassination in Paris he encounters a problem by falling in love with the professor's wife (Dominque Sanda, who also starred in Bertolucci's ""1900"").  Matters are further complicated not only by  his attraction to the professor's wife, but his marriage as well as  his (manufactured) loyalty to the fascist regime. The eventual ending indicates what the title is and what he's always been throughout his life. Lavishly shot by the brilliant Vittorio Storaro (Apocalypse Now & Last Tango In Paris), this is considered Bernardo (The Spider's Stratagem & The Last Emporer)  Bertolucci's ""breakthrough"" film and perhaps his greatest acheivement in cinema as he was also nominated for an Oscar  for his screenplay. This mesmerizing look at the social values of World War II Italy is not to be missed and remains one of the all-time great films of the 70's.

265076,4,6300216373,"Having just seen SOPHIE SCHOLL:THE FINAL DAYS (Zeitgeist Video) -- a magnificent study of political courage, I was ready for a film that portrayed the opposite. The anti-hero of THE CONFORMIST reveals how fickle moderns can be about their political beliefs and sexual partners. Marcello chooses to be a Fascist and carry a gun because it helps him compensate for the abuse he suffered as a child. It satisfies his his thirst to recover his maculine ""potency"" and avenge those who would ever hurt him again.

Perhaps the final scene is greatest because it reveals the theme of the movie with clarity. The film is very psychoanalytic, and if that's what floats your boat you'll be satisfied with the script and characterization.

Having said that, Bertoluci offers some engaging ideas and a generally fine script based on the novel by Moravia. What I found less than satisfying (as I have in other Bertolucci films) is his garbled approach to cinematography, in which the camera is at once panoramic, then jittery and hand-held, then sharp, then fuzzy, then filtered -- for no reason apparent to an intelligent viewer. Also, the extended version adds footage the theatrical cut might have done without, because the film slows periodically  and the the narrative tension sags.

There is also an element to Bertolucci's view of human sexuality that seems eternally decadent, devoid of all love, at times prurient without purpose. I find that depressing, and asume some viewers will, too,

The best reason to see the film is for its  performance artistry. The camera loved Dominique Sanda, and she was her most magnetic here. More seductive than the physical actress were her restrained, very powerful dramatic skills. She plays several diffrent ""characters"" in the film, and each has a multifaceted personaity. Her eyes could drill holes in concrete, but so could her powers of speech.

Trintignant was perfect for the role of a secret agent with the soul and resolve of a toasted marshmallow. While his famous ""mad scene"" comes on too quickly and escalates at a feverish pace, his performance throughout most of the film is hypnotic and nuanced. Once moment he is pure evil, then completely vulnerable. First: the rough womanizer and then an impotent, shamed loner.

From a plotting perspective, it's difficult to fully believe Marcello's marriage to his silly, bourgeous wife (played by Stefania Sandrelli) even though it may make sense thematically. It's dificult, therefore, to shift from the hard realism Bertolucci crafts to the occasionally implausible stuff he works into this script.

The extras on the DVD are generous and the transfer is generally good, though Criterion would have done better. At this price, though, it would be difficult to pass up such an important film that has odd resonance in our bizarre, very political age.

265093,5,6300216373,"It is tempting to attribute the stylistic differences between Bertolucci's three great films to maturity, but each well reflects the rapidly emerging trends during film's most turbulent, and perhaps greatest decade.  1900 appeared at the end of the decade at a time when other directors struggled to find meaning and closure showcasing ensembles within an epic frame, such as Altman's Nashville and Leone's Once Upon a Time in America.  Four year earlier, Brando's virtuoso improvisation in Tango displayed the same searching rage as Nicholson in Five Easy Pieces and DeNiro's Taxi Driver.

The Conformist is very much akin to the barrier breaking daring yet tightly packaged product that epitomized the last years of the 60's.  While a perfect cast performs impeccably, it is the director as magician who dominates, fracturing the timeline, alternating between stark realism and stylized flashes of the surreal.  The audience is challenged to comprehend the pieces while accommodating an unfamiliar mixture of emotion.  It is surely artistry at the highest level.

We live in an interesting time when annual reviews of the year's best releases tend more and more to focus on that which is rediscovered (such as last year's Coltrane/Monk concert, or recent remasterings of Bunuel and Lang).

The acting is superb in this movie. Specifically, Jean-Louis Trintignant delivers an excellent performance. Touches of humor don't seem forced (I think of the scene at the brothel in particular), yet his torment and humanity are amazingly believable. The rest of the cast also give fantastic performances.

This film is widely acknowledged to be influential to many modern filmmakers, and it's easy to see why. Visually, the film never stops captivating the audience with its amazing scenery.

This landmark film like fine wine, now that it has been remastered by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, and presented with color intact in widescreen in Italian and French, emerges as a true classic. The dispicable VHS dubbed panned & scanned version that we have been watching for over 20 years can be ""retired"". Bernardo Bertolucci's truth is once again on display. This release sparkles with clarity, and we can thrill to the carefully presented imagery and the powerful symbolism.

Bertolucci, under 30 when he directed CONFORMIST, has become a wonderfully gifted and powerful force in cinema; and never more so than in this fledging effort. He must have storyboarded every moment. The film is tighter than a Rolex; no wasted seconds or icons. In this film he began to explore the vistas of sensuality and sexuality that only two short years later would blossom into THE LAST TANGO IN PARIS (1972); and then would spill out all over the lens and screen in his latest effort, THE DREAMERS (2003).

Alberto Moravia wrote the original novel at over 300 pages. Bertolucci did a marvelous job of extracting the essence of the protagonist, Marcello Clerici, and constructing a fabulous film, complex, lyrical yet brutal, beautiful yet shocking, shallow one moment and lethal the next, full of madness, repressed homosexuality, religious hypocracy, petty politicos, blind people, assassins, victims, and a never ending line of characters being cajoled or abused or eliminated or shamed or extolled. This is the Italy of the late 30's and early 40's, when the bald bulldog, Mussolini, strutted in the shadow of Hitler, dreaming of a new Roman Empire --about ordinary citizens who either resisted the Fascists or joined them. The ones who ""resisted"" had to be hunted down and eliminated by the ones who ""accepted"" Fascista ""normalcy"".

This is a film that needs to be seen more than once. The film opens mid-thrid act, and speeds its entirity in flashback, bringing us up to speed. Just one viewing leaves even the hardiest film buff limp and confused. Somewhere during the 2nd or 3rd viewing, Bertolucci's motives make themselves accessible and evident.

Jean-Louis Trintignant is the perfect Clerici, a successful professor, a loner, who wants to bet married and become a member of the Brown Shirts in order to ""fit in""; and along the way we discover the dark side of his nature, confirming his cowardice and true nature. Stefania Sandrelli was very lovely as Guila, the young wife. But the film was stolen by the smoldering sexuality of Dominque Sanda, striking a Marlene Dietrich pose in tight pants, with her hands in her pockets, and a cigarette dangling out of one corner of her mouth. She is a woman of huge appetites and dark secrets.",1166400000,36,2788,4.989247311827957

I met some minor problems with the subtitles, but let me also add that their choice is wide. The 16/9 ratio respects the original and it looks great even on a big plasma screen. The interviews of Bertolucci and Storaro (in English!) in the extra make the whole thing a must.

265119,5,6300216373,"What kind of man gets himself in such a pickle that --- on his honeymoon --- he's given a gun and asked to kill a professor he's always admired?

That is the question presented to us at the beginning of ""The Conformist,"" as Marcello Clerici (Jean-Louis Trintignant) sits in a Paris hotel room, waiting for the call that will tell him it's time to kill the professor. If you love movies, the answer --- told in a series of flashbacks, and, on occasion, flashbacks within flashbacks --- will make for one of the most rewarding cinematic experiences of your life.

Let's get the praise out of the way right off. Bernardo Bertolucci --- known to most moviegoers for his Oscar-winning ""The Last Emperor"" and his down-and-dirty ""Last Tango in Paris"" --- made ""The Conformist"" at 29. It is a young man's film, drenched in ambition. It is also Bertolucci's greatest film. Indeed, it is one of the ten greatest films I've ever seen.

My reasons?

First, ""The Conformist"" is beautiful in the extreme. The cinematographer was the great Vittorio Storaro, and his color palette is so exquisite that Francis Ford Coppola watched this film over and over before making ""The Godfather"" --- and then hired Storaro to shoot ""Apocalypse Now."" The production designer was Ferdinando Scarfiotti, whose credits include ""Death in Venice"" and ""Scarface."" And Georges Delerue, who did the scores for ""Jules and Jim"" and ""Platoon"", composed the music.

Then there is the acting. Trintignant is one of the most familiar faces in French cinema; this is the performance of his life. But mostly, I want to praise Dominique Sanda, then just 22 years old and making only her third movie. She plays the professor's wife, and she unfailingly strikes a remarkable balance --- on one hand, she's the loyal spouse, on another, she's a bi-sexual flirt, and on yet a third, she's the only character in the story who senses the tragedy that lies ahead.

And, finally, there is the story, adapted from the novel by Alberto Moravia, one of Italy's most seductive novelists. Sex is almost a character for Moravia, and it certainly is here --- as the title suggests, Clerici's greatest desire is to be normal, to be one of the faceless masses, to conform.

That's not so easily done in Italy in 1936. Mussolini has brought down the Fascist boot; progressives have fled the country. So Clerici takes a rich, vapid wife. He makes his accommodation with the government. And with that --- he thinks --- he's safe.

But there are no hiding places in life --- and certainly not in a dictatorship of madmen. And then there is the question of the past: How do you acquire a ""normal"" life if you never had one before? As we flash back, we see that Clerici's privileged childhood was anything but normal. His mother awoke at noon, looking for her first shot of the day. He was raised by nannies. And then there was the encounter with the chauffeur...

What Bertolucci is exploring here is the equation of politics with sex. In a film financed by an American studio, that equation would be explicit and vulgar. Here, every connection is made through imagery and suggestion. Your jaw will drop at scene after scene, but you'll be on the edge of your seat during one in particular --- an evening at a Parisian dance hall when Sanda dances with Clerici's wife. It's a breathtaking seduction, hotter in some ways than sex itself.

Why does Clerici freeze when he's given a gun? Can he kill the professor? What happens to Sanda? And, jumping ahead, what does the Fascist's defeat mean for Clerici? Bertolucci's screenplay is brilliant on these key questions; you are always leaning in, thinking it through, putting the puzzle together. And, of course, you are invited to imagine --- as we always do in great films --- how would I handle this? What would I do if I were Clerici?

And now I must share some tragic news: ""The Conformist"" is not available on DVD. There's only a VHS. The consolation: Storaro oversaw the transfer. Still, the difficulty of seeing this remarkable film is an injustice that somebody really ought to fix.

For those too frustrated to rent or acquire a VHS tape of ""The Conversation,"" let me recommend ""The Garden of the Finzi-Continis"", also starring Dominique Sanda, made a year later and exploring some of the same themes. Or you could read Alberto Moravia's novel. But be warned: This is that rare case --- a movie so much better than the book that reading it is a disappointment.",1151539200,158,4448,4.739974126778784

265125,5,6300216373,"Bertolucci's The Conformist is one of the most rapturously beautiful films ever made.  Brilliantly acted and swooningly filmed, it remains Bertolucci's greatest achievment, I believe.

Though I would love for Criterion to release this, they can't because Paramount owns the rights.  So it's up to them -- people please bug Paramount about this.  It's a disgrace that such a great film has essentially never been available for home viewers (and I don't count the dubbed, full-screen VHS travesty).  Please Paramount - GET ON IT ALREADY!",1115424000,12,535,5.247058823529412

Needless to say, I was absolutely blown away by the film and the amazing restoration. Some of those scenes have made an endelible imprint. I think it goes straight to the top of my all time list for best cinematography and directing. I mean what does it take to get them to finally just realease it on DVD. Jeez!",1107820800,9,451,4.317647058823529

7806751,4,6300216373,"This is a well-done film that combines realism and surrealism, conventional sex and homosexuality, showing courage and being a coward, being a fascist and an antifascist, being religious and being an atheist. Being on his honeymoon and drawn sexually to the wife of a man he is told to kill. It is about a man in conflict who is pulled to homosexuality, who experienced it but disdains it. He wants and needs to conform. It is a film that is filled with scenes that prompt viewers to interpret what is happening and why.",1522627200,,520,4.602150537634409

Its dissection and analysis of evil, cowardice, opportunism and conformity by one little man gives an eloquent testimony as to why and how fascism succeeded in Mussolini's Italy.",1520380800,,266,4.933333333333334

7806754,5,6300216373,"I remembered this as a good movie from my youth, but this Blu-ray taught me that it is a great film. There are scenes that will now live with me for the rest of my days, such as Marcello trying to walk with confidence, his leather shoes clattering on the polished marble floors and echoing through the mostly empty halls of the Ministry where he is to meet his Fascist party minders for the first time. There is a scene of the two women in his life dancing a tango together, oblivious to their amazed onlookers in a Paris dance hall. The film is not perfect, and editing cuts seem abrupt at times. The soundtrack can sound loud and brash. But all in all, I am very glad this great movie is on Blu-ray.",1512172800,,701,4.2388059701492535
