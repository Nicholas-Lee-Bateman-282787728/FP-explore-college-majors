1560458,5,B00005JOSO,"Must see for any Happy Madison fan.  This unfortunately was more of a sleeper hit than more publicised movies like The Longest Yard, but a garanteed laugh for sandler fans, stoners or gamers. SNL/Happy Madison cameos abound.

Only things missing were no cameos by Sandler and no ""You can do it, rip his freaking head off"" scene.

""My grandma drank all my weed""",1143763200,6,360,4.682539682539683
1560459,5,B00005JOSO,"First off this is a great film, I no some had some problems with it but if you like films like Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, Half Baked, Dazed and Confused and the list keeps rolling on! If you liked those films them you will love Grandmas boy. This is a film for all you stoners out there! So if you like to smoke and like to watch a funny film that will make that time even better then you will want to own this film which is perfect for repeat viewings!

Later dudes! [...]",1143676800,13,476,4.0638297872340425
1560460,5,B00005JOSO,"grandma's boy is definately the funnyest movie i have seen this year, and last year too probably, with the possible tie with The Longest Yard, also a adam sandler film. grandma's boy is the story of a man who is living the teenage gamer's dream, except with the living with his grandma. the constant vulgar sexual induendos and simple jokes, some how come together to make a hilariously stupid film. it jokes about what the teenage comunity does (i can testify for that) and it does a damn good job of it. the relations to sex, drugs and alochol in a hilarious way is somthing a teen can relate to, and half the time just say out loud ""that is so true."" only thing that this movie currently dissapoints me with, is that there is no DVD release date yet, which i plan to buy this DVD the day it comes out, or maybe download if im in a money crunch then,a definate ""grandma's boy"" move.",1140480000,4,884,4.331325301204819
1560461,5,B00005JOSO,"I went into this movie with the expectaions of a popsicle made out of poop. I was completley wrong. This movie is awsome...everything is funny in Grandma's Boy, exept for the larra croft doll scene in the bathroom. The video game aspect of the movie is quite hillarious as well. Go see this movie, it's probably already at the dollar theatre, therefor it will only cost you a buck or two. I'm going again this week.",1139011200,4,415,4.473684210526316
1560462,5,B00005JOSO,"I've seen this movie twice already. I never see a movie more than once in theaters (except Spider-man 1 and 2, and Bean).  If you like stupidity at it's best, this movie is for you. This is one of the best comedies this century! I'm the kind of person that watches dramas directed by Scorcese or starring Rober De Niro. But I love my comedies off-the-wall like this.  And yes, if you consider going to Starbucks a goodtime, this movie is not for you. You have to have a sense of humor. If that isn't you, see the gay cowboy movie...",1137542400,3,532,4.257425742574258
1560463,5,B00005JOSO,"It would be hard for anyone whos ever smoked pot not to enjoy this movie. It does have it's weird side , with a look at the ""inside"" world of video game designing, but overall I found myself laughing out loud a lot more often than I expected. It'll be a stoner classic along with Half Baked, Harold & Kumar Go 2 Whitecastle, and Chech n Chong. You should see it!",1137110400,5,362,4.112676056338028
1560464,1,B00005JOSO,TAKE MY ADVICE AND DO NOT SEE THIS FILTH.  YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.  YOU WILL NEVER GET THOSE 100 MINUTES BACK.  GO OUT WITH A DEAR FRIEND OR GROUP TO STARBUCKS AND HAVE A COFFEE OR MOCHA AND ENJOY SOME QUALITY TIME.,1136505600,11,218,4.142857142857143
1560465,4,B00005JOSO,"While not a high class comedy, this movie hits all of the right funny points and should become a college cult classic.

A 35 year old beta tester (Allen Covert) finds himself in a unique living situation trying to impress his boss surrounded by a lot of pot smoking characters.

Certainly a must see if you want a good laugh. Same production group that does all of Adam Sandlers movies, although a different twist since Covert is the star (appearances by some of the Sandler regulars).",1136505600,10,485,4.627906976744186

1560974,5,B00005JOSO,"This is just a fun movie  - just to be fun.  This is one of my favorite movies with a lot of laughs.  There's no message, no moral to the story, just totally stupid and funny and entertaining.  I mean there's a plot, it's a fairly slow plot, but that's good because you get to know the characters really well. It's joyously filled with all kinds of hilarious antics. Not for kids; this is a grownup movie with some raunchy humor. .  The characters are raucous and lovable. It's raunchy and dumb and lovable and funny all at the same time. It's definitely Adam Sandler humor; and I recognized several actors from The Water Boy.  I've watched it 3 times and would watch it again!",1517184000,,677,4.376

1560976,5,B00005JOSO,"It's really not a great movie or anything that special, but I saw it when it was in theaters and it's special to me, probably because it's one of the few comedies to deal with gamer culture. It's not like it handles the material terribly well, or with any depth, but it's nice to see the subject in general. Honestly I wish Hollywood would make a few more comedies about the lives of gamers and those who work in the industry. Another thing to note is it captures a certain golden time for gamers: The PS2/Xbox/Gamecube era where the future looked insanely bright and we were just drowning in good games from all angles. It's a fun time to revisit and this movie reminds me of it in so many ways. For the nostalgia trip alone I have to give it five stars.

 I'm from Colorado so I'll be open about this: It helps to watch intoxicated. It's a fun stupid stoner comedy, if you can relax and enjoy that and are a fan of video games then I can suggest this movie to you. Just don't expect a comedic masterpiece.",1515542400,3,1007,4.267015706806283
1560977,5,B00005JOSO,"So I like the stupid funny movies out there and this one is epic at that. It's a simple movie like the movie ""Friday"". The story and cast make this movie fun to watch. For an Adam Sandler movie it's really good.",1514937600,2,211,4.0476190476190474

1561972,2,B00005JOSO,"While having discussions about modern comedies, and thinking about which films will stand the test of time, the film, Grandma's Boy is always brought up, and I could never understand why. I saw this film when it first came out and was less than impressed, still I'm constantly hearing about the film and decided to give it a second chance, to see if I was missing something. What I always admired about this film, was that Adam Sandler finally gave his underlings the chance to shine. With experience comes knowledge, and the possibility of being more than just one liners in the middle of one of his films, that was the hope anyway. The story follows an adult game tester named Alex (Allen Covert), who is forced to move in with his Grandmother and become part of her Golden Girls lifestyle. Along with her and her roommates, there are several funny moments, but nothing to write home about. The rest of this film just isn't that funny! Most films about losers, connect to the audience and make you pull for them in the end, but when it comes to Alex, I just really didn't care all that much. In typical Sandler form, there is a girl and some weird conspiracy involved, but the whole thing wasn't even good enough for the man who starred in Jack & Jill, so to call it one of the funniest movies of all time, it isn't even close. It's evident to see what the writers were going for, but the fact of the matter is, that the characters just aren't that interesting, and the film isn't raunchy or slap-stick enough to be anything more than a passing memory.",1457481600,,1554,4.475352112676056

The characters are super hilarious and acted extremely well. Allen Covert is an underrated comic genius and love everything Linda Cardellini is in.  The rest of the cast are also super funny - Nick Swardson, Jonah Hill, Doris Roberts,Shirley Jones, Kevin Nealon, just to name a few, and Joel David Moore as the 'villain'.

There are so many unforgettable scenes in this movie.  The bathroom scene, shiloh, the party, and dance dance revolution.

I've read reviews from critics that say this movie is immature and not very funny and blah blah.  Honestly I wish there was more movies like this out there.  Not every movie has to strive to be a sensationalized masterpiece that changes our lives.  That's the problem with critics.  Their standards are out of wack.  Hollywood has thousands of generic movies out there so they can watch those if that's what they want.  If you want to just relax and have some laughs with your buds then pick this movie up!

I recently ordered Grandmas Boy through Prime video because both my fianc and I needed a funny movie to watch but couldn't think of one we hadnt seen a million times.  Im glad we rented this one, because its been years but this movie still holds up (and might just be funnier now).  There was some raunch in the movie, but in a fun way.  I wouldnt necessarily show this movie to a child, but its not over the top, in my opinion.  I did order the unrated edition and Im not sure what the difference was between the unrated version and the normal version, but overall the humor wasn't super offensive, just incredibly funny.

The older women in this movie really made it enjoyable.  They are so funny and likable!  Nick Swardson is also supremely funny in it.  If you have never seen this movie, but find yourself enjoying other Happy Madison productions then check this out.  If you like Broken Lizard or the Apatow movies, then you will most likely enjoy this as well!",1430784000,,1014,4.4324324324324325

I got to eat four long strands stuck to the colander I used to rinse the noodles and whatever sauce was smeared on the ladle.

I love the characters in this movie. I don't even play video games so I'm not as cool of a grandma as ""Grandma"" (Doris Roberts). But there is something totally transcendent about this movie.

It is not for  the easily offended however. I would never watch this movie with my octogenarian parents. They would not think it was funny.

I have been exposed to enough crude humor during my lifetime to have learned to appreciate the blue. Especially if the dirty has a heart made of warm hugs and candy.

""Grandma's Boy"" is a crude, dirty, hilarious, kind and precious film.

I recommend it.

P.S. The only thing that I did not love in this flick was the loud music ""J.P."" listens to in his office. But I would if I had robot ears.",1374969600,,894,4.381818181818182

There were a few moments of hilarity but by the last half hour I was ready for it to be over.
This movie might appeal to young teens, except there were a few extremely graphic sex scenes which would be inappropriate, not to mention the constant pot smoking.

I would have rated it four stars for the first hour, due to a couple of really funny lol scenes but it went steadily downhill into boredom.  Most of the movie was shots of a video game company and employees having fun in very adolescent ways.  The rest were shots of various stoned parties.  Which doesn't sound bad, except, it was.  The last half hour was downright tedious, as grandma learns to play video games, the pot dealer gets a crazy monkey, the twenty something video game enthusiast who lives like a five year old gets it on with a seventy year old woman, etc.

In short this is everything a young minded teenage boy might enjoy.  It started out very promising on the laugh front but devolved into monotony.",1344124800,,1193,4.313901345291479

in the real world.
For someone who went to VietNam and lived and got stoned through the 60's, 70's,

1564326,5,B00005JOSO,"""Grandma's Boy"" is all about Alex, a 35-year-old video game tester who finds himself needing a temporary place to stay when he is suddenly evicted due to a problem with his roommate and overdue rent. Alex tries to stay with friends, but this doesn't work out, and he soon finds himself moving in with his doting grandmother and her two friends, highly medicated Bea and bitter, promiscuous Grace. Balancing the world of his co-workers/friends (mostly twenty-something stoner gamers) and the much tamer, though just as strange world of his grandmother and her roommates is difficult for Alex at first, but he eventually finds they are able to mesh rather well. A little too well sometimes. Things aren't all wine and roses though, as one excluded co-worker with a massive ego and bizarre behavior has his sights set on the same upper-level beauty as Alex.

From the folks at Happy Madison (full of those Happy Madison familiar faces), the 2006 comedy ""Grandma's Boy"" is a hilarious (if constantly crude) comedy from start to finish. Yes, there is a lot of stoner humor in this film, but you don't have to be a stoner to enjoy it. At its heart is a story about a guy a lot of gen-Xers and post-gens can relate to quite well, just trying to find his place in a much more complicated world than ever before without settling for less than what he's passionate about. It's partly a romance, like most good movies, but for the most part, it's all about laughs and telling a great story that actually feels quite original in its simplicity. A lot of it just feels like you're hanging out with friends and having a great time! The cast is superb, with Happy Madison regular Allen Covert taking the lead for a change, supported by the outrageously funny Nick Swardson and Peter Dante, and even Jonah Hill in one of his first movie roles. Linda Cardellini is the girl of Alex's dreams, Samantha, brought in to make sure the newest video game is finished on time, and she is a perfect fit. And Doris Roberts stars as Grandma Lilly, who is the perfect loving grandma. Her two friends are played by Shirley Knight and Shirley Jones, and yes, Shirley Jones is a freak in this. Watching her get nasty these days is like watching Carrie Fisher in ""Fanboys"". You wonder, would you still make out with her? I mean, if I think about Shirley in ""Oklahoma"" hard enough, I just might. Man, she was an angel in that movie. Anywho, she's no angel here, but she is incredibly funny! Bottom line, ""Grandma's Boy"" is perfect if you're looking for a relaxing comedy to just laugh out loud at, and this movie has everything. Even a monkey! The way it's been heralded as a fantastic ""stoner flick"" is kind of underestimating it, in my opinion. I'd just say it's a fantastic comedy for gen-X and younger (adults only, of course), sort of like a Kevin Smith comedy, like ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"", but more Happy Madison-ish, if that makes sense. Oh, and did I forget to mention Joel Moore as the villainous weirdo, J.P.? That guy is a riot in this flick! Do yourself a favor and check this underrated (now a cult favorite) film out! It really annoys me how some real gems like this one and ""Hot Rod"" go unnoticed in theaters and not quite as funny flicks like ""Superbad"" and ""The Hangover"" get so much praise. Though, I have to admit, I think Grandma's Boy and Hot Rod got a lot less promotion, as I recall. I always thought it went direct to video.

The DVD for ""Grandma's Boy"" is widescreen with the option of an unrated version, and it's well stocked with bonus features too! You get a director commentary AND a three-actor commentary (always enjoy group actor commentaries!), plus lots of deleted and alternate stuff, a music video, behind the scenes material (even on the music video), and, of course, the film's trailer. It really is a fantastic buy that I highly recommend!",1278547200,2,3855,4.601744186046512

It is one of the funnier movies that I have seen in the past decade. I have watched it about 20 or so times and had to own it. I own the unrated version, but have yet to watch it. I can only imagine.

My personal favorite in this movie is Shirley Jones(of the Partridge Family fame)playing the role of an 60-plus whore. This film is perfect for any fan of crazy teen sex comedy films, but take note, Grandma's Boy is not suitable for young viewers!",1256860800,,480,4.658823529411765
1564380,3,B00005JOSO,"A movie you don't want to like ends up becoming the movie you recommend to all of your friends. Such is the case with Grandma's Boy.

Boy stars Allen Covert in the title role. You may recognize him from Adam Sandler's films, like The Wedding Singer, where he plays Sammy, the friend who wears the Michael Jackson-esque outfits and drives a limousine, or 50 First Dates, where he plays ""Ten Second Tom,"" the dude who gives a whole new meaning to the term ""short-term memory,"" to name a couple.

Anyway, Boy is the story of man-child Alex, a 35 year-old man who holds a career as a video game tester. Hijinks ensue when Alex is forced to move in with his loving grandmother, Lilly, (Doris Roberts - Everybody Loves Raymond), and her two roommates. ""Silver Fox"" Grace (Shirley Jones) has the libido of a 20 year-old, while Bea (Shirley Knight) is over-medicated to the point of Terret's Syndrome.

Alex, of course, does not want to admit that he lives with his grandmother, so he tells all of his friends and co-workers, including sexy new boss, Samantha (Linda Cardellini), that ""three hot babes"" live with him. The real fun begins when it is revealed just who these ""three hot babes"" truly are.

Even a stoner flick has to have conflict if it hopes to mimic some semblance of plot, and that's where rival co-worker J.P. (Joel Moore) comes in.  J.P. has some some serious identity issues (read as: he thinks he's a robot), and he is always working against Alex to try and present that next new idea before Alex, or anyone else, can.  But now Alex has a plan up his sleeve to expose J.P. as the psycho he truly is (not that he needs much help in that department).

If you like stoner humor that consists of, among other things, karate-chopping chimps, men who talk like robots, pop culture references, drunken karaoke, unfortunate incidents with Lara Croft dolls, and sexual innuendo galore, then you too could be Grandma's Boy - well, depending on how liberal your grandma is, of course.",1255392000,,1985,4.638176638176638

This movie is funny, beginning to end. Nick Swardson, however, steals the show as best friend of Allen Covert (aka The Grey Bush). His line deliveries are subtle, unexpected and hilarious. Hell, if this movie was a minute and a half long and ONLY featured the scene of Linda Cardellini singing and dancing to Salt N Peppa's ""Push It"" it would STILL be worth buying.

1564386,4,B00005JOSO,"Synopsis:  Alex (played by Allen Covert) is a cannabis-loving video game tester in his mid-30s who unexpectedly finds himself homeless after his roommate spent their rent money on prostitutes.  After attending a family function, his grandmother (played by Doris Roberts) invites him to stay with her and her roommates: the sexually provocative Grace (Shirley Jones) and the over-medicated Bea (Shirley Knight).  Alex works at Brainasium, where he acts as a mentor and hero for his subordinates (who include Nick Swardson as Jeff and Jonah Hill as Barry), a go-to-guy and possible love interest for his superior Samantha (Linda Cardellini), and as an antagonist to video game designer J.P. (Joel David Moore).  How will everyone react when they find out he lives with his grandmother?
Peter Dante appears as Dante the Cannabis supplier while Kevin Nealon appears as Mr. Cheezle, the nu-age hippie head of Brainasium.

Now, anyone who's checking this movie out to see an Oscar-worthy performance is looking for the wrong film.  This movie is chock full of crude humor and utterly ridiculous moments.  The film doesn't pay much attention to particular details as it just has a general story for the viewer to follow.  That may have had something to do with why it wasn't a critical success.

However, once it went to DVD, people started to realize just how funny the film really is.  There's so many great comedic scenarios that when I saw the movie for the first time, I was laughing hard at the nonsense these guys got themselves into.  This has been the first comedy movie in a while that's gotten that reaction out of me.  There's so many one-liners in the film that after my buddies and I saw it, we had plenty of in-jokes with each other that were related to the film.

I purchased it on DVD and considering the price Amazon is currently selling it for ($9.49 as of this post), I really can't think of a reason not to get it.  Highly recommended for the 18-25 crowd that likes to party and for the 26-40something-and-beyond crowd that still knows how to have a good time.",1240012800,,2074,4.78932584269663

1564428,4,B00005JOSO,"I don't expect most modern comedies to be very funny.  They're rude, crude, obnoxious...and not funny.  SUPERBAD was super bad.  I remember a time when people actually looked forward to movies with Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell (or the by-gone days when people looked forward to Eddie Murphy or Steve Martin movies).  And I still don't get how the Broken Lizard troupe gets money for their films.

So I was extremely skeptical when I heard about GRANDMA'S BOY.  After all, it comes from Adam Sandler's production company.  I'm just thankful he wasn't in it with some goofy mugging or annoying accent.

But GRANDMA'S BOY is funny.  Some parts are even laugh-out-loud funny.

The language is thoroughly vulgar and the drug use is unrepentantly rampant but I think those would be the only elements that might put off a mainstream audience.  I thought it added to the humor that the lead actor looked like Mel Gibson (how funny would that casting had been if Mel had taken that role?).

This movie is a great comedy, especially for those familiar with gaming or just know people who are gamers. Despite many reviews and ads that make this look like a ""pot smoker"" comedy, the main focus of this is video games, getting by when kicked out of your home and family relationships. The pot smoking is but a small piece of a bigger puzzle.

Well maybe the last part was a little bit out there. But if you liked the raunchy type of comedy with gross out laughs and clever quick one liners, then this movie is for you. This is defintly the new generations animal house, considering the rising climate of video games in the younger generations, this movie just fit perfectly. It's a shame this movie did horrible in theatres but it did develop a cult following once released on DVD. The pacing of the movie is steady and fast, never getting boring. But it does lag in the last 15-20 mins of the movie. I felt they didn't know how to end this properly but just threw together this ending anyways. I maybe harsh towards the ending but I laughed so hard the whole way through and the last mins of the movie seemed to lose its touch. Overall its defintly worth a rental for a get together with friends. I'm no critic but I know funny and this is defintly one funny movie.",1204761600,2,1081,4.4646464646464645

I'm talking about Allen Covert and Peter Dante who played the reckless and faithfull satanic heshins - they stole every scene they were in. When I saw the trailer for Grandmas Boy I was like awesome! A whole movie with these two. Sadly, though Dante isn't in it as much as the trailer made it out but that's my only quibble. But when he is on screen he's F***in hilarious. The movie stars Allen Covert as a videogame programmer who's just been evicted from his house. He initially trys to stay with his buddy played by the hilarious and quick-witted Nick Swardsen. But must leave due to getting caught masterbating by Swardsen's roomate. This scene is one of the funniest bits I've ever seen in a comedy, lately. It really pushes the boundaries of decency and thank god. It's hard to top this bit but the movie stays consistent in deliverying the funny. In a last ditch effort Covert must room with his grandma. From this point on you get copius amounts of weed smokin, sex with the elderly, depictions of pill-addled and blissed out senior citizens, a pot smoking African Chief, gratutious breast sucking, a monkey trained in karate; who can also drive and the hottest and uncomfortable striptease by televisions ER star Linda Cardellini.

It just wasn't all that funny collectively.  The plot didn't really happen until 15 minutes until the movie ended.  Then it seemed like the director thought he should end the movie with some sort of competition and victory.  Very poorly written.  The characters were interesting.  A guy who lives with his Grandma, a has-been-matrix-wanna-be, and the grandma herself.  It could've been much better.  A 30+ guy living with his grandma is funny in concept.  But, not in this movie.

1564869,2,B00005JOSO,"I didn't think Grandma's Boy was that good.  The movie tried to pull off comedy, but most of the time it was just lame jokes and gags that weren't really memorable.  It was almost like a party comedy.  A bunch of young work friends throw parties, get drunk and laugh together.  This doesn't amount to much, in the end.  It's a trick to make up for weak writing.

One of the worst things about the movie was that one annoying guy who worked with the other video game testers.  He apparently had problems ""upstairs"" and had a split personality.  Throughout the movie he kept talking to himself and answering his own questions in another voice.  I didn't care for this character.

There were also a few unnecessary sex jokes, such as the one guy spending the night at a friends house and decided he felt like ""doing his thing"" beside the toilet in the bathroom, only for his friends mom to walk in and for him to turn around and... you can finish this sentence.  Not to mention that one party scene where one of the friends couldn't remove his face from a hot womans breasts.  This isn't very funny.

The old ladies that the one video game tester moved in with (one of them being his grandmother) were the only characters that supplied any kind of humor.  The one scene of the grandmother scaring his grandson by pretending to be a ghost under a bed was hysterical.

However, at the end of the film when that annoying guy I mention above has a video game competition with the grandmother, the writers made almost no effort whatsoever to make it exciting.  This was a very disappointing scene and it was supposed to be the part that finished off the main storyline, which means, it *should* have been memorable.

If the movie focused more on the grandmother and her friends, and less on the video game employee friends, it would have been funnier.  Not to mention a more interesting story should have been included.  As it stands, it's average.",1169942400,,1940,4.522988505747127

Nicholaus Goossen  Rated R

Alex (Allen Covert) is a 35 year old video game tester who is forced out of his apartment and forced to live with his grandma and her two roommates. While he works on testing the game his company is working on, called Eternal Death Slayer 3 he is secretly making his own game while at home. One day before he moves in with his grandma, he sleeps at the office where he works at and he meets a girl there from New York. She is there to make sure that Eternal Death Slayer 3 is finished on time. Her name is Samantha and Alex starts to like her and they fall in love. The maker of the games name is JP (Joel Moore). He is a geek and has a second personality where he thinks he is a robot. Most people who work for him hate him because he is mean and tricky. Lilly (Doris Roberts) is Alex's grandma one day she begins playing the game Alex made and she likes it and plays it everyday she is the only one who knows about it besides him and she begins to get good at it. Then one day JP pretends to want to be friends with Alex and steals his video game. Alex has no way to get it back and JP is going to release it and make money from it. Alex flips out and now he's going to get fired unless they figure out if it is his game. Alex's only proof is his grandma and she is going to have to beat JP in the game or Alex is fired.

I thought the movie was great especially if you like funny movies. Its funny and most teenagers and adults would like it.

1564874,3,B00005JOSO,"At 35 years old, Alex (Allen Covert) tests video games for Brainasium, the company behind the wildly popular game ""Eternal Death Slayer"". When he discovers his roommate Josh (Jonathan Loughran) hasn't paid the rent for the last six months because he used the money on Filipino hookers, he finds himself going from place to place to find his ideal crashing ground. But the last place he'd wind up staying would be with his Grandma Lily (Doris Roberts), the only one who gives him a place to stay in exchange for doing chores around the house. Lily shares her home with two friends, Bea (Shirley Knight) and Grace (Shirley Jones), who keep Alex busy nearly every night. As soon as Alex's co-workers find out, they don't know the real story. Meanwhile, Alex is trying to charm Brainasium's beautiful new executive Samantha (Linda Cardellini) while dealing with the firm's space-case CEO Cheezle (Kevil Nealon) and J.P. (Joel David Moore), a teenage game designer who dresses up like Neo from ""The Matrix"" and speaks often with a robot tone.

If there's one thing I learned from Adam Sandler, it's that the movies he produces and doesn't star in don't turn out to be as good as HIS movies. Stinkers like ""Joe Dirt"" and the last ""Deuce Bigalow"" (look for a reference in this movie) come to mind. As far as I'm concerned, his latest effort from the Happy Madison camp, ""Grandma's Boy,"" has a few redeeming parts. But with a better director (Frank Coraci or Peter Segal), this could've been a laugh-a-minute rival to last summer's gross-out comedies.

But inside all this craziness, there's some good things to lampoon. One of them is the video game industry, where many of the guys play video games like ""Dance Dance Revolution"" (watch this movie for the scene alone) or whatever. However, director Nicholaus Goossen (Allen Covert's assistant on ""Eight Crazy Nights"") sadly shifts the action away to some unfunny points, like Alex pleasuring himself to a Lara Croft doll or anytime Joel David Moore is on screen (the robot voice isn't really that clever to begin with). And Adam Sandler should know better, after producing good movies like the most recent remake of ""The Longest Yard.""

There are some good actors in this movie who are game. Shifted into focus for the first time, Covert somehow seems bored out of his mind when delivering several of his lines and, as I said before, Moore is a one-note joke. But Sandler finds his niche with his other co-stars, such as Nick Swardson (a stand-up comic from Comedy Central) as Alex's often buddy. And Linda Cardellini scores when she drunkenly performs Salt-N-Pepa's ""Push It"" - she's easily above this juvenile material, along with senior actresses Doris Roberts (still funny even after ""Everybody Loves Raymond""), and Shirleys Knight and Jones. Sadly, cameos from David Spade (as a fruity waiter) and Rob Schneider (as Alex's tenant) are wasted.

But there are hosts of other good performances. Loughran could've used more screen time, as with what he's got to work with, he could've easily taken this show to new heights. And leave it to Peter Dante to chew up the scenery whenever he mentions about different types of weed. If only Peter Segal directed this movie, the jokes could've taken off, because Goossen doesn't have the imagination and handling of comic timing for this to happen.

But, regardless, this still is a funny movie.",1164412800,2,3383,4.886759581881533

He swore it would cheer me up, and not only did it do just that, but I never expected to laugh so hard. An Adam Sandler production (though he himself does not appear in the movie, everyone else you've grown to love from all the Sandler movies is here in good form), Grandma's Boy was so funny that I actually laughed so hard I began to cry. It does have moments of predictability in it, but hey, this is one of those kick-back and watch something funny movies. It's about a guy named Alex who's roommate has been spending their rent at a local ""massage"" parlor, unknown to Alex until the landlord (Rob Schneider, hilariously) evicts them for not paying rent. Alex has nowhere to go, and of course, this is where everything starts to get increasingly amusing. He winds up having to take his grandmother up on her offer to live with her and her 2 roommates. The grandmother is played by the woman who plays Raymond's mom on ""Everyone Loves Raymond"" (forgive me, I can't think of her name) and although I despise that show, she was absolutely fantastic in this. Along with having to live with his grandmother, Alex is a 36 year old video game tester who is creating his own game on the side. Typically, a pretty coworker is introduced to oversee the changes on a current game the company is developing. Alex isn't the only one with a thing for her. J.P., a bizarre programmer known for developing one of the most popular video games around, takes a liking to her too. And he also takes Alex's game and claims it to be his own. But will everything work out for Alex? Ah, I bet you can guess (as I easilly did) but Grandma's Boy is absolutely freaking hilarious. If you enjoy Sandler's movie productions, and you enjoy smoking pot (or at least laughing on the same levels as potheads do) then you will just love this movie.

1564941,2,B00005JOSO,"Maybe if I'd been stoned the movie would have been funnier?

Stoners just aren't that funny to me in my 30's. A 30-something stoner who tests video games for a living isn't either, especially when he's lazy, rude and raunchy. The premise that such an individual might also develop a rockin' video game in his free time is a stretch, but that's the thin plot of the movie. People just don't get all creative and inspired to work on programming code while they're stoned. Trust me.

The crude humor was a little too over the top. I don't really want to see a fat kid sucking on a stripper's giant silicone implants repeatedly.

Some of the characters managed to be funny some of the time. Being an ultra-nerd can have humorous moments. I wanted to like the game development team at Brainium, the made up software company featured in the movie. This movie could have been so much better though. Fart scenes, raunchy sex and stoners have been overplayed in Hollywood and all these guys were too predictable.

One scene that did make me laugh out loud was the ""dance"" competition with Dance, Dance, Revolution. The furious video gaming competition between the nerds was good throughout, but most of the rest of the attempts at humor were either too crude or raunchy to be very enjoyable.",1155772800,4,1282,4.65929203539823

Anyway, the movie is still fun as hell to watch. And the three old ladies are absolutely adorable, especially when they're baked on the weed-tea.

Did anyone else notice that the game Alex was designing was a little re-vamp of the alpha stages of the Predator Concrete Jungle game?

Anyway, I thought this movie was funny as hell. A note to aspiring testers who may be watching this movie: don't take the exagerrated portrayance of testers seriously. It's a fun job, but trust me - it's still work - long, mind-numbing work (which is where the weed REALLY helps, actually)",1154649600,6,940,4.485380116959064

1565014,1,B00005JOSO,"This movie could have used Adam Sandler.

This is a big statement coming from me. Sandler seems like a nice guy, but his movies, with the exception of a few, have steadfastedly refused to amuse me. Happy Gilmore is his absolute peak: funny situations, good jokes, good comedic actors working together to be funny. Sandler is at his best, throwing out one-liners and hilarious jokes that absolutely refuse to become unfunny. It's his high point as a comedian. Besides certain points of Billy Madison and parts of The Wedding Singer, he's worthless. Everything else has been either stupid (Little Nicky, or whatever that movie was called, The Waterboy) or sappy (Big Daddy, 50 First Dates). He's funny if he has good material, but he rarely ever gets it.

Why is it so important that I write this long thesis on Adam Sandler? I want to illustrate to the reader of this review how momentous of an occasion it is when I say the following: THIS MOVIE NEEDED ADAM SANDLER.

Made by the same production company or whatever that has made his last several movies, it differs in his last few movies in that he plays no role in this movie. And this hurts. Fans of his movies will recognize most of the cast: many of them have been in his movies for a long time. The supporting cast, basically. It's almost like Adam said ""you know what guys, you've been such a good supporting cast in my career, how about you make a movie where YOU'RE THE STARS? I'll sit this one out.""

This movie makes me realize how much I've underestimated Sandler as a comedian. I always thought he was stupid, crude, and much too blunt. However, I was proven wrong. Sandler is absolutely subtle and complex when compared to this crap. This is seriously the worst comedy I've ever seen. It is the epitome of bad comedy writing. I counted 3 things in the movie that made me smile, but then frown when they were undeveloped. I'm sorry if I can't remember any of them: they're all drowned in the sea of crap that is the rest of the movie. This was a poorly plotted, poorly paced, poorly acted, and poorly written movie. There is no plot until the very end: an hour and a half is spent on character development. The movie is almost over when the main character reveals he was once an accountant. What?! He just opines this at the very end to his boss, and it changes absolutely nothing in the movie. The characters are all painfully shallow caricatures. This makes the ""climax"" of the movie completely unimpressive: the entirely unfunny character of the main bad guy (can't remember his name, ain't trying to find out) steals the lead characters game, claiming it as his own. Finally, drama. It's resolved in five minutes: grandma comes in, plays the game, bam, that's it end of movie. The hour and a half before this is spent wallowing in ridiculousness. He lives with his grandma: they watch the Antique Show, and he can't beta test his game. GET IT?! He comes home late, gets high, and cooks some food. He removes the tray from the oven without gloves, badly burning his hands, being unable to beta test his game. GET IT?! (I don't get how this is supposed to be his grandma's fault, but whatever.) His grandma finds some ""tea"" in his pot stash, and drinks it with her friends. They get high. GET IT?! Doris Roberts tries really hard to make her grandma role amusing, but really this is just Everybody Loves Raymond without jokes. At least Everybody Loves Raymond has real jokes, written by a real comedian. Sure, they're often lame and unfunny, but hey, I've laughed at that show. I didn't laugh once in this movie.

This movie is everything that's wrong with comedy now. I can't even express it adaquetly in words how much this movie offended me. Even with Adam Sandler this movie would have sucked: the jokes are simply not there. Sure, Sandler could have gotten some laughs with his delivery (which has always been his strongest point: the ""comedians"" in this movie have all the comedic delivery of a rock). But nothing could save this movie at all from being the worst comedy I've ever seen, hands down. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. .",1151452800,3,4092,4.584699453551913
1565015,5,B00005JOSO,"It's rare that I give a comedy five stars, but ""Grandma's Boy"" is perfect.  Comedic timing, a brief romantic angle, wonderfully silly acting and a fun plot make this one of the most perfect comedies I've ever seen. Allen Covert plays Alex, a recently homeless video game tester who's just looking for a break.  He visits his local weed dealer, played tightly by Peter Dante, to see if he can stay at his house for awhile.  Alex has second thoughts about staying there when he finds out that Dante's African tribesman buddy, Dr. Shokalu, has acquired an actual lion to protect the stash.  His next attempt at bedding down is with his game-testing buddy, played with stereotypical geek charm by Nick Swardson.  His sleepover experience at Swardson's home reveals that Swardson still lives with his parents, has a lot of toys, and a really cool car bed.  It also leads up to the first really funny (and really wrong) confrontation involving Covert and one of Swardson's family members.  From there, Covert ends up staying with his grandma, Doris Roberts, who is basically playing a role similar to that of hers in ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" but with a whole lot more edge.  She and her two roommates, Shirley Knight and Shirley Jones (Partridge Family), welcome Covert into their home with open arms.  The result is an all out pot party, geriatric sex, geeks fulfilling their wildest dreams, a kung-fu chimp, dance dance revolution challenges, vegetarian humor, a game programming scandal and a ton of other things that just don't belong together but somehow work here.

There is also a romantic angle to the story involving the cute Linda Cardellini (Freaks and Geeks, the Scooby movies).  ""Grandma's Boy"" takes care to not drag the comedy down with the love story as I've seen in countless other comedies these days.  Cardellini plays Covert's new supervisor, and they become close friends as the story rolls along.  Even she manages to become part of the lunacy when she takes the boys out one evening.

A number of SNL alumni are in this flick.  Rob Schneider makes a brief appearance as Covert's landlord.  Kevin Nealon plays the holistic owner of the game company Covert works for.  The scene stealer, however, is David Spade as Shiloh, a sexually-questionable waiter at a vegetarian restuarant who takes on Covert and his buddies while they're celebrating the completion of game-testing.  The only SNL omission is Adam Sandler, who's Happy Madison company produced this flick.  However, it's obvious that he put his stamp on this movie.  It features the same stable of actors that are featured in almost every other Sandler flick out there.

This movie is wrong in so many ways, but that's what makes it fun.  The really amazing thing is that all of it is pulled off with little or no actual offense to those who are made fun of, and that's an amazing feat these days.  If you love dirty comedies like ""The 40 year-old Virgin,"" ""There's Something About Mary,"" and ""Wedding Crashers,"" you're sure to love this flick.

Gramma's Boy is a movie for the ages. When I say movie for the ages I don't mean that it will stand the test of time or give Shakespear a run for his money. What I mean is many uneducated men and women are returniong home in thier 20's and 30's and living with thier parents. That is one of the reasons I enjoyed this movie. I am 29 and have lived at home for about 2 years now. Some of you might laugh at the thought of moving back in with a parental unit. That is exactly why you should see this movie. It's about a video game playtester who's roomate spent the rent money on hookers. Rather than be homeless or live with his friends, whom all seem to live with thier parents also, he moves in with Gramma. Not only does this guy smoke pot, he has one of the most bizzare drug dealers in the history of drug dealers. As seen in the scene when his dealer gets a lion to protect his stash. If you like video games or illicit substances, you'll love this movie. If you like both you'll absolutely love this movie! Gramma's Boy weirdly doubles as a date movie. So if you and your girl chief together, watch it while you do. For all you non-smokers/non-videogammers, steer clear of this one.

The funny thing about this movie is seem so common in its delivery, like a midnight cult movie flick. The story about a Computer Programer (Allen Covert) who has to find a new place to live after being kicked out of his old place. He finds a place, he stays  with his Grandmother (Emmy winner from Everyone Loves Raymond's Doris Roberts who character here take her away from  Raymond Character) and her two house  mates the over medicated (Tony Winner Shirley Knight-who takes her flower child gone wrong to the Nth degree) and the oversexed (Oscar winner Shirley Jones..and you will never see Mrs Partridge from the Partridge Family in the same light again!). All three senior actresses  milk their parts fully and makes this work. You see why they won their acting awards and this is a showcase for their acting here

The  weird other programers in the cast including the lovely Linda Cardellini (from ER) highlight and bring different directions to Covert's Alex character. It works and is funny. The banter of everything from drug humor, sex jokes, nerd jokes and trek-this alone make this a cultist film.

There is great cameos by  David Spade,  Rob Scheider and Kevin Nealon (worth it for the film alone)..DONT MISS THEM! I wish Adam Sandler whpo produced this film would have had a cameo~well there is always the sequel!

Also this film is LOADED with EXTRAS for the film buff. It  has two commentary  tracks  (one with actors , other from the director). deleted scenes, partly filmed deleted scenes, music videos and a few documentaries (including one that was done for Fox Movie Channel)

With the cult movies gone from the theaters and the Drive INs almost vanished, this film is one you can pop in your DVD player and enjoy. It isn't great art nor great cinema--its just bad jokes, bad taste, crude humor and a good time.

 Have a mini DVD film festival using This film, Rocky Horror and Showgirls...Its a MIDNIGHT guilty pleasure-open a can of BUD, smoke a JOINT AND ENJOY YOURSELF

Allen Covert (who also co-wrote and produced) stars as a 35 year old video game tester working on a hit new game, and in his spare time he is secretly designing his own game while smoking a lot of marijuana.  When he gets kicked out of his house, he ends up living with his grandmother (Doris Roberts) and her two room mates (Shirley Knight and Shirley Jones) while dealing with his best friend (Nick Swardson), his ultra tan dealer (Peter Dante), his super hot new boss (the ultra hot Linda Cardellini), and some other weirdos as well.  Despite it's predictable plot and gags, Grandma's Boy works mainly because of it's stars and the blast they're having filming it.  Covert, Swardson, and Dante (all of which had a hand in either writing or producing the film) are quite funny in their roles, with Swardson stealing the show as a granny loving master of Dance Dance Revolution that still lives with his parents and sleeps in a race car bed.  Frequently funny and enjoyable throughout, Grandma's Boy is a surprising stoner comedy that is better than one might think, and it's certainly better than anything that Adam Sandler himself has headlined in the past few years.

This movie ( I don't think ) was in theaters, and if it was, it didn't get very much attention; and it should have. Dante in this movie is hilarious ( the weed seller ) and really, the movie as a whole is hilarious. The only real problem with the movie who plays ""The Robot"". He continuously makes stupid buzzing sounds and has ""two sides"", one normal, and the other that he does when he is nervous. That really drags down the story to me.

This is a great movie and fans of any film like Cheech and Chong's movies, Don't Me A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood, Harold and Kumar Goto White Castle... and so on.

1565084,4,B00005JOSO,"Juvenile, unsophisticated, hilarious. This movie was slammed by critics, but screw them. This movie isn't made for people like that. It's for people like us: young, stoned, and enthusiastic about beating Halo on Legendary mode. It's got it's ups and downs, but overall, it's very, very funny. And unlike most recent comedies, which lose steam towards the end, this one actually gets funnier as it goes along. Best enjoyed with a group of like-minded friends and copious amounts of ganja.",1148428800,4,487,5.1
1565085,5,B00005JOSO,"Allen Covert, who we all know from his character parts in numerous Adam Sandler movies, stars in this film. The movie definitely has a familiar Sandler-type feeling to it, but I thought it worked well with the given cast.

It all starts out with a hilarious scene where Alex (Covert) is being evicted from his place while playing video games. It turns out his roommate has acquired a penchant for Filipino hookers and he's spent all the rent money on his addiction. It sounds pretty weak, but it's a great scene and it's really well done.

A good number of actors make guest appearances. Rob Schneider is the Middle-Eastern landlord, David Spade is a feminine waiter at a health food restaurant, Kevin Nealon is an overly spiritual boss, the kid from Dodgeball (Joel Moore) plays a video game designing genius who has a robot as part of his dual personality, the mother from Everybody Loves Raymond plays Alex's grandmother... Nick Swardson (who is a professional stand-up comic) is hilarious in his role as Alex's best friend at work. He really adds to the movie with his personality and one-liner delivery.

There are some really good lines in this movie, as well as some strikingly funny scenes. I found myself laughing out loud more than a few times. If you liked early Sandler movies, you will definitely appreciate this kind of humor. The Unrated version is raunchy and even better than I was expecting it to be. There is also a good deal of bonus material, including some featurettes and deleted scenes.",1148342400,77,1510,4.777777777777778

Another thing that really bugs me is that the monkey only comes in for the final 15 minutes.  I thought he'd be in it the whole time.  Not at all.  They bill it like he's hanging out the whole time.  I have no idea what the Unrated deal is all about.  There is nothing very over the top.  The pastry scene in Van Wilder is 100 times crazier than anything here.  Seriously minimal nudity.  Only 1 chick!  This is all marketing and not enough humor.  Nice try, but it just didn't do it for me.",1148256000,2,615,4.025

Low to high brow. But this wasn't comedy. It wasn't even a movie. You can't just string a series of a poorly-delivered lines, pointless scenes, and generic gags together with ""celebrity"" cameos, and expect people to pay money to see it... Okay, I just read what I wrote and, please, please, understand, words cannot express how bad and unfunny this masturbatory pile committed to celluloid is. Seriously, if you want a lobotomy, go to a neurosurgeon. It takes longer, but at least they're funnier. But again, I don't want to bash the film. I want to ask anyone who has seen this movie, or is considering seeing it, to stop and reconsider what you truly think is funny. This is not it. You're being lied to by Adam Sandler. He thinks you're all idiots, and he and his crew can throw up into a camera, and you'll all think it's hilarious. Stop wasting your money, and please, somebody stop greenlighting movies for the lowest-common denomenator.

If you like video games, chicks, pot jokes, and a bunch of crazy guys who like to make the most of life, you will love this movie.  I can't say enough about this movie.

1565207,3,B00005JOSO,"This was a silly stoner movie, with several hysterical scenes and enough good laughs that I don't regret seeing it.  Hearing some of the reviews, I expected it to be much worse.  Almost lovingly mocking the geek culture, this movie will probably be best enjoyed by geeks and stoners, or people who don't mind humor designed for them.

If you've seen other Happy Madison productions, you know what to expect, sex jokes, drunk/high escapades, lots and lots of swearing.  The plot is thin and really, not the point.  The ""villian"" is a super-nerd, one so geeky even the software testers make fun of him (behind his back).  Kevin Nealon does a small role similar to his zen golfer in Happy Gilmore, David Spade cameos as a gay waiter in a vegan restaurant and Rob Schneider has a scene as the landlord who throws the main character out.  You'll recognize plenty of other Happy Madison alum through out.

In the extras, brief vignettes about the ""bathroom scene"" and the monkey are funny and appropriately short.  I also watched the deleted scenes, which had a few laughs. I didn't check out any other extras, but enjoyed those.

I won't buy this movie, but I will definitely watch it if it's on HBO, and I'll recommend it to my friends who aren't easily offended.",1147046400,6,1259,4.656108597285068

The commercials didn't prepare me for the 2+ hours of entertainment. I was hooked from the moment I heard the Galaga theme and giggled every time I saw a the fake game posters in the background. But if stoner jokes and pornography are more your style, the film lacks none of the above. The whole reason this little adventure started was because of Filipino hookers and, of course, the hilarious scene where the three Grandma's have accidently drank pot. But it was all the video game references that really pulled me in.

1565213,3,B00005JOSO,"Surprisingly well written, this is another atempt my main stream media to make dope smoking part of the normal culture.

The plot of the movie is thin.  Guy gets kicked out of his apartment since his stoner roomate spent all their rent money on hookers.  Guy is now forced to move in with his Grandma.

Weak at best but it makes for an interesting idea.  It would have been more plausable if they used the idea from Failure to Launch but you can't have everything.

Sure their are plenty of laughs but parts of the movie just don't work.  after all the main character is spending a lot of money on drugs , pot.  Yet the amount of money spent on drugs is never brought up.  In deed the reason the guy can not get a new apartment is because he can not aford a new apartment, yet he can afford his drug habit.

To complicate matters our hero is a video game tester.  Supposedly one of the best and oldest in the business.  But he does not come across as a gamer.  When he gives hints on past games or is descring one our hero sounds fake and passionateless.

Instead of believing him you feel that he is mocking the sub culture that he is suposed to be a part of.

Even with this the movie does shine.  This is done by one hell of a supporting cast.  From the Grandma bunch to the Geek crew you have a wonderful mix of pranksters and vetrans.  As such even though the plot is thread bare and the hero lack luster you still  have a good movie and a fun time.",1144627200,4,1454,4.128571428571429

7941605,5,B00005JOSO,"Grandma's Boy is stoner humor of the best kind.  And knowing that's what it is, you can have a great time if you go into it with that level of expectation.  This is an Adam Sandler production and it shows in the sophomoric, body and stoner-based humor that pervades this film from start to finish.  But it IS funny, again, if you are a fan of this type of humor.  If you like movies like Old School, Anchorman, Up in Smoke, or Half Baked you'll like Grandma's Boy too.

The special features are, unfortunately, not all that special.  The deleted/unused scenes get parceled out over several different headings and even get repeated from one to the other.  There's a montage of all the pot-smoking that goes on in the movie as well as a music video and an accompanying making of featurette.  There's a casting call show that is interesting, but too short to really be informative beyond how excited they were to get Doris Roberts to play the titular Grandma.  Finally there are two different commentary tracks, one with the director and the other with several of the actors.

I would easily recommend this film to fans of the genre, and at the current price it's a bargain.",1526342400,,1171,4.559808612440191
