4961464,5,B0065SNNAU,"I'm a big fan of Asian movies, especially Korean series.  Also, I love period-genre types of movies, which is what this drama is about.  And with many of the Indian/Korean movies that I have purchased in the past, there is often-times a problem w/some of the disk.  That is not the case here, and I have no hesitation in recommending this product and vendor.",1368144000,4,358,4.5625

4961467,4,B0065SNNAU,"This drama is amazing and one of my favorites.  So glad to have it on DVD now and not have to rely on streaming.  The DVDs were of really nice quality, but in some parts the subtitles were rather fast or not as clear (meaning-wise) as they could have been.  Still, I'm very happy with my purchase!",1430092800,,297,4.175438596491228

4961469,5,B0065SNNAU,"Romance, political intrigue, humor and much more, the story is set in Sungkyunkwan University during the late 18th century.  Armed with a wonderful cast, and perfectly researched costumes and sets, the story unfolds in a heartwarming and uplifting manner.  Definitely worth the watch and adding to your collection.  Korean Drama at its finest!  Picture quality is great and so are the English subtitles.",1417305600,,403,5.349206349206349
4961470,5,B0065SNNAU,"This is a wonderful fun film.  The character development is well done and the chemistry among the actors is terrific.  I have only two objections to these DVDs and it has nothing to do with the series.  There is an ad at the beginning of every DVD along with a promo of other series.  In addition the ad repeats at the beginning when you finally get to the start of the series.  This is just nuisance since you can't fast forward through the initial add and promo.  My only other objection was the English subtitles.  For the most part they're okay, but there is a lot of typos and at times the tramslation runs slower than the dialogue taking place.

Despite all that - this film is a keeper!",1409702400,7,693,4.317829457364341
4961471,5,B0065SNNAU,"The second movie I saw Park Yoo Chun in and the first movie I saw Song Joong Ki in and fell in love with both of them. This K-drama is very funny, especially the scenes with SJK -- he steals the series. Highly recommended.",1409184000,,222,4.068181818181818
4961472,5,B0065SNNAU,One of my favorite fun Korean Dramas. Very enjoyable!,1408924800,,53,5.0
4961473,4,B0065SNNAU,"I really enjoyed this K-drama series.  It was well written, the characters well formed, and well acted.  Even the negative characters had their interesting points.  The story was very compelling, but the main attraction was the interactions between the characters.  A great watch!  I looked forward to each episode.",1405468800,2,315,5.346938775510204

8493569,5,B0065SNNAU,"Great story line. The beginning is sometimes a ""spoof', but then the story line gets serious. The acting is excellent and so are the English sub-titles
. I really enjoyed watching it and would recommend it.",1509580800,,206,4.75
8493570,5,B0065SNNAU,Arrived in a timely fashion and in good condition.  This is my very favorite Korean TV Drama and am pleased to be able to buy it.,1481328000,,129,3.9615384615384617
8493571,5,B0065SNNAU,"Please note that Park Yoo-chun is also called Micky"" (Yoo-chun) Park, with Micky being his nickname.  'Yoo-chun' has proven himself to be one of the Top-2 actors in S. Korea.  He was once part of K-group, TVXQ, until breaking away (along with two other members) and these three forming their own group, ""JYJ!"" I believe 'JYJ' also is on the OST of ""Sungkyunkwan Scandal.""  This KDrama stars the impeccable and utterly believable 'Micky' Yoo-chun Park, in his award-winning acting debut, in the role of ""Lee Sun-joon."" He has working along side him a perfect cast:  the charismatic Song Joong-ki, as rich playboy, ""Goo Yong-ha""; the compelling and intense actor, Yoo Ah-in, as vigilante, ""Moon Jae-shin; the lovely and talented actress, Park Min-young, as ""Kim Yoon-hee,""  This is a gender-bender story that takes place in the Joseon-era, with ""Kim Yoon-hee,"" after locking horns with ""Lee Sun-joon,"" unexpectedly finds herself in Sungkyunkwan taking entrance exams and talking with the King (actor Jo Sung-ha) about her answers..Together, he/she and LSJ are the top 2 scholars that make the grade. When these 4 eventually find themselves (for varying reasons) on the same side of the coin, with their intelligence, untouchable good looks, and charisma, they become known as the Joseon (F)4 by all the women far and wide... There's lots of humor, drama and intrigue, and let me mention--complicated love and friendships. This Drama attempts to answer whether love and friendship hold up when political and romantic rivalries spill over and secrets are revealed.  This series, ""Sungkyunkwan Scandal,"" is absolutely a,... 'don't miss!'",1475107200,,1632,5.281853281853282
8493572,1,B0065SNNAU,"This DVD has several advertisments that I must watch befor each of the episodes begin to play. There is no way to advance past the advertisments.  ...I paid for the DVD, I should not have to watch ads for products I can't even buy if I wanted to.  Very very disapointed.  No more purchases from Asian Mall !!!  The show is disapointingly poor also.",1473206400,,348,4.390625
8493573,5,B0065SNNAU,"This is the 20th K-Drama I've seen to date (I'm keeping track with a list), and this particular one is one of my TOPmost favorites, absolutely love it. The acting is superb. The costuming is incredible. Music, directing, cinematography: admirable on all levels! The socio-political issues raised apply even to our world more than 200 years later. The main characters are so well-drawn, so well-developed, so interesting, so beautiful. The writing is of a very high calibre. It looks like I admire all aspects of this S. Korean series, and I do.",1470787200,,544,4.923913043478261
8493574,5,B0065SNNAU,I love this Korean drama and love their wonderful story,1470787200,,55,4.6
8493575,5,B0065SNNAU,"This drama series seems to be fast becoming a favorite for me.  It's mostly just pure entertainment, funny and not making some big social comment.  Set in an era when women were not valued enough to be taught reading or writing, it's the story of one woman's search for knowledge, and the friends she makes while disguised as a man.

The DVD set is 6 discs of very high quality.  I tend to use slow motion and pause a lot while trying to read subtitled shows, especially when the characters are in deep conversation.  I judge the quality of the DVD on whether the picture stays clear or gets fuzzy while using these during playback.  This set has a clear picture and doesn't blur during either slow or pause.  I'm extremely happy with this purchase.",1449964800,4,749,4.503703703703704
8493576,5,B0065SNNAU,This Kdrama was so much fun. Touching moments too. Interesting history about Korean University. You fall in love with all the main characters and a lot of the supporting cast. We all loved it. Mickey Chun.. was in Girl who see's Smells . another wonderful Kdrama... done in contemporary time. Try it.,1447718400,2,300,4.788461538461538
