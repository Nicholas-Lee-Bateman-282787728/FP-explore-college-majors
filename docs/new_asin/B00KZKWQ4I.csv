6455112,4,B00KZKWQ4I,"Gripping documentary. A great supplement to Shoah. Lanzmann's interviews of Benjamin Murmelstein are riveting. Murmelstein is ""wily,"" but Lanzmann doesn't let him wriggle out of answering important questions about his actions while serving as the Last Elder of the Jews. I was fascinated by the film's juxtaposition of Claude Lanzmann, circa 1970s, and Lanzmann as a much older man, still reflecting on the fate of the Theresienstadt Jews. The film is a hauntingly beautiful memorial.",1416873600,5,484,5.466666666666667
6455113,5,B00KZKWQ4I,"I study the Holocaust and learn from everything I read and watch about the Holocaust - It is a life long study for me. I watched this somewhat long docu (3:38) over several sessions - it is in subtitle - and made notes of so many things to look up.  I haven't really read a lot about Therienstadt but knew it was the German version of a model camp. Though I could not understand Murmelstein in his native language, one could tell that he seemed, at times, to be coming from a defensive position.  His explanations for his actions made sense as he explained them but I could also see how, at the time and in that time frame, they were taken otherwise.  I plan on re-watching the docu more than once - quite comprehensive in it's history of this ""model"" camp and this figure in history.",1416787200,7,784,4.319727891156463

6455115,5,B00KZKWQ4I,"This was filmed in '75 and thank heavens someone decided to release it to the public.  Fascinating story of an Elder Rabbi and his story of being the Jewish leader in a concentration camp.  Again, it blows my mind of man's inhumanity to man.",1414972800,,241,4.454545454545454
6455116,5,B00KZKWQ4I,"Very interesting perspective of the holocaust and not overly dramatized.  That is not to say that it wasn't deeply affecting to the viewer. The story narrative by Murmelstein was riveting and quietly horrifying.  Murmelstein had a lot to say and was very thoughtful about his role in the camp, unapologetic at times, but effective in his narration.",1412208000,9,348,5.087719298245614
6455117,1,B00KZKWQ4I,"@ Mr. Zimmermann

 This comment is not only useless, it is entirely misleading, to wit ""it gives one participant an opportunity to set the record straight"", while the reviewer should rather have stated  ""that it gives one participant of an historic tragedy - in which he played a significant part - an opportunity TO DISTORT THE RECORD"".

  Murmelstein was an extraordinary intelligent, cunning and shrewd person who was despised and feared by most people who came in contact with him while he was in charge of the organizational and functional aspects of the deportations of the Viennese Jews from October 1941 to October 1942, I among them. During that time I had many opportunities not only to observe him but hearing many comments about him by others who came in contact with him. There and then later in Theresienstadt, I could witness for two more years  how his brutal behavior continued in Theresienstadt.
  There he was often called MURMELSCHWEIN which means MURMEL-PIG in German, and my judgment of him was and is shared by many and, furthermore, can easily be confirmed by many sources. There is much more to be said about him but that would my comments quite long

  Mr. Lanzmann seems to know little and understand even less about the Shoah. Nor does his previous experience as a journalist qualify him for this interview. For otherwise, he would not have depended on one person's testimony, especially about himself without also consulting other sources. Murmelstein was one of the earliest interviewees in 1975 when he launched his documentary ""Shoah"" and, interestingly, did not include any part of this interview in it . As a journalist in France Mr. Lanzmann's specialized in portraits of celebrities whom you let talk never asking critical questions; on the contrary one flatters and charms them, as Lanzmann's describes this in his autobiography.

  Murmelstein played a very insignificant role in Theresienstadt from January 1943, when he came there, till September 1944 though he was third among the Jewish administrators, called Elders of the Jews. His colleagues mistrusted him and assigned lesser departments to him. He only became the head of the administration when his predecessor was murdered by the SS on September 27, 1944. I left The next day for Auschwitz when this and the other ten transports in the following four weeks decimated Theresienstadt, leaving mostly the old and very few young people there. According to reports, his efficiency and ruthlessness enabled the prisoners to manage the last seven months till the liberation.

  I started to work on the history of this concentration camp in 1991 but had to interrupt in 2000 due to illness and death in my family, but hope to resume shortly.

8662896,1,B00KZKWQ4I,"This important subject bogged down with filler. Too many scenes of unnamed buildings modern trains and train stations and the director reading from a script. I expected more.

8662898,3,B00KZKWQ4I,"I am not sure what to make of THE LAST OF THE UNJUST. It tells the story of Theresienstadt, now in the Czech Republic, which was designated by Adolf Eichmann as a ""model ghetto,"" an idealized place which was deliberately designed to mislead the world about the ways in which Jews - especially the elderly, as well as children - were being treated. A propaganda film, released in the early Forties, shows a happy community of people contributing to the nation through regular work and ample leisure-time in which people were free to do as they wish.

In truth the ""model ghetto"" was just another death-camp in which Jews were herded together and either left to die or gunned down in cold blood. Benjamin Murmelstein, the last president of the Theresienstadt Jewish Council, was forced to negotiate day after day from 1938 until the end of the war with Eichmann. When the war ended he was ostracized by the Jewish population and forced into exile into Italy.

Three decades later director Claude Lanzmann tracked him down and interviewed him in Rome. Like many of those involved in the Final Solution, Murmelstein protests his innocence as well as trying to justify his behavior. But of course nothing can ever redeem him from the guilt of what happened.

Lanzmann's footage remained dormant for nearly four more decades until Lanzmann, now an elderly man himself, decided to put it in a film. THE LAST OF THE UNJUST is a long piece of nearly four hours duration, wherein the Murmelstein interview is split up with historic footage, as well as Lanzmann talking direct to camera about the reminiscences of those unfortunate enough to be members of the community, both living and dead.

The message is a harrowing one, reminding us of the depths to which humanity can sink in its lust for power. What renders the film even more difficult to fathom, however, is our awareness that similar atrocities have taken place elsewhere in the world since 1945, and continue to dominate the headlines. It seems that no one really wants to learn from the lessons of history despite Lanzmann's laudable attempts to make us do so.",1467331200,,2112,4.809917355371901

8662904,2,B00KZKWQ4I,"Overall I found this to be a disappointing documentary.  Based on the title, and the introductory film verbiage, Mumelstein was to be the focus of this film.  He was interviewed for days.  Yet Mumelstein was not on the screen for even half of this movie.  Lanzmann devoted far too much time talking about Eichmann, background for Theresienstadt, and other matters.  Oh, and also having himself front and center reading scripts, rather than just using interview clips from the only man who matters to this documentary.  As another reviewer mentioned, Lanzmann's interviewing here is atrocious.  He is much more hard hitting with the Poles, Germans, and Red Cross worker he interviews in Shoah.  I know the rap on Mumelstein from reading history elsewhere..  At the end of this film, I would be dumbfounded as to Mumelstein's actual roles and the claims against him.  I'm really not sure why Lanzmann felt he had to make this movie.",1424822400,2,930,4.941935483870968
