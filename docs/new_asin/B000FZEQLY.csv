8128026,1,B000FZEQLY,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! This is the really bad dub of One Piece that was created by a company that openly believes kids are stupid and illiterate. If you truly are a fan of One Piece please buy the voyage sets that are done by FUNimation. I would only recommend this to you if you're either giving it to someone you hate and want them to know how much you hate them, or if your suicidal and need that one extra push that will make you do it after Dragonball Evolution wasn't able to. Seriously buy the FUNimation DVDs for a true One Piece experience.",1517875200,,556,4.254716981132075

8128029,5,B000FZEQLY,"What can I say about this version of One Piece. Well as much hate 4Kids gets, they just poorly reasearched this anime and I'm pretty sure they would have given up the license at the drop of a pin. But they were stuck with it from 2004 to 2007, so they made the best that they could. I got hooked onto the franchise starting with this dub and when the license was dropped and then picked up by FUNimation, I still watched it. Now while the FUNimation is immensly superior, this is a part of Television history and should not be forgotten.",1354233600,,537,4.2745098039215685
