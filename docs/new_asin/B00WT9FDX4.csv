8714131,3,B00WT9FDX4,"Human Capital is an Italian language film with English subtitles, that is one of those movies that tells the story, then goes back and relives it from a a few different characters point of view a few times.  Basically a waiter bails early from a gig, smuggling telling his supervisor he won't be getting fired for not staying like everyone else to clean up, he gets his comeuppance down the road when he rides out in front of a four wheel drive and ends up in a ditch at the side of the road.  The four wheel drive and another vehicle at the scene both drive off leaving the waiter to die.  Then we flash back six months and begin the journey with a real estate agent, who is embarrassing his daughter who he is dropping off at her rich boyfriend's parent's house.  She wants him to drive off but he hangs around to talk to the boyfriend's mother as she is getting in her chauffeur driven car, and then starts wandering around the estate on foot and comes across the boyfriend's father playing tennis with some other business associates.  The father upon learning who he is invites him to play, since they can play doubles now there are four.  The girl's dad sleazily puts himself quickly into the situation of trying to get in on their business investments so he can get the big returns they are bragging to each other about.  Problem is he has to borrow the money to do it, and we know what happened to the Italian economy.

Then we see the tale from the boyfriend's mother's point of view.  Then the daughter's.

Spoiler for the ending follows - We learn in the text blurb ending that the boyfriend's family paid money to the guy on the bike.  This made no sense since he was innocent and the police, courts and everyone knew it.",1515456000,,1732,4.398119122257054

8714134,5,B00WT9FDX4,"Smart, well made Italian film, based on an American novel.  It opens with the scene of a hit and run accident and proceeds by showing how three families' lives intersect.  One is very weathy, one middle class and one  poor.  The main focus of attention is discovering who was driving the vehicle that struck the victim but in the process we see a lot about the personal lives of the individuals involved.  Tight, well paced and  well acted, it's well worth watching.",1440806400,,466,4.621951219512195

8714136,5,B00WT9FDX4,"Paolo Virzi (""Caterina va in citt&agrave;"" 2003, ""La prima cosa bella"" 2010) has done it again! In ""Il capitale umano"" (""Human Capital"" 2013) he gives us another permeating examination of the affectations of our very flawed human-society. His commentary is bold, honest and refreshing (very much like Marco Bellocchio), pretty much tells-it-like-it-is. This story unfolds from the perspective of 4 interrelated characters (and their distinctive vantage point), in how their motives and actions have dire consequences for all concerned. A very moving and compelling drama, don't miss this wonderful film by a truly unique and modern film-poet.

The cast were all excellent: the beautiful and talented Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, Fabrizio Ventivoglio, the beautiful Valeria Golino, Luigi lo Cascio, Matilde Gioli, Fabrizio Gifuni, etc. The DVD picture and sound quality by Film Movement is excellent. NTSC, Italian (English subtitles), NR 111 mins.

Love and Peace,

8714137,4,B00WT9FDX4,"Directed by Paolo Virzi based on the novel by American author Stephen Amidon this film is one of those that requires full attention so that the myriad aspects of individual views of a lifestyle and an incident seep in slowly.

The destinies of two families are irrevocably tied together after a cyclist is hit off the road by a jeep in the night before Christmas Eve. The intertwined cast of characters are Dino Ossola (Fabrizio Bentivoglio), a small-time real estate agent who dreams of bigger things, Serena Ossola (Matilde Gioli), his teenage daughter who dates a spoiled rich brat, Carla Bruneschi (Valeria Bruni Tedeschi  beautiful and brilliant as always), an actress who has given up her career to marry a wealthy businessman, Giovanni Bernaschi (Fabrizio Gifuni), her husband, a powerful player,  Massimiliano Bernaschi (Guglielmo Pinelli), the troubled son of the Bernaschis', Roberta Ossola (Valeria Golino), a psychologist, Dino's second wife,  Donato Russomano (Luigi Lo Cascio), a brilliant drama teacher who is enamored by Carla,  Luca Ambrosini (Giovanni Anzaldo), a teenager frowned upon by others, and an anonymous cyclist. They are all shareholders of the human capital. The story is divided into four chapters, seen from the point of view of three characters, plus a final chapter. The score was written and performed by Amy Winehouse. In Italian with English subtitles.

A tough movie to watch but on made with sophistication. Grady Harp, July 15",1436140800,,1466,5.243589743589744
8714138,4,B00WT9FDX4,"""Human Capital"" (2013 release from Italy; 110 min.) brings the story of two families, whose fates are so different yet intertwined. As the movie opens, we see a staff person bike home late at night after having worked at a big event of some sort. We also see a speeding SUV and the SUV appears to accidentally hit the biker, but doesn't stop. Whoa! Who was that? What just happened? After the opening credits, we are told we are ""Six Months Earlier - Chapter 1 - Dino"" and we get to know a number of characters: there is Dino, the real estate guy whose daughter Serena is dating Massimiliano, the son of a hedge-fund manager. Dino convinces the latter to let him buy in, but soon regrets doing so when the market tanks. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the big screen version of American author Stephen Amidon's acclaimed 2005 novel of the same name. How often do you see a big screen adaptation of an American novel that is made abroad, rather than in the US? Director Paolo Virzi transposes the story from Connecticut to Northern Italy very nicely, and along the way adds other elements to make this his own story. Second, the movie works on different levels: there is the immediate question as to what exactly happened at that hit-and-run late night accident (?). Then there is the social commentary about today's society and the influence of money on people (keep in mind: this is Italy, where they have been going through a Great Recession for YEARS now). The movie is split into 4 chapters, and we rehash more or less the same events from different people's perspectives (Dino, Carla, Serena). It's a technique that has been used before, but when executed well, as in this movie, it elevates the movie, as you discover new details in each new perspective of the same events. Last but not least, the movie features a great ensemble cast (there are about 7 or 8 key characters to keep track of). Bottom line: this is a movie that caught my attention from start to finish.

This movie is the May, 2015 release of Film Movement's on-going DVD Of the Month club. No idea why a 2013 release only now gets exposed to US audiences but better late than never I suppose. As always, the Film Movement DVD comes with a number of bonus materials, including an okay ""making of"", but far better is the bonus shortie. This time we get ""Job Interview"", an excellent 9 min. shortie from Germany about a woman (Lisa) being interviewed by another woman for a job. Just watch! Meanwhile, ""Human Capital"" is a worthwhile addition to Film Movement's ever-growing library of foreign and indie movies. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1432684800,4,2718,4.636929460580913
