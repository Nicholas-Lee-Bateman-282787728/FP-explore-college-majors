8085235,2,B000BD1LFY,I'm very upset.  Just received this DVD and was very surprised to find that it is not the DVD advertised.  I bought it for Lavell Crawford and Cedric the Entertainer--neither of which are on the DVD.,1293494400,,199,4.5
8085236,3,B000BD1LFY,"This laffapalooza 5 is not the dvd that is advertised, i purchased this dvd thinking it had Lavelle Crawford on it and he is not even on the dvd, i think the description of the dvds should be more accurate.",1285372800,,206,4.175
8085237,5,B000BD1LFY,Great funny DVD but i purchased it looking for Lavell Crawford. He is not on this one. The people on this dvd however are truly funny though.,1257033600,2,141,4.2592592592592595
8085238,5,B000BD1LFY,I am really happy with my purchase. I tell all of my peeps to shop Amazon!,1245110400,,74,3.6875
8085239,5,B000BD1LFY,The other reviewer and I have the same opinion. The other ones were ok but this one made me laugh hard!! I think I'm going to buy just this one on dvd because it's that good! Must see for any comedy fan!,1173830400,,203,3.857142857142857
8085240,5,B000BD1LFY,"Oh my goodness!!  The other one's were okay...but when I popped this one in the DVD player...I laughed from start to finish.  I laughed so hard my side hurt.  They were all equally funny.  If I had to pick a favorite, it would be a tie between Kevin Hart and Deon Cole.  Truly worth every penny!!!",1132358400,,297,4.232142857142857
