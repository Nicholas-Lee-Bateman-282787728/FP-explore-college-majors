8307956,2,B001H5O8OG,"The Review is on a copy that is 131 minutes; however the version I watched was 210 minutes so I cannot tell you what they cut out. With Fodor's Hamlet (2007) it probably does not matter anyway.

Call it contemporary (everyone is airing out their dirty underwear), verging on minimalist. Evidently it is a shot in the arm to the old Hamlet. But they cannot hold a candle to the original. They throw in everything but the kitchen sink including a few gender changes and everyone is related to a chess piece. The story is not consistent and wonders around periodicaly we get some iambi pentameter but maybe not Shakespeare In the most inappropriate moments. Hamlet (Wilson Belchambers) sniffs Polonia (Lydia Piechowiak) and tells her she smells like fish. Will this ever end?

One final kiss and Horatio (Katie Reddin-Clancy) good bye.

Some versions cut out every other sentence. One cut out Rosencrantz and Guildenstern leaving out a major part of the plot against Hamlet. Here we cut out the whole political purpose of the play by removing Fortinbras and Norway from the play and turning it into a cheap revenge plot.",1423180800,,1117,4.807291666666667
8307957,1,B001H5O8OG,"Fodor's contributions to Hamlet are noisy and very dull. It's like a bad MTV video, except the dialogue is from Hamlet. I have nothing against trying to present Hamlet with a contemporary style and interpretation, but Fodor's style is that of an untalented first year art student. He's no David Lynch.",1326844800,,301,4.921568627450981
8307958,1,B001H5O8OG,"This is undoubtedly the WORST Hamlet I have ever seen.  In its attempt to be avant garde the direction, photography and even a good deal of the acting comes off amateurish.  I have seen better High School productions.  Ophelia as a drug addict?  Horatia and Polonia instead of Horatio and Polonius?  Granted, there has always been a fascinating dynamic between Hamlet and Horatio which has all too often been played down, but it just does not work as a male-female relationship.

If you want to see Hamlet, see Richard Burton, David Tennant, Mel Gibson, Kevin Kline, even Laurence Olivier (though I think his concept of ""a  man who couldn't make up his mind"" was flawed and the shuffling around of the scenes makes me want to scream) but if you have any respect for The Bard, let this one sink into oblivion.",1275264000,13,808,4.647887323943662
8307959,2,B001H5O8OG,"There were a few things about this version of Hamlet that actually worked for me, having women play Horatio and Polonius among them, and having Ophelia die of a drug overdose fit in well. Some of the acting was good enough.  But this was obviously a low budget effort filled with effects that struck me as pretentious and that eventually became tiresome.  There were too many overexposed backgrounds, too many split screens, and too many hotel hallways meant to remind us of The Shining.  Finally, there was way too little Hamlet.  I understand perfectly well that any film version of Shakespeare is going to omit some lines, but this one has omitted large chunks of the play.",1268352000,4,676,4.752136752136752
8307960,5,B001H5O8OG,"Taken in perspective, given the excellent Hamlets already on film, this is a wonderful addition, placing Hamlet in an up-to-date context. The words are still those of Shakespeare, but the interpretation is of the 21st C, with Ophelia succumbing to drugs, Polonius being recast as Polonia, Ophelia's sister, and other changes that make the tragedy wonderfully meaningful for contemporary viewers.

Shakespeare's Hamlet never grows old. It has been reinterpreted many many times without losing any of its effectiveness and this version adds to all the others in an artistic, stunning fashion.",1262995200,5,590,5.483516483516484
