8427214,1,B004ELAF6A,"I normally don't buy anything that has not been thoroughly reviewed here on Amazon, but was suckered in by the following jacket decription: ""Discover Little- Known Covert Insider Secrets That Will Transform Your Facebook Account Into An Income Spinning Asset- And Start Generating For You Massive Ammounts of Cash Day- In, Day- Out...On Complete Autopilot!""

Huh? There are certainly no secrets here.

The only ""Cash Code"" is the money that the author just made, and I wasted, by purchasing this DVD. For starters, this is a very low production DVD. In addition, the author's broken English makes it very difficult to understand and painful to even follow. In fact, the author makes many typing, verbal and miscue errors that he didn't even bother to edit out. Similarly, the author does an equally poor job of explaining most of the dynamics of facebook, skims over facebook functions + features at the speed of light, then mostly advises you (the viewer) to go figure things out for yourself. The majority of this production is information that can be acquired simply by following facebook directions and a little experimentation on your own (which is routinely advised by the author). The DVD actually earns its one and only star (versus none) due to the author's clever ad descriptions...otherwise save your time & money.",1294617600,5,1325,5.045662100456621
