803759,3,6304167644,"Naomi Watts (Tank Girl) hasn't gotten near the number of lead roles she's deserved despite her stellar supporting work in Tank Girl and Dangerous Beauty.  So for the moment this will do -- an overly bloody, sometimes  shocking horror sequel.
Despite the sub-par script and overly liberal  gore (this from a guy who's absorbed everything from Dawn of the Dead to  Maniac, from Henry:  Portrait of a Serial Killer to Richard Kern's shorts),  Children of the Corn IV is better than usual because of Watts' ability to  play a strong heroine with a secret.  With her panache for vituperous  dialogue and two moments of genuine emotional release (when Margaret wakes  up the close-up on Watts is priceless), Watts puts past and present horror  heroines like Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween) and Neve Campbell (Scream) to  shame.
Even given her solid work (and a bonus point for her good American  accent), this is still not a movie you'd put onto a best-of list.  But good  performances overall and a mood well set makes this worth your while...even  if it won't be held up as any kind of a shining filmmaking example.",927936000,,1108,4.783068783068783

803909,5,6304167644,"I have to be honest, I bailed on this series back in the day after catching part of ""Urban Harvest"" on TV, and would not have re-visited these films if not for a mega-DVD which featured 6 of the ""Children of the Corn"" sequels for $5. Always ready to enjoy a cheesy film, I simply couldn't pass that up.

As the opening credits rolled on ""The Gathering"" I immediately became interested. Naomi Watts and Karen Black..this film boasted two Academy Award nominated actresses??!?!? Of course we are catching Watts on her way up and Black on her way down..but still, that's pretty impressive casting. They are also backed by some great character actors; Brent Jennings (""Moneyball"") and William Windom (""Murder She Wrote"").

A young woman returns home to care for her younger brother and sister when it seems that her mother may be losing her grip on reality. The town of Grand Island, Nebraska seems to be in the grip of something odd, and when an old drunk opens a long abandoned well, something evil is unleashed. Something that is taking over the children of Grand Island.

What really made me sit up and take notice was the opening nightmare sequence. The director, Greg Spence, is adding some great camerawork and movement, giving the opening scene quite a bit of atmosphere. As the movie plays out, Spence does a fantastic job of adding little touches here and there, keeping the camera close to the action, giving a sense of isolation to the characters and the camera movement and some nifty slo-mo shots give the whole thing a fever-dream feel. Yes, this is a low budget film, but this director does more with what he is given than most modern horror film makers. There are a few mis-steps, but overall, Spence does a great job of building tension and creating atmosphere.

There is a decent amount of gore, but this isn't a splatter film. What makes ""Children of the Corn IV"" work so well is the creepy vibe woven throughout the film. It helps too, that the focus remains on the adults instead of the kids. While the featured kids do a really good job, Naomi Watts, Brent Jennings and Karen Black do most of the heavy lifting. And while this too is based on Stephen King's short story, ""The Gathering"" builds it's own mythos, creating a backstory for He Who Walks Behind the Rows, and it's a good one. One of the odd aspects of these films is why normal children would be drawn to a child-preacher in the first place? ""The Gathering"" does a wonderful job explaining the ""why"", ""who"" and ""how"".

Best entry in the series so far, highly recommeneded.",1402444800,2,2552,4.6371681415929205

803916,3,6304167644,"I have seen and own all of The Children Of The Corn Series. I can say in general that it went really down hill. The first one was decent, but of course not too much horror. The 2nd and 3rd were completly ridiculous, and made no sense what so ever. Just a big waste.

Children Of The Corn 4 The Gathering, I can say was a little bit of a comback compared to the last 2. I think it was worth watching and gave me a little faith again that the series might improve. only problem with this movie was it strayed completly from the power of the corn and ""he who walks behind the rows"". It went into the power of a boy names Josiah. A boy who was abandoned by his mother, and took in by traveling preachers. he later became ""The Amazing Boy Preacher"", that everyone would come and listen to. The preachers became rich because of him, and never wanted it to end. to do that they had to keep him small. So they poisened him with mercury to try to stunt his growth. Unfortunaly their plan didn't work and he grew up anway. Slowly the money ran out, and he again he was abandoned. Later on his soul is unleashed from a well by a drunk. Then he starts his plan to start controling all the children by a fever. He chooses another who was abandoned just like he was to lead the children into their rampage of killing all the adults.

I can't say this is the best from The Children of the corn but it was the first descent one after the 1st Children Of The Corn. So if you want a little faith again in this series, I recommend you at least see it once.",1211068800,,1537,4.069306930693069
803995,4,6304167644,"Well, since I did not really care for Part III at all, I was questioning whether or not to see 4 or not, but it was cheap so I decided to order it and watch it, and here is the plot and what I thought of it:

This movie also has some really common actors in it like Karen Black, Naomi Watts, & William Windom.

Well, this movie opened in a dream. We see a very ill Karen Black having a nightmare about a boy coming into her home with a slash on his hand, and then kills her. But then she wakes up to most horror fans disappointment, and then we come to the opening credits. May I note I liked the end credit opening credit music, it was creppy and kinda cool. Here we see Karen Blacks daughter driving to her house, meeting with her two other siblings, and younger boy & girl, with her doctor, played by William Windom. We soon discover she is becoming addicted to her meds, causing her to have more nightmares.

But unknowing to everybody, a boy preacher named Josiah has been resurrected in the town. He kills some random drunk farmer in order to take his barnhouse. A night later, all towns children become possessed under a fever at 105.0. The hospital Naomi Watts & William Windom work at is over-crowded, and a busy night for them burrying the kids in ice and putting them in an ice cold bath-tub, then, everything goes peaceful and subsides, but now there will be a dramatic change in the kids personality.

Soon, they all mysteriously creep out into the cornfields, in attempts to fully resurrect the boy preacher Josiah. Later revealed in the film, it says Josiah was burned to death by adults, so you can pretty much see the purpose of the gathering.

So Naomi Watts is going to uncover the mystery with this African American guy, whos son has become possessed under the power. So they both learn the secret of Josiah, learning he canonly be defeated with quicksilver. So they fill gun chambers with it, and attempt to kill Josiah, they find all the dead bodies in this barn of the few people killed. Soon, Naomi eventually melts Josiah, breaking the spell, turning all the children normal again.

Karen Black was one of the very few killed by the children, so the movie ends with the rest of the family visiting her grave. So pretty much the two kids & Naomi move away, all the children in the town are now living happy again (since they didn't kill the parents in this film).

This movie, was actually kinda cool. It tries to be an actual SCARY film, at at some points of the film, it is actually pretty creepy and a few jumps thrown in there. Also really good gore, lots of scythe deaths, along with ceing chopped in half by the waist and dragged on a pitchfork. I give Children of the corn IV 4/5, I'd get it if you stumble across it.",1196812800,,2748,4.35546875
803996,1,6304167644,"This is the crappiest movie! The only part i liked was when josiah said: ""Ive come for the children."" and cuts that guys head off! That was at the very beginning! This makes cotc ll even better! Save your money!",1196640000,,211,4.3

804000,3,6304167644,"I gotta tell ya, this series isn't rocketing down the drain with the sorta speed I woulda imagined.  In fact, this one is actually better than 3 in a number of ways, though not enough better for it to actually be, ya know, good, so it's actually less entertaining.  But hell, I didn't mind seeing it, and it was amusing enough for me to continue on with the series.

This one isn't directly related to any of the earlier films.  It's more of a knockoff than a sequel, really.  There's no reference to Gaitlin but it is still in Nebraska, in uh, some other town.  Also, there is corn, but it ain't directly related to the action in any way.  Still, ya have got a lotta evil children with Old testament style names, so it's got the same basic flavor.  This one involves Grace, who came back to Nebraska to take care of her crazy, ailing mother.  She's a med student and goes to work in the local doctor's office while she's there.  A strange plague breaks out, affecting various children, but no one else.  They all seem to recover spontaneously, but definitely aren't the same, anymore.  I gotta tell ya, I kinda like this plot.  The execution isn't very good, but it's got a decent base.  I think they coulda made a decent script from this premise, and this isn't as laughable as the kinda ultra-cheap horror usually is.

Though this movie has got a fair bit of gore in it, it's actually trying to be more conventionally scary than the prior sequels seemed to be.  It can't pull this off, but it is a bit less silly than some of the earlier stuff.  Still, it has got some decent gore, and they use the scythe a whole lot.  There wasn't nearly enough scythe action in the prior CotC films.

This movie gets some extra attention cause it stars Naomi Watts.  Some people will tell you that her performance here is a lot better than you'd usually see in this kinda film, but ehh, I dunno.  It's better, yeah, but not that much better, and still the stuff of B-movies.  Karen Black is a lotta fun as her crazy mother, however.  No one else makes much of an impression.

This movie has some pacing problems, as a bit too much of the gore is stuffed towards the beginning, and it fails to really build in anyway.  It just kinda meanders along, arrives at the climax, and then ends.

Yeah, I guess I'm done.  I sufficiently diverting little B-movie.  Those who want to see this know who they are.

804001,3,6304167644,"No other author in recent memory has had as much consistent success selling books as Stephen King. For roughly three decades the Maine writer churned out book after book, each one selling more and more copies. He's a world unto himself, the lucky fellow! He's so successful that he could throw out his pens, put away his typewriters, bury his word processor six feet under, never write another word in his life, and STILL have enough money to wallpaper the Great Wall of China five times over. In many respects, it's Stephen King's world and the rest of us are just living in it. But, and this is a gigantic but, an enormous number of metaphysically bad films based on his novels threaten to put a serious dent in his legacy. We all know the good ones, the ones that not only scared audiences stiff but also helped propel King's career to even greater heights. ""Carrie"" is probably the best example, followed by ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Dead Zone."" These are wonderful, magical films that one can watch again and again without wearying of them. Then there are the rest: the truly wretched refuse that reminds one of dental plaque or the junk that washes up on the shores of a filthy river. Welcome to the Children of the Corn franchise.

""Children of the Corn 3"" moved the malevolent corn cult to Chicago. In the fourth installment, the franchise travels back to Nebraska in an attempt to return to its roots. Instead of good old Gatlin, however, the movie unfolds in Grand Island. Grace Rhodes (Naomi Watts) returns home to care for her rapidly deteriorating relative June (Karen Black), a woman who cannot leave the property she owns due to the effects of a fearful dream. In this vision, a young child turns up at her front door to terrorize her. Grace, who has medical experience and plans on one day earning her medical degree, hopes to alleviate June's irrational fears. In the meantime, she goes back to work with Dr. Bob Larson (William Windom) at his medical clinic. In no time at all something sinister starts occurring in town. Kids begin showing up at the clinic with sky-high temperatures and other cardinal signs of a life threatening fever. Instead of perishing, though, the children eventually wake up completely changed. They assume names of children long since dead, exhibit hostility to adults, and generally act weird. When Bob Larson disappears under mysterious circumstances--not so mysterious to the viewer who saw him cut in half--Grace steps in and fills the void. Children continue to sicken and then transform.

Rhodes eventually uncovers several clues explaining the odd behavior going on in Grand Island. According to two elderly women, years before a group of traveling preachers brought a young religious prodigy named Josiah (Brandon Kleyla) into town. This kid seemed to work miracles, and the money poured in from far and wide. Then a series of unfortunate incidents led to Josiah's death. It turns out that his ghost is the prime force behind what is happening to Grand Island's children. This spirit is seeking to bring the children together in order to restore Josiah to corporeal form through Margaret Rhodes, who just happens to be Grace's daughter. Confused yet? Throw in side character Donald Atkins (Brent Jennings), a guy whose son went through the transformation and promptly murdered his mother. Rather than take the rap for the crime, Donald went underground until the script told him to meet up with Grace Rhodes. The two head over to some abandoned farmhouse in order to confront the evil that is Josiah. As for June Rhodes-- whose horrific dreams served as the impetus to the entire movie--she can only stand by and watch her vision become a frightening reality, right down to the smallest detail. June and lots of other people expire in particularly heinous manners throughout the film.

""Children of the Corn 4: The Gathering"" is an acceptable genre flick thanks largely to the efforts of the inestimable Naomi Watts. She's a big name now thanks to ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""The Ring,"" but back when this movie came out she had to punch the Hollywood time clock just like any other no name actor. She manages to rise above the convoluted script and deliver a solid performance. The same should be said for horror film favorite Karen Black, although her contribution here differs greatly from what Watts offers. Since she plays a woman teetering on the edge of a nervous breakdown, the script requires Black to lay the ham on thick. Her physical appearance is hilarious, consisting of an unkempt coif and raccoon makeup. I want to say that it is in ""Children of the Corn 4"" where Black delivers a scream that is so forced and over the top that I hurt myself laughing, but I'm not entirely sure since I've seen so many of her films at this point that they are starting to blend together. The movie also boasts a few impressive gore scenes, especially Larson's disturbing end, which help move the whole thing along.

Extras on the disc consist of trailers for parts three, five and six of the ""Children of the Corn"" series, ""Mimic 2,"" ""Dracula 2000,"" ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers,"" and ""Halloween: H20."" From here on out, the series falls prey to a serious case of the law of diminishing returns. Part five isn't all that bad, but six and seven will have you holding your nose. ""Children of the Corn 4"" should appeal to Naomi Watts completists and those viewers who must see as many horror films as possible no matter how poor their quality.",1103932800,3,5508,4.794736842105263

For a series which is currently seven movies long, only three of them are worthing watching -- and 1996's ""Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering"" is one of them. Actually baring the least resemblance to Stephen King's original story, ""Corn IV"" moves the action back to a small midwestern town... but He Who Walks Behind The Rows is nowhere in sight.  Instead, a murdered child preacher is resurrected and looks to possess the town's children.  Its up to a young medical student (Naomi Watts, ""The Ring"") to unlock the mystery.""Corn IV"" features some genuinely creepy moments, including the opening scene with veteran actress Karen Black, and a few nightmare sequences that will have you doing a double take.  The haunting story told by the town doctor (William Windom, TV's ""Murder, She Wrote"") is particularly effective. As far as quality, ""The Gathering"" is a close second in quality, with ""Corn III"" remaining the crown jewel of the series.  In any case, it is still a pleasant surprise for anyone going into this one expecting a bomb.",1057881600,,1129,4.890052356020942
804004,3,6304167644,"... Not many of them are scary. I will admit though the first texas chainsaw massacre did. Recently ive been watching the COTC series(an exausting 7) and it seems the more they make the less of a story we get. It went from not many killings and a good story(COTC 1) to basically no story and alot of blood, killing, and horribly effected creatures(COTC 3)but i will say that of the series, 4 is definitly one of the best. Yeah there is a lot of killing, blood, and some baaaaad acting(the black girl who dies) but it actually has a story to it.. Honestly im not lieing. the story doesnt really get told till toward the end but the story is actually good and seems like it took more than 5 min to come up with. It starts with a mother who has 2 children living with her. she is suffering from bad dreams where children attack and kill her. They scare her so bad taht she is even afraid to leave the front yard. When her other daughter heres she is getting worse she decides to stop in for a visit to help around with things. From there she notices that all the kids begin to get sick with the same ""illness."" as the movie moves along, you find out about a certain child that did not age and when the people he was with considered him useless they burned him and threw his soul into the bottom of a well. A stupid drunk in the movie(arent they all) brings the spirit up and now he is needing a certain child to help bring him back to power. I won't go into it more since this is a movie you should watch not just read about. The movie itself is not really scary but it is fun to watch. If you enjoy the COTC series you will like this one. Dont worry, it isn't nearly as bad and corny as COTC 2 and 3. The other good thing about this movie is that it is a break from the ""He who walks behind the rows"" tale and there is no dark bible spouting like the other ones. This one doesnt bring up the rows monster at all. and its good that we could take a break from that for one movie. My only question is, how is it that the leaves are strong enough to wrap around someone and drag them all over the place? i wouldnt think the corn leaves would be that hard to break?",1056499200,4,2158,4.044392523364486

Karen  Black was her normal self, but the others were good.  The main character,  and the little girl had a real connection, that was evident through out the  movie.  My firm belief:  They should have stopped after the 2nd one.  I  honestly beleive that the majority of Horror movies need one and only one  sequel.  The 3rd children of the corn was truly good, atleast up until that  horrible, horrible ending.  I mean my gods, please that was true trash!  This is followed by 2 terrible sequels.  The 5th goes back to ""he who  walks behind the rows""  which was one of the main, if inviisble  characters that existed from the beginning, but the 4th took him out.

I was a little disappointed that He Who Walks Behind the Rows wasn't involved, and the whole idea of why this kid wants revenge was a  little fuzzy. But that Naomi Watts girl and Jamie Renee Smith I thought  were pretty good actresses. This is a must buy for anyone who likes  suspense and horror.",954115200,,380,4.4

I just bought it to have all the movies. But wow i couldn't care less about watching this again, not in a hurry anyway.",1494460800,,275,4.3076923076923075

7864159,3,6304167644,"One might hesitate to become FURTHER INVESTED in the CHILDREN OF THE CORN franchise....however there is a VERY IMPORTANT REASON why one should reconsider...and that is...KAREN BLACK.

In her heyday...KAREN BLACK was a oscar nominated starlet for her role in DAY OF THE LOCUSTS. However...she tragically fell from grace....and a girl has got to make a living. Thus...Karen Black became REBORN as a QUEEN of CULT HORROR!!! You might also remember her as the randy yet murderous mother in HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES. Karen can be TRUSTED to always deliver a LOVABLY neurotic performance...

ALSO....this apparently IS NOT A TRUE SEQUEL TO THE OTHER CHILDREN OF THE CORN FLICKS!!! This features a BRAND NEW CORNFIELD...BRAND NEW MURDEROUS CHILDREN....with very different motivations!!!!!!

This movie also features mark salling aka the mohawk dude from glee...and NAOMI WATTS in her FIRST ROLE.",1434499200,2,886,5.359712230215828
