8705144,5,B00UB7YQS4,"Is it side-splitting funny. ?.. No. Are the dance number things of beauty ?.. No. Will the singing make the angels weep ? .. No, but what it is, is entertaining and a time machine to the past. This wasn't supposed to be high art, it was Vaudeville it was supposed to be entertaining and it was. If you're old enough to remember comics decrying the death of Vaudeville on TV talk shows of the 50's & 60's ...... THIS is what they were talking about.",1503792000,,448,4.22093023255814
8705145,5,B00UB7YQS4,"Nineteen musical and comedy ""vaudeville"" sketches presented in the form of a live television broadcast from Elstree Studio in London.
Alfred Hitchcock (age 31) directed parts of ""Elstree Calling"" (1930) along with three lesser known directors.
Unfortunately, detailed records of what Hitchcock directed have not survived.
His on-screen credit is ""Sketches and other interpolated items by Alfred Hitchcock"".
I'm not sure what is meant by ""interpolated items"", but there are three sketches:

1) THE TELEVISION SKETCH
Actor Gordon Harker plays an inventor trying to watch the broadcast of ""Elstree Calling"" on his new-fangled television set (photo one).
This is the first mention of television in the movies.
Gordon Harker had previously acted in three silent Hitchcock films: ""The Ring"" (1927), ""The Farmer's Wife"" (1928) and ""Champagne"" (1928).
Presented in six segments, with a total running time of 2 minutes, 31 seconds.
Part 1: Chapter 1 @ 6:35
Part 2: Chapter 1 @ 7:36
Part 3: Chapter 2 @ 17:34
Part 4: Chapter 6 @ 53:12
Part 5: Chapter 8 @ 1:13:41
Part 6: Chapter 9 @ 1:26:13

2) THE SHAKESPEARE SKETCH
Donald Calthrop plays a ham actor attempting to perform Shakespeare.
Culminating in a performance of ""The Taming of the Shrew"" with Chinese-American actress Anna Mae Wong.
Calthrop is best remembered for his role as the villain in Hitchcock's first talkie, ""Blackmail"" (1929).
Presented in six segments, with a total running time of 11 minutes.
Part 1: Chapter 1 @ 8:30
Part 2: Chapter 2 @ 17:50
Part 3: Chapter 5 @ 40:06
Part 4: Chapter 5 @ 46:47
Part 5: Chapter 6 @ 56:40
Part 6: Chapter 8 @ 1:15:58

3) THE LOVE TRIANGLE SKETCH
Featuring John Longden, Jameson Thomas and an unidentified actress.
John Longden starred in four Hitchcock films: ""Blackmail"" (1929), ""Juno & the Paycock"" (1930), ""The Skin Game"" (1931), and ""Young & Innocent"" (1937).
The only sketch presented uninterrupted (3 minutes, 19 seconds).

Aside from Hitchcock's participation, and the first mention of television,
""Elstree Calling"" is historically important as Britain's first musical, and for four musical numbers filmed in Pathe's new two-strip Pathecolor.
I don't know what these looked like in 1930, but they have not aged all that well. Mostly different shades of yellow (photos 2 and 3)
Chapter 2 @ 11:35 Helen Burnell + the Adelphi Girls
Chapter 6 @ 50:44 Hannah Jones (?) + The Adelphi Girls
Chapter 7 @ 1:08:33 Helen Burnell + Jack Hulbert
Chapter 9 @ 1:20:45 Cicely Courtnedge

To me, two musical acts stand out:
--- Teddy Brown (photo 4), xylophonist, drummer and bandleader.
There is an excellent article about him on Wikipedia.
Surprisingly agile for a 400 pound man.
Chapter 1 @ 4:36
Chapter 6 @ 53:40
Chapter 6 @ 57:46
--- The Three Eddies (photo 5)
Most modern reviewers assume that ""The Thee Eddies"" must be white men in black face,
but a hundred years ago it was common for black as well as white entertainers to wear blackface (with exaggerated white mouth and eye makeup).
The tap dancing in the first number is pretty spectacular.
Not at all what I would expect from three white guys circa 1930, and certainly not from three Englishmen.
I wonder if ""The Three Eddies"" were touring African-American performers?
I have found nothing at all about them on the internet.

I had playback problems with the US DVD (it kept freezing), so replaced it with the UK DVD.
It played perfectly on my five year old region-free DVD player.
One interesting difference: Though the contents are the same, the UK DVD played for 1:23:32 versus 1:26:40 for the American DVD.
Apparently there was a discrepancy in the playback speed of the original film.
I am more inclined to trust the UK import which was restored by the British Film Institute.

8705148,3,B00UB7YQS4,"Released in 1930, Elstree Calling was directed by Andre Charlot, Jack Hulbert, Paul Murray, and Alfred Hitchcock. Luckily, too many cooks did not spoil the broth in this case but created a marvelous musical and comedic souffl. The film is a series of vaudeville-type skits and sketches. Tommy Handley hosts the show. Think, and having thunk, think again, Handley humorously advises the audience.

The sections vary in quality but none are poor. Among the best: Teddy Brown whistling while playing the xylophone; lovely, blonde, and ethereal Helen Burnell in a sparkling sequined gown singing; a sprightly Russian-style song and dance number; Cicely Courtnedge singing an entrancing rendition of Im Falling In Love; and Jack Hulbert and Helen Burnell in a dynamic duet. One brief sketch is darkly humorous as a man appears to enter a home, shoot the man and woman he catches kissing, only to realize, Im in the wrong flat!

In one section, bagpipes play while a Scotsman in a kilt sings about how happiness costs such a lot. It is wonderfully sung but some viewers may be offended by the way it plays on the stereotype of the Scots as stingy.

Far more viewers are apt to be offended by the sketches done by The Three Eddies. The tap dancers are in blackface with white lips, white bowler hats, and white-rimmed round eyeglasses. Their tap dancing is wonderfully skilled but one does not have to be a stickler for political correctness to be disturbed by the racist stereotyping in their act.

A better note is struck in a skit in which Elstree Calling appears to play with racial (not necessarily racist expectations). In an odd take on The Taming of the Shrew, Anna Mae Wong is the clearly Asian daughter of a white man. Beautiful Wong appears as Katherine in a shiny and revealing outfit. Instead of being tamed, this shrew gets her revenge by throwing cream pies in the faces of all the men around her  including Shakespeare himself!

Like many works from past time periods, Elstree Calling sometimes strikes an off chord with contemporary audiences. Nevertheless, it is a fast-paced and fun series. One hour and twenty-six minutes long, it never drags but is a very entertaining potpourri of performances.",1432598400,4,2209,4.8773333333333335
