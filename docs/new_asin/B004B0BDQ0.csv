8421282,5,B004B0BDQ0,"All professional production, even with (what appears to be) low budget hardware, but Gilley is a consummate showman, with an exceptionally fine catalogue - an astounding number of Pop and Country hits.

Not a great singer nor keyboard man but his showanship and love for music - and love for his famous cousins, Jerry Lee Lewis and Jimmy Swaggart, shines. (A little rough on the man of ""The Cloth"", comedically speaking,, but MG makes it work in a good-natured way).

Alot of traditional Country artsists have their foil, their stage clown, and Mickey's got a classic (though his name escapes me), a looney, rubber-legged and rubber faced dude, a kind of combination of Mel Tillis and Crazy guggenheim (Frank Fontaine), his scriptyede and (apparently) non-scripted quips are often sensationally funny! And the big plus is, the guy's a fine singer and instrumentalist - his violin playing is featured.

Some material can be considered dated or veering on the juvenile side but the two really click. And to a full house!

(Man, I wish Mickey did ""A Whole Lotta Twistin' Goin' On""!!).",1304467200,,1081,4.955801104972376
