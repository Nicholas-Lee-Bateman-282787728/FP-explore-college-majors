4312523,5,B004AWPDYM,"This is a great DVD, working on more than just the abs, doing some deep core work with the soaz muscle, which I haven't found in other core workouts.  It is challenging, and each time I go a bit further (surprising myself the other day as I actually made it into crow pose for a moment!).  It's great to be able to do 15, 30, or 45 minutes to fit my schedule.  Highly recommended.",1302998400,8,380,4.108108108108108
4312524,5,B004AWPDYM,"I made the mistake of deciding to try this video for the first time on my first day back to exercise after a week sick with the flu.  I had mistakenly thought that since it was only 30 minutes (and, actually, as some reviewers have already pointed out, it can be longer if you opt to select all three of the segments), that it would be easy.  Not true!  It was quite a challenge - in a good way.  I love videos that give me something to work towards (like the side crow pose in this one!).  This video is very different from her other Sedona video, as well - no repeats here.  In fact, between the two Sedona videos, this one is definitely my favorite.  I found this to be a very unique yoga workout with several moves I have not seen elsewhere - it is almost like pilates in the sense that it is very targeted towards the core.  (In fact, several of the moves are very reminiscent of pilates moves.) I definitely plan to add this video to my workout rotation frequently, and I hope that Sadie will put out other target-specific videos.  My only complaint is that I feel as if the floor segment in particular could move a bit faster with a bit less chat.  Overall I would say that this is a very solid intermediate level video with one or two advanced moves (crow and side crow), and that it is truly unique from other yoga videos.  Highly recommended!",1297123200,17,1352,4.262745098039216
4312525,4,B004AWPDYM,"I've been practicing Bikram yoga for over a year and wanted a dvd I can do at home when I cannot make it to the hot studio. I tried this last night for the first time. First thing I noticed is that the entire dvd is actually 45 minutes long as opposed to the 30 it says. There is a 15 minute warm up, a 15 minute standing series and a 15 minute floor series (you can pick and choose or do them all). I am more than ok with that.
I wouldn't call myself a beginner Yogi but some of these poses were too advanced for me to come close to completing on the firsr try. That being said: I am, again, more than ok with that. I will follow along as best I can and now I have an additonal goal of learning to complete all the poses.
I love this DVD. It's a nice change of pace from Bikram and if you follow her instructions about the way to hold your stomach and your lower spine, you can really feel your belly burn. I noticed it a lot in the muscles right below the belly which is exciting for me because that is my trouble spot.
My only other suggestion would be to watch this dvd through one time and watch how each pose is done if you are unfamiliar with this type of yoga. I think it would be much easier to follow along the first time you try if you have seen each pose done first.",1295568000,22,1278,3.900383141762452
4312526,5,B004AWPDYM,"Wow! Sadie Nardini's prowess as a teacher just grows and grows. I love this DVD! Her very detailed instructions and visualizations come into both my left and right brain through her use of physiological detail and sharp metaphorical imagery. After just 3 meetings on my mat with this DVD, I am learning how to send different kinds of instruction to my core, using deeper muscles than have become my habit.
This series of abdominal/core flows are deep, sweet and tough. I have done the DVD 3 times and each time I worked it into a longer yoga experience with another DVD, doing Sun Salutations and standing poses, then doing Sadie's Core DVD, then onto the mat for a few more front body stretches, hip openers, twists and shavasana. Because this DVD is easily done as either one continuous series of flows or 3 individual sections, it is very easy to insert into the middle of a longer practice when I want to focus more on core work. If I were to do it alone, I would still do some Sun Salutations to warm myself up and some lunar yoga to end.
I got this DVD because while I am in very good shape, I am having problems with my hips. I am 50 and menopausal. I am following a path to healing which seems to keep pointing to my psoas muscles and they are isolated and given so much attention in this DVD, that I believe doing this routine 2-3 times a week is going to help me on my healing path. Sadie's instruction is teaching me how to find new and perhaps better pathways between my brain and my belly. And my response to this is a whole hearted YES!
If you have Shiva Rea's Core series DVDs and wondered if this was worth having too, it is, absolutely worth having. It's VERY different from Shiva's work and would make a fine addition to a serious, yoga loving, core focused person's collection.",1294790400,36,1796,4.396396396396397
4312527,5,B004AWPDYM,"I have been practicing yoga for about a year.  I have another Sadie DVD which I love.  I worried that this DVD would be a replica of portions of the other DVD, however, it provided many different methods while still being slighty familiar.  The core strength was much more intense.  I would recommend warming up for about 5 minutes before starting this DVD.

There is not much of a relaxation at the end, but I don't focus too much on that.  Relaxation is something that I can do on my own if I decide to.

I love Sadie.  Her practice has transformed my fitness level.  I have lost 70 pounds and am a new person!",1294185600,13,612,4.252173913043478
4312528,5,B004AWPDYM,"I've been practicing with this DVD for the past couple of days now and have come to appreciate Sadie as an instructor. She seems very caring and knowledgeable. It took me a while to find my mind-body-connection here - in effect, it now feels like yoga rather than exercise. The best of all: Once I'm done for the day, I can't wait to return the next day - and that doesn't happen to me very often. I really feel that I can grow and benefit from this routine immensely. So five stars it is!

This is what I initally wrote:

""I finally got my copy and started my day with this practice. To me it somehow felt more like a workout than yoga, therefore I'm not as enthusiastic about this DVD as I hoped I would be. The workout has 3 segments: 1) Core Warm-Up (14 min), 2) Standing Core Flow (13 min), 3) Floor Core Flow (14 min). It comes with a matrix menu, which is always a nice feature. There is no savasana, no meditation, unfortunately, and for me the warm-up sequence didn't really warm me up. Sadie does talk constantly, and I'm still undecided whether it'll prevent me from using this DVD a lot. There are two audio tracks: The first one is her voice only, the second one is with additional music. She does make you aware of doing each pose correctly, so that's fine. She talks directly into the camera - and I was amazed more than once how she can do a very strenuous movement and still talk very relaxed and without apparent strain. I did like the routine as a whole and thought it was challenging but doable, so that is a plus. Maybe I will come to like this practice, at least I hope I will.""",1294012800,14,1600,4.259868421052632
4312529,4,B004AWPDYM,"Think of this DVD as a series of yoga based exercises, designed to develop extreme core strength; with a focus on the belly. Consider this DVD to supplement a more balanced vinyasa program.

For someone in search of peace and relaxation, strength and flexibility, and a youthful feeling body; I would recommend this DVD in addition to INSIGHT YOGA with Sarah Powers. Both Sarah and Sadie have a physical strength based on grace, flexibility and balance.

Beginners may be advised to start with The Original TOTAL YOGA with Tracey Rich.",1293840000,11,535,4.933333333333334
4312530,4,B004AWPDYM,"I got this product, because it was recommended to me by a friend.  The first time I did the yoga from this DVD, it was VERY hard (I have taken yoga at the YMCA before), but once getting used to the trainer, i felt more at ease with it.  I would not recommend this DVD to beginners, but rather intermediaries.",1293580800,5,308,4.116666666666666

8421075,5,B004AWPDYM,I love sadies style . and she does a great job explaining poses in a way that everyone feels adept and capable,1380499200,,110,4.045454545454546
8421076,5,B004AWPDYM,I was lucky to have done a yoga class with Sadie Nardini & now that I have her dvd I can do her yoga routine at home or on the road! I love it!!,1368835200,,144,3.264705882352941
8421077,5,B004AWPDYM,Sadie's voice-over is one of the best I have experienced and I have many exercise videos. Instructions are clear and pitched at just the right time during exercise or positions. Her voice is not irritating either. The different positions and exercises to strengthen the core is innovative - really does the job. All levels can attempt these positions/exercises. I would definetely 100% recommend this DVD,1347148800,,404,5.230769230769231
8421078,4,B004AWPDYM,"This is a great, short core workout. Very effective in my opinion. Four stars because there is a little too much talking and I don't think the music even works on my dvd. However, Sadie is charming and you can kind of get used to her talking so much.",1332201600,2,250,4.122448979591836
8421079,4,B004AWPDYM,I was so excited when Sadie released two new dvds I bought them immediately. This one is a 30 minute workout that is targeted at the core. But all of these sequences are also on her other new dvd (Total Body Yoga Sculpt) so you can assemble this workout on your own with your other dvd. I gave this to a friend who had never heard of Sadie Nardini (and by gave I mean forced it on her shouting 'oh my god you have to do this now it is so awesome') and she loves it.,1322870400,2,465,3.8541666666666665
8421080,2,B004AWPDYM,"Unfortunately, I tried to like this DVD, but it is hard simply because Sadie just talk too much. She guides you into a pose but does not allow you time to experience the sensations of your body because she just keeps chatting away. The contradictory thing is that she uses all the ""yoga"" language but this does not feel like yoga, but rather like a workout. The routine itself is fantastic if your goal is to lose weight, and I guess her intentions are good with all that chatting, but maybe in her next DVD, she could add another option with less instructions for those who want more than a workout. That is, for those seasoned practitioners who just want to go deeper and connect with their body and mind during their yoga session.",1315008000,9,733,4.477611940298507
8421081,5,B004AWPDYM,"Per recommendation from other reviewers, I watched this DVD all the way through before getting on the mat to work through it.  I have been doing Yoga with DVDs (Yoga Journal Complete Beginners Guide, Shiva Rea) for approximately 5 months, but still consider myself a beginner.  I was surprised to see all the asanas were very basic poses that I had already been doing with very slight variations.  ""Nice."" I thought, ""This will be a nice addition to my DVD rotation, but nothing special.""

WOW!  Was I ever surprised!  Once I started doing the Total Belly Transformation flows, I discovered those ""slight variations"" made a HUGE difference!  I could feel the difference as I was working out, and the next day I had that good-workout-kind-of-soreness in muscles I wasn't even aware that I had. The claim that ""Sadie's signature style builds your poses from the ground up, which amplifies the benefits of each move so you get more results for the time you spend on your mat than with many other DVDs."" is not hype.

Another bonus for me was that the 30 minutes just flew by.  I usually have a hard time making it through 30 minutes of core work, but Sadie's pacing and way of sequencing the poses really makes it easy to keep going.  If time permits, I can easily set the DVD to ""Play All"" and do the full 45 minutes and feel totally energized when I'm done.

Some reviewers have mentioned that this workout is not for beginners.  I disagree.  Throughout the workout, Sadie will say ""if this is your edge, stop here"" before she moves on to a more advanced version of a pose.  I think this approach makes this DVD much more valuable as you can grow with it.  Sadie encourages you to ""try to go a little further"" each time.  And she frequently reminds you that you can always go into Child's Poise if you need to. Another bonus resource is Sadie's YouTube channel where you can always go for more detailed instruction for any of her ""signature poses.""

So, I recommend the Total Belly Transformation: Whole Body Tone + Deeper Core Strength for any level.  Beginners will certainly learn a lot and benefit from the routines, and I think there is something here for the advanced practitioner as well.",1310860800,11,2194,4.610824742268041
8421082,5,B004AWPDYM,"You might want to review other DVDs or take a beginners class if you have never done yoga.  This DVD is an intermediate/ advanced students type of DVD.  Great background.  The instructor talks about the proper way to enter each pose.  That may or may not be your preference.  I enjoy it to an extent.  I feel the difference in my yoga practice, weight, and strength and am glad to have come across this DVD.  Deepen your practice and try something new.",1310601600,4,452,4.439024390243903
8421083,1,B004AWPDYM,"I've done yoga,pilates, but this was just not it. I didn't feel i got what I paid for. And I won't waste my tim by doing it again.",1306713600,,130,3.6785714285714284
