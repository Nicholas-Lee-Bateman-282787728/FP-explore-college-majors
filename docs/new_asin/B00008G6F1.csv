7982511,5,B00008G6F1,"I enjoyed this dvd very much.  Made in 1989, it mixes traditional choirs and soloists quite nicely.  I especially enjoyed the camera work, utilizing interesting angles and views of each church.  Added in are some snippets of Irish history and poetry which give a truely romantic Irish feel.  Can be enjoyed as festive background music for a party.",1198281600,5,347,4.931034482758621
7982512,5,B00008G6F1,"There is an amazing amount of talent packed into this DVD. There are 36 Christmas music selections. They include standards such as ""O Holy Night,"" ""Silent Night,"" and ""O Come All Ye Faithful,"" as well as a number of beautiful carols that aren't heard too often such as ""The Zither Carol,"" ""Torches,"" and ""Personent Hodie."" Filmed in Dublin and Galway, the outstanding choral groups include the Galway Baroque Singers, the Choristers of Belfast Cathedral and the West Point Glee Club from the US Military Academy. When it comes to soloists, you've got Dennis O'Neill and Bernadete Greevy, and you can't top Catherine Coates - one of the greatest voices in all of Ireland. For two hours of great Christmas music, this DVD should be in your collection.",1101772800,8,749,4.905511811023622
