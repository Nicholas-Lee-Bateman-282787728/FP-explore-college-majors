180438,5,1558908382,"Every scene in John Cusack's movie (he co-wrote, co-produced and stars in it) helps to make it the best movie of the last dozen years.  It's the best human comedy that I've ever seen and the elements of romance and violence  make amazingly watchable.  I could literally see this movie every week.  The humor still makes me laugh ouot loud and the ""discovering  yourself"" plot almost brings tears to my eyes.  Plus, the use of color  and music to enhance the scenes and really highten the level of emotion.  It's an outstanding film.  My favorite and hopefully one of yours.",919123200,,573,4.65
180439,5,1558908382,"I have admired Mr. Cusack as an actor for many years now, and I think that Grosse Pointe Blank is his best work so far. He has gone from playing lovelorn-teenager type characters to this mature, thoughtful,  well-developed character. He is a hitman who is having second thoughts  about his choice of career, and the movie is about the results of that  dilemma. It not only retains the comedic quirks characteristic of  Mr. Cusack's movies, but plays them to the fullest without being over the  top. Also, there are several members of the Cusack family in the movie:  Joan Cusack plays Marcella the secretary, another sister, Anne, plays  Amy(the new mother at the reunion), and Bill Cusack has a short appearance  as a waiter in the Hippo Club. Minnie Drive, Dan Aykroyd, Jeremy Piven, and  a host of others all turn in excellent performances as well. I give this  movie five stars out of five",917654400,,893,4.703225806451613
180440,5,1558908382,"I love this movie! It is THE BEST! It has everything from comedy to romance to action. Not too mention the fact that it has John Cusack! Minnie Driver is also great in this movie. And Dan Akroyd cracks me up. And who  could forget John's awesome sister Joan. She is very funny. If I could only  have one movie, it would be Grosse Pointe Blank because it is great for  whatever mood you are in. My advice...BUY IT!!!",915580800,,415,4.227848101265823
180441,5,1558908382,"This is by far one of John Cusack's best movies. Starring as a hitman who gets pushed into going back to his hometown, High School reunion, and to do a ""job"". He is finally forced to confront his past and challenge his values, while being the hunter and the hunted.  Not only is this film about finding one's self, it is full of humor and a touch of romance. The chemistry of this film is SUPER! IT'S FUNNY,TOUCHING, & FULL OF STARS!  JOHN CUSACK, ALAN ARKIN, MINNIE DRIVER, JOAN CUSACK, DAN AYKROYD and the rest, all give outstanding performances in this excellent film.  END",887760000,,576,4.519230769230769
180442,5,1558908382,"John Cusak has a niche, and Grosse Pointe Blank was his crowning achievement. Somewhere along his later career, he got hungry for the ""serious"" role. The roles that might earn him awards. He has wandered off track, and not embraced the characteristics of his acting that make him truly unique and great. He needs to embrace the unique talent he has, and keep perfecting it! Grosse Pointe Blank IS his masterpiece. Try to trump it!",1518912000,,430,4.746666666666667

This is not a COMEDY -- it is a ""HORROR"" movie. In which comedy movie you see multiple killings -- in cold blood -- without an ounce of parody -- this movie depicts COLD Blooded murders. The hero -- takes a Pen and jabs it in the throat of the victim -- victim dies with blood spurting on the Hero. Hello! Is this American Comedy? -- well if it is -- Buy it, it is a free country.

So, rating-wise, I cant conscience less than five stars. Are the flaws? Yeah, plenty. But this is an original, non-Hollywood boiler-plate film. It will engage those who care.

But, to the BluRay transfer? Dear God, it sucks balls.

Can someone tell me why literally HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of YouTube videos can push me vibrant 4K contest FROM THEIR BEDROOMS (for free, no less) yet the corporate powers-that-be repeatedly fail to transfer 35mm to film with ANY visual clarity?

180449,5,1558908382,"One of my all time favorite films. Great cast, great performances, fantastic music. Music in movies is something I rarely pay attention to. However, the music here is so eclectic and unique and really fits the scenes. Among the highlights of the movie is the hallway fight by the lockers. The fight scene is raw and believable and the music really provides the perfect note of atmosphere. Another moment is the revelation Martin has at the dance and Queen and David Bowie providing the musical backdrop to underscore the moment. Simply beautifully handled.

The very concept of the film is simply hilarious. The humour is fantastic throughout the film. And every  line delivered with perfect timing. It's a great story.",1509580800,,719,4.983333333333333

180456,5,1558908382,"A hit man is getting tiered of his job and intends to retire. In the mean time his last job just happens to coincide with his high school reunion. The local radio announcer is his snubbed girlfriend of how he may have trouble explaining his disappearance and subsequent life. In the mean time he is haunted by the FBI, old assassins, and a rival organization that wants to absorb him.

The first thing that I notice right off with this movie is all the great music in the background. It all seems relevant to the action at the moment. I really liked the driving scenes while playing ""Blister in the Sun."" I liked the music so much that I bought the two soundtracks. It turns out that I just liked the parts of the songs that are in the movie. However I do not like the complete songs that where on the sound track.

Dan Aykroyd was just playing himself. He is a rival organization and always trying to recruit John Cusack. Their negotiations took on a life of their own. There are many twists and turns.

180466,5,1558908382,"After many years I 3rd or 4thish viewed it.  It didn't work, but it was fun to see everyone so young and still putting out hefty productions.  It is a nice love story, but the noir character thingy kinda sticks in the craw......not believer in such instant redemptions due to true love.  Quite the formula that needs quite the proof.

The old school tech is a klutzy scene stealer.

If never seen before, I can't even guess if today's e-minds can relate to this very conventional rom-com......with blood.  Tons of old school Hollywood conceits -- rendering ersatz the validity of every fist fight and every love-tussling argument.

But still -- so many rewards to garner from watching today just to see so many well-known actors at the various stages of their careers...and knowing what they'll evolve into when they didn't at the time of the production coats all of them with an innocence.....which is entertaining.  To me.",1491782400,,924,4.840764331210191

Its a very slick and well made film thats very darkly funny and thrilling with some great action (not to mention one of the coolest fight scenes ever in a movie). The performances are terrific with this being Cusack's best performance and Dan Aykroyd is great playing a character way against type for him. It also features the always enjoyable Joan Cusack, Jeremy Piven and Alan Arkin. A great soundtrack as well. Its expertly directed by George Armitage. Its a shame he hasn't done more movies. This and Miami Blues are both terrific.

180531,5,1558908382,"In the tradition of late 90's comedies, this might well have been a confounding element of the high school movies to follow (""pie""-themed and all). However, it is definitely cooler, and has more depth and complexities by virtue of retrospects. A lot of the punchlines are conceived with gusto and wit - like the Basque separatist killer's last name being ""La Poubelle"", French for ""trash (can)"". Or, of all the Pulp Ficiton cast presented in a cardboard display, only Bruce Willis gets his head shot off. Dan Akroyd is still his old same, while Minnie Driver is one of the iconic beauties of her time. The secondary cast unfortunately all remain one-dimensional characters - being stereotypes further ""cheap"" humor. Many a ridiculous situation ensues. The attempts at social commentary remain weak - unions, ego-shooters, ""made in America"", the education mantras of the time... I cannot say whether these themes struck a nerve at the time, or only stand out as after-thoughts now. Oh, how time flies!",1463356800,,1000,5.030120481927711

The violence is not extraordinary by today's standards - shooting, stabbing, blowing things up and death by TV screen, but the conflict resolution is nothing short of genius humor.

He reunites with his high school sweetheart (played by Minnie Driver) who he stood up at the prom, but still seems to carry a torch for him.

Dan Aykroyd has a delightful role as another hitman trying to recruit Blank into his hitman union so they can band together to raise prices for hitmen around the world. You see, the end of the cold war has created a surplus of hitmen and a subsequent lowering of the price of hits.

There is some over the top fighting and gun play that while not remotely realistic is fun to watch.

180621,5,1558908382,"I love this movie. Grosse Pointe Blank is smart and witty and has a stunning 1980s soundtrack. Martin Blank (Cusack) is an angst ridden international hit-man who has stopped enjoying his work. He searches for meaning in his life and returns to Grosse Pointe, Michigan for his 10th year High School reunion and one last job. Blank meets his mom, some old friends and discovers that his childhood home has been knocked down to make way for a convenience store. He ponders his life choices and has recurring dreams about Debi Newberry (Driver) the girl he stood up on Prom night.

Blank's activities have attracted a collection of hit men trying to find an excuse to kill him. These include Aykroyd, two federal agents and a freelance Basque hit-man. There is a shoot-out at the end and overall the film has a large body count, but Cusack makes Blank seem like a lovable version of Jason Bourne. The film is something of an ensemble piece with great comic performances from Alan Arkin, Joan Cusack, Jeremy Piven and Aykroyd. The film pokes fun at the loner tough guy hero featured in so many Hollywood movies. At the time of its release the story was a little unusual but Mr and Mrs Smith has since explored similar territory of rich cosmopolitan assassins trying to blend into ordinary American life.

Blank spends most of the movie in pursuit of Debi. Will she forgive him? Will he have time to complete his assignment? This is my idea of a great movie. It's funny and clever and the characters are flawed but likable.",1426809600,,1517,4.656716417910448

I found Grosse Pointe Blank better than the later, ""spiritual sequel"" War, Inc. The creators here just had the right elements, creativity, and inventiveness for this film. The new Blu-Ray transfer isn't stellar, but this is a 20 year old film, it's not going to look perfect. The audio is great, hearing the soundtrack clearly is important here.

It's very 90s and has a cute love story in it, but it's not corny at all. Watched the movie with several guy friends and they enjoyed the movie, too, since it had enough blood and action to keep them entertained! Also both main characters are quite witty, and the secretary (Joan Cusack) is hilarious as well!",1425340800,,442,4.6075949367088604

John Cusack and Minni Driver pair off in petulant angst as they rekindle their relationship while avoiding deranged killers, rouge FBI agents and annoying ex-classmates! Dan Aykroyd and Jeremy Piven join in on the fun too, pulling at John Cusack's character like good vs. evil conscience counterparts, further adding to the charm and humor of a film that never quite got the recognition it deserved.

The humor and chemistry he has with Dan Ackroyd is priceless.  It's an all star cast and everyone is spot on with the funny!  Jeremy Piven, Hank Azaria, Minnie Driver, Joan Cusack and Alan Arkin, all give their characters that special quirky touch that makes this movie a classic.

Hitman played by Cusack returns to his hometown the weekend of his 10th high school reunion. Everything has changed. His childhood home is now a convenience store, his mother is institutionalized with dementia and classmates are in various stages of adult life. The only thing that hasn't changed is his fascination with the high school prom date he stood up, played by Minnie Driver.

This is an extraordinarily well-written script, played to perfection by a top-notch cast. We laughed, drank a bottle of red wine, munched on popcorn and called it a fun Friday night. You guessed it! We're well-beyond high school.

Driver and Akroyd were cast perfectly as the ditched-on-prom night-girlfriend and the wanna be assassins club president (don't get me started on Akroyd).

Not really played seriously assuming you can relate to the satire, but not so stupid that it runs the fun either.  I think Cusack and Minnie Driver show some romantic chemistry, and the plot interjecting a high school reunion is tailor made for the characters.

To keep the movie not so serious, the choice of actors for the other hit men was inspired.  Dan Aykroyd was especially good a fast talking psychopathic killer, who wants to start a hit mans union, and tries to sign up Johns character.  Failing that he just wants to limit the competition.  This is one of those quirky movies that some will love and others hate, I loved it, so strong recommend.",1404518400,,809,4.469387755102041

180700,5,1558908382,"Hilarious!  Dark tongue-in-cheek humor, witty lines and excellent acting all add to the fun of Grosse Pointe Blank.  It is a story of a weary professional hitman, with no conscience at all, who is having trouble at work.  He has to make a hit in Detroit and decides to attend his 10 year high school reunion.  He strikes up a romance with his ex-flame who he left waiting for him to take her to the prom ten years ago and finds himself fighting off several hitmen.  Dan Aykroyd is funny as an agressive hitman who has put out a contract on him because he refuses to join his new hitman union.  He also has a hitman from an old client after him because he accidentally killed his dog with a stick of dynamite.  Who knew it was a retriever?

180712,5,1558908382,"John Cusack's one of those actors whose political opinions and forays into infringements on my rights I tend to blow off so long as he produces/acts in roles as good as these.

I delayed my entry into college by joining the Army a year out of high school - college funding wasn't available - and despite earning an associate's degree at night school and some university-level study while overseas, I started college full-time right around the time this movie's class would have graduated HS.  The music, the characterizations, the situational humor I found funny down to my core.  Been there done that.  My ten year reunion found me starting my junior year of college while the people I went to HS with were being offered partnerships in law firms, starting as new cardiothoracic surgeons and ER docs (yeah, it takes ten years of college/med school/residency to get there and I""m not someone who believes health care is a ""right"" for aforementioned duration and devotion of/to training, no moreso than car care, legal care, or plumbing care is a ""right""), but I digress.

Anyone who attended college in the 80s, pretty much anyone who ever graduated high school, and/or went to their ten year reunion should watch this film.  It has a lot going for it.

- the nerds.

- the cheerleader(s)

- the ""I don't know what I'm going to do with my life"" moody character (Cusack)

- global politics

- kick boxing

- the hometown girl

and just a lot of good, twisted fun.

I've watched this at least a dozen times over the years since it was released, and have given copies to my two - remaining - friends from HS.

I've seen the sequel.  Don't waste your time unless you've still got a bug up your a** about Haliburton but a president who lavishes billions on known terrorist organizations and ""clean energy"" cronies and has a kill list (disposition matrix) doesn't bother you, then you'll love it.",1398384000,,1890,4.681818181818182

180714,5,1558908382,"About to assassinate a low-life on a bicycle - Martin Blank points his high-powered rifle, scope and silencer out the elevated open window of his hotel room at his mark - but then gets an interesting phone call on his headset from his handler Marcella. She's just opened a letter that has tickled her pink. As Martin takes aim - she reads out an invite to all alumni from the Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe - the class of 1986 is having a high school reunion dinner and dance - and he's invited. Marcella helpfully suggests that this would be an excellent chance to renew old friendships - maybe open up some new accounts - even meet with that Debi girl he's been obsessing over for 10 years - the cute one he left stranded in a $700 Prom Dress... But unscrewing his silencer after a rival assassin with huge handguns has mowed down his clients on the footpath opposite and thereby snafued his corporate assignment - Martin tells Marcella to shred it and heads off to his shrink Dr. Oatman to discuss the pros and cons of his 'rarified profession'...

What makes ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" so incredibly fresh and funny is the double-whammy of a brilliant script and a perfectly picked cast. John Cusack is ideal as the matter-of-fact contract killer Martin Black (who won't kill Greenpeace activists or dogs), Joan Cusack (John's real life sister) as his ballsy secretary Marcella and the luminously gorgeous Minnie Driver as the love interest. Thrown into this double-crossing mess is Dan Akyroyd - in stunning form as Grocer - another hyper assassin who wants to form a co-op of killers to avoid embarrassing overlaps in their busy slaughter schedule (""Make some money...killing important people...what'd ya say!"").

Then there's Alan Arkin in fabulous frowning deadpan therapist mode (""Have you ever thought of not killing people!""), Jeremy Piven as a high school buddy who lusts after a woman he can't have (""Ten years man!"") and Hank Azaria as a gleeful CIA operative who doesn't care what bad guy he shoots as long as he's the 'good guy' doing it. Piven would in fact later play Cusack's best buddy again in ""Serendipity"" (see separate review for the BLU RAY). And amidst all the explosions and mayhem are rapid-fire discussions about the latest vitamin supplements in cafes as each hides a gun in brown paper bags - worry about the overcrowded marketplace in hired killers - affectionate chats on The Pilipino Dwarf Sisters (""Queens of the hotel hit!"") - endless seeking of answers from Martin's weary shrink about his 'problem' - it's all so bloody good and gigglesome funny.

The overall soundtrack is by Joe Strummer of The Clash - with perfectly placed tunes in-between like Guns `N Roses incendiary cover of McCartney's James Bond theme ""Live And Let Die"" as Martin steps out of his car to find his home has been bulldozed and replaced with a UNIMART CONVENIENCE STORE. DJ Debi (Minnie Driver) from the local town radio station WGPM plays The Specials ""Ghost Town"" as Martin drives around Grosse Pointe wondering where his past has gone (his mother is in a nuthouse and his father has drunk himself into a whiskey grave). But just maybe he can form a lasting relationship on this weird trip and actually enjoy a life that doesn't involve suitcases full of knives, semi-automatics and poison kits... Like the lovely and forgiving Debi says - maybe all he needs is ""a quick spiritual kick to the head...""

The Hollywood Pictures 15th Anniversary Edition on BLU RAY boasts a truly gorgeous remastered print that is defaulted to Full Aspect (no lines top or bottom) and this US title is REGION ABC - so plays on UK and European machines as well as all others.  Audio is English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital while Subtitles are English SDH, Spanish and French. A real shame is the total lack of extras - but the superbly clean and clear print is plenty for me.

Written by Tom Jankiewicz, D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink and John Cusack - and Directed by George Armitage - I saw ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" at the cinema in 1997 and remember the audience loving it to bits - clapping the credits as they rolled up on screen. Re-watching it in 2014 on this cool BLU RAY - not only has it aged very well - but I'd suggest it's become something of a modern day classic.

""I'm serious about this process! Besides...I know where you live!"" Martin says to his alarmed psychiatrist Dr. Oatman.

When I saw it on Amazon Instant Video (finally) I bought it and wasn't disappointed.  I think the plot is well written and the concept of the movie makes it so enjoyable.  John Cusak is great as a troubled hit man trying to recapture his long lost love and Minnie Driver plays the role of a strong and capable damsel in distress that you just have to love her.

I returned to this film after many years to see if it meant anymore than it did in 1998. No. I love John Cusack and Minnie Driver is a good actress. However, I have never seen a film about a hit an who goes to his high school reunion. I applaud the writer for the premise, but somehow, this film never pulls it off. I suppose it was meant to be a comedy of sorts, if killing people is funny for you. There are, indeed, some interesting moments, but most of the film is spent with Blank, played by John Cusack avoiding other hit men who want to kill him. Minnie Driver an old girlfriend he left at the altar of the hight school prom. They carry on, as if he he had gone off to war and just returned. But, the film doesn't have the right moments. They don't mean much. Do you know what I mean?

Actors yet to be stars appear in the film, you can find them, I won't spoil your fun. Too bad there was not a real premise to the film. Kudos to the acting, however.

180728,3,1558908382,"Grosse Pointe Blank (Grorge Armitage, 1997)
[originally posted 22Oct2000]

This is one of those films that seems to have developed a rather wide and eclectic cult following who've seen it a thousand times and think it's the most brilliant thing ever committed to celluloid. Okay, it was amusing in places, and the chemistry was believable, but really, I can't say I see the obsessive qualities.

The plot centers around Max Blank (John Cusack), a contract killer who's very good at his job. Through a series of odd coincidences, he ends up having to do a job in Detroit on the week of his tenth high school reunion in Grosse Pointe. Of course, going to the reunion involves seeing the old flame (Minnie Driver) he never picked up for the senior prom. You can probably guess the rest of that subplot.

Much of the charm of this movie, aside from the Cusack-Driver chemistry, comes from watching a pretty well put together ensemble cast drliver snappy one-liners. Mitch ""after forty years of character acting I'm now serious and must be referred to as Mitchell"" Ryan is perfect as Driver's father, Dan Aykroyd shines as a rival contract killer, three (count 'em!) Cusack siblings have minor roles, Jenna Elfman is... well, blonde, etc., etc.

The plot moves along, there are a number of chuckles, but... there's nothing that really make this movie stand out. It's kind of like the eight pounds of lettuce loaded on every Subway subthere's a good deal of bulk there, and it looks like you're getting a really huge sandwich, but when you're done with it, you realize there was actually a lot less meat than you originally thought. That's not to say that's a bad thing, because the sandwich was still filling. There was just not as much as your expectations led you to believe. ** ",1386892800,,1776,4.753246753246753

The poorly lit scenes are shot in the least engaging, most boring way possible.

Should I have a yen for a John Hughes type of film, then the first two films above tend to inch ahead. But if I'm craving something more subversive, then I must roll with GROSSE POINTE BLANK. John Cusack may have cornered the market on those intelligent everyman roles. He's always presented this impression that complicated gears are always whirring around in his skull. In GROSSE POINTE BLANK, a freakin' delicious black comedy, Cusack's internal conflict has never been more pronounced.

Martin Blank is a burnt-out hit man, and maybe his moral flexibility has at last reached that snapping point. Martin has just botched his last kill. One could tell his heart wasn't in it. His employers are cheesed, royally so. He's given one chance to atone. Accordingly, the next job takes him to his hometown of Detroit.

Martin isn't one for nostalgia. Still, there's that pang of curiosity when he learns of his impending tenth year high school reunion (Class of '86, huzzah!). Check this: Martin Blank is touted as ""Detroit's Most Famous Disappearing Act,"" given that the last anyone had seen of him, he was standing up Debi Newberry on prom night. Down the years, people assumed that he either got murdered or brainwashed or had joined a cult. You'd think it'd be a bit late (and unprofessional) for Martin Blank to develop angst, and yet there it is. In Detroit he can't help but hearken back, and especially hearken back to Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver) who today is a popular radio DJ. She's not afraid to call him out on his past transgressions.

In Detroit, Martin's personal life intrudes into his professional one. And, yeah, maybe it's hard to keep your eyes on the prize when you visit your old home only to find out that it's been torn down and replaced with a homogeneous convenience store. An exasperated (yet philosophical) Martin reflects: ""You can never go home again... but you can shop there."" Lest you think this movie fixates too much on angsty navel-gazing, know that there's ample action to rev up the pace. Martin's Detroit assignment isn't as by the numbers as he'd assumed, not with his rival, Mr. Grocer (Dan Ackroyd), so violently intent on poaching the kill contract. Goes to show, the murder game is such a competitive field. In fact, someone in the film refers to it as a ""growth industry."" Heh. By the way, it's pretty nifty seeing Ackroyd switch things up and get all sinister. Still, the action highlight has to be Cusack's hallway death match with legendary martial artist Benny ""the Jet"" Urquidez. It's just cool to see Cusack in a brutal, drag-out fight, even though, okay, the more advanced moves were probably performed by a stunt double.

Minnie Driver has never been more appealing, and she's got great chemistry with Cusack, and her Yank accent is again impeccable. Their interactions make for some stand-out moments. But then again I find that Cusack has great chemistry with everyone onscreen. His scenes with Ackroyd are marvelous, and I have to reiterate how pleased I was at Ackroyd's unexpected and very effective turn as the big bad. Cusack's real-life sister, Joan, has a nifty bit part as his assistant Marcella. I am become jaded at her history of excellent scene-stealing. I love how she takes these roles that could have been these unassuming roles and steers them down unexpected avenues. Lastly, Alan Arkin made me laugh out loud each time he was onscreen here. He plays Cusack's very, very nervous psychiatrist who finds himself constantly walking on eggshells during their sessions.

John Cusack anchors this thing. He's one of the few really interesting and quirky actors out there today whose movies I'll check out even if, going in, I don't what they're about. He's surpassed Tom Hanks as my favorite contemporary actor some time ago. I love the innate intelligence and the casual humor and the wry, detached approach he applies. It's fascinating watching Cusack work and how he manifests his internal process by virtue of body language and a repertoire of revealing expressions and by nuanced (yet deadpan) intonation. I don't know that there's anyone else out there who can better articulate the role of an assassin-for-hire who develops a conscience. John Cusack can play just about anything, except an idiot. I don't think he knows how to do that.",1362614400,,4806,5.31011826544021

It is a very dark comedy, and as such not everyone will enjoy the humor.

180771,5,1558908382,"Viewing Equipment: Epson 3010 3D PJ on a 92"" DaLite Screen. Given the wide variety of reviews related to the PQ I was a little nervous about picking this one up. Grosse Point Blank is an all-time favorite film of mine and holds up extremely well on repeat viewings.

I actually saw this in theatres when it first came out. Since I also view films on a very large format screen, nothing gets by me very easy. I had an opportunity to view this over the holidays on a family members 106"" DaLite screen opposed to my usual 92"". I must say the PQ was very good! I felt like I was watching a print; not video. I couldn't disagree more with any negative reviews of the PQ. I respect the opinions, but it certainly wasn't the experience I had thankfully. I sat about 15 feet back from the 106"" screen. I noticed a few specks and scratches here and there, but nothing too egregious. I did notice some light ringing in scene or two. The only reason I caught that was because I was scrutinizing it very closely given some of the very harsh reviews I have read related to the PQ. The other thing that I find amusing is the fact that the DVD release of this film is non-anamorphic! You can't even seriously compare the DVD to the BD release of this film! LOL! The BD blows it away! I threw in the DVD first and watched it for awhile to see if I would notice a difference and when I put the BD in there was no comparison. I have seen some crappy BD's, but this isn't one of them. Batman Begins comes to mind. The PQ on that BD was very disappointing in many scenes. I think people tend to unfairly compare stuff shot recently on HD digital cameras and forget what film looks like.

180773,4,1558908382,"Cleverly written screenplays seem to have gone into limbo (the Coens notwithstanding), and ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" appears to be among the last until audience taste improves.

A Government hit man (John Cusak) returns to Grosse Pointe MI, to take out a target, attend his 10th-year high-school reunion, and romance the woman (Minnie Driver) he ran out on ten years ago. What you won't know until you see it is how brilliantly written (and acted) it is.

There's a lot of good scenes, but the standout (for me) is Cusak's session with this psychiatrist. Their ping-pong interaction is so wittily constructed that it makes a screenwriter-wannabe (myself) despair.

I'd love to give GPB five stars, but Cusak's relationship with Driver is not particularly engaging. Other than her hippieish, Leftward-leaning perspective, we really don't know who she is, or why she ever found him attractive in the first place. For this viewer, their bantering (however clever) seems mostly pointless and often interminable. Nick and Nora they ain't. I'm also bothered by the fact that Cusak's target turns out to be someone who can (conveniently) resolve Cusak's problems if he /isn't/ killed. But GPB is a farce, so I suppose I shouldn't complain too much.

The rest of the film, though, is a hoot. Recommended for one viewing -- and multiple viewings of the best scenes (particularly the convenience-store shootout).",1361145600,,1398,5.145374449339207

180781,4,1558908382,"Grosse Pointe Blank is a dark comedy that explores themes such as examining one's own mortality, how far a man's morals will let him go, and the redemptive power of love. This movie manages to masterfully combine the elements of a traditional romantic comedy with enough action to satisfy those seeking the thrill of a shoot-em up buddy comedy. Gross Pointe Blank stars John Cusack, Minnie Driver, Jeremy Piven, and Dan Aykroyd.

Grosse Pointe Blank is a movie about a hit man that feels that he is beginning to lose his touch and his passion for his work as his 10 year high school reunion approaches. Martin Blank (Cusack) returns to his hometown after 10 years for a job to eliminate someone to smooth over an earlier botched hit. Along the way he tries to reunite with his high school sweetheart, Debi (Driver). He meets up with his best friend from high school, Paul (Piven). But Martin quickly discovers that he is being tailed not only by two Federal Agents, but also a rival hitman named Grocer (Aykroyd) who wants to start a cartel for hitmen and will take out anyone that gets in his way, and another hitman hired to take him out for revenge for one of his past jobs.

The soundtrack to Grosse Pointe Blank is filled with hit songs from the 1980s such as ""Blister in the Sun"" by Violent Femmes, ""Under Pressure"" by Queen and David Bowie, and Guns N' Roses cover of the classic ""Live and Let Die.""

Grosse Pointe Blank is rated R due to violence and strong language, so I wouldn't recommend watching this movie with young children, but it is an enjoyable date night movie.",1353283200,2,1581,4.559859154929577

The back cover boasts of an 'astonishing remaster' which, basically, consists of your garden-variety noise reduction, artificial sharpening and edge enhancement. Detail in most scenes (even closeups) is scarce. Some scenes look as if they were lifted from the (not exactly stellar) DVD. Usually even below-par releases have at least some redeeming quality to them, but unfortunately not in this case as far as the picture quality is concerned. The blandness of the image is perhaps what Walt Disney Home Video means by 'astonishing'.

I bought this together with High Fidelity (which, *thankfully*, is a fairly decent and strong-looking release)

Also let me talk a bit about the extras. Wait! There are none. Not even a trailer. The astonishment continues.

The only aspect I would give somewhat high marks for on this disc is the audio, as they have actually managed to not screw this up along with everything else.

180793,5,1558908382,"As a writer, what tends to ""make"" a movie for me is the dialogue.  I thoroughly enjoy watching a movie so many times that I can quote it word for word, and you are only inspired to do that when the words are worth remembering.  George Armitage's Grosse Pointe Blank occupies a top spot in my list of favorite movies to quote.  Other aspects of the movie that make it so re-watchable are the soundtrack, the chemistry between Minnie Driver and John Cusack (and the entire cast, really), and the original plot.  John Cusack is Martin Blank, a professional assassin, growing weary of his stressful job.  Marcella, played by Joan Cusack, is his semi-neurotic but loveable secretary.  Their comedic banter is priceless throughout the movie, and it is her character that suggests Martin go back to his hometown of Grosse Pointe to attend his high school reunion.
  So his eventual--but reluctant--agreement to go is what kick-starts the action in the movie.  I like to suspend disbelief when watching a movie, as long as it stays within the realm of possibility. Likeliness of someone who makes a living as an assassin being a sweetheart and completely sane deep down?  Slim.  It's a very romanticized concept, but it makes for a very interesting character, and a very interesting romance between Martin and Debbie (Minnie Driver).  Nearly every single movie ever made has romance in it, so to spice it up by making the female protagonist have to cope with the idea that her soul-mate has killed hundreds of people for money is, to me, brilliant.  And maybe I find it so brilliant because of Minnie Driver's sheer on-screen genius.  She's as unique and memorable in her acting as she is aesthetically.
 Really, between Joan Cusack, John Cusack, Minnie Driver, Dan Aykroyd and Alan Arkin the movie couldn't have been more perfectly cast to my liking.  Aykroyd as Grocer, the prozac-popping rival assassin with a personal vendetta against Martin Blank and Arkin as Dr. Oakman, the nervous psychiatrist who wishes Martin never told him about his real profession. Each character and respective actor chosen to play them is hilariously successful and also cohesive in relation to the rest of the cast.
 Anyways, Martin Blank's development throughout the movie and his journey to becoming a functioning human being capable of being in a loving relationship with his long lost high school beau has ingenuity and is rife with clever dark humor.
 John Cusack almost always involves himself with the soundtracks of movies he acts in, and Grosse Pointe Blank is no exception.  His keen taste in music shines through Grosse Point Blank's two disc soundtrack, and not to mention Joe Strummer, frontman of legendary punk group The Clash, composed the score for the entire movie AND helped pick out songs for the soundtrack.  The Clash is my favorite band.  This movie was made for me.  And, embarrassing as it might be to admit, I have a huge soft spot for eighties music.  Since the plot of this movie centers around the high school reunion of a class that graduated in 1986, the music that Debbie, a radio DJ, spins all weekend in honor of her old classmates coming home are all her nostalgic throwbacks (aka my favorite songs EVER).  So that was just the icing on the cake for me.
 There's a lot of violence in this movie, considering quite a few of its characters are professional killers, but it's not glorified or even emphasized, it's a necessary part of the plot.  It's downplayed, and almost performed distractedly, in an obligatory way.  In a world where films are saturated in gratuitous sex and violence, this movie is refreshing.  There is beautiful, quirky, fun romance all throughout, but not a single sex scene.  It's unnecessary.  Cusack kills a man with a ballpoint pen, but that action culminates in almost losing the love of Debbie, it isn't macho or rugged.  Lastly, the writing is so intelligent and well done that you end up sympathizing with and relating to an assassin.  Game, set and match.",1339891200,3,3996,4.848082595870206

John Cusack is fantastic as the acidic, sarcastic prodigal son, returning to his home town on business while also giving serious thought to abandoning his violent ways for good. Great supporting work helps that role to flower even further, especially in the forms of his grinning, kill-happy competition, (a joyously nasty dark turn by Dan Aykroyd) the jilted love interest he left high and dry ten years back (Minnie Driver at her most smokin') and his flippant, hard-nosed assistant (Joan Cusack).

Original review: GREAT movie badly needing a HD upgrade considering how poor the standard DVD looks on big TVs.

A black comedy about an ex-CIA, now hitman for hire is a perfect vehicle to showcase Cusack's talents. The world is changing, and as Martin Blank will tell you, countries no longer matter and people are just as likely to be killed over soda pop formulas than political ideology.  Martin tries to rationalize the ""moral flexibility"" that he sees going on in the world, where market-driven globalization means more than patriotism to one's own country, by saying he at least has SOME scruples (for example, he won't take out a hit on a Greenpeace activist).

But only 10 year removed from high school, he's not entirely OK with his new profession.  Some of the funnier side stories involve trips to his psychiatrist (Alan Arkin), who wants to drop him for a client. Blank won't let him, and dryly points out some logical reasons he should be treated, but then also casually states ""and of course, I know where you live"".

When Martin goes back home to Michigan for his 10 year High School reunion he has to face several people who have no idea what he does for a living, including old parents, old teachers, old friends, and old flames. Even when he tells the truth no one takes him seriously, including his buddy played by Jeremy Piven, in what many consider to be his break out role. Minnie Driver does an adequate job as the girl he jilted on prom-night to join the army, but there are a couple of forced scenes added to the movie for ""date night"" appeal where she is made to look fawningly at Martin that should have been left on the cutting room floor. Overall though, this is really a great supporting cast, with Hank Azaria and even Cusack's own sister as his deranged secretary who has a great scene arguing over a misplaced bullet order.

Much of the dialogue comes forth in a fast, rapid style that seems like he's exchanging gunfire in a high stakes shootout rather than talking.  This is especially true when he deals with Dan Akroyd's character, who plays a rival hitman bent on trying to unionize all assassins. ""Workers of the world unite!""  ""Will there be meetings?"", Martin asks. ""Of course!"" Akroyd exclaims as the two continue to circle each other and mentally measure for body bags. Akroyd talks even faster than Cusack, and when the two of them get going the one liners come faster than you can process them. At one point he tells Blank to ""Cut the string Chatty Cathy"". When overdone it can get annoying, but for the most part is balances right.

Michiganders will especially like the movie, stocked with Detroit landmarks and Red Wings jerseys even though most of it was shot in Chicago and not Grosse Pointe. When he goes to visit his old childhood home and discovers it had been turned into a Ultie-Mart, local brands of Stroh's beer and Faygo pop are quickly shot up. Not sure if these were just product placements, a serious attempt to sell the geography, or a clever way to again showcase Martin's notion that the ""McDonaldization"" of the world is destroying a sense of place. They say you can't go back home, but you can make a fresh start in life and make a very funny and entertaining movie along the way.

180807,4,1558908382,"The dark satiric elements of this film are terrific - equating the
moral emptiness of a hit man's career with the moral emptiness of
modern America is spot on. And the guts to make a comedy full of witty
banter and harsh killing is worth admiring. There are also few moments
where Cusack's killer's humanity comes through, and the movie becomes
really affecting.

But there are also moments, and performances that feel arch and pushed,
jokes that get told one too many times, motivations that are vague, and
convenient coincidences. The romance at the center with Minnie Driver,
while having charming bits, never feels very grounded, and the ending
feels like a bit of an easy cop-out.

The film is quite good, bravely odd and dark for a Hollywood film. and
fun, but it sets you up expecting much more of a 'Dr. Strangelovian'
impact than it ultimately has.",1302134400,,857,4.74496644295302

When was the last time Dan Ackroyd made you laugh? Now I confess I am the perfect target market for this movie. I am in the age range where I think the soundtrack is cool and the eighties were a pretty good time. Nowadays of course many people look back on the eighties with rose-colored glasses. Back when teens could be teens without ending up on MSNBC. Back before cell phones let parents track our movements and school security consisted of a bald vice principle with an attitude problem.

The movie is well cast with John Cusack as a professional hit man going to his 10 year high school reunion and Minnie Driver as the girl he left behind. A great supporting cast includes Alan Arkin as a therapist unhappy with a killer for a client (Years before the Sopranos or Analyze This) . The aforementioned Dan Aykroyd as a competing hit man and Joan Cusack as the secretary that both cares and is insane.

The story is very silly and over the top, yet Gross Pointe Blank somehow manages to keep the tone just right throughout the proceedings. Existential silliness adds to the fun rather than distracts. Moreover, did I mention a really good soundtrack.",1268697600,2,1285,4.510729613733906

This new disc appears to be the same disc that was released in 1998, and NOT a new anamorphic widescreen transfer.  On the back of the package, it still lists ""Dolby Digital Surround Sound"" and ""1.85:1 Widescreen,"" the same as it did on the original DVD (and the combo GBP/High Fidelity disc that came out later).  The new 2-disc release for ""High Fidelity"" lists the same bonus features as its original release, and showed as ""Enhanced for 16x9 Televisions.""

It appears the only difference between this release and the original 1998 issue is a second disc with a digital copy for portable video players and updated packaging.  I didn't end up buying it based on the packaging and won't until they release a proper version for 16x9 televisions (hopefully a Blu-ray).

I am extremely disappointed that Disney would even bother to re-release such an antiquated, low-quality DVD with only the most minor of improvements (packaging, digital copy).  Even if they had not added any bonus features (the original release had none to speak of), an updated anamorphic transfer wouldn't be too much to ask.

180818,3,1558908382,"Plot-wise, 'Grosse Pointe Blank' is about professional hit man Martin Q. Blank (John Cusack) going back to Grosse Pointe for his 10-year High School Reunion. His psychiatrist Dr. Oatman (Alan Arkin) refuses to treat him because he is afraid of him, but he persists in calling him, and uses him for a reluctant sounding board for his own ideas about his therapy:

---------------------------
[Talking to his psychiatrist about going to his high school reunion]
Marty: They all have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs, and, you know, they've all made themselves a part of something and they can talk about what they do. What am I gonna say? ""I killed the president of Paraguay with a fork. How've you been?""
=================================================

The real reason he is going to the reunion is actually so he can reconnect with his High School sweetheart, Debi (Minnie Driver):

----------------------
Debi: Okay. So. You're back... a decade late, and... you're on some sort of therapeutic assignment, and you want to sort things out with me. So the question now becomes, do I allow you access to me or... do I call security?
Marty: I don't think that'd be a good idea.
=======================================

Miss Driver is cute and appealing, and she is especially good with quips. Not only do they meet cute, the cuteness continues non-stop, a veritable cavalcade of cuteness:

--------------------------------------------
Debi: So, is there a Mrs. Mysterio?
Martin Q. Blank: No, but I do have a very nice cat?
Debi: Not the same.
Martin Q. Blank: Well, you don't know my cat, it's very demanding.
Debi: It? You don't know if it's a boy or girl?
Martin Q. Blank: I respect its privacy.
====================================================================

Enough already, with the cutie cute cuteness. How about some substance, some epiphany, some revelation:

---------------------
Debi: You know what you need?
Marty: What?
Debi: Shakabuku.
Marty: You wanna tell me what that means?
Debi: It's a swift, spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Marty: Oh, that'd be good. I think.
===========================================

It is kind of a dark comedy, with the juxtaposition of killing for a living with a High School reunion scenario. It is kind of a romantic comedy, with the screw ball reason that the two crazy kids can't be together the fact that he is a professional hitman. Neither of these two kinds of comedies really work for me here. I think that the people who want to see John Cusack are not the same demographic who want to see lots of shooting and things blowing up. The people who want to see that aren't the ones who want to see romantic comedies, not even dark comedies. And they certainly aren't interested in a lot of clever dialogue. And the people who do want to hear clever dialogue don't want to watch a lot of people being shot and see things blowing up.

Maybe John Cusack wanted to make a film like this to see how it feels to be an action hero. Maybe he thought it would pull in fans of different genres. 'Grosse Pointe Blank' isn't a bad movie, and it is quite entertaining, but it just doesn't quite cut it for me. As Bob said at the High School reunion, ""I'm drawing a complete....Blank.""

Anyway, Debi is a DJ, which gives the filmmakers an opportunity to shower us with soundtrack cuts galore. It is like they just wanted to pay homage to the 80's, and how much better the music was than during the 90's. This is actually the best part of the movie. Joe Strummer wrote some music for the soundtrack, and there is also a lot of The Clash and other great music from the 80's:

Minnie Driver plays the girl he admired in high school and who has no idea what he has been doing ever since. Toss in an 80's soundtrack and you've got yourself a film that should appeal to pretty much every thirtysomething. While the assassination subplots bring a fresh ingredient to the genre and is an integral part of the story, the emphasis is on the romance and comedy. As such, the assassin subplot serves as a distraction by the film's close; however, the script is so engaging one might not notice.

Grosse Pointe Blank works on several levels.  For one, John Cusack appearing in a movie about a high school reunion is a nod to the high school flicks that made him famous as an actor.  There are many sly references to his earlier films here; i.e., with the bike messenger (Better Off Dead) and the pen (Say Anything). In that sense the film serves as a ""killing off"" of his image as a teen actor. On another level, the hit man storyline is a great political commentary on the eighties that translates well to the political scene we currently find ourselves in.  All the characters, in fact, are morally compromised by their careers, and in that sense Martin Blank serves as an extreme on a spectrum.  And what really hooked me initially is the straightforward portrayal of career burnout, alienation, and early midlife crisis.",1155427200,,962,4.668639053254438

That being said, the overall theme of going back to high school and having everyone peg you to be the exact same person that you were all those years ago, resonated for me.

My favorite line? Minnie Driver's character seeing her 'long lost love' and trying to identify the emotions felt: ""What is this that I'm feeling? Is it pain? Pleasure? Am I hungry?"" decades later that indescribable gut wrenching feeling took her right back.

Cusack plays Martin Blank, a ruthless hitman who meets with a psychiatrist, played by Arkin, who wants nothing to do with him, lives on the west coast, and recieves an invitation to his 10-year high school reunion in the Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe where he'll have to make amends with Debi, played by Driver, the girl he stood up 10 years ago, escape a goon who's trying to kill him and Grocer, played by Aykroyd, a rival hitman who is forcing him to join a hitman union. Once in Grosse Pointe, Blank is up for one surprise after another including a change of heart, and lifestyle, for the girl that he loves, and his final mark who happens to be her father.

Grosse Pointe Blank is one of my all time favorite comedies. The script is slick and funny, and Cusack simply lights up the screen in his most dynamic performance to date. In addition to that, the fight scene in the school hallway is classic!

The movie, a black comedy, brings to the screen the story of a hit man who never got over his high school sweetheart and who returns home after many years to carry out... a hit.  It is there that he bumps into his ""ex"" and the rest can be seen on screen.

The acting is surprisingly (!) average, the dialogues below average, while the plot is just bearable.

In short:

John Cusack's character was really not the great.

Minnie Driver was unexpectedly plain and bland.

Dan Aykroyd was given terrible lines and a weak character to play.

Joan Cusack's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on.

He sees a psychiatrist, Dr. Oatman (Alan Arkin), who, once he becomes aware of his patient's profession, wants nothing more to do with him. Moreover, a most unlikely, rival hit man (Dan Ackroyd) is on his tail, looking to clear the field of a potential rival.

What's a conflicted hit man to do? Why go to his tenth year high school reunion in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, of course. There, ""Marty"" plans to do his final hit and hook up with his high school sweetheart, Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver), whom he unceremoniously stood up on prom night, ten years earlier. Once he gets there, however, things do not go according to plan, and ""Marty"" is in store for a few surprises.

John Cusack is terrific as the hit man, playing him with just the right blend of sangfroid cool and, at other times, with all the charm of the boy next door. Dan ackroyd is funny as the unlikely, rival hit man. Alan Arkin is excellent as the shrink who does not want ""Marty"" as his patient. Minnie Driver is the least compelling of those cast in this film, as she adds very little to its success. Joan Cusack, John Cusack's real life sibling, more than makes up for the gap left by Driver, however, as she infuses the role of Marcella, ""Marty's"" gal friday, with enough pizazz to shore up the film.

Summary:

Cusack plays the professional killer, Martin Blank. He is sent on a job that takes him to his hometown of Grosse Pointe, Colorado. He is conviced by his secretary, played by Cusack's sister, Joan, to go to his high school reunion. This leads him to find his high school girlfriend, (Minnie Driver) who he abandoned on prom night ten years ago. The whole while he is being tracked by two federal agents and two other assassins.

Review:

I really liked this movie. It was a strange mix of bloody violence and hilarious dry humor that had me rolling around on the floor. Cusack's acting was very good. Alan Arkin's character, Blank's therapist, was amazing. The two federal agents (Freedman and Azaria) were both well developed characters, but were killed rather suddenly towards the end. Benny Urquindez (an impressive matrial artist) played the assassin Felix LaPubelle. The other killer was played by Aykroyd. John's old friend offered comic relief during some serious scenes. He was played by Piven.

Overall, I'd give this movie 4/5. I highly recomend it for everyone... except those who don't like gore.",1117497600,,1299,5.032863849765258

Fans will probably find his portrayal of a whimsical professional hit man a nice departure for the accomplished and sensitive actor.

I would too except I just couldn't get over the disconnect between the sweet personality and the amoral nature of his character.  Of course this is a comedy, indeed a satire and burlesque of hit man films with shootouts (two guns ablazing) and car chases aplenty.

There is also a romance between ex-highschool sweethearts Martin Q. Blank (Cusack) and Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver), and they seem nicely paired.  The story is framed around Blank's disappearance on prom night ten years previous and his sudden and unexpected return on the eve of his ten-year class reunion at Grosse Pointe (Michigan) High School.  His ""profession"" is so unlikely that he can be candid about it and nobody will believe him.  ""I'm a professional killer.""  ""Nice.  I'm glad that's working out for you."" (Okay, I made up that dialogue, but it's close to what's really said.)

Dan Aykroyd gives comedic support in an over-the-top portrayal of a rival hit man always making with the jokes even as the bullets fly.  Funny too with a lot of original shtick is John Cusack's sister, Joan Cusack, as the hit man's strange but conscientious secretary, Marcella.  Alan Arkin has a modest part as Dr. Oatman, Blank's frightened shrink--frightened because he knows what Blank does for a living.

180857,5,1558908382,"This is, for me anyway, the best film Cusack has done. It's filled with a certain realism that you don't find in many films. This is odd because the film is primarily a comedy. Black comedy, mind you, but comedy nonetheless.
Background - Martin Blank (Cusack) is a contract hit-man ten years after his high school graduation. He's lost his taste for 'the business' and wants out. He received an invite to his high school reunion but doesn't initially want to attend. Almost simultaneously, he gets a contract to take out someone in his home town. He decides to kill two birds with one stone and do both. Little does he know that a contract has been put out on him as well.
Story - Blank freaked out at the end of high school and joined the army where he learned to kill. He was loaned out to the CIA where he served as a hit-man before going solo. After ten years of the stuff, he's had his fill and wants out. A fellow hit-man (Dan Aykroyd) Grosser, wants to form a 'Hit-man union' of sorts. Blank declines, so Grosser puts a contract out on him. The film follows Blank as he seeks out his high school sweetheart, avoids assassination attempts, and tries to complete his last hit, which has an interesting twist.
Why I like this film - The conversations Cusack has with the other characters, as well as with himself, are priceless. The dialog is disjointed, much like a real conversation you might have.
Another thing that I liked was the realism of the fight scenes. I'm tired of watching movie fights where the hero and villains trade punches to the face, and neither of them have any blood on them. In one scene in particular, the fight lasts all of a minute (pretty real for a streetfight) and both characters as bloodies and sweating profusely. Very realistic, indeed.
This film is not for people who don't like action, as it's filled with it. Younger children probably shouldn't watch it either because of the excessive violence. Fans of Cusack should like it, as it's filled with intelligent humor.",1087516800,3,2006,4.575

Don't fall for this hopeless, romantic ""bad-ass."" The premise for the movie simply doesn't work- the ""cold-blooded killer has feelings too"" theme. Only someone as pretentious and unfunny as Cusak could think like this. Somewhere along the line, the art of good movie making gets lost.

Cusack plays a very neurotic hitman who has tired of the hitman game. After a stint in the military, he found he had a very unique talent: he is very good at killing people. He's made a very good living, but he is tired of the pressures of his profession (apparently there is a lot of competition in the hit man industry). He tries to sort his life out with a very reluctant therapist (the hilarious Alan Arkin) and decides to attend his high school reunion.

- Dan Ackroyd has an over-the-top role as head of a Hitmans' Union.  It's an absurd, demented role that fits Ackroyd like a glove.
- Jeremy Piven turns in his usual solid stuff as Cusack's high school buddy (okay, not much of a stretch there, but no one does these roles like Piven).
- And, of course, Joan Cusack is her usual hilarious self as Cusack's Admin.
The delight of the movie is the delicious satire of wrapping the most non-professional of all ""professions"" (hitman) in the trappings of the modern world.

With one exception: Grosse Point Blank.
The theme here (a hit man with a burgeoning conscience decides to go to his 10-year high school reunion but has to deal with a hit man union out to get him at the same time) sounded promising, and as with most Cusack movies has a great soundtrack plus some pretty interesting lines. You may and probably will have a very hard time believing that Cusack is a hit man.
It is a black comedy, hence pretty violent, and they weren't kidding about the ""grosse"". The ending is particularly unsettling, with Cusack and his snappy patter blowing away the bad guys.
But that's not to say that there aren't good points. Dan Aykroyd is interesting, Alan Arkin is always welcome, and Minnie Driver pitches in some of the movie's high points of humor. The saving grace really has to be the music if you care about 80s tunes.

Believe it or not, the movie is also very educational. I frequently use the the convinent store scene to make my son appreciate what happens to someone who spends too much time on video games, and the scene with what Cusack  did to the TV set in the end to show the effects of watching too much TV !

180872,5,1558908382,"If I'm correct, after this movie came out, all the big Cusack fan sites started. Coincidence? I think no compadre. I know I definatly fell head over heels for John Cusack after this movie, not only because of his performance, but because he also wrote the movie, produced it, and supervised the soundtrack (which also kicks some serious boo-tay, featuring some great 80s hits such as: ""Blister In the Sun""-by The Violent Femmes, and ""Rudie Can't Fail"" by The Clash. A little trivia for you...When John Cusack and his buddies at New Crime Productions were writing the script to this movie, they kept The Clash in mind throughout and had Joe Strummer write the score for the movie.)
 I was a little dispointed in the DVD version of this movie because of the lack of extras. I was hoping for some commentary or deleted scenes, but alas, all you are left with is the trailer and some ""suggested titles,"" which bore everyone to death. Still, it is wide-screen and the movie is amazing by itself so the rating will not be lowered.
 I'm sure everyone viewing this review has seen the movie, but I'll outline the plot for the unblessed among you.
Plot: Martin Q. Blank doesn't know what to do with his life. He has the money, car, but his life feels empty. His therapist reminds him that the angst over killing a lot of people might have something to do with this (He's a lonegunman, professional killer, hitman, however you'd like to describe that profession.) He and his assistant (a brilliant Joan Cusack...what great genes that family has) tell Martin to go back to his high school reunion on the way to do a hit to reunite with his old girlfriend...the one he ditched on prom night and has not stopped dreaming about since. Chaos insues when after not joining a hitman's union fronted by Grocer (a phycotic hitman with frayed nerves), plans to kill Martin by siccing Feds on him after he performs his hit. In the process of reuniting with Debbi, (Minnie Driver, love that woman, she is funny and great in this movie) he realizes that there is so much more to life that he overlooked. It so cute when he holds that baby at the reunion...he realizes the value of human life when he looks into the baby's eyes...a very touching moment.
Does Martin deserve a second shot? (Bad pun, I know) Will he redeem himself? What will Debbi do when she finds out what he really does for a living? Will Martin ever live down his shame at being know as ""poodle puncher?"" Watch the movie one time to find out, and twenty more times for fun and the joy of seeing John kick some butt (he does all his own kick-boxing stunts that he learned in Say Anything...his kick-boxing instructor also plays the ""thug"" that is trying to kill him) and wear all black suits. Great plot, witty dialogue, wonderful cast, plus John's friend George Piven's in it. Amazing John movie, definatly in my top five list.",1063238400,9,2873,4.576699029126214
180873,3,1558908382,"I was told this movie was Lloyd Dobler, of John Hughes' ""Say Anything"", ten years later, but it isn't. (That would have been a much better movie.) Instead, a guy flips out at his highschool grad, becomes a contract killer and is approaching fatal burn-out when he has to go to his ten-year reunion while dodging assassins.
This is one of those movies which is supposedly about the moral emptiness and disgustingness of a life of violence, but the assassination scenes are the most stylish and exciting scenes. The protagonist even claims that if he comes to you, you must have done something to deserve it (probably). At least in John Woo movies, he makes the point that innocents are hurt in this kind of gunplay.
The action scenes are linked together by highschool reunion jokes, and the material seems to be stretched to fill in the time. There's also some elementary screenwriting errors (did they dispose of the basque-whacker's gun or not?) and the writers apparently don't follow Chekov's axiom that if you introduce a loaded gun, it must be used by the end of the scene.
John Cusask does a great job with what he's given. He can still do that deeply sincere monologue, as he does a couple of times while still strung out on adrenaline. Imagine Lloyd Dobler coming off a three-day meth session.
Minnie Driver, as the girlfriend Cusack's characer dumped ten years ago, is appealing, but she's not sharp or beautiful enough to make her worthy of coming back after ten years. Let's just say she's no Ione Skye.",1062979200,2,1514,4.716981132075472

One of the most well-written scripts of the 90's, in my opinion, doesn't work without John Cusack being cast as Martin Blank. He sold the role perfectly, and shines throughout the film, alongside a witty, phenomenal supporting cast of Minnie Driver, Jeremy Piven, Dan Akroyd and Joan Cusack.
Often mistaken as completely morbid, the film takes on not only a tone of humor, but that of vengance and morality. You must see this film.
The DVD, on the other end, [stinks]. Yet another incredible film thrown out there on DVD with a poor transfer and a trailer for an extra. The film sounds fanastic though, and scenes such as the Akroyd/Cusack gunfight and the destruction of the mini-mart can be greatly enjoyed with a good surround sound setup.",1051833600,49,975,4.641618497109826

180878,5,1558908382,"One of the few comedies that doesn't feel like you're being spoon-fed joke after joke.  Grosse Pointe Blank sets you up with the obvious comedic ploy of a hitman returning to his high-school reunion, but that's where the obvious stops.
The movie is about Cusack's character coming to grips with emotion.  Not his emotions necessarily but emotion as a concept, and how it pertains to reality.  He feels it nagging at himself but is unsure or unwilling to admit what it is.  His homecoming is a return to where he left that part of himself behind.
Cusack's character begins to see himself as justified as he keeps running into people and situations that illustrate the absurdities of everyday ""normal"" life.  Through his old girlfriend and a few others, however, he begins to see the importance of connecting with people.
The ending device is rather contrived, but it was really the only way to advance the plot, and very very few movies can hope to escape some contrived story element to make a movie a contained package.
Grosse Pointe Blank has just enough ethical conflict, humor, action, and intelligence to make it a very entertaining movie without bogging itself down in anyone of the above too much.",1046736000,,1204,4.825242718446602
180879,1,1558908382,"GROSSE POINT BLANK is an astonishingly unfunny movie, with shallow characters, unbelievable emotional situations, ill-timed and obvious comedic efforts, and the always unwelcome Dan Aykroyd. Even Alan Arkin is wasted as Cusack's psychatrist (a *hitman* is seeing a *psychatrist*! Get it? Get it?). The hitman-goes-to-his-high-school-reunion concept is mildly interesting-- would've been funnier as a five-minute SNL or MAD TV sketch. Here, the movie grinds along for an hour-and-a-half to no discernible satisfaction whatsoever.

John Cusack is always likeable, but isn't believeable *at all* as a professional killer. Minnie Driver's character seems like just a way for Cusack to get his favorite music into the film. I found their ""relationship"" to be forced at best, and never believed these two belonged together or that real people, hitmen or not, would behave this way.

The violence in the film doesn't jibe with its sarcastic, supposedly comedic tone, adding to the viewer's disorientation. The climactic showdown is noise for the sake of noise, suddenly trying to switch gears into a crime caper and failing miserably.

This is a plodding mistake of a film, one I found painful to watch (particularly any scene in which Driver and Cusack engage in ""witty"" banter) and even more painful when I think about how the great soundtrack, made up of British punk, new wave, and ska (the Clash, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Specials) is utterly wasted. GROSSE POINT BLANK is as bad as I thought it would be when I saw the trailer for it in 1997 and avoided it then. I should've stuck with my first impression.",1041638400,13,1611,5.141221374045801

The idea that throughout the whole movie, Martin tells people straight up what he does for a living (kill people) and they don't react in any way until they see him actually kill someone is a hoot.  Combined with all of the witty  subplots, this movie really engages me.
In addition to the fun script and acting, the soundtrack is perfectly matched to the mood of the movie.  I can no longer hear any of the songs played in the movie without thinking of GPB, a sign of a well done sound track.  If you buy one John Cusack movie, I'd be stumped between recommending this movie or better off dead, but I'd go with this one simply as its a tighter movie overall.",1036281600,,832,4.301282051282051

Gross Pointe, I guess its somewhere in Michigan, suburbs of Detroit the Motor City, home of Rock and Roll, or at least the Detroit-ites may say so.  Minnie Driver is a cool local yokel radio announcer with her own stream-of-consciousness style.  Martin Blank, played by Cusack, is a professional killer.  Now wait right there, he's a professional killer with scruples mind you; he turns down a hit on a Greenpeace boat, so he can't be all bad.  Regardless of the profession, he has come to a place in life (it just so happens to coincide with his ten-year high school reunion) where he realizes he is a man without a rudder, without a moral compass, without a woman to love (at least one that he sees daily), and quickly losing his job satisfaction...the joy of the kill, so to speak.
There's everything to love in this movie.  There's dry witty humor.  There's originality in spades.  It just reflects the sad state of affairs in Hollywood that this movie tries to be everything...comedy, love, drama, violence.  Did I say violence?  Well with a professional hit man as the lead what did you expect?  Don't worry you Amazonites out there that are movie purists, the shooting and action is all tongue and cheek, all ""they wouldn't let me make this film unless I threw in some gratuitous action"" purity.  If this sounds like an incoherent rant, it is.  But then so is Cusack's dialogue spewing forth philosophy, spewing forth regrets and hope, spewing forth unique words and an even more unique take on life.
I broke in to the digital age recently by getting a DVD.  Grosse Pointe Blank, along with High Fidelity, and Pearl Jam's Single Video Theory were on the short list for first buys.  Grosse Pointe stands out (second to Pearl Jam of course...hey it's Pearl Jam) as a favorite.  It's not a work of art, though very stylishly done...it's something more: a movie to love and quote.  A movie to curl up to and claim at the office...that's my favorite.
It's got 80's underground playing along in the background with Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Clash, Bowie, the Violent Femmes.  If you were born in the late 60's, graduated in the mid to late 80's, the movie will take you back with some nostalgia, all the while being modern, all the while making you laugh and fall in love with Driver just as Cusack does.  What more can you ask out of a movie?  See it...you'll see.",1033516800,,2587,4.666666666666667
180884,5,1558908382,"This 1997 dark comedy is a great flick. John Cusack plays a former government agent turned independent hit man who has had enough, and is goaded, by his secretary (played by Cusack's sister Joan) to return to his 10th year High School reunion in Grosse Point, Michigan. This plan is seconded by his psychiatrist (Alan Arkin) who thinks it's a great idea for Martin Blank (John Cusack) to get away from ""the business"" for a while.
There, he's forced to confront the life he left behind. A life that has changed dramatically - his childhood home is now a mini-mart and the girl he abandoned on prom night (Minnie Driver) has become a local radio show host.

180886,5,1558908382,"It is not easy to make a murderer a sympathetic and likeable character, but this movie succeeeds in doing just that.  As Blank, Cusack does a great job portraying a professional killer who is beginning to get disillusioned with his job.

During this period of spiritual blight, Blank gets an invitation to his high school reunion, which also happens to be near where his next job should be.  Since he disappeared right before his senior prom, he knows that there will be some fences to mend, in particular with his abandoned prom date, played by Minnie Driver.
This is all brilliant comedy, as Blank tries to reunite with his old love and think about a more legitimate life, all the while pursued by government agents and other killers.  There are a lot of great lines and funny moments and this is a showcase for Cusack, who, while always a great actor, particularly shines here.

He sees a psychiatrist, Dr. Oatman (Alan Arkin), who, once he becomes aware of his patient's profession, wants nothing more to do with him. Moreover, a most unlikely, rival hit man (Dan Ackroyd) is on his tail, looking to clear the field of a potential rival.
What's a conflicted hit man to do? Why go to his tenth year high school reunion in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, of course. There, ""Marty"" plans to do his final hit and hook up with his high school sweetheart, Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver), whom he unceremoniously stood up on prom night, ten years earlier. Once he gets there, however, things do not go according to plan, and ""Marty"" is in store for a few surprises.
John Cusack is terrific as the hit man, playing him with just the right blend of sangfroid cool and, at other times, with all the charm of the boy next door. Dan ackroyd is funny as the unlikely, rival hit man. Alan Arkin is excellent as the shrink who does not want ""Marty"" as his patient. Minnie Driver is the least compelling of those cast in this film, as she adds very little to its success. Joan Cusack, John Cusack's real life sibling, more than makes up for the gap left by Driver, however, as she infuses the role of Marcella, ""Marty's"" gal friday, with enough pizazz to shore up the film.
All in all this is a surprisingly entertaining film. Unfortunately, the DVD offers next to nothing by way of special features.  Do not, however, let this deter you from buying this funny and unusual film.",1021852800,10,1617,4.556701030927835

But after watching 4 of Mr. Cusack's movies back to back, I have to say that he is one cool cat!!  In this movie, he had to walk a fine line between being too cool or too labored.  He's neither.  As a hit man, he is still able to portray emotions as an everyday man seeking meaningful relationships.  But when the profession calls for action and precision, he's totally capable.
This comedy succeeded in many levels: 1. great balance in mixing genres, 2. chemistry between characters, 3. comical talents of its cast members, and 4. the pace the filmmaker set.

  The film follows the high school reunion dilemma of Cusack's character, Martin Blank, who has to balance his desire to return to his home town of Grosse Point and meet his old girlfriend, with his unconventional dayjob of professional hitman. Minnie Driver plays the love interest, and the other cast members provide able support - and yes, this even applies to Dan Ackroyd!
  The movie works so well because we like most of the characters in it! Cusack's character is obviously disfunctional, and the early scenes with his adopted psychiatrist Alan Arkin are hysterical. The scenes with his real-life sister Joan, all held over the phone, also are played mostly for laughs, as she arranges his next 'job' as if it were the most normal thing in the world. And yet at the heart of this there lies a story of unrequited love, and therin lies its soul.
  The violence in the film is slickly done, and not over-glamourised, apart from the action-comedy fest that is the store shoot-out scene, where the store attendant plays out his fantasy violence on a video game while behind him all hell is breaking loose for real. It also features quite possibly the most realistic martial arts fight scene ever committed to celluloid as Cusack has to fight for his life in the corridor of his old school with a rival hitman sent to kill him. Joe Pesci's imaginative use for a pen in 'Casino' is re-visited here, so be warned!
  However the film as a whole is more than the sum of it's parts. It features little observations of how we all change, and I'm sure anyone who has ever been to their own reunion will recognise characters in the film from their own lives. The bottom line is that the film just works, and while it was never going to be palatable enough for mainstream American viewing, it has gained a sizeable cult following both in the USA and Europe where it's dark edge is more appreciated.
  Intelligent, well-acted, witty, dark, and violent at times. This is a movie with an edge, and an attitude. If it could wear shades, they'd be designer Ray-Bans. Just a cool movie! Enjoy!",1016841600,3,2355,4.599045346062052

Even some people I know who like Denis Leary and other types of dry and/or black humor can't stand this movie (while a cousin who prefers light, romantic ""chick flicks"" loves it - go figure).  Apparently there is some sort of genetic code that determines if you will like this movie...

You will know within 30 minutes if this is your type of movie, and if you can't appreciate Dan Ackroyd as a hit man trying to unionize his colleagues, then I don't really know what more I can say to make you like this film.
A word of advice, though:  this is not an ""obvious"" movie. While there are a few action scenes with a 7-11 being blown up and a fight or two, as well as a romance that is reasonably predictable (given that the male is a hit man), most of the humor comes from appreciating each scene in the larger context.  Is a guy who's trying to win back a high school flame anything original?  No, but a guy who's trying to do that while trying not to mention that he dropped out of sight to become a hit man is hilarious.",1001116800,3,1383,4.239543726235741

In ""Grosse Pointe Blank"", John Cusack plays Martin Blank, a hit man who's always on assignment.  Always dressed in nothing but a black jacket and tie, Martin goes all over the place, doing the dirty work for others.
Martin decides that he wants to stop being a hit man and settle down.  Knowing that he has to do one last assignment, he decides to go to his high school reuninon, and patch things up with his lost love.
Sounds simple, right?  Wrong!  When Martin gets to town, he finds out that there two FBI spooks just waiting to plug him full of lead as soon as he does something illegal, a creepy thug who wants him dead, and a another hit man who has completly lost it who wants him to breathe no longer.  Will Martin be able to patch things up with his true love and make it to the reuninon, or will he end up in a body bag?
This movie is filled with nonstop comedy, twists after twists, and some really cool shoot outs.  ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" is a phenominal dark comedy that doesn't fail to make one laugh.

In this film, he is the ultimate loner, a professional hitman, with very little to brag about at his 10-year high school reunion.  He can't even figure out what to tell people who ask him where he's been for the past 10 years, so he tells them the truth, but nobody believes him.
Cusack's character, Martin Blank, is filled with angst, and trying to work this out in therapy.  Unfortunately, his therapist (brilliantly underplayed by Alan Arkin), doesn't want to talk to him ever since Blank told the good doctor what he does for a living.  The interaction between Cusack and Arkin in this film is much funnier and more real than the Billy Crystal/Robert DeNiro shtick in ""Analyze This.""
The heart of the film is the relationship between Blank and his high school sweetheart (Minnie Driver), whom he stood up on prom night 10 years before and never contacted again.  Blank is emotionally repressed and morally confused (which is why he is well-suited to be a hitman) but Driver is still crazy about him, not believing his statement about his chosen profession.  She has some huge trust issues though, what with being stood up on prom night, and all.  She is somewhat willing to give him another chance.  The playfulness of their interaction is charming, especially when it's tinged with irony and distrust.  She doesn't want to have sex with him right away, but she would like an ""airplane."" (he holds her up with his feet while she pretends to fly)
The climatic scene, where Blank declares his love for Driver, acknowledges his own considerable shortcomings, and promises to change, meanwhile engaging in a gripping, over-the-top shootout with the bad guys, is absolutely perfect for what Cusack's character is about: he can't express himself unless he's pumped full of adrenaline in a battle to the death, but he doesn't want to stay trapped in this way of life.
All of the actors are wonderful, especially Joan Cusack as John's office manager and the person who needles him into going to his reunion and rejoining the human race.  Dan Akyroyd is also a hoot.
Everything works in this movie.  It's a black comedy/screwball romance/action flick with subtle, clever dialogue, cool music and beautiful scenery.  It is completely irreverent, but hopeful and life-affirming, as well.",995932800,29,2453,4.867788461538462

He ends up going back home to do his final job when he meets up with the girl (Minnie Driver) he stood up on prom night and ends up going to his ten-year high school reunion. During his visit, Martin is threatened by rivals and must watch his back to make it out of Grosse Pointe alive. Plot twists and turns come about and it's hard to predict what happens next.

And Grosse Pointe  Blank is definitely a keeper. Black comedy with some verve is very, very  hard to do well, but here the hard thing to do is find a flaw. The  characters are interesting and don't act in predictable ways. The casting  is right on (I even liked Minnie Driver in this and I usually don't much  care for her). Everyone plays their role with just the right level of  intensity - it would have been very easy to overdo this (Dan Ackroyd,  especially, could have gone totally overboard but instead he plays a very  disturbed person just so, and we end up believing him; in less talented  hands, that character would have been a mess). In fact, if anything the  cast errs on the side of downplaying the oddness they're all swimming in (a  must for a good black comedy).

Grosse Pointe Blank had the perfect mix of violence and comedy.  Neither overwhelmed the other and John Cusack seemed to handle it well  too.
The thing I like best about this film is the photography. There are  some really cool shots that are not the norm for action or comedy movies. I  could have been a little longer. A long film does not always guarantee a  good film but this film was so good the running time just seemed to fly  by.
There should have been more of Jeremy Piven though. I like him and  his role in this movie was quite funny. But unfortunately he was just a  supporting player.

The acting is  superb - right down to Cusack's shrink (who Cusack visits when not actually  having an appointment).Dan Aykroyd is a joy as the bad guy and the plot  which brings them all together is fantastic. A quick premise is this:  Cusack is hitman Martin Blank, and Minnie Driver the high-school sweetheart  he dreams about but hasn't seen in 10 years - until the reunion at Grosse  Pointe. He combines the reunion with a job he's been contracted for in the  town but the complication is that Dan Aykroyd is thrown in to the equation  and the surprises, action and comedy from then on is brilliant.

180912,4,1558908382,"A one time Government agent turned independent contract killer, in need of some time off and a career change, goes home for his ten-year High School reunion in ""Grosse Pointe Blank,"" a black comedy from director George  Armitage.  Martin Blank (John Cusack) is on edge; two dissatisfied  customers and a competitor want him off the board, and his life is somehow  unsatisfying.  He's become ""dispassionate, bored and uneasy.""  When he  receives an invitation to his reunion, he is encouraged to go, first by his  secretary, Marcella (Joan Cusack), and then by his analyst, Dr. Oatman  (Alan Arkin), who tells him to go and have a good time:  ""Don't kill  anybody for awhile, see how it feels.""  When one of his unhappy customers  demands that he take a contract to make amends for what they consider a  botched job, and it coincidentally turns out to be in his home town, that  cinches it; he's off to Grosse Pointe, Michigan, to take care of business  and reevaluate his life.  When he hits town, he runs into an old flame,  Debi (Minnie Driver), the girl he stood up on prom night, after which he  subsequently vanished into thin air for the next ten years.  It was the  very night he ran off to join the army, which lead him to his current  ""vocation"" when his psych profile indicated that he had a certain ""moral  flexibility.""  Quickly, the old flame reignites between Martin and Debi,  but there's a complication; Debi's father, Bert (Mitchell Ryan) is Martin's  intended victim, the fact of which Martin is thus far ignorant, because he  hasn't yet opened the dossier he's been given, which contains the details  of the job.  John Cusack gives a magnetic performance as the somewhat  apprehensive Martin, whose cool stoicism is beginning to erode in the face  of some personal misgivings concerning his chosen occupation.  He plays him  for what he is, just a working guy, no different than the postman or a  grocery clerk; and it's that realistic approach that makes this character  believable.  Minnie Driver is delightful here, thoroughly engaging as Debi,  giving her just the spark that's needed to make the connection between her  and Martin real.  Alan Arkin, too, brings his own style of dry humor to the  part of the anxious Dr. Oatman, who refuses to treat Martin (he's  admittedly afraid of him, as well as intimidated), but who has to, because  Martin keeps showing up at his office at the same time every week.  And  Joan Cusack adds that something extra with an energetic, funny performance  that raises the level of the movie just that much more.  Rounding out the  supporting cast are Dan Aykroyd, who does a good turn as Grocer, the rival  killer whose efforts at forming a ""union"" for the independents of their  profession are all for naught; Hank Azaria (Steven), K. Todd Freeman  (McCullers), Jeremy Piven (Paul), Ann Cusack (Amy) and Jenna Elfman  (Tanya).  With a driving soundtrack integrated into the action, clever  dialogue, some good action sequences, and especially the performances of  Cusack and Driver, ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" is a funny, entertaining film; and  with some imaginative touches by Armitage, who does a great job of keeping  the story on track and moving along, this is one you're going to be glad  you didn't let pass you by.",960681600,5,3276,4.822784810126582
180913,5,1558908382,"This is a film which you can watch time and time again, but why is it such a good movie. It's got no CG, little special effects, and it's shot mostly in the one location. But what it does have is a story, which is not too far  fetched and maybe one, which we can relate to. In our busy lives do we ever  get time to stop and look back on our past, how are lives have turned out,  and if were happy. It's this message that underlies this black comedy about  a hit man on his final job, returning home, facing his decade old past and  the people he left behind. It makes you stop and think, what have become of  the people you used to know and ultimately left behind, and what have they  done with their lives. The story is excellent both in content, and  execution by John Cusack, (who also co-wrote the script, and starred along  with a good proportion of his family) and Minnie Driver. A story of love in  modern times with deeper meaning summarises this film. This film is a  classic in the making, it's one which you can add to your collection  knowing you've made a good purchase, and one you can watch over and over  again.

180914,5,1558908382,"Those of us who review films on sites like this often feel (or at least I imagine we do) that we should be awarding five stars to movies we think are all-time classics, like Bresson's ""Pickpocket"" or Godard's  ""Le Mepris"".  And yet, when we look into our hearts and ask  ourselves what films we'd actually like to pull out and watch of an  evening, we (or at least I) tend to find that the films we really love are  of quite a different kidney.  Like this one.
I went to see this in the  cinema with my quondam girlfriend when we were both in a bad mood and  suffering from various non-relationship-related troubles.  We walked out a  couple of hours later feeling cleansed, relaxed, happy and just that bit  much more in love with each other.  You wouldn't think that a romantic  comedy about a professional killer could have that effect on people, but it  can.  I (we) am (are) living proof.
This film masquerades as a cool, flip  comedy about Martin Blank (Cusack), dead-eyed hitman, and his return to his  home town for his high school reunion, during which he meets the former  love of his life, Debi Newberry (Driver).  It's actually a  military-industrial grade stress-test of the human capacity for love and  renewal.  The comedy arises from that late-twenties feeling that you wish  you could return to your past with a genuine sense that you've done  something amazing in the meantime.  Martin actually has, in that he's  killed loads of people.  Throughout the film, Cusack is constantly  informing people that he's a professional killer, and they refuse to  believe him.  He struggles towards some sort of budget-priced redemption  whilst being trailed by a psychopathic Basque terrorist (named La Poubelle,  which means ""dustbin"" for non-French-speakers), two bumbling  government spooks and an even more amoral rival hitman (Dan Aykroyd in  sleaziest form).  It's more than just a comedy, and I'm aware that I'm  coming across as a Kevin Smith character here - it's a work of blooming  art.
Confession: an American friend of mine worked in John Cusack's  theatre company New Crime so I am perhaps biased in favour of this  effortlessly hippest and sharpest of actors.  But when you look at the 80s  teen comedies that he helped to carry, they stand up quite a bit better  than many of the other ones out at the time; and he continues to be  involved in class stuff.  More power to him.
Riddled with  oh-so-nostalgic 80s hits (nostalgic at least for those of us who grew up  during that uniquely repellent decade), there isn't a single minor  character who isn't beautifully sketched.  The cast is fantastic (Minnie  Driver is as luscious as ever and is thoroughly convincing for such a nice  English girl, Joan Cusack is wonderfully droll as her real-life brother's  worried secretary, Jeremy Piven is a splendid sidekick and Alan Arkin does  a lovely turn as Martin's terrified shrink) and the dialogue is as crisp as  fresh lettuce.  The only slight problem is a broad range of sound level;  it's hard to catch every line unless you turn the volume up really loud.  But otherwise, a fab movie, and George Armitage's best work since the  notably funky ""Miami Blues"", which is one of the few films  (besides ""Glengarry Glen Ross"") to unleash the malevolent genius  of Alec Baldwin.  Watch it with a partner, a bottle of good Scotch (if you  happen to indulge) and a prestige snack of your choosing.",960508800,6,3412,4.769363166953529

The killer-shrink exchanges are extremely funny, pre-dating the  similar-concept 'Analyze This' and the execrable 'Gun Shy' by a couple of  years.  There's quite a bit of unabashed hardcore violence and gore, but  what makes the film interesting is the human side Cusack brings to his  hitman - the dance hall scene full of wry, awkward social humour and the  scenes with his mother and psychiatrist are particularly good.",958953600,,646,5.203883495145631

180917,2,1558908382,"""Grosse Pointe Blank"" follows in the footsteps of Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"".  It's about a hit man, Martin Blank (John Cusack) who returns to his hometown of Grosse Pointe for his high school reunion.  There he meets up with an ex-girlfriend (Minnie Driver)  who he ditched at the prom ten years ago and hasn't seen since.  At the  same time, a competing professional killer (played by Dan Ackroyd) has put  a hit out on Martin, because he refuses to join up with him.  So Martin's  always looking over his shoulder.  Occasionally he phones his shrink (Alan  Arkin) for advice.
If you haven't already guessed, ""Grosse Pointe  Blank"" is a comedy.  This is the kind of movie where people don't  connect very well, so when Martin is inevitably asked what he does and he  answers honestly, ""professional killer"", it doesn't even register  - everyone's so self-involved.  John Cusack (who was terrific in ""The  Grifters"" - a much better film) is appealing, though, in a cool sort  of way.  It's directed by George Armitage, who did ""Miami Blues""  a while back - a film I also liked.  And there's a hip soundtrack that  features Violent Femmes, The Clash, and The Specials among others.

Having the Minnie Driver character confront the old  beau who stood her up for the prom live on the air (when he happens to be  the PARTICULARLY secretive sort) was an inspired touch.
Most of the other  reviewers have summarized this terrific black comedy adequately, so I just  wanted to add my special appreciation for John Cusack.  Lots of folks  remember him from ""say anything,"" but my admiration goes back a  year before that, to John Sayles's ""Eight Men Out.""  There was a  lot to like in that movie, especially the outstanding cast (from David  Strathairn to John Mahoney, not to mention Studs Terkel and Sayles  himself), but as the emotional center of the plot, the relatively unknown  Cusack blew everyone out of the water.  It's been great to see him grow,  from ""Bullets Over Broadway"" and ""City Hall"" to  ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""The Thin Red Line.""
What  is especially amazing about Cusack, especially in this role as a  professional killer at the center of a romantic comedy, is that he never  looks like he's WORKING HARD.  It all appears so natural and  effortless.

Too bad  the DVD isn't up to par.  It has next to zero extras.  But even that could  be passable if the picture was good.  First of all, the movie is  non-anamorphic.  That doesn't make a difference unless you have a 16x9  television, it'll look the same on a regular tv, it's just a pet peeve of  mine.  But, the transfer we did get is just pathetic; it looks like a (bad)  laser disc transfer.  The picture is grainy, and there are some definite  compression artifacts to been seen.
Bottom line: this DVD is worth  buying for the movie, no doubt... and since this is the only version  available, it's this or nothing.  Just don't expect a really terrific  picture.",947030400,125,1005,4.559322033898305
180927,5,1558908382,"I LOVE this movie! This is by far one of the wittiest, funniest, smartest movies John and Joan Cusack have done. I laugh every time I watch it. I think most people can identify with the situations the film proposes. One  of the best attributes of this film is that it offers us the chance to  laugh at ourselves, (hello High School Reunions!). Despite the bad rap of  violence in general these days, this movie contains comedic violence at its  finest. As a fairly conservative female, I get to live vicariously through  these dysfunctional characters and I love it! If you haven't seen it, DON'T  DELAY, get it today!",946857600,,618,4.623853211009174
180928,5,1558908382,"John Cusack's portrayl of Martin Blank is absolutely hilarious!  The movie is non-stop laughs, and immediately belows in your video case!",946771200,,137,5.523809523809524
180929,5,1558908382,"I have been suprised at how few people have seen or heard about this movie.  Although it is about a professional killer going to his high school reunion, it is really funny and very watchable.  The movie seems to attempt  to portray this line of work as normal and stressful just as any job can  be.  I have rented it three times, and finally saved up to buy it for  myself.",946080000,,374,4.197183098591549
180930,5,1558908382,"John Cusack does the best acting job ever playing Martin Blank, a hit man that returns to his hometown for his 10 year high school reunion. Just the plot and the way Cusack nailed every emotion and mood made me want to watch  it again and again. This movie is worth every penny!",945907200,,278,4.245283018867925
180931,5,1558908382,"I really enjoyed the dark nature of this movie, not only was it fantastically funny, but it made you think. That is the best part of a movie, the way you continue to think about it after it is finished. You  could really watch this over and over without getting tired of it!  If you  buy it there will be no regrets, I promise!",941673600,4,327,4.078125
180932,3,1558908382,"It thrives between social satire - without becoming tiresome, like most of Woody Allen's films - and a feel for life's ironies, without becoming silly. The romance avoids sentiment. In all, a better film than average.  The DVD unfortunately lacks any substantive extras, lowering the overall  grade by 1 star.. Given all the little Cusacks in the film, a commentary by  John would have made this a 4-star DVD.",940377600,2,409,4.898550724637682
180933,5,1558908382,"If there was a movie (becides ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and the ""Evil Dead"" flicks) that kept me from getting bored during some part of it, it would have to be this one. The script and actors made for a  very entertaining movie. Cusak and his co-writers made it possible. Also  adding Benny ""The Jet"" was awsome. Never thought that I would see  John Cusak in a fight seen with a Jackie Chan great such as Benny ""The  Jet"". Anyway, I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a fresh  new idea.",925603200,,498,4.25531914893617
180934,5,1558908382,"I saw this movie on a Tuesday and then every day for the next week.  It was more than witty, more than funny and more than brilliant!  It's been a long time since we have seen anything fabulously original from Hollywood.  John Cusack has confirmed my long held belief - he is a genius!  We need  more movies like this!  Excellent in every way and only capable of getting  better with every viewing.  I should know, I've seen it more times than I  care to reveal!",924652800,,462,4.27906976744186
180935,5,1558908382,"Positively love the quirkiness of this dialogue and all the performances!!  The blow up of the Ultamart has me laughing even before it happens -- and the Pulp Fiction cutout is a treat.  To anyone who has EVER attended a  school reunion (or as Jeremy Piven calls it the ""I've peaked and I'm  kidding myself party""), you'll see a few people you know!  (And who is  the actress who plays Mrs. K?  She's great!) Consistently funny and  entertaining.  How could you not love John Cusack?!?",921369600,,485,4.6117647058823525
