8660367,4,B00KO80WN8,"Surprisingly good, low-budget little espionage thriller, told in 70 minutes (so you don't have much time to question the accuracy of the plot), with good performances by all, including Peter Lorre and J. Carrol Naish in subtle characterizations, and Thomas Beck in a major role. The plot concerning a German conspiracy to steal the blueprints of a new American airplane is centered around four male characters (Lorre, Beck, Brian Donlevy and Ralph Morgan) who end up together in a dangerous flight over the Atlantic. The fast dramatic events include ruthless killings and a plane crash, all unknowingly leading to II World War.",1440892800,2,627,5.1568627450980395
8660368,4,B00KO80WN8,"Early Lorre in Hollywood, and a decided oddity especially in its closing scenes. But Lorre shines.",1425945600,,98,5.1875
8660369,4,B00KO80WN8,"Good cast, average script and story",1416182400,,35,5.0
