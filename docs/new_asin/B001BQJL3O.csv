3497764,5,B001BQJL3O,"Bill and Desiree are to be commended for an excellent video.

I bought my lover and myself a copy of ""Love is Timeless"" for Christmas.  We watched it together and were delighted.  Their sharing of their love was a wonderful inspiration to us.

We share and applaud Bill's and Desiree's belief that lovemaking is to be celebrated and shared, not hidden away.  In a society where any such sharing is condemned as ""porn"" it's hard to be clear about purpose, but indeed they were: Their video joyfully celebrates their sacred union and is a polar opposite of movies in which actors ""perform"" for pay and entertainment purposes.  What a wonderful intimate sharing!

I don't remember the dates, but my memory has it that I attended one or move of the workshops where their love began.  It's been a joy to be a part of their lives, even if in a small peripheral way.  A year ago, I first read poetry from Bill's book ""May Touch Redeem Us"" with my lover, who especially appreciated Bill's ""live"" reading to Desiree on the video.

When I first learned that Desiree was a grandmother I asked ""How come grandmothers weren't so sexy when I was a kid?""  Desiree's grace and charm forever changed the way I thought about mature women.

We are joyful at Bill's and Desiree's intention to replace ignorance and fear with awareness and love.  We were grateful to be included in their lives in this way, and eager to practice what they had so lovingly demonstrated.",1231113600,6,1447,4.627450980392157
3497765,5,B001BQJL3O,"It might be about my own age or a higher than usual level of real life empathy with the film's subjects but I felt a strong connection to Tony Comstock's sixth film in his Real Sex, Real Life, Real People erotic documentary series - Bill and Desiree: Love Is Timeless.

And connection, rather than age is what Bill and Desiree is about. Age isn't how they define themselves. ""Lovers"" is how they define themselves - they are givers and receivers of pleasure, lovers with a deep connection. Other than a quip at the beginning about an indistinct memory or interpretation of a memory which in my experience happens with lovers of any vintage, there's little talk of age. There's a good deal of very charming talk about love and pleasure and connection and the whole film has a wonderful romantic comedy feel about it.

Bill and Desiree have a gorgeous calm and wise presence on camera. Viewers will empathise when they talk of the warmth and security of being loved by someone who truly knows you, being seen and heard and loved, when Desiree comments to Bill ""You know me"" we understand that she means deeply -  ""You know me."" - it's a powerful moment. When she says, ""I've never been loved like this, or felt this kind of love before,"" I felt myself nodding in knowing agreement.

Comstock's camera work capturing pleasure on the faces of Bill and Desiree is some of the best I think he's done, here he has perfected his documentary technique - gently taking us to where we can read Desiree's delight at Bill's caresses, anticipating Bill's responses and skilfully catching loving looks between them, - they appear radiant, often lost in each other and in the moment. It's quite something to bear witness to - it's joyous and moving and very erotic.

At a personal level it's a hopeful or hope filled movie - as my sweetheart and I approach middle years I guess I'm relieved and excited that love and sex can flourish no matter what age. I've known that in my heart, but as we rarely if ever get to actually see what real sex and real love looks like between people of any age, Bill and Desiree serve as proof for me - beautiful, life affirming, sexy proof.",1228694400,16,2157,4.5633074935400515
3497766,5,B001BQJL3O,"""Bill & Desiree"" has some great long reviews. Here's a short one: Wow!

If you're looking for Hustler, this ain't it. If you're looking for barely-somethings, look someplace else.

But if you want some really hot, completely explicit, soul-shaking sex, and could enjoy feeling you like the people who did it, and if you want your girlfriend--or boyfriend--to go ""Jeez, honey, can WE do that now?,"" fork out the money. Buy this DVD.

Nobody does sex like Comstock Films. Honest to God, here's the real stuff.",1237766400,7,507,4.872093023255814
3497767,5,B001BQJL3O,"Once, in the middle of a twenty-five-year relationship, I had an insight about why people spend so much time yearning for love or dreaming of a better love, rather than basking in the pleasure of it. My insight? No matter how good a love is, no matter how pure, true, transcendent and resounding, it ends, if not in disruption then in the death of one of the partners. No armor can defend against that and no amount of good management can stave it off. The other side of  love is vulnerability.

Bill and Desiree give us a glimpse into a relationship seasoned by wisdom. They've had other relationships, a basis for comparison. They share the giddy early stages when Bill perceived Desiree as an unattainable goddess. They remind us that adolescent thrills can be known at any age. Their ""spotted owl"" story, about an inadvertent visitor who interrupts an outdoor tryst, gives a glimpse into their willingness to be photographed. They share tender love-making with the courageous, playful inclusion of sex toys (one never knows who has the cock or even who is ejaculating with these two). Their tender, eyes-open connection in intercourse is a treasure to witness. ""Just the act of sleeping together is ecstatic:"" They understand each other without excessive explanation. They give us a glimpse into a relationship which includes ""accommodative sex"" where one of them is present for the other even when they don't particularly want to climax -- intercourse as a ""goodnight kiss.""

""If some people aren't willing to be seen, how do we learn?"" asks Desiree. Desiree and Bill give us a wide angle lens into what is OK to talk about and even what's OK to share with others. We get to see the fleeting paper-crane of love dangling in mid-air, with so much hope and heart invested. They talk about their love-making as ""redemptive, spiritual daily nourishment."" They give us a big YES to the unspoken question: is it possible to have soulful intimacy in the midst of sex? They share with us their diversity of positions (move over lesbians, they've claimed ""69""), sensual activities from sucking toes to the finest, most teasing/tantalizing love-making by a man's hand that cinema has seen. Bill and Des give us evidence of love-making that is ""deliciously rewarding and wondrously mischievous,"" to quote Bill. Hot? Bill's simple statement, ""She likes the idea of my cum being inside her. I have to admit I like the idea too..."" I replayed the DVD five times so far.

Bill and Desiree's non-possessive love leaves space for private time - they tell us, in a matter of fact way, that they don't live together. They also show that one can have such an intense connection that after only three weeks of being lovers, others saw them as having been married for many years. They make love and yet, when apart, he delights in knowing that she has masturbated. There is a deep profound merging of hearts and bodies -- and enough space that even Esther Perel (author of Mating in Captivity) would applaud them.

They tell us that peaks are peaks for a reason. Not every moment is Mount Everest. Seeing Bill and Desiree make love is not  voyeurism. They give us a glimpse of the infinitely temporal, existentially fleeting intimacy of raw, playful, ecstatic, deeply merging sex. They show us their union, knowing that, for all time, it is but a moment in time. Our time together is all we have (my wisdom last summer, after a close friend suddenly died at a young age). Subtitled ""love is timeless,"" this film gives us the opportunity to see, hear and almost feel their amazing connection. Brava, Bravo, Mazel-tov, and a deep thank-you from this viewer. What you've let us see is much, much deeper than the sexual merging.",1236902400,9,3707,4.802507836990595
3497768,5,B001BQJL3O,"Sex sells, or so you'd think from the huge profits of the porn industry and the come-on pictures and headlines on every magazine promising the secrets to a red-hot love life if you just buy this month's issue.  And yet, the titillating images and promises always leave me disappointed, empty, wanting more, because they never fulfill my real hunger to know more about the mystery of sex.

I'm happy to say I finally found what I've been looking for in Bill and Desiree: Love is Timeless.  This documentary explores the most ""forbidden"" mystery of all:  how a deeply connected and very real couple makes love.  The first part of the film introduces the couple as they talk about how their relationship began and blossomed, with brief and tantalizing cuts to scenes of lovemaking.  Desiree and Bill speak with such honesty and obvious delight in each other, I was totally drawn in to their special world.

When the eloquent talk gave way to the eloquent sounds of their pleasure, I felt I was part of their intimacy rather than a voyeur.  There was no suspension of disbelief as there is with porn, no frenetic pacing or for-the-camera-only positions.  Everything is genuine--the playfulness, the connection, the ecstasy.  The film is enchanting, educational, and arousing for the body, the mind and the spirit.  Satisfaction doesn't come any better than this!",1236384000,5,1358,4.938325991189427
3497769,5,B001BQJL3O,"I love the simplicity and openness of this intimate documentary showing mature eroticism and sexuality. Bill and Desiree are expressive and articulate and sweetly self-conscious about showing the world their lovemaking. It is educational by showing, not telling or preaching. It also opens the viewer's heart and soul to the possibilities of love, intimacy and sexuality as we age. Thanks Bill and Desiree, for your willingness to share yourselves with us.",1235865600,4,456,5.436619718309859
3497770,5,B001BQJL3O,"I am ashamed to say that I have never watched one of Tony Comstock's films prior to viewing Bill & Desiree. This is a masterpiece; it is sexual education for everyone.

He captures the beauty of two sexual beings with an open-minded positive attitude about sexuality and how it effects their lives in a spiritual way. I could not stop smiling as I watched this film. it is beautiful, sexual, natural--it is art art it's best because it is real.

The film begins with an interview of the couple recounting how they met, their first sexual encounters, and how and when they knew they were in love. As each of them speak, the other caresses and stares at his/her partner with a loving look in their eyes that can only be described as beautiful. I had the same twinkle in my eyes the the whole time I watched them. Their dialogue is mixed intermittently with glimpses of them in a sexual embrace, and ends with a full uninterrupted scene of them making love. It begins with undressing, teasing, and some sexual adventurousness, and ends with them in loving post-coital embrace. Beautiful!

They tell a very funny story about stopping in the redwood forest to make love outdoors. While having sex, they hear footsteps crunching on leaves while approaching them. They thought it could be a dear or a bear, but they were wrong, it was a man who stumbled upon them and just acted like everything was normal. He enthusiastically asked if there was more like them in the woods, and if he could snap their picture.

That story sums up this movie perfect--an outsider catching a glimpse of love in action and catching it with a picture. That picture may be the spark he needed in his own sexual journey, and this film may be what you need in yours. Bill and Desire say at the end of the film, ""if we don't catch true love on screen, how could we learn.""

How could we? I will be giving this movie to my parents as weird as that may sound--I know they need this--we all need this. You will not be disappointed.

3497771,5,B001BQJL3O,"I didn't know quite what to expect when I received ""Bill and Desiree: Love is Timeless"" by Comstock Films for review.  Would I enjoy watching ""older lovers"" in their ""later years"" making love on film?  Well, within the first few minutes my doubts were eased as I watched Bill passionately recount how he and Desiree first met.  Bill and Desiree have much to share with the viewer through their celebration of sex, love and desire, with a few erotic revelations thrown in that might surprise you as well.

You can immediately tell that they are each other's ""soul mates"" as they reminisce about their ""delirious"" love making on their first real date.  During the interview, they talk about the importance of human touch and how they stay connected through what Desiree calls ""a daily nourishment"".  Bill also discusses how mainstream pornography and sexual ""how-to"" advice can be damaging as it sets unrealistic goals to perform and try to achieve magic every time.  ""Peak experiences are just that,"" says Bill, ""Not every experience is Mount Everest"".

What I learned through watching Bill and Desiree is how accommodating and self-less they give themselves to each other, not always interested in orgasm for themselves, but delighted to give each other pleasure and enjoy what they receive with so much gratitude.  This is the way relationships should be and I have to thank Bill and Desiree for sharing their respect, love and passion with the world, for it is so inspiring and wonderful to see.

Tony Comstock's camera-style invites you in--close and intimate--focusing on the joy on their faces, the tenderness with which they hold each other's hands, the gaze in their eyes as they immerse themselves in their shared moment of bliss.  Comstock's films seductively roam the bodies of their participants like a lover's touch, moving in and out of focus, in a way that highlights the physical beauty between two lovers and celebrates sexual intimacy as an art form in itself.  In this way, Bill and Desiree become more than just the components of their sexual moving parts, as their emotional, spiritual and amorous bond transcends the screen.

""Bill and Desiree: Love Is Timeless"" is a magnificent film: a sexual tapestry of touch, unconditional love, and vivacious desire.  This film should be a part of the curriculum in Sex-Ed classes and is a must-see for all couples regardless of age.  It will inspire couples how to stay passionate, vibrant and innovative in their approach to love and sex, no matter at what stage they may find themselves on their journey through life.",1235692800,16,2580,4.967441860465116
3497772,5,B001BQJL3O,"The interesting thing about Tony Comstock's films is that it feels like you're in conversation with good friends as they talk about their relationship, but the intimacy of Comstock's camera work invites you closer in, and then allows you to gain entrance into the physical passion behind the words.  In this film, you find yourself in Bill and Desiree's living room, a handsome 50-ish couple, and they talk about how they met and how they feel about each other, and you feel the affection and tenderness between them.

Comstock uses the same technique he's used in other films: the interview is interspersed with very short clips of the couple making love. This is both a tease and at times a frustration, until you realize you're going to get the full sexual footage after the interview is over.  I knew this because I'd seen previous Comstock films, but I was happy to note from the DVD menu that one can skip to the sex scenes, should you be frustrated with the titillation of the interview and have to jump to the ""action.""

The lovemaking scenes are beautiful and intense.  It's not that they make you horny.  Rather, they strike you with their tenderness, their kindness, the sweetness of their portrayal of lovemaking. It feels like you're watching your own lovemaking with your own beloved: those same joys, the laughter and passionate intensities, the smiles, the wonder, the tears.

Comstock's movies are about relationships.  The question is, what is he trying to convey?  I think he's trying to portray sex in a healthy way, showing its celebratory, loving expression - something that's rarely displayed in any medium.  As Desiree says at the end of the movie: ""If some people aren't willing to be seen, how do we learn?  How do we get comfortable with who we are as sexual creatures and beings?""  Tony Comstock is on a mission to answer that question.",1235174400,6,1864,4.790625
3497773,5,B001BQJL3O,"I'm not quite in the same age bracket as Bill & Desiree, but I'll be there soon enough that I looked to this film as a preview of what intimacy might be like for me then.

I was inspired and moved both by their story and their intimacy.  They are absolutely radiant as they speak in the first half of the film and then move to the bedroom in the second half.  This is what real sex looks like, I thought as I watched them, and I wished that more people could get this kind of glimpse of the parts of a relationship that usually stay hidden.",1234915200,5,540,4.02803738317757
3497774,5,B001BQJL3O,"""Love Is Timeless"" transcends hotness (though it is - hot, I mean), departs the realms of ordinary porn, and actually teaches the viewer how good sex can be. The sex we witness is, by turns, romantic, goofy, pragmatic, raw, passionate, and tender. Perhaps above all, it is spectacularly honest and utterly, utterly fearless. How many of us can talk frankly with our partners, much less with a camera crew and film producers, about what pleases us, how we feel about our genitals, or what it means that sometimes sex is kinda boring? And it's non-fiction, folks, complete with the slightly awkward moments of position changing and pillow adjustment that get edited out of other erotica.

Unlike mainstream porn, the viewer isn't offered shot after shot of genitals thrusting; genitals too, but faces! Faces full of actual, honest-to-god love, crossed by self-consciousness, and often lost in blind rapture. Faces!! About time somebody made a movie that was sexy and didn't insult a person's intelligence.

The movie is half interview (sparsely intercut with glimpses of the lovemaking to come) and half lovemaking session. The interview powerfully enriches the erotic section of the DVD - the sex is more meaningful, more interesting, and MUCH sexier when you get to know who the people are.

I was left with an overmastering feeling that sex isn't about the hype on the cover of Cosmo or the medical authority of PE drugs. It's just... bodies. People. Human beings at their purest. And did I mention it's hot?",1233964800,7,1509,5.00398406374502
3497775,5,B001BQJL3O,"According to Tony Comstock (the director), ""At the time of production he was about 65 and she was just turned or about to turn 50."" Love, even sex, even really good sex, isn't just for the twenty-somethings. This handsome couple proves that in their joyous lovemaking.

Comstock has developed a winning format. Like his other films, the first half presents the couple talking to an unseen, unheard interviewer. They talk about meeting, then meeting again, then how their relationship blossomed (or exploded) into being. Quick cuts during the interview show moments from their bedroom scene, then return to the couple talking. Throughout that interview, the radiant smiles on their faces suggest the heat of new love - but they had already been together for years when that was taken.

The second half of each Comstock film follows the two through their intimacy, from undressing (and her getting knotted up in her T-shirt), through their play and peak, to a limp, loving cuddle afterward. Even with their lines, spots, and other marks of age, they make a handsome, even beautiful and graceful pair. And a happy pair - they laugh and giggle throughout, unable (and unwilling) to keep that huge happiness bottled up.

Lots of us knew it already, but the message needs to be heard more: There is life, and love, and some howling good sex after 40, and 50, and 60, ... Bill and Desiree make that statement beautifully.

8284245,5,B001BQJL3O,"Bill and Desiree are in love, and as erotic as their lovemaking are the heart-to-heart gazes they give each other, the intertwined fingers, the way Bill's hand lightly grazes Desiree's breast as they talk to the camera, the gentle corrections they make to each other's stories.

They are buoyantly, joyously, agelessly sexual together, laughing as they make love, reveling in their connection. Much of the documentary is interview -- we hear how they met, where they first made love, why they love each other, and how important sex is to both of them. The commentary is interspersed with flashes of their sexual activity.

I liked how unlike traditional porn this film is. This is an aging couple -- sexy, playful, and in love. They have body hair. They use lubricant. They make eye contact. He is dashing with his salt-and-pepper hair and fit body, and the softness of his caresses matters much more than the age spots on his hands.
