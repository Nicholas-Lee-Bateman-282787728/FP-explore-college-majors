8227471,5,B000X9PRGA,This Tarzan entry starring Gordon Scott was three TV shows blended into a full length feature.  The film is a good one and would have made a good TV series.  To bad this was filmed in black and white.  This is a good one to own.,1370995200,,228,3.9130434782608696
8227472,2,B000X9PRGA,"Tarzan and the Trappers, 1958 film

This story begins with views of Africa. [Stock footage.] The struggle for survival goes on. Tarzan helps the weak and distressed. [Too good to be true?] A snake crawls over a woman's leg! ""Thank you, Cheta."" But the animals are frightened by something. A lizard digs up and eats crocodile eggs. Tarzan sees caged animals, then hears a gunshot. One man has been wounded. Tarzan says to send a message to the Commissioner. A hunter wants to take animals out before the authorities become aware of his activities. He shoots a cow elephant and orphans its baby. Tarzan arrives to question and test the veracity of two servants. There is a fight. Then Tarzan frees the baby elephant. Cheta knows how to sound the horn on the truck that the hunter owns. But she is caught and caged. Boy shows up, then Tarzan. The hunter shows his moral character.

Tarzan is requested to dance. He moves fast. Tarzan trails the hunters. He calls the elephants to attack the hunter's camp. The animals escape. Tarzan attacks the two hunters. The authorities arrive to arrest the hunters. Cheta finds a bee hive and tries to get some honey. A native asks for Tarzan's help. Tarzan swims in the river until a crocodile arrives. The brother of that hunter returns to seek revenge against Tarzan. There is a conspiracy. One man seeks a legendary lost treasure. Tarzan arrives at the Trading Post. He is attacked by a man who is bigger but slower. Tarzan wins! [Was this fight fixed?] He then defeats three men, and leaves. The chief of the tribe will guard Jane and Boy. Three hunters travel through the forest. We see the river falls. The hunters trail Tarzan. ""Its only a matter of time."" Two guards aren't vigilant. One is sent into camp as a message.

Natives patrol the area with spears. Tarzan tells them to stay out of the jungle. [Does a stunt double swing on those vines?] Tarzan warns Jane to seek a refuge. Can they set a trap for Tarzan by capturing his friend? Can Tarzan be caught in a net? Can he then get free if native warriors arrive? Yes. He rescues the chief. ""Take care."" Tarzan leaves a trail for the hunters to track. The lost city of Zargo is found! They explore the ruins. Tarzan neutralizes the guards. There is no treasure there! The natives run off. Tarzan attacks the hunters and wins! The hunters are tied up and led away. Boy and Tarzan return home. Cheta is back too! Who has the bigger appetite? [The players are identified at the end.]

The idea of a Tarzan is total fantasy. For an outdoors man Tarzan shows no tan. Such a creature could never exist outside of a comic strip. So why was he a popular character in the past? This is at best an average story once you accept the premise of a super-hero. The version I saw had low quality and a fuzzy image.",1353888000,,2797,4.510848126232742
8227473,2,B000X9PRGA,"This is the movie that wasn't really a movie. It was filmed as the pilot and first two episodes of a TV series. All three networks turned it down due to concerns over rights, so the producer recut it into a movie. You can clearly tell the divisions between the TV episodes.

The stories are shallow, and Gordon Scott is written and directed into the prevalent attitude from the 30s thru the 50s of a Tarzan who can't speak in complete sentences. Of course, every time Tarzan lets loose with his famous cry, animals all around the jungle go crazy, including evidently a snake, as a small boa is shown moving his head back and forth in just about every animal reaction sequence. LOL

The last part of the movie is particularly weak, with a ""great white hunter"" who has a grudge over Tarzan putting his brother in prison wanting to hunt Tarzan down. The performance of the actor playing the hunter is an insult to the idea of acting. Every line is wooden and forced. The sub-plot about a lost city is also shallow and trite, and NONE of the action/fight sequences make any sense whatsoever. Example: (spoiler) at the end Tarzan has the evil white men trapped in a pit in the lost city. He demands that they drop their guns. They don't. So he jumps down in the pit with them and beats them all up, dodging a shot or two on his way in. It was just stupid. An earlier scene has Tarzan fighting a really big man and eventually breaking his neck after another simplistic and fake fight sequence.

Gordon Scott brought none of the emotion or charm to the role that Johnny Weissmuller did for his famous turns as the ape-man. Jane's biggest scene was having a garter snake crawl onto her foot (later identified as a mamba so it would seem scarey). The ""humorous subplot"" involved Tarzan, at the start of the film, retrieving some eggs for Jane to cook. Three TV episodes and evident DAYS later Tarzan returns to the tree house and Jane has just finished cooking the eggs. LOL

This ""movie"" was really an insult to the viewer in more ways than one, and is a pretty big waste of time to even watch for free. I cannot recommend wasting money on the DVD unless you are some sort of devoted Tarzan collector and cannot abide your collection lacking even this film.",1316217600,,2249,4.451456310679611
8227474,4,B000X9PRGA,"The dvd arrived on time.  The packaging and dvd were in very good shape.  I have always enjoyed all of the older Tarzan movies, and this was no different.  It was good to reminisce.  I enjoyed going back in time with this dvd.",1305417600,,226,4.186046511627907

8227476,5,B000X9PRGA,"I believe it is likely the best version of the film that, up to this point, has ever been made available.
It is widescreen and the picture is better than any video version which has come before.
HIGHLY recommended for Tarzan fans.
Be advised, however . . . These DVD's will not play on a unit which has the ability to duplicate.

Hope that helps!  :D",1265068800,2,350,4.287878787878788
8227477,2,B000X9PRGA,"This was Gordon Scott's first Tarzan film and not his best. Those were Tarzan Greatest Adventure 1959 and Tarzan The Magnificent 1960. Arguably the 2 best Tarzan Movies ever made. Tarzan and the Trappers is a re-edited version of a TV pilot that never got off the ground.
I would also like to point out a mistake in the product description of Tarzan and the Trappers. Edgar Rice Burroughs died in 1950. Tarzan and the Trappers was released in 1955. Johnny Weissmuller made his last Tarzan film in 1948. I don't think Burroughs had Scott in mind for Tarzan. He probably never even heard his name. However Burroughs did like Bruce Bennett who played Tarzan in a 1935 serial called The New Adventures Of Tarzan.",1196208000,6,708,4.672
