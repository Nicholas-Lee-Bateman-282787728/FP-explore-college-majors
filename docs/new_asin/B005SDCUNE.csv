4879499,3,B005SDCUNE,"First off, I'm glad that Motorhead finally is available on blu ray in concert.  It's great to see Lemmy and crew in a BD live recording.  And Motorhead is still writing new music that is head and shoulders above most other bands.

The video camera work itself was fine.  That being said, I'm very disappointed that the entire main concert was recorded in black and white.  A few numbers, ok, but the whole performance?  I have a concert recording of Motorhead from over a decade ago and that's all in color.  What's the point of doing it black and white now?  It was a PITA to have to deal with for the entire main concert.  Fortunately, they didn't let whatever clown was responsible for this mess up the color in the bonus concert recordings.

The sound was ok for blu ray, but definitely not as good as from several other recent blu ray concerts that I have with DTS Master HD sound.  The problem appears to be the way the concert itself was recorded.  Should have got better recording talent, IMO.

I hope Motorhead does another live Blu Ray soon and gets some competent video and audio recording and mixdown engineers this time.  I'm giving this 3 stars - great performance by Motorhead but overall not transferred well to Blu Ray.",1324166400,8,1236,4.53393665158371

8484770,3,B005SDCUNE,"This Blu Ray is OK, but not even close to Stage Fright as far as the performance, sound quality, and editing go. I was immediately bothered by the low volume of Phil's guitar in the mix. It's all bass and drums! I had to mess with all my settings just to get enough guitar. I thought maybe it was my system, but I put on another Blu Ray concert and that one sounded fine. So the sound on this is lacking, another reviewer brought up that maybe the concert itself was poorly mixed. The main show is pretty standard Motorhead, if you've seen them before, you know what you get. If you are looking for Motorhead on Blu Ray, Stage Fright is a better option.",1447286400,,653,4.232

8484773,5,B005SDCUNE,"Mmmmmmmmotorhead!!
This does the job. The crowd are wild, and this makes the band happy. Comparing the mad for it Chileans to the miserable English fans in the extras is hilarious. No wonder Lemmy offers to return to play in Chile ""any time""
My stereo is loud.. And it gets nervous every time it sees me open this Bluray box. Relentless wall of sound and power. They are Motrhead, and they do play rock and roll !!
Up there with the great DVD/Bluray's in my collection. Just need to swallow a brave tablet before I put it on.",1391731200,,525,4.36734693877551
8484774,5,B005SDCUNE,"i know a lot of the negative reviews are regarding this being in back and white. but i honestly think the black and white ADDS to this and is a good move, the black and white just fits with Motorhead no frill barebones hard rock. the sound is amazing you with the three shows you get a very nice selection of motorhead songs. a true must have for any motorhead fan

if the black and white is a big hang up for you just wait till Vol 2 comes out in a few months",1347408000,,460,3.893617021276596
8484775,5,B005SDCUNE,"""The World Is Ours Vol 1"" is a beautiful thing; elegant in its simplicity.  Motorhead take the stage in Santiago Chile and rock it straight no bulls*@#t.  They start off on a light simmer with ""Iron Fist""; quickly bring the concert to a rolling boil with ""Stay Clean"" and remain full tilt, balls to the wall rocking with their cocks out for the rest of the show.
The cinematography is excellent and the sound is pristine. If you watch it on a quality home entertainment system you can feel Mikkey Dee's drums kick you right in the chest.

""The World Is Ours"" is shot in black and white giving it a classic film noir look.  Mikkey Dee does possibly the best drum solo I have ever heard on ""In The Name Of Tragedy"".  By the time Motorhead tear into ""Ace Of Spades"" the entire stadium is bobbing up and down like one living breathing ""Orgasmatron."" They administer the coup de grace with ""Overkill"" and the show is over all too soon. I sure hope there is a volume 2 waiting in the wings! Nobody does it better.  They are Motorhead and they play rock and roll.",1335139200,3,1056,4.362244897959184
8484776,4,B005SDCUNE,"Yes, it's in black & white.  So you miss all the colorful glory of 3 white guys wearing black clothes in front of black amps and a black backdrop.  On the plus side, the B&W, combined with the great camera work and editing results in shot after shot that look like they could be framed & hung on the wall.  Banger Films did a bang up job.  I especially liked all the shots from over the boys' shoulders that capture them and the wild crowd.  The Santiago, Chile audience should get their own star here.  They are jumping and going wild from note 1.

The sound is clear.  Each instrument can be heard distinctly.  Each member of the band gets plenty of camera time and the angles let you see the action clearly.  For drummers, notice the way they pan from Mikkey Dee's double bass-pumping feet to his stick work.  It's also fun to read all the goofy stuff written on the guitar straps as Phil changes guitars.  Lemmy is Lemmy (51%/49%, etc.).  The setlist covers the whole Motorhead era with a good mix of periods.  Definitely worth getting.

""Baby I don't want to live forever ... but apparently I am!""  Let's hope so!",1327622400,6,1118,4.4068627450980395
