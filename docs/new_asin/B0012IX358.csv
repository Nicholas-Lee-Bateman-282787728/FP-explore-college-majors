3090696,2,B0012IX358,"I just watched this movie last night and it was not good at all. It was interesting at first, but it kept losing my interest. There were people in the movie that had nothing to do with the movie which made no sense. The ending sucked really bad it was just crazy. The Girl Next Door was better because you could follow the story line, this one I was lost at times. The book was way better than the movie.",1209254400,2,404,4.0625
3090697,3,B0012IX358,"Jack Ketchum's novel from which this film has been adapted (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lost/dp/0843948760/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lost</a>) was set during the mid to late 1960s. The film version is a little more ambiguous as regards when the story occurs. Modern cars and cordless telephones are much in evidence, but the central character, Ray Pye (Marc Senter), has a definite retro look about him. With his immaculately coiffured hair and discreetly applied make-up, there's something of Alex from `A Clockwork Orange' about him. He believes himself to be the epitome of cool; a party animal that the slightly younger kids are in awe of.

Only two, Jennifer and Tim (Shay Astar and Alex Frost), know that Ray is a cold-blooded murderer. The film opens with his brutal slaying of two young women (Erin Brown and Ruby LaRocca) at a local campsite. It is this event that casts its shadow across the remainder of the story, reaching, years later, into the lives of several of the inhabitants of the town of Sparta.

Although the film is a faithful retelling of the novel in terms of events, there is, I suppose necessarily, something lost in terms of characterization. This is particularly true of Detective Charlie Schilling (Michael Bowen), Ed Anderson (Ed Lauter) and Sally Richmond (Megan Henning). Retired police officer Ed Anderson has recklessly embarked on a love affair with Sally, an eighteen-year-old student. Their relationship is not explored in any depth and Ed's rollercoaster feelings of guilt and elation are nowhere near as prominent in the film as they were in the novel. Similarly, Schilling's obsessive angst at the police's failure to nail Ray Pye for the double murder is not apparent enough.

A slight disappointment, for me, was Robin Sydney's performance as bad-girl wannabee Katherine Wallace. In my opinion, she was miscast in this role. Her dialogue is indistinct in places and her body language is unconvincing in this role of the confident young woman whom Ray Pye falls for. Additionally, the soundtrack music is unnecessarily overbearing at times. Yes, we know horrible things are happening, and we know Ray Pye is a sick and twisted individual, but we don't need skull-pounding noise to remind us of that.

For the most part, however, this is a stylish horror film. Marc Senter is superb as the demented Ray Pye, and aside from the already mentioned reservations, the rest of the cast is excellent. The violence is powerfully depicted and horrifying to behold.

There is an interesting audio commentary from Jack Ketchum which should appeal to his fans as he talks about his various writing projects. The bonus material also gives us a look at Robin Sydney's and Shay Astar's auditions. For those who have read the novel, you may be interested to know that the scene where Ray steals some beer from a convenience store while Katherine, ahem,  distracts the clerk is missing from the film. The good news is that it does appear in the deleted scenes.",1207958400,3,3035,5.133603238866397
3090698,5,B0012IX358,"Despite a scene or two that could have been trimmed down - or even excised - this has to be one of the best adaptations of a book I've ever seen.  Marc Senter's portrayal of Ray Pye is damn near a miracle...if you've read the book, you'll know what I mean.  On it's own merits even, it's an amazing performance.  Loved the book, loved the movie.",1206316800,5,345,4.196969696969697
3090699,2,B0012IX358,"The second film to come out based on a Jack Ketchum novel is very disappointing.  The first, The Girl Next Door, stuck close to the novel and was a very compelling movie.  The Lost is a rare example of how you can stick very close to your source material yet miss so much.
The story concerns a short fused, womanizing psycho named Ray Pye who one day for kicks, kills two girls in the woods on a camping trip.  Ray's girlfriend, Jennifer and his best friend, Tim are also there and sworn to secrecy.  Four years later, the police are still investigating.  They know it was Ray, but have no proof.  Ray becomes smitten with a sexy brunette named Katherine.  He also has eyes for fellow employee(he works at a motel with his mother)Sally, who is involved with one of the detectives who had investigated the murders.  Sally has no interest, but Katherine gets involved with Ray.  Ray drops his guard a bit as he becomes quite taken with Katherine, but she more or less sees Ray as a way to pass the time.  When he's kicked to the curb by all the women in his life, he snaps, making way for a bloody climax.  The novel was great, and like The Girl Next Door was based on a true crime.  The movie however isn't great.  First off, the story took place in the 60s, but for no good reason is now updated to modern times.  It's shot in that typical irritating style that most movies are done in now.  The camera jumps around, goes to grainy stock, blurs, speeds up, and this is usually accompanied by a loud blast of death metal or some other junk.  Speaking of which, this has some of the worst friggin music in it, though the inclusion of The Pied Piper is fitting.  If I wanted to watch a damn music video, I'd watch a music video.  Most importantly, there is a complete lack of characterization here.  Ray is given depth, but no one else is.  In the novel, Ketchum gave every character depth and personality.  Tim's crush on Jennifer is nonexistent in the film.  In fact, Tim is rather pointless, period.  The character of the detective, Ed(played by Ed Lauter), a major player in the book is only in a few fleeting scenes and you wonder what the point of his character is at all.  Nobody is fleshed out and you couldn't care less about any of them.  You don't even need to have read the book to see how boring, underdeveloped and lifeless these people are.  I do have to give praise for the casting of Marc Senter as Ray.  He's the only good thing about the movie.  He's got the right slimy yet suave demeanor.  He has Ray's swagger down pat and a great rockabilly-type look that's fitting to the character.  When it's time for him to go psycho, he's pretty convincing and creepy.  The climax of the film is well done, not because it's brutal and violent, but it's only then that the film seems to work up any of the tension and suspense of the novel.  By then it's too little, too late though.
Now, this is all just one guy's opinion.  You may very well like this movie, and think I'm talking straight outta my behind.  That's not only fine, but dandy as well.  I just have strong feelings about it coz I liked the book so much, and I hate seeing a great story turned into a very typical movie.  I guess the only thing to do is check it out and see for yourself.",1206144000,10,3259,4.302631578947368
3090700,5,B0012IX358,I saw this movie at a screening in L.A. and I was blown away.  It is gripping and super intense.  The directing and acting is amazing - you will get so involved in the characters - Marc Senter is amazing as Ray Pye.  A must see!,1204761600,9,228,3.9130434782608696
3090701,1,B0012IX358,"This film was shockingly awful. I barely made it to the end. Starts with a good premise and deteriorates into nonsensical garbage quite rapidly. After the ""action"" in the beginning, the viewer is treated to an hour and a half of tedious dialogue and meaningless storylines. It truly goes nowhere, and the acting is horrendous. The lead actor is a brainless sleazeball, and I'm not sure if he's supposed to come across as the moronic fool he does or some kind of evil persona. His friends are equally uninteresting, and only the policeman comes across as anywhere near a competent actor (and that's very little praise for said policeman). The town should have been nuked 10 minutes into this movie to spare us all the inane drivel. Anyhow, back to the lead actor, who's so bad I felt sorry for him at times. It's like he was doing a very bad Crispin Glover imitation, aka River's Edge days. The ending was so poorly contrived and executed I fast forwarded through most of it. Soooooo annoyingly played by every actor and actress. How this thing ends up with anything more that a 1.5 star average is astounding to me. There's great movies out there to heap praise upon, and I can't get why people are content to call this thing anything other than the trash it is. The gore was phony (and almost non-existent), embarrassing acting, no character development, nothing at all to draw a viewer into it. I feel sorry for the folks who think this kind of doo-doo has any appeal. Haven't seen anything this bad since the early 70's.",1393632000,,1523,4.623616236162362

Incredibly charismatic young man and fearless in a young Robert De Niro way. His performance prompted me to seek out his other films in his very young career and he doesn't disappoint. But I can't emphasize enough that this is truly a film for horror fans given the nature of the cruel and graphic violence, however, others daring to venture in might find some unexpected rewards.",1368403200,,535,4.763440860215054
3090705,3,B0012IX358,"This treatment of Jack Ketchum's book is bizzare and twisted, and the edgy direction is perfectly fitting. The more controversial film adapted from a Jack Ketchum story is 'The girl next door', which was an electrifying and brutally frank film that was about as sick and twisted as any flm has ever dared to go. This adaption from another ketchum book isn't as brutal or horrifying, but it is still disturbing. That film was filled with brutal torture sequences that are so horrifying it is pretty much unbearable for most people to sit through. Both of these films have excellent acting, great direction, and compelling characters. Just as with TGND, there are characters that have no sense of right and wrong in this film as well. In the case of this film those that know of the central character's sadistic murders feel compelled to keep silent, and they feel permanently connected to him and remain silent about what they had seen him do. But in this case they seem to be committed to their silence because they fear him. The nature of our sadistic killer and what he is capable of is always just below the surface ready to ignite at any moment. He appears to be an odd and somehwat bizzare person that is also searching for love. As long as the females he shows and interest in have a similar interest he seems like a pretty nice and considerate person. But once he feels he has been seriously shunned, he sets out to unleash his darkest sadistic brutality on those he feels has wronged him. The end of the film reviels that there is a monster inside this young man that is capable of unspeakable brutality. I did however feel that the music in the film which was all great and memorable was applied far too often and it sometimes seemed a bit annoying to me. Much of this movie is a litte boring where nothing rather interesting seems to happen. But it was far better than I expected it to be as a direct to dvd kind of film.",1367971200,2,1931,4.488636363636363
3090706,2,B0012IX358,"The Lost (Chris Sivertson, 2006)

Chris Sivertson, longtime friend and colleague of Lucky McKee, was bitten by the Jack Ketchum bug right around the same time McKee was, and the first Sivertson/Ketchum adaptation, The Lost, appeared in 2006. All well and good, with a few caveats: (a) Sivertson (who would soon after be responsible for the Lindsay Lohan vehicle I Know Who Killed Me) is not nearly the director McKee is and (b) The Lost is not one of Ketchum's better novels. Put these two things together and your chances of coming up with brilliance are pretty slim.

Plot: Four years ago, Ray Pye (Red White and Blue's Marc Senter), while wandering the woods with his friends Jennifer (Rocker's Shay Astar) and Tim (Drillbit Taylor's Alex Frost), came upon two young ladies out hiking (Misty's First Female Lover's Misty Mundae and Ruby Larocca) on a romantic getaway weekend. When all was said and done, one of the hikers was dead, the other barely alive, and Ray Pye and his friends had a very dark secret to keep. Fast-forward to the present day. Charlie Schilling (Kill Bill's Michael Bowen) and his now-retired partner Ed Anderson (The Artist's Ed Lauter) know Ray Pye shot those women, but have never been able to prove it. They keep trying to find ways to shake that tree, but it might get shook all by itself when Ray meets the new bad girl in town, Kath (The Gingerdead Man's Robin Sydney), who makes him think very dark thoughts indeed...

Before I go slagging this movie off, it's obvious that a lot of people threw a lot of talent at it, and in hindsight a number of folks who didn't do all that well here have really stepped up their game in the intervening years, especially Senter, one of the few bright spots in the recent The Devil's Carnival. None of which changes that fact that even Ed Lauter, normally the most reliable of character actors, couldn't turn in a solid performance to save his life in this movie, and I don't know why. Sivertson's not a great director by any means, but he's not that bad. And still everyone involved in this movie (and I only touched on a few of the names you will actually know) seems to have phoned it in.

3090709,1,B0012IX358,"Jack Ketchum is a famed horror novelist, but as far as turning his stories into film is concerned, so far, it hasn't been very successful. The only film based on his writing that I enjoyed, was The Offspring. The most recent one I watched, The Lost, was by far his worst. The story is about two detectives following a guy they know is a budding serial killer, a man who they suspect in a previous crime. With no evidence against him all they can do is watch him. First off this film is very slow moving, to point where I almost turned it off. Second, the main character, Ray (Marc Senter), is a complete and utter moron. I don't know if the character was written that way or if the actor playing him was just that bad, but this guy was not believable at all! The story is rather hard to follow as well, mainly because throughout it, people just keep making statements about what they've seen or what they know, without providing those same details to the audience. Isn't the point of a good mystery to make the audience think and figure things out for themselves instead of just having someone tell them everything? This movie was slow, poorly acted, and on top of that just plain stupid! Don't waste your time on it.",1361491200,,1217,4.413333333333333

3090711,1,B0012IX358,"I like horror. I like slashers. I like suspense. This movie is garbage.

I went looking for recent indie horror that didn't get much attention, and in general I've been really, happy -- Colin, Pontypool, Splinter. There's a ton out there to enjoy.

The Lost is garbage. It lacks a compelling narrative, it evokes no sympathy or curiosity, it objectifies, it paints in black and white, but mostly, it's just boring.

There's a crazy guy. He's mean to women. Eventually he loses it and shoots a bunch of them. Yawn. The Ray character is barely written and poorly acted. None of the female characters are at all compelling, and frankly, it's hard to really care when anyone dies.

No suspense, as I mentioned -- you know he's going to go nuts, so, you know, hey, look, he's getting really angry -- maybe he'll seek therapy or find a caring adult who'll oh wait, no, he's just going to on a shooting spree.

Production value was terrible. Music was pretty good -- Califone on a couple of songs, I think? There you go: instead of renting this, rent Pontypool and buy Califone's All My Friends are Funeral Singers. Or buy nothing. Take a nap. You'll get way, way more out of it than watching The Lost.",1358726400,,1195,4.53953488372093

3090714,3,B0012IX358,"This is a shame because there is something to chew on here and too much of it was left on the table.

It's 1965 in northern New Jersey and Ray Pye kills, for absolutely no real reason, two young girls who are there camping. Pye was with his girlfriend and buddy. Four years later he's still the chief suspect in the case but not enough evidence is available to nail him to the wall. He's a nut job and certain things are starting to happen that are pushing him over the edge. He pops a cork and goes on a killing spree.

Taken from a Jack Ketchum novel, that was based on a real case, this story is about Ray Pye. He has no father and does menial work at the motel his mom owns. He's short but good looking and somewhat (almost Charles Manson-like) charismatic. His closest friends do his bidding unquestioningly. But he's screwed up. This is one of the strengths of the movie. Shay Astor does a decent job as Pye. He's creepy. He's the bomb you're waiting to go off. I wouldn't want to be anywhere near him. He's the only one that is written well. The other characters are Okay but don't amount to much more than sketches.

A previous viewer mentioned how the details, such as the music, didn't fit the time in which this happened. This is a fair criticism. One of the things that made the movie ""Zodiac"" so good was how well hey depicted the time. There was none of that here. Cars, clothing, hairstyles, etc., were nearly nondescript. This might have been due to budgetary restraints. This is not an expensive movie, which might account for the lousy sound mixing and musical score. The volume levels were all over the place and some of the music included heavy metal which I'm pretty sure wasn't around in 1965. The directing was uneven at best. The ending was terrible. Pye shoots some of his victims and they don't all die at the point the police barge in. The one detective starts wailing on Pye and the movie just stops. What happened? Who lived? Who died? Was Pye killed at the scene? Was he arrested and put on trial? None of this was even noted in a post script.

What a shame. This could have been a good thriller/character study but they fumbled the ball. Not a bad watch, but it could have been much better.",1322956800,4,2221,4.37046004842615

It starts out like it's going to be an interesting character study of this Ray Pye. Blatant violence doesn't bother me when it brings insight or realness to a film. And it doesn't bother me when it's gore for the sake of gore.

But this movie seems to be taking itself too seriously. It wants to be insightful and real, but it ends up more like gore for the sake of gore. Just give me one or the other, y'know? That way it doesn't end up looking pretentious or amateurish, which The Lost does.

And the interest in character goes out the window. It gets more and more focused on events rather than people. Who was this guy Ray? After seeing the whole movie, I still don't know.",1249516800,,873,4.343558282208589

The Lost does not disappoint in this regard.

Ray Pye is a completely insane character study, coming as close as someone can to a young Charles Manson as imaginable.  On one hand he's charismatic enough to lure numerous young women into his bed, but on the other hand he's persuasive enough to get others to involve in his criminal activities.  Beginning the movie with one of his character flaws - he stuffs crushed cans into his boots to make up for his height deficiencies - is a perfect vehicle to lull the viewer into thinking Ray is weak.  In no time at all it becomes readily apparent that he's a sociopath powder keg of anger, inadequacy, and jealousy.  After killing two women for no reason other than the experience, the stage is set for Ray and his friends to keep it as a secret while Ray continues his disturbing behavior.  The murdering Ray does later as a result of being rejected by a few young women is as senseless as it is jaw-dropping.

The negatives of this movie are numerous.  At times it is very difficult to hear important conversations between Ray and others.  Aside from Ray, the character development is nearly non-existent.  In fact, there are two or three characters that could be taken out of the movie without any change.  As for the music, it's distractingly loud.  Last but not least, the ending, albeit shocking, feels rushed and lacking.  The positives, however, more than compensate.

First and foremost, Marc Senter portrays Ray Pye absolutely brilliantly.  He comes off as completely off the charts insane, wildly unpredictable, and the spitting image of Tom Cruise's Maverick character from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Top-Gun/dp/6305127689/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Top Gun</a>&nbsp;- if Maverick had schizophrenia and was addicted to smack.  Brilliant.  Other great aspects of this movie are the gore and violence, the explicit sex scenes, the bountiful babes (especially Robin Sydney despite her poor portrayal), and the pure craziness of it all.

Ray buys them beer, boasts about his sexual conquests, even stuffs objects in his boots to make himself look taller.  But in actuality, he's a frail, pitiful loser harnessing some pent up rage.  And when it explodes, look out.
The acting in this movie is adequate, but it's the horrendous acts themselves that keep you riveted.  Plus there is plenty of nudity as it also explores a dark realm of unabated sexuality.  It all culminates into an utterly vicious and frightening climax that will make you feel helpless and vulnerable right along with the victims.

 The movie starts out on a campground with a trio of friends. One girl, 2 guys. The 2 guys, ""Ray and Tim"", end up spotting a couple of girls camping nearby and Ray decides it would be fun to kill them. The plan dosen't go as well as the guy thinks and things end up taking a turn for the worst. After this, Ray ends up dragging his friends into the scheme and they unwittingly become accomplices to murder.

Fast forward 4 years. It's now 1969 and the police are trying to find out who killed the camper. The plot interchanges between the cops searching and trying to pin Ray for murder and the audience getting to see how Ray lives his life and it's not pretty.

As the movie goes on you see how crazy Ray Pye is. He abuses everyone around him, he parties too hard and he even ends up killing his own mom. You also get to see Ray and his numerous relationships going on and the people he associates with.

The middle is drawn out and somewhat boring. It consists of Ray hanging out with his friends, doing drugs and having sex. By the time the ending comes you are a bit tired of it and hope the ending is even more dramatic and it dosen't disapoint as far as that goes.

At the end Ray end's up having a meltdown and everyone suffers for it. The ending was a bit of a let down. Though filled with drama, the conclusion ends very abruptly and you don't even know if the killer lives or dies.

 So we have a great beginning and a good yet disapointing ending and then about an hour and a half filled with not much of anything other than investigations and Ray abusing people.

 Despite not being completely satisfied, I still found this movie to be decent enough. It's a very intense and graphic film. There's a dark vibe throughout the movie and Ray is a scary guy. If you're looking for a decent thrill killing movie, this is for you.",1219881600,,1890,4.2395543175487465

I'm really lovin' these Ketchum novel adaptions.

Ray Pye (whose performance was downright amazing)is going down as one of my 3 favorite villians in a horror movie:
(along side Patrick Bateman from ""American Psycho""

The opening sequence really sets the pace for the rest of the movie,
a nude Erin Brown (one of the most gorgeous women in Hollywood)
and a double homicide,
lead into a failed investigation by local police,
and the deterioration of Rays two reluctant cohorts.
The conclusion is what this movie is all about!!

3090720,2,B0012IX358,"I read the novel several months ago, and let this DVD sit around my house looking for the opportune time to watch it.  When the kids were finally away for a little while I popped it in, and have to say... I was a bit disappointed.  The short summary of the story for those who have not read the book:  Ray Pye is a slightly off kilter young man in his early 20's who on a random whim kills two young women while camping.  Now 4 years later the police know it was him but can not prove it.  Ray's two friends who know about the killings are slowly destroying themselves with drugs and alcohol, but their obsession with the murderous Pye is as strong as ever.  When the rejection of several women in town finally sets Ray off, he begins a murderous rampage.

The Good:
-The violence is all there, brutal and on screen.

-All of the sex is there almost to the point of soft core porn.  Ray is apparently quite the ladies man.

-In respect to events, this film sticks very closely to the book.

The Bad:
-The time frame is gone, the book takes place in 1969... this is easy to tell because they follow the Sharon Tate case through the book.  In the film, some of the people are dressed from the 90's, some from the 60's, Ray looks like a combination of a 50's greaser and an 80's punk with too much eyeliner.  The Sharon Tate information seems to be out of kilter because there is no sense of time other than that reference.

-Ray Pye's Mole and Makeup are distracting to the viewer, with him being the only male in the film wearing eyeliner, and that ridiculously huge mole that seems to have been played up... you're eyes tend to focus on the mole and miss the rest of the film.

-The music is all over the ballpark, and in many cases the death-metal sounding music both detracts from what you are watching, and also makes the dialogue difficult to hear.

-The Dialogue on the DVD is at times very loud and at other times, impossible to make out.  I am not sure if it's that the actors were mumbling or just too far from the mics but large parts of the conversations were completely unintelligible.  This specifically occurs when Ray is threatening people and leans down to hiss at them in their face.

-The relationships that were so crucial in the book are completely left out in the movie; Tim is simply a body with no motive, feeling or relationship with any of the other characters.  The relationship between the retired cop and the way too young for him Sally is almost confusing because so little is shown.  Catharine comes across as a completely different character than in the book, her power and intrigue never come across properly.

-Many people will get upset with me for this... I did not like the way Ray Pye was portrayed... specifically at the ending... I found him to be way over the top and he ended up coming across as more of a spastic showoff rather than a truly emotionally disturbed individual.  I never really bought that the character that he portrayed was capable of what he did.

In summation - This was an okay movie.  I have heard people compare it to ""Silence of the Lambs"" and let me tell you right now, they are WAY OFF.  There is plenty of gore and sex here to keep the young men happy, but the heart behind the story was left out.",1214784000,18,3262,4.341584158415841

3325194,3,B0012IX358,"Jack Ketchum's novel from which this film has been adapted (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lost/dp/0843948760/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lost</a>) was set during the mid to late 1960s. The film version is a little more ambiguous as regards when the story occurs. Modern cars and cordless telephones are much in evidence, but the central character, Ray Pye (Marc Senter), has a definite retro look about him. With his immaculately coiffured hair and discreetly applied make-up, there's something of Alex from `A Clockwork Orange' about him. He believes himself to be the epitome of cool; a party animal that the slightly younger kids are in awe of.

Only two, Jennifer and Tim (Shay Astar and Alex Frost), know that Ray is a cold-blooded murderer. The film opens with his brutal slaying of two young women (Erin Brown and Ruby LaRocca) at a local campsite. It is this event that casts its shadow across the remainder of the story, reaching, years later, into the lives of several of the inhabitants of the town of Sparta.

Although the film is a faithful retelling of the novel in terms of events, there is, I suppose necessarily, something lost in terms of characterization. This is particularly true of Detective Charlie Schilling (Michael Bowen), Ed Anderson (Ed Lauter) and Sally Richmond (Megan Henning). Retired police officer Ed Anderson has recklessly embarked on a love affair with Sally, an eighteen-year-old student. Their relationship is not explored in any depth and Ed's rollercoaster feelings of guilt and elation are nowhere near as prominent in the film as they were in the novel. Similarly, Schilling's obsessive angst at the police's failure to nail Ray Pye for the double murder is not apparent enough.

A slight disappointment, for me, was Robin Sydney's performance as bad-girl wannabee Katherine Wallace. In my opinion, she was miscast in this role. Her dialogue is indistinct in places and her body language is unconvincing in this role of the confident young woman whom Ray Pye falls for. Additionally, the soundtrack music is unnecessarily overbearing at times. Yes, we know horrible things are happening, and we know Ray Pye is a sick and twisted individual, but we don't need skull-pounding noise to remind us of that.

For the most part, however, this is a stylish horror film. Marc Senter is superb as the demented Ray Pye, and aside from the already mentioned reservations, the rest of the cast is excellent. The violence is powerfully depicted and horrifying to behold.

There is an interesting audio commentary from Jack Ketchum which should appeal to his fans as he talks about his various writing projects. The bonus material also gives us a look at Robin Sydney's and Shay Astar's auditions. For those who have read the novel, you may be interested to know that the scene where Ray steals some beer from a convenience store while Katherine, ahem,  distracts the clerk is missing from the film. The good news is that it does appear in the deleted scenes.",1207958400,3,3035,5.133603238866397

3325196,2,B0012IX358,"The second film to come out based on a Jack Ketchum novel is very disappointing.  The first, The Girl Next Door, stuck close to the novel and was a very compelling movie.  The Lost is a rare example of how you can stick very close to your source material yet miss so much.
The story concerns a short fused, womanizing psycho named Ray Pye who one day for kicks, kills two girls in the woods on a camping trip.  Ray's girlfriend, Jennifer and his best friend, Tim are also there and sworn to secrecy.  Four years later, the police are still investigating.  They know it was Ray, but have no proof.  Ray becomes smitten with a sexy brunette named Katherine.  He also has eyes for fellow employee(he works at a motel with his mother)Sally, who is involved with one of the detectives who had investigated the murders.  Sally has no interest, but Katherine gets involved with Ray.  Ray drops his guard a bit as he becomes quite taken with Katherine, but she more or less sees Ray as a way to pass the time.  When he's kicked to the curb by all the women in his life, he snaps, making way for a bloody climax.  The novel was great, and like The Girl Next Door was based on a true crime.  The movie however isn't great.  First off, the story took place in the 60s, but for no good reason is now updated to modern times.  It's shot in that typical irritating style that most movies are done in now.  The camera jumps around, goes to grainy stock, blurs, speeds up, and this is usually accompanied by a loud blast of death metal or some other junk.  Speaking of which, this has some of the worst friggin music in it, though the inclusion of The Pied Piper is fitting.  If I wanted to watch a damn music video, I'd watch a music video.  Most importantly, there is a complete lack of characterization here.  Ray is given depth, but no one else is.  In the novel, Ketchum gave every character depth and personality.  Tim's crush on Jennifer is nonexistent in the film.  In fact, Tim is rather pointless, period.  The character of the detective, Ed(played by Ed Lauter), a major player in the book is only in a few fleeting scenes and you wonder what the point of his character is at all.  Nobody is fleshed out and you couldn't care less about any of them.  You don't even need to have read the book to see how boring, underdeveloped and lifeless these people are.  I do have to give praise for the casting of Marc Senter as Ray.  He's the only good thing about the movie.  He's got the right slimy yet suave demeanor.  He has Ray's swagger down pat and a great rockabilly-type look that's fitting to the character.  When it's time for him to go psycho, he's pretty convincing and creepy.  The climax of the film is well done, not because it's brutal and violent, but it's only then that the film seems to work up any of the tension and suspense of the novel.  By then it's too little, too late though.
Now, this is all just one guy's opinion.  You may very well like this movie, and think I'm talking straight outta my behind.  That's not only fine, but dandy as well.  I just have strong feelings about it coz I liked the book so much, and I hate seeing a great story turned into a very typical movie.

After the ""action"" in the beginning, the viewer is treated to an hour and a half of tedious dialogue and meaningless storylines. It truly goes nowhere, and the acting is horrendous. The lead actor is a brainless sleazeball, and I'm not sure if he's supposed to come across as the moronic fool he does or some kind of evil persona. His friends are equally uninteresting, and only the policeman comes across as anywhere near a competent actor (and that's very little praise for said policeman). The town should have been nuked 10 minutes into this movie to spare us all the inane drivel. Anyhow, back to the lead actor, who's so bad I felt sorry for him at times. It's like he was doing a very bad Crispin Glover imitation, aka River's Edge days. The ending was so poorly contrived and executed I fast forwarded through most of it. Soooooo annoyingly played by every actor and actress. How this thing ends up with anything more that a 1.5 star average is astounding to me. There's great movies out there to heap praise upon, and I can't get why people are content to call this thing anything other than the trash it is. The gore was phony (and almost non-existent), embarrassing acting, no character development, nothing at all to draw a viewer into it.

The more controversial film adapted from a Jack Ketchum story is 'The girl next door', which was an electrifying and brutally frank film that was about as sick and twisted as any flm has ever dared to go. This adaption from another ketchum book isn't as brutal or horrifying, but it is still disturbing. That film was filled with brutal torture sequences that are so horrifying it is pretty much unbearable for most people to sit through. Both of these films have excellent acting, great direction, and compelling characters. Just as with TGND, there are characters that have no sense of right and wrong in this film as well. In the case of this film those that know of the central character's sadistic murders feel compelled to keep silent, and they feel permanently connected to him and remain silent about what they had seen him do. But in this case they seem to be committed to their silence because they fear him. The nature of our sadistic killer and what he is capable of is always just below the surface ready to ignite at any moment. He appears to be an odd and somehwat bizzare person that is also searching for love. As long as the females he shows and interest in have a similar interest he seems like a pretty nice and considerate person. But once he feels he has been seriously shunned, he sets out to unleash his darkest sadistic brutality on those he feels has wronged him. The end of the film reviels that there is a monster inside this young man that is capable of unspeakable brutality. I did however feel that the music in the film which was all great and memorable was applied far too often and it sometimes seemed a bit annoying to me. Much of this movie is a litte boring where nothing rather interesting seems to happen.

3325203,2,B0012IX358,"The Lost (Chris Sivertson, 2006)

Chris Sivertson, longtime friend and colleague of Lucky McKee, was bitten by the Jack Ketchum bug right around the same time McKee was, and the first Sivertson/Ketchum adaptation, The Lost, appeared in 2006. All well and good, with a few caveats: (a) Sivertson (who would soon after be responsible for the Lindsay Lohan vehicle I Know Who Killed Me) is not nearly the director McKee is and (b) The Lost is not one of Ketchum's better novels. Put these two things together and your chances of coming up with brilliance are pretty slim.

Plot: Four years ago, Ray Pye (Red White and Blue's Marc Senter), while wandering the woods with his friends Jennifer (Rocker's Shay Astar) and Tim (Drillbit Taylor's Alex Frost), came upon two young ladies out hiking (Misty's First Female Lover's Misty Mundae and Ruby Larocca) on a romantic getaway weekend. When all was said and done, one of the hikers was dead, the other barely alive, and Ray Pye and his friends had a very dark secret to keep. Fast-forward to the present day. Charlie Schilling (Kill Bill's Michael Bowen) and his now-retired partner Ed Anderson (The Artist's Ed Lauter) know Ray Pye shot those women, but have never been able to prove it. They keep trying to find ways to shake that tree, but it might get shook all by itself when Ray meets the new bad girl in town, Kath (The Gingerdead Man's Robin Sydney), who makes him think very dark thoughts indeed...

Before I go slagging this movie off, it's obvious that a lot of people threw a lot of talent at it, and in hindsight a number of folks who didn't do all that well here have really stepped up their game in the intervening years, especially Senter, one of the few bright spots in the recent The Devil's Carnival. None of which changes that fact that even Ed Lauter, normally the most reliable of character actors, couldn't turn in a solid performance to save his life in this movie, and I don't know why. Sivertson's not a great director by any means, but he's not that bad. And still everyone involved in this movie (and I only touched on a few of the names you will actually know) seems to have phoned it in.

The only film based on his writing that I enjoyed, was The Offspring. The most recent one I watched, The Lost, was by far his worst. The story is about two detectives following a guy they know is a budding serial killer, a man who they suspect in a previous crime. With no evidence against him all they can do is watch him. First off this film is very slow moving, to point where I almost turned it off. Second, the main character, Ray (Marc Senter), is a complete and utter moron. I don't know if the character was written that way or if the actor playing him was just that bad, but this guy was not believable at all! The story is rather hard to follow as well, mainly because throughout it, people just keep making statements about what they've seen or what they know, without providing those same details to the audience. Isn't the point of a good mystery to make the audience think and figure things out for themselves instead of just having someone tell them everything?

I went looking for recent indie horror that didn't get much attention, and in general I've been really, happy -- Colin, Pontypool, Splinter. There's a ton out there to enjoy.

The Lost is garbage. It lacks a compelling narrative, it evokes no sympathy or curiosity, it objectifies, it paints in black and white, but mostly, it's just boring.

There's a crazy guy. He's mean to women. Eventually he loses it and shoots a bunch of them. Yawn. The Ray character is barely written and poorly acted. None of the female characters are at all compelling, and frankly, it's hard to really care when anyone dies.

No suspense, as I mentioned -- you know he's going to go nuts, so, you know, hey, look, he's getting really angry -- maybe he'll seek therapy or find a caring adult who'll oh wait, no, he's just going to on a shooting spree.

Production value was terrible. Music was pretty good -- Califone on a couple of songs, I think?

It's 1965 in northern New Jersey and Ray Pye kills, for absolutely no real reason, two young girls who are there camping. Pye was with his girlfriend and buddy. Four years later he's still the chief suspect in the case but not enough evidence is available to nail him to the wall. He's a nut job and certain things are starting to happen that are pushing him over the edge. He pops a cork and goes on a killing spree.

Taken from a Jack Ketchum novel, that was based on a real case, this story is about Ray Pye. He has no father and does menial work at the motel his mom owns. He's short but good looking and somewhat (almost Charles Manson-like) charismatic. His closest friends do his bidding unquestioningly. But he's screwed up. This is one of the strengths of the movie. Shay Astor does a decent job as Pye. He's creepy. He's the bomb you're waiting to go off. I wouldn't want to be anywhere near him. He's the only one that is written well. The other characters are Okay but don't amount to much more than sketches.

A previous viewer mentioned how the details, such as the music, didn't fit the time in which this happened. This is a fair criticism. One of the things that made the movie ""Zodiac"" so good was how well hey depicted the time. There was none of that here. Cars, clothing, hairstyles, etc., were nearly nondescript. This might have been due to budgetary restraints. This is not an expensive movie, which might account for the lousy sound mixing and musical score. The volume levels were all over the place and some of the music included heavy metal which I'm pretty sure wasn't around in 1965. The directing was uneven at best. The ending was terrible. Pye shoots some of his victims and they don't all die at the point the police barge in. The one detective starts wailing on Pye and the movie just stops. What happened? Who lived? Who died? Was Pye killed at the scene? Was he arrested and put on trial? None of this was even noted in a post script.

But this movie seems to be taking itself too seriously. It wants to be insightful and real, but it ends up more like gore for the sake of gore. Just give me one or the other, y'know? That way it doesn't end up looking pretentious or amateurish, which The Lost does.

The Lost does not disappoint in this regard.

Ray Pye is a completely insane character study, coming as close as someone can to a young Charles Manson as imaginable.  On one hand he's charismatic enough to lure numerous young women into his bed, but on the other hand he's persuasive enough to get others to involve in his criminal activities.  Beginning the movie with one of his character flaws - he stuffs crushed cans into his boots to make up for his height deficiencies - is a perfect vehicle to lull the viewer into thinking Ray is weak.  In no time at all it becomes readily apparent that he's a sociopath powder keg of anger, inadequacy, and jealousy.  After killing two women for no reason other than the experience, the stage is set for Ray and his friends to keep it as a secret while Ray continues his disturbing behavior.  The murdering Ray does later as a result of being rejected by a few young women is as senseless as it is jaw-dropping.

The negatives of this movie are numerous.  At times it is very difficult to hear important conversations between Ray and others.  Aside from Ray, the character development is nearly non-existent.  In fact, there are two or three characters that could be taken out of the movie without any change.  As for the music, it's distractingly loud.  Last but not least, the ending, albeit shocking, feels rushed and lacking.  The positives, however, more than compensate.

First and foremost, Marc Senter portrays Ray Pye absolutely brilliantly.

Brilliant.  Other great aspects of this movie are the gore and violence, the explicit sex scenes, the bountiful babes (especially Robin Sydney despite her poor portrayal), and the pure craziness of it all.

The 2 guys, ""Ray and Tim"", end up spotting a couple of girls camping nearby and Ray decides it would be fun to kill them. The plan dosen't go as well as the guy thinks and things end up taking a turn for the worst. After this, Ray ends up dragging his friends into the scheme and they unwittingly become accomplices to murder.

Fast forward 4 years. It's now 1969 and the police are trying to find out who killed the camper. The plot interchanges between the cops searching and trying to pin Ray for murder and the audience getting to see how Ray lives his life and it's not pretty.

As the movie goes on you see how crazy Ray Pye is. He abuses everyone around him, he parties too hard and he even ends up killing his own mom. You also get to see Ray and his numerous relationships going on and the people he associates with.

The middle is drawn out and somewhat boring. It consists of Ray hanging out with his friends, doing drugs and having sex. By the time the ending comes you are a bit tired of it and hope the ending is even more dramatic and it dosen't disapoint as far as that goes.

At the end Ray end's up having a meltdown and everyone suffers for it. The ending was a bit of a let down. Though filled with drama, the conclusion ends very abruptly and you don't even know if the killer lives or dies.

 So we have a great beginning and a good yet disapointing ending and then about an hour and a half filled with not much of anything other than investigations and Ray abusing people.

3325217,2,B0012IX358,"I read the novel several months ago, and let this DVD sit around my house looking for the opportune time to watch it.  When the kids were finally away for a little while I popped it in, and have to say... I was a bit disappointed.  The short summary of the story for those who have not read the book:  Ray Pye is a slightly off kilter young man in his early 20's who on a random whim kills two young women while camping.  Now 4 years later the police know it was him but can not prove it.  Ray's two friends who know about the killings are slowly destroying themselves with drugs and alcohol, but their obsession with the murderous Pye is as strong as ever.  When the rejection of several women in town finally sets Ray off, he begins a murderous rampage.

The Good:
-The violence is all there, brutal and on screen.

-All of the sex is there almost to the point of soft core porn.  Ray is apparently quite the ladies man.

-In respect to events, this film sticks very closely to the book.

The Bad:
-The time frame is gone, the book takes place in 1969... this is easy to tell because they follow the Sharon Tate case through the book.  In the film, some of the people are dressed from the 90's, some from the 60's, Ray looks like a combination of a 50's greaser and an 80's punk with too much eyeliner.  The Sharon Tate information seems to be out of kilter because there is no sense of time other than that reference.

-Ray Pye's Mole and Makeup are distracting to the viewer, with him being the only male in the film wearing eyeliner, and that ridiculously huge mole that seems to have been played up... you're eyes tend to focus on the mole and miss the rest of the film.

-The music is all over the ballpark, and in many cases the death-metal sounding music both detracts from what you are watching, and also makes the dialogue difficult to hear.

-The Dialogue on the DVD is at times very loud and at other times, impossible to make out.  I am not sure if it's that the actors were mumbling or just too far from the mics but large parts of the conversations were completely unintelligible.  This specifically occurs when Ray is threatening people and leans down to hiss at them in their face.

-The relationships that were so crucial in the book are completely left out in the movie; Tim is simply a body with no motive, feeling or relationship with any of the other characters.  The relationship between the retired cop and the way too young for him Sally is almost confusing because so little is shown.  Catharine comes across as a completely different character than in the book, her power and intrigue never come across properly.

-Many people will get upset with me for this... I did not like the way Ray Pye was portrayed... specifically at the ending... I found him to be way over the top and he ended up coming across as more of a spastic showoff rather than a truly emotionally disturbed individual.  I never really bought that the character that he portrayed was capable of what he did.

In summation - This was an okay movie.  I have heard people compare it to ""Silence of the Lambs"" and let me tell you right now, they are WAY OFF.  There is plenty of gore and sex here to keep the young men happy, but the heart behind the story was left out.",1214784000,18,3262,4.341584158415841

Teen Ray Pye and his two friends are hanging out in the woods when Pye nearly collides with a naked beauty coming out of the outhouse.  He gets all hyper and worked up and spies on her. After seeing her share a tender moment with another naked beauty, he decides it's his duty to shoot them dead because them ""lezzies"" don't deserve to breathe the same air as him, I guess. I'm also guessing he's a bit sexually messed up. Wouldn't most guys at least snoop around to watch?! Not this one . . .

Fast forward 4 years. Pye is a little older, crazier and still a big offender of the guy liner. He somehow managed to get away with murder but the officer on the case knows Pye did it and is keeping an eye on him.

I don't understand how four years managed to pass without Pye getting the desire to kill again, seeing just how impulsive he was with the first murder spree.  But you just gotta go with the flow. So, as what seems like hours of my life pass me by, I'm forced to view Pye manipulate his pals, trash a house, hump any breathing woman who looks his way (and for some bizarre reason, many of them do - the pickin's must've been slim in that town), put drugs up his powdered nose, have fun at an amusement park (I kid you not, wish I were but `tis true) and generally act like a nasty little spoiled boy-man. There are also some side plots with a retired officer and his May-December relationship with a teen, etc and so on. It's all pretty boring, if you ask me. This movie is too long. Most of the entire middle could've been cut and I wouldn't have missed it.

After an eternity passes and my hair turns gray, things finally pick up AT THE VERY END. Pye, you see, has fallen in love with a bad girl and suddenly he feels like all of his ""girls"" have turned against him and exacts his revenge in a nasty bit of work at the end. The actor who plays Pye really hams it up at here and it amused me. He's spastic, rage-filled and yes, almost terrifying when he lets his inner demon out.

In the end, it's an uneven film filled with shocks and tension only at the very beginning and the very end. But the middle. Ugh, the saggy middle. It's bloated with a whole lot of nothing. It's basically one long series of ""a day in the life of an overly made-up, whiny, boring man-child who flies into fits of rage whenever life doesn't go his way"". Boo hoo, baby boy. Life stinks, wash your face and get over it.
If this sounds like fun to you, give it a go. This one wasn't for me.",1424908800,,2575,4.097222222222222

Some say the ending is too sudden and the tone too dark and nihilistic, but sometimes reality is that way as well and I do not fault movies for having these tones if that is the way of the subject matter (which it is.) Hope this helped!",1394236800,,393,4.051282051282051
