8325660,2,B000R1JI3M,"A band of Taiwanese rebels fight British army occupiers in order to get the corpse of their leader back. Some decent fights, but the dubbing is so horrible that it completely ruins the film. There is almost no sound other than the dialogue, making it almost unwatchable. To make it worse, the dubbers almost take a ""Kung Faux"" approach and add idiotic and humorless lines that clearly were not from the original movie. Buy at your own risk.",1221177600,,440,4.653846153846154
