2352464,2,B000A2X3RK,"I do like Diedrich Bader and Chris Parnell, but not enough to ever sit through this film twice.

Jokes aren't necessarily funny when they're repeated ad nauseam.  Tyler Labine, a giant on Kabijje (ha ha, yes, sounds like 'cabbage') doesn't realise he's shrunk to normal human size when transported to earth, and spends a large chunk of screen time stomping around and threatening to crush people.  Amusing? Yes. Amusing after five minutes?  No.

You really need to be in an uncritical frame of mind to appreciate this film - it won't hurt to be intoxicated, as well. Probably on Smirnoff Ice.

This film would've made a good SNL skit.",1288051200,,634,4.770642201834862
2352465,5,B000A2X3RK,"No, not really.

This movie involves an alien race of beings who have tremendous confidence but lack competence on a mission to conquer Earth. To compound this, the transport method they use inexplicably changes them to be less effective as they travel to Southern California to begin the slaughter of Earthlings.

The jumpsuit wearing protagonists struggle to complete their task before they are punished and become entangled in small time Earth drama and social customs as time runs out. When Earth is not adequately destroyed, the Great and Powerful Croaker is sent to punish them, who promptly gets entangled in the same way. Croaker's interaction with a restaurant assistant manager are absolutely hilarious.

This movie relies on ridiculousness to be funny, but also adds a strong streak of ""hint at the back story"" to keep it interesting. (In the same ways that Buckaroo Banzai has little plot points to make the imagination run.) So be ready to put away highbrow expectations before sitting down to watch this.",1252022400,,1018,5.083832335329341
2352466,4,B000A2X3RK,"This is a cheesy, campy cult movie.  If you are looking for high art, move on.  If you want a stupid laugh, it delivers.  The plot is meant to be preposterous, the acting overdone.  Plant-based aliens from the planet Kabij with a Napoleon complex come to Earth to behead 6 billion people in 2 1/2 days armed only with swords the size of cocktail skewers?  ""NOT A PROBLEM!""  A commentary on mindless optimism.  And it stars Sock from the TV show Reaper in a role sure to make him blush for years.  My family is turning it into a sort of Rocky Horror--we invite reciting the lines and audience participation.  ""BOW DOWN!""",1215907200,,619,4.455357142857143
2352467,5,B000A2X3RK,I usually like campy B movies but this one seems juvenile. It wasn't funny at all. I rate this only 2 stars.,1215561600,,108,3.9545454545454546
2352468,4,B000A2X3RK,"Silly, stupid fun.  Great viewing for a party.  Tory Spellman in a role suited to her talent level.  Unfortunately, the them song tends to stick in your head *laugh* though it is nice to hear Martha Davis again.",1141171200,,211,4.5
2352469,5,B000A2X3RK,"So you look at this movie and you say, ""this has got to suck"". Me too. Then I watched it. Words can not describe how funny this movie is. It's highly quotable and I've taken it on myself to throw several movie nights to introduce my friends to it. It's just one of those movies that fell through the cracks because it doesn't star one of the ""hollywood elite"" or pander to mainstream America. Do yourself a favor and see this!",1137283200,,426,4.271604938271605
2352470,5,B000A2X3RK,"""That cow will pay for its insolence!""  This movie is such a train wreck you have to see it more than once to understand and appreciate the overall hilarity of it all.  I loved it!!  But that doesn't mean much.",1134691200,,210,4.2
8072925,5,B000A2X3RK,"I can't believe I'd never heard of this movie until recently.

This incredibly low budget film is written by Chris Matheson (Bill & Teds and Rapture-Palooza, which should tell you something). It features two incredibly funny guys, Chris Parnell (SNL, 30 Rock, Archer), and Diedrich Bader (Drew Carey, Office Space, Veep, Napoleon Dynamite), and an impressive support cast as well.

But don't let the star power fool you - this thing looks like it was shot in a community college basement. But it uses that as a strength, it doesn't take itself seriously for even one second. Each scene is more ridiculously dumb than the last. Everything is over the top.

The first time I watched it, I laughed but fast forwarded a few scenes. But it drew me in, I wanted to watch it again. It's especially good with a few drinks. If you're not into that kind of movie, then consider this fair warning.

If you are into stupid movies, also check out You Might As Well Live.",1498089600,,957,4.6117647058823525

8072928,5,B000A2X3RK,"Are you the kind of person that quotes movies nobody has ever seen, but they really should? [such as Drop Dead Gorgeous or Plan 9 From Outer Space]

Get this movie, a case of Smirnoff Ice [yes, we are theme drinking here] and invite some friends over, and prepare to take over the world.

8072930,2,B000A2X3RK,"A rather bad high school teacher once advised her students, ""If you study high, take the test high.""  I think we can paraphrase that as ""If the script was written by stoners, stoners will like this movie"".  This may also be a good movie for small boys who have not developed their sense of humor yet.  There are good movies in this genre (Lost Skeleton, MST3K, etc.) and the two main actors can be funny with a good script. But their skills could not save this movie.

Part of the reason they have a two drink minimum at comedy clubs, besides the obvious revenue, is that it makes meh jokes funny and funny jokes hilarious.  I'm not sure how much I'd have to drink for this puppy.  I might file it under guilty pleasure along with Max Neptune (which was better), or under total waste of 90 minutes, depending on blood alcohol level.  The real question is whether that blood alcohol level is safe or lethal in your case.

About the only humorous undertone is the concept that some leader can order impossible violence with minimal resources, like North Korea or snobbish clueless deluded individuals who think they can sue anyone who they suspect has a negative response to them on the subway. Maybe it's funnier in California, where such personalities are like a zombie apocalypse having run its course, founded university Zombie Studies programs, and had zombie stoner kids.  And with that, we have found the target audience of this movie.",1366156800,,1440,4.682539682539683
8072931,5,B000A2X3RK,"This is probably the dumbest movie I have ever seen.  That being said, I have seen it probably 10-12 times.  It has a very mystery science theater vibe to it.  It's a great flick overall, if you like dumb, cheezy, movies.",1356048000,,221,4.341463414634147
8072932,2,B000A2X3RK,"This movie was recommended to me as one of the funniest movies I will ever see in my life.  Horrible acting & even worse script.  After watching it the first time, I thought I should have watched it drunk.  Would be much funnier.  Wine colored Onesies.  Tyler yelling all the time.  A Tori Spelling look-a-like.  Watching it drunk made it worse.  I'm giving it 2 stars because of the Onesies.  Maybe you need to be high to laugh at this.  There's having a dry sense of humor & then none.  Deidrich & Chris are funny guys when they have quality stuff to work with.  Just wish they would have.",1327536000,,591,4.321100917431193
8072933,4,B000A2X3RK,"The first half of this movie has an occasional laugh, but as several people have said, the jokes are repetitive and it does have a SNL-skit-stretched-out-too-long sort of thing going.  It just seems to be trying too hard to be funny.  I actually turned it off halfway through and almost gave up on it.  Later, I decided since I paid $11 for it, I should finish it.  Then Tyler Labine shows up.  I laughed until my stomach hurt.  The eyebrow women.  The infomercials!  It's like they took all the funny out of the first half and put it in the second half.  Here's my advice:  during the first half, microwave some nachos, drink a couple beers, chat with your friends who can't believe you made them sit through it.  Then when Tyler Labine is unceremoniously dumped onto the Earth, settle in and watch the rest.",1304121600,,809,4.510344827586207
8072934,5,B000A2X3RK,"I love this movie. I know many people will find it too silly or poorly written to like but you have to give it a chance. The story of 2 aliens coming to earth to cut off every persons head in 2 days is just absurd. Especially when their swords are shrunk to the size of cocktail picks. However, they never give up and when they fall for the local unibrow sisters, it's just too much. Filled with many classic lines and an ocean of Zima, this is a classic. ""That cow shall pay""",1304121600,,476,4.074468085106383
