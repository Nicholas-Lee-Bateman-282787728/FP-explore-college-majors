5944095,5,B00EUEBL0K,"We love watching Masha and the Bear on YouTube, but there are only a few episodes that are in English. We were thrilled to see this DVD was available with an English soundtrack. The DVD arrived quickly and in perfect condition. At first, we weren't sure how to play the English soundtrack because everything is printed in Russian. After a few attempts, however, we finally figured it out.

It has been a real treat to watch all of our favorite episodes in a language we can understand. We hope more episodes will become available in the future. Masha and the Bear is a breath of fresh air when it comes to children's programs! No propaganda or educational messages. Just pure fun in a beautifully animated format that can be enjoyed by adults as well as children. Thank you!",1389916800,9,774,4.608695652173913

5944098,5,B00EUEBL0K,"I got started watching these with my granddaughter in Russia and became hooked on them there.  There's a minimum of dialogue so even if you don't speak Russian you can still understand the plot of the shows.  They do tend to be somewhat repetitious, but are always enjoyable.  Masha is the loveable ""Dennis the Menace"" type and the bear is a more patient version of Dennis' neighbor Mr. Wilson.  The computer graphics are superb.  I really can't think of anything about the series that I dislike - very well done.",1426032000,,513,4.655555555555556
5944099,5,B00EUEBL0K,My child loves this show and so do I! We don't speak Russian but you don't need to! The DVD arrived very quickly in good condition. Thank you!,1425427200,,142,4.107142857142857

5944103,5,B00EUEBL0K,"I watch them in Russian with a 1 year old who is always happy when I put on the videos.  The language does not matter you can understand the stories and you just might learn some Russian.  The stories are so cute and charterers so well developed, see if they come to the US nothing wrong with exposure to as many languages as possible.

Hint the Bear is named Mishka....",1419552000,,370,4.257142857142857

5944106,4,B00EUEBL0K,"My 2.5 year old Loves Masha & the Bear! The animation is fantastic! However, after watching it in English I would recommend keeping it on Russian. Her voice isn't as cute in English & she is pretty whiney, as well as, mishchievious! This show doesn't aim to be educational either. Still a fun additional option to entertain little ones ",1412899200,3,336,4.694915254237288

5944114,5,B00EUEBL0K,"8/23/14 I Ordered this from bunny express on Amazon about 2 months ago. My 5 yr old and 3 yr old love Masha and the bear. It is a Russian cartoon that we found on youtube. Even in Russian the little girls voice and facial expressions are adorable. The kids love it. I ordered this DVD because it has the option to play the episodes in english. The bix and disk are all in Russian. I googled some words and figured it out. I don't know if the disk is formatted dufferently coming from Russia, but it will not play on our older DVD player even though it plays +\- R dvds? Oh well it does play in our Dodge Journey and on a toshiba portable dvd player. We just run a/v cables from the portable to our old Sony +\- R dvd player a d it works fine. One note the english versions are the same stories as the russian one's however the little girls voice is different a bit lower, but still very funny. It is also nice to know what they she is saying. We watch both translations they are just adorable in any language. Very fast shipping like 3 days or so and in great condition. I was very pleased and the kids love it. :)",1408752000,9,1114,4.068181818181818

5944119,5,B00EUEBL0K,"Good dvd, clear picture, clear voice
but the problem when I put English language they change every time when I turn it off.",1402790400,,123,4.391304347826087
5944120,5,B00EUEBL0K,"We came across this series on YouTube and even though Masha speaks Russian, my 4-year old great-grandson laughed his way through every episode as the warm-hearted bear endured the antics of precious Masha.  The DVD took only 2 weeks to arrive from Russia -- and now it seems there's a ""prime"" option as well. There was also a nice Masha keychain and instructions for the two menu options to select English. As one reviewer warned, the DVD did not play on my regular US DVD player (made by Samsung), nor did it play on my computer with the GOM media player I normally use, but the free VLC player (from [...]) works fine with a little trick -- after selecting the menu items for English as instructed, which still seems to do nothing, go to VLC's ""Playback"" menu, select ""Chapter"" and then ""Chapter"" again, and you'll be at the menu (in Russian) where you'll be able to select an episode.  It worked fine on my Win 8 desktop and also on a Win 7 laptop.  The only drawback is that only the dialog is in English; text items (such as signs and the bear's schedule on his alarm clock [which Masha will overturn anyway]) are not subtitled in English.  But the story line is easily followed in any case, so that matters little.",1402272000,,1220,4.457399103139013
5944121,5,B00EUEBL0K,"My daughter has been listening to Masha & the Bear in Russia for quite a while... I am glad that she can now listen at this show in english... just too bad that they just got 25 episodes out of the 42 on this dvd...

One of the main reason I bought this DVD was to get to singing on the 7 karaoke songs, but it turned out that they are just singalongs...

Great product overall",1401321600,,377,3.9473684210526314
5944122,5,B00EUEBL0K,"The DVD came in a very personal package with tea and a ""Masha and the Bear"" keychain! Masha and the bear is one of my favorite cartoons, and it's very useful for learning Russian.",1400889600,,179,4.294117647058823
5944123,5,B00EUEBL0K,"I am surprised that an American broadcaster has not licensed this yet, there is already an English dub with an American voice actress, which this disc has. The seller I got mine from (not from Amazon) was nice enough to include instructions on how to get to the English language dub.

It should be pointed out that this disc is NOT 37 episodes of Masha and the Bear - it has 25 episodes, plus 12 of a spinoff series called Masha's Adventures or something like that (just starting to learn Russian, so bear with me if its wrong). Only Masha and the Bear are dubbed in English, the other show is only available in Russian.

Highly recommend. Even as an adult, I am addicted to this show. A few coworkers and I eagerly await new episodes that get posted to YouTube.",1397865600,4,762,4.397163120567376

Total bumber and waste of $ and my kids were very disappointed",1433376000,,143,4.76
8609487,5,B00EUEBL0K,My English speaking children stumbled upon this cartoon thanks to a streaming video web site. They watched the videos and found them funny even though they don't speak a word of Russian. Getting this video was great as you can easily switch the language to English. The kids loved being able to watch this cartoon and understand what was really going on with the content. I have a few Russian friends and they were well aware of this duo.

8609489,5,B00EUEBL0K,"My son can watch this every day and not get tired of this video. Episodes are in Russian, but the cute voice of the little girl, the wonderful animation, and the bright colors would grab the attention of almost any child. Your child can pick up words in another language(we are teaching him Russian), and each story is of pixar movie quality!! Highly recommend!",1430438400,,361,4.65625
