3546692,1,B001E6RGII,"This is a abridged (30 minute) version of the film and thus is unable to relate the full intent, flavor of the book.",1246665600,74,116,4.086956521739131
8296863,1,B001E6RGII,"This was awful!  It was a  30 minute version of the movie that looked like it had been taped off of another film.  I paid $30 expecting to get the full movie and was totally disappointed.  I will never order from the Phoenix Learning Group, Inc. again.  I am now purchasing the full video from another company for only half the price I paid for this.  I normally can trust amazon but this purchase was a major disappointment!",1519948800,,425,4.384615384615385
8296864,1,B001E6RGII,Awful sound and picture.  Looked like it was a bootlegged movie.  My 6th grade classes were extremely disappointed.,1495756800,2,115,5.333333333333333
8296865,5,B001E6RGII,Very happy with purchase!!,1490572800,,26,5.75
8296866,1,B001E6RGII,Too expensive for the product.,1432944000,4,30,5.2
8296867,3,B001E6RGII,This is just a short abridge version of the book.  I also have the Hideaways and it is a great movie that follows the book nicely.,1426204800,,130,4.0
8296868,1,B001E6RGII,"The movie was not what I expected
Students were extremely disappointed as was I. It was an expensive DVD and not good",1393718400,5,117,4.363636363636363
8296869,3,B001E6RGII,"For anyone looking for this movie and want to get the ""complete"" movie, it is not actually called From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. It is actually called, ""The Hideaways"". This is the classroom 30 minute video.",1391558400,8,230,4.775
8296870,1,B001E6RGII,This is only a tiny portion of the story and I paid way too much to find this out once my students and I watched it!  Very misleading and disappointing!,1366329600,6,152,4.066666666666666
8296871,1,B001E6RGII,"This is a POOR adaptation of the book.  It only barely follows the plot, and does NOT represent the book well. Ingrid Bergman, as usual, performs her part flawlessly, but the movie itself is poorly written and is uninteresting, because it does NOT follow the storyline of the book.  It is definitely NOT worth the cost of the DVD.  I would give it NO stars, but I had to select at least one in order to submit this review!",1323561600,14,422,4.3164556962025316
8296872,3,B001E6RGII,"This is an abbreviated version of the VHS tape movie entitled ""The Hideaways"".  You will only get about 30 or 40 minutes of the movie - many scenes have been cut out - nothing in the packaging tells you this. For those who care, a full length DVD version of ""The Hideaways"" (as of November, 2011) has just been released - I'm sure Amazon.com will sell it when it is available",1321228800,18,375,4.28169014084507
