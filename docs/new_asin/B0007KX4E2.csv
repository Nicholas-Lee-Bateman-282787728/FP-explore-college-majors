8047867,3,B0007KX4E2,"I have many Baby Einstein videos which my grandson loved. This is along the same line . My grandkids watch it, but they don't seem to like it as much. It has nice music and scenery though which keeps them entertained. It also teaches. All in all a good product for the money.",1205107200,,275,4.2075471698113205
8047868,1,B0007KX4E2,"This video is very boring.  It had all but 1 minute of my 2 year old son's attention.  My 5 month old wasn't even interested!  There's nothing entertaining or educational about it, but to put you to sleep.  I turned it to something else after about 7 minutes of torture.  I can't see how this DVD got so many stars.  I don't know maybe it gets better after about 7 minutes.  If you want to buy something that's good for your little ones to watch; get the HBO classical baby and the Brainy Baby DVD's. My 2 and a half year old loves them both.  We have four of the Brainy Baby's (very educational) and the three pack of the Classical Baby that I originally purchased for my 5 month old, but my 2 year old can't get enough of that.  So please don't waste your money on this DVD.",1172016000,,776,4.12
8047869,5,B0007KX4E2,"My children are 2 & 5 and they just love this video. I've purchased other videos that claim to be educational and stimulating, but this one, by far, surpasses them all. The music is wonderful and I don't even mind listening to it repeat throughout the day. Thanks for thinking about what the children AND parents would enjoy!",1151625600,,325,4.620689655172414
8047870,5,B0007KX4E2,"I have three young children, ages 4, 3, and 4 months which all enjoy this movie. Which is quite an accomplishment in itself, given their varying ages. The songs are soothing for everyone.  My 3 and 4 year old play a game trying to shout out the names of the shapes before the movie does. As a teacher, I am very pleased to see a movie that engages in childrens learning.

I often let my children watch this movie on the way to and from school.  My only warning is that the music is very soothing and relaxing as you drive, so be careful not to doze off.  (But the movie also helps to get the baby to take a nap, yeah!)",1145318400,,618,4.040983606557377
8047871,4,B0007KX4E2,My toddlers love this more than baby einstein and baby genius.  It's the one movie they request everyday.  Very well done.,1143158400,,122,4.761904761904762
8047872,5,B0007KX4E2,This DVD is wonderful.  The music alone is great...add the visuals and it is a great educational/stimilating product.  My 8 month old gets so excited and screams in delight when he see the first scene and he knows it is coming on.,1142294400,,230,4.4523809523809526
8047873,5,B0007KX4E2,"Being a registered nurse working with pediatric patients, I believe your DVD is an excellent resource for learning. With the beautiful landscapes, music, and motions that appear on it; which give early stimulation to a child. Even my 8-month-old baby loves it; he watches it, pays attention to it without even moving, and the whole family enjoys it too. Thank you very much for the release of this great product.",1141516800,,412,4.9
8047874,5,B0007KX4E2,"This is a fun DVD for kids under three who love stunning visuals along with music. Even our oldest son, an autistic four-year-old, absolutely loves it. He loves to see various shapes changing into other shapes, and the animal footage is pretty fun for him as he tries to name everything that's going on. You see colorful birds, a tiger, elephants, orangutans, various small mammals from around the world, and lots of other animals. The nature visuals range from mountain waterfalls to beaches to the desert canyons to flowers (with stop-motion filming as a flower blooms). Shapes and colors are interspersed among nature shots in Sesame Street fashion (though without the flashy commercialized feel), and you see some repeating characters popping up to do fun things, either through computer animation or puppets. There's a pretty fun penguin with a hat and sunglasses who keeps popping up, and the stuffed bear is a favorite with our kids, especially when it dances to the funk beat. That always gets a giggle. Children pop in here and there as well. One really cute scene has a girl falling asleep as she's eating, with stuff all over her face.

In a few parts, a girl's voice says the name of a shape or an object being drawn, but there's not much in the way of words. There's a music soundtrack throughout the whole thing, with classical and original compositions, using a wide range of timbres. Our oldest son drums along with the soundtrack as he watches and calls out the names of things as they come up. The special features allow you to watch just the puppet portions, just the scenes with the computer-generated boy and girl who are pictured on the front cover, or just the parts involving the naming of shapes, fruits, letters, and colors.

One of the original goals of the husband and wife team who created it is to display the beauty of the world God has created while stimulating children's senses. They've succeeded. Some of the visuals are really beautiful, and kids love it. It's got a half-hour running time, and our kids are fixated for much of that time. The creators of this video have children in the age group this is intended for (0-3 years), and they certainly know what kids in that age group enjoy and what will facilitate learning some of the basics. I highly recommend it.",1125792000,3,2301,4.721393034825871
8047875,5,B0007KX4E2,"Mimi and Sam was sent to our children as a gift.  What a treasure this is!  The creators obviously understand babies and toddlers.  My kids (aged 20 and 27 months)were so-so with the Einstein videos.  With Mimi and Sam, they actually stand in front of the tv and respond to the images and repeat everything that that is said. The child that does the voice over sounds natural and our kids respond better to it than the voice overs on the Einstein videos. We laugh every time my 2 year old daughter trys to say triangle!  The puppets are cute too.  They lend a bit of humor to the show but don't detract from it.  In the Einstein series I've heard parents say that some children are afraid of of some of the puppets (e.g. dragon that goes ""blah!"")  M&S  puppets are sweet and gentle.  A cool penguin, a playful monkey....  etc.  Our kids especially loved the shots of babies and children playing.  They are in natural kid settings (playground, outdoors) and not in a studio.  So they can imagine doing what the kids are doing.  Of course toddlers love seeing babies and there are several sweet shots of them.  The music is quite nice as well.  While it is nice to use classical music, I think some other videos over-use them for lack of original arrangement and composition.  There is a nice ballance of the standard tunes, classical and original composition.  Another plus for this title is the wonderful animation clips.  My kids liked the 3-dimensional floating bear that appears several times.  There are geometric shapes that would appeal to infants as well.  All-in-all you can't go wrong with this one!  We love it.",1107734400,2,1621,4.610526315789474
