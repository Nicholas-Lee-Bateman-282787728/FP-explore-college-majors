8574573,5,B00BVR46V0,"This is a very solid offer from Ken.  It details the Cheng Style 8 Changing Palms form.  (Looks to be Liu Jingru's form.)

* The entire form is demonstrated in slow motion and normal speed.
* Each palm is demonstrated and explained.  Details of body mechanics are offered.
* Ken coaches a student through each palm.
* And the applications - numerous applications - of each palm is explored and demonstrated with a student.

What distinguishes this DVD from similar others are the exploration of applications, often omitted or left wanting in others.

I practice the Sun Zhijun form (also Cheng style) and often wonder what applications there could be apart from the few I know.  There are enough similarities with Ken's form for me to decode a lot of what is implicit in the Sun form.  Additionally, what this DVD did for me was teach me how to decipher the various subtleties inherent in the forms.  It is clear this is where Ken's strength lies.

There is a comment by Liu Jingru about how Bagua masters of old made their name with just the Single Palm Change (the first of the eight palms).  I often wondered how that could be the case.  After understanding the applications implicit in the palm change from studying this DVD, I can see how that could be the case (one of the reasons).  This DVD has encouraged me to revisit each palm in some depth.",1365120000,4,1352,4.560165975103734
