5622275,5,B00BHX898O,"I got my DVDs today in the mail and it came with the movie that started it all. I watched the movie which I had never seen and now watching Season One of the series. They came in great condition and are playing good so far. The DVD series is for Region 2, but I just bought a Region Free player from Amazon so I can play them on it or on my new Blu-Ray player (that I didn't realize would play them). This TV series is one of my favorite series that I found on Netflix a couple of years ago. Heartland is my other favorite TV series. If you haven't seen this series, I highly recommend it.",1424304000,7,589,3.957983193277311

8568778,1,B00BHX898O,"Im very disappointed in how this package arrived. Its nothing like the picture.  They didn't come in the box that was pictured above. The boxes were crushed. Thankfully the dvds were okay.

I will have to find a way to store the dvds since the boxes it came in clearly won't last. This was a gift for myself thankfully. I would be so upset if I was giving this to someone else. If the seller would have taken a little more time packing this item this wouldnt have happened.

Now to review the show. I loved this show while it was on Netflix!",1513728000,2,541,4.233009708737864

8568782,5,B00BHX898O,"I LOVE this series!  I had seen it before.  I took a Mcleod's Daughters tour while we were in Australia and saw various places in the Barossa Valley where it was filmed.  The tour guide mentioned so many things I had forgotten that I asked my husband to buy it for me for Christmas.  We were told we would need a special DVD player for it since it was filmed in Australia, but it seems to work fine on our regular home entertainment unit.  It is  really entertaining.  When I first watched it,  my husband got hooked on it and would stop what he was doing to come watch it with me.",1483315200,2,581,4.125
