What is extremely disappointing to me were Kissinger's views that we must negotiate with Russia rather than embrace the need for partnership with our MAD WMD's equal. We must admit up front that the most powerful nations owe it to the human race to partner with each other to police the world, if necessary, to protect a win-win approach to global economy and a determined approach to 'no more major war' to global geo-politics.

Equally disappointing to me were Porter's conventional views on global competition versus global cooperation.

We know there is bias in favor of low cost producers -- and in favor of unconstrained inequality via acceptance of markets as the wisest institution man is capable of inventing.

But we also know that shopping is not the last word in economic sophistication. Rather it is only a rough approximation for a beginning.

Just as business has profited from 'management by objectives', Porter's desire for strategic thinking will profit from 'strategy by objectives'.

Our objectives must be very high minimum and median standards of living-- not the mean standard of living.

Markets have never delivered very high minimum and median SOL's.

I wish Porter had said that. He does not appear to me to be an ardent supporter of the Second Bill of Rights (economic rights) -- asked for FDR in January 1944. Sixty-five years later Porter appears to be deaf to FDR's advice.

We are at a turning point in history. Will Charley Rose ask to see a real map with (visual aids) to clarify ambiguous models -- and give the American nation a real choice: 'win-win', or 'winner try to take all'-- as the human race destroys itself.

It is true that individual ambition and curiosity in the rare genius must show us how to do what must be done that has never been done before.

But collective cooperation must prevent the work of genius from being co-opted by the ignorant in pursuit of mass self-destruction.",1229472000,3,2048,4.873198847262248
8279374,4,B001AS4O76,"Former Secy. of State Henry Kissinger who has just returned from a trip to Russia talks with Charlie Rose about the importance of the U.S. being in cooperative relations with Russia. He speaks about the geostrategic centrality of Russia as bordering on three areas of major U.S. concern, China, Europe, the Middle East. He speaks about the importance of Russia for any attempt to deal with proliferation of nuclear weapons. He does not however go into real detail about Russia's rogue actions especially in regards to its relations to Iran and Syria. Nor does he point out the spoiler- rival role Russia has in a sense renewed in its relationship with the United States. Kissinger's line is that the United States and Russia have to make clear their own interests , and also mutual interests and work together in a number of areas. He also does not go into depth regarding the internal difficulties and problems of Russia, problems recently aggravated by a sharp fall- off in the price of oil, its principal export and money- maker.
Michael Porter comes to speak about the absence of long- term strategic American policy planning. He indicates a first priority must be the U.S. educational system. He points out that the U.S. is now twelvth or thirteenth in percentage of students who graduate from college. He says that the percentage of the population that has graduated from college has not risen over the past thirty years. He says that a skilled workforce is key to competing in the global workplace. He says that American governments tend to go from problem to problem, from crisis to crisis without having an overall sense of where they should be going. He also commends the Obama transition to this point and indicates it gives signs of understanding the overall planning problem.",1229472000,,1788,4.884868421052632
