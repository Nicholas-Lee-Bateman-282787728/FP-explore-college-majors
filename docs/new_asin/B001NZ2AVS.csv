8328428,4,B001NZ2AVS,"The movie was very good in its special effects. The clowns are really crazy and kill for no reason. The main clown is more ov a Vin Diesel type who has no spoken lines only grunts. What a waste of a good actor. I bought the film to see an actress who I like alot, Savannah Costello who played the girl who enticed the two boys into the barn for sex and got cut in half by the clown with an axe. She played the naked dead girl in carver but had no spoken lines. her next film is about Hugh Heffner and she plays his wife.",1278633600,,520,3.869158878504673
8328429,4,B001NZ2AVS,"Having not been a fan of the first Clowns movie I figured $2.99 wasn't too much to drop to find out if this one was better.

Better? Absolutely. I'm not sure what the 1-star review above is talking about, maybe the first film, but this film has 3 clowns and a hefty body count. Yeah, it's very low budget but compared to the first Clowns(and other Clown horror like SICK) this is good fun.

Basic story is that the main clown escapes from the asylum with 2 other nutsos who also decide to dress like clowns. Why? I dunno but I'd guess it because they're NUTSO.

They go after the girl from the first movie who needs to start getting naked in these movies(my only complaint), but the detective from the first film decides he's gonna kill the clown instead of arresting him. And he's got some merc buddies to help him do the job.

Beheadings galore, an awesome naked-girl chopped in half(gotta see it! Awesome!), and people shooting at clowns! How can you not like that?

I'd eventually get the dvd if they put a making of on it.",1265500800,5,1027,4.38421052631579
