2142996,5,B0002YCUR0,I grew up with these two Ewok movies since I was 6 years old (watching them over and over again) and they're still awesome! I recently watched both of them again to see how they hold up and they brought back so many pleasant memories. I can't wait for these to come to DVD (and I hope they have some nice extras on them along with good extras/sounds.) GO EWOKS!!!,1093737600,3,363,4.2

2143039,5,B0002YCUR0,"WARNING SPOILERS!  just recently discovered this gem. i did not know this existed until i looked up george lucas movies. i was lucky that one of the libraries had this movie. these two films tells two stories involving the bear like creatures that we all know and love and it gives wicket two full length films of his own, hey where is the wookie movies. i guess chewbacca was not that popular like these guys are in the second star wars movie or the fifth if ya want to get political. but all in all this was a good find and a great treat they take place right after i want to say return of the jedi. the first movie caravan of courage tells the tale of a star cruise that crashes in endor and parents get took by a monster. the kids get lost and the ewoks find them and nurture the little on cyndil back to health when they find out she is really sick. then the ewoks decide to help the kids find their parents. cyndil and wicket become good friends on the journey. they end up rescuing the parents and everyone becomes friends. and the second movie the battle for endor sees the dad fixing up the star cruiser but a tyrant called terak who thinks that the engine power device is a source of magic and kills cindels dad to get it and destroys the ewok village capturing ewoks and kills mace cindel's brother and her mom in the process. wicket tries to protect his village but get captured in the process and so does cindel. the two escape and wonder into the woods and run into a playful and fun creature called teek who takes them to a hut where an old hermit named noah played wonderfully by wilford brimley. noa at first does not like the kids but ends up taking them in. terak fed up that he can not get the device to give him it's powers sends his witch that can turn into a raven to get cindel after she tells him that she can unlock the power. so the witch succeeds and noa, wicket and teek go to rescue her. they find teraks castle free the ewoks and cindel and escape noa sees the device and takes it to a ship that he and his friend was on that crashed there years ago. that's how terak got the whole idea about the power was from noa's friend. then they fight thier way back and win. with the help of the ewoks cindel and noa then leave endor saying goodbye to their friends. these two movies are great. and a good edition to you're star wars collection. the acting was great and the story was good. the special effects were not bad at all for it's time. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do. until next time have a cinematastic day",1505952000,,2564,4.179797979797979

2143069,3,B0002YCUR0,"The Ewoks, the race of savage teddy-bear-like aliens our heroes encounter in ""Return of the Jedi,"" are a love-it-or-hate-it point for Star Wars enthusiasts.  People either like the moments of levity and the plucky courage they brought to the final film in the original trilogy, or they hate them and wish the entire population had died out during the Death Star explosion.  (And yes, entire essays have been written in favor of or against an ""Endor Holocaust"" -- this is the Internet, after all.)  I personally am neutral toward the furry little critters -- they aren't my favorite of the Star Wars aliens, but they aren't entirely obnoxious either, and actually have an unexpected fearsome warrior side... a side that sadly vanishes in most spinoff material, such as the way-too-cutesy children's books or the ""Ewoks"" Saturday-morning cartoon.

The Ewoks happen to take center stage in this double-feature DVD... and yes, if you hate the Ewoks you probably are better off skipping it.  If you can stand or like them, then your mileage may still vary -- I thought it was merely okay, if rather contradictory to the movies and with some weird elements that don't feel like they belong in the Star Wars universe.

The two movies in this DVD tie together, and share a human cast -- a family of four that crash-lands on Endor sometime before the events of ROTJ.  In ""Caravan of Courage,"" the parents of said family are kidnapped by a fearsome giant, leaving children Mace and Cindel to fend for themselves.  They're eventually found by Wicket the Ewok, who takes them to his village for protection, and leads them on an expedition to find and defeat the giant and rescue the children's parents.  In ""Battle For Endor,"" the Ewok village is attacked by a band of aliens simply called the Marauders, who are after a ship component that they might use it to leave Endor and reach the stars.  Cindel and Wicket flee for their lives, and soon end up at the home of a crotchety old hermit named Noa and his speedster-alien friend Teek.  With help from their newfound friends, they must somehow defeat the Marauders and their ally, a sinister sorceress named Charal... and find a way for Cindel to leave Endor and return home.

These movies were made for TV in the '80s, so one probably shouldn't be too harsh a judge.  The special effects aren't quite up to par with the original trilogy, but are quite good for a TV-movie venture of the day.  The acting is pretty bad, though -- neither Cindel nor her mother can emote much, and while Mace's actor tries his best, his dialogue can sound a little awkward.  If you can sit through the prequel movies, though, you can probably suffer through the acting of this piece unscathed.  Also, Burl Ives serves as an entirely unnecessary narrator in the first film and sounds bored out of his mind the whole time... though at least Wilford Brimley (aka the Quaker Oats guy) provides some grouchy, snarky humor as Noa.

I have two big beefs with these specials, however, ones that I think a lot of Star Wars fans will have.  First, there are elements to both specials that feel weirdly out of place in the Star Wars universe.  I know many people will tell me that ""the Force is pretty much magic,"" but it has never been established that the Force can do many of the things shown in these movies -- shapeshifting, transforming objects into animals, ""magic"" artifacts, ponds imbued with supernatural qualities, etc.  I know the Force is capable of doing incredible things in the movies, but even it has limits.

Second, there are odd plot holes in this special.  The Ewok village was located in the treetops in ROTJ -- why is it suddenly on the ground?  I understand budget concerns might have been an issue, but it's an odd choice story-wise.  Also, the presence of a Force-strong witch on Endor seems odd -- the Expanded Universe explains that she's a Dathomir witch, but how she (or the Mauraders for that matter) ended up on Endor is never explained.  The Expanded Universe also ends up bending over backward to explain the presence of horses and ponies in the Star Wars universe, both of which crop up here... but still, they're bound to make viewers do a double-take when they see them.

While not necessarily a BAD set of specials, ""Caravan of Courage"" and ""Battle For Endor"" aren't exactly stellar either.  They're good time-killers, will entertain kids, and are interesting viewing if you've watched the movies and are curious to see more Star Wars material.  Just don't expect them to adhere to the established Star Wars universe, either the old ""Legends"" canon or the current Disney canon...",1491177600,,4627,4.7356608478802995

I did have a hard time though seeing real animals in it, since when did those live on Endor lol. Story is good and as others have said it is more a kids or family film. Would still make a good edition to any Star Wars movie collection.",1458518400,,371,4.166666666666667
2143104,2,B0002YCUR0,"I am reviewing this for adults of a certain age.  Younger audiences will be more forgiving.

There are four basic problems with these films:
1) The slow plot is awful... I see that Lucas got writing credit.. sigh
2) The accomplished Peter Bernstein did the music, but he was uninspired here, and the absence of the traditional John Williams Star Wars score is noticeable
3) Some of the special effects are very bad even by TV 1980s standards.  Yes, I know that this is pre-CGI.  But the spiders and their web (Caravan of Courage) are poor quality by the standards of the Halloween store in a run down strip mall.
4) Ewoks

and yet....

4) Some of the other special effects are actually nice, given the technology of the day.  I thought the stop motion animation was very quaint, reminiscent of Harryhausen films like Voyage of Sinbad.  The matte work was not bad at all.  Brief glimpses of the starship interior and launch in the second film are handled capably.  Blaster shots are okay.
5) Wilfred Brimley is likeable, Eric Walker is capable, and the actress who plays Cindel is surprisingly good for her age
6) Great forest settings

2143143,3,B0002YCUR0,"As a kid, I couldn't get enough ""Star Wars"". I was 7 when the first film came out, and have grown along with the series. With that said, I thought that after ""Return of the Jedi"", I thought that was the end. I remember seeing ads for the TV movie ""Caravan of Courage"" (I seem to remember it aired around Thanksgiving??), and I couldn't wait. I was 13, and while the Ewoks weren't my favorite part of the ""Star Wars"" universe, anything new was cause for excitement. I have to say, enjoyed the film, but hadn't thought too much about it since. I had actually forgotten about it until a few years ago when I was at our local Goodwill store and I saw this double feature DVD for $1. My daughter was 10 at the time and I thought she might like it, so I picked it up. My son is a Star Wars fanatic, but I didn't think he would be too wild about further Ewok adventures, he was about the same age as I was when this aired initially.

We never got around to watching the movies until just last weekend. I will say that they are great kiddie movies, and while my daughter hung in to watch them both with me, my son bailed about 20 minutes into the first film.

""Caravan of Courage"" - The Towani family has crash landed on the moon of Endor, and the parents have gotten separated from their kids. Before the opening credits, the parents are taken by a huge troll-like giant. The two kids, Mace (a 12-13 year old boy) and his little sister Cindel (I'm guessing 6-7 years old?) meet up with a group of Ewoks. The Ewoks take the kids in and nurse them back to health. The Towani siblings learn that their parents were taken by a monster known as the Gorax, so they, along with the Ewoks start out on a rescue mission.

""Battle of Endor"" - The Towani family have repaired their crashed ship from the first film, and as they are getting ready to depart, they and their Ewok friends are attacked by a witch and some space pirates (I think?). Almost immediately Cindel's entire family is killed, which was kind of a shock. She and Wicket are captured by the space pirates who have come to the Ewok village seeing a ""great power"" which they believe they've found in the ship's power cell. Cindel and Wicket escape and meet Noa, and old man who had crashed on the planet years ago. With Noa's help, Cindel wants to free the captured Ewoks and retrieve the power cell so they can leave the planet.

Both films are great for little kids, but there really isn't much here for adults except for the nostalgia factor. I am shocked at the price of this disk? I would imagine with ""Star Wars 7"" due out by the end of the year, Disney may re-issue this disk, so you may want to hold off on a purchase. I really don't recommend paying more than $10-$15 for this double feature.",1427328000,,2749,4.27063339731286

These movies return the audience to the Moon of Endor.  They give viewers more of it's Beauty, Magic and Danger.  The Ewoks, the fairy-like creatures, Giant Spiders, the Wolf-Monsters and the Gorax - all are so much fun.  Their adventures take them to the Ewok Village, through forests, across a dessert, and into caverns.

Modern movies still have special affects worse than those found here.  So for 30 year old special affects, these are incredible.  Mace and Cindel are great characters.  The Ewoks are the same characters from Return of the Jedi.  All played nicely, good acting.

The special effects weren't half bad and the characters did a pretty good job of acting.  Kudos to Warwick Davis for his portrayal of Wicket in both films.  I've seen him in several roles and he's always come across as a damned good actor.  The youngster who played Cindel also did a decent job, and Wilfed Brimley was excellent as Noa, the loveable old curmudgeon who wins the day... almost!  It's Wicket who actually does in  the evil wizard with some excellent sling marksmanship.  Still, they're both decent movies, well worth an afternoon's plotz on the couch with a large bottle of pop and a bowl of chips and/or popcorn.

The biggest surprise to me was how lackluster the DVD was. The DVD artwork and text is so blurry it's almost impossible to read but is printed on decent paper. The DVD menu is nothing like the one on the back of the box (which features an option button and scenes actually from the movie as it's backdrop), it's a plain blue static image of the Ewok tree village with 'play' and 'scene' with the Imperial March in the background of all things! Theres borderline no cleaning up of the film and there are digital artifacts apparent within the first 15 minutes of Battle for Endor. It almost seems like a knockoff but all the information i've been able to find seems to suggest that this is how it was released back in 04.

If you're obsessive about video quality it's the best thing available- better than streaming options (or lacktherof) but don't go into it expecting a commentary option or even subtitles for that matter. Looks like Lucas and Fox just copied a VHS, stuck the file in moviemaker and shipped it off into discount bins everywhere without a second look.",1402185600,2,1317,4.483333333333333

2143278,4,B0002YCUR0,"The Ewok movies have gotten a bad reputation over the years, but they are somewhat in the spirit of Star Wars and definitely worth watching. I'll review them in order""

CARAVAN OF COURAGE

The first Ewok movie kind of does deserve its reputation. Of the four members of the Towani family, the parents are horrible actors and Eric Walker as the older brother isn't great (he seems like he can barely bring himself to call the Ewoks his friends). Fortunately, the little Cindel is adorable and shows convincing emotion towards the Ewoks. I loved the scenes when she tries to explain the concept of a starship to Wicket.

The special effects are definitely dated. The Ewok masks were very stiff and look fake in the broad daylight (I wish Lucas would go back and make THESE Ewoks blink!). The stop-motion effects in broad daylight also don't look as convincing as what we saw in the original trilogy - surprising since ILM did them both. Overall, it's worth watching once, but probably not twice.

BATTLE FOR ENDOR

I thought this movie was surprisingly good. Lucas made the right decision to kill off the rest of the Towani family and just keep Cindel. She's the only one from the first movie whom viewers cared about. The movie focuses on her and Wicket as they try to escape evil Marauders. They meet up with Noa Briqualon (played by Wilford Brimley) and Teek, a furry white creature. Both are wonderful additions to Star Wars. Noa is probably the first truly crotchety character in the Star Wars galaxy - and the first to wear glasses. The interaction between him and Cindel is really wonderful.

The special effects are a step up, but I wish ILM had just a bit more money and time to perfect them. Wicket's face can now move, and while it sometimes looks goofy it's a huge improvement over the stiff Ewok masks from the first movie. The beats of burden suffer from the same stop-motion problems and make me realize CG is good for something.

As villains, the Marauders are OK, but not great (think the Jabba's Palace crowd). Their faces look too stiff and comical. Still, it's nice to actually have a powerful villain. The Dathomir nightsister as the Marauders' servant/partner was a nice way to give the villains a ""human face"" and way to get the villains to interact with the good guys. The actress who played her did a pretty good job at being both evil and needy at the same time.

Overall, BATTLE FOR ENDOR, despite some cheesiness, is actually an enjoyable Star Wars movie and a worthy entry into the saga.",1328918400,,2514,4.63370786516854

  The Ewok advetures are set between episodes 5 and 6 of the Star wars trilogy. There are no actors from the Star Wars series in either movie. Each film is in the area of two hours in length. And the sound leaves something to be desired.

2143310,2,B0002YCUR0,"I love children's movies, I love Ewoks, and I've been a huge Star Wars fan since it first appeared in 1977 when I was 6 (I saw it about 8 times in the theater with my dad). So I don't mind the 'kiddie' feel of these films or the subject; I know these movies are geared toward kids who love Ewoks, and in fact I watched them myself on TV when I was a kid.

I just got this double feature DVD and watched them again, and here's my take on them.

One thing not present in either movie is the big Ewok city in the trees. Was it out of their budget range? There was about an eighth of the number of Ewoks in these movies as in ROTJ. And they all apparently lived on the ground.

""Caravan of Courage"" is okay. 3 stars. You can sort of believe the Ewoks could perhaps invoke some mystical powers because of their druidic culture. And the story is semi-believable. It has a couple of the other Ewoks from ROTJ besides just Wicket. It is chok full of scary creatures and scenes that could really frighten young children, though, so make sure your kids are mature enough for this. I'd say at least 7, preferably 8 yrs old.

""The Battle for Endor,"" however, is absolutely awful (though not as scary). 0 stars. Witches, castles, dungeons, horses, swords, magic, dragons, rocky plains, and a moat... on Endor?!? It's the wreckage from a collision between Star Wars and Dungeons & Dragons. It gave me a jolt kind of like if Frodo had suddenly pulled out a blaster to shoot orcs. I am astounded that George Lucas was the creative force behind this travesty! (Hmm, well, considering the prequels maybe I shouldn't be THAT surprised! LOL) Anyway, it's ridiculous. I couldn't figure out if I was in the Star Wars universe or in Labyrinth/Legend! I mean, does no one else watching these see the really bad mix of genres here -- classic fantasy stuck right into the middle of a sci-fi world?

And the plot is soooo bad. Poor Cindel's whole family dies in the first 5 minutes of the movie, and she barely sheds a tear. When she really cries is when she has to say goodbye to Wicket and leave Endor with her new crusty old stranded-pilot-hermit friend. Riiiiggghhht. And there are so many other gaping plot holes. *sigh* that's 2 hours I'll never get back!

Of course, kids won't care about plot holes - so if you're thinking of buying this for children who love Star Wars, they'll probably like it. But only if they like Ewoks... and only if you're not a Star Wars purist who doesn't want their kids exposed to something that takes sooooo many liberties with the Star Wars universe.",1254441600,6,2561,4.415254237288136

2143328,5,B0002YCUR0,"First off, both of these movies are very underrated, even for the made-for-TV genre.  The second film, Battle For Endor, is the better of the two and has a very Return To Oz-like quality to it, since it involves the little girl main character of Cindel trying to save the Ewoks with the help of friends she meets throughout the film.  Anyone who loves stop-motion special effects will love the monsters in the movies.  I know a lot of other people make it a point that these films were aimed at children, which I don't understand because there's violence and actual death in them and they blow away any Harry Potter crap I've ever seen that apparently some adults who lack real taste in fantasy actually like and find ""good"" (again, Harry Potter is garbage compared to these films).  I would also watch the Ewok movies over ANY of the newer Star Wars Episodes (Yes, EVEN Revenge of the Sith).  Comparing the Ewoks to Jar-Jar Binks (like some people are fond of doing for whatever reason) is one of the most mind-boggling things to me, because the Ewoks are cute and funny while Jar-Jar is the absolutely most annoying, stupid, unbelievable, and downright worst Star Wars character ever created.  I would also suggest that you buy the DVD now.  It's now out-of-print and the price on it used is just going to continue to go up.",1211500800,,1326,4.593220338983051

2143332,5,B0002YCUR0,"Not everyone was a fan of the teddy bear-like additions to the Star Wars universe George Lucas introduced us to in Return of the Jedi (1983), but if you were (as I was), then you were in luck! Not only did Ewok fans get an animated series based on the cuddly creatures, but two TV movies as well! Naturally, the most popular Ewok of all, young Wicket W. Warrick, was the star furball in both TV outings which told the story of the Towani family, four humans who had become stranded on the forest moon of Endor.

The first of these all-knew, live-action Ewok adventures (said to have taken place shortly before Return of the Jedi) was 1984's ""Caravan of Courage,"" though it was better known in the U.S. as simply ""The Ewok Adventure"". In this first 96 minute film, a holiday charm is added to the originally late-November affair by the addition of Burl Ives as narrator. Perhaps this, along with having a story focused on a human family, was to avoid the troubles of the 1978 Star Wars Holiday Special in which the Wookie language composed far too much of the dialogue. Anyway, in ""Caravan of Courage,"" the two Towani children, a four-year-old girl named Cindel and her stubborn teenage brother Mace, find themselves in need of assistance when their parents disappear from the crash site of their family's starcruiser. Though Mace is reluctant to accept help the whole time, the selfless Ewoks form a questing party to retrieve the adults from the lair of the dreaded Gorax, a giant that is set on devouring the caged Towani parents. ""Caravan of Courage"" is a delightful film for the whole family, if you love Ewoks that is. It's a sweet, magical, and adventurous tale about family bonds, courage, faith, love, and unselfishness. Excellent for something different to watch around the holidays, and great for the Star Wars fan as new characters are introduced and we get to see (in both films) the last of old-school Star Wars visual effects.

A year after ""Caravan of Courage"" came the much darker ""The Battle for Endor"". In this narrator-free, more violent Ewok tale, Cindel soon finds herself to be the last Towani after a group of marauders attack the Ewok village searching for a mystical power source for their king. She and best friend Wicket escape from the hideous alien attackers and take up refuge with a crotchety old hermit named Noa (Wilford Brimley) and his fast-moving, furry friend, Teek. But, when the evil King Terak can't make use of the starcruiser power cell he stole from Cindel's family, he sends his witch Charal to capture the child.

Both Ewok films are excellent family features for children and Star Wars fans who are partial to Wicket and the other Ewoks. Just be aware that the second has more violence/death than the first, which has very little and makes it more meaningful. Fans of the Ewok battle antics in ""Return of the Jedi"" may be quite pleased to see similar action in ""Battle for Endor."" It's great to see these films released on DVD, and together no less. They are presented in fullscreen, and as far as I know, that is how they have always been. Unfortunately, there are no extras on the disc which is double-sided and oddly holds the second film on side A and the first on side B. Regardless, I highly recommend this classic double-feature DVD! Now, if only they'd release the complete animated series in season sets!",1197244800,14,3359,4.699490662139219

I still have those tapes, but more importantly the memories of being taken away into a fantastical world where cute little creatures had to stand up to evil.

The 1st movie of the two has at least a redeeming plotline.  But I was disturbed by the death of three of the main family members at the beginning of the 2nd movie.  It doesn't seem to have disturbed my son, but it bothered me as being a bit unneccesary for a young person's film.  My son seems to enjoy both films a lot and has watched them both a few times each.  He likes the 1st one featuring the older brother best.  Anyway, they may not be on the same caliber of the ""real"" movies, but for my son they work just fine.",1188259200,,851,4.140243902439025
2143336,5,B0002YCUR0,"Gunda beecha gunda, Star Wars fans!  The exciting sequels to `Return of the Jedi' starring your favorite Endorian fuzzballs are finally available on DVD.  And although it's one of those dreaded ""flipper"" discs, I'm happy to report that I didn't detect any defects...at least on my copy.  Unless you're an Ewok hater, these family-friendly features are sure to please.

The fun starts with 1984's `Caravan of Courage.'  The Ewok Deej and his two youngest sons, Widdle and Weechee, discover a couple of human children, Cindel and Mace Towani (no relation to Mace Windu), hiding in the wreckage of a downed starcruiser.  The voice of Burl Ives is heard above the treetops, but Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer is nowhere in sight.  So, the mop-faced forest-dwellers escort the frightened youngsters to the rustic Ewok village on foot.  Little Cindel's relentless, hacking cough makes it painfully obvious that the curly-headed waif is suffering from a nasty case of intergalactic influenza.  Fortunately, antibiotics are easily attainable on the forest moon of Endor simply by draining the sap from a nearby tree.  Miraculously, by the following morning Cindel is feeling well enough to play with a space ferret while teaching young Wicket to say ""Starcruiser! CRASH!""...which he does, ad nauseam.  That night, while the Ewoks sleep, the foul-tempered Mace unwisely chooses to ignore his sister's advice to hunker down with the Ewoks indefinitely, and drags the poor tyke away from the safety of the village to search for their missing parents (Jeremitt and Catarine) by the light of the enormous and ever-present blue moon.  This results in an unpleasant encounter with a ginormous warthog with very sharp teeth and claws.  The heroic Ewoks race to the rescue and handily dispose of the hideous monster with one feathered blow-dart.  Later, the walking hairbrushes manage to convince their skeptical orange-clad guest, Mace, that the only way to ascertain the whereabouts of Mr. and Mrs. Towani is through a consultation with Logray the mystic.  Employing a rather unconventional--yet remarkably effective--method of locating lost loved ones, the striped sorcerer spins a top and gazes into it as it rotates.  Logray's magical top reveals that the unfortunate mom and dad are now the prisoners of a terrible bat-faced behemoth known as Gorax.  Before you can say ""Yubnub, yubnub,"" the intrepid siblings and their furry protectors have assembled the ""caravan of courage"" and the Gorax hunt is on.

The second adventure, released in 1985, is entitled, `The Battle for Endor' (or if you prefer, you could call it Goldilocks and the Three Ewoks).  This film seems to have more of a Star Wars feel than its predecessor, with all the aliens and whatnot running around blasting everything; plus, the picture is noticeably brighter and sharper.

In the first act, the Towani family's still grounded spacecraft is ambushed by a hoard of lizard-lipped marauders with laser rifles.  After obtaining a glowing cylinder from Jeremitt, the reptilian ruffians--led by the bristle-bearded Terak and his witchy human assistant, Charal--hop on the backs of their `Land of the Lost'-style dinosaurs and proceed, with alacrity, to raze the Ewok village in a fashion reminiscent of Genghis Kahn...setting fire to the diminutive bears' quaint little houses and kidnapping the adorable hairy dwarves as they attempt to flee for their itty-bitty lives.  Though he more closely resembles Skeletor, the vile Terak does his best He-Man impression as he holds the small cylinder from the starcruiser above his scaly head while shouting, ""The power! I have the power!""  A terrified Cindel witnesses the carnage and runs away as fast as her tiny silver space boots will carry her.  Alas, she doesn't get very far before being caught in the sinister clutches of Charal the crow lady.  The crestfallen child joins the Ewok captives in a rolling prison, which appears to have been constructed from the ribcage of some large, long-dead animal.  Cindel's spirits are raised a bit when she sees that one of the vertically-challenged prisoners is none other than her dear friend, Wicket--who can now speak English almost as well as Yoda.  ""Wicket Cindel's family now,"" says the fluffy optimist, ""Must have hope...must escape!""  And escape they do.

Cindel and Wicket's journey through the vast expanses of the primeval forest leads them to the unkempt residence of a swift-footed, buck-toothed critter named Teek and a curmudgeonly old hermit named Noa--as portrayed by the incomparable Wilford Brimley.  Although he seems to be in a perpetual bad mood (probably because it's nearly impossible to get medical supplies delivered to your door when you live on the forest moon of Endor), Noa reluctantly allows the two ""little beggars"" to spend the night.  Maybe because he's really not the ""mean old man"" Cindel thinks he is, or perhaps he just hankers for another batch of the pint-sized chef's delicious homemade porridge and biscuits (or was it oatmeal and oat bran muffins?).  Of course Wicket and Cindel's stay is only temporary, as they have yet to free their incarcerated Ewok buddies and defeat the terrible Terak and his merciless Marauders in the epic Battle for Endor.  Will the grandfatherly grump and his chittering, floppy-eared roommate aid them in their perilous mission?

2143368,5,B0002YCUR0,"So the Ewoks eyes are funny, the dialog and narration could use some work (mainly, more of both would be nice), and the stories are downright cheesy.  The reason I love these films is that watching them brings back happy childhood memories that make me feel as fuzzy as the little furr balls on screen.  I was seven when the Ewok Adventure was shown on tv and that must have been the perfect age to absorb this lighthearted tale.

I could never forget these wonderful bits:
* Cindel and Mace hide in a tree to avoid a rodent of extra-unusual size (a boar-wolf, or borra - favored pets of the Gorax)
* on the quest to find their parents, Mace touches a lake and suddenly finds himself trapped underneath it; his fellow travelers will have to be resourceful to save him
* at night, and all but one of the wisties fly into Cindel's eternal Candle of Pure Light; and the spare, adopted by Mace, turns out to be Izrina (queen of the wisties - though you don't learn that in this story) who will be helpful in the battle against the Gorax
* brave Chukha battles the giant spider and later the Gorax
* Wicket's silly 'stercroozer cresht' and other antics

It seems that modern kids can't really appreciate these SW tv classics, probably because they grew up with far superior visual effects and stories that have come from a foundation of twenty years of SW and other great sci-fi and fantasy tv, videos, games, etc (as well as the prior foundation for SW).  They may be spoiled in a way, but they do not have the hindsight to see how far we have come.  I do not envy them.

The Ewok Adventure is best veiwed in conjunction with the Buena Vista Records Read-Along Storybook 'Ewok Adventure.'  It fills in gaps in the story and actually changes some of the dialog for the first film (I think for the better).

Old star voyager Noa and little zippy Teek are memorable characters in the second film, in which Cindel and Wicket feature as well.  Noa actually does appear with some oatmeal which Cindel had prepared.  :o)  A nice synopsis of the two stories from the Star Wars Expanded Universe may be found on the Official Star Wars Website under Beyond the Movies > Expanded Universe > Television > Classic Television > Ewok Adventures > Cindel (Towani).",1148601600,4,2244,4.5

These movies really don't have the best acting, or plot, special effects, laser guns, monkeys, etc. but they are still fun for the whole family.

Fun for any star wars fan's collection. A must see for any fan of oatmeal and other Wilford Brimley products. I was disappointed in the lack of oatmeal in this film, but was satisfied with the scene where Wilford is getting out of bed and you get a peek at his underpants.

When these made for  TV movies came out it was a big deal.  They offered special effects of almost movie quality with the appearance of the adorable Ewoks!

The Battle for Endor is worth the price alone.  It is a suprisngly dark and violent family movie.  The action is fast paced.  However, the film also has alot of heart too.

The art design for these movies are wonderful, but defintaly a departure for the most part from the classic Star Wars look.  It seems like these films were trying to imitate the sword-and-scorcery-with-a-dash-of-sci-fi look that was made popular in He-Man, Krull and Thunder Cats.  The laser weapons almost look medieval in apperance with all the bandages roped around the rifles and guns.  The main villain in Battle for Endor even reminds me of that Thunder Cat villain Mumra.

All in all, this is a great buy for some Star Wars fun done 1986 style... map paintings, stop motion animations, blue screens, alien rubber masks and of course Wilford Brimley!",1138838400,5,1152,4.588235294117647

I knew I'd seen it over and over again on TV.

Today my kids picked up a movie to show me it was Star Wars, and I was flabbergasted when I recognized the girl. I was like, ""that's it! that one is coming home with us!""

We're happily Ewok-viewing... and the kids are learning something more about the 80's beyond Peanuts, Garfield, Smurfs and slug-bugs.

Get this. I paid $10 today at the local discount store, but it's well worth the $11-something here... and your kids will love it.

I see it more as a light-hearted robinson curouso(spelled incorrctly of course) shipwreck on a primitive planet sort of adventure.  Ewoks, ogres and witches and so forth are a kid's kind of thing and it is meant for you to forget about Star Wars and focus on Endor.

I remember seeing these two television movies when during their original television release when they were named ""The Ewok Adventure"" & ""The Ewoks Battle for Endor"" - I was 9 when ""The Ewok Adventure"" was on television and 10 when ""The Ewoks Battle for Endor"" was released and I loved them then and now. After a bit of research I discovered that these two movies take place between ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,"" even though I remember them both coming out after the 1983 release of ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" back when I was 8 years old. Once again George Lucas was both writer & executive producer as he did with ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" & ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" and that in part is what made these two television movies so good, because George Lucas is a great storyteller, creating great characters and a great adventure to watch those characters grow within the film, but he is no director.

Even though these movies came out after the first trilogy had gone its course these movies were intended to give us a proper introduction to the Ewoks and their way of life - not to mention capitalized on their popularity. These movies are light-hearted and fun to watch and because their only connection to the ""Star Wars"" saga happens outside of these two movies these can be watched without any knowledge of the ""Star Wars"" storyline and still be enjoyed. These movies are pure fun for young and old and great for a family with children to have an evening of entertainment. I highly recommend both of these two movies.",1110931200,47,1655,4.513333333333334

2143391,3,B0002YCUR0,"These made for tv Ewok movies weren't that bad. I wish Lucas film would even release more made for tv movies with the StarWars universe after Episode 3. Well as long as we don't get...Jar-Jar Binks the movie. These are cute and harmless adventures. StarWars fans never really loved Ewoks that much but learned to not mind them that much after Jar-Jar. So releasing these movies now on dvd wasn't that bad of an idea. Some StarWars fans including myself actually have waited for them to be released.

  The first movie is called Caravan of Courage and is about a boy ""a wannabe Luke Skywalker"" and his sister who get seperated from their parents. Their parents are being heald captive by a giant. The two kids meet the Ewoks who decide to help them get their parents back. This isn't a bad movie, it mixes adventure with fantasy and isn't bad entertainment for kids.

  The second one is called the Battle for Endor. The girl from the first one is the only one left of her family after they are killed. Funny that her parents are killed right in the beginning of this one after all the trouble of rescueing them in the first one. Plus her brother who was the hero in the first dies right in the beginning as well. So all she has left is her Ewok friend Wicket (Warwick Davis). Together they meet a cranky old guy in the woods who takes them both in. He's played by Wilfred Brimley from Cocoon. He's really sweet of course and bonds with the girl. When she is taken by the Marauders that killed her parents. Brimley along with Wcket have to go save her and the captured ewoks. This is another one that's not bad.. The first had more of a story and had better creatures and better ideas though. The movie starts off dark but gets more lighter and more for kids as it goes along.  Also the effects are kinda cheesey but back then they were great especially for a made for tv movie. I think they should've just made a Ewok show eventually. Fans had a long way to wait before the next StarWars movie so it wouldn't have been that bad for fans who were craving more StarWars.",1106265600,10,2068,4.369791666666667

Why am I the only one who has a problem with the fact that this DVD is only available in Pan-and-Scan and not widescreen? Despite the fact that these films were intended to be released on television here in the States, they were actually released theatrically overseas... and they WERE originally filmed in widescreen (2.35:1 aspect ratio I believe for the first movie). Why then did Fox begin to think we'd be interested in cropped-for-TV versions of these now classic films? The simple fact that they didn't bother with a 5.1 audio mix should have been enough of a clue as to how lazy they were with this release.

I loved these movies when I was a kid, and would probably still like them if I saw them again, but I'm sure as hell not going to waste my money on this turkey of a release.

2143395,2,B0002YCUR0,"I find it grimly ironic that LucasFilm Ltd et al are falling all over themselves to provide DVDs of these two Ewok TV shows in all their uncut glory, rather than, say, A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.  Apparently, according to LFL spokesman Jim Ward, it's because there is such demand in the fan base for these Ewok films.  Say what?

These two ""films,"" effectively TV shows, aren't terrible, but they're pure 1980s drivel and are simply overrun with furry, reviled Ewoks that don't even have the benefit of turning into scaled horrors when dunked in water, unlike Mogwai.  I mean, I'm pretty sure there are neon headbands involved.  That's never a good sign.

Frankly I'm surprised Lucas hasn't chopped these things up into bits either to ""get them to where he wanted if he'd had the appropriate technology at the time"".  Here are some desperately needed changes that the boys down in the CGI Revisionism Department could pump out in a day:

1)  All the slain parents now appear as ghosts at the end of the films.  However, they are not the ages the parents were when they died, but are children for some reason.  This is accepted by all without question.

2)  The brother never shoots first.  In fact, he never shoots at all, and all blasters fatally backfire when triggered to demonstrate the perils of not sharing.

3)  Instead of spears, the Ewoks all wield harmless flashlights.

4)  Both films are narrated by beloved Lucas brainchild Jar Jar Binks.  In fact, he dubs all the character lines too.

5)  At the end of each film, Gungans are shown celebrating for some reason.

6)  A CGI Yoda bounds constantly around the landscape like Clay Aiken on speed, spouting hip phrases like ""tubular to the max, dude,"" and ""jam the pipe to the extremez!""

7)  As a consequence of the massively saccharine nature of the proceedings, a new ""PG-0"" rating is instituted, which means the films are suitable for playing against the stomachs of expectant mothers to better inculcate their children to a lifetime of mindless unquestioning grasping at the LucasFilm teat.

8)  Every human being who manages to do something is discovered to have billions of ""midichlorians"" and to be the result of an immaculate conception, presumably by God himself.

9)  Every tenth frame is a Hyperspace logo.

10)  The DVDs come with special, patented LFL ""CGI Cancer"", which spreads from scene to scene over the course of your ownership of the DVDs, gradually turning them into episodes of ""The Thundercats"".  Only a monthly payment of $9.95 to LucasFilm temporarily arrests this process.",1103068800,14,2587,4.8090909090909095
2143396,4,B0002YCUR0,"I am an avid hater of the prequel films for reasons I will not go into right here, but I must say that these Ewok films somehow capture the feel of the Star Wars universe more than the prequels.

I remember seeing commercials for the first movie as a child and looking forward to it. The first movie is about a semisensient giant called the Gorax, who kidnaps two children's parents, the family having crash-landed on the remote forest moon of Endor. The kids wind up in the care of the Ewoks. They are furry, stone-level beings native to Endor. The kids and a ""caravan of courage"" go in search of the Gorax' lair, in an effort to rescue the parents.

In the second movie, a band of alien marauders -- in search of a nonexistant ""power"" -- attack the Ewok village, killing every human family member, save for the little girl, Cindel. Cindel and Wicket, an Ewok child, escape and wander the forest until they find a hut where an old human named Noa lives. Noa teams up with Cindel and Wicket to fight the marauders and their evil ally, a witch named Charal.

These movies were quite entertaining as a child, and I am anxious to see if I will enjoy them now. As for the problem with Wicket learning Basic (the English spoken in Star Wars), how do we know that the humans were speaking Basic? Perhaps they were speaking another human language, but to us, the viewers, it had to be in English so we could understand.

Cindel is actually mentioned in one of the Expanded Universe books. Twelve years after Return of the Jedi, she is a reporter for a news service.

I was perturbed at the death of Mace in the opening scenes of the second movie, as it was cool to have a young boy shooting blasters and fighting. You could imagine yourself in the role if you were close to Mace's age.",1102723200,7,1778,4.375757575757576

If you do, you'll enjoy these classic 80s TV movies.  As a kid, simply having a new story set in the STAR WARS universe was a big deal, and I remember enjoying these films.  By today's standards they'll come off as pretty cheesy, with little of the great action sequences we've come to expect from the STAR WARS Trilogies.  These movies will be perfect for kids or adults in their 20s in need of a little nostalgia.  The production values were high at the time and result in two extremely kid-safe movies.  It's hard to argue with the price tag, and if you've been dying to see Wilford Brimley do more than hock Quaker Oats, this is the double feature event you've been waiting for.  Boys will like the first movie, girls will like the second, and many an adult will be irritated by both.  I can't wait to see them again myself, but don't go into these movies expecting a STAR WARS experience because you won't get it.

Really though to be able to get two movies on DVD for about half the price of a tank of gas to me sounds like an okay deal.
