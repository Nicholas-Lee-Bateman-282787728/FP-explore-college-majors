4570941,5,B0054TOTOK,"rusty cooley takes you back to shred school. great player
for that style of shredding(less melodic/scale oriented)
but this guy is super fast which to me is always cool!!!!",1380153600,,172,4.9655172413793105
4570942,5,B0054TOTOK,"I highly recommend Rusty Cooley's ""Arpeggio Madness.""

An ""arpeggio"" is the sounding of the notes of a chord individually, one after the other, ascending or descending, perhaps spanning more than one octave. This course will help program your fingers to rapidly play arpeggio patterns (patterns that hit on the notes of a chord); this skill will greatly improve your ability to play lead throughout the changing chords of a song.

This three-DVD set is cheap: you would need to spend many hundreds of dollars to receive this training from a guitar teacher. But then, how many guitarists who play at this level (like Rusty) are willing to teach this material? Not many. Rusty is really generous to offer this training to us mere mortals.

""Arpeggio Madness"" is for advanced guitar players; before you start this course, you should have previously learned all of the following.
- Instant note recognition of all notes on the fretboard
- Keys (notes in every key)
- Chord construction (notes in any chord)
- Guitar chords for any given key
- Major and minor scale patterns (played in any key).

In short, you need to have previously completed training equivalent to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rusty-Cooley-Fret-Board-Autopsy-Scales-Modes-Patterns-Level-1/dp/B001PMR2TO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rusty Cooley Fret Board Autopsy- Scales, Modes & Patterns Level 1,</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fretboard-Autopsy-Scales-Modes-Melodic-Patterns-Level-2-DVD/dp/B0033HUJP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fretboard Autopsy - Scales, Modes & Melodic Patterns - Level 2 - DVD</a>&nbsp;(or, perhaps,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fretboard-Theory-Book-and-4-DVD-Bundle-25-Off-Desi-Serna/dp/B0055OXZ44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fretboard Theory Book and 4 DVD Bundle 25% Off Desi Serna</a>).

This product comes with a great instruction booklet (of approximately 100 pages) in PDF format. There is a copy of the booklet on each one of the three discs. Just copy the PDF file to your computer, then print out the entire booklet or only the pages you are working on each day. I am really impressed with the instruction booklet.

Rusty Cooley is, of course, a great guitarist; but he is also an excellent instructor. He does a great job on these DVDs explaining the concepts. I felt that Rusty's ""Fretboard Autopsy"" course did not have adequate explanations and graphics. ""Arpeggio Madness"" certainly does not have any such problems: Rusty's explanations in this course are nearly perfect (clear, concise, and easy to understand). He communicates very well. I also appreciate how he has integrated his spoken explanations with references to the booklet. The booklet is loaded with good-sized graphics, as well as text explanations.

It will probably take most folks several years to master the skills taught in this course. I (sadly) will never achieve the level of skill required to master the material on the third DVD. Even so, it is great to have a guitar instructional program that is so challenging. Thanks to Rusty and the production team for making such a great DVD course.

In this instructional DVD, Rusty Cooley uses his Rusty Cooley signature, seven-string Dean guitar which he tunes down one-half step. While he uses his seven-string guitar, all of his instruction is limited to the standard six strings. However, students will need to drop tuning one half step to exactly follow Rusty's examples (i.e., change tuning to E-flat, B-flat, G-flat, D-flat, A-flat, E-flat). I feel that he should have used a six-string guitar in standard tuning for this course.

This product allows you to gain free access to the Rock House website, where you will find lots of free supplementary learning aids. For example, you can download the ""backing tracks"" (drum and bass rhythm tracks) for these lessons. I play these through my guitar amp via my iPod. Such backing tracks are more fun than a metronome.

4570943,5,B0054TOTOK,Rusty does a great job of teaching. Most shredders don't know how to articulate their modes of thinking when it comes to dissection of their licks. Rusty does a great job. Very useful info is divulged.,1364428800,,201,4.611111111111111
4570944,5,B0054TOTOK,I agree this DVD is amazing! It goes through the patterns across the guitar neck and help you see the entire neck as a whole instead of little blocks. Rusty's techniques are great and help you to play sweep picking easily. I highly recommend this DVD! And by the way the Tablature is on the DVDs you just download it and you can print it out as well.,1362528000,,350,4.161764705882353
4570945,5,B0054TOTOK,If your not familiar with rusty cooley's previous instructional dvds this one is not for you. This time around its fast paced (no pun intended).,1357862400,,144,4.8
4570946,5,B0054TOTOK,All I have to say is buy it because Rock House is the BEST and RUSTY is the scale and modes MASTER and a Great Teacher,1355097600,,118,3.576923076923077
4570947,5,B0054TOTOK,"So I have at least 50 instructional books, and some dvds about advanced stuff like arpeggios/scales/licks etc etc on and on.  Some are great, and some are duds. But this 3 DVD Set (which comes with a 104 page book in pdf file format) blew my mind.  Well, I say the first DVD is kinda for beginner to intermediate players for sweeping to get things started.  The second DVD gets a little better with some cool licks and string skipping sequences etc, but the 3rd DVD is just mind blowing to me.  Especially the 3 note per string triad licks (wide stretching with the left hand) which is like playing a chord scale as if it was a normal 3 note per string scale as arpeggios ascending all 6 strings!!! Wicked!! and some wicked licks! and shows you about every arpeggio shape possible (in a nutshell).  This will definitely give you some new ideas.  I say buy it for sure!",1327708800,9,868,4.39375

8457079,4,B0054TOTOK,"When it comes to guitar playing, Rusty Cooley is a great technician. However, speed for the sake of speed often results in a lack of musicality, originality, and emotion. I'm not saying that Rusty doesn't possess these traits, I'm just saying that you will have to find a musical way of reproducing these arpeggio studies to use in your own playing.

Although this DVD set shows you many ways of playing arpeggios, I was surprised that some of the fingerings I myself use to play arpeggios were not there - I guess the guitar really is limitless.

Rusty Cooley's Arpeggio Madness provides a systematic approach to arpeggiating many different chords types. I recommend it to intermediate and advanced guitarists.

One issue that I did encounter was that at the end of Disc 2 with 4 seconds to go it just stops, chops off the piece of music before he finishes it. Not a big deal I guess, just a glitch in the Matrix, lol.

To sum up, Rusty clearly explains all of the concepts on this 3 disc set.
It is a great set of instructional DVDs for those wanting to breathe new life into their playing.

8457080,3,B0054TOTOK,"Rusty Cooley is a good instructor and master technician.  This course is like a chord book, but for arpeggios.  It is layed out with chapters for each type of chord:  Maj7, Min7, Dom7, Dim, then extensions, then different ""inversions"" (played from 5th string, 6th string, 4 string forms, 2 string forms, etc.)  Of course, a book would not be able to communicate the dexterity and techniques required to actually play these, so video is perfect medium.  I believe that this dvd set will have covered 95% of physical forms of arpeggios played in rock and metal music, now and into the future.  It is an encyclopedic approach that explores the boundaries of what is physically possible.

The downside of this kitchen sink approach however, is that it is not particularly musically interesting.  The arpeggio forms are shown and the basic idea is that once you know how to build chords/arpeggios off each scale degree (diatonic), you can improvise by playing off any of the scale degrees.  This is basic modal theory and is about as far as most metal players get.  This is fare for the fingers, not the mind.

The other problem with this video is that RC has absolutely the worst tone of any professional player I have heard.  You may not think this is relevant, but the problem is that he sets his action so low that it serves as physical compression, limiting the attack and  reducing the sustain of the note.  He makes up for this by using EMG pickups and a seven string guitar.  Every shredder knows that you can go lower, but the lower you go, you sacrifice tone, musicality and expression.  With action this low there is a higher margin of error for these types of techniques making it easier to play, and it homogenizes tone (good or bad), legato, picked, and sweeped techniques all sound more similar.  Keep this in mind if you still desire to have any soul in your tone; it will be harder to make his technique work with a typical low (no uber low) action.  If you want to play like RC, you should probably have your guitar plekked, use high output active pickups, and use a guitar with more natural sustain, like a seven string.  RCs style is highly specialized and supported by very careful choice of guitar and setup.

Philosophically, I don't think typical players need to learn ALL these forms.  When sweep arpeggios are played, (and they are played fast), they have more textural value than melodic value.  From a practical standpoint there is very little musical difference between a min and min7th when sweeped and played with distortion, so I advocate watching the video and develop the forms that you gravitate to or that catch your ear.  If you don't know how to sweep a 13th, this will not limit your playing; probably better to develop other parts of your vocabulary.

If Rusty Cooley were an athlete, he would be a bodybuilder.  The guy who lives in the gym to perfect his physique/technique but who loses sight of the big picture: actual musical value (athletic performance).

Should you buy this?  If you are an advanced intermediate or advanced player, then absolutely!  I originally learned arpeggios from the Paul Hanson Starlicks video from nearly 20 years ago.  It is not quite as encyclopedic, but it has enough to become a competent sweep player.  Once you have the basics you will develop your own pet techniques. (The idea should always be originality.. if you spend your time trying to imitate you will never truly be a success in art.)  I think that RCs arpeggio madness could be quite imposing to an intermediate, where the subject doesn't need to be.  Once you can already sweep arpeggios, this vid will show you some new ideas.",1389830400,10,3662,4.7001569858712715
8457081,1,B0054TOTOK,"I think this guy is a joke. For starters, he teaches everything using a 7 string guitar, and to make things more difficult, he also uses alternate tuning on all the lessons. Here's a hint Rusty, 99% of us buying this DVD are using 6 string guitars, at standard tuning. Thanks for the arrogant arangement.",1386547200,8,304,4.545454545454546
