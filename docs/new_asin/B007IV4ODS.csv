5090103,3,B007IV4ODS,"The story is a little contrived. Part of the plot doesn't make sense. For instance, after the rape, how could Francois, the rapist simply just walks free as if nothing had happened? As Christian, the victim is not killed, why doesn't he go to the police straight away and put Francois behind a slammer? It also taxes our imagination a little to see Christian, a physically vibrant young man being subdued relatively easy by a passed the prime Francois, the older guy's hefty size not withstanding. But the saving grace of the film is the acting. It's sublime. Everyone on the cast does an excellent job.",1355616000,3,603,4.69811320754717

5090106,5,B007IV4ODS,"Excellent reviews have already been written, but I had to add my two cents about 'Beauty'. The dangers of repression are brilliantly examined in this searing drama, one of the most disturbing films I've seen in a while. Deon Lotz gives a fearless performance as Francois, a seemingly happily married, well-admired businessman with two daughters. However, not only is he in a loveless marriage and shows no affection toward his wife, he's a closeted gay man filled with self-hatred who is neither enlightened nor heroic during the course of the film. To top it off, he's a racist also. This will turn many viewers off, but actually it's a reflection of a number of hate-filled men. In fact, what made the movie so haunting is that I recognize Francois in a number of men I know casually and personally.

From the very beginning of the film, it is obvious that Francois is obsessed with Christian (played with a steady happy-go-lucky focus by Charlie Keegan) who is both the boyfriend of one of Francois's daughters and his best friend's son. This obsession sends Francois spiraling out of control and leads to an event that I did not see coming. I won't give anything else away, but I highly recommend this movie for fans of excellent, thought-provoking character studies that aren't wrapped with a bow.",1351900800,8,1302,4.838565022421525
5090107,4,B007IV4ODS,"This is a South African story about a middle aged, family man Francois (Deon Lotz). He has a wife and two daughters and a successful lumber firm, at one of his daughter's weddings he is reunited with an old friend and business acquaintance who has brought his 23 year old son along. This is Christian (Charlie Keegan -`The Sinking of the Laconia') and he has charm, wit and matinee idol good looks `to die for'.

The thin veneer of familial bliss is soon seen to be cracking with casual racism, homophobia, an unfaithful wife and children who lie. Also daddy isn't exactly what he seems to be as he goes to bear type all men swingers groups. Needles to say he is not gay, but he soon becomes smitten with Christian. But Christian lives in Cape Town and Francois is in Bloemfontein which is a fair old drive. Undeterred he invents an excuse to go to Cape Town where he will orchestrate a meeting to go to the next level. Well as Oscar Wilde famously said, `there is only one thing worse than unrequited love.....and that is when it is requited'.

Beauty or `Skoonheid' to give it its original title is an art house film in many ways. It is both cleverly and artistically shot, the acting is outstanding and the music is understated but works almost subliminally. The pace will be a bit slow for some, but that reflects the narrative which is hardly planned from the players perspective either.

There are some bedroom action bits but not in the least frequent but there are some scenes that will be upsetting to some, this is most definitely not a feel good movie. It was South Africa's best foreign language film entry to the 84th Academy awards, so by all accounts there is a lot to merit attention here. I found it slow, brooding and initially unsatisfying; however, on reflection this is a film that will stay with you. The only reason I felt a bit let down is it did not play out how I was expecting and that is in actual fact a very good thing, hence my rating. In Afrikaans and English with a run time of 105 minutes not your run of the mill film and more power to director Oliver Hermanus for that.",1349913600,7,2105,4.420103092783505
5090108,5,B007IV4ODS,"In the stylistic tradition of Michael Haneke, this top notch, thought-provoking drama/thriller looks at a fortysomething repressed homosexual (with an unloved wife and a grown daughter) whose carefully controlled double life begins to unravel when he develops an obsession about an old friend's grown son. While people from South Africa (the film's origin and setting) will appreciate the film more than others--as, it seems, a reflection on a generation of white bigots whose worldview leaves them trapped in the past--anyone with a taste for tense psychological drama (and a stomach for a couple of shocking scenes) can appreciate this distinguished work. There are some (likely unintended) confusing bits, as well as some (likely intended) ambiguities and unresolved elements, but nothing so problematic that I can't recommend this as one of the most haunting films I've seen in the last two or three years.",1346976000,18,910,5.370629370629371
5090109,5,B007IV4ODS,"Oliver Hermanus wonderfully crafted ""Beauty"" was South Africa's submission to the Academy Awards as well as 2011 Un Certain Regard Cannes Film Festival Nominee and a Cannes award winner. This is a tale of repressed turmoil that slowly creep ups to the viewer. A very capable Deon Lotz plays Franois in an excellent performance filled with subtle anger, rage, jealousy and obsession. These feeling progressively take their toll on the unsuspecting Christian, brilliantly portrayed by Charlie Keegan with a devastating innocence and magnetic charm that will keep audiences disturbed long after experiencing this film.

Family man Francois van Heerden is a haven of many secrets. Secrets that deteriorate as well as rot the insides. In his endurance of life's test and family matters, Franois is able to keep an expected straight face in his daily dealings as he slowly asphyxiates for attention from his daughter's mate Christian. Christian, on the other hand, not only regards Francois as an elderly figure worthy of respect due to friendship ties with his father but refers to him as ""uncle"", an adoptive role soon to be tested by an ever raging need to relate in highly improbable ways unbeknown to an oblivious Christian . However, we get the sense that Christian honestly looked up to Francois as an additional father figure source.

The platonic dealings slowly eats away at Francois as he repeatedly insists Christian refer to him by his name in order to detract from the connecting familiar upbringing which seems to awkwardly remind Francois to hold back on his planned intentions. Effective scheming leads to the an extremely troubling conclusion based on a number of deliberate choices and sequential actions meant to pander to the vile objectives to be executed.

Upon the enforcement of his plans, Franois realizes the results are now irreversible. The damage is done and permanent. The post mutilating events leads to reparations that will ultimately render Francois unrepentant and numb to an uneven arrangement. The brilliance of this story falls within the mix bag of emotions this film emits. The film is beautifully haunting as it unfolds, yet extremely ugly. ""Beauty"" is a cinematic gem worthy of attention because it will illicit a variety of strong and deep long lasting reactions. It will encourage dialogue with other viewers immediately after watching regarding its many unanswered questions of what could have been.",1343260800,21,2439,5.201017811704834

A wonderful, no-holds-barred, riveting performance by lead actor Deon Lotz and fine supporting work by Charlie Keegan, especially in the shattering climax.

5090115,1,B007IV4ODS,"I see a lot of reviewers liked this film. For me, the first hour and twenty minutes were painfully boring, some of the slowest moving scenes I've witnessed in film. Then there are ten minutes of revolting brutality. At the end there is one meaningful minute, but it's hardly worth enduring the rest of the film just for that. Finally, what little plot line the film possesses remains unresolved. I was going to recommend skipping this one, but since it has so many positive reviews, I suppose I'll just say if you find the first half hour boring like I did, probably you will want to stop watching. It doesn't get any better. I thought another negative review was needed (although I see they're all getting a bunch of not helpful votes) because I did find this film extremely tedious.",1381795200,3,784,4.607142857142857

5090117,2,B007IV4ODS,"It so would figure that I start with watching a few Gay genre foreign films and end up seeing something like this. It started out a bit promising with a married forty something who is hiding his inner feelings and sexual desires for men. OK. Got it. Than he starts this creepy stalking towards Christian who refers to him as uncle. Following him, lying to wife in order to see him, and starring at him constantly. Here I am thinking that just maybe there would be some kind of mutual affection that it turns so disgusting. The rape scene is so graphic and horrific. What is left to your own conclusion is wither or not he survived this for a few of the scenes seemed as if he was dead but after it was done he was breathing and moving. How can this guy get away this and go back to his wife and his life as if nothing happened. The movie made me actually sick to my stomach.",1373587200,3,874,4.177514792899408
5090118,3,B007IV4ODS,"Francois is a closeted gay man -- not repressed since he engages in regular orgies with other closeted men. He is middle-aged and middle-class with a successful lumber business. He is in a loveless and seemingly sexless marriage with his wife Elena. At his eldest daughter's wedding he spies the young and beautiful Christian ( the now grown son of an old friend) across the room...hence begins his lustful obsession.

For the first ten to fifteen or so minutes I misjudge Francois as a sad closet case...however with his effortless lies and total lack of human empathy, I soon realised this character was a deviant sociopath and feared for the object of his lust. In the diner scene, close to the movie's devastatingly violent climax, Francois -- in coded language -- offers to show Christian how to live the double life he is living. He has zero feelings for this young man just an animalistic need for sexual domination over him. He is an unfeeling monster.

I had no sympathy for this protagonist nor could I find any justification for his situation...other than this is the life he wishes to lead or he would change it. He is living in a country where gay marriages are legal. He is financially secure. In an age of the Internet where gay men -- of all ages -- can easily find each other and begin relationships...he opts for emotionless sex, orgy style. His wife on the other hand, seems to have found a steady love interest. A fact that gets zero reaction from Francois.

I think this movie is suppose to convey the tragedy of the closeted gay life...but for me it displayed the portrait of a sociopath who just happens to be gay. I gave the movie 3 stars for the acting.

After the rape, I was disgusted and only kept watching in hopes of discovering more about Christian's condition...However the director tells us nothing...spending the last few minutes focusing the camera on the self-obsessed face of pure evil.",1373155200,2,1923,4.6973293768546

Just unbelievable violence and horror. Yuck, yuck, yuck! I rate this zero out of five. If I could rate it lower, I would.",1370044800,,655,4.559322033898305
5090121,5,B007IV4ODS,"Superb movie. Dark subject matter presented brilliantly. The pace is perhaps a bit slow for the Twitter crowd but if one likes to really delve into film characters this is an excellent example of that technique. It helps if one understands the cultural backdrop -- At this point in time South Africa is one generation removed from Apartheid and the adults in this film (including the main character, Francois) are still trapped in the racist & homophobic & otherwise complacent mindset of a now bygone era. The lead actor (Deon Lotz) gives an outstanding performance. So good, in fact, he comes across as a sympathetic character even though his behavior is unethical -- and in one instance even criminal. The viewer understands this man and why he behaves the way he does. Again, excellent film  -- 5 stars.",1366675200,2,807,4.8478260869565215
5090122,2,B007IV4ODS,"This is a movie about male to male rape. I wish I had been forewarned about this fact, for I personally cannot handle watching one human rape another. Armed with the knowledge that rape is an act of power abuse and not sex, the down low homosexuality, with its bitter trademark of extroverted homophobia, confuses this issue. Male to male rape is an universal subject. Is the South African setting meant to underline or normalize the abusiveness of perpetrator versus victim? Was the filmmaker blaming the victim by naming the film 'beauty'? Showing repressed homosexuals scrambling with their heterosexual prisons is one thing. Introducing the subject of rape throws the film into an arena that was handled way too ambiguously for being such a powerful one.",1365206400,,758,5.023809523809524

5090125,4,B007IV4ODS,"Beauty is a generally well-made movie about the ugly consequences of sexual repression in an intensely, violently homophobic society in South Africa (although it could just as well have been set in the United States or most other countries). The movie's few serious flaws&mdash;Deon Lotz is not believable as a gay man, even as a severely closeted and homophobic gay man; and Charlie Keegan is nowhere near the beauty the movie makes him out to be&mdash;in a way aren't really flaws at all, because those incongruities reinforce the fundamental impossibility of anything approaching health and sanity in such a perverted society. The true perverts are the homophobes, and this movie exposes them and portrays the hypocrisy, depravity and violence of their lives with great power and clarity.

The characters are bilingual; the movie's dialog is about 30% English and 70% Afrikaans, often switching back and forth several times within a single sentence. That would be okay if either both languages were subtitled (the best solution) or if the English were not spoken with a pronounced South African accent&mdash;but instead they chose to subtitle ONLY the words in Afrikaans.

Often I found myself wondering why the subtitles suddenly stopped in the middle of a sentence only to realize too late that they were speaking English now and I was supposed to know what they were saying. That's a big mistake. It would have cost them practically nothing to subtitle the English too, but they didn't. It became less of problem later in the movie just because I got used to it, but it never ceased to be a distraction. That's the main reason I deducted one star.",1362182400,2,1653,4.9855072463768115

8518012,1,B007IV4ODS,"I can barely find words to describe my disdain for this movie. First the components of the movie don't work well.  The main character is angry at his daughter but why isn't clear.  There is a car theft incident that does not come together or make any sense and the rape scene -- as at least one other person has also commented -- is ridiculously improbable. A middle aged man overpowers a fit guy in his twenties as if the victim were a 10 year old.  Perhaps you could say the movie seeks to highlight the reality and brutality of gay rape, but that theme is never developed.  It just happens, is not dealt with and later there's a big pile of money for some never identified purpose.

The movie was a complete waste of time.  The social commentary regarding closeted married men along with the higher ratings is what attracted me to see this movie for myself.  This is fiction -- a disconnected made up story -- but from the comments some label it  as a common reflection of reality. Perhaps it is in some cases, but I hope this movie doesn't encourage more people to automatically categorize men in mix orientation marriages as psychopaths or rapist. There are crazy people in the world. Just being closeted does not make a person one of them. Since the movie is not in 100% English part of the discontinuity could be the result of a limited translation.  That I can not know.
