I keep waiting for it to come out on DVD in REGION 1 so that I can buy a copy of it.  I wonder if anyone knows if the film will ever be made into a DVD for US and Canadian viewers.  Please let us know.",1464220800,,368,3.88

7872085,4,6304457936,I thought from the page I ordered from that this was a region 1 Canadian release but it turned out to be a PAL region 4 British DVD. Luckily it played just fine on my PC using VLC and with proper tools it can be converted to an NTSC friendly format. Last saw this on a rental VHS from Hastings twenty years ago which is why I wanted it on DVD. Glad to have it on disc in spite of format.,1383004800,,387,3.7901234567901234

I also enjoyed the interview at the end, with the author herself.",1363219200,,173,4.612903225806452
7872087,5,6304457936,"This is an absolutely wonderful film on many levels.

First, the protagonist hero is a young woman, who has been brought up in an extremely strict Christian sect.  They expect her to become a missionary and she tries to stay true to her faith.  But when she no longer can, by no choice of her own, they attempt to suppress her very nature.  It is sad, brutal, and hypocritical, to say the least.  (This interests me personally, as I have a history of fundamentalism in my own family - rejecting it is the central fact of my father's life.)

Second, she realizes that she is gay, and simply accepts it in spite of the determined opposition of her family and entire milieu.  The abuse she submits to is enormous and cruel.  Her struggle gave me great empathy for the search for love in whatever form.

Third, you see her grow out of her upbringing.  She is an exceptional person with great talent, as a student but also as a worker.  Her determination is a beautiful and universal condition, very movingly portrayed.  You ache with hope for her and feel her joy.  The acting is astonishing.

Fourth, the portrayal of a particular British milieu and mentality is vivid and often hilarious.  The film perfectly catches the sullenness at the heart of British insularity, but also the small kindnesses that people offer eachother beyond their natural rigidity.  As I know the country very well because my wife is a Brit, I loved this portrait.

Warmly recommended.",1245110400,,1458,4.677165354330708

7872089,5,6304457936,"This is certainly an overlooked film if there ever was one. It can be very funny and moving, but yes, I can see that it might offend some sensibilities. Well, lot's of things offend my sensibilities -- and I simply don't buy them . . . I have no doubt that a DVD version would easily pay for the costs of making it. . . Incidentally, I just got my copy of Time Out 2003 (11th ed.) today and while browsing in the obits noticed that the young co-star, Charlotte Coleman (3 Apr 68 - 14 Nov 01) passed away a year ago. Google said it was a bad case of asthma. What a pity! She is much better known for her role in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1993). Time Out doesn't even mention Oranges, which seems to have originated as a TV movie (a long one). Does anyone know any of the reviewers over there?

July 11, 2006 P.S to my original review of November 4, 2002:

Great! the dvd is finally here.  But be careful about the coding. The description lists the format as PAL, which can be a problem for those of us whose TVs generally expect NTSC. But PAL will probably play on your computer.  Maybe.",1036368000,11,1089,4.1469194312796205
7872090,4,6304457936,"Oranges is a powerful film, showing the opression of Jess, a young girl uncertain of her own identity.  Dealing with sexuality and religious extremists I found at times I was unsettled by the portrayal of the violence aimed at the young girl.  Never the less Oranges is a brilliant film and must be watched in its entiretry to be fully appreciated.",975542400,7,348,4.688524590163935
7872091,5,6304457936,"I first saw this movie years ago in the early 90s when I happened to be up late one night channel-surfing. PBS aired the film from 12-3am, undoubtedly due to its homosexual content. Little did I know I was about to view one of  the best gay-themed films I have seen to date. Although I am neither a  lesbian (although I am gay), nor a product of a fundamentalist Pentecostal  upbringing (I was brought up Catholic, ""they're the worst""  according to Jess' mother!), I strongly believe that any viewer, male or  female, gay or straight, religious or secular, can identify with the plight  of Jess, the obstinately stubborn and yet valiantly lovable protagonist who  finds the self-determination to be true to herself and her God in the midst  of the worst sort of persecution and ostracization one can endure- that  which comes from those closest to you, your family and community.
Jess,  the protagonist, is everyone's hero. She is in fact an ur-hero. She speaks  not only to lesbians and gay men who have faced rejection, but to ALL  people who have had to find the courage to be who they are and do what they  want to do despite the immediate people and circumstances that prevent,  forbid, oppress or threaten them from doing so.
The cast displays stellar  performances: Geraldine McEwan is unmatched in her portrayal of the zealous  Bible-thunping mother. She stabs naked fear and loathing into your heart  from the very first scene in which she towers over the 5-year-old Jess and  grills her with biblical questions, followed by a smack on the head. Yet  somehow you come to respect and admire the fervent tenacity to which she  clings to her system of beliefs. Melanie, Jess' first love, is the type of  girl you would expect to find in a fairy tale: dripping with innocence and  sweet as honey, the perfect poison apple to set up a broken heart. The  preacher who leads this flock to which Jess and her mom belong is  incredible as a despicable British version of Jimmy Swaggart.
The most  striking aspect of the film for me is how the director has woven such  teasing, subtle and yet insanely hilarious (British!) humor into a movie  that has scenes so painful that it hurts to watch them. Every time I see  this movie, I get a little more humor out of it than the previous time, and  it makes me love the film all the more, even though it's intent as a whole  is certainly not to amuse- that is purely incidental. Yet on second  thought, maybe it isn't. Maybe the humor makes us appreciate the somber  theme of the movie all the more each time we see it. And we admire Jess all  the more, and the ending all the more because of it. It just gets better  and better!",950486400,64,2673,4.534591194968553
