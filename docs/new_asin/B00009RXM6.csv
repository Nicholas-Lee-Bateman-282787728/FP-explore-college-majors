7992972,5,B00009RXM6,"This is a very long saga, but the battles, characters, and storyline make it yet another epic saga in the DragonBall Z franchise.  I recomend this saga for everyone who is looking quality entertainment in the anime world, or even regular television.  This saga takes on a darker tone than the others in the Majin Buu storyline.  It goes from the more gentle looking fat Buu to the scary, muscular Buu.  This saga is filled with death throughout and bizzarre concepts, such as fusion and being inside Buu himself.

  The saga begins with the species known as humans rearing its' ugly head with the shooting of Buu's dog, named Bee, and Hercule.  Fat Buu quickly goes from experiencing feelings of true happiness to feeling utter rage.  Buu expels all of his inner rage and evil from his body, forming another Buu of evil.  This new evil Buu quickly over takes fat Buu by refelcting its' attack and turning him into chocolate.  Once evil Buu eats the fat Buu a terrible transformation occurs, creating a scary, stronger Buu.

  This Buu immediately senses that the remaining Z Fighters are on Kami's lookout and goes straight for them.  Not expecting this Piccolo must get Trunks and Goten into the Hyperbolic Time Chamber to get more training before fusing and taking on the new Buu.  Buu's patience runs out quickly after eliminating human life on Earth, except Hercule, Tien, and Chiautzu.  The showdown between Gotenks and Buu in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber does not go as Piccolo hoped, thus forcing him to make the decision to destroy the chamber's door and locking them in forever.

  However, in Buu's rage he rips a hole in the dimension with his energy and escapes back into Earth's dimension.  Gotenks and Piccolo soon are able to do the same and follow only to discover that Buu has eaten everyone on the lookout, except Dende who was tossed from the sanctuary to Earth.  Gohan makes his reappearance in the knick of time, just as Gotenks' fusion has worn off.  With Gohan's newfound power, Buu is helpless and is forced to unleash a devious technique giving him immense power through the absorption of others.  Goku comes by the gift of new life and returns to Earth to merge with Gohan, but Buu is one step ahead of Goku and absorbs Gohan.

  With all but gone, a new entity reappears on Earth giving Goku one last hope to merge together and defeat the new super Buu.  I reccommend getting this saga now and watching all the gripping episodes that you won't want to stop watching until Earth is saved, or will it be??.......",1375401600,,2536,4.676470588235294
7992973,5,B00009RXM6,"The Fusion Box set ( Dragon Ball Z The 13 Season) Has the best epsoides of the series yet! With epsoides 239-260 we get to see Gotenks go SS3, Evil Buu and Super Buu, Ultimate Gohan after he is done with his traing, Goku and Vegeta beacome alive agian, and Vegitio V.S. Super Buu! The box set is vary expnssive but is defintitly worth it the best DVD in the set is probley Losing battle beacuse Gotenks goes SS3! The Secound is The Last Sayin beacuse we get to see Vegitio! And the 3rd Evil Buu beacuse we get to see Buus evil form. Defintiily a gift for Fans of DBZ also I reccomend The Majian Buu Box Set And The Kid Buu Box Set!",1150070400,2,631,4.056
7992974,5,B00009RXM6,"Yeah I gotta completly disagree with the first review listed here...are you sure you watched them?!

The most mature out of the series to say the least (watch it with subtitles, there's swearing then), most powerful characters so far in the series, and the most action. All in all once Gogeta appears it really gets good. I thought the inwards of buu got a little boring but very good saga overall.",1142208000,2,398,4.605633802816901
7992975,4,B00009RXM6,"Let me say this the Majin Buu sagas of DBZ turn out to be a big disapointment. The Japanese just ruined the series by not making it more mature as the earler series. The action is lame too much comedy. The animation gone cartoony like a little American kids show. Talk about talent goin to waste cause Dragon Ball Z had potental to go down in history as the most action cartoon ever made, it would of made Super Man look like an amature. It's sad to say this is how DBZ will be remembered. Even if you watch the fusion saga uncut it will be just a bit better but still nothing compaired to a real japanese mature anime.

I think when fusion between Goten and Trunks and turn Gotenks was plan stupid cause they have to do a stupid dance. Super Saiyan 3 looks stupid cause of the long hair BIG DEAL. I thought is was stupid when Vegetto was turn into a candy but still able to fight and talk. But this is what takes the dumbest is when Goku and Vegeta got seperated again and went inside Majin Buu all together.",1126656000,3,1009,4.174358974358975
7992976,5,B00009RXM6,"This saga is great. We get to see Vegeto and gotenks fight for the first time. This saga starts off with Buu splitting into the people, they fight and the evil buu wins. The evil buu absorbs the good buu and he transforms. After that happens buu tracks down gotenks energy and goes to the watch tower. He wants to fight them or else all of the world will be destroyed. Piccolo decideds to have him fight gotenks in the hyperbolic time chamber so that if they lose piccolo can destroy the door and buu will be trapped and the world will be saved. They fight and Buu escapes. Now its up to gohan (who was unlocking his hidden power in the kai world) to save the day. gohan fights bravely but is absorbed. Gotenks is also absorbed. Goku who was also at the kai world is given the fusion earings and with luck he finds vegeta (who made a deal with King Yama). Goku finally talks vegeta into using the earings and they fuse into Vegeto. Vegeto kicks buus butt and buu is furious. After they fight for awhile buu absorbs Vegeto. This is a great saga. The fight scenes with gotenks and buu, and Vegeto and buu are great. This is a definate must have for all DBZ fans.",1084665600,6,1160,4.253393665158371
7992977,4,B00009RXM6,"Ive watched a lot of Dragon Ball Z in my day, and the Buu saga is definetly the high point of the series. Fused in between the Babidi and Kid Buu saga's, Fusion is excellent in many categories. Seeing Gotenks greatest ability (The one that lets him equalize with Buu's power) is a real thrill, and watching Buu's constant transformations is fun as well.
Even so, the Fusion saga has its errors (hence the four stars); I found the parts with Mr. Satan flat-out boring. There were also some stupid moments, such as a scene where Vegetto transforms into a candy. Youll see what I mean.
Overall, the Fusion saga is definetly better than all the previous saga's, in terms of intensity and animation; Akira Toriyama's art style has also greatly improved since the Cell Games. The character's are more vibrant and well defined, and the animation was top notch for its time (Although its pale in comparison to todays anime). All in all, Fusion is merely preperation for the final and also best saga in all of DBZ: The Kid Buu saga.",1073001600,11,1023,4.595628415300546
7992978,5,B00009RXM6,"DBZ at its best, this box set includes some of the most action packed episodes of the entire Buu saga, and it is a must have, lots of story turns, action and all out energy...go buy it...now.",1064620800,5,191,4.1891891891891895
