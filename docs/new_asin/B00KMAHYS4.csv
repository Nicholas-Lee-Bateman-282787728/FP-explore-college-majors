8659980,5,B00KMAHYS4,"This film is so expertly acted - based on a true story - and for the older viewer brings back a lot of memories of Ali and what our
Supreme Court was thinking during the US citizens' reaction.  I love the more personal relationships portrayed in this film, as well
as those of the professional ones of the Supreme Court.  Highly recommended.",1413072000,,341,4.483870967741935
