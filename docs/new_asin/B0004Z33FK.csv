2156549,5,B0004Z33FK,"absolutely brilliant! i first saw a lot of this material on a bootleg VHS tape back in '98, and haven't viewed anything from Bill since. This dvd marks the first release of a lot of this material in the US, and it is certainly worth every penny, and has been worth the six-year wait.

""One Night Stand"", ""Relentless"", and ""Revelations"" all shine with a luminosity that was clearly missing from the old tapes. the material is as brilliant as ever from a prophet who left us all too soon.

it's just a ride that i'm glad to be taking from an excellently poigant and raunchy comedian and preacher.",1098835200,5,594,4.4907407407407405

That's right--with no Bill Hicks, they'd be doing airplane and 7-11 jokes like all the rest--David Letterman, shame on you for letting this brave and talented man down and shame on you, dear reader, if you don't spend the paltry sum required to see a true comedic genius in action--don't let him slip away in the pages of the cult performer like Bruce--highly recommended!",1096934400,49,2882,4.512428298279159

2156565,4,B0004Z33FK,"I only hesitate to give this 5 stars because of the material over lap on the DVD's. Hicks was a great social commentator who could draw laughter out of a crowd, but almost as importantly, he made people think. The problem that Hicks has with new audiences and even American audiences during his ""hey day"" was that he was talking about subjects that just didn't get  brought into the mainstream. You didn't make jokes about American exceptionalism, the media, abortion, religion, suicide, and the Gulf War at that time. It was not good for one's career. On those issues, we were simply supposed to think the way we were told. That's probably why Hicks didn't take off with American audiences until now. England got him. They understood him more than just ""joke"" comic. He took his audience on a journey into his mind and with that helped them to explore the way they saw the world. English audiences allowed him to take on subjects that the American media didn't think the American people could handle.
If you are not prone to want to think about what a comic was saying within the context of their time, then skip this. It's not for people who think Larry The Cable Guy is a hoot. The subject matter and the time in which Hicks was bringing that to the public is simply better than that. Not that there is anything wrong with laughing at Sinbad, Cable Guy, or any of those guys, but you just have to check your brain at the door. When watching this, put yourself in the mindset that it's 1990 or so. Or, watch 2 or 3 other comics doing sets at this time and then watch Hicks. He was ahead of his time and it's a shame it's taken 20 years for people to catch on, because now there is nothing new from Hicks to draw from.
If you love stand up and its history, or are a big fan of Hicks, you should buy this DVD. It's a reminder that we don't have to accept dumb downed, mediocrity from those who want us to stay in line, thinking the same way, acting the same way and perceiving life in the same way. Hicks saw things through his own mind and encouraged others to do the same.",1338249600,,2074,4.331619537275064

2156571,5,B0004Z33FK,"Lenny Bruce paved the way so that George Carlin, Bill Hicks, Bill Maher, Lewis Black, etc. could talk the way they talk on stage, using ""the seven words you can never say on television"", that are, incidentally, the same ""seven words you can never use in an amazon review"".

But Bill Hicks is the comedian using those very words in the most intelligent way, breaking up many other social taboos at the same time.  What is even more remarkable is that he did so at a very young age.  He was the first to openly talk on masturbation on stage.  He was the first - and I think still the only one - to say ""I love pornography"" on stage.  His stand on drugs is also brilliant : ""It is not a very popular truth.  You don't hear it very often... I don't do drugs... anymore...  Done drugs before.  Had a good time on drugs and have absolutely nothing whatsoever against them.""  And gays in the military : ""Anyone... dumb enough... to be in the military... should be allowed in.""

He is also unequaled in his interacting with the audience.  ""I can talk for every man in the room... tonight... and I will...""  Or when he laughs with the round of applause he got from the smokers and ""the energy they put out at will"", then lights up a cigarette, and begins picking on the non-smokers.

But what makes him really great was his political understanding of how the country really works.  He said that in the US, ""there is only one party, the BUSINESS PARTY"".  Hicks has this great bit on what happens when a new president is elected.  After the ceremony, the new president is taken to a small room, where 12 of the top CEO's are awaiting, and is shown, from an angle nobody has ever seen before, footage of the Kennedy assassination...  ""Any questions, Mr. President ?""

Therefore, I think, should he still be alive, he would be joking on 9/11.  9/11 makes great stand-up material.  Think of it.  The collapse of the twin towers occurred in 10 seconds, following the path of the GREATEST RESISTANCE.  Ten seconds, that is free-fall speed.  That is physically impossible, unless... we use explosives...  Al Qaeda couldn't do it.  They tried it in 1993.  It didn't work out too good for them.  The building didn't move a millimeter.  So WE DID IT.  Because ""WE ARE THE EVIL EMPIRE"".  (This is an exact quote.)

And you also have the hole in the Pentagon too small for a Boeing to fit in.  The Arab pilots performing complicated maneuvers with Boeings in a perfect way, although... they couldn't even fly a Cessna...  Worse : they were not even aboard, as we soon would find out, with 6 of them still working and living happily in Saudi Arabia and Morocco.

Also GMO's make great stand up.  When testing the ""eternal life"" tomato, rats needed to be force-fed.  They knew why.  Seven of forty animals died within two weeks.  Consequently... the tomato was... approved....  by the FDA...  for human consumption...  Huh ?  But some firms are aware of the dangers.  Ben & Jerry's literally ""oppose recombinant BGH"".  That is what the package of their ice-cream says.  This made Monsanto blame them to be using ""marketing tricks"" to sell more ice-cream.  Ben Cohen's - co founder of Ben & Jerry's -reaction was : ""Of course, it is in our self-interest.  We want to keep our customers alive !  They eat more ice-cream when they are alive !""  This reaction of Ben Cohen is exactly what Hicks said in his bit on Judas Priest, after two of their fans died.

Following his mum, Bill was a preacher.  He went along with that.  He said he was ""spreading the truth"".

Bertold Brecht once said that dark ages are characterized by the fact that the truth has to be argued.  We live in such ages.  People believe all the lies governments and big business are spreading through the mass media.  Will the next Bill Hicks please stand up ?  We need him very hard.",1261180800,3,3826,4.5036496350364965
2156572,4,B0004Z33FK,"Bill Hicks was one of the most prolific comedians, philosophers and thinkers of my generation.

2156573,3,B0004Z33FK,"I'm a big Bill Hicks fan who thinks the man was a genius. That said I tend to like his political satire and philosophical rantings over his more bawdy sexual humor. Both are in abundance in this DVD collection of 3 performances and a biographical documentary.

The first two performances are fantastic, as expected, but I was left disappointed with the last (and longest), set in London. With the exception of a few poetic moments, the performance was mediocre and he has audio of some of the same jokes performed much better. In addition, the documentary (to which I was really looking forward) was a HUGE disappointment - it was lacking in content and looked like it had been edited by a freshman film major.

The DVD is still worth owning if you're a big fan but if you haven't been introduced to his material, I would start with one of his superior CD albums such as Rant in E Minor.",1245801600,2,887,4.503105590062112
2156574,5,B0004Z33FK,"I can't resist recording here that I was twice Bill Hick's high school teacher: For freshman algebra and for senior English.  I was proud that I was one of the teachers he gave no trouble, mostly because I left him alone regarding trivia so long as he tested out OK.  He was above average in both subjects.  A few days before graduation, I took him aside and told him that I had become a pretty jaded audience but that I could tell that he was really special.  He didn't seem especially impressed.  I never flattered myself that I was an influence in his life, but I did know quality when I saw it.  He was not a class clown, actually seemed rather sad and withdrawn much of the time, but he was no outcast; he had the respect of the ""in group,"" I think.  The only gag I remember:  ""I wanted to be an orthodontist, but my parents insist that I become a comedian.""",1235088000,8,863,4.219512195121951
2156575,3,B0004Z33FK,"First off, I am a newcomer to Bill Hicks, having just discovered him earlier this year. That being said, my familiarity with his work prior to purchasing this DVD was relatively small, limited only to seeing ""Relentless"" and hearing his ""Arizona Bay"" CD. Therefore, I am unable to give any real commentary on how well this might encapsulate the larger body of his work and any other considerations like that.

This DVD is good simply for the fact that it is a DVD copy of some of Hicks' material. The gem on here, to me, is definitely ""Relentless,"" with the other two performances being enjoyable but lacking the emotion of that particular show.

The documentary was really pretty disappointing. This is primarily due to the fact that a good portion of the allotted time for the documentary is filled by clips from the performances that are actually included on the DVD. Basically, an interviewee makes a statement about Bill, and then the film cuts to a particular performance clip of Bill's that exemplifies that point. The problem, though, is that most times the clip lasts longer than the amount of time the interviewee actually speaks, and usually they are clips you've already seen on the DVD. It's not a total waste, though, as there are some interesting segments with some of Bill's childhood friends as well as his parents. One final complaint, though, lies in the documentary's treatment of the ""Letterman incident."" What incident? Well, I wish I could tell you, but the final minutes of the documentary talk about it and how upset Bill was by it, but as for what actually happened...all we get is some vague description that he said something that was potentially offensive to political sensitivities while performing on Letterman, and his act got pulled from the showing. More seasoned fans of Hicks' probably know what this is all about, but if you're a relative newcomer such as myself, you're left extremely frustrated at not being told what exactly happened.

In addition, there seem to be some production or mixing issues with both ""Relentless"" and ""Revelations."" The former does actually have a disclaimer before it in regards to one segment that is of a lower quality than the rest, but my complaint here is not the quality of the footage but the fact that not only is the editing pretty choppy and, for the lack of a better word, obvious at times, but there are also points in both of these shows where the performance seems to skip. Basically, the show randomly cuts to a series of jokes that have already been shown before. Perhaps this is simply a problem with my copy and not all versions of the disc, but, as relatively minor of an annoyance it might be, it is still pretty annoying and, well, cheap.

Also, as some reviewers have mentioned, the material on here is somewhat repetitive. I hope this is more so a consequence of poor choice of what shows to include rather than a reflection of his typical work, but either way, some of the same jokes get rehashed between the different performances here. Each set is different, no question, but you will definitely find yourself many times saying, ""Wait? Haven't I heard this one...?""

All that being said, it's still not a bad disc. If you're especially itching for some of Hicks' work on any kind of viewable medium, then I would say it's worth the money. If you don't absolutely have to have something you can pop into a DVD player, though, you might be just as well off downloading copies of the performances off the internet - the ones I've seen really aren't that much worse in quality than the ones here.",1230768000,2,3584,4.718849840255591

I ached to be able to get hold of the piece on video and searched in vain for years looking for it. The comic was Bill Hicks and now,as then, his take on America and its place in the world has never been more relevant.

The targets include the religious right, Republicans, and, by his standards, various and sundry other moral hypocrites.  The style is aggression bordering on passion.  Hicks has his loyal fans - Goat Children - but I was like an agnostic at a revival meeting.  Rather than salvation through laughter I found Hicks more thought provoking that rib tickling.  At least the first time through.

 The big problem is that there's a lot of repeat material in all three concerts.  Hicks, who died in 1994, recorded all three in the early nineties, and I guess some repetition can be expected and forgiven.  It gets a little leaden when you watch them back to back to back, though.

 The second problem concerns the documentary.  Unforgivably they tell you when Hicks died but not the cause of death (pancreatic cancer.)  As you've probably read in the product description the documentary includes Brett Butler, Jay Leno, and David Letterman, among others.  The second sin committed by the documentary is allowing David Letterman to express his personal regret about the Hicks's last appearance on his late night show, which was censored, without explaining why or what material was cut. If a `net search is correct it had to do with something Hicks said that offended pro-lifers. In all, a pleasantly amusing three hours, lots of repeats, and not enough to send me shopping for Bill Hicks concert cds anytime soon.",1155081600,9,1680,4.971326164874552
2156591,5,B0004Z33FK,"Bill Hicks is without a doubt THE best comedian EVER!!  I personally believe that he was an angel sent from heaven, to tear the wool from our poor eyes.  He is like a prophet/preacher/poet/comedian.  I cried the first time I heard Bill and he touched my soul.  I see our society in a new way now. He opened my eyes and my mind to the TRUTH.  He opened my ""THIRD EYE"" I guess you could say.

In this DVD we can finally SEE him as he is telling his jokes.  He gives amazing deliveries here.  Fans of Carrot-Top and Larry the Cable Guy will ""look like someone whos just been shown a card trick"" after viewing this.  In order to enjoy Hicks, you must have some INTELLIGENCE.  Thats the thing with Bill, not only is he hilarious, but he also makes you THINK!!  Alot of people think that the material is dated, but think about it HE IS TALKING ABOUT PRES.BUSH SR.,THE WAR IN IRAQ,AND ALOT OF ISSUES THAT ARE STILL GOING ON TODAY!!  This is absolutely TIMELESS!!

Its such a shame that Bill had to leave us so soon, and I am very grateful for the short time he had here.  I own all of his books,cds,and dvds and I listen to him at least twice a week.

This is a great DVD for fans old and new.  It has three of his live performences. And they are all great.  Revelations is especially good!!  The documentary could be better.  I would have liked to see interviews with Maynard Keenan and Zach de la Roach instead of Jay Leno and Brett Butler, but still worth buying.  Enjoy!!!  And THANKS WILLY!!!",1147305600,4,1490,4.25
2156592,5,B0004Z33FK,"The early death of Bill Hicks only proves that America all too often kills its best and truest.

Over-intelligent, brutally honest, with the heart of a philosoher-poet, Hicks' work is timeless, spot-on, deep, and achingly funny.

He was under-appreciated in his own country because he refused to flatter his audience, and the American Sheeple frown on that.

Whether it's about his family, religion, politics, or sex, Hicks will have you laughing through you tears.

The introduction worngly compares Hicks to Sam Kinison, but that is like comparing Abraham Lincoln to George Bush; or Nirvana to Motley Crue for you teenage-males out there...(Hint: Kinison, Bush, and Motley Crew suck, dude.)  Kinison was semi-retarded and his comedy was like a dull loud chain-saw compared to Hicks' artistry and brilliance and incredible skill.

Bottom Line: all lovers of standup comedy must be familiar with this man's art and this DVD is an excellent place to start if you want to see him live on stage.

It contains material from three of his performances (Chicago, Montreal, London) -- unfortunately he delivers much of the same material at each venue. Instead of a 3.5 hour DVD this easily could have been kept to 90 minutes with just a bit of creative editing -- perhaps they should have interspersed scenes from the included documentary in between his live performance pieces to eliminate the redundancy?  As it stands it's as if he did three shows in your town on consecutive nights and you went to see all three of them -- you would catch a new joke or two at each show but you'd also end up hearing the same ones three times!",1136937600,11,777,4.464788732394366
2156595,5,B0004Z33FK,"Hicks was the best in the entire history of comedy, he was the personifiation of what real comedy should be - funny, interesting, thoughtful and meaningful. He was like Lenny Bruce, but actually better beause he had such an impressive and ebullient on-stage energy. He was the king of all time comedy and this DVD is a must see, until you see this you do not know the best comedy ever made. This is an undebatable fact.",1132704000,,419,4.454545454545454
2156596,5,B0004Z33FK,"My only real gripe with this DVD is the fact that the ""It's Just A Ride"" segment featured Jay Leno.  If anyone has listened to Rant in E Major, we know of Bills scorn for this man, so I'm not exactly sure why the producer of this segment decided this was a good idea.  It was obvious how Jay felt during these interviews, never really praising Bill in any way.

At any rate, It was wonderful to see Bill live.  You miss out on some really incredibe moments when listening to the albums, especially when relating the Christian use of the cross to the Kennedy assasination.

What's cute is when, as another previous reviewer had noted, folks claim his success is only due to his death.  Obviously dying young can create a timeless aura around an artist. Think James Dean or John Lennon. But they need a rare talent in the first place to ensure they don't slip into obscurity.

The man was charismatic.  He was witty and vulger at the same time.  He was a man that was fearless when standing up for what he believed in, which is incredibly rare and admirable.  Look at the ""UFO Tour"" album.  He was bombing, and he went way, way over his time in order to try to get these people to see his point of view.

My personal view on his current success and the fact that more and more material is being released is it's relevence to the times we live in.  We can see history repeating itself through his material, even within the short span of time since it was released.",1132185600,5,1461,4.327205882352941
2156597,2,B0004Z33FK,"It is amazing how a bloke this mediocre can attract so many followers. Is this a case of the emperor's clothing?

Let's examine his comedy (for want of a better description of what he actually does). Firstly,he tended to repeat the same jokes in different shows. Did he lack the innovation and creativity to come up with new material?

Secondly, and more importantly, his jokes aren't funny at all. He liked to be shockingly crude for the sake of it. Cussing can add poignancy to jokes when used cleverly, especially in scolding skits, but this bloke was totally incapable of being profane and funny at the same time.

Hicks had revelatory insight into American politics. His take on religion was interesting even though I did not always agree with it. his ideas were inspirational, thought-provoking and deep, but never amusing.

Don't waste your money on the Hicks lectures- cos that is what this dvd is about.",1132099200,4,912,4.826923076923077
2156598,5,B0004Z33FK,"This DVD was something I have been waiting many years for. I was introduced to Hicks' work purely by accident, when searching for other standup comics on a file sharing tool. Ever since then I have been an avowed fan of this great master of stand-up. I'll not belabour the point about how great his humour was or anything as there are enough sites and reviews that do just that.

This DVD packs three hours of Bill's best work. The classic ""Revelations"" is here, almost uncut. What is also in is a 1/2 hour Chicago One Night Stand and the restored ""Relentless"". It also has a bonus documentary on Hicks' life, titled ""Just a Ride"". These itself are enough to ensure that this DVD will be found in the shelves of any fan of real standup comedy. The quality is fantastic (except for a portion of Relentless which had to be restored from other tapes), and the sound crystal clear (hearing Hicks do his imitation of M C Hammer sucking Satan's Tool in stereo brought the neighbours down!) and for its price, has well over three hours of stuff which means its worth what, US$0.11 a minute? Well worth its price.

Finally Hicks' material is reaching out to audiences all over the world (I am in Singapore), and this DVD is just one more way his words can spread round. Remember, it's just a ride! :)",1130112000,6,1292,4.470338983050848
2156599,5,B0004Z33FK,"This dewd was one of a kind and this video gives a look into who he was, what he was about, and how he evolved as a comedian and as a human being. I had never heard of him up until a few years ago and after seeing this, I gained a new appreciation for him. Not many people are aware his life and who he influenced but he had the respect of a lot of famous comedians for his honesty, insight, and fearlessness. He was able to talk about things that other comedians wouldn't. To say he was edgy would be to understate. If I had to make a critisism about this video, it would be that some of the same material gets repeated throughout, but there is always some new twist on it that affirms that this guy just kept working on his craft. I wonder what he would be saying today if he were still alive.",1129161600,4,795,4.0062893081761
2156600,2,B0004Z33FK,"Please hold all venemous, angry comments until the conclusion of this review. O.K. here goes nothing... BILL HICKS IS OVERRATED. This DVD would not even exist had Mr. Hicks not died tragically and prematurely. I'm sorry, I know alot of Hicks' fans are shouting obscenities at their monitors at this very moment, but it's the truth. Every time an artist dies young, they are automatically elevated to the level of a ""misunderstood genius"", without truly earning the title. See Kaufman, Andy. My point is that Bill Hicks did nothing but browbeat his impressionable audiences with angry tirades, appearing more like a lecturer than a performer. I'll admit that at times Mr. Hicks was indeed brilliant, but no more than many other comics that are still very much alive and very much starving. Now comes the standard line about me being some unintelligent, closed minded jesus freak nazi. On the contrary, I agreed with Bill on much of what he said. I'm only saying he gets more credit than he deserves, may he rest in peace. Many call him the successor to Lenny Bruce. Bruce was no genius, either. Bruce was a trailblazer, whereas with Hicks, by the time the 80's and 90's had rolled around, well, it had all been done before. Face the facts, had it not been for his death, Bill Hicks would have been doing the ""Back in Black"" segment of ""The Daily Show"" instead of Lewis Black (obviously using a different title), or forgotten alltogether.",1128556800,10,1436,4.771084337349397
2156601,5,B0004Z33FK,"I was lucky enough to see Mr Hicks live in Glasgow, when I was about 18. The crowd was full of people whom I recognised from music gigs around town and they gave him the kind of reception normally reserved for the gods of the rock pantheon (which he helped by coming out to Purple Haze and closing with Tomorrow Never Knows). I guess I was the perfect age at the perfect time to be receptive to his message and delivery - I too was angry at lying governments and hookwinking ad execs, and full of rock and roll spirit. I raved about him to everyone and bought all the CDs. He captured the early 90s perfectly - I was crushed when he died and to my mind there hasn't been anyone like him since. But watching this DVD all these years later, I realise that his schtick was not specific to our times. In some way everything he said was timeless- trust your own judgement,make informed choices, get out and see the world with your own eyes -he could have been a sophist fer chrissake! His inquisitiveness, his fearlessness and his quick mind live on in the spirit of anyone who questions life without descending into cynicism. To me Bill is not dead.",1125446400,9,1145,4.355140186915888
2156602,4,B0004Z33FK,"I must admit, when I watched Bill Hicks Live: Satirist, Social Critic, Stand-Up Comedian a few months ago (my first exposure to his material), I wasn't all that impressed.  There were certainly parts that made me laugh, but for whatever reason his act just seemed a little too odd, a little too unhinged, a little too disjointed for me.  But a funny thing happened in the ensuing few weeks: I started thinking more and more about his statements at random moments, at work, at home, in the car, wherever.  I'd hear about some laughable clownishness emanating from Washington or some such place and be reminded of some particularly apt remark Hicks had made on a related subject.  I started quoting from the three specials on this disc to friends and family, and always getting a laugh out of them.  Somehow, Hicks's act just got into my head and stayed there, and it hasn't left since.

For those Americans tired of being squeezed by the ominous forces of political correctness on one side and growing neo-puritanism on the other, Hicks's comedy may not provide too many solutions, but it will almost certainly provide some laughs.  Delivering his rants in a deliriously profane and sardonic matter, Hicks wielded the dual weapons of reason and common sense to prove that the pen is truly mightier than the sword, at least when it comes to exposing the numerous foibles of humanity.  Hicks touched on subjects ranging from drugs to the government to religion to war and well beyond, but whatever he was talking about at a given moment Hicks managed to cut through the sloganeering that so often passes for debate in this day and age and expose the absurdity of the moral pretensions and false pieties that so often cloud our thinking.  Special attention is devoted to those who, always in the name of our best interests, seek to control and manipulate us every chance they get: smoking fascists, anti-pornography crusaders, drug warriors, and various other menaces to freedom and logic.

Ignorance, prejudice, and just plain stupidity all get put under a microscope in these three specials as Hicks mocks deeply held beliefs of all stripes and slays sacred cows with abandon.  In one especially telling sequence, Hicks launches into a vitriolic assault on Christianity, then recounts being confronted after a show down South by three self-identified Christians who took issue with his atheistic beliefs.  Hicks's response?  ""Oh yeah?  Then forgive me.""  Perhaps at no other point does Hicks do a better job of highlighting hypocrisy and narrowmindedness, and he pulls it off in just two brief sentences.  It's just too bad Hicks met his untimely end in 1994 at the age of 32; I'm sure he'd have had a field day with the current climate in this country.  At any rate, all thinking people should give this DVD a look.",1124064000,7,2814,4.853556485355648
2156603,4,B0004Z33FK,"But Hicks would probably drag me over the coals for that one, launching into a brilliant assault on my weak-minded sycophancy.

Hicks is the master.  He's right on the edge of ""stand-up comedy,"" challenging his audience with edgy politics, telling them to stand up and unplug themselves from the matrix.  He's not content to stroke his audience, he pokes and prods them, screaming in their faces ""Wake up, wake up, WAKE UP!!!""  He's the ultimate libertarian-- imagine Bill Maher with more bite, more intelligence, more soul.

You get three excellent performances from Hicks here, plus a documentary.  The only reason I give four stars out of five is because there is considerable overlap of material in the three shows, and I found the documentary weak.  Who needs Jay Leno's and Brett Butler's pathetic analysis...?  Leno's bland comedic pablum is a far cry from the Bill's dark, brilliant energy.  (Listen to Hicks tear the ""Doritos-shilling"" Jay Leno to shreds on ""Rant in E Minor."")

2156604,5,B0004Z33FK,"as one of bill's despised 'advertising and marketing' folk, i've written professionally my entire adult career, yet finding the words to describe bill hick's genius feels like coming down from the mountain and trying to describe the radiant face of god.

the first night i saw Revelations on cable, i felt like i'd suddenly been told i had a long lost brother. the emotion of seeing someone not just saying things i'd personally felt and believed for years, but hammering them home so viciously to penetrate the thick skulls of the common public herd was rapturous. i laughed, i cried, my heart broke. and when it was over, i turned to the other people in the room and said ""boy, he won't live long - what's he thinking, telling the truth in public like that?"" little did i know he was already dead.

to compare bill hicks to others in the stand up comedy world is futile - and an insult to what he did. bill was not a common clown. he was a spiritual emissary from god, sent to wake us from our somnambulistic social lethargy. and given a little more time,

perhaps he'd have disconnected enough pods from the matrix to set off a chain reaction and awaken the planet.

2156606,2,B0004Z33FK,"Why was this guy so highly praised? I just don't get it.  I watched this straight through and didn't laugh once!  His material is very familiar since I've enjoyed Sam Kinison and Denis Leary (first album) for some years now.  In fact, some of Bill's jokes are nearly identical.  Who stole from whom?  Who cares?  Sam and Denis did a much better job of it and that's the thing that matters most.

  The problems I have with Hicks are his delivery and his  timing.  First of all, I must say that I consider Chris Rock's ""Bring the Pain"" to be the absolute pinnacle of the stand-up art, closely followed by George Carlin's ""Jammin' in New York"" and Richard Pryor's first live special.  These three were consumate professionals who excelled not only in delivery and timing, but in selling each joke thoroughly and in seamlessly incorporating physical humor into their routines.  This is where Hicks failed, he just wasn't in the Big Leagues.  The first two specials (out of three + a documentary) are particulary weak.  His impressions aren't very good, the pratfalls are lame, and he just doesn't drive home the punchlines the way he should have.

  I will admit however, that some of his writing was pretty smart and observant (obviously, he was well-read) and on the mark politically.  It just wasn't as entertaining as it could've been and that's a real shame.

  As for all the five-star reviews, who knows?  Maybe these people admire his far-left political leanings more than his actual talent.  In any case, I just can't recommend this to any serious fan of comedy.  Sorry Bill, R.I.P.",1110758400,13,1588,4.75

2156608,4,B0004Z33FK,"Bill ends one of the concerts on this disc with his thought of how if we the world, put our weapons down, it would be possible to feed and clothe everyone on the planet and give us all the chance to explore outerspace together in peace in harmony.  Far fetched to be sure, but isn't it a beautiful vision for a world we can dream for?  Shortly before this he tells the audience that the good die young yet demons live on.  Could Hick's death not too much later cement that theory?  I don't love everything Hicks says and he was hardly a saint, but I do belive that the man had a vision that was devoted to the betterment of mankind and unlike many today could back up his claims that could honestly make even a staunch non beliver scratch his head and wonder.

This DVD collects Bill's offical TV recordings and unfortunatley a lot of the same material gets covered on all three shows.  Even worse, is if you have heard the CD's, ALOT of it's the same.  Bill is reported to have tape recorded a lot of his shows, at the very least audio recorded.  Wouldn't that have been more fun and interesting not to mention new for those of us who don't have our hands on the oodles of Hick's bootleg stuff outthere?  A fourth show has many comedians talk about their love of Hicks, and how they influenced them.  Ironically enough Jay Leno is here and has some nice words to say.  Makes me wonder when this was before or after hearing the ""Jay Leno with an Uzi"" bit from RANT IN E MINOR, a bit which I nearly busted ribs hearing the first time.

Alas, no great improvments to the video quality in terms of remastering or anything, in fact one of the tracks notes that you can skip over scenes that are less then watchable quality.

It is because of this and the lack of fresh material that I cannot give the disc a 5 star review. The disc was still worthwhile however for the new material not on CD's and the documentary thats on here as well as seeing Hicks perform which is a plus.  I will close but before I do I will stop and wonder what Hicks would have to say about events going on today and since his death in 94.  Lets go over a few of them.  Flight 800, the Clinton Lewinski affair, The movie Showgirls (quick capsule review anyone?) Kosovo, George W Bushes elections, reality TV, the World Trade Center attacks, Titanic, Michael Moore (tell me he isn't a fevered ego, Bill would see through him) Pokemon, Boy Bands, Pop Princesses, The new war in Iraq.

This DVD captures the Bill Hicks that I nearly saw a man clearly at the top of his game and at his most incisive. Sadly some of the material is repeated in various concerts that are featured on this DVD but the accompanying documentary which features David Letterman and the like talking about their encounters with Bill is worth the price anyway. I'm told Bill Hicks died a happy and contented man despite his short life of only 32 years and I'm glad about that I think he earned it.

Hicks was one of those.  Though I only got to see him onstage for one week's worth of shows in 1987, his body of work thankfully became more commercially available over the next decade.

Hicks is one of the rare comics with a point of view that both skewers and embraces Mankind.  He loved his country and his fellow man, and that gave him license to stab and poke at their flaws.  He championed THOUGHT as the means to combat Mediocrity and the Sheep Mentality.

This DVD is a sufficient look into his mastery of his craft and his unflinching control over his audience.  Sometimes his control of the audience was mixed with disdain towards them, too.  But it was closer to ""tough love"" than animosity or condescension.

Not everyone will recognize Bill's brilliance and not everyone will ""get"" the humor.  Actually, the brighter you are the more likely you will appreciate Bill Hicks.

Buy this DVD and be elevated to a higher understanding of how the interactive medium of stand-up can be used as a persuasive pulpit not for bullying or mass entertainment but for communal introspection and self-examination.",1100390400,56,1279,4.7681818181818185
2156625,5,B0004Z33FK,"It is frustrating but not surprising to me that it has taken this long to finally have live footage of Bill Hicks available to the American public. Prior to this, the footage could only be found in England where Hicks had (and still has) the regard and respect he so desired from America. You can buy his albums and hear his comedy, but to truly understand his power, you have to see him.

I will never have the privilege of seeing him live, but this is the closest I can come and my God his voice and originality remain poignant today. Very few people outside of the comedy community know who he is and that is unfortunate. It is like going through life without ever hearing Shakespeare's words spoken loudly, clearly and passionately. It cuts through the skin penetrating the soul and can move a person in a way that will make them change their direction in life. This is the comedy Bill Hicks.

I ask anyone reading this to go out and buy this DVD or to buy one of his CDs. If you are thinking about doing comedy you must own Hicks. Even if you've never heard his name you have felt his influence on many of today's comedians. Most of which either knew him or have seen him perform: Denis Leary (who some say stole from Hicks), Jon Stewart, Chris Rock, Dave Attel, Carlos Mencia, Marc Maron, Lewis Black, Dennis Miller, Bill Maher, even Leno and Letterman. It is impossible to have seen him perform and not be influenced by him. Hicks himself started comedy young and knew if he was ever going to be good he had to study the masters like Richard Pryor, Woody Allen, and Lenny Bruce to name a few. Hicks is now one of the masters and anyone who wants to be a comedian should soak him up like he's Aristotle. Because really? What is a comedian besides a philosopher examining the attitudes and fashions of our time? And let's you know these attitudes and fashions are stupid. Yeah, I went to college.",1099526400,6,1901,4.413105413105413

2156627,5,B0004Z33FK,"I just got through watching this masterpeice.  It came in the mail earlier today.  I must say that I am impressed.  I've been a fan of Hicks for a little over a year and own all of his cd's, but had never actually seen him in action until earlier this afternoon.  He had a great stage presence that coincided with his routines extremely well, and this DVD is evidence of that.  His delivery was one of a kind.  His audiences may not have always understood what he was all about, but he seems to hold his ground no matter what.  ""By the way there are d*ck jokes on the way.""  I have to agree with the other reviewers that say that you haven't heard truth until you've heard Hicks.  Bill Hicks can easily change the way that you look at everything in this world.",1099094400,10,760,4.222222222222222
2156628,5,B0004Z33FK,"In a perfect world, Bill Hicks would've found the kind of fame and fortune and acceptance that went to other stand-up comics who parlayed their material into multi-million dollar sit-coms.

But we don't live in a perfect world, and that's one of the things that fueled Hicks' art.  It almost makes sense that he died underheard, underpaid, censored and young.

The good news is that most of the things he railed against way back in the early 90s -- the war in Iraq, President Bush, awful pop music, closed-mindedness against drugs, corporate co-opting, advertising and smoking -- are all still pretty fresh topics.

This DVD includes his 1991 performance at Chicago's Old Vic Theatre (which was made as an HBO ""One Night Stand""), his 1991 gig at the Montreal International Comedy Festival, his 1991 ""Revelations"" show at the Dominion Theatre in England and the documentary about his career, ""It's Just a Ride,"" which aired in chopped-up form on Comedy Central years ago.

It's a great collection of material that is frightening, harrowing, intense and always, always incredibly funny.  Required viewing for anybody who thinks more than, say, ten hours a day.",1098835200,15,1158,5.036649214659686
