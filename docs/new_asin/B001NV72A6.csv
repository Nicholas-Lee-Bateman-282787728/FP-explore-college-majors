8327947,1,B001NV72A6,"This is a perplexing product.  I am an experienced dancer in another style who likes to try out beginner's dvds in various dance styles, just for exposure to different styles and for a change of pace every now and then.  To start with, this is clearly a DVD for beginners who are already taking Irish dance lessons, not for people brand new to Irish dance.  There is no breakdown of what the basic steps are--the combos are broken down (more on that in a moment) but there is no guidance as to how each individual step, tap or kick should be executed.  With regard to the combos, the basic breakdown is fine as far as it goes, but I felt that the instructor should have been filmed facing a mirror rather than facing the camera (as is standard in most quality videos) so that you do not have to mentally switch right and left, or try to mirror the instructor knowing that you are not doing it right.  And then when she turns around to instruct her class, who are facing the viewer, you end up having to completely reverse whatever you just learned in order to follow along.  Finally, the class itself is composed of very young children, not the tween or teen shown on the cover.  They are totally adorable, and admirably skilled for their age.  However, they are not high level dancers, and do not make good models for following along as they are rarely in unison and do not all execute movements in the same way.  In the end, I'm not at all sure who this video is meant for.  It might be useful to an older child with some lessons in hand already who wants a quick and easy way to review basic steps, though I think one can find better on YouTube these days.  It is not particularly useful for an adult who would like to learn a bit about Irish dance.  There is zero instruction about musicality, or why certain steps are done to certain pieces.  As a semi-professional dancer myself, I have very high standards for instructional DVDs, and this review reflects that.  If you want something on as background with some cute kids dancing and cheery Irish music playing, this DVD would suit that purpose.  But as an instructional DVD for actual beginners, it does not fulfill its function.",1469491200,4,2186,4.457286432160804
8327948,2,B001NV72A6,"It's okay but not the best Irish Dance lessons..! :( :( the Teacher in the video go's to fast on here and if your complete new to Irish dancing then this is not a good video for you, but if you already know the Irish Dance moves and need to brush up I suppose it may be alright then.. Not so happy with it nyself though!",1460160000,,320,3.8636363636363638
8327949,5,B001NV72A6,Great old school Irish Step Dancing! Perfect for beginners. :) Modern Irish dance is very complex but this is how it used to be! :),1453420800,3,131,4.28
8327950,4,B001NV72A6,"I believe this DVD is good, but I think it is more for Festive Irish Dancing rather than the faster pace Step Dancing, Please correct me if I am wrong.  It is worth the money and I will probably buy the complete set.",1397174400,3,216,4.023255813953488
8327951,5,B001NV72A6,My daughter has been taking Irish Dancing for 2 years now and since then I have been trying to find a DVD for extra practice at home and this is it. The teacher shows you how to preform the dances and then gives a demo with her students. I like this because I can stop the DVD and review the dances as many time as I need too and have my daughter follow the teacher and students. This DVD has also helped improved my daughters dance moves and has helped us correct some stepping errors she was making that her own teacher did not see. I highly recommend this DVD to beginner Irish dance students and parents (like me who are clueless about the different dances and steps). I also have not found anyother DVD on Irish Dancing in a DVD format.,1345334400,25,741,4.225352112676056
