6505140,5,B00LTO33JQ,"I made it my mission in life to tell people about the wonderful show. It's funny, cool, and only occasionally serious. If you grew up in the 80's you will LOVE the fact that every episode has some kind of 80's pop culture reference. Everything from Karate Kid to Tears for Fears to Star wars and The Facts of LIfe! Truly one of my favorite shows ever. So buy this and join all the Psych fans in ""The Blueberry"" and lets all go the ""Quarter Black"" concert!!!",1408838400,42,457,4.264367816091954
6505141,5,B00LTO33JQ,"It's such a rarity that a TV series is accessible to everyone in the family.  Psych is relatively clean, funny, and stays interesting throughout its entire run.  I never felt uncomfortable having this show on while children were in the room, and they seemed to enjoy it as much as the parents and grandparents.  Unlike many other popular TV series, this show stays consistent in its quality throughout the years.  Its last season is just as funny and interesting as its first, if not more so.

One word of advice: there is a major tone shift from the pilot to the rest of the series, and so I'd recommend newcomers either skip the pilot (and come back to it later) or keep in mind that it's a much weaker episode than what you'd normally get.  I've had a few friends ignore this piece of advice, and tell me they weren't interested in the show after watching the pilot.  (It's an easy fix, I'd simply show them the first episode of season 2 and they would become full blown Psych-os.)

For fans who are wondering about the DVD set itself, this set DOES include Psych: The Musical on one of the discs for Season 8.  This set also includes a single bonus disc with the Psych After Pshow.  It will be a nice bonus for the hardcore fan, but it's not essential viewing.  Every single DVD-based bonus feature will be included here, so it really is the complete collection.

And for those who would rather buy seasons individually, you're getting the exact same disc content (minus the bonus disc that includes the Psych After Pshow) packaged differently.  So if you've already started your collection, you can choose how you want to complete it.  I hope this helps!",1407715200,301,1659,4.5608108108108105
6505142,5,B00LTO33JQ,"Wow amazing! I cannot wait to own this. Would be great if it was released in region 2 so us UK Psych fans can own it on UK format, until then this set will more than make do! Anyone know if it includes the Psych Musical episode and if it includes the CD of the songs that came with the region 1 release? Thanks!",1407542400,3,311,3.875
6505143,5,B00LTO33JQ,"Actual detective shows are kind of hard to find now -- let alone a funny, well-written series with a hilarious twist. That's where ""Psych"" comes into the picture.

While the first season had a few wrinkles to iron out, ""Psych: The Complete Series"" does a good job blending comedy and mystery until you can't even see the seams anymore. While dealing with serious stuff (murders, serial-killers, the odd kidnapping), James Roday and Dule Hill turn every story into a delicious farce of fake-psychic goofiness.

Shawn Spencer (James Roday) was trained to be ultra-observant by his strict father Henry (Corbin Bernsen), who wanted him to be a cop. Though he is determined never to be a cop (he doesn't even have a steady job), Shawn can glimpse clues and details that nobody else notices But it backfires when he reports his observations to the police, and is arrested as a suspect.

To save himself, Shawn pretends to be a psychic -- and the gimmick works so well that he decides to do it professionally.  Along with his reluctant pal Gus (Dul&eacute; Hill), Shawn is regularly hired by the police chief, despite the skepticism of cranky Detective Lassiter (Timothy Omundson). With the assistance of Lassiter's mellower partner Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson), they take on a bizarre array of cases.

Most shows aren't really able to strike a balance between comedy and mystery, but ""Psych"" does. While there is the occasional serious moment (""An Evening with Mr. Yang""), there's lots of comedy (""That is an anti-tank weapon, and you're pointing it at yourself""), usually involving some unusual plot twists (strangulation by mummy bandage, cat as sole witness, a MUSICAL EPISODE).

Each episode is a well-done little mystery, usually with some solid whodunnit material, dozens of pop culture references (from James Bond to wikipedia). Not to mention the hilarious dialogue (""I thought it was the chocolate roooooooooom...."") and kookiness (Shawn's pseudo-mystical ""episodes"") that keeps it from ever being dull -- mostly supplied by Shawn, but everybody gets some fun time (Gus's zombie dreams). Gotta love that.

There is a slight flaw, though -- in the first season, a disproportionate number of the guilty parties seem to be pretty young women. Fortunately this starts lessening as time goes on. The mysteries get progressively tighter, and the writing cleverer and funnier (""I'm never doing anything blindly with you again! I learned that at the Mexican border. Twice!"").

Roday is hilarious and brilliant -- charming, funny, likable, pleasant, and completely devoid of any dignity (""IIIIII hear a voice!""), with some great full-body acting. Shawn is one of those people who is half luck and half talent; no matter how outragous he gets, things somehow always work out. But though he's utterly irresponsible at first, we see him evolve and mature enough to pursue a real, serious romantic relationship.

 Hill is equally good as Shawn's opposite -- a conservative, responsible, geeky pharmaceutical salesman who regularly gets sucked into Shawn's crazy schemes. On the official side of the cast fence, we have the crusty, hard-nosed Omundson, and the sprightly blonde Maggie Lawson (""an enigma wrapped in a little blonde riddle""). Corbin Bernsen also makes regular appearances as Shawn's dad, who considers his son a walking freakshow but clearly loves him deeply.

""Psych: The Complete Series"" is a delightfully frothy mix of comedy and mystery, with solid scripting and likable characters. Definitely a show to keep on your watch list.",1407024000,44,3537,5.187719298245614

6505200,5,B00LTO33JQ,"I don't know what it is about these two guys (James Roday and Dule Hill) but I've got a permanent soft spot in my heart for Gus and Shawn. I was approximately in the same age group of their characters when they were on the air  and maybe that is why I found their humor relatable. Even now, though for the most part, I've outgrown some of the overt slapstick-style humor and over the top hijinks, I love this show. If it was any other show, I probably couldn't bear to watch it. Yes, as some reviewers have commented, some of the comedy is silly... But it somehow just feels right coming from these two characters and it's just good fun. I love Dule Hill and James Roday in these roles. I still regard Psych is one of my favorite dramedies of all time. I read the reviews before I purchased this set and I was reluctant to purchase even though it was being offered at a super great price of $43 at the time. That's the cheapest I had ever seen it on Amazon and I really wanted it. That's just a little over 5 bucks per season and I had never seen it cheaper than that. In fact, I had once seen it offered for $199 and as much as I love these guys and this show, I definitely wasn't paying that! But there were so many negative reviews about the quality of the packaging and the quality of the discs themselves. I'm probably about six or seven discs in and I haven't had any problems with skipping or blurriness. (I sure hope I don't start experiencing issues as I go on. If I do, I'll be sure to update my review.) As for the problems that some cited about the quality of the disc case and packaging, I have purchased DVDs of currently popular series like NCIS Los Angeles and Elementary as well as the complete sets of several other shows that are no longer on the air. Some of these have what I consider to be cheaper packaging and more problematic packaging than this. I've had experiences where you have to press that little button that holds the disc in place so hard to release a disc that you're in fear of breaking the disc. I've had instances where the rod that holds the entire library of discs in place just completely became detached from the case and will no longer stay in there firmly. If you open the case too fast, they all go flying out. Trust me, I've had to crawl on my hands and knees and reach under a piece of furniture more than once to retrieve a disc that fell to the floor and rolled away due to this problem. However, I've had no problems with the Psych case. I don't regard it to be that cheap. At least it's no cheaper than any others that I have purchased recently. Overall, I think it's an absolutely great set and I have really enjoyed the opportunity to watch these guys again (along with the rest of the cast). Such great fun! I've even turned on some of the commentary (which is something that I rarely do because it usually bores me to tears) and I have looked at some of the bonus features to get some insight into what the creation of this series was like back then. Pretty interesting. So far (fingers crossed) I am glad that I ignored the negative reviews and made the purchase.",1520294400,,3119,4.250841750841751
6505201,5,B00LTO33JQ,Grandson gift for Christmas. He loves it. Case somewhat fragile so we gave him a cloth zipper case in which to store the set.,1520035200,,125,4.25
6505202,5,B00LTO33JQ,"The Joy that Psych Brings
In the T.V. show, Psych, two best friends, who were friends since birth, started an investigation agency. Shawn has this ability to remember the smallest details in his surroundings and with his best friend, Gus, they start solving cases. Gus is a pharmaceutical sales rep that helps Shawn on occasion with the technical aspect of the case. Gus and Shawn are like brothers. They know everything about one another, and they have been with each other through up and downs. They consider each other to be family.
The first time I experienced the wonderful joy of what Psych has to offer was when I was 12 years old. When I first watched Psych, I was like This is hilarious! I want to see more, but cant find it because I didn't have cable. When I got Netflix, I found Psych on there and was so ecstatic. I watched all the seasons and laughed so hard and loud that my mom wanted me to shut up. Since then I have watched Psych three times, and each time I laugh like it was my first time watching it.
 I love watching Psych because when I am feeling gloomy or want to laugh, Psych is  there to cheer me up. I watch Psych because of the funny partnership between Shawn and Gus. It reminds me of how my sister and I can laugh about almost anything. Psych made me realize that I can be who I am, be true to myself, and act goofy, no matter how old I am.  However, Psych does have its serious moments. For example, in Season 3, Episode 16, a serial killer name Yang is seeking Shawn out to play a game. Each time Yang comes out of hiding, he selects a police officer that can defeat him/her. During this time in solving the case, Shawn is tested with the ability to cope with obstacles handed to him. As the case is getting intense, Shawn lashes out, but Gus is there to support Shawn and makes things easier for him. Also, Gus knows Shawn's secret and helps to keep that hidden.
Overall, Psych is an amazing show that keeps you laughing and wanting more, along with the amazing  partnership between Shawn and Gus. The obstacles and intense that the cast face in the tv show keeps everything realistic to where everything isn't just a joke. Relating it back to real life situation like parents divorce, not having the best relationship with your father and going through that stage of being an adult.",1519689600,,2317,4.393939393939394

6505315,4,B00LTO33JQ,Such a great deal at the time. I'm forever grateful I bought this. My only complaint is that the bubble wrap wasn't super effective because the sharp edges of the case likely popped them (it was deflated when it arrived) and so the case ended up cracking anyway.

After noticing the poor quality of the product I looked online and found that there is apparently a whole bunch of cheap knock-offs floating around. The real product should have the thick (about 1/8 inch thick) yellow green hard plastic case.

Here's the quality issues I found with the product.
* the dvd holders are held together by a strip boxing tape
* poor video quality on some of the DVD's
* really pixelated DVD menus with lots of jpeg artifacts

6505387,2,B00LTO33JQ,"First, let me say, if you have a dry sense of humor and haven't seen this show, you NEED to! It is hilarious. Most episodes are not gruesome (I can't handle ANY blood, dead people with eyes open, etc) but I am able to watch this. My husband and I have seen the episodes at least 3 or 4 times and still enjoy it.

We bought the complete set because it was just taken down off Netflix. When the box set came, I was a bit shocked at the quality. The case to hold everything together is a flimsy plastic, kind of like plastic file folders. The cover is okay, but all the disks are in cheap plastic disk holders and the entire set is held together by large packing tape. Not good quality. I could have gotten past the case issue, but the picture quality is horrendous as well. As we were watching, we kept waiting for the page to rebuff like we always did with Netflix and then realized: it's a disk. It won't get any better. At best it's a little fuzzy, at worst the entire screen is pixilated. We watched three episodes to see if it was a random occurrence, but it's not. We promptly asked for a return label to send it back, but the company said we could keep it. We are continuing to watch it since it was free, but I would not recommend this particular product.",1508630400,48,1261,4.168032786885246

All of the disks were out of order when I opened the packaging for the 1st time and then to pour salt in the wound the 1st disk of the 8th season was missing and replaced with the 1st disc of the 6th season so Now I have 2 6th season disk one disk and no 8th season disk one.

6505427,2,B00LTO33JQ,"There's no doubt that Psych is a great show that deserves a 5 star rating. BUT this complete series set is just terrible. The packaging is just bad and causes disc scratching.

 I purchased this in fall 2015 and I have yet to have the free time to watch the entire series. It took me 45 days after after receiving the set to actually remove the shrink wrap because I originally was going to give this as a gift to someone, only to discover they already owned the indvidual season sets.

When I finally got around to watching it, i gave up at season 1 disc 3 due to the fact there was a scratch on the disc. I blame the plastic that faces the recorded side of the disc. it's too scruffy.

UPDATE : 11/22/2017 - my friend has borrowed the set and finished it. She has stated that about 20 episodes skip and those discs have visibile scracthes caused by the case. None of the discs left their slots until she put them in her players (with an s. She's watched on more than one device - bluray player, laptop, gaming console, etc)

There must be a reason why it's now only available by 3rd party sellers. NBC-Universal must have gotten enough complaints about it. I will be purchasing the individual seasons December 2017 now that I will able to afford to. This show is too amazing to not own",1505520000,15,1287,4.301652892561983

6505485,3,B00LTO33JQ,As a die hard Psych fan after it left Netflix I had to have the complete series.  There were only really 2 options either buy this complete collection or buy the individual seasons.  Both of which I find to be a bit overpriced for a series that ended years ago and was on Netflix for about 5-6 years.  I chose this option and while I am enjoying it I do have 2 major complaints.  One the dvd quality is very poor imo it's like watching a copy of a copy and if you are someone that has grown used to blu ray quality you will hate it. Two the packaging is poor the discs are actually just held together by tape.  In the end I hope this series eventually returns to one of the streaming services and I'd recommend reading the poor reviews before buying.,1501977600,4,750,4.144827586206897
6505486,5,B00LTO33JQ,I love the series -- and pineapple too!,1501804800,,39,4.0
6505487,4,B00LTO33JQ,"Back in 2006 when PSYCH premiered on the USA Network, ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY weighed in with a C-minus evaluation, saying, among other things:  ""Predictable and . . . led by an incredibly unappealing character named Shawn Spencer (James Roday),"" even tagging the new show ""MONK for morons.""  Clearly, not everyone likes Roday's character, a flaky underachiever who is an excellent observer due to the patient training of his policeman father (Corbin Bernsen) going back to middle school.  There are also those of us who think his character is cute, or excuse his slapstick pseudo-psychic ""trances"" as entree to contract work for the Santa Barbara Police Department, or just suffer the unreality of the show's premise the same way an earlier generation put up with the Beverly Hillbillies' years-long ignorance of how a doorbell works.

However, PSYCH ran for eight years at USA, for most of its run pulling in three to four million viewers per episode, a good strong showing for basic cable.  It does well in repeats, too, and now rates a sterling 92 on Rotten Tomatoes' ""Tomatometer.""  Naturally, among PSYCH fans there is much enthusiasm for this consolidated package on DVD, complete with pineapple motif on the cover.  And there's a lot to like -- the gentle spoofing of TV and movie genres ranging from 1990's teen horror to Forties noir to Seventies wa-ka-cha, disco-influenced partner  shows.  (There's even one entirely musicalized episode.)  Roday's character of Shawn Spencer is helped (and gently toned down) by an excellent supporting cast, including Bernsen, Dul Hill as his long-suffering detective partrner and best friend, and tremendous guest stars like Cary Elwes and Cybill Shepherd.  I was delighted to receive this DVD set for my birthday.

What don't I like about this set?  The bells-and-whistles, which occasionally rise to competence but are often dismally lame.  Not all episodes contain a full commentary; of those that do, my favorites are the ones in which creator/producer Steve Franks stays in control, offering insights about that episode's filming and information about how to make suburban Vancouver, British Columbia, substitute for Santa Barbara, California.  My least favorite are those in which Roday and other cast members play goofball:  speaking in funny voices, snickering unaccountably, and generally trying to parody a parody, which is rarely a good idea.  The worst commentaries come across as actors pretending to be improv comedians, surrendering any semblance of discipline and making the track sound something like an audition for Mystery Science Theater 3000 in a room mysteriously flooded with laughing gas. (A laxity the MST cast strenuously avoids in its own commentaries, thank heaven.)  We can tell the PSYCH actors are having fun in the making of most episodes; to go beyond that is too much like their having fun at our expense.  Frankly, if commentary becomes a mere in-joke that serves neither the needs of fans or of newcomers, I have to wonder why they bothered.  If not for this chronic self-indulgence, I'd happily have given this product five stars.",1501718400,,3111,5.196392785571143

On the 4th disc of the 3rd season, I was looking at the episode selection, and I kept clicking to the end, which normally would send you back to the beginning, but on this disc, a whole new button appeared.

6505542,5,B00LTO33JQ,"First, I want to address the ""damaged product"" reviews: 1) Thank you, for making me aware of the possibility that discs late-in-the- series may not play properly. It reminded me to run a J. Mykaal digital purchase test. Psych: The Complete Series, bought in ""New"" condition from Movie Mars passed with flying colors.

Secondly, I'd like to share the aforementioned test with future buyers. So you too can test your video/audio products free of spoilers.
1) For a long-running series such as Psych, start from the latest disc and work backwards to season 1 disc 1.
2) insert each disc into your player. Ensure the disc loads, plays, and goes to menu.
3) from the menu, start each chapter to ensure the disc and player read, recognize, and differentiate chapters. This only takes 1-2 seconds (no plot reveals)
3) play each disc from the beginning of chapter 1. Skip to random areas of each chapter/episode  to ensure video and audio are synched. This may reveal a line or two of dialogue; at worst you may see a guest star.
2. Before the episode/chapter ends skip to the next.
3. Repeat step 3); 1. for each chapter/episode.
If a disc has a scratch or other error, this test should identity than.

Now to review Psych the series: This is plain and simply too of the line entertainment. The original characters and writing make this show worth a watch. The fact that they can be downright hilarious while simultaneously being wholesome makes it a favorite of mine. The fact that the shows creators, cast, producers, editors, and other staff recognize that wholesome does not need to be synonymous with lame keeps Psych in my top ten.

Finally the product/shipping: The item arrived in a timely manner, in good condition, there was a small crack in the plastic shell/exoskeleton (no big deal).  The product itself is high quality. The seasons are divided into 4 discs. The discs are stacked like a book, two to a ""page"". The exoskeleton is pale green yellowish plastic. Kind of distorts the internal packaging/case; which is cardboard. Seasons, episodes, and special features are listed on the front sleeve (folds out)

Inside said sleeve is an additional disc: ""Psych: After the Pshow""",1474848000,3,2182,4.836461126005362

Shawn, the main character uses unconventional methods to solve crimes for SBPD and that is what makes the show so funny. This is a tv show that regardless of the kind of day you had at work, you can laugh your head off and go to bed happy. I have rewatched the complete series over and over again and it amazes me how many one liners I never caught before because I was laughing too much at all the other lines being said. Was sad when the series finally ended and some shows end on a cliff hanger or in a strange manner. However, I absolutely love how they appropriately ended the series.

6505561,5,B00LTO33JQ,"There's lots of crime shows, lots of comedies, and lots of dramedies (not sure how you spell it but you know what I mean: drama/comedy).  But Psych found a way to be different.  They pair two best friends with one white and the other black, yet do it in a way that is not cliche.  They have a son trying to live up to his father's expectations, but again they do it in a way that is not cliche.  I wouldn't say the show is pioneering, but it really is unlike any other show out there.  I'd say Psych could be a cousin to ""Monk"", but they're both distinct from each other.  The show is very entertaining, funny, cleverly written, and satisfies the fan who likes a good who-dunnit.  My favorites are the tribute shows where they pay homage to Clue, Twin Peaks, The Shining and many others.  The 80's references both spoken and visual are more than you can probably count, and the best part is they are just little treats added to the show.  Main character, Shawn Spencer's personality will remind you of other goofy people and characters, but not in a way that you feel he's a copy-cat.  The writing is good enough that although you can reasonably guess how everything will end, you rarely know how it will get there.  Thankfully this show never jumped the shark.  I feared it might happen when (spoiler alert) Shawn and Juliette became a couple, but it worked and didn't hinder the show at all.  All that being said, I'd have to say the first few seasons are my favorite.  Still they never had a bad episode and like another great show, Chuck, I wish Psych would come back!  Great casting, superb acting, and perfect acting chemistry between Dule Hill and James Roday.",1467676800,,1667,4.455445544554456

6505571,5,B00LTO33JQ,"I love this show! This reminds me of the shows I sat around the tv screen watchng with my parents as a kid. This is the type of show that I love watching with my children. It is nice clean fun. Even as Shawn develops a relationship with a girl you rarely see him do more than hold hands. Additionally, despite being a detective/mystery show there is not a large display of blood and guts and gore.

Shawn Spencer is the 'psychic' in this team. Gus Guster is a sniffer, a drug rep sales man, and Shawn's side kick. The premise is that these two have been friends since kindergarten. Shawn is the one who thinks of strange ideas and Gus is his straight line man.

Some of my favorite things....
The insults that Shawn is able to whip out.
The names that Shawn calls Gus every time he introduces him to someone.
The search for the pineapple. In every show there is a pineapple in some way- pineapple pizza, pineapple shaped lamps, so on and so on.
The 80's! Every show has some 80's comment- either a movie quote, a song, a picture on the wall or something.

Overall, it makes for fun watching because I keep my eyes and ears glued to the screen looking for each of these things.

And the strange situations they wind up in are hilarious.

The other thing I liked was the various shows based on genres of tv/movies. There was a Bollywood version, a horror show version, a western version and more. Those were great fun. Even the titles and names were worked right into the whole version to look just like they would if it were a wester tv show etc.

This is a great show.",1458864000,,1568,4.2983050847457624

6505593,3,B00LTO33JQ,"Great show.  The packaging leaves a little bit to be desired.  It's made of a hard, fragile plastic that cracks easily.  Mine had 3 or 4 cracks in the outside and one corner was broken off.",1452643200,2,189,4.194444444444445
6505604,5,B00LTO33JQ,"Great family show! It's was a huge hit with my tween daughters and just a lot of fun all around. It's campy but you really get to love the characters. Great banter and tons of obscure 80's references (and actors that make cameos). Watch at least 3-4 episodes before you decide. And things really take off in the second season. The only downer is that it really went out with a wimper - the last half of the 8th season was not great. It's like people had already checked out and moved on. Not horrible, but I wished it would have been better.",1452384000,,541,4.262135922330097
6505605,5,B00LTO33JQ,"Let's begin, To start, this is one of USA Network's best shows. I grew up on the renaissance of great TV coming out of the works on their channel. It started with Monk (a show that demonstrated one of the network's first attempts toward character-based entertainment). From there, the likes of Suits, White Collar, Mr Robot, Graceland, Royal Pains, Covert Affairs, Burn Notice, In Plain Sight, Necessary Roughness, Fairly Legal, Sirens, and many others blossomed and turned the network into an entertainment powerhouse on cable. Yet with the laundry list of titles above, some of which (like Monk, Mr Robot, Suits, White Collar, and Burn Notice) rate higher to me over the rest, Psych remains the best show of the lot IMO. And then around October 2014, USA graced us with finally releasing the entirety of the series in one collectible package. That is what is pictured above. But how does the package work?

It's a neon-yellow case that is open on one side. The innards slide out easy enough. The front of the innards is an unfoldable page, spreading out to the left and giving you an episode listing, along with a summary of the extras each season has. The DVDs are held in a multipage plastic book, two discs to a page (the tabs are the ones that pivot down at one end with a push, not the four arrow-style ones that point inward and can break more easily). In testing out the durability, I found that every disc was nicely secured with their tabs, to the point there was no spinning or movement that would cause any wear in-transit. This is a double-edged argument, because you will have to put a bit of work to push the tabs down to work out each disc. The only issue I would cite with this style of packaging is that the pages have only a thin bit of plastic to hold them down like a spine. It can break with carelessness. Fortunately, I treat every purchase I make with the greatest possible care; I've only had one instance of bad packaging truly ruin the watchability of a disc. Other than that, when all this is packed up together, everything feels nice and secure and looks great on a shelf.

Seasons 1-6 are about 4 discs each, while Season 7 and 8 are 3 discs (surely to reflect the dwindling down of the ; there is also a bonus disc hiding in its own sleeve in the cardboard cover. Overall, I feel as if I got one of my favorite shows in a nice solid packaging for a great price. Just be sure if you do order it, order it through a place like Amazon. They packed mine up nicely in a shrinkwrap-cardboard holder in the delivery package. Any third party sellers are risky, for they could ship it cheaply and risk it getting damaged in packaging in transit.

I give it a 5/5 (the slight book-style format is the worst this set suffers, but is manageable and not worth a whole star being taken away). This show is truly great. If you're a fan of character-driven shows, mysteries, comedy, and pineapples, you'll enjoy this.",1452211200,,2933,4.48876404494382
6505606,3,B00LTO33JQ,"It's... Psych, what's not great about it?

The show is amazing, but I disliked the packaging. The discs overlap each other, and I had a disc that got stuck in between the plastic catches that hold the discs in place, and had to physically break the plastic catch to take the disc out. I removed all the discs from the casing and stuck them in a binder. The discs were good, I just didn't like the case.",1452211200,,402,4.220779220779221

6505608,5,B00LTO33JQ,I read reviews before purchasing this item and even though i had high hopes of getting a perfect item I knew that with all of the reviews of scratches and cracks it was  very unlikely. My green outer dvd case was cracked (very minuscule compared to the ones I saw other people had) and Ive gotten to season 3 and only 1 disc so far has been scratched causing an episode to skip about a 5 minute piece of the show...had I shelled out the original price of $200 I would not be a happy camper but for $50 this was a steal! And I don't regret my purchase at all! If you are a big fan of psych its a great purchase!,1451779200,,610,3.959349593495935

6505618,5,B00LTO33JQ,"All should know that I worship and adore this show far above most shows (okay all shows and I'm a hard core fan of several popular shows of current and past). I'm still not over the fact that it's ended, and to think I almost missed out on this amazing show.

When Pysch first came out and they started running clips/commercials for it on USA I thought it sounded like it would be dumb and corny. Who wanted to watch a show about a fake psychic? Not I. If I was watching that channel I would spend my valuable time on Monk (another classic in my book) and Burn Notice. So come some time during 2009 (season 3) I was looking for something to watch on cable (over 200+ channels and nothing to watch, amirite?) they were having a Psych marathon so I flipped to it just to have something on the tv, background noise. Dude was I wrong! I dropped into the middle of the episode (I even remember which one it was, Any Given Friday Night at 10pm, 9pm Central) and wondered why in the world haven't I been watching this show from the start! It was so funny and well written that I was instantly hooked. I ran across the house to find my mom (who also shared my previous view on it being stupid) to rave how wrong we were about Psych. We watched the next episode in the marathon and laughed like crazy. Needless to say we binged watched like madwomen to catch up before the premiere of season 4 just a couple weeks. We were officially Psych-Os who lived for every episode for then on.

After the show ended we understandably had heavy hearts and tears in our eyes after the Psych After Pshow; it really was too soon! So we drowned our sorrow in Psych merch, 2 t-shirts each and matching lanyards. At one point we had basically every episode on the DVR (lol that 99 episode marathon before the 100th Clue themed episode was not good for DVR space), cause anytime is a good time for Psych. You already know I had to have the complete series; so I checked Amazon for weeks waiting to put in my pre-order. I paid almost $23 more than it is priced now and I regret NOTHING!

I give this set 5 stars for content, I mean it has everything including the musical and the after show. But technically it should be 4 because honestly the packaging is not ideal. Mainly the green plastic casing (which if dropped would shatter) could use a way to close because you are bound to drop the discs out as I have a couple times. I remedy this by laying it with the opening facing up which ruins aesthetics but hey it works. Also once you take the giant disc sleeve out you'd do best to lay it on a flat surface to not rip anything. All that aside, I love and cherish it and think everyone should give this show a chance and fall in love! So don't be the American adaptation of the British Gus and convert to Psychoism, we have quatro queso dos fritos!",1447718400,11,2822,4.251396648044692

Love the case, which is pretty sturdy andy highlighter yellow, which is perfect for the Psych name.  I read many other comments about how poor quality the case and dvd's were and they must have improved as what I received would be no different than purchasing off the shelves at a local store.  All dvds are in good quality to the eye and none are missing.  Will take some time to go through them all to verify that each one is what it says it is, but so far, it looks great!  If you can get this on sale (I managed to purchase it for $68.99), then this is definitely worth it!

Sadly, three discs so far have significant scratches that cause the show to stop or skip entire sections.

At first I tolerated these attempts at humor despite their puerile content. Eventually they became too tiresome and distracting to continue watching. I was able to get through three seasons but could go no further.

6505680,3,B00LTO33JQ,"Great series, but everyone here has already covered that subject pretty thoroughly already. Some things I don't see mentioned much or at all are...

Picture quality is surprisingly poor. I know that DVDs don't look so great anymore with all our fancy HDTVs, but this looked even more noticeably grainy than other DVDs on my set. Watchable, but pretty disappointing.

Also of note: These discs would not play at all on an Xbox One or Xbox 360 for some reason. Neither would recognize them as valid discs at all. Never had this problem on either system before. Had to put them in an old standard DVD player to play them.

For those reasons I'm just giving this a 3. Very amusing show, but as a product it's a bit shoddy. Not exactly any good alternative out there if you want to actually own the discs though are there?

It is basically put together like a book. You open it up by sliding it out of see through (yellowish) case and then you can flip through it by turning each ""page"" of disc like a book. It is one unit. I watched all 8 seasons in under 10 days. Yes I do not have a life! Lol James Roday and Dule' Hill are the perfect duo. The rest of the cast compliments the duo perfectly. This box set will have you laughing till you ache. It has awesome bonus features.  I was so sad when it came to an end but it ended perfectly.

This DVD boxset was the perfect Christmas present (bought on Christmas) to myself.  It came promptly on the date they told me it would.  Unlike some other reviewers my set was undamaged, but the plastic used to make the housing seems a little thin/breakable.  The only thing I wish they included in the box set extras was the silly promos they ran on USA and maybe the webisodes from the first season, but I really shouldn't complain -- there were so many deleted/extended scenes, psychouts, commentaries and other goodies that give a Psych re-watcher more insight into what goes into each episode.

Just a note - the musical (finale of season 7 which chronologically should be watched before Deez Nups in season 7) is actually paired up with the finale episode of season 8 on the very last disc in case you're looking for it.",1421193600,4,930,4.640243902439025

The note that came with the DVD set said to contact if there is any problems, or ur not satisfied. An so far I've watched the first three seasons an I'm only having trouble with one disc but only trying to play one episode. Might be my xbox360 I will see about trying to maybe replace it some how.

While it does contain a couple extras, such as the Psych After Pshow, I was hoping for more. If you already own the season DVDs, you will have very little reason to purchase this, as they just took the same DVDs used in the individual season sets and put them in a large singular product.

6505837,2,B00LTO33JQ,"In attempting to comply with Amazon's product review policy, I am submitting a new review for this product. This wonderfully crafted box set is contained in a creatively and artistically etched plastic casing. The asymmetry and Jackson Pollack-esque randomness of the scuffs really conveyed the sheer off-the-wall nature of the hi-jinks of psychic sleuth Shawn Spencer. The duplicate disc found in the Season 4 section is a lovely foreshadow to the Season 8 remake episode of Season 1's ""Cloudy...With a Chance of Murder,"" while the missing disc which the duplicate replaced left much to be desired (much like the remade episode).It enjoyed it so much, I had ask Amazon for a second copy of this box set. However, I soon found that I was unable to load one of the discs. This was probably due to Shawn's sharp senses, Gus's sharp business acumen, Henry's sharp fishing hooks, Karen's sharp glares, Jules' sharp fashion sense, and/or Lassie's sharp body angles scratching the disc. Unfortunately, due to all these reasons, I am unsatisfied with the product itself and hope that there is a way that a more mundane but practical and functional version of this product can be sent to me in the near future.",1414108800,36,1202,4.926108374384237

Not that it matters to a grown ass man like me, but there are few good clean shows like this anymore. Shawn and Gus probably make the best comedy team of this generation, but the entire cast is awesome. I've never watched a show where there wasn't at least one character I couldn't stand, but I love them all when it comes to Psych! This show is so incredibly underrated. My wife and I even took a vacation to Vancouver and White Rock where the show was filmed. Normally we are rather normal and wouldn't think of going on a pilgrimage for a TV show, but we loved it so much we wanted to see it firsthand. My only regret is not going while they were still filming.

Now here is where I am disappointed. First of all, they are DVD....why the heck not Blu-ray?!?! Second, the box set is rather disappointing for a ""limited edition."" It's pretty cheap and I expected a lot more....like a lock of Gus' hair...or an autographed churro wrapper.. Granted I am comparing this to my Dexter and Breaking Bad box sets. Now those are cool!! Nevertheless, I would buy it again and probably pay five times as much....I love this damn show and I am literally sad it's over.",1413158400,20,1301,4.398340248962656

Two season I really did not like that much.  Seemed to loose focus.  Maybe it was for the fact it had been off for such a long time in-between.  But, I got this set today.  Looks great.  Has an 80s look.  The discs seem good.  Three or four have makes.  But not deep scratches.  The way they have the DVDs is great.  Just put in the cases and over another disc.  Not laying on top.  But, it is good.

All that being said, I almost gave this set a 3.  Why you ask?  I picked up my case, to take a picture to put on my Facebook and it was freaking cracked.  A small piece of the plastic is on my desk.  I did not drop it or push hard on it.  The only thing I can think is that it is made amazing cheap.  I will be exchanging mine.  So, if you get this, be careful.

Update:
I did not realize this yesterday.  But, the front cover of the set, it has a DVD in it.  LOL  It is the Psych after show.  It had some marks on it.  It is just slid into a sleeve.  I hate when companies do that.  I will put a video on here tomorrow.  Maybe I should do it now.

I just did the video.  I am sorry if I ramble.  I had a brain injury in 03 and really have not talked to anyone other than my family.  haha  For all I know I should like a turtle.  Do turtles make sounds?  You know, I've never heard a turtle talk.  Now I am intrigued.",1412640000,45,1706,4.755172413793104
6505844,5,B00LTO33JQ,"To be honest, I do not watch any TV shows. Like, ANY. I am going through hard times in life right now, my dad is not going to live as long as he should, and I am always either working or sleeping. One day, however, my best friend was going through Netflix with me, and let me borrow his account to watch movies when we are bored. He showed me the pilot for this show, and for the first time since I was 10, I actually enjoyed a TV show. The first episode was so funny, clever, and engaging that I got really addicted to it. Now, amiss all the things going on around me, I must say that this show puts a lot of light into my nights. It truly is my favorite thing to do and watch a few episodes before going to bed, because I would always be smiling while going to sleep. Not only is the show good hearted and funny though, don't get me wrong; it's still a good detective show in that category. I'm on Season 3, and it's my thing where I would guess the murderer/cause of trouble in the first 10 minutes of the episode, and dang, I would ALWAYS be wrong. This show is definitely a show for all to watch, laugh, and enjoy. I also praise James Roday and Dule Hill for their fantastic chemistry on screen.",1409961600,81,1200,4.067510548523207
8667966,5,B00LTO33JQ,"Note that most of these reviews are NOT for the recent 2018 Complete Collection release, but for the older 2014 Complete Series, which had the clear green case. The difference in edition is that the 2014 version contains only the 119 regular TV episodes (the series) while the 2018 version has the 119 episodes, plus 2014s The Musical and 2017s The Movie. Unfortunately, there were a large number of bootleg copies of the 2014 SERIES boxset on the market, with poor packaging (replacing the hard-plastic green cover with a flimsy slipcase) and video quality, which accounts for most if not all of the bad reviews shown here.

Considering the price they really could invest in proper coverage. The whole thing looks like it's pirate copied considering it's supposed to be serious.

It may just be that it's the SD resolution of DVD, but there might be a little extra compression at play as well.  It's still all the episodes of one of the funniest series IMO ever though, on par with Monk but in a partly different style. For the right price you can't go wrong.
