8464136,4,B005BQTUSQ,"First let me say that I purchased this movie as a fan of Sabrina Bryan. I knew that I was going to enjoy seeing her in this film, and I was not disappointed. Her performance was clearly the highlight for me, but I thought the movie was cute, and the other actors were very enjoyable also. It's obvious that it's not a high budget blockbuster extravaganza, but it was fun, and a good family friendly, feel good movie about the joys and pitfalls of trying to help people who may not want, or need it :)",1318809600,,500,4.21875
8464137,4,B005BQTUSQ,"The movie Help me help you was so hilarious. The characters are delightful specially Ravi ,the indian doctor. He comes across as someone that we all may encounter,a busybody,managing and interfering  with other people's lives,always with good intentions.
A movie worth watching .As a Steeler fan it was nice to see the great Franco Harris in it.",1318204800,,345,5.052631578947368
8464138,5,B005BQTUSQ,"I bought the movie because I've admired Sabrina Bryan for years.  I laughed so many times while watching her in this film.  In fact, all of the actors were very good and believable.  I love to support independent films and music and watching the efforts of this creative team reaffirmed my desire to see more.

Congratulations Dr. Ravi, cast and crew.",1317600000,,351,4.704918032786885
8464139,5,B005BQTUSQ,"This is a delightful film with likable characters and a witty story line!  Dr. Ravi is charming in the lead role, surrounded by a constellation of stars including Richard Kind, Steve Guttenberg, Sabrina Bryan and Rondell Sheriden.  Together they are the ingredients to a delicious stew of confusion and misunderstanding, leaving you satisfied with the valuable lesson learned. The humor of this film is sweet and understated compared to the sometimes overbearing, base comedies in theaters now.  It is entertaining and appropriate for the entire family.  You will want to own it and share it with your friends.  Bravo, Dr. Ravi!  I can't wait for your next film!",1315872000,5,662,5.083333333333333
8464140,5,B005BQTUSQ,"This movie is definately the best of the 3 movies that Dr. Godse has written, directed, and starred in. The humor and plot of the movie is something that most movies do not capture. Dr. Godse is very talented and was able to make us all laugh through the entire movie. Also, being able to measure up to the well known actors is something hard to accomplish and Dr. Godse rose to the occasion. Everyone, this movie is a must see!",1315526400,2,428,4.296296296296297
