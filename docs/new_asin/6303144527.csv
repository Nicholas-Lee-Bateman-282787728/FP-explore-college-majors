571725,5,6303144527,"Kids age 2 up will watch this over and over.  My son is 3 and has been watching the whole line of ""There goes a"" videos over for a year with no signs things will change soon.  What did he ask Santa for?  A new ""There goes a"" video!  We now own 6 and have rented all the others multiple times.  Forget all the PC people who say Dave and Becky sometimes aren't PC enough - it's all obviously in fun and won't even be noticed by your kids much less affect them in any way.",1010361600,2,469,3.84375
571726,1,6303144527,"All I ask of the irritating, condescending ""Dave""  character is that he not hog center stage ALL the time. In ""There Goes A Bulldozer,"" he stays out of  the way well enough that I could suffer  him through 60-odd (and counting, sigh...) viewings.
NOT the case in this  one -- even my 3 year-old couldn't watch it more than two or three times,  (thank goodness!)",959558400,4,361,4.492307692307692

7839093,5,6303144527,"This entire ""There goes..."" series is a wonderful learning tool that captivates my Grandson's interest.  Very well done and teaches new vocabulary and in-depth subject learning.  I believe we have all the tapes, Firetruck, Helicopter, Monster Truck, etc.  They will sit for the entire video capitvated at age three!!!!",1358208000,,318,5.448979591836735
7839094,5,6303144527,"Fun and informative.  A little goofy sometimes, but hey, it's for KIDS!  My son, wife, and I watch it all the time.  We have had the video for 2 years and (like all the Dave shows)we still love it.  You won't regret buying it...fun, fun, fun.",1194134400,,242,4.195652173913044
7839095,1,6303144527,"I hate that we own this video!! Of all the ""There Goes a..."" videos, this one is ALL FLUFF!! I love the concept of these videos but was really dissappionted in this one: Dave and Becky are particularly annoying with their futile attempts at humor in very un-funny fiascos that even my kids were bored with- and they LOVE these videos!! Do your family a favor, and skip this one, but get others that ARE GREAT: Dumptrucks, Tractors, Bulldozers and Trains, to name a few. ENJOY!!",1066780800,6,477,4.558139534883721
7839096,5,6303144527,"Deputy Dave and Deputy Becky are at their charming, goofy best as they explore the world of police vehicles and equipment, including cars, helicopters, boats, bikes, horses, radios and body equipment.  They also spend some time with a K-9 unit and get locked in a jail cell.  The usual antics are funny and not as perilous as is sometimes the case in the series.  Kids love these videos and it won't drive the adults crazy.",1036627200,5,423,4.613333333333333
7839097,5,6303144527,"The show is hosted by Becky and Dave, who pretend they are police officers as they host this show. As usual, they continue with their goofy antics, doing things wrong because they don't follow directions as explained, they get into trouble, etc. All the while they introduce us to various police officers in different settings and situations. They ask the officers questions about their jobs and the officers answer them in a manner that is not condescending or patronizing to children.
We visit a testing facility for police cars, police using cars, motorcycles, horses, and bicycles. We take a ride on a police helicopter and on a police boat. Various equipment is demonstrated such as surveillance tracking equipment on the helicopter and boat. We even meet a police dog and Dave and Becky end up locked inside a jail cell by accident. The use of police guns is briefly mentioned and explained they are used for emergency purposes only. Lastly, we learn what happens when someone dials ""911"".
Both my children love this video and others in the series. I highly recommend this police car video and other videos in this series for their good sound and video quality, accurate information, and interesting subject matter.  If your child is interested in the chosen subject (police car, trains, etc.) then they will love the video!",1025827200,11,1330,4.9375
