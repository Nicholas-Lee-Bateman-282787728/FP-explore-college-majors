8092572,5,B000BTP2NK,"They are gathering fire wood already? Day of Wrath is an interesting and old school black-and-white film, made in 1943, by Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer. To start off, this film the equivalent of a cinematic test of endurance. It pulls you and in and won't let go until you have experienced it to the bitter end.
This is not happy film, its a film about life. Some crazy things happen and
Dreyer knows how to make you think about it. In Day of Wrath a lady named Herlof's Marte is denounced a witch. Why? We don't really know and honestly it doesn't matter. All we know is that she has been accused and her time is limited.
She tries to run from her fiery destiny, but she does not get far. They find her and prep her for a controversial closure.
The running, hiding, and fear portrayed in this film could be viewed as allegory for the horrors of war.
Now that Herlof's Marte faces serious persecution, she attempts to talk her way out of the situation.
Her negotiating doesn't hold up. She is essentially forced to confess her allegiance to witchcraft through torture.
Through this uncomfortable mayhem, it's revealed that the mother of the head clergy man's wife was also a witchcraft suspect that was let off.
The head clergy man's name is Absalon Pederssn. This is some really important information that brings up some serious questions.
Absalon's wife is a very young lady named Anne. Anne is a peculiar lady and compromises
her marriage through finding refuge within the arms of Absalon's son, Martin. They know it's wrong, but
attraction has a way of confusing things in this world. This triangle of discomfort reaches a fever pitch and the family
will certainly never be the same.  Day of Wrath is a 17th century tale of witchcraft, betrayal, and deceit.  Does pure evil exist in this world?
Watch this film and that question might cross your mind.",1385683200,,1862,4.656534954407295
8092573,5,B000BTP2NK,"The bells are tolling to wake up the town that a witch is being hunted down.  Herlofs Marte, an old herbal healer, learns that she is the prey, she is the one, and she slips out a door to desperately seek shelter. But she won't escape.

To whom does she turn?  She goes to Absalon Pedersson, a respected pastor and village elder of the town who once before saved a woman accused of witchcraft. That time he did so in order to seize as his wife the teenage beautiful daughter of the accused.  Herlofs Marte has nothing to offer but a threat of exposure for the minister's indiscretion.  He does not protect the old woman.  The horrible pain of torture compels her to gasp ""yes"" to anything the village elders ask her to admit - no matter how ridiculous. ""It is a good confession"", one satisfied elder remarks. So she is sentenced to be burned alive.  This is the fate she fears more than Heaven or Hell. The minister approaches - like a shadow or even a vampire  - past a black cross. He tells Herlofs Marte ""I have come to prepare you for death.""

The elders and the town folk gather to watch the burning of flesh, almost like a holy celebration.  Another elder of the Lutheran church is leading the choir boys to sing at the event.  As the ecstasy of music is perverted so are the morals of society twisted in assumed service to God.  We hear the excited crowd anxious to experience the spectacle.  One elder, in dissent, refuses to watch and leaves. But all the other village elders remain, including Absalon Pedersson.  After the innocent old woman expires in torment, he writes in balanced handwriting, gorgeous penmanship, ""ON THIS BEAUTEOUS DAY, HERLOFS MARTE WAS SUCCESSFULLY BURNED AS A WITCH. GLORY BE TO GOD.

I can't think of any other film that better illustrates the appalling self-righteousness of men who murder in the name of their chosen ideology.  In every respect the film is timeless ... even though it plays out ostensibly during 1623 in Northern Europe.  Astonishingly the film was actually made when Denmark was under the Nazi boot...and likely Jews and Resistance Fighters were hunted down with the same efficiency and self-righteousness.

However this film is not only about Herlofs Marte but about the family of the minister. At first we believe his young wife (Anne) is humble and courteous. But underneath her skin, she burns with carnal desire which cannot be satisfied by a husband nearly 50 years older than she is. The unfriendly, plain faced mother of Abasalon Pedersson considers her son's lustful marriage to such a pretty young girl to be a scandalous thing and the mother further resents and resists any threat to her personal domination of the household or of her son.

Call it inevitable.  When her husband's son Martin (the offspring from an earlier marriage) returns to the home, Anne sees a man who is  nearly her age, handsome, interesting, and virile. He is the type of man a young girl would long for in her dreams....and she admits as much.  Anne seizes the opportunity to seduce Martin so she can taste joy and sex and a sensation of being alive. Like a gorgeous plant, she flowers.  ""Hold me, make me happy"" she tells her men.  Short lived.  Eventually she confesses the affair to her husband and, when pressed, tells him that she secretly wishes he would die.  The shock of learning about his wife's adultery, her incest, and the shock wave of her explosion of repressed feeling causes a stroke, then death.  To be expected, the terrifying forces of this oppressive society will attack Anne like a black storm.

One of the important aspects of this masterpiece is that every major character has strengths and flaws...and that the film can be interpreted quite a few ways.  When Anne causes her husband to die, she starts to wonder whether she - indeed - has the power to control the life and death of individuals...as a witch might.  Her mother was said to possess this power. Those who practice voodoo today profess to own this power.

This story could have been told by anyone...but in the hands of an artist like Carl Theodore Dreyer he creates an experience of drowning, a struggle to breathe just above the waters of a warped, nasty society.  Not a scene is wasted. The actresses dominate the screen among the straitlaced men. More than that, the movie is beautifully framed like a Rembrandt painting where the characters move just a little and then a little more.  No director has greater ability to tell a story with so little movement. A haunting gesture. A telling laugh. An enigmatic glance. The austere black and white cinematography is essential because it corresponds exactly to the starkness of a religious culture where happiness is sin and even the dress code is just about pure black.  At the beginning of the film, Herlofs Marte tells her patient that the herbs she has collected have come from under the gallows.  She reflects ""There is power in evil.""  The purpose of Carl Dreyers' film is to force us to confront this and prove the opposite....""there is power in good.""  But that must need wait for another day, not the Day of Wrath.",1378944000,,5103,4.686868686868687
8092574,5,B000BTP2NK,"This movie is a masterpiece.  It is very hard to watch because it is so terrible (in the true sense), but once seen as a whole it is clearly close to perfect.  The ending is a complete surprise, but perfectly apropos.  I already owned it; I bought this copy for a gift.  It screams out to be an opera.  Maybe someday.",1361577600,2,317,4.131147540983607
8092575,5,B000BTP2NK,"This is a little known gem of a movie.  It is English subtitled and was made in the 40's.  It depicts a German pastor who is married to a much younger wife.  He condemns to death by burning an old woman accused of witchcraft.  This horrible event draws the Pastor's son and the young wife to become more closely together and ultimately have an affair.

The acting, even with subtitles, is outstanding.  One is able to sense the dread of  old woman awaiting her horrible manner of death; the longings of a young wife trapped in a loveless marriage; the guilt of the son who is harming his father; and the anguish of the Pastor himself, who is torn between his faith and feelings.

Don't pass this one up because of the subtitles.",1322611200,3,728,4.421052631578948
8092576,5,B000BTP2NK,"I LOVE this movie. Saw it one night on TCM and it has been haunting me ever since, especially when I forgot the name of the title and the director. I've been searching in vain over a year for it, when lo and behold, chance had me finding it at the top of someone's movie list on IMDB. Finally!

This is a historical piece, and it pits the faulty human behaviors of lust and longing against society's cruel backlashes, in this case, witch-burning. From the very moment you see the young wife meet her new step-son, you KNOW they will be getting it on at some point. The white hot chemistry is undeniable and each character's personal unhappinesses with their lives just exascerbates the inevitable. The characters of the old rector husband and his shrewish judgmental mother are very well acted with surprising depth. The old man wrestles often with his conscience and the skeletons in his closet, as if to tell us that he is guilty of plenty as well. His mother is so rigid in her high horsiness that she might have condemned Jesus himself of some petty oversight. Your heart and sympathy go with the young wife, if not also for the son (whom did not get all my sympathies, I found him to be a bit of a jerk). One of my favorite scenes is a dreamlike scene at the water as the lovers have a canoe ride. The cinematography is gorgeous and lyrical. Be prepared for a very disturbing last part of the movie, because that's where Dreyer sets up his preaching and message about the mob mentality and the damage of condemnation. Many movies made since have tried to portray the same types of themes, but this one is one of the most effective. Definitely a CLASSIC and not to be missed.

Just so I do not EVER forget the title or the director again, I just snapped up a dvd copy of this baby here at Amazon for a cool $12.99, and will be reliving my pleasure repeatedly in a few days. Highly Recommended!",1312761600,2,1897,4.401709401709402
8092577,5,B000BTP2NK,A classic not to be missed is ofered at a great price. Carl Dreyer was a master and this film while entrancing is also worthy of a class on how we  live and how to make a film.,1240963200,,176,3.6315789473684212
8092578,4,B000BTP2NK,"Carl Theodor Dreyer's 1943 film Day Of Wrath (Vredens dag), adapted from Hans Wiers-Jenssens' novel, Day Of Wrath, by Dreyer, is an earlier, better version of the issues tackled in Arthur Miller's play, The Crucible, because, even though the film was made during the Nazi occupation of Denmark, and there are obvious parallels to be drawn between that and the film's narrative, it is never as psychologically obvious nor melodramatic as Miller's later allegory on McCarthyism. This is never made more clear than at the film's end, where the psychologically fragile Anne (Lisbeth Movin) is betrayed by her horrid mother-in-law, her lover, and her own psyche, and actually comes to believe in her own guilt of being a witch, for wishing the death of her aged husband.
  The whole film is also a more realistic depiction of self-delusion than Miller's play, as the 17th Century Danish Inquisitors who torture, maim, and kill in the name of their beliefs show how easily good intentions can become twisted. Anne is clearly the central figure, and her rise and fall, from shy dour hausfrau of old Reverend Absalon Pedersson (Thorkild Roose), to energetic vibrant lover of his son, Martin (Preben Lerdorff Rye), who is about the same age as her, and returns to the home after years abroad, to denounced, deluded, and subservient victim of her wicked mother-in-law, Merete (Sigrid Neiiendam), is the center of the film's drama and emotion.
  Day Of Wrath is one of the most masterful black and white films ever made, and the use of shadow by Dreyer and cinematographer Karl Andersson is stunning. Only other Dreyer films come close to being as effective in the use of such as this film is.... Day Of Wrath is one of those films that is possibly difficult to judge by modern standards, yet if it is not clearly a great film, the way his earlier Vampyr is, it's only because it is not a genre work, like that film, and thus not subject to a more delimited horizon. In many ways, these same issues would be tackled a decade and a half later, in Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal, a more modern and complex work, yet one which never quite hits the visceral peaks this film does. And, comparisons to other great works of art are never to be dismissed lightly. Neither is Day Of Wrath.",1221004800,4,2272,4.744303797468355
8092579,5,B000BTP2NK,"To affirm Carl Dryer was a supreme genius of the Cinema is perhaps to be too niggard. To watch anyone of his works equals to participate in a feast for the eyes.

The shot angles, wondrous traveling, magisterial illumination, superb artistic framework, unequaled close ups, and the solid script are some of the countless virtues you will enjoy in this sidereal movie.

Day of Wrath is an unmerciful testimonial about the degradation levels, the nasty human soul may achieve: Anna is the unhappy married woman of a seriously wounded minded clerk, whose perversity simply does not know about scruples or ethic barriers. Since he has overlooked  the general claim about a woman whom supposedly was considered a which (Anna' s mother), he avails this moral blackmail to literally to steal the youth and the dreams of a very young child who might well be his own child. On the other hand, this infamous clerk lives with his poisoned mind, spirit and soul mother, of repressive profile and severe discipline. An old woman has been accused of practicing witchcraft, and eventually she dares to face the clerk, trying to save her life, she threats him with revealing the truth;  but being ineffective her proposal, will be staked and just before she dies,  she will curse him, fervently wishing and begging Anne be the protagonist of his perdition. He has another son, barely older than his wife, who eventually will seduce her, provoking a drama of majuscule proportions.

Double moral, peerless hypocrisy, nasty behavior and a horrid finale will make of this emblematic film a genuine gem of the world cinematography. As matter of fact, two of my selected twenty best films in any age include two works of Dreyer: Day of Wrath and The process of Joan de Arc.

There is no any minor argument for you or any viewer around the world, to miss this universal jewel of the Cinema.

If I could give this film one thousand stars, I would do it without a bit of hesitation.",1152835200,13,1958,4.772189349112426
