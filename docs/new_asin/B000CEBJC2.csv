2460247,3,B000CEBJC2,Jack Aranson turns in a brilliant performance in this taped version of a well staged one-man-show. His artistic sensibilities are inspired. The way he segues from character to character in Melville's masterpiece demonstrates a flexibility of talent rarely found on screen or stage. Having said that it is important for the consumer to know that the production of the DVD is somewhat problematic. There is no menu for scene selections. Once the performance commences the only way to switch scenes is to skip from chapter to chapter manually. The viewer will then discover that although 33 chapters of material are listed there are actually only 25. Oddly enough chapter 25 has only one sentence of content. For some strange reason this disc plays on most computers and DVD players but not all of them. I have never encountered a more frustrating combination of post-production idiosyncrasies on any DVD I have ever purchased.,1208044800,9,924,5.0855263157894735
2460248,5,B000CEBJC2,"Absolutely loved it! Great acting, extremely educational, great for the family and for actors that want to polish their skills. Two thumbs UP and 5 stars!",1141689600,4,154,4.961538461538462
2460249,4,B000CEBJC2,"This is not a movie version of Herman Melville's MOBY DICK; it is a single actor on a stage, in front of an audience, playing all roles.  You might think this wouldn't be enjoyable, but for a mature viewer seeking to squeeze the essence out of the book, this is quite worth while.  The actor is brilliant, shifting characters in a blink.  One deeply experiences the personalities of the main characters, especially Ahab; you can feel the mad rage pouring forth from Ahab.",1139184000,12,471,4.650602409638554
2460250,4,B000CEBJC2,"Captain Ahab as done by Jack Aranson may be the finest Ahab ever put to film. Jack captures Herman Melville's  blank verse. This is a DVD you will watch over and over for the insights contained in MOBY DICK.This is not a sea story- this is the classic story of where pride and arrogance will lead you. The tail is biblical in scope. This is a DVD for the family collection. This is a chance to see some great acting!!
IMDB ranks Jack's solo performance as the 2nd highest  rated version of MOBY DICK only behind John Houston's 1956 movie.",1135641600,9,538,4.37

8098147,1,B000CEBJC2,"I was not reading the fine print when I picked this out.  This is a one person show of an actor reading selections from Moby Dick.  I watched only a little of it, and was not motivated to watch the rest.",1405987200,,203,3.926829268292683
8098148,1,B000CEBJC2,"Like others said before, nowhere in the description it says that this a one man play and not a movie.
Extremely disappointed.

Want my money back!",1399248000,,146,4.615384615384615
8098149,1,B000CEBJC2,Don't waste your money. This isn't a movie.. It's a play filmed with a home video camera. I want my money back!,1379980800,2,111,4.090909090909091
8098150,1,B000CEBJC2,This is total garbage not worth 1 dollar let alone 9.99 . Very miss leading gives you a list of stars and says the best version of Moby Dick ever done . Instead you get one actor doing a play some how they forget to tell you this.,1368489600,3,230,3.8125
8098151,5,B000CEBJC2,"Okay so I collect things related to Moby Dick. I wish I'd taken that offer and had my meds adjusted. I should have known when I saw the dreaded word 'dramatization'. It was brilliant as long as I kept my eyes closed or a towel over the DVD screen. Mr. Aranson moves around quite a bit! Still and all at the end of the day,it was very good. I accidentally bought 2 of them so my best friend is getting one for her birthday.",1318291200,2,422,4.035714285714286
8098152,4,B000CEBJC2,"I was rather surprised when I put the dvd in my player.  I was expecting a movie.similar to the Gregory Peck,Patrick Stewart, and William Hurt vehicles.  Instead it was a stage performance and a good one it was. I found myself absorbed in the characters played by one actor. I was pleased that I bought it.",1318118400,,306,4.446428571428571
8098153,2,B000CEBJC2,"It wasn't what I thought it was so I was dissapointed. I thought it was a newer version of the movie, but it was a one man show. I didn't care for it.",1285891200,,150,3.5757575757575757
