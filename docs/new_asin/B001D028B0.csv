8290577,1,B001D028B0,"In spite of it being marked as digitally remastered, these videos were out of focus and unwatchable. It looked like it was coming over an old 1960's TV with bad rabbit ears.",1276300800,3,173,4.4375
8290578,1,B001D028B0,"The discs were very poor quality. Either a drunk or a 5 year old must have made them. Most of the discs got stuck and others had too much sound static. When I complained they could not or would not replace them, but I did get my money back. The episodes I could watch were very good.",1265587200,4,283,3.982456140350877
8290579,1,B001D028B0,"Some episodes are almost not viewable, This is advertised as having been digitally remastered.  This has not been digitally remastered!!! It has not even been analog cleaned up. You must be a real die-hard Adventures in Paradise fan to reap any enjoyment out of watching these bad recordings.  I would gladly pay twice the price to see a DVD that was as good as what I watched as a kid on black and white TV, with rabbit ears antennae.",1229904000,8,435,4.493670886075949
8290580,2,B001D028B0,"I agree completely with previous reviewer. This was a great series starring Gardner MacKay and everybody loved the boat, the Tiki. But obviously these are home-made bootlegs of the fifteenth generation transfer. Pretty much unwatchable because of terrible picture quality. And my set had scene set-up buttons that did not work. DVDs always started out at the beginning. Does anyone have a good set out there???Better yet, how about a studio release ""Best of...""???? Come on,  where's Dominick Dunne when you really need him!",1228953600,8,524,5.238095238095238
8290581,1,B001D028B0,"""Let the buyer beware"" should apply to this product, because the quality of the videos are grossly subpar, even for B and W TV from that era. Other TV shows like Paladin, Maverick, etc. are also in B and W, but sharp and easily watchable. This 1st set of 'Adventures in Paradise"" is anything but watchable, and potential buyers need to be aware of that. While it has been advertised here as 'digitally remastered"", the quality suggests amateurs did the work. Based on this first set's abysmal quality, @ $30.00 a pop, I will not be purchasing the second and third seasons.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adventures-In-Paradise-Gardner-McKay-8-DVD-Interactive-Menus-Volume-1/dp/B001D028B0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adventures In Paradise-Gardner McKay-8 DVD-Interactive Menus-Volume 1</a>",1222473600,24,826,6.45045045045045
