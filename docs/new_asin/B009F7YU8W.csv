5323947,5,B009F7YU8W,"Many of the productions at the Rossini Opera Festival in recent years have been provocative in nature and this performance of Mose in Egitto is no exception.  In fact it was probably the most scandalous of all.  I recall hearing the audio of this production as broadcast by the BBC and definitely noted some booing and hissing from the audience. Not having the benefit of seeing the visual aspects of the presentation, I was perplexed until I later realized that a certain segment of the audience was reacting not to the singing, but rather to the controversial nature of the staging where for starters Moses is depicted as a clone of Osama Bin Laden... with the staging of the opera's final moments being quite thought provoking. In any event, I recommend viewing the bonus feature regarding the stage director's thoughts prior to viewing the opera proper.  Still all concerned are so committed to the concept that everything somehow falls into place... which fact is in no small part due to the universal yet impersonal and detached nature of Rossini's style, which is able to transcend any variety of approaches.  In summary, it is Rossini's genius (from the opening section which is reminiscent of Bach's A Minor Two-Part Invention, through the plagues, the powerful prayer, and the catastrophic denouement) that proves to be the underlying force that powerfully propels the action forward.

At any rate, it is the musical aspects that are most important in Bel Canto opera and in this regard this Pesaro production certainly delivers the goods.  There are several variants to the Italian version of Rossini's biblical opera.  These include an aria for Faraone by Rossini's friend Michele Carafa, an aria for Mose by an unknown composer, and an aria for Amaltea culled from Rossini's earlier opera Ciro in Babilonia, which Rossini later himself removed from the score after the piece's first run.  None of these variants are performed with the result that all the major musical numbers are genuine Rossini.  What is performed is the aria for Faraone that Rossini composed to replace the number originally composed by Carafa.  Without the extra materials the opera is tauter, much more coherent, and unfolds in a quite rational manner. For the record, if one wishes to hear the variants the Carafa aria is performed on the Naxos CD set, the aria by the unknown composer on the Phillips CD set, and the aria from Ciro in Babilonia on both.

The cast includes a number of Pesaro regulars and all are to the Rossinian manner born... and that includes conductor Roberto Abbado.  However, special mention must be made regarding the Elcia of Sonia Ganassi a role that was composed for Rossini's favorite prima donna and future wife Isabella Colbran.  At that stage in her career Colbran was probably more of a mezzo or low voiced soprano as opposed to a high soprano.  Consequently, the choice of Ganassi fits quite nicely into the vocal equation and gives an apt representation of how the role might have sounded as performed by Colbran.  At any rate, the choice of edition combined with the conducting and singing are of such a high order that the sweep and majesty of Rossini's conception are realized to greater effect than on any of the aforementioned recordings.  At times less is more and that is most definitely the case with this particular performance.

The sound and picture quality as experienced via the DVD version are what one has come to expect from the Rossini Opera Festival.  So unless you are taken aback by the controversial nature of the production, and I can respect the fact that many would be, this is probably as good a performance as one is likely to hear of this most interesting opera.  Given that fact and the fact that the production's concept might not wear well over the long term, I have transferred the audio portion to CD and as such it is my current Mose in Egitto of choice... even though I would not want to be without the Philips or Naxos recordings for their documentation of the textual alternatives.  Bel Canto operas are certainly open to many interpretations and at least musically speaking this presentation is as valid as any.",1359590400,15,4170,4.854724964739069
5323948,5,B009F7YU8W,"Director Graham Vick and set designer Stuart Nunn, as well as the administration team of the Pesaro Rossini Opera Festival, go to great pains in interviews on the 'Making Of' extra feature included on this release to emphasise that their 2011 production of Rossini's Mos in Egitto doesn't take sides and offers no solutions, but rather strives to present a balanced account of the impact of conflict and oppression on a population, specifically in a modern-day Middle East context. Balanced it may be, but that doesn't mean that this production plays it safe in any way. Far from it. Vick depicts Rossini's Biblical epic in terms of suicide bombers, terrorists, torture, self-immolation and - perhaps most controversially - styling Moses as an Osama Bin Laden figure, wielding a Kalashnikov and stirring up a Holy War against their oppressors through inflammatory video recordings.

Without contradicting the intent of a single word of the original libretto here, Graham Vick shows that there is a case for opera not to be entirely subservient to the words alone, but that it should also take into account an interpretation of what the music is expressing. Rossini's score isn't set in any specific period, but is abstractly aligned rather to timeless human feelings and emotions. As a director, Vick clearly wants the production of Rossini's great work to express those sentiments in a meaningful way to a modern-day audience, and the extraordinarily powerful nature of its presentation here clearly justifies that approach. There are no 'star turns' here in an opera that opens without an Overture but instead has a choral 'Plague of Darkness' lament that the director stages powerfully by having blood-stained Arabs walking through the audience, holding out photographs of friends and relatives lost in the latest bombardment/plague carried out on the word of Moses in retribution for the enslavement of the Hebrew people by the Egyptian Pharaoh, plastering the pictures and messages on walls in front of the orchestra pit. It's a meaningful image that brings the power of Rossini's writing home, and the same approach is used throughout, consistently and often to quite striking effect, the final scenes in particular making a unforgettable impression that underlines the relevance and importance of making the work say something about the world today.

I say ""orchestra pit"", but it's clear - and not just from the informal dress of the musicians - that the orchestra are also very much a part of the action, particularly in this production were the music carries much more than the libretto does alone. If there are any doubts about the efficacy of the treatment, the powerhouse performance of the Orchestra Teatro Comunale di Bologna will quickly put any doubts to rest. Directed by Roberto Abbado this is a sparkling, sensitive performance that captures the verve, rhythm and lyrical lightness of Rossini's versatile arrangements. The singers in most of the principal roles on the Egyptian side aren't heavy-weights by any means, but singers like Alex Esposito, Dmitri Korchak and Olga Senderskaya are all lyrically qualified and well-suited to the roles of Faraone, Osiride and Amaltea. There's a little more personality and weight required however for the parts of Mos and Elcia, both in terms of their vocal demands and the necessity of having the strength of personality to bring together the political and human elements that combine in the drama, and those demands are more than capably met by Riccardo Zanellato and Sonia Ganassi. Excellent and noteworthy performances from Yijie Shi (Aronne/Aaron), Enea Scala (High Priest Mambre) and Chiara Amar (Amenofi) really contribute to the overall power and quality of the work and the performance as a whole.

Set in a basketball venue rather than a typical opera house, the 2011 Pesaro Mos in Egitto isn't pretty to look at, but it's not meant to be. It does make some controversial references, but there's nothing here that can't be justified as a genuine reflection of human nature and how people live in the world today. That might not be what you expect to see in an opera performance of Moses in Egypt, but the brilliance of the production here is that it works both ways, drawing inspiration from Rossini's remarkable score, finding a meaningful modern way to bring its themes to life, while at the same time injecting its ancient Biblical story with a heavy dose of reality. It's a testimony to Rossini's brilliant writing and Andrea Leone Tottola's poetic libretto that, musically and dramatically, Mos in Egitto is more than capable of bearing it. If it's the intention of the Rossini Opera Festival to look afresh are both familiar and rarely performed works by the composer in order to reevaluate qualities and strengths that are clearly there but which have been buried under decades of operatic mannerisms, then this kind of production achieves that most impressively. Stripped right back to its expressive power, this 2011 production of Mos in Egitto is consequently something of a revelation.

As with all the recent Pesaro Rossini releases, that revelation extends to being able to see and hear these performance presented so well in High Definition on Blu-ray. Outstanding image quality in full-HD 1080/60i, detailed and beautifully toned high resolution audio mixes only enhance the efforts of the performers. Mainly due to the unconventional nature of the venue, radio mics are used, presumably only for recording purposes, but the mixing is well done and comes across naturally here. As well as a booklet that covers the production and gives a synopsis, there is a Cast Gallery and a 25-minute long behind-the-scenes 'Making Of' with interviews that explain the intentions behind the concept very well. The BD is region-free, with subtitles in English, French and German.",1357430400,6,5851,5.142857142857143
8540855,2,B009F7YU8W,"By attempting to impose the significance of contemporary history, notably the Palestinian/Israeli conflicts on Rossinis thoroughly ahistorical Mos in Egitto, Graham Vick, its director, succeeds in rendering both absurd.  Rossini is not a composer of depths.  If there is profundity to him, it is a profundity of surfaces, of a classical idealism contained in Romantic guises.  Vicks production, however, attempts to render the opera as a pondering on recent Middle
Eastern wars and conflicts.  In his peculiar, perverse understanding of Rossini, it ends with a Palestinian child suicide bomber about to blow up an Israeli soldier.  Imagine that, if you will, and try not to be horrified at the many other violences Vick brings to bear upon an opera that simply will not tolerate them.

Post-modernism has a lot to answer for in all the arts.  Perhaps, currently, it is in opera productions where it still holds, crazily, most sway.  The madness of this production is clear from the start in the incongruity of almost every detail, no part fitting in with any other or seeming to belong to the same world.  The stage is constantly active.  So is the theater itself with chorus members and others drenched in blood, carrying dead children, posting photographs of the missing on walls.  But, save for the abuse of history for the purposes of theatre, none of it makes any sense.  What are all those computers being used for?  Why are people being filmed?  What are those kitschy Egyptian statues and enamel gold throne doing there? And soon and on.  Its all a hodgepodge, a farrago, a mess.

History, especially the history that this production attempts to impose on what is a most fragile libretto, is a complex, ambiguous, and difficult record of often great cruelties.  To use those cruelties as a way of giving weight to a work that cannot bear it is to ruin the work and to violate history.  Terrorism is not what Rossinis opera is in any shape or form about.  There is something disturbingly immoral about suggesting that it is, immoral, abusive, and offensive to the very history it pretends to evoke.

The only way, I think, this opera can still live on an operatic stage today is for its presentation to be as close to its own era, the early 19th century, as possible, not to ours.  It is a strange piece, untrue to the bible, untrue to any known history anywhere, anytime, yet still possibly valid if its peculiar musical position between classicism and romanticism is observed.  It contains far too much recitative, but its best moments remain moving and frequently beautiful, though not as sung in this self-important and disastrously overburdened production.

The worst thing about post-modern productions of opera is how its directors impose their politics on a work they are in no other way responsive to.  It is the vanity of the director one has to suffer from, time after time, while the true, real creators are betrayed, here none more so, of course, than Rossini.  What one hears is so inapt for what one sees that the music becomes not deeper but seemingly more irrelevant, arbitrary, and even trivial.  And that is perhaps the worst sort of betrayal.  Rossinis serious operas are not any of those things.  But what they are and why we should pay attention to them are not easy to discern.  A truly great production would show us the way.  Where are they?",1512777600,2,3373,4.825783972125436
8540856,4,B009F7YU8W,"The music was beautiful, the orchestra was wonderful, the singers were top notch, the staging was so out-of-synch with the story. It was mostly distracting.

8540857,5,B009F7YU8W,"I WAS totally shocked, but i loved it!  Let's begin with the thorn on everybody's side: the staging.  For once ""regiatrash"" and ""Eurotrash have coalesced into an intelligent time  move.  Seen from the Palestinian/Israeli divide, this masterpiece acquires an urgent sense of the contemporary (in fact, and oddly enough--it reminded me constantly of Adams' Klingshoffer"").  I had originally bought it because i am interested in Yyjie Shi's career, but I am glad to have met other magnificent singers rarely heard or  seen in NYC,  particularly Sonia Ganassia.  I t is also rare to watch an opera with three tenors in principal roles, .  With Claudio Abbado at the helm, the musical integrity is guaranteed.",1439596800,4,704,5.105263157894737

8540859,2,B009F7YU8W,"I enjoyed this performance but am torn because of the staging and political undertones that at once detracted from the performers, the plot and has no relevance to the opera.  It goes beyond modernization.  It is using the opera to make a political statement that is irrelevant to the opera itself.

Now, the performers were terrific.  The music was likewise.  The opera, as Rossini conceived it, is not a Biblical reenactment but a love story whose background is Egypt in the time of the Exodus.  The opera does not even attempt to recreate the Biblical meaning but only uses the times and tensions upon which the virtues and faults of the main characters play out in this tragedy.  It is fiction.

The strength of the story lay in the complexity of the characters other than Moses.  Moses becomes a type, a symbol of what is looming and to become of Egypt.  The main characters are highly flawed yet sympathetic.  There is love, selfishness, power, greed, duty and destiny pressuring love.  And in this crucible, love becomes of national importance as the lives of people and fate of nations are affected by it.  Fiction but true in capturing the power of love and the flaws of people.

The bi-level staging was a great idea.  It permitted the opera to flow seamlessly from scene to scene without having to ""drop the curtain.""  However, the constant activity of the ""extras"" was a great distraction only made tolerable by the camera when pointed at the performers.  The modern scene of an imperial palace and modern ghetto could have worked if not for all the irrelevant political nonsense.  I tried to imagine the Met in its full glory having Pharaoh's palace (historically accurate and scaled) above and the small squalor (dirt floors etc) below.

Rather what we had was a weird transposition of this ""love story"" on to a modern Israeli-Palestinian conflict which is foreign to Rossini and even ancient Egypt.  It found it curious that the graffiti in this Italian-staged opera was written not in Italian but in Hebrew and English.  There were some flashes of funny graffiti such as ""Eat mo Pharaoh.""  But why in Italy?  Who was the intended audience?

The folks who staged this performance also failed to understand that Egyptians are not Arabs or Palestinians.  They are of their own ethnic identity and history that is quite different than the Palestinians.  They are yoked by a religion but not culture or history.

Also, this performance clearly depicts the Israelite slaves as terrorists co-equal with their Palestinian counterparts.  Israel did not raise as much as a finger against Egypt while enslaved.  It was God who called Israel out of Egypt and who fought for them.  The production depicts God as a weapon in the Israelite arsenal rather than as God of all who is acting to oppose evil and deliver His chosen people as part of the overall salvation of mankind from fallen depravity.  God is not an army tank as depicted here.

There is a difference between artful modernization that at once remains faithful to the composer, librettist,creates a performance that is fresh and accessible AND a misguided political statement.  This production is of the latter and it fails both in intent and in substance.  It does injustice to modern Israeli and Palestinian alike (not to mention the Egyptians), demeans God and butchers Rossini's intent.

Only the blind could not see this.  I feel sorry for the performers who sung their hearts out and were terrific.  It is a shame that their efforts are attached to this production.",1414886400,5,3536,4.852842809364549
8540860,2,B009F7YU8W,"One can only wonder what the directors of the Pesaro Festival thought they were doing when they put the stage direction of this opera in the hands of Graham Vick. The result is a ludicrous mish-mash of Islamist radicals versus modern Arabic-seeming rulers somehow vaguely related to the doings in Israel, culminating with the parting of the Red Sea being the opening of the wall separating Israel from Palestine.
That this makes a travesty of the biblical legend goes without saying, but it has no coherent purpose. Starting with the title, and proceeding through the opera, explicit and implicit stage directions are ignored. Further, the actions of Moses' followers in various parts of the stage while other material is being sung simply distracts from a good musical production. It is not as if Mose in Egitto was so widely performed that there is a need for a new approach. The emperor here has no clothes at all and a most unappealing nude body. Those who hire him for his fashion sense are to be condemned! Though Mose is a rather static opera (Rossini referred to it as his oratorio in some correspondence) this is no solution to the problem. No wonder the camera often reveals empty seats.

Musically, the production is good, as you would expect with Claudio Abbado in the pit. The singers by and large do a good job, sometimes a very good job. However, if one is thinking of getting the disc as a cd, the hitch is that there is at least one cd recording that, despite the better text used here, is musically superior to this performance. I am thinking of the 1992 set from Philips (now on Decca) led by Claudio Scimone with an outstanding cast, orchestra and chorus.",1389312000,3,1675,4.677966101694915
8540861,2,B009F7YU8W,"I have over 150 classical DVD/BRs that I watch on a 106"" screen and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6"" apart and the surround speakers are on my sides. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls. My reviews concentrate on the surround audio, as you can pretty much judge the video and stereo for yourself on youtube and similar sites.

Picture is fine, the start menu let's you chose the sound track and the subtitles.

Sound is DTS-HD MA 5.1. It seems a bit under-recorded as I needed a loudness setting of -7 db to get to about 82 db at the loudest parts of the opera. Orchestra sound stage is not much wider than stereo, voices only through the center speaker. The principals carry body mics and most voices are clear, but my ears had trouble with Osiride (Dmitry Korchak) and Aronne (YiJie Shi), the 2 tenors. They might not have nice voices, but the applause they received would indicate otherwise. The microphone on Osiride seemed pointed too down rather then forward. Anyway, they just sounded screechy to me at higher levels but I can't exactly pinpoint what caused it. They seem under-recorded and then turned-up to make up for it. Reducing the overall loudness didn't help much. Balance between orchestra, principals and chorus is o.k., applause is from the front and sides. Overall, you get the feeling of sitting in row 10-12.

So needless to say, it can get only 2 stars from me.

Once you look at the stage set-up, it becomes clear that this is a difficult performance to record. The orchestra pretty much in the middle of the scene, hard construction surfaces of concrete, glass and metal everywhere, the lower level not much higher than a parking garage with the chorus singing inside, construction on the sides, you can see the reflections will come back from all around and it is pretty much impossible to get a clean sound. The stage set-up made it clearly difficult for the audio recording.

I did listen to the LPCM stereo for a while, just to see whether it was any better, but no. It just confirmed that the surround track was hardly any better than the stereo track, just a bit louder. It sounded as if the surround track was just digitally created out of the stereo track.
The use of my headphones did not  result in more insight, but they just confirmed that all voices are fine except the tenors, that there is a lot of background noise from all the non-singing actors getting in and out of VW buses and that the sound is basically up front and not very detailed when louder.

Much to my surprise, the ""Recording Producer"" turned out to be Elfride Foroni, who did such an outstanding job as ""Audio Engineer"" with Il Trittico, one of my Top 5 recordings (a 7.1 surround track).
As a producer, she had ""help"". There is an assistant and 3 recording engineers, editors and mixers. The ""Live Recording"" and ""Mix and Mastering"" is credited to De Lirica Recording Studio, Fano.
I don't know whether this staging made it impossible to create a good recording or whether it could have been better than this, but either way I can't recommend it.",1378771200,4,3166,4.61278863232682
8540862,4,B009F7YU8W,"Moses as an Osama bin Laden style Jewish terrorist? Pharoah as a King Hussein of Jordan style leader (with a glamorous wife)? Well, that's part of the conceit of this intriguing staging of Rossini's ""Mose in Egitto"" by the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro in 2011. And, for the most part, it works. Certainly it makes for a very entertaining performance.

""RegiaTheater"" is the term used over the past decade or so, for stage works (plays/operas) wherein the director's radical take largely overwhelms the underlying work being performed. It has, here in America, a very negative connotation, smacking of German/Austrian uber-works and director hubris. Most opera fans here will say that they hate it and just condemn these productions, often sight unseen. (""I'll play the dvd but only to listen to the music."") But, the audience for these directorial efforts is more amenable in Europe.

But what is RegiaTheater really? The idea, as here, of changing the time and place where the work is set is hardly new. Orson Welles did it in the 1930's with Shakespeare, and the idea is so common as to be hardly radical. I can scarcely think of a Shakespeare play that I have seen in the past fifteen years (live or dvd) where this wasn't the case.

The same is true with many opera productions, both now and over the past years.

This updating/transformation is as common in opera now as it is in Shakespeare play performances. But is it the evil ""RegiaTheater?""

I address this here because I have just watched two 2011 performances released on dvd where this was a key part of the production. This performance of ""Mose"" and Glyndebourne's production of Handel's ""Rinaldo"" Rinaldo. (The Rinaldo was set in a Harry Potter-like private school for teenagers.) I thoroughly enjoyed the ""Mose"", but found the ""Rinaldo"" much less effective. And even the Peter Sellars productions of the Mozart operas were artistically uneven, in my opinion. (The Cosi set in Despina's Caf worked quite well, and Figaro set in the Trump Tower worked pretty good, but a Count living on the 50th floor? I don't think so. And the ""Don Giovanni"" set in Harlem's ghetto did not work well at all.)

But let's start by examining this Mose. The transformation of the story into the modern strife-torn Middle East is certainly very jarring. The visuals are very provocative and striking. The mood of the region torn by warfare and terrorism with many random deaths, is effectively staged, and very engrossing. They key to appreciating it here, in my opinion, is NOT to take the Biblical story too literally in this setting.

The story of the opera is the classic Biblical battle between Moses and Pharoah surrounding the ten plagues, and the fleeing of the Jews through the Red Sea, which then closed in on the Egyptians chasing them, probably the most vivid and memorable story in the entire Old Testament. The opera, in true Romantic era styling, tacks on a love story between a Jewish girl affianced to Pharoah's oldest son, who works to keep the Jews in Egypt so he can keep the girl. The opera, though, is mostly about the confrontation between Moses and Pharoah.

Placing the opera in the current Middle east, makes the actual opera story largely superfluous. Even while watching, we know this isn't really about Moses, Pharoah, and the power of God. It is really about the war between the Jews and the Arabs, especially as carried on by terrorists on BOTH sides.

Well, all I can say, is that the staging worked very well for me. I saw the Moses/Pharoah story line as separate from the religious battle, and the love story as just some wonderful musical interludes. Overall, it made for a powerful, and even exciting viewing experience.

The singers were all excellent. Riccardo Zanellato as Moses was especially commanding and compelling in his stage presence- which is absolutely necessary to carry the Biblical story. He has to appear larger than life, which he does. This is especially critical in the opera, because he doesn't get a major aria at all!! Other than a brief arioso in Act One, his entire performance is in recitative. (Rossini was really playing with form here.) Sonia Ganassi as Elcia (the Jewish girl) and Alex Esposito and Dmitry Korchak as Pharoah and son were also very effective.

The most famous piece in the opera is the great chorus lament in the brief Act Three. It is very well done here. Surely, this must have ben a major influence on Verdi's monumental ""Va Pensiero"" in ""Nabucco"". Just wonderful.

SPOILER ALERT: The staging ends on an uncertain note. The Jews successfully attack the palace as a large tank appears and fires on it. Then, the young Jewish tank commander enters the ruined palace to meet a young Egyptian boy who is hiding a belt of explosives beneath his jacket. Will he explode it? End of opera.

I enjoyed the production enormously. I must again applaud ROF for its terrific production values on this dvd. The filming and sound are terrific. And, the 35 minute ""Making of"" documentary is one of the best I have seen. In this case, I recommend watching that BEFORE watching the opera as it gives very good information on the production itself and makes the viewing more informative. I also want to commend ROF for its overall daring in encouraging radical stagings of Rossini's works. It doesn't work all the time (I wasn't crazy about their recent ""Demetrio""), and many people's opinions will vary on each production. But the singing is uniformly excellent as are the dvd productions themselves. And this one was excellent.

So, is it ""Regiatheater"" and what does that mean? I take it this way. Any radical changing of the setting/time of a work is a form of regiatheater, so just labeling as such is not helpful. All that really matters is does the change make for an effective production, one which MAY get you to re-think other aspects of the work in question. (Also to be considered- is it internally consistent, which can be a problem. If it is not consistent, then it is effect just for effect's sake.) And sometimes, whether it is regiatheater or not may just be a matter of degree (how much is the underlying work smothered by the staging?).

Here, I fully enjoyed a very different staging, even though it didn't relate directly to the Biblical story being told. But, still, a very enjoyable performance.",1364428800,2,7617,5.493595217762596

Think of Peter Sellars updating of the Mozart/DaPonte operas into modern New York&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Cosi-fan-Tutte-Susan-Larson-James-Maddalena-Sanford-Sylvan-Peter-Sellars-Craig-Smith-Wiener-Symphoniker-Peter-Sellars/dp/B00092ZANQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart - Cosi fan Tutte / Susan Larson, James Maddalena, Sanford Sylvan, Peter Sellars, Craig Smith, Wiener Symphoniker, Peter Sellars</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Don-Giovanni/dp/B00092ZAN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart - Don Giovanni</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Le-Nozze-di-Figaro-Sanford-Sylvan-Susan-Larson-Jeanne-Ommerle-Sue-Ellen-Kuzma-Frank-Kelley-Peter-Sellars-Craig-Smith-Wiener-Symphoniker/dp/B00092ZANG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart - Le Nozze di Figaro / Sanford Sylvan, Susan Larson, Jeanne Ommerle, Sue Ellen Kuzma, Frank Kelley, Peter Sellars, Craig Smith, Wiener Symphoniker</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rossini-Mose-Egitto-Korchak/dp/B009F7YU8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8""> Or Jonathan Miller's mafia-style Rigoletto of years past [[ASIN:B000LP6KU8 Verdi - Jonathan Miller's Rigoletto</a>.  This updating/transformation is as common in opera now as it is in Shakespeare play performances.  But is it the evil ""RegiaTheater?""

I address this here because I have just watched two 2011 performances released on dvd where this was a key part of the production.  This performance of ""Mose"" and Glyndebourne's production of Handel's ""Rinaldo""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rinaldo/dp/B008EKMGPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rinaldo</a>.  (The Rinaldo was set in a Harry Potter-like private school for teenagers.)  I thoroughly enjoyed the ""Mose"", but found the ""Rinaldo"" much less effective.  And even the Peter Sellars productions of the Mozart operas were artistically uneven, in my opinion.  (The Cosi set in Despina's Caf worked quite well, and Figaro set in the Trump Tower worked pretty good, but a Count living on the 50th floor?  I don't think so.  And the ""Don Giovanni"" set in Harlem's ghetto did not work well at all.)

But let's start by examining this Mose.  The transformation of the story into the modern strife-torn Middle East is certainly very jarring.  The visuals are very provocative and striking.  The mood of the region torn by warfare and terrorism with many random deaths, is effectively staged, and very engrossing.  They key to appreciating it here, in my opinion, is NOT to take the Biblical story too literally in this setting.

The story of the opera is the classic Biblical battle between Moses and Pharoah surrounding the ten plagues, and the fleeing of the Jews through the Red Sea, which then closed in on the Egyptians chasing them, probably the most vivid and memorable story in the entire Old Testament.  The opera, in true Romantic era styling, tacks on a love story between a Jewish girl affianced to Pharoah's oldest son, who works to keep the Jews in Egypt so he can keep the girl.  The opera, though, is mostly about the confrontation between Moses and Pharoah.

Placing the opera in the current Middle east, makes the actual opera story largely superfluous.  Even while watching, we know this isn't really about Moses, Pharoah, and the power of God.  It is really about the war between the Jews and the Arabs, especially as carried on by terrorists on BOTH sides.

Well, all I can say, is that the staging worked very well for me.  I saw the Moses/Pharoah story line as separate from the religious battle, and the love story as just some wonderful musical interludes. Overall, it made for a powerful, and even exciting viewing experience.

The singers were all excellent.  Riccardo Zanellato as Moses was especially commanding and compelling in his stage presence- which is absolutely necessary to carry the Biblical story.  He has to appear larger than life, which he does.  This is especially critical in the opera, because he doesn't get a major aria at all!!  Other than a brief arioso in Act One, his entire performance is in recitative.  (Rossini was really playing with form here.)  Sonia Ganassi as Elcia (the Jewish girl) and Alex Esposito and Dmitry Korchak as Pharoah and son were also very effective.

The most famous piece in the opera is the great chorus lament in the brief Act Three.  It is very well done here.  Surely, this must have ben a major influence on Verdi's monumental ""Va Pensiero"" in ""Nabucco"".  Just wonderful.

SPOILER ALERT:  The staging ends on an uncertain note.  The Jews successfully attack the palace as a large tank appears and fires on it.  Then, the young Jewish tank commander enters the ruined palace to meet a young Egyptian boy who is hiding a belt of explosives beneath his jacket.  Will he explode it?  End of opera.

I enjoyed the production enormously.  I must again applaud ROF for its terrific production values on this dvd.  The filming and sound are terrific.  And, the 35 minute ""Making of"" documentary is one of the best I have seen.  In this case, I recommend watching that BEFORE watching the opera as it gives very good information on the production itself and makes the viewing more informative.  I also want to commend ROF for its overall daring in encouraging radical stagings of Rossini's works.  It doesn't work all the time (I wasn't crazy about their recent ""Demetrio""), and many people's opinions will vary on each production.  But the singing is uniformly excellent as are the dvd productions themselves.  And this one was excellent.

So, is it ""Regiatheater"" and what does that mean?  I take it this way.  Any radical changing of the setting/time of a work is a form of regiatheater, so just labeling as such  is not helpful.  All that really matters is does the change make for an effective production, one which MAY get you to re-think other aspects of the work in question.  (Also to be considered- is it internally consistent, which can be a problem.  If it is not consistent, then it is effect just for effect's sake.)  And sometimes, whether it is regiatheater or not may just be a matter of degree (how much is the underlying work smothered by the staging?).

Here, I fully enjoyed a very different staging, even though it didn't relate directly to the Biblical story being told.  But, still, a very enjoyable performance.",1361318400,12,7804,5.5860306643952296
8540864,2,B009F7YU8W,"I think that the prior reviewers have captured the quality of the singing and orchestral aspects of this performance. If it had been released as a CD album, I would have given it a five star rating. But as a performed opera, with all the visual impact of acting and staging coming into play, I cannot agree that the staging is ""... a meaningful modern way to bring its themes to life while at the same time, injecting its ancient Biblical story with a heavy dose of reality.""

Mose in Egitto IS that ""ancient Biblical story"" and for Graham Vick to alter it to allow him to use the opera as a kind of political diatribe on conditions in the Middle East ends up being internally inconsistant, illogical and just plain silly. There are so many instances where the libretto and the stage actions are at dramatic odds with one another. One example shows the Jews ostensibly rigging the stage for demolition, with lots of concertina wire in evidence, while the libretto has them trying to cross the Red Sea to escape the Egyptian Army. Say what???

Similarly, in the famous prayer scene in Act III, Moses appears to be worshipping his AK 47, which is as or more obscene that the breast feeding incident in last year's ROF DVD of Zelmira, which drew a lot of criticism, if I remember correctly. In essence, what Vick has done is to use Rossini's opera to tell a story that is light years from what Rossini wrote.

If Vick is upset with the violence in the Middle East (and who is not?), perhaps he might go on talk radio or write a book, rather than to do intellectual violence to an opera that is going on 200 years old.

For devotees of the Bible (of whom I am not one) this would have to be a troublesome and insensitive appraoch to the opera. For me, Vick's treatment of one of Rossini's best opera seria shows profound disrespect for both the composer and the operatic genre. I really wonder if he even read the libretto. For me, I'll stay with the French version, Moise et Paharaon from La Scala, now on Arthaus Musik. There the story is respected and the cast is better.",1360540800,5,2070,4.439473684210526
