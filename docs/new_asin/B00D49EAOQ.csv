8589451,2,B00D49EAOQ,"It's a good message and and ok short story.  It is NOT the original I thought it was.
Has nothing to do with the poem.  Really not sure where the violin fits in, the first min. of the film. Nothing else in the entire movie about it.
Good message, hard to watch, kids would be too bored to catch the message.  Definitely not what I expected.",1390867200,,340,4.121212121212121
8589452,3,B00D49EAOQ,"This story is not the original story and does not reflect the story included in the original poem and song.  It really had nothing to do with the story.

I was very disappointed in the movie and had a difficult time watching it to the end.",1388793600,,239,4.173913043478261
