3904286,2,B002C6VMIE,"This miniseries is not a remake of the film, Meteor, from 1979. Elements of the plot are still there, but the story is totally different.  In many ways the 1979 movie with its Cold War subplot, New York scenery, the beautiful Natalie Wood, the delightful Brian Keith, the great Karl Malden, and the ever impressive Sean Connery is good cinema.

Now, we turn our attention to the 2009 Meteor which aired on NBC this July.  When I read that Jason Alexander had been cast as the head scientist, I said to myself, ""Oh! My!""  Don't get me wrong.  Jason Alexander is a great actor, but the lead scientist to save the world from an asteroid?

Marla Sokoloff`s Imogene reminded me of the Perils of Pauline.  This young actress deserves an Emmy for all the situations the writers tossed her into as she raced to save the world with her laptop in hand.

Michael Rookery's Calvin is the super bad human element in the plot.  He is a great actor, but the Calvin character borders on Michael Myers without the hockey mask.

Ernie Hudson as General Brasser gives some credence to this film.  He is always a delight to watch, but it is obvious that the script did not give him much to work with here because his fine sense of humor is missing.  This film could have used a bit of humor.

The talented Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Lehman was totally wasted.  This great actor deserved better, but of course, he may have read beyond the first act and decided the Back To The Future series was not all that bad after all.  At least in that film series he got to show his acting abilities and actually do something.

Stacy Keach as Sheriff Crowe gave the best performance in this miniseries.  It is always good to see the Keach put life into his characters, and he did just that as the brave Sheriff facing the end of the world and a town of misery.  His son and granddaughter's subplot was not as interesting until the end of the film.

Was this miniseries totally bad?  Perhaps.  Actually, yes!

To me I found it entertaining as did my wife.  Was it great?  No!  It had some moments, but overall, it did lack something- a lot of something.

Hey!  This is the summer and at least NBC is tossing out new shows be they bad or terrible!  Survival Sundays may be just that-survive these miniseries.

If you have read any of my movie reviews, you know I collect DVDs-great, good, bad and no adjective to describe.  Would I buy this DVD?  Definitely!  It has a place on my DVD shelf.",1248652800,2,2455,4.410714285714286
3904287,1,B002C6VMIE,"It's unfortunate that Amazon doesn't allow for negative ratings, as this made-for-TV miniseries doesn't even deserve one star.

It's hard to know where to start with this one.  First of all, the writing for this movie is atrocious.  There are factual errors, logical errors and plot holes so bad that you'd swear they had to have been put there on purpose, because no one would mistakenly write something so wrong.

Then there's the direction.  There are some very talented actors in this movie, and yet they act as if they're making a silent movie-era melodrama -- overacting to the extreme, making bizarre facial expressions, etc.  Without revealing any spoilers, let's just say that one of the characters dies in the second half of the miniseries, and as he dies his body is wracked with convulsions that look like a stagehand is poking him with an electric cattle prod.  It's actually funny.  And what's with those unlabeled maps that seem to show the location of one of the scenarios?  It's like the CGI department ran out of money and they left in half-finished interstitials.

I guess the most egregious fault with this miniseries, though, is the fact that it is completely BORING.  So much of the narrative has nothing to do with anything else that occurs that it feels as if they took a two-hour TV movie and tried to stretch it to four hours by padding it with random unrelated storylines.

Oh, yeah, and the basic premise of this, a giant piece of space rock hurtling toward the Earth, has been done to death already.

So PLEASE don't waste your money on this piece of garbage.  Buy DVDs of quality television.  Heck, buy DVDs of mediocre television.  Just don't reward the producers of this movie by giving them your money.",1248048000,29,1735,4.733333333333333
3904309,2,B002C6VMIE,"This movie was poorly done on so many counts. First, they desperately needed a science advisor. For example, no comet has enough force to push a main belt asteroid so that it hits the earth in two days.  Also, how many times can the bad guy escape death only to terrorize again and again.  Just didn't seem realistic.  if you could fix the plot, improve the science, and then shorten the movie from 4 hours to 1.5, it might work.  Better luck next time.",1525219200,2,453,4.357142857142857

3904358,3,B002C6VMIE,"This is not the fun 1979 disaster film; which was a good film although the snobs can tear it apart for it's special effects which was basically models and such. But at that time audiences were used to that and it was top notch. ( I love that old flick!) This one has some great computer generated effects in it and that's the best part of this miniseries.  Whenever they are showing meteors and rockets shooting them down, or even the control center this show redeems itself. But like others have said there is a whole unneeded storyline about  a maniac cop who randomly kills people.  Usually in disaster movies the disaster moves the characters across the story and scenery. In this one , the madman cop played by Michael Rooker,  does that.  I like Michael Rooker and I wish someone would cast him as a hero sidekick or something as he's  a really good actor, and he's more than just a villain portrayer.  But even he can't save this film on that plot device.  It is good to see Stacy Keach in action again. He does a fine job as the Sheriff of taft , California where most of the action takes place.  The actors are all good in this . I don't buy this attitude that because you dislike a movie , therefore it was all the actors fault. It's not , they all do what they should. They do have some really bad scenes in this though. For instance when a character dies in the control room they just leave him uncovered on the floor.  Or other clunky scenes. In hd this looked pretty good , it's been rerun on the scy fy channel among other places. And on dvd this looks fine as it's a newer film and not faded etc.  So if you want a 2009 era disaster film that spends a lot of time dealing with a madman cop ,then you will like this. However this is a clunky type of movie , it sort of lurches along. So , if you analyze it , you will not be a happy camper.",1383436800,,1855,4.153631284916201

3904380,1,B002C6VMIE,"I'm a peaceful person, but this movie is sooo bad and sooo irritating that it makes you want to trounce the screenwriter.

The screenwriter who wrote this garbage is Alex Greenfield. The director is Ernie Barbarash. Remember their names so they never darken your TV again. In my 6000 movie collection... NONE are as exasperating as this movie.

Save yourself the insanity. If you must see a Meteor movie then watch either ""Meteor"" with Sean Connery and Natalie Wood or watch ""Deep Impact"" with Morgan Freeman and a cast of big stars or watch ""Armageddon"" with Bruce Willis. Any of these three movies will be much better than this garbage. Christopher Lloyd is fortunate his role in this movie only lasted a few minutes.

If you insist on watching this movie, be forewarned because THIS is what you will have to put up with if you watch this aggravating tripe:

Every 3 minutes something stupid happens. The expert scientist - Lloyd (who was fired by the incompetent scientist) who hangs up him when he tries to warn him about the asteroid; The Scientist tries to drive to JPL from Mexico with his assistant scientist, a young girl; her car breaks down; the cell phones won't work; the scientist (Christopher Lloyd) gets hit by a truck and killed in broad daylight while stupidly standing in the middle of the road looking up at the sky just minutes into the film; she gets a ride but the truck driver changes his mind and drops her off at a Mexican police station; the police station she stops at is under armed siege by prisoners; she shoots it out with the prisoners and steals a police car; she tries to get past the traffic at the border using the siren; the border guard stops her and detains her; they can't validate her identity or story because the internet and phones are down; when one guard decides to drive her they get into a wreck and the driver dies; EVERY time she sees someone dying... she tells them ""don't talk"" including the scientist who was trying to tell her important info (I hate it when someone says that to a dying person); then she ends up walking; when she comes to a store they want $50 for a phone call; then they pull guns on each other; she finds a house with a phone and the missile center is hit by a meteor while she is talking to them; of course their idiot incompetent meteor expert is crushed and dies; instead of having the sense to call someone else, she starts walking again with a shotgun; then she tries to ""wave down"" a passing car with a shotgun in her hand and wonders why they don't stop; then she tries to drive a disabled vehicle on the side of the road and acts surprised when it doesn't start... duh; the missile center is so stupid they use Morse code to contact the space station to spot the asteroid instead using the hundreds of satellites and satellite dishes or seti or call NASA or Norad to contact the astronauts AND use their deep space radar systems; the missile center acts like they can't see anything despite the dozens of deep space radar, infrared and laser satellite systems, plus we have plenty of missile controls and NASA and JPL and military bases with DEEP underground ops & missile control centers safe from meteors which they never bother to try; she gets a ride with the police officer father who is enroute to rescue his daughter from a murderer holding her hostage, so he will only take the assistant scientist part way; the Russians won't help with missiles because they are radar blind; then they decide to lie to the Russians that their cities are in the asteroids path; the grandfather of the hostage (another police officer) gives her a ride to a relay station but the power goes out because the murderer removed the fuse because he is also after the grandfather; the murderer shoots the grandfather; the police father and grandfather finally shoot the murderer AFTER the daughter hits the murderer in the head but they leave him lying with the gun in his hand without checking.... AGAIN; then they barely get the power back on for the assist scientist but too late because the missiles have launched; Despite the fact she was clueless in the beginning, she suddenly becomes the All-Knowing expert and she tells them to reset the missile trajectory on the fly and how to detonate them as if her astronomer skills included nuclear yield; which didn't destroy the target as intended but placed it into orbit; the idiot missile commander is totally clueless about everything and the setting is as if he is the sole missile control in the country; where in the heck was the Pentagon, NASA or Norad or the white house instead of just one hole in the ground missile control center with one clueless officer... someone needs to ban this screenwriter and the director for life from ever subjecting anyone to this garbage again. Poor Christopher Lloyd is hit by a truck after the first few minutes but they try to make it appear that he is the star so people will watch based on his appearance. It is clear this screenwriter nor the director did not bother to research their subject and make endless stupid technical mistakes.

That's not all... A murderer is on the loose; he attacks the father; hijacks a car; the car runs out of gas; he kills the airhead driver; the shelter is out of room; the military makes people abandon their vehicles and walk in the heat in desert conditions; the military won't let a woman, her infant and children on the truck and wants to leave them in the desert so 3 girls get off to give them room when totally unnecessary but the boyfriend keeps his seat; one of the three girls is the target of the murderer; the town crazies are bullying everyone with shotguns; the lone ambulance is out of room and leaves half the injured kids from a school bus literally laying in the road waiting for help; meteors are raining down on everyone across the planet; the hospital supply truck doesn't show up & the doctor is too dumb to think of obtaining medicines and supplies from the pharmacy until her spouse suggests it; the hospital is hit by a meteor and collapses; the doctor is trapped leaving a kid (her own injured son from the school bus) to perform medical treatment to the other injured kids; no one can get in for rescue because the gate is chain locked while a fireman looks stupidly at the lock; then the kid falls into the morgue and gets knocked out and freaks out when he awakens alone to bodies left in the corridor by busy hospital staff; the doctor (his mother) starts a fire in the room where she's trapped while smashing everything; the kid gets himself trapped AGAIN by stupidly crawling under a pile of rubble to reach supplies; the shelters release people telling them it is safe before the meteors have finished falling without checking with authorities; The nuke plant is hit by a meteor; the shelters deprive people of food; then they go on a bizarre area search for radiation as if it is hiding in every corner even when the meters show clear; the murderer catches his target because she didn't get the phone message; the satellite connection gets destroyed just before the missile launch to target the asteroid; the idiot astronomer in charge doesn't know how to manually program the missile trajectory without the satellite; the only scientist which knows how was the one hit by a truck; his assistant is the one who runs into obstacles every 3 miles while driving to LA from Mexico; the TV network signal is scrambled but they force you to watch it; endless traffic jams from cities being bombarded; the phones are down; the missiles failed; a second asteroid is behind the first one; the murderer is holding hostages; of course after they knock the murderer out (the first time), no one bothers to check or secure him or remove the gun next to him; then they put him in the back seat of the car and of course he wakes up attacks and crashes the car and takes the daughter hostage while her father (a policeman) ends up walking to the same $50 per call store with huge markups and the proprietor's son who has an assault rifle but they give him a car after learning he is a cop; then the cop father is diverted from his daughters rescue when he sees rapists attacking a woman; After the murderer kills an elderly couple and a military roadblock guard, the murderer takes the police officer father hostage with his daughter AGAIN; then as listed above, catches up with & shoots the grandfather (police officer) who had taken the girl scientist to the relay station.... and on and on and on and on until you can stand no more.... Then they stand and look at the orbiting asteroid and talk about the next one due in another decade or so.

This movie is nothing but one ignorant moment after another. If there is anything stupid someone can do... it is in this movie. It is positively maddening.

This screenwriter should never, ever write another screenplay. If you found this description irritating... consider this was the rundown on what you would have to suffer through with the movie. You'd have to be brain dead or intellectually challenged to tolerate it without fast forwarding.",1376524800,10,9111,4.59618930547019

3904408,3,B002C6VMIE,"To make this typical disaster movie a mini-series, they were kind of forced to turn it into a soap opera just to add in enough filler to make it work. Yeah, they did it. However, we got strapped with a bunch of hokey story threads that were typical 70's Towering Inferno/Poseidon Adventure/(place your typical disaster flick here) fare that if tightened up, could have been a lot better as a two hour movie.

I'll have to admit I still have a weakness for these movies, especially on SyFy and on a Saturday afternoon that was supposed to be a telescope observing weekend called off by crummy weather. I was really hoping for some kind of icky bug, but beggars can't be choosers and at least it wasn't another slasher flick, some stupid vampire story, or another dreaded Stephen King love fest. Thank you SyFy!

The plot has a gigantic asteroid knocked out of its orbit by an errant comet and it plunges toward earth. Not in itself impossible. However, blowing it up with missiles so close to Earth is beyond dumb, and avoiding radioactive fallout is well...

To top it off, and to make it part two of the miniseries, we not only have one rock, but two! And, the second half is even bigger than the first! What makes part two even more ridiculous is that this chunk actually makes it into the atmosphere before the missiles hit it and guess what? It is deflected!!! Sorry `bout that, but if that chunk of planet has already made it to our upper atmosphere by the time we ""bump"" it with a few missiles, it isn't going to change its mind and deflect.

However, I don't go into these movies to worry about reality. After all, my belief system is suspended at the door. It's about having fun, forgetting my troubles and just watching the hapless people in the story go through their troubles.

I just love Stacy Keach. I am so glad he survives. He has always been one of my faves. I won't give away who else makes it, but let's just say that the body count of big name stars doesn't leave a lot of survivors at the end.

There are a lot of subplots, as there has to be in a miniseries-that-is-really-a-soap-opera. Most of them are just ways to keep the story going and fill in the space between the meteor killing attempts.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie. It had plenty of hokey stuff to entertain me, plenty of totally unrealistic ""science,"" and Stacy Keach. Not bad for a Saturday afternoon where I couldn't get out with the telescope.",1301875200,3,2431,4.486425339366516
3904429,4,B002C6VMIE,"If you enjoy disaster films,this one was pretty good. It has a decent cast with pretty good special effects. It is a good film for family watching since it doesn't have language,sex or bloody violence.",1274659200,,201,4.771428571428571
3904430,1,B002C6VMIE,"When I saw that Christopher Lloyd was in this movie I thought it might hold some promise, but his part is little more than a cameo.  The film is pretty bad.  I would not be surprised to hear he walked away from the project.

There are various story-lines and all of them are hard to believe.  There is the researcher with her notebook computer who has trajectory codes that no one can figure out.  Why did she go north anyway when she could have called from home?  She faces rapists and murders along the way, although there are really no sex scenes to worry about.  A policeman has to chase down his former partner who is on a killing spree.  The incompetent cop allows the guy to get away again and again, raising the murder count.  Then there is a family with a kid at a hospital.  Talk about a bad day... a meteor ruins their house... knocks over the school bus... hits the hospital... etc.  I kept thinking that about two hours of material could be removed and we would have a better and more coherent film.  As for the meteor or asteroid itself, missiles are fired to save the planet... AFTER IT HAS ENTERED THE ATMOSPHERE!!!  Sorry, even the science does not wash.  Missiles would not vaporize such objects entirely, either.  Even if pushed aside, gravity tidal forces would still tear the earth apart.  This movie is bad story-telling, bad acting and bad science.

As for the special effects, they are cheesy at best, no doubt due to budget restraints.  We see a meteor heading for the International Space Station, but then the scene cuts away.  Contact is lost, but there are no visuals.  In any case, does anyone else think this genre has been repeated to death?",1268092800,8,1672,4.51

I have never written a review before but this is so so so terrible that I just want to warn you all out there!

3904432,3,B002C6VMIE,"The 1979 theatrical release ""Meteor"" has been routinely mentioned among the worst movies of all time.  Thankfully, this is not a remake of ""Meteor"", but more of a reimagining of the same concept moved forward in time 30 years.

The scenario is roughly the same.  Earth is facing annihilation as a giant rock hurtles towards it.  Scientists and the military join forces to try and stop it.  That's where the similarities end.  This ""Meteor"" does not feature the Cold War tension of the Russians; it doesn't have the cool orbiting missile platforms Hercules and Peter the Great; and it doesn't have heart.  At least with the first ""Meteor"", the characters were easier to care about.

This movie includes a fine cast, headlined by Jason Alexander, Christopher Lloyd, Stacy Keach, and Ernie Hudson.  And though Marla Sokoloff is easy on the eyes, her character began to grate on me.  The special effects were pretty good, considering that it would be very difficult for anyone to actually capture what would happen the moment a piece of rock or a swarm of smaller rocks hit Earth.

I give the movie three stars mainly because it isn't that bad for what it is.  For someone like me who loves this type of movie, choices (good or bad) are few and far between.",1255651200,26,1253,4.697247706422019

If you like a good disaster I recommend you buy this film I give it *****.,1254614400,9,318,3.661764705882353

a tv miniseries.  Hey, some of these television series can be very good, but
in this case its not.
The good: Nice to see Christopher Loyd and Stacey Keach....too bad there getting
  old...which means im getting old...arrrrggg
  Some nice shots of the meteors and the space debris comming to earth.

The Bad:  Some of the acting and the writting will make you cringe, and that
  poor girl trying to get a ride throughout the whole movie .....

The Ugly:  Its long, has many subplots and they even have one character who
  brings in the needed brutal violence....it really didn't belong to
  this type of movie...

And watching the whole thing..... i was not satisfied........coaster time !",1254441600,2,764,4.631578947368421
3904435,3,B002C6VMIE,"I AM IN AGREEMENT WITH FELLOW REVIEWERS ON THIS MOVIE.  IF I'D WATCHED IT WITH COMMERCIALS I PROBABLY WOULD'VE SWITCHED CHANNELS.
AS IN MOST DISASTER MOVIES, SUBPLOTS ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE US CARE FOR THE VICTIMS BUT THE SUBS IN THIS JUST AREN'T THAT INTERESTING...SEEN THEM ALL BEFORE.
AND WE ALL KNOW THE EARTH IS GONNA BE SAVED AT THE LAST MINUTE (IMPACT DID THE SAME THING).
ACTING:  I LIKED MARLA SOKOLOFF ON THE PRACTICE.  HER LUCY ADDED SOME LEVITY.  BUT SHE IS SORELY MISCAST IN THIS ONE.  CHRISTOPHER LLOYD GETS THIRD BILLING FOR BASICALLY A CAMEO.  BILLY CAMPBELL JUST LOOKS BORED.  MICHAEL ROOKER JUST CHEWS UP THE SCENERY..BADLY.  STACY KEACH DOES FAIRLY WELL.
IN SUMMARY, TOO MANY CLICHES, TOO LONG, AND NOTHING NEW.",1253059200,,728,4.814516129032258
3904436,1,B002C6VMIE,"This is an excuse-for-a-movie that is so bad, I think everyone associated with it (writers, director, producer, NBC execs) should commit honorable suicide or at least resign in shame and vow to work no more making video for public consumption. Because we may never know if the writers were just incapable of doing anything beyond mish-mashing clips of other disaster tales together, if the producers forced them or if the network nitwits required it, proper extermination of this mental virus may be impossible. The network should demand their money back and every viewer should collect $200 for the mental impairment this movie causes. Also the producers should be shipped off to Gitmo as mental terrorists because this is a disaster film that LIES.

First, the science is WRONG at every level. Incoming meteors come at 25,000 mph and cannot be shot down by shoulder held Stinger missiles or even Patriot Missiles. The big asteroid behaves like an oil tanker that's lost its rudder, not a real asteroid. The larger asteroids are depicted as low orbiting satellites that are falling ""slowly"" to earth. Even so, there's no way to shoot them down. The ultimate big rock that hot science bimbo Imogene slaps with a flight of nukes cannot be diverted as described. Nasa has already run that scenario and it is proven impossible.

Second, the characters are all wrong. Imogene bimbo, holding the key to save the world, cannot even express herself: ""Call JPL, this number, this name, ask them why you need to let me have a phone"" is all she needs to say, and yet the too-dumb-to-breathe writers won't let the character talk. The policeman continually acts against law enforcement training and techniques to enable the crazed killer to escape. Bad writer bad. The hot-doctor-chick is also dumb as bread. ""We have no more medicine in the hospital, eeek,"" she says. But when tall male drone husband asks, ""What about the pharmacy, the pharmacy has medicine?"" she squees ""Oh why didn't I think of that..."" Would you let this goof even take your pulse? Dialog sucks, bad writer, greedy director who failed to put a foot down and say no.

Third, the drama is all wrong. With the world about to be smashed with a giant rock, there's lots of stories that could be told that are part of that story arc, but instead this idiotic crap spends major time showing characters moving rocks from one pile to another. When the hospital collapses, the film follows not one but three groups of characters digging rubble: doctor-mom digging in for access, teen boy digging for a needed oxygen bottle, and tall male accompanied by tall emergency worker. That's three character groups all seen doing the same repetitive physical action. None of these sequences have anything to do with the main story, and belong to a building fell down drama or a ""there's been a cave in at the mine"" story.  Oh, yes, then a tiny asteroid hits our anti-asteroid command base, and they get to pile up rubble too. GAD!

Finally, the geography is all wrong. We can cut the Hollywood TV nitwits some slack for not understanding astrophysics cause that is a hard topic. The fact that the whole story is based on orbital mechanics might make us think that they'd at least try to grasp the basics, but oh, well. What is really unforgivable is that no one can even read a map of Southern California. The homey just-plain-folks story and crazy killer sub-plot are set in Taft, California. Imogene science bimbo is tied to a major plot element that has her attempting to enter the US from Mexico, probably Tijuana. Imogene needs to get to JPL. Problem. Apparently no one associated with this production noticed that the Mexican border is 130 south of JPL on the 5 Freeway and Taft is 100 miles north of JPL on the 5 Freeway. Now Imogene is a brain dead bimbo, but she has to drive 100 miles right past her destination to end up in the clutches of the crazy killer in the last act.

What, are TV people so arrogant that they think the viewers can't read a map?

Maybe this is an intelligence test or maybe the writers were paid so little they concocted this pile of nonsense to embarrass the producers.

It is rare that I come onto a website like this to review anything, but you must know that Meteor is really, REALLY bad.  It is poorly written, poorly acted, makes poor use of every cliche plot device, reuses the same poor FX shots a good 30 times over...  Heck, I think the once-per-minute faux Google Earth shots add up to 20 minutes of screen time all on their own.

But I say this- I am also enjoying it plenty.  It is making me laugh.  I recommend a few glasses of wine before watching, however.  It did wonders for me, though.",1249689600,10,596,4.086206896551724

It has Doc Brown/The Pagemaster & Merle/Yondu, so it it HAS to be at least tolerable, right?

Nope. Not in any way.

I had read other reviews so I knew I'd have to see past/ignore the tropey-ness, the expected cookie-cutter secondary plotlines, the gaping plot holes, & the really, really bad psuedo-science.  I went in to this willing to put all that aside for the chance to see these two amazing actors together.

Michael Rooker playing a pre-Walking Dead-Merle-type character was jarring enough, but then (SPOILER ALERT!!!)-
THEY KILL DOC BROWN (Christopher Lloyd)!!
27 minutes in!!!
