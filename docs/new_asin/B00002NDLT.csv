1255640,5,B00002NDLT,"I'd usually only rate this movie with 3 stars but as a load of thickos (probably big-budget Hollywood cgi fans) have slated it, I am giving it 5 stars.

The plot is fairly original and the setting of the film in a futuristic and decadent Russia is both interesting and clever. I'm not going to describe what happens in the movie - so go watch it!! That is unless you are a moron....if that's the case, go watch 'Hulk' or something.",1100217600,8,431,4.320987654320987
1255641,2,B00002NDLT,"This movie was nothing but a waste of money. sure girls are nice but not when it more than half of a movie. Nothing exciting or fun happened. Bought Mischief 3000 with this dvd and was much more satisfied with that movie. don't buy unless you feel like seeing girls, not cars.",1099267200,,276,4.326923076923077
1255642,2,B00002NDLT,"Half of this movie is found on mischief. Too much girls, and little exciting cars.
Best part on this DVD is the bonus feature.",1070841600,,126,4.291666666666667
1255643,1,B00002NDLT,"Rutger Hauer must have been really hard-up or hankering for a little recognition to even bother making this awful movie! Frankly, I have never really thought much of Hauer. He appeared in ""Blade Runner""... So what!
This movie is so bad it's unwatchable!",1005264000,3,253,4.906976744186046
1255644,1,B00002NDLT,"OK I'm the first to admit this dvd is ... but unfortunately so are the actors and the production is not action but very bad impersantions of russians, the pic quality and sound are good but there is no plot to this film, you can normally show any cheap action movie to me and I will find some type of plot or enjoyment, however this is a very low budget ... movie, after watching for 45mins it was totally unbearable, if any one wants my copy please contact me with your details, its yours free because its truly ...",989971200,10,516,4.222222222222222

He is finding them.

Which one will he choose ?",1436486400,,75,4.357142857142857

7915973,5,B00002NDLT,"This movie has tons of plot holes.  Most doesn't make a lick of sense.  But.......

Super hot, vavoooooom!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yvonne Scio!!!!  Yes, she shows a lot and it's very, very nice with those luscious lips and gorgeous curly hair and those huge pair of....eyes.

Lots of other nekkid babes, too.",1392940800,,298,4.979591836734694
7915974,4,B00002NDLT,"However Yvonne Sci is absolutely STUNNING and topless. The film is imaginative and interesting, but simply lacks the funds to fully develop the idea.

It's a B movie trying really hard to look like an A film. But like I said, Yvonne Sci is worth the price of admission.",1361750400,,269,4.489795918367347
7915975,2,B00002NDLT,"The entire idea of this movie is absurd but the only good thing is the two stars and the nudity witin this movie. Otherwise, forget it.  There are other movies better written and acted.",1342137600,,185,4.4411764705882355
7915976,3,B00002NDLT,"Rutger Hauer plays John Wade, a black market game smuggler, who meets a fatal end in a Soviet statuary graveyard. His partner and assassin is Merrick, a violent gangster. Russian authorities discover Wade's body and reincarnate him despite the gunshot to his head. Please fantasize the Frankenstein castle as a an old Moscow apartment store and slim nurses dressed in red who kiss, lift his injured head so they can drop it on the hard bed.
It seems most young women in this post-Soviet future wear little or no clothes. Yvonne Scio's role is as Wade's: 1-late ex-girlfriend 2-a tough-but loveable whore 3-6 multi wigged variations of 1 & 2. Hazard a guess that Ms Scio plays many roles due to the production budget.
Merrick's partners are the Trioka. They seem to marinate in a huge Turkish pool in a Moscow somehow caught in an extended winter night. They own the military and police. They watch Most Wanted on giant Blade Runner style video screens; the poor people all own AK-47s. They chase Wade cos he's wanted.
Gee, what else can I say? Imagine enjoying Yvonne in states of undress as the reason for the rating.
As a used dvd you can watch Dacascos before the excellent ""Brotherhood Of The Wolf""-another reason for the rating!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brotherhood-of-the-Wolf-Director-s-Cut-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0019PL2P2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brotherhood of the Wolf - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>",1233619200,,1485,5.546255506607929
7915977,5,B00002NDLT,"Besides providing an entertaining vision of future Russia,Redline incorporates an enjoyable tale of one man's quest for revenge. If you like Blade Runner,Red Heat or even have a remote interest in Russia and SCI-FI ,then this movie will NOT dissapoint. I have been to Vladivostok,collect Soviet militaria and esoterica,and think that the director really captured the flavor of Russia in this film. The  Hind helicopter shots in the beginning are enough reason to buy this film! This movie is HIGHLY underrated and definitely a sleeper.",1165968000,2,535,5.294117647058823
7915978,5,B00002NDLT,"Sorry, this is an extremely imaginative film with at-times stunning visuals and a fun plot. The director is Eastern European and it shows--he cribs American film style like a master but mixes it only as an ex-Commie could. Hauer is, as always, solidly entertaining, the villain is villainous, and the depiction of the future decadent Russian society probably more dead-on than anyone would care to admit. There's a lot of sexy nudity in this and it's not gratuitous, it's just decadent. Don't let this film sink because a few killjoys don't find what they like in it!",1125014400,10,567,4.855670103092783
