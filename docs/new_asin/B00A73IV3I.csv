8547711,5,B00A73IV3I,"This lesser of the known Vietnam movies is without a doubt the best. It does not stylize, glamorize to make itself stand out. This movie is about the loss of our Heroes and how they sacrificed themselves for their fellow soldiers. They charge up the hill again and again with many of the characters being killed in the process of course knowing full well the futility of it all. It becomes a matter of pride and gets up close nasty and personal. All of the acting is superb. I still do not know how this movie gets overlooked.

The amazing thing about this movie is how REALISTIC the camaraderie between soldiers actually feels.

I bought the Italian Region B (i have a player) because I suppose the powers that be do not think its worth the transfer.

I total pity. If you get a chance to see this movie do so.",1409443200,2,811,4.357615894039735
