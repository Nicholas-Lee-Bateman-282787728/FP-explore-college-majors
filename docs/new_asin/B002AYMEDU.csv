8360596,2,B002AYMEDU,"This is a DVD of an old film from sometime in the 1980s. The film is often fuzzy or out of focus. The narration sounds like Wallace Shawn from Princess Bride, and sometimes comes across as condescending.  The first half visits many of the ruins and talks about early history, the second half visits various cities, markets, dances and customs.  I watched the whole thing, but did not find it impressive.",1515369600,,403,4.661971830985915
