8581935,1,B00CI39RHO,"The film opens with a diamond heist then switches quickly to a cocaine bust. Oh wait. The cocaine bust was just a way for to coerce The Merchant (Gabriel Byrne) to hire the diamond thief (Toby Stephens) by rogue members of Scotland Yard who want to use him for a robbery....I think.

The film consists of a confused mess that is hard to follow. The robbery appears to happen right before the cocaine bust, but in one conversation it was ""ago."" There are people whose brother was killed, dad was killed, and others seeking revenge having motives that pop out with no clarity. There is a long series of double crosses and relationships that are boring. I don't mind watching a film I have trouble keeping up with, but the film has to have some entertaining scenes along the way. This was filled with a long series of boring scenes of people talking, while robberies, killings, and chase scenes are abbreviated.

There are far better British ""thrillers"" out there.
