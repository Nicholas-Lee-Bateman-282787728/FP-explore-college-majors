7948321,2,B00005O5JL,"MEMORIAL DAY is one of Jeff Speakman's later movies.  Speakman looks a little out of shape and doesn't have much heart in his performance as Ed Downey, a former agent of The Agency, who has been placed in a mental institution because he knew about the Eagle satellite and it's laser shooting death ray.  Of course, now the Agency has him back, programmed to help in the assassination of presidential candidate Frederick Coffin.  Bruce Weitz plays Speakman's former mentor whose involvement in the conspiracy is predictable.  Stephanie Niznik (Looking a lot like Falcon Crest's Susan Sullivan) is the dedicated t.v. reporter who wants to crack the story.  Veteran actor Paul Mantee plays the corrupted general.

All in all, a derivative and not too exciting offering from the usually more interesting Speakman movies.",1096761600,,816,5.143939393939394
