3654889,4,B001JAHQ0C,"Ladies and Gentlemen:

The website tvshowsondvd.com announced a few days ago that Emergency! season 6 will be released on April 13, 2010.

Here's a few episodes of memory:

1. The guy who was launched into a tree when his son tied off his line to the bumper of his wife's van.

2. Gage and Desoto rescuing a guy off the observation tower at Ocean Lab Park (i.e. Marineland.

3. A few episodes featuring Craig Brice.  One I recall is where Robert's Rules of Order and parliamentary procedures are used on a paramedic committee - Bob Belleveau, a real Los Angeles County paramedic, acts in this episode.

4. An episode where Johnny and Roy are on a fishing/camping trip and help out a sheriff in a rural community.  This was a good depiction of bringing EMT's and paramedics out to rural areas, and the sheriff is motivated by Johnny and Roy to begin training a batch of EMT's.  (Remember -this was 1976).

5. Another episode worth recalling is when heavy  rains washed out the roads in one of the canyon areas of Los Angeles County.  Johnny and Roy end up at Fire Station 86 for a few days, and Station 86 becomes the family clinic.  They get standing orders via the biocom from Rampart.

Look forward to seeing this.  The tvshowsondvd.com article says that Universal Studios is being persuaded to release the six movies sometime in 2011, with a tentative title called, Emergency! - Movie Collection.",1263686400,30,1399,4.653061224489796
3654890,5,B001JAHQ0C,"I have loved this show ever since I saw it back in late 70's. It was a long time before I got hooked again.

It just so happened one day I was flipping channels and I passed a channel and I had heard something familiar. I flipped it back and low and behold it was Emergency.

It was one episode from the First season. All on rescues during a Brushfire in Las Plumas Canyon if that is correct.

I am really anxious for Season 6.  Been getting the seasons like clock work end of january the last few years. Always see it listed at Christmas time when looking for ideas for Christmas but this Christmas no posting for a release of this season.

But for Die Hard Emergency Fans this series is a Must Have and even for first timers you will love it.

I have to say was hooked on John Gage as I am sure many were. And have learned many things never knew like the capt. hammer in the first season was a real firefighter.  Didn't know that the one who was the Engineer/drove the engine was a real firefighter as well for a good while.  Or that the dispathcher was a true dispatcher.

But this is one TV show you can't stop watching.

Season 6 I hope will come soon.  So many episodes I have not seen in forever. And these on DVD replace some of my VHS tapes when I taped some of my favorite episodes.

I give this 5 stars and say if you don't have Emergency GET IT!!",1262995200,,1358,4.083018867924529
3654891,5,B001JAHQ0C,"Waiting for this final true season of Emergency! is hard, but well worth the wait! This is a show that has entertained us for over thirty years and it has NEVER lost it's appeal! It's the marking of a great show and wonderful cast and crew members.
Emergency! can never be copied because it was the first of it's kind and set such a high standard that so far no one else has lived up too and I seriously never think they will. JMHO",1258588800,3,431,4.142857142857143

3654949,5,B001JAHQ0C,"Unfortunately, I bought Season 6 AFTER buying seasons 3 & 4, THEN read the reviews & saw that I am going to be VERY disappointed in the quality, or LACK OF, with Seasons 3 & 4.
Now I'm hesitant about ordering the remaining seasons, as I would love to have the complete set.
What a HUGE disappointment, as we all enjoy this wonderful series & will be so sad  when it, inevitably, will be removed to make room for more inane idiocy like 'Mama's Family', or more ""reality"" wastes of time like ""Honey Boo Boo"", or ""Marriage Boot Camp"", or whatever will be next!
Anyhow, perhaps we'll be lucky, & when we open Seasons 3 & 4, some miracle will have happened & we will have gotten decent quality copies!
Here's hoping!

That brings up a great point. This show was made in the 70's before CGI was even thought of,  the special effects relied on different filming techniques and live action stunts which were great.  Despite all the technological shorrcongs they had some of the best pyrotechnics especially considering if was a weekly TV show.  Yes they put all the FX budget on the screen
 The show did not lack for action either.  Not only did Emergency introduce us to the paramedic, it also showed the beginnings of emergency trauma medicine.  It was a show for the times on the cutting edge of emergent care.",1435708800,3,725,4.488549618320611

3655269,4,B001JAHQ0C,"Gear up for groundbreaking action as this 1976-77 Season of EMERGENCY blazes a trail onto DVD for the first time and ride along with Los Angeles County Fire Depts. courageous paramedics Roy De Soto (Kevin Tighe) and John Gage (Randolph Mantooth) as they storm head first into the face of danger.

Aided by the heroic staff of Rampart General Hospital in L.A., including Nurse Dixie McCall (Julie London), Dr. Kelley Brackett(Robert Fuller), and Dr. Joe Early(Bobby Troup),they race to the rescue of L.A.'s most desperate citizens.

Featuring popular TV stars like Joanna Kerns from GROWING PAINS and Linda Gray from DALLAS and more.

These 24 gripping episodes of pulse-pounding action and heart-tugging drama are more enthralling than ever in this collectible 5-disc set.

This show takes me back to memory lane to when I was a kid and wanted to be a paramedic and watched it in reruns on ME-TV and TV Land along with ADAM-12 and DRAGNET, which have now moved to COZI-TV.

BTW, Warner Bros.is finally releasing CHiPs-Season 3 on DVD on Tuesday March 3, 2015.",1389657600,,1059,4.926966292134831

I just wish it hadn't been the ""final season.""  The movies that followed just were not the same, and some of them barely even had Johnny and Roy in them at all.  Still I bought them anyway.

I went to a fire station some years ago, because one of my roommates got a ring stuck on her finger and she wanted it off.  You used to be able to go there for something like that.

3655320,5,B001JAHQ0C,"Sadly, this was the final season!  Yet it contained some good episodes...three of them prominently featured Michael Norell (otherwise known as Captain Stanley)!
Norell had quite a flair for slapstick comedy which resulted in three very funny episodes: Insanity Epidemic,  Hypochondri Cap, and Upward and Onward.  Welcome to Santa Rosa County also was well-written and stressed the need for good medical care in a remote area.  Humor seemed to be prevalent in several other episodes....this season
showed stories on the lighter side of life, and showed more interaction between the staff of Station 51!  If I had any reservations, it would be that the season ended without any closure......and suddenly there was the movie, The Final Rescues, and Gage and DeSoto were promoted to Captains.  How did the transition happen....we never found out!  They were Paramedics and then they were Captains!  The crew at 51 vanished...only to be seen in flashbacks.  What an opportunity was missed when a whole possible storyline was never produced.  Very sad!  The same thing happened with the Pilot film....except Station 51 was introduced....but hurriedly with very little tranistion as well!
This is common.....events happen and one never sees how it all started and never saw the develpment of the story.  I liked the crew at 51 and thought they worked well suppementing the major stars....especially Mike Stoker who gained more ease with his lines and performance as the series progressed.  He had less performance time because he, being an actual firefighter, was often on duty during filming.  I was happy to see his presence increased with time and he was given more spoken lines.
That I liked the series is evident.....not every episode though!  Randy Mantooth once said,""this was the little show that wouldn't die"".  It worked....despite contrivance, technical errors, silliness, and cost-cutting.  But we liked the characters, the good writing and acting, the humor, the compassion, the use of actors from different ethnic groups, and the realism of life itself.",1369526400,7,2060,5.269938650306749

All of the actors were wonderful, especially Randolph Mantooth and Kevin Tighe.  There were so many special guest stars, too.  Reminds me of shows like Fantasy Island and Murder She Wrote where you were able to see stars that had great careers before and after this show aired.

I would also watch The Rockford Files too another great series from the 70's. If you would like to see how our Paramedic program got it's start, Emergency is the series for you. Our medical technology has changed since the series came out, but it is still a great series to watch. I recommend this series to anyone who has ever been in the Fire/Police service or anyone who loves medical dramas; this series has it all and it will not disappoint.

Randolph Mantooth & Kevin Tighe were great! It's one of the very few shows that I still enjoy seeing again after all these years. I like it just as much now as I did then. The modern shows have a lot of who's sleeping with whom, etc. There's none of that in Emergeny.  It's a great show!",1360108800,,458,3.913978494623656

3655354,4,B001JAHQ0C,"Season 6 ends the series with solid performances and the great chemistry we've come to expect over the years. The profession of emergency medicine continues to mature and develop, including many procedures and techniques we take for granted. It's still amazing to watch this and realize all the EMS infrastructure we take for granted- or complain about when it's lacking- was either brand new or still in development at the time this show aired...

My only gripe is that these are fairly basic DVDs with no extras. I'm not a big fan of commentaries anyway, but I'd love to know about how they filmed many of the rescues. Plane in tree? Climbers on hilltop? Worker on tall oil tank? The distant shots are obviously on location, but what about the close-up shots of Roy and Johnny? Sound stage or on location with a shooting platform? (Someone help me out here...) Would've been nice to know some of this. Also the stations and/or rescues- Station 51 was located in Carson, but they seemed to answer calls all over the county. So where was that boat rescue? Anyway, it's a minor gripe, but I feel enough of one to drop to a 4-star rating.",1357516800,4,1136,4.623762376237623

3655402,5,B001JAHQ0C,"Emergency!  You just have to love it and season six delivers in a big way.  The episodes are excellent, the rescues are more exciting than ever, and the special effects (explosions and such) are fantastic.  Furthermore, the sound and picture quality is far superior to seasons four and five. (During season four I had to have my television set turned up all the way to even understand what they were saying!)

If you grew up watching Emergency!, you know that it is much more than a television show.  Johnny and Roy become a part of your life and you find yourself thinking about being a Paramedic.  You probably did it as a kid, and will do it again as an adult.

Let me put it this way...I am 44 years old and recently sold my small business.  I have an appointment at a local college in a few weeks to check out their Paramedic program.

They usually had great success on their calls but now and then, they lost folks as you would expect.  No blood and guts but you could feel the drama as it unfolded.  Sometimes it was a little bit corny and only showed the ""good"" in people but usually very realistic and suitable for the whole family. i will buy every season that is released as soon as it is available and can hardly wait for the next round.",1285977600,,549,4.300970873786408
3655406,5,B001JAHQ0C,"Okay, perhaps not technically the last season, as there were some TV movies later on. But still, this was basically the last full season and in a lot of ways, it's the best.

No, probably not in the rescues and action. Indeed, they seem to have run out of ideas, repeating some things from earlier episodes.

But there is just a sense of fun. Most of the focus on this season is with the firemen, not the Hospital. So with the added time and emphasis, you get more about them. Including the captain's descent into paranoia about the new Fire Chief (which doesn't sound funny, but is hilarious in practice), to a episode where much of it is about the guys playing in a basketball game (again, amusingly, Chet turns out to be their secret weapon).

It's probably not for people who aren't fans of the show, but if you ever loved this show, then this season is a must buy.",1283385600,,869,4.385093167701863

From the long sideburns to the totally garish (by today's standards) outfits it's a marvelous snapshot of that wonderful time.  The action may not be 'realistic' enough for the kids of today but it was plenty realistic for their parents.  Not to put kids down, but the technology just wasn't there at that time.

3655441,5,B001JAHQ0C,"I hope the rumor of the movies out next year is true!  It will make my Emergency! collection complete!

However, how can you neglect to mention the episode in Season 6 where Dr. Kelly Bracket is involved in a car crash that kills the drive of the other vehicle and leaves the child riding in that vehicle unwilling/unable to speak!?  Classic episode.

Now if only they will pickup on the release of CHiPs seasons.  It stands at two seasons released.  Not even halfway through!

Love Emergency! however.  FF/PM Roy DeSoto and FF/PM Johnny Gage were two characters that always gave their all to save the victim.  We could do with more shows like this on today's airwaves and a lot less of the ""reality shows"" that have consumed the TV lineups in past years....",1272844800,9,758,4.597014925373134
3655442,5,B001JAHQ0C,"At last, we have a season with decent video and sound. I watch the show all the time with my 4 year old son and we were so used to the lousy transfers, as we go through season six it seems kind of weird having decent quality.

That said, all six seasons are worth every penny for good family entertainment. My son loves to watch ""Fire Truck Show"" with me. Our car is the ""engine"" thus he has declared that I am Stoker, Mom is Capt. Stanley, and he is Lopez. He used to be Chet Kelly, but switched over to Lopez after he found out nobody likes Chet's cooking.

We love racing to be the first to call out ""danglers""(one of the hundreds of Emergency! rescues where they have to save someone dangling from some tall tower, crane, power line, bridge, building, tree, etc.)

The other day, Johnny and Roy were working on a patient and my son said, ""Dad, I think he's throwing PVC's"" (premature ventricular contractions). So funny!

Great Show!

3655443,5,B001JAHQ0C,"Love emergency.  I used to watch it when I was a kid.  I watch it now I still love it.  The only problem I have with this series.  The way they end the series I was dissappointed.  The end is bad.  They do what they normally do go to a rescue and when they are done they are leaving and taking him to the hospital.  They don't even get him downstairs before they ended the espoide.  It is a pretty lame ending to on of my best tv series in my opinion, But I still love to watch it.",1272067200,,481,3.787878787878788

3655445,5,B001JAHQ0C,This has always been an excellent show. But the first five seasons dvds were not produced as clean as this sixth season release. Finally remastered color and sound and boy this season looks great the reds look red and nice flesh skin tones and the blues look cool. Nice job on this seasons batch and its about time I can really enjoy this season immensely.,1271808000,,356,4.492307692307692

3655447,5,B001JAHQ0C,"I am very pleased with the new Emergency! Season six DVD set.  The video and audio quality are beautiful this time.  Wow!  They have also added back material that I suppose was cut for expanded commercial time.  There are scenes in some of these shows I have never viewed before.

I adore Emergency, and like many I have loved it since the original air in the 1970's.  I hope Universal will do as much justice to the ""made for TV movies"" or Season 7 as they have done for season six.  It would be nice to see some bonus material next time too.  The crossover episode from Sierra would be nice, and some cast interviews would be awesome.  I would also enjoy seeing Universal include the blooper reels in the final release.

Season six is a hit with me.  Nice job Universal.  Can we get a repeat on the last installment!",1271808000,,818,4.344370860927152

3655479,5,B001JAHQ0C,One of my favorite shows.  I have all of the DVD's.  Good value and quick shipping.,1271289600,,83,4.125
3655480,5,B001JAHQ0C,"I've been collecting the EMERGENCY! DVDs since they started releasing them about 5 years ago, and I've been sorely disappointed by the picture and sound quality of the episodes on the DVDs during the last few seasons.  The prints appeared to be taken from 16MM prints (scratched and beat to hell, riddled with green lines and splices), and the audio was pretty muddy and scratchy.

Well, I'm pleased to say that it appears Universal finally listened, because these Season 6 DVD prints look and sound amazing!  They have clearly gone and remastered these new digital transfers, possibly even in high definition, and the audio is crisp and clear.  My only quibble is that they have crammed 5 episodes to a disc for this 5-disc set, which is a bit much, but even so, it doesn't appear to have affected the stunning video and audio quality.

The episodes themselves are entertaining as always;  this is one show that seemed to get better and more interesting with each season.  There's lots of great character interaction, the rescues are very exciting and well-staged, and there's a new face in the firehouse this season--that of a basset hound who makes the station's couch his home.  It's nice to see a show go out at the top of its game writing-wise, and as everyone knows, this was Emergency's final season (to be followed by a series of TV movies, which Universal is supposedly going to release as well).

I highly recommend Season 6 both in terms of DVD quality and the show's content!  Thanks again Universal for doing justice to this last season, and hopefully they treat the TV movies just as well.",1271116800,5,1604,4.737410071942446
3655481,5,B001JAHQ0C,"For those of us who have collected Emergency for the past 4 years on DVD, We have had our nastolgia ruined when it came to half of Season 3 ,and all of seasons 4 and 5 by Universal releasing crap syndicated ,wrong opening titles from season six, versions of these classic great series. We screamed bloody murder to Universal when season three was released, and they gave us all crappy versions when it came to seasons 4 and 5, I thought to myself , knowing our luck , they would have finally give us proper versions when it comes to season six, well guess what folks? unbelieveable! all the episodes from this release of season six are restored beautifully sound and picture quality looks fantastic, so why am I still complaining you ask? Why couldn't they have done this when we asked them to fix seasons four and five? Now will they go back and restore and rerelease the previous seasons with original openeing themes? one can hope , so it's obvious that universal had listened to us eventually, too bad it took them long enough. So to Glenn and all the others E! fans who screamed with me. This is definitly a great dvd release. And at least the whole series on dvd isn't quite in vain. Enjoy everyone!",1271116800,3,1205,4.4818181818181815
3655482,5,B001JAHQ0C,"I was amazed to find this on the shelf about a week ago at a local mall.  They put it out early and initially they were not going to sell it to me.  I complained to the manager and she said since it was out, they had to sell it to me!  Great episodes!  I have all of the other accompanying seasons.  Emergency fans- this is a MUST have!  The quality is fantastic and of course the episodes are classic.  Buy it ASAP!

I have no problem with the quality of the videos. Back in the 70's I usually watched the show on a 15 inch black and white TV. So to see it in color is great! This is a show I can let my kids watch. It is wholesome, still educational, and I'm not nervous about inappropriate material suddenly popping up on the screen. Thanks Universal.",1267142400,35,513,4.03921568627451

I really cool. I never forgot it really long year ago. I has DVD season 1 to 5 Emergency, also I ordered a season 6. I can`t wait to see it also watch little boy fell on water on season 6.",1266883200,,589,4.0
3655485,5,B001JAHQ0C,"Emergency is one of those shows that really stands well with the test of time. The characters have been developed as well as they can be, the so called rescue of the week is different but predictable before the program ends. After all 122 episodes for a show that didn't place in the top 10 is not bad at all. IMDb and [...] has a complete listing of all the individual episodes. A few episode standouts are: Welcome to Santa Rosa County, Hypochondri-Cap, Rules of Order.

The DVD set should still be in the traditional slim-jim packaging with single side DVD. Universal for once listened to fans and dropped the ""flippers"" after season 1. It's to bad if this set follows the past two sets the film quality will be sup-par, I hope that isn't the case. I think the negative feedback has to do more with the sub-par print than whether are not it's of HD caliber. It's quite obvious that to Universal all sets are not created equal. Just imagine how this series would be if it was of the same caliber as the highly acclaimed re-imaged series Battlestar Galactica. I wish all TV DVD set / series could be of the same quality as BSG, Star Trek: TOS blu-ray edition for example even the audio. Who wouldn't like a DTS are Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track on this series. Why couldn't Universal hand this over to Liberation (Daniel Boone TV DVD Sets) are Shout Factory (Adam-12 starting with season 2) and let them do the release. It will be interesting to see who handles the ""Made-for-TV Movies"". It would also be nice to have some bonus materials.

However, no matter the way it's treated, it's great to have this program out on DVD. Hey, maybe the ""Made-for-TV Movies"" will find their way to Blu-ray; we can only hope. Once again: great series, hopefully a slightly better DVD release set, more than 5 stars this deserves. To Universal, please don't let us fans wait too along for the Emergency ""Made-for-TV Movies"" and please release them in air date order an unedited (not 2 parters as aired on on  TV Land).

3655486,5,B001JAHQ0C,"I've been waiting for Season 6 for quite a long time, I'm glad they are finally releasing.  I am one of the fortunate ones to have seen the show when it was on orignally, but I was a little young to remember everything detail, so I'm glad they are being released on DVD, brings back a lot of memories.  And by the way it is nothing like the hospital shows that are on now, like Grey's Anatomy and ER, where there is so much sex.  The show was light drama with a little comedy thrown in.

For you people who complain about the picture quality of every emergency saeson please pipe it down. There wasn't HD back then, it was a classic 70's show and i enjoy seeing it the way it was shown on tv back in the 70's.
