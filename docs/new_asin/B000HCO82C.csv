8138435,3,B000HCO82C,"Clearly no one is going to pick up a DVD titled ""Ninja Vixens - Vixen Dropouts"" and expect a masterpiece.  I always compare this series to the light-hearted sex comedies from the 80's, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ski-School/dp/B000QQML4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ski School</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/H-O-T-S/dp/B000OYCMLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">H.O.T.S.</a>.  They are cheesy, but fun.

This entry follows the N-team, who are the lowest on the totem pole for the Ninja Vixens squad.  Here are all the misfits who just couldn't quite make the regular team.  You know, the fat girl, the ugly girl, the hot-but-still-somehow-a-misfit girl...all the usual characters.  No matter how hard they try, they just can't quite seem to master the secret techniques and become full-fledged Ninja Vixens.  That is, of course, until one of their members (who is also the sexiest gal on the squad) gets brutally attacked, and it is time for the N-Class to show what they got and take revenge.

I enjoy the ""Ninja Vixens"" series because I know exactly what I am getting myself into.  Some funny slapstick comedy and some pretty naked girls are all I really require.  I have always been impressed by the production values in this series, as they are actually quite good for this kind of B-movie pink film.

This film, ""Vixen Dropouts"", is pretty standard, and I had a good time.  Focusing on the misfits meant not so much naked hot girls and far more slapstick comedy than I have seen in some of the others.  The jokes are actually pretty funny, and I got some laughs.

There are a few wasted moments.  I think for the first time in the entire series we get a group-bath scene with no nudity!  But there are a few choice moments that show the producers haven't forgotten what the series is all about.

Since the release of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/complete-box-set/dp/B001K98M5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">complete box set</a>, there is no real reason to pick these up individually.  That is clearly the way to go.  If your expectations aren't too high, you can have some fun with these flicks.",1235692800,5,2250,5.642857142857143
8138436,1,B000HCO82C,"This is not a cool movie.  It was made for, apparently, six hundred dollars, and it is neither titillating, action-packed, or cool.  Don't buy this, unless you love regret.",1220659200,,172,4.896551724137931
