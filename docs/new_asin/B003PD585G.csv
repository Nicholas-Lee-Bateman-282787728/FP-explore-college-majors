Werner Herzhog made a name for himself filming unmedicated bipolar Klaus go bonkers and attack cast and crew while the cameras rolled. This moving is so boring, long and dull. Its a movie about a mental patient made staring another self absorbed lunatic. And they're German which is even more exhausting. Herzog owes every actor and crew member who ever stepped foot on his set a massive apology and a severance package. There are many stories out there of how abusive and violent Kinski was towards people on the set, going so far allegedly as wounding an indigenous actor in this very piece of crap film. What an indulgent piece of crap.

4164475,5,B003PD585G,"This is one of the greatest movies ever made. Not only is it well made, and well acted, with beautiful art direction, and stunning scenery, but it is also a strange instance of the movie being a monument to itself and to Werner Herzog. The real story is the dream of a man to do the impossible, and that is Herzog wanting to move a giant boat over a mountain. The story is inspired by a real life historical figure who did something similar, but Herzog used a boat 3 times bigger than the historical boat, and he did it without dismantling the boat, whereas the historical figure had the ship broken apart, transported over land, and reassembled on the other side. And so this movie is an artistic capture of Herzog doing the most insane thing anyone has ever done, doing the impossible, while also making a masterful film at the same time.

Kinski is a mad genius, and the story of how he came to be involved in this production is fascinating. It was pure luck that we get to see this movie as it is. It is a treasure. I would recommend seeing it multiple times, in both languages. While the ""original"" language is German, this is kind of misleading. The actors spoke English on film, and then later went back and overdubbed the dialogue in both languages, due to difficulty in getting good audio quality on set in the jungle. Kinski did his overdubbing in English, so that's really his voice in the England soundtrack. So there is definitely authenticity to the English Language version, no less so than in the German soundtrack.",1501200000,,1531,4.527075812274369

Taken as a whole ( the movie and the insightful and entertaining  commentary by Herzog)  the viewing makes a powerful impression.  I guess I am left wondering if Kinski, the actor, could have been as severely temperamental as indicated by the director.  As an actor, he appears in virtually every scene and certainly the film revolves entirely around his character's strange obsession with building an opera house in the jungle.  A bizarre but compelling film.  I should not fail to add that when it comes to filming on location, this movie has to be a model for posterity.  .",1483747200,2,722,4.900826446280992

Herzog is absolutely all in, and Klaus Kinski remains charistmatic in a completely demented way all his own.  I saw this streaming through Amazon Prime and the visual quality is pretty awful.  It would be nice to see this in a theatre in a really crisp print.  Even though Fitzcarraldo doesn't attain his goal--having Caruso sing at the opening of an opera house in the remote Amazon town where rubber barons have buckets of money but no cultural life at all--he triumphs in the end.  Herzog's book on the making of the movie, ""Conquesrt of the Useless"", is an indispensable aid.  There's a lot to reflect on here--love (between people), wealth, a passion for art, the ""uselessness"" of art in a world that understands no other value, grit and determination, the interaction of cultures that are as alien and possible with a nearly insuperable communication barrier, etc. etc.  As I say, a movie to see, think about, and savor.",1483401600,4,1002,4.757225433526012

4164506,5,B003PD585G,"I have had this movie on my Amazon wish list for quite a long time.  The movie is recommended on search list I found online and I was intriqued with the plot summary.  My wife purchased the movie as a gift for me.  I was hesitant to open the DVD because the only language on the packaging is Spanish.  I returned to the Amazon listing and could find no description of the language on the DVD; the only mention of language is that subtitles are in Spanish.  I opened the DVD and popped it in.  English is the language on the DVD--whew!!!

The story is a good one.  Klaus Kinski, with whatever issues he had in life and rumors of issues with the making of this movie, is a good actor.  He is convincing as a man on an obsessive mission and one driven to achieve what he sees is his life's work.  Other reviews I've read indicate the film is too slow and plodding.  To me, the cadence of the film is just right to convey the character's relentless resolve, in the face of multiple obstacles, to achieve what he sets out to do.  Just like in life, one sets out to achieve a goal, chase a purpose, and maybe the achievement of that intention doesn't look exactly like the picture of the goal at the outset but, nevertheless, the goal is achieved.  I found it easy to get buy into the narrative and get lost in the fictive dream of this picture.",1451606400,7,1339,4.224409448818897
4164507,5,B003PD585G,"Warning: there are some spoilers ahead in this review

This two and a half hour German film released in 1982 is one of Werner Herzogs best movies. It reads mostly as a homage to crazy visionaries, people whom Herzog clearly identifies with. Based on a true story, but taking considerable liberties with the truth, this film tells the story of one Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald (Klaus Kinski, who is terrific), an opera mad Irish entrepreneur living in Iquitos, in the Peruvian Amazon in the late 19th century. Fitzgerald was called Fitzcarraldo by the locals, who found his original name difficult to pronounce. A plan by him to build a railway crossing the Andes had failed, and his next project of making ice wasn't going anywhere. After a talk with a rubber baron, he came up with a new plan: to exploit rubber in a very remote part of the Amazon rainforest and with the profits made from the venture build an opera house in Iquitos. For that purpose, he buys a river boat with money from the madam of a brothel (played by Claudia Cardinale) who sympathizes with him. He hires a rowdy crew to accompany him in his boat to his jungle tract, including a nearsighted captain, a drunken cook and a giant Indian called Cholo. Now, the area where he had the concession to exploit rubber trees could only be accessed through a river with impossible rapids to cross. But a navigable river ran nearby, and he came up with the idea of carrying the whole boat between the rivers with the help of nearby Indians. Only problem, those Indians were hostile head hunters, known to kill previous trespassers in the area. And to make things worse, the terrain where the portage of the boat took place was not plain but was rather a steep hill (apparently, the real Fitzcarraldo did carry a boat through a hill, only he disassemble first into pieces, and later assemble it back in the nearby river).

In a superb extended scene, Fitzcarraldo manages to get the Indians to carry the boat to the other river, but afterwards, things start unraveling badly. But just when the film looks like is going to have a downbeat ending, Herzog pulls out a surprisingly heartwarming finale, which I won't reveal here but in which Fitzcarraldo partly fullfills his dreams - though some reviewers find it anticlimactic compared with the scene of the boat going up the hill.

Originally Jason Robards was going to play Fitzcarraldo, with Mick Jagger playing his sidekick. Eventually, Robards got a tropical disease during the filming and had to bow out on medical advice, and Jagger also abandoned the shooting due to his musical commitments with the Rolling Stones (by the way, there is some footage around the Internet showing Robards and Jagger playing their characters and is clear that they would have been dreadful in the movie). Herzog decided to call Kinski, who doesnt look Irish at all, but had the right crazy intensity for the character, while writing off Jaggers roler. By casting Kisnki, the movie turn into a German speaking film, which looks incongruous in a film set in the Peruvian Amazon, though you will eventually suspend your disbelief.",1445904000,12,3120,4.784786641929499
4164508,4,B003PD585G,"Blu-ray: Nothing exceptional, but still a very good Shout Factory 1080/24p transfer with clean 5.1 DTS-HD master audio Factory.

If you're expecting a fast-paced action adventure film with spectacular special effects and stunt action, look elsewhere. This is not an Indiana Jones movie. It may be an Adventure genre, but it's a Drama and most definitely NOT an Action film. Anyone familiar with Joseph Conrad's novella, Heart of Darkness, Herzog's previous 1972 film, Aguirre, the Wrath of God, or Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 Apocalypse Now, will see parallels between the novella and all these films. While Conrad's novella combined with visual elements of Herzog's 1972 film inspired his Apocalypse Now, I don't know how much the Conrad novella set along the Congo River in Africa influenced Herzog. The story is the journey, and the arduousness of the lengthy journey. In this case it's along two rivers and winching a nearly 400 ton 1900 era iron steamship over a tall mountain separating two major Amazon tributaries. It's not about the destination, although the final few minutes provides closure to Fitzcarraldo's primary motive for moving a steamship over a mountain.

The movie is very loosely based on the real story of Carlos Fitzcarrald, who actually did portage an entire river steamship over a mountain separating two Amazon Basin rivers. Aside from that, the movie diverges considerably from the real life Carlos Fitzcarrald, a Peruvian of American descent. The film's character, Fitzcarraldo, is Irish, played by Klaus Kinski, an actor with a madman personality (very hard to deal with on set), but one that was needed for Herzog's obsession driven madman. ""Fitzcarraldo"" is a Spanishized ""Fitzgerald"" as the Peruvians had difficulty pronouncing his Irish name correctly. Herzog's character is fanatically driven by a desire to bring European culture in the form of opera into the Amazon Basin jungle being developed with plantations by the turn of the century rubber boom. His attempt to build a cross-continent railway failed in bankruptcy, so he convinces his lover to invest all her savings into a steamship and a land claim that will allow harvesting raw rubber to make him as wealthy as the other rubber plantation barons. The singular purpose is to build an opera house into which he can book European opera troupes for performances like those being done down river in Manaus. The problem is transporting the raw rubber harvested from the rubber trees from his land claim to a location where it can be exported, a claim for which he paid a sizable sum to the Peruvian government. He needs a river steamship, and it needs to be upstream from some rapids. To get one there, he takes the steamship he has bought upstream to a point where the two rivers are separated by a short distance overland where a 350 ton iron steamship scale portage can move it between the two rivers. In addition, the claim must be productively working (in this case to produce raw rubber) or he loses his rights to it. Unfortunately, the short distance is a steep mountain, but Fitzcarraldo, with a civil engineering background, is undaunted, driven by his vision for an opera house. Like his earlier Aguirre, the Wrath of God (1972), Herzog shot the movie on location, in the Amazon Basin, in itself a magnificently arduous task, especially considering the boat winched up and down the mountain was no model. It was a very real, full-size, roughly 350 ton, river steamboat. As with his Aguirre, the film moves at a modest pace, allowing the audience to take in and absorb the lengthy river journey and the Amazon Basin's jungle wilderness. The opera house in Manaus is real, and it was built by the rubber plantation barons in the same era in which the film is set (circa 1900).

I give it 4 stars for its production values, cinematography, screenplay, editing and the film that resulted. It's the story of a man obsessed, or perhaps a madman singularly possessed with the dream of making enough money from raw rubber to build an opera house and bring European opera to his remote region of the Amazon River Basin.

8401966,5,B003PD585G,"Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo may be remembered as the film wherein he lifted a steamboat over a mountain while fighting off bugs, disease, famine, and Klaus Kinski trying to kill everyone, but it is precisely because of his obsessive persistence in completing the film that Fitzcarraldo is remarkable. It is a parallel on film of Herzog's struggles in finishing the filming of Fitzcarraldo much like Klaus Kinski's character's obsession with opera that leads him to undertake his Amazonian expedition for rubber to fund his opera house.

Herzog appears to have perfected his artistic film-making style from the years doing Aguirre: The Wrath of God & Nosferatu the Vampyre, for Fitzcarraldo is immaculately filmed. Gorgeous scenery, shots of the boats, close ups showing so much emotion and turmoil. Herzog's penchant for showing natives, animals, and nature in their natural surroundings with real reactions is on full display. His cinematography is truly astounding and a wonder to look at in Fitzcarraldo.

This film utilizes its theme of opera's drama and intensity with its lush sets, real props, atmospheric music as well as operatic performances within the film itself. Herzog's diegetic sounds are audible throughout the movie. The actors bring the Peruvian jungle to life. Claudia is particularly persuasive in the first half where she is present.

Then, Klaus Kinski, as usual in Herzog's films, is the main attraction. Kinski's method acting as the totally obsessed Fitzcarraldo is utterly brilliant and hypnotic. His wild eyes view over all as all he hears is his opera. Opera is his passion and motivation. Kinski portrays this brilliantly. I understand Herzog had to deal with Klaus Kinski going nuts in the jungle in order to film this, but perhaps, it was worth it for Fitzcarraldo is Herzog's masterpiece. Kinski wants his opera house, and he will stop at nothing for that musical bliss.

I recommend seeing at least watching Fitzcarraldo for its achievement in the perseverance of making the film as well as its insane charms as a stand alone Werner Herzog piece. Art films have been filmed that are more mad, but none have been filmed with the same mad drive of Herzog to complete the one and only Fitzcarraldo.",1505260800,,2230,5.118131868131868

I'm shocked that Herzog was ever able to make a film like this, but I'm glad that he did. To truly appreciate the film, you must also watch the documentary, ""Burden of Dreams.""
