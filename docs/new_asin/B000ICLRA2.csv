Probably many people have heard of the embryonic ""original version"" of the Verdi Requiem, although that is a gross oversimplification.  In fact, Verdi had only composed the last movement (of 13 movements), and invited 12 other Italian composers to join him in this project to honor the recently departed Rossini.  The performance was to take place on the one-year anniversary, in 1869, of Rossini's death.  Only the project never panned out and perhaps, it is assumed by many, it was only an idea and the music was never actually composed.

Well, in fact the music was composed, by all 13 composers.  But for reasons that are not entirely clear, the planned performance never took place, and the score was scattered and all but lost.  That is, until 1986, when it was painstakingly tracked down, reassembled, edited, rehearsed, and had its PREMIERE performance in 1988, only 119 years late!

And who pray tell was one of the main driving forces behind this immense project?  Was it a Verdi or Rossini man, one of the Italian impresarios, perhaps the direttori of La Scala?  No, it was none other the Bach specialist, Helmuth Rilling!

Now there's a name that strikes at least some respect, and possibly a great deal of admiration, or more likely dread, in the modern choral aficionado's ears.  Rilling's Bach interpretations are highly honed refinements of those most favored at least two full generations ago, with a large mixed chorus and orchestra, using modern instruments.  Now I say this with great respect, but I am afraid it is an undeniable fact, that hardly anybody nowadays ""prefers"" Rilling's Bach to any other available in 2016, and I am afraid the situation was essentially the same in 1988, when this Italian Requiem was taped.  One would have to go back to about 1968, when something like the following conversation might be heard:  ""Oh, I like Karl Richter, sure, but I do like Rilling better, he's not as mannered.  I certainly like him a lot better than what's-his-name, Harnoncourt-- have you heard that nasty new style using original instruments and boys choir only?  Ugh!""

Now I would like to hastily add, in case there are any out there who smugly say, ""Well, I would maybe like to hear this piece, but I would NEVER touch anything by Rilling with a 10-foot baton"" ... for your own benefit, please be disabused.  There is nothing in here that sounds anything like a Bach cantata, overblown or otherwise.  It is an extremely competent, decent, international version of a great classic, or what should be a great classic.  I don't even recall any Germanicized Latin (although I will listen again to make sure of this particularly bold statement).

THE MUSIC IS DIVINE!  You will hear composers that you have never heard before, and they are all excellent!  Why aren't most of these names mainstream, I do not know!!!

The picture and sound from 1988 are nothing to be feared.  The technology is the finest of what the era had to offer, which is excellent.  It is a studio-quality recording, done in a church with no audience present.  It is hard to imagine the technical aspects of the recording being any better.

There are a few minor things I could nitpick here and there if I wanted.  So what?  Where is there a 2-hour performance that someone could not nitpick?  It is not the kind of work I would choose to nitpick, and also, it is too historically valuable.

Even Kultur, that much maligned label, has done itself proud.  And finally, I am most happy to state, there are no sound on video synchronization problems, as so many DVDs have.

So in a word it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, and in two words, it is one the very favorite classical DVDs I own out of many hundreds.",1477958400,,3771,4.7315950920245395
8145135,5,B000ICLRA2,"This work, in color with English sub tittles, is indexed for each of the thirteen composers represented. It would have been performed earlier right after Rossini's death were it not for the wrangling over who would conduct the work and the subsequent Italian independence. There is an interview with the conductor in the middle of the film.",1436313600,,340,4.982456140350878
8145136,5,B000ICLRA2,"Let me begin with a disclaimer.  i am not here to trash this recording, but to praise it to the skies.
First, this is a piece that did not see the light of day until it was redescovered in the 1970's.  Second, it is a daring concept by our beloved Verdi: to have thirteen composers write the parts for a Requiem honoring the recently deceased Rossini (imagine a poem writen by an equal number of poets).  Third: Benackova, Wagner and Rolling, all of whom participated in the world premiere of the piece.  Quivar, Agache and Haugland show world class voices as the remainder of the cast. What amazed me was the sychronicity of the music-- it becomes a coordinated whole (in spite of the many cooks). The bonus is quite detailed, providing a history of the piece and its reconstruction.  I loved it, but to judge by yourself , you must buy it!",1402185600,,841,4.470588235294118
