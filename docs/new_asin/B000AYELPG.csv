2397144,4,B000AYELPG,"John Leguizamo (Land of the Dead, Summer of Sam)  plays Manolo Bonilla, a Miami news reporter who is down in Ecuador with his crew Marisa, played by Leonor Watling (Talk To Her, My Life Without Me) and Ivan, played by Jose Maria Yazpik.  A family is having a funeral when suddenly their other son falls in front of a car and suddenly dies. The owner of the vehicle, Vinicio Cepeda, played by Damian Alcazar, is dragged out of his car, burnt and beaten. While Cepeda is locked up, he tells Leguizamo that he has met the ""Monster"", a killer who strikes against children,  and he has told him of ""The Monster"" crimes and what he had done with all his victims. His makes Leguizamo suspicious of Cepeda because he thinks that he is the ""Monster"" and he's just giving him a croc story. Cepeda also tells him that he knows that there is another body at the gravesite where the cops found the rest of the bodies, so Leguizamo goes and it is actually true. Leguizamo then builds a story for the news that makes Cepeda look like an innocent man and he did not kill the child, which boosts Leguizamo's star power in the News place. A powerful thriller/drama, this movie gives Leguizamo to speak in his tongue and he's the only one who speaks English in this movie and he also gives a superb performance. Also starring Alfred Molina (Coffee and Cigarettes, Spider-Man 2) as Victor, the news anchor of the TV News show and he only is in this very little.",1134172800,,1441,4.450757575757576
2397145,4,B000AYELPG,"Crnicas is a terse, highly atmospheric movie that begins with a terrific idea but then doesn't seem to now where to go with it. The director Sebastin Cordero himself admits that the ending was nebulous until one of the actors (Leonor Watling) suggested a way to make the film work.  The notes for the alternative ending demonstrate how flimsy this screenplay was, even into the final edit.  So it is a film that begins well then loses its way in the mud of Ecuador.

Manolo Bonilla (John Leguizamo), a upwardly mobile TV journalist seeking stardom,  has traveled to Ecuador with his assistant Marisa Iturralde (Leonor Watling) and cameraman Ivan Suarez (Jos Mara Yazpik) to cover the story of the 'Monster of Babahoyo', a serial rapist and murderer of small children.  As they are filming a strange man Vinicio Cepeda (Damin Alczar) has wandered into town and during the paparazzi effect of Bonilla's crew filming the mass funeral of the latest victims of the 'Monster'. Vinicio inadvertently runs over the twin of one of the victims resulting in an outrage by the father of the twins and a beating of Vinicio.  Both are jailed and Manolo learns from the incarcerated Vinicio that he has secrets about the Monster.  Seeing the chance for a 'Big Story' that will assure his stardom Manolo pursues the fragments of evidence about the Monster until little by little he 'uncovers' the truth.  And the truth is terrifying.

Along the bumpy script road there is a love affair between Marisa (Ivan's girl!) and Manolo, communications with the Miami TV show Victor Hugo Puente (Albert Molina, whom we only see on a TV screen), and distractions from the townspeople and police.  At times the storyline feels so jumbled that it is difficult to keep characters and motivations straight.  But in the end this is a rather powerful indictment about the TV/media aggressive insertion into global reporting and the questionable ethics involved.  The cast is strong, making the best of a mediocre script.  The camera work seems to enjoy the endless preoccupation with poverty and inclement weather and the bleak atmosphere becomes wearing.  This is a film with a good idea that just becomes a bit crippled in production.  Grady Harp, November 05",1131667200,2,2228,4.919786096256685

2397147,5,B000AYELPG,"cronicas is profoundly moving intense and real

it is a very hard movie to just walk away from

the actor damian alcazar who played the monster was beyond great

if charlize can get an academy award for monster he deserves one just as much for this

what  a role ... how hard must it be to play a role like that

all star latin cast in an excellent package by palm

we were fortunate to view it at sundance

im astonished it didn't win any awards

i guess for most americans its too real to fathom

poverty, people taking the law into their own hands

we like our news in a nice package, just the right sprinkling of human interest

a brutal depiction of horror and corruption by the american media

the money and fame driven chance of stardom

the ugliness that causes bad men to kill and good men to cover the truths

it is so socially relevant in these crazy times we live in now 911, katrina

and now the political system caused france riots not unlike america in the 60s

wow this is a good movie

just saw it for the 2nd time and noticed so much foreshadowing

again, great acting by latin americas top actors and our own john leguizamo

2397148,5,B000AYELPG,"I happen to be a huge fan of John Leguizamo and was absoultely excited when I found out he was starring in this film. I wasn't surprised to find that it was definitely one of his most shining moments. All the actors invovled in this film did a wonderful story, and they had a great plot to work off it. For those who don't know, the movie is about a report who is trying to track down a serial killer that's going after children. At first he's doing it to further his career, but he gets sucked in to it and of course there are a ton of surprises and lost trusts. It's one of the best movies I've seen all year, everything from the plot to the cenimatography is stunning and gritty. I would suggest this film to anyone that asked me about it, and I'm suggesting it to you. Take a chance and rent it at your local blockbuster, or buy it, it's worth whatever money you plan to spend.",1131321600,2,881,4.127906976744186

It was one of the best films I've seen all year. Not only is the film beautiful, but the acting is fantastic. It's about time that John Leguizamo gets a role worthy of the actor that he is! The movie was incredibly suspensful and touching, and I recommend it to anyone who likes psychological thrillers, it's really one of the best ones to come along in a while.",1131321600,4,527,4.076923076923077

It was shown as part of the Milwaukee International Film Festival and this was my chance to see a movie about which I had heard so much.  There was a lot of suspense and the storyline was great but it just ""ended"".  I felt a bit robbed; there should have been more loose ends tied up.  Still, it was a real thriller and forces the viewer to connect the dots.  It also showed the chilling effects of a pop culture generation thinking that everything said on television (and the internet) is true.",1130198400,2,539,4.35
2397151,5,B000AYELPG,"I saw this great movie Cronicas (Chronicles in English) at a film festival and was very satisfied with the acting done. This movie has a lot of crime, drama and suspense in and it is hard to believe that this is based on a true story. John Leguizamo takes the starring role of a news reporter, Manolo Bonilla from Miami. Leguizamo works for the Miami-based tabloid television show ""UNA HORA CON LA VERDAD"" (""One Hour With The Truth"")and travels from his home in Miami to Ecuador to find the serial killer that murdered 150 children. The nice little village of Babahoyo has not been the same since the serial killer, ""Monster of Babahoyo"" has been suspected for raping, killing and burying several children in gravesites.

2397181,4,B000AYELPG,"I was expected to be blown away by this film...had read so many positive opinions about it...but once I finished watching this film I had mixed feelings about how good it really is...?  Not to be disappointed, for this is a really interesting film, but I guess the ending could have been a bit modified/more horrific.  Come to think of it, I might have watched the censored version of this film.  I also did not understand why did Leguizamo's character speak Spanish/English (switching from one language to another/on and off) to his co-workers who only spoke Spanish to him and when addressed in English they still replied in Spanish as if they understood what was said to them in English. That did not make any sense.

The film tells a story of a reporter from Miami who works for a private news station known for its program called ""An Hour with the Truth"" which is broadcasted in Spanish speaking countries.  The main hero Manolo (John Leguizamo) is an aspiring news reporter seeking sensational stories together with his production crew composed of: a female producer who he has an affair with and a constantly pot-smoking camera-man.  The trio travels to Ecuador, where a notorious child serial killer only known as ""The Monster of Babahoyo"" is terrorizing the country side.  What they don't realize is that the news-story they are investigating and its conclusion will leave them questioning their work and life ethics.",1422835200,,1426,4.8921161825726145
2397182,4,B000AYELPG,"This movie is from the serial killer genre however focuses more on the tabloid media and how the journalists deal with information they receive about a serial killer.  Do they keep the information to themselves for an eventual sensational story or do they provide the information the police?  High profile journalist Manolo Bonilla (played by John Leguizamo) and suspected serial killer Vinicio Cepeda (played by Damian Alcazar) are the main characters of the film and are pretty riveting in their roles.  The supporting actors are also well cast.

I initially was debating on whether to give the movie 3 or 4 stars because the film itself was a little disjointed and didn't have a lot of action as a lot of the film involved Bonilla questioning/interviewing Cepeda for a potential news story.  In fact the main scene of action and violence was not of a serial killing but involved a car accident and a lynch mob.  However after watching the film it continued to stick in my head as it did have an underlying sense of dread and posed some interesting questions about consequences and responsibilities of peoples (in this case the journalists) choices and actions.  Therefore I went with a 4 star rating.

The film is in Spanish with English subtitles.  John Leguizamo does speak some lines in English but the majority of his dialogue is in Spanish.  Also the DVD has an alternate ending which is worth viewing as it provides a completely different perspective to the film.",1422835200,2,1472,4.852

2397188,5,B000AYELPG,"This movie is superb - tightly written, directed, and acted.  And very, very disturbing because of its subject matter.  Contrary to what some reviewers have suggested, the story is more complicated than just a group of journalists exploiting a series of killings. They actually ARE trying to do the right thing and identify the killer, they just want to profit from doing it by getting a huge TV exclusive.  And when they unintentionally muck things up, the film ending makes very clear the price that is paid (and by whom) after the journalists decide whether to save their own reputations and careers or expose just exactly how they botched things up.  I think the most disturbing question the film leaves us with is:  would we have done differently?",1244851200,,752,4.84375
2397189,4,B000AYELPG,"***1/2 2004. Written and directed by the Ecuadorian director Sebastin Cordero. Damin Alczar earned numerous awards for his performance as the serial killer Vinicio Cepeda. A reporter is sent to a small Ecuadorian town where a serial killer has already murdered several children. If you're a curious movie lover, CRONICAS is a film for you. To choose to handle the serial killer genre in a setting as original as an impoverished part of Ecuador allows the director to say two or three important things about journalism, ethics and the crowd's psychology. Recommended.",1212796800,,566,5.163043478260869
2397190,4,B000AYELPG,"This movie has the feel of a truth meets documentary film. John Leguizamo is really good as a Miami-based reporter, who is a star and sometimes acts like he's bigger than the story he's covering. Sound like anyone familiar? Can you say Geraldo Rivera? There are some similarities, but anyway, he's chasing a serial murder story down in Ecuador. The footage of the countryside in Ecuador is magnificent and adds to the realism of the movie. The scene where we meet the bad guy,a travelling bible salesman,(oh, the irony),has the misfortune of accidently running over a child and the ensuing mob scene is horrific. It is a vivid reminder of how justice is carried out in the backwoods of some countries, in this case, Ecuador. The hero reporter just happens to be on location to witness the gasoline being poured on the man, captures the images , sends them back home and an International story is born. The twist is predictable but the ride is gut wenching. The serial killer is revealed and the situation resolved, well, sort of. It takes the entirety of the movie to really put all the pieces together for a final end to Leguziamo's
 quest. This is a movie that captures you, transports you to Ecuador and makes you a little sick. That said, I enjoyed it! It is afterall a movie but maybe a little too close to reality for some people. it comes with extras that are cool. The alternate ending is wild. Check it out. Leguziamo is terrific. Recommended for those that like foreign movies that have that American flair too.",1201392000,,1521,4.654275092936803
2397204,4,B000AYELPG,"My wife is originally from Ecuador and I have gone there with her several times to visit friends and family members. So I am always interested to see how the nation is portrayed in movies and other forms of media. Cordero, who was born there but went to film school in the United States, does an excellent job of capturing the atmosphere and personality of this fascinating but troubled country.

Manolo Bonilla (John Leguizamo) is a Miami based reporter who travels to Ecuador along with his collegues Marisa and Ivan. They are filing reports for a Spanish language tabloid news show about the search for a child killer and rapist known as the ""Monster Of Babahoyo"". Bonilla ends up conducting a series of interviews with Vinicio Cepeda (Damian Alcanzar), an imprisoned Bible salesman who claims to know secret details about the ""Monster of Babahoyo"". But Bonilla's actions are geared more towards furthering his own career than helping the police find the killer and he eventually ends up creating a tragic outcome.

Leguizamo and Alcanzar do sensational acting jobs. Manolo is an arrogant, self-centered jerk that I came to truly despise, while Vinicio is a complex and confusing character that I, at first, was quite sympathetic towards. I also found the movie to be suspenseful because I kept expecting a ""whodunit twist"" to occur involving the true identity of the ""Monster"". But instead the film continues along the more obvious plot line and ends up being less of a murder mystery than an indictment of Bonilla's selfish careerism and the profit driven tabloid media industry. By the way, my wife says that vigilante attacks like the one in this movie are a common occurrence in Ecuador because the people, especially among the poor, have so little faith in the country's corrupt and incompetent system of justice.

Definitely check out this well made and entertaining movie. I also recommend Cordero's earlier film - ""Ratas, Ratones and Rateros"".",1184889600,,1955,5.009230769230769
2397205,3,B000AYELPG,"Manolo (Leguizamo) is a top-rated reporter for a tabloid TV show, based in Miami.  He has been reporting on the crimes of the ""Monster of Babahoya"".  This ""monster"" has been abducting, raping and killing over 100 boys and girls.  He has yet to be caught.

Manolo is in Ecuador, filming a funeral of one boy who was murdered by the ""monster"".  Not far away from the funeral, a driver accidently hits the twin brother of the boy that's being buried.  The town goes into a frenzy and nearly lynch the driver.

When rescued and arrested by the police, the driver, Vinicio, tells Manolo that he has detailed information on the ""monster"".  Manolo is intrigued and decided to interview Vinicio.

The thing is that Vinicio knows so much about the ""monster"" and where undiscovered bodies are located.  So, it becomes a question of whether the ""monster"" indeed revealed everything or if Vinicio is the ""monster"".

For me, it was predictable, slow and abrupt.  The movie ended with more questions than answers.  Ugh!",1169856000,,1005,4.807017543859649
2397206,4,B000AYELPG,"The cover of this DVD says the movie is in ""Spanish and English."" However, at least on the DVD version I got, the ""English"" consists of just a couple of sentences John Leguizamo inexplicably throws into his conversation, and then a few of the bonus interviews. Other than that, you will have to rely on the English subtitles, unless you are fluent in Spanish. And since some of the characters play reporters who speak rapidly, with a Ben Hecht ""Front Page"" urgency - that means you will have to quickly read a fair amount of material. But believe me, this movie is worth the effort.

Like me, you might find yourself watching the movie twice - once to get the gist by reading the subtitles - then again to concentrate more on the actors and to fill in some details.

John Leguizamo does a good job playing the cocky, ambitious reporter intent on developing and breaking the story of the child killer himself, without tipping off the police. But the really memorable performance is turned in by Damian Alcazar. He plays his part with a brilliant mix of meek supplication and soft, compelling manipulative guile. Whatever equivalent of the Academy Award the South American movie industry may present - should go to him.

This movie also gives us a look into settings most of us will (thankfully) never experience in person. We are taken into the center of mob violence. We see what the interior of a South American jail is like, with its peeling paint and exposed, dripping water pipes and its encouragement of inmate violence. We see the resourceful, stilted shantytowns people in those small towns build with whatever materials they find at hand.

This movie may also provoke deep debate among you and your friends about who the real villain of the story is. Of course there is the child killer himself. But many have found the reporters equally culpable in their eagerness to take credit for unmasking the killer. I have an additional candidate to nominate for villain. It's not so much Damian's wife, who urged her husband to keep silent about his presumed knowledge of the killer's identity. But it is her desperate spirit of ""let's not get involved"" that I blame. Even for someone who is poor and struggling, that attitude should not be given a pass. It is the root of so much evil.

Whichever characters you end up convicting of the horror though, you will probably be haunted by the dark places this movie takes you to - long after you finish watching it.",1161216000,5,2461,4.6875
2397207,4,B000AYELPG,"I really enjoyed Crnicas. It is a great psychological thriller that relies on storyline and the performances of the actors.  If you liked Silence of the Lambs and Mindhunter, you will like this film as well.  It delivers a chilling suspenseful and haunting film without any gore.

The whole cast gave a superb performance, led by John Leguizamo and Damin Alczar.  Leonor Watling (as Marisa) and Jos Mara Yazpik (as Ivan), also gave incredible supportive performances.

I am grateful that other reviewers have already given the synopsis of the film so I won't reiterate.  The film unravels the characters of Bonilla and Cepeda at the same time, showing curious similarities.  This is one of the keys to the film I think, introducing evil in its many shapes and shades.  Through the whole film I kept waiting and expecting for Bonilla to do the ""right thing"" because he is constantly referred to as the ""hero"".  Every where he goes, he signs autographs and smiles back at adoring fans. Cepeda is described as a hero also, by his family, friends and neighbors - God fearing bible salesman that everyone knows and adores, prior to accidentally running a child over (accidents happen, could happen to anyone, right?), thus becoming the tragic hero and victim of circumstance.

Even though I started figuring out the question of who the killer was, I never expected the ending; I sat up and gasped ""What???"" I was stunned! I kept waiting for someone to do the right thing because of the hero references and asking myself ""well, what would you do?"" to me it is a no brainer, but the director gives hints that Bonillo is as much as a sociopath as the killer.  I gaged my frustration with the outcome to the well done set up by the director and the stellar performance of the actors. I don't want to compromise my ethics here by saying that I liked the ending (given the gruesome crimes) -but I did and I thought that it was realistic given the set up and the movement to the film.  Long after the movie ends, questions will still gnaw in the back of your mind; one of them being if Bonillo was just as evil as the serial killer? Is knowledge and in-action just as evil as having committed the crime?

I am not to familiar with Sebastin Cordero work but I plan to get acquainted with it in the near future. Cordero wrote and directed this film and I think that there is a good partnership between him and Guillermo del Toro.  I have not been let down with del Toro's work, especially his work as a director.  Final thought it is great to see the range of John Leguizamo' work.  He is an exceptional actor who has been under rated, I hope he gets more work of this caliber.",1159920000,3,2663,4.528183716075157
2397208,5,B000AYELPG,"First of all, watching this movie, you have to remember that it's based on true events.

Alright.  Now, this movie was great.  John Leguizamo, as always, played his character flawlessly.

This moview was about a serial killer in Latin America that killed more than 150 children - boys and girls - and the reporters that follow this story.  I don't know if I can review this without spoiling the movie.

Alright, here goes.  The movie was great.  The beginning shows a little boy whose twin brother was killed by the ""Monster"" - the name that was given to the serial killer / rapist who has been taking young children and doing horrible - HORRIBLE - things to them.  The little boy gets run over by a man who was picking up his son from school after taking a bath in a river (???).  Then it cuts to a reporter who is quite famous in that country, who is covering the story of the ""Monster.""

He does interviews with the man who accidentally runs over the little boy.  Turns out that the man who ran over the little boy has information about the Monster that no one but the Monster would have.  As it turns out, the information is completely true, and this movie chronicles what the reporter chooses to do with the information given.

It is about what's important and what you are willing to sacrifice for fame.

I loved it, it pissed my friend off with the ending, but I would recommend watching it.  It will give you something to think about and talk about, and debate about because this movie will have you walking away with conflicting feelings.  On one hand, you know what's right, but what's more important, you or other people?

A big city TV reporter covering the story succumbs to a horrible dilemma. The actors carry off their roles well and the feel of the film is very realistic.,1139961600,,331,4.354838709677419
2397212,4,B000AYELPG,"`Crnicas' (2004) written and directed by Sebastin Cordero has authentic look of the countryside of Ecuador, and very strong performances from the three leading actors. The content of the film itself, part thriller about a serial killer, and part social satire about the media, looks more American than you might expect from the Ecuadorian-born director, who went to France at the age of 9, and studied filmmaking at university in California. But his semi-documentary touch proves he has originality, with realistic atmosphere that sometimes bring to us the smell of the places like seedy prison or humid swamps.

John Leguizamo plays a Miami-based TV-reporter who stumbles upon a big story about the heinous serial killer ""the Monster of Babahoyo."" Manolo, star reporter of Tabloid TV show (host played cameo Alfred Molina), believes that this timid middle-aged man Vinicio, who is now in prison because of one fatal hit-and-run accident, knows something about the killer that scares the local people.

While Vinicio offers a deal, there is another question - is he telling Manolo the truth? Or is he himself the Monster?

`Crnicas' has suspenseful moments, but it is not a murder mystery. If you're an avid reader of crime novels, you can predict the story fairly well, and the main characters - fame-hungry TV reporter, his female assistant (Leonor Watling, `Talk to Her'), and the portrait of the killer itself - are pretty stereotyped ones. Its oversimplified statement about the media, as is shown in its tagline (`If it's on TV, it must be the truth') looks old to me, having been repeated again and again in the films like `Mad City.' Today people don't believe the `story' so easily as the film thinks.

But the sinister, brooding mood of the places director Sebastin Cordero shoots with keen eyes, and the riveting acting from underrated Leguizamo, and creepy but convincing acting from Damin Alczar is another thing. The director did a fantastic job of capturing the air of the small community.

Perhaps the film gets most chilling when it shows the darker (or I should say complicated) side of the people in this small town. Actually, the most impressive moment does not involve the serial killer, nor the media circus. I am talking about one long sequence, in which one dies and another is nearly killed after being brutally treated. Here Cordero shows his undeniable talent as director. The film is well worth watching for these terrific moments, not for the simplified commentary on the media that you might have already heard before.",1139702400,6,2548,5.01418439716312
