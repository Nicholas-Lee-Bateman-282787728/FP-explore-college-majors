8605765,4,B00EIMS9JK,"This collection covers Funk's on again off again run in ECW from April 1993 to January 1999. All of his classic matches/promos/angles are here covering it all from his fued with Eddie Gilbert to his final ECW rivalry with Tommy Dreamer. This is an RF Video release, and the picture quality varies, as it is footage recorded from TV and not the master tapes, which WWE owns. But you can't go wrong with a whopping 8 discs of ""The Funker""! Check it out.",1430006400,,451,4.445783132530121
