7861077,3,6304079931,"The acting and plotting of this film is just plain boring and pretty terrible. If however, you like to see Pamela Anderson's fantastic body (I do, but it doesn't matke a film), then you'll get something out of this. The T&A is highly enjoyable, but untimently this film feels pointless.",1126310400,,286,4.74
