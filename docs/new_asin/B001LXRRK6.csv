8326566,5,B001LXRRK6,"As a heavy PC user, I wanted to try an Apple computer but I had no idea where to start. I searched on Amazon for something to help guide me on using an Apple computer and came across this DVD. Five weeks later I am the proud new owner of a 17in Macbook Pro. This DVD has helped me immensely in getting used to the operating system. I highly recommend this DVD if you are ever interested in using an Apple computer or just wanted to know more.",1241308800,,442,4.034090909090909
8326567,5,B001LXRRK6,"Lately with Confiker and other reasons I was thinking about switching to a Mac. My friend referred me to this DVD. Before this DVD I was like there is no way I could buy a Mac I don't know anything about it, it's like a foreign language. After watching the DVD I think I could buy a Mac and be able to use it without any problems. It not only explains the differences with PC's and Mac's, but it also shows the different types of Mac computers and would help me choose the correct Mac for me. I highly recommend this DVD to anybody even just thinking about switching to a Mac or to anyone who needs a refresher course on the small details of a Mac computer.",1238889600,,657,4.140625
8326568,5,B001LXRRK6,I'd been thinking about switching to a Mac when a friend mentioned this DVD. I was tired of fighting all the hassles that arose in trying to get the computer to do what I needed. Mr. Smith's fine presentation convinced me to take the leap. It was well worth it. Hearing and seeing his explanations were very helpful in getting up to speed. I look forward to Mr. Smith's additional DVDs for further assistance.,1238544000,,409,4.54054054054054
8326569,5,B001LXRRK6,"Great help for someone (like me) new to the Mac and overwhelmed by all the manual-speak that comes with it. Robin's presentation is informal and friendly, yet concise and informative. Very easy for anyone to follow and put the information provided to work immediately. This guy definitely knows what he's doing and guides you along step by step on everything you need to know about getting started (and progressing) with your new Mac. The DVD states that future volumes will show how to transfer email and how to add more memory, both of which will come in handy. I look forward to seeing what the next volumes will offer.",1232236800,2,622,4.715596330275229
8326570,5,B001LXRRK6,"I highly recommend this DVD.  I got the DVD to help my kids learn computer skills. I wound up learning so much! I have been using a Mac for several years but have never bothered to read the entire manual, choosing to learn as I go and ask someone for help when I get stuck. Well, I'm going to be stuck a lot less often after watching this.  The instructor is great, clear and friendly.  It's SO helpful to be able to see everything he is explaining rather than looking in a book.  I would recommend this DVD for someone considering buying a Mac ( he explains how to decide what is the best computer for you)  and I think it is a must have for anyone who has already chosen to make the switch. And if you're like me, a Mac user but not someone who enjoys going through manuals, you can use this as a refresher (or intro) class on how to get the most out of your computer.",1231804800,,870,4.064327485380117
8326571,5,B001LXRRK6,"Contained in this disc is an introductory step-by-step program of how to familiarize oneself with the Macintosh. I would highly recommend this DVD to all beginner Mac users for three reasons: 1) The instructor, Robin Smith, proves to be a good teacher in this DVD by explaining things in an intelligent manner, but not in a ""techie"" language that leaves you lost & confused after the first Chapter. 2) While explaining to the viewer the basic Mac functions, Smith demonstrates on his own Mac how to execute those functions, so that the new Mac user will know how to navigate and interact with their Mac. 3) Smith is not a ""Mac-evangelist"" who spends the entire video bashing the Windows PC and singing the praises of the Macintosh, but rather explains the reasons to choose a Mac over a PC.",1230249600,2,790,4.690647482014389
8326572,5,B001LXRRK6,"This DVD is well worth the price. It was so much better to be tutored by a person and not just a book. It felt like a friend was sitting with me, showing me the best ways to use my MAC. As Robin Smith talks, you can follow along, watching him use his MAC, while you can try on your own screen. It is a great way to learn all the things new to a former Windows user. It would take a year to learn all the little ins and outs, tricks and shortcuts that he shows you in just an hour. He is easy to listen to and follow and obviously loves what he does.
I can also highly recommend the DVD for those who have not yet purchased a MAC. He helps you identify what type of user you are, and then describes which of the MAC products might best fit your need. Again, it's like having a knowledgeable friend helping you. I am really looking forward to the next offerings in the series.",1229385600,,874,3.971590909090909
