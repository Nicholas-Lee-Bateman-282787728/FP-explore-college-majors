3907370,3,B002CWKTU0,The quality of the DVD's is suspect. I experienced a lot of skipping on some of the movies.,1265414400,8,91,4.111111111111111
3907371,5,B002CWKTU0,This is an outstanding compilation of many of the best movies made by an outstanding actor.  It is a joy to watch him work.  As a bonus Joanne Woodward is in some of the movies.  You won't be sorry if you add this to your collection.,1264377600,,233,4.021739130434782
3907372,4,B002CWKTU0,"It was such a great gift, it made my sister cry when she opened it.  We liked the selections of movies, although some of Paul's better films weren't included in this set.  The two movies we watched together Christmas evening both had places on CDs that stopped the film.  We cleaned the disks and it was better, but a new set shouldn't do this.  I hope her other films are better.",1262995200,5,380,4.309859154929577
3907373,2,B002CWKTU0,"This is in no way a review of the movies included in the collection, but entirely based on the packaging faults.

When I received this, six of the DVDs had come loose from their pockets and had been terribly scratched. The DVDs are not kept in cases, and are not in any way locked in. They are instead slid into pockets on a fold-out DVD case. There is nothing to prevent the DVDs from coming loose, and the pockets do not secure them tightly to start with. Needless to say, I had to return the product.

If you really want this, I suggest buying it somewhere you can be sure that the discs are not loose from travel.

I've never felt the need to write a review for anything I've purchased from Amazon before, but I had to in this case.",1262649600,64,736,4.205673758865248
3907374,5,B002CWKTU0,"I just received this yesterday as a Christmas gift and I have to say I think it is a wonderful tribute to my favorite actor of all time.  I've read a couple of negative reviews on here but I found this collection fantastic.  I like all the movies and I had seen them all except ""Rally Round The Flag Boys"" and although it is a little silly Paul and Joanne are so young and beautiful in the film~you still gotta love it.  ""Quintet,"" which I hadn't seen in many years, I found to be a somewhat fascinating puzzle of a film and ""Buffalo Bill and The Indians"", another oddity, I enjoyed more now than I remembered.  Of course the clasics here are ""The Verdict"", ""The Hustler"", and ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" all having 2 disc editions as does ""The Towering Inferno"" which is one of the first films I remember seeing as a kid. It is indeed a popcorn eating delight!  The book that comes with it is very pretty and has some wonderful photos and movie poster reproductions.  The only fault is that the discs are in like a photo album type thing so they are not in their own boxes.  But 40 dollars for 13 fantastic movies is, in my opinion, a great deal.  Thanks Mom for the wonderful gift!",1260489600,3,1192,4.290178571428571
3907375,2,B002CWKTU0,"Well, like most tributes and memorial services I've ever been to, they end up reflecting just a pale shadow of the loved one and inevitably leave you missing the real person all the more.  Many of this magnificent artist's by far not greatest films just sort of all thrown together (mostly just two or three stars at best) as well as a few of the truly great ones -- The Hustler and The Verdict.  Buy those two to watch over and over and rent the others to watch once, but sheesh. This collection sure is hardly definitive. Just some big quick bucks for some big corporation. Yawn.",1254960000,17,581,4.420560747663552
3907376,5,B002CWKTU0,"This 17 disc set will include:

1. The Long, Hot Summer (1958) - directed by Martin Ritt costarring Joanne Woodward
2. Rally 'round the Flag, Boys! (1958) - comedy directed by Leo McCarey costarring Joanne Woodward
3. From the Terrace (1960) - directed by Mark Robson and costarring Joanne Woodward. Rather complex story of the disintegration of a marriage.
4. Exodus (1960) - directed by Otto Preminger costarring Eva Marie Saint. Story of the birth of the modern nation of Israel.
5. The Hustler (1961) - directed by Robert Rossen costarring Piper Laurie. One of Newman's most famous roles as a pool hustler who wants to beat Minnesota Fats. The current two disc edition of this film is quite good, it will be interesting to see if it is improved upon.
6. Adventures of a Young Man (1962) - directed by Martin Ritt costarring Diane Baker. Paul Newman is tenth billed and thus plays a very small part.
7. What a Way to Go! (1964) - directed by J. Lee Thompson. Stars Shirley MacLaine as a woman who brings fortune, fame, and death to all of her husbands. Paul Newman plays one of them, so this really is not his film.
8. Hombre (1967) - directed by Martin Ritt and costarring Frederic March. This is a very good western with the focus back on Newman in the lead.
9. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) - directed by George Roy Hill and costarring Robert Redford. A delightful western with comic and tragic touches.
10. Towering Inferno (1974) - costarring Steve McQueen. Newman plays an architect who returns from a long vacation to find that the skyscraper he designed has been constructed in a substandard fashion. A fire breaks out the night that the building owner is hosting a party on the roof celebrating the building's opening.
11. Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson (1976) - directed by Robert Altman and costarring Joel Grey. A bit too long, and somewhat controversial tale with Newman as Buffalo Bill.
12. Quintet (1979) - directed by Robert Altman and costarring Vittorio Gassman. Futuristic film in which bored humanity has invented a game - ""Quintet"" - to pass the time. However, dying is the penalty for the human game pieces.
13. The Verdict (1982) - Sidney Lumet directs and James Mason costars in a courtroom drama involving medical malpractice in which Newman's character lands a case where all parties wish to settle out of court. However, Newman's character wants to pursue the case to trial.

Thirteen films in all, although I'm not sure why ""Adventures of a Young Man"" is included since Newman's role here is very small, and this is not even a major film. A booklet is also supposed to be included with this set.",1245456000,77,2670,4.715203426124197
3907377,3,B002CWKTU0,Movies are on DVD as advertised and book is fine.  Packaging of DVD's leaves something to be desired as they easily fall out of package.  A tribute package should at least have plastic sleeves to protect the movies.,1358467200,,215,4.631578947368421
3907378,1,B002CWKTU0,all the disc watched so far are bad.. stop 1/2 and freeze no matter what I do.  The discs are bad,1357516800,3,97,3.619047619047619
3907379,1,B002CWKTU0,"First of all, obviously Paul Newman is awesome. This review is about the packaging. Most of the discs had come out of their sleeves, they were COMPLETELY and TOTALLY scratched. I mean, BAD. Plus the box itself was kind of smashed on the corners. I read other reviews stating these same complaints - so this is not isolated at all. I just wish I read those review BEFORE I bought it. Thank goodness for the easy return policy.",1354665600,9,425,4.461538461538462
3907380,5,B002CWKTU0,"As the title suggests, I gave The Tribute Collection to my nephew as a gift for Father's Day. My nephew is a big fan of the movies; he is one of those people who knows who directed any given movie, who starred in it and in which other movies the actors had roles and the director directed.  He is particularly a fan of old movies.  I was a little hesitant to give The Tribute Collection to him because 1) he might have had all the movies on other DVD's and 2) some of the movies included in the Collection were not well known and might therefore not be particularly worth seeing.  However, my nephew was very happy upon receiving the gift and although he did have at least one of the movies in his collection and had seen others, he still found the collection worth viewing.  For my part, I have not yet watched Paul Newman with my nephew, but I have to admit that, being a woman of a certain age, I rarely missed plunking down a few dollars to see Paul Newman at a local cinema -- his good looks alone made it worth the price!",1343692800,,1027,4.171717171717172
3907381,5,B002CWKTU0,This is an excellent collection and an excellent price. I paid $62.99 two years ago for this set. Scoop it up now.,1339459200,,114,4.2272727272727275
3907382,2,B002CWKTU0,"The movie selection is very good and show a range of Newman's acting abilities from comedy to drama; the packaging however is so bad the product overall only rates a two star review.

Several of the DVD's were loose on arrival and two so badly scratched they didn't play properly; one can be watched but one is trash.  The sleeves the DVD's are in are nothing more than slits in cardboard; not only do the slits not hold the DVD's securly but the cardboard is abrasive and scratches the DVD's when they work loose.

Even if the packagaing/storage box didn't damage the DVD's it would have lost a star for its shape and size.  It is oblong and doesn't fit on a standard book shelf or DVD rack.  Just where does the designer think a person would store this box.

I will not return the set but replace the damaged DVDs with individual purchases; they are both reasons for this purchase.  Exodus and The Towering Inferno were the most damaged though all DVD's do have some scratches even the ones that didn't come loose have scuffs.  The cardboard is abrasive and just the vibrations of moving it put scuffs on the DVD's where they made contact with the sleeves.  The DVD's will be put in a DVD wallet.",1299715200,16,1198,4.458715596330276
3907383,4,B002CWKTU0,"I'm personally not a big fan of Paul Newman, but my mother-in-law is. I bought this for her for her birthday, and she LOVED it! Scored me big points with her. This is recommended for all mother-in-laws!",1290124800,,202,4.486486486486487
3907384,1,B002CWKTU0,"This is a review of the packaging, not the movies. This set was a great idea, but those responsible for the packaging need to know that they did a very poor job and obviously are not consumers of DVDs. Every single DVD in my set is scuffed and some of the DVDs are unplayable. Here's a word of advise to the marketing people who approved the design for this set: Common sense should have told you not put DVD discs in open cardboard slots because they will come loose. DVD discs have a very useful center hole which when used is helpful in securing the DVD. The only other alternative is to package each individule DVD in it's own cardboard envelope.",1279152000,34,650,4.380165289256198
3907385,1,B002CWKTU0,"I'm getting kind of tired of marketing creative ""geniuses"" who sacrifice function for ""design"" when they create DVD packaging.  You wouldn't throw a Waterford crystal vase into a shoebox -- with no protection -- and then mail it off to a distant relative, would you?  I ordered this Paul Newman set and when unpacked from its outer shipping box, there was an ominous rattling -- I should say MULTIPLE rattlings -- coming from within the actual boxed set.  When I opened the case, half of the discs had come out of their holders, which are simply ""slits"" diecut into two cardboard slipcases that the discs slide into -- slits that do NOT hold the discs securely in place.  So I had a handful of DVDs that had bounced around loose inside of the box all during its shipping journey.  Some of the other DVDs that managed to stay in their slots were scratched as well, since you have a delicate, recordable surface of the DVD rubbing against a hard cardboard ""holder"" as you slide it in and out of its slot.  Can't rate the quality of the actual movies because I sent the set back as damaged goods.  The packaging, however, gets an F-.  The set was designed by someone who obviously lacks any comprehension whatsoever of what function packaging is supposed to provide -- the protection of the contents it holds or contains.  I'm only hoping Fox Home Entertainment docks the designer's paycheck for each and every set that's returned as damaged.  Poetic justice -- because there will be a lot of them coming back.  AVOID.",1277424000,64,1515,4.6367041198501875
3907386,5,B002CWKTU0,"This is a handsomely packaged, extremely informative collection of several of Paul Newman's best movies giving a broad overview of the range of his work. The book included is a great supplement to the movies.",1267660800,,208,4.9714285714285715
8364584,1,B002CWKTU0,Packaging is bad to terrible. This would be the greatest collection ever if the DVD's played. Hombre played and the quality of the disc was outstanding. Towering Inferno locked up the DVD player and would not start. Tried second DVD just in case and no go. The other towering inferno locked up half way through. What a disappointment.,1493596800,,334,4.775862068965517
8364585,1,B002CWKTU0,Once we opened the box all of the DVD's were all over the place. They all got scratched and now cannot watch any of them. Do not recommend.,1489363200,3,139,4.0
8364586,1,B002CWKTU0,"4 stars for the films...0 for the packaging...

Fox should be ashamed of selling this item, but they won't be. The idiot savants who designed this package should be sent to the eastern part of the Ukraine, they are likely, however, to receive promotions and bonuses. I sent this DVD set, the worst I have ever seen, back to Amazon because when I opened it, discs had fallen out of their dreadful cardboard seats that were supposed to hold them and all of them, all of them, were scratched, scuffed, and looked like they had all been used as skates on the cold asphalt in streets of Albany, New York. I am at a loss for words to express how bad this DVD package is. I am also at a loss for words as to why Amazon would sell such total crap. No I am not. For though Amazon has the ability to force corporations to issue only quality products, Amazon cares more about Mammon and world conquest than it does about its customers.",1420502400,4,924,4.310344827586207
8364587,3,B002CWKTU0,"I liked it, but my favorite movie in the set was damaged (not scratched, I just think it did burn well to the disk initially.  I contacted the seller and they said they would send me a new copy of that specific movie, but never did.  Not not a bad review so much on the box set, jut on the seller.",1405814400,3,297,3.8524590163934427
8364588,1,B002CWKTU0,"Same thing all the other negative reviews said.....the films themselves are great! Paul Newman was an amazing talent! However, I was given two discs of ""The Long, Hot Summer"" and ""Rally Round the Flag, Boys"" is missing from my collection. And I really hope that whoever designed the packaging of this set got fired! I didn't buy it from Amazon, I bought it from the FoxConnect site during their 50% off sale and I'm so glad I didn't pay full price for this! When it arrived, most of the discs had fallen out of the cardboard and were VERY VERY badly scratched! I haven't tried playing any of them yet, but from the look of the discs, I'm sure some will skip and some may not play at all they're so badly damaged. You might be better off spending more and buying the individual films packaged in regular DVD cases.",1395705600,,813,4.426666666666667

8364590,5,B002CWKTU0,This item is great for any Paul Newman lover. There is a great variety of Newman movies in the box including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid.  My inlaws had a great Christmas viewing several of their new movies.,1388620800,,214,4.487179487179487
8364591,2,B002CWKTU0,"We bought the DVD set at Costco in Ontario and the whole set is scratched. This is obviously a manufacturer's defect because the scratches were very consistent - the top row of discs was one type and the bottom row had a different shape of scratch. We bought one, returned it to the store, bought the second one and opened it right there in front of the cashier. Same thing - we returned it too and advised them to pull them from their shelves. It made us sad, but I figure the whole lot is marred. When they come out with a new set, I would love to have them!",1386115200,,560,4.1
