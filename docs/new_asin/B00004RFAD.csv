7920952,5,B00004RFAD,My nine year old loves power rangers and he especially likes the different versions.  It is kind of funny that he likes VHS tapes better than DVDs.  Great show for my little one.,1389052800,,178,4.363636363636363
7920953,4,B00004RFAD,I truthfully thought that this was a pretty good season of Power Rangers. Although it was a bit different in some ways. Eg They're know in an underwater Aqua base and their costumes are a bit different aswell. But it was a really good video and I can't wait to see the next video of Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue. It was acceptionally good because of the villians. I liked the villians in Lightspeed Rescue. They are very creative. I loved the movie (probably because I am a big fan) and I strongly reccomend it to Power Ranger Fans who liked Power Rangers Lost Galaxy.,985219200,3,571,4.5
7920954,1,B00004RFAD,"I saw the first episode of this umpteenth spinoff of the power rangers, and was amazed (yeah, right): the lead players are ""grownups"" with occupations (one's a firefighter, the other's a cowboy), having to work in some Aqua-whatever the hell the name of the city is (remember, Angel Grove was brought to ruins?). Oh, yeah, I remember these clowns from many years ago, having to get changed again and again. The special effects weren't even up to Lost Galaxy standards. Let's have Andrea Bocelli don a Power Ranger suit. Better yet, let's see the Mystic Knights of Tir na Nog join forces with them. Where ARE they, anyway, when we need them?",977961600,,640,4.723214285714286
7920955,5,B00004RFAD,"Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue is totally awsome. I watched the very first episode a couple weeks ago, and it was so exciting. This new series is unlike the others. This time the're joined up with a government to help  stop the evil Diabolico. really cool! Watch Power Rangers Lightspeed  Rescue, it's really awsome! LIGHTSPEED GO!",950659200,7,332,5.0181818181818185
