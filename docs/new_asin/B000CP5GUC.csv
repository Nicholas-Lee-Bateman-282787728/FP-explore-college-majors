2467800,1,B000CP5GUC,"This DVD is very basic; it is a series of stretches and NOT a workout. I will not make this part of my regular routine. There are no challenging poses in this workout; my experience with platies (5 years) made this DVD a letdown as there are many exercises in this discipline to strengthen the back that could have been used in this video.
I broke my back several years ago and this DVD is too easy for me. I feel like it belongs in a retirement facility or it should be done before bed. If you are looking for a workout that will strengthen your back this is NOT it. I do not recommend this product.",1321747200,8,600,4.136752136752137
2467801,5,B000CP5GUC,I bought this to help strengthen my back and it's done a great job in helping loosen my back muscles and stretch my hamstrings as well as I can feel it working the muscles in my lower back where I've always had problems. As with all the Windsor series I feel that the video does a good job of walking you through how the exercise needs to be done properly so you get the max result.,1266796800,14,382,4.0394736842105265
2467802,5,B000CP5GUC,"This is a good DVD though it wasn't what I thought it would be.  I thought it was a workout, but it is more about caring for the back, keeping it strong and healthy.  I have no trouble with my back, but plan to use this DVD every few weeks to keep it that way.  I am going to loan it to a friend who has some back issues.  I am anxious to see how it helps her.",1245024000,8,360,3.576923076923077
2467803,4,B000CP5GUC,I sprained my backed last year and after weeks of physical therapy I found very little relief.  After one session of doing this workout I felt a difference that kept getting better. My posture after day one was remarkable. I'm having less and less pain in my lower back. I'm moving a bit more freely and not so stiff and I could not be happier. I think it is worth buying if you have back issues and your back is really bad some of these moves might not be what you need. So please check with the doctor first. I think I'm ready for regular Pilates now. I'll give the original 20 minute workout a try.,1209081600,11,601,4.181034482758621
2467804,3,B000CP5GUC,"I'm a huge fan of Pilates, and love Mari Winsor, but was incredibly disappointed in this particular DVD.  Since I have tightness in my neck and shoulders, and ocassionally my lower back, I thought I'd give it a try.  The routines are designed for those who are unable to do normal pilates exercises, and since that is not me, I found the work-out to be too simple for me and therefore unhelpful.  Although I do feel more relaxed after using this video, I do not feel my back is getting any stronger, and that is what I'm aiming for.

If you want a simple, relaxing, back and leg stretching DVD, this is it.  If you want back strengthening and stretching, I've found Yoga DVDs that focus on the back to be a lot more helpful.  If you like pilates, stick with Mari's other DVDs.",1186876800,33,776,4.354166666666667
2467805,5,B000CP5GUC,"I am a seamstress and I hate to exercise.  I have had fairly chronic headaches,back and neck pain and stiffness for years.  This back workout takes only 20 minutes to do and is not difficult at all.  In fact, it is quite relaxing at the end of the day.  It has helped strengthen and loosen up my back and neck better than anything I have ever tried. It has reduced the frequency of headaches by 75%.  My chiropractor is thrilled at the results, too.  I have a hard time doing regular pilates because I am so out of shape, but I have no trouble doing these and have stuck with them for over a year.  I recommend them without reservation to anyone who needs to improve their back health.",1143763200,11,685,4.263565891472868
2467806,5,B000CP5GUC,Excellent for anyone with back problems. Mari Winsor is the best. Take on vacation or if you travel for work.,1414281600,2,109,4.5
2467807,5,B000CP5GUC,"excellent, professional and to the point instruction.  Great excercises for the back.  I have two herneated discs and can do most of the excercises.",1412985600,,148,5.125
2467808,5,B000CP5GUC,YOU REALLY have to stay committed to this 25 minute low impact stretching video until you can fully appreciate its amazing results...this was recommended by my chiropractor and i thank him every day for it!,1406592000,3,206,4.914285714285715
2467809,5,B000CP5GUC,I love doing all of my Windsor pilates exercise DVD's even tough I am a beginner. I can tell a difference especially now that I am eating right and it is very easy to do.,1382918400,2,170,3.8857142857142857
2467810,5,B000CP5GUC,"In my opinion this Back Workout is not intended to be an extreme workout for the core and back, but is excellent for someone who might have a tight back or shoulders. I hurt my back last year and Winsor Pilates Back Workout was such a great find, it helped soothe the tightness and did help me relearn and strengthen my core muscles so that I could move up in intensity.

A year later, I'm still using it several mornings each week to help keep the back muscles loose and more resistant to another injury.",1381622400,6,505,4.315789473684211
2467811,5,B000CP5GUC,"I purchased this dvd and a few of her other floor pilates dvds some years back. To this day, THIS dvd is the BEST thing that I've ever come across to help with my spinal issues -- aside from my Teeter Hang Ups table which is THE THE THE best piece of rehab equipment everrrrrrr!

Mari's BACK workout has been amazing.
I have 2 cervical bulging discs and 2 lumbar bulging discs. This happened from YEARS of sitting at the computer for 8-12 hrs a day with NO breaks. DUMB! But I was growing a business, and YOUNG, and well, I didn't believe in the whole ""you need to sit in an ergonimic chair"" thing. Ahhhhh....""youth IS wasted on the young""!! So true! :/  I did crazy things such as lie on the bed, watching tv, playing with my puppy, as I was doing my web graphics design for hours and hours. Result? The bulging discs some 6 years later. I believe it would have happened sooner, but years of physical fitness training really protected me for quite a long time. Nevertheless, I succumbed to injury. The crunched in feeling, PINCHED burning and stinging nerve pain, and not to mention the pulled back and neck muscles were excruciating. I started off my rehab with the inversion table (a G*D-send!!), and then learned about this BACK dvd. AMAZING!

When my back feels ""tight"", or I start feeling that crunched in feeling, I will turn to this dvd. It NEVER fails me! In a word: ""Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh"". THAT's how you will feel after completing the exercises. It's like heaven.

In the years since, I've moved on to Mari's other pilates dvds, and now have an Aeropilates Reformer (just got it and LUVVVVVV it!!), BUT I always try to start my mornings with this BACK dvd. It's the perfect prep before getting onto my inversion table (Teeter Hang Ups).

I just cannot RAVE enough about Mari Winsor or her pilates series. They are ALL fabulous! She really is inspirational AND motivational, and most of all -- she knows her stuff. LOVE her!

If you have a bad back, whether it be weak back muscles and/or spinal disc bulges, TRY THIS DVD!

Remember:
If you have an acute injury to your back, do not do any exercise. Wait until your back muscles have healed before getting onto an inversion table. And always prep by stretching your back and hamstring muscles before getting on the table when you are ready. As for the BACK dvd, I have found great relief when my back is ""tight"", but would never do any form of exercise if my back muscle is ""pulled"". Luckily *knocking on wood*, I haven't had a pulled back muscle in YEARS. I believe I owe that to doing daily hamstring stretches (a MUST if you have a weak lower back!!), THIS Back dvd, and my inversion table. If you have any other spinal issues other than ""bulging discs"", make sure you check with your physician before beginning any exercise (ie, for those with a ruptured disc, previous back surgery, etc).

I hope this information helps anyone else looking for back ailment relief!",1376870400,8,2923,4.533206831119545
2467812,3,B000CP5GUC,"I love the Winsor Pilates DVDs, but was a little bummed that this was more of a stretching routine than a workout.  It's OK.",1373587200,,124,4.166666666666667
2467813,4,B000CP5GUC,"I have very bad lower back pain that I live with constantly.  This video is exactly what I needed to help me stretch and strengthen every morning.  There are still moves that I cannot do, but I am working up to it.",1369785600,,214,4.071428571428571
2467814,5,B000CP5GUC,Anytime I get a twinge in my back I do this dvd. If you have back problems please try it. It's not extremely physical but I think it's the sequence of exercise that just frees up your back. Anytime I have back pain I sit down with this dvd and the most it take is two times and my pain is gone. I originally got this dvd with the Mari Winsor pilates series. I was so afraid that my dvd would expire or have problems that I ordered another one and I give them as gifts.,1359504000,2,468,3.8854166666666665
2467815,4,B000CP5GUC,"This Pilates DVD has helped me strengthen my back and core, which has helped me to control my back pain. The workout is low impact and short, fitting easily into any half-hour segment of my day - no breaking a sweat, so you could even do this on a 1-hour lunch break and have time to spare.

The one problem I found is that Winsor goes through the routine in a careful manner, and after almost memorizing the routine - but not being able to do it w/o the DVD - I get tired of waiting in between exercises while she explains about the next. It's not really her problem, in the end it's mine...",1334620800,10,592,4.147826086956521
8099918,5,B000CP5GUC,"This is really relaxing, it almost feels yoga like. I haven't used it enough to say it has helped my back. But I do feel like it is a safe video for my back condition. Low impact.",1522972800,,179,3.864864864864865
8099919,5,B000CP5GUC,This is an awesome stretch!,1475280000,2,27,4.6
8099920,5,B000CP5GUC,My acupuncturist recommended that I find a pilates instructor for dealing with an SI joint problem.  I found one that will come into my home whenever I want her to.  Mari Winsor pilates is better than having to pay $70.00 per hour for personal training and you can do it in the privacy of your own home.  I am faithful about doing the stretches at least three times per week and I have seen a vast improvement in my flexibility and relief from pain.,1448236800,4,449,4.321428571428571

8099922,5,B000CP5GUC,"I noticed a difference right away. My back, shoulders, and neck feel less tight and more relaxed. I have better posture and more energy. The work out is 20 minutes long but it does not feel like it is. It is so relaxing that you won't want to stop.",1444608000,3,248,4.081632653061225
8099923,2,B000CP5GUC,"I was suffering from a L5 misalignment and was advised to do more pilates (vs. yoga).  I am fairly flexible... just naturally, but this video had no use for me - even with my back issue.  I am sure if I suffered sever back problems it would be beneficial... but even with that - I am sure someone with such severe back issues would be seeking alternative methods for strengthening their back.  Unfortunately, I didn't read the small print and was charged a restocking fee and only got a few bucks back...  better than nothing I guess.",1436140800,,534,4.474226804123711
