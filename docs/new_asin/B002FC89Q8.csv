8368949,4,B002FC89Q8,"A good film and worth watching, in French with English subtitles.  it appears like a thriller a la single white female or fatal attraction but with a twist.

It is supposed to be based on a true story and the only story i can find that fits the time was also made into a film called Little Girl Lost; the Delimar Vera story.  Both films appear to be made  around 2008, and the true story was in 2004 concerning the kidnap in a similar situation -",1416700800,,446,4.151162790697675
8368950,5,B002FC89Q8,"An excellent 'Is it, Isn't it?' thriller. Inspired by a true story, this film allows Catherine Frot an opportunity to give a performance that in every way contrasts with her character in the exquisite film 'The Page Turner' (La Tourneuse de Pages). She plays Elsa Valentin, the mother of only child Thomas, and appears to be much the same in confidence as any single mother of a nine or ten year old boy can be. Yes, she is suffering because her ex-husband wants custody (He's a nice guy, and a good Dad). But she holds it together as well as can be expected. But then she picks Thomas up from a birthday party, and a little girl there reminds her that Thomas had a little sister.",1360540800,,680,4.404761904761905
