You'll probably end up watching the movies once or twice, then leaving the case out for display as more of a collection piece than anything else.",1493683200,,254,4.795454545454546

I mean the  visual quality of the movies themselves are sub-par. I mean, I am a huge fan of crappy B movies from the 80's and I watched all of these movies and threw them away. Keep your money in your pocket on this one.",1243382400,4,463,6.467741935483871
8142765,5,B000I0QLT6,"I bought this set and let it sit for awhile. I enjoy Troma films but never really have the chance to view the films until recently. I will admit some are very good but a few are plain bad. Nightmare Weekend had some gore and nudity but it was a beyond bad movie. The best movies in this set are Mommy's Epitaph, Scream Baby Scream, and Chillers. Chillers is like a low budget version of Creepshow but is actully better then Creepshow. The ending to that movie was a pleaseant surprise. Very good set from Troma and highly recommended.",1198627200,18,534,4.404040404040404
