7994204,5,B00009XN53,"I just recently found out about THE HUNGER series, and now I'm drooling to own every single one. It's very difficult to combine sex and horror effectively, but this series has some classics by very good horror writers. Highlights in CREATURE COMFORTS are Kim Newman's ""Week Woman"" (Where a woman changes personalities every week, to the shock of her new husband) and Lisa Tuttle's ""The Replacements"", in which psychic parasites replace babies, turning women against their men and effectively creating an army of homeless men...Hey, wait a minute, that's happening right now. I guess this is a scary parable for marriage.
Also WEB OF DESIRES contains ""Menage A Trois"", where a crippled woman forces her hired help to become sexual puppets. One of the creepiest love stories ever filmed, courtesy of the ever-chilling Karen Black.
This is an awesome collection that both titillates and terrifies. Each tape has four tales that are about half an hour each, so it's a very good value.",1074038400,4,980,5.0184049079754605
7994205,5,B00009XN53,"This DVD is a collection of four episodes from the Showtime series The Hunger.  Each episode is complete unto itself.  The first is introduced by Terence Stamp and the other by David Bowie.  In a strange packaging mishap, the pictures on the back of the case; two from Strange Bedfellows and one from Web of Desires.
In the first story, a wife-to-be is warned about the non-human nature of her future husband and his family.  They must fight mind control if they wish to regain freedom.
Next, an artist enters a false marriage to avoid deportation.  But his new token wife is not normal.  She goes through a personality change every week.
Next a young doctor stumbles on a plot involving women and small baby-sized creatures that control their minds.  A real spooky one.
Finally, a woman moves into an old apartment building and is terrorized by someone peeking through the mail slot.  She is determined to keep her new home and not let anything interfere.
Four creepy tales representing the best of the series.  As this is a Showtime series there is plenty of nudity and sex thus making it inappropriate for some viewers.",1070323200,5,1122,4.712820512820513
