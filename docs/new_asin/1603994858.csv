7800215,4,1603994858,"After having purchased this set back in late 2011, I quickly watched all of the episodes in a few sittings and managed to feel sort of empty by the time the show was over. SWAMP THING--THE SERIES, after all, had turned out to be one of my favorite and most anticipated viewing experiences, despite some of the quirky plotting that was done during the series' run (that ultimately made me question just exactly what it was that the writers of this show were smoking), and after it was finally over I had the feeling that the show was over before its time. After recently discovering that the show was supposed to have ran for 100 episodes (instead of the meager 72 shows that we now have in this nice new DVD set) I decided to go back and re-watch the episodes this year. If you have read my extensive reviews of volumes one and two previously published here on Amazon, you already have a general sense of how I feel about the show's content, so below I will offer you some insights about this particular DVD set. Things begin near the middle of season three (which we were already well into by the time the second DVD box set ended), so what we have here is the conclusion to the third season. The DVD transfers included here are excellent, and the sound is a quite good overall. We get four DVDs included in this set, with six episodes included upon each disc. The DVD case is a clear plastic standard box, with the DVDs held inside by a snap-in disc holder that can be turned back and forth inside of the box. The cover art is quite good, and the DVD insert sleeve is a double-sided offering with each episode listed on the inside of the insert sleeve (which you can view through the clear case itself once the box is opened), but the episode titles are not included on the DVDs themselves (which is the same presentation as the older discs). The disc menus are similar to the other discs in this series of DVD releases, which allows viewers to select each individual episode (no chapter headings included here since the episodes themselves are only twenty-two minutes in length per title). Overall, the third season is not nearly as memorable as the previous two seasons were, but the episodes themselves are just as entertaining. If you are in a blue mood and need a change, this series will have you turning green in no time. Also, a viewer should be aware that the following episodes are collected here in the order that they were initially supposed to have been sequenced in terms of the overarching narrative (not that we can truly follow the bricolage-wielding style of these series writers anyway!) and NOT in the order that they first appeared back on the USA channel in the early 90's.
The conclusion of the third season begins with an episode entitled ""Lesser of Two Evils,"" in which Tyne Daly guest stars as a ruthless business tycoon who pushes the ever-vengeful Anton Arcane out of his place at his industrial plant and becomes Swampy's newest worry. Daly, of course, manages to steal the show, but for my taste this episode is yet another ""wedge-in-the-doorway"" entry which only serves to distract us from the main narrative arc of the previous shows. ""Revelations"" follows Graham and his cohorts into the swamp to hunt down Alec and destroy him, but we are also concerned about Tressa Kipp being left alone with a wounded visitor who may know more about the swamp than he appears to at first. ""Future Tense"" gives us a vision of how the swamp will be compromised by bad chemicals in the future. ""Hide in the Night"" finds the narcissistic Arcane managing to turn himself into some type of bat-looking creature, and of course it falls upon Swamp Thing to help stop his path of destruction. This episode has an intriguing premise, but it quickly degenerates into a B-movie finish. ""Pay Day"" finds three prison escapees hoping to use the swamp as a hideaway before the authorities catch up to them, but Swamp Thing has a few moral lessons to offer the thieves. ""The Return of LaRoche"" begins with Anton Arcane getting smacked around in his bedroom at night (in his black underwear, no less, presumably because there were also a lot of female viewers of this show) by a man whom he believes is Carter LaRoche (one of his arch nemeses) but the catch is that Carter is attempting to try some hypnotic trickery upon everyone's favorite tour guide...Will Kipp! This episode bespeaks the kind of quirky plotting that I miss so much about lesser television programs, as the show begins in a somewhat creepy manner and then just gets more involving from there. Unfortunately, it is yet another mystery that is wrapped up in about twenty minutes time. The episode entitled ""Rites of Passage"" involves Will getting a bit testy with two Valley Girl squealers who have come to the jungle in the hopes that they can perform some type of mysterious ritual that will help them achieve their future goals (since they sound like spoiled rich girls with genetically pre-mapped futures, it is hard to imagine what else they could both possibly want out of this life!)--but Swampy knows that the ritual will do more harm than good. The episode entitled ""Never Alone"" features the great character actor Ray Wise as a wounded man who shows up on Tressa Kipp's doorstep for help, and before long Tressa is beginning to wonder if the man is actually making up stories about his past upon an alien planet! Of course, Wise's character has already had a run-in with Alec, and the conflict that develops here is most interesting, with a finish that is rather touching (if not all that unexpected--this is a ""Sky Fi"" show, remember?). In ""A Most Bitter Pill,"" we get to watch the skilled thespian that is Mark Lindsay Chapman go through his monologue spewing stint while trapped inside of an oxygen-drained cave with a wounded Swampy lying in the background (it's no secret where the remaining oxygen went by the episode's conclusion). The monologue itself runs the gamut from the blasphemous to the self-effacing, and this particular Hamlet-esque entry only serves to reiterate my point that a less talented actor might have served the role of Arcane better in this particular series (but I am not taking anything away from Chapman's acting abilities, mind you, I just can't help but wonder if maybe he thought that this show might have been beneath his own versatile capabilities). I won't dare disclose the ending of this one! In any case, it was nice that Tom Blomquist offered Chapman the opportunity to do a solo episode, as the results are quite memorable overall. In ""The Curse,"" a creepy looking mummy appears out of nowhere (while still in his tomb) in the swamp--I know, it's incredible, stop chortling--and ol' Swampy has to have a conversation with him to help talk him out of revenging himself upon a nearby foe. This is not a bad episode really, but it reminds me of the same kind of over-the-top theatrics that were employed in the episode ""This Old House of Mayan"" (that title still makes me guffaw out loud), and in the end it's just too incredible, even for a show like this. In ""Judgment Day,"" Will winds up in the wrong place at the wrong time (a diner on the edge of town--sound familiar?) and is inadvertently framed for the murder of his cute girlfriend's father (wouldn't you know it?). I mean, where does Will find these chicks?! Anyway, one thing that always bothered me about Will's character is that he is a pretty decent guy and after a time one might think that the town's people would come to accept this (even despite Will's own reform school background), but no. In each episode, Will is guilty until proven innocent, or at least that is how the antagonistic townspeople seem to view him. Anyway, this episode draws you in with its mysterious setup, and remains gripping until the end when Swamp Thing has to offer Will a few of his own private detective skills to help find the real culprit. In ""Eye of the Storm"" (an episode written by someone named Brenda Lilly--a pseudonym, perhaps?), Tressa's sister returns to Houma after a long period of not having contacted her (beautiful) sister of the marsh, and eventually a complicated plot unfolds having to do with the lady's (now deceased) husband and some documents that some baddies desperately want back. Even though we finally hear an update about the Jim Kipp case in this particular episode, it is glossed over much too matter-of-factly, and the espionage-style of this particular episode again pushes us into a realm of storytelling that we hadn't quite expected. Still, this is a very entertaining entry overall. ""Vendetta"" features the gorgeous Peggy O'Neal as General Sunderland's (sexy) daughter, who turns up at Arcane's insidious fear factory (under an alias) with the intention of meting out some righteous vengeance upon Anton (but things don't quite go as planned). The lovely Blake Pickett is the star of the episode entitled ""The Burning Times,"" in which she plays a burned-on-the-behind witch (here come the proverbial occult themes again, look out) out to prove to Will Kipp that she ""knew him"" in a past life (and after Will gets a look at her he is pretty much willing to believe anything she says...and, honestly, I don't blame him!). This story is pretty formulaic overall, but we are here for the actors and the swamp monster, so why carp? ""The Specter of Death"" finds a noisy spirit going after Graham and Arcane in their laboratory, but the spirit may turn out to be someone who Arcane knows all too well. In ""Cross-Fired,"" writers Bruce Cervi and John Lansing offer Mark Lindsay Chapman yet another chance to stretch his acting abilities, and this time he ends up changing personalities with Alec, which makes the mad doctor into a much nicer guy for a time--and eventually endears him to Tressa Kipp, who has now begun to develop some feelings for the man she has so often despised. Unfortunately, Swamp Thing has now begun to fulfill the role of evil that Arcane has left behind. This was a fairly good story for so late in the season, and the finish (while not unexpected) is at least finalized with some imagination this time. In ""Patient Zero,"" Alan Bergmann guest stars as an ailing man who wants to know Arcane's secrets but fails to realize just how dangerous that the man is. This one remains interesting due to Arcane's efforts at blowing out Swamp Thing's vocal chords by way of shooting him in the throat! But even this cruel tactic doesn't keep Alec from attempting to help the patient stop a devious plot before his untimely demise. The Biblically-themed episode entitled ""In the Beginning"" (just kidding!) follows Arcane's attempts at creating a plant-robot hybrid...need I go further? Actually, this episode deserves points just because of how darned funny that it actually is. Swamp Thing literally has to convince the robot that he isn't a plant and that he needs to go back home to his laboratory--I'm not kidding. Eventually, after ""Plantbot"" goes berserk and takes out for the swamp on his own, Alec attempts to deck the thing by punching the hunkajunk in the face--I'm not kidding. But, at the very least, we can't say that this episode isn't memorable. ""Brotherly Love"" features the oft-spotted David Rupprecht as a man after Tressa's own heart (boy would I be after her heart!), but Tressa (again making me question just how long it is going to take her to open her, er, arms to a member of the opposite sex again--my God, what did Jim's father do to this poor woman?!) isn't quite ready for a commitment. Unfortunately for beautiful Tressa, Brad Hewett's bro Kurt is back in town, and he wants to teach the nervous-fingered guy a thing or two about portrayal (this episode has one of the most awkwardly rigged pistol-shooting devices that I personally have ever witnessed...then again, I really haven't witnessed that many). Again, this episode only serves to remind us that the series has lost its way in terms of a definable story arc, not that the producers had much time to stew about it. Ahoy, mateys! Grab yer eye-patches and your rapiers because it's time for the episode entitled ""Yo Ho Ho"" (no, this one's not about Will's newest girlfriend). Not only is this episode one of the most unbelievable entries in the series, it is also, conversely, one of the more amusing entries overall. Alec and Will rig up some type of device that can change a boy into a man (talk about pseudo-scientific implausibility!), which certainly helps when a young pirate (at least in his own mind) played by child actor Shane Obedzinski (yes, he was in THE SANDLOT) discovers some nasty doings by Arcane (why did he wonder out to the factory like he did, anyway?) and eventually ends up having to impress his own mother by magically transforming into a grown man (played here by James Zelley) and defeating the persistently wicked Anton in a duel to the death (not really). While it is great fun to watch Chapman demonstrate his swashbuckling skills in the muck-encrusted swampland, the finish to this particular entry is just too absurd to swallow (plus, the swamp seems to attract oddball types who apparently have no business being there but wonder out there anyway for some reason). Well good Lord, even Zeus himself shows up in the episode entitled ""Heart of Stone,"" in which the gods attempt to play a game of chess using the people of the swamp as their pawns. While the premise of this episode is a little more imaginative than most, the subsequent unfolding of events are simply not all that noteworthy or memorable. In ""Romancing Arcane,"" the lovely Kristina Feil turns up in a role as Arcane's newest foxy love interest, but she ends up turning the tables upon the narcissistic dude and a rampage of action scenes quickly ensues (in fact, this episode has very little romance but quite a few chase scenes and almost nonstop action). Again, though, we still have no overarching storyline to cling to emotionally. ""Heart of the Mantis"" is an interesting episode in which Arcane is suspected (even by Swampy) of having killed a gifted scientist who died with secrets that Arcane would practically kill to get ahold of--but it turns out that the lady pretending to be the scientist's grieving daughter (played here by Cheryl Hines) may have plans for those secrets that do not involve Arcane's assistance. This episode is an interesting diversion, for sure, and is somewhat more memorable than the other episodes contained in this box. Our final episode is called ""That's a Wrap,"" and, while it is rather hastily wrapped up, it has several interesting things about it, not the least of which is the appearance of the super sexy Candace Miller (that shot when she leans in to speak to the police investigator...yummy!) in a particularly devious role as a fetching femme fatale with more than a passing interest in Anton. As if Mister Arcane's ego needed more stroking yet, a local TV company has decided to write and produce a film about the scientist's life (I guess they were desperate for material?), which, of course, leads the ever controlling Arcane to monitor the production very closely (with Graham being the one to ultimately get his feelings hurt after his part is unceremoniously cut out of the final shooting script). While several opportunities for meta-fictional satire are clearly missed in this one, it is fun to see what happens during the show's final few minutes, and really they pack quite a lot of information into this one narrative (and we even get to see Swamp Thing take a bullet for dear Tressa--I think Alec is the man that she truly wants, but that's just my theory, hee hee). Swamp Thing waves goodbye to us in this last episode, and when I viewed this seven years ago I waved back at the screen, held in a suspension of wonder as to what more might have been.
In my opinion, the swamp that the crew at Universal studios built for this particular series was nothing short of incredible. Each episode actually does succeed at pulling us into the swamp itself, and that is a tribute to all of the set designers who labored away upon this show. In fact, I give applause to everyone who worked on this production, from Dick Durock (doing an incredible interpretation of the Alec Holland character) to the composer of the rustic voodoo-oriented musical theme, Christopher Stone himself (whose score actually captures the mood of the series perfectly). When I waved goodbye to this series many years ago, I came away disappointed. I wanted more, and I expected a more dramatic (and comic book oriented) conclusion. But, for what we have, I do have to say that the show has many talented people's work to recommend it, even if it is a bit off the beaten path as far as most television productions are concerned (especially these days). It is a rather awkward show, but I enjoy it for its non-traditional approach and its quirky thematic qualities. Still, I would have accepted another twenty-eight episodes without hesitation, especially if they had in mind a reunion episode involving the Jim Kipp character. As it is, we are left with more hanging threads than anyone would ever care to thimble, but in the end one can tell that a lot of creative passion went into this series and I feel that (in general, at least) the show has yet to be given its due. As for the Swamp Thing character, I remember reading an online article about an unproduced script of Len Wein's (who is, sadly, no longer with us today) that was floating around Hollywood years ago and I wondered to myself why no one decided to greenlight a NEW Swamp Thing solo theatrical film as of yet. In addition to the green-soaked remake of THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, the revamping of Swamp Thing film franchise is one of the few (and I mean very few) movies that I look forward to seeing made and released one day soon (I hope). With all due respect to Jim Wynorski, THE RETURN OF THE SWAMP THING simply did not get enough of the character right for my taste. Now that Amazon.com is no longer offering this particular item for sale, fans may have to rummage about the dark corners of the Internet in order to catch the conclusion of this much maligned series. While I personally prefer the quiet poetry and the developing story arc of the first season of episodes, there is no denying that SWAMP THING--THE SERIES: Volume Three is pretty good for what it is. And, in my humble estimation at least, it's another keeper. I only wish that some extras would have been included here (my how I would have appreciated some writers commentaries for this one!) but at least we have the episodes in their proper order and with tremendous visual transfers. And remember: ""The swamp is my world! It is who I am...it is what I am. Do not bring your evil here, I warn you! Beware the wrath of...Swamp Thing!""

Even though I love Wes Craven's movies, and to a lesser extent, Jim Wynorski's, I'd like to see what they could do with technology being so much more advanced these days, I guess we'll see. Most of the loose ends were tied up nicely, leaving only a few still open-ended. If you didn't like the movies, the show may give you some welcome surprises, but try to watch it with an open mind and remember: it was made in the early 90s when special f/x took a back seat for story telling, how movies and shows are flipped these days and Hollywood isn't losing money, is surprising to me, although usually I try to remain open-minded in most cases. Re-makes and sequels I try to take on their own merits, most of the time, unless they're an exact duplicate, in which case I have a hard time with those.
