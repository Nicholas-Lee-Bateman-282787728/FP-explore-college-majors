8481695,5,B005OQU6S6,"Seriously one of the funniest and most off-beat movies I have ever seen. I cant compare the humor in this to anything else I've ever seen but I fully feel like everyone should check it out. Some of it is over the top and some of it is so subtle, but its all amazing none the less. I feel like it takes a certain type of person to enjoy this movie ... and I, at least, am just that person.",1421452800,,388,3.8625
8481696,5,B005OQU6S6,"I'm glad I took a chance on watching this - totally worth it! I love movies that are ridiculous with crazy characters and all kinds of weirdness, trashy humor, just everything was perfect! New favorite movie for sure!",1379203200,,217,4.7368421052631575

8481698,5,B005OQU6S6,"A great movie,  so much different than what is out there.  I enjoyed it so much and highly recommend it but not to the masses but to the few who can appreciate art in film.

8481699,1,B005OQU6S6,"A low budget script of a high school student who wants to play JC in the school play version of the '70s stage/movie JC Superstar. That student is in an accident and ends up in a wheel chair but still wants the role. Usual weird if not bizarre not too likable school personal, parents who drink and behave crudely and teens looking for drugs, drinking and partying.  A cheap take on Glee except that the acting wouldn't pass a high school drama course and the singing was even worse. Predictably he gets the role and everybody does a screeching song and conga line dance to close the performance.",1333497600,2,596,4.518518518518518
8481700,4,B005OQU6S6,"You probably won't watch this one with all your friends. It definitely is for acquired tastes. If you're into John Waters type, semi trashy films, that strike back against certain self righteous groups, I would say you will enjoy it. This is probably how they enticed JW to do the religious figure cameo, in the drug induced strip bar sequence. The characters are funny and quirky with a quasi-realistic trailer park charm. I give it 4 stars for doing what it does well. The staging of the musical number could have been a little shorter without taking away from tne story.",1323648000,3,573,4.683168316831683
8481701,5,B005OQU6S6,I was lucky enough to catch MANGUS! at a festival last year. I highly recommend checking it out. Jennifer Coolidge is at her best and the rest of the cast is on par! It's worth checking out just to see John Waters cameo as Jesus--great stuff. I'll be on the lookout for more of Ash's films.,1323043200,5,290,4.196428571428571
8481702,5,B005OQU6S6,Ok... I loved this movie. Saw it at a film festival in Provincetown. It's perfectly quirky and darkly funny. Jennifer Coolidge is hilarious... It's sort of a throw back to 70's comedies and it's interesting to see that done now in the land of big budget studio films... a must see for anyone looking to laugh and not take themselves too seriously.,1320278400,7,347,4.612903225806452
