8343146,5,B001U8YAFC,"I am a 'Learn To Swim' instructor at a recreation center where I teach classes and give private swimming lessons, and I also coach the two youngest groups of swimmers at the Loveland Swim Club (3-6 yrs old) in Colorado. I got my money's worth in the first minute of viewing - as soon as I saw Steve's use of mirrors! And there was much more. I bought the foam head, and the modeling 'doll' and the kids eyes just lit up when I brought these out. I put the modeling doll in ""Position 11"" and had him glide forward through the water. Yes I could have done this myself - and do - but just the novelty of using it had a brand new 3-yr old private student immitate the position and glide forward PERFECTLY. I am having trouble getting the acrylic mirrors, but know they will be a fantastic hit and learning tool as soon as I do. - Sheryl",1319328000,,832,4.1419753086419755
