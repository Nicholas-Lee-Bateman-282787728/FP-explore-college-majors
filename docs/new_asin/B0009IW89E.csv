8061636,5,B0009IW89E,I loved this show when I was just a small girl. Gave this set to my mom!,1265587200,,72,3.2941176470588234
8061637,5,B0009IW89E,"This amazing Documentary was ahead of it's time. Before Laguna Beach, before Survivor, before all the reality shows we know today, Dallas set the bar for great reality TV that has LOTS of Drama, even more than LC, Lo, Stephen, Trey, Jason, Kristen, and Talon can bring us on the most recent reality show to have a city name as it's title, Laguna Beach. MTV thinks they are really on to something, but Dallas did the same thing like 20 years ago. How's that for thinking outside the box?! If you want good drama, get the first 3 seasons of this documentary about the oil tycoons in Texas. I heard it's George Bush's favorite show!",1134604800,,629,4.478260869565218
