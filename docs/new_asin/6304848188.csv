935911,4,6304848188,"This movie came to me at a convention. Where i meet the cast and they were great..
the movie reminds me of the Ed Wood days and with Dolores Fuller(Jailbait),
Conrad Brooks(Plan 9 from outer space) and Deana which played Nadia was super.
Just heard of DEANA's new movie about a true GHOST story called
""The Ghosts of Angela Webb"" on mvp dvd...
Based on a story from Milford NJ...
it is great to see the B-MOVIE movement getting better.
This Company MVP rocks..",1068508800,4,460,4.488095238095238
935912,3,6304848188,This flick is based on a true story and not bad. It's a small independant movie so take it for what it is and you might enjoy it. I loved Nadia!,1067385600,,144,3.6774193548387095
935913,3,6304848188,"I picked this flick up at a horror convention and found it cheaply made, but enjoyable. The director used the same line he used on the other reviewer on this page about the Sopranos being filmed in the same area, but I thought that was more of a statement of fact tinged with classic cinematic pitchman ballyhoo than anything else and found him to be a very charming guy. Why on earth would anyone expect anything else from a guy in an Ed Wood shirt selling a low low budget horror flick about a vampire in Newark?

This one is played mostly in a serious manner. I found that to be very refreshing when compared to the newer trend among low budget video makers of just making everything a comedy. Classic flicks like Blood Of Dracula's Castle were played seriously and The Ironbound Vampire is part of that same tradition, which doesnt mean there isn't some funny stuff here both intentional and unintentional.

I happen to think that Johnny Link is one wacked dude in this thing and one of the creepiest vampire assistants ever! I wouldn't want to meet Johnny in a dark alley! Even standard lines like ""Let's get outta here"" are made weird by this guy. Ed Wood veteran Conrad Brooks is here too, and plays an achetypical creepy butler and has a goofy bit of old school silliness involving a beverage served at a party which looks a lot like blood. Brooks is a lot better here than he has been in a lot of the flicks he's made since Plan 9. It's also nice to see Ed Wood's gal pal Dolores Fuller in the cast too.

Deanna Enoches really shines as a bewitching female vampire whose limited screen time makes her all that much more mysterious. Deanna has some great moments here and this is the first flick featuring her that I saw and I would love to see her in more of this sort of thing. Some of her dialog is like vampiric poetry and that's a nice touch especially since most so called vampire flicks these days are low budget porn (not that there's anything wrong with that) with no real vampiric personality. Matyskiel certainly looks the part of a Cruise/Pitt style vampire and there's also an interesting soundtrack to this one.

The makers of this low budget movie took a step in the right direction by playing it mainly serious. Maybe they stumbled  a bit after taking that step, but it was a good try. The camera work is professional, but the obvious shoe-string budget and lack of acting talent on the part of some of the participants (obviously friends and family members of the director since he could not afford a full cast of professional actors), are the main reasons this flick misses the mark as anything other than a low low budget affair. If you appreciate movies like Blood of Dracula's Castle, and can take this for what it is, you might enjoy the Irondbound Vampire too.",1061164800,2,2791,4.497041420118343
935914,1,6304848188,"Spare yourself and do not buy this horrible cheesy movie. The plot has something to do with a cop who is tracking down this vampire guy, with the aid (or interference) of some reporter. The  acting in high school plays is much better, plot development was horrible, camera work sucked, and oh yea, if you like vampire T and A this movie has none of that either. So, basically this movie has NOTHING. Try another title and good luck.",978825600,4,432,4.468354430379747

7878604,1,6304848188,"This low budget movie was exactly that.  The actors were horrible and said their lines line they were reading them without expression.  The plot was lame.  I've seen other low budget films that were very good, but this one most certainly did not fall into that category. I'd advise others to steer clear of it and find something worth seeing.",1357084800,,342,4.666666666666667
7878605,2,6304848188,"I gave this movie two stars solely for the presence of Conrad Brooks and Dolores Fuller, B-movie heroes from the classic Ed Wood days. The movie itself is, however, horrible. It is extremely difficult to follow and has numerous pointless plot elements introduced at seemingly totally random times. The film, directed by Karl Petry, has exceptionally bad acting and possibly the worst accents I can ever recall in a motion picture. Combine that with amateurish editing, very bad music, and awful sound effects and this is a pretty potent package.

The movie is highly narrated to keep the plot as lucid as possible. The storyline itself concerns an outbreak of vampirism in Newark, although much of the film is shown as a flashback to World War One. There are subplots about a woman becoming impregnated by a ghost on a washing machine in an amusement park, as well as spontaneous casket combustion. Important legal and ethical questions are also introduced: the ACLU says that vampires have rights as a minority, while the Veterans Administration becomes involved because the vampirism is a service related injury. If this all sounds like a mess, it is.

This is one of the least coherent, incompetently made films I have ever seen, and I can't recommend it except for the amusing presence of Brooks and Fuller.

The highlight of the film for me was the credit line that read ""Creative Consultant Zak Snygg"", so at least the credits have some entertainment value.",1211068800,6,1463,4.91497975708502

7878608,2,6304848188,"A true piece of rancid head-cheese, THE IRONBOUND VAMPIRE has the look and feel of the kind of movie I'd make, which is why I'm NOT a movie director! Scenes jump about, making little or no sense. I know it's about a hippie vampire guy and his harem of toothy ghoulfriends, but the rest of the characters were so bloodless, they all seemed undead! This one gets an extra star for the naughty gal-pal stuff near the end...",1152057600,2,420,4.397435897435898
7878609,1,6304848188,"Some years back, movies entered the anti-hero era. the heroes became less defined, less pure. This movie may be trying to go one better on that one. It may be an attempt to begin the anti movie era. The acting, writing, lighting, etc. are just plum awful. One favorite moment is where the lead vampire says ""I could have been a great actor."" There is a dramatic pause afterward where I was wanting somebody, anybody to ask him: ""So what happened?"" I can't imagine who might like this movie...I really can't. If you go ahead and buy it anyway, don't say I didn't warn you.",1142726400,3,571,4.447619047619048

Enough B-movie stuff to pass the time and haven't seen Conrad Brooks this good before and have sat through too many movies with him than I care to admit. Dolores Fuller is in this one too so Ed Wood fans should give give it a look. Man the vampire's hair had an Interview With A Vampire look to it! Rock on dude! The World War One angle was unique - Then again maybe it's true! I liked the hot vampire girl!...,1069372800,3,483,4.094736842105263
