8058966,4,B0009ALYK6,"There are two reasons to see this movie, and that is not a pun:

First, it is an unusually apt example of the ""exploitation"" (Read: Softcore sex) movies of the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s. There was a time before videotape when motion picture producers tried to come as close as possible to what was called ""obscenity"" without actually crossing that line. The problem was that the definition of ""obscene"" varied from state to state and from community to community.

Second, there are always fans of Roberta Pedon trying to get ahold of the only ""mainsteam"" movie she was in. Roberta, like thousands of California girls, wanted to be an actress more desperately than was good for her, and this dreadful effort was the high point of her efforts. Despite the over-the-top directing, despite Michael Pataki's insane-hamster-on-speed acting, despite the ridiculously fake accent Roberta affected, and despite the producer's insistence that Roberta's breasts fall out of her clothes in almost every scene she had, something of the complexity of her tormented life comes through in her performance.

Moreover, the movie was an odd moment in ""B"" cinema history. It brings together an assortment of big-boobed models of the era --Roberta, Nika Movenka, Sharon Kelly-- and a strange assortment of those people we all recognize from bit parts, but never knew.

Sharon Kelly, of course, went on to do several other ""exploitation"" movies and, under the nom-de-porn ""Coleen Brennan"", quite a bit of hardcore pornography as well as roles in both Russ Meyer movies and ""Shampoo"" with Warren Beatty.

Lastly, this movie is not for anyone looking for plot, character development, or anything approaching realism. The most ""realistic"" role belongs to George ""Buck"" Flower who plays a farmer with perhaps the worst premature ejaculation problem since the young Roy Scheider in ""All That Jazz"".",1146614400,11,1872,5.185430463576159
