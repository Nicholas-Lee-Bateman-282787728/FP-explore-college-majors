2654160,5,B000I9Z2CY,"Smile, Jenny, You're Dead is still excellent. It is mood and plot and characterization and  dialogue. It's David Janssen as private detective Harry O. He is perfect. Every word, every move, every inflection, it's his alone. You hear him thinking, and he's every bit as good at this as he was as Richard Kimble. And that's really saying something too. From his very first scene, he is hypnotizing. He could convey with  the slightest gesture.

He makes Harry funny, iconoclastic, wry and deeply human, deeply compassionate. The cast is impeccable. The storyline riveting. The writer was Howard Rodman. One of the best. John Anderson, Andrea Marcovicci, Clu Gulager, Jodie Foster and Howard de Silva put their interpretations on the words  and make them their own. When Harry says to Jenny, ""You move me, I want you,"" our hearts go out to him, and when it's his duty to  tell of death a second time to a person whose world has just ended, what else could you do but hold her through the night, let her cry, admit to yourself that you fell in love with her then and knowing of course, it can lead in only one direction.

I'm told David Janssen always gave credit to his writers. As he should, but also for himself, and for this ensemble cast, and superb direction by Jerry Thorpe,  this is a minor miracle or a major one. His character and the film fit beautifully. Everything is so eloquent and eloquent, and you feel like crying because there's been a point of life touched here, and we have the  honor, thanks to very talented people, to see such a good and fine thing.

  It is suspenseful and has  an excellent framework, so you won't be disappointed in that either. That boat Harry O was constantly working on, name of THE ANSWER, and the bus he  rode "" because you can sit and look out the window and think. Try it sometime."" And because his car was always in the shop and we just had to get David Janssen on the bus again. All of these things and more became endearing to us.

And when he smiled, the whole world is incandescent. This is a treasure trove, this movie, and it is all life-giving,  every word and every scene with these actors saying Howard Rodman's lovingly crafted, thoughtful, profound dialogue, with such relish, and how because  it's been for something.

And sometimes all you can do for a person in pain is to hold them through the night, admit to yourself you have fallen in love with them, and prepare to say goodbye. And maybe this is as close to the answer as you can get.  Smile Jenny, You're Dead, you move me.",1321056000,27,2541,4.498910675381263
2654161,5,B000I9Z2CY,Great to see DJ as Harry-O again.  Good cast and very good story for the time (70's TV).  Thanks Amazon,1318464000,4,103,4.1
2654162,5,B000I9Z2CY,"Five Stars for the movie and for David Janssen.

I have seen this TV movie numerous times and can only hope that this release will be the full version, and remastered to some degree. Smile Jenny You're Dead was the second pilot for the TV series Harry O.  It set the standard for this wonderful, fondly remembered show.  Janssen is just superb!  He was born to play this role and has just the right melancholy touch; he underplays to perfection.  And his first person narration allows us in on his personal world.

The supporting cast is mostly terrific too.  Andrea Marcovicci plays the beautiful, vulnerable Jenny of the title.  She is both lovely and fragile.  It's a great performance, and it's easy to see why Harry feels protective and ultimately falls in love with her.  Her stalker is played by Zalman King.  Another great performance!  King makes a first rate psychopath.  Other fine performances come from TV veteran John Anderson, Clu Gulager, and a very young and confidently precocious Jodie Foster.  The atmospheric incidental music and direction by Jerry Thorpe, (one of TV's finest from that era) make for a first class package.  A series had to follow!

As I say, I hope this DVD Release is quickly followed by the entire series with some extras - PLEASE!  Commentaries from Henry Darrow, Anthony Zerbe, Les Lannom (the inimitable Lester) and other series regulars would be real treat.  One can but hope.

Enjoy!",1307923200,34,1429,4.830578512396694

2654165,5,B000I9Z2CY,"Was never a fan of David Janssen, but now I am. He is delightful as Harry Orwell, funny, grumpy, old(er),  emotional, good-hearted, heartbreaking - especially in this of 2 pilots ! also the series is wonderful, despite the changes of his playground (from San Diego to Los Angeles), the lack of a true continuing concept (like in The Fugitive). But it is HE, David Janssen, who carries the series. We want HIM to observe, how HE plays & forms the character of this because of a non-removal bullitt in is back retired police officer, who is forced to earn some extra money as an private investigator ! How he travels by bus, because his old Austin Healy is constantly in repair, how he ""battleling"" with his former police collegues  or would he finished his boat ""The Answer"" (what a name for a boat) - I wish I could see more.  A shame & a pity, that the series was cancelled after 2 seasons , because of the awful ""Charlie's Angels"". (this is how I stopped watching US TV series in the 70s !)  A great waste of a great talent ! I must say this, like many others in this forum !
""Smile Jenny, You're Dead"" - is a great film, not only for the TV format. Catchy story (about stalking), catchy performances of all actors, esp. Janssen and  Andrea Marcovicci (wasn' she the partner of Anthony Newley in his ""Chaplin"" musical ??)
""Smile Jenny, You're dead"" is private detective film in his best noirish way, with a dropout, cynical detective who silently and tenderly falls in love with a beautiful mysterious woman (Marcovicci).
Marvelous voice overs: ""I kept hoping I'd reach her. I kept hoping I wouldn't reach her...I had better days,"" Even this almost unbelievable relationship is so believable acted with a hitting end !
I recommend this film very much ! With every watching you discover more of a great, so terrible underrated actor - David Janssen at his best !!!",1421971200,7,1865,4.57185628742515

2654167,5,B000I9Z2CY,It is great to see this long lost made for TV movie finally make it to DVD. Now us die hard David Janssen and Harry O fans can finally have all of the Harry O show on disc. The picture and sound quality is stellar. It is a great transfer from a great print I do not think this show looked that good when I saw it on TV in 1974. I loved it! It is your typical made for TV movie but is a good story and really gives you insight into the Harry O character that he will portray in the series. I would say this is a must for anyone planning on watching the whole series on DVD. I would start with the first two pilots. This one and the other one that comes in the season one DVD set. It is true there are no bonus's and it just comes in a standard DVD case but who needs extras it is the movie you really want to watch. As for the price it is fair for an on demand product that is made for a very limited audience that probably is also the reason there are no extras. I would give an A+ to Warner Bros TV for finally dusting off this long lost TV movie and making it available for  us to enjoy again! It is will worth the price of admission.,1397606400,3,1136,3.7932489451476794
2654168,5,B000I9Z2CY,"David Janssen is one of my favorite actors and Harry Orwell is his best character.  This is more movie than tv show pilot, but it introduces Harry Orwell character.  There were so many tv detectives, but Harry Orwell was different than most.  He was older, had a bad back and was grumpy most of the time.  This is not so much grumpy, but still does have the overall feel of the character and the series.  We enjoyed seeing it again.",1393459200,2,432,4.35
2654169,4,B000I9Z2CY,"There were two pilots done for Harry O. One comes in the Season One DVD set, ""Such Dust as Dreams Are Made On"" and this one which you have to buy separately, which was disappointing after paying a lot for the series sets -- but I am glad I purchased it.  The acting is well done and it is a thriller because there is a serial killer out there and Harry is trying to prevent the main character from being one of the victims while he is investigating to find out WHO it is and why.

All are done in DVD-R: the seasons and this pilot.  The transfers are great, we watched the movie and part of season one on a 50"" HD Plasma TV. The audio is Dolby Digital English Only Mono, the aspect ratio is 1.37:1 and is 4x3.  The show is c 1974, renewed 2002 and the DVD-R is copyright 2011 Warner Bros Enterprises, Inc., Distributed by Warner Home Video.  It runs 90 minutes.

The TV movie includes the following actors: Starring David Janssen, Guest Starring: John Anderson, Howard Da Silva, Martin Gabel, Clu Gulater, Zalman King, Tim McIntire, Andrea Marcovicci, co-star Jodie Foster.

This movie is worth purchasing and is a good addition to the season 1 and 2 sets.",1380412800,4,1156,4.373831775700935
2654170,5,B000I9Z2CY,"There are actors who portray roles in theater, film and television. Then there are the actors who meld into those roles. They become the vehicle rather than just the driver. David was one of those. What more can I say?",1376524800,4,218,4.475
2654171,4,B000I9Z2CY,The wonderful David Janssen in one of the two pilots made for this show.  His ability to underplay his character is the endearing quality of of this series that didn't last nearly long enough.,1375056000,,192,4.647058823529412
2654172,1,B000I9Z2CY,"I'm a huge fan of Harry O, and remember the show fondly when it was on TV back in the 70's.  I've purchased both seasons on DVD, and have liked almost every one of the episodes.  I still think it's a shame it was cancelled after only two seasons.  David Janssen was great in the role, and it was definitely ahead of its time.  I thought the other pilot ""Such Dust as Dreams are Made Of"" included with Season 1, in which Harry takes a case from the guy (Martin Sheen) who put a bullet in his back, was very good.  That being said, this pilot is dreadful!  I can see why it was not used to launch the original show.  Even the most hard core Harry O fans will be disappointed, especially at the inflated price for teh DVD.  The story is predictable, the script laughable at times, and the acting - especially the lead actress whoever she is -- is just flat out terrible.  It's really poor quality overall compared to the well above-average show that Harry O was.  As a stand-alone episode of Harry O, it's by far the worst of them all.  I wish it would have stayed buried away forever.  Beware Harry O fans - I'm sorry I bought it.",1370736000,4,1128,4.195348837209302

And now Harry O Season 1, six disks twenty-two episodes plus the original pilot, is now available on DVD.

It currently is only available made-to-order through the WBShop.com, but on that page it mentions it will soon also be available for purchase through Amazon and other entities.

I've already ordered, and if the quality is as I hope it will be, I will be ordering more for family members.

So everyone rejoice, buy early and buy often... I will. We want to make sure they make Season 2 available too.",1342137600,3,603,4.607476635514018
2654179,5,B000I9Z2CY,"David Janssen looks down at his shoes and mumbles a lot but still manages to solve the crime.  Zalman King looks tormented and talks to himself.  Maybe not the best writing, but still very entertaining.  Whoever has the rights to the Harry O series needs to buckle down and turn out a nice box set.",1326153600,7,298,4.381818181818182

I usually fly down and visit her a couple of times a year and we have a weekend of binge-watching old movies and eating comfort food.  We got about halfway through this one and stopped watching it. It just didn't hold up well. It was a pilot, so perhaps it lacked the charm that the later ones in the series had, but I decided not to buy the two series boxes  that were sitting in my shopping cart.  I wish Amazon Prime or Netflix would make them available. I want to see them, but I don't want to own them.",1497052800,,594,3.8524590163934427
