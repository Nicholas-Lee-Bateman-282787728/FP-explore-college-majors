8520427,4,B007PK9N4C,I can appreciate this documentary. It was nice to see fans express their journey with Michael. Especially the lady who came to know and like Michael after his passing. Very moving that she expresses she wanted to know more about the person who made the world stop when he passed. ;( That's the magnetism of Michael Jackson. ;),1372291200,2,326,4.637931034482759
