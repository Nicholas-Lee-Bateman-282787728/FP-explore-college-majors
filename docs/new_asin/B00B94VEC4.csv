8564417,2,B00B94VEC4,"The titles on this set of 21st-century action movies are a bit malleable, so here's how they're listed on IMDB, an Amazon company:

Black Ops (aka Deadwater), 2008 - 4.0 out of 10

The Way of War, 2009 - 3.3

Frogmen Operation Stormbringer (aka U.S. Seals: Dead or Alive), 2002 - 3.4

Special Forces, 2003 - 4.8

I like the horror/military mash-up of Black Ops, and I tend to like Cuba Gooding, Jr., but otherwise it's hard for me to find a whole lot to like in this set.",1477008000,,471,4.247191011235955
