1403660,5,B000057S3C,"A taut, terrically filmed duel of wits between a little boy and two hired killers who kidnapped him.  The film contains strong performances and gripping camerawork and editing.  An underseen 80's classic that was completely ripped off by Elmore Leonard in his novel ""KILLSHOT.""  A must see for Roy Schiedler's icy turn as a hired killer with a samurai streak of honor and Baldwin's frightening psychopathic partner.  A reliably crack job of directing from Eric Red, of ""THE HITCHER,"" ""NEAR DARK"" and ""BODY PARTS.""",1064707200,6,513,5.071428571428571

1403662,1,B000057S3C,"The best thing about writer director Eric Red's action film is Roy Scheider as one of the two kidnappers, hired to bring 9 year old gangland murder witness Harley Cross to Texas from the Oklahoma house in the open planes where he is laughably under FBI protection. Scheider's underplayed contempt for fellow kidnapper Adam Baldwin provides some amusement in this otherwise routine narrative. Baldwin's cartoon psychopath favours a huge gun which seems to be an expression of the greatness of his need for revenge. There is the suggestion that this gum-chewing adolescent-minded neurotic who has arias of blather is the product of abuse, in the way he reacts to Scheider's condemnation at one point like a wounded puppy, though this hardly makes him likeable, and Baldwin doesn't help by snarling. That the boy's allegiance should go towards Scheider may provoke an act of kindness, but we're fully aware that Cross is choosing the lesser of two fates. I like how Red presents Cross as not just an innocent, sparing us the details of the child's abduction, and having him using psychological games to pit the kidnappers against each other. Red's writing also features some gaping holes of credibility, where the boy's car door is left unlocked, when the first sign of trouble at the Oklahoma farm is the telephone being out but then Scheider uses it later to ring the gangland headquarters, having Scheider and Baldwin address each other as Mr Cohen and Mr Tate so that the boy can know their names (the comic effect wears thin very quickly), and Scheider not seeming to mind when Cross initially escapes from the kidnapper's car by striking Scheider in the back of the head. However on the plus side is one bloodbath mercifully avoided, and the climactic double pursuit, where a drilling site location with heavy machinery gets a payoff.",998438400,2,1837,4.948220064724919
1403693,5,B000057S3C,"Love the movie when I first watched it on tape, very different to most shows with a bit off flair to it. The story is very interesting and makes you listen as to what is going on. Some twist and turns with the hit men making a run after they shoot the witness and the guards not having a chance. Taking a hostage who causes more pain than they expected. Now its not boring as it has a bit off a pace but not too fast as to spoil a fantastic show. I rated this an A grade plus for a classic with plenty of suspense attached with the excitement that goes with it, and that keeps you glued to your chair not wanting to miss anything, so what are you waiting for, get to it and collect the popcorn, put your feet up for an great night for entertainment and enjoy.",1374019200,,759,4.0
1403694,5,B000057S3C,"This is one cool thriller that takes place in the course of one night, Roy Scheider & Adam Baldwin are two hitman who are to bring back a kid who may have witnessed somthing he shouldn't have, it is clear from the start that the two men don't like each other & the kid plays on this to his advantage in the hopes of escaping, Baldwin is the younger of the two & is a hothead with a short temper, Scheider is a veteran who is all business & knows that being careful is better than being over the top, this puts the men at odds with each other, what makes this one fun to watch is seeing the kid play the two men against each other, there isn't much I can say without giving away a few surprises, but this is one neat road thriller that got very little attention when released in 1989, it was defiantely shot on a real road & is a cool suspense thrllier with a satisfying ending, if you like road thrills, this is one to get.",1362700800,3,923,4.049180327868853

1403697,2,B000057S3C,"Roy Scheider is more than competent in this thinly written, mildly exciting late 80s thriller.

1403701,4,B000057S3C,"For any fan of Adam Baldwin (Firefly fans I'm talking to you), Cohen and Tate is a thrilling romp that follows two mob hitmen as they try to deliver a young witness to their boss.  Unfortunately for them, the kid's a conniving little snot who figures out how to play his captors against one another and does so with annoying dexterity.

Adam Baldwin gives a vicious performance as the hot-headed Tate, though a lot of his dialogue is badly dubbed over for content (despite the movie's R rating).  Roy Scheider is ice-cold as Cohen, conceivable as a veteran killer suffering from hearing loss.

The movie as a whole isn't the greatest, but it's not so much the plot that drives this movie.  The characters of Cohen and Tate, their conflicting natures and constitutions is what makes this movie worth your time.  As the tension mounts, you can sense the characters' hatred for one another.  When the movie reaches it's climax, you don't really care who gets killed but you really want someone to get it.  One day I would love to see this movie released to DVD with Baldwin's original dialogue restored.",1179100800,2,1100,4.692708333333333
1403702,4,B000057S3C,"Roy Scheider (as Cohen) and Adam Baldwin (as Tate) are bickering mob hit men who kidnap a 9-year old kid who witnessed a mob-related killing. They also kill his parents. Cohen is older and more logical, Tate is a violet hot-head who wants nothing more than to kill the little boy. Pretty much all of this film takes place over a few hours one night on the road, as the trio head back to the city. It's very tense, clever, and well-written, and delivers an unconventional, powerful ending. The kid is never annoying, only cries once, and is portrayed as calm and cunning without being ridiculously precocious. The only downfall is Adam Baldwin's amateurish, too-obvious, over-the-top performance, and that unfortunately prevents this from being a classic. Also, Baldwin spews expletives left and right, however many of them are badly dubbed over as ""sucker"" or ""freakin."" That doesn't really make sense. But, at least Baldwin constantly threats the kid, hits him, and points giant guns in his face. That's fun. I really loved this film; you can get it cheap on VHS in a cut-out bin near you.",1090454400,3,1090,4.834224598930481

*Plot and ending analyzed*

Cohen and Tate  (1988) is about two totally inept hit men, but it's not a comedy, no, it's played with dark zeal, or at least, the actors attempt that.  In fact, they aren't very good, even reliable Roy Scheider is overshadowed by the dismal overacting of Adam Baldwin.  It all wears thin and the overabundance of driving will further put you in a claustrophobic mood.  The driving scene has the same studio ""lights"" used repetitiously, also, look for the same car behind the hit men's car, with its lights on.

The ineptness of the hit men is so outstanding that I don't think anyone with a brain will believe the scenario.  Some kid routinely badgers and harasses them until they all drive each other nuts, and then we get a ridiculous ending that made it all pointless.",1468195200,,842,4.641891891891892

7933015,2,B000057S3C,"Cohen & Tate, 1989 film

This is the story about two criminals who kill the parents of a young boy and kidnap him. There is action right at the beginning. The boy will be brought back to Houston Texas (they are paid to do this). [When you think about this it seem implausible.] After the murders they drive away in the night with the young boy in the back seat. [He is not hooded or restrained.] There are dramatic events to carry the story forward. They are able to overcome two policemen at a roadblock! After this they hijack another car (as if this was a long-term solution). The pair have problems (to add comic touches to a serious drama).

There is a personality conflict between the older and wiser Cohen and the younger and emotional Tate. They drive through the dark night, having to take the back roads after the incident with the police. At a rest stop the boy warns Cohen that Tate wants to kill them both. [What about their payoff? Is it wise to mail cash in an envelope?] They drive in silence, no radio, as the boy sings about MacDonalds Farm. There is conflict over driving the car. Suddenly Tate ceases to be a problem for Cohen! Cohen can handle that. They stop for gas. Cohen makes a quick decision. Later a flat tire presents a new problem, and a big surprise! [Believable? But it adds to the drama.]

The boy drives the car, then stops. There is another surprise! [This is like a cartoon.] Next there is more bloody action! Who will walk away now? Mornings light reveals a police helicopter following them as they near Houston. There is a car crash, police cars surround them. Will Cohen surrender to face the charges? Will the young boy celebrate his tenth birthday? What ending will please the audience?

This was inspired by O. Henrys short story The Ransom of Red Chief. Was it better than the original? This is not a great movie because its story is poor. Perhaps its fault is in modifying a comic story and turning it into a crime story while being limited by this decision. Who picked an incongruous pair for the job? Creating a gang from strangers was done in The Asphalt Jungle and had a similar ending.",1445126400,,2134,4.4781491002570695
