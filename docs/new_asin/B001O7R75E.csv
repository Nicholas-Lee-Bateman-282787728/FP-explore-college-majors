So determined were our forebears to erase class distinctions of speech, that they taught schoolchildren common pronunciation intending that any child born and educated in the U.S., no matter how humbly born, could be elected president.",1252713600,17,384,5.620689655172414

It is fun and fascinatiing  You will be proud that you're an English speaker, especially if you are one who speaks the American version of this fabulous language.  Recommended to all, with great enthusiasm!",1252627200,11,364,4.854838709677419
3729338,5,B001O7R75E,"This is a wonderful series.  Melvyn Bragg is a total nerd who dresses atrociously, but the material is so fascinating and flows so well that appearances don't count for much.  The show runs from time to time on History International, I believe, so catch it there if you're unconvinced.  Me, I'll be ordering the DVDs.

I don't know what the hold-up has been, but will be glad to see this long-overdue DVD set.  I may wait for Blu-ray if that release looks likely.",1243296000,5,463,4.530120481927711
3729339,5,B001O7R75E,"This is a concise yet thorough presentation of the beginning and changes to the English language.  It is concise because no word spoken on the DVD set's 405 minutes is wasted. Every statement is packed with valuable and interesting information regarding changes, alterations, mutations, and eliminations to English vocabulary and phrases.  It is thorough because it begins with language prior to English, searches data from all over the world, and ends back in England with the knowledge that spoken & written English will likely be around for a long time, but ever changing.

This is an educational product, but the presentation is filled with on-location footage from around the world, making it a richly beautiful, historical, and travelogue-like documentary experience. It is captivating as it continues, minute by minute, presenting common and seldom-used vocabulary, their meanings, and origins. Many surprises, more than countable, will enlighten any viewer.

Who'd-a-thought that ""bulldozer"" originally referred to the full-measure of a whipping which a bull could take, but was administered to American slaves, often causing death?  A far cry from a piece of heavy equipment. ""Dr. Johnson"" at one point was a name given to a body part only identifiable as male. And, ""nip"" is a word yet to be included into a dictionary, or completely defined the way youth in the UK are using it.

2000 of today's common words were first used by Shakespeare and the Oxford Dictionary now holds approximately 3/4 of a million words. Shakespeare's longest word was ""honorificabilitudinitatibus"" meaning with honor. William Tyndale's 1526 Bible translation from the original Hebrew and Greek provided readership for English reading common worshipers. The American Revolution and aftermath included America taking charge of preserving English perfection and then elaborating and ""vocabularizing"" it into the vernacular.

Other countries added their own local colour of pronunciation and spelling to their English.  Wars added more changes. Industry and trade influence yet additional. Even art and culture plays a part in the continuing change to the growing world use of the English language.

This DVD set's 8 fifty-minute episodes provide a delightful romp through peoples, places, history, time, books, rulers, and every and all aspect that can make an alteration to a word or phrase. What a FUN learning experience. Quite usable in classrooms, on research shelves of libraries, or home for the pleasure of expanding one's own mind.

My wife and I both rate this DVD set 5-stars. So that equals a Perfect-10. After viewing ""The Adventure of English"", boldness allows me to coin a pair of new descriptive words: tenstremendous bo-derek-ous. Many people around the world, common and genius, have initiated new English words since this language's beginning.

One phrase pulled from among hundreds, thanks to the provided closed captioning, was: ""vicious abundance of phrase and volubility of tongue"" which summarizes this 8-part production.

Entertaining beyond expectation.
Educational beyond comparison.

3729340,5,B001O7R75E,"This is a great series, and I highly recommend it ... but the price is ludicrous! US$80 SRP? When this was released in New Zealand, it was admittedly two discs (same content), but it was NZ$28 - about US$15 SRP.",1238716800,6,211,4.3
3729341,5,B001O7R75E,"Of course it is. But that does not subtract from this most excellent series. No matter how much you know about history about history you can learn something new looking at it from a different dimension.

The only caution is they make a few mistakes here and there which undermines the information your faith in what you do not know. However I'll take my chances. The only other complaint is I could have stood more subtitles.

I knew a lot of German was in English. Yet I was surprised how much of it is French. The advantage of DVD over the book is we get to see what all the buildings looked like inside and out.

I do not want to go too much into detail as I think you will be amazed and enthralled with the new insights.

But my love of history, English literature, and just plain curiosity induced me to watch it. And I am so glad I did! It was very well done, with lots of scenes done on-site around the world. As it follows the history of the language, I also learned quite a bit about English history itself. In fact, I learned so much just from watching the series, that I was inclined to purchase the Kindle book. I would highly recommend either the video or book to anyone interested in English history, English literature, or just the history of language itself. 5 stars!",1359244800,,707,4.488372093023256

3729363,5,B001O7R75E,"I first saw The Adventure of English on television some years ago and recalled that I had enjoyed it enormously, to the point where I recently purchased both the four dvd set and the book. That was perhaps a little self-indulgent as both media cover much the same material but I found it helpful to reinforce what I had seen in the video by reading supplementary material on the printed page. In any event, it lived up to my expectations and confirmed my fond recollections. Bragg is a very skilled presenter---his research is solid without becoming unduly pedantic (although at times, when he is reciting lists of words integrated into English from other languages one would like to assure him that we get his point). English has indeed proved to be a great assimilator, from the classics, French, native American, and many other sources. A Brit himself, he gives full due attention to American English and to the English that has emerged in India and the Caribbean. In all, I found it to be a wonderful experience to read/watch the Adventure of English unfold. Highly recommended.",1333929600,2,1082,4.82258064516129
3729364,4,B001O7R75E,"Very educational, tracing of the roots and history of the English
language from 500 B.C. to the present.

In learning the history of the language I learned a lot about the
political. military and cultural history of England itself (for
example, I had no idea that for 300 years after William the Conqueror
took over England from his home in Normandy, French became the
'official' language of England, and came close to threatening to
eliminate English altogether. Or that it was the plague, which killed
off so many of the upscale guardians of language, like the clergy who
wanted Latin to be the language of the state, that helped restore
spoken English to prominence.

The series can get a bit dry at times, like an illustrated lecture. And
it gets a bit less interesting when it gets to more recent, more
familiar history. But it still is always enlightening and entertaining.",1331769600,2,879,4.814569536423841
3729365,4,B001O7R75E,"Topic was unusual and scope was fairly comprehensive.  The chronological approach worked well.

Wherever this tongue has been taken, or what has been brought to it, it has adapted and met any challenge it could face.  The Adventure of English is an excellent and entertaining documentary regarding the history of this amazing language and the journey that shaped it and molded it into the lexicon we recognize today.  You will be amazed and awe struck at the riveting story and history of the amazing transformation that took place, and indeed still is, in the midst of oppression, victory, defeat and rapidly changing culture.

The Adventure of English is sure to gratify anyone with an interest in history, the origin of our language, or those who just enjoy a fascinating story.  It's format is very entertaining and will keep you glued to your screen as it presents the history of English in a manner that is leaps and bounds beyond a lecture or classroom.

It gives a good overview of the history of English and in my opinion it is a must-have for teachers of the English language. I based an English lesson on the section about Old and Middle English because it offers good illustrative material, which might be interesting for students of English.

Whatever way the parents choose to deal with this potentially explosive query is their option and/or problem; but if you're curious as to where your linguistic essence came from, this DVD set holds all the information you will ever need.
  Using a very organized and easily understood approach, The Adventure of English describes how our language was born, grew and developed to become the standard in communication around the world.  Throughout its evolution of over 1,500 years, English has endured the onslaught of battles and pestilence, bringing it many times to the brink of extinction; yet, it has managed to not only survive, but truly thrive among all other languages, due to its ability to absorb rather than repel its enemies.  By offering us subtle variations in meaning, the ever-expanding English vocabulary provides us the tools to convey an extensive richness in our words, granting us the power to use the perfect word for the perfect occasion.
  I highly recommend this DVD set, The Adventure of English, to those who would like to have a better sense of and respect for our verbal and written system of communication.  By understanding where your English language came from, you can better appreciate your own history.  As the small child mentioned above grows and develops, so too will his ability to handle his language, to effectively communicate with it, and in so doing contribute to its infinite evolution.",1270598400,6,1526,5.023809523809524

3729378,5,B001O7R75E,"Fifteen hundred years ago, the Roman Empire had vacated Great Britain.

Germanic tribes stepped into the void, taking the land and subjugating the people to a new language.

But in one of those strange quirks with which history is so fond, the language of the tribes became only a part of the language their new land.  While an excellent exploration of these early days can be found in John McWhorter's recent English Our Bastard Tongue, a vibrant and exciting treatment of this same time can also be found here in this series.

In the wake of this Germanic invasion Old English had a great Renaissance of sorts culminating in an age of scholarship and artistic expression best known today for the creation of the Beowulf story.

In 1066, another invasion by William the Conqueror, put English on ice for nearly three hundred years while French became the main language of the realm.  We still see the impact of this French control in words like magistrate and arrest and other important terms still used in our legal system today.

By the 1380s the still prevalence of common English usage resulted in the creation of an English language Bible written by John Wycliffe.  Even though it was banned by the church the Bible was a popular success and did much to start the process of standardizing a common written English.

This standardization got a hand from the crown itself when James I commissioned a royal Bible...the King James Edition (which drew from the Wycliffe edition and also one by Tyndale in the fourteen hundreds).  It was also aided in no small measure by the work of William Shakespeare whose 38 plays still resonate through literary history serving as the gold standard for both great theatre and great writing.  (Indeed today, calling someone a Shakespeare speaks to their writing ability in the same way that referring to them as an Einstein refers to their intellect.)

In the wake of this early Renaissance period, English travelled around the world with both British and then later American conquests.  And where force of arms wasn't successful in drawing new English speakers, the force of Hollywood did the trick.

Today, some two billion people either speak English as a first or secondary language and the language of course remains prevalent in official correspondence between governments.  One example of this later phenomenon is the fact over half of laws written by the European Union Parliament are in English.  Another is that all officical correspondence of even OPEC is in English.

As can be seen from the foregoing material, there's a lot to the story of English and if you watch this document you will see the story unfold in breath taking, informative segments.

So, you might as well watch it.  Since you already speak English, you might as well learn where it came from.",1259539200,11,2811,4.867647058823529

Every time we speak, though most of us are unaware of it, we record the history of English. Words like husband linger from the days of Alfred the Great when the Danes came. We call calf meat veal because of the Norman conquest. Feel the history in every word we speak.
