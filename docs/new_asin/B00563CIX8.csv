8459149,5,B00563CIX8,I read the book Jesus On Every Page and was intrigued with the concept and wanted to see more.  I ordered this DVD and enjoyed the content.  You need to know though that this DVD is really meant to go with the study guide.  I'm in the process now of finding a group to start this study with.  I haven't seen the guide so I can't comment on that but this DVD makes me want to see it.,1391644800,,382,3.858974358974359
