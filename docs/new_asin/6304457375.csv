878918,5,6304457375,It was obvious back in the early 70s that DeNiro was by far one on the best actors ever in thie bad boy/ bad man image made manifest so demonstratively in his later films.

The question remains at the end...Did Charlie set Johnny Boy up by driving over to Brooklyn? Nobody in the car wanted to go over there...they had to reason to go there....Charlie just drove over the bridge. Did he know Micheal was waiting for them on the other side? Hmmmm.

It's the religion, Christianity and the Catholic Church, and its toll in the spirits and consciences of too few a gangster. And it's the violence, and the redemption, and the Shakespearean-like taste of it all. Last but not least, it's Martin Scorsese, already at his best. Starring the sublime Harvey Keitel, Mean Streets is a slice of life made into a motion picture without compromises of any kind.

There was hardly any plot whatsoever. It featured a group of wanna-be wiseguys who basicaly had no jobs and hung around this bar all the time, sometimes getting drunk and fighting amongst each other. One of these guys was played by a young Robert DeNiro who owed money to one of his friend's cousins. Although he never had enough to pay him back, DeNiro was constantly harrassed for not paying the money he owed. This was literally the only plot in the entire movie. Finally, he was gunned down while trying to leave Manhattan at the end. No idea if he survived because the movie abrubtly ends at this point. Terrible movie, no plot, poor dialogues, etc...

Harvey Keitel is brilliant as an up and comer with a conscience, de Niro is brilliant as his sociopathic friend, his ""penance"". All believable; guys hanging out, making half-assed deals, trying to be tough. A prelude to Goodfellas and Casino but better.

The rock n' roll / do woo / r & b soundtrack set a new film standard for ""mood music"". So good, so fresh. One of the best films of the 70s, the 3rd or 4th Golden Age of Cinema.",1431129600,2,661,4.593220338983051

879189,5,6304457375,"Mean Streets is a crime film that stars Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro. The plot examines the daily struggles of a wannabe hood to keep his morals straight on the streets of Little Italy. It was directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Scorsese and Mardik Martin.

Driven equally by his wish to become a respectable gangster like his uncle and his desire to live his life like St. Francis, Charlie takes on his energetically unhinged friend Johnny Boy as his own personal penance, intervening to get Johnny Boy to pay off a debt to the local loan shark Michael. Despite his promises to his epileptic girlfriend Teresa that they will move out of Little Italy once he strengthens his position in his uncle's world, Charlie's involvement with Johnny Boy further ensnares him in the neighborhood. When Johnny Boy decides to mouth off to Michael rather than pay him, Charlie, Johnny Boy, and Teresa try to flee Michael's murderous anger, forcing Charlie to realize that the rules of the streets do not mesh with absolution.

In countless ways, right down to the detail of modern TV crime shows, Mean Streets is one of the source points of modern movies. It features an attention-grabbing performances by Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel. Also,combining documentary-style realism; kinetic editing and camera movement; and expressionistic lighting, angles, and film speed, Scorsese presents an intimate picture of the trivial incidents and latent violence of Charlie's and Johnny Boy's world, ritualistically unfolding their experiences rather than simply explaining what motivates them. Overall,it is a powerful tale of urban sin and guilt that marks Scorsese's arrival as an important cinematic voice particularly in gangster films.",1419638400,,1731,5.200716845878136

879250,5,6304457375,"Although he had completed a few pictures prior to this, Mean Streets really serves as Martin Scorcese's introduction to U.S. film. And it is an extraordinary movie. The acting of Robert de Niro and Harvey Keitel in particular is amazing. These are the streets Scorcese grew up on, and his familiarity encourages a confidence with the camera and with the soundtrack--which is amazing. Mean Streets grapples with profound issues such as loyalty, friendship, and ambition. With a great script it introduces viewers to a group of young men in an Italian-American community, and we get to know these friends and enemies in all of their idiosyncratic truth. There is an energy of urgency on screen, young men on the make, and Mean Streets captures both the essentials and nuances. Also: how important respect is and what happens when one young man feels he has lost it.",1415059200,,863,4.917808219178082

Takes it's inspiration from noir, gangster pics, while injecting a strong dose of reality about personal relationships between long-time friends. De Niro's portrayal of the alienated and self-destructive Johnny Boy is mesmerizing and joyously over-the-top; the rest of the cast seems to revolve around him, but all do their jobs more than competently.
As always, Scorsese's use of source music rather than scoring is arresting and revelatory.

879404,5,6304457375,"It's hard to believe that ""Mean Streets"" is 40 years old and I'm seeing it for the first time. It still packs a punch, mainly because of the acting of Harvey Keitel, Robert de Niro, and an excellent cast -- then there's the fast pacing, the distinctive camera work, the gritty dialogue. The Mob here is altogether on a lower-socio-economic level than was to be the case with ""The Godfather"" a few years later. Here, we're in the world of small clubs, small-time gambling, and relatively small time loan-sharking. There's not much glamor. But it's the world in which Charlie (Keitel) and Johnny Boy (De Niro) have grown up and it's the one that provided them with their images of masculine behavior. Keitel looks up to, and seems to want to emulate, his uncle Giovanni, a ruthless, elegant minor don (played with chilling sang-froid by Cesare Danova), who is all too ready to throw members of his family under the bus if they disturb the efficiency of his organization. Thus he warns Charlie to stay away from Johnny Boy and his cousin Teresa, because Johnny Boy is borderline psychotic and Teresa has epilepsy -- to Giovanni, both are simply ""not right in the head."". But Johnny Boy is an old friend with huge (for him) gambling debts, and Charlie loves Teresa, and he can't help looking out for them and trying to help them. This impulse to help is a result of Charlie's Catholic beliefs -- he is a person with a sense that his life should have a spiritual meaning, and the idea of hell is one he takes seriously. The film suggests, with all the fires and explosions that we see, that he doesn't realize that he pretty much is in hell already -- but he keeps trying, at great cost to Teresa and himself.

What the movie also catches, thanks to its male leads, is the sense that Charlie and Johnny Boy are still barely out of adolescence -- they can go from affection to roughhousing to serious violence and back very quickly, and with Teresa Charlie goes from affection that he can hardly express to insult in just seconds. These boys want to be men but don't know how -- is it guns or sex or self-control? Charlie is still figuring it out as he strives to please everybody, God included, with the result that hardly any of his good deeds go unpunished.

Grounding the movie are the scenes on the mean streets themselves -- the shabbiness, the noise, the casual profanity and racism, the ever-readiness to violence, the cops who are casually bought off. Work is either with the mob or gambling, it seems, and the sense of life being something of a game of chance is very strong, Charlie's religious instincts notwithstanding. What Charlie doesn't realize is that he's temperamentally at odds with the very world that he looks to to affirm his worth as a man. That makes him close to a tragic figure in this engrossing movie that set Scorsese, Keitel, and De Niro all on their ways to become film icons.",1392336000,,2903,4.5807692307692305

879410,5,6304457375,"Martin Scorsese's early film ""Mean Streets"" (1973) tells a story of religious redemption and of loyalty set in the criminal world of New York City's Lower East Side in the 1960s. The movie featured brilliant acting debuts by its two main characters, Robert DeNiro (Johnny Boy) and Harvey Keitel (Charlie), both of whom played leading roles in later Scorsese films.

The movie has a thin plot, or  tangle of thin plots. Charlie is a young, rising petty criminal in the Mafia who has strong Catholic convictions together with guilt about his apparent path in life. He is a faithful friend of another young man, Johnny Boy, headstrong, selfish, impulsive, and half-crazy.  Johnny Boy is deeply in debt to another rising and menacing young criminal, Michael (Richard Romanus).  At great risk to himself, Charlie tries to help out Johnny Boy.  Charlie is also involved with a young epileptic woman, Teresa, (Amy Robinson) related to Johnny Boy.  Charlie's boss,  his uncle and a higher figure in the criminal ranks, Giovanni, (Cesare Danova) warns his young protege to steer clear of both Johnny Boy and Teresa.  The film builds to a violent ephiphany of a conclusion which reminded me of the ending of Henry Roth's novel, ""Call it Sleep"".

The film is difficult to follow for viewers with the expectation of a linear, straightforward story. The movie rewards more than one viewing, as I took the opportunity to do through Amazon's rental program. With careful viewing, the film has a powerful, cumulative impact.

""Mean Streets"" is set in the bars, restaurants, go-go clubs, apartments, and, in particular, the streets of Little Italy. Most of the action takes place at night. The movie is improvisatory and episodic. It consists of a number of small, carefully developed vignettes which at first may seem unconnected to one another.  The different themes develop slowly and indirectly. The religious themes are suggested throughout as the movie explores Charlie's tormented character. Each individual scene has a great deal of tension and atmosphere, as the characters alternate between cameraderie and barely suppressed violence in the unforgiving world of Little Italy. The cinematography and lighting add immeasurably in defining the action and were unusual for their time. The movie includes an insightfully appropriate musical score consisting largely of doo-wop songs from girl groups of the early 1960's.

The film offers a rough, raw picture of streets and of crime, combined with a hovering feeling of religious grace. Scorsese explored these themes in many subsequent movies.  ""Mean Streets"" stands on its own without needing comparison to his latter efforts.  ""Mean Streets"" is a tough, suggestive film for viewers with a passion for exploring the meaning of American urban life.

879411,5,6304457375,"""Mean Streets""  has been overshadowed with all the praise heaped on other Martin Scorcese/Robert De Niro films, but this is a classic which is as good as Casino or Goodfellas. It's more rough around the edges and less tightly plotted than those films, but less cold hearted, and De Niro and Keitel are amazing in these early roles. The sense of tension and danger towards the end, when the situation is spinning out of control, is done perfectly.

879489,4,6304457375,"Some think this Scorsese's first directorial effort, but it's actually his 3rd full-length film. The first was a student's work that took years to complete with zero budget. Definitely early Scorsese style but it's so roughly done with numerous flaws that it shows. His second was an exploitation B-movie for Roger Corman. Mean Streets was the first feature film of his own with a production budget, albeit relatively small. Compared to his work that immediately followed (Taxi Driver and Raging Bull), it has some rougher edges, but those do not diminish the power of its story much. Found it tumultuous giving me a claustrophobic feeling at times. I couldn't escape the reckless Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro) with his disregard for himself and everyone around him slowly devolving into a complete wreck that takes Charlie (Harvey Keitel) and his epileptic cousin Teresa (Amy Robinson) with him. It helps if one understands, or at least has some appreciation for, the culture of New York's ""Little Italy"" and the East Coast pre-Vatican II Italian-American Catholicism of that era. The story is about Charlie trying to find an elusive balance between his guilt-driven Catholicism that requires Good Works and not just penance with his uncle's expectations and demands (a minor mafia figure he works for collecting debts and who is trying to set him up with owning/operating a major restaurant). If the film seems chaotic, it's because Charlie's life is already and it only increases as the film progressive. The narrative story comments Charlie inserts occasionally are important to understanding his internal conflicts and the film. Charlie's a ""nice guy"" who cares about those around him, but the streets where he lives are unforgiving and mean. Mean Streets is an extension of Scorsese's first film as a student and draws heavily on his experiences growing up and living in NYC's Little Italy. Robert De Niro is superb in his role as Johnny Boy, as is Harvey Keitel in portraying Charlie. De Niro eventually appears in eight of Scorsese's films, Keitel in five, and Scorsese becomes a prolific director. Picture quality is true to the cinematography technology and film used.

Blu-ray transfer is quite good. Audio quality is very clean with excellent fidelity considering the state of modest budget monaural cinema audio in the mid-1970's.

Giving the film 4 stars as his next film with similar gritty urban content - Taxi Driver - shows more refinement and polish in the story and his film making style.",1379203200,3,2506,5.080097087378641

879730,2,6304457375,"Mean Streets is my favourite film.  I've seen it over 30 times in all kinds of various incarnations - VHS, DVD, repertory cinema.  It's a movie of urban cacophony - car horns, sirens, vintage rock and opera compete with gritty photography of `70s New York to create a thrilling and chaotic way of life.  The best quality that I've ever seen of it was when I saw a specially restored print for its 30th anniversary several years ago.  Wow - every frame was a mesmerising testimony as to what cinema is capable of.  A truly sensual and moving experience,  for sure.

Does the Mean Streets that appears on this blu ray transfer capture the magic of this great movie?  No, not in the slightest.  It is a VERY poor transfer, in my opinion.  The grit and the sensuality of this great film has been severely compromised.  The crimson-drenched barroom scenes look pale and anemic, the gritty street scenes look dull and ordinary.  The colors lack the boldness and vigour that I've seen so many times in the cinema, even in the poorest of prints.  I'm no expert on video transfer but it seems to me that an excessive amount of DNR has been used.  The faces lack detail, the film grain non-evident.  It just doesn't look like film at all and in fact it baffles me why anyone would want to invent a technology like blu ray and then waste it with a subpar transfer like this.  It looks more like bad DVD to me.  Watching this as a long-time admirer gave me no pleasure at all.  Newcomers will be baffled as to why this has been heralded as a legendary film if they use this version as the standard.

I would advise against buying this and to exercise caution with future blu ray purchases.  Just because the technology is capable of great things doesn't necessarily mean it will reach those lofty heights.  So don't go out and put the old DVDs on internet auction sites just yet. Better still, don't ignore your local repertory cinema either - currently the only way to see this movie with its power intact.",1350691200,12,1995,4.486111111111111

879732,1,6304457375,"After (re-seeing) Taxi Driver recently, I was eager to see Mean Streets on satellite.

After 25 minutes, I couldn't stand it anymore, and deleted it.

This movie is drivel, about a group of worthless losers who somehow think that their pathetic lives are important to anyone but themselves.

Yes, there are some stylistic similarities to Taxi Driver (along with some of the same actors, of course), but the result is dramatically different.

I am guessing that a good bit of the dialogue in this movie was improvised, but in order for that to be a success, it would need to have some reasonable framework to hang on.

This movie is tedious, a total waste of time.

879734,4,6304457375,"The acting in the film is terrific. Keitel and De Niro are standouts, and their verbal interplay takes on almost Abbott And Costello-like humor. Robinson, Romanus, Proval and Danova are also quite good. Romanus really nails the wannabe who's not as tough nor smart as he thinks he is- just look at the scene where he stoops to rippi goff two suburban burnouts out of $20 for fireworks. The film evinces a cinema verit aesthetic, so the cinematography by Kent L. Wakefield is not as important as the superlative editing by Sidney Levin. But, the most important aspect of the film was how it brought already popular music into modern filmmaking, and wove it in seamlessly, as if it had been composed specifically for the film. Scorsese's always been one of the best directors in the world at effectively deploying music. But, it's the overall style that Scorsese created that is important, because, whereas poseurs like Jean-Luc Godard merely aped Hollywood noir, and tried to use their low budgets to claim novelty, Scorsese really does do something without precedent- in noir, in John Cassavetes films, or in gangster films. He creates a stylized realism that was absent in noir, affected in Godard, formative in early Cassavetes, and unreal in gangster films. Only Cassavetes' later The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie and Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai, are as effective in realistically portraying most mobsters; as often inept bumblers whose idiocy, even more than their ethical corruption, leads to their downfall.

  There are, of course, aside from the classic scenes mentioned, some interesting cameos; such as Jeannie Bell, as Diane, the black stripper Charlie lusts for. Her prior claim to fame was as the second Playboy magazine centerfold Playmate, and the first black cover model. Then there is the bizarre scene with the Carradine brothers, wherein Robert shoots and kills a drunken David in Tony's bar. It's funny, but pointless, except that it's the sort of pointless violence that happens in that sort of world. There's also a classic scene, after the killing, where Michael, Charlie, and Johnny Boy end up in a car with two queers that flame. It's a hilarious sequence. There is also a possible cameo by Scorsese as Michael's shooter, in the car, in the final scenes. Scorsese did this in some of his early films, but never followed in Alfred Hitchcock's tradition.

  Mean Streets is not as polished a film as Scorsese's later great films, like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The King Of Comedy, After Hours, nor Goodfellas, but it is every bit as good, in its raw sensibilities. One only hopes that, now that he got his `Honorary' Oscar for the merely solid The Departed, Marty from the nabe will return to his roots, and make some films where he cannot have every whim of his indulged. It worked once. It can work again. If not, then American cinema lovers will be left with a tarnished legacy for one of its most original and brilliant filmmakers. Mean Streets is proof of that claim. Here's hoping Scorsese can finally find his way home.",1339027200,,3069,4.880998080614203

Mean Streets is a great slice of Little Italy in the 70s--and anything 1970s New York is very interesting to me as a city planner. The film is also Scorcese's work that resonates most with me. Everything is in the context of the neighborhood and is seen through the eyes of youth. There is a wonderful innocence about that. The whole district is a character, and with far more nuance than the set of mob-centric films. I love the scene where the kids from Riverdale (Bronx, but suburban Bronx) are looking to buy fireworks and whatever else. They are tourists who don't get the neighborhood. Through this and many other contrasts, the film makes me feel like a local. Thank you, Mr. Scorcese. Oh yes--and through Harvey Keitel's main character (love his performance) we get a near autobiography of an essential director. This is also our first view of the magnificent Scorcese/De Niro partnership. Not too bloody, perhaps more racy than it needs to be. On the whole, wonderful stuff.",1334016000,2,1099,4.670103092783505

Tapes are stored in durable oversized plastic clamshells, and are full screen dubbed at SP speed. Some, such as MEAN STREETS or LOST IN AMERICA, have a HiFi audio track. Far superior in audio clarity to pre-1985 linear-only tapes, the stereo sound and dynamic range of HiFi can only be heard on a compatible VCR patched to a good amplifier or receiver that's connected to efficient speakers, a set up (in VHS or DVD) that over the years has acquired the name: ""home theater.""

Borrowed money from Francis Coppola helped writer/director Martin Scorsese complete MEAN STREETS. Filmed in part on location in NYC's Little Italy, Scorsese shot some scenes in the places he knew as a boy: a buddy's apartment house hallway, the graveyard of old St. Patrick's Cathedral, etc. In only his third motion picture, one that at first glance seems plotless, Scorsese demonstrates a cinematic mastery far beyond his actual experience, also a prodigious talent for capturing real life.

Here, for reasons only he understands, Charlie (Keitel) remains pals with Johnny Boy (De Niro), even though crazy Johnny is fiscally irresponsible to the point where his well-being in endangered by the gangsters he owes ""two-large"" to. Charlie has also become romantically involved with Johnny's cousin Teresa (Robinson). Her epilepsy is a major concern to Charlie's uncle Giovanni (Danova), a caporegime that Charlie collects debts for.

Charlie's devotion to the Catholic church conflicts with his desire to advance in the Mob, and having Uncle Giovanni angry toward him for his friendship with both Johnny and Teresa isn't helping matters. Patterning himself after St. Francis, Charlie's mission is to ""save"" Johnny while continuing to see Teresa on the QT, so when Johnny insults and pulls a pistol on the loanshark he's been stringing along for weeks, Charlie unwisely chooses to flee the neighborhood with a now marked man. Teresa insists on coming along. The three head for Brooklyn in a borrowed car, unaware that the out-for-revenge thug is tailing them...

Harvey Keitel steals the movie but De Niro is incredible as well as they and their fellow thugs vie for most powerful hoodlum.  There's a melting pot of nationalities and racism churning in the background.  There's old school Italian/American music that almost feels more aggressive than the infant classic rock and Motown ballads that move the energy of the film along.  Emotions are all over the place.  One moment bonhomie reigns the next fists are flying and guns are out; cars are crashing, tires squealing.  In the midst of it all Scorsese plops his own mom.

It's not the violence that fascinates me, but the characters and their motives & personalities. So it's no surprise that I fell in love with Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets. It's quickly becoming one of my all-time favorite films. Made in 1973, this is a classic independent film that's full of violence, rage, love, friendship, and criminal business. The violence isn't very disturbing when compared to Goodfellas & Casino, but it's still well-done and it's still relevant to the plot. The characters are all interesting, even the minor ones. The shots of New York City are riveting and lovely to look at. But, of course, the best thing about this film is Robert De Niro as Johnny Boy. Even though everyone else gives brilliant performances (especially Harvey Keitel as Charlie), a majority of moviegoers seem to always remember De Niro the most in Mean Streets, and there's a very good reason. He really embodies the character of Johnny Boy, he's got the right looks, the right amount of rage, and the right amount of black humor. This really is his breakout role, and it's a wonder why he didn't receive an oscar (but it's great that he won for The Godfather Part II). I'd say that Mean Streets overall is one of Martin Scorsese's more compelling films, and it's rightfully a classic in the independent genre.

879913,4,6304457375,"Martin Scorcese's film is a slice of life drama about small-time hoods in New York's Little Italy.  Charlie (Harvey Keitel) collects debts for his uncle and waits for his opportunity to take ownership of a rinky-dink little restaurant.  He is conflicted and guilt-ridden over the immoral lifestyle he must lead and the small-minded prejudices he must endure in order to maintain such a life of mediocrity.  He is pressured to turn his back on a woman he cares about (Amy Robinson) because she has epilepsy (which makes her ""crazy"" in the eyes of his family), and he feels a responsibility to protect his childhood friend Johnny Boy (Robert DeNiro), an erratic hoodlum who has doom written all over him.  Charlie's care of Johnny Boy is like a penance he must pay.

Scorcese, Keitel, and DeNiro at the start of their careers show the greatness they would maintain for decades.  This film has a gritty, documentary feel that really communicates the way these people live.  Although the world it presents is not one I would want to live in, Scorcese (who did grow up in it) presents it with clear eyes and a sympathetic mind.",1261180800,,1122,4.752577319587629
879914,3,6304457375,"Mean Streets (1973) is an ambitious project, for which a lot of
filming talent, energy and acting talent was expended. To a certain
degree, it comes up short in architectural aspects (the story) and
is somewhat unfocused in terms of what it's about.

There's several story lines running concurrently: a story about the
mob (revolving around Harvey Keitel's character and his uncle, with
a night club, loan sharking, a collector of illegal debts), a story
of a total fool, (a character played by  De Niro), and also that of
a nostalgic recounting of young men exploring the limits of night
entertainment, bearing in mind cultural, social and  religious
limitations. Brawls, drinking, profanity, confrontations occur.

The entertainment value as well as the time expended (2 hours) is
questionable, in terms of exposing a compulsive gambler, who is
irrational, heavily indebted, and wreckless, defined as a mook.

Further, over 2/3 of the soundtrack is with the Supremes, from the
Beatlemania era, thereby  dating the move. The music works and
helps enhance it's American-ism and counter its ethnocentrism.

Conversely, the mixture of reminescing about one's youth, pals,
nightclubs, and antics in between a backdrop of the mob and
nightlife is valid for many.

The film is deep with Italian American aspects, such as the San
Gennaro parade in Manhattan in the 2nd week of September,
neighborhood clubs, restaurants, pool halls and venues that the
locals cherish, characterizing individuals who don't adhere to the
straight-and-narrow. It  shows some controversial moments  as the
ethnic Italians judge, and filter anything and everything that is
not from their close-knit neighbood, such as people and business
relations, with their own value system.

The presentation is wide-screen, with subtitles, with a very good
filming quality, considering the numerous night and indoors scenes.

The film suggests a habit of the street being the rightplace to
acquire cheap commodities, either smuggled  or obtained through
some other means, such as tobacco, narco substances, etc.

Loan sharking, the misery of debtors and the actions of the
collectors of illegal debts, culminating in shootings,  is laid out
in plain view. Keitel's character, and others, are well aware of
social etiquette, and their own religious values when face-to-face
with fellow human beings, which is a challenging paradox to resolve
in face of violence and daily stuggles.

At no time does the budget or lack thereof, become noticeable over
duration of the work.",1252281600,2,2530,5.335012594458438

It is not that old but the action is set in quite an older period, yet Robert de Niro looks like a young actor just out of drama school trying to imitate his mentor Robert de Niro himself, an older version of himself in a way. The film has little depth actually. We all know you must not play with the law of the street that the bad boys of the underworld are imposing onto those who are dumb enough not to be blind and what's more who want to have their share of the cake they have not contributed to kneading, baking and glazing. The real point is that a few thousand dollars become a monumental debt when the borrower becomes dumb enough to pretend in the lender's face and in front of quite a few witnesses he will never pay back because the lender is a dumb idiot. The end is signed in that declaration. Death. And death again and again on two innocent acolytes. The film has essentially one interest: the young de Niro and how he is already building his artistic texture, a texture he will never lose nor change. I guess good whisky gets better by aging, provided of course it ages in the proper vessel, vat or barrel.

879918,5,6304457375,"Orson Welles said that a director's first film was always his best because he would put more into it and hadn't got into bad habits like developing a style yet. Mean Streets may not be Scorsese's first film, but it otherwise bears out Welles' words. Set in New York's Little Italy, Harvey Keitel plays Michael, who exists on the fringes of crime and whose dreams of managing a restaurant his money-lending uncle is about to take over are threatened by his affair with his epileptic cousin (Amy Robinson) and his terminally unreliable childhood friend Johnny Boy's pressing debts.

As with Goodfellas, it is plot-lite and style heavy, but where in the latter the style dominated, here it has a rough-cut and ready-dubbed feel that energises the film and accurately reflects the precarious state of the characters, be it financial, mental or moral. All the trademarks are here - the tracking shots down bars, the sudden explosions of violence, a popular music soundtrack that exists as much within the film as over it, the concern with incompatibility of religion with everyday life - but here they are fresh and integral to the film rather than carefully stage-managed.

If De Niro's unstable Johnny Boy now looks a bit too much like barnstorming with many of the tricks he has since pretty much worn out through over-use, Keitel's diplomatic lead and the astonishingly natural performances from the supporting cast are the real glue that holds the film together and convince us we are eavesdropping on real lives.

Filled with astonishing moments Mean Streets remains one of the few key American films of the early Seventies that still grabs your undivided attention with none of its original power diluted by time and imitation.",1209340800,,1729,4.975778546712803
879919,5,6304457375,"Goodfellas must be seen by all film students and half the rest of the population, though the violence and MTV-effect soundtrack can be off-putting and create a strange curiosity outside the framework for viewers. Is that curiosity an indicator that we all have that ""dark side"" - some of us contain it, some don't; some won't.
This 1973 movie, with its' modest production values, has some scenes so penetrating, so memorable, that the viewer must rewind constantly to convince him or herself somethimg so ""real"" was communicated: bar-owner/neighborhood philosopher played by David Proval is so powerful one wonders if Scorsese use a hidden camera in a real place in ""Little Italy"" of the early '70s. He explodes with anger at hopelessly in debt Johnny Boy (DeNiro) when he suggests yet another card game before everyone goes home; Proval's apology is in the best movie tradition - the low-lighting and ambience off the presumptive boom microphone make us think for a moment, that there's something happening beyond the guns, drugs, and thievery.
Harvey Keitel is Charlie, another character suppressing his humanitarian side, nephew of the neighborhood ""Boss"" played by Cesare Danova; he splits his time between loving Teresa, Johnny Boy's beautiful cousin, who has a physical problem which is not helped by the constantly distracted, negligent men she socializes with; mentoring Johnny himself (it seems that JB sustained a concussion while defending Charlie in a riot and so Charlie cannot avoid this non-monetary debt); and being *mentored* by Gionvanni (CD) - who has instructed him that he must not associate with the two.
He has a religious/spiritual side which is conveyed very convincingly: at first the viewer wonders if he's really delusional, as a man who follows St. Assisi *and* Giovanni at the same time. On that proverbial 1970s walk on the beach scene he says to Teresa that he does not run numbers. His ""heart"" is revealed in his emotional statement. The love scenes with Keitel and Robinson are perfectly realized through sensitive framing and editing.
There are a number actors here also seen over 30 years later in ""The Sopranos"". It's great fun to notice them in one dramatic incarnation and refer back to the other.
Scorsese's ""open mike"" approach - picking up atmosphere, a staircase echo, a car horn, children playing, etc., is interesting, and possibly new to the medium. ""Michael"", now frantic as he realizes he's been made ""sucker"" by Johnny Boy once again, pursues Teresa in hopes of getting a lead as to her wild cousin's wherabouts, and finds her in the hallway of her apartment house. The cold desolation of the scene, as he helps her retrieve groceries which dropped out of the paper bag when he grabs her arm, bespeaks menace and romance at the same time.
The hard, cold mean streets cannot permit civilization among these directionless, ultimately well-meaning individuals.

The thing that strikes me most about this film, the thing that really stands out to me is the way it was filmed.  Scorsese does an awesome job of letting the audience make up their own judgments against each of the characters.  He doesn't push you to either like or dislike any of the characters.  The story follows a group of friends through the streets of New York and lets you observe how they come together and drift apart throughout the film.  The way the movie was filmed is simply brilliant.  It doesn't hurt that the story is also very good.  De Niro and Keitel, come on, that in itself is priceless.  This, in my opinion, is one of the best all time films.",1202860800,,758,4.319148936170213
879993,5,6304457375,"Martin Scorsese's enthralling look at mob life during the twilight of the hippie era is nothing short of brilliant.  I'm no Scorsese expert...but in my humble opinion, this is really where it all started.  What's  great about ""Mean Streets"" is, you see pieces of it in all of his other classic films like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas.  Close-ups, slow-motion pans and the use of original artist recordings throughout the entire film (something that wasn't practiced a whole lot during early 70's cinema).  The only flaw I can think of concerning Mean Streets is that Frank Vincent and Joe Pesci weren't on hand to beat each other up.

Scorsese regulars Harvey Keitel and Robert DeNiro give you an unflinching look at the social aspect of Mafia lifestyle.  Cohorts Harry (Paul Schrader's Blue Collar) Northup and Victor (King Of New York and Bad Lieutenant) Argo lend the film a lot of nostalgic appeal.  But it's  David Proval (of ""Sopranos"" fame)  that gives a standout performance as bar owner and lion tamer.  David (Kung Fu) Carradine makes a cameo as the tavern drunk. Mean Streets is not to be missed, gangsters being gangsters hanging out in bars acting tough.  Just before polyester suits, platform shoes and ""Studio 54""...this is the original ""Bada Bing!"".

This is a great film from a great director with great acting as fresh and enjoyable the first as the fifth viewing.

This is a slice of life film.  Day to day living, conflicts, problems and opportunities make up the story.  That the main characters are on a crash course is apparent to us but they are looking for a way thru a messy life.

You do it in the street. You do it at home. The rest is bullsh** and you know it."" So begins a ride that takes us in to the tortured soul of a small-time mob soldier,riddled with Catholic guilt and misguided stabs at redemption in an age decades before Oprah-speak and self-help sent the Tony Soprano's of the world toward therapists and psychotropics.

Charlie has several problems. He collects debts for his higher level uncle who dissapproves of his relationships with epiliptic girlfriend Theresa and her immature, impulsive and indebted cousin Johnny Boy (a very young Robert DeNiro).Charlie tries to renconcile his double-sided life: moving forward in the biz with his Mafioso uncle while romancing the off-limit Theresa and trying to set constant screw-up Johnny Boy on a straighter (but not totally straight) path. While Theresa is a breath of sanity and stability, Johnny Boy is a source of constant tension and frustration, especially when crossing Charlies associate Michael (Richard Romanus.)

BE WARNED- This is not a gangster film in the vein of ""Scarface"", ""Casino"" or even ""Goodfellas"". This is a morality play which revolves around small-timers and small-change. There are no kingpins or ""crimes of the century"" with this crew, just petty hustles, senseless knuckling of adversaries and dreams that involve thousands instead of millions.

Some of the edits and transistions may seem somewhat uneven as Martin Scorcese had limited experience when this fine film went into production. Conesuiers will appreciate many aspects of ""Mean Streets""- the subtleness of the losers presented,the radiance of emotion- when Richard Romanus' Michael seethes silently in a bar scene, he projects more feeling in several seconds than many actors do in their entire careers. Dialogue, which I believed was largely improvised in Johnny Boy and Charlie's bar room interactions, is so raw and natural, you may smell cigarette smoke and booze when it is over with.
In a scene where Charlie observes a loud party of his Puerto Rican neighbors, Keitels skill is used brilliantly and all but the blind can read deep into the thoughts of troubled but integral man fighting a losing war.
The soundtrack is a well chosen mix of 50's and 60's oldies(which were still popular radio staples circa 1973) the Rolling Stones, Cream and yes opera.(Just a note, Creams ""Steppin' Out"" appears in the film but is erroneously credited as Eric Claptons ""Hideaway"")

This is Scorcese's first masterpiece and rewards repeated viewings. The film is loosely based on Scorcese's own upbringing in little Italy.

The cast are perfection. Harvey Keital and Robert DeNiro spark brilliantly off each other, helped by a fabulous script and I believe some improvisation as well. Noteably the scene in the back of the bar ""you mean last Tuesday"". The dialogue in this film is marvellous and occasionally it is intentionally funny as well.

Prior to this film Scorcese had made some interesting films but none of them had his stamp on them. Mean Streets comes straight in out of nowhere as a fully fledged masterpiece:

The use of music when Johnny enters the bar; Its done in slow motion to the Stones Jumpin' Jack Flash.

The use of colour.

The drunk scene, not very long, but perhaps the best ever done. The camera (some sort of steadycam) faces Harvey Keital and we are staggering around with him, until eventually he falls over and passes out on the floor - the camera goes with him.

The wonderful fight sequence in the pool room over being called a ""Mook""; when nobody knows what a Mook is...

""Mean Streets,"" simply put, along with ""Halloween"", is one of the greatest independent films ever made. At the very least, it pioneered what modern audiences have come to associate with the best of indie cinema, and what, by the late '90s, has become so essential to our perception of so-called ""hip"" movies that the once daring and exhilarating techniques are now mostly used as frustrating clichs. The picture itself, made in 1973, is most famous for kick-starting three major careers. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro later collaborated as a director/actor team on four more masterpieces: ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull"" ""The King of Comedy"" and ""Goodfellas."" Harvey Keitel, in the leading role, went on to play other memorable characters, like Mr. Wolf in ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"". Cast as Charlie, a small-time, young gangster in New York's Little Italy, Keitel struggles to make sense of his Catholic background and help his troubled friend (De Niro) stay out of the powerful Mafia players' way. What seems to be a familiar scenario, used as far back as the classic Bogart/Cagney vehicles, gets an unusually complex treatment from Scorsese. A conventional, linear plot structure with big speeches and witty one-liners from main characters is abandoned for a grittier, naturalistic approach. The film consists of a series of telling episodes, related only through their participants.  Some may find this somewhat lethargic plot to be uneven and without structure, but perhaps this is Scorsese's entire purpose: times like these in Little Italy were without a definitive structure and the conflicts were not spelled out for them.

""Mean Streets"" has much more in common with the works of Italian Neo-realism or French New Wave, rather than a typical gangster drama. Its unorthodox, original, yet unpretentious camera work gives the film an unprecedented vitality that young filmmakers have attempted to recreate for decades. Now commonplace shots, such as a subtitled introduction of a particular character, a fight sequence tracked through the four corners of a room in a single take, a swaying hand-held camera to create the sense of an alcohol-induced stupor, have all been popularized through this movie, a veritable Bible of dynamic cinematography. Another revolutionary aspect of ""Mean Streets"" is the virtual lack of a script. Most of the key scenes were almost fully improvised, thus sounding far more authentic than the old-style, theatrical delivery used in most American films up to that time. The actors' speech is so profanity-ridden that no screenwriter of the time could have possibly doctored anything even close. Robert De Niro's flamboyant turn as a youth on the edge of sanity is unlike anything before. In fact, the swear-fests of later crime movies (and indie classics like ""Clerks"") owe a direct debt to his extraordinary performance as Johnny Boy. One of Scorcese's most groundbreaking achievements was his incorporation of popular songs into the soundtrack. All of the included music originates elsewhere- Italian traditional recordings (Opera arias, Folk tunes) and for the most part, glorious, irresistible rock'n'roll of the early 60's (Motown, the Stones, Girl Groups, DooWop). The easily identifiable hits serve as atmospheric settings, adding an extra, personal dimension to any given scene. George Lucas' ""American Graffiti"", released in the same year, operated by the same principle, establishing a tradition that seems to expand with every coming year. As it is often the case with true independent cinema, ""Mean Streets"" was ignored at the box office, despite an underground acclaim that helped launch not only the great talents behind it, but also an entire school of filmmaking.  May have lot its luster after over thirty years, but certainly a unique film experience and one with fine performances and some insight into some magical filmmaking to come.",1155081600,3,4132,5.352850539291217

880048,4,6304457375,"I love this movie. Its unique in that it goes where no other film before that time was prepared to go. Scorsese takes an in your face approach to putting it all together and succeeds in carving a place for himself in ""the industry"" with this indie film which gives a mere glimpse of his film making genius as he takes us on a tour of real life, street life as it takes its toll on the main characters Charlie and Johnny Boy, respectively, Harvey Keitel and Bob DeNiro. Its simple, gritty, funny, dramatic, all those things in one and the soundtrack is groovy, too. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it is Scorsese's best work, but it is good, just the same. Its so wonderful because he, as did most of the cast, grew up within that environment and so they all knew how to wear their characters properly, if you will.
Many will swear this film is more realistic than The Godfather when in actuality they are both extremely realistic. One couldn't really compare the 2 because they're about entirely different things and take place at entirely different times. ""Mean Streets"" is not a portrayal of mafia life, per se, but rather the livelihood of what, frankly, are a few bored and confused street punks. Though there are glimpses of ""the life"" explored when Charlie relates to his uncle Giovanni (Cesare Danova), who is, unquestionably, a ""man of honor.""
In any event, Johnny Boy's dilemma of owing money to, Michael (Richard Romanus), a hawkish fellow and an unconscionable ""jerk off"" of a loan shark and deciding how he is going to pay him back seems to be the guts of the film. Charlie, of course, has his own questions about life, sin, in particular, and has an obsession with sticking his hand in fire. Says something about his character. In respect to that, he plays ""governor"" and ""caretaker,"" basically, over his pal Johnny Boy, who, besides owing everybody money, is beyond help. He's practically insane, or perhaps, just slightly twisted in the noodle. Some of his pleasures are derived from destroying federal property, trying to shoot the lights out on top of renowned skycrapers, imagining his cousin, played by Amy Robinson, having a seizure whilst having an orgasm, and, apparently, not paying people their money, most of all, Michael.
However, its fair to say, the last few minutes of the film everyone puts their cards on the table. After, all its the end. Johnny Boy, essentially, tells everyone to go do unpure things to themselves with carrot sticks and pickles. Charlie, surprisingly, is surprised. Michael, annoyed, says okay as he looks down the barrel of an empty pistol being pointed at him by a ""far too gone"" Johnny Boy. This all leaves Johnny Boy and Charlie at the point of no return. Michael takes his much anticipated revenge. The whole film you're left wondering when he's going to take the overwhelming log, that is Johnny Boy's incessant defiance, out of his posterior orifice. So, this time you're like, so, now he gets pissed, as you soon come to find everyone left mangled and hopping about like bunnies after an attempt to escape his impending wrath. The ending dissapoints me, still, because I'd like to know if Johnny Boy dies near a dumpster in the alleyway. I mean, it leaves you hanging and in just as much confusion as the players themselves were throughout the movie. Not to say its a bad ending, entirely. Just somewhat unusual. All in all, as I said, its a good film. A great film. I don't think I spoiled it too much. Even if, its worth a look.",1137456000,2,3493,4.6537216828478964

Some of the supporting acting was a bit shotty, yet I believe this story was told to bring the realism of the streets to the silver screen rather than to impress people with Hollywood glitz.

Martin Scorsese draws upon his experiences growing up in Little Italy for the film's material and characters.  There is a bonus featurette called ""Back on the Block"" in which Scorsese and friends speak about the inspiration and basis for the movie.

Imagine that you had a hand-held camera and simply followed a group of your friends around as they drank, cursed, fought, chased women, and caroused for several days and nights. You had no script or plot for the majority of your ""movie"", but merely relied upon your friends to talk and act naturally....even if they had nothing important to say. Throw in some guilt, atonement, nudity, gunfire, and religious symbolism....and BINGO! you have a classic....IF you are Martin Scorcese AND have friends like Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel. As for the rest of us, we would probably end up with a really lousy ""home movie"" that made no sense to anyone. To be honest, I feel that some of THIS movie makes no sense to most people, but it is generally riveting and has moments of grit, humor, human frailty, and soul-piercing reality that you just don't often see in ANY movie, let alone one made 32 years ago.

It benefits from being viewed more than once. Some things which make no sense or escape your notice may become clearer and more evident with subsequent viewing.

880116,5,6304457375,"Contrary to what many reviewers may say, this is one of Scorsese's greatest films.  Along with Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and Raging Bull, it best showcases his unique and original style of directing that has made him one of the most skillful in the business.  It's an indie film classic, and creates an atmosphere and aesthetic that filmmakers have been trying to emulate ever since its release.  That being said, it's just the sort of production that mainstream moviewatchers probably won't get.  Those looking only for a predictable, clear-cut plot with a conventional style of storytelling and acting will be lost and frustrated with the improvisational nature of this movie.  Taxi Driver and Goodfellas (equally as good as Mean Streets) were both hits at the box office, because they appeal more to the masses with their general entertainment value.  Mean Streets, on the other hand, tells a somewhat dark, meandering story that at times may seem like it's going nowhere.

Martin Scorsese was able to create an intimate, realistic setting for his movie by encouraging actors to improvise certain scenes, and shooting long takes that make for flowing, realistically punctuated dialogue.  Newer filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino have been heavily influenced by Scorsese's off-the-cuff manner of directing.  Not every scene in Mean Streets makes immediate sense, because he often captures tidbits of the characters' lives that don't seem like they logically pertain to the plot.  However, the plot itself in this movie is a nebulous entity, taking a back seat to the realistic dialogue and more pronounced themes of religion, friendship, and crime.  There is a fair dose of black humor in this film, but it is ultimately more of a drama, due to the movie's dark ending, and emphasis on internal conflict with the characters, especially Harvey Keitel's excellently portrayed Charlie.

Another feat that Scorsese is accredited for in the direction of this movie is bringing two little-known actors to the forefront of Hollywood fame.  The two main stars of the movie, Harvey Keitel and Robert DeNiro, now obvious household names, were nigh-unheard of talents prior to the release of this movie.  Ever since Mean Streets, they slowly grew more and more famous, due in large part to their repeated roles in Martin Scorsese's future film classics (The Last Temptation of Christ, Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver).  Scorsese can be given partial credit for bringing the actors' talents out for his films, but it should be noted that Keitel and DeNiro both deliver amazing performances in Mean Streets, not to mention their other Scorsese movies.  Keitel's portrayel of Charlie's conflicted, devout Catholic gangster is spot-on, and DeNiro's Johnny Boy is amusing, fascinating and appropriately demands the viewer's empathy.  Both stars help to raise this movie to its classic status.

Though not as easy or accessible as Scorsese's later work, Mean Steets established him as a creative, noir-influenced filmmaker with a deft eye for realism and intimacy.  His movies are habitually more difficult than most mainstream fare, and may require repeat viewings to be truly appreciated.  Mean Streets has a good chance of going straight over many viewer's heads, especially if they have had little experience with the art of independent film.  Nevertheless, everyone who appreciates cinema should at least give Mean Streets a try, but it is a blatant fact that not everyone will enjoy it.",1109203200,8,3483,5.2284172661870505
880117,5,6304457375,"I remember taking a date to see Goodfellas when it came out in 1990 or 1991.  When we left the theater I turned to my date & said ""it kind of reminds me of my family"".  My date looked a little stunned and I had to expalin:, ""well-you know--without the guns, the drugs and the killing.  but the director got the attitudes just about right.""

Goodfellas got me interested in Scorsese, but it took me another 6 months to see ""Mean Streets"".

If anything, the feeling of ""it kind of reminds me of my family"" became even stronger--again without the drugs, the murder and the guns, but until ""Mean Streets"" I'd never seen a movie where I felt like I knew everyone in the movie.  It was intensely personal.

There's a lot of quasi-snobby stuff written about how Mean Streets is a classic movie.  People also say citizen kane is one of the greatest films ever.  I've seen CK a couple of times and I think it's a pretty good film.  I liked the story & I liked how it was filmed.  But I probably fail to appreciate CK's greatness because i take a lot of its groundbreaking film-making for granted.

Mean Streets might make you feel this way, too.  There isn't much in the way of a standard plot in the movie.  People lounge about, get in barroom brawls for dumb reasons.  People argue about debts, about right and wrong, and yeah, a couple of people get shot.

But if you're going to love the movie, you're either going to have to appreciate the fancy breakthrough cinematography or you're going to have to be the type of person who appreciates watching great actors and great characters go about their business, living their lives, like we all might have done in the early 1970s.

He served as associate director as well as head editor to the documentary ""Woodstock"" in 1970, but it wasn't until the outpouring of a semi-autobiographical tale set in the stark back alleys of New York's Little Italy that Scorsese acquired international critical acclaim. Not since ""The Graduate"" had a film so deftly interpolated popular tunes of the time into its core. Scorsese's crafty usage of The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, The Shirelles and The Ronettes acted almost as a subconscious voice of reason throughout.

""Mean Streets"" is every bit a semi-autobiographical work. Born in New York in 1942, Scorsese moved with his parents to the Lower East Side when he was eight. An asthmatic youth, Scorsese spent a great deal of time either at the cinema or homebound peering out the window in observation of the neighborhood, fantasizing about the underworld goings-on of the fancifully cloaked gentlemen of Sicilian descent - otherwise known as the mafia.

At the age of 14, Scorsese was set on becoming a priest, only to be rejected by his college of choice and ultimately turn to a career in filmmaking. It is his strong affiliation with the Catholic church that seems to catapult his directorial flair to a category unto its own. Although brutal in nature, his films are marked with a profound underlying spiritual fiber, none more so than ""Mean Streets.""

Charlie Cappa, portrayed delectably by then-cinematic novice Harvey Keitel, bears a striking resemblance to Scorsese. Cappa is an ultra-christened tough guy. He devotes a portion of his existence to maintaining a watchful eye on the troublesome Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro), a smart-ass delinquent with outstanding debt around every nook.

Cappa exclaims while on the beachfront with Teresa, Johnny's cousin, ""Who's going to help him if I don't? Nobody tries anymore - to help, that is. Saint Francis of Assisi had it all down. He knew. He knew.""

His romantic interest, Teresa, is condemned as insane due to her epilepsy. Despite his dire attempts to right all wrong and keep the parables of Christ in his daily processes as a gangster, Cappa gets caught in the crossfire and encounters his own physical hell - although his essence remains intact. In an early voice-over, he not only explains this inner turmoil, but provides a contemplation on the film as a whole:

""Pain and hell has two sides - the kind you can touch with your hand, the kind you can feel in your heart, your soul, the spiritual side; and you know the worst of the two is the spiritual.""",1096243200,4,3031,5.013916500994036

The plot is basically about Harvey Kietel growing up in New York City, dealing everyday with problems:  the local mob, his epileptic girlfriend, his idiot best friend, the cops, etc.  A one-star is too low, and I would've given this movie two stars but I liked seeing Robert DeNiro playing a more comic roll, as opposed to other major movie roles he's had (Casino, Goodfellas, etc).  In this film, he plays a punkass city kid named Johnny Boy with a loud mouth and no respect.  So that was entertaining.  Otherwise, a weak movie.  I'm a huge fan of mafia/crime movies but it didn't do it for me.  Sorry.",1094342400,2,753,4.518518518518518
880122,5,6304457375,"The first time I saw ""Mean Streets"" was on a double-bill with ""Straw Dogs"" at a repertory film house off the University of Pennsylvania in 1981.  Now I can't put my put my finger on it but I had seen ""Raging Bull"" shortly before this but that film did not have the visceral impact on me that ""Mean Streets"" did.  Where do you begin with this film? The dynamic soundtrack, the neighborhood ambiance, the great editing and cinematography.  Primarily this film has two great characters in Harvey Keitel's ""Charlie"" and Robert DeNiro's ""Johnny-Boy"".  They couldn't be more polar opposites.  Charlie is essentially a moral man who tries to make peace with the immoral world in which he inhabits.  Johnny-Boy is a loose cannon, oblivious to the choices that he makes, whose world could blow up in his face and he wouldn't have a clue.  Charlie is misguided by feeling that he has to make some sort of penance in reigning in Johnny-Boy.  Charlie doesn't realize how impossible this task is in the world he inhabits where order and chaos co-exist and order is enforced at the point of a gun.  Both Keitel and DeNiro make dynamic entrances in this film even though they had previously appeared in more obscure films.  One note about the commentary track on this special edition.  A gripe I've had about previous editions of Scorsese films is that they lacked a commentary  track, however, maybe I should have kept my peace.  His commentary doesn't seem to be specific to the action on the screen and he speaks a lot of film-school arcana.  It's intermittently interesting but not greatly so.",1093132800,33,1582,4.747252747252747
880123,5,6304457375,"This is a fantastic film, and I'm going to tell you why I think so, and by the time you finish reading this, you just might change your mind about it, or run out and have to see it.
The music is great. Perfectly fits the time period and setting, I dunno how much they had to pay in royalties for the songs in this film, but I love em'.
The camera work is fantastic. There's a scene where the camera gives you charlie's viewpoint, stumbling, wobbling across the bar, lights flashing, people dancing, music blaring, then zooms out to his smiling happy face. Then there's the filming of the street festival and the overall way which New York is captured so perfectly. It feels like you are really in the city, the movie has that gritty feeling to it.
The dialogue is great, many of it is ad libed by Deniro and Keitel. This is the beginning of ad libbed dialogue for deniro, the culmination being his speech in front of the mirror in taxi driver; ""You talkin' to me""? There's a scene where Keitel confronts Deniro outside the bar to ask him about his debt, the exchange is perfect, it could never have been written and its executed beautifully.
The acting is also fantastic throughout.
So, great acting, great filmwork and great dialogue all come together to create a wonderfully realistic film.
Now, the end of the movie, maybe you didn't understand it, so I'll explain the film. I'll try not to spoil the ending.
Ok, so Charlie does some bad things, he works for the mob after all, and he wants to repent for his sins, so, after going to church and then later seeing jonny boy in a bar he thinks that God has asked him to repent for his sins on the streets, by helping out Jonny Boy. He doesn't believe that saying a few hail mary's or confessing washes away one's sins. So enter the walking train wreck that is Jonny Boy.
Now, what type of person is Jonny Boy? He has no sense of responsibility, he does not answer to anyone, he does not obey any rules, never does what is expected of him.
Hmm, so what type of person is Charlie? There are several scenes in the film that let you know what type of person charlie is. The statement Charlie loves everybody and everybody loves Charlie almost sums it up. Charlie wants to please everyone. But his life is full of conflict. You can't be in the mob and be religious, it just doesn't work that way. You can't hang out with guys who are racist and date an African American. These are just a few examples, but suffice to stay that Charlie wants everyone to like him, the local mob boss, his friends, his God, but he also wants to be happy and do the things he wants to do. There is conflict in all of this. Some of the other people that charlie wants to please, eg., God and the mob boss, have conflicting agendas. Some of the people that charlie wants to please conflict with what he personally wants to do with his life, eg. he is embarassed to be dating the epileptic because he thinks it shows weakness to his friends, but he loves her and she makes him happy.
You cannot please everyone. The irony of this film, and this is a little spoiler, is that while charlie is trying to save jonny boy, he should take a few lessons from him. Jonny Boy does whatever he wants without thinking about who he might upset, or disappoint. Charlie is the complete opposite. Yeah, Jonny Boy is destructive and his life is falling apart, but the point is that the two of them represent two opposite extremes. This is why the end of the film is tragic, its the lesson that you can't make everyone happy, that life is full of conflict, the conflict may be between different people in your life which you try to please, or between yourself and other people in your life. These basic conflicts and how we deal with them sum up who we are as human beings.
So there are many reasons why this film is great, I highly recommend giving it a second chance. I watch it every once in awhile and it really is one of my favorite films.",1089590400,8,3949,4.337837837837838

For example, I believe this is the first film to use popular music as a background to many of the scenes, and now this is seen as commonplace.  The dialouge is awesome, especially between DeNiro and Keitel, and this film is really just a great period piece as a look at Italian-American life in New York's Little Italy during the early 1970's.",1082073600,4,611,4.638888888888889

880211,4,6304457375,"Following the success of his thesis project ""Who's that knocking at my door"", Scorcese returned in 1973 with Mean Streets.  Like a lot of other of Scorcese's films, Mean Streets explores the catholic guilt of the main character(Keitel) while drawing a contrast to another(DeNiro).
  Keitel is near perfect in his role.  In most other films, the audience would hardly consider Keitel a protagonist.  He runs numbers, wacthes strippers, and does not ""love"" his girlfriend.  However, when compared to Deniro's Johnny boy or some of the other characters in the film, one can't help but admire his altruism.  In Mean Streets, Keitel plays the only role he is capable of playing well: A man stuck in two different worlds; In this case the world of clubs, dark alleys and violent street corners and the other more peaceful and disciplined world he strives for.
  I don't care much for DeNiro's character, so I will not comment much on him, however it is only fitting that I reccomend some other films for Kietel fans on fans of this genre.  Bad Lieutenant is the best place for any Keitel fan to start, but it is certainly not for the faint hearted.  Taxi Driver also stars Keitel, but DeNiro is the main character.  These films both tell the story of a man who is so fed up with the turmoil he observes every day on the streets, that he takes a road which eventually results in his own destruction.",1080259200,,1392,4.659836065573771

After reading positive reviews I was really looking forward to a great tale, but didn't see much of a plot. It seems to me that if it wasn't for the big names in this film, it would be a forgotten one. If you like DeNiro, and don't mind older films, Deer Hunter is a much better film and much more thought provoking.  That film has a point (perhaps Mean Streets had one but if it did it was too boring for me to notice), and is worth multiple viewings.

880213,5,6304457375,"I did an earlier review of this movie saying that it was a '(...) good movie.' Well, after watching this the 2nd time, (soon to be 3rd), I can honestly say that this is the best movie of all time. Everything you want in a movie is all in here. Character study, drama, violence, great music, language, subplots, everything. Every character has their own unique personality. The 'plot' of the movie is that Charlie (played by Harvey Keitel), a hustler who is obssesed with religion, has to make sure that Jonny Boy (played by Robert DeNiro), a punk kid who owes a lot of money to his 'friends,' pays them back. I know the plot sounds simple, but it isn't. Scorsese uses character studies instead of following the plot. The first few minutes have a plot, but then it goes off in a new and very cool direction.
There is a resonable amount of fighting, but then, you sort of expect that from a GANGSTER MOVIE! What else would you expect? The bar room scene is my personal favorite in terms of violent scenes from the movie. That one scene has some black comedy in it, and it is hilarious to see Robert DeNiro beating a guy up with a broken pool stick. I guess that's just me, then. Oh well.
Though Harvey Keitel and Robet DeNiro are incredible, David Proval and Richard Romanus are awesome. They too are like a team, and the car scene where they found out they were 'stiffed' by some punk kids is pretty funny. And, the Carradine brothers are in this also (They play very small roles.)
Words are not enough to say how great this movie is. Anyone who wants to find a great independent film should get this one. It is the best movie that Scorsese eer did, and the best movie ever.",1063411200,4,1673,4.382636655948553
880214,5,6304457375,"Talk to any actor or any director and they're more than likely to tell you that a strong working relationship is essential to making a quality picture. The partnership between De Niro and Scorsese is one that has spawned some of the best films in the history of American cinema. From ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull"" to ""Good Fellas"", ""Cape Fear"", and ""Casino"", it all started right here, with ""Mean Streets"".
""Mean Streets"" tells the story of 2 young men, Charlie and Johnny Boy, trying to make their way in New York's Little Italy. Charlie is the nephew of a local mob boss and Johnny Boy is a gambler with a lot of debt. Charlie tries to do all he can for his friend Johnny Boy to help him out with his money troubles, but Johnny Boy keeps messing things up. He keeps spending his money and disrespecting the wrong people. Admist his attempts to help out a friend, Charlie also has problems of his own to deal with. After his uncle takes control of a restaurant, Charlie sees opportunity knocking at his door, but he worries about how his friendship with Johnny and his relationship with Johnny's cousin will affect his chances at getting to run the business. Charlie also spends much of his time dealing with his Catholic guilt. Religion plays a fairly significant role in Charlie's life, as does his criminal career, and the 2 obviously do not go together well.
The third film in a career that spans over 30 years, this was the movie that put Scorsese on the map as one of the greatest directors in America cinema. Keitel and De Niro also got major career boosts from this film. A landmark picture, not only for the launching of three of the most successful film careers in the last 3 decades, but also a monumental achievement in itself. Even if De Niro, Scorsese, and Keitel all never made another movie after this, it would still be fantastic in my eyes.
The wiriting, direction, performances, and editing are all top notch here. The dialog is very natural and absorbing and the directing is remarkable. The cinematography is fantastic, as is the norm in Scorsese's movies. The camera work in the scene were Johnny walks into the bar in the beginning of the movie is great, and the use of the red lighting is brilliant. The performances here are what really steals the show, though. Harvey Keitel is terrific as Charlie and De Niro is extremely engaging as Johnny Boy. Johnny Boy is one of my favorite characters out of De Niro's entire filmography. He's so charismatic and the screen presence he brings is awe inspiring. It's impossible to take your eyes off of him. Johnny Boy is an immensly likable character in many ways (at least I thought so), which is very important in this kind of film. In movies like this where the responsible friend lays it all on the line for his screw up buddy, the audience will never get it unless they can end up liking the screw up as much as the responsible friend does. The viewer needs to be able to see why someone would be willing to risk their future for this guy. De Niro doesn't dissapoint in the least in that aspect, or in any other for that matter.
For fans of De Niro and/or Scorsese, this film is absolutely essential veiwing. Without this film, we wouldn't have ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Good Fellas"" or any other films by De Niro and Scorsese.

880285,5,6304457375,"Ah yes..the film that started a collaboration for the books. 'Mean Streets' paired a young director and a young actor who shared the common goal of looking to get their big break.
Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro together for the first time.
This movie started a relationship that spans eight films and sparked creative genius from behind-the-camera as well as in front of the camera that has yet to be duplicated.
'Mean Streets' offers a little insight into a world that's both fascinating and dangerous, thanks to Scorsese's semi-autobiographical references he incorporated into this film.
Harvey Keitel plays a young Italian named Charlie. As Johnny-Boy so eloquently puts it, ""Charlies likes everybody. Everybody likes Charlie."" He struggles to live his life with some degree of normalcy, but immediately feels the pressures of his Little Italy neighborhood. He feels he has to save Johnny-Boy from a life of gambling and heavy debt, but when he can't, the climax begins to unfold. A far cry from his 'Sport' characterization in ""Taxi Driver,"" Harvey Keitel gives a great and sympathy-evoking performance.
Robert De Niro plays Johnny-Boy, Charlie's childhood friend who's a bit unbalanced and a lot in debt. This role here offers a foreshadowing in the roles that good 'ol Bobby D. would later become famous for. ::Ahem:: 'Travis Bickle' in ""Taxi Driver."" Johnny-Boy is enjoyable, from his entrance into Charlie's bar right up to the climatic end (I'm not giving it away.)De Niro is astounding, and I'm not saying that just because he's my favorite actor on the face of this green earth. He's really captivating. It's extremely hard to take your eyes off of him because of his character's unpredicatability. All I could say when I finished watching this movie was..""WOW..""

...If you want to see where genius comes from, get this film.

880286,4,6304457375,"""Mean Streets"" is essentially a small character study that is taken from a very short period of the characters' lives during the San Gennaro feast and ends rather abruptly.  It is also loosely based on Scorsese's own up-bringing in ""Little Italy"" during the 60's.
Harvey Keitel (Charlie) is a kind-hearted, small time hustler who defends, is attracted to, and protects people around him that are viewed as unsavory or weak links amongst the more powerful and successful loan sharks and Italian bar owners and restauranteers.  In particular his uncle who wants to hand over a debt ridden, upscale restaurant to Charlie.
Robert Deniro (Johnny Boy) is a small time punk who never pays his debts, has problems with everything and everyone, and continually commits adolescent pranks with reckless abandon.
Charlie views him as family and tries hopelessly to keep him out of trouble, namely with a fledgling loan shark who wants to be taken seriously and has a history of buying bad product foolishly on the black market.
Amy Robinson (Teresa) is an epileptic that is looked down upon by Charlie's rich Italian uncle, and Charlie is resistant to her pleas of commitment as a result.  Charlie clearly cares for her and enjoys her company, but draws a line of subconsciously motivated indifference whenever things get to hot for them.
Charlie's penchant for balancing his religious ideals with the street life and caring for those viewed as troublesome or less fortunate is a tragic flaw of his that ultimately ends in tragedy and misfortune.
Scorsese's appealing and stylish directorial abilities are first evidenced in this film and as a result make it a kind of closet classic, since it has receieved little noteriety for the last 20 years.
It's not quite as graphic and violent as his latter films, and the acting at times sans the jobs of the main characters, can be silly and unbelieveable (ecspecially the fight scenes).  But I found myself drawn in to the story as the character's revealed themselves and Deniro's brilliant acting really make it stand out.
It's not without flaws, a bit rough around the edges, and probably should've been longer and maybe contained more of a pointed statement of some sort, as ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Last Temptation Of Christ"" did, for instance.  But giving this director some slack for his first film is easy.  He's a brilliant director and writer and just owning this first work by him is a must for big fans of his.
It's a great DVD for the price ... . The DVD itself is of poor quality in the audio department and the lack of any extras at all is a shame.  The DVD visual quality is just fine for it's age though.
But like all Scorsese films the soundtrack is superb and does a great job of immersing one into the sounds of the time the film takes place.
Certainly not my favorite Scorsese movie, but if you like his films, then you'll certainly at least enjoy this one as well, ecspecially for the meager price and rather short running time (112 minutes).",1024185600,2,2993,4.777562862669246

This movie has great acting by Keitel & De Niro, however the plot is absurd! Let me break it down for ya:
Charlie (Keitel) runs errands for his uncle, Giovanni (the local mob boss). Charlie's main buddies are Michael, the goodhearted loanshark (played by Richard Romanus) and Johnny Boy (De Niro), a petty & delinquint loser, who happens to owe Michael quite a bit of money.  Early on in the movie, Charlie is visiting a guy named Oscar, at his restaurant, to ""collect"" for his uncle. Oscar tells Charlie that he can't make the payments to his uncle because his business partner has skipped outta town. Oscar knows that he has no choice but to turn the restaurant over to Charlie's uncle, Giovanni. Giovanni, in turn, is planning to give the restaurant to Charlie, for his excellent work. His only requests to Charlie is to stop hanging around with Johnny Boy, and to keep an eye on Johnny Boy's  cousin, Theresa, (who happens to live right next to Charlie). Giovanni further states to Charlie, to not get involved with Theresa because she is a ""freak"",(a ""freak"" because she has epilepsy). We find out from uncle Giovanni that Johnny Boy & Theresa are from another 'family' that had past ties with Charlie's family. Well, what do you know, Charlie is already 'secretly' dating Theresa. Meanwhile, Michael keeps hustling Charlie about Johnny Boy's debts. Charlie keeps assuring Michael that he'll talk to Johnny Boy. And everytime he talks to Johnny Boy, it goes in one ear, and out the other.

Charlie(Harvey Keitel) is an up-and-coming hood in New York City's Little Italy.  Charlie wants to save his half-wit best friend, Johnny Boy(Robert DeNiro), who is in deep debt to a loan shark.  The ultimate result is tragedy.
Scorsese's ""Mean Streets"" is one of the greatest movies of the 1970s.  ""Mean Streets"" was the first collaboration between DeNiro and Scorsese and also the film that brought both of them to national prominence.  The story primarily focuses on Keitel's character, so I don't understand why DeNiro received top billing.  The great performances by DeNiro and Keitel gave a hint to the stardom that would later be achieved by these two performers.  Robert DeNiro may be the very last of the great movie actors.  He is the ONLY present day actor who comes close to matching Marlon Brando for sheer talent and charisma.  DeNiro completely immerses himself into the role of Johnny Boy.  Scorsese also weaves strong themes of religion and redemption into his film.  All of Scorsese's films are marked by intense realism.  The low budget-""Mean Streets"" has a strong grittiness that is sorely lacking in even Francis Ford Coppola's ""Godfather"" masterpieces.

880455,5,6304457375,"Mean Streets is the movie that broke out the careers of director Martin Scorcese and Harvey Keitel and Robert DeNiro.  The film set the mold for the directorial style that Mr. Scorcese would follow the rest of his career; including the goodfella plotline and heavy doses of doo wop music, early 60's rock & r&b.  The story centers around Charlie, who is a low level mobster.  He doesn't have alot of rank and privilege, but the guys in the neighborhood always seem to come to them with their problems.  Charlie is quite religious and despite his shady career, he is a nice guy.  He keeps his relationship with his epileptic girlfriend Theresa a secret and he is constantly putting out fires started by her cousin and his best friend Johnny-Boy.  Johnny is a loose cannon who in debt big time to a local loan shark.  The movie ends in a rush of gunfire and crashing cars.  Mr. Scorcese does a magnificent job of conveying the day-to-day life of guys in Little Italy.  The film has a definite personal touch and you can image that these were the guys he knew from his neighborhood. Mr. Keitel is Charlie and he does a great job of portraying him as a man with all the weight of the world on his shoulders.  Even though Mr. Keitel has the lead role and is in just about every scene, the real star of the film is Mr. DeNiro as Johnny-Boy.  He explodes off the screen with a fiery, over the top performance.

This is somehow the message of almost all of his movies.  Keitel plays Charlie, who is keen to do the right thing by God and by himself. He keeps asking for a sign which is delivered to him in the shape of Johnny Boy ( Bobby de Niro ), a loser, an irresponsible gambler that believes that the people that surround him owe him a living. He is going to be the cross that Charlie will have to bear. Even the neighbourhood godfather has washed his hands of him. He keeps telling Charlie, his nephew, to cut the ties with this loser, but Charlie is torn between the loyalty to his friend and fealty to his family. But Johnny Boy manages to make life even more difficult by refusing to pay off a local loan shark and then rebuffing Charlie's attempts to mediate. Charlie and his girlfriend Teresa decide to smuggle Johnny out of the neighbourhood, but they're pursued by the loan shark's gunmen who hand out a vicious lesson in the final bloody confrontation.  Both de Niro and Keitel give absolutely electrifying performances, especially de Niro who is simply explosive right on the first appearance in the movie when he drops a bomb into a mailbox and than runs away exhilarated by what he has just done.  This is an important movie in the cinema history: it brought a new filming technique, a young director who'd later establish himself as one of the greatest of the last thirty years, and it was the first milestone in young de Niro's career ( ""Bang the drum slowly"" was not much known at the time and is yet less known nowadays ): the man was a firework waiting to go off! And what maybe matters the most - the movie has laid the groundwork for the most important creative relationship between an actor and a director in the history of the cinema. Scorsese had found his artistical twin, the actor who most mirrored and complemented his own sensibilities. On the other hand de Niro had found a director whose sense of commitement and intensity of purpose matched his own.

There is no intricate story here, however,the charactor development is exceptional. The viewer gets to know Tony (David Provol), Harvey Keitel and Deniro's (Johnny Boy)charactors. There is an underlying message of loyalty and friendship in the midst of a daily life struggle to make a buck. Scamming some teenagers out of $20.00 seems to be a highlight to a full day of running numbers and collecting on debts. There is a simplicity in this lifestyle that illustrates the precise mind set that these charactors have. There are shots in this film that certainly layed the groundwork for Goodfellas and Taxi Driver. Scorcese went on to make Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore just to escape a stereotype image of making hard core films. Thank someone for Scorcese's urge to get back to what he does best. If Mean Streets was a training ground for making films that would become many peoples top 10 fav's than it must be a film making blueprint that should not go under rated. By the way, I did notice some distortion in some of the audio tracks; like Be my Baby the film opener. Otherwise, the transfer is excellent; better than you would expect. In the scene where Keitel and Amy Robinson are walking down the hall way, there is some film dropout that is noticeable.

880458,5,6304457375,"Mean Streets is notable because it marks the first collaboration between director Martin Scorsese and actor Robert De Niro but it's worth watching for many reasons.
There is no comparable movie that- on an obvious shoestring budget- conveys such power, intensity and vision to its audience. This movie dazzles with its technical virtuosity and its incredible heart. This movie is REAL, in that it conveys the director's singular vision with such clarity and passion that you find yourself being sucked into this grimy world of hoodlums and hangers-on from the very first scene. Mean Streets keeps you on the edge: the violence hits you with the impact of a closed fist and the gritty dialogue bounces through your mind long after the credits have rolled.
On a side note, the use of music in this movie is the best I've ever seen or heard. It doesn't seem added-on or give you the impression of music video in the middle of the movie. It's central to the film and its adds power to the images and grace to the characters. If the sound of 'Be my baby' floating over the opening credits doesn't grip you, nothing will.
Mean Streets is a movie of exceptional intenisty and impact. It may not be Scorsese's best but it is one of his seminal works and  the closest he has come to making an 'auteur' film. It's a must for any fan of great movie-making",971222400,4,1344,4.6

880460,4,6304457375,"This 1973 film was written and directed by Martin Scorsese and has  received much praise through the years.  Starring Harvey Keitel and Robert  DeNiro, the story is based on the Little Italy of Scorsese's boyhood. I  understand that Scorsese once studied for the priesthood and elements of  his Catholic faith and the state of sin are a constant theme against the  backdrop of petty gangsters, loan sharks and forbidden  relationships.
Keitel plays Charlie, who works for his loan-shark uncle.  DeNiro plays Johhny Boy, a small-time and half-crazy gambler.  Like other  Scorsese films, the dialog is often improvised, thereby giving the film a  rough realism. Scorsese techniques include slow motion, scenes inside the  bar bathed in red and a hand-held camera to get special choppy effects. He  also uses the soundtracks of popular songs as background to brawls.
The  acting is excellent.  I felt the pulse of New York even though I understand  that most of it was shot in Los Angeles.  And the humanity of the  characters all show through.
The weakness of the movie though was its  story.  Even though it loosely followed the characters to the inevitable  conclusion of violence, there were no real surprises.  It was basically a  character study and a picture of New York in the fifties.  After my initial  impression of how well this was done, I yearned for a good plot, something  that would pull me into the action and make me wonder what was coming next.  That didn't happen.
I don't think this film stood the test of time well  because I can't help comparing it to later films by Scorsese with more  action.  Don't pass it by though;  it's well worth a look for historical  perspective.  Just understand it is an early work.",968284800,3,1732,4.821917808219178

880462,5,6304457375,"One of Scorsese's earlier films but all his personal trademarks are here. Scorsese is a very talented and original filmmaker and his personal  backdrop has always been evident in his films and this one particularly is  personal filmmaking at it's best. A shocking, riveting and explosive tale  of small time hoods in Little Italy. Harvey Keitel marked his second  collaboration with Scorsese, he also starred in Scorsese's debut 1968's  'Who's that knocking at my door?' and would later reteam with him in 'Taxi  Driver' and 'Last Temptation Of Christ'. Keitel is excellent as Charlie a  guilt-stricken catholic who pays for his sins 'his own way'. DeNiro is  nothing short of brilliant in the role of psychotic and reckless Johnny  Boy. While the film is famous for having a minimal plot, it is still a  fascinating character study. The plot has to do with Charlie aspiring to  move up in his Mafia career but can't because of his friendship with Johnny  Boy and love relationship with his epileptic cousin Teresa (Amy Robinson)  whom the bosses think is 'crazy'. All the elements that would later become  Scorsese's personal trademarks are here; an awesome rocking 60's soundtrack  that seems perfectly appropriate, dizzying camerawork, voice-over  narration, instantaneous mad bursts of violence, and of course DeNiro.  Richly textured characters and innovative use of lightning. Scorsese would  go on and make 'Taxi Driver', one of the best of all films, just 3 years  later and if you look closely you may experience deja vu twice. Once with  Keitel continuously putting his hand or finger under fire, so does Travis  Bickle (DeNiro) in an unforgettable scene. While Charlie does it as some  kind of penance, Travis only does it to pass the time or as part of his  'training'. The other element is that DeNiro is shot in the neck, same  thing in Taxi Driver. An unforgettably gritty film that brought us the  talents of Scorsese, DeNiro and Keitel, we must be thankful just for that  reason. Extras: the gunman who shoots DeNiro is Scorsese himself.

I was 11 years old when ""Mean Streets"" hit  the movie theatres, and I have been in love with the oldies since I was 17  years old and started listening to WCBS-FM.  Those are the two, and only  two, things that Means Streets has going for it.

880552,5,6304457375,"""Mean Streets,"" simply put, is the greatest independent film ever made. At the very least, it pioneered what modern audiences have come to associate with the best of indie cinema, and what, by the late '90s, has  become so essential to our perception of so-called ""hip"" movies  that the once daring and exhilarating techniques are now mostly used as  frustrating cliches.  The picture itself, made in 1973, is most famous for  kick-starting three major careers. Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro later  collaborated as a director/actor team on four more masterpieces: ""Taxi  Driver,"" ""Raging Bull"" ""The King of Comedy"" and  ""Goodfellas."" Harvey Keitel, in the leading role, went on to play  other memorable characters, like ""Pulp Fiction""'s Mr. Wolf.  Cast  as Charlie , a small-time, young gangster in New York's Little Italy,  Keitel struggles to make sense of his Catholic background and help his  troubled friend (DeNiro) stay out of the powerful Mafia players' way. What  seems to be a familiar scenario, used as far back as the classic  Bogart/Cagney vehicles, gets an unusually complex treatment from Scorsese.  A conventional, linear plot structure with big speeches and witty  one-liners from main characters is abandoned for a grittier, naturalistic  approach. The film consists of a series of telling episodes, related only  through their participants. ""Mean Streets"" has much more in  common with the works of Italian Neo-realism or French New Wave, rather  than a typical gangster drama. Its unorthodox, original, yet unpretentious  camera work gives the film an unprecedented vitality that young filmmakers  have attempted to recreate for decades. Now commonplace shots, such as a  subtitled introduction of a particular character, a fight sequence tracked  through the four corners of a room in a single take, a swaying hand-held  camera to create the sense of an alcohol-induced stupor, have all been  popularized through this movie, a veritable Bible of dynamic  cinematography. Another revolutionary aspect of ""Mean Streets"" is  the virtual lack of a script. Most of the key scenes were almost fully  improvised, thus sounding far more authentic than the old-style, theatrical  delivery used in most American films up to that time. The actors' speech is  so profanity-ridden that no screenwriter of the time could have possibly  doctored anything even close. De Niro's flamboyant turn as a youth on the  edge of sanity is unlike anything before. In fact,the swear-fests of later  crime movies (and indie classics like ""Clerks"") owe a direct debt  to his extraordinary performance as Johnny Boy. One of Scorcese's most  groundbraking achievements was his incorporation of popular songs into the  soundtrack. All of the icluded music originates elsewhere- Italian  traditional recordings (Opera arias, Folk tunes) and for the most part,  glorious, irresistable Rock'n'Roll of the early 60's (Motown, the Stones,  Girl Groups, DooWop).The easily identifiable hits serve as atmospheric  settings, adding an extra, personal dimension to any given scene. George  Lucas' ""American Graffiti"", released in the same year, operated  by the same principle, establishing a tradition that seems to expand with  every coming year. As it is often the case with true independent cinema,  ""Mean Streets"" was ignored at the box office, despite an  underground acclaim which helped launch not only the great talents behind  it, but an entire school of filmmaking.",944092800,133,3461,5.393258426966292

880556,5,6304457375,"If Mean Streets did nothing more than introduce Martin Scorsese, Robert de Niro and Harvey Keitel to the general filmgoing public (although not the first film for any of the three, it certainly was the first film to capture  the attention of the critics and public), then it would still deserve to be  considered one of the most important of all contemporary films.  But the  film is much more - it established the interwoven themes which Scorsese,  perhaps the greatest living film-maker now that Stanley Kubrick has died,  carries through virtually the entire spectrum of his work.  See this film,  and then watch Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas and see how a  master director developed his craft. Even so, Mean Streets is arguably  Scorsese's best film: because the style was so innovative, the rawness and  violence of both the treatment of the subject matter and of the two lead  performances perhaps had a greater impact than anything either the director  or the actors have done since. De Niro's stunning performance as Johnny Boy  takes on the proportions of a Greek tragic hero, moving steadily toward his  violent and inevitable destiny. In one fell swoop he established himself as  one of the greatest actors of his generation (and would go on with Scorsese  to achieve his greatest  triumph - Raging Bull). Keitel, a Scorsese regular  from the latter's very first film (Who's That Knocking At My Door), has  never been better.",926294400,44,1447,4.925311203319502
