Their BEST OF JOHN WAYNE five movie set is a space waster: a block of five slow speed tapes with an hour movie on each. In LP mode, GOODTIMES could have fit four movies on a single tape.

As for these pre-Stagecoach Duke Wayne westerns: he's young, unpolished and working on a shoestring with other 'B' unit actors and technicians. Duke's fans and perhaps western aficionados will want to see these slight movies. I've owned 20 old Wayne programmers for almost a decade and still haven't seen half of them, so that's where I stand! I also have a six-hour ""all-night westerns"" tape with other actors. It works pretty well for 25 years old.
