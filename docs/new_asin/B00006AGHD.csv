1737011,5,B00006AGHD,"Insomnia is one of those movies where it keeps you on edge throughout it all.  There wasn't non-stop action or blood and guts flying everywhere, but it was just excellent acting and directing that made the atmosphere so up tight.
That's what Insomnia was all about.  It had great, experienced acting in it and superb directing.  Al Pacino, in my opinion, gave an Oscar worthy performance.  I haven't seen a better job done all year.  Robin Williams played a perfect psycho.  He's maybe not in the same class as Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, but he proves yet again that he can hold his own in dramas.
I was fixated to the screen just about the whole entire movie.  The actors and the plot were both believable, which is a plus.  And the ending, once again in my opinion, was not a cliche.  I thought it was quite interesting how everything turned out.
Insomnia is definitely a movie I strongly recommend.  You will not be disappointed, unless you have no bearing at all on the difference between a good movie and a bad one.  5 Stars",1022371200,,1056,4.505263157894737

I may be kind of biased in saying that Al Pacino once again gives us a another top-notch display in acting, being that he is my favorite actor and I've been waiting too long for another good movie of his(Any Given Sunday? Please!) Pacino plays a detective, but not one with a clear conscience, actually making him a bad guy of sorts.(He's the biggest badass, can he help it?). The combination of his guilt and the entire-day sunlight of Alaka deprives him of sleep, and he gradually falls into a madness that you can sense in his tired old face. This is for sure Pacino's show, but Williams comes very to stealing it.

1737015,5,B00006AGHD,"I thought this movie was great in every sense of the word great.  Before I even saw the movie on its opening night I thought with the cast of Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hillary Swank with the direction of Christopher Nolan of Memento fame would make for an outstanding movie.  I was not disappointed in the least.  Some these other ""amateur reviewers"" make such a big deal about it being a remake and not being ""fresh"" piece of work.  Some times these remakes really work and this it certainly is a case in point.  {for instances a not-so-good remake is Vanilla Sky, of the top of my head) As for as acting gods go, Al Pacino is definitely Mount Rushmore in my book. His turn here as a fatigued, two-faced detective with rather auspicious methods is absolutely pitch perfect and will get him on the Best Actor short list.  Ditto for Robin Williams.  His performance here continues to confirm his ever-increasing reputation as a considerable dramatic actor of grand proportions.  Hillary Swank's turn here stands up well to the other two quite outstanding performances.  With this movie, Christopher Nolan has offically arrived in the modern filmmaking era proving that Memento was no fluke or flash in the pan.  The only slight problem with his movies are the release dates on them.  Last year Memento was released way early and may have been mostly forgotten by Oscar time.  This year Insomnia is again early and is also competing against the cash cows Spider Man and the latest Star Wars movie that will make for a tough run at the box office.  If you enjoy smart well-acted movies, this is a sure bet.",1022284800,,1608,4.659574468085107
1737016,4,B00006AGHD,"The director of ""Memento"" keeps the chronology moving forward this time, but continues
the mind games that will get under your skin, again.  Insomnia is Christopher Nolan's first
big Hollywood movie, and he couldn't have made a bigger name for himself.
A murder has plagued a small Alaskan town, their police force has called in Los Angles
detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) to help catch the brutal killer (Robin Williams).
Dormer is accompanied by his partner, Hap, (Martin Donovan) who is threatening to
reveal details about a former case that could put Dormer's career in jeopardy.  From the
start, we see turmoil between the two cops.  Dormer and Hap travel with the local cops to
an isolated beach house out in the Alaskan wildlife where they suspect the killer to be
located.
The scenery is absolutely gorgeous, a refreshing site that we are starting to see
less and less of thanks to George Lucas and CGI that produce artificial environments in
virtually every movie being made.  There is an intense chase through the thick fog and
consequently, Dormer fatally shoots his partner.  We automatically think it was an
accident, but the rough beginning between Dormer and Hap will make you question
Dormer's integrity.  When backup arrives, Dormer lies and tells the Alaskan cops that it
was the killer who shot his partner.  Detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) is assigned to
investigate that specific shooting and begins to suspect Dormer after learning about his
past.  While working on the case, now without a partner, Dormer gets a call from our pal
Robin Williams, who tells Dormer that he saw the whole incident and blackmails Dormer
into helping him set up an innocent man to take the fall.
I didn't know what to expect walking into the movie knowing that Al Pacino would play
the good guy, and Robin Williams the role of a book writer that has brutally killed a 17
year old girl.  But it worked.  In fact, Williams was disturbing.  I tried seeing Williams in
his ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" days, but I couldn't produce an image.  He was evil, and did one hell
of a job.  Pacino was just as good.  His tired expressions were believable and so was his
attitude.
Besides having to track down the killer, Dormer has to face an even bigger obstacle.  It is
summer in Alaska, and the sun has been shining for his entire stay.  Dormer finds himself
awake every night, unable to sleep through the blistering sunlight.  Pacino's naturally raspy
voice and baggy eyes make you feel his pain, and he always sounded like he was awoken
at 3 a.m.  As each day passes, his character gets no sleep, and he keeps getting flashbacks
of the chase where his kills his own partner.  He also begins to hallucinate while his health
sharply deteriorates with each passing day.
The chemistry was strong between Williams and Pacino, much of the time together was
them simply talking, trying to work something out so Dormer could save his career and
maintain his reputation as a the great detective that he is known as.  All of the acting was
convincing and nearly flawless.  No corny punch-lines that haunted Star Wars: Episode II
and other mainstream flicks.  Insomnia had nothing less than a solid script.
The constant daylight becomes it's own entity, making the frosty Alaska a surprisingly
creepy setting for Dormer to roam.  Insomnia is a movie you want to stay up for, even if
you haven't been awake the past six days, like detective Will Dormer.",1022284800,,3428,4.782682512733446
1737017,5,B00006AGHD,"Name a movie that Pacino hasn't delivered a masterful performance?  Has he ever disappointed his audience?
Christopher Nolan's Insomnia comes after his success with Memento, a film I gave only 3 stars, but received critical acclaim from my peers in the film industry.  In Insomnia, the difference is Pacino and Williams.  Two academy award winners in two great performances.  Robin Williams is as great in dramatic roles as he is in comedy.  If fact, he's better!  Williams was able to hold his screen presence with Pacino, one of the greatest actors in history.  Pacino as only he can,  brilliantly immerses himself so deeply in to his role that you only see the character and not Pacino!  The movie is a solid R rating due to language and violence.  For the mature audience it a must see! Enjoy the twists and turns!",1022198400,,818,4.73758865248227
1737018,5,B00006AGHD,"Insomnia, director Chris Nolan's second full length feature, doesn't have the same gut-wrenching and mind-bending plot twists that his feature length debut, Memento, had, but does an excellent job telling an original and gripping detective mystery.
The pleasure of Insomnia is to be found in its rich cinematography, beautiful landscapes, and excellent performances. The movie is one of the most visually compelling pieces of filmmaking I have seen in years, creating surreal juxtapositions with the vast, harsh Alaskan landscape and with close-up shots of crime scene evidence. The amazing visual landscapes (both large and small) are used effectively by director Nolan to emphasize the films themes of isolation and overpowerment, of losing oneself within ones environment and in ones choices.
Insomnia's plot will disappoint those looking for a new Memento, in that it does not have the sort of turns of action and motivation that Memento does. Insomnia works well without elaborate plot twists, however, it's mood benefits from a certain lack of ambiguity of action, although the ending is perhaps a little to predictable and cliched. Insomnia would have benefited, however, from more ambiguity of motivation - while the acting is top notch, especially on the part of Robin Williams, the connections between the characters actions and their motivations and decisions is too closely drawn by the script.
Overall Insomnia is an excellent movie, and a good entry into the detective/suspense movie cannon. It suffers slightly from a couple of bad edits (in a movie filled with amazing editing and shooting) and from its desire to clearly spell out the principle characters motivations, but these minor flaws are more than redeemed by the director's excellent camerawork and sense of pacing, a strong script, and very solid acting performances. Insomnia is a must see movie, and a welcome change from the ""blockbuster"" summer movie scene of 2002.",1020470400,163,1945,5.3387622149837135
1737019,4,B00006AGHD,"It's hard to respond to this movie, which I had the opportunity to see at an advance screening.  Judged on its own, it is a pretty good thriller with good acting and nice scenery, as corny as that sounds.  Al Pacino is great, and, along with the movie's direction, really portrays what 6 days without sleeping must be like.  Robin Williams is also very good in his role, as is Hilary Swank.  I enjoyed it, but I don't know that I loved it.  It was definitely not your typical Hollywood movie, but, at the same time, was not as memorable as Memento.
  As far as the remake of the earlier ""Insomnia"" goes, it's well done, but almost seems unnecessary.  They were equally good-the major difference being that this version seemed to draw out the themes of the earlier one, which was more subtle (for better or for worse).  I'm not great at articulating exactly what I think about it, but I don't think you can make a qualitative comparison between the two.  They're just approached a little differently, and either one could be more to your liking. Since I am not initially thrilled with the movie, I'm only giving it 4 stars, but it is surely something worth checking out.",1020211200,,1169,4.523809523809524
1737020,4,B00006AGHD,"This movie, while initially met with total disappointment by myself, has really peaked my curiosity. It is absolutely absurd to write a review for something this early in the game, but there are several notes of interest where this particular film is concerned. Firstly, this film is a remake of an excellent film of the same name by director Erik Skjoldbjrg. Usually a film like this will be remade as a Hollywood venture, and will have any singular trait sucked right out of it, like ""The Vanishing"", which was made as a phenomenal Dutch film and then remade as a much lesser film in the US and made by the same director, no less! Well, in the case of ""Insomnia"", it has been handed off to another director, but a sharp one at that. Christopher Nolan, of the extremely stylish and mind-bending ""Memento"", has directed the update to the Dutch original and all signs are good.
  The story centers around a policeman who has been called to Norway to investigate a murder, and upon arriving, makes a miscalculation in firing at a suspect only to find out that it's his partner. The policeman continues the investigation, spending as much time covering his own tracks as following those of the killer. The relentless, ever present sun adds to the mix, depriving the doomed policeman with little or no sleep to work on. What culminates is a fantastic story of the thin line between madness and order, and good versus evil.
  How, you might ask, could Robin Williams ever portray a fascinating villain always one step ahead of his pursuer and always knowing that the person following him is just as corrupt as himself? Simple. If you have been following Williams' career moves of late, you'll notice in particular the upcoming One Hour Photo, in which Williams portrays a serial killer who finds the perfect family in a series of photos he develops while working at a Photo shop in a mall. Williams has done much research into the motives of these people, studying interviews with various serial killers, and developing a character far from his usual nutty family fare. His move towards the character in Insomnia could open up a series of doors Mr. Williams has long steered away from.
  As for Al Pacino, there is ample cop in him in past ventures from Serpico to Heat, but with the corruption invloved in ""Insomnia"" he could certainly show the appropriate meltdown. The overacting in Heat could allow his character to reach new heights of insanity as well as a great depiction of the onslaught of sleeplessness. Who knows?
  It all comes down to why I would bother to write a review about a film I haven't seen. The answer is simple if you haven't yet seen the original with Stellan Skarsgrd as the policeman. This film is definitely a cause for discussion, and marks one of the finest depictions of corruption on both sides of the law yet to be seen. It doesn't seem possible that a remake could top it, but any furthering of the interest is certainly welcome. Try and enjoy both if you can!",1016323200,7,2989,4.669201520912548
1737025,5,B00006AGHD,"Absolutely Brilliant!  Always a pleasure to watch top notch actors as Al Pacino and Robin Williams unfold such a complex thriller layer by layer! You have to watch closely to catch the subtle clues.  Pacino, Williams and Swank each delivered their Oscar A game along with a strong supporting cast and director/writer. The story all unfolds against the Alaskan summer sky during which the sun never sleeps.. and neither do several of our characters which adds more stress to the situation. No matter how difficult the challenges the LAPD are on the case with the local police in the wilds of Alaska; their job is to solve the murder, find the killer; no matter what.

1737035,5,B00006AGHD,"Insomnia is a 2002 American remake of the brilliant 1997 Norwegian murder mystery and psychological thriller, by the same name. The American version was directed by Christopher Nolan, and its story line centers around the investigation of the murder of a 17-year-old girl, in the small fishing town of Nightmute, Alaska. This investigation is being directed by a veteran homicide detective from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), who has been consulted because of his reputation for solving difficult murder cases. He is accompanied by his partner from the LAPD, but there is an added twist, in that that both detectives are currently being investigated by the Internal Affairs Division, because of suspicious activities back home. The investigation soon becomes complicated by an accidental friendly-fire shooting death, the subsequent cover-up of that shooting, and the insomnia and resultant exhaustion caused by the unrelenting glare of the midnight sun. Pervasive guilt from the devastating accidental shooting death of a colleague is certainly contributing to the sleeplessness and anxiety being experienced by the lead detective from the LAPD. The overarching emphasis on the around-the-clock sunlight that occurs in the far northern latitudes during the summer months, serves to create a type of reverse film noir, with perpetual light, instead of darkness. Insomnia features writing that creates an exceedingly taut and tense atmosphere, as the investigation and the concomitant cover-up of the purportedly accidental shooting death run their course. Both the plot development and the acting are excellent, with stellar performances by the lead actors Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank, as well as great performances by the talented members of the supporting cast. In addition, the beautiful Alaskan scenery that is so prominently featured in this film, is absolutely spectacular. Insomnia is a decidedly intelligent, suspenseful, and gripping murder mystery and psychological thriller, which is absolutely outstanding, and which definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1501545600,8,2136,5.720125786163522

1737038,4,B00006AGHD,"A relatively run-of-the-mill film about corruption and a cover-up by a police officer is turned into a disturbing thriller because of atmosphere alone.  Without question, ""Insomnia"" would be a good film taking nothing else into account.  The writing is good and tense, the acting is sharp and the direction does not lag.  But the environment - the gigantic Alaskan wilderness, the ""white nights"" - is the real winner here.  It is the intensity of Pacino's insomnia that causes him to question whether he shot his partner by accident.  And it leads him to make mistakes all on down the line (though, clearly, he had some prior experience with this).  The effect produced by the filtered light carries on to the viewer.  As the climax nears, it becomes hard to tell who, what, etc., is involved.  This works to the film's advantage; it's more or less a special effect applied at all times.  The ending, unfortunately, is predictable but it doesn't matter much.  The real feat here is the domineering presence of the environment.  I would recommend it.",1493596800,4,1049,4.870056497175141
1737039,5,B00006AGHD,"The American version of Insomnia is quite possibly more suspenseful and compelling than its Swedish predecessor. What most reviewers miss with this version is Chris Nolan's deliberate attempt to drag the viewer through the same type of hell his characters experience. The effects coming from lack of sleep in Lt. Dormer are reflected on screen just as they would in real life - things that go unnoticed, things said that are unheard or under-appreciated, etc. etc. (For a movie named ""Insomnia,"" the choice of the protagonist's name of ""Dormer"" was a little too on-the-nose for me, but most people don't notice that form of symbolism anyway). Knowing this was Nolan's intent makes the film that much more gripping because the cinematography echoes what the characters experience. While Pacino's acting chops need no comment, seeing Robin Williams in a dramatic role - understated, repressed, nervous, and a bit psychotic - is an enormous hat-tip to the casting director who selected him for this role. Between Insomnia and One Hour Photo, Williams was recreating himself as the stuff of psychological thrillers, sadly cut short by his suicide in 2014. If all you knew of Williams were those two films, you would have never (rightly) guessed he was ever a frenetic, stadium-filling stand-up comic. This is a film for those who like a more sophisticated approach to dark, suspenseful crime thrillers. Highly recommended.",1492560000,,1418,5.1695652173913045

1737107,4,B00006AGHD,Pacino has a few signature moves in this movie only he can pull off.  Early on the slow moving parts make the viewer expect a certain conclusion but thankfully a few twists and turns make the movie interesting and worth seeing through.  Some character development is obviously missing in a few of the subplots but that is is helpful in how the middle and end got exciting so if you get through the beginning that is a bit train tracked you will be rewarded with a theme and outcome that resonates.,1466121600,,497,4.450549450549451

It was one of those films you think about giving up on but interesting enough to hang on to see what happens.  I don't want to create a spoiler-alert but will say that there was a non-logical instance in the film where the main character (Pacino) let the fog cloud both his judgment and common sense.

1737554,4,B00006AGHD,"Al Pacino -- it's all about him in this movie, really.  He's tired -- he can't sleep.  But he has been brought in to catch a killer, and he's gonna do it. How many other actors can make you believe they could be completely sleep deprived and increasingly loopy and STILL dogged enough to catch the killer?  Robin Williams is good, and rather understated in this role.  I remember when he started acting and everything was BIG!  But he learned and turned into a really interesting and effective actor.  Hillary Swank is wonderful (and young) as the small-town Alaskan girl who idolizes Pacino.  She is so solid -- not too naive, but a bit of an innocent, still; worshipful of a famous, older detective, and thrilled to be working (unexpectedly) with him in her podunk Alaskan town.  The script -- it's a bit obvious in places, but hey, it's a thriller, right?  The setting is stunning - Alaska in summer, when it never gets dark.  Lovely shots of lakes and forest, and the overall feeling of isolation and being out of one's element (Pacino).  Alaska has a real presence in this film. I liked the movie, and it held my interest, mostly.  Some of the plot turns were obvious, but Al Pacino is hard NOT to watch and enjoy.  And Robin Williams, as well, although his part is smaller than Pacino's.  Plus Hillary Swank, who is a worthy foil for both of them, even as young as she seems to be in this (it was made in 2002).  I found it enjoyable for the performances and the scenery and worth watching.",1461024000,,1496,4.468634686346864

1737577,5,B00006AGHD,"I really enjoyed 'Insomnia.'  For me the movie itself revolves around the power of Al Pacino and his captivating performance in the film. This psychological drama lives on heavy performances with a captivating plot and sub-plot to drive an interesting story through the Alaskan tundra. I do want to start by voicing my biggest complaint with the movie before I jump on the bandwagon and rave it up. The idea of pushing an LA detective out to Alaska to work a case based off of an IA (internal affairs) investigation seems forced and incoherent. With that out of my system, let's look at all of the good.

The casting was superb to say the least. Al Pacino and Robin Williams make a tremendously powerful opposing force duo that help pulse the entire film to the end. Hilary Swank portrays a young detective who must straddle the line between the job and her emotions while watching her biggest idol become more and more enthralled with the case. Maura Tierney and Martin Donovan play important and interesting side roles in the ever twisting story. Wrapping up the list of good names on this film is director Christopher Nolan who once again takes a film and turns it into an emotional epic.

The acting on its own is enough to warrant a viewing of 'Insomnia' and when you couple in the beautiful landscapes and sequences with an interesting and tantalizing script you are left with a truly top class film. I don't want to talk much about the film itself because even small details will change your perception and feelings toward the film. Just snag it, curl up, and enjoy this amazing drama!

To mention any material aspect of the movie in the review will spoil the movie for the viewer. This is a classic crime drama with imperfect people on both sides of the law. Acting is top notch and very believable. The movie takes place in Alaska, during the Summer where Alaska earns the nickname Land of the Midnight Sun. This aspect of the environment plays prominently in the ability of newly arrived detective to maintain focus and keep his wits about him as the lack of sleep adds to the fatigue of being in unfamiliar surroundings.",1461024000,2,696,4.488188976377953

1737675,3,B00006AGHD,"The movie had potential but went off-track somewhere.  As others have mentioned, it's not a whodunnit.  It's about mistakes and how people try to escape the consequences. Robin Williams does a great job as the mystery writer/murderer (memorable without mugging for the camera) but the rest of the cast were bland in their roles.  I'm not sure if it was the directing or the writing that was the letdown but it felt like the movie was badly toned down in an attempt to create atmosphere.

It's definitely watchable and the scenery is gorgeous, but it left me thinking more about what was missing than what happened in the movie.",1459728000,,627,4.724770642201835

1737689,5,B00006AGHD,"Made in similar vein and tempo as Memento, director Chris Nolan's other crime thriller, Insomnia delivers a clever plot that is well executed by Pacino, Williams and Swank. My appreciation of it owes enormously to the thoughtful ethical questions the movie serves up centering around protagonist Will Dormer, Pacino's character, a veteran L.A. cop assigned to help investigate a murder in a small Alaskan town. Dormer grapples with sleeplessness caused by a non-setting sun as well as the incessant onslaught of memory flashes from his own guilty conscience. He embodies both good cop and bad cop, and the latter almost consumes him, putting him in league with the real killer, Walter Finch (Williams' character), who in contrast has no such predicament. In the end, good cop wins but not before Ellie Burr (Swank), a local young cop with exuberance untainted by experience has started to uncover Dormer's dark secret.",1459382400,,918,5.167785234899329

1737745,5,B00006AGHD,"I earlier gave this 4 stars and said it was good, but out of Nolan's norm. Well, that's because I had not payed enough attention. In fact this is right in Nolan's norm in a really important way. The writing gives us a perfectly complicated moral/legal dilemma. It's the same dilemma faced by Bruce/Batman so memorably in The Dark Knight: to what extent will a good guy either choose or be forced to become like the bad guy in order to stop the bad guy? And will price will the good guy pay if he bends in order to stop the bad/evil? The writing/psychoIogy is as good as any of Nolan's always well-written films. But you do have to pay close attention to get a handle on how sophisticated and precise it all is. And then there's the acting. And then there's the cinematography. Here's something. Once you know the whole story about the sleepless, groggy, guilty detective, watch *very closely* how the opening credits are shot and, especially, edited. Brilliant in my book. I now rank Insomnia right behind Dark Knight, which is one of my absolute favorite films.",1453766400,3,1062,4.594736842105263

1737781,1,B00006AGHD,"PThis was one of the WORST MOVIES I ever sat through. What was wrong with Al Pacino in this film? Besides the fact that he looked absolutely horrible, even though he suffers from the title , he still looks awful. Far as his acting in this film, it too suffered. Also the way his character behaved in the movie was terrible. Without spoiling it, the things he does are bad, unsuitable for a police officer. Alot of  times you will be left thinking, why would he do that? Bad decision making on his part for just about everything, and he digs himself in to a deeper hole through out the whole film. Its one of those movies where you want to reach into the tv and shake this guy.
Hillary Swank was good as the new cop. You kind of feel bad for her because you can see her talent shining through this mess of a movie.
Robin Williams does a fine job as the bad guy also. But unfortunately both of their good performances cannot help this horrible movie
Now Im a big Pacino fan, and do throughly enjoy a good crime drama, but between his fatigued and lost look in the whole movie, the decisions he makes that are just plain stupid, just make you want to scream.
How I sat through the entire movie is beyond me. Maybe because I am a Pacino fan I was hoping it would get better? But it never does, if anything it gets much worse.

I would definitely recommend viewing the 1997 Norwegian film upon which this 2002 American film is based. Stellan Skarsgrd was the detective in the Norwegian film and I thought it to be an excellent film and it was the main reason I wanted to see the American version.

For the Blu-Ray extras we have our fair share, we even have some commentary from the commentary elusive Christopher Nolan, two commentary tracks, a mini documentary on the actual medical condition of insomnia, but personally we have a gold mine feature of Nolan and Pacino discussing not only the film, but performances and film-making as well.",1419897600,,782,5.1015625

Detective Will Dormer, a Los Angeles Police Department legend who temporarily escapes an internal affairs investigation that may ruin his career by traveling to Nightmute, Alaska, the remote site of a murder that has the local authorities flummoxed. Along with his partner, Hap Eckhart, and the small town's wide-eyed rookie investigator, Ellie Burr, the exhausted Dormer probes the brutal slaying of a teenage girl who was rumored to have a secret lover. A clever ruse quickly lures the killer into a police trap, but the suspect escapes and a tragic accident at the scene leaves Dormer at the mercy of the murderer, a pulp crime novelist named Walter Finch. As Finch plays a dangerous game of extortion with Dormer, the detective's mental health deteriorates rapidly from guilt over his complicity in a crime and sleep deprivation compounded by the lack of darkness in the land of the midnight sun. Meanwhile, the bright and dogged Ellie continues putting the pieces of a complex puzzle together despite Dormer's skillful attempts to lead the investigation toward the right suspect, but away from his own malfeasance.

Insomnia proves once again why Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors we have today. It was well-made,well-written,stylish and truly enigmatic that does not lack tension,drama and suspense. It was a thriller whose style, structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story, you cannot separate them. It was interesting from beginning to end especially with Al Pacino,who delivers one of the best performances,as the insomniac police detective who makes the picture interesting. He was outstanding that we are able to sympathize with the moral complexities of his character. Aside from him,special mention also goes to Williams as the child murders who was excellent with his scenes with Pacino and Hillary Swank,who was never left behind with the great acting abilities of his co-stars. This is an great excellent film that one should never miss.",1419638400,,2083,5.178041543026707

I have read articles that stated One Hour Photo was creepy and it was. However, in the movie Insomnia Robin Williams' character is real good at playing mind games with a detective that is trying to solve a murder; mind games verses photos.

Williams plays the extraordinary villain in this cat and mouse game, taking place in a beautiful land where the sun never sets. MUCH better than the European film of the same name on which it was based, and how often does an Americanization of an existing foreign film top its original?

1737926,4,B00006AGHD,"A good detective story gone haywire because the camera never leaves Pacino.  The cast is excellent but everyone is overshadowed by Al Pacino.  There are no memorable lines from any supporting character.  If Pacino's character doesn't say or do it . . . it doesn't get said or done.  His character is bedeviled by the unraveling of his career and a large puncture in his well developed ego.  In other words, we are seeing an excellent detective in great stress, out of control mostly, while all the other characters around him (including the bad guy - Robin Williams) are fully in control of themselves and their situations.  That's part of what makes Pacino's role so ""loud"" against the others.  The movie was constructed like an Ali fight.  All the air in the room is consumed by the central character and the central character needs a long vacation.",1408233600,,851,4.741496598639456

1737947,2,B00006AGHD,"The film would have been stronger, I think, if the 'pedophilia' theme had been interwoven between the main characters, as males so that the disease insomnia wouldn't be tacked on for style and would actually mean something. That is, if it would have been allowed to complex an otherwise pedestrian emote story about that most hackneyed of moralisms, the 'purity' of women; if real male sexuality had been allowed.

Instead what we get is an empty style movie based on, as I said, a popular liberal moralism, with other minor truisms sprinkled on top. Good cop fights 'evil'. 17 year old raped and murdered. Generic psycho ticks. Writers are weirdos. Platitudinized Jungian introversion/extroversion, yet again. 'Quiet' men are all really weirdos, stalkers, sissies, rapists, murders just waiting to snap. That's why they end up 'writing', and there's that old Freudian bourgeois truism, much loved by our liberal Academy for nearly a century, about sublimation and the reality-principle, and I can probably go on a few more lines about all the recalcitrant matter.

Now that I think about it, Insomnia could be the high-noon of all these things, which are in a way still remotely related to the contemporary male sex. Pachino after all does play the brave, loquacious, shoot'em up American man that walks into town and does his thing. To ask again, is that 'thing' interrupted? I may have to watch again.",1396483200,,1404,5.021459227467811

There are two main problems with this version: 1) they made a complete hash of the original plot and 2) the performances are awful.

Translating the movie to the US in Alaska is not the only reason they butchered the story. That can be done well, as Netflix'x House of Cards proves. In that series the writers did a wonderful job moving a story between alien political systems and practice, and changing very British personalities into very different Americans. Insomnia lost the entire story. The original film is a fish out of water film (Swedish cop goes to Norway) and proceeds to carry his faults with him, finding new ways to screw up. The American film is an uninteresting faux detective story that makes no sense.

DeNiro character is indifferent. Pacino acts as though he's stoned out his mind. Williams (one of my favorite actors) is over the top bizarre, but not the wonderful sort of bizarre he does in Fisher King.",1388620800,,1033,4.633879781420765

Since I have been for 19 years an investigator who has written a book PURSUIT OF EXHIBIT 35 in the OJ Simpson Murder Trial and its Hidden Secrets, and a documentary SERPENTS RISING: An Independent Investigation of the OJ Simpson Murder Trial, I guess I've become jaundiced at viewing predictable conclusions.

1737961,5,B00006AGHD,"Al Pacino and Martin Donovan play LAPD detectives headed very north to help out an old friend.  The small town Nightmute, Alaska, has just lost one of it's young citizens to a violent killer and the locals could use some help catching the guy.  But that's not all as Pacino's character is quite possibly dodging an internal affairs investigation back home, one that is complicated when his partner states his intention to testify to protect his family.  During a subsequent chase through the Alaskain wilderness, Pacino accidentally shoots and kills his partner and, knowing that the circumstances will cause everyone to doubt him, blames it on the killer.  Hillary Swank plays a local cop assigned to the case to make sure everything is in order when the killer's caught and brought to trial and Robin Williams plays the killer, who saw everything that happened out in the woods.  Williams proceeds to taunt Pacino with this information, seeking to beat a murder charge.  This is a thrilling film with a top-notch catch.  Despite his short stint on the screen, Donovan has great chemistry with Pacino.  The two aren't life partners or anything, but when it comes to their jobs, they feel they can count on each other...at least before they got to Alaska.  It's cool to see Robin Williams playing an antagonist once in a while and he certainly makes the most of his role.  Hillary Swank fits in perfectly as the rookie cop in a small, middle-of-nowhere town who idolizes Pacino (who wouldn't) and only seeks to do right by him.  Again, this is a thrilling film and it's worth adding to your collection.  It doesn't matter what actors and actress in Hollywood you like...chances are at least one of them is in this film.

1737985,4,B00006AGHD,"Out of all the movies Christopher Nolan has directed, ""Insomnia"" is probably the most... normal. No dream technology, no superheroes, no magical Tesla devices.

No, ""Insomnia"" is pretty much a cop thriller about hunting down a murderer. But it's much deeper and more layered than it sounds -- it's a tragic, haunting story of a good cop who begins sliding inexorably down, until he ends up collaborating with a murderer. And in true Nolan style, it's murky and slightly disorienting.

LAPD detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are sent to the remote town of Nightmute, up in Alaska, to investigate the shocking death of a teenage girl. There's some tension between the detectives because Dormer is under investigation by Internal Affairs, and Eckhart is going to testify against him.

And since Nightmute is in the Arctic Circle, the sun never sets in summer. Unable to sleep, Dormer becomes increasingly disoriented -- until he accidentally shoots Eckhart while chasing the murderer.

Knowing that no one would believe it was an accident, Dormer desperately hides the evidence of his crime. But there was one witness to the shooting -- the murderer, mystery writer Walter Finch (Robin Williams). Finch is only willing to keep silent if Dormer frames the dead girl's boyfriend, and lets him go free.

Based on a Norwegian film of the same name, ""Insomnia"" is essentially a study of guilt. It's never entirely clear whether Dormer's insomnia is caused by the daylight (symbolic light of truth?) or his own guilty conscience, but the events of the movie are a tragic portrait of a fundamentally good man degenerating before our eyes.

And it's one of the best roles that Al Pacino has done in years -- he depicts Dormer as a man who desperately wants to do the right thing, but is twisted into doing the WRONG thing out of his own fear. And Nolan leaves you wondering if, on some subconscious level, he did want to shoot his partner for betraying him.

And if Dormer is in the middle of the moral spectrum, then Finch and Ellie Burr are on the two extremes. I normally cannot stand Robin Williams, but he gives a surprisingly good performance as a genial yet ice-cold murderer who wants to drag Dormer down with him. And Hilary Swank is excellent as a pure-hearted young cop who is investigating Eckhart's murder.

As for Nolan, he cloaks the movie in a sense of stillness and a pale, strange daylight that never goes away, and he builds up a slow-burning sense of suspense right to the subdued ending. This makes it all the more shocking when Dormer's sleeplessness catches up to him, causing him to act recklessly and even hallucinate -- suddenly the world seems jagged and chaotic for a few minutes, before snapping back to normal.

In fact, the movie is at its weakest when it focuses just on police procedural stuff, instead of following Dormer's descent. Even if those scenes are essential to the plot, Nolan cannot make that interesting.

While not exactly what people expect from Christopher Nolan, ""Insomnia"" is a beautifully tragic little movie, with amazing acting and exquisite direction.",1365465600,,3129,4.886792452830188

1737987,5,B00006AGHD,"SPOILERS:

A great thriller from Christopher Nolan, ""Insomnia"" focuses on a corrupt police officer Will Dormer(Al Pacino) called in to assist pursuing a killer (Robin Williams)in a small Alaska town. When Dormer shoots his partner Hap (Martin Donovan) by accident during the pursuit, he frantically tries to cover it up as a younger, local police officer (Hilary Swank)begins to piece together what happened. Dormer isn't really sure after being sleep deprived if he did it by accident or on purpose.

END OF SPOILERS:

Although ""Insomnia"" wasn't written by Nolan (like most of his films), it fits the type of morally complex thrillers that Nolan has directed since the beginning of his career. Al Pacino gives a great performance as Dormer the L.A. cop troubled by what he's done and what waits him back home. Williams gives a chilling performance in what amounts to a supporting role in the film. The film was adapted from a script written by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjaer and the American version keeps what worked so well in the original 1997 film but also allows Nolan and Pacino to bring their own personalities to the project.

The Blu-ray transfer looks exceptionally good with nice detail, depth and accurate colors. There are some minor problems with edge enhancement and ringing that crop up from time to time but, on the whole, this is an extremely satisfying presentation of the film.

The audio is a stand out as well with a strong 5.1 DTS mix. The long silences, atmospheric effects, dialogue and  David Julyan's outstanding moody score all benefit from the presentation here.

There are also subtitles English,French, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Spanish, Portuguese and German.

We get a terrific commentary track from the director with an unusual presentation on Blu-ray which I don't want to spoil particularly if you're a fan of Nolan's work.

We also get scene specific commentary from Swank and the writer of the American version of the film Hilary Seitz along with Wally Pfister (who the film), the film editor and production designer. Each provides some unique and intersting comments that nicely compliment the film. This scene specific commentary runs just under 45 minutes.

We also get four featurettes on the production of the film that, while short, are informative but they are presented in SD (and are ported over from the DVD).

There's also a single deleted scene and a stills gallery presented in HD.

""Insomnia"" is an exceptional thriller with a strong performances by Pacino and Williams, as well as, terrific direction by Nolan.

Highly recommended.",1364947200,,2596,5.08

1737989,4,B00006AGHD,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Insomnia"" Starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams. It was a police movie, sort of, but the main policeman was Al Pacino, a Los Angeles homicide detective on leave and investigating a murder case in small-town Alaska. The real star of the movie was Alaska. Man, that's a beautiful state and the scenery was excellent! In any case, a young woman was murdered and Pacino was on the perplexing case and was getting nowhere fast. Ultimately, he found a suspect, Robin Williams, and in the chase ended up shooting and killing his own partner. The shooting was not intentional, of course, and he tried to cover it up. Big mistake. The killer suspect had witnessed him doing it and used the info as leverage to keep his own unintentional murder out of the spotlight. Let's just say that the case gets somewhat complicated. Much more complicated than this. Too complicated, in my opinion. It becomes surrealistic. Oh, and the whole matter was further complicated by the high summer season with bright sunlight around the clock and a debilitating case of insomnia suffered by a dreary Pacino. Well, personally, I've been in Fairbanks, Alaska, during the all-day season and I think the movie greatly exaggerated the effects.

The acting was quite good by the entire cast, but Pacino stood out. No surprise there. Williams did a good job, but paled next to Pacino, unfortunately. The directing and filming was first rate. I was not overly impressed with quality of the story. I'd rank it as an excellent movie and well worth watching, but it wasn't quite up there with the best.

Even in the most early stages of his career, it's easy to see his genius, that's why so many big stars wanted to work with him right away. Insomnia is the least well known of all his films and does lack some of the things that have become Nolan's trademark, but it's still a terrific film. The story follows two L.A. Detectives sent to a remote part of Alaska, where the sun doesn't set for six months and then doesn't rise for six months. They're there to solve a brutal and calculated murder, but circumstances lead them down a different path. Despite being one of the best Hollywood has to offer, I haven't really been much of a Pacino fan. To me, it seemed as though he had lost something with age, his performance in Insomnia proved me wrong. Terrific is not the word for what Al Pacino was and he's not the only genius Nolan surrounded himself with. This film is incredibly well written and being the perfectionist that he is, Nolan got only the best people to star in it. It's not the kind of Nolan film, we've been spoiled with over the past 10 years, but Insomnia is a great story, with an unbelievable cast and in my opinion is a must see.",1361491200,,1243,4.456140350877193

1738007,4,B00006AGHD,"Insomnia is a bit different from what Christopher Nolan is known for, but it's still another fantastic notch on his belt. I stated in my review of The Prestige that, that movie was possibly his weakest, and I felt that way until revisiting this film. I think Insomnia is his weakest entry overall, but it was still a fantastic thriller. Calling any of Nolan's film weaker than their counterparts doesn't quite mean the same as it would for many other filmmakers, because I like all of his films that I've seen. First of all, the pacing is surprisingly well done. His films tend to run two hours plus, but this one was just under two hours. That was great because it had a quicker pace that captured the feeling of trying to solve a murder case in the first few days (any First 48 fans out there?). This movie was a remake apparently, I wasn't aware of that until doing some research. It's a remake of a 1997 Erik Skjoldbjrg movie by the same name. I cannot judge whether or not it does the original justice, but I can say that it is worth a watch.

Al Pacino did a great, if not subdued, job as a conflicted veteran LAPD officer who recently came under scrutiny for some questionable acts he and his partner committed while on the job. What's new, it's the LAPD? Opposite of Pacino was Robin Williams as a creepy local novelist, and my was he great. Between this and One Hour Photo, I've seen a sinister side of Williams that I'd love to see more, and more of in the future. Hilary Swank rounds out the leads as an unexperienced, and eager, local officer assisting Pacino's character, Dormer, on this investigation. She's always reliable, and hardly ever outshines her co-stars. Same goes for her in this film. Aside from the effective leads, another aid to this film in setting the tone of a classic suspense novel or film was the snowy, cold, lonely Alaskan setting. Alaska, when used correctly, can be an amazingly chilling (no pun intended) setting for any bleak, mysterious, etc story. Insomnia is not as dark as what one would have grown accustomed to by Nolan's standards (literally because the sun never sets in Alaska), but because of the somber tone, it's still a dark story.

The story is also pretty complex. It's not difficult to follow by any means, but the way that events unfold increasingly complicate things for our lead character, until that faithful day in all suspense thrillers where things come to a head and then pop, like a figurative pimple. It was really interesting to see Pacino's character progress through one distressing situation after another, all while battling his own demons from his past. Again though, the actors are what really drive this thriller home. Not to beat a dead horse, but Robin Williams is quite disturbing, and Hilary Swank also did quite well. The music did not stand out as much as the scores in Nolan's films usually do. This was before Nolan and Zimmer hooked up, so that's understandable. Overall, I liked it a lot. It hasn't become a classic in its genre, but it's still a great crime story and case study. It's smartly crafted, and definitely worth everyone's time.",1344816000,2,3125,4.6389891696750905

Compared to Memento, Inception, The Prestige, Batman Begins & The Dark Knight, I feel this movie is not as great but still has a lot of suspense, great acting, but a few bad writing/transition spots.

Pacino's lack of sleep and how it's portrayed is amazing and you feel like you're experiencing the side effects of a sleep-deprived person alongside Pacino's Dormer character.",1339027200,,649,4.828828828828829

It's more who is going to find out, what are going to be the consequences, and how are the various characters going to get themselves out of the fine mess they've gotten into.

Al Pacino play Detective Will Dormer, invited to a small town in northern Alaska to help with a murder and also to get him out of LA, where an Internal Affairs investigation is cooking. His partner Hap is with him, and explains that he is going to have to make a deal with IA to save his own skin and protect his family. He says Dormer won't be dragged into the mess, but Dormer insists he will be. (We find out later why.)

Dormer and Hap are met by an attractive young female local detective who is to work with them. She's smart, and she idolizes Dormer. She did her case study at the academy on one of his most famous cases. The local police chief is a friend of Dormer's, and it was undoubtedly he who asked for Dormer to come and assist.

The case is the brutal murder of an 18-yea-old girl whose body was found naked in the garbage dump. Dormer immediately notices some unusual features about the body, and finds some useful evidence at the girl's home. (Nah, not going to tell you what.) He and the local cops interview the girl's boyfriend, but Dormer is convinced he was not the killer. (Not going to tell you why, either.)

The primary suspect turns out to be a mystery writer who lives about 15 miles away (Robin Williams) who has befriended the girl because she wanted to be a writer, and because she needed someone to talk to. He's very smooth, this one; after all he's a writer of murder mysteries, and knows how police operate.

The title refers to the fact that it is high summer, and the sun basically never goes down. Dormer can't sleep, and he is tormented by, among other things, phone calls from the writer in the wee small hours of the morning because he can't sleep either. Eventually, Dormer is so in need of sleep that he's going really nuts. Practically gets himself killed falling asleep while driving, and eventually begins having hallucinations. He's determined to crack the case before he cracks up, and he does. In a way.

In fact, this is the glitch in his fimography; a list of impressive feats that circle around an impressive re-imagining of Batman and some intriguing sci-fi ventures.  `Insomnia' has some superb moments, and facets of this film are truly strong, but overall there is a feeling of apathy that surrounds my concluding sentiments on the film itself.

The idea here (of a LA cop lost in Alaskan daylight as he searches for a killer) has potential, and Nolan tries to uncover that potential, but it becomes too formulaic and predictable for its own good.  Instead of feeling lived in and exciting, most of the obvious `tricks' feel stagy and fake.  Swank proves that she cannot perform effectively without a gimmick, delivering a forgettable performance.  Pacino reigns in his usual theatrics, but he is less convincing than he needed to be.  Robin Williams gets under the skin with ease, and he festers.  He truly is the best thing about this film and definitely proves that he has more talent than many want to admit (he pigeonholes himself).

I love Nolan (not as much as some, but far more than others).  He has a gift of imagery and he can capture moods with ease.  He does some good atmospheric work here (capturing unease in bright sunlight is hard to do), but at the end of the day, `Insomnia' is a little too mundane to make the desired impact.

Meaning they must be good actors for me to overcome my completely prejudiced views of their whole body of work.

Anyway, in no way shape or form is this anywhere near as great as Inception, Memento or Following which both contain the same sort of themes of playing with time and people's perceptions of time as well as using the location as really a major part of the film. Throw in the whole Nolan obsession with the human mind and that's where Insomnia is at. Problem is it's at its base level this is still a murder mystery of which way too much gets revealed at the start when Al Pacino shoots his fellow cop accidentally on purpose early in the movie. Don't worry it's not a spoiler as the audience sees and knows this on screen very early in the flick.

1738030,4,B00006AGHD,"Insomnia was Christopher Nolan's next film after Memento. He is moving up the ladder to the next level, with big name actors--Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hillary Swank. Not quite up to block buster status with The Dark Knight or Inception, but he is a rising star. Insomnia was a remake of the 1997 Insomnia by Norwegian director Erik Skjoldbjrg.

Instead of Norway, the remake is set in Alaska, so far North that the sun doesn't set for months. This wrecks havoc on the sleep cycles of Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino), an LA cop who arrives to help with the investigation of the murder of a young woman. Besides the Midnight Sun, there is something else troubling the detective's sleep. Like MacBeth, he thinks that ""sleep should knit the raveled sleeve of care"" but sleep is no more. MacBeth, and Dormer, have murdered sleep. Dormer is under investigation by Internal Affairs for possibly fabricating evidence. As he tries to cover his tracks, he gets in deeper trouble.

Rookie Detective Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank) looks up to Dormer, who she has studied in Detective School. She quotes from his text books, and is anxious to learn what she can from the man himself:

-----------------------
Dormer: You shouldn't knock misdemeanors.
Det. Ellie Burr: Oh, but it's small stuff. It gets so boring.
Dormer: It's all about small stuff. You know, small lies, small mistakes. People give themselves away, same in misdemeanors as they do on murder cases. It's just human nature. Aren't you gonna write that down?
====================

When this situation arrives in a film there is an interesting sub text, and that is that the young actor is playing a character who is learning from the more experienced character, and at the same time taking an acting class. This happened in The Color of Money where Tom Cruise played a pool hustler being schooled by Fast Eddie, played by Paul Newman. Al Pacino takes Swank to school, and really gives an amazing performance. Robin Williams also gets a chance to stretch his acting chops playing the enigmatic suspect, Finch. Swank is a quick learner, and her performance is solid.

-----------------------
Dormer: We better find out where this came from.
Det. Ellie Burr: I tried. Mrs. Connell doesn't know, her friends didn't know.
Dormer: Have you tried the jewelry stores? Small things, remember? The second you're about to dismiss something, think about it. Look at it again.
Det. Ellie Burr: Want me to write that down?
Dormer: No, I'll remember it.
====================

Director Christopher Nolan is also going to film school, but he is a quick learner, too. This film presented some interesting challenges. First and foremost, how do you depict insomnia without providing a cure for insomnia? Without putting the audience to sleep? The far North setting was beautiful, but all that white snow could be monotonous. Scenes in the fog were good at creating an atmosphere where the lines between right and wrong were blurred, but it could also lull you into a trance. The film was a murder mystery, but it was less concerned with finding who did it then it was with exploring moral dilemmas. The ways in which the detective and the killer were similar. If you do something wrong for the right reasons, does that make it OK? What happens once you cross that line...

-----------------------
Dormer: This guy crossed the line and didn't even blink.
====================

I don't see you blinking either, Detective. Maura Tierney plays the Detective's landlady, Rachel Clement. She has an interesting take on moral dilemmas, too.

-----------------------
Rachel Clement: I can't judge. There are two kinds of people in Alaska: those who were born here and those who come here to escape something. I wasn't born here.
====================

I wish this character could have been developed a little more. Just what it was she was escaping was never resolved.

The Bottom Line is that Insomnia is a solid effort by Christopher Nolan on his way to bigger and better things. I would preferr to just watch the original--besides I heard that it was darker, and some of the changes kind of watered it down. In the original his interrogation techniques are much harsher, and instead of firing his gun in a dead dog to fabricate some evidence, he kills a dog. Great performances by Swank, Pacino, and Williams, in a setting that makes a good metaphor for the grey area between wake and sleep, and right and wrong. Like Detective Ellie Burr we are left with a question:

Det. Ellie Burr: Why?
Dormer: Don't lose your way.

When I first saw the trailer for this some years ago, I thought it would turn into something along the lines of a cold and calculated murder mystery, a genre I'm sure Nolan would excel at if he took another shot at making one (a la Memento). Instead, I was presented with a complex character drama in addition to a back and forth trade-off of psychological mind games between the most unlikely duo I would ever have thought possible. Al Pacino is a given with his extensive track record and undeniable screen presence. His tact, detail to the little things, and natural vigor has always made him a great actor to watch on screen. But my biggest surprise was in Robin Williams. I've not seen his work in One Hour Photo, but his character in this film is definitely the darkest and most poignantly disturbing role I've seen him do to date. At times he's like a ticking time-bomb of undistilled rage and mounting frustration just waiting to explode. And yet, for a very good majority of his screen time he displays an almost creepy sense of control that manages to keep him aloof just when you think it's over. His character's natural ability of observation and the twisted kind of logic he possesses make for a great game of cat and mouse that keeps you suspended till the very end. The parallels between their personalities, the circumstances that brought them together, and the raw tension that propels them both to the point of breaking are all part of another finely-woven web that has a little bit of everything I like in a detective story. And while in somewhat of a limited role, Hilary Swank provides for a great sense of conscience and perspective in opposition to the insomniac behaviors of both Pacino and Williams' characters. I was surprised at how brisk the movie progressed having only seen it for the first time as of this review. It's a dark and very well-written piece of psychological thriller with just the right balance of drama and emotion.

Video - 4.5

As mentioned above, this BD is actually my first-ever viewing of the film. And while I don't have any theatrical or DVD experiences in mind for comparison, I still have to say the film looks wonderful. Wally Pfister's photography gets an excellent transfer, with bold, bold colors being the highlight of the video. From the very beginning of the movie when Pacino's character is flying over the mountains of Alaska (or wherever they filmed in British Columbia), we get a crystal clear image full of depth and detail. The aforementioned colors look especially lush throughout the countryside showcasing an array of greens, browns, and grays for that very laid-back Alaskan outdoorsy look. Black levels are deep and inky, while contrast is proportioned perfectly to give certain scenes ample dramatic and photographic effect. Skin tones remain very natural exposing a good deal of facial features from the wrinkles of a worn-down Pacino to the eerie smile on Williams' face when we get that side shot of him on the ferry. Overall image detail maintains a faithful and accurate level of sharpness for a lot of the indoor settings and is marred by little bit of edge enhancement, but isn't too distracting. My only gripe for an otherwise perfect picture is the period of frame-shaking during the funeral scene, but everything else is relatively flawless.

Audio - 4.5

Much like the video, I found the audio to be excellent as well. While a good majority of the film is dialogue, what few instances there are of surround usage via background noise, ambient town activity, running water, shuffling footsteps, or creaking wood, do their fair share of creating a deceptively buoyant DTS-HD track. Separation of said noises does a great job panning across the screen just as you'd see/hear them from the perspective of the camera. Directionality doesn't get a whole lot of work, but does so admirably when given the opportunity. A lot of it is done mainly through the sounds of nature and in combination with a tense, and sometimes haunting, score by David Julyan. But perhaps my favorite element, though to no surprise considering its rudimentary requirement, is the dialogue. Pacino, in conjunction to his unique acting, also has that very distinct raspy voice, which I have to say couldn't sound more perfect, especially for this type of movie. Meanwhile, Williams with a much more low-key performance, voice-wise, sounds equally impressive be it on screen or over the phone (again, it's creepy to hear him be.. so creepy). And for as good as the track sounds, the one detractor would have to be the LFEs. They're not bad, by any means, but for the limitations of what the movie is, their just isn't a whole lot of instances where strong bass is required outside of music and the occasional dramatic boom effect for the insomnia kicking in.

Extras - 4.0

There actually isn't a big abundance of production features aside from the set design and cinematography pieces, but they're informative enough about a lot of the technical side of things: locations chosen, things they had to build for said locations, types of filming techniques used to counteract elements of nature, and so on. There's also a quaint face-to-face conversation between Nolan and Pacino where Pacino basically gives pointers and little lessons he learned throughout his years of acting to Nolan, who seems very interested in the veteran's words. However, the real meat lies in the very informative commentaries: one by Nolan for the film itself and then one mishmash of selected scenes/commentaries by Hilary Swank and other members of the production crew. By far amongst the more interestingly arranged commentaries I've seen to date, Nolan gives insight for the entire project by going in the order of shooting, rather than the order of editing. What the production features lack in depth, Nolan more than makes up for it by explaining various aspects such as shooting, writing, casting, editing, and a wealth of other very informative tidbits relevant to the film. The scene-specific commentaries add some extra depth and perspective, mostly from a writing and shooting point, but are worth giving a listen to as well. Personally, though, I would've loved to have see a longer, more candid interview with Williams and hear the kinds of things he did to prepare for the role, as well as what he thought of his character, etc.

Overall - 4.5

I have to admit, as widely known as he is for his more mainstream titles (like The Prestige, Batman, and Inception), I have to say I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed Insomnia. It's an excellent combination of the calculated thriller aspects most people know him for, but also for, in my opinion, an equally excellent amount of character and psychological elements. For what handful of movies I've seen him in (still need to catch up on his classics), I never get tired of Al Pacino. And for always being the funny guy, I'm shocked at how good of a performance Robin Williams provided as well. With near-reference A/V quality and a great set of extras heralded by a very hearty Nolan commentary, Insomnia comes highly recommended.",1283817600,3,7138,4.8586688578471655
1738032,5,B00006AGHD,"I bought this movie on blu ray thinking it was new only to realize I had seen it many years ago. As you know, you think you remember the movie but you forgot all the important little things. I enjoyed it as much as the first time I saw it. The beauty of the alaskan prarie, makes me want to go there.",1282348800,,300,3.8548387096774195
1738033,2,B00006AGHD,"This movie was very slow moving, the plot was okay if you could stay awake. However this proved to be too much for me. I managed to fall asleep two times while trying to watch it on two different occasions. The third time was the charm, I did manage to stay awake. For me it wasn't worth it, love Robin Williams and Al Pacino but even that didn't really save the movie in my eyes. All that being said it did have an interesting twist at the end.",1280188800,,445,4.068181818181818
1738043,5,B00006AGHD,"This movie is great, as one of Al Pacinos last great memorable films, other than the recruit which was enh, ok, this was a landmark film. As detective dormer he and his partner as many know go to Alaska where for the most part its very dark(during the six months of spring/summer) to go on a dark journey through lies and deception, and basically what is good and what is evil? Robin Williams does a stellar job as usual being the nasty perhaps psycho on the island, named Brody, a local book writer. When he is accused of killing a young admirer of his book, a young teen age girl, this start to spin out of control. Also as Al Pacino's partner gets gunned down there is also a very dark secret behind it as well. So most people have probably seen this film i can't really spoil it, but i will desist anyway. Its not really worth getting on Blu-Ray, i've had the original for many years and it suits me fine. There are no explosions, no car chases, no CGI, just a good psychological thriller from beginning to end that will keep you on the edge of your seat. So just get the DVD, or rent it, the blu ray doesnt nothing for it.",1279152000,,1127,4.222222222222222
1738044,4,B00006AGHD,"While this isn't the sort of thriller which will keep you on the edge or your seat, it will keep your interest throughout. Nolan does a great job directing, as usual, and it has a very talented cast, lead by Al Pacino, Hilary Swank, and Robin Williams. Williams does a very good job in a rare dramatic and creepy part. There's no element of his more well-known comedic side here at all. With a few well-placed twists, the movie will keep you guessing.

LA detective Dormer (Pacino) is sent with his partner Eckhart to a small town in Alaska, in part to get away from an evolving investigation into their department and, more officially, to help with a homicide investigation. The little town of Nightmute isn't used to homicides, so when Dormer arrives to help, young officer Burr (Swank), who looks up to Dormer, is thankful for his help. None of the local officers are aware of the LA internal affairs investigation, but it's the main thing on the minds of Eckhart, who has decided he will testify, and Dormer, who is afraid of being ruined because of his action in a previous homicide case. Dormer is unable to sleep - partly because of the constant Alaskan sunlight and partly due to feelings of guilt - and this visibly wears on him. Before long Dormer identifies and lcoates the girl's killer, Finch, a police mystery writer, but things are far from over. Finch recognizes Dormer's weakened condition and has something on him. When Finch hatches a plan that would help them both get off free, Dormer has to choose either to play along or to try to outsmart him. Can he get justice for the murdered girl without implicating himself in other matters?

The Alaskan scenery throughout the movie is both picturesque and somehow oppressive. Its stark nature adds to the sense of disorientation from Dormer's insomnia. The combination of beauty and eeriness reminded me of ""Twin Peaks"", though it has none of that TV show's quirkiness. Alaska looks like it would be a nice place to visit... but I can easily imagine how the perpetual daylight some months and perpetual darkness other months would take its toll.

With good acting, evocative scenery, and a simple but well-devised plot, I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a quality thriller. So far Christopher Nolan hasn't disappointed.",1264809600,,2301,4.790931989924434
1738045,5,B00006AGHD,"I hadn't seen this movie before I bought it, but being a big fan of Christopher Nolan, I was excited to see it. It definitely lived up to my expectations and if you like Nolan, I definitely recommend buying it.",1259452800,,210,4.275
1738046,4,B00006AGHD,"I should say that the fact that the sun doesn't set for months becomes a major theme in the film, coupled with the question of just what is the behavior that a good cop will expect of him-or herself. Al Pacino gives a bravura performance as the cop who suffers from insomnia due to the sun and whose actions in the past and present lead him to question his self-conception as a good cop. He is ably abetted by Swank and Williams, with the supporting roles being filled well. There is some action, some talk, some scenery, and no sleep. All in all, an above average effort to portray The Detective and The Criminal. Good watching.",1257552000,,629,4.431034482758621
1738047,4,B00006AGHD,"Insomnia is oftentimes engaging, sharply photographed, and nicely acted despite its genre conventions. It reminds one of the old film-noir movies, and even has a trace of Hitchcock in the subtle way most of the movie proceeds with its psychological-thriller concepts (the sense of quiet creepiness reminds one of Shadow of a Doubt.) Although the simplistic plot concerning a web of lies and murder wrecking psychological sleep deprivation on a homicide detective that is working to find a killer in a Alaskan town may not do much to advance this genre, the film is quite watchable. It is captivating formulism.

In part this is due to the film's leads (Al Pacino and Hilary Swank) that are played impeccably, and the real surprise of the main cast is Robin Williams. Giving a very understated and nuanced performance as the killer, Williams reminds one of the low-key villains that have a sense of soft-spoken eeriness to them and crooked logic that makes their manner oftentimes just as scary as a raving lunatic due to them feeling like your average, kind next door neighbors. The acting also complements the mood of the film, as well.

Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film is shot much different than the dark shadows of those noir pictures. This film invokes its location of the 24-hour sunlight of Alaska with a lot of grays, blues, and well, sunlight. Nolan tells the story with both an atmospheric visual flair, and also shows considerable grasp at tension, even if the audience can guess what will happen. As Nolan may keep things rote, screenwriter Hillary Seitz and he also keep the elements rather grounded with both a sense of drama, apt monologues, and astute dialogue. There is even a quite nail-biting scene that has Pacino pursuing Williams on water logs, only for things to turn rather wet.

If Insomnia falters it is because the plot is only intricate in terms of the central dilemma, and not in terms of its development. Thematically, the elements are rather obvious in the morals that the film examines and at times it is also very Hollywood in regards to its stance on these beliefs. The film is almost too bittersweet in its logic, and since it ends on a moral note this also seems so obvious and predetermined that it comes without surprise or a sense of subversion; this is especially true in the climax.

In the end, Insomnia does nothing to reinvent the wheel, or even add anything to it. Rather, it just spins it well enough that it is both sincere and skilled enough about what it sets out to do. A fine watch, indeed.

1738048,5,B00006AGHD,"I know alot of you out there will disagree with me, but 2002 was probably Robin Williams's best year for movies. Mind you I say this without having watched ""Death To Smootchy"" yet. However, this, and ""One Hour Photo"" are definitely his finest hours. This is a complex movie, and I have to thank my wife for suggesting we go see this on our 1st anniversary. It's about a murder in Alaska that the locals can't seem to solve, and they bring in a legendary police officer from Los Angeles played equally good by Al Pacino. However, Pacino's character isn't quite ready for the wilds of Alaska...especially during the summer when the sun never sets, and lack of sleep is an understatement. Then there comes the chase in the fog where Pacino accidently shoots his partner....or does he? There's alot more riding on this than the murder mystery itself, and it plays out where Williams and Pacino play the game of cat and mouse. Apparently Williams had done some research into Pacino's past, and he promises to keep quiet if Pacino keeps quiet about Williams little murder. There's a underlying twist here, and Pacino's admirer played by Hillary Swank comes to the same conclusion, and just in time when Pacino decides he doesn't want to keep quiet anymore, and then comes the fight scenes between Williams and Pacino, and brother let me tell you it was one that has stuck in my mind for the last 7 years. In the end however, it was hard to tell if justice was served as both Pacino and Williams characters end up dying by the others hand. I feel that this was one of the overlooked movies of 2002, and so I want to put this here to remind people that Robin Williams can act in suspense/thrillers too. He's funny, but don't judge this, or ""One Hour Photo"", or for that matter ""The Final Cut"" before giving it a chance. He did good in all 3 movies.",1250553600,,1840,4.5119760479041915

1738050,5,B00006AGHD,"INSOMNIA is a fantastic thriller, full of twists, turns, and arctic-cold atmosphere. Al Pacino (The Godfather 1 and 2, Scarface, Heat, etc.) is LA homicide detective Will Dormer, sent to Nightmute, Alaska to investigate a murder. Will has a lot of professional / personal baggage that complicates matters, causing him to hide his own secrets while trying to solve the crime. Add to this the fact that he's arrived in northern Alaska during it's season of perpetual daylight, and he's got major sleeping problems as well! Between the murder case, the eternal daylight, and Will's own conscience, he quickly becomes a mess! It's amazing that he can still function at all, let alone, well. Hilary Swank (The Gift, 11:14) is a young officer who assists Dormer, only to find her own loyalties and sense of justice challenged. Robin Williams (One Hour Photo, The Night Listener) plays a seemingly mild-mannered sociopath whose one frantic desire is to cover / save his own a$$! INSOMNIA succeeds at building tension while showing Will Dormer's mental disintegration. A classic crime drama w/ something extra. Loaded w/ memorable scenes like the chase-in-the-fog, chase-across-the-floating-logs, and invisible-oncoming-truck sequences, INSOMNIA holds up well after many repeat viewings. Highly recommended...  P.S.- Watch for both Katherine Isabelle and Emily Perkins from the GINGER SNAPS movies, as the victim's best friend and the eulogizer at her funeral respectively...",1239321600,,1467,5.462555066079295

The use of the beautiful Alaskan scenery and contrasting man made structures, trash, and litter is amazing.  Pacino gives his usual strong performance and we've come to expect the same from Miss Swank.  Robin Williams again proves that comedians are more at home in a dramatic role than many serious actors in a comedy.

1738052,4,B00006AGHD,"Al Pacino's acting once again is a highlight of a film he's in. He has the capacity to dominate a film with his presence. In this re-make of the Norwegian film, Pacino is excellent as a good-yet-tainted policeman who starts to unravel after not sleeping for four or five days. The Alaskan summer, with light 24 hours of day, can do that to visitors

Robin Williams, meanwhile, plays a killer. It's funny how comedians can do so well playing dramatic roles and Williams is a prime example. He's especially good at creepy nut-cases (See ""One Hour Photo"") Williams doesn't enter the movie until about halfway through and he's fascinating in a low-key role (until the end).

For a modern-day crime film, this doesn't have a lot of action but that's fine if the acting is this good and the story involving. Here, the acting is better than the story. Kudos to Hillary Swank, too, for her performance as the cop.

Utilizing his adept understanding of the human psyche, he creates a film that is both haunting and suspenseful. Though it may not keep you lying awake at night, Insomnia will surely keep you on the edge of your seat.

When Detective Will Dormer and his partner, Hap Eckhart are asked to leave behind their native city of Los Angeles to help solve a murder case in a small Alaskan town, they have no idea of the dangers that await them. While in pursuit of a possible suspect Will accidentally shoots and kills Hap, having mistaken him for the suspect. But was it really an accident? Back in L.A. Hap was being asked to testify against Will, who had been using some unorthodox and illegal methods to serve justice. Will reluctantly covers up his role in Hap's death so as to avoid suspicion as to whether or not the shooting was intentional. Now Will is consumed by guilt and is unable to sleep. His insomnia grows more intense, and as he's in part of Alaska where the sun doesn't set for months, he blames his sleepless condition on the light. Yet there are two people who know what's really keeping him awake at night. Ellie Burr, a young and intelligent Alaskan detective, begins to see that Will is clearly disturbed by something and she is compelled to find out what. Meanwhile a strange, reclusive pulp novelist named Walter Finch begins calling Will. Finch says that he witnessed Hap's death at Will's hands, but he won't tell the authorities so long as Will agrees to help him in return. What presents a problem is the fact that Walter Finch is the very murder suspect that Will was pursuing when the accidental shooting occurred. And there can be no denial that Walter Finch is a killer. The two men find themselves forced to work together to conceal their mutual guilt, but when Detective Ellie Burr starts to uncover the truth, Will is faced with a moral dilemma. Shall he admit his faults, lose his job, and suffer the legal ramifications for what happened in L.A. and for what happened to Hap... or shall he choose to align himself with sociopathic Walter Finch in order to save himself? And what of Ellie Burr, whose youthful enthusiasm and integrity Will has come to respect and admire? Can he protect her from the truth that incriminates him and will inevitably lead her to Walter?

Abandoning the complex narrative structure of his previous film Memento for a more straightforward storytelling style, Nolan manages to maintain a high level of suspense. He also uses numerous visual tricks to keep viewers interested in the conflicts of the characters. As Will Dormer becomes more exhausted the lights become brighter, things seem to move about him without reason, and he begins to experience hallucinations and extreme confusion. What is so remarkable is that, through all of this the viewer is able to follow the sequence of events and differentiate between reality and illusion.
The cast features Al Pacino as Detective Will Dormer, Robin Williams as Walter Finch, and Hilary Swank as Detective Ellie Burr. Not a member of the cast gives a bad performance and each of them manage to hold their own, which is a feat in itself. Hilary Swank, in particular, is great as the young idealistic Ellie Burr. Also adding an unforgettable presence to the film is Robin Williams who creates a truly frightening villain, and yet at the same time he's so charismatic that you almost sympathize with him. As for Pacino, he gives a strong performance but it's nothing that he doesn't normally do on a regular basis.

1738058,4,B00006AGHD,"Insomnia is a good thriller thats worth buying for many reasons:

Its a top notch cast. Al Pacino gives one of his his finest late performances as the detective who can't sleep investigating a murder. Robin Williams matches Pacino in his second great role that year (see One Hour Photo for the other), and the always good Hilary Swank gives a very good performance supporting the two main leads.

The director is Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins, The Prestige), who seems to have a natural talent for these type of films. He does a fine job with the actors as well as capturing the sometimes haunting nature of the Alaskan landscape. Nolan is helped by a taught script, and with a running time of less than 2 hours, you will find it difficult to sleep through.

I haven't seen the original 1997 version of this film. From what I've heard its the better of the two, which means it must be very good. However for a mainstream Hollywood movie this remake is remarkably restrained and makes compulsive viewing.",1214352000,,1015,4.691011235955056

The acting and storyline are good, but not great in ""Insomnia"". Robin Williams isn't as convincing as the bad guy in this movie and the movie could have been a tad less predictable in the ending, but otherwise a good movie overall.",1209168000,,518,4.34020618556701
1738060,5,B00006AGHD,"2002's ""Insomnia"" is one of the most quietly melancholy American movies I've ever seen--all the characters (with the exception of Hillary Swank's annoyingly idealistic female detective Ellie Burr) are somehow grimy and have something to hide.

Robin Williams plays a really good creep.  ""One Hour Photo"" was a movie with a lot of potential that ultimately went nowhere, but he sure makes up for it here as the effeminate failed writer and murderer of a 17 year old girl. Williams successfully underplays the role of a neurotic psychopath (Walter Finch) whose pathos we see emerge in the smallest and most pivotal moments, thereby making them even more disturbing.

The cinematography is damn near perfect--the Alaskan wilderness is a perfect backdrop for Det Will Dormer's (Al Pacino) psychological meltdown and inability to sleep.  The time zone and his entire life is closing in on him slowly: a previous investigation in which he planted evidence to convict another child killer is beginning to catch up with him.  On top of this, his younger partner (Martin Donovan) is forced to make a deal with internal affairs about the matter.  As if things could get worse, he accidentally shoots and kills him in a foggy gun battle where Finch is lurking.

He is then forced to sink so low as to collaborate with Finch himself, who orchestrated the incident precisely for control of not only his fate but Dormer's.  The whole theme of dishonesty, even in the service of a just cause, gracefully winds around Dormer's neck like a noose.  The ending is as devastating as the entire film, with Swank's character given  the hope of redemption out of all this corruption.  A must see.",1208649600,,1673,4.918149466192171

1738062,4,B00006AGHD,"""Insomnia"" is a 2002 film that explores the inner workings of a top detective (Al Pacino as Wll Dormer) as he nears the end of a brillant career as a police investigator, who is so feed up with the obviously guilty going free that he's starting to compromise his vaulted integrity to make sure justice is done.

The wild beauty of the Alaskian landscape should have gotten second-billing behind Pacino, as it plays an intregral in several parts of the movie.  As it is, Hilary Swank, Robin Williams and Paul Dooley are memorable in their roles as an eager police detective, a murder suspect, and the crusty local police chief, respectively.

How does it all mesh?  Well, indeed, as an increasingly tired Dormer (played well, as usual, by Pacino) careens from mistake to coverup, until he has a change of heart, salvaging his career along the way.

However, Amazon lists this as an 'essential video'.  It's a good movie, but it's not in the league of, say, Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz, The Seven Samuri, and so on.

I'd rate this a four-star film.  Recommended, primarily of Pacino's usual excellent acting.  Williams is also notable for his low-keyed, everyman, but chilly, role.",1196812800,2,1180,4.801980198019802

1738068,5,B00006AGHD,"Christopher Nolan's follow-up to his innovative breakthrough hit Memento didn't attract a third of the attention or acclaim of the previous film, despite the presence of three Oscar-winners in lead roles. I feel that Insomnia was unjustly ignored at the box office and even at the Academy Awards. In my opinion, it was one of the best American films of 2002. I had high expectations for Insomnia, considering that Christopher Nolan was directing that Al Pacino and Robin Williams were starring. Happily, my expectations were exceeded. Insomnia is one of the downright best mystery-thrillers in a long time.

I hear many people complain that it's a slow-moving film. Well, this is basically true. It's not concerned with exciting action sequences, shoot-outs or over-the-top acting. It's concerned with the emotions of its characters. It's a psychological drama that puts us inside the head of its lead character, Det. Will Dormer (Al Pacino). In a way, it's sort of a head trip similar to Memento. Memento was a very subjective film that put us in the head of its memory-loss-stricken protagonist. In Insomnia, Pacino's character deals not with memory loss, but with mental instability resulting from sleep deprivation. That's what makes the film fascinating. How the audience gets to experience what's going through Dormer's frazzled mind. He is drawn into a cat and mouse game with the killer he is pursuing, but due to his state of mind, things become very difficult.

Based on a 1997 Norwegian film, Insomnia is a rare remake that manages to be more effective than the original. I should go back and watch the original again, but I found Nolan's film to surpass the original by far. Credit should, however, go to Erik Skjoldbjrg, director and co-writer of the original film. This film would not exist without the wonderful story written by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjrg. It's a tense, psychological story of a detective trying to solve a murder case, but plagued by ever-present sunlight resulting in the titular state, insomnia.

Hillary Seitz's wonderful screenplay is based on that story and director Christopher Nolan weaves it into a stunning and complex mystery. Al Pacino gives one of his most memorable performances of recent years with his subtle take on the beleaguered detective. How Pacino manages to look so deathly exhausted, I don't know. Robin Williams also gives another great dramatic performance. I hoped that Insomnia would receive a few Academy Award nominations, such as Best Director for Nolan, Best Screenplay, Best Actor for Pacino, but the film was snubbed. It was a distant memory by the time Oscar season came around.

Do not make the same mistake as the Academy. Do not overlook this wonderful thriller. Insomnia will make you believe that Christopher Nolan is one of the most talented young directors working in the industry today. Also be sure to catch his first two films, Following (1998) and Memento (2001). Of course, Nolan has since gone on to make the best Batman movie ever (2005's Batman Begins) and the excellent 2006 thriller The Prestige. Anything with Christopher Nolan's name on it is excellent. He is simply one of the finest directors working today. I eagerly await his next project: the Batman Begins sequel, The Dark Knight.",1187827200,3,3284,5.064695009242144
1738069,5,B00006AGHD,"An intriguing, top-notch reworking of a Norwegian psychological thriller by ""Memento"" director Christopher Nolan, ""Insomnia"" gets a lot of mileage out of its picturesque Alaskan setting, since constant Northern daylight is the trigger for Dormer's sleepless (and guilt-ridden) nights. Pacino excels as the tortured cop whose error in judgment lands him in a cat-and-mouse game with his suspect, chillingly played by Williams. With strong support from Donovan and Swank (as a gung-ho rookie cop on the case), and a fabulous chase sequence on floating logs, this moody, gripping film will keep you wide awake.",1184889600,,607,5.468085106382978

1738071,4,B00006AGHD,"Besides the absorbing detective story and the layered ethical themes, this film does a great job of portraying ""insomnia"".  You really get drawn into the head of detective Dormer (nice name for someone who can't sleep!) because of Pacino's excellent performance, and also because the foggy-surreal world he haunts is so numbingly real.  Your mind plays tricks on you; your reflexes are off, you feel so far-away, so disconnected...

Sometimes you feel so alone...awake by night when all the world is asleep...exhausted by day and unable to truely inhabit that world either...but then there's that calm, knowing voice of the fellow insomniac to keep you company--he understands what it's like to be so tired...and to be a killer, too.

The foggy Alaskan scenery at the beginning of the movie is the dreamy-nightmarey set-up for the chase scene, where things go terribly awry, and Dormer shoots the wrong guy. In a later scene, chasing the murderer across a river by hopping from log to log, he falls into the frigid water and can't swim up to freedom because of the logs in the way.  Cold, numb and frantic, he surfaces; he keeps fighting against fatigue until he finally gets to sleep at the end.  I liked how he faced the moral dilemna with the bright-eyed rookie cop (Hillary Swank) at the end, too.  Well, (yawn) good night, now.",1174089600,2,1332,4.841409691629956
1738072,4,B00006AGHD,"This is a great film because it installs the elements of cops vs. crime into a different setting.  Instead of being on the streets of Los Angeles or Chicago or New York, it all takes place in the fictional town of Nightmute, Alaska.  This is a great suspenseful show that has a lot of good action scenes.  Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors and I liked the way that he was able to bring out how stressful things were for the policeman he portrays.  The film starts out with an investigation in Nightmute followed by a tragic event.  There are some skeletons in the closet back in the states for Pacino's character which are now making the stakes much higher.  Hillary Swank plays a rookie officer who goes the extra mile, but might not like what she finds.  Robin Williams is in this to, and wow, what a performance.  Robin plays a diabolical guy who is in the shadows toying with Pacino's character, and he really adds a lot to the film.  The rain and forests are beautiful but add a good solemn backdrop to this crime thriller set in Alaska.  Not a ton of plot twists but enough to keep you wondering how things will turn out.  Pacino gives a great performance in showing how an outsider could have a hard time adjusting to this environment, where it is light all the time in the summer months.",1172534400,,1300,4.375

If you don't prefer certain four letter words, don't watch it or keep your finger on the mute button. Other than offensive language, this movie is a must-see. It keeps you guessing.",1171929600,3,509,4.850574712643678
1738074,4,B00006AGHD,"Sleep disorders are not new to murder mysteries, but the way Christopher Nolan represents insomnia visually is at least as wonderful as Al Pacino's patient acting.  Pacino plays a detective from L.A., Will Dormer, who is sent to Alaska to help out an old friend with a murder case.  Dormer and his partner (played by Martin Donovan) are under investigation by Internal Affairs in L.A., so there's more to this temporary transfer than assisting a fellow badge.

In Alaska, it's light all day and every day when Dormer and his partner arrive, and Dormer has insomnia.  Pacino gradually slows his character's actions and reactions down until I felt that he was severely debilitated and in danger.  He makes mistakes: some deliberate, others on accident, and still others he isn't sure of.  The latter make for the most intriguing part of this well-constructed thriller.

Hillary Swank plays the smart, plucky detective, Ellie Burr, who is stuck serving misdemeanors instead of actual collars.  She has studied Dormer's career and admires him.  Swank plays the role without overreaching.  I cannot say the same for Pacino.  Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Jack Nicholson all suffer from the same affliction: As great as they are as actors, their personalities are greater.  I cannot watch them in films and pretend that they are anyone but themselves.  I still enjoy their performances, but they are decidedly bigger than any of the characters they have ever played.  They just can't help it.

Maura Tierney gives an excellent but thankless performance as the front desk clerk (or manager) of the hotel where Dormer and his partner stay.  She softens Pacino in a way that Swank is unable to do.  Or maybe Pacino tempers himself; it's hard to tell.

Robin Williams, as Walter Finch, is quite excellent at being creepy.  The banter between Finch and Dormer is something of a throwback to a different time: ""You're my job,"" says Dormer when Finch maneuvers for sympathy.  They seem to know each other as if from across the room, not like lovers, but like familiar character types in a familiar story.

And Nolan isn't trying to do anything entirely new in Insomnia.  He's telling you a story you already know.  He twists it slightly with great visual effects and a cold, blue camera lens.  As much as I enjoy the film, it's not perfect.  The screenplay is written into a corner, and the ending is easy to see a mile away.  Likewise, some of the dialogue between Dormer and Finch is heavy-handed and cheesy.

At its heart, this is the story of a downfall.  Don't judge the film by its murder/mystery/suspense genre tag.  Character takes precedence over plot.  It's not as good as Nolan's Memento, but Nolan's craft leaves its marks.",1170288000,5,2723,4.856521739130435

1738079,3,B00006AGHD,"When I saw this film in the theaters back in 2002, I was blown away.  I had seen Christopher Nolan's Memento, and couldn't wait for his follow-up film.  I was impressed by the eclectic range of characters from Hilary Swank, Al Pacino, and Robin Williams - a combination that I may have put money down prior to this film the group that would never share screen time together.  I was wrong.  I also was eagerly anticipating what Nolan would do with this film, having not seen the original when I went to the theater; I knew that he would bring us a compelling drama that would pull the best out of our cast.  I was not disappointed.  When this film was released, I immediately bought it, poured it into my collection of films, and watched it at least a dozen times since then.  I loved the combination of acting between Pacino and Williams because they had two completely different styles.  I thought Swank was decent, but contributed very little to the simpleton character she was to play - and I thought that Maura Tierney as the reclusive innkeeper was a great fit.  I loved the way that Nolan filmed it, the cinematography was excellent, and the music kept me on the edge of my seat until the very, clich ending.  I was in awe of this film - that is - until I saw the original.  Now, I find myself questioning the value of this film and of Nolan's honesty to the original director's vision.  It nearly makes me tear up to see a great, valued independent foreign film get the slap of U.S.D.A. Hollywood on it with bigger budgets, bigger scripts, and an ending that seemed like it arrived directly from the ""How to build a great climax"" handbook handed to new ... mainstream directors.

For those looking for a review of just this version of Insomnia, I want to initially say that watching this film on its own is good.  If you have not seen the original, then this is a great eye candy film with fantastic scenes that prove that Nolan can conquer his trade if given the opportunity (remember what he did with the Batman legacy), but together these films do not match up and fans of the original will scoff at Nolan's poor attempt to bring the honesty and directness that director Erik Skjoldbjrg superbly brought to the screen.  I understand that one, when making comments about Insomnia, should keep them separate, but there are so many disheartening differences between the two that I do not want others to purely watch this one with Pacino and Williams, but instead see the two and make their own assessments.  To begin, Pacino is no Stellan Skarsgrd (as odd as that may be to say), but Skarsgrd brings a character to the screen forcing us to follow the emotional level of the events, instead of Pacino's over-the-top reactions to situations.  While Skarsgrd brings intensity to the character due to events and his ""unknown"" past, Pacino brings a visual to the character.  You cannot seem to take your eyes off Pacino, but that is just him being the actor that he is.  There are elements left out of Nolan's interpretation that are key to truly giving us the ""bad cop"" mentality that we are supposed to have about Dormer.  Oddly, in the original, we are not supposed to find ourselves liking or feeling sympathy for Skarsgrd, but in this one we want to see Pacino come clean and rid himself of the guilt.  A big difference between the two films is the cross-referencing between Pacino and Skarsgrd, because by seeing each of these two bring something new to the table, we, as viewers, saw a completely different film.

Outside of the characters, Nolan's indiscreet changes do morph this film into something completely different that originally conceived.  To call this film a remake would be tough in my eyes, because it is not a remake.  It is a new interpretation of a classic film.  Nolan makes some small changes to the plot which ultimately changes that course of our characters and the overall tones of the film.  For example, there is quite a bit more Hollywood ""running"" in Nolan's film than in the original.  Skarsgrd captures our attention because of his internal conflicts, while Nolan captures our attention in his film by forcing us to watch Pacino run Williams down, to see him screaming his lines at random characters, and the ending that just epitomizes the standard that Hollywood seems to embrace.  Without giving away too much detail, I must say that unlike the original, more gunfire is used, the intensity of the music is increased, and an event occurs with our main character that changes the original film completely.  That is why I cannot call this film a remake in any way shape or form.  This is an interpretation, albeit a very close interpretation, but not identical.  Nolan took chances, he changed the frame of the story, and gave us a pure 100% uncut slice of Hollywood that one could almost witness in any blockbuster released during the summer months.  It was pathetic and if I were the director of the original, Nolan's interpretation would have made me rather upset.

Overall, I still like Nolan's work, and while I have lowered my enjoyment of this film after seeing this original, I must say that from 2002-present I thoroughly enjoyed Nolan's Insomnia.  So, where does that put us currently?  I would suggest this film to friends mainly because I am a sucker for Pacino's work (early and recent), and for some strange reason I cannot say ""no"" to a Robin Williams' film (even if this took place during his ""dark"" stint).  I also think that Nolan's craft is unmatched today, and while he will conform to Hollywood (i.e. Insomnia), he uses it to pay rent and finance his next films.  For that, I gotta respect him.  I will say this to friends as well, if you want to see a great film, one must see the original Insomnia and witness a truly disturbing character at his best.  Skarsgrd is on the top of his game with version, and Pacino could not compete.  To summarize, together these two films cannot compare because the original is 100% better (because they ARE two separate films), but apart Nolan does cloak a good story with great cinematography.  So, I would suggest it.  Count me on the fence wit this one!!

1738082,1,B00006AGHD,"I am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent!! As for me, I made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay. The fault in order of importance: poor screenplay, poor cinematography and poor performance by Pacino, who seems to be vying for the most over-the-top performance. The film was absurd in many ways from the outset: the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans. Close-up after close-up conveying no meaning, Pacino overacting like Jack Palance in one of his not-so-famous European pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies, an utterly dumb plot with Pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops.

First example, they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that; then, instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound, they storm the stairs and Pacino stands right in front of the door yelling ""Police, you're under arrest.""

They kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source. Of course, Pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream, having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort.

Cut to Pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog, glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog. Stumbling around further, Pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from, we must assume, his quarry. Did the screen writer forget that Pacino's colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit, too?

Inevitably and apparently not, because Pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him. As I watched this scene unfold, I became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what I knew already, that Pacino has fired on and killed his partner. It was then that I decided that I had had enough.

By the way, the European version, with Stellan Skarsgaard is infinitely superior. Don't waste your money or on-line rental queue on this Hollywood drivel. Ditto for the other Pacino junk I rented at the same time, The Recruit, which I could only stand for about a half hour too.",1154908800,11,2269,4.71969696969697
1738083,3,B00006AGHD,"Christopher Nolan's 2002 remake of Insomina is sadly his weakest film in an otherwise impressive filmography. The main problem is the relentless softening and sentimentalising of the material: Pacino's cop is much more sociable and wise rather than the Skaarsgard's morally empty cold fish, and is consequently much less interesting. Nolan keeps Pacino's shouty moments to a minimum and he does a much more impressive job of the sleep deprivation, but the audience-friendly characterization results in a clich?d stereotype on a predictable journey to inevitable redemption.

Sadly, the dilution doesn't end with Pacino but runs throughout the film. In this version - for those familiar with the original - the dog is already dead to avoid anything that might alienate us from the hero, the women are mostly father confessor figures, the hotel receptionist IS polite to the shot man, there's no kitten scene, Hilary Swank is saddled with a horrible ""I know you're a good cop even if you don't"" scene that lacks the cold condemnation and loss of trust of the original's finale and, most damagingly, it's strongly implied that the girl's murder was not accidental, which draws a line between cop and killer. A couple of key scenes are badly directed, most notably the shooting in the fog that highlights Nolan's problems with action scenes (although there is one good chase over logs in the river).

There are, however, strong points, mostly once Robin Williams enters the scene. The film does briefly address the complicity between cop and killer and takes interesting detours from the original, but it's still a film that works for a couple of reels at a time then goes off the boil for another couple of reels before staging another recovery.",1145750400,,1742,5.045138888888889

Because of my diehard love for Hilary Swank, I wish she had more of a role or had been completely left out. Robin Williams is good at times but I really don't think he's the ideal person for the villain slot. The hero of the film is Al Pacino who acted pretty good. The 24hour day theme in the film was very good and the locations were good too. I liked how the film played around with guilt and duty.

1738089,2,B00006AGHD,"It's not just that this film is a bloated remake of a quick, clean, near-perfect minimalist thriller. It's not that much of the added material (particularly the internal affairs sub-plot) feels tacked-on and unnecessary. It's not even that Pacino's character is a toned-down shell of the dangerously off-kilter detective of the original, that one of the more complicated characters (Frya Selmer/Tanya Francke) has been reduced down to set dressing, or that the ending ruins the film's moral atmosphere. It's the fact that Nolan, a sublimely talented director, is unable to coax a believable performance from any of his leads. Pacino does the method-acting bit again, taking it over the top in every single scene; Hilary Swank plays a pale imitation of her better roles as the down-to-earth hometown girl; and Robin Williams--well, he's Robin Williams. The kids in this film, Katharine Isabelle and Jonathan Jackson, turn in fine performances that, while hardly career-makers (which they couldn't be, considering how far their roles have been pared down), are a refreshing change of pace from their adult contemporaries' mugging.

I also have no interest in 'mob' movies; consequently, I've actually not seen much of Al Pacino before. Wow; what a great actor, and he is onscreen nearly every moment from start to finish. Will Dormer (Pacino) is a most compelling character, struggling increasingly with his demons as he tries to stay focused despite being severely sleep-deprived, having been sent to Alaska during the ""white nights"" season to solve a criminal case. The story is presented in such a way as to engage and involve the viewer in Dormer's dilemma(s), and the Alaskan landscape (though I think most of it was actually Vancouver) is breathtakingly beautiful, making me wish I'd seen this movie in a theater. However, had I seen the theatrical trailer first I never would have taken an interest in ""Insomnia"". The trailer makes it look like a typical formulaic action movie; ugh. Instead, I read between the lines of others' opinions and trusted my instincts that ""Insomnia"" is a movie well worth viewing.

The movie could have had a better and unpredictable ending but everything else was almost perfect. Besides some confusing moments and the predictable ending, everything clicks right for this movie.

The acting is superb, notably by Robin Williams, but also by Al Pacino and Hilary Swank. The visuals are gorgeous showing Alaskan landscapes. The score is perfect, and the plot is brilliant. I never saw the other version of this movie and didn't read the book (is it based on the book?) but loved this movie. The flashbacks were great as were the killer's phone calls.

This movie had some faults but so do all movies and sometimes, these crazy plot twists at the end of movies seem really unrealistic and degrade the movie. This doesn't have a plot twist at the end because it didn't need one,and the predictable but neat ending didn't ruin the movie whatsoever.

The plot of this movie is about 2 LA cops that come to Alaska to investigate a girl's murder. But Detective Dormer (Al Pacino) can't sleep because it's always light out there. And when an incident occurs that Dormer covers up by blaming the killer, things get complicated...because the killer saw him do it...

His younger partner is put under pressure by some investigation in the service and he is going to yield, i.e. speak. In a difficult investigation in Alaska the senior cop is confronted with the possible accident of shooting at some outline that could be the criminal or any other cop on the ground, because of the poor visibility due to fog. He shoots, and it is his partner. The criminal witnessed this event and, as a detective story writer, manipulates the cop into some impossible situation that is aiming at making someone else be found and proved guilty. Unluckily things are moving slightly differently. And the result will be a whole slate of dead bodies. There definitely is some suspense in all that. We are constantly wondering what the criminal or the cop are going to do to trap each other and we are in for quite a few surprises. Good entertainment even if it is not a masterpiece. No psychological depth, no social dimension, no symbolical power, just a cat and a mouse playing together and we of course never know who the cat is, not to speak of the mouse. A perfect situation for a third little animal to come into the picture and play his own game.

At the turn of the century, the elite in-crowd gathers to socialize with the creatures of the seedy underworld and the Bohemian lifestyle at the legendary Parisian hot spot, the Moulin Rouge. Satine (Nicole Kidman) is known as the ""Sparkling Diamond"" for her dazzling beauty and immense talent as a courtesan. When Christian (Ewan McGregor), a young and talented writer, falls in love with her, she realizes he will be bad for business. A deal is made between the Moulin Rouge's owner, Harold Sidler (Jim Broadbent) and the Duke (Richard Roxburgh), to transform the club into a theater and put on a show, Spectacular Spectacular. In order to close the deal, Christian comes up with a bizarre story off the top of his head and the ensemble cast follows along with it. As the final piece, Satine must exclusively belong to the Duke, a slimy character with evil intentions.

While Sidler agrees, it is already too late as Satine has fallen in love with Christian. They are careful to hide their torrid love affair, but it becomes evident to everyone except the Duke who's as sharp as a sack of wet mice. Lushly directed by Baz Luhrmann, this post-modern twist on the musical uses extreme photography techniques, vibrant colors and costumes, and visionary dream sequences to tell the story through song. Academy awards were presented to Catherine Martin for both Costume Design and Art Direction.

The magic of falling in love is captured so perfectly in the setting and musical numbers that you are swept away with the overwhelming desire to go fall in love. Kidman and McGregor pour themselves into these musical numbers and sing with the emotions of a thousand magical dreams. It almost feels like you are in a fairy tale. Original songs, ""I'll fly away"" and ""Come what may,"" easily rival any memorable show tunes, but what really sells them are the voices of Kidman and especially McGregor. As Christian, McGregor gives all an artist possibly could to portray the young writer who is captivated by the gorgeous Satine. You truly believe and feel every emotion he experiences on screen just by looking in his eyes. It feels like you are looking into his soul.

Kidman is marvelous as the famed courtesan who is dying, but doesn't know it. She is the consumate performer and as the number goes, ""the show must go on."" She won the Golden Globe for her performance in this role and was nominated for an Academy Award. Among the dazzling music, vibrant scenery and captivating performances, this tale teaches us ""the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.""",1120521600,2,2803,4.77319587628866

A virtual nobody in Hollywood until his sleeper hit, ""Memento"", Christopher Nolan appears to be the go-to guy for murder/mystery thrillers.  To Christopher Nolan's credit, after making the incredibly confusing ""Memento"", he chose to make a more straight-forward mystery thrill ride and the move pays off big time.

""Insomnia"" tells the story of LAPD detective Dormer (Al Pacino) who along with his partner, are sent up to Alaska to solve a startling murder of a teenage girl in a small quiet town.  The cops of this small town aren't sure what precipitated this murder, and they're not sure about the odd circumstances that surround the two LAPD detectives presence here, other than Dormer is a friend of the town's chief of police.  Things quickly get out of hand when a tip is given, as to the perpetrator's possible location, and a friendly fire accident leaves Dormer's partner dead and Dormer to blame for the shooting.  Things are only complicated further when the killer is the witness to the accidental shooting and knows that Dormer is trying to cover it up, because the reason LAPD sent them to Alaska, besides assisting in a murder investigation, was to get them away from Internal Affairs, and a ""friendly-fire"" altercation would seem greatly suspicious.  To top things off, it's the time of year in Alaska when there is constant sunlight, leaving Det. Dormer suffering from insomnia, and growing increasingly withdrawn and somewhat crazy.  With all of that occurring the killer chooses to use Dormer's guilt and cover-up as leverage in assisting him in placing the guilt of this small town girl's murder on someone else letting him off the hook.

""Insomnia"" is superbly acted and directed, with stand-out performances by Al Pacino (no surprise there), Robin Williams, and Hillary Swank.  Excellent cast, with great material to work with, all held together by an incredible director.  This is one thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat and is not to be missed!

Just arrived from L.A., the detective has been called to this fishing town to resolve a terrible crime. Alongside his partner Eckhart and the local rookie Ellie Burr, Dormer has to uncover the identity of a 17 year old girl's killer.

A remake of the 1997 Norwegian film, Insomnia offer a detailed look of a cop's mind, whose moral has been corrupted.

The lack of sleep works as an explicit metaphor about a human being's incapacity of live with a dirty conscience. The moral debate, the intrigue and tension are elements that help to invigorate the plot. The somber tone of the characters is reflected masterfully with the portrayals of Williams and Pacino.

Insomnia lets us see that not everything in life is black and white. Our experiences, generally, are a mix of grays. It also explores the reasons and motives of villains, and the vulnerabilities of heroes.

At some point, inspector Dormer defines his position when affirms that ""his job is to assign guilt"". To decide whether he should do it by taking a look to the exterior world or to him is the most critic crossroad of this wonderful film.",1120003200,,1368,4.702928870292887

L.A. Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) travels to Alaska with his partner to investigate the murder of a local girl. Not only must Dormer face the daunting task of finding the killer, but he must also cope with the never setting sun, which eventually deprives him from much needed sleep. He also kills his partner by accident, and must also construct a way out of that as well. The movie's location in the beauty and lushness of Alaska make you want to pack up the camper and head there for a month. It really added to the depth of the film, as opposed to it taking place in the ""lower 48"".

Once Pacino and his partner arrive at their destination, they are greeted by Detective Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank), who idolizes Dormer. While I felt that this was kind of annoying at first,  it was interesting to see the pivitol point where she transitions from trusting and admiring Dormer to suspecting him of killing his partner. While the chief of police seemed grateful for Dormer's assistance, I  sensed resentment from the other local cops at his presence. It seemed as though they were subconciously saying ""Why bring in an outsider when we are just as capable?"" Nevertheless, the local officers eventually warm up to him and begin to trust and depend on his experience and expertise to catch the killer, played by Robin Williams. While Williams' performance as a villan was not on par with his phenomenal work in ""One Hour Photo"", he still plays his character well. He is the only witness to Dormer's shooting of his partner, and he uses this as psychological leverage throughout the second half of the film.

If it bored me, I could always turn the channel to the satellite view of the airplane's flight path. I was happy to see the film's setting was one of my favorite places on earth--Alaska.

It shows that even in Alaska, there are modern, state-of-the-art police technology, and people have cars and them thar real big picture box contraptions. Wow!

The murder mystery intensifies as does the mystery surrounding Pacino's character. The local police trust his judgment, but they sense something just isn't quite right with him, especially one police woman who is suspicious of his motives. What happened back in Los Angeles?

Running Time:  118 minutes.
Rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity.
As if Hitchcock woke from the dead and decided to make one last film so his soul could finally rest, he would have made a film very similar to ""Insomnia"".  Although Christopher Nolan is certainly no Hitchcock, this intense suspense-thriller possesses the some of the qualities that make a true classic.  The story winds through the nightless town of Nightmute, Alaska, where LAPD detective Will Dormer (played by Al Pacino is an only par performance) investigates a troubling serial killer case.  When the investigation takes a sudden, twisting turn, Dormer not only is in pursuit of a killer, but is up against the sleepless psychological trauma that is disrupting his every move.
As Dormer gets closer and closer to the truth, he comes across a startlingly eerie author (Robin Williams), who happens to have vital information about concerning one of the victim's death.  As Dormer becomes more involved with the author, his paranoia grows increasingly unstable.  Williams steals the show throughout the second half of the film, portraying the role with ease; a haunting character that must have crept mightily out of his soul.  Hillary Swank is a some-what misused rookie officer who is one step behind Dormer in solving the case and her peformance is only fair.
Director Nolan uses the excellent Hilary Seitz to his advantage, plotting Dormer's fears and ambitions, tooling Pacino and Williams's characters in a battle of good and evil, yet the good and the evil are presented in an enigmatic, vague fashion that will keep viewers guessing.  Entertaining, thrilling, and moderately scary--Hitchcock would have been pretty proud.",1085270400,,1831,5.261168384879725

Everything in Insomnia seemed to free out the stereotypes as it's supposed to be. Things of this kind can always be boring and pale if not for atmospheric direction and top-notch performances.
Starring three Oscar winners, Insomnia follows its artistic pacing without losing any commercial attraction. Al Pacino, a top favourite of mine, is prominent again as a sleep-losing yet conscionable veteran cop, occasionally losing his mind but never losing his heart. Robin Williams, gives a convincing flick of a devil shielded with a writer's position. He's shrewd and almost controlling before you, yet fragile and vulnerable behind. The only regret is that the character was reduced at it's screenplay level, with only forty minutes screen time. Williams leads the role as a dominant yet also an undercurrent, with a dark impact, which was insinuated in the endless shining set and Al Pacino's progressive sleeplessness.
Beyond these two men's insomnia circle, Swank, portrayed an idolizing yet astute enough young cop, timely refreshing you and rightfully-oriented when you are becoming fatigued and confused with the two men's psychological battle. Slightly pale yet still lovable at the same time. Maura Tierney also lends a helping hand as the Hotel manager who sympathises with Pacino's character.
Director Chris Nolan covered all these twists with atmospheric directing, not showing off yet blatant which, normally seen in Hollywood thrillers, restrains story-telling and thought-evoking.

***May contain SPOILERS***
The plot begins with the arrival of a pair of Homicide detectives in an Alaskan town to solve the murder of a local girl. Pacino plays the older cop Dormer who rendered insomniac in the perpetual sunlight of the season. An early lead into the killer's whereabouts leads to a stakeout at a cabin hideaway - a treacherous fog befuddles sight and Dormer ends up shooting his partner, apparently by accident. He places the blame on the escaped killer and the investigations are continued. Dormer has the guilt of his partner's death to compound his insomnia and another person knows the truth of the incident - the killer, who has seen Dormer fire the fatal shot. A cat-and-mouse game ensues between the two, with Dormer alternating between hunting down the murderer and covering up his own tracks, while the killer (Robin Williams as Walter Finch, a pulp writer) aims to psyche Dormer into letting him escape - the two end up working out a deal where a third person is framed for the crime. But things go awry in this setup and the film abruptly makes towards a (silly) shootout climax in which Dormer and Finch gun each other down.
The main problem IMO with this film is that it gives off a thorough sense of `under-achievement' in every aspect of it. There were a thousand ways little and big in which the visual and emotional core of the film could have been imbued with substance but really all that seems to have fallen by the wayside if at all considered.
1. The look of most of the film is so utterly generic it's disheartening. The aspect of a sparsely populated settlement who live a season of perpetual sunlight is dealt with in a perfunctory manner that sucks away most of the uniqueness of the film. This should have been a focal point that defined the sensibility and emotional core of the film and it was just thrown off as a two-scene gimmick reference. The entire concept of `light-as-darkness' blinding and disorienting Dormer's character is never approached to an extent worth the mention. Without that really what was the point of shooting the film in Alaska - to show that Alaska's cranky teens and crazy killers were like those in any other part of the country?
2. Pacino seems to have been selected for the role of the haggard Dormer simply because his entire current career seems veered towards playing haggard old men. This is not to say that he does a bad job, he gets pretty effective in some of the scenes that come immediately after the partner's killing but really at very few points does one feel the turmoil and disorientation of Dormer and there are a few bits of sleepwalk acting even for an insomniac character.
3. Robin William's writer-killer character is again a stereotype that has been seen in umpteen movies made before. I really wish they had taken pains over giving his character a different edge - But we're still stuck with the generic loony-killer.
4. The clean-cut rookie cop who's a fan of Dormer (Hilary Swank) seems like a throwaway character although one does not fault Swank's performance. The film would have been tighter in the absence of such extraneous parts.
5. The film lacks any real sophistication relying on cheap `oooh blood' shots to appear edgy.
6. The climax is a total no-brainer. I'm informed that the Norwegian original ends on a morally ambiguous note with the cop getting away with his escapade. Hollywood of course shies away from such subtleties and we're subjected to a pointless gun-battle in the aftermath of which a dying Dormer advises Swank to not `lose her way (towards truth, justice and the American way, one supposes)'",1077667200,4,3911,4.710948905109489
1738123,4,B00006AGHD,"Anybody remember Memento? The independent film that critics and movie lovers in general loved so much but never got the public attention or the award recognition that it probably deserved? This wasn't so much a big deal for Newmarket, the studio that distributed the film, since the film went on to make nearly three times its budget but this has to be somewhat upsetting for the filmmakers who wanted more from their work but life goes on. The director of Memento, who is currently in the works with the new Batman project, went on to a new film called Insomnia, based on a Norwegian film of the same name. What makes this film interesting is the casting of certain roles within the film. No, its not just Al Pacino, though he does add some flavor of dramatic talent to the film, it's the casting of Robin Williams as the killer. Williams, who is best known for his comedic performances in Popeye, Aladdin and Hook, isn't the first choice that comes to mind in this area but if it works, the film could spawn a cult status on the same level as Memento.
The story centers on the investigation of a murder in Alaska and the cat and mouse game that the killer instigates with one of the detectives. When a teenage girl is found murdered in a small town in Alaska, a veteran police detective and his partner are sent up to over-see an official investigation. Just as the two close in on the primary suspect of the murder, the veteran detective accidentally kills his partner in a chase, believing he was the murderer. The detective then lies about the accidental homicide and gets away with it. But he soon finds out that he isn't the only living soul who saw it happen. The murderer calls up the detective, who is racked with guilt, and plans to blackmail him into letting him go free. Now the veteran police detective must choose what means more to him, his life or his commitment to justice. The story for Insomnia does a wonderful job at dealing with conflicts of the human psyche when it comes to guilt but wasn't as surprising as Memento was. But this is a small issue as it is hard to follow up to such a critical success was that film was with many critics.
Though the cast of Insomnia represents a wide range of actors and actresses from different performance backgrounds, it doesn't change the fact that they work perfectly together. Al Pacino in the role of the veteran detective brings the film a sense of seniority, which is a good thing in this case, and plays the character perfectly all the way to the end. He showcases a man truly racked with guilt in such a way that it allows his character to really connect with audience members without giving the end to the feature away. Even though it may seem a weird choice for the role of the killer, Robin Williams gives an impressive performance in this film. The veteran comedian seems to be really be adding up his dramatic performances with roles in other adult-oriented features like One Hour Photo and Death to Smoochy and adds to his impressive resume that includes an Oscar winning performance in Good Will Hunting. Hilary Swank, as good as she could have been in this film, isn't given much, in the area of material, that allows her to really expand her acting ability.
Overall, despite lack the suspense and the surprising twists of its predecessor, Memento, Christopher Nolan gives an impressive follow-up with Insomnia that stands above most cop thrillers. The problems lie in the feature's time-length, which felt longer then it should have been, and its pacing, which seemed dragged down in certain areas. The lack of usable material for smaller characters with the film, like Hilary Swank, was a shame in there was a lot of potential for several enjoyable performances but nothing developed. Other then that, Insomnia gives an engaging view into the human psyche and the effects of guilt on the subconscious combined with amazing dramatic performances from Al Pacino and Robin Williams.",1077148800,2,3958,4.671919770773639
1738124,3,B00006AGHD,"INSOMNIA/ USA 2002 (3.0 Stars)
11 Jan 2004: The first scene from Insomnia, that of a two seater plane gliding over endless glaciers perhaps sets up the mise-en-scene of cold spaces and unexpected occurrences in alien lands. The rest of the film only builds on this growing sense of alienation even as British Director Christopher Nolan takes great care to build the entire film around one single occurrence. While I haven't seen the original Norwegian film of which this namesake is a remake, I can't imagine Scandinavian cinema to be quite so literal, aka Insomnia equals the protagonist never sleeps. My guess would be that Al Pacino's physical manifestation of what might have been a hugely meta-diagetic depiction in the original renders the two films as very different, albeit with a common storyline.
 The part I enjoyed the most was the mood that Nolan created through the clever use of texture. A harsh key light with an extra-ordinarily high lighting ratio played out the metaphor for the charred emotional feeling the central character, an upright detective (Pacino) is experiencing. This stylistic element in stark contrast to the polar blues of the Alaskan horizon (where the film is staged) aptly sets the stage for nervous expectation. The spoiler is that Detective Pacino accidentally shoots his partner where they are investigating the murder of a teenage girl in a small Alaskan town. Pacino, who works for the LAPD has a history of disagreement with his partner, and therefore feels compelled to keep the truth to himself. The catch is that the teenage-girl killer has been witness to this mishap.
 The killer turns out to be Robin Williams, who surfaces only in the latter part of the movie and whom we have all but forgotten about by now (the fact that he was even a part of this film). The exploration of the relationship between a conniving killer & a seasoned detective with a dark secret leaves the film wanting in the end. Nolan, who so successfully explores Guy Pierce's amnesia in Memento fails on the encore. We are thus left with a film that continues to work on our sub conscience with its artistic mist in never-land, but one that is finally guilty of narrative triteness. Eminently watchable for the transfer of plight and mood, Pacino does a good if somewhat less intelligent job of portraying the hapless Detective, cursed to sleeplessness in a land where the sun ironically never sets.",1075161600,,2420,4.91442542787286
1738125,4,B00006AGHD,"This is a quite diverting albeit not totally successful turn into film noire for both Robin Williams and Al Pacino, and the scenes between them are sometime electric with the kind of charisma such notable actors and stars often deliver. The script, too, is uneven, given the fascinating premise of a highly regarded but somewhat unconventional big-city detective and a somewhat disreputable character at that, (played well by Pacino) brought into the backwaters of remote Alaska to help solve a grisly and unsettling murder of a young and attractively seductive co-ed. From the outset, Pacino's character is wracked with insomnia which seems to be a result of both his own haunted past and the strange environment he now finds himself surrounded by.
Very early on, the detective and his partner discover someone suspicious revisiting the crime scene, and in pursuit Pacino makes a fateful mistake that dials up the tension level and sets the stage for the insidious cat and mouse game that ensues between the pursued killer (Williams, in an over-the top performance that provides a pulse-raising coda to the progression of events) on the one hand, and the haunted and increasingly confused and bewildered Pacino, on the other. What results from this deadly conflict is a nightmare on steroids, a film noire shot in stark and bold Technicolor shades and hues.
The supporting cast, including Hilary Swank doing a nice turn as an overly earnest young Alaskan policewoman, veteran Paul Dooley, and relative new-comer Martin Donovan, all help to promote the suffocating sense of a claustrophobic whirl of events gone tragically out of control. Not for the squeamish, I fear, but great entertainment for someone willing to see Pacino in yet another portrayal of a cop over the edge, and the surprisingly deadly Robin Williams as a most worthy opponent for the cop's relentless efforts to pursue him.

1738126,3,B00006AGHD,"Its great to see this movie filmed around here in B.C...the film is entertaining..but CANNOT be compared to the original Norwegian version of this thriller.  The location that took place & shot in the Norwegian version, was a real town north of the Arctic Circle, where one can truly experience the 24-hour daylight...where as the American version was shot not too far from the mainland US border!  The US version of the movie took place supposedly in a small town in Alaska... Yet, one cannot really see the midnight sun or experience the true 24-hour daylight north or around the Arctic Circle..yet the movie took place around densely forested regions with towering granite peaks...doesn't sound too much like Northern Alaska to me.  The first second I looked at it reminded me more of B.C.'s natural surroundings or perhaps maybe some place in southern Alaska (which is far from the Arctic Circle) rather than the north.  Definately not as realistic.  And as I recall the name of the town they used in the movie...does exist in real life in AK, but was either abandoned or too tiny of a settlement that looked nothing like the one in the movie.  The town that was shot in the movie, is in real life a fair-sized town close to Vancouver... Sorry that this unimportant information may sound boring to most of you, but for a resident here, and living so close to where the movie was shot, it was just too hard for me to ""fall into it"" or ""believe in it"".  Anyhow, without getting too picky regarding where it was shot, etc...of course, its just a movie!  Its suspensful enough with a different ending (just like any other Hollywood film), but it can't beat the original.  Go for the Norwegian version instead...the less ""Hollywood-obvious"" version.",1073088000,,1748,4.76158940397351
1738127,4,B00006AGHD,"The film certainly bears its name well because the last thing you'll want to do while watching it is to fall asleep.  In fact, the tension runs so high that even after the credits roll by, the last thing you'll be thinking about is your bed.  Most likely, what you will be doing is trying to remember the last time you saw a thriller this good, this exciting and this effective at putting you inside the uncomfortable position of its main character.  Christopher Nolan's follow-up to the fantastic MEMENTO is as tight a production as they come, featuring three Academy Award winners, an out-of-sight landscape, and a story that will tingle and scrape at more of you nerve endings than a visit to a bad dentist.
Pacino and Hilary Swank display tremendous chemistry as the veteran cop and the youngster who admires him, pairing up to solve both the initial murder and another more mysterious crime that comes along and blows the case wide open.  Thankfully, Pacino plays a more subdued character than his usually more agitated self and as for Swank, it was nice to see her with some meat on her bones, looking good and putting up a great performance.  Whilst I hardly consider myself a fan of Robin Williams, even I have to say that he was perfect as an offbeat author from a neighboring town.  It's a very character and plot driven movie and these three drove it home in style. The surrounding cast also followed their lead in playing the local cops and townspeople, with a special nod going to the delightful Maura Tierney who plays the town hotelier.
It was pretty cool to see Pacino in this setting. We're not used to seeing him in a small town with snow and grass since he's usually playing characters in New York or LA.  which was another northern murder mystery featuring cops dealing in environments in which they were not familiar.  It was actually quite refreshing and very satisfying to see this perspective on Pacino. Overall, the film is definitely worth the look and a great use of a couple of hours as solid entertainment and lots of gritting of teeth.

Two L.A. detectives are brought into this quaint little town to investigate the murder of a local teen.  Chaos ensues after a philosophically taxing event happens to chief detective Will Dormer (played by Pacino).  It's quite entertaining all the way up to the very end that will have you chewing on your fingernails without even knowing it.

It does not work and ultimately makes this a film that doesn't work. There is no menace to him - someone like Kevin Spacey would have been much better.

1738143,5,B00006AGHD,"Robin Williams plays a great serious role as a slightly crazed novelist who kills a teenage girl in a small town in Alaska.  Al Pacino is the big city cop from Los Angeles brought up to catch him.
The town, Night Mute, is the Halibut Fishing Capital of the world, but with its picturesque granite mountains in the backdrop, it looks as though the movie was shot in a larger version of Yosemite National Park, one of the most beautifully breathtaking places in the entire world.
Pacino solves the mystery early but kills his partner by accident in the process - and the killer sees him do it.  What ensues is a subtle mating dance where two spiders, Williams and Pacino, face off against each other.  One is going to die (probably) and the other is going to get screwed (just figuratively).
The pretty girl who is killed is shown in flashback, and there isn't any skin in the entire flick, except if one counts her nude figure lying dead across the coroner's table.
Hilary Swank plays a great role as a bushy tailed rookie cop who idolizes Pacino, but then at the end sees him as the human being that is all of us.
The mental sparing between Williams and Pacino makes the film come alive - even though with the Alaskan 24-hour days Pacino isn't able to sleep throughout the entire film.
The movie builds to a climactic finish, and you won't be able to either (sleep, that is!).  Pacino, as an experienced, cop is in his element.

1738147,5,B00006AGHD,"Insomnia is the second outing from director Christopher Nolan (Memento) and, while not as thrilling and innovative as his first movie, its still an taut thriller in the film noir tradition.
The plot centers around a detective (Al Pacino) sent from LA up to Alaska to solve a brutal murder.  A bright, but naive young local detective (Hilary Swank) helps him search for clues.  While searching in the Alaskan wilderness Pacino's character accidentally kills his partner and covers it up.  The problem is that the actual murderer (Robin Williams) saw Pacino do this.  A ""cat-and-mouse"" game between Pacino and Williams ensues.
Pacino is excellent as a detective burdened from past sins and the constant daylight of northern Alaska.  Williams is also brilliant as a mild-mannered author who in a split second, turned into cold, calculating killer.  Its a needed departure from his spastic comedy and hokey ""coming-of-age"" dramas.  Swank is good too(especially at the film's climax), but unfortunately under used.  The plot kind of relies a bit heavy on too many film-noir/corrupt cop conventions, but it still makes those cliches seem fresh.  It is also interesting to see how both Pacino's and Williams' characters begin their path to ruin by rationalizing their deeds as being done for the greater good, but end up trapped in a lie after lie.

1738148,3,B00006AGHD,"This  psychological thriller is based upon Norwegian writer Erik Skjoldbjaerg's novel of the same title.  Al Pacino took a 4 year absence from acting before this film, and it's no surprise that this one broke him from his hiatus, as it has a great script and it stars two other Academy Award winning performers, Hillary Swank and Robin Williams.
Set in Alaska, this film is about Will Dormer, a veteran LA detective, played by Pacino. Dormer is sent with partner Hap Eckhart to investigate the grisly murder of a 17-year-old girl. At the same time, Dormer & Eckhart are being investigated by internal affairs for some suspicious police work, which Dormer believes Eckhart is about to spill the beans about.
The two colleagues are welcomed in Alaska by Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), a policewoman who is also interested in solving this strange case. Dormer accidentally shoots his partner Eckhart, but knows how it will look if he confesses to the shooting, so he misleads them to believe that the suspect did the shooting and continues the investigation.  The story goes through some interesting twists and turns from there on.
Three academy award winners in one movie that is based on a fantastic book with the same director as Memento seems like a sure winner, and it certainly did well at the box office, but it falls flat.  Perhaps Swank and Pacino are afraid to upstage each other, as both their performances lack emotional depth and energy.  Williams' performance is shockingly superb, however, as this role is a side of him not yet seen and he plays it very well.  He finally shows he is a talented actor with more range than the Patch Adams and Mrs Doubtfire roles he usually takes.  Williams' great performance can't save this film though, as it just doesn't get to the heart.  The lack of emotional impact of it has is disappointing, as the criminal is more interesting and complex than the cops.  The line fine they are creating between cop and criminal isn't lost on me, but Pacino's character is wooden and emotionally superficial and there's a void in the film where a great character should be.

When you sit down to watch one of his films, you're usually guaranteed of one thing, Al Pacino in a movie with a different name, his portrayals are usually pretty similar.  This is not the case with ""Insomnia,"" which I believe is inherent to the fact that he had to play a famous detective from LA that is brought onto a case in Nightmute, Alaska and guess what, it daytime all day, and he's having a problem sleeping, due to both the all day daylight and a ""slight"" conscience problem.
Beyond Al Pacino's stellar performance in ""Insomnia"" there is Robin Williams and Hilary Swank, all three being Academy Award winners.

The ever beautiful Hilary Swank is right on with her performance as the somewhat ""star struck"" local detective, assigned to assist Al Pacino's character.
As a follow up to his directorial debut in ""Memento,"" director Christopher Nolan delivers brilliantly in ""Insomnia"" and his future films are to be looked forward to.
The premise:
LAPD Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) is called in to investigate the murder of a local in Nightmute, Alaska.  Upon arrival and being met by Hilary Swank's character, he immediately views the remains of the murder victim, a young high school girl whose been beaten to death.  With the investigation started, he soon learns of the ever shining ""midnight"" sun during this time of year in Alaska and he soon learns of his partners intentions with reference to his affairs back in LA.  Take the already palpable tension between he and his partner, a stakeout where their hoping to catch the killer and fog off of a lake and here you have an exceptional psychological thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.
I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of this genre.  {ssintrepid}

1738165,4,B00006AGHD,"Christopher Nolan has surprised audiences with the follow-up to his mega-successful film Memento. While not as layered and intricately plotted as his first film, Insomnia stands on it's own as a wonderfully paced murder mystery. The setting for this film is the main star. Alaska has never looked more foreboding, cold, or alien as it does in this picture and the wonderful cinematography only adds to the tension of the piece. Al Pacino, as always, is wonderful as Det. Dormer, a man with a haunted past of mistakes, guilt ridden decision making, and a terrible infirmity: Insomnia. Robin Williams infuses his manical portrayal of a cold, caluculating killer with righteous aplomb: The demon next door. A few particularly weak plot devices fail to ruin the mystery of the film, and the script crackles with sharp dialogue. Highly recommended for mystery fans.",1059350400,,860,5.1063829787234045

1738180,4,B00006AGHD,"Allthough a lot of people avoided this film in the movie theaters (myself included) because of the rather dodgy choice of the casting Robin Williams as a killer, it appears that these fears were totally unjustified.
  Insomnia is a film that contributes nicely to a genre desperate gor oxygen, that of the old and classic ""dtetective film"".
  It works because it incorporates several interesting angles to keep you interested throughout as well as guessing.
  An Alaskan town as the setting for a murder case where an L.A detective is brought in? Nice touch.
  A killer not played by the usual baddies but by ""Ms Doubtfire""-Robin Williams? Better touch even.
  A detective who cant seem to get any sleep under the never setting sun in Alaska even if his life depended on it? Good, really good.
  It's mainly those 3 axes that fuel the engine of this story and, of course, the superb acting of Pacino and even Williams who settles in his killer role incredibly convincingly. It wouldnt matter, in fact, how Pacino came across here had Williams not fit in with his role. The whole thing would've collapsed in ruins.
  But that's exactly it, Williams plays the loser-small-time-author-turned-killer perfectly and from there on it's a smooth ride all the way to the end.
  This is a film by dierctor Chritopher Nolan who filmed Memento and if u thought that Memento avoided any cliches so does Insomnia. Insomnia HAD to avoid the cliches because ths is genre that has gone stale exactly because it rode the cliches for far too long.
  Pacino's character is one that grows edgier every 5 minutes the film progresses no doubt NOT helped by his lack of sleep. He's also a character that has a lot on the line as he's been sent to Alaska because of internal tension in his department and because he's got a great reputation to protect.
  That reputation takes a huge dent as he winds up killing his partner in the case (by mistake? not? not sure) and this becomes the killer's leverage point in a way that provides for numerous twists.
  Williams's character is one that has become a murderer ""because it happened"" and he seems to have great adjustability potentials as he slips into his role like a snake would around its victim. Being the cornered animal since it's not going to be easy to remain unknown for long in the small Alaskan town environs he decides to turn this into a poker affair with the cop. As Pacino seems to either overtrust or simoultaneously underestimate his opponent the twists become weirder and better.

  Much to the director's credit there's no clear-cut happy end. Had there been it would a classic case of the film that does well or great until the last 30 seconds when it all turns silly. Not the case here, the end is tense, believable, plausible and has the showdown touch the whole story has been yearning for.
  Refreshing and excellently filmed it reminded me how much i've missed good detective story-films.",1055980800,,2936,4.728346456692913

1738185,4,B00006AGHD,"Hollywood seems to have a love affair with remakes. A few years back it was hip to remake French films, then it was film versions of old TV shows, and every year there seems to be a ""Sequelitis"" epidemic in multiplexes worldwide. But INSOMNIA offers a Hollywood rarity: This is a remake of a NORWEGIAN movie.
While my opening comments don't offer much hope for the film, INSOMNIA is actually a great movie once you get into it. Starring Oscar winners Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank, executive produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney and directed by Christopher Nolan director of the vastly overrated MEMENTO, INSOMNIA is a compelling mystery thriller.
When cop Will Dormer (Pacino) witnesses the murder of his partner, the prime suspect is mystery writer Walter Finch (Williams). But while Finch appears accommodating to the police, chronic insomniac Dormer finds himself receiving taunting calls from Finch in the middle of the night. Dormer's investigation leads him to a remote Alaskan town which never sees nightfall during the spring/summer seasons where he is partnered with local cop Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank). But with the combination of the continued threats from his unseen nemesis and the stress of the investigation, Dormer's sleeping disorder is wearing him down and disorientating him, making him an easier target.
Like MEMENTO, INSOMNIA is full of twists and is beautifully photographed. But thankfully unlike it, INSOMNIA has a plot that makes sense and keeps the viewer glued to the screen; but it is the strong characterisations by Pacino and Williams that make their cat-and-mouse game utterly compelling. I haven't seen the Norwegian version, but as far as remakes go its probably a pretty safe bet that INSOMNIA is in the upper ranks.",1051056000,2,1777,5.13103448275862
1738186,4,B00006AGHD,"I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan. Even though I only saw Memento in 2001, I knew great things were meant for this director. Unfortunately, Insomnia isn't as great as Memento was but it definitely still a great movie that kept me intrigued the whole way through.
One of the strongest things about the movie is the performances by the two leading actors, Al Pacino and Robin Williams. Pacino displays depths and many character stages in this film - he's excellent, as per usual. Williams doesn't get as much screentime unfortunately, but the time he does have is chilling and enthralling - I was very interested by his character. The two supporting actresses - Hilary Swank and Maura Tierney - were good as well, especially Swank, who needs to be in more movies!
I loved the style of the film. It had some very clever editing techniques used and I just adored the cuts Chris used. The cinematography was great and the atmosphere was very ""dangerous-small-mountain-town"" which I appreciated.
There were a couple of problems in the movie - Robin Williams' character should've been developed further because he is SO interesting and the chemistry between him and Pacino is SO good. Also, the final shootout scene - it just seemed rushed to me.
Christopher Nolan has done another good film overall though, and I look forward to seeing how his directing talents develop even further.",1050451200,,1379,4.8474576271186445
1738187,4,B00006AGHD,"Chris Nolan's version of Insomnia is an American-ized (and slightly watered-down) remake of the excellent original Norwegian film, which featured Swedish Stellan Skarsgrd (best known to American audiences for his work in ""Good Will Hunting"") as the sleep-deprived lead detective.
I had one fundamental problem:  I never really bought into the contrived circumstances that lead Pacino and partner Martin Donovan (who many will recall for his excellent portrayal as Christina Ricci's brother in 'The Opposite of Sex') up to Alaska.
Once ensconced in Alaska, I've got to admit:  Pacino does a really good Pacino here.  His Pacino persona is a hand-in-glove fit for this sleep-deprived role.  Pacino being Pacino, I'll bet he took the Method approach and literally didn't sleep for 5+ days.  Either way, his frustration and increasingly slowed reflexes and perplexity are palpable.
The real revelation for me was Robin Williams.  Even though he got an Oscar for 'Good Will Hunting,' I thought his fake Boston accent schtick there was dreadful.  Anyone who grew up within a 100-mile radius of Boston tuned him out the second he opened his mouth.
Here, though, he's superb.  Forgot ""One Hour Photo.""  Williams is perfectly creepy and calculating here.  I never for a second thought I was watching another goofy Robin Williams role.  He needs more ""Insomnia,"" less ""Death to Smoochy.""  I hope we see more inspired choices like this from him in the future.",1050364800,,1448,5.167381974248927

During the murder investigation there is a simultaneous investigation of the two LA detectives in LA, which might incriminate detective Dormer and set free all the criminals that he has put behind bars.  When an opportunity to arrest the murderer of the teenage girl arises, the detectives set a trap for the murderer, but something goes wrong in the fog of things.  This leads to an overbearing sense of guilt for detective Dormer that induces insomnia, which affects logical reasoning and all other aspects of detective Dormer's investigation of the murder.  The constant daylight keeps the audience reminded with intelligent manner that one cannot escape guilt.  Insomnia is a remake of the Norwegian film with the same title where Stellan Skarsgrd has the roll that Al Pacino performs in the remake.  The Norwegian version is different in the sense of solitude and culture while the remade version provides an clever and different view of the same film.  The film is cunningly directed as well as acted with a brilliant touch and it leaves the viewer with an experience that will not fade.",1049587200,,1229,4.936893203883495
1738199,4,B00006AGHD,"The initial, basic plot of INSOMNIA is fairly conventional.  Al Pacino, a tired, grizzled cop, and his partner, come to Alaska to help solve a particularly heinous murder.  They're chasing a psycho.  Right there is enough story for many movies.
But this movie isn't satisfied with anything conventional.  When Pacino comes close to capturing the bad guy, he makes a HUGE mistake and then makes the bigger mistake of covering up for himself...and is witnessed in this crime by the murderer himself.  Thus, Pacino must now track the murderer to also prevent his secret from getting out.  Does this mean killing the murderer?
The movie is set in Alaska, during the time of year when the sun isn't setting.  Pacino can't get to sleep, and his guilt-ridden insomnia seeps into his performance in a nearly tangible way.  We see his ever increasing weariness.  He's a good cop who may have taken some shortcuts in the past, but we sense that he's smart and on the right side.  His mistake was an accident followed by a lapse in judgement.  But as his weariness covers him, we feel his despair for his soul.
It's rare to see a ""crime"" movie that delves so deeply into the psyche of its main characters.  This is truly a great Pacino performance...he doesn't go over the top, and we understand once again why he's one of our greats.  Robin Williams excellently plays the psycho-killer.  He's not as creepy as he was in ONE HOUR PHOTO, but he is very effective, and makes an unusual foil for Pacino.  Hillary Swank plays the local law officer who admirers Pacino, even as she begins to question his story.  Martin Donovan plays Pacino's partner in a small part that he carries off VERY well.  This guy needs more high profile parts.
The movie doesn't move at a very brisk pace, but for intelligent, adult movie goers, it is jam-packed with psychological action. And there is very nice chase scene about halfway through, where Pacino is pursuing Williams over a river covered with logs.  It's something we've not seen in a movie before.  The whole movie is pretty unique, in fact, and I highly recommend it!",1048118400,,2096,4.693150684931507
1738200,4,B00006AGHD,"Insomnia is of course a remake of a Norwegian film starring Stellan Skarsgard, directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg in 1997 but as much as this may make me a heathen to European film culture, I must confess to having never seen the original. However, thanks to one of my good friends (Steve, take a bow) I was lucky enough to see the UK premier of Insomnia as the closing movie of the 2002 Edinburgh film festival and lucky enough to see and hear the Director Christopher Nolan say a few words about this fine movie.
Opening with incredibly stunning cinematography of Alaskan ice fields, haggard L.A police detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and his partner Hep Eckhart (Martin Donovan) arrive in America's most northerly city to help solve the brutal killing of a teenage girl. Met by a local Detective (Hilary Swank) who openly hero-worships Dormer and his successful career as a Detective, Pacino's character sets about showing the local hicks how it's done. However, it soon transpires that Dormer is only in Alaska in the first place to avoid an ongoing criminal investigation by police Internal Affairs back in Los Angeles and it is not long before his investigation into the Alaskan girl's murder goes horribly wrong. Troubled by his conscience and the never-ending daylight of an Alaskan summer Dormer prays for sleep.
For many people that have seen either of Christopher Nolan's previous two movies (Following and Memento) Insomnia may seem like an odd choice; it's a 'mainstream' Hollywood movie (Warner Brothers studio), it is told in a linear timeframe and it's a remake. However, there must have been obvious attractions apart from the budget and his paycheck. First off, Stephen Soderbergh, who successfully makes mainstream movies with an Indie heart, oversaw production and secondly there was the chance to work with great actors such as Pacino, Swank and Robin Williams, although at this point I have to add that I believe Williams was totally miscast and made an unconvincing villain.
There are some wonderful scenes in this movie, including a nightmare like chase over hundreds of floating logs and the hunt for the killer in a freezing fog. It is also a movie that allows it's stars to shine and this is undoubtedly Pacino's best role (and best movie for many a year) and it is a pleasant change to see him with a decent script in an intelligent movie instead of hamming it up in the likes of The Devil's Advocate, alongside walking surfboard Keanu Reeves. This movie will also undoubtedly and deservedly enhance the careers and reputations of both Director Christopher Nolan and Hilary Swank, who both produce work of depth and subtlety. However, I also feel that much of the credit for what is a beautiful photographed and well-written movie should go to Wally Pfister and (for what is an excellent adapted screenplay) to Hilary Seitz. Insomnia is an excellent movie made by a very modest, very talented young British movie Director. Be warned though, you probably need an IQ to fully appreciate it.",1047254400,,3013,4.921414538310413
1738201,4,B00006AGHD,"It is a nice follow-up installment after the unique psychological thriller - Memento. Chris Nolan can surely saved his seat in the mainstream with this good work and we do need this talent out of the at-times boring industry.
But in my opinion, it could still be more better. Chris Nolan should shed more lights on the impact of suffering from insomnia that affected Will Domer as in Memento did to Leonard Shelby's amnesia. In addition, the ending sequence could extend longer and look at the intensity between the three characters, whereby will be more satisfying.

The chase cross the river is the best moment of the film, nicely crafted and shooted.

1738203,4,B00006AGHD,"In between the Godfathers I&II, Francis Ford Coppola came out with a wonderful movie called ""The Conversation"". Though not as groundbreaking as either Godfather film, ""The Conversation"", in my mind, was one of the better movies from the 70's. I feel the same way about ""Insomnia"". Though not as revolutionary as ""Memento"", it is still a fine film in its own right and should not be compared to it. I mention this because a lot of people seem to unfairly criticize it as well as director Christopher Nolan because it's not ""Memento II"".
By revealing early on in the film who the bad guy is, ""Insomnia"" adds a nice twist to the suspense genre. The suspense is held up by the protagonist's inner conflict of right and wrong. As you probably know, Al Pacino plays an L.A. detective Will Dormer who is brought Alaska to investigate a murder. It's also a chance for Dormer to escape some professional problems he is dealing with back home. Accompanying Dormer is Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan), his partner from L.A. who can potentially make things worse for Dormer back home. Through a sequence of events, the problems that face Dormer back home are minimized, but not without consequences. The murderer in Alaska now has something on Dormer and wants to negotiate. What will Dormer do? These pressures coupled with Alaska's white nights keep Dormer up at night. The whole thing induces quite a bit of tension. Al Pacino is his usual amazing self.

Al Pacino is good as Detective Will Dormer who is after a killer (Robin Williams who is surprisingly effective in his role) and the two are great together in their game of cat & mouse.  Hilary Swank however I felt was not effective at all until the climax of the film and for the most part was wasted in her role.  While the original Insomnia (which can be found as a Criterion Collection DVD) I find superior to this remake, this film is fantastic on it's own.

This movie was not at all a disappointment though. Robin Williams was very fun to watch, and seeing him play as a psychopathic murderer for a change kept me as the viewer interested. Hilary Swank is also a brilliant actress and it was good to see her as a woman again! (Boys Don't Cry) Good movie, great acting, and well directed. I give it four stars out of 5.

1738208,4,B00006AGHD,"Having seen the 1997 Norwegian film of the same name, I was eager to see how the American-ized version of ""Insomnia"" would play out.  Without delving too far into the comparisons that have been thoroughly detailed in prior reviews, I will say that this is one of the finer examples of how to film a remake.
This version of ""Insomnia"" takes place in a remote Alaskan port city, and revolves around the murder of a young girl.  However, as the movie unfolds, the murder slowly becomes only a small piece of a much more expansive, provoking, intense character drama.
From a cinematographical perspective, the haunting beauty of Alaska is captured perfectly.  In a way unique when compared to other films, the landscape is intertwined with the plot, further exposing the loneliness and isolation, while paradoxically highlighting its stark contrast with murder, death, and psychological demons.  The sequence of the hunt/shooting amidst a thick, impenetrable fog is riveting and conveys a high level of tension, as the viewer shares in the disorientation the fog creates.
""Insomnia"" is driven by characters and acting, and a strong cast is assembled.  Al Pacino - as expected - is wonderful in his portrayal of the world-weary city cop who escapes an Internal Affairs investigation by coming to investigate this murder.  In many ways, we have seen Mr. Pacino in this role on numerous occasion, and he demonstrates this with the comfortable ease in which he carries his role.  However, as his sleep-deprivation - caused by the long hours of daylight - intensifies, Mr. Pacino takes his character to a remarkable next level, as he battles to cover his questionable investigative practices and battle the psychological demons tied to similar practices in cases being investigated by Internal Affairs back in Los Angeles.  As a viewer, you can empathize with his character, while at the same time watch in amazement as he struggles to keep himself from completely unraveling.
Robin Williams is equally strong as the author-turned-murderer.  Like Mr. Pacino, we have seen Mr. Williams in roles similar to this, and yet he is so good at pulling it off that you couldn't see any other person carrying such a role.  His quiet, brooding character is psychologically scary; one senses that a violent, psychotic rage is bubbling just beneath his placid exterior.  Also, Mr. Williams uses his comedic facial reactions to maximize the creepiness of his character.  A couple of times he flashes a muted smile that subtly conveys the twisted pleasure he has in his cat-and-mouse game with Mr. Pacino's character.  He is subdued, but brilliant, in this role.
Hilary Swank also shines as the young, impressionable cop who ultimately uncovers Mr. Pacino's attempts to cover up the accidental shooting of his partner.  She wonderfully evolves from one overcome with ""hero-worship"" in working with Mr. Pacino's character to one disheartened and mildly angry when she finds that her ""idol"" isn't who he is cracked up to be.  Ms. Swank more than adequately holds her own in sharing the screen with Mr. Pacino and Mr. Williams, which is no small feat.
The climatic ending to the film is perhaps slightly cliched in its quick tying up of loose storylines, but it plays well here.  In its progression, you weren't quite sure how things were going to be resolved after the teenage suspect is arrested (falsely) for murder.  One would almost have the sense that the movie could have ended with several loose ends hanging, allowing the viewer to ponder the outcome.  But, there was instead the dramatic shootout, which ultimately was a satisfying resolution and conclusion to the film.
All told, ""Insomnia"" was a very solid, quiet, tense drama that is worth the time to see.  I give it a four-star rating, and recommend it to anyone seeking a good character-driven movie that is free of overwhelming special effects and action sequences.

1738232,4,B00006AGHD,"This finely wrought remake of the Norwegian film of the same name (1997)--an excellent film by the way--is something close to a thriller masterpiece flawed only by a too-hurried resolution.  Christopher Nolan, whose strikingly original Memento (2000) is among the best films made in recent years, planned this out very carefully, tying up most of the loose ends without relying on any phony motivation, which we sometimes see in passionate cop dramas.  However, the guns blazing at the end was a cheap way out of this psychologically complicated story.  Still, I think we can overlook that small fault since the rest of the film is so very well done.
The incomparable Al Pacino gives a mesmerizing performance as Los Angeles police detective Will Dormer who is sent with his partner north to Alaska ostensibly to help in a murder investigation.  However we quickly learn that being out of town may help him and his partner avoid an Internal Affairs investigation to which Dormer may be vulnerable.  By the way, ""dormir"" in French means ""to sleep,"" which is something Dormer does not do for six days, which is very close to the edge of human tolerance.  Indeed Dormer's last line in the film is ""Just let me sleep.""
Pacino is supported by Robin Williams as Walter Finch, a morally-deranged mystery writer who doesn't appear until the film is about half over.  He makes up for keeping us waiting with a dramatic performance that will curl your toes.  He is even more despicable than Bjorn Floberg was in the Norwegian film.  Not only is Robin Williams's appearance subtly altered and his demeanor strange, even his voice is not the same.  He is a long way from Good Morning, Vietnam (1987) and Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), but I think this is, in a more modest way, one of his best performances.
Also featured is Hilary Swank, whom you should see in Boys Don't Cry (1999) if you haven't, as Ellie Burr, an ingenue Alaskan detective in awe of the master cop from the big city.  Notable in a modest role is Jonathan Jackson as Randy Stetz, a high schooler with a chip on his shoulder.  I also liked the brief appearance by Katharine Isabelle, who played the murder girl's trampy girlfriend.
The key psychological question in both films is why does Will Dormer decide to cover up the accidental shooting?  In director Erik Skjoldbjaerg's 1997 film the answer is human nature.  That certainly worked, but was not enough for Nolan, and so he gives us Dormer's Internal Affairs problems back in L.A. as further motivation.  This works very well for two reasons: One, it is convincing.  Recall his spontaneous confession to the hotel clerk (Maura Tierney).  And two, the cop problems in Los Angeles are right out of the headlines of recent years.  They are real.  Nolan even has Ellie find a copy of the Los Angeles Times with one of the stories on the front page.
The next psychological question is, is the villain a serial killer in the making?  If he is, then Dormer must stop him regardless of his own problems.  And therein lies the internal conflict of the film so well projected by Al Pacino.  We know that there is something more than the midnight sun to account for Dormer's disintegration.  He is a flawed cop.  Like some of his real life counterparts in L.A. and elsewhere he took it upon himself, by falsifying evidence, to administer justice to a man he knew was guilty.  When he did that, he knew (and this is something he teaches Ellie) that he had lost his integrity as a cop.  The temptation to frame somebody we know is guilty of a horrendous crime is very great and many of us would fall into it.
Since I cannot discuss the ending here in any concrete way, let me just say that if Nolan had really taken his time with the ending he might have had Dormer simply murder the villain and face the consequences (or even commit suicide).  But I suspect Nolan believed that the heroic character of his star would have been compromised.  In Skjoldbjaerg's film the police detective actually shoots the dog to obtain the spent bullet he needs.  In Nolan's film the dog is already dead.  I think this minor blush of character actually taints Nolan's film to some small degree and leads Nolan down the path to the Hollywood ending to come.  But judge for yourself
One final point.  A lot can be gotten out of a single camera shot.  This is something that Nolan does very well.  A case in point is the shot on the plastic evidence bag holding the bullet that Dormer picks up in the lab.  Nolan has the camera show us the words on the bag, ""chain of custody,"" and he has the camera linger long enough for us to read them.  This nice touch reminds us that THAT very chain of custody is being compromised, another echo of real life criminal investigations from recent years in L.A.
See this for Al Pacino, at his best here, one of the great stars of our era whose ability to command the screen is second to none.",1042761600,3,4901,4.593103448275862

Williams is a maniacal presence, proving again that the actor can play against type and control his acting chops without going off on tangents.  Swank, in a thankless role as a rookie local cop, makes the best of the character's essence as she lovingly learns from Pacino's character.  And Al Pacino hasn't been this good in years - his ""HOO-HAW"" inflections from ""Scent of a Woman"" have faded, and he's all character here.

1738234,3,B00006AGHD,"Christopher Nolan is a talented director, no doubt. His previous film ""Memento"" is proof of that.  This film is proof as well, although it clearly shows the hallmarks of a Hollywood production: it proceeds cautiously and with great skill, but it feels like chartered territory: the villian (played with aplomb by Robin Williams) has to explain his motivations, thereby robbing the film of a little mystery, and the films ends in a way that is too rudimentary, too conventional for a film of this caliber. Ultimately, these flaws (and a few others) make ""Insomnia"" less satisfying than it could be. The fault is not necessarily Mr. Nolan's; it could very well lie with the screenwriter or, what is more likely, with the producers and the distributor. When ""foreign"" filmmakers come to Hollywood (Nolan is British), they are often ""forced"" to make more conventional films.
But even with its conventional elements, ""Insomnia"" is about as skillful in its execution as a film can be.  It's tense and captivating, and the performances all around are praiseworthy.  Pacino gives all the hot-blooded gusto we normally associate with him, but it's toned down successfully, which helps to strengthen the heaviness and lingering exhaustion that the murder investigation (which is the film's subject) entails. The setting is perfect: Nolan takes the Alaskan climate and washes it beautifully with gray, blue, white, and green hues, with a never-ending, penetrating, suffusing light that renders Pacino an insomniac and that gives weight to the film's central themes. It's highly intelligent without being emotionally empty. Nolan understands nuance, and he has an uncanny ability to make the best out of his material.
I cannot rate this film too highly because I felt it ultimately underwhelms with its conventions, but, by the same token, I will admit that I was taken aback by the ardor, skill, and technical assurance with which Nolan tells this story. Few films tie the strands together as well as this one does; even fewer match the visual language as precisely to the subject matter.  It's an achievement, even if I kept feeling, particularly at the end of the film, that I've seen it before, only because Hollywood is better at repackaging the same elements instead of originating new ones.
On the DVD itself: a good transfer, with a crips image and sound. Particularly appealing is a special feature in which Nolan discusses the film in the sequence in which it was shot -- now there is something original!",1041897600,3,2502,5.0508474576271185
1738235,5,B00006AGHD,"A couple of Hollywood legends are in top form and a newcomer director proves his first mind-bender wasn't a fluke.  This movie revolves around Will Dormer (Al Pacino at his dreary best) who has come to Alaska with his partner to investigate a rather brutal murder.  A girl was beaten senseless but than the killer carefully cleaned up the corpse to hide his deed.  But just as Will is on to him, he accidently (or was it an accident) shoots his partner while chasing the killer in the fog.  Then, the killer and Will begin a game of wits, a taunt cat and mouse game that pits each others souls, and lives, on the line.  Will past comes into play, and the killers real intentions.
The film is made ever the more suspenseful by the razor sharp directing of Christopher Nolan, the mind behind last years ""Memento.""  He gives the film a sense of wild motion, to simulate the emotions and the slowly slipping mind of Dormer, who cannot get an ounce of sleep becasue of the 24 hour sunlight of Alaskas summer.  He also gets the best out of his actors, who all are in their best mode for movie making.  We don't only know the characters from the expertly written script, but also from the actors expressions, gestures and vocal inflections.  In other words, you don't need the well-written script to get the characters emotions and personality.
Al Pacino is the best part of this movie.  His perfect portrayal of the conflicted Dormer goes down as one of the best performances he has turned in.  Though he will proably be forgotten, he should at least be considered by the Academy for his work in this film.  ot to mention director Christopher Nolan and the sinister Robin Williams, who  turns in a truly creepy performance in his role as a small town writer.",1041465600,,1752,4.54140127388535

1738237,2,B00006AGHD,"After seeing the masterpiece ""Memento"" and the highly interesting ""Following"" from Chris Nolan, I expected so much.  What I got was incredibly disappointing.  The movie is not unwatchable, but if Memento was a ""10"" on the originality scale, this turkey was a ""1.""  I won't spoil the plot (actually, there is nothing of note to spoil anyway)... but this is a tired ""nearly good cop chases bad guy, bad guy catches on to cop's Achille's heel, and cop must deal with being compromised"" kinda flick.
Lacking action, this is a talky thriller that could bore the pants off you.  Only one scene with Pacino chasing Williams over a log-jammed stream was interesting.  Everything else seemed like a bad rerun.
Robin Williams did do a good job of acting, and I agree that Hillary Swank's performance was top notch...but this was not enough to save the movie.  After 5 minutes of watching the disheveled, sleepless Al Pacino, I was thinking the movie would have been more watchable with anyone else. (Was Guy Pierce busy?)  For being an insomniac, Pacino sleptwalked through this role.  But even good acting can never overcome a mediocre story, and that's what you're in for, my friends.
If you feel tempted to get this, do yourself a favor and get Pacino's ""Sea of Love"" instead.  Perhaps Chris Nolan should have watched this one first, to see how this kind of movie could have been made, and what sort of compelling performance Pacino can deliver with the right material.",1041033600,4,1462,4.792828685258964

Featuring wonderful performances from Hilary Swank (""Boys Don't Cry""), Maura Tierny (TV's ""ER"") and the incredible Robin Williams (""Good Will Hunting""), this movie is not the mystery one would expect. You know from the outset that Williams is the killer, and the drama comes from Pachino's struggle to capture him, especially after his exhaustion causes him to make an unspeakable mistake. Williams is best known as a comedian, but when he takes on dramatic roles like this, you get to see how good an actor he really is.
Director Christopher Nolan (""Memento"") is becoming the master of a new breed of movies that aren't quite film noir but have enough in common with that genre to compare. And favorably, too. As in ""Memento"" he uses the trick of showing you only pieces of the puzzle in an odd order right up until the end, where it all comes together. Nolan has earned a spot on my slim list of filmmakers I'll give my theater admission price to no matter what.

Many of the changes are typically American--the ambiguities in character motivation are removed and the ending is far more moralistic--yet I found it to be the equal of the original.

Al Pacino, in the lead role, is a joy to watch as usual. I always find myself enjoying his performances, even in substandard films (which this isn't.) Robin Williams is surprisingly good; perhaps dramatic roles are his true calling (I've never found him funny.) Hilary Swank plays the local rookie who is teamed with Pacino's veteran character. Katharine Isabelle (GINGER SNAPS) appears in a smaller but significant role as the murdered girl's best friend.  And one can't talk about this film without mentioning the beautiful location, which the director and cinematographer take full advantage of.
This isn't your typical ""police stalking a killer"" story.  We find out fairly early who the murderer is, and the protagonist even meets him face-to-face.

The thriller is taut and complex and takes place in a new and interesting setting.
Too bad there was an original movie of Insomnia, that takes place in Norway, that has much of the same elements but also some great differences. If one has seen both, the comparisons & contrasts are impossible to avoid. Al Pacino gives a terrific performance as the bleary-eyed sleepless detective, but Stellan Skarsgard in the Norwegian version is no slouch at acting either.
I won't go into detail on the changes and diversions in both films. I recommend that movie buffs see both, as they are different films, despite sharing relatively the same story.
I find the European version is more enigmatic, not drawn in bold black and whites, and with a feeling of life's quixotic accidents. The central crime/cover-up by the detective is motiveless in the Norwegian version, in the American film there is an added subtext that either deepens or makes simpler the detective's actions, depending upon your point of view. The byplay between the murderer and the detective is more complex in the American, and more subtle and less defined in the European. Pacino is a man with troubles, Skarsgard is a troubled man.
But finally, the big difference is in the ending. I was disappointed that the American version opted to end everything in a typically American fashion, with a bullet, and all strands wrapped up in a bow. The American film is inexorable and predestined, the Norwegian film more open to happenstance and accident. The European version leaves the end enigmatically unresolved. I won't say which is best. That, each viewer will have to decide for themselves.

1738257,4,B00006AGHD,"Insomnia proves that Christopher Nolan, along with Steven Soderbergh, Paul Thomas Anderson, and David Lynch, is one of the few ""auteur"" directors in Hollywood.  A movie that few directors would want to tackle, Insomnia is a dark psychological thriller set in a literal barren landscape of Alaska.  Nothing is what it seems on the surface.  Al Pacino is brilliant and reveals the complexity of his character in the role of a cop under investigation by internal affairs for misconduct sent to Alaska to help with a murder investigation.  The cinematography is absolutely astounding.  The bright visuals of the outside giving a feeling of boundless nothingness to the world while the dark, dank, closed interiors emphasize Pacino's mental state perfectly throughout the film.  Although slightly more conventional than Memento, Nolan's neo-noir masterpiece, in Insomnia he has crafted a tight thriller emphasizing the atmosphere of dread that pervades the entire film.  The film is somewhat slow at times, but since the film is intended to be a police-procedural it must show police work as what it is most of the time.  It is a painstakingly slow process whereby detectives actually have to think and contemplate their next move.  I believe Nolan also slows the film down to force the audience to process the information along with the police.  This tone and style serves in direct contrast to the kinetic fast pace of Memento where one's perception of the character's and their motivations are changed after each scene so you've barely processed the information before that info has become void or altered.  Obviously Nolan was attempting to put the audience into Leonard's head.

1738258,2,B00006AGHD,"Insomnia (Christopher Nolan, 2002)

I hate to think it's true, but having now seen Chris Nolan's other two films, Following and Insomnia, I'm starting to think Memento--one of the finest films ever made--was a one-shot deal.

Insomnia, based on Erik Skoldbjaerg's brilliant 1997 film starring Stellan Skarsjard (of Good Will Hunting and The Glass House). Nolan's version--executive-produced by professional remake mangler Steven Soderbergh, who should be boiled in his own juices for what he did to Solaris--puts an on-the-edge Al Pacino in Skarsjard's role, and Pacino is the best thing about this movie hands-down. It's the first time since Dog Day Afternoon that he's played a character who's this unhinged both in his head and by the events around him, and we, the viewing audience, have sorely missed Mr. Crazy Pacino, thankyouverymuch. Unfortunately, Pacino is not given nearly as much to work with as was Skarsjard, and what he is given is as anemic as a nineteenth-century hypochodriac prescribed a convalescence of a length to be determined. (If only someone had done the same for Nolan.)

All of the motivation of Skarsjard's character has disappeared (some for the sake of'-ugh'-'streamlining,' and some because American audiences, according to Hollywood, would have a real problem seeing a character with some of Skarsjard's character's nastier qualities portrayed in anything like a positive light), all of the ambiguity of two key scenes (the shooting in the fog and the ride to the dump) have disappeared, a key scene showing the depth to which the detective has sunk is lessened in its intensity, and most heretically, the ending is destroyed, all of which lead to a film that, had it been made on its own, may have been watchable. As a remake, however, it pales, and greatly, in comparison to the brilliant force unleashed upon us by Erik Skjoldbaerg in 1997. **",1038873600,4,1879,5.11400651465798

But it seems that this film was shot to make you have empathy with the lead character, a cop who has insomnia in a land where the sun never sets. Pacino does a credible job as a cop who really needs a good snooze, but all the pacing did for me was make me want to nap myself, and that's the problem.
The disappointment is that I was looking forward to the movie, especially the interaction with the killer. This is not the first movie that Al Pacino plays a cop who verbally confronts the bad guy before the inevitable violent end. He did it in ""Heat"" with Robert DiNiro, and in that picture there was blazing chemistry. Once again, maybe it's the sleep thing, but I really think the whole insomnia issue prevents any real electricity from happening.
I would have liked to have seen the movie redone without the whole lack of sleep thing. It drains the energy from the film.

This film is as good as ""Memento"" but has a more ""traditional"" storyline, also, it hasn't the suspense and mystery that ""Memento"" had. Let's say it's a drama, but not less interesting. There are no clichs, or archetypical characters, no all-goodies, no all-baddies,...only people, with flaws, who commit mistakes, who lie, who let themselves go because of rage, fear, anger, etc.
Al Pacino, one of the greatest actors of all time- period....the guy who has starred in ""The Godfather"", ""Dog Day Afternoon"", ""Taxi Driver"", et al. gives a knowing performance has the tough-as-nails, ""superstar"", L.A. cop who travels with his partner, on an assignment to Alaska, in order to help the local police to capture the murderer of a beautiful 17 year old girl.
Hilary Swank plays a young local policewoman, sort of infatuated by this ""legendary"" professional's experience (Pacino) and technique, which she has already studied at the Police Academy.
Last but not least, Robin Williams playing an unsympathetic ""heavy"", with a skill no one would have ever thought of. His voice inflection has changed completely from the usual clown we're used to, his way of looking, restraint,.... everything new for us audiences, he really did a very fine job.
I'd read the critics' reviews before watching this film, and although they were good, anyway, I didn't expect it would be as good a movie, with such a surprising plot- when the movie begins, you think it will take a very different ""path"" from the one that it really takes, unpredictable, such as real life is.

He's terrific.  Whenever he leaves behind the comedy and is just your bare bones actor he never disappoints, and he won't here.  I love seeing him in strong, non-comedic roles, it just shows his wonderful range and the broad spectrum of his abilities.  But that's all the good I can say about this movie.  Al Pacino is tired, and I'm not sure that was just his acting for the movie.  Pacino is terrific in so much, I wonder what happened here, and Hilary Swank is just there.  She plays a cop who is uncovering Al Pacino's character and is ho-hum in doing so.  So I suggest this movie only for Williams' performance, if you can make it through the muck of the whole picture.

1738262,4,B00006AGHD,"From the time that Al Pacino became an international superstar with his gripping performance in ""Dog Day Afternoon"" he has held film audiences in rapt attention with his inner intensity.  He often will not even say a word; the tension looms as a coil ready to spring.  Pacino generates interest, speaking or silent.
In ""Insomnia"" Pacino plays a well known but highly troubled Los Angeles detective assigned with partner Marty Dawson to travel to a small Alaskan town to help solve a murder which has local police baffled.  When he arrives Pacino is overwhelmed when energetic rookie officer Hilary Swank, determined to be the best in her profession, idolizes him to the point of knowing his cases and even notable quotes, in the manner of a baseball fan knowing the statistics and famous games of a favorite player.
Alaska is known for its seemingly interminable alternating periods of sun and darkness.  Pacino arrives during the sun period.  As a result, he finds it impossible to sleep.  As the story develops we learn that it is more than the sun, however, bothering Pacino.  His own past and present career as an officer reside in indefinite turmoil.
Pacino is in Alaska to solve the murder of an attractive 17-year-old girl.  When suspicion shifts from her abrasive, physically abusive high school boyfriend to a local older pulp mystery writer, the story heats up.
When Pacino and police cohorts are seeking to corner the murder suspect in a field shrouded in fog, Pacino unleashes a shot and kills his partner.  He is happy to leave the impression that the retreating suspect killed his Los Angeles police sidekick, but his world is jolted when, during one of his many sleepless nights, he receives a call from the detective writer, who reveals that he saw Pacino fire the shot that killed his partner.
Robin Williams, who made his mark in rollicking comedy, turns in a superb effort as the troubled writer who believes that, by making a compact with Pacino, they can both emerge free of suspicion.  The wily but troubled Williams theorizes that all Pacino needs to do is direct suspicion back to the boyfriend, pretend to solve the case, and return to Los Angeles, leaving him unscathed with a patsy being convicted of the crime.  He explains that he did not really mean to kill the young woman anymore than Pacino meant to kill his partner.  Accordingly, they should both be free of any taint of guilt.
The picture and the blackmail offer from Williams becomes more complicated when it is revealed that Pacino was being investigated by the internal affairs department in Los Angeles and believed his own partner would be a crucial element in bringing him down.  So did he or did he not kill his partner deliberately?  Does Pacino ultimately know?
The imaginative script by Hilary Seitz keeps viewers guessing until its conclusion.  Swink, a recent Best Actress Oscar winner, does a superb job as the gung ho small town Alaska police officer who begins figuring things out on her own pertaining to both Pacino and Williams.",1037145600,3,3032,4.848837209302325
1738263,5,B00006AGHD,"A remake, as Hollywood has proven to us time and time again, is a bad idea, especially if the original was just fine the way it was. This is why the task of turning the critically acclaimed Scandinavian original into an American film starring three Oscar-winning actors is not as easy as it seems. However, the film's in good hands; Chris Nolan, the amazingly talented director who gave us the headache-inducing (but in a good way) ""Memento,"" knows how to craft a good film without playing down to the audience.
What made the original so good was its cinematography. The camera was a character; like a fallible narrator, angles could not be trusted; you had to second guess every frame. The cold Scandinavian landscape was the perfect setting for a film which delved into a crime, but also into the mind of the one investigating it. I was afraid the subtle nuances of the film would be lost in the American version: the telling gaze, the sun through the curtains, the metaphor of the fog. But, thankfully, Nolan kept most of the elements in his version, particularly the cinematic trope of the penetrating gaze (as a voyeuristic tool).
For those who are more used to multiple action scenes, you might be disappointed. There's quite a bit of dialogue, the events aren't explicitly stated all the time, and the audience has to, in a way, participate in the film. However, the performances are top notch. Robin Williams, whom we all know as the silly funny man, has managed to master the art of subtlety. His tone, facial expressions, and eyes convey more than can be expressed with words. Al Pacino, a little older than Stellan Skarsgrd, the actor who plays the protagonist in the original, pulls off a fine performance alongside Swank.
One disappointing element is the ending. Keeping in mind this is an American film, Nolan opted for the conventional everything-will-be-tied-up-explictly ending, which seems forced, especially when you consider the subtlety that informs the rest of the film. But this is still a fine film that is miles ahead of many other thrillers that Hollywood is churning out. If you're curious, do check out the original ""Insomnia,"" as it is, overall, more skillfully done.",1036972800,,2196,4.874331550802139

1738266,4,B00006AGHD,"Director Christopher Nolan made a sensational splash with the indie hit ""Memento"", earning him this shot at the big time.  For the most part, he proved himself up to the task.  ""Insomnia"" provides a multilayered psychological thriller where two distinct storylines are interwoven in the character of Will Dormer (Al Pacino).
The workup is a bit contrived, with Dormer coming to Alaska from LA to help out an old buddy with a murder investigation as he is himself being investigated by internal affairs.  This serves as a foundation for the two storylines.  The first is the animosity that develops between Dormer and his partner, who wants to cut a deal with internal affairs.  The second, of course, is the murder investigation.  After Dormer accidentally (?) shoots his partner while chasing the suspect in dense fog, the psychological games begin.  Local detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), who is fawning all over Dormer and has read all his books on detective work, begins to suspect that her hero may have feet of clay.
The psychodrama becomes intense as Dormer is confronted with communications from his killer nemesis Walter Finch (Robin Williams), while suspicions swirl around the death of his partner.  Add to this his inability to get any sleep in Alaska's perpetual daylight and you have a man driven to the absolute brink.
Nolan does an excellent job of shooting this film and the editing intensifies the psychological tension.  The cinematography is also superb, aided by the majesctic Alaskan and British Columbian locations.  While the interaction between Dormer and Finch is unlikely, the symbiotic relationship that develops is fascinating and Nolan squeezes every psychological tingle that can be wrung from it.
Pacino is masterful as the insomniac cop who has made certain ethical compromises in his career in the name of justice.  He looks so terrible that he must have been purposely depriving himself of sleep to increase the realism of the character.  Pacino gives Dormer (an interesting play on the latin dormire, ""to sleep"", a dormer is the window of a sleeping room) a hard edge that gradually erodes as he becomes more sleep deprived, blurring the distinction between good and evil.
Robin Williams seems to be trying to shed his nice guy image with back to back wackos.  He follows up his sociopathic performance in ""1 Hour Photo"" with this character who is a sort of sinister pragmatist.  Williams is at his best when he is pushing sanity's limits, whether that be in zany comedy or maniacal mayhem, which is precisely why he was wrong for this part.  This character is far too calculating and controlled for Williams talents and the part was also much too physical for him.  He is just not convincing as a cold blooded killer and tough guy.  That is not to say it was a bad performance, just the wrong actor.  Hilary Swank unfortunately doesn't have much to do in a film that is dominated by Pacino and Williams.
This is an excellent big budget debut for Nolan and another terrific performance by Pacino.  The suspense and pace are first rate and despite the contrivances, it delivers.  I rated it an 8/10.  Definitely not a snoozer.",1036800000,3,3165,4.922787193973635

1738295,4,B00006AGHD,"Very few films have the courage to face only one aspect of the human condition and to build a plot based on that.  Director Chris Nolan takes the Norwegian book of the same name and transforms it into a metaphorical casting of light that illuminates the inevitable results of what happens when integrity is cast aside for expediency.  Al Pacino plays L. A. detective Will Dormer, who is called to aid in a murder investigation of a young high school girl in Alaska.  During the course of the film, the viewer learns that Dormer in under investigation by the L. A. internal affairs unit for having planted evidence to convict a sex criminal.  Dormer is the sort of scum-hating cop who feels that the ends sometimes justifies the means in keeping creeps off the streets.  Unlike other cop movies with a similar theme, Pacino invests his Dormer character with the sort of world-weary crisis of conscience that he had shown before as the aging Michael Corleone in GODFATHER III. Director Nolan uses the magnificent colors and sights of a land that knows no night to represent the brightness of a moral compass that Dormer sought, even back in L. A., to put him back on track.  It is no surprise then that from the moment that he arrives in Alaska, he suffers from the insomnia of the title. As he tries to solve the murder of a young girl, he is reminded of his own failings on two levels.  First by the light of the landscape that by contrast points out his earlier moral shortcomings, then later by the appearance of the real killer, Will Finch, played effectively by Robin Williams, who in his most recent films seems determined to eschew the comedy of his youth in favor of dark roles just like this one. Dormer and Finch are moral dopplegangers, not so much as two sides of a criminal coin, but as a coin with only one side.  More than once, Finch points out that if an accidental killing results in a benefit to society, then the architect of that killing ought to be lauded, not punished, for it.  Pacino hears this argument and is strongly leaning to accepting it.  But like Raskolnikov in CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, Dormer is prodded by his conscience in the form of Hillary Swank, who plays a policewoman who is bright enough to learn that the hero cop of her youth may also be a cop who now finds himself on the same moral plane as any other killer who seeks to justify killing solely on the basis of expediency.  What emerges from INSOMNIA is a call that is as bright and clear as the shiny landscapes of Alaska.  Truth is a beacon of light whose only purpose is to dispel the darkness of the immorality of sin.  And when each of us is faced with the choice of living in light or darkness, then Dormer warns us to make the right choice, or we may lose our way.",1036195200,,2763,4.447524752475248
1738296,5,B00006AGHD,"I'm actually reviewing the ""Widescreen"" version of Insomnia. But had to use the Full Screen link (none available on the Widescreen page at the time of review).

I really enjoyed this film, which features excellent performances (IMO) by the three leads (Al Pacino, Hilary Swank, and Robin Williams, in a rare evil role).

Pacino really gives you the impression he has insomnia here, looking pretty ragged around the edges for much of the picture. It's almost impossible (for me) to not like a Pacino picture.  He's great in just about everything. And this is no exception.

The DVD's commentary tracks are rather unique. Director Nolan takes us through the film chronologically, in the order in which it was filmed, starting with Day 1 (which is Scene #111!).

The other commentaries are scene specific, which I like much better than having to watch the entire movie a second time just for the commentaries, which are oft times filled with silence.  I wish every DVD had commentaries like the ones on ""Insomnia"".  Excellent!

And how about that Easter Egg?!  Outstanding!  Clicking on that pencil next to Hilary in the ""Production Diaries"" area of the DVD will enable you to witness an avalanche that occurred during the film's production. The quick-thinking Wally Pfister (Insomnia's Director of Photography) was able to record the moment on video tape. We even get a glimpse of Hilary Swank at the end of this short clip, who comments on witnessing this unforseen event: ""It was so awesome!""

Pacino, Williams and Swank all deliver spectacular performances and Pacino is incredible as the ""respected"" high ranking detective who has terrible secrets only to accidentally get in deeper.  His consience keeps him 'awake' and his craggy face and tired eyesacks show it.  Williams is just as creepy and frighteningly clever in his role, never reminding you that he is also a comedian.

But now, Williams really outdoes himself when he takes on the role of...ruthless killer! The movie is called ""Insomnia"", a film with so much intensity and suspense that you would have to see it again and again! The direction of Christopher Nolan (""Memento"") is brilliant in every way possible! Williams is also paired up with fellow Academy Award winners Hilary Swank (Best Actress, 1999: ""Boys Don't Cry"") and the legendary Al Pacino (Best Actor, 1992: ""Scent of a Woman"") into bringing this thriller of Hitchcockian proportions to the big screen! ""Insomnia"" focuses on a seasoned veteran LAPD detective named Will Dormer (Pacino), who is invited to Nightmute, Alaska with his partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan), to head a murder case. Dormer teams up with an inexperienced, young detective named Ellie Burr (Swank) in order to find out who caused the murder and why. But during the case, Dormer finds himself and his investigation disrupted by an ever-shining midnight sun that wreaks sleep-depriving havoc on him. In other words, Dormer has inside of him what we call a ""body clock"". It could go off at any moment, on any day, and at any time as well. The case has also disrupted Dormer by personal guilt over a second crime that may be real...or a figment of his increasingly unstable conciousness. During the movie, the prime suspect in the murder case is a best-selling author named Walter Finch (Williams).

1738325,4,B00006AGHD,"Let's just get this out of the way, Insomnia is not as good as Memento. I mention this simply because most of my conversations about this film have started like this: ""What did you think of Insomnia?"" And the answer would go something like, ""It was good, but not as good as Memento."" Well I don't think that is fair to this film, the performers, or, in particular, Christopher Nolan. Memento is an exceptional film, if not a great film. If Nolan had tried to plug his Memento formula into his next project we would have got another Jackie Brown, I prefer Insomnia. So what do I think? Insomnia is a studio film (a good one at that), a step in the right direction, and it has Al Pacino (The MAN).
Disclaimer: Please read someone else's review for a plot summary. I'm not going to spoil, but I just want to talk about why I like it. So, why I like it. Well first, and most certainly foremost, this is first rate filmmaking. Christopher Nolan is a star. Momento was brilliant on several levels, but it was a gimic picture to a certain extent (see it if you haven't). By this rational it is also an innovative film, but that separates it from Insomnia, they shouldn't be compared. However Nolan puts his stamp on Insomnia, much like he did Momento, i.e. Nolan is a unique talant, not a pan in the wash. His pacing is masterful, his visual style is purposeful and consistent, his story is engaging, and he has Al Pacino.
Al Pacino. He hasn't been on the screen since Any Given Movie and it was well worth the wait. This DVD has a unique feature on the commentary track. The commentary follows the shooting schedule instead of the narrative. This allows the audience to see how Pacino works. It is a great special feature, as good as any I've seen. It goes without saying that Pacino is an amazing actor, but to be able to see how he evolves and molds his character is such a gift. Watch how the camera envades his personal space, watch how Pacino embraces it. I thought he was excellent in this film. The other heavies are good, but this is Pacino's movie. He carries it.

1738326,4,B00006AGHD,"In Insomnia, Al Pacino is an LA cop of dubious reputation who is called upon to investigate a crime in Alaska.  Some call this a more conventional effort from Memento director Christopher Nolan, yet it doesn't play like a standard thriller.  The landscape and especially the long days in Alaska are as much part of the film as the characters.  Pacino is a top notch investigator but is also a fish out of water away from the big city.  He becomes involved more directly as events occur, and there is a great deal of uncertainty as to how things really happened partway into the movie.  Enter Robin Williams, who plays a solitary writer who comes along to ""assist"" the investigation of a girl's death.
Williams has done great work dramatically before, and he fits his role in Insomnia perfectly; he plays off against Pacino very well.  Hilary Swank is a local cop, relegated to minor insignificant duties by her male colleagues, and she both idolizes Pacino's character as well as being a determined investigator on her own.

1738329,4,B00006AGHD,"The fascinating psychological thriller ""Insomnia"" is a remake of an excellent Norwegian movie released about five years ago. In large part, it succeeds in improving upon the original because it fleshes out the relationship between the main character and the killer he is pursuing.
Detective Will Dormer [Al Pacino] and his partner are dispatched to the far reaches of Alaska to help investigate the grisly murder of a young woman. Internal Affairs has them under investigation back in Los Angeles, and their trip seems to be part of a plan to get them out of the way for awhile. With the help of local detective Ellie Burr [Hilary Swank], the investigation starts out well, but soon Dormer is plagued by insomnia triggered by the lack of darkness during the Alaskan summer. After a couple of days, fatigue sets in, and he begins to falter. The situation gets much worse after a dreadful accident occurs during a stakeout. It isn't long before the killer [Robin Williams] begins to play a deadly cat and mouse game with him. [Note: Saying who plays the killer gives almost nothing of the plot away.]
The cast is uniformly excellent. Director Christopher Nolan, whose last film was the highly original thriller ""Memento"", again takes on the tricky concept of time. In this case, Dormer's insomnia causes him to lose track of time in a palce where there is no night. In the process, he also loses track of himself.
""Insomnia""s main theme is moral ambiguity, and Dormer's not knowing whether it's day or night serves to underscores that theme. [Everything is relative.] This is a sophisticated thriller for adults. Its few action scenes seem almost beside the point, as if they were placed there as an afterthought to make the movie more appealing to mainstream audiences.",1035072000,,1768,4.8966666666666665
1738330,5,B00006AGHD,"Much as I enjoyed Chris Nolan's ""Following"" and ""Memento"", he really pulls out all the stops with this third film. I saw the foreign film upon which this was based and, unusually, this is the better film.  (Usually American remakes of foreign films are total schlock but that is not true here.)  It has some key ingredients for achieving this though.  First off, a first rate script that no one has ""Hollywoodized."" Secondly, letting Al Pacino and Robin Williams loose with their talents on first rate material and, in Williams' case, against his usual type, was sheer genius.  The two are absolutely superb together.

Pacino is the anti-hero cop who investigates a murder case in Alaska while trying to cope with a partner (Martin Donovan) who is going to turn state's evidence against him when they return to LA.  Not only will this ruin his career but it might also release all the murderers Pacino's character put away in prison. The partners are trying to track down the villain, Williams.  Surprisingly though, instead of running, Williams' villain comes forward and plays with Pacino's character, preying upon his weaknesses.  Pacino is further handicapped by not being able to get any sleep because of a variety of factors but not the least of which is that he's not used to sunlight 24/7 which occurs in Alaska in the warmer weather.  Martin Donovan and Hillary Swank do very good work as the other detectives but it is hard to compare them against the sheer star power and magnetism of Pacino and Williams together. The murder case is actually not as important as the unravelling of these two men's characters.  Buy it. I did and it's not going anywhere!

They have been marketed the ""desire"" to consume this version and the monopolistic distribution mechanism is why this version has sold. Why didn't they put the original version's actors on the Dave Letterman, Jay Leno and the rest of the Hollywood re-marketing division shows?

Al Pachino as always mastered the part, to the best of his ability. Hillary Swank was very good, for the first time that I've seen.

Accidentaly shooting your partner doesn't really help much either.
Robin Williams is clearly into psychos lately. I didn't really think his performance in ""One Hour Photo"" was all that good, but in this movie he's got his act together. Al Pacino is pretty good in his part, although not as great as I have come to expect from him.

Watch him as he talks for long periods of time with wrinkles in his forehead that don't move one bit...watch his eyebrows raised from plastic surgery.  Truly amazing.  I was expecting much more than an A to B to C to D movie where you can see the ending coming from a mile away.

In the small, quaint city, Dormer is on pursuit for a psychological killer and fights with a faulty past. While searching for the madman, Dormer loses sleep due to the atmosphere and his personal guilt. The movie does a good job with the setting and the lush scenery is perfect for the story's mood. The film centers around the characters and it's surprising to see Al Pacino not make so much noise. It was great. Robin Williams in a different role and Hilary Swank was kicking major buttocks.

1738358,5,B00006AGHD,"Christopher Nolan's follow-up to MEMENTO is a more straight-forward thriller which serves as both an excellent tour-de-force of suspense in terrific form and re-establishment of Robin Williams' serious acting roles. But the main guy here is of course, the great Al Pacino, who gives another fantatsically compelling performance. The story, basically, is centered around Pacino hunting down a serial killer on the loose (Williams). Hey, at least Williams is breaking away from his ""funnyman"" sterotype and proves, at least with this, that he can be serious and still bring the same commanding M.O to any character on film. Hillary Swank also provides impressive supporting energy, helped with a sharp script. Not surprisingly, the score, very important addition in this genre, is a fantastic blend of slighty etheral tracks with downbeat percussions building up the tension. Director Nolan, having proven his coup-de-grace with the intracate stylistic MEMENTO, here works in more familiar action territory. That's not to say that the film is bereft of twists however, for there are numerous shockers and suprises along the way. A terrific film, and a must have on DVD.
Speaking of which, the DVD extra features are fantastic, with an interesting commentary by director Christopher Nolan, commentary by actor Hilary Swank, production designer Nathan Crowley, editor Dody Dorn, cinematograher Wally Pfister, and screenwriter Hillary Seitz, additional scene with commentary the doco ""Day for Night"" making of documentary, ""180 Degrees"": A Conversation with Christopher Nolan and Al Pacino, ""In the Fog"": Cinematography and production design and ""Eyes Wide Open"": The insomniac's world.

I gave this movie three stars simply because of the incredible lack of originality. It is obviously a complete ... of Skjoldbjaerg's film. If you have seen the Swedish film you would agree with me that this movie is far below the standards as a film than the original. Please, if you have already seen this movie, don't buy it.

1738361,5,B00006AGHD,"This review is divided to two parts . I warmly advice to read only the first part because I feel that the additional information I will provide in the second part , though not revealing , can damage the experience of ""Insomnia"".
Part I : The ""Insomnia"" experience .
---------------------------------------
In this section I would urge you not to extend the information you've gathered this far about the movie . I have had a hell of a ride seeing the film knowing almost nothing about it beforehand . That's why I think this is he best way to 'meet' the movie - completely unprepared . Letting yourself drift into the atmosphere and storyline will guaranty full satisfaction from a movie that is so good .
Nevertheless , if you're interested in something more ...
Part II : Some plot and characters details .
----------------------------------------------
""Insomnia"" refers to the lack of sleep Al Pacino suffers from due to troubled and disturbed conscience in addition to the phenomena of Alaska's white nights , where at a certain season of the year the sun does not set .
Al Pacino portrays the character of a near retirement cop that along with a partner arrive at Alaska in order to solve a murder case . That's all you should know about the plot .
Why would that short description bring you to the theatre or to buying the DVD version ? It probably wouldn't . But if I told you that his character is one of his most interesting and complicated of the last ten years ? Now , that sounds better and indeed is the case ! Ever since the superb ""Scent of a Woman"" never has Al Pacino managed to offer the viewer a smashing performance as he had demonstrated in the portrayal of Frank Slade . I believe that here , in the shoes of Will Dormer , Pachino finally continues the legacy of his so well-remembered Oscar winning character .
Yes , Pacino and virtually every other member of the cast deliver a great performance . Leave the names of the other actors unknown , if you haven't already discovered them , and prepare yourself for pleasant surprises . The story is hard and dark , yet bears in it a great promise , comfort and unmatched morality .
=====================================================================================
Take your wife/husband , take your kids if they are above 12 , this is surely an experience none of you will forget for quite sometime .",1033603200,2,2374,4.695443645083933
1738382,5,B00006AGHD,"This movie was excellent! Very original story with a couple of new twists compared to the original from 1997. Pacino plays such a convincing cop with problems of his own. And Williams was phenomenal, i was very surprised. How could I go without mentionning director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Following), possibly one of the best new directors of our time, or any. This entire film was crafted beautifully, the visuals of Alaska, the good storytelling, the great acting & of course the direction. This is one of my favorite movies of the year, and hopefully, it will be greatly considered when Oscar time comes around. Also see: Insomnia(1997-Criterion Collection) & One Hour Photo.",1033344000,,683,5.107142857142857
1738383,3,B00006AGHD,"This film is a good showcase for the director of ""Momento,"" but that doesn't hide the fact that this is another Hollywood retelling of a superior foreign film. I wish I was being cynical, but the faults of this picture are too obvious. This shouldn't have been a star vehicle. Yes, Robin Williams is effective, but you still watch this thinking ""Wow, this is Robin Willaims."" Second, the moral ambiguity and psychological complexity of the original is gone or smoothed over. You know in this one who is good and who is evil, and there is poetic justice for all. I didn't really care to see 1997's haunting thriller become another suspense movie which doesn't give its audience enough credit. I will say that I did enjoy it overall, and will probably purchase this disc. It can sit right next to my copy of the original ""Insomnia."" But while this one is just good, the original is great. Watch and compare.",1033257600,,905,4.627329192546584
1738384,5,B00006AGHD,"Anyone who managed to see Christopher Nolan's previous movie 'Memento' last year were lucky enough to view an instant cult classic.  Obviously others were equally impressed, for Nolan's first Hollywood effort assembles an impressive cast of established actors and up-and-coming stars.  Many were disappointed that Nolan's first movie after the groundbreaking 'Memento' was a re-make (of a small Norweigian film of the same name), yet I think it would be fair to say that most of these people cast aside any thoughts like that when they actually saw the movie.  Whilst on the surface this may seem like another routine cop thriller this is actually something that rewrites the genre into something a great deal more interesting.  The plot as L.A. cop Pacino and his partner flying out to Alaska and joining local officer Swank in her investigation into the murder of a young girl in the area.  However, this isn't exactly as you might think, with the killer being identified fairly rapidly after Pacino accidentally shoots his partner in a chase through the fog.
What this film has that other's don't is a director, actor and crew that seem to work in perfect unison and it's not often that you notice the photography or and the sound in a movie, but in 'Insomnia' you definitely will.  Pacino is superb as the weary cop, and has never looked as tired as he has here (hence the title), Swank proves that she is more than capable of crossing over to mainstream fare, and Williams is, despite what the critics have said, actually very good as the murderer.  It's also wonderful to see Maura Tierny (of 'ER' fame) and Katherine Isabelle, who was so good in 'Ginger Snaps', alongside the big names in a genuinely impressive movie.  Part of what makes this such an excellent film (so far possibly the film of the year) is Nolan, who directs with a surefire confidence, coming in close to his actors' troubled faces as if he's trying to read their thoughts.  In many ways it's similar to 'Memento', especially during the flashbacks that cleverly echo real life memory, or the close-up view of blood soaking into fabric like a dawning realisation.  In addition, the booming sound really makes you jump exactly where Nolan wants you to, and the photography of the gorgeous yet bleak Alaskan landscape is simply fantastic.  There's also some interesting theorising on destiny, justice and conscience, but Nolan wisely chooses not to push this in his audience's faces.  It's rare that a Hollywood movie is this intelligent, insightful or as plain enjoyable but 'Insomnia' is a prime example and will leave you gagging for the next Nolan picture.",1032998400,,2634,4.881165919282512
1738385,3,B00006AGHD,"This was a quality film, no doubt about it.  Christopher Nolan does a superb job of capturing phobias and psychological elements of characters with the obstacles he sets in play.  However, I think that in the case of ""Insomnia"", the photography did not capture enough of the delirium that Pacino's character was experiencing.  This left Pacino blinking his eyes and doing his best drunken performance.  Why not let the glare of the sun flood the camera?  There wasn't enough first person point of view shots to show you how the lack of sleep was affecting him.  Particularly in the scene on the back of the boat when Robin Williams character is practically programming his mind.  I just didn't ""see"" the Insomnia as much as I would've liked.
Hilary Swank does a decent job of playing the suspicious police officer and Martin Donovan has a chilling raw moment out in the fog that leaves an impression.  For the record, I think that a Howard Hughes biography by Nolan is a bad idea.  I really hope he sticks with fictional narratives and remakes a Hitchcock film like Vertigo.",1032393600,,1074,4.731182795698925
1738386,4,B00006AGHD,"This movie will make you want to stay up to see the finish as Robin Williams plays a different and unique role!  Pacino is brought in to hunt to an elusive killer (Williams) who local authorities can't pin.  The action is suspenseful and Pacino is excellent again!  Pacino is joined by a less-than veteran staff of local police trying to hunt down a killer. I enjoyed Robin Williams' role as he tries to work a potential black-mail deal with Pacino as he is suspect in his own partner's questionable death.  Pacino is plagued by Internal Affair problems from Los Angeles and Williams wants to exploit this in order to be left alone from Pacino's persistence.
This is a great suspenseful movie that I found quite enjoyable as it was great to see Robin Williams in such a different role for a change!  Does Williams get caught in the end?  Does Pacino avoid the trouble from his partner's death?  Buy this DVD and find out!",1032220800,,921,4.579268292682927
1738387,4,B00006AGHD,"This is one of the most beautifully crafted thrillers to have been made in recent years and that should not be a surprise to fans of Chris Nolan's last effort, the fantastic Memento.
As Insomnia begins, Will (Pacino) and his partner Hap (Donavan) are being flown in to help solve the murder of a 17 year-old girl. The story takes a turn when Will kills Hap in a tense and confusing chase in the foggy terrains of Alaska. Will suffers from depression and insomnia which adds to the tension that he is suffering as the investigation continues. Walter (Robin Williams) who is a suspect in the murder is playing mind games with Will, taking advantage of his Insomnia and at the same time trying to jeopardise the investigation, while (Hillary Swank) is a rookie who idolises Will as a model detective.
The relationship that the characters develop with each other is the centrepiece of this film, so don't be expecting a serial killer film as the murder takes a back seat to the acting and character development. Pacino is excellent in this role, and no matter how many times he has played a detective before, he really polishes it off in this film. Expect an Oscar nod for him. Robin Williams might seem like a bizarre choice as a murder suspect but he is very good in this role and is given a loose leash by Nolan to have a bit of fun, throwing in some of his own humour. But his role is still very constrained considering the man played Mrs Doubtfire. Another surprise is ex-90210 regular Hillary Swank. Her performance may not be as good as her Oscar winning role as gender bender `Brandon Tina' in ""Boys Don't Cry"", but it's still damn good.
Insomnia is not this years `Sixth sense,' it plays it straight forward, but provides great thrills all the same. The scenery of Alaska is gorgeously captured and is a vital element since the environment plays a key role in this stylish thriller. Although the ending is a let down, Nolan weaves a beautiful tapestry of great acting, fantastic cinematography and a fantastic script, resulting in a beautiful film.",1032220800,2,2053,4.642857142857143

1738411,5,B00006AGHD,"Ok, that might sound like a cliche line for Insomnia, a remake here of the 1997 foreign version with Stellan Skarsgard, but why not once in a blue moon. Anyway, this is indeed a topper for Christopher Nolan, over his 2001 independent backwards episode Memento, and brings his storytelling skills to a thriller set in Alaska. Thus, Al Pacino plays the cop, a usual part to be sure, yet here brings an excellent feeling of desperation to try and find a way out of the muck of lies and torment that are in his life. And for once, Alaska is shown as it truly is, either all night or all day (there are so many movies that get this wrong it's too lengthy to explain here) and how either one can drive the particular person crazed. Here it is the constant shining of a itty bit of sunlight into his room at 3:30 AM.
Pacino is on the case of a killer (Robin Williams) who's victim is a teenage girl. This is handled in a good way, by turning it into not a cops and and bad guys movie, but more of a moral movie, one about getting caught in the most stressful of situations in dealing with control over life and the responsibility it follows. It is not just the acting, which is above par, but also just the downright craft that drags you into the predominately first person dilemma (although Williams brings up some interesting points among his blackmail).
One more note: Williams has done something this year to me I'm not sure he's ever done- he has two movies from this year that are both grand dramatic, crazed performances and among his flops and utter misdemeanors (including another one he did this year, Death to Smoochy) there is a bit of praise for the guy.

1738413,2,B00006AGHD,"The old formulas for movies (as well as other things) are sometimes called ""tried and true"" because they are in fact ""time-tested"" and proven good bets for what they do. Yet they grow old, and sometimes we long for something different. And the different can be refreshing when it works. But it also comes with a greater risk of failure. When it does fail, as it often does, it can have us longing for the old formulaic stuff all over again. Here's a case in point of something definitely not formulaic, aiming perhaps to be refreshing, and expecting credit for the effort alone. But the effort, alas is wasted. Al Pacino plays a Los Angeles cop, sent north to investigate a baffling murder case -- far north, in fact, to Alaska. It must be midsummer because he encounters the midnight sun in Alaska, and the absence of darkness leads to the title condition. He chases a murder suspect and in the chase his partner is fatally shot. In the folowing daze it's all a blur. Was his partner shot by the suspect or by Pacino's character himself? If the latter, was it purposeful or an accident? If purposeful, he could have had a motive, because he ain't entirely a clean cop by any means and his partner was in a position to turn him in to internal afairs back in L.A. But the fog and his sleepless state make it all a blur. Then the suspect starts to taunt him about his possible culpability for his partner's death. The suspect seems to confess to killing the original murder victim, but claims it was an accident, calling himself no more guilty than the cop he's taunting and blackmailing. The latter's sleepless daze starts to rub off onto the audience as the taunting is prolonged: seems we're expected to buy into the daze and puzzle over who's guilty of what and whether anybody's really blameless. Did I mention there's a subplot involving the original victim's boyfriend? He's accused of having abused her, but guess what - that's just one more question that turns into a blur, and who knows what to believe about what. We expect all these questions to be resolved. But don't expect too much. It's more like the blur drags on until we cease to care about the answers. Without scarcely anything else resolved, the ending finally comes with a missed opportunity for a surprise. The surprise opportunity would seem obvious, but the movie just ends without hinting whether the makers even thought of that obvious opportunity or not.",1029369600,4,2431,4.655813953488372

1738415,4,B00006AGHD,"Al Pacino, cast in the role of an aging Los Angeles detective, is sent to Alaska to solve a murder case.  He's also there to distance himself from an Internal Affairs Investigation going on in which his partner, played by Martin Donovan, is going to testify against him.  The stage is set for conflict, and the Alaskan summer season, where it's daylight all the time, adds to Pacino's fatigue and disorientation as he finds it impossible to sleep.  This is an icy wonderland, and the cinematography is excellent, capturing the unremitting sunshine as a spotlight of sorts on Pacino's past guilty conscience.  He's true to character throughout though, bending the rules for his own purposes.  And when he commits an act that might cast him in an unfavorable light, he again makes concessions to his conscience.  It's a great role and he's a fine actor.

Robin Williams is cast as bad guy, an unusual part for him.  He does a good job in the role, as does Hillary Swank as the Alaskan detective working on the case that quickly becomes more and more complex.  Generally, I enjoyed the film.

He's up in Alaska to track down the murderer of a 17-year-old girl, along with his partner who has just told him that he's turning state's evidence against Al. Now to sleeplessness add feelings of betrayal and worry. Sounds like the perfect way to make a fatal mistake, and that's exactly what Al does when he pursues the murderer in the fog. Pretty soon, he's got a murder of his own to cover up, and in a bizarre twist of fate, the original murderer (Robin Williams) has seen enough to blackmail Al. How will it all come out in the wash?
I thought ""Insomnia"" was a great piece of moviemaking. First off, the cast was excellent. Pacino conveys a man falling apart at the seams because of his sheer exhaustion, while Willians gives us a quite a villain--hideous and insipid at the same time. Both men deserve Oscar nominations on this one. Hillary Swank does a good supporting job as the young police officer beginning to figure things out for herself. Breathtaking scenery and clever editing make great contributions to the movie as well.

By the time you have finished reading this review I hopefully will have successfully persuaded you to see this movie. Trust me it would be a shame if you didn't. ""Insomnia"" based on a 1998 Norwegian film starring Stellan Skarsgard and directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg is a riveting cat and mouse thriller that doesn't rely to heavily on Hollywood clich's or big explosions to generate suspense. Police officer Will Dormer (Al Pacino in another outstanding performance) hasn't been sleeping much since he arrived in Nightmute Alaska where he and his partner Hap Eckhart  (Martin Donovan) are assisting a local cop named Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank) in the investigation of a local girl who has been found murdered. This case is just what Dormer needs because back home an Internal Affairs Investigation may end his career and his partner Hap is intent on talking to the Feds to cut a deal. The interesting thing about this small town is that for most of the year it stays light all day and all night so that darkness is never seen most of the time. That and the taunting calls of a disturbed individual are keeping Will Dormer awake at night and it is starting to show. Suddenly just when things are looking up, Will does something unthinkable by accident, an event that is witnessed by someone who then begins taunting him and ultimately blackmailing him. That someone is Walter Finch (Robin Williams in a chilling performance) a local author who may or may not have committed the crime Will is investigating.  Eventually, a suspect emerges. Randy Stetz (Jonathan Jackson, Ex Lucky from TV'S ""General Hospital"") who has a history of abusing the victim who was his girlfriend. Will doubts his guilt, but because of his current problems he has to go along with it in order to protect himself. As the games intensify and Wills conscience begin to get the better of him he really begins to unravel. Things get even worse when Ellie begins to piece together the real truth about what Dormer did and ultimately covered up. Insomnia is not merely a remake of the earlier film but ultimately a re interpretation of the same idea's introduced in the previous film. It also helps that they movie doesn't take the low road and end the movie with a typical Hollywood shoot out. The screenplay written by Hillary Seitz is really good. It doesn't just act like a carbon coy of the original, but stands alone with it's own qualities. The cinematography is really good with scenic Alberta standing in for Alaska. The acting is top notch with great performances from everyone. The movie was directed by Christopher Nolan who dazzled us last year with his breakthrough film ""Memento"" (My pick as the best film of last year) Once again he shows his brilliance behind the camera. There are not many directors' that leave me waiting in anticipation for their next film. He is that exception. If I haven't persuaded you to see this movie then you are obviously not much of a movie fan.

The movie was a little slow and the focus was unclear, mixed up with the title, but generally the story was pretty good.  I do think that we expected a bit more twists and turns, a little mystery perhaps.  I'm glad that they didn't go into high tech blasting up of things, just good old fashioned story telling.  Don't get me wrong!  It was indeed a good movie and a good story, but a bit slow and unecessarily long for the lack of twists and predictability.  More mystery would have been nice.  A must see?  Not exactly, not in the theater, but a good DVD or Video night, while in bed so that if you do fall asleep, it's a good thing.

Ironically enough, his role is one totally different from any other roles that he has played. I enjoyed seeing him do something different, but in the long run it wasn't enough for this movie to leave a major impact on me.
This is one of those thrillers that is more of an acquired taste. Mind you, I enjoyed the film, but for me, it's more of a movie I'd wait to rent. The cast was enjoyable, and the plot kept you on the edge of your seat, but only if you really dig this kind of movie. I was entertained but somehow expected more. I've never seen the original, so I can't make any comparison. Nonetheless, the friend I brought along with me was incredibly bored.

1738432,5,B00006AGHD,"What makes ""Insomnia"" such a compelling film is its painting of the Al Pacino character, a Los Angeles detective, in various shades of gray. Pacino is assisting the police in an Alaska town solve the murder of a young high school woman. His character is complex. There is no doubt that he has been a thoroughly professional, hard working and determined man throughout his career. However, he is also a haunted man. Pacino's character, Detective Dormer, is under investigation concerning some allegedly unprofessional conduct concerning evidence in an earlier murder case. To add to his woes, during his work on the current case he does something horrendous, perhaps accidentally, while he and his partner are chasing the possible culprit.
Al Pacino gives a wonderful and sympathetic performance as the weary and very troubled detective. Interestingly, his character's name, Dormer, means ""to sleep"" in French. Robin Williams gives a realistically creepy performance as the mystery writer with whom the dead woman had gotten perhaps too involved. Williams, who is often over-the-top in his other movie roles, here underplays his part, which helps to give his character the right sense of eerieness. Hilary Swank plays a young rookie detective assisting in the investigation with all the Nancy Drew enthusiasm that the part requires.
During the film, Pacino's Detective Dormer tells the Swank character, perhaps mirroring his own situation, what distinguishes a good cop from a bad cop. When a good cop can't sleep it is probably because a piece of the murder puzzle is still missing; when a bad cop can't sleep, he is probably feeling guilty about something. It is this complexity that makes this such a must see film.",1024531200,,1717,5.157706093189964
1738433,4,B00006AGHD,"The real mystery in this film is not:  ""WHO'S THE KILLER?"", as the trailer would like movie audiences to believe.  You see, the phenom director, Chris Nolan, is far too clever for that.
L.A. Detective Will Dormer is our protagonist, and he's continually haunted by a host of demons:  a questionable past, a severe psychological sleeping disorder, a suspicious internal affairs agent, an apprehensive partner, a maniacal antagonist, a lingering murder indictment, and last but not least, the ubiquitous Alaska sun.  Is this a recipe for ""Prozac,"" or what?
As such, this film suprisingly evolves into a ""character study,"" rather than ""suspense thriller"" for this reason:  an individual will build character through adversity, or else, through that adversity, that individual will succumb beneath its weight and fail.  The anxiety we experience through Will Dormer is palpable, and that is the energy driving this film.  That is what keeps you on the edge of your seat.
""Who's the killer?""...who cares! (you know the answer to that long before the movie has concluded).
""What will become of Will Dormer?""  That's the question.  That's why this film is so superb.  That's real entertainment.",1024358400,,1187,5.2
1738434,5,B00006AGHD,"I had seen the Norvegian ""Insomnia"". So, basically the thriller, or suspense wasn't new for me. That is what I believed before discovering the American version of the same movie. In the Norvegian one, a cop is after a killer in Nothern Norway, a place where you have light night and day during six months [and the actor seems in great shape until the end]. He has killed ""by accident"" his partner. Usually, a happy ending is almost a tradition in 99,99% of US movies. Not here. The happy ending will be reserved for the Norvegian movie. Accident or premeditaded murder of a partner: the cop gets away with it.

The entire difference in the American version is divided in two points: 1) a psychological thriller and not only a manhunt. 2) cast. The cop here [Pacino], who already has a suspicious past is haunted by the murder of his partner. He didn't like him. Was it intentional? With no sleep [and Pacino sequence after sequence becomes almost a ghost], with the killer's phone calls [Robin Williams, excellent], who tells him that the two of then have been involved either in a murder, either in an accident, thus playing cats and mouses], Pacino step by step loses the memory of that day.. I am not telling more, I URGE people to go and see it.

Pacino is not only brilliant, but his performance might well be one of his best ones. Another Oscar, Al?

And don't forget Helen Swank [""boys don't cry""] who is really showing that we have to count with her. [...]",1024272000,,1464,4.537878787878788
1738435,4,B00006AGHD,"Like the 1997 Norwegian film on which it is based, ""Insomnia"" is a superbly crafted crime thriller, one that is more concerned with the psychological complexities of its main character than with the minutiae of the criminal investigation itself - though the details of the case are fascinating in their own right as well.
Al Pacino delivers his finest performance in years in the role of Detective Will Dormer, a seasoned homicide investigator brought in from Los Angeles to help solve the murder of a seventeen-year-old high school student in rural Alaska.  The problem is that, back in L.A., Dormer is facing some heat of his own from LAPD's Internal Affairs Division, which is beginning a probe into the propriety of some of the veteran's actions on the job.  Back in Alaska, while on a stakeout to nab the possible killer, Dormer becomes disoriented in the fog and ends up accidentally shooting and killing his longtime partner, a colleague who, Dormer had just learned, was planning to cooperate with the IA investigation back home, thereby bringing about the possible ruination of Dormer's career and reputation.  Caught off guard by this sudden turn of events, Dormer suddenly finds himself in the unfamiliar role of perpetrator, looking for ways to cover up a ""crime"" rather than unravel it.  One of the compelling themes of the film is its insistence that only a very thin line separates those who commit crimes from those whose job it is to uncover and prosecute the wrongdoers.
Dormer is stunned to find how quickly and easily he can cross over that line.  The outstanding screenplay by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjaerg really knows how to get into the minds and emotions of its characters, particularly in the case of Dormer, who turns out to be one of the most psychologically complex and fascinating figures we have encountered in the movies in a long, long time.  Here is a man who has built his name and career on knowing how to unravel complex crimes, always priding himself on being one step ahead of the criminals who are so convinced they have left no traces behind which could point to their guilt.  Yet, now Dormer finds himself in the same boat, as he anxiously looks for ways to hide the fact that he shot - even accidentally - a man who had the power to bring him down.  As the story develops, Dormer, whom we assume at the start is innocent of the charges for which he is being investigated by Internal Affairs, begins to seem less and less innocent and more and more capable of doing just exactly what it is he is being accused of.  Yet, the triumph of the film is that Pacino and the screenwriters never let us feel we know all there is to know about Dormer.  He is truly a man of mystery, so tightly coiled that even he doesn't know or understand all that is going on in the deepest, darkest recesses of his psyche.  By setting the film in the summer near the Arctic Circle, the filmmakers are able to provide a natural phenomenon to help aggravate Dormer's potentially psychotic condition.  Like Mersault in Camus' ""The Stranger,"" Dormer becomes strangely disoriented by the oppressive effect of the sun, though, in this case, it is the lack of a night that drives Dormer crazy through insomnia.  As the virtually indistinguishable days and nights pass without sleep, Dormer begins to suffer from delirium and hallucinations, making it all the harder for him to separate truth from fiction, fantasy from reality and - most importantly - right from wrong and morality from immortality.  When the killer reveals to Dormer that he saw him shoot his partner, Dormer finds himself faced with the ethical crisis of turning the culprit in or of bonding with him as ""partners"" in mutual criminality and guilt.  Here again the once-clear and distinct line between investigator and criminal suddenly ceases to exist.
Pacino, stoop-shouldered and craggy-faced - the prominent bags under his eyes a physical testimony to his weariness and sleeplessness - plumbs the very depths of this infinitely rich and complex character.  In fact, there is nothing less than an outstanding performance in the entire film.  Robin Williams brings an air of restraint and understatement to the part of Walter Finch, the killer who plays a cat-and-mouse mind game with the sleepless, intellectually vulnerable Dormer, exploiting Dormer's weakened state to his own advantage.  Hilary Swank brings a warmth and compassion to her role as Ellie Burr, an eager-to-please detective who has long idolized Dormer and his work, who also has to make an emotionally wrenching choice near the end of the film.  Finally, Maura Tierney makes her few scenes count as a sympathetic innkeeper whom Dormer turns to as the person who happens to be handy at the moment when the need to unburden his soul spontaneously arises within him.
As the film's director, Christopher Nolan establishes and maintains a mood of quiet intensity throughout the course of the film.  Helped by the stark, but somewhat oppressively gloomy beauty of the Alaskan outpost setting, Nolan makes us experience the same sense of unease and disorientation Dormer himself feels.  Nolan has chosen to punctuate his film with a series of highly charged, intensely dramatic confrontation scenes between Dorman and any number of the other characters in the film.  The film never wanes in interest for even a moment of its running time.
It is an enormous pleasure to see a film as intelligently conceived and executed as ""Insomnia.""  Kudos to everyone involved with making this such a rare and fascinating movie going experience.  But the greatest thanks goes to Al Pacino himself.  He has never been so good.",1024185600,2,5665,4.88830897703549
1738436,2,B00006AGHD,"I guess that just as everybody else who loved Memento and got shocked by the beauty of this master piece of independent cinematography, I went with very high expectations about Insomnia.
Unfortunately, Chris Nolan this time lost his touch. Insomnia defaulted versus the high expectations that Memento created in terms of the creativity of its narrative, its characters and the direction of the movie itself. In a very slow moving film, the story is adorned by a million of common places: good cops and bad cops, tension over the answering machine, the rookie admiring the expert, the dead cop's family anger, and literally, a million more.
This could have already encouraged a number of viewers to leave the theater, but it doesn't end here. Misteries resolved by magic, the paranoia of Al Pacino trying to close the shades at night to sleep instead of buying one of those cute eye covers effectively designed and marketed by Samsonite, the killer confessing after being asked the same question three times (we have to give that to Austin Powers who was the first one in realizing it never fails) create a story does not close. The plot is weak. Period.
OK, I guess I already convinced you to skip this one. Stop, I already wasted my ten dollars, so you will have to hear me to the end. You may think, in a movie with Al Pacino and Robbin Williams at least the acting has to be good. Wrong. The acting is poor. Very poor. Al Pacino overacts his character to the limit where you never believe it is not an actor what you have in front of you. Williams, who should have taken some acting lessons with Anthony Hopkins before starting the film, creates a character who nobody in the world may believe is a bright killer. The police is one hundred times closer to stand in their desks saying ""Oh captain, my captain"" than treating him as Annibal, the cannibal.
So, why two stars instead of one? The direction of photography is pretty cool and the beauty of Alaska takes your breath more than once. But to finish, I want to go back to you, Mr. Nolan. Let's make a deal. We will forgive you for this mediocre piece of the most plain Hollywood product if you promise to honor in your next movie the talent that you display in the magic Memento. I know you feel the same. From my side, I promise to go to see your next movie and to rent Somnia every time I have sleeping problems.",1024012800,,2371,4.5162790697674415

Things start going astray for Pacino as he gets closer to catching Williams. Nolan directs a superb masterpiece that sets him apart from other directors.",1023667200,2,492,4.477777777777778
1738448,5,B00006AGHD,"Wow.  Nolan has done it again.  He has taken part in yet another dark thriller masterpiece that will keep you wide awake.
I know that I already have written a review for it, but for some reason it was never posted.  So I decided to write another one.  If that other one ever surfaces, fine.  But I believe this one will be a little better, since I have now seen the movie three times.
Just to give you a quick impression on how much I loved this movie, I almost never see a movie twice at a theatre.  It never happens, no matter how much I liked the movie.  The only time that I saw a movie more than once was ""Black Hawk Down.""  I've seen this movie THREE times!  That's unheard of for me.
Here is a brief summary of the story:  Al Pacino plays brilliant Detective Will Dormer.  Him and his partner has been sent to Alaska to solve a brutal murder of a high school girl.  The sun never goes down in this town, which means it's always light outside.  When Dormer sees the body, he realizes they're not dealing with a normal or random psychopath.  That's when Dormer says one of the best lines in the movie: ""This guy, he crossed the line, and he didn't even blink.  You don't come back from that.""
Another piece to this puzzle is that Dormer and his partner are currently being investigated by the higher up.  His partner, Hap, informs him that they had finally got to him and that he wants to cut a deal.  This angers Dormer because he knows his rep is on the line, and if his partner cuts a deal, every scumbag that he has locked up will walk.  From then on, Dormer becomes furious with Hap and does not want to be around him.
Later on, when the deceased's bag is found, Dormer decides to set a trap to catch the killer.  But things go horribly wrong.  Dormer ends up chasing the killer in the fog, not being able to see anything.  Once he sees a figure with a gun, Dormer fires.  Bad news, however.  He shot Hap, not the killer.  And Hap's dying words are ""You tried to kill me.""  Now, Dormer knows he's in it deep.  He might've not meant to kill Hap, but he has motive.  For this, he decides to cover his tracks and pin the whole thing on the killer.
Dormer is unable to sleep with what he has done.  No rest for the wicked, as they say.  He sees Hap's face almost every second.  And the fact that the sun never goes down doesn't make the situation any much easier for him.  Then about a day later, he gets a call.  It's from the supposed killer, who is played by Williams.  He tells Dormer that he saw him shoot his partner, and that they are now in the same boat.  That is when all the fun and games begin.
The cinematography is outstanding.  It gives the film a very dark and gloomy feel to it, which suit the content of the movie.  The acting is some of the best I have seen in recent years.  Williams is creepy and talented at playing the killer.  But I will tell you this, your eyes never leave Pacino for a second.  This has to be one of his best roles in recent years.  I really hope he wins something for this.  Hillary Swank was also very good as well.
You'll be happy to know, if you are a fan of Nolan's other films, that David Julyan composed the music in the movie.  A very superb score.  I own the soundtrack and I love it.  Even better than the one in ""Memento,"" I think.
And Nolan proves to us once again that he has talent as a director.  More so this time, because he breaks away from his gimmick of manipulating time, which was the main ingredient for his past two movies, ""Following,"" and the ever popular ""Memento.""  He does not have to mess around with time to prove to us that he is talented.  I hope he sticks to these kind of films, though.  I think they suit him the best.
Some people will be pleased that this movie is much more easier to follow than ""Memento,"" and no, you did not have to like that movie in order to enjoy this one.  Is this one better than ""Memento?""  I can't say, because to me this is a completely different movie.  It may be in the same genera, but this film has its own look and feel.  So please, do not try to go into this movie thinking you're going to see another ""Memento,"" because you will be disappointed.
If you want a movie with a stupid storyline and unexplainable action sequences, then do not see this movie.  If you want a movie with a superb storyline, powerhouse acting, outstanding camera effects, and a few thrills and suspenseful chases and confrontations, see ""Insomnia.""  I have not seen the older film, and I really don't plan to.  This was outstanding enough for me.  This is, without a doubt, the best movie of 2002.  Of course, that's my opinion.

1738449,5,B00006AGHD,"In ""Insomnia,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, Al Pacino plays Will Dormer, a Los Angeles police detective. While a controversy swirls around him and his partner, Dormer travels to a small town in Alaska to help with a murder investigation. This assignment leads him into a tension-filled cat-and-mouse game with creepy mystery writer Walter Finch (played by Robin Williams). As an added twist, the story takes place during the Alaskan summer, when there is endless daylight; amidst this inescapable light, Dormer suffers from the malady of the film's title.
""Insomnia"" is a gripping, stylishly made film. The gritty action sequences have a low-tech realism that is a welcome change from the typically overdone Hollywood action thing. The performances are outstanding. Williams gets a lot of mileage out of his effectively low-key interpretation of Finch. Veteran character actor Paul Dooley brings warmth and subtle authority to his role as a small town cop, and Hilary Swank is a superb foil for Pacino in her role as an eager young cop. Pacino is excellent as the film's flawed protagonist. His performance is truly harrowing.

Ironically, the character he played in many ways was a paradox of his portrayal of Frank Serpico from almost thirty years ago and also warranting an Oscar.
Hillary Swank, in certain ways, reminded me of the young idealistic cop that was portrayed by Al Pacino in Serpico. The supporting cast, especially Nicky Katt, were excellent.  Speaking of Nicky Katt, I hope this movie gives him a jump start as Saturday Night fever did for John Travolta back in the 70s and he will have a bright future in the movies instead of being stuck on a t.v. series.

I figured a movie with so much promise, a lot of good reviews and some great actors would turn out to be worth the time and worth the money of spending 6 bucks on a ticket.  I was very wrong and very misinformed.  The movie was absolutely boring.  There really is no other way to sum up this movie.  A girl gets murdered and an ace detective (Pacino), with a shady past, is called up to Alaska on a personal favor to help solve the case.  While doing so, he accidentally kills his partner who might've given him up to Internal Affairs.  Pacino covers it up but the killer of the girl (Williams) sees him and attempts to blackmail him.  And slowly (and this movie moved very slowly) a rookie detective (Swank) starts catching onto the detective's cover-up.  A bunch of boring things happen in this 2 hour long movie.  If it had not been for the semi-decent ending I would've given this movie only one star.  But the message and the somewhat thrilling ending led me to give it another star.

But that was the problem, it felt like the movie could brake down right in front of me, but I can tell you that ""INSOMNIA"" surpassed its reputation and Christopher Nolan was magnificant! By the first 20 minutes, ""INSOMNIA"" was already creeping up my Top Ten List. I had never been so intrigued by such a diverse and complex plot before. The great thing is that the movie is entirely fixed on Will Dormer(Al Pacino), who is an L.A. detective brought to Nightmute, Alaska,a place where the sun never goes down, to study a murder case. You are never a step ahead or behind him. You find all the clues he finds at the same time he does. You also sometimes even know what he is thinking, this happens when the film flashbacks to earlier scenes in the movie or scenes beyond the movie.
Pacino does an excellent job with his character and he developes it so well I almost believed I could meet Will Dormer. And as the film progesses you have more insight on his emotions even more because of the lack of sleep. Also you even develope sympathy for Finch(Robin Williams), the murderer who Will is investigating on.
The only thing else I can say is don't wait for it on DVD, see it in the theater, it's much better that way, but if you don't take my advice, it would still be worth the wait.",1023321600,,1392,4.337164750957855
1738454,4,B00006AGHD,"Nolan's followup to the genius of ""Memento"" does not try to top that film in the sense that ""Insomnia"" doesn't have any backwards time framing or disappearing polaroids.  That's not to say that ""Insomnia"" is an average murder mystery- there's plenty of unconvential moods in the story.  Taking place in Alaska, Detective Dormer (Al Pacino) is called up from L.A. to help in a case about the murder of a teenage girl.  That's already been said, and really, that's about all the plot that you should give away, but I can say that its much less a mystery as it is a construction of it, and that's what keeps the movie interesting.  Al Pacino gives his best performance in years, playing his roll as a torn-apart cop dealing with insomnia (hence the title) in Alaska's 24-hour daylight.  He doesn't underplay his role, and puts the right amount of emotion into his character's setting.  If there was one thing to crtisize about ""Memento,"" it was that often times it seemed cold and numb- you couldn't really connect to the characters.  That is gone in ""Insomnia,"" and both Al Pacino and Robin Williams both deliver the goods.  Williams once again flexes his ability to be more than a slap-happy comedic actor (as we've seen in ""Dead Poets' Society"" and ""Good Will Hunting"").  He's perfectly spooky as the disturbed, supposed killer.  Hillary Swank and Nicky Katt also deliver notable performances.  I have a feeling it will be remembered at the Oscars.",1023148800,,1448,4.798387096774194

It is a great follow up to his brilliant work on ""Memento"", and in my opinion, ""it is even better. Christopher Nolan proves with this film that he can make a smart, creepy, and brilliant thriller with a big budget and cast and still keep his creative style completely. I now consider him to be one of the best directors working today and I believe that he has a long future of great films ahead of him. Al Pacino and Robin Williams give some of their best work to date with this film. I was completely fascinated at how both of these high profile actors could play characters such unique and troubled characters. They both pull it off very nicely. Hillary Swank does a fair job in her role, she is convincing as a rookie cop who looks up to Pacino's character. Screenwriter Hillary Seitz has produced as memorable work of writing with crisp, clever dialouge. This film was great and I strongly recommend it.

1738457,2,B00006AGHD,"After reading a rave review in the main Richmond, VA newspaper, I set out to see this movie, expecting something engaging and thrilling. Instead, I left feeling disgusted and cheated even at matinee prices.
Al Pacino is a fine actor; however, this movie did little to bring out the vitality he's shown in so many other movies. Instead, the viewer is treated to dialogue so wooden, you want to light a fire under it and run screaming from the theatre. Expect dialogue such as the following: ""The jury hasn't ever seen a child killer, PAUSE.... but I have. BIG PAUSE....""
Robin Williams presents some fine moments, but they aren't able to rescue the movie from itself. I knew it would be difficult for Christopher Nolan to repeat the magic that ""Momento"" brought to viewers. However, I wasn't expecting this to be so formulaic and frustratingly unoriginal.
If you want snappy dialogue and interesting characters, do yourself a favor and skip this one.",1022976000,2,949,4.864197530864198
1738458,5,B00006AGHD,"""Insomnia"" is one of those rare movies that resonate in your mind long after you leave the theater.  It is a wonderful ensemble effort, with Al Pacino as the standout in an excellent cast.  Pacino's performance is his finest in years, and it adds to the luster of an already legendary acting career.
Pacino plays Will Dormer, a veteran cop who, along with his partner, Hap Eckhart, is under investigation by Internal Affairs in Los Angeles for alleged misconduct on the job. Dormer and Hap temporarily escape from their troubles by flying to Nightmute, Alaska, to help a former colleague investigate the brutal murder of a seventeen-year-old girl.
Suddenly, Hap confides to Will that he intends to cooperate with the authorities in Internal Affairs and cut a deal, which horrifies Dormer.  Not only will Dormer's stellar career end in ruins, but his closed cases may also be reopened and convictions may eventually be overturned.
Dormer's troubles are just beginning.  During a chase scene in which Dormer, Hap and the Nightmute cops are on the heels of the killer, Dorner accidentally shoots his partner in a dense fog.  The questions is, was the shooting really an accident? Was Dormer, either consciously or subconsciously, looking for a way to make sure that Hap would never have the opportunity to cut a deal with Internal Affairs?  This is one of the many moral dilemmas that this complex film raises.
Things go from bad to worse.  Dormer blames the shooting on the killer, a writer named Walter Finch, played with quiet and understated menace by Robin Williams.  Unfortunately for Dormer, Finch witnessed him shooting Hap, and the killer offers to cut a deal of his own with Dormer.  If Dormer blames the girl's murder on her brutal boyfriend, Finch will not turn Dormer in for shooting his partner.
All this makes for an intricate and intelligent film, beautifully photographed in British Columbia, with an excellent use of blinding light that contrasts with the dark emotions churning in the main characters.  The film builds in intensity as the action progresses.
Pacino is fabulous as a man who has gone astray.  He has spent decades as a policeman and genuinely loves his job, but he has cut too many corners and it is too late to regain his lost innocence.  The scenes between him and Robin Williams are terrific.  Williams considers himself Dormer's equal.  Both men have a great deal to hide and both men in some ways consider themselves above the law.  Since Finch is a writer of crime thrillers, he thinks of himself as something of an expert on the criminal justice system, as well.  Will Dormer take the low road once again, and cooperate with Finch in order to save his own career?
Hilary Swank is wonderful as the starry eyed Ellie Burr, a promising rookie cop who worships Dormer for his stellar reputation, until she finds out that her hero has feet of clay.
Adding to the ambiance of the movie are the striking scenes depicting Dormer's insomnia.  He cannot get used to the sun shining late throughout the night in Alaska, and he goes for days without sleep.  As Pacino's mental state deteriorates, he becomes more and more disoriented and tortured.  He has a guilty conscience, and he has no idea how he can extricate himself from the mess that he has gotten himself into.  Christopher Nolan's expert direction and the solid performances by a fine cast make ""Insomnia"" one of the year's best films so far.  Look for an Oscar nomination for Pacino. He is perfectly cast as a man whose moral center has shifted, and he has no idea whether he can ever find his way back.",1022976000,2,3592,4.7799352750809065
1738459,2,B00006AGHD,"Before I start, I must admit to not seeing the fascination with Memento, I thought it was a decent movie, but the amount of attention and adoration that it got surprised me completely, I thought it was a pretty good genre film that had some interesting parts but mostly relied on a gimmick.  Christopher Nolan, the brit responsible for the direction of that movie moved from that to this film, a remake of a Norwegian thriller which I wanted so see a while ago, but the [local] video store didn't have it(surprise, surprise).  Anyway, this film pretty much confirmed my suspicions, Nolan is a pretty average filmmaker who can use gimmicks to make a compelling film, but can't make a compelling film without a gimmick.  I thought this would be a well-thought out police-procedural, or maybe a psychological thriller, but its really neither.  Its just so ridiculously devoid of emotion, that the movie becomes arbitary.  Its full of plot devices, such as the fog during the stakeout.  Did anyone see that thick fog before the chase started, I didn't think so.  Another is the sunlight that keeps him awake, Nolan ever really explores the insomnia that thoroughly.  He just says here we go, cue the disorienting sound and jumpy images, there we go, thats all we need.  Nolan is one of the few filmmakers to completely disorient me during a gun battle and the subsequent fight, I had no idea what was going on, and that couldn't have been the idea.  I do have to give him credit for his little snippets of the victim shown throughout, which convey the innocence of her completely.  The acting is really quite good, Al is great as always, people say he chews the scenery, they can shove it I like him for it, all this understatement gets a little weary.  Robin Williams makes for a completely boring killer, which is good, I don't need the long-winded speeches on human nature from a psychopath, that got old 10 yrs ago.  Hilary Swank isn't given much to do, she just puts the pieces together slowly but surely.  The ending is awful, I mean it wouldn't be so bad, but Al's last line is just terrible and way too easy.  All I can say is I thought Nolan would make something more interesting, and prove me wrong about his talents, but it seems he needs to get back to writing his own stuff, maybe he can prove me wrong another time.",1022889600,2,2325,4.5686746987951805
1738460,4,B00006AGHD,"Christopher Nolan has followed his impressive mainstream debut, Memento, with a film that once again examines the psychology of manipulation. The sunlit nights of an Alaskan summer distort the sense of time in a more subtle fashion than its predecessor. Al Pacino gives an impressive performance as a cop at ease with the compromises sometimes necessary in his chosen profession. Robyn Williams is the perpetrator of the particularly violent and meaningless murder. It is Lieutenant Dormer, played by Pacino, that the audience sleep-walks along with as the days merge together, and Robyn Williams that proves to be a plausible, accessible and fiercely intelligent ""job"" for Dormer to complete before the lack of sleep and Internal Affairs catch up with him.
Nolan's direction is accomplished, the setting compelling, and the atmosphere palpable. While remakes tend to lose the full-bodied flavor of the prototype, there seems to be no such concern here (although I haven't seen the Norwegian original). The principals - rounded out by Hilary Swank as a young, dedicated local policewoman - are each utterly convincing in their portrayal of the guiding principals each has set themselves to live their lives by. But there are no black and whites here - sometimes it seems that only the crispness and beauty of the Alaskan scenery (mostly shot on location in Canada) gives us an unambiguous point to steer by. As Dormer's control of the situation slips away, we can feel him being tormented by uncertainty over his own motivations. It is a testament to the strength of the acting that while the final chapter, in hindsight, may seem predictable, it seems anything but as we are inchingly drawn into it, like a dream we wish we could begin with an elusive but much-needed sleep.",1022889600,,1775,5.061433447098976
1738461,5,B00006AGHD,"Chris Nolan deserved an academy award nomination for his previous direction of Momento. He probably was denied such an honor merely because that great film did not receive the backing of a large studio. Insomnia is clearly one of the best films that you will likely see this year. It is breathtakingly beautiful to look at. One will envy the Alaskans who are so fortunate to be surrounded by such awe inspiring scenery. Insomnia would be well worth seeing just for that fact alone. However, it offers substantially more than mere attractiveness. The acting of Al Pacino and Robin Williams is stupendous. Williams abandons his standard nice guy roles to portray a character of low self esteem who will stop at virtually nothing to escape justice. Both men will probably be remembered during Oscar time. Hillary Swank is also very good in her role as the idealistic young detective Ellie Burr who worships the ground that older homicide investigator Will Dormer (Pacino) walks on.
The story revolves around the murder of a seventeen year old girl. Detective Dormer is called in from Los Angeles to assist the local police in finding the killer. He is accompanied by partner Hap Eckert (Martin Donovan) who is about to turn state's evidence against him. Dormer planted evidence on a man suspected of torturing and murdering a young boy. The veteran detective knows his life is about to be ruined. He then accidentally shoots and kills Hap. This is where the film takes off as we witness Dormer's personality and moral disintegration. We learn early on that a mildly popular crime novelist named Walter Finch (Williams) has murdered the girl. The plot twists and turns while Dormer suffering from a severe lack of sleep hunts down Finch---and finds himself in the untenable checkmated predicament where he is unable to arrest the manipulating Finch. Insomnia builds upon the eternally reoccurring tragic themes of sin and redemption. Can Dormer still do the right thing, or has his past compromises with wrong doing incapacitated his moral compass? Try imagining Crime and Punishment and Macbeth in an Alaskan rural setting.
Insomnia easily earns five stars and proves that Chris Nolan is one of our greatest living directors. You should see this film as quickly as possible. Don't walk, but run to the theater. Let the kids view the escapist movies currently being released. Insomnia is a film for us adults.",1022889600,2,2405,4.985074626865671

Well, I just got back from seeing Insomnia, and it is one of the better films I have seen in the past year.  Al Pacino plays an L.A. detective called into a case in Alaska involving a dead teenage girl.  When Pacino arrives he finds a web of secrets, all leading to Robin Williams (cast surprisingly perfect as the killer), who learns that Pacino himself has some secrets.  Hillary Swank is great as well in her role as a rookie cop, proving her Oscar win wasn't a fluke.  The atmosphere of the film, especially between Pacino and Williams (the scene where they meet face to face) is what makes Insomnia a winner, and Nolan doesn't compromise his directorial skills and keeps Insomnia an unorthodox game of cat & mouse.  The cinematography is worth noting as well, and should be remembered when Oscar time rolls around.  George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh also helped produce the film, and I recommend seeing Insomnia as soon as you can.

Dormer is extremely out of place in the Alaskan small town... During this particular time of the year, the sun never sets.  The feeling of not belonging and the theme of constant light are very important in the film.
As Dormer investigates the case, we become aware that _he_ is being investigated by Internal Affairs back in L.A.  As the events play out on the screen, Dormer finds that he and the killer he's looking for may have some things in common, which makes for some great dramatic moments and creates some wonderful tension...
Watch 'Insomnia' for what it is:  a really, really good thriller with top-notch acting.
Without giving the story away, I can tell you it has one hole, and it's a pretty big one.  If you can excuse it, you'll have a great time with 'Insomnia.'  I know I did.
What makes the film work is great acting, great cinematography, great characters, and a setting that we haven't seen hundreds of times (which I find refreshing).  You get to know what's going on in the character's minds and will ask yourself, ""I wonder what _I_ would have done?""

 By the time you get to the last line of insomnia, you know that you've been led down the path by masters.  Beyond the powerful performances and the mythic landscape is a storyline that reaches deep down in the gut of all the fears that can be piled up over a lifetime or discovered new by the young.  And, walking out of the theatre, what takes only a short while to emerge is thankfulness towards the group of people who performed that magic act called collaboration to bring the whole movie about.
 It will leave you uncomfortable at being able to sympathize with the mind of a killer.  It will leave you sad at the efforts we (and I say this with an almost seamless connection to the aging detective portrayed by Al Pacino) exert and the decisions we make in order to achieve rightness in each of our own worlds.  And through the scatological cinematography that so masterly mimics the sensations of sleep deprivation, you are delivered almost unsurprised to the confessors in the story, whether it be the unwilling accomplice, the friendly hotelkeeper, or the young cop in search of the truth.
 And in the rush to find the truth you almost miss the effort and the agonizing desire that each of the characters works through to tell you, to tell anybody, the truth.  Don't miss it.",1022889600,,1307,4.579399141630901

1738475,3,B00006AGHD,"I loved the original Insomnia, so I was kind of worried that Hollywood would destroy another foreign film by remaking it. On that count, Insomnia is a success: The film works on all of the same levels as the original.....but it just didn't involve me in the same way.
  The story is pretty straightforward: Two L.A. Cops are brought to Alaska, ostensibly to help solve a murder, but the reality is they were sent away to get them out of the spotlight of an Internal Affairs investigation that could drag them both down. While trying to snare the killer, the stakeout goes horribly awry, and cop and killer become drawn together by the secret knowledge of what happened.
  The performances are great. Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, and Nicky Katt are all great actors. The problem is, the story just doesn't seem compelling enough on it's own. The actors are the only thing sustaining interest. It's also riddled with bad-tv cliches: Evidence is found by accident, days after dozens of people turned the beach upside-down and found nothing, the killer opens a drawer in his house, allowing a cop to see evidence that can implicate him (oops!), Pacino even gets the location of Williams' hideout from the jacket of a book he'd written! Come ON.....sloppy writing!
  The film is worth seeing, if you're a fan of any of these actors. Otherwise, try the original. You won't regret it.",1022889600,2,1389,4.7907949790794975
1738476,3,B00006AGHD,"I guess I shouldn't have one into the movie anticipating it to be this totally awesome movie, but unfortunately I did.  In my opinion, it was kind of a ""sleeper"" in the beginning, just kind of dragging along.  Once Robin Williams character appeared (or should I say was heard), then it started getting better and I didn't feel like taking a nap.  The scenery in this film was fantastic, quite a sight for the eyes to see and behold!  I did chuckle quite a bit when Williams' character kept calling Pacino and referring to the daylight during night, and how he should get some sleep, etc.  Pacino did a great job in the movie, though I must say, he's got to do something about all the bruises under his finger nails, either that, or the camera shouldn't have focused on them so much.  And I have to say that Robin Williams did not disappoint me in the fact that he played a character so unlike the humorous characters he's play in years past.  He did a fantastic job!!!
Though it's nice to see movies on the big screen, in my opinion I'd save your money and wait until it comes out on video and DVD to rent it.  If nothing else, the cinematography, views of Alaska and Robin Williams' performance was worth it.
But again, this is just my opinion.  There seems to be other's on here who differ, which is why this country is so great as we are all entitled to our opinions.  Thanks for reading! :o)",1022889600,,1395,4.351351351351352

Insomnia, directed by the same talented Christopher Nolan, is nothing like Memento. Instead, it is more simple and refined. I never saw the original one, but this seems good enough.
 It's great to see Al Pacino return in a role appropriate for adding onto his filmography, but it was also great, and pretty terrifying to see Robin Williams in a role completely new and different. Hillary Swank was also just as great. The movie is more captivating when unfolded during the viewing, so let's just say that this is what a suspense film is all about. There's not too much action, but just enough to get you going. With great performances, and a pretty decent dialogue, this movie is true entertainment.

1738478,4,B00006AGHD,"""Memento"" was a tough act to follow. Director Christopher Nolan's riveting 2001 film was a technically and thematically challenging cinematic tour de force.
But that was just an art movie that became a sleeper hit. ""Insomnia,"" a shadowy, adroit murder mystery, is Nolan's introduction to the big leagues. It's a Hollywood movie with a Hollywood cast of Oscar winners: Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank.
It even has a Hollywood ending. Or at least it feels that way. The big scene granted one of the stars in the last sceneat the end doesn't seem in synch with the moody hour and three-quarters that precede it, or the 1998 Norwegian film on which ""Insomnia"" is based. Somehow, you can't really see that kind of emotional punch-up coming from the Scandinavians.
Otherwise, ""Insomnia"" is a deftly entertaining film, smartly played and smartly directed.
Something's fishy in the small Alaskan town of Nightmute, which claims to be the ""Halibut Fishing Capital of the World."" A teenage girl has been beaten and murdered.
Nightmute isn't the sort of place where people get murdered, brutally or not. So they call in the pros: Will Dormer (Pacino), a legend in the Los Angeles Police Department, and his partner, Hap (Martin Donovan). Though they're friends, there seems to be some tension between them. It might have something to do with the fact that Internal Affairs is investigating their department. Hap is ready to cooperate - which bothers Will, though he has a long-established reputation as a good cop. Then there's the local cop (Swank), who's helping them out; she has hero-worshipped Will since graduating from the police academy.
Tracking down a killer is the sort of thing the L.A. guys are used to doing; what they can't handle is the relentless Alaskan summer, where it's light at 3 in the morning. Will is especially affected, to the point where he's raging against the non-dying of the light. By the end of the movie, he hasn't slept for six days. But is it the light or something else that's keeping him awake?
Swank quotes the hero cop to himself: A good cop can't sleep because a piece of the puzzle is missing, and a bad cop can't sleep because of his conscience.
Williams doesn't enter the picture until 30 minutes in, and by then you'll probably have some idea of where he fits in the scheme of things. He plays Walter Finch, a hack writer of obscure crime novels who's obsessed with cops. In this case, that means Will, which leads to some of the cleverest cat-and-mouse games in recent memory. Especially riveting is an interrogation scene in which each diabolically tops the other.
Nightmute may be bathed in near 24/7 daylight, but most of ""Insomnia"" takes place in dark, claustrophobic rooms. When Nolan takes us outside, to show us a panoramic view of the Alaskan wilderness, we feel doubly cramped by the interior scenes. It's disorienting, and it's meant to be. The claustrophobia is brought to a near-hysterical level in a scene where Pacino and Williams chase each other across a log float and Pacino, terrifyingly, becomes trapped underwater, his arms getting crushed by the immense logs as he tries to claw his way back to air.
Nolan and Pacino cannily convey the fallout of sleeplessness: the confusion, the heaviness, the bleariness. More importantly, except for a lapse or two, Pacino reins himself in. Instead of the bloated histrionics of ""Scent of a Woman,"" he gives the part the same careful character shadings he used in ""Donnie Brasco.""
The real proof of Nolan's skill with actors, however, is Williams, who's been told incessantly that he needs to play against type. You can barely place that eerily familiar face, and his Mork-ish physical energy has been rechanneled into something jittery and unsettling.
No, ""Insomnia"" isn't as good as ""Memento,"" but who really expected it to be? But it gives Nolan a chance to prove he can survive going Hollywood and still keep something of his distinctiveness from being erased. In a season full of summer-movie dumbness, ""Insomnia"" is a movie to seek out.",1022803200,2,4046,4.899416909620991

It's part of the psychological profile drawn here of a trigger-happy, sleep deprived man with a haunted past shooting in a dark fog. I cringed at the dueling character driven acting battles between hero Al Pacino and villain Robin Williams. They seemeed like two Hollywood stars doing facial trick ponys. I couldn't help but wonder what another actress might have done with Hilary Swank's role of exactly two emotions: naive giddiness and suspicion, coming across as a more serious Barney Fife with a computer.

1738481,5,B00006AGHD,"This is a wonderful film--great script, fantastic actors, amazing directing and cinematography.  This isn't a ""thriller"" in the shallow, slasher sense of the word.  It's purely psychological, and that's what I prefer.
Will Dormer is an aging Los Angeles cop who travels to a small Alaska town to solve the murder of a teenaged girl, Kay Connell.  Once there, he encounters local cops who barely scratch the suface of the necessary investigation, yet seem reluctant to welcome his expertise.  Only one cop, the rookie Ellie Burke, is thrilled to finally be investigating ""real crime"" and even more in awe of the veteran Dormer.
The case quickly turns to the victim's boyfriend, Randy (played by Jonathan Jackson, who has come a long way since his General Hospital days).  Abusive, angry, and belligerent, Randy seems like the natural choice, especially since he doesn't care to admit he was actually betraying Kay as she was being murdered.  Not long into the investigation, Dormer sets a trap for the killer.  The ploy, however, goes horribly wrong when Dormer's partner is (accidentally?) shot.  This is when the plot begins its tantalizing, teasing turns.  Dormer does his best to cover up the true facts of his partner's death and the real killer of Kay Connell, but small-town cop Ellie is smarter than anyone wants to admit . . .
Robin Williams has a deliciously freaky role in this film (this isn't Patch Adams, folks) as Walter Finch, Kay Connell's secret confidant.  His performance isn't to be missed; indeed, it's the highlight of the film.
The film's setting was quite ingenious--Alaska, land where the sun never sets on the day or the problems in Dormer's life.  His conscience keeps him awake, as much as he tries to blame the sun.  The scenery is absolutely gorgeous, too.
I'm sorry if some people expected this to be a thriller of the blood and guts variety.  If that's what you're expecting, stay home.  This film is a true nail-biter and I just start several times because of sudden movements . . . I also impulsively covered my eyes to shield them from what I *thought* would happen . . . no matter what anyone says, this is no sleeper.  I recommend it!",1022803200,,2171,4.798387096774194

The midnight sun (20-22 hours of daylight) we enjoy during summer months has a more positive effect than portrayed in the film, but I understood the message.  I am a HUGE Al Pacino fan and see everything he does so I loved ""Insomnia"" just for that reason. Al doesn't do a bad movie, in my opinion.  Other actors were very good and it was an interesting twist with Robin Williams as the ""bad guy"". I highly recommend this film for the acting, scenery, and plot.",1022716800,,572,4.336448598130841

1738484,5,B00006AGHD,"I glanced at some other reviews here before inscribing my own (which can sometimes be an unhealthy procedure), and noticed a motif that seems to underline most independent reviewers criticism.  They either find the film to far from ""Memento,"" or to close to ""Memento,"" which is beyond explanation on my part. The fact is, Christopher Nolan does an outstanding job with this film, and nothing more nor nothing less should have been done in the creation and editing of this film.  The truth is, this movie isn't much like ""Memento,"" but more like ""Insomnia.""
A reviewer here posted that most of the shots are over-stylized, exaggerated, and uncomfortable to watch. Well, I would suppose that the psychological state of insomnia might exactly reflect those very three states.... but on to the movie.
Robin Williams and Al Pacino definitely did a great job with this movie, with Al Pacino definitely taking the more impressive role. You really get the feeling that there was a ""trinity"" between Nolan, Pacino, and Williams going on, much like the ""trinity"" which took place in ""Taxi Driver.""
I never saw the original ""Insomnia,"" so I am not going to draw comparisons, all I know is that this movie stands by itself as a fantastically dark, thought-provoking film. I will watch the original, just because this movie was so good.
A note on the camera angles and stylizied scenes, good job Nolan, you truly did an epic job portraying that vexing state of mind, the light playing, the speeding up and slowing down, the warping of depth, all very well done here, hope to see more of that coming from you.

1738485,5,B00006AGHD,"The breathtaking beauty of a remote area of Alaska provides the setting for this film, and the natural splendor of the surroundings offers a thought provoking contrast between the serenity of the landscape and the ugliness visited upon it by one of it's inhabitants.  In the thriller ""Insomnia,"" director Christopher Nolan examines the myriad faces of evil and the far-reaching effects of wrongdoing, whether perpetrated straightforwardly as a heinous crime, or in the ill conceived notion of subverting the law in a quest for justice.  But he also looks beyond the objectivity of premeditation at how certain physical variables can subjectively affect the psychological aspects of the duplicity.  Specifically, what happens to the body-- and especially to the mind-- when deprived of sleep for an extended period of time.  And especially when it comes at a critical juncture; at a time when, above all else, the mind must be absolutely clear and sharp, when judgments must be passed and decisions made.  Can a web of deceit, woven amid a struggle between the mind and the body, stand fast?  And if so, for how long?  How long can one prevail against the proclivities of human nature, in a place where the sun never sets, and the mind cannot find rest.
 L.A. detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino), and his partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan), have been given a special assignment:  The investigation of the murder of a seventeen-year-old girl in the small town of Nightmute, Alaska.  Their detail comes on the heels of a certain internal affairs investigation currently being conducted within the L.A.P.D., which may involve the high-profile Dormer, a good cop who has been putting away the bad guys for more years than he can remember.  And if the I.A. affair goes south, some criminals Dormer has been instrumental in convicting may see freedom.  So the change of venue for the detectives comes at an auspicious time; sometimes distance can be a good thing.
 Dormer goes into the case with the confidence provided him by years on the job.  He is lucid, and on top of things immediately.  What he finds in Nightmute, however, is a killer who is not only meticulous, but who has a wild card up his sleeve and begins to play it not long after Dormer hits town.  It's the time of year when the sun never sets, and the killer realizes that it is going to affect Dormer's sleep, and subsequently, his perceptions and actions.  And he's determined to help the situation along with some untimely phone calls and some well chosen words.  Dormer's onto the game immediately, but after a couple of days of sleeplessness, his mental faculties begin to deteriorate, and it leads to a situation involving Eckhart that puts an entirely new spin on the matters at hand.  Things get sticky, and Dormer's judgment becomes questionable.  He struggles to keep himself together, because he knows one thing for certain:  The killer has crossed a line from which there is no return, and he's going to kill again.  And it's up to Dormer to stop him before it happens.
 As with his previous effort, ""Memento,"" Christopher Nolan has crafted and delivered a film that is emotionally stirring and initially, at least, devoid of any absolutes (or if there are any, they are soon lost in Dormer's sleeplessness induced mental haze), to which he adds a moral dilemma that makes it all entirely involving and which successfully draws the audience into the action as the story unfolds.  it becomes an incisive character study that affords you Dormer's perspective while allowing you to experience his situation seemingly first hand.  Nolan gradually takes you from the rational thought processes that to Dormer are the norm, to the murky regions of the ambiguous into which he descends as the sleeplessness overcomes and overwhelms him.  And the fact that Dormer's impaired mental state is so significant-- inasmuch as the direction it takes the story-- makes this a rather unique film; it's an interesting angle, and quite different from the usual considerations offered by the typical crime/thriller/drama.  Most importantly, Nolan knows how to present it effectively, and builds the tension in direct proportion to Dormer's descent, which maintains that necessary edge right up to the climax.
 By the end of the film, Pacino/Dormer really looks as though he hasn't slept in days; it's a critical aspect of the story, upon which the credibility of the film depends, and which it achieves, without question.  Some credit has to go to the make-up provided by Gitte Axen, but ultimately, what makes this film so convincing-- and such an unqualified success-- is Al Pacino's performance.  As he demonstrates here, he is arguably one of the top two leading actors in the business (the other being De Niro).  He has the ability to create a completely new character with every new film, and he's always convincing, whether taking it over-the-top (Tony Montana, ""Scarface""; Vincent Hanna, ""Heat""), using a more introspective approach (Michael Corleone, ""The Godfather"") or finding the necessary reserve that fits a particular character and makes him believable (as he does here with Will Dormer).  This is a studied portrayal, presented in subtle shadings and tone, and one that should easily earn him an Oscar nomination.
 Turning in a solid performance, also, is Robin Williams, who seems to be taking a page out of Pacino's book by finding the kind of restraint he needed to make his character work.  Williams has played a variety of roles in his career, but never has he played so against type as his portrayal of Walter Finch in this film; and he does it well.  He's entirely convincing-- his Finch is very real and disquietingly believable, in that his outward appearance is so normal, while in reality he is capable of deeds most vile.  His true nature is undetectable, and as such, he's your worst nightmare.  It makes Dormer's conundrum even more pronounced, and helps to make ""Insomnia"" a riveting and thoroughly engrossing film.",1022544000,3,6000,4.975951903807616
1738486,4,B00006AGHD,"""Insomnia"" is an at times confusing puzzle by the same person who created the cult hit\ and perhaps even classic(?) film ""Memento"", Christopher Nolan.
 ""Insomnia"" is a remake of an 1998 Norwegian film directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg, and it's one of the few times we can say a remake actually works! This new version of ""Insomnia"" is so grandly conceieved, so richly constructed that I'm afraid American audiences won't like it. ""Insomnia"" is not some by the numbers, fast-paced, loud summer movie, that perhaps some people might think it will turn out to be, no, this movie is a well thought out character study about what happens when we make the wrong choices to protect ourselves. Director, Nolan is more concerned here with the story and character development then loud car chasing scenes, or big explosions. Nolan and screenwriter Hillary Seitz have actually taken the time out to tell us a story. They pace the film wonderfully and allow us to get to know the characters. There is more to a film like ""Insomnia"" than meets the eye. But, even so, like I said, I'm afraid the American public won't go for it. The American public likes fast, cliche, pointless, mindless movies. They like to see people run away from dinosaurs or people under attack by a group of aliens. I know for a fact people will say that this movie is slow and boring. And that it doesn't go anywhere. People will say this film is not a good follow-up to ""Memento"". But, they are wrong. They just have no patience.
 The plot for ""Insomnia"" goes something like this; Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are two L.A. cops sent to Alaska to investigate the murder of a teenage girl. Once they arrive they are greeted by Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank) who is a by the books, young cop. She's the cliche character who became a cop because she loves it. She thinks that there's no corruption inside the system. As the film goes on, we find out that it's not merely because Dormer (Pacino) and Eckhart (Donovan) are good cops that they have been sent to investigate this case. They were both in trouble in L.A. for some questionable actions on their last case. This is there way of taking the ""heat"" off them. As the film goes on we find out that the killer was\is a ""twisted"" person. He actually took the time out to wash the girl's hair, to paint her nails, and even clip them! It was not just a random act of violence, but a premeditated one. I don't really want to give much more information then I already have, you just have to go see the film yourself to find out the rest. All I will say is the film has a lot of ""tricks"" up it's sleeve, so don't think you'll be able to see through the plot.
 So, some of you are probably wondering, how is this different from the original, well, there are small differences. Like the whole background story with the lead character's being sent on the case. The relationship between the two cops is different. And, the female character in this one doesn't seem as strong. Also, there are some brief scenes of sexual content. Which does not appear in this new version.
 ""Insomnia"" is one of the year's best films, it has a truly remarkable performance by Al Pacino. So far, it's the best performance of the year! Pacino proves himself to be one of the greatest actor we have around today. Robin Williams is oddly, very good in this film. I use the word oddly because I sometimes find it hard for me to see him in serious roles. I mean, this is the same man who use to play a space alien on ""Mork & Mindy"". But, Williams gives his best performance since ""Good Will Hunting"". Hilary Swank gives a good performance as well, but, for me, it wasn't anything really special, though, I don't think that was her fault, I think it was just the way the part was written.
 Bottom-Line: ""Insomnia"" is an extremely well constructed character study\thriller. The pacing of the film is wonderful and the performances are even better. Truly one of the year's best films!",1022544000,,3979,4.536211699164346
1738487,3,B00006AGHD,"I had a friend once who was a purist.  If a film was released as a remake of a foreign version, he steered clear of it convinced that it would make for a waste of time and money.  It's too bad he's not around to see this.  I should've listened to him when he was alive, and I wouldn't have wasted my time or money on this film.  From the previews I was expecting a lot more than I got, and I am definitely getting the VHS of the foreign film.  I gave it three stars--one for Pacino who I have always admired; one for Williams who has gone beyond his range (comic actor to dramatic actor; much like Jim Carrey); and one for the beautiful shots of Alaska.  Aside from Pacino and Williams, I didn't think the acting was all that great, and the storyline was too diluted.  Joe, I hear ya now!  If you're totally adverse to seeing a foreign film, and go see this one, you will probably like it....because you won't know better.",1022544000,,922,4.169491525423729
1738488,5,B00006AGHD,"I saw the previews to Insomnia earlier this year, and I howled. Al Pacino looked absolutely terrible, and his behavior appeared to be worse than that. Robin Williams as a killer? Give me a break! If Mrs. Doubtfire was a stretch, this was just bizarre! The only way I was going to see Insomnia was to laugh even harder than I had at the trailer. And then the reviews started coming in, and those who watch movies for a living really liked this film. Now I had to go see it just to see who was right. The reviewers were right, I was wrong, and someone should burn the trailer footage.
I didn't see Momento, and I didn't see the original Insomnia; I have nothing with which to compare this version of Insomnia. I am an Al Pacino fan, and I have to say that I think his performance in this movie is everything I've come to expect from him. I also thought Robin Williams pulled off the killer persona much better than I ever would have believed he could. Hillary Swank was also very good as the newbie cop in awe of Pacino's celebrity as a cop.
I also like mysteries, and I enjoy police procedurals. I enjoy reading or watching explanations about how evidence is gathered and conclusions based on that information are made. I thought the scene in the morgue with Pacino's examination of the victim's body was interesting and well done. Maybe none of it was exactly brilliant police work, but it formed the basis for understanding Pacino's thought processes and established him as a well seasoned cop who'd seen plenty of such cases to know where to start looking for clues. It also began the process by which Swank's newbie cop character would begin to learn that thought process and ultimately one-up Pacino with it.
There were so many little things about this movie I enjoyed, not the least of which was the whole insomnia angle and how it affects a person's perceptions and reason. The scene of Pacino and Williams running across the logs was well done and scary. The explanation from the innkeeper about who lives in Alaska and why they choose to be there. The victim's best-friend and her boyfriend told volumes about her without her even acting in scenes with those people. The places in which the main characters lived, and the objects with which they surrounded themselves. But what captured me more than that was the breath taking scenery of Alaska. That alone was worth the price of the ticket. If you want to see desolation at its most beautiful,  majestic finest, see Insomnia.
It may be that this movie doesn't stand up well against a previous film of Nolan's or that it doesn't deliver as well as the original version. All I know is that for many reasons, I was satisfied with it and entertained by it. Now, I'm going to send a complaint to whoever is in charge of the trailer for Insomnia and suggest he/she be fired.",1022544000,,2827,4.543137254901961
1738489,5,B00006AGHD,"In Christopher Nolan's first film Memento, we have a main character that can't remember. In this film we have a character that can't sleep.
While I personally think Memento was a superior film, Insomnia will probably be a more popular movie since it has better known actors and a plot that is much easier to follow. This is not to say the characters are shallow in any way. In fact, the characters were very complex. It was quite interesting that we have in Insomnia a good guy who lies all the time and a bad guy who always tells the truth.
As with Memento, a major theme here is the idea of motivation and the obscurity of what we want to be true and the actual truth. And, as in Memento, the main characters reach a point of no return where they spin off into an uncontrollable nightmare.
Robin William's did an excellent job and surprisingly Al Pacino is actually a pretty good actor when he's not yelling.
To Christopher Nolan's credit, he does not sacrifice the quality of his films in order to be popular and yet nor is he unnecessarily pretentious in any way. Insomnia is a very good movie and will be enjoyable to everyone who isn't allergic to thinking. As an added bonus, the movie is visually fantastic.
I truly look forward to seeing more from this director.",1022457600,,1271,4.482758620689655
1738490,2,B00006AGHD,"This film is a remake of a 1997 foreign film.  I never watched the original, so I had nothing to compare it to.  However, Christopher Nolan (of Memento-fame) directed this, and so I decided to check it out.  I honestly don't know what this film got good reviews for.  (It was surprising to me that George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh even produced it.)  I found it depressing and slow.
I've given up on Al Pacino a long time ago.  He looks old and tired.  His gruff voice and deepset eyes might've worked in the GodFather, but that was 20 years ago.  Hillary Swank plays the role of a rookie detective who's a great fan of Pacino's characater.  Along the way, she discovers he's not exactly what she thought he was.  In NightMute, Alaska where the sun never sets, Pacino is out looking for the killer of a teenage girl.  An accident, however, complicates his life and leads to his insomnia as well as a double-dealing with a certain writer (Robin Williams).  I was highly disappointed and bored.
For those of you suffering from insomnia, this might just be the cure you've been looking for.

============================
L (Language) - 3.5 (zzzz....)

1738491,5,B00006AGHD,"There's a sequence about half way through ""Insomnia"", where rumpled L.A. cop Will Dormer chases a man he believes to be the murderer he's come to Alaska to find, across a log drive.  It's a thrilling moment, especially when Dormer trips into the water and finds himself trapped beneath the logs.  By about halfway through the scene, I realized a startling thing: I was watching 62-year old Al Pacino and 50-year old Robin Williams acting out a footrace.  And it was enthralling.  In hindsight, I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised, for ""Insomnia"" lives to confound its audience's expectations.
That's a strange statement to make considering it's a remake.  But when the original happens to be a 5-year old Norwegian film, one that I've beaten my brains out trying to find in local video stores for years, it makes much more sense.  And when you realize that Christopher Nolan, the auteur-mastermind behind 2000's ""Memento"", you come to expect the unexpected.
Nolan tackles a much more conventional thriller this time out.  ""Conventional"" being a relative terms, for ""Insomnia"" is anything but.  Sure, all the typical elements are there, but it's less focused on bringing those elements together, or on working through the machinations of the plot.  Rather, it spends its time thoroughly dissecting the psychologies of its characters.
In the end, ""Insomnia"" is really about one thing: the slow disintegration of one good cop.  Will Dormer (= dormir = to sleep; yeah, yeah, we get it) is Serpico 20 years down the line: a legend in his own mind and the mind of others.  But his reputation has been severely damaged even before he gets to Nightmute, the small Alaskan town known as the ""Halibut fishing capital of the world"".  And the events of his first day in Alaska quicken the spin of his downward spiral.  This all serves to set up the most destructive force in his life: his insomnia (a motif that would have been terribly important even if they hadn't named the film after it).
Pacino and Nolan, in tandem, do a wonderful job of relaying the experience of insomnia to the audience.  Nolan uses self-consciously tricky camera work, exhibiting hallucinations and lack of focus.  Pacino uses an intense dreariness -- look at his eyes, even more hangdog than usual -- a slurring of speech, and a hunched over gait.  The startling thing is that neither allows Dormer to make excuses for his debilitating condition.  In fact, they allow Dormer to, in moments, flash some of his brilliance for the audience and, more importantly, his new Alaskan cop colleagues, to see.  The tragedy is that he just can't maintain it.
Pacino, who I find overbearing in his louder work, mines the same gold that yielded him Michael Corleone and the aging mobster in ""Donnie Brasco"".  He's quiet, introspective, but not averse to lashing out when the time is right.  It's an astounding performance that reminds you yet again why Pacino can be, when reined in, one of the most powerful and subtle actors ever captured on film.
Robin Williams' hyper-kinetic screen persona has worn thin in recent years.  But like Pacino, when he controls his energy he is astounding.  His work here is a prime example of that.  He plays Walter Finch, a wannabe-cop turned pulp crime novelist-cum-pocket philosopher, who is only a worthy adversary because Dormer is so out of it.  In any other circumstance, he'd be Dormer's breakfast, digested before lunch.  Williams is mostly controlled and cool throughout.  But he also allows all of Finch's insecurities to shine through.  He's not a perfect super-villain, just a man caught in an extreme situation, frantically using the tools he has to get out of it.  It is easily Williams' best work, trumping even his Oscar-winning turn in ""Good Will Hunting"".
Hillary Swank, the cast's third Oscar-winner, starts out slow as Ellie Burr, a local cop.  Her work felt manner and awkward, until you realize later on that she was supposed to be mannered and awkward.  She is putting on a good show for Dormer, a cop she idolizes.  Later on, however, Ellie becomes integral to the suspense: the audience, who know what's going on, become tense waiting for to get up to speed, unsure if she ever will and even if they want her to.
Besides his work with Pacino's psychology, Nolan ably uses all the elements on his director's palette to heighten and expand the suspense.  Quick, subliminal cuts jarringly remind us of important points in the action.  Extreme close-ups allude to secrets yet to be revealed.  And haunting imagery (the plane ride that opens the film, over an endless sea of jagged ice, comes to mind) set a solid tone.  His most accomplished sequence is shot through a dense fog.  Dormer is sure that there's a killer out there somewhere, brandishing a weapon, but he can't see him.  It's a terrific suspenseful moment.  All this dispels the notion that Nolan was a one-hit wonder with ""Memento"".  Clearly he's a talent we can expect a lot more from.
Some have claimed that ""Insomnia"" ends in a typical suspense movie fashion.  I couldn't disagree more.  I enjoyed these frantic scenes thoroughly, for they not only tidied up the plot, but were tempered by some bleak dark humour, a rhetorical device that periodically pops up, when needed, throughout the film.  So from top to bottom ""Insomnia"" is a solid piece of filmmaking, entertaining throughout, and psychologically thought provoking.  What more can one ask for?",1022457600,,5434,4.892896174863388
1738492,4,B00006AGHD,"Al Pacino is airlifted to a remote Alaskan village to help solve a homicide of a 17-year old girl.  Al is frazzled and dog-tired before he even gets there.  He soon finds out that this is the season of 24-hour sunshine.  (Though it is to be noted, the only time the sun really shines is in Als bedroom.) To add to his woes, there is an Internal Affairs investigation whirling about him in L.A., and his partner has just told Al that he is going to turn in evidence against him for his unorthodox methods.  They are met at the plane by super-rookie Hilary Swank who is suitably awed at meeting the great detective.  Some snappy early detective work has the police and detectives on the track of the killer in a remote wooded area.  He disappears into a fog; visibility is near zero, and Al accidentally (?) shoots and kills his partner and then covers up his culpability.
The film intensifies the horrendous pressure Pacino is suffering by showing his frenetic sleuthing coupled with his total inability to sleep.  The final twist of the screw is the murderer contacting him with a blackmail attempthe has witnessed the killing of Als partner. Enter Robin Williams.
Director Christopher Nolan does an excellent job of portraying Pacinos inevitable crackup with lightning fast quick cuts and a jittering scene of audio hallucinations.  The stark and pearly ambiance of the Alaskan scenery is shown in magnificent cinematography.  In spite of the wonders and impressiveness, I don't think Id want to visit any time soon.  I kept thinking: this is high summer, and all I am seeing is snow melt and people running around in their woolies.
The movie has good pace, though if Robin Williams had entered the action earlier, it would have been an improvement.  Pacino overwhelms.  Nolan gives him close-up after close-up until I definitely wanted a little less face time.  Williams gave some much-needed balance.  The story ends a little too tidily and predictably.

His character isn't that great of a person, but he makes you root for him and want justice. Robin Williams was also very good. He was much better as a bad guy in this than in Death To Smoochy. Although that performance might have been scarier for obvious reasons. Hilary Swank was also good. The movie also had some good supporting players, such as, Nicky Katt (Boston Public; he has a funny joke in this movie), Maura Tierney (ER), Jonathon Jackson(ex-Lucky, General Hospital; ok, maybe he's not that cool.) The movie did have some rough camera shots, but it worked for the movie. The editing and cinematography were very good, too. The ending was also perfect for Al Pacino's character. Although, I knew what was going to happen by the previews. I defintitely recommend this movie, especially if you are looking for an adult movie that will please your mind, or you can see J-Lo in enough. (hehe)",1022457600,,1060,4.6436170212765955
1738494,2,B00006AGHD,"I had said that HOLLYWOOD ENDING is underrated, that ABOUT A BOY is overrated, and so is INSOMNIA.
When it's good, it's very very good. When it turns bad, it's sand in your face mixed with thorns and poison ivy.
The first half, about an hour, lives up to all expectations. Cinematography, acting, the tightness of dialogue, the sense of expectation and anticipation of--what?, the minimalism of the acting. This is true except for one scene between Pacino and his co-cop, which felt like ""acting,"" which was all exposition (probably important), but which made my mind wander. Other than that, couldn't be better. I was also pretty sure the Maura Tierney character would turn out to be either the murderer or a crucial link.
Then the screenwriter or director or both did something gutsy. After the midpoint, about halfway through, when, normally, no new characters ""should"" be introduced (screenwriting formula), a major new character was indeed introduced. Good for them. Rule-breaking is always terrific. If it works.
From then, the film decayed into complicated twists and details, chases, melodrama. I suspected that Hollywood people had all sat around saying, Let's spice it up Let's try this and Let's try this and Let's try this. And the writer tried them all and included them all and the second half is garbage. Unbearably complicated, as against complex. The writer threw in so much ""stuff"" that the plot could have gone anywhere, thus leaving the thoughtful viewer out in the cold. Not fair.
Too bad, because this was, for a while and at the end, a great Pacino performance. However, Hillary Swank had nothing to do, nor did Nicky Katt (BOILER ROOM, ""Boston Public"") and were wasted. They also acted as if they were not sure who their characters were. Neither was I. It was not their fault. A good actor can surmount anything but a forceful director who screws them up which this director did.
Robin Williams, also a fine dramatic actor, seemed confused about his role and his closeups made me wonder less about the character, and more about why he goes on Jay Leno's show acting the clown and denying his serious side. Oh well...

7966294,5,B00006AGHD,"I'm not sure why this movie wasn't a bigger hit when it was out.  I think it's top-shelf neo-noir, reminiscent of classic noir like Where the Sidewalk Ends.",1525478400,,156,4.571428571428571

7966296,4,B00006AGHD,"You pretty much know if a movie is worth watching if it is not included on Amazon Prime and costs $3.99 or whatever to rent.

This is an enjoyable thriller/mystery movie, Al Pacino is great (really can punch that ultra-tired, haven't slept in two weeks thing) - awesome locations and cinematography (although I don't think it was actually shot in Alaska, it was somewhere in British Columbia or something)...

Good popcorn movie with your gal on a Friday night kind of movie if you haven't seen it..",1523232000,,499,4.724137931034483
7966297,5,B00006AGHD,One of my favorite whodunnit movies of all times.  Al Pacino gives a class A performance of a tortured man with a good soul gone bad in the face of a fresh new cop trying to follow in the footsteps of her idol.  Robin Williams believably creepy cat and mouse game rounds out this excellent performance and makes this an all together knockout movie.  This movie is gritty and dark but well worth the punch.,1521590400,,405,4.373333333333333
