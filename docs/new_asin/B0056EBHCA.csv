8459489,5,B0056EBHCA,I have been a fan of top gear for many years and this dvd sticks to the humor and basics of how the show normally works. Just think of this dvd as multiple head-to-head reviews taken from a top gear episode. If you are a fan of top gear you will not be disappointed with this dvd.,1357516800,,280,3.9298245614035086
