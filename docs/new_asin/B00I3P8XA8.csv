6248422,5,B00I3P8XA8,"Third season was a bit creepier and even more unrealistic, what with the body in the gatehouse in suspended animation.
Still, interesting.",1407456000,,138,5.318181818181818

6248429,5,B00I3P8XA8,"The entire series is awesome. Great mysteries for 9-14 year olds.  Fun for parents, too. No sex, no swearing, no smoking...and the kids are so busy they don't have all that much time to be stuck in front of screens.  We've watched it 3 times from start to finish, and will likely continue to do so over and over throughout the years.",1453075200,,333,4.354838709677419

8638777,5,B00I3P8XA8,"Initially the back of the package says ""Full Screen"" so I was a little worried. However, the worries went away as IT IS actually Widescreen. The quality is amazing as well, almost HD like. Same goes for volume 1.",1490832000,,212,4.461538461538462

8638782,5,B00I3P8XA8,"I bought this whole series for my niece.  I gave her a couple for Christmas, A couple for birthday and then another special occasion completed the set.  She was excited!  She had got into the series when she started watching them on You Tube.  She was happy that she was able to see them on her tv and finally had closure.  My niece is 13 now and she is very happy with this and the rest of the set!  I would probably even watch these myself!  As far as a review of the actual show, it all depends upon your own taste.",1464220800,,518,4.019607843137255
