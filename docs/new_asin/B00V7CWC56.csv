8709427,4,B00V7CWC56,"Here is a hard one to track down in at least 2.35:1 let alone the CINERAMA version. But it is Blue Ray!

This scope version in Blue Ray can only be acquired in the French release (English track) but unremovable French subtitles. (A way to learn French anyway!!)

A curious film at best but with the late, great Robert Shaw as Custer and Mary Ure (his real life wife at the time) as Mrs Custer, two English actors in a film shot in Spain set in the American West!!!

Still though a very entertaining film and liking Westerns, certainly enjoyable for me. But like the Titanic, you know how it ends.",1475107200,,596,4.351351351351352
