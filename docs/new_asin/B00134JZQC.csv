8249178,3,B00134JZQC,"We returned this because it is just an extract of the children's portion of another DVD by the same author called 'Dances of Tahiti for Everyone'.  This is ok if you are just interested in teaching children but since the other DVD contains this plus adult dances and at the same price, get the other one, not this one.  As for quality, the teaching and songs are very good.",1477785600,,373,4.391304347826087
8249179,5,B00134JZQC,"Excellent production quality.  Healthy, safe, yet vigorous dancing for children and the whole family, with routines filmed outdoors (fresh air & sunshine -- good for kids for thousands of years!).  Moves are made easy and fun in this video.  The adult instructors are obviously highly skilled, and we were amazed by the kids' abilities, too.

This production was clearly a labour of love from beginning to end, wanting to generously share something of this exciting Polynesian art form.  Mauruuru roa.

The producers might want to consider an intermediate level video program for teens someday.",1431475200,,594,5.26595744680851

8249181,5,B00134JZQC,Perfect step by step directions to teach a Tahitian dance. I was able to teach a third grade classroom full of students with little to no dance experience.,1417305600,,155,4.571428571428571
