Instead, Ireceived a Thai version dubbed in with no Enlish subs.
Very disappointed.
I hear this is a great movie.",1404345600,2,198,4.378378378378378
8383011,5,B002WG2FD0,"It is based on a true story. Daniel Henney, plays a young man who was adopted in his early years by an American family. When he grows old he wants to meet his biological parents, and he join the army to do this. He didn't know that his biological dad is in jail in the death row. Emotive movie, that teach you to find the truth before judging. One of the best movies.",1266796800,2,367,4.041095890410959
