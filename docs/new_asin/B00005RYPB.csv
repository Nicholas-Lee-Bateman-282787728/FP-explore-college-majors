1658134,4,B00005RYPB,"After hearing about this movie for months and months I bit the bullet and got it. I'm glad I did because Greenfingers is the sweetest movie I've seen in a long time. The premise is that a group of prisoners are sent to a open prison until their parole as long as they don't escape. After Clive Owen's character successfully grows violets the warden decides to make them gardeners. During all this the men begin to see a life outside of jail and end up at a flower show as well. If you want to see a movie that's different, pick Greenfingers out of the garden of videos out there. You'll be glad you did.",1010880000,5,603,4.252173913043478
1658135,3,B00005RYPB,"Can't see what all the complaining is about..it's a nice little film. Not great in anyway but sort of sweet. How many films about flower gardening are there in the world.
Clive Owen lends his studliness to what would otherwise be bland.",1010793600,,236,4.642857142857143
1658136,5,B00005RYPB,"This is one of those movies that audiences like and critics don't. Despite lukewarm critical reviews, a large crowd was at the screening, and we all seemed to enjoy it.
Greenfingers is funny, moving, and very well acted. Clive Owen gives a magnetic performance as a prisoner who becomes fascinated by gardening, and Hellen Mirren is great as the overbearing English grand dame of gardening. The jokes are wonderful, and the story of people trying to turn their lives around against difficult odds is quite touching.
Those who equate sophistication with violence or cynicism will dislike Greenfingers, but if you liked the Full Monty and Billy Elliott, you'll probably enjoy this charming British film too.
R-rated films come in many degrees of violence, profanity, sexual explicitness, and so on.  This is one of the milder R films I have seen.",1010188800,16,844,5.0285714285714285
1658137,1,B00005RYPB,"Gardening is actually a sort of an interesting subject for a movie, especially for us in the U.S. where we don't see it on prime-time television, but this movie is so terrifyingly god-awful that it negates any points for slight originality. And to be fair, you have to wonder if gardening is the only endeavor not yet portrayed on the screen as an unlikely affinity for the downtrodden to raise their station (all sports have been done, as have art, writing, poetry, and math, Billy Elliot is still on the new release shelves, etc).
Helen Mirren, who rarely miscues, unfortunately phones in her performance, but even her best would have gone unrewarded in perhaps the worst movie ever made involving prison, gardens, England, people, or hats.
Plot summary: Hardened criminals turn to gardening and become law-abiding constructive citizens. Yeah right. Lots of fun watching the big burly men learn about planting flowers. Just be sure to duck when you're the theme of self-nurturing comes at you like a battering ram every ten seconds. But -- and this is super suspenseful -- will they be able to strut their gardening stuff at the big English garden show? What do you think? Might there be a few cameos by famous gardeners? Oooh, what a treat!
From the Hogan's Heroes kind of prison scenes to the worn-out English upper-class stereotypes (with the obligatory heart of gold savior) this movie has barely enough material for a very, very bad made-for-TV movie, and the only ones who deserve prison are the individuals responsible for bringing this nightmare to the screen.
One star because Helen Mirren's still cool. Helen, you owe us a Prime Suspect 6 for this.",1008720000,3,1660,4.890070921985815
1658138,4,B00005RYPB,"The tradition of sweet, dopey, ""cute"" gangsters and prison inmates probably started with Damon Runyon way back in the 1920's and culminated with the musical ""Guys and Dolls"" in the 40's.  The inhabitants of the prison in Joel Hershman's ""Greenfingers"" are more like Runyon's chracters than they are like those of the ""Lock, Stock and Smoking Barrels"" variety to be sure. ""Greenfingers"" is a slight, sweet trifle of a movie lucky enough to have Clive Owen (PBS' ""Second Sight"") and Helen Mirren (also PBS' ""Prime Suspect"")as it's chief chracters. Both of these actors are, as usual, excellent and convincing in their roles. The plot revolves around a minimum security prison where a few of it's inmates discover and nurture a love of gardening which ultimately leads them to enter a big time Horticultural event in England.  The idea of gardening as a way of life and a national passion is foreign to us here in the USA but in England it is very real and very BIG. ""Greenfingers"" is full of good cheer and everyone involved seems to be having a great time.  Who can object to that?",997747200,56,1080,4.73404255319149
1658139,5,B00005RYPB,"Once again I am left wondering if the NEW YORK TIMES reviewer saw the same film I did. Take my advice - ignore the review and see this film! Joel Hershman has created a real gem on a relatively tiny budget - $3 million - but there are no corners cut anywhere. The actors are beautifully cast, and create an entertaining ensemble effort. Clive Owen is, as all breathing females will soon attest, delicious to watch and David Kelly has all the frailty and humor that we saw in him in WAKING NED DEVINE. I am not generally a fan of Helen Mirren, but she was ideally cast here as a proper gardening British lady of a certain age. I was particularly impressed by Mr. Hershman's screenwriting for this movie - very compact, very funny and on a number of occasions very touching without being maudlin. A very rewarding movie going experience in a summer otherwise characterized by mind-numbing violence, speed and foul language. I am looking forward to Mr. Hershman's future work -",996192000,92,974,4.603448275862069

1658169,5,B00005RYPB,"Greenfingers is loosely based on a true story about the award-winning prisoners of a minimum-security prison in the Cotswolds, England.  Most professional reviewers panned it as sentimental, but even though I share a dislike of cloying sentimentality, I loved this story of reforming the system.  I could overlook some of the far-fetched plot twists for its gifts.  The story centers around Colin Briggs, who is played by Clive Owens, and Helen Mirren is also featured; so who can complain? The prison has no fences or lock-down and offers many opportunities to work at various jobs.  Colin discovers he has a knack for gardening, which changes his whole sense of himself.

1658188,5,B00005RYPB,"This one has been around awhile. My volunteer daughter directed me to it.

It is based on true-life events that might seem a little farfetched, but you know the English!

The story is about a convicted felon who is transferred to a new experimental prison where the main thrust is rehabilitation rather than incarceration. Our central character Colin, played by Clive Owen (""The Inside Job"" and ""Croupier"") just wants to be left alone; the prison warden has other plans. Because Colin refuses to choose a vocation, he is put to unsavory tasks, whereby an elderly fellow advises him to become a gardener, because at least he can be outdoors.

To his surprise, he not only has a knack for gardening, he really enjoys it. A local much-celebrated doyenne of gardening, played by Helen Mirren (""The Queen"" and ""Prime Suspect"") needs extra help for a TV special, so she borrows a crew from the nearby prison. The upshot is that after she becomes acquainted with Owen and his uncommon skills, the prison is entered into competition for England's most-prestigious garden show award.

Bingo! Bureaucracy springs into action...

Quirky, sweet and above all, based on real people, ""Greenfingers"" is a satisfying little film.

Fortunately, thanks to some subtle script-writing, the final product is beautiful. The movie never goes too far in stereotyping any of the characters. Yes, there's a ""big, bald prisoner who's really a softie at heart"" character, but he never becomes ""ridiculous"" (well, maybe once or twice). The movie works so well because of how the characters themselves describe their ""redemption."" as realizing that they had the ability to create as well as take away life. I also thought the ending was quite clever, pulling on just the right emotional chords - although I won't spoil it here.

I'm a pushover for British films, so Greenfingers appealed even before I saw the trailer.

This is a charming, hilarious film with a touch of pathos.

It's loosely based on a true story of prisoners in a minimum security facility who develop a gardening talent an go on to place in the coveted Chelsea Garden Show.

Hunky Clive Owen plays Colin, a convicted killer.  Good behavior allows him to be placed in a honor program where he discovers gardening, thanks to his elderly and frail cellmate Fergus (David Kelly).  A chance encounter with horticulturist Georgina Woodhouse (Helen Mirren) sets the men and their mates off to create a real garden and, in the meantime, changes each man in the program.

Owen is a treat for the eyes and does a fine job as Colin, however, he comes across as a little stiff at times.  Still, the film is good, clean fun for all and is one to add to your DVD collection.

After he does well with the prison garden, hortaculture becomes a sponsored work project. As they become a media draw they get political interest as well and find themselves in a quandry to do what they want and what the government and society wants.

This little film brings home some basic truths about human nature in a refreshingly simple, low key way. Watching these men learn, in the words of Clive Owen's character, that they are more than prisoners, that they can bring things to life, is a joy. The performances of Owen, Helen Mirren, Warren Clarke, and David Kelly are remarkable for their restraint in conveying some very powerful emotions, preventing the movie from becoming an exercise in sentimentality and the banal; the ""British"" humor keeps things light.

Clive Owens does a good job of portraying a man imprisoned since he was 18 years old for murder, who ultimately is redeemed by discovering that he can foster life in the garden.  At times Owens is too cold and distant--his portrayal would have been better if he had brought a little more variation in his emotional state.

The supporting cast of British character actors do a nice job and are charming and sympathetic.  Mirren plays the English matriarch with aplomb but overdoes it a little--just like the screen play which tries a little too hard to be cute at times.  The major problem with the movie was a poor soundtrack--it was not well matched with the emotional content of the scenes.

But, get this, gardening ends up changing their lives!  And, after his parole, Owen's character even commits another crime just so he can go back to prison and garden!  And Mirren's character is so impressed with the innmates' gardening that she even has them garden for her!  Wow, where do people get this stuff?

Of course, this being a ""romantic comedy"" and all, there is a romance between Owen and Mirren's daughter that is so incredibly forced, awkward, and contrived that one cannot help but cringe as the two actors attempt to gaze lustfully at each other.  In addition, peppered throughout are moments of in-your-face sentimentality and supposed ""uplifting moments"".  And none of it works.

Case in point:  GREENFINGERS.  Less than half the critics on Rotten Tomatoes gave it a favorable rating, but Amazon & netflix reviewers give it 4  stars.  Apparently we appreciate its typically British understatement, mild humor, and a story which may be slight of plot but which doesn't slight its characters.  (Hmmm...these are qualities which fans of LOST IN TRANSLATION claim to find in that movie.  Perhaps if GREENFINGERS' director were named Coppola instead of Hershman, then he would be up for an Oscar, along with Clive Owen, Helen Mirren, and the rest of the cast and crew.)
If you liked WAKING NED DEVINE or LOCAL HERO or any of a number of small, well-crafted British films about the character of ordinary people, you will probably enjoy this movie.  It lacks gratuitous nudity, violence and profanity, graphic sex, special effects wizardry, and cheap shots at other cultures, but these omissions just make it better.  The film is technically as self-effacing as the performances - - all in the service of story, rather than for calling attention to the makers' cleverness, or hipness, or at least what masquerades as such among the unenlightened.
This is a movie about growth and transformation, not about stasis.  It is about people with the character to make the most of their situation in life, no matter how apparently bleak.

The story, which is based on true events, revolves around Colin (Clive Owen), a prison inmate who's transferred to an experimental prison called Edgefield. There, inmates live with more freedom. There aren't any high fences or armed guards. And each inmate gets to do a job that will give him the experience he needs to get hired once he's released.
Colin is a somewhat anti-social prisoner who won't talk to anyone -- not even his friendly old roommate, Fergus (David Kelly). But when Fergus gives Colin a package of violet seeds for Christmas, everything starts to change. The violets bloom in the spring, and they give Colin his own personal calling. After the warden finds out about the violets, he appoints Colin and Fergus (along with three other inmates) to create a garden for the prison.
Greenfingers is a light-hearted feel-good movie that's guaranteed to put a smile on your face. It's got the same light-but-potent humor as Waking Ned Divine (in which David Kelly played Michael O'Sullivan) -- and it's absolutely perfect for winding down from a long week on a casual Friday night.",1057536000,26,1284,4.8144796380090495

Without getting into the plot, a number of the prisoners charged with various levels of crimes, find themselves involved in a gardening project that eventually leads to an opportunity to leave the prison on a ""work release"" program to do more gardening.  Gardens in England are extremely  popular but one would not expect that some of the best gardeners would emerge from the prison system. Of course, some in the system are against the prisoners going off grounds to work even though it may seem to be a rehabilitative project. This is where the film failed and disappointed me because I didn't care for the ""turn"" the movie took nor its ending. There was a break in quality for the film.  Ultimately, I gave the movie 3 stars - though it is a clear 3 and 1/2 star but that is not an option unfortunately. Clive Owen is great as always.

Not caring about his fate, Colin isn't particularly choosy about which trade he learns and ends up in Maintenance. Eventually, inspired by his elderly roommate, Colin learns to garden.

Although this movie was billed as a comedy, its not, really. I'd call it more of an `inspirational' movie of the sleepy `driving Miss Daisy' variety.

1658288,4,B00005RYPB,"According to the old saying there are only two sure things in life:  Death and taxes; and while that's all very pithy and emboldening in a way that suggests machismo with a John Wayne swagger, it isn't entirely accurate.  Because if there is one constant in life, it's the fact that everyone makes mistakes, and moreover, that if given the chance most will at least attempt to set to rights whatever bitter pill has been wrought by their personal indiscretions and miscalculations, whether felony or misdemeanor.  Which is precisely what writer/director Joel Hershman considers in ""Greenfingers,"" a comedy/drama that seeks out the good in the bad while making a statement about the redemption afforded by the proverbial ""Second Chance.""  Like the amazing gardens at the center of this story, and in which Hershman's metaphor can be found, this film is about the cycle of life; about death and rebirth and hope.  It's a story based on actual events, told by Hershman with warm good humor and in a way that reaches out to the humanity in us all, offered for the contemplation of his audience with an eye upon a world that is in all ways a bit brighter and better.
In his youth, Colin Briggs (Clive Owen) made a mistake; and he's spent fifteen years doing hard time in prison because of it, with no indication that he'll be getting out any time soon, if ever.  But the powers that be have decided he's a perfect candidate for an experimental ""open prison,"" program, an environment without walls that will afford even ""lifers"" an opportunity for parole if they can make good at it.  Initially, Colin is not keen on the idea, but he has no choice in the matter.  He's summarily transferred, and once in his new digs he is befriended by Fergus Wilks (David Kelly), an old man who will pay for his crimes until the end of his days, but who has a perspective on life that has a subtle effect on Colin's future.  It is Fergus who gives Colin a small gift that ultimately turns his life around-- a small packet of flower seeds which Colin proceeds to plant in an unlikely place in the dead of winter with no hope that anything will ever come of it.  Colin, however, is about to discover one of the mysteries of life; that in a seed-- any kind of seed planted anywhere in the world-- there is the gift and promise of life.  And the following Spring presents Colin with another gift-- a surprise that is going to change his life forever.
With this film, Hershman has crafted and delivered a story rooted in a subject that is essentially ""hard"" in nature, but he takes a positive, gentle approach to it that makes it entirely accessible and engaging.  It does, in fact, provide an eye-opening perspective to an area that many are prone to view with a closed mind.  Many (Roger Ebert among them) will claim that the characters portrayed here are predictable stereotypes, which on one hand is true; but on the other hand, stereotypes are often a reflection of reality, which is decidedly the case here, and moreover, Hershman successfully delves beneath that outer skin from which the label is derived to find the uniqueness that resides at the core of each of these individuals.  There are so-called ""stereotypical"" responses and reactions effected by some of the characters here, as well, but again, within the context of the story, they are no more than a reflection of what a like situation in real life would evoke.  In the final analysis, ""life"" is filled with stereotypes, and what is too often deemed ""predictable"" is more often than not a depiction of something that would be more accurately described as ""inevitable.""  All of which Hershman so eloquently conveys in his film.
Though they would never admit it even to themselves, ""professional"" critics with one too many reviews under their substantial belts are often too jaded to appreciate the nuances of a film like this and take the easy way out, seeing only what they ""choose"" to see, and unfortunately it is that dismissive attitude that finds it's way into their comments; one even went so far as to say in print that what amounted to his ""subjective"" opinion was to be taken as the definitive view, inasmuch as he is ""paid to know these things.""  And it is that attitude that diminishes the credibility of the ""professional"" critic, and in the end often renders what they do a disservice to the filmmaker and the audience alike, which is the case in point here.  And it points up the necessity of seeing and judging for yourself; do not be dissuaded from a good thing by ramblings touted as ""educated"" under the banner of a byline, beneath which lies a personal agenda that often supersedes any and all objectivity.
Under Hershman's steady hand the story comes to life through a number of solid performances, most notably Owen, who successfully captures the stoic resolve and acceptance of a man who has paid, and continues to pay, for the single misstep of his life.  And it's that reserved countenance more than anything else that makes Owen's portrayal so convincing, that sense that he sees his glass as half full and half empty at the same time; a kind of hopeful/hopeless attitude that is entirely believable for a man in his situation.
The standout performance, however, is turned in by Helen Mirren, as Georgina Woodhouse, a kind of ""Martha Stewart"" of gardening in England.  She lends some true blue ""character"" to her character and adds a bit of spunk and attitude that makes Georgina entirely believable.  In a wide-brimmed hat and colorful attire that reflects the beauty of her beloved gardens, she is absolutely radiant.  And when you factor in the performances of David Kelly, Warren Clarke and Natasha Little, it makes ""Greenfingers"" a film not only to be seen, but embraced.",1031788800,14,5744,4.728728728728728

Owen is a murderer who is serving out what looks like a lifetime prison sentence. However, he is selected as a trial prisoner at a rehab facility that's purpose is to give him employable skills. There he finds the passion of his life: gardening.  He also finds an older prisoner as his first and only friend in life, soon to be followed by other prisoners he lets into his gardening circle plus the warden himself.

Gardening in the UK is considered quite an art form in and of itself, unlike the way it is considered in the USA, and that is the way this film deals with it.  Helen Mirren plays the grand dame of UK gardening wonderfully, sort of a Barbara Cartland, Martha Stewart and Julia Child, all rolled as one into the UK gardening world.  Owen becomes romantically attached to her daughter.  This is a very charming movie that works on many levels.

Inside the prison, more than one person is amazed to see Colin return: Fergus: [Waking up and seeing the flower on the nightstand, then seeing Colin, who had received the flower as a parole gift] What's that old thing doing back here?
Colin: It wasn't ready for the outside world.

But all is not as it seems in this movie based on a true story. Immediately after the initial looting scene, we flash back to Colin's life in prison just one year prior. Facing his parole board, he learns that he is eligible for transfer to a new program in a lower-security prison. He's become resigned to his imprisonment, and tells the board, ""If you don't mind, I'd just as soon not change.""

Nevertheless, he is transferred, and assigned a roommate, Fergus (David Kelley), and a grim job dealing with the prison toilets. For Colin, there is little to choose between his work and his roommate, whose cheerfulness in the face of life is an affront to Colin's pessimism. He tries to ignore the old lifer, but Fergus refuses to be shut out. Eventually, they bond over the planting of a packet of violets in the snow, and protecting the fragile flowers that bloom despite Colin's conviction that they are doomed.

Like the violets, Colin and the other convicts who become involved in building the prison's formal garden bloom in the regard of professional garden-writer Georgina Woodhouse (Helen Mirrim). The moral is that just as winter and death are inevitable, so too are spring and the flowering of whatever seeds we plant. The path to improvement for the convicts of Greenfingers was to choose which seeds to plant, and then tend then carefully.

The setting is a minimum security or open prison, so cellmates are really roommates, and the call of the sunny outdoors and the lure of the garden will soon spread to a team of enthusiasts.

The piece authentically reflects the notion that gardening can rehabilitate, enrich lives, and generate a lot of joy. Joel Hershman's charming film will perk you up and get you out of doors.
