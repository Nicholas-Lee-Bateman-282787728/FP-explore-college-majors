7155434,4,B00WZNQTEG,"I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was better than most zombie movies. The zombie makeup was cool and realistic, not CGI. I also thought the humor throughout the movie worked really well as far as the jokes and nods to other horror movies. The pace was pretty good, was a little slow in the middle, but the actors worked well together to keep everything moving. I would say this ranks up with Return of the Living dead part one as far as Zombie Comedies.",1435536000,4,459,4.411764705882353
7155435,2,B00WZNQTEG,"It's a shame that Dante got stuck making this. It's as if he has been stuck in 1984 for the last 10 years and can only make those movies. Times have changed, but the films he has been making haven't, and while sticking to your roots is usually a good thing, there are the exceptions, This being one of them. Unfortunately, this R rated sex horror comedy is neither really horror or comedy. It drowns itself in tired material, outdated sex jokes, and dialogue written by a 10 year old in crayon. Overall, it's a good cast (minus Ashley Greene, she's awful) given awful material to work with.",1435449600,2,590,4.472222222222222
7155436,5,B00WZNQTEG,"I had been wanting to watch this movie since I saw the preview for it. I'm a big fan of Ashley Greene and Alexandra Daddario, both are very beautiful and incredibly sexy, but above all are very talented. I thought this movie was very hilarious. I liked how they mixed the two genres of movies together and created a very entertaining movie. I would definitely watch this movie over again.",1435276800,4,388,4.557142857142857
7155437,4,B00WZNQTEG,Good time movie.  Cool characters and fun horror references.  Classic Joe Dante flick. i'd put it right up there with Warm Bodies.  But with more balls.,1434844800,5,152,4.769230769230769
7155438,2,B00WZNQTEG,"There was a time when we could look at Joe Dante as the undisputed king of the genre comedy, in particular when it came to mining laughs out of worn-out horror tropes. Who doesn't love Gremlins? Some are even partial to the far more comedic sequel, Gremlins 2: The New Batch. But Dante hasn't been able to hit his stride in awhile, and unfortunately his latest film Burying the Ex is a lazy and uninspired attempt to recapture the old magic.

Basically riffing on the same ideas seen in last year's Life After Beth, Dante's film stars Anton Yelchin, who seems to be attracted to exactly these kinds of horror-con romps, as Max, an average guy who works in a horror novelty shop. He's also got an insanely hot girlfriend in Evelyn (Ashley Greene), an insufferable environmentalist and super-vegan (has she seen Hungry Hearts? She should.) who demands his unwavering attention and loyalty. She's actually not that bad at first, but when they move in together she ramps up the possessiveness to scary levels, even going so far as to rage out at Olivia (Alexandra Daddario), the sexy and quirky girl at the ice cream parlor specializing in...wait for it...novelty horror flavors. It's like she and Max were meant to be together or something. But that can't be because he's sworn to Evelyn they'll be together forever, and somehow a magical devil locket took that oath a little too seriously.

When Max realizes it isn't going to work out with Evelyn, he's encouraged to break-up with her by his sloppy (yet inexplicably good with the ladies) half-brother Travis (Oliver Cooper). But before he can do it, she's splattered by a bus while crossing the street to meet him. Ignoring that the CG blood splatter looks incredibly cheap, the scene is perhaps funnier than it was intended to be due to Max's look of mixed surprise/grief/elation. Naturally, Max moves on and *shocker* there's Olivia who loves EVERYTHING he's in to. Down-to-earth, into horror and other geeky stuff, looks like Alexandra Daddario...who wouldn't love this girl? But just as they're about to find happiness, Evelyn re-emerges as a frisky zombie and moves back into their home like nothing ever happened. Did I mention she's incredibly frisky for an undead chick? The bulk of the film is Max finding new ways to avoid sex with his rotting zombie of an ex.

There are enough charming elements that you'll wish the rest of the film was better. Yelchin is the perfect everyman for a goofball horror world like this, which may be why he's been at the center of similar films like Odd Thomas and Fright Night. He's great every time he's paired up with Daddario, who gives Olivia a nervous yet sexually aggressive energy that is a lot of fun. Greene is also good as the shrewish Evelyn, although the make-up as her flesh begins to rot is laughably cheap. Actually, the whole thing looks low-rent, and it's not enough of an excuse anymore to claim a modest production budget. We're talking sub TV movie quality here.  But the biggest problem is that there isn't a lick of inventiveness anywhere. That extends from the cookie-cutter characters to the lousy horror-inspired pop culture references which never sound the least bit natural. It's like the screenplay was written by someone desperately trying to sound hip. That the script leaves a few key plot points unresolved and unclear (a key character's death is unexplained, another's return is similarly mysterious) only speaks to how shoddy this whole production was, despite the game efforts of the cast. All of that said, Burying the Ex is pretty harmless and means well. It just isn't creative enough to make you forget about better twists on the zombie genre like Warm Bodies and Shaun of the Dead.",1434672000,4,3713,4.833333333333333
7155439,4,B00WZNQTEG,"Give that ""other"" reviewer a break! ""O=u=c=h !""
The *F*I*V*E* things you need to know about this movie are:
1.) It's a Joe Dante horror film
2.) It's a horror/comedy (ala American Werewolf in London; Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, et al.)
3.) It has a great cast with great-lookin' babes, (Anton Yelchin's [from the Star Trek re-boots] is there FOR the ladies).
4.) The preview/trailer ROCKS!
5.) Great movie to watch about NOT digging up the past, and just BURYING it!

________________________________________________________________
The BEST thing about horror comedies (Monster Squad; Gremlins; Ghostbusters)
is that, often, some REALLY horrific stuff escapes the film board censors when
they are still laughing from a great sight-gag... HIGHLY recommended.
I give this my----personal----highest rating of ALL TEN dead severed fingers UP!

7155451,5,B00WZNQTEG,"Max (Anton Yelchin) is a very laid back person who is dating a manipulative, obsessive, control freak.  Evelyn (Ashley Greene) needs everything to be perfect and always takes whatever is said to her in a negative way.  Max finally decides to break up with Evelyn, but right before he can Evelyn gets hit and killed by a bus.  Max isn't too upset though because he wants to be with Olivia (Alexandra Daddario) the true girl of his dreams.  Max has to try and keep Evelyn from ruining everything and not let Olivia see that he's still with his ex because she just won't take ""No"" for an answer.  This movie is pretty entertaining.  It's very cheesy, but funny.

Ashley Greene is definitely the glue in this movie. She's absolutely hilarious being an overly obsessive zombie with super human strength.  Anton Yelchin and Alexandra Daddario are good in this movie, but definitely far from great.  Max' half brother Travis (Oliver Cooper) is by far the most annoying actor.  Travis is supposed to be funny, but definitely isn't.

I would recommend this movie to people who like campy horror movies.  If you don't like movies like that than you probably won't like this movie.",1467504000,3,1170,4.737623762376238
7155452,3,B00WZNQTEG,"Submissive horror-fan Max (Anton Yelchin) is stuck in a relationship he can't get out of. His domineering but beautiful girlfriend, Evelyn (Ashley Greene) re-decorates his apartment without his permission, won't allow him to drink milk and other such offenses. Quite frankly, Max would rather be with a cute ice cream shop owner (Alexandra Daddario) but doesn't quite know how to make the proper transition. As luck would have it, Evelyn gets hit by a bus and dies. End of story right? Wrong.

A zombie-comedy not unlike, say, ""Warm Bodies,"" ""Burying The Ex"" is the latest offering from director Joe Dante, who brought such beloved genre fare as ""Gremlins"" and ""The Howling"" to the big screen. While not quite up to the standards of said halcyon era, Dante works well within a limited budget and with a capable cast. Yelchin plays the hapless Max perfectly (when will someone give this guy bigger and more prominent work?) while Greene plays the waspy, oppressive and yet irresistible counterpart to a T. Even when the film doesn't quite fire on all cylinders, it remains enjoyable thanks in no small part to its talented young cast.

Unfortunately, the film feels somewhat stagnant in other places. It doesn't quite riff on genre tropes as much as one would hope, working from a surprisingly pedestrian script. Originally conceived as a 15 minute short, ""Burying The Ex"" feels like a small-scale concept stretched too thin. To be frank, this would have made for a great ""Tales From The Crypt"" or ""Creepshow"" segment. As a feature-length film, however, it comes up short. Dante doesn't bring the anarchic spark he brought to ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"" or the heart of ""Matinee,"" becoming another in a long line of horror directors currently spinning their wheels.

It's not that ""Burying The Ex"" is bad, per se. But it all feels fairly pedestrian and, well, forgettable. You could bury this one in your subconscious and just forget you ever saw it altogether. And that's a shame. With a more than capable cast and a proven director, ""Burying The Ex"" should have added up to more than just a pleasant 90 minute diversion. Add it to your Netflix queue, have a drink or two and enjoy the silly shenanigans, but don't be surprised if you forget to call the ""Ex"" back in the future.",1457913600,3,2278,4.820971867007673

7155463,4,B00WZNQTEG,"Max and his beautiful girlfriend Evelyn move in together. At first, it seems pretty awesome until she reveals herself to be controlling, overbearing, and manipulative. It starts out with small things like freaking out over an ice cream server talking to him and then escalates with removing any trace of him from their apartment (including his valuable horror movie posters), replacing it with hideous but environmentally friendly decor. Max has had it and prepares to break up with her, but she dies in a horrific bus accident before he has the chance. He's still sad of course, but is now free to date someone else perhaps with similar interests. Max randomly bumps into the ice cream shop girl who is clearly better suited for him and they hit it off. Unfortunately, Evelyn returns from the dead and expects to make him into a zombie so they can be happy together forever. How can he break up with her now when she's a zombie?

You might find this plot familiar as it is extremely similar to Life After Beth, which I watched last year. While many of the plot points are the same, I enjoyed this film's execution much better. The main character is better portrayed here. Max loves horror films and dreams of owning his own horror themed store. This is a great decision because it automatically makes most of the audience at least a little sympathetic to him because they share that love of horror. I still found him a little annoying. He wants to keep both girls in the dark while having the benefits of being with them both. Admittedly, the benefits of keeping Evelyn happy include living, but he ultimately doesn't want to be turned into a zombie to be with her forever. The emotional benefits to be with Olivia are better and he truly enjoys being with her. I guess if he actually had conviction from the beginning, there wouldn't have been much of a movie.

The plot is extremely basic and predictable, but what makes this film so much more enjoyable than others like it is the actors. Max is all right. He's the quintessential ""nice guy"" that actually isn't all that nice. He's indecisive, immature, and just not in charge of his life. He also lets everyone push him around and doesn't assert himself at all. It got on my nerves especially when two women are vying for his attention. Ashley Greene is delightfully annoying as Evelyn. I just can't help but enjoy how passionate she is about her issues and how manipulative she can be towards Max. While Aubrey Plaza let that opportunity slip by in Life After Beth, Ashley Greene delights in her role and makes it fun to watch. Alexandra Daddario as Olivia is just a ball of sunshine. She's a bit quirky, a little morbid, and seems like a fun person. I would totally frequent her ice cream shop with obscure influences, horror references, and fun flavors. Olivia and Evelyn contrast nicely with their respective passions and contrasting attitudes. The only character I didn't really like was Max's half brother Travis. He was simply a womanizing misogynist who didn't really add much to the movie.

Burying the Ex is a fun, but formulaic movie. It's a better film than Life After Beth, its carbon copy, only because of the actors infusing life into the pretty thin characters. The underlying theme is clear, but relevant. The ex-girlfriend is rotting because there isn't anything to be gained from that relationship any longer. They can choose to stay together, become undead, and be miserable together or they can move on and live happier lives. As a zombie romantic comedy, it's fine, but nothing special.",1443571200,2,3562,4.73268921095008

7155465,1,B00WZNQTEG,"I actually found the film quite mean-spirited and drab.

While the movie is mostly dull and bereft of actually funny humor, I was more annoyed that it didn't deliver on the emotional aspects whatsoever.

It had a means at developing a great narrative about relationships, loss and guilt (especially considering WHY the ""ex"" dies in the first place). However, it doesn't even begin to try and address these actual conflicts. It utterly lacks heart.

The ex doesn't deserve a lot of the flack she receives early on, and worse, the movie features one of the most unlikable male characters of recent memory. He's the brother of Anton, and he's just despicable. From every misogynistic line he spouts to just how cruel a human being he is toward his Anton, I constantly craved for his demise. He made the movie feel mean and uncomfortable. He was so unlikable that his attitude almost seemed unreal. Even if the film had been great, the mere existence of his character would tarnish the movie.

I was hoping with the director's resume of greats and the tone being equivalent to the surprisingly fantastic Odd Thomas, that the movie would turn out like another cult hit, unfortunately, this is just one big miss.",1442620800,2,1206,4.811594202898551
7155466,4,B00WZNQTEG,"This popped up on Netflix, and was somewhat curious. I read the Amazon reviews, and it has an average of 4 stars, so I decided to pass. A couple of the guys in my office recommended it, they said that it was a lot of fun and that it was cute. So I decided to give it a go! And that is completely what this movie is.

I need to preface this by saying that I am not familiar with the director of this film. A lot of the other reviews keep comparing it to his older works, and the only movies I've seen of those are Gremlins (I mean it's a classic, who hasn't?) and Looney Tunes: Back In Action (I actually did not know that he directed this, and this is like one of my favorite movies of all time. It's so bad it's good and I can't get enough of it). The reason that I bring this up is that I have really no comparisons to make. I went into this movie with virtually no expectations, and really enjoyed myself with it.

The acting from Anton Yelchin felt pretty phoned in honestly, but Ashley Greene and Alexandra Daddario were both great. (Plus come on.. how can you not watch a movie with Alexandra Daddario? She's drop-dead gorgeous) The plot is extremely predictable, so don't expect anything groundbreaking there. But everyone has fun with their roles and doesn't take it too seriously.

Parents: This movie is an extremely mild R movie. I wouldn't say there are more than 10-15 curse words in the entire movie, with only 2-3 F words. There is implied sex, but no actual sex scenes. You do see a fair amount of cleavage/girls in bras. There is gore, but it only comes in short spurts and isn't too excessive. Mostly in the last 20 minutes of the movie or so.

I'm one that has almost mastered the art of adjusting my expectations for a movie. I know when to have high expectations, and when to have low ones. This is a movie where if you take your expectations down quite a notch, and just roll with it, you'll come out having had a fun time. I think it would make for a great date night movie.",1442448000,,1997,4.219895287958115

I will probably be watching it again with my son and I don't feel like it would be a chore which is something I look for in a movie.",1442102400,,396,4.090909090909091
7155468,3,B00WZNQTEG,"Gremlins, Innerspace, Explorers, and The Burbs are to name but a few of the gems that Joe Dante has given us. When I heard the premise of Burying the Ex and saw that Dante was directing it, I was all in. His films are always quirky and entertaining. What has always struck a chord with me and his films, is that he truly loves movies (see Trailers from Hell for more proof). Again, this premise of a girlfriend dying and coming back as a zombie was too good to pass up.

Max (Anton Yelchin) is in a very mature relationship with Evelyn (Ashley Greene). She doesnt put up with Maxs dead-beat half-brother, Travis (Oliver Cooper), just like you wouldnt. Max decides that it is time he and Evelyn move into together, but quickly learns that this was a mistake. Evelyn has mommy issues as well as an insane desire to make sure the planet is completely green. Max, who works in a horror costume store, decides it is time to break up with her. He picks the time and place and is on the verge of doing the deed when Evelyn is killed by a bus. She then comes back from the dead and wants their relationship to continue.

Not your normal comedy or zombie film, but at least the third in a new developing sub-genre called  the zombedy. The how is a Satan Genie that might as well have been lifted directly from the Twilight Zone. The why is because Max and Evelyn make a promise to be together forever, a promise she intends to hold him to. The zombifying of Evelyn is really only a metaphor and the story could have just as easily transpired with her being alive and crazy and not letting go. The whole point of the story is that Max has to man up and break up with her. The one down side to this film is that it feels like it takes forever for him to actually do this.

As it is with any comedy, there is usually a third character involved that shows our protagonist how good life could be. This character arrives in Olivia (Alexandra Daddario). Introduced early on the film, while Evelyn is still alive, she helps illustrate just how possessive Evelyn is becoming. A second encounter reveals that Olivia and Max are perfect for each other and the dilemma of a zombie stay at home ex-girlfriend plot has to play out.

As I mentioned before, the point of the film is Max getting the balls to break up with Evelyn, officially. Here may be an instance where perfect on screen chemistry really hurts a film. Anton Yelchin and Alexandra Daddario nail their scenes in such a way that you want to see the whole story of what happens between the violent climax and the leap to our characters final destiny. In may ways, this film may have been stronger as an actual Twilight Zone or part of a TV horror anthology. Yet, those seem to be too few these days.

Burying the Ex is not bad film in the slightest. If you are fan of Joe Dante, zombie films, and even romantic comedies, you will enjoy yourself. Youll just keep asking yourself why Max cant pull the trigger or cut off her head. Bliss is clearly waiting in the wings.",1442016000,,3007,4.351158645276293
7155469,3,B00WZNQTEG,"Joe Dante returns to his horror roots with his latest film ""Burying The Ex"". Although the plot is simple, it is refreshingly simple - in that I mean it is not over indulgent and does not try to confuse the audience with circular logic and over talking, nor does it try to kill us with never-ending plot twists. What you are left with is the classic boy loves girl, then hates girl, girl dies, boy loves new girl, old girl comes back from the grave, boy must choose between undead girl or breathing girl love triangle plot. You know, the typical stuff.

What Joe Dante has managed to accomplish here is simplicity. A simple plot with decent character development and good story pacing. It isn't too long, if anything it's a bit too short. Clocking in at just a shade under 1:30, it's so short in fact that it almost could've been an episode of Masters of Horror or Fear Itself had it been able to be cut down a bit more (and it probably could). What the film did was show that old Monster Kids do still exist, and although a dying breed nowadays, still yearn for the good old days of watching classic horror on Fridays and Saturdays and munching on Fruit Brute and Frankenberry ceral and collecting Monsters trading cards and so on and so on. It definitely amps up the nostalgia factor a bit. For newer audiences, maybe not so much, but there is still plenty there to keep people interested and that's part of what makes this film good. The fact that it did not get wide theatrical release is mind boggling to me. It has a great B/C-list cast with Anton Yelchin (Star Trek, Fright Night), Ashley Greene (Twilight saga), Alexandra D'Addario (Percy Jackson films, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3D, True Detective), and Oliver Cooper (Project X) and it has expert direction by one of the masters of horror and sci-fi, Joe Dante (The Howling, Gremlins, Innerspace, Small Soldiers). It has a tight story with funny moments and good makeup effects. The fact that no one, not even Fox Searchlight, offered to give this movie a theatrical run is truly pathetic.

It's a good movie, so go see it.",1441756800,,2080,4.5588235294117645

She wishes that she and Max will stay together forever. Soon after, she's hit by a bus and appears to be dead. Some time goes by and Max hangs out with Olivia. Evelyn comes out of the grave and lives life as if nothing has changed. Max tries to get rid of her and hide her away from Olivia.

7155474,4,B00WZNQTEG,"Max (Anton Yelchin) works in a Halloween store and has as his life goal to open his own shop. His girlfriend is hot and green ( Ashley Greene). Except for the great sex, they have nothing in common. After she dies, she apparently comes back to life because of a ""monkey paw"" type device he has in the shop. Meanwhile Max has met Olivia (Alexandra Daddario) who knows monster speak and is clearly Max's soulmate.

There are a number of comedy zombie films out there and various zombie spoofs. This one didn't seem to bring any originality to the table. The characters were not that strong and dialogue wasn't running on all cylinders. While the film made me smile from time to time, Joe Dante couldn't pull it off.

7155475,5,B00WZNQTEG,"This movie was such a treat, and I couldn't help but want to show it some love here on Amazon in the hopes that others may give it a try.  My review will be spoiler-free, so you can rest easy.

Max (played by Anton Yelchin - the actor who plays Chekov in the Star Trek reboots) is dating the very pretty but very controlling and unilkeable Evelyn (played by the gorgeous Ashley Greene - perhaps best known as Alice in the Twilight movies).  Max is a down to earth fella who is very likeable and is in stark contrast to Evelyn.  Just as he starts to get the courage to break up with her, she gets killed in a freak accident.  Not to give anything away, let's just say that Evelyn comes back from the grave looking a little rough around the edges and finds Max again.  By this point, Max has met and fallen for another woman named Olivia (played by the also gorgeous Alexandra Daddario - the daughter in San Andreas).  Needless to say, Evelyn will not stand for this.  Also in the mix throughout the movie is Max's half brother Travis - who provides lots of laughs.

Horror fans will greatly enjoy the many classic horror film references throughout the entire movie.  Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are just two of the actors that are referenced.  The production quality is good with crisp photography.  The special effects are good and the undead makeup on Evelyn is quite nice.  Lastly, the four actors really do seem to be enjoying being a part of this movie and are plugged in the whole time.",1439078400,,1497,4.41970802919708

7155477,5,B00WZNQTEG,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

When I hear the name Joe Dante, my mind immediately pulls up the movie poster for GREMLINS.  Then, for some reason, I start ticking down the list of other iconic titles from his filmography:  PIRANHA, THE HOWLING, INNERSPACE, etc.  Dante has been responsible for many films that helped define my youth, and I will go so far as to say hes a genre icon in several regards.  As such, when I heard about BURYING THE EX, I knew I had to see it; Dante has a unique gift for combining horror and humor, and I love how he does it.  Im glad the fine folks at RLJ Entertainment saw fit to grace me with a copy of the film because it is a fun jaunt into horror-comedy territory you won't soon forget.

Dante seems to transform himself every few years, and the results are always interesting.  He did straight-up horror early on, with THE HOWLING and PIRANHAbut then shifted gears into science fiction with INNERSPACE.  Later on, he did SMALL SOLDIERS, which was also a lot of fun.  I cant wait to see where he goes next.

BURYING THE EX is shot well and looks great from a production standpoint.  The film appears to offer a decent production budget, which is utilized well, and the results are evident onscreen.

The acting is top-notch, with Anton Yelchin portraying the main character, Max.  Ive enjoyed Yelchin in everything hes done, from STAR TREK to ODD THOMAS.  Ashley Greene plays his possessive girlfriend, Evelyn, and she does a great job as well.  I had no trouble believing she was a psychotic mess.  Alexandra Daddario is Maxs dream girl, Olivia, and she shines in her portrayal.  Even the background characters are well done; of particular note is Oliver Cooper, who plays Maxs sex-crazed half-brother, Travis.  I loved his performance, and I hope to see him future projects.

The storyline in BURYING THE EX is familiar, however Dante crams it full of dark humor and fun twists.  Although I knew going into the film it would be a recognized concept, I had faith Dante could deliver and make it entertaining.  And he certainly does not disappoint.  The movie is engrossing, comedic, and even romanticwith a nice dose of zombies and gore thrown into the mix.

BURYING THE EX is a big win for me, and I highly recommend giving it a look.  This horror-comedy gem is one every fan of either genre should visit because it has a little bit of something for everyone.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1438819200,2,2489,4.562076749435666

Because odds are that hell be more capable than Anton Yelchin, who incredibly enough manages to turn in only the second or third worst performance in this cinematic disaster.  In his defense, though, unlike the Fright Night reboot (which Mr. Yelchin effectively ruined single-handedly), this movie had zero chance of being good.  The script is a mess, the tone all over the place, and the tin-eared dialogue should offend right-wing Christians and vegan environmentalist in about equal measure.  Its difficult to imagine how anyone could like this film, its lazy and uninspired, a gore feature without gore, a comedy without humor, a horror movie without suspense.

Seems to be a good actor but he was terrible in this film. He clearly wasn't feeling the movie or the script. Something was up. Zero chemistry with the female love interest. Both female leads were decent but the comedy didn't work well because it tried too hard and not hard enough at the same time, if that makes any sense?  A conundrum of a movie. It had potential but it was handled wrong. Stale. Not enough classic stuff. Classic stuff is born from a heart in the right place. This movie had no real heart. It was just faux trendy and because of that, came off a bit embarrassing, especially that zonked on ending where the first end credit was in need of speeding up about 30 more fps more.

Max (Anton Yelchin; Fright Night, Odd Thomas, Green Room) is an omnivorous horror fan living with his girlfriend Evelyn (Ashley Greene; The Apparition, The Twilight Saga) who seems to be his polar opposite, a vegan ecophile who thinks horror is a waste of time.  So, imagine our glee when she dies!

But whats worse than moving in with the wrong girl?  Well, for Max its wishing youll always be together in front of some Monkey Paw-ing relic.
Director Joe Dante (Gremlins 1-2, Piranha, The Howling) has mixed horror and comedy before, but now he brings us more of a HorrorRomCom (HorRomCom?) following the Death Becomes Her (1992) playbook as Max finds himself caught between his recently undead girlfriend and a lovely horror-themed ice cream parlor owner (Alexandra Daddario; Texas Chainsaw 3D, True Detective).

I wish the dialogue was better, but the cast faired rather well with it anyway. Yelchin is likable as always, Daddario is a bubbly meet-cute delight, Oliver Cooper (Project X) delivers the comic relief and Greene seems to embrace her quirky, decaying role.

As RomCom-y as this gets, we still have some gross moments: the embalming fluid projectile vomit, a wicked neck break, some putridly gooey kiss slime and, of course, some zombie attacks.  The zombie attacks are few, but they are awesome fun with some gory flare.

Just be aware, this HorRomCom (or is it a Zombedy, or a HorRomZomedy?) is more about the humor and story than it is about anything horrorific.  Loads of cute giggles, not much gore.",1504656000,,1725,4.9411764705882355
