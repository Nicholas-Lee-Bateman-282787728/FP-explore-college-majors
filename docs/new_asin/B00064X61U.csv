DISCLAIMER: This Biography contains no original music by Nirvana. It is not authorized by Nirvana, their record company, or the Kurt Cobain estate.

As is common with many Chrome Dreams products, this DVD is mistitled. The documentary it includes is actually called: UNDER THE BRIDGE: THE EARLY LIFE OF KURT COBAIN. Additionally, the chapters seem to be mislabelled in the DVD menu as well.

The documentary itself is a video biography of Kurt Cobain that combines a typical narrative with photos and shots of notable locations closely connected with the life of Kurt Cobain (Aberdeen, Montesano, Olympia, Seattle), as well as bits of interviews with people who either knew Cobain before he was famous, worked with him at some point over the course of Cobain's musical evolution, or wrote extensively about him after he did become famous. As the title of the DVD suggests, this documentary focuses almost entirely on Kurt Cobain's childhood, as well as the years which preceded and led to Nirana's success. Kurt's suicide is only hinted at in the last few minutes of the documentary, with Chad Channing offering his opinion on what might have led Kurt Cobain to suicide, as well as a recording of Courtney Love reading part of Kurt Cobain's suicide note.

Interviews include: Charles R. Cross (Kurt Cobain biographer); Peter Blecha (music historian); Del Allebough (schoolfriend of Kurt Cobain's); Leland Cobain (Kurt's grandfather); Darrin Neathery (schoolfriend of Kurt Cobain's); Rod Marsh (schoolfriend of Kurt Cobain's); Tim Nelson (music teacher); Paul White & Steve Schillinger (schoolfriends of Kurt Cobain's); Ryan Aigner (early manager for Nirvana); Chad Channing (former Nirvana drummer); Lamont Schillinger (school principal); several unidentified people who saw Nirvana's very first public performance as a band; Slim Moon (friend of Kurt Cobain's); Tracy Marander [misnamed as Tracy Maranda] (Kurt Cobain's ex-girlfriend); and Jack Endino (sound engineer on 'Bleach').

This is one of the more interesting unauthorized documentaries about Nirvana/Kurt Cobain, if only because of the many points of view it offers through the perceptions and memories the people interviewed recounted. While not an essential Nirvana document, it certainly is a very good place to start for anyone wanting to know more about the person that was Kurt Cobain beyond the image that was conveyed through the media, and even through Nirvana's music and videos.",1358467200,5,2910,5.204301075268817
