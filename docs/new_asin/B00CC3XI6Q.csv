Documentaries have come a long, long way... and, there needs to be something done better than this, to help parents understand the benefits of ""unschooling"" their children. I was hoping to show this to my husband, to make him feel better about our decision to pull our kids out of the public school system... but, after watching it, I realized it was best to refrain from showing him -- it has nothing very convincing in it. I recommend John Holt, or John Taylor Gatto - who both have lots of great videos available on YouTube, or buy their books! The concept of unschooling and homeschooling is great... this documentary is ""not"" great ;)",1479081600,2,798,4.398648648648648
