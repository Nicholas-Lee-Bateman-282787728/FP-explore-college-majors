8546415,5,B00A33J8KW,Brillant silent film starring Joan Crawford! She is young and fascinating to watch in this early and very successful stage of her career. She does more acting with her eyes than stars today so with their whole careers. Thanks to Warner Archive for releasing these old and rare films that were popular when released but have since been forgotten.  No special features,1503360000,,366,4.903225806451613

Its a nice silent movie (drama with some comedy-elements) with Malcolm McGregor and Eleanor Boardman in leading parts. A 19 years old Joan Crawford (in her fourth movie) is playing on the beginning of the movie the young Lady Catherine.

The Picture quality of the Warner Archive DVD looks pretty well. The original orchestra score is used.

FAZIT: entertaining!

P.S: usually I don't like those DVD-R's by Warner Archive and Fox etc. but for any silent movies its ok.",1388620800,,550,4.945652173913044

8546419,5,B00A33J8KW,"This is a very enjoyable and entertaining Silent movie. Picture quality is excellent. A complimentary new score has been added. I think that anyone who enjoys Silent movies will consider this one a winner. It's never boring, often thoroughly amusing, and the characters are easily relatable. The actress who portrays the mature Lady Catherine gives an outstanding performance. The entire cast does a great job. Incidentally, a lovely young Joan Crawford portrays the young Lady Catherine. This movie is all ""win win,"" as far as I'm concerned.",1368144000,6,542,5.241379310344827
8546420,4,B00A33J8KW,"The Circle isn't an outstanding film, but it is very well done and therefore worth watching. With a director like Frank Borzage, you can't go wrong. You can expect beautiful visuals and succinct storytelling.

The story is about history repeating itself. It begins in the 1890s at an estate. Lady Catherine (Joan Crawford in an early role) is married to the Lord of the estate, but she is in love with his best friend. She elopes with her lover, leaving her husband and young son Arthur behind. Thirty years later, Arthur (Creighton Hale) is grown up and wed to Elizabeth (Eleanor Boardman), but she is bored with the marriage and is contemplating running off with her lover the same as Catherine did. In order to be sure, she invites Lady Catherine and her paramour to the estate to see if they're happy. Of course, they're not exactly as she expected.

Set in one location like a play, but not slow-moving or static, this fun film is a breeze. It is also a beautiful time capsule of the 20s.",1356912000,5,993,4.573033707865169
8546421,5,B00A33J8KW,"I highly recommend this silent film. I'm a huge Joan Crawford fan and that is how i stumbled onto this one as she has a small role as young Catherine. The story and the plot are highly entertaining. If you like silent films or films about dysfunctional families this is one that should not be missed. The play was written by W. Somerset Maugham who also wrote Rain and Of Human Bondage, also films that should not be missed.",1354406400,5,424,4.379746835443038
