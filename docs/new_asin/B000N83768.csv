8175487,5,B000N83768,My sister died of Lou Gehrig's. I just wanted the story here.,1417305600,,61,4.166666666666667
8175488,3,B000N83768,"The Lou Gehrig Story on this dvd is a video from the old 1950's anthology 'Climax' which ran from 1954-58.  This one was broadcast on 4-19-56. The cast:

  Harry Carey Jr. (Bill Dickey)
  Russell Johnson (Rusty)
  Harry Townes
  Jean Hagen (Eleanor)
  James Gregory (Coach)
  Wendell Corey (Lou Gehrig)

Russell Johnson is best known as the Professor on Gilligans Island.

This one is a video curiosity, but I like old stuff like this. They made no attempt to make the sets, clothes, etc look like the period. Everything looks like mid-50's.

Strangely, they show newsreel footage of the real Gehrig interspersed with Wendell Corey, who could never be confused with Lou Gehrig. It was live TV and things were done on the cheap back then.

The speech he gave on July 4, 1939 is shown in its entirety, which is the only time I've seen it like this. Apparently it was cut up and rearranged later and that is the version usually shown in documentaries and so forth.

The Joe Louis Story is an actual theatrical movie from 1953, starring Coley Wallace as Joe. He looks remarkably like a young Joe Louis and has the same 'aw shucks' quiet, unassuming personality (at least in this movie) that the real Joe had. A very great casting choice.  I believe this movie (like the similar Jackie Robinson story) was targeted at black audiences who had their own cinemas and film genres back then.

Here's the url for the Lou Gehrig story which appears on this dvd:

It is 'unavailable' in that form, but you can get it on this dvd.",1236384000,,1587,4.83955223880597
8175489,1,B000N83768,"Like the previous review said, the version of ""The Lou Gehrig Story"" that is on this DVD is not the one that is advertised on the box. And the quality is absolutely horrible, as the movies look like fifth or sixth generation copies. Not even worth the dollar I paid for it, and it's unethical that the product is not what was advertised on the box.",1197417600,2,348,4.287878787878788
8175490,1,B000N83768,"The Lou Gehrig Story listed on the cover of this DVD is NOT the version contained on the disc. It's supposed to be the 1978 Made for TV film starring Edward Herrmann and Blythe Danner. However, the program contained is the 1953 ""Lou Gehrig Story"" that appears to have been a live television broadcast. Both programs on this disc are very, very low quality and difficult to watch due to the grainy, blurry picture and poor sound quality. Avoid this DVD in the dollar bin at your local discount store! My copy is going into the trash bin!",1172188800,4,536,4.479591836734694
