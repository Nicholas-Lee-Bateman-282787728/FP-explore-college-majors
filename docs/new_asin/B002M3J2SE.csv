3950816,3,B002M3J2SE,"This version is a bit boring.  The main girl isn't a girl at all, she's a woman. And better lighting could have made it a little less dark and spooky. I bought it for my 6 year old daughter who loves the live show but she won't even watch this one.",1262995200,5,248,3.8627450980392157

8373455,1,B002M3J2SE,Poor copy. There were distorted lines at several places in this recording.,1514160000,,74,5.25
8373456,5,B002M3J2SE,We think this is the best one to introduce children to ballet. The narrator makes it more understandable.,1513123200,,105,4.888888888888889
8373457,5,B002M3J2SE,This ballet is one of my favorites.,1488672000,,35,4.142857142857143

8373459,1,B002M3J2SE,Terrible imagery. I looks and sounds like something recorded in 1950.,1430697600,2,69,5.363636363636363
8373460,3,B002M3J2SE,"This is a perfectly competent production, but for much superior alternatives, turn to either the 2012 Vienna State Ballet production of Nureyev's choreography, the Royal Opera Covent Garden staging, or the Kirov/Mariinsky Theater versions conducted respectively by Victor Fedotov and Valery Gergiev.",1428019200,4,299,6.142857142857143

8373462,3,B002M3J2SE,"I took a chance and purchased this version of the Nutcracker after not seeing any reviews. The film looks like it was recorded from the back of the audience to stage (a bit home video quality). The stage is not the most interesting or pleasing to the eye, but the dancers are extremely talented presenting some wonderful performances. For the price, it is not a bad deal, but I would probably save your cash and splurge on a better production that you will want to watch over and over again.",1267142400,10,491,4.466666666666667
8373463,5,B002M3J2SE,Great music. We bring this out every Christmas because we love it. The whole family enjoys it. The music is great. It's not the best video but very appropriate for a young child.,1265932800,3,178,4.424242424242424
