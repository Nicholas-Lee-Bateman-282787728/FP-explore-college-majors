8123780,3,B000FJTV9M,"Remarkable little set of five-plus hours of content on six discs from the National Archives recounting the invaluable stateside war effort waged by civilian men and women.  Consisting of newsreel footage, training, and yes, even propaganda films, this collection of no less than 29 films (some as short as 3-7 minutes) featuring a number of Hollywood stars like Alan Ladd, James Stewart, Betty Hutton, Humphrey Bogart, and James Cagney fight the good fight for the USA and its Allies during the 20th century's greatest conflict. Many of these were shown in theaters and movie houses during the war years stateside.

Some of these films are truly an outstanding composition of film and music; for instance, ""The Cummington Story"" (1945) a 22 minute piece detailing the true story of European refugees-immigrants settling in a New England town dealing with the indifference and latent prejudice from the Cummington natives and the new arrivals' eventual adjustment to a new environment.  The musical score by composer Aaron Copland is a stirring addition to the cinematography and stirring narration.  So good, it makes one wish this composition was made available on compact disc via Michael Tilson Thomas of the San Francisco Symphony, a champion of Copland's work.

Classic film fans will enjoy ""Skirmish on the Home Front"" (1943) starring Betty Hutton, Alan Ladd, William Bendix and Susan Hayward in this short 13 minute piece on buying war bonds and fighting inflation.  Perhaps the most inspiring is ""You, John Jones!"" (1943) starring Jimmy Cagney and directed by Mervin LeRoy, about personal hardship, commitment and sacrifice with a traditional Hollywood storyline of inspiring hope.  Other films are quite informative in their content with a concentration on such subjects like ""The Big Changeover"" an 8 minute piece about the conversion of a peacetime economy to a wartime one with a focus automakers who produce airplane components and a typewriter company making machine guns to contribute to the war effort.

These sets are available at Ross Dress for Less for only $9.99 compared to the exorbitant amount Amazon is charging here.

All in all, for the WWII history aficionado, a must buy.",1230508800,,2199,5.206798866855524
8123781,4,B000FJTV9M,One previewer expected newsreels and war footage but its really about how Americans were asked and expected to figh a civilian war at home with rations and buying bonds  and preparing for any attacks. The interesting part of this series is seeing the many directors and stars of the time doing these little films that were probably shown in theaters. If your courious how it really was  this is the set for you..I enjoyed it very much. Beware this is not modern day dolby surround sound.,1179878400,3,487,4.651162790697675
8123782,1,B000FJTV9M,"If one wishes to know what the war was really like on the homefront in America, do NOT BUY this DVD collection. I expected it to be newsreel footage from the war years together with hopefully an informed linking commentary.

The films included are almost all Government instructional or promotional films hoping to persuade the public to buy war bonds etc. Laudable as their purpose might have been, when originally produced - they tell us almost nothing about the War on the Homefront.

Buy a book instead - that's what I did.",1170892800,5,527,4.717391304347826
