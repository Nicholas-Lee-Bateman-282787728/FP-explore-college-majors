8498427,4,B006HH618K,"Billy Garberina has tried to do ""different"" genre films as a director.  Yes, they are within established parameters - no 60-minute black & white dialogue-free experimental films or anything like that - but he tries to slip in something that the genre fans will not have seen before.  On his last directorial effort, NECROVILLE, he promised me he had ""killed a vampire in a way you've never seen in a movie before,"" and he came through with that promise.  On top of that pivotal death, NECROVILLE was a fun mash-up of various horror genres (it had vampires and werewolves and zombies, oh my!) all presented via a Kevin Smith-like approach to the dialogue and humor; when I heard Smith was making his own horror film, the incredible RED STATE, I expected to be in the same vein as NECROVILLE (and man, was I wrong).  STIFFED is a zombie film, but to be more specific, it is a zombie-supernatural-crime-comedy, which is a different spin on a familiar trope.

Overall, STIFFED is a strong film.  It is a funny, different mash-up of the ""crime"" and ""zombie"" genres, that has zombies pretty much unlike any I have ever seen.  Truthfully, it took me a while to even click that this WAS a zombie movie, STIFFED is that different.  Sure, it has some drawbacks, but nothing that is so glaring that it makes STIFFED a bad movie.  The good (the script, the performances, the effects) definitely outshines the not-so-good (the video quality, the lighting), and overall I greatly enjoyed STIFFED and am really looking forward to seeing Garberina and O'Leary's next film together.
