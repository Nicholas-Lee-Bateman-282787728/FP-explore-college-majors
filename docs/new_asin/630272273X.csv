503269,5,630272273X,"A year after Pinocchio (Voiced by Scott Grimes) became human thanks to his fairy godmother (Voiced by Rickie Lee Jones), a mysterious creepy carnival comes to town and sets itself all nicely in the opening. The next day Pinocchio had his very first birthday thanks to his father Gheppeto (Voiced by Tom Bosley) and the Fairy Godmother as he is told by her that he must not take his freedom of humanity for granted or else he'll become a puppet again. His father assigns him to deliver a jewelbox to the mayor in town but gets distracted on the way. A con-artist raccoon named Scalawag (voiced by Ed Asner) and his monkey assistant Igor (Voiced by Frank Welker) swindle him as they give him a worthless fake ruby for the box, it upsets his father so much that he decies to runaway and it also upsets his new living toy bug named Gee Willakers (Voiced by Don Knotts). He decides that he wants to join the carnival but gets seduced by a lovely girl puppet named Twinkle (Voiced by Lana Beeson) who is the main star of the show but is tricked by an evil puppeteer named Puppetino (Voiced by William Windom) who is the title villain's minion and he transforms Pinocchio back into a puppet. He does get rescued by his fairy godmother later to be human again as he must find the two scoundrels that swindled him earlier yet he does as they go after the traveling carnival only to end up in the nightmarish hellish realm of the empire of the night conducted by the diabolical Emperor (Voiced by James Earl Jones) who wants Pinocchio's soul.

Co-starring Jonathan Harris and Linda Gary, this is an awesome and overlooked animated fantasy gem from Filmation (Makers of He-Man, She-Ra, Bravestarr, Ghost Busters, Fat Albert and Star Trek animated) and New World Pictures in 1987. The film took five years of hard work from the company as it was their most expensive project ever but unfortunately it did bad at the box-office and got mixed reviews as now it has a small cult following. I'd say this is Filmation's best animated movie around! i love how it doesn't focus on stock animation that the company is known for but actual true animation and i also like how it's faithful to Collodi's vision of the Pinocchio books. It's a nice sequel to the classic fairy tale and up there with Disney's Pinocchio as the second best Pinocchio movie ever, this movie is just as dark as Carlo Collodi's book and Disney's version but more disturbing and eerie even with that horrifying moment where Puppetino turns Pinocchio into a puppet.

The songs are quite good like the powerful ""Love is the Light Inside Your heart"" to the fun and upbeat ""Your a Star"". I also love how well animated and drawn this movie is and the voice acting by the cast is solid including the brilliantly executed Emperor himself. I was 6 in 1987 as i remembered on christmas night i went to see this at the mall with my mother and this scared the living crap out of me yet i loved it the same as i do with Disney's version but some parts creeped me out at that age. It's one of my favorite animated movies of all time and a perfection companion for anyone who loves Disney's version or who likes rare cult animated movies.

Starz/Anchor Bay or Shout Factory need to release this on DVD badly in a special edition but look online for this movie to take a look as it's a lost diamond in the rough but maybe too intense for small children as it nearly got a PG rating, great fun.

503270,3,630272273X,"A year after Pinocchio's fairy godmother made him a real boy, he requests the task of delivering a special music box made by his father, Geppetto (Tom Bosley), for the mayor of their village. Of course, Pinocchio (Scott Grimes) gets sidetracked by a carnival and two greedy con artists, a raccoon named Scalawag (Ed Asner) and a monkey named Igor (Frank Welker). As you might expect from Pinocchio, he ends up trading the music box to the pair for a fake gem, and when he is scolded for his foolish mistake, he runs away so he will no longer cause trouble for his father. Pinocchio finds his way back to the carnival and a bit of trouble, but even that doesn't teach him a lesson. He soon is on a river journey with Scalawag and Igor to find the ship the carnival is traveling on, as it now carries the music box and also a beautiful, female puppet Pinocchio has grown fond of. But the carnival ship holds a mysterious secret! It's really the home of the wicked Emperor of the Night (James Earl Jones) who travels the land tricking children into giving up their freedom!

Made by Filmation in 1987, ""Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night"" might be exactly what you expect in some areas, and a bit of a surprise in others. For one thing, the animation, for Filmation, is probably above what you'd expect. Granted, it's a bit inconsistent, as it gets much better in the 3rd act. In fact, the film itself gets must better, as the middle drags somewhat, in no small part due to the insect sidekicks that could easily have been written out of the film all together. In fact, meaning no disrespect to Don Knotts and Jonathan Harris, their wooden glow-bug and bumblebee characters really were the low points of the film. They simply were not necessary, and at times the movie focused on them entirely, never with very interesting results. The film boasts some original songs that aren't too shabby, but the general background music the rest of the time is nothing special. In general, it's a decent film, or it would be without the bug characters which I really feel were only included to remind one of Jiminy Cricket. In fact, the wooden glow-bug the fairy brings to life as a birthday gift for Pinocchio is named ""Gee Willikers,"" another bit of expressive slang. The film also carries the stigma of appearing to be a wannabe sequel to the Disney classic. Of course, anyone can make public domain fairytale films, but it does seem suspicious that Filmation decided to start with sequel films rather than first trying their hand at something like Rapunzel or Little Red Riding Hood. Yes, another one they made was ""Happily Ever After,"" a Snow White sequel. Clearly there was a hope here that doing a sequel story to something Disney had already done a successful original of might lead to higher ticket sales. Nevertheless, ""Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night"" is worth watching for its highpoints, which include its musical numbers and its whole third act. None of it is at Disney's level, but it's a nice bit of animated, 80's fantasy entertainment, if you find that type of film entertaining in general.",1190332800,2,3104,4.643636363636364
503271,3,630272273X,"Produced at a time when animation was in a serious slump, this rather curious feature, produced by Filmation Studios, attempts to make a sequel out of a now famous fairy tale, Carlo Collidi's PINOCCHIO.  Walt Disney had made the story popular in his lavishly animated and emotionally powerful motion picture, and to this day it remains a masterpiece.  Based on that, there is no way that this 1987 continuation could ever compare.  Regrettably, the artistry in this movie doesn't live up to the original either.  For a production made by 400 animators in three years at a cost of $8 million, PINOCCHIO AND THE EMPEROR OF THE NIGHT looks pretty shabby, no better than an average Saturday morning cartoon.

There are also many instances where this movie attempts to steal thunder from the legendary Disney masterpiece, too.  In place of Jiminy Cricket, we have a wooden-carved glowbug named Gee Willickers (voice of Don Knotts); a con artist raccoon named Scalawag (Ed Asner) and his pet monkey Igor (Frank Welker) in place of Honest John and Gideon (these characters shift into true allies in the movie); standing in for Lampwick is a pretty blonde named Twinkle (Lana Beeson) who serves as a sort of love interest for our hero.  Finally, in the roles of the nasty puppeteer and nasty Coachman we have the shady-looking Puppetino as well as the titular villain, a sort of titanic, nightmarish robed demon with multiple arms and the booming tones of James Earl Jones.  Unfortunately, these stand-ins could never hope to hold a candle to their predecessors or emerge as particularly memorable creations on their own.  There's even a half-man half bumblebee who attempts to provide comic relief, but comes across as nothing more than a ""buzzing"" nuisance.

Set one year after Pinocchio has become a real boy, this second chapter begins when a scary looking carnival comes into town.  Our not so wooden hero runs away to the carnival after bungling a special errand for his father, Geppetto (he had been conned into giving up a precious jeweled box to Scalawag and Igor).  In a rather frightening sequence -- one of the few that actually emerges as truly effective -- Pinocchio is transformed into a puppet again after being seduced to the carnival by the mustache-twirling Puppetino.  Rather predictably, the Fairy Godmother (lamely voiced by Billie Lee Jones) rescues him, and the usual adventures ensue which lead up to the obligatory final showdown with the main villain.

In addition to providing a rather uninspired plot, PINOCCHIO AND THE EMPEROR OF THE NIGHT unwisely also recycles concepts from the first movie; Pinocchio lies to his Fairy Godmother again and his nose grows, Geppetto sets off to find his missing boy, Pinocchio is still gullible enough to trust ne'er-do-wells Scalawag and Igor after they deceive him one time, and everybody ends up at an amusement park where naughty boys can do whatever they please.  All are routinely and lifelessly presented, although the latter sequence is trippy and creepy enough to stand on its own; Pinocchio gets drunk in this scene, too.  The scene where Pinocchio dances and sings with glittery showgirls is also pretty schizophrenic, but again, it brings up reminders about a similar and more believably executed scene from Disney's film.  The movie is also handicapped with a rather dreary synthesizer-driven soundtrack and unmemorable songs; the Fairy Godmother's song is acknowledgingly nice, but nowhere near the same caliber of ""When You Wish Upon A Star.""  Furthermore, of the vocal performances, only Scott Grimes as Pinocchio himself stands out, but a majority of the remaining cast are pretty much run of the mill (as mentioned, the Fairy Godmother is the worst offender--sounding totally lifeless and boring throughout).  Even James Earl Jones, awesome a voice though he may have, doesn't have much to do with his scanty role of the Emperor of the Night.

Taken on its own, this PINOCCHIO sequel is passable fare, although some sequences do come across as too frightening for youngsters (particularly the appearance of the central villain), and others ineptly silly for grown-ups.  There are some creepy sequences and moments of genuine terror, but all in all, children and parents aren't likely find much magic within its 95 minute running time.  In all fairness, PINOCCHIO AND THE EMPEROR OF THE NIGHT is not as disastrous as Roberto Benigni's travesty, but it lacks that certain special magic to achieve anything close to classic status.  As it stands, it's only so-so.",1187913600,,4534,5.048257372654155
503272,4,630272273X,"I watched this around the same time as I first saw Unco and it still has stayed with me. I never was much for Pinocchio side kicks in it, but the Emperor himself is a truly fearsome sight and I love the fact that at the very end after the evils defeat, the puppet Pinocchio loved so much was turned alive. I am 20 myself and I have to say, age doesn't matter when it comes to classics, and this is truly one of them. For those looking for movies of the same type Little Nemo would be another great film to pick up:)",1062288000,2,515,3.9615384615384617
503273,2,630272273X,"I saw this movie when I was about 10 years old.  I thought it was the greatest ever.  I was dazzled by the animation, esp of the Fairy Godmother and the Emperor of the Night.  I also loved the song ""Love is the Light Inside Your Heart"".
I guess the perceptions of a 24 year old are very different from those of a 10 year old.  I received the video and was disappointed.  The animation was terrible, the sound was bad and the story was overly simplistic.  Even the song wasn't as I'd remembered it.

This movie not only has some of the same voices as Disney's Pinnoccio, but follows the natural progression of the genre. ""Emperor of the Night"" is a much darker tale though. So while it isn't recorded in encyclopedias, for unknown conflicts of interest, ""Emporer of the Night"" is related to Disney's ""Pinnoccio."" I believe kids who have seen Disney's ""Pinnoccio"" will love this movie too.

7830338,5,630272273X,"""PINOCCHIO AND THE EMPEROR OF NIGHT"" may not have been a commercial hit,where the Box Office was concerned,but it left an impressive
and sincere piece of serious animation work,from the people of Filmation Associates,and it's founder,Lou Scheimer,who labored for two years producing this animated movie,which was to be the first of many full length animated productions that the studio had originally planned on doing,before they closed down their studio in early 1989,which ended a 25 year journey,for a West Cost animation studio,known for it's limited animation,but a highly successful
competitor to Hanna-Barbera,and other studios back in it's time! Lou Scheimer was highly committed to doing all the cartoon productions in his California studio,rather then going overseas,as most cartoon studios did in those days,to cut costs,and for cheaper labor! and when production for this Pinocchio
feature was being worked on,the Filmation artists/animators put great quality and hard work into this well intended labor of love,which was eventually released in late 1987 by the now defunct New World Pictures company.  can't really speak for everybody here,because Filmation Associates and it's cartoon history,isn't something that everyone will like or agree with-but for serious fans like myself,it has been a never ending joy,to have watched this studio progress into a higher quality of animation,despite their fiscal limitations,they still managed to crank-out a damn good product,and they thrived in their creative limitations,with satisfactory results! the songs in ""PINOCCHIO AND THE EMPEROR OF NIGHT"" which were done by Steve Tyrell,were also well made,and the stellar voice cast,led by Scott Grimes,Don Knotts,Tom Bosley,William Windom,Ricky Lee Jones Ed Asner,and James Earl Jones (""STAR WARS"") sure made a big difference,along with with the voice of Jonathan Harris (""LOST IN SPACE"") who had an impressive history with Filmation. the studio was also going to do a spinoff TV series based on this movie,called ""BUGSBURGH"",but they never got that chance! my favorite scene in this movie,was the Fantasy dance sequence with Pinocchio and the girl puppet-it showed just how good the Filmation animators really were,when they were given a wider budget! but before this full length animated movie,Filmation also did ""JOURNEY BACK TO OZ"" in 1974,also an impressive effort,which was another labor of love and creativity,especially back when the studio was doing ""THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN""
and ""THE BATMAN-SUPERMAN HOUR"" for CBS's Saturday morning line-up in the late 60s! i seriously recommend ""PINOCCHIO AND THE EMPEROR OF NIGHT"" for those,who can truly appreciate well drawn cel animation,and the creativity of a studio like Filmation,and the progress that they made,before the curtain fell on their animation business,,truly a fine work of art,and a treat for the whole family to enjoy!!",1442102400,3,2896,5.596810933940774
