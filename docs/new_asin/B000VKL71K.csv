8304851,1,B000VKL71K,This DVD is really a long advertisement for Hung Rip artists.  There is only one appearance of Lynch in the whole flick and it's brief.  There are a couple of interviews with some underground artists which are kind of cool to watch through once.  What I really want to know is: what is that song Luni Corleone (Lunasicc) is rapping in the booth?  It has Cat Stevens as the hook and sounds pretty sicc.,1229126400,,401,4.378378378378378
