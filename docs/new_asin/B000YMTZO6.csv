8233517,5,B000YMTZO6,"This is a wonderful collection of videos portraying the very young engaged in natural play and free movement. They highlight the importance of allowing the young to move and learn ""on their own with our help"". These are videos from Resources for Infant Educarers and Magda Gerber. If you are not familiar with her work, I recommend that you see for yourself the beauty and simplicity in her methods.
These are appropriate for anyone working with infants and toddlers. They are also excellent training tools for staff at child care centers, and for use by teacher educators. I have used them for training purposes with much praise by my adult students.",1236470400,5,651,4.873873873873874
