6200525,5,B00HRJVHMW,Was able to see this film at a film festival and thought that it was incredible. A thriller that keeps you guessing with fine performances from the cast.,1394409600,,153,4.5
6200526,5,B00HRJVHMW,My husband & I were able to see the movie at a showing in Reading several months ago.  It was well written and cast was excellent.  Really did not see the end coming & can't wait to see it again so I can pick up on all the clues pointing to it!  We loved the psychological approach and study of human nature.  It was especially fun recognizing places in the area where we live.  Can't wait to share it with friends & family & look forward to Stewart's next endeavor.

6200527,5,B00HRJVHMW,"I saw The Suspect at the Philadelphia Film Festival and was blown away.  This movie is beautifully shot and acted, and it really makes you think. The twists and turns are surprising and force you to contemplate race, personal perspective, bias.  I can't wait to see it again.",1394409600,,275,4.708333333333333
6200528,5,B00HRJVHMW,Great movie! Loved the twists in the plot and great acting. I love when a movie keeps my attention.  Can't wait to own it on blu-ray.,1394409600,,133,4.115384615384615
6200529,5,B00HRJVHMW,Saw this in pre-release at a film festival.  It is very intriguing with its story line and unexpected twists.  Would recommend.,1394323200,4,127,5.0
6200530,5,B00HRJVHMW,"I thought the acting was suburb, the plot very interesting and the twists unreal - loved it! I highly recommend!",1394323200,3,112,4.65
6200531,4,B00HRJVHMW,I really enjoyed this suspenseful film.  Can't wait to get  it on DVD. Mekhi Phifer fans will not be disappointed!,1394323200,4,114,4.65
6200532,5,B00HRJVHMW,"Caught this ""Memento""-style mind-bender at the Philadelphia Film festival and found it quite intriguing.

I've wanted to see it again since last October because it really seems to be the kind of movie that rewards a second viewing. That for me is the benchmark for a blu-ray I want to own.

Great, nuanced performances throughout.",1394323200,3,330,4.9818181818181815
6200533,1,B00HRJVHMW,Didn't get to finish the movie. Expired in 2 days. Didnt allow me to watch over again. Although it tells you 30 days.,1414454400,,117,4.130434782608695
6200534,5,B00HRJVHMW,"My son told me that he had watched a part of this movie, and what he had seen was really interesting but he hadn't seen the ending. So we ordered it from Amazon and watched, what a great surprise this movie was! Very entertaining, the storyline was absolutely genius, and the ending was nothing less than perfection! My son and I really enjoyed watching this movie, and we ended up having a very impromptu movie night. I would recommend this movie very much, it's a great story, and Mekhi Phifer was excellent in his role.",1413158400,,522,4.505263157894737
6200535,5,B00HRJVHMW,Good action movie,1412726400,,17,5.0
6200536,4,B00HRJVHMW,"Good movie..., challenge all of the present day questions of race relations while adding a twist",1410566400,,96,5.0625
6200537,4,B00HRJVHMW,"I own over 1800 dvds and I can tell you that this one is different. Things are not what they seem in this movie or like it says on the cover ""Nothing is black and white"". The acting in this movie is well done, I always considered Mekhi Phifer and excellent actor. Sterling K. Brown and William Sadler both do a pretty good job also. I don't do spoiler alerts, so I cannot even tell you what this movie is about, because what you think it is about will keep changing.",1408838400,,466,4.131868131868132
6200538,1,B00HRJVHMW,"Yawn....... Ummmm yeah, don't waste your time. Poorly written and acted.",1408147200,,72,5.636363636363637
6200539,2,B00HRJVHMW,"This was a different sort of movie, however, the plot just went bad bad wrong.",1406678400,,78,4.266666666666667
6200540,2,B00HRJVHMW,"Poor acting, poor movie, implausible storyline",1405814400,,46,6.833333333333333
6200541,5,B00HRJVHMW,"I truly love watching anything Mekhi Phifer has a role in, he gives an awesome, thrilling unexpected twist in the end, well worth watching",1403913600,,138,4.791666666666667
6200542,2,B00HRJVHMW,Don't even bother wait till they show it in regular channels maybe fx . Or hbo or show time is not even worth seeing on netflix,1403568000,,127,3.923076923076923
6200543,2,B00HRJVHMW,"The Suspect has all the polish and professionalism of some grad-school students final project for a PhD in Cinema.

The premise of the movie is so improbable and loopy that it requires a complete suspension of disbelief even to get through it. However, I won't reveal what that premise is, for to do so would be to engage in the biggest plot spoiler since The Crying Game. All I can tell you is that it involves two African-American men who may have robbed a bank in a rural Midwest community. May is indeed the operative word here, for it turns out there is far more to the story than what appears on the surface.

If all that sounds somehow intriguing, then Im doing more justice to the movie than it actually deserves. I don't question the good intentions of those who made the film, but it so ineptly directed and so badly acted, so filled with screeds and bromides about racism and justice, and so bogged down by over-earnest plotting and a confusing time-shifting narrative, that even the best of intentions cant make a silk purse out of this particular sows ear.

Ive deliberately avoided identifying the individuals responsible for The Suspect, both those in front of the camera and those behind it, and I wish them nothing but the best in their future careers in moviemaking. But I doubt anyone will be rushing to claim credit for this underwhelming, if well-intentioned, cinematic misfire.",1403568000,,1399,4.725409836065574
6200544,4,B00HRJVHMW,"Intricately written with twists and turns, it keeps the audience guessing how the plot will be resolved. The movie revealed more than one way that law enforcement dealt with the bank robbers, showing their biases and the difficulty they had with  threats to their authority. Lessons were learned while holding the audience in suspense through to the end.",1401580800,,354,5.103448275862069
6200545,4,B00HRJVHMW,"A bank has just been robbed and small town ""by the book"" Sheriff Dixon (William Sadler) has a man (Mekhi Phifer) in custody. While interrogating the man about the robbery our suspect constantly tries to goat the sheriff into making a racist comment. The film is filled with flashbacks to present a twist and continued to have flashbacks within a flashback.

The first twist comes early as we find out our suspect had a partner and did indeed rob the bank. The second twist at about an hour into the film was expected as the film dropped a clue.

The final twist didn't seem to have much of a clue and goes against character established in the film, although should have been expected.

A mild thriller.  3 1/2 stars.

Parental Guide F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1401580800,,758,4.544117647058823
6200546,1,B00HRJVHMW,"Find out all the plot shake ups and watch this again, and almost none of it makes any real sense.  When part of your plot hinges on banks not being able to recognize counterfeit money, you are building your house on very shaky ground!",1401580800,,234,4.318181818181818
6200547,4,B00HRJVHMW,"Watched this as a 'showing' with the rest of my family and we all thoroughly enjoyed this smart flick! Never saw the ending coming, at least the ending that actually is. The movie is well thought out and smartly written. I can easily recommend this movie as one that keeps you thinking about it, long after the credits have rolled.",1401580800,,331,4.533333333333333
6200548,2,B00HRJVHMW,Suggest you make a judgment on the motivation of a number of the 5 star reviews and the respective reviewers before you decide to spend your money to view this film based upon the ratings.  Amazon should devise a method to assist prospective viewers in assessing the credibility of high ratings that may be suspect.  Amazon should not want or need business generated in this manner as it places doubt on the integrity of the company.,1401148800,,433,4.684210526315789
6200549,3,B00HRJVHMW,Back and forth story and so slow.  Need a bit of a punch now and then. Would not watch again.,1401062400,,93,3.65
6200550,5,B00HRJVHMW,"Just when one twist of the plot is revealed, another comes into play. Just when the movie starts to make sense, something else will happen leaving you to think, ""I didn't see that one coming."" I (personally) really liked this movie and definitely recommend it.",1400976000,,260,4.8
6200551,4,B00HRJVHMW,"well thought out story thought provoking , a few b movie moments that were erased due to superb acting by the cast. This movie could have easily been rated a 3 if not for the actors",1400544000,,181,4.055555555555555
6200552,5,B00HRJVHMW,"Loved this movie!  It keeps you guessing until the end. I love movies that make you think, that have a point. I do not like reviews that give you the plot, tell you the story and  give away the ending. This is not one of those reviews. I will tell you that this is an riveting movie about two black men who are trying to accomplish something, which they choose to attempt in solely white communities. The racist atmosphere that exists in this kind of community, whether it is open or just under the surface, helps these two black men carry out their plan. There are lots of twists and turns, and topics to discuss social conditions after the movie.",1399939200,,648,4.391666666666667
6200553,2,B00HRJVHMW,"Couldn't even get through this movie stopped it a half hour in, the acting was below average the story line did not impress me, do not waste your time on this one......",1399507200,,168,4.28125
6200554,5,B00HRJVHMW,"Stuart Connelly gives us another cinematic gem. Highly recommend due to superb script, directing, and actors' performances. Especially love movie's ""twist and turns"" that elevate this work.",1398988800,,189,6.037037037037037
6200555,1,B00HRJVHMW,"I generally like all movies, even the ""bad"" ones. This movie, however, was by far the worst movie I have ever seen!!!",1398729600,,117,4.363636363636363
6200556,5,B00HRJVHMW,"Nobody is completely innocent in this police/crime/sociology tale that could be titled ""Race, Lies and Videotape"". The acting is superb. The audience's assumptions are slowly ripped away, one by one, as the true story emerges. With any good story, we are left with questions as well as answers when it's all over. One thing for sure: Viewers will be thinking and talking about this film for a long time, and wondering when they can watch it again.",1398556800,,447,4.818181818181818
6200557,1,B00HRJVHMW,"Bad movie. Bad acting, TV pacing. Just another straight-to-video movie. What's worse are all the ""5 stars"" reviews here. All almost done on the same day. All have one movie ""review."" This one. So all these people think this movie is a 5 star movie? ""They"" all saw it somehow before it was actually released anywhere?

Again, people who work on a movie should not be able to ""review"" anywhere. When I see these schill reviews all over the place, makes me hate the movie before I start watching it - and lo and behold this movie lived up to what I thought it'd be.",1398038400,11,562,4.352380952380952
6200558,2,B00HRJVHMW,"The premise of investigating prejudice in police behavior by being arrested for a crime and then saying it was all a hoax was a promising plot, except -
1. The plot hook of robbing banks was too overly far-fetched largely because of the safety and legal issues to participants, bank employees, customers, police, pedestrian traffic, etc. should an unexpected event turn tragic.
2. That supposedly a University signed off on this is ludicrous. A poorly designed research method that could have been done in many other and safer ways with more accurate results. That several other police, banks and officials later dismissed their participation and swept it under-the-rug is not very likely.
3. The extreme stereotyping of a bank employee, police and others greatly reduced the credibility of the story which is a shame because the story's premise had potential to be a truly educative tool.
4. The ending created for a dramatic effect was more laughable than real casting yet another nail of make believe into what could have been an impactful script.",1397952000,3,1050,5.040229885057471
6200559,5,B00HRJVHMW,This movie had me guessing right up to the end. Then I had to watch it again! A shake your head thriller!,1397520000,,105,3.8181818181818183
6200560,5,B00HRJVHMW,"you are surprised again!  Lots of twists and turns, with the biggest twist at the end.  This film leaves you thinking about when in time, and where in the world could something like this happen?  I saw the movie on the big screen in Philadelphia and was blown away by the cinematography - definitely worth owning or renting a Bluray if you appreciate top notch color and lighting.
This is the kind of film you need to watch at least twice to get everything that's going on.  If you liked ""The Unusual Suspects"" and ""Memento"" and/or you like Mekhi Phifer and William Sadler, you will love this movie!",1397088000,2,599,4.518518518518518
6200561,4,B00HRJVHMW,"Really enjoyed this movie.  It was not at all what I expected, great plot twists.  I definitely want to go back and watch it over again.  Mekhi Phifer, William Sadler and Sterling Brown were all excellent!  B++",1396915200,2,210,4.594594594594595
6200562,4,B00HRJVHMW,"""You're not from around here. You got no identification. You got no car. You're covered in dirt like you've been digging somewhere and to top it all off..."" Two college professors are working on a study in racial dynamics and bias. They plan to rob a bank in a small town record how they are treated before they give the money back. Things are going as planned until they find a sheriff (Sadler) who will stop at nothing to get a positive identification. When the partner doesn't show up with the money to prove it's all an act things take a serious turn. This is a difficult movie to review. It is very good but it's hard to talk too much about it without giving anything away. I will say though that the movie at the same time breaks down and supports certain stereotypes, when you watch you will see what I mean. The best part of the movie though is that you never are quite sure what is going on and it keeps you guessing all the way until the end. This is the type of movie where there is really no defined good or bad guys. That makes a movie more fun to watch. Overall, a movie that stays one step ahead of you the entire time, I like movies like that. I give this a B+.",1395532800,8,1177,4.14410480349345
