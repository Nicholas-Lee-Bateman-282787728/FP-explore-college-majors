8629379,4,B0013K07YA,"Lili and the Baobab was a very ""soft"" film that did an excellent job of articulating the issues at hand.  By soft, I mean that the movie did not have any excessively dramatic or overbearing scenes.  Still, producer Blanche Guichou managed to tell a dynamic story.

I found the relationship between Lili and Aminata (the two main characters, so to speak) very moving; it was one that truly touches the viewer and serves as evidence of the universality of human emotions. In spite of language barriers, the two women form an enduring friendship that would have been incomprehensible for me to imagine prior to watching Lili.  Their friendship reaches such a profound level regardless of the fact that they can barely understand each other.

The contrast between the Western world and the more culturally traditional parts of the world is blatant.  Color played a significant role in this aspect.  During the scenes in Agnam (the village in Senegal), we see an overly yellow and dry tone.  As soon as the setting changes to France, the color drastically changes to a heavy green tone and more ""moist"" colors, if I may.  Agnam was geographically portrayed as a dry and boring place - the PEOPLE were the ones who brought color and brightness, especially from their clothing.

Overall, the characters, cinematography, setting, and style of Lili made for a truly moving film with profound cultural references.  I would recommend this movie to anyone wishing to see something that makes them think!",1239148800,,1491,4.947791164658635
