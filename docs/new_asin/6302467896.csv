I bought this by mistake (as others have) and I give it 2 stars just because it is original Seuss.  It put the whole family to sleep!  What a snore ZZZZZZZ.",1009497600,22,276,3.807017543859649

It is just a reading of the book, with the original illustrations, and is much less fun-- the Grinch is meaner, there are none of the hysterical interactions with his poor dog and there's NO MUSIC. What a disappointment.",1008547200,46,378,4.4
468657,5,6302467896,I bought this video at a store (...). Good price and a good little value (...). If YOU seen the the Warner Bros Cartton the Grinch and the NEW Grinch movie then U need all 3 of theres tapes or Dvd's!!!,1006905600,,201,3.926829268292683
468658,4,6302467896,"I did purchace this as a mistake thinking I had the 1966 version by Warner Brothers.  However, I found this very endearing.  It is the entire book with original illustrations as Walter Matthau brings the story to life.  (""Reading Rainbow"" style narration.)  I have enjoyed having THE REAL story via this video and the animated version as a compliment to it.  Please realize this was done in 1957 so the sound and video quality are not high. But do expect the spirit of Dr Seuss to shine through.",976752000,23,495,4.579545454545454

468660,4,6302467896,"No it's not an imposter, just the original version of the book, stills with narration. If you want the real thing make sure to get the 1966 version with Boris Karloff doing the Grinch and narration. I enjoy both  versions very much and have both versions on tape although the Boris  Karloff is by far my favorite. Merry Grinchmas!",945648000,30,330,4.576271186440678
468661,1,6302467896,This is NOT the one! This is more horrible than home video and is so poorly done it should be removed from circulation as it confuses the buyer into thinking it is the cassic animated video.  You will be sorry if you buy  this!  Get the other one.,945043200,54,247,4.104166666666667
468662,1,6302467896,"I ordered this and was very dissapointed to find I had ordered the wrong one. This is a reading of the book by Walter Matthau. This would be a good selection for younger children due to the easy to follow reading and not  too complex images. My son was very entertained, but my wife and I got a  headache...

7826152,5,6302467896,"Thank you Goodwill store where I spotted this in their pile of VHS cassette tapes for $1!
Being a big fan of Walter Matthau, I had wanted to see this for years.
Well, it was worth the wait. Walter voices The Grinch to perfection and his little Cindy Lou Who voice is a treat. This is not animated but rather, it is the still artwork of Dr. Seuss with added minimal motion, such as, when The Grinch speaks, you will see his mouth open once for all of the words, and then close, when he has finished speaking. You will see snow fall and The Grinchs' sleigh flying down the mountainside but for the most part, you are just seeing the still illustrations as Walter narrates. I want to point out that this lack of animation very quickly became a non-issue, as the Matthau narration of Dr. Seuss' poem is so delightful as are the illustrations by the good doctor. Having stolen all of the Who's Christmas gifts and plum pudding and tinsle, Christmas trees and stockings, The Grinch stands atop his mountain and hears, from far below, the sound of joyful singing from the gathered residents of Whoville. And he ponders....and he thinks....and it occurs to The Grinch: ""Maybe Christmas doesn't come from a store. Maybe Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more.""
The video includes a second story-If I Ran The Zoo-which is a delight all by itself. Narrated just great by a young Brett Ambler. Silly and fun! Music for both stories is wonderful as well.",1324771200,,1446,4.586872586872587
7826153,5,6302467896,"If you don't want Jim Carey to be your child's picture of the Grinch, try out Dr. Seuss' own pictures with Walter Matthau's voice narrating. The camera merely shows the still drawings in the original colors, but it comes off as simply  classic. I prefer this version to the modern, expensive Hollywood treatments and you might too.",1292025600,2,331,4.807017543859649
7826154,1,6302467896,"This version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas is NOT the animated version you are looking for. Though it is very nicely narrated by Walter Matthau, the graphics are just the illustrations from the book, ""animated"" in a very minimal fashion. Also, once the Grinch is finished playing, the dvd goes directly into If I Ran the Zoo, which is SO annoying. Go for the real one instead and skip this one which is a total bust.",1230076800,,420,4.467532467532467
7826155,1,6302467896,This placard version--a series of still images--with narration by a single reader is far inferior to the cartoon.,1226707200,,113,5.333333333333333
7826156,5,6302467896,"My little guy received this for Christmas and just adores it.  He already had memorized 80% of the book so when he saw it on TV in motion, he was extatic!  What one views on the screen is *exactly* like what's in this book, so while my son watches it, he has the book in his lap and follows along.  Also, for those with super-young kiddos, this cartoon version is perfect because the grinch isn't scary looking at all.  I've seen one other cartoon version of this story where he looked a bit too odd even for me! :)  Also, for adults, this is a nice blast-from-the-past as well!  :)  All in all, this was a great purchase!",1169078400,3,622,4.220338983050848
7826157,1,6302467896,"What a scam!  I think they HAD to know the the overwhelming majority of people would pick this DVD up in the store, and think it was the original animated Grinch.  Why in the world would I want to buy a DVD of someone reading a book?",1164412800,2,233,3.9361702127659575
7826158,1,6302467896,"I agree with all the folks here saying what a drag this product is.  I bought it on the fly in a brick-and-mortar store to put inside my son's Christmas stocking.  I was expecting the children's classic animated short movie, but was most chagrined to find our family watching a screen scan the pages of the book with an actor reading the lines.  Why would I want this when I can read the book to him myself in person?  I must say this product embodies false advertising - with the result being quite the Christmas spoiler.  What a lame gift - here we were expecting to share a great, fun part of our own childhood holidays and instead got a 30-minute video reading of the book.  I wish I could return it, but can't since it is already opened and viewed!  This is the tale of ""How SONY (the manufacturer) Stole Christmas""!",1136505600,6,821,4.3618421052631575
