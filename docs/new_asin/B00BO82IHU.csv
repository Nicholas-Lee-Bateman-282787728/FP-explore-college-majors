8571905,1,B00BO82IHU,No plot and no story line.  Not very entertaining.  Don't waste your money on this one. Worth spending the money for a actual time at the theater.,1394928000,,146,4.37037037037037
8571906,5,B00BO82IHU,"I'm a big fan of David DeLuise and he is great in this movie. Great plot, fun story. Great family film. Sox is a talking dog who used to belong to Socrates. Hence the name. Bad guys want to kidnap him and find out why he can talk. The rest is just fun and funny.
Terrific film for kids and to watch with them.",1387238400,,309,3.84375
