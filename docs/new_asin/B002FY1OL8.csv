Read the one page insert first. It tells of all the tools you will need before watching the presentation.

The four-harness loom offers many weaving possibilities. After a brief review of how to wind a warp on a warping board, you will learn how to dress (thread) the loom from front to back. Then you will learn how to read any weaving draft (pattern) and weave a simple project that includes plain weave, several twill combinations, rib weave, weaving with 2 colors and an introduction to double weave.

I have several looms and find each has its advantages. I am planning for the more complex computer patterns.

8369583,5,B002FY1OL8,"This was the first DVD on weaving that I purchased.  It has proven to be very helpful.  It has taught me a few tricks that I didn't get when I took the week long class at The Mannings.  Don't get me wrong, the class was worth every penny I spent on it and then some.  I would also recommend getting the DVD by Tom Knisley (The instructor at The Mannings), as it will give you some very valuable tips not given elsewhere.  Do yourself a favor and Google The Mannings, and check out their DVD as well.  But in the meantime, get this DVD.  You won't be sorry at all.",1262995200,4,563,4.0636363636363635
