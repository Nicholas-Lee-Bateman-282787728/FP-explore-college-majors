8247126,5,B0012PIF7W,"Although I love to hike, there are times when I've gone on  trails that were ""new"" to me, only to be disappointed by the scenery, or surprised by the difficulty.
This dvd is just what a hiker that's new to the area, like me, needs.
I've been able to plan and venture on more memorable hikes in the past week and a half than I have in the past 6 months.
A good find at a great price!",1202169600,,382,3.8974358974358974
