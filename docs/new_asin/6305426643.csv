8183795,1,6305426643,I was very upset because I was not expecting a VHS video . I can't watch the tape because I don't have a VHS player,1428278400,,115,3.64
8183796,5,6305426643,If the movie's as good as the delivery service (or as the 1st Mercenary...) it's a winning combination and it seems that this is the oly way I'll ever get to see it. Not too pricey either.,1389484800,,188,4.108108108108108
8183797,5,6305426643,"Fadt shipping. The cover was loose, but still fits fine with the VHS tape. Everything else was great 10 out of 10. I will return again as a happy customer.",1380672000,,155,4.2
8183798,4,6305426643,"Well, Olivier Gruner returns as ""Hawk"", the best mercenary to save a rich woman's husband, Robert Townsend, who actually doesn't need help. It's pretty funny to watch the reaction of ""Hawk"" when he  has to face his ""unhappy victim"" and realize he has been doomed.  Well, Robert Townsend is hilarious and Olivier Gruner is awesome as the  mercenary.",949708800,2,348,4.9655172413793105
