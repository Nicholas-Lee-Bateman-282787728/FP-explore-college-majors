4401101,5,B004LB5FC2,I enjoyed the acting of a cast that became Headliners later in life. Another Good verse Bad Action film from the '70s.,1392768000,,118,4.409090909090909
4401102,2,B004LB5FC2,"This is a B film. Some of my favorite movies are B films but this is not one of them. It degenerates into absurdity about 2/3rds through. However, it does occupies a unique niche in 70's redneck schlock cinema. If you have an appreciation for two fisted blue collar beer soaked action you are in for a treat. This film depicts a time and place in American culture when International Harvester was still making pickup trucks and men with mustaches, boots, bellbottoms, cowboy hats, pearl snap shirts, longhair and trucker caps were the rule and not the exception. And no, I am not talking about the Village People. This is a film with high regard for hardcore macho hijinks. A California boomtown is overrun by uncontrollable oilfield rough necks who work hard and party hard. The city fathers are so concerned they bring in outside help in the form of Kris K. and his Vietnam vet cronies to restore order. But almost immediately this gang of mercenaries gain control of the town and exploit it to their own corrupt and nefarious ends. Jan-Michael Vincent plays the brother of Kris Kristofferson and all around good guy who finds himself pitted against his own brother and his band of murderous thugs who will kill anyone who gets in their way. All the tensions culminate in a longwinded showdown gunfight between the two opposing groups and end in fiery explosions. Kris Kristofferson is in his prime but this is not a prime roll. Yet, he does have a few scenes where he is cool as hell in his own unique iconic swagger. So in conclusion this film is bad but it is good.  This Gene Corman produced low budget number is shot in quickie fashion with flimsy sets and flimsier story development, but K.K. looks great in it and so does Victoria Principal and Burnadette Peters. I think I will break out my copy and watch it again,",1391904000,6,1825,4.615384615384615
4401103,5,B004LB5FC2,"I remember watching this at a dollar theatre on a Sunday afternoon with my friend.  It was so cool we called and told my mom to wait another 2 hrs before coming to get us, so we could watch it again.  It has a great sweaty shoot 'em up and punch 'em up bit of B-movie machismo that Misters Tarantino and Rodriguez WISH they could capture.

I was probably too young then to appreciate Ms. Principal and Ms. Peters, but I will now!",1337040000,12,429,4.144578313253012
8434156,4,B004LB5FC2,"Vigilante Force has a hilarious moment where a character tells another character that they can't have a Vigilante Force on their hands to deal with the corrupt cops in the town. The character turns around played by Jan Michael Vincent says, ""you already do."" It's hilarious. It's delivered with the straightest of faces that Jan Michael can deliver and it's got an endearing Keanu Reeves quality to it.

The movie's basic premise is that Jan Michael lives in a blue collar town that's completely out of control. He goes and get's a guy to come be a deputy and clean up the town. Only,, the guy turns out to be just as evil as the guys he's cleaning up. Hence, they might need a vigilante force.

Everyone in the movie is good. Kristofferson is great as always. He's a likable villain who charms his way into his position to take over the town. Jan Michael is the sort of guy you're surprised didn't play Captain America in the 70s. He looks like a piece of by-gone Americana. The actresses are randomly Bernadette Peters and Victoria Principal. Both of them are young or youngish and look like the sort of girls you could find ruling as queen bees on opposite sides of the track in a small town. The rest of the cast is great characters actors from TV and movies from back then.

It's not a genius movie. It's a trashy action movie that has some bonkers moments like a marching band member with a rocket launcher. It's also only 89 minutes. It's the best way for a movie like this to go. In and out fast. It never outstays it's welcome. It shows up with a good smile and sends you on your way.",1525305600,,1593,4.393220338983051
8434157,3,B004LB5FC2,"I remembered this as a much better flick...but this DVD let me down.  Kinda poor quality, especially image quality lacking.  I know this is a 70's film, and I keep that in mind...and in fact, I liked this in the cinema when I first saw it....but this has to be Kristofferson's worst acting job of his career.  (I typically love to watch him, as well as Jan Michael Vincent...but wooden acting here and lousy direction combined with low film imagery forces me to only give it a 3 star rating.  I like it for the collection value mainly.",1514246400,,535,4.428571428571429
8434158,5,B004LB5FC2,GREAT!,1500854400,,6,6.0
8434159,4,B004LB5FC2,Interesting possibilities but mostly a typical 70s action flick. Great travelog of old movie/tv locations and has the distinction of being one of the last productions to be shot at the old Corriganville Ranch in Simi Valley and the 40 Acres backlot in Culver City. Oil field sequence was shot in Baldwin Hills above Culver City where 1951 Adventures Of Superman was filmed. Climatic battle sequences filmed in all of the aforementioned locations.,1461628800,,446,5.123287671232877
8434160,3,B004LB5FC2,"This movie completely blows. But, it does have what years later will become an all-star cast. I mean, the actors are in the twenties and thirties! Check it out on IMDb and go through the list. It's a cult classic now...",1457395200,,219,4.365853658536586
8434161,5,B004LB5FC2,"Ben Arnold has seen enough! It seems that bar fights, shootings and lawlessness have replaced those small town values he grew up with. Ben is fed up with the out of control oil field workers who have come to his town looking to cash in on the oil boom and he has a plan to restore order to his community. Ben approaches the city council about hiring his brother Aaron, an ex-Vietnam combat vet and his buddies to rid the town of its corruption and restore law and order; it sounds simple but it isnt.

Aaron and his combat buddies are sworn in by the mayor and they begin to clean up the town but the plan soon falls apart. It seems that Aarons new found power has gone to his head and he devises a plan of his own. Aaron and his Vigilante Force begin to take over the town for their own piece of the action. Ben must now find a way to stop his brothers vigilante force and restore law and order to the town. How will it end!

In my opinion the new video and audio transfer from Kino Lorber looks and sounds great. The film runs 89 minutes and its rated PG. The Blu-ray is bare bones in terms of bonus material, you get an audio commentary track and a few rough looking trailers and that's it.

Video Quality 4/5
The print for this new 1.85:1 aspect ratio Blu-ray is in great condition. Either it came to Kino Lorber that way or they cleaned it up because Vigilante Force has never looked better. There were only a few instances of slight speckling that I could see and they didn't affect my viewing experience. The images are crisp and clear for the most part, theres a number of scenes that contain some thick grain. Colors a very good looking especially the outdoor scenes. Shrubbery, plants and blue skies look really good.

Audio quality 3.5/5
The 2.0 DTS-High Definition master audio came thru my sound system very nicely and I really didn't find anything to complain about. The dialogue, sound effects and film score sounded better than I remember hearing on television. I really liked the soundtrack and music score for this film.

8434162,1,B004LB5FC2,"The movie wasn't bad but the so-called Blu-Ray transfer sucks. I sent it back. A ""B"" company put it out. Too bad. I wasn't familiar with the story. Blu-Ray DVDs are supposed to look restored. This has good and bad transfer qualities.",1448582400,,233,4.571428571428571
8434163,3,B004LB5FC2,"They hired themselves a hero But all they got was Trouble! This slick, fast moving and action-packed modern day western delivers a strong dramatic punch. The setting is a small California community that has been turned into a boomtown plagued by violence. Vietnam war hero and ex-trouble maker, Kris Kristofferson (Convoy) is hired to head a vigilante police force he and his tough squad use violent strong-arm methods and soon clean up the town and proceed to take it for themselves. Now, the town s leaders turn to Kristofferson s younger brother, Jan-Michael Vincent (Defiance) to bring an end the vigilante force s reign and terror. naturally Kris Kristofferson gets drunk with power. Kris was never an actor he could barely speak lines. Bernadette Peters...always and forever a nightmare. We get a very young Andrew Stevens and best of all Jan Michael Vincent who also would never have won an award but he always had my attention. the start is non-stop random silly violence. Dumb premise but it is 1976. The background music is awful and grating. No real reason to go and get this unless you want a barely fun bad movie.",1445817600,3,1126,4.839378238341969
