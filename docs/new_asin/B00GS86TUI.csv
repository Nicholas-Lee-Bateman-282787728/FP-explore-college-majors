8626673,3,B00GS86TUI,"Informative show about the history and technology of the classic Brit fighter planethe Spitfire's lesser known, less glamorous warhorse partner. But, oy! Is this an poor looking DVD. One of the worst looking commercial releases I've ever seen.

My guess is that it has been dubbed off a really old VHS tape. And then, to add insult to injury, the producers messed up the aspect ratio. The original was in pan & scan; that is, squarish for an old picture tube TV. They have stretched it wide to fit a modern flatscreen, distorting every shot.

The 3 stars is for the informational aspect. 1 star for the technical quality of the DVD.",1468281600,,632,4.633928571428571
