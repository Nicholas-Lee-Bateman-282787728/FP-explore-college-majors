8108268,3,B000EB5HJO,"In disagreement with another review, I found this useful with acoustic as well as electric.  True, Matt Smith plays an electric for all the demos, but that's not really a problem. If one is even mildly comfortable with their instrument, it is easy to make the adjustment.  And, it is NOT heavy metal orientated, as suggested in the other review. True, it is not country blues or fingerstyle, but it is still all blues.
Issues:
1)Matt does some really nice demo riffs, but  is no tablature or music provided.
2)Some techniques he uses are insufficiently clarified.
3) Although a support pamphlet is promised by visiting the website, I couldn't find the pamphlet.  I put a note into customer service.
4. The audio tracks for the book are provided, but are not downloadable.

I'd give this a 4 star for content, but had to drop it to a three for the support issues.",1198281600,,862,4.644736842105263
8108269,2,B000EB5HJO,"I was excited about this book after reading the publicity but the book disappoints. It has very little about acoustic guitar and concentrates instead on heavy metal stuff. Great book if you're 13 and just starting up a rock band, I suppose, but it has none of the history, culture, personalities or understanding of the genre that other books have.

I'd skip over it.",1195430400,,367,4.734375
