3993154,3,B002USF1TU,"Joel Schumacher helming a direct to DVD horror film?  I was originally intrigued just based on the fact that it seemed like Blood Creek (originally called Town Creek) would be an entertaining train wreck, but instead, the film is a decent enough horror dirge that features some solid acting.  Henry Cavill (The Tudors) stars as a paramedic whose long missing soldier brother (Dominic Purcell of Prison Break) returns and seeks his help in exacting revenge on the family he claims have held him captive.  The brothers soon discover however that there is more going on with this family then what it seems however, dating back to the days of World War II when a Nazi scholar (Michael Fassbender of Inglourious Basterds) unleashed something dangerous, blood thirsty, and immortal.  With disagreements between Schumacher and the film's screenwriter, it's no wonder Blood Creek sat on Lions Gate's shelf for as long as it did.  The script is all over the place and often confusing, while a good amount of the film's CGI effects are pretty bad as well.  Still, the film is capably directed for the most part, and Purcell and Cavill are surprisingly great in the leads.  All in all, Blood Creek isn't quite the train wreck I was expecting, and is worth your time if you have some time to kill.",1267142400,20,1285,4.787330316742081
3993155,3,B002USF1TU,"BLOOD CREEK (aka TOWN CREEK) is pretty much a mess of a movie - in more ways than expected.  But at least this very minor effort by Joel Schumacher continues his tradition of introducing fine lads to the screen in hopes of launching a career (Colin Farrell in TIGERLAND is a typical example).  The story/screenplay by David Kajganich tries very hard to be substantial (Viking runes were left in about eight farms and the Nazi's preoccupation with the occult made them spend years tacking them down - the runes being a means toward immortality if you drink the right blood yada yada yada...), but in the end this is just another of the genre as SAW 1 - 6(?), Seven, Silence of the Lambs, Halloween 1 - 5, etc. If lots of blood and crazy behavior on a farm in dark territory inhabited by ageless creatures under the spell of a crazy guy is what rocks your boat, then welcome aboard.

The redeeming factor in the movie is the presence of Henry Cavill (of the Tudor series fame and fine actor waiting to be used in some choice roles) and Dominic Purcell.  As brothers bent on vengeance they make the most of this plot, giving it as much dignity  as could be expected.  They deserve better material as they are both fine actors and personalities.  So Joel Schumacher can't really be run out of town for this movie - he at least gave the two primary actors the chance for screen time. Only or those who love gore.

3993156,5,B002USF1TU,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It had a great plot and very original story.  It wasn't stupid like a lot of horror films can tend to be.  Most of all, it was a very scary movie.  Highly recommend to fans of the horror genre.",1266883200,2,223,4.0
3993157,4,B002USF1TU,"Blood Creek was much better than I was led to believe,That's why I usually don't take movie advise from people unless they have my love for certain aspects of the genre.
It was fast paced and somewhat original,the gore and effects were good enough to satisfy this hard core slasher lover. It didn't hurt that the two leading men are hot..Dominic Purcell and Henry Cavill both gorgeous and good actors as well. Actually all the acting in the movie was up to par.
If you like slasher and zombie flicks this is right up your alley. These are quite different zombies than I have seen before,they're not afflicted with a virus or anything like that and it's quite entertaining the way they come about. This movie deals with the occult,undead Nazis,feeding on human blood for survival and immortality .I think it's a good entry in this years Horror pool. I will watch it again.",1266105600,6,871,4.662337662337662
3993158,4,B002USF1TU,"This was a great, fast-paced scary movie with an interesting plot.  It's a lot better than a lot of theater releases that I've seen in the past couple of months.  Dominic Purcell plays his role well and so does Henry Cavill as the brother who watches over his nephews.  It had really great special effects and was just overall very well done.  Definitely give it a shot, but I have a feeling this will be one of those very underrated awesome movies.",1265846400,12,449,4.439024390243903
3993159,4,B002USF1TU,"I only rented this because I had a free code to do so, and the pickings were pretty lean. I fully expected some kind of torture-porn dreck (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel-Director-s-Cut/dp/B000UNYK3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel (Director's Cut)</a>) or, at best, a mildly interesting tale of adversity.
Instead, I got an original *horror* movie, in the fullest sense of the word, with an absorbing plot, decent effects, a lot of violence, and fairly poor actors (can't win 'em all, I guess). The story seemed a bit scanter than it could've been -- perhaps some bits went onto the cutting room floor that might've been better left in -- but was satisfying enough. Even more surprising than the quality, I'll admit, was the fact that the movie was actually scary (as well as tense). Recommended.",1265068800,3,856,5.6434108527131785
3993160,1,B002USF1TU,"I consider myself one of the greatest JOEL SCHUMACHER fans alive. I am eagerly waiting for the day I can meet him and talk to him and touch him. (If he'll let me!) I adore him and all his work. Except this one. I bought this movie because it's a Joel Schumacher film and I was hoping for alot of extras featuring the director, but I am disappointed! I am surprised that Joel did such a dark horror film, it's a story where the good guys overcome the nazi's. I learned alot more about Hitler's Third Reich than I knew, and how that madman was capable of destroying so many lives. The movie was beautifully filmed, tastefully done. All the actors played their parts incredibly well. Even the gory scenes were done so well as to not turn me OFF completely. I'm not a horror film fan. It felt like parts of the story were missing. And because Lionsgate is all about promoting THEMSELVES we will never get to see the deleted scenes that would have defined the movie. KUDOS to you Joel Schumacher. You did GOOD. Stick with drama or comedy, tho. And get away from LIONSGATE. It's obvious they even tried to edit YOU out of the film.
BOO on you LIONSGATE for not allowing any extra features and instead putting way too many of your previews in place of a making-of featurette. There's not even a Biography section for the actors! The only thing extra is the director's commentary which is wonderful because I love to hear that wonderful old man talk!",1264723200,4,1442,4.445283018867925
3993161,4,B002USF1TU,"After spending almost an hour at the video store wandering around and not finding anything to rent that looked interesting or that I hadn't already seen I stumbled upon this one. It sounded interesting so I figured I'd take a chance and rent it.

As I put the dvd into the player my expectations were very low and I half expected that I would end up stopping it halfway through and watch something on tv instead. However once the movie started I was immediately intrigued and drawn in. It was actually not half bad, it wouldn't win any Oscars but it was certainly better than a lot of movies I have gone to see in theaters over the years. The story was interesting and original, the acting wasn't too bad, it was well directed and edited with plenty of supernatural horror mixed with fast paced action sequences.

I think this is one of those movies that will appeal to certain people and appeal not at all to certain others. So I can't tell you that you will like this movie and I won't, however if you are like me and you like a little supernatural horror mixed action sequences and zombies, then you might just enjoy this flick. I would recommend renting this movie before you buy, personally however if I had bought this movie without seeing it first I wouldn't have been regretted it. This is one I will add to my dvd collection now.",1264204800,43,1338,4.434959349593496

3993189,4,B002USF1TU,"A creepy premise and wonderful performances make this an unexpectedly good movie. There are blood and guts, but the movie keeps from devolving into gore for gore's sake.

Dominic Purcell and Henry Cavill have decent chemistry as estranged brothers. Cavill is surprisingly convincing as the long-suffering brother who picked up the slack when his older brother left. Purcell does an equally good job as the older brother who has been fighting metaphorical demons long before we meet him. They are believable people reacting naturally to an unbelievable situation involving the supernatural.

The farming family is the only exception to a story otherwise full of compelling characters. The father and his oldest son, for example, are practically set dressing. The mother is a caricature with few lines and less personality. Only the daughter has any depth to her. As for their home - an old farm that happens to be on old Viking land - I can think of few creepier places than a large farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Throw in a Nazi archaeologist with a fetish for old Viking runes, and we have the makings for the kind of good, old-fashioned scary story one would tell around a campfire.

Michael Fassbender makes a convincingly creepy yet charming archaeologist who also happens to be a Nazi. One gets the sense that while he's probably had a bit too much of Himmler's Kool-Aid, he would have worked for anyone hiring German archaeologists in the '30s - not just the Nazis. In other words, he's a baddie because he's lost perspective and is obsessed with what he is studying - not *only* because he works for the Nazis. It is widely known that many of the high-ranking Nazis were also obsessed with the occult and with attaining ancient pagan power, which lends a natural plausibility to the antagonist's introduction and place in this story.

I cannot really think of much else to say about this movie without giving the story away. While I would have liked to see more full-bodied characters in the farming family, I still thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie. I ended up buying it and watching it again a couple of weeks later. I caught hints and foreshadowing during the second viewing that I missed the first time around. Overall, I'd say go for it - watch this one. You may not agree with all of this review, but you probably won't feel as disgusted as I did after watching Hellblazer: Hellworld. ;-)",1482969600,3,2415,4.798076923076923

3993267,4,B002USF1TU,"If possible, I would have given this one a 3 1/2.  I think it is better than three, but not sure of 4 stars.  The acting is good, and the premise is pretty good, but there are some holes in the story line, some of the special effects leave much to be desired, and I think the genre will have a limited appeal.

As I said, the storyline is pretty good (for the Nazi-occult genre) - Nazi official visits an immigrant German farm family in Virginia in the 1930s, where his sinister occult intentions become known.  Without giving too much away, the end result is that the family of four is then held prisoner on their farm and in time (they stop aging) while forced to serve the Nazi monster.  In serving him, over the years they've trapped unsuspecting campers and fishermen for use by the monster.  This is one of the holes in the plot - as pointed out by another reviewer, no one has investigated this farm in the area where all these people have disappeared throughout the years?  Another story hole - no neighbors or anyone the family does business with has noticed this family hasn't aged in 60 years?!  They've lived on the same farm, drive a truck (needing gas) and sell their produce locally, but no one has noticed them?  One of the victims is a character played by Dominic Purcell - he escapes and enlists his younger brother (Henry Cavill) to go back to the farm and stop the horror.  In the process the full story is revealed, battle ensues, etc., etc., etc....

Overall, I thought the acting was good.  Cavill pulls off a decent generic American accent.  There are no superfluous scenes (even the early scenes of Cavill, and between Cavill and Purcell, explains their back story).  Some of the decisions by some of the characters seem far-fetched, but then when it comes to movies, especially Nazi occult movies, sometimes logic has to be suspended.

If there was one aspect that I really had a problem with, it would be the scenes involving fire and the horses.  The special effects were downright amateurish and really took away from the film.",1393459200,,2056,4.561307901907357

3993289,3,B002USF1TU,"For every good Joel Schumacher movie, he's got a handful of truly, mind-bogglingly awful ones. On one hand, ""Lost Boys."" On the other, ""Batman and Robin."" ""Blood Creek"" is perhaps the first Schumacher movie I've yet seen that is just sort of mediocre. The first part is hideously confusing (it took me awhile to figure out who was related to whom), but it's a decent movie for people who like blood, guts and gritty backdrops.

In 1936, a small German farm family was visited by Professor Wirth (Michael Fassbender), an occult investigator for the Nazi regime. He came to West Virginia to investigate an ancient Viking runestone that is build into the foundation of the Wollners' barn.

Fast-forward eighty years. Ever since his older brother Victor vanished during a camping trip, Evan Marshall (Henry Cavill) has had to care for his aged father, sister-in-law and young nephews. Then one night, Victor (Dominic Purcell) reappears, looking like a crazed hermit. After a shower and shave, he immediately drags Evan out to the Hollners' farm, seeking revenge.

It turns out that the Hollners -- who haven't aged in decades -- have been capturing people and extracting their blood, and Victor has been their prisoner for the past few years. But they aren't the real danger. That would be Wirth, who is still alive (sort of), able to control the dead, and seeking human blood for the grotesque magic he gains from the runestone.

""Blood Creek"" is a pretty simple story -- two guys go to get revenge against immortal Germans, only to be trapped in a dusty rural farmhouse by a literally bloodthirsty necromancer who wants to become all-powerful. Okay, it sounds a little less simple when put that way. But most of the horror boils down to a ghoulish-looking Fassbender stalking around the farm, using zombie animals to break into the house.

However, the first third of the movie is a chore to sit through. There's an onslaught of shakycam that nearly made me sick (particularly during the meth bust). And Schumacher doesn't really enlighten us about some of what is going on -- I didn't figure out that the Grizzly Adams guy was Victor until a few scenes after he appeared.

Fortunately, both the camera and script stabilize after the brothers invade the Hollner farm. After night falls, the entire story just becomes a gruesome nightmare of blood, white-eyed zombies and a crumbling farmhouse being battered from every direction. It's not particularly scary, but it's got a satisfying amount of blood'n'gore, and the denouement isn't too unbelievable.

It also has a pretty decent cast -- a pre-fame Henry Cavill and Michael Fassbender, both of whom are giving performances way too good for the movie they're in. Even Dominic Purcell, who normally leaves me indifferent, gives a very powerful performance as a haunted veteran driven almost to madness. Cavill's character is the exact opposite, a compassionate and clever man who is riddled with guilt about his brother's loss.

And Fassbender... well, you can't see him most of the time, due to bloodied bandages and lots of shadow. But he is genuinely scary as a man who was monstrous to begin with, and became a true monster once he got access to magic.

""Blood Creek"" is a resolutely mediocre onslaught of blood, darkness and zombies, but the performances by Purcell, Cavill and Fassbender make it worth watching.",1362960000,,3364,4.939823008849557

It did drag just a bit and the strange part of that was it was dragging when it was in full action. You would have to watch it to understand what I mean. The ""evil"" character gave me a chuckle in one part, but that's me and I don't think was intentional when they were filming.

3993293,1,B002USF1TU,"<strong>Blood Creek</strong> (Joel Schumacher, 2009)

The more of Joel Schumacher's post-<em>Flatliners</em> work I see, the less I am convinced that, short of alien abduction or demonic possession, the same Joel Schumacher who made the Joel Schumacher movies of 1990 and before has not made the Joel Schumacher movies since. And since <em>The Client</em>, Schumacher has been on a pretty steady downward slide, with each film getting worse and worse (no, I will not make an exception for the vastly overrated <em>Tigerland</em>, thanks for asking [viz. review November 2002 ish]). And then, in 2009, came <em>Blood Creek</em>, a film around which tremedous rumor has swirled regarding just how much of the script belongs to credited scriptwriter David Kajganich and how much was rewritten by Schumacher (unfortunately, everything I've found so far is entirely unsubstantiated). One way or the other, this is where Schumacher simply fell off the cliff.

Plot: Victor Marshall (<em>Prison Break</em> cutie Domic Purcell) vanished, seemingly without a trace, two years before the movie opens, while he and his brother Evan (<em>Immortals</em>' Henry Cavill) were on a camping trip. And we could have had a movie about a guy dealing with the loss of his brother, but no: soon after the film starts, Victor turns up, tattered and much the worse for wear, and tells Evan that he has been held captive for the past two years by the Wollners, a local, reclusive family of German farmers. Evan loads up the SUV and away they go to get some answers and shed some blood--but when they get there, they discover that the Wollners are much more than they seem--they are undead thralls to Nazi scientist Richard Wirth (<em>Shame</em>'s Michael Fassbender), sent to the farm in the 1930s to look for a runestone said to be one of a set of nine conveying the secrets of immortality. The family are desperate for release from the monstrous doctor, and so are willing to get out of the way of the brothers' quest for vengeance--though not willing to do much to help.

All of which could probably have made for a good survival horror film, had the script been in any way worthwhile. (Again unsubstantiated, but a post in the IMDB forum for this film was written by someone who claims to have read both drafts, and says that Kajganich's script <em>is</em>.) As it stands, it's... awful. And when I say ""awful"" I mean ""I'll give oyu a call when I come up with one redeeming feature about the film, save that it is not in any way patently offensive, but don't hold your breath."" Over the course of my movie-viewing career, I have turned off, with no intention of finishing, less than a dozen movies. I seriously considered it where <em>Blood Creek</em> was concerned. And, having instead sat through the entire horrific concoction, I'm here to tell you: I wouldn't have missed a damn thing of consequence. (half)",1347235200,2,2890,4.930184804928132
3993294,4,B002USF1TU,"I'm yet another one who was surprised to find this isn't as cheesy as I expected.  Let me first say, there are two loose ends that just nagged the heck out of me through the movie.  First, supposedly these people kept Victor for *two years.*  Yet we never see any indication of where and how they actually kept him.  If they'd kept him in the trailer, he'd be dead of exposure and probably gangrene. In *any* event, he should've been pale and wasted and weak.  The other loose end is why in the world would Wirth have brought bones of his family with him to America, where they would later become his only vulnerability?  That seemed discordant and was never explained.

Aside from those two points that really bugged me, by and large the film kept my interest tightly enough to let me overlook any further logic gaps.  The movie progressed at a quick pace, the acting was actually really great.  Even the minor actors fit well into their characters and gave convincing performances.  The special effects were convincing.  The zombie horse was particularly effective and creepy and not nearly as humorous or schlocky as it sounds.

One thing this movie loses by releasing direct to DVD is that you really need to watch this movie in a dark room.  The film lighting and shading make it much more effective if watched in the dark.  Very simple thing, but amazingly true.  Try it.  It adds a whole 'nother level of atmosphere.

I saw this movie on Netflix and liked it so much that I came straight to Amazon to buy.  This is an interesting, well-done movie that manages some originality and interesting twists.  It's not going to win any Oscars, but then again, I don't generally watch Oscar award-winning films for entertainment.  This is interesting, creepy and entertaining, and if that's what you're looking for, you won't be disappointed.",1347148800,,1840,4.70846394984326

3993296,4,B002USF1TU,"Joel Schumacher has been making movies for a very long time, and while not ever looked upon as a great director, he has made some classics.  He's given us Grisham thrillers(The Client, A Time To Kill), suspense thrillers(8MM, Phonebooth, The Number 23), goofy comedies(Car Wash, The Incredible Shrinking Woman), and single-handedly ruined the Batman franchise(Batman Forever, Batman & Robin).  He's dabbled in many genres, but a straight to video Nazi themed horror film is not something I would have expected from him.  Sure he dabbled a bit in horror with The Lost Boys and Flatliners, but those were kind of pop-horror, especially The Lost Boys.  I'm not saying those films were bad by any means, I love them both.  Blood Creek is a different beast altogether though.
Henry Cavill plays a paramedic who's brother had gone missing two years prior.  One night, his brother, Dominic Purcell, returns and immediately drags Cavill along with him on a search and destroy revenge mission on a small farm up Town(Blood)Creek.  Purcell had been captured and held prisoner on this farm by a family that had taken in a German lodger back in the 30s.  This German, Michael Fassbender, was actually a Nazi carrying out experiments with the occult on orders from Hitler.  You know, that whole Third Reich/occult thing.
Fassbender was one of many Nazis assigned to track down ancient runestones scattered across the country.  They hold the secret to immortality along with blood drinking rituals and other hocus pocus.  As a result, Fassbender has lived all these years, growing more and more powerful.  The family he lived with also has caught the immortality bug, but sometime along the way, they all realized Fassbender's evil plans and have kept him imprisoned on their farm all these years.  The catch is the occasional blood sacrifice victim that's needed to keep Fassbender from being unleashed into the world.  Purcell was one of those blood donors until he got away, and now he's back with his brother, Cavill, to go all out Bronson on the family and Fassbender.
What follows is the standard Night of the Living Dead scenario with Purcell, Cavill, and the immortal family trapped inside the farmhouse(Fassbender cannot enter the house), fighting off Fassbender and his gang of resurrected humans and farm animals.
It's as schlocky as it sounds, and as fun as it sounds too.  Schumacher may be a Hollywood heavy hitter, but this movie is as direct to video as it comes....with a higher budget and better production values than most.  It's fast paced, violent, gory, and best of all it's entertaining.
Yeah, it's not 100% original, there's some crappy CGI, there's some plot holes(why does the immortal family look fine, but Fassbender looks all mummified and gruesome?  That's one of many questions you could ask), but who really cares?  This is a Nazi-themed horror film, and those aren't really known for being great examples of American Film making.
Considering the avalanche of straight to video horror films available, most of which disappoint, Blood Creek manages to rise above many of them and delivers the goods.

3993297,3,B002USF1TU,"Though this could have been cleaner, such as really thinking out the powers and motives of the Big Bad, there are some original and effective set pieces here.  I'm betting the actors, who all have some pretty impressive resumes, were not expecting a straight-to-dvd production, so I expect this started life far better than it ended up.  There's loads for gore fans, a bit to chew on for legend fans, though as I said, this could have been better presented, and eye candy for The Tudors fans.  I've never seen the Tudors, but that boy (Cavill) is so beautiful, it's distracting.

The brothers' relationship is interesting but not quite convincing.  Cavill's character is annoying in his insistence of going against his bro's lead, but I don't believe in their deciding to have a fight in such a life-or-death situation.  Just a little more groundwork detailing Cavill's resentment would have gone a long way.  And the middle gets a bit tedious.

3993299,4,B002USF1TU,"As the years go by, incorporating the Nazis as part of a contemporary story becomes less common, but the supernatural horror thriller Blood Creek (2009) comes up with a new wrinkle that kind of works.  Directed by Joel Schumacher (Batman And Robin, Phone Booth, Flatliners, A Time To Kill, Falling Down), the story has a number of problems, but within the strange reality the film establishes, things hold together pretty well, in what is a tense, well-paced thriller that has more than a few surprises.  Some spoilers follow, so stop here if you must.

The story begins in 1936, when the Nazi hierarchy, influenced by Hitler's belief in the occult and divine destiny, send a professor named Richard Wirth (Michael Fassbender) to a small farm in West Virginia.  Firth is interested in a large carved rune stone that was discovered on the property, owned by the Wollner family.

A mysterious evil is unleashed at that time, and is still alive and well, when the story picks up some seventy years in the future, as military veteran Victor Marshall (Dominic Purcell) disappears while camping, leaving behind a wife and two kids.  After being missing for two years, Victor's brother Evan (Henry Cavill), a paramedic, is shocked when his long lost brother, unexpected shows up at his trailer home.

Victor doesn't tell his brother much, but convinces him to grab some guns and ammo, and head off in a boat for what turns out to be the Wollner farm.  There the brothers and what remains of the Wollner family form a strange alliance, and try to conquer a greater evil.

Moving along at a quick pace, Blood Creek doesn't always present a narrative that is credible, but the actual story that is behind the events quite compelling.  It is a twisted blend of suspense, mythology, the supernatural, torture, and the consumption of human blood.  The strange being that Wirth has become, is tremendously powerful, and is on the verge of becoming unstoppable.  The Marshall brothers have taken refuge inside the Wollner home, and the only thing keeping Wirth from entering the house and killing everyone, are runic symbols painted on the doors and windows.  Wirth however has the power to bring the dead back to life, and he sends re-animated humans and even a horse, to strike where he cannot tread.

Wirth's survival and development, depends on his feeding on the blood of live victims.  Cuts are made on the victim's back, and Wirth sucks the blood from the flesh.  Liese (Emma Booth) the daughter of the farmer Wollner, was his first victim.  Her blood nourished his early development, until her father Otto (Rainer Winkelvoss) found a way to control Wirth, and keep him contained on the farm.  As long as Wirth lives, the Wollner family does not age.  Through the decades, unfortunate victims like Victor and Luke (Shea Wigham), have been taken prisoner by the Wollners, to providing sustenance for the beast.

The acting performances are quite good, really helping to sell the unusual situation.  Michael Fassbender makes a formidable villain, while Dominic Purcell, Henry Cavill, and Shea Wigham also give solid performances.  And as the Wollners, Emma Stone, Rainer Winkelvoss, and Joy McBrinn as Grandmother Wollner, are all very good.

Blood Creek has some big gaps in logic, but manages to mix together several familiar horror themes and spice things up with some creative ideas.  Wirth is a riveting figure, and the film delivers some solid scares, and has a number of well executed and edgy action sequences.  Joel Schumacher does a more than competent job of directing, and provides some interesting insights in his commentary, that helps fill in some of the gaps.  Considering the material, Schumacher's attitude is somewhat flippant, but then horror is perhaps not really his cup of tea.",1317772800,2,3790,4.947867298578199
3993300,3,B002USF1TU,"Though Joel Schumacher has had some high points in his career, much of his work has been very middle-of-the-road. He's not generally much of a stylist. He just works the script. Here he ramps things up a bit on the visual side but the script isn't supporting him.

Here's the scoop. It's 1936. Hitler is on the move. He's got some of his agents combing the world for particular relics with magical powers to help the Nazi cause. Some of his agents hit the States looking for Rune Stones left by the Vikings. One agent comes across one on a farm in Virginia. Jump ahead to now and various people go missing periodically around this farm. One young guy, who thought he lost his brother on a fishing trip two years prior, finds his brother has returned and wants to recruit him to do vengeance on everyone at said farm. Of course it turns out things are more complicated than that.

The whole Nazi/ occult thing has become more prominent over the years. Some people have realized that this was not just some pipe dream imagined by the lunatic fringe. Hollywood has worked it with varying degrees of success. Here it's not played too well. It's just not a very good script. You find out, pretty early on, that this particular Nazi agent has learned a few magical tricks. But it escalates to such an over the top degree that it almost becomes cartoonish. And there is some pretty stupid stuff at hand. For instance: How could this farm stand for some 50 plus years, with runic symbols painted, in a garish red, over all the doors and windows with no one ever trying to investigate? And has no official ever gone to the farm to even inquire about the people that have been disappearing at regular intervals? And the daughter. She seems to know enough where they could have done this Nazi pig in long ago. Little of all this makes sense.

The acting is decent enough. I'm not a great fan of Dominic Purcell. It's not that I don't consider him a good actor. I just don't think he has a very good camera face, but he does do a good job here. And why did Shea Whigham take this gig? His role is nearly nonexistent. The production vales are good. Everything is pro level. It just suffers under bad writing.

It doesn't hurt to watch this movie, but I could have used my time better.",1316044800,,2271,4.425837320574162
3993301,4,B002USF1TU,"Its original UK release had the film known as Town Creek but the name was changed to Blood Creek when it was released in the United States. The film was directed by Joel Schumacher who has quite a few amazing films under his belt (including a personal favorite of mine 8MM) though also quite a few that fell short. While not all of his work falls into horror he does have a few key films set in both horror and suspense and knows how to put a film together. The writing credit falls to David Kajganich who is a little newer having only one screenplay written before it. The quality of his work shows through quite well through this one and he has 3 more movies being written. My only worry is that two of them are remakes of classics and I hope he writes the screenplays for It and Pet Cemetery in a way to do them justice as pissing off the Stephen King fans, with remakes of 2 classic films, will surely hurt his chances for much after that.

Now going into this film I had heard mixed reviews. After seeing the film I ultimately believe it was a bias against Schumacher for a few of his films that were utterly painful to watch. If you can put those thoughts aside while watching the film as I did I believe you'll have a great time. We open with a German family on a farm in the middle of nowhere in the World War 2 era who receive a letter that a scholar is coming to stay on their farm. While the mother is against the idea initially the check they are offered to keep the scholar up swayed any decision against finding out more away and they agreed to do it. His first night there he points out that Germany will soon rule the world and we find out he is on a mission for the Nazi regime to recover ancient artifacts that can provide immortality. Apparently there were multiple artifacts left in the United States when ancient Vikings first found the continent and the Nazi's want them. The scholar that comes to town, Professor Wirth (Michael Fassbender), finds the first relic and ends the introduction apparently cutting the daughter and fading out of scene.

We cut to modern day as the modern day as a man, Evan Marshall (Henry Cavill), is being lectured by his father that his older brother, Victor (Dominic Purcell), has been missing for over two years and blames him for it happening. That night out of the blue the older brother reappears and insists there is no time and they need to go out immediately to have revenge on the family that has kept him captive and tortured him for the past 2 years. While his brother is at first hesitant just happy his brother is back when he sees the scars on his back he agrees to go with him. We see them sneak up on the house where the family is at (which is the same house shown in the introduction) and once we have the family rounded up appear to be seeing the same family from nearly 60 years before -un ravaged by the passage of time. Soon after the Nazi shown in the introduction reappears, infused with power making him stronger than a normal man and quite angry for the situation he is described to be in.

This movie was a true shock on how well it was portrayed. When you combine a lower budget film (even with amazing production value) with a Nazi mastermind who is nearly immortal and went straight to DVD you expect nothing great. When you keep in mind that a large slew of his films haven't been great you will further be worried. Don't be. If it at all sounds like something you may enjoy watching I recommend picking it up immediately as I was truly surprised at how enjoyable and worth watching this film was.",1301788800,2,3580,4.324404761904762

We soon discover he is into the occult and here on a quest for the Third Reich's search for mystical ruins left by their forefathers, the Vikings.  Michael Fassbender is chilling as Herr Wirth.

The missing brother just appears one day and tells his brother to grab guns and follow him without telling anybody not even his wife & young sons.  Okaaaay.  They end up at the Wollner farm to exact revenge.  The kidnapped brother, who was in the military (Iraq War?), was taken by the old man and his son so easily that the other brother had no chance of helping. Really? After being kidnapped, the Wollners dragged him back to their farm, without leaving a trace, as a fresh food source for the bad looking bandaged zombie that is all powerful but needs more human blood to complete the transition over to the other side.  If that happens, he'll become unstoppable.  Gasp!  The Wollners have been frozen in time to help him (?) but their daughter has figured out a way to keep him inside the farm yet out of the house.  Huh? What ensues is a battle against the crazy zombie which sounds better then it really is....

There were so many gaps in this plot (along with the fenced yard that was to contain the zombie) and inconsistent scenes that I could not enjoy this movie.  I do not recommend it.",1273017600,,1714,4.498381877022654
3993310,2,B002USF1TU,"Saw the trailer and thought ""Joel Schumacher"" (Batman and Robin/Batman Forever).  Neat premise and story combining the supernatural, occult, Nordic history and Nazi.  (Okay, then.)  Anyway, bad editing and bad acting made for a confusing story with unfortunate sequel possibilities.  People doing stupid things to advance the story.  To it's credit nice special effects and gore.  Now, I know why it never made it to the big screen.  My personal thanks to the executive who made that decision to spare the general public.  If you've run out of things to watch on a lazy afternoon, this'll do.  But no need to hurry.",1271980800,,615,4.950980392156863
3993311,5,B002USF1TU,Really liked this movie. I love the cast. I bought this movie at first because of my man Domonic Purcell. And found out that is an extra bonus! It has a very interesting story line. I would suggest this movie to any horror fan or if you just love a good movie.,1268524800,2,260,4.019230769230769
3993312,4,B002USF1TU,"Although filmed in Romania, this film is set in Morgan County, WV which is where I have lived for three years which of course sparked my interest.
This is a change of pace for director Joel Schumacher (Phantom of the Opera, Flatliners, Lost Boys)and it's a decent--though often muddled--horror flick.  It has a despicable villain played byn INGLORIOUS BASTERD's Michael Fassbender and gallant heroes embodied by PRISON BREAK's Dominic Purcell and THE TUDORS Henry Cavill.  It has an original plot and a creepy atmosphere and an open-ended climax screaming for a sequel.  Above average horror.",1267920000,9,592,5.2105263157894735

8381508,1,B002USF1TU,"Joel Schumacher can be very hit and miss as a director, and this was definitely a miss! How so many people are giving this movie 5 stars is mind blowing to me. The characters were ill-defined cliches - a younger brother living in the shadow of his war hero older brother, I've never seen characters like that before.
The script was terribly written, the performances wooden ... there is just little, if anything, good to say about this film. it felt like an episode of the X-Files if written by someone who'd never seen the X-Files. One of the worst things about the film was the grown up Liese - she is supposed to be forever 17 but looks more like forever 30 (actress was about 26 at the time of filming and it shows), and her accent kept slipping back into her native Australian. And speaking of accents, this thing was supposed to be taking place in West Virginia, yet nobody had a West Virginia accent.",1514851200,,907,4.437125748502994
