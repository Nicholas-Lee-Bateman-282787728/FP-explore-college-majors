706862,4,6303625738,"It's easy to overlook the societal importance of ""Shakiest"". Most academics consider it a vapid re-make of a ""superior"" Bob Hope film. However my consensus is that Hope's movie simply Overemphasized the comedic aspects of the story and downplayed the sociological importance and mythical underpinnings of it. I don't fault Hope since his comedic talents are such that only his fully grasping of the genre and paradigm in its epistomological sense would allow him the proper frame/reference to ""dim"" his comedic talents enough to let the nuances of the story's deeper meanings emerge. Not so with Don Knotts. His performance is neo-subtle in the sense that he draws attention to the pre-Scorsesian templates of story entwined with yet seperated from, meaning, by overexagerating Hope's performance to a Vonnegutian level.

 Example; his performance as Painless Jesse in the film's opening sequences underscore the relationship of Man the Creator with Man the Destroyer and Man the Dentist. In Barb Rhoades we see an equal but lesser voice representing tenets of Post-modern imperialism as well as Proto-Schwarzeneggerian grandiosity. Yet, it is Knotts, initially passive who redeems himself in the end, triumphing over Rhoades and all she symbolizes as well as echoing the pan-universal theme of the hero transformed by ""plumbing"" his own depths. This is shown particularily in  the mine scene, where we read ""mine"" as ""Subconscious Id"". Simply put, not sense ""The Incredible Mr. Limpett"" has Knotts blended  Transformational Mythology with Wellesian Cinematography and Jerrylewisian slapstick. BRAVO!

706863,5,6303625738,"The Shakiest Gun in the West is yet another classic Don Knotts comedy from the late 1960s.  This time around, Knotts plays a newly certified dentist who decides to spread oral hygiene throughout the wild, wild West; after all, Philadelphia is already covered up with dentists - there are at least seven already plying their trade there.  Jesse Heywood is a little wiry guy, of course, and his courage is just as shaky as his gun-wielding hands, but he manages to make a great big splash out on the frontier.  Right after being bamboozled by a merchant and his Chinese assistant (played by Pat Morita, although I didn't realize it was him until I saw the credits), a fiery little redheaded filly comes to him with a toothache, and before he knows what is happening he's a married man.  He doesn't know that Penelope ""Bad Penny"" Cushings (played by the vivacious Barbara Rhoades) is only marrying him because it's her only way to hitch a ride on the wagon train leaving town, nor does he know that his new beloved is a wanted cattle rustler and thief who agreed to help the government find out who is smuggling guns to the Indians in exchange for a pardon.  Events play out in such a way that Jesse becomes BMOF (that's Big Man on the Frontier), famous for his shooting and Indian-killing skills. That whole wedding night thing doesn't really work out the way he planned, though.

Naturally, our supposed hero has to rise to the challenge and prove himself in the end, and then we learn how the West was really won - dentistry, of course.  I should note the fact that Don Knotts is forced to don women's clothing at one point, and you know that is bound to be funny.  There's also a great scene featuring Heywood drunkenly lamenting his long list of failures in life.  Knotts is joined by some other familiar faces: along with Pat Morita, look for William Christopher (M*A*S*H's Father Mulcahy) in a small role, while Uncle Festus himself (Jackie Coogan) stars as one of the gun-smuggling desperadoes.

The Shakiest Gun in the West isn't my favorite Don Knotts movie, but there is a lot of Barney Fife in this shaky gunfighter, and the film is consistently funny from start to finish.  It is also, needless to say, true family entertainment which can be safely enjoyed by the young as well as the old.  Don Knotts is truly a national treasure.",1101772800,7,2341,4.600961538461538

A Philadelphia man graduates from dentistry and tries to head out to California.  He ends up in the wild west, in Big Spring.
  The idea in this town is how are the Indians getting the guns.  Barbara Rhodes (NBC past serial, Generations) is just a scamp who tries to make the goodies on Don Knotts.  He's on his way west and she intends to go along with him to get there as well.  Even if it means forcing the man to marry her.
  Not the best of Don Knotts films, but might be better than taking a sleeping pill.

707022,3,6303625738,Don Knotts does pretty good in this.  His nuerotic nervousness works well as a dentist who goes West to open up a practice.  He gets married to a woman who is really an outlaw and they get into one mess after another.  With her and her guns usually getting them out of it.  This is a movie that's not bad.

I came on Amazon and just went crazy snatching up all the movies I could think of that I loved as a kid (we were both born in '85). And wouldn't you know it, when they started trickling in through the mail I actaully saw a smile. And when we watched this movie along with the other 'oldies but goodies' that smile stayed there.

708357,4,6303625738,"I just re-watched this forgotten classic the other night with my wife. Don has quite a few Barney Fife moments in this and that is what makes it funny. Don had a character that he did that was classically funny. The little guy who puffs up his chest and tries to be bigger than he really is. He developed it during his Barney Fife run on Andy Griffith. He left that series to make a line of classic films in the late sixties that exploited that character. This movie is one of those. The Ghost and Mr. Chicken is probably the definitive movie. I am most fond of the Reluctant Astronaut. All of them are similar with Vic Mizzy supplying the upbeat, infectious soundtrack. I remember all of these fondly from watching them on Sunday afternoons after church on WKBW channel 7 out of Buffalo NY. I never saw the first 15-20 minutes of any of them!  I wish such films were possible today but we live in a different world now. This kind of corn-fed, slapstick just doesn't work.

Thus, I am a late-comer to the Knotts genre.  To view the big picture, my opinion is that SHAKIEST GUN IN THE WEST is more funny and more organized than some Woody Allen's movies.  Another advantage of Don Knotts' movies, is that they are arguably superior to the movies of Jim Carrey, which I find too be unbearably irritating and annoying.  The period costumes and street scenes in SHAKIEST GUN IN THE WEST are excellent, and are almost on par with the excellent period costumes and street scenes of the excellent TIME MACHINE starring Guy Pearce.

SUMMARY.  Barbara Rhodes is a common hold-up bandit who gets caught by the feds.  In exchange for amnesty, she is given the task of hunting down and capturing a gun-smuggling outfit that sells guns to American Indians.  Rhodes accepts the offer, and successfully tracks down the smugglers.  Don Knotts stumbles into a relationship with Rhodes.  Throughout the plot, it is sometimes the case that Knotts leads the chase against the smugglers, and at other times it is Rhodes who leads the chase.  The film has a surprise ending, but don't worry, I will not give it away here.  At the mid-point of the movie, there is a spoof of THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE, a film which stars Jimmy Stewart and Lee Marvin.

DENTISTRY SCHOOL FINAL EXAM.  The first scene is a final exam room in 1870, in a dentistry school in Philadelphia.  Knotts says, ""We're going to get a look-see of your dental condition, sort of get a lay of the land,"" as he approaches a stubborn patient.  The patient (Miss Stevenson) refuses to open up her mouth for the examination.  Instead, she bites Knotts' hand.  ""Complete closure of the oral cavity,"" proclaims the professor of dentistry, commenting on the stubborn patient.  ""If you don't get that mouth open and the tooth fixed, you don't graduate,"" says the professor. And so, Knotts tricks the patient into opening her mouth by inviting her on a date, the woman smiles and opens her mouth, and Knotts puts his finger in, but it gets bitten again.  The patient slugs Knotts in his face, and his head flings back, in the manner reminiscent of fights in POPEYE cartoons.  The patient grabs Knotts and attacks him with the electric drill, then Knotts knocks her unconscious, fixes her tooth, and passes the final exam.

GRADUATION.  At graduation, Knotts very nervously reads from a stack of cue cards.  ""As we stand at the threshold of graduation . . . (""louder,"" shouts a man in the audience) . . . stepping out into new horizons, north, south, east, and . . . (pauses to switch to the next cue card, because he does not know that ""west"" comes next) . . . west.""  Then, Knotts states that he plans to travel west to open up his dentistry business.  His mother is surprised and saddened.

""Philadelphia is overrun with dentists, there must be seven,"" explains Knotts to his mother.  Knotts, his mother, and another old lady, are sitting on a bench in front of the dental school.  The other old lady is the mom's best friend.  ""If he were mine, I'd know what to do, put him across my knee,"" exclaims the best friend.  ""BUTT OUT, BUTT OUT,"" shouts Knotts to the old lady.  ""I'm family,"" insists the old lady indignantly.  ""YOU'RE NOT FAMILY,"" shouts Knotts.""  ""I'm your aunt,"" insists the old lady.  ""YOU'RE NOT A REAL AUNT, YOUR JUST MY MOM'S BEST FRIEND,"" shouts Knotts.  ""OH YEAH?"" exclaims the old lady.  ""YEAH,"" shouts Knotts.  Then, Knotts and his mother are shown walking along the train platform, looking for car #24.  They are followed by a porter, an old man who is burdened by Knotts' baggage.  Knotts' mother continues to persuade Knotts not to take the train.  Reviving his persona from the ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, where he thinks that he is more important than he really is, Knotts tells his mother, ""Call me doctor.""  The mother continues to persuade Knotts not to travel west, ""But doctor, you've always been a delicate little boy.  You've always had your father's delicate sinuses.  It was your father's delicate sinuses that killed him.  ""HE WAS RUN OVER BY A BEER WAGON,"" replies Knotts, as the two continue to talk along the train platform.  ""He was blowing his nose in the middle of the street,"" explains the mother.  When Knotts boards the train, the porter waits for a tip, holding out his hand.  Knotts asks his mother for a nickel.  The mother reaches deep into her purse for a coin, but first she pulls out a large pistol, to get to the coin.  The porter sees the gun, and he runs off, forgetting about the nickel tip.  Referring to the gun, the mother says, ""It got your uncle safely through the Civil War.  Here, you may need it, wear it in good health.""  Knotts accepts the gun.  Shortly thereafter, a real cowboy boards the train, and briefly twirls his gun, in a friendly display to Knotts.  Knotts does the same, but the gun flips out of his and crashes through the train window.

LIZARD ROLL.  A comic scene in a stage coach involves Knotts, a plump Indian woman, a grizzled pioneer, and another frontiersman.  The woman hands out food bars to the others.  ""Mmmm,"" exclaims Knotts, ""that's good, what is that?""  ""Wannatanka,"" answers the Indian. A moment of silence goes by. ""Lizard roll,"" explains the grizzled pioneer.  At that moment, Knotts becomes nauseated, gets up and sticks his head out the window of the stage coach.

DESERT.  Although the packaging of this disc shows MONUMENT VALLEY, located in Arizona, this is not part of the movie.  But there is one scene in the desert, possibly, DEATH VALLEY.  Still in pursuit of the gun smugglers, Knotts crosses a huge desert.  He is thirsty and spots a muddy pond.  He stoops over to take a drink, but it is a mirage, and the image on the movie screen becomes dry sand.  Continuing to trudge along, Knotts sees another pond, and he stops to take a drink, but it is only a mirage, and the image becomes only dry sand.  Then later, Knotts encounters another muddy pond.  Since he has learned that these are only mirages, he struts right through the pond.  But this one is real, and Knotts finds himself up to his neck, drenched in muddy water.  There are other amusing scenes, including a clever surprise ending, but you can see these yourself!  There are no ""bad words,"" and so parents do not have to worry about this one.  There is one scene that almost verges on being a cheesecake scene, and this will boost the enjoyment level of any fathers in the viewing audience.  In this particular scene, Don Knotts accidently drops his dental instrument between Barbara Rhodes' abundant cleavage.",1358035200,,6914,4.617912900575185

708842,4,6303625738,"Since I am not a fan of the political parody that was `Blazing Saddles' I must admit, I was a little skeptical about another western comedy, but after my wife twisted my arm I sat down to witness, what I expected to be a travesty, `The Shakiest Gun in the West'.

What I got was far from the mess I expected.

`The Shakiest Gun in the West' is actually quite hilarious, and while it is not a smart comedy in the fact that it is not a satire and does not carry any distinct political message (at least not a blatantly as some other comedies) but it is a smart comedy in that it really makes the effort to consistently deliver jokes that actually land, no matter what year your watching it (one of my main irritations with `Blazing Saddles' is that the film hasn't aged well since its political and racial jabs are not really relevant in today's society).

The film follows Jesse W. Heywood; Dr. Jesse W. Heywood; as he commits to traveling out west to help fight the war against oral ignorance.  Yes, Heywood is a dentist.  His plans are somewhat garbled when he meets Penelope Cushings, an outlaw who was captured by the law and given a chance at a pardon; if she can find the people responsible for supplying the Indians with guns.  When the man who was supposed to pose as her husband gets shot she needs an easily manipulated sap to marry her so she can do her job.  That sap turns out to be Heywood.  Oblivious to the obvious, Heywood marries Penelope and they begin the journey out west.

Don Knotts made a string of successful comedies and was known for his comedic talent.  He doesn't disappoint here either.  His portrayal of the nervous and socially retarded Jesse W. Heywood is a joy to watch.  His every awkward move adds more and more laughs to the pot.  Barbara Rhoades is equally as important to the outcome of the film, for she serves as the offset to Knotts, delivering a more serious (yet ultimately comical) performance that is less outlandish, more subtle.  Supporting performances by Donald Barry and Jackie Coogan add to the hilarity (if not the stereotypes).

The film takes a turn for the hilarious as a slew of events make Heywood look like a town hero (when of course Penelope is the real hero) and his head becomes bigger than his britches.

So, while the film is not as good as other comedies, and it surely does not have the following that some lesser worthy comedies have (`Blazing Saddles', `Caddy Shack' ~ don't hate me MKIA) `The Shakiest Gun in the West' is a lot of fun and a load of laughs.  It deserves a following, so consider me the fan club president, and you can all be members.  Just click `helpful' (hehehe) and leave me a comment!",1222214400,5,2673,4.453798767967146
