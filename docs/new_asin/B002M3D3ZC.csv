8373433,5,B002M3D3ZC,"Un Baiser S'il Vous Plat is a charming exploration of desire and attraction. I wouldn't call it a romantic comedy, more a quirky lighthearted drama about relationships. The pace is slow and there is a lot of dialogue, but the film is never boring; on the contrary, the terrific acting makes the chemistry between the characters very believable and compelling. The plot intertwines the changing relationship between a man and his married female friend and other women in his life, and an encounter between strangers. The characters exhibit a lot of tenderness and vulnerability. The classical score adds warmth and charm to the often awkward encounters between the characters.
