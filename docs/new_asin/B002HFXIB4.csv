8530614,1,B002HFXIB4,"BOUGHT THE SET (9 DVDs) TO SAVE TIME & GET A COMPLETE TRAINING IN BEFORE STARTING A DIVORCE CASE.  PAID THEM $35.91 FOR S/H FOR 9 DVDs.  1ST CLASS MAIL FROM THE EAST COAST GETS HERE IN 3 TO 4 DAYS & WEST COAST 2 TO 3 DAYS AT A COST OF EITHER $0.49 OR LESS THAN $1.00 DEPENDING ON THE PACKAGING.  THEY SENT IT ""MEDIA MAIL"" DELAYING ITS ARRIVAL FOR 10 DAYS.  HOW CAN ONE TRUST A PERSON WHO IS TRAINING YOU ABOUT THE ETHICAL PRACTICE OF DIVORCE LAW WHEN THEY USE SUCH BUSINESS PRACTICES--AND KNOW OR SHOULD KNOW WE NEED THE TIMELY DELIVERY OF SUCH LEGAL MATERIALS, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ARE PAYING A PRICE THAT SUGGESTS NOT A DOWN GRADE IN MAIL SERVICE, BUT COULD EASILY COVER THE COSTS TWICE OVER OF AN EXPEDITED DELIVERY?!!

HARD TO NOW WATCH SOMEONE I DON'T RESPECT OR TRUST!!!",1403308800,,774,4.238095238095238
8530615,5,B002HFXIB4,"The settlement conference stage of a litigated case is critical. Most cases settle at this point, so it pays to be prepared, and to have your client prepared.  The suggestions in the seminar are all top notch and very practical. They won't cost my clients a lot of money and if we don't end up settling, the written materials the speaker suggests you prepare can be re-used for the trial. Plus it helps set the client's expectations where they ought to be. The written materials are offered as a free download on the speaker's web site--all 107 pages of them, which was a huge bonus.  Mercer is also the co-author of a well known divorce book, Your Divorce Advisor, so she really knows her stuff.",1256601600,,696,4.56
