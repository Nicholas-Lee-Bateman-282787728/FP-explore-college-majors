When I turn on a different language option the main story is still in English, just a few words here and there are spoken in the different language. I was expecting it to play the same story in a different language. Also, there are long segments with no speaking whatsoever, and the quality is overall lower than I was expecting, even for this low price. I was really looking forward to receiving these, but now I'm glad I only bought two. It seems like a poor quality knock-off of Baby Einstein, which I also don't like. I suppose if people like Baby Einstein-type videos or want their kids to be exposed to just a few isolated words in a foreign language it would be ok.",1409702400,,713,4.368421052631579
