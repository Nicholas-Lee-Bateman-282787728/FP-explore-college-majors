8467279,5,B005DOSFEG,"Review is for the Filmmuseum DVD. Requires a region free DVD player. Played on Seiki SR4KP1 without issue. Quality of the prints is fantastic, no Alpha or Grapevine material here. You can select English or German language from the menu. First half are silent shorts featuring Marion Byron, the second half is PreCode slapstick featuring Thelma Todd and Zasu Pitts and then Thelma Todd with Patsy Kelly. The common theme is Thelma Todd one way or another losing her clothes so that she is just in a nightie (not kidding, it happens in almost every short).  I actually bought this for the Byron silent material, never having been exposed to any of the Todd comedies, boy what a treat. I cant believe I missed out on this genre for so long! Unfortunately it looks as if there aren't many other releases from these comedy teams and they are all on horribly sub par Public Domain discs. This is a cant miss compilation, also check out the Max Davidson Comedies also from the Filmmuseum.",1508716800,,981,4.670520231213873
8467280,5,B005DOSFEG,"Great Hal Roach female comedy team shorts - just hope we get a volume 2 and 3 and 4 ... - this is a PAL disc, so get a multi-region dvd player or just watch it on your computer if you are in the U.S.",1499990400,,199,3.4444444444444446
8467281,5,B005DOSFEG,"Absolutely wonderful collection of silent and early talkie shorts, for the most part starring the beautiful and talented Thelma Todd, along with marvellous partners like Zasu Pitts (yes, it's confirmed at last, when Toddy addresses her several times as ZAY-sue) and Patsy Kelly.  Comedy gold, in my opinion.  Won't play on my Sony blu ray player, but works just fine on an Apple Mac.",1479254400,2,383,4.96875
