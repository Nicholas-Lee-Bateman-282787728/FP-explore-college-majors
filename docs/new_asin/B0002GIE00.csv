8027902,5,B0002GIE00,"This movie is so bad it's good.  I first saw part of it on a religious channel that played ancient movies on it.  It took me a while to find it.  Having the kids as the dwarfs was both creepy and funny.  If you like Snow White, you should add this to your collection.  It's really hokey.",1356393600,,287,3.9649122807017543
8027903,5,B0002GIE00,"WOW!  Brings back so many marvelous memories when I was a child.  I remember seeing these ""Childhood Production""-English-dubbed versions (Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty)advertised on TV and would never miss them when they arrived in my local cinema.  Snow White was also shown on television under the banner of ""Holiday Storybook"" and that is the version that you are getting if you purchase this PR Studios dvd release.  The Paul Tripp narration is gone and instead you get a prolog and epilog featuring then popular TV celebrity Chuck McCann, with bits of his narration where Tripp's used to be.  Bits of the background score are also altered where the Paul Tripp narration used to be but these are no longer than 5-10 seconds.

I see PR also has released Sleeping Beauty.  Now when will Cinderella be available?

8027905,5,B0002GIE00,Was just what I was looking for. I totally got in touch with my childhood. I had missed it so much and it had been very hard to find before Amazon. I am extremely pleased.,1226188800,,171,3.914285714285714
8027906,4,B0002GIE00,"I saw this movie at a theater in Brooklyn when I was about 6 around Christmas time. It's fantastic to see it again after all these years. The image quality is only ok, and it's dubbed into English as this is a German movie; but this is a rare live action version of the famous story. It's close to the original story; in this version the evil queen makes several attempts on Snow White, and of course she has marvelous success with the poison apple. Note to Prince Charming-get a haircut! There is also a nice collection of cartoons on this DVD, Popeye,Woody Woodpecker, Felix the Cat; it's like a day at the matinee!",1217635200,,617,4.421052631578948
8027907,4,B0002GIE00,"This version of SNOW WHITE was originally filmed in Germany as SCHNEEWEISSCHEN UND DIE SIEBEN ZWERGE in 1955, and later dubbed into English by the Childhood Productions company for it's series of popular kiddie matinee features in 1965.

Pretty young Snow White (Elke Arendt) is banished into the forest by her evil stepmother the Queen (Addi Adametz).  Snow White finds a home with seven little men, before the jealous Queen, armed with a poisoned apple, decides to ensure that she remains the fairest in the land...

This version of SNOW WHITE is noteworthy for it's genuine European storybook atmosphere and some great location photography.  Elke Arendt is perfection in the title role and the dwarfs are played (in a very ususual move) by children.  Addi Adametz plays the Queen with flair.

The Childhood Productions' English-dubbings were always well-achieved, and this SNOW WHITE is enlivened by a score from Ann and Milton Delugg, as well as gentle narration from Childhood Productions stalwart Paul Tripp.

Well worth tracking down.",1151280000,,1041,5.197604790419161
8027908,4,B0002GIE00,"When I was a kid, i picked this film up at the five and dime... I always wondered why the words didn't match up with the movemts of the people's lips...

This German version is actually quite charming (and annoying at the same time). It had its good moments (the scenery was BEAUTIFUL) and its bad (This production used children instead of dwarfs, the queen was far from beautiful, and Snow White had a really bad wig with braids)... I enjoyed it when I was young and still do, actually.",1093132800,,487,4.411111111111111
