8724080,5,B011CGROCW,"As all Don Matteo episodes and seasons this is real intelligent funny entertainment. No unnecessary exaggerated and unrealistic violence like in typical american productions which has 500 dead per single episode. Love Terence Hill, Nino Frassica, Flavio Insinna, Milena Miconi, and others. Also the new capitano Simone Montedoro although I miss capitano Anceschi much. One can also learn few things about love and humanity from Don Terrence Hill Matteo.",1456790400,3,453,5.579710144927536
