8569549,5,B00BJC90SG,"This double movie DVD is living proof that no movie is all bad or all good. One reviewer loved ""River of Death"" and hated the Brenda Starr"" film. Another reviewer loved the Brenda Starr flick and hated the ""River of Death film. So it goes to show you, you can't go by anybody's particular taste. That's why I don't pay too much attention to people's opinion on movies. Including the professional critics.",1425427200,,404,4.625

8569551,5,B00BJC90SG,"River of Death is one of my favorite Alistair MacLean adaptations.  I found the concept very interesting as a guide and his two clients are jumped by South American headhunters with uniformed Nazis as back-up.  He becomes separated from them and gets back to civilization.  With help, he returns to track down the missing professor and his daughter and the source of a disease that is ravaging the Amazon.  One of the allies is L.Q. Jones being a weasel and the ever-popular Donald Pleasance, revealed in the opening scenes as an ex-Nazi with his own agenda in hunting down the bad guys, led by ex-Nazi scientist Robert Vaughn at his most reptilian.  It's a dangerous odyssey through jungle and along the Amazon that turns even worse at the end of the trail.  Love to see Nazis get killed off.  Based on one of MacLean's popular novels.  Other adaptations included Where Eagles Dare and Ice Station Zebra.  Never watched Brenda Starr and it looks nuts...desperate guy loses Brenda in her own comic strip and goes into the comic strip to help. I sat through 15-20 long minutes.  River of Death gets the five stars, Brenda Starr gets zero.",1394841600,,1137,4.725888324873097
8569552,4,B00BJC90SG,"It's really nice to have River of Death on DVD. It's one of Micheal Dudikoff's 80's era Cannon films. Like a lot of people who grew up in the 80s, I'm a big fan of both Dudikoff and Cannon. While River of Death isn't a great film, it has that unmistakeable Cannon charm. Not only that, it has an extremely interesting cast, interesting plot twists, great score, great cinematography, and eye-grabbing scenery. It's a real treat for fans of 80's Action/Adventure cinema. I'm glad to see it on DVD. Now if we can just get Platoon Leader and Avenging Force on DVD.",1383782400,2,561,4.509803921568627
8569553,2,B00BJC90SG,I thought Timothy Dolton would do a better movie than this . This movie was a bit corny. The story line was not that great. I am a bit disappointed because I think Timothy Dolton is a great actor in his other movies.,1374192000,,216,4.046511627906977
