3993082,2,B002URCIXS,Kind of a weird movie. A little confusing at times. I never understood the relationship between the two drifters or the old man that they seemed to live with yet they treated him horribly. There was no justification for their bad treatment of anyone other than a lame explanation from one of the drifters who said his family moved away while he was at school.  I have read a number of stores written by Bram Stoker and I've never read this particular one. I have a hard time relating this story to him whatsoever.  Overall I gave this movie 2 stars but I'm not sure it even ranks that high. If you have nothing better to do then watch it and see what you think.,1473033600,2,661,4.28
3993083,1,B002URCIXS,"Seriously! I thought this was supposed to be good from the reviews. Its Horrible! The acting sucks, The soundtrack is repeats from other movies! Try some thing else!",1472860800,,165,4.928571428571429
3993084,5,B002URCIXS,"Surprising good movie.  Movie looks like low budget, but watch it long enough and it is a sinister tale. Married woman is a trip and does some fantastic acting. Very realistic. Not sure why I haven't seen her in many movies. Anyway, all the acting was done very well. it's worth a watch.",1472860800,,287,4.415094339622642
3993085,4,B002URCIXS,"If you're a fan of literally any show on the Investigation Discovery channel, this is going to be a familiar plot. It was ok. My mom watches ID 24/7 (it's basically white noise at her house), so the film was predictable and not shocking to me in the least, but, I'm always a fan of threesomes where the ratio of men to women is greater than 1, so there's that. I give it a solid ""meh.""",1472688000,,385,4.078947368421052
3993086,5,B002URCIXS,"WOW!  I decided to watch it based on previous reviews.  Was NOT in the mood for gory stuff, just a good intense story.. so I started watching and then I saw it was written by Bram Stoker, interest grew even more.  Had no idea what to expect.  It was amazing, did not move from my spot, and really got drawn into it.  I believe I'll save this on my list for a watch again time.",1472428800,,376,3.96
3993087,4,B002URCIXS,"The story wasn't like anything I've ever seen before.well written, good acting intense plot. I won't get into the storyline and give everything away . Because I want you to watch this film so you can see how it leaves you feeling . My own feeling is that the ending was very ironic . If you can get past the frenzy of activity I think you'll enjoy the movie for the movie itself .",1472256000,,380,4.148648648648648

3993089,5,B002URCIXS,"At first glance THE DOUBLE BORN has the appearance of a low-budget, student character-study film, but it quickly evolves into something much more engrossing & inexplicably suspenseful--and frightening. Superficially the movie is about a married woman named Sophonisba living with her husband and younger sister in the country. She has lost a child and becomes increasingly obsessed with having another baby. We learn that she has secretly sent sperm samples (!) to a lab & is informed that her husband is no longer a candidate for paternity.

She begins a frantic alcohol & bar driven quest to find a donor--any donor. Her sister becomes increasingly aware of her sister's dangerous behavior & confronts her on it. We're not exactly sure what, but the two sisters share a secret or covert background. The lady meets up with 2 young drifters (who are up to no good) whom she immediately targets for paternity. She reasons (if you can call it that) with 2 young lovers in the same night you can't go wrong...well, Sophonisba might have something there.

In order to draw the drifters in, she gets them involved with a Ouija board & other borderline occult-like activities--as well as drugs & sex. One the boys looks like a Calvin Klein underwear model. Gradually the cruel intentions of the young men becomes manifest, along with Sophonisba's increasing instability. What plays out is a macarbre & excitingly different kind of horror & suspense film.

DOUBLE BORN is based on a story by Bram Stocker. I've only read his DRACULA (several times) & can't comment on that connection.

The script & direction is top notch, but what really holds it all together is Sammi Davis' realistic & intense performance. The only other film of her's I've seen before is A PACK OF LIES with Ellen Burstyn & Terri Garr. She was a teenager then & I was very impressed with her natural style. (Incidentally, A PACK OF LIES is another excellent production with a lot to convey.)

8381476,3,B002URCIXS,"Yes this is based on a short story by Bram Stoker.  You can buy the kindle version here on amazon.  The Dualitists; or, the Death Doom of the Double Born  Kindle Edition.  Film adaptation is very Freudian and icky ewwy creepy, as was the film version of Lair of the White Worm.  But while Lair of the White Worm had some humor and higher budget directing, acting, filming, this was very very low budget",1473552000,,402,4.378378378378378
8381477,1,B002URCIXS,"Poor film quality, bad acting.  This movie must be geared towards those dropouts that like ""South Park"".  Too much nudity and violence.  I made it less than 10 minutes in.  Fail.",1473552000,,178,4.645161290322581
