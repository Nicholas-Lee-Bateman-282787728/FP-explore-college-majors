The first time I saw it I thought it had a lot of problems; and it does, but it also has several things going for it.  The special effects and  scenery are very well done for the time.  The film also really tries to  show what tribes and cultures may have been like.  There is also an attempt  to create a tribal language which may seem silly at first, but when one  watchs the film a few times you can begin to see a continuity to what the  film makers tried to do.  This film is definitely worth taping or buying  because you will want to watch it over and over.",943574400,10,636,4.0894308943089435

424501,5,6302101735,"This is one of the few times it doesnt pay to be a blonde.  As the film opens three blondes are about to be sacrificed to the sun god.  One is lucky enough to escape by way of the sea, rescued by some fishermen.  Unfortunately, the beach dwellers also worship the sun god and are affiliated with the mountain dwelling blonde killers who want their footloose blonde back.  Apparently this is a big deal because they spend most of the movie trying to get her back so they can kill her and her boyfriend Tara, who they will keep trying to sacrifice, to no avail (the guy just won't burn).

The best part of this movie is the infrequent dinosaurs who cause a requisite amount of mayhem.  But considering the title, they should have been featured a lot more than they were.  Basically, this is a cave-boy meets cave-girl plot.  And yes, boy loses girl several times.  But thats okay; he has a spare one at the beach.",1496275200,,911,4.375

Obviously this isn't Tarkovsky level cinema, or even Spielberg, but it's a lot of fun, better than the more famous ""One Million Years B.C"": with better special effects and performances (and an attractive cast in skimpy fur outfits), and a story that just zips along.

424668,5,6302101735,"First & foremost I would like you all to Know my review is about the D.V.D. "" When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth 1970"" as sold by Amazon.com.  I do not see where it benefits any potential buyer to write a review based on any version other than what is being represented & sold by Amazon.com. E.I. Korean, German, Chinese or any other product  other than the one advertised by amazon.com! The D.V.D. I purchased from Amazon.com has a beautiful picture & sound quality.  Both the case & disc are of the finest quality material & have wonderful art work on them.  As far as the film itself you might want to watch it first before sitting down with your grandchildren to bond over sharing this old gem with them as this is the unrated version of the film and may show a bit more nudity than you remember from your youth.  While I am no prude I would rather you be aware that this version does have nudity in a sexual context.  If you are purchasing this film chances are you have seen it before & it is endearing to you from years ago.  If this film is new to you & your picking it up because you love all things Dinosaur related I'm pretty sure you will enjoy it.  You may find the over use of the apparently generic words "" Akita"" & "" Neecro"" a tad bit annoying once you get past that this is a wonderful little slice of escapist fantasy containing stop motion animation special effects approaching the quality of the master of that craft Ray Harryhausen.  I don't like to go into great detail about movies so I don't give away spoilers or raise expectations.  Since there is really no "" real"" dialogue going on they made this film visually explanatory.  I am very happy to finally be able to add this film to my movie library, as for many years it was only available at outrageous prices or only offered on region 2 format's not playable on most players in the U.S. or Canada.

Now in some scenes there is a little jitter in the picture only the professional eye will pick that up like die hard film collectors.
In the SPFX scenes the color looks muted [pale] some scenes look faded
The egg scene, when the big DINO finds her in the egg shell .the long shots has a slight wave to the bottom part of the image.
There is no thumb nails picture frame GO TO scene menu style.
YES IT IS UNCUT real sexy and real 70s.
The night scenes look fantastic [ vivid color ]
The trailer looks good [anamorphic]
warner bros is LAZY
they use all the OLD video masters from 15 years and put a 1080 filter on the image and soup up the focus. who are they kidding
that's why the print still has a slight jitter. it is the same 35mm PRINT master.
like the Warners HAMMER  Draculas ,Frankenstein and Mummy.
if this was a remastered edition you would get a rock steady picture with a boom sound and great color correction in timing. like studio canal did for ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. that kino use and zoomed in for the u.s.a. release.  who are they kidding.
the  blu ray it is 70% better of the same  35mm print  then the standard dvd.
they are going to pulled this title you know how warner works, it's about the bottom line
the money. making fast cash. think about it ... warner push the  blu ray format out years ago, if warner was for the HAMMER fans, the film would of bin a new remastered  scan with all the bells out a long time ago.this film came out because of new KONG and ONE MILLION YEARS B.C.

And this is off the record : the so-call dvd / blu ray collectors , you know the ones that you see on youtube with 2000- 3000 blu rays and dvds behind them while they talk about BORING lame 1990s - 2017 sci fi / horror films that ALL the NO TALENT scrips are each worth $2.00.  they can not watch in a life time. the so-call collectors know nothing about the history on DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH ,first it came on vhs tape u.s.a. cut ,then laser disc u.s.a. cut. then for best buy stores only a  fluke happen. it was release the UNCUT euro version on DVD double feature with Moon Zero Two .HAMMER fans went heywire buying  most of all the DVDs .warner pulled the remaining DVDs could not find any dvd at best buy stores, then people were selling them on line up to $200.00 . so BEFORE anybody wants to knock the Film, like the so-call new blu ray collectors, know the history on the Well Made Film with heart . not like the cookie cutter SAME rehash stories garbage sci fi / horror so-call movies of today.

OVER-ALL GET IT you will enjoy this classic DINO masterpiece film of the fun fill free times of the 1970s
it is a top seller on AMAZON.COM",1488672000,4,2724,4.187380497131931
424749,2,6302101735,"This review is for the blu-ray version of 'When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth' released by Warner Archive in February, 2017.

If you own the previous release of this movie there aren't a whole lot of reasons to upgrade other than you have to have the best possible version of this movie.

This is a truly bad movie but it does have some decent special effects. For more on this....read the plot/summary.

BLU-RAY: The picture is decent enough. The imperfections have pretty much been removed and it's a clean print. It's not extraordinary but it's good enough.

EXTRA'S: Here is where this release fails. If you are going to pay $22.00 for this movie you should probably get something more than just the movie and trailer. There are subtitles if you count that as an extra. However, this is only moderately helpful as there is no real language spoken. I felt like I was seeing the same words over and over again. ""Akita"" has been drilled into my brain and I hope never to hear that 'word' again.

PLOT/SUMMARY: I don't like to go into such depth normally but I felt like I just had to with this one. There is just so much wrong with this movie.

We are told by the narrator that this movie takes place before the moon existed. Huh!?!..come again!?!...we have cave men but no moon? You know you are in trouble with this one immediately.
Sanna (Victoria Vetri) is about to be sacrificed along with two other girls to the cave men Sun god.
Right away we learn a few interesting things about this tribe. First of all, they have developed lipstick, as Sanna very noticeably is wearing it. Also we found out these cave men have learned African tribal dances and even have painted skeletons on their bodies.
Sanna gets away over the cliff and is rescued by Tara in a raft. Tara takes her to his tribe. Tara we find right away has a thing for blondes. He immediately dumps Ayak (A much hotter Imogen Hassell) because she is a brunette and we all know who has more fun. Tara spends the rest of the movie chasing after Sanna and basically kissing her butt.
At camp, a sea dinosaur, Elasmosaurus has been captured. He breaks free but instead of heading back to the water he decides to stick around and becomes dinner.
Sanna's tribe shows up looking for her and Sanna hightails it out of there. The chase is on.
Another poorly executed scene takes place between a Triceratops (I think) and cave men. The dinosaur hurts one and kills another. However the dead man just can't seem to stay put. He moves around the screen and even disappears in following scenes (Obviously very poor continuity). The dinosaur proves to be as dumb as legend has it (supposedly brains the size of a walnut) and charges off a cliff to it's death.
During this scene vultures go on the attack even though one of the cave men is not dead but just injured.
Meanwhile Sanna is adopted by a large dinosaur (it looks similar to 'The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms) after she falls asleep in a giant eggshell. Sanna makes friends with a newly hatched dinosaur but that baby dino just disappears right after this scene. I guess he was written out of the movie at the point (maybe it was making unrealistic demands?) Sanna somehow tames the mother dinosaur and it becomes here ally.
The rest of the movie is just an exercise in trying to get Sanna so they can sacrifice her. Tara spends the rest of the movie chasing after her. Tara also gets captured and given a viking funeral even though he is not yet dead. A sea dinosaur not far out attacks Tara's raft. Despite this danger...nobody else ever seems to worry about it while out rafting. Tara, unbeknownst to the tribes, gets away. Once again, he is able to get back with his blonde bombshell.
I don't like to end the plot/summary by giving away the end of the movie but I fell like I just have to. It's so horrible that I just can't not comment.
So Spoiler Alert!!!
....and...no...it does not end with a volcano erupting and destroying the fledgling civilization!!!
Instead.....the moon is born!?!?!
We immediately get the world's first lunar eclipse which takes all of about 10 seconds to complete.
Immediately there are massive tidal wives....so what do our heroes do in the face of such danger?
Nope...you didn't guess it.....
Instead of heading inland....they....I'm not kidding....they get in a raft and head out to sea!!!
Ayak ignominiously perishes by falling into quicksand while running. Hey....they couldn't come up with a better idea to 'off' her. We can't have competition for Tara(by the way...Tara is a guys name) now can we.
Our raft fights off hundred foot tidal waves and comes to rest with our heroes unharmed on....wait for it.....a mountaintop?

PRODUCTION: 'When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth' was filmed in the Canary islands and Shepperton studio's in England. It's pretty obvious which scenes are in the studio.
The movie stars, an extremely distracting, Victoria Vetri, 1968 Playboy Playmate of the Year. I know the idea was to have 'hot' cave girls running around but really, that should  not be the plot of the movie.
The movie was directed by the great sci-fi director Val Guest. I found this to be almost unbelievable. The movie seemed so poorly directed at times that I thought this must be a mistake. I'm not sure what happened here. From reading the entry on this movie in Wikipedia I found out that Guest felt that Victoria Vetri was a 'nitwit.' Perhaps he just wasn't 'into it.' Perhaps he couldn't do anything with the script. In any event, even with a poor script, the scenes seemed poorly directed and at times poorly edited.
The dinosauars are mostly stop action. This is done respectfully well in some places, not so great in others. There is a scene with lizards with paste on fins too!

THOUGHTS: To me, this movie was very disappointing. It was no where near as good as Hammer Films' 'One Million Years B.C.' That's not saying a whole lot.
I like pretty blondes and all but the scenes with Victoria Vetri running around were just ridiculous. The focus of a large part of the movie seems to be watching her breasts bouncing around and most of the tension comes from waiting to see if her nipples are going to slip free of her bikini top which is way to small. The aforementioned happens several times (yes...I noticed!!!). In addition there a few topless scenes.
The plot was amazingly bad...what there is of it.
The scenes poorly transition from the Canary Islands to Shepperton studio's. It's obvious not only because of the background. The scenes in the studio appear to take place in a lush jungle whereas the scenes in the Canary Islands are in the desert. This is poorly matched up as you see a character walk from the desert to a closeup in a the jungle.
There are so many plot holes and errors that it really not worth mentioning but nevertheless I do in this review. Ray Harryhausen commented about One Million Years B.C. stating, that of course there were no dinosaurs in the time of the cavemen but you have to overlook that for a chance at a fun movie.
Sanna incredibly manages to almost get eaten by a carnivorous plant. Poor Val Guest. I can only imagine him trying to direct Vetri. Her acting here is so bad that it appears that she is trying her hardest to get inside the plant to be eaten!
As in One Million Years B.C., the dinosaurs take a back seat to the main plot. They are there for show but don't add much to an almost non-existant plot.
After awhile I figured out some of the words but others I never did. I feel like many of them had multiple meanings and that not a lot of effort was given into creating the language. It seemed like there were no more than 1 or 2 dozen words spoken.

CONCLUSIONS: This release is a poor value at $22.00. They could have either combined this with another movie or given more extra's.
I give it 4 stars for the print. 1 star for the plot. 1 1/2 stars for the extra's. Overall - 2 stars

This is one of the great Hammer Studio's lesser efforts. I feel like they hit their peek in 1966 and the decline started after 1968 (though they still made some good movies up until the end.)
Without looking it up, I believe Hammer made about 4 prehistoric themed movies....One Million Years B.C., Prehistoric Women, Creatures that Time Forgot are the others off the top of my head.

Watch this one at your peril. Don't say I didn't warn you.

Recommended only for completists, dinosaur movie fans and those who have to have the best version of every sci-fi movie.",1488412800,4,8446,4.563324538258575
424750,4,6302101735,"While not the first direct follow up to One Million Years B.C. - that would be Prehistoric Women, which was in the works before the Raquel Welch classic was even finished shooting - Hammer Films' When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth (1970) is the studio's only other attempt to incorporate stop motion special effects in one of its ""Lost World"" adventures, this time shepherded by Jim Danforth instead of Ray Harryhausen, who was otherwise engaged.  The result is certainly impressive on a technical level (Danforth's work was nominated for an Oscar) but fairly insipid when it comes to everything else.

Former Playmate of the Year Victoria Vetri takes over as the resident prehistoric hottie, Sanna, who escapes ritual sacrifice by her native tribe and washes ashore into the arms of Tara (Robin Hawdon), part of a much more progressive clan of hunter-gatherers.  But Sanna's sanctuary is cut short thanks to a jealous cavegirl and the dogged pursuit of her sun-god worshipping homies.  Now on the run, with the smitten Tara intermittently crossing her path, Sanna becomes friendly with some of the local oversized lizards...the only advantage that might give her a fighting chance at survival.

Directed by Val Guest in the Canary Islands, but leaning heavily on studio sets, When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth feels smaller than One Million Years B.C. in almost every way, especially when it comes to the costumes worn by Vetri and the female cast.  Clothed in leather half-bras that would make a Victoria's Secret model blush, the anticipation of a ""nip-slip"" is prevalent throughout.  But, thanks to Hammer's new pro-boobs policy, Vetri disrobes before too long anyway in this international cut, which had been previously released as PG on an out-of-print DVD.

The story, credited to renowned sci-fi author J.G. Ballard, kicks off with an interesting series of solar events which (spoiler alert) result in the creation of Earth's Moon.  But Guest fills in the rest of the blanks with more tiresome prehistoric politics and, unfortunately, more made-up dialogue (don't be surprised if you start using the word ""Akita"" in everyday conversation).  The trials and tribulations of Sanna, clothed or unclothed, just aren't fresh enough to hold one's interest for long.

Thankfully, Danforth's effects inspire just the opposite reaction.  Every bit as magical as Harryhausen's creations, Danforth goes even further, using some moody lighting effects (the opening Elasmosaurs scene takes place under moonlight and a Chasmosaurus attack is staged during a picturesque sunset) to make his models look even more photorealistic.  There might not be as many showstopping scenes as One Million Years B.C., but what's here is easily worth the price of admission.

Warner Archives' new Blu-ray replaces the aforementioned DVD double-feature which paired the movie up with the terminally slow-paced Moon Zero Two.  And what an upgrade it is!  While not billed as a full-on restoration, When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth offers up details as sharp as a pin and a superb color palette.  Extras, however, are limited to the original theatrical trailer.",1486857600,3,3126,5.232464929859719
424751,4,6302101735,"Wow, it's been over 40 years since I first saw this film in the theatre.  And it's still just as entertaining as when I saw it as a kid.  It's still hokey in parts, but the effects, for the time, actually hold up rather well.  The story is your basic ""two members of the opposite sex seeking one another"" stuff, but then again that's what most movies are about anyway, so big deal.

There's the obvious scientific fauspaux of dinos-and-humans living at the same time, but, well ... it's a movie, and not a paleontological documentary.  It still has some of the usual cinematic shortcomings, but as far as the genre goes, it's actually a decent flick.

My only real criticism is that there aren't that many dinosaurs in this thing to begin with, which is a real let down.  There's some nudity, some sex (odd for a film aimed at kids), not really the kind of thing you'd expect in a film with dinosaurs, but the film is what it is, so take that for what it's worth.

It's one of the first films I ever saw, and having a good working knowledge of dinosaurs at the time, I both accepted and shrugged my shoulders at the whole thing.  As a young viewer I truly did wonder why no one made an actual film about dinosaurs (which has now been done a few times, ""Dino King"" being one), but I would have to wait 45+ years for some film maker to realize that for a now contemporary audience.

See it once.  See what you think of it.  I'm not sure it's a film I'd recommend for a conservative family, but it's otherwise harmless.",1486598400,8,1516,4.299295774647887
424752,5,6302101735,"There had been a visual special effects ""fraternity"" for many decades--beginning probably around the era of Willis O'Brien who was responsible for KING KONG. The visual effects world for a long time comprised building models, stop-motion animation, matte painting, rear screen projection, traveling mattes, and the art of blending all these elements together to make the impossible happen before your eyes. Ray Harryhausen took the baton from ""O'Bie"" and created more than a dozen fantasy movies over thirty years--during the course of which he created and animated many dinosaurs. Naturally, there was a dedicated group of fans who emulated their heroes, O'Bie and Harryhausen. People like Dennis Muren, Phil Tippet, Jim Danforth, David Allen, Jim Aupperle, and many more, made their own special effects movies. It wouldn't be wrong to say that their admiration for Harryhausen was immense. One of Harryhausen's dinosaur films was ONE MILLION YEARS BC, which he made for Hammer Films in the 60s. All the special effects community simply loved the dinosaurs in that movie (and also in the subsequent THE VALLEY OF GWANGI). Some thought that Harryhausen had ""perfected"" movie dinosaurs. ONE MILLION YEARS BC made a lot of money and Hammer wanted to do a similar movie. Harryhausen wasn't available at that point in time, so Hammer hired Jim Danforth to animate the dinosaurs and do some other visual effects work. Well, the fact of the matter is that Danforth's dinosaurs in WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH were better than Harryhausen's--smoother animation, more character development, more evocative angles, better and more creative interaction with people. (He and his team did so well in fact that they were nominated for an Oscar.) That was in 1969, and the effects community held Danforth's dinosaurs in the highest esteem. Nobody had ever done it better, not even the sainted Harryhausen. For 24 years, WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH held the crown in this very, very narrow field. Then in 1993 along came JURASSIC PARK with its combination of ""practical"" and digital dinos. It was a whole new ball game, and the effects masters at ILM did a wonderful thing. They did something to honor and symbolize the transition. As you know, the lobby of Hammond's administration building contained a T-Rex skeleton, much as you would find in a museum with a great banner hung above it: WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH. At the end of JURASSIC PARK, the live T- Rex roared and crashed into the building, smashed the skeleton, and that banner went fluttering to the ground. The accomplishment of WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH had been surpassed! What I'm trying to say is that this is an historical movie in terms of film stop-motion animation. Believe me, it's NOT just some dopey dinosaur movie! It's a true classic. I'm very happy it finally has come to Blu-ray. The LONG WAIT is over. BTW, Jim Danforth's biography is titled DINOSAURS, DRAGONS & DRAMA: THE ODYSSEY OF A TRICKFILMMAKER, and it provides serious insight into the making of WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH, as well as 7 FACES OF DR.

424754,2,6302101735,"Released in 1970 and directed by Val Guest, ""When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth"" is a prehistoric adventure/fantasy starring Victoria Vetri as a blond cavebabe who survives her tribe's sacrificial ritual to their sun god. She then tries to join another tribe where she attracts the attention of one of the dudes (Robin Hawdon) and the jealousy of one of the brunette babes (Imogen Hassall).

Wow, this flick is painfully bad. I was seriously tempted to fast-forward through the second half. This was surprising because it's basically the follow-up to Hammer's most successful film, 1966's ""One Million Years BC."" Unfortnately, it's nowhere the same quality. Things go wrong right away when the camera switches from excellent Canary Island locations to an obvious indoor set when it focuses on close-ups of the tribe on top of a hill. Worse, the story is dull and there's WAY too much cave-babbling, e.g. ""Akita, AKITA!"" The stop-motion F/X work is good, but there isn't as much as in the former film, like the great T-rex versus triceratops and the allosaurus sequences. While I like the friendly baby dino and Hassall is significantly hotter than the overrated Vetri, neither makes up for the movie's mortal flaws.

The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in the Canary Islands and England (sets).

I still enjoyed it, but there was too much Caveman Action, and not enough dinosaurs for me. But the Dinosaur Action was great, due to excellent stop motion animation by Jim Danforth. The plot deals with how one group of cavemen had planned to sacrifice three blonde women to appease the Sun, but one of them, Sanna (Victoria Vetri) escapes, so they pursue her. She is rescued by a caveman from another tribe named Tara (Robin Hawdon), and before you know it, both tribes are after both of them. Victoria Vetri, Imogen Hassall, and Magda Konopka are all very beautiful, and this movie has a high BBQ (Bouncing Boobies Quotient), despite being rated G in America. Also, I bought a Korean, All Regions DVD from Amazon, and it is definitely the uncensored version, since it has bare boobies (including Victoria's), so keep that in mind if you want to buy it.

424930,5,6302101735,"I just finished this movie, it's rewound, so lets get to it.  First of all I like all of these cavemen movies and When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth and One Million B.C. are the two top ones.  Set in the time before earth had a moon--I guess this is before both man and dinosaur were supposed to have existed.  And yes, is the typical story of all blonds being kept around for sacrifice only...why else do you think there are so few?

Looking at the SUN zealot it kind of makes me wonder if he was impotent...afterall, if you look at the first three sacrifices, I think I could have found much more to do with them than toss'm into the drink.

PROS:

1.  The music goes fine with this movie kind of letting you know our humble past but always aspiring forward and upward.

2.  Special effects, fine.

3.  Monsters fine.  These guys took some time to make a dinosaur.  A combination of stop and go anim., and real lizards dress up.

4.  Cuties are all cuties--no star there of course.

5.  Now lets get to some of the meat of the movie.  Other reviewers laugh and scoff at these sudden storms and other bad weather so let me fill you in on something.  In the opening scenes, while the three cuties are about to be tossed off the cliff...everybody looks up at the sun and so does the camera and zealot.  It changes size and shape, the wind picks up to storm level and waves are created with white caps.  Well, in my opinion this is supposed to be caused by an off shore, over the horizon, volcanic explosion.  Probably a cleaner explosion than most--near the top of the volcano.  Volcanic gas spews out and a moment or two later the top of the volcano explodes.  The gas screws up the sun light and the 'slow blow' explosion stirs up the air.

six.  Storm scenes with people in the water are fine.  Well done and appear to been shot outside in the real ocean.

7.  I think the zealot is also some sort of warlord.  He throws a lot of orders around in the movie, people get killed, nobody back talks him.  but during the funeral I have to say as he looked to heaven his eyes were crossed--hmmm, just pretending to pray.

8.  Yes, if you listen and pay attention, the language does seem to have some rudimentry meaning.  My opinion is the language has few words with many meanings.  You take that Akita! word for instance.  Everybody seems to use it and know what it means.  It has three consonents (did I spell that right?) and therefore comes from three different words.  You would think these guys had a lot of one word sentences.  I reckon if you said more than five words you were considered long winded.

9.  Interesting story line.  One of the blond bombs escapes sacrifice and this is the story of her escaping the zealot and the zealot tracking her down no matter how far away she runs or how many people he gets kills finding her.  After all, if he doesn't find and kill her the sun will never return to normal.  This is a fine story line and it works.

10.  Another interesting possibilitly is the people the blond take up with seem to either ignore the sun's change or else that is why they are throwing that dance party later in the afternoon.  If I were a caveman I think dancing around a lot would work better than...""Akita, oodalla, neikro!""  This means ""Uh oh, the sun's spazing out.  There's a cutie to sacrifice.  Well, that's it for her!""

11.  There are indeed a couple of subplots here.  Basically they are a fine addition to the story.  I won't go into detail here...oh yes, I heard that the brunette--who was the leading man's woman--was a 'miss hotty' in Europe when this was shot.  She supposed to have been their 'Scarlet O'Hara' at the time of this film.

12.  Yes, the swimsuits are small.  On the cutties they look 'real' small.

13.  Victoria Vetri is the lead female and believe it or not I did detect some acting--watch her face...to.  The only brown eyed blond I ever seen...afterall cavewomen have not yet discovered hair dye yet.

14.  Jumping close to the end of the movie...you remember that volcano I was telling you about that they never showed on camera?  And the several other times it either blots out, changes the shape of, or disfigures the sun...well its about to have its day.  Unseen, the underwater part of the volcano blows up.  A sesmic water wave fifty or so feet tall makes it showing.  Naturally when all the cavemen and cavewomen see it coming they must try to out run it by running along side the ocean.  You know it's coming in because all the water is draining off the beach.  Oh well, nobody said cavemen were overly intelligent.

15.  I liked the funeral scene...not a bad way to go with the whole village standing around  saluting your body as they pour fuel over you.  Light it up with a torch and push it out to sea with the appropriate music.  Hmmm, not bad at all.  Maybe that's where the Vikings got it.  I mean, you take the village leader, tall, strong, fine shape and red headed.  A nice stern look on his face during the funeral.  Give that guy a shield and battleaxe and you have Eric the Red.  Hmmm, I think you guys should study that funeral scene a few times...I don't think I've ever seen it better done except in that movie (I think it was...) The Vikings.

16.  The quicksand scene:  Yes there is such a thing underwater and is considered incredibly deadly--ask anybody in National Geographic.

17.  Man eating crabs?  Finely done.  I've heard that these armour plated spiders have a ten foot long leg spread on the bottom of the ocean.  (They do have some 'real' monsters down there yea know.)

CONS:

Regardless of the other reviews throwing off on this movie--I feel it is carried through to its' conclusion with all subplots tight up nicely. done.  The writer should have done a little more study on the language part.  I think he did...just not enough.

So all in all, this is a four or five star movie.  The writing is there, the idea is there and carried out just fine.  The acting (believe it or not) is right on target.  They had enough money and everybody did their part.  The special effects are on target and despite the sexy over tones they take a back seat to the story--good, that's how it should be done.

So why do I give five stars to a four star movie...well, the funeral.

I felt a slight tightening in my throat...who would have thought it?

There it is.  I'm not sure I can rate this movie down to the level with the other popcorn movies so lets just say a salad bowl of popcorn, two hot dogs and a big drink. Though it is all laid out there for you and requires little thought to figure it out I recommend deeper study, and as we all know deep study of a movie requires both corn and dogs.
