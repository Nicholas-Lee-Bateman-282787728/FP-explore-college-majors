8127207,3,B000FVQLP2,"The packaging is good but the film quality is terrible! If it was meant to be like an old-time Serial Series the series begins in the middle. Poor film quality makes the viewing rather difficult and no character set-up makes it even more difficult to follow the plot-line. Sadly, I can not recommend this to anyone, not even for the $7-8 dollars charged for the product.",1275782400,,370,4.621212121212121

None have undergone restoration, yet the relative obscurity of their titles and its reasonable cost make these a worthwhile purchase.
