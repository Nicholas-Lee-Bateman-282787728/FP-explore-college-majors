8193390,5,B000PUB572,"The Idaho Kid: After his wife's death Clint Hollister refuses to have anything to do with his infant son Todd. John Endicott, the neighboring rancher, and his wife take Todd in and raise him as their own along with their daughter Ruth.  Bitter and hard Hollister turns his back on the Endicott's friendship and thus a twenty-five year feud begins. As soon as he's old enough to understand what's going on Todd, hoping to fix the situation, runs away.
The film opens up with Todd Hollister(Rex Bell)returning home after fifteen years. Desiring to reconcile with his father he decides to adopt the name Idaho and take a job on the Hollister spread. Along the way Idaho befriends the kid(Dave Sharpe) who proves to be a loyal sidekick. But will Idaho be able to win his father's approval? And can he prevent real harm from befalling the Endicotts? It seems a monumental task. The ending is exciting as well as taking an unexpected twist.
Also to be seen in this picture are: Charlie King, at his bad guy best; Lane Chandler, as the Endicott foreman; and of course Dave Sharpe, better known as a stuntman, very cabably taking on the roll of sidekick.
 Law & Lead: The Jurez Kid promised Jimmy Sawyer(Rex Bell) he'd go straight. So needless to say Jimmy is cocerned when he hears that the Kid is back at work again. He investigates and is met with a puzzling situation: there are two Jurez Kids!
  I was not really familiar with Rex Bell as a cowboy actor when I purchased this film. I bought it mostly on a whim and was not sorry at all. ""The Idaho Kid"" was my favorite of the two, Law and Lead dragging a bit, though it was still enjoyable. ""Idaho"" had a pretty decent screen play. I will mention briefly that this dvd was only available from Alpha Videos and I purchased it with some trepidation, but I was pleasantly surprised. The picture was clear and the sond was good. I recomend this film to any b-western fan. You'll enjoy it.",1215475200,3,1931,4.5243553008595985
