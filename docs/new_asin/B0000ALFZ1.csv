7997559,5,B0000ALFZ1,"The songs included on the DVD are;

1. Falls On Me - Natural Selection CD

2. Won't Back Down - Natural Selection CD

3. In My Hands - Something Like Human CD

4. Shimmer - Sunburn CD

5. Bittersweet - Sunburn CD

This DVD was intended to be just a sampler of Fuel and teaser for their release of Natural Selection Album. Whilst it was short with only 5 songs, they were great music clips and I enjoyed seeing the band perform.",1108684800,,427,4.146341463414634

Before spending my hard-earned cash on this dvd, I'd only seen their video for `Won't Back Down', and I loved it.  So naturally, after hearing that a dvd would be released with a collection of FUEL videos, I decided that I'd get it as soon as possible.  So, I did.  And while I was quite pleased to have it to see some videos for some fabulous songs, I couldn't help but feel kinda let down.

Don't get the wrong impression; these videos are great.  It starts off with a video for `Falls on Me', the lead single from FUEL's newest album ""Natural Selection"", and although this video is more like a buncha clips of FUEL recording the album and isn't the official one that you've seen on MTV, it's still fun to watch these guys hard at work and just being themselves.

The video for `Won't Back Down' comes next, featuring the band playing this heavy track on the tip top of a skyscraper . . . and even though it may sound stupid already, it's an awesome track, and an awesome video.

My favorite song EVER comes up next: `Hemorrhage (in my hands)'.  Great great great . . . I love everything about this song, so of course I'd love everything about the video.  It's so emotional, so beautiful . . . ugh, it gives me such monstrous goosebumps.

After that AMAZING song, the video for `Shimmer' pops up.  If I'm not gravely mistaken, `Shimmer' was FUEL's first real music video ever, not to mention FUEL's first single from FUEL's first album.  A lot of firsts.  It's a great video that's fun to watch and fun to listen to.

The last video is `Bittersweet', which, despite the fabulous quality of the song itself, is just lame.  It's shows the band performing the song in concert as some mischievous concert-goers slip underneath the stage and rock it to pieces, leaving each band member on separate crowd-surfing pieces of stage at the end of the song.  Nothing else to it but that.  That's all.  Gee wiz . . . well, it's at least fun to watch if you feel like having a good laugh, or if you're trying to appreciate how far FUEL has come since those days

But, despite the fact that the existing videos here are loads of fun, I simply need more!

I am quite possibly one of the most hardcore fans of FUEL in existence, and so the omission of other videos like `Sunburn', `Innocent', `Bad Day', `Jesus or a Gun', or `Last Time' are almost unacceptable.  I admit that I haven't seen any of these videos to begin with, but that's all the more reason for FUEL to get an entire collection of their videos together.  I NEED MORE!!!

So in conclusion, the dvd is all quite enjoyable for the videos that it has, but . . . it could've been so, SO much more.  Purchase at your own risk, unless you're a diehard Fuelite, in which case this is a must have!  3 stars.",1085184000,4,2841,4.363809523809524
