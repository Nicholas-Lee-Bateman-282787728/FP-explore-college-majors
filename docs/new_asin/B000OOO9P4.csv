8185775,5,B000OOO9P4,"This is a great little DVD for kids.  My grandson, Jacob just loves this show and asks me to put it on each time he comes to visit; sometimes three and four times that day.  It also has lots of good info on recycling; how to separate your items and how the whole recycling process works.  Very informative for little minds.  Great!",1253404800,2,331,4.290322580645161
