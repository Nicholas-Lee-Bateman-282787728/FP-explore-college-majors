7977244,5,B00007K025,If you liked movies like The Watermelon Woman or Go Fish you will also like this movie. It was obviously low budget which I really like in movies I prefer rough edges to overproduced. The actors were realistic and believable (read: real lesbians that look like wimmin you know) and the story line was cute. I thought it was a great date movie. Not too deep... plot you can relate to.,1168214400,5,383,4.408450704225352
