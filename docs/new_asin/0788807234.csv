7790904,2,0788807234,"My 2 year old son loves Pooh, and watches these videos over and over, so I've become familiar with all of them in detail.
I just love Tigger, so when I saw this title, I snatched it up, eager to share it with my son. Now, he loved it, so I would still recommend you buy this one. Just don't make it a priority. I, on the other hand, was sadly disappointed with it.
""All's Well That End's Well"" was terrible. If that was the only story I'd seen with Tigger in it, I would never allow my son to watch Tigger at all. It is only because I love him so much in all the other stories that I put up with it. Tigger is not likable in this one. He's whiny, selfish, greedy, and annoying. It's best just to fast forward through it.
""Stripes"" was by far the best story on the tape, and makes it worth buying. It was a clever little tale, with a nice song and a real message - it's what's inside you that counts.
""Luck Amok"" is okay. It's not the best Pooh/Tigger story I've seen in these ""new"" videos, but it's enjoyable enough.
All in all, this video is worth buying. Your kids will love it, even if the first story sends you, groaning, from the room..",1088294400,,1141,4.075555555555556
7790905,4,0788807234,"For the most part, the half-hour TV versions of Winnie-the-Pooh leave a lot to be desired for fans of the bear of little brain. Sparks of the characterization and warmth evident in the original movie show occasionally. Sure, they're worth viewing, but often leave you wanting more.
""Stripes,"" however, is one of the best televised efforts. There's a familiar, simple, underlying message; a new (albeit not fully realized) song; and an actual story arc. This is one that will entertain and teach children, and manages also to not nauseate adults longing for the ""classic"" Pooh bear.",971308800,4,581,5.0625
