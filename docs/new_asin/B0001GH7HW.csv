Yes, this is a throwback to a time when only women with ample cleavage were allowed to become vampires. It is fun to watch, but not on its own terms.

1998082,4,B0001GH7HW,"Even though I've only seen the American cut of this movie and the print that I saw was in pretty bad condition, I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie.  This is everything a classic drive-in movie should be - a great Gothic setting, exotic babes, old-school vampire effects, and even an all-too-short sexy vampire catfight.  Truth be told, the deteriorating public domain print that I saw actually added to the whole atmosphere of this trip down Gothic Lane.  Let me be clear about this, though - not having seen this actual DVD, I'm a little unsure what version of the film it contains.  It is listed as 88 minutes, which falls about halfway between the version I saw and the fully restored version.  I have heard that at least some ""88 minute"" releases of this film were actually just 73 minutes, so don't believe everything a box cover or product description tells you.  As far as I'm concerned, though, any version of this film is worth seeing, especially if you love old-school horror as much as I do.

The film stars Anita Ekberg, Miss Sweden of 1950, who made something of a name for herself in Italian cinema during the 1960s.  She plays Sylvia Morel, a model who - just prior to her wedding - finds out that she has inherited a castle in Waldrick (don't ask me where it is - all I know is that it's 800 miles from Rome).  She figures she'll go check the place out and bring her pretty little countess self home in time to marry her fianc&eacute;, Dr. Piero Luciani (Gianni Medici).  Her uncle, however, has other plans for her.  Sylvia is the spitting image of her grandmother Malenka (who was burned at the stake by a mob of peasants), so it seems only fitting that she should share in the family ""curse.""  I think you can see where this is going.  Throw in a couple of attractive barmaids, a hot vampire babe in a slinky black dress, and a bit of comic relief in the form of Piero's best friend Max, and you've got yourself a good time.

I'll never understand why great European horror films like this have been routinely butchered by American distributors.  It's bad enough that we miss out on 17 minutes of action, but I'm in no mood to ever forgive said butchers for the ending of the edited version.  Unbelievably idiotic and beyond campy, that final scene really leaves a bad taste in your mouth no matter how much you enjoyed the rest of the movie.  I certainly don't blame Spanish film director Amando de Ossorio, the man who gave the world Knights Templar zombies in such films as La Noche del Terror Ciego, though.  Heck, the man's movie still holds up fairly well with almost 1/6 of its original running time removed.  Suffice it to say, old-school horror fans should really check out this Spanish-Italian co-production - especially if you can get your hands on the full, unedited version.",1287014400,14,2818,4.533596837944664
1998083,2,B0001GH7HW,"Ok, if this is a ""Collector's Edition"", I'd hate to see the standard edition- this is a sloppy release at best, with a very grainy image throughout. Also, the Amazon description says ""letterboxed"" - it's not. It's fullscreen. The title sequence is sort of letterboxed (though the credits are still cut off), but that's it.

The Retrovision release is actually better image quality, though both releases seem to be edited for television. Retro's image is much less grainy and seems to have slightly better (more complete) full-screen image information.",1178236800,5,551,5.191011235955056
1998084,2,B0001GH7HW,"This movie started out with lots of potential but went downhill fast. These were the weakest vampires I have ever seen, the movie broke most of the ""vampire rules"", but on a good note plenty of eye candy.",1163030400,2,204,4.394736842105263
1998085,2,B0001GH7HW,"Super-model Anita Ekberg inherits a castle, breaks off her engagement, and falls under the spell of her cold and strange uncle as she learns more of her inheritance and her heritage.

  Or something like that.  FANGS OF THE LIVING DEAD (aka Bloody Girl, Malenka the Vampire, The Niece of the Vampire and The Vampire's Niece) is hard to follow and probably not worth the trouble.  I think Ekberg's grandmother Malenka (also played by Ekberg) was a dabbler in the black arts, outed and burned at the stake by irate villagers just after she'd brought Uncle Max to life, or undeath.  Anyway, she's burning while he's fluttering his eyelids and wiggling his fingers.  You figure it out.

  In any event, there's a spooky castle, a creepy vampire uncle, busty barmaids, a gallant fianc and trusty sidekick, and bunches of garlic hanging in every innocent window and doorway.  This may well have been a satire that will appeal to fans of the genre.  I just found it unpleasantly confusing.",1109980800,11,982,4.81437125748503

Upon arrival, she is greeted by a strange, ultra-thin uncle, who tells her of her grandmother named ""Malenka"" -(this was also the movie's original title)-, sealed in the castle's underground crypt. Thankfully, the castle is also the home of a vampire babe in an eye-popping outfit! She's the sort of gal that could bite my neck any time! There are also two local barmaids, one of whom is afraid she's being turned into a nosferatu. Anyway, the rest of the movie is a confusing trainwreck. However, Ms. Ekberg, the vampire babe, and the two village barmaids made it all rather painless and somehow enjoyable! There's even a vampiric catfight!! Worth a look...",1105833600,6,750,4.9603174603174605
1998087,2,B0001GH7HW,"A young woman on the verge of marriage discovers that she has inherited a castle and is now a Countess.  She decides to visit her new land before her wedding.

Fianc is not put off and journeys to find out what is going on.

Suddenly everyone is being attacked by vampires.  The fianc and a friend set out on a daring rescue with the local doctor.

In the end the whole thing comes off a just silly.  The final scene has one of the vampires chasing someone through the bright daylight with no ill effects.  One gets the feeling that the film's creators were trying to reproduce the feeling of the Hammer vampire films but failed.  The characters' motivations and emotions jump all over the place with little or no consistency.  When done one can only wonder who would enjoy this film.",1102291200,4,944,4.5266272189349115
1998108,1,B0001GH7HW,"I love 60s-70s Euro-horror, but this...this! Beyond terrible. None of it holds together at all, and if you know these kinds of movies there's a pretty low standard for storytelling. Ekberg plays a model who inherits a Spanish castle and its resident vampire cult. She inexplicably abandons her fiancee to join them which pisses the fellow off enough that he comes looking for her. But the plot thickens as we learn that the chief vampire is, in fact, Ekberg's 150 year-old ancestor who wants her as his bride; but is he really? Some doubts arise as the...the...zzzzzzzzzzzzzz...It has all the ingredients of something better: the iconic Ekberg, some truly atmospheric Euro locations, a couple of stunning vampire babes, but nothing comes of it. It is so cliched, off-handed, and cheap that it's obvious none of the cast or crew gave a crap. Some movies are bad/funny. This ain't one of them.",1440460800,4,891,4.9072847682119205

1998113,2,B0001GH7HW,"As my headline states, this movie is ridiculous.  I like vampire movies so I thought that this would be a treat.  Therefore, ignoring the reviews, I plunged right in.  Why did I have to do that?

Ridiculous (Spoilers)

1.  ""I have to get Sylvia off this island"".  Ok, but didn't she plead with you to do that the day before but you said you had to investigate?
2.  You clearly see the woman, whose funeral you were at earlier, get out of her grave but you still say the craziness around you is a farce?
3.  How as Sylvia expected to turn her fianc&eacute; into a vampire when she wasn't a vampire herself?
4.  I thought vampires were only visible in the evening (except in Twilight).  So why was the waste of time friend visible in the day (unless that was supposed to be a joke)?
5.  What was with all the cleavage?

1998114,3,B0001GH7HW,"Ms. Eckberg was a joy to watch, as she was one of the world's most beautiful women.  The storyline is typical in the old country vampire tradition, so I liked the location of the tale.  Fans may not know that she is more than eighty years old today and seeks aid from her famous director's foundation.  Her outstanding performance in this film certainly shows how much of the director's fame should be attributed to Anita Eckberg; therefore, his foundation should be happy to financially support her today!",1405382400,,506,4.793103448275862

8012130,3,B0001GH7HW,"I was really looking forward to this one, so it pains me to say its pretty disappointing. I love Amando de Ossorios films. From campy creature features to nightmarish undead gems, they transport me to a faraway realm where eerie gothic atmosphere meets macabre imagery with a dash of sleaze and a touch of schlock. Alas, the worst thing any horror movie can be is boring, and Fangs of the Living Dead is a well-filmed, lavishly-set snooze fest.

Beautiful Sylvia is 2 weeks away from marrying her man when a letter arrives informing her that shes the beneficiary of her dead uncles castle. She ditches her dude and heads to the Italian countryside. When she shows up, theres a whole lot of yapping about vampires and danger, which sounds promising until you realize Ossorios not planning to deliver any dread, tension or carnage.

The most frustrating aspect about FOTLD is that it has half the ingredients for a cool gothic horror film: 17th century castle, a crypt with candles flickering against its stone walls, gorgeous women, and bloodsucker lore. Problem is, theres no atmosphere, action or scares to make the things interesting, or break up the stretches of dialogue. The vampire presence is toned way down to barely-there, and were left with too many scenes of unnecessary exposition, slowing the run time to a crawl and jumbling the already-messy script further. It wouldve been cool if Scream Factory made this half of a(nother Amando de Ossorio) double feature, cuz its just not strong enough to stand on its own. Special features are a commentary by Troy Howarth and trailer.

So what are the bright sides? Well, the movie looks cool. The cinematography is clear and colorful, and Scream Factory, as always, presents a fantastic restoration of this Spanish-Italian obscurity. The transfer is nearly flawless and colors pop in every scene, especially with the lavish medieval decor of the castle. If you're already a fan of Ossorios films you're gonna buy this regardless of my take on it. And you should. But if you're hoping for an eerie gothic horror flick with morbid imagery and violence, start with Tombs of the Blind Dead, Night of the Seagulls, and the Night of the Sorcerers/The Loreleys Grasp double feature.

Released in 69 as Malenka and retitled in 71 for American drive-in audiences, Fangs predates Ossorios best films so its safe to assume he hadnt fully honed his style yet. That said, Im genuinely grateful to see ANY of this mans work resurrected, restored and released on BD, and I look forward to more in the future.",1520553600,9,2548,4.877598152424942

It begins in a European city. A doctor gets a telephone call from his fiance, a beautiful model. She has inherited a castle and title in Waldreck. It does not have the comforts of Rome. People are impressed by her name. The Count never appears until night time. Sylvia Morel meets her uncle. Sylvia is the image of her grandmother Malinka. Her mother is buried in the castles crypt. At night Sylvia gets a visitor, who tells her about her uncle and mother Sonia. Blinka tells her to sleep, her uncle arrives! Sylvia is surprised to see her uncle with Blinka. Her uncle tells her how her mother died: at the hands of angry villagers as a witch! And her father is not dead.

She breaks her engagement with Piero in a letter. He goes to try to meet her. Has she turned into a snob? In the village the bar maid has developed anemia. Her window will be closed and garlic placed by it. Does someone want to hurt Berta? Is the belief in vampires a form of collective psychosis? Doctor Piero is called because of Bertas grave illness. The local doctor is sure of his diagnosis of Bertas death. Her uncle has a ritual to keep Sylvia young for all eternity. But she refuses. Berta visits Sylvias uncle at night. Sylvia frees Blinka from her chains, she tells Sylvia where to go. Berta follows her, Sylvia runs to the inn.

Berta is seen in the village. The cure is a wooden stake. The men wait in the cemetery for Berta to reappear. She does. The men go to the castle to find Sylvia. Piero finds her but is told to go away. Pieros friend meets a vampire! Piero is captured and chained. The uncle explains Bertas condition. Will Sylvia bite Piero or free him? Berta fights with Malinka! Piero attacks the uncle with a burning torch, who returns to his natural state! The fire burns him up. Sylvia and Piero leave in the morning for Rome. Bertas sister wants to go to Rome  also, but Pieros friend has changed overnight.

You can see the parallels to Bram Stokers famous novel, but it doesnt compare to the Hollywood movies of the past. This story is slow paced but worth watching once in comparison. Most cultures have legends of vampires, the oldest story is found in the Epic of Gilgamesh from the Sumerian civilization of 5,000 years ago. This story symbolizes how the aristocracy exploits the people.",1483056000,,2330,4.485849056603773

Standard early color vampire horror flick.  Sometimes these old ones will show up and I'll bite on 'em.  I think it is always about the mystique and what powers does this vampire really have.
