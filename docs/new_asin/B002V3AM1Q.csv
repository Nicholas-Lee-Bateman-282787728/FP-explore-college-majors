8381723,5,B002V3AM1Q,"Beautiful visual and audio representation of Cuba. My only drawback to this one is that there were some repeated clips from one of his other DVD's but if you see it as a 'stand alone"" product it was wonderful.",1371600000,,209,4.384615384615385

8381726,5,B002V3AM1Q,"Documentary on early to mid-tewntieth Century Cuba and its music by Enrique Chia.  Nice photography, good music, and good dance scenes.  Enrique Chia is a talented pianist and the music (as written) is great.  Personally, I would have preferred to listen to the music as played by the original orchestras and bands as some of the richness and diversity of this music is lost in translation.  (Some of Chia's renditions, despite techniqual quality, are the Cuban equivalent of elevator music.)  Carping aside, the photographs and imbedded videos are great and the Island of Cuba is a great starring attraction.  One has the sense that putting this together was a labor of love for the Cuban-born Chia.  I lived in Cuba for a time when I was a boy and enjoyed the nostalgic quality of the film.",1279238400,6,792,4.779411764705882
