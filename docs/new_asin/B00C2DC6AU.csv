8576500,5,B00C2DC6AU,"Cissy Houston shines in this documentary that gives insight into her early success that ultimately contributed to the enormous talent and success that would become Whitney Houston. Whitney sang just like her mother. Her mannerisms, expression and the way she interpreted a song came from this amazing lady who stayed true to her church and faith in God. God works in mysterious ways and the example is a highlight of this documentary. A rare clip of Cissy and Gary joining Whitney on stage for a touching rendition of We Are Family from the play Dreamgirls. It demonstrates how a mother can pass onto her daughter so much knowledge and influence and God then supplied the rest. Whitney Houston was one beautiful woman with a voice that was unparalleled, except by her mother. What we all wish for our children is that they become more than what we are. Whitney had a gift from God that obvious was passed onto her from Cissy, who contributed to the music industry way before her daughter came along. Buy this DVD for an insight into Cissy Houstons life and see Whitney as a bonus. Also features interviews with Luther, Dionnne, Aretha, The Sweet Inspirations and more. Definitely worth the $20.",1523577600,,1194,4.800970873786408

Well-spoken guests, forthright and inspired Cissy, both reflecting on her life and showing in church what she is about. Touching and inestimably essential. Must see for all who liked ""20 Feet from Stardom."" Because Cissy is a genius and cornerstone cultural force.",1454198400,2,343,5.254545454545455

Whitney got her talent honestly. Thank everyone involved in getting Cissy HOuston's life on film.",1375920000,6,270,4.891304347826087
