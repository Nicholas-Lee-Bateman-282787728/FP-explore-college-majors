Ron Block is a master on the banjo and his instruction is excellent!!",1377734400,,147,4.481481481481482
8342452,5,B001TX4C6U,"Lots of background discussion at the beginning, but you soon see how it fits.  Good detailed breakdown.  If you like Ron's bluesy string bending style, you'll get a good start on that, as well as more conventional Scruggs style.  Learn kickoffs or breaks from some of Ron's most well-known tunes.  Top notch backup players for the band segments.  See his web site for a few additional tabs including the pentatonic scales he describes.",1353715200,,435,4.904109589041096
