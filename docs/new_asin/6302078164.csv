It's not very easy to watch for the first time ever seeing sacha baron cohen, I can tell you that. Who is this foreign guy? I have seen a lot of people looking confused who are not familiar with him. It might not be funny right away. It was hilarious to me. Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius actor, so dead on with his impressions and stone cold in his nerves being able to maintain character in the most delicate of situations. I commend him for that, he deserves an academy award for his work. However, it's a bit dry at times, it's not always juicy with comedy and that's the part where it fails, likewise with Bruno. When you can't have 100% comedy, there has to be good story line, good romance or drama, something to weave together the funniness. Unfortunately the plot here is Borat looking for Pamela Anderson basically, which is funny, but a pretty weak storyline. Likewise Bruno had a similar shallow story line of trying to become famous however he can. Dumb, but nevertheless Sacha carries either movie along quite strong with his hilarious impressions and ridicule of strangers born in ignorant times and places. He really brought out the worst of people in such delicate and beautiful ways, and handled it like a champ. Academy award, for best actor in stupid film award?",1506988800,,1382,4.488095238095238

Borat is perfect as he acts innocently and some of the funniest parts are the reactions of the people who he encounters, such as the news station folks.  One scene of the young college boys in the motor home were offensive; however, it contained a perfect lesson in human relations:  If a woman gives her body to a man he won't call her back.  Why?  Because he doesn't respect her!  Spoken honestly by a drunk college boy and true as can be.  I give this movie a High Five!!

2350540,1,6302078164,"Released in 2006, ""Borat"" is a mockumentary about Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen), a TV reporter of a popular show in the fictional Kazakhstan, who is sent to the United States by his government to report on the greatest country in the world. With a documentary crew in tow, Borat interviews various people (who are unaware it's all a joke) and eventually becomes intent on meeting and marrying Pamela Anderson.

As my title blurb says, ""Borat"" isn't funny; it's just stupid, intentionally offensive and phony. As far as the latter goes, the last part with Pamela Anderson is totally contrived and goes against the very directive of the movie -- to film people without their knowing the documentary's fake and showing their authentic responses to the weird and idiotic Borat character.

The fact that this POS grossed $128,505,958 in America alone tells you where we are as a society and explains the mass support for someone like HiLIARy.

The movie runs 84 minutes.

Basically, Borat is the most ignorant character I have ever seen. Sometimes, I see a movie or a see a character that is just so stupid that it's not even funny. But somehow this works. To give you an comparison, if any of you have seen the movie, ""Dumb & Dumber"", they were near geniuses compared to Borat. At least they knew that a toilet was where you do your business.

I laughed so hard, so many times, that my abs actually got a bit of a workout. If you have a good sense of humor, and are not offended easily, you will love this movie!",1463702400,3,784,3.89375

2350691,3,6302078164,"Sasha Baron Cohen has written and acted in the title character Borat from Kazakhstan, a former part of the Soviet Union. As Borat, Baron Cohen does a superb job in the role. Borat does a documentary about his American journey.

There are funny moments like Borat getting a pet bear to protect him and his business partner to protect them from the Jews. If Sasha Baron Cohen wasn't Jewish, he couldn't get away with it. According to his Kazakhstan, it is heavily anti-Semitic where they have a running of the Jewas an annual event. It's uncomfortable to watch Borat in a Jewish home too.

The Anti-Semitism provides uncomfortable moments in the film.

The worst is watching naked Borat chase his fat traveling partner throughout a hotel. It was not for passion but a fight over a magazine. It was disgusting and tasteless to say the least.

The film has some memorable moments too. The DVD provides about 30 minutes of cut footage. I would have liked a behind the scenes feature to explain Borat to the audience.",1428969600,,1011,4.694915254237288

My only complaints about this documentary is that sometimes the quality of the footage is very poor, like I am watching an old VHS cassette.  I also think that the complete title of the documentary ('Cultural Learning of American for Make..."") is a bit too wordy.

We enjoy intelligent satire and movies and movies that mock the absurdity of some politically correctness. But this one definitely scores an outstanding F-.

2350788,4,6302078164,"Having seen Sacha Baron Cohen's follow-up mockumentary Bruno first, which is an incredible testimony to the overall shallowness and shortsightedness of humankind, I can see where Cohen was building his talent (and his budget) to become Bruno.  In this case, the outtakes and scenes removed from the film were more telling than the ones included.  This film reminds me of many talents earlier in their character development before they matured into something compelling.  As was the case with Bruno, the major lessons to be learned about ourselves, our character, our true shallow, self-guiding, ignorant motivations as humans, are lost upon those who should most benefit from learning them.  I am glad we have someone like Sacha Baron Cohen who can use comedy as a medium to relay some heavy-hitting important social and political lessons to the public in a more palatable fashion than, say, Naom Chomsky or Michael Moore.  He just sneaks them in through comedy.  I look forward to more of Cohen's work and hope he does not lose his edge.  We need it.",1393372800,,1051,4.9714285714285715

This movie has witty, borderline crossing humor throughout - a film for anyone who is humored easily and enjoys parodies/farces.

If you are question why I am giving this movie 4/5, let me key in some opinions of mine:

- Borat is somebody that is hard to get attached to as a character. This may seem like a big nitpick for a comedy movie, but I believe all good movies should have good characters. Little or no likable character development exists in this movie.
- The movie may seem dragged out when it is trying to take itself seriously (in a funny way, if that makes any sense)

2350799,2,6302078164,"Borat (rhymes with boring) is a pointless film that revolves around potty humor and tired clichs. Borat Sagdiyev is a journalist/TV personality in Kazakhstan, which is stereotyped as a backward, vulgar society of cretins. Borat travels to the US to make a documentary. He sees a video clip of Baywatch star and Playboy playmate Pamela Anderson and decides he is going to marry her, so he sets off on a cross-country trip with his traveling companion from Kazakhstan, Azamat Bagatov.

Along the way they meet a variety of American stereotypes including a Pentecostal preacher and his congregation, black street teenagers, fraternity boys, a southern country club couple, rude New Yorkers, etc. etc. Most are shocked or put off by Borats verbal malapropisms and inappropriate behavior, and their reactions expose their racism and bigotry. Or so the hype goes. This is supposedly a satire. It might have been more effective as satire if Borat himself was not so obnoxious.

The humor, if it can be called that, is of the grossest and most predictable kind. The bull-in-a-china-shop scene where Borat stumbles around in an antique store breaking hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise, has been around since Laurel & Hardy. He is crushed when the frat boys show him a sex tape of Pamela Anderson. At a posh dinner party he asks his hostess to use the toilet and when he returns he hands her a plastic bag of feces.

Bad taste might be excusable if it were truly funny or serves a  purpose, and I suppose I will be labeled stuffy and uptight for not finding these funny. Sacha Baron Cohen has created a character that millions of people obviously found hilarious judging from reviews and the popularity of the film.

The movie was written and produced by English comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. He also plays the title character, Borat Sagdiyev, a fictitious Kazakh journalist traveling through the United States recording real-life interactions with Americans. Much of the movie features unscripted vignettes of Borat interviewing and interacting with Americans, who believe he is a foreigner with little or no understanding of American customs.[2] It is the second of three films built around Baron Cohen's characters from Da Ali G Show (20022004). Ali G Indahouse (2002) featured a cameo by Borat, and the third film, Brno, was released in 2009.",1355788800,3,879,5.3768115942028984

Sacha Baron Cohen stars as Borat and provides one of the most uproarious performances of his career to date.

Some viewers may feel that this film heckles America but it is important to consider that Borat's naivety in displaying acceptable conduct is the essence of the narrative, and his own misguided philosophy makes a fool out of many people, yet he is the butt of all the joking even though he pulls some unwitting people in with him.

This movie does have a lot of crude and politically incorrect humour, yet in a world that at times can be too sensitive for its own good, it's a different experience to see a film that breaks all the rules and throws the viewer off their seat with a combination of disbelief and laughter.

Many people were swindled into signing a release before filming scenes that made them look stupid or foolish. If they did not have informed consent that contract may be null and void. A class action suit for defamation giving actual and punitive damages would put an end to these mock documentaries. Let them use real actors paid real wages to perform their script. Does this film have any redeeming social values?

The impact of this film is how it measures popular taste. Barnum knew his public, and we may not be much different today.

Does this film poke fun at stereotyped people? Does it have a political purpose in portraying ordinary people and taking advantage of them? Comedies of manners have always shown humor from the differences in expectations and reality (""Seinfeld"", ""Candid Camera""). ""Borat"" is like goading dumb animals to make them perform for a paying audience. Hours of filming ordinary people just to select the minutes where they can be made to look foolish and using a shill to guide the conversation and provoke comments is part of show business. You can see this on the ""Tonight"" show, or in some documentaries (like ""Sixty Minutes""). Its not likely on a live broadcast because they cannot edit out what doesn't fit.

Does the word ""borat"" have a meaning that can't be said on broadcast media? Consider this: ""Mommy, Johnny made a borat and its gross!""",1332547200,4,1402,4.829166666666667

As the movie starts you've got 'over the top' comic background of Kazakhstan, remember this is a comedy looking for laughs. The subtitles are moving fast and furious between the characters.  Borat speaks to the audience in English.  He speaks Hebrew to his Kazakh producer who answers him in Armenian.  In fact, the Kazarkh producer Azamat speaks Armenian throughout the entire film (with Borat answering him in Hebrew).  Then you have the visual 'subtitles' rich white folks, ghetto black folks, country folks, CA nerds at Pam's book signing, etc.  Mr. Cohen has translated the visual into a form of verbal, hence, the 'House of Babel'.",1332028800,3,888,4.866666666666666

He gets some really ripe stuff from the act this time around, with the lowlights of his American tour including a homophobic cowboy, a troupe of bigoted etiquette experts and an RV full of misogynist frat boys. The short, storyline-advancing scenes in between each unscripted segment are generally thin and bland, but Cohen's ad-libbed torments of the unprepared masses are clearly the movie's meat and potatoes and it wisely never strays far from that core.",1330905600,2,763,5.112

Yes, it was when I wholly realized just how `adlibbed' the majority of this film was that its genius really sunk in for me.  What Sacha Baron Cohen achieves here is not to be taken lightly.  This is a brilliantly composed slice of comedic pie; a hilarious riot that is all the more hysterical thanks to the way in which it was created.

Like I stated in my review title; the man that duped America got the last laugh.

In `Borat', Cohen portrays the fictitious character of Borat Sagdiyev, a man living in Kazakhstan who ventures to the United States (The U.S. and A) to learn experiences to further benefit his own country.  He takes along with him a fat guy and a cameraman to help document his journey.  He arrives in New York, visits News Stations, gets an etiquette coach, talks to feminist groups and then falls in love with Pamela Anderson while watching Baywatch and sets of on a nationwide adventure to find her in California.  On his journey he buys a bear to protect his from Jews, nearly insights a riot at a rodeo, finds himself partying with frat boys and gays, winds up being healed by some holly-rollers and tries to kidnap Pamela Anderson by throwing a sack over her head while attending her book signing.

The fact that 90% of this isn't staged is just amazing.

`Borat' is not a film for all.  In fact, many will find this highly offensive.  Even if you love this film you will most likely still find it highly offensive, which is part of its charm.  Cohen is a revelation here.  If is no surprise that he was inches from an Oscar nomination here (he's the only actor to win any award that year outside of Whitaker and Gosling) and he really should have gotten one; he's that inspired in his comedic approach.  He never once breaks character, which would have been hard for anyone to do while carrying around a plastic bag full of your own feces while attending a dinner party.  I just wish I had been one of the people on the subway the day he let that chicken loose.

Borat travels through the American country side and interacts with what appear to be actual Americans. The results are at times hilarious and equally disturbing considering some of the thoughts and feelings of the individuals Borat interacts with. It is always questionable which element of the film is more funny: Borat's questions or the American's responses. This film could be viewed as a sign of the times. It attempts to uncover the mainstream American culture. Arguably the best part about this feature was the controversy surrounding it upon release in the theaters.

2350902,5,6302078164,"I'm not here to launch detailed film review as I normally do... and I definitely won't endeavor to point out the nonstop political incorrectness of this crazy film. I just chiefly wanted to convey that this is the most hilarious, side-splitting film I've ever seen in my half-Century (+) on the planet.

THE STORY: Borat is a television commentator in Kazakhstan and he comes to America with his producer on a shoestring budget to document life here. He starts out in New York City but he quickly decides to head for California where his true Hollywood love is involved in the television industry (Baywatch). He encounters BIG TROUBLE (based upon his crude cultural background) everywhere he goes. It's that simple.

My brother and I watched this movie yesterday and both of us laughed so hard from beginning to end that we had to watch the movie a second time to hear all the stuff we failed to attend during the first round from laughing too loudly. Neither of us is a contemporary film fan (both of us are retired cops) but we avow to make a big exception here. We had tears in our eyes and could barely catch our breath -- it's that funny.

Is this 2006 film for everyone? Well no, the kiddies will have to be nudged out of the room (and out of earshot as well) and I assume that there are women, minorities, devout Christians, and other folks who are particularly sensitive to ethnic remarks and incendiary language who will abhor this one. I'd say that most people will come down on this movie firmly on one side or the other, with few on the fence.

So, there's some pretty provocative nudity and the language is akin to what you might expect to hear from an angry and drunken Portuguese Stevedore. Heck, the antics themselves are pretty provocative. But in the end, if you don't care about all that stuff, it's just a movie, folks -- if you think that this presentation would offend you, just don't watch it.

All others RUN... don't walk, RUN to the video store and rent or buy this crazy film! Family Dollar Stores are selling pre-viewed copies for six bucks and I've seen them elsewhere too. Make sure to get the widescreen version -- 84 minutes of rolling-on-the-floor-and-you-know-what-else.",1267056000,,2204,4.655526992287918

However, juwes like Eli Roth in his movie Hostel and Sacha Baron Cohen in this movie Borat have the nerve to mock these poor people.  Juwes can dish it out but can't take it.  Someone should do a movie depicting Juwes in a negative light the way they depict nonJuwes in a negative light.  I cannot think of any race more despicable than juwes.  They are hypocrites.  They won't tolerate defamation of their race and religion, but they enthusiastically produce mockumentaries of other races and of Christians.

Brilliant social satire dark comedy-mockumentary from the creative genius of British comedy maestro Sacha Baron Cohen (Creator of ""The Da Ali G Show"") is one of his finest movies with ""Da Ali G Movie"" and ""Bruno"" which all formed a trilogy. This movie pushes no limits between taste and creativity as it's quite controversial as sometimes being antisemetic but Cohen is a British Jewish person and he defended this movie as being a satire on American culture including racism.

One question for all who loved the episodes with Bob Saget.  Will A.F.H.V. ever be released by seasons on DVD?  There are many people out there who enjoy the reruns with Bob Saget or the later reruns of A.F.H.V. with the other hosts.

If the first season along with it's pilot episode were to be released for it's 20th Anniversary, I would purchase it, since there were lots of funny videos I remember from the first season.

Hopefully ABC Productions and Vin Di Bona Productions can come to agreements on releasing this great comedy show onto DVD.  I know that there are some DVD specials with selective videos and episodes.  But, why not release them by the seasons, that way anyone and everyone can see ones that they remember, once again?

Most of the people Borat came into contact was pretty racist, and I think the director was really trying to show us all how hard America is to others.

I give the movie a 5/5 star rating because of the pure heart and loving personality of Borat.

Yet, that's Cohen's idea of comedy. It is precisely what he does in his ""acts"". It is so revolting, that one wonders why anyone would watch 2 hours of outhouse humour that was obviously addressed to the sad and dumb, probably abused, idiots who laughed at this crud. Cohen reached for the below lowest common denominator to get his guffaws. Granted I didn't see the entire effort. I left after 25mins. From the comments of people whose opinion I trust and value, I was right to extricate myself from this toxic abuse. This is the only instance where no amount of curiosity would tempt me to see it to the end. Aye, I've never walked out of a movie before. Or since.

Worst ever? you ask. Indeed, yes. I've seen more than my share of bad and boring pictures, made and/or written by talentless wannabees. But this execrable effort was a deliberate effort to make racism, misogyny, homophobia, etc., look funny to the misanthropes everywhere.

Cohen's hateful display of lack of talent may be his vengeful response for his failures in other media. After all, HBO can, will and does show anything only just on this side of pornography, yet the majority of HBO subscribers saw through Cohen's racism and false pretenses and brought and end to this affront to comedy and comedians everywhere. Even the least talented among them.

The set-ups involve people who believe him to be genuinely from Khazakstan and they treat him with kindness and help him. In return he plays cruel tricks on them, including the fact he's a British actor (Sacha Baron Cohen) pretending to be in need of their help.

According to Wiki the village (actually in Rumania) that is supposed to be his home village was badly treated ""The villagers were paid the equivalent of four U.S. dollars a day each for their appearances and were told the film would be a documentary about the hardships of village life...In the film, some of the villagers are depicted as rapists, abortionists, and prostitutes for Baron's comedy movie""

These are generally ordinary people. They are an easy target. They are often not public figures - though he does appear on a 'local-tv' news. For the most part these are people who, in genuinely treating him well should be beyond parody.

To turn anything hateful and disgusting into some kind of humorous item from the big trick store round the corner is not easy, but is it funny? What's more I had already seen many of these gagging choking gags in other films, like drinking from the toilet bowl, bringing your feces in a plastic bag to the dinner table for disposal, inviting a street lady to a dinner party in a middle class home, and so many others. In fact Schwarzenegger is more effective in that line of the cultural gap or shock between the good old Soviet culture and the American lifestyle when he plays the KGB officer in New York running after a couple of Georgian Mafiosi in Red Heat if I remember well. It is amazing how they have, through advertising, made this film into what it is not, a funny film whereas it is sad and even very sad to see the thickness of disrespect they accumulate and pile up in order to produce a shocked little laugh. But one thing is sure. This film represent the spirit of its time, that end of an eight year tenure that was getting so stale and so full of carbon dioxide and poor in oxygen that we were dying like a poor fish thrown on the grassy bank of a dried up river. Even the bush of the rose garden were severely wilted and close to death from drought, the drought of the absence of basic honesty and truthful freedom of speech. But that does not save the film, that makes it an archeological testimony of the lurking death in which we were drowning then.

Film the reactions, edit it, and you have a movie. The question for the viewer is whether it is a movie worth watching. I didn't think so. There is no wit involved here.

Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, playing a reporter from Kazakhstan ostensibly in the States to make a documentary, pulls one sadistic prank after another, from sea to shining sea, on unsuspecting folks who subsequently become his comedic accomplices.  The result is funny; hilariously funny; side-splittingly funny.

From BORAT's opening sequence from his (fictitious) village in Kazakhstan, this film serves notice that everyone, regardless of politically correct protection, is fair game.  And Cohen also sends the metaphorical shot across the bow that his brand of humor is not for the faint of heart, then promptly backs it up by such ostentatious behavior as bringing his own feces to a formal dinner gathering--to fighting and wrestling with his alleged manager (an obese and very hairy Ken Davitian) along the halls, lobby, and convention room of a packed hotel. . .both men as naked as the day they came into the world.  It's outrageous, it's often disgusting, it's raw and shocking--yet it's also hysterical, as Cohen's shocked bystanders swallow it all, hook, line, and sinker.

That's right.  From chasing terrified New Yorkers in central Manhattan to wreaking havoc in a Texas antiques store, BORAT captures people in the act of being themselves.  Most of the time it's not pretty, but it's darn sure funny, and it's 100 percent revealing.  No doubt there's a group of frat youngsters who are still wishing Cohen's camera had never been turned on.

But in the end he targets anyone he can get his cameras on.

I finally viewed this film.  I have to say that it made me laugh harder than any film I have ever seen.  I love how Sasha Cohen is able to comically highlight certain reactionary political/social attitudes that are prevalent in our society.  The best material is when he is making this social critique.  The parts that I found unfunny are when he is abusive to those of good will ... the scene at the etiquette dinner party comes to mind.  He insults one of the women at the dinner table by saying that the two women on either side of him would both be considered attractive in his nation, but not her.  Why be mean about something so personal as a woman's appearance? It seemed just like cruelty for cruelty's sake.

The bag of ""poop"" that he brings to the dinner table in the same vignette is likewise not funny and in doing so, he is basically expressing contempt for all social protocols. That is boringly base, something from a Tom Green show, not really creative.

I think that Cohen should have decided what type of film he wanted to make and been consistent with his larger vision of a good-willed but incisive social critique. Michael Moore has shown that you can be very funny but still have heart.

That being said, parts of the this film are uniquely brilliant.  I enjoyed the intro segment from Borat's ""hometown."" It was filmed in rural Romania and the authentic setting as a backdrop to the film's absurdist humor made it absolutely sidesplittingly funny.  Also very illuminating was the rodeo audience response to his comments regarding the Iraq war; the cheering from the crowd showed a bloodthirstiness that thoughtful people should abhor. The naked fight scene between him and his producer served as a humorous foil to people's homophobia.

Cohen has talent in spades, no doubt. This could have been great, but it needed a bit more tweaking so that only those deserving of volleys would have received them.",1237420800,2,1968,4.752941176470588

2350945,4,6302078164,"A couple of years ago, in 2006, the biggest comedy hit was a film called Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan. The film grew out of a recurring character on a British television show, Da Ali G. Show, created by Jewish comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. I mention the man's religion because the film attacks Anti-Semitism in a brutally funny way, even as many dull-witted critics accuse the film of that bias. If so, then Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator was also Anti-Semitic, and his Monsieur Verdoux was a defense of mass murder. Cohen plays a Kazakh television reporter, Borat Sagdiyev, sent to America to make a documentary on American living for the benefit of his home nation. That's the setup, which starts in Borat's native village, and depicts his family and villagers as a bunch of creepy, incestuous morons who have an annual `Running Of The Jew' festival, ala the bulls at Pamplona, Spain. Of course, this is not because the film is satirizing that `reality,' but because it's picking up and throwing the Western preconceptions of that country back in the faces of that audience, much the same way that the film Everything Is Illuminated portrayed the Russian natives that are presented as idiots in that film in ways to tweak the preconceptions those people and customs engender in the West. In keeping with that, the supposed Kazakh language and `National Anthem' are, naturally, gibberish and folly.

  The 84 minute film is a mockumentary that is not subtle in anything it does (ala Spinal Tap, or the Christopher Guest films), and is certainly not a work of genius, anymore than a Three Stooges short is, so why so many viewers and critics felt so negatively about the film, even as it broke box office records, shows that American stupidity is never to be underestimated, even though a similar ruckus ensued a few years earlier when the satiric tv cartoon South Park was made into a terrifically scalding movie. After the setup, the film is a series of blackout sketches that take Borat (in character) as he basically does a Candid Camera routine in front of gullible Americans who believe he is a legitimate Russian reporter. He has run ins with politicos like Alan Keyes and Bob Barr- the current Libertarian Party Presidential candidate, a gay pride parade, and a group of Feminazis. Cohen deliciously gets all to reveal their own darker and denser sides. All of the sketches are gotten through quickly, so the jokes never get old. The one thread in the film is that Borat's ugly wife dies, not long after Borat sees a Baywatch rerun, and falls in love with Pamela Anderson, whom he decides to sexually pursue crosscountry. Along with him, in a used ice cream truck they buy, is an unseen Kazakh cameraman and the film's producer, Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian). Other than Cohen and Davitian, the only other real actors in the film are Anderson, who makes a late cameo when Borat literally tries to bag her, and a black woman named Luenell, who plays a prostitute Borat ends up marrying.

  Through it all, a number of misadventures occur, such as a test of etiquette lessons at a dinner party with Southern white racists, learning cultural tips from black gangstas in a Southern hood, rodeo goers who display an immense amount of cowboy xenophobia, slavery loving frat boys who pick Borat up in the desert and show him a Pamela Anderson porno tape to dispirit him, and Pentecostalists who speak in tongues, who teach him the power of Mr. Jesus. But, bar none, the funniest scene in the film comes when Borat leaves a hotel bathroom, and finds Azamat jerking off to his magazine. The two engage in a naked fight that ends up with Azamat pouncing on Borat in a 69 position, and the two of them running naked through the hotel, until tackled and asked to leave. This is what separates the two men, and sends Borat into the desert. Ultimately, he loses Pamela Anderson- whom he never had, and marries Luenell, and reports that life back in Kazakhstan is better than before.

  The Twentieth Century Fox DVD has an old Soviet Era film feel to it, replete with badly worn looking film stock and Cyrillic lettering, and poor English translations of the gibberish Kazakh language. It has no audio commentary, but has some cool deleted scenes- although it was a good decision to excise them, especially a long and tedious (although funny) supermarket scene. There are also faux commercials- a music infomercial for the movie's soundtrack, a Kazakh Baywatch spoof called Sexydrownwatch, and an interesting compendium of the worldwide publicity tour for the film, including some late night tv appearances with Cohen in character as Borat.

  One of the more interesting sidelights of researching this film was seeing how many people who appeared, and signed waivers, tried to sue the filmmakers (including director Larry Charles). This includes the nation of Kazakhstan and a group representing Gypsies, who claim their town was defamed and presented in a bad light, for Cohen shot that portion of the film in Romania. Yet, I was not astonished. Anytime someone shows up another party, be it intellectually or humorously (or, worst of all, both ways) there are bound to be immature and money-grubbing morons looking to make an unethical buck. That none of the rubes could figure out they were being put on bespeaks the utter idiocy of the American public at large. Now, it's hard to believe all the scenes were taken cold. After all, could the frat boys have had the Pamela Anderson video needed to despoil Borat's dream? Yes, she's a frat boy fantasy, but still, Occam's Razor says it was a setup, and indeed, all the alleged lawsuits may be just a part of the publicity campaign.

  Nonetheless, the film suffers none the worse for it. And, if all the scenes were truly done cold, it bespeaks much of the goodness of the poorer and more disenfranchised members of society than the well off. Blue collar folk, the black gangstas, and the gay paraders, all embrace Borat with humor and grace, whereas the rich and white often scorn him. And, despite the harsh attacks on the film, culturally and socially, and despite there being nothing too deep here, Borat is a wonderful critique- nay, full out assault, on the asininity of Political Correctness, for, despite all the claimed offenses in the film, none of the people who appeared and filed lawsuits suffered anything they did not inflict themselves, due to their own arrogance and biases, and fully knowing they had signed proper legal releases, which is included at the film's credit's end.

  Borat is the sort of a film that comes along at a certain moment and finds its niche (the hysteria and xenophobia rampant post-9/11), due to events in the real world, but will not long be remembered once the situations that made it so popular fade. Nonetheless, even in 50 years, there will still be a dozen or so scenes that will give one laughing pains the way a Moe, Larry, and Curly eye gouge still does.

I easily named Bruno and struggled to name the obvious, Ali G, and I got my free tickets.

Let me begin by saying that I ""get"" this film. Cohen's anthropological project is not lost on me. I understand that Borat is a deconstructive mirror of American culture, but I do not understand how this is a new and funny idea. It's been done before in everything from Henry James' novel The American to Eddie Murphy's film ""Coming to America.""

But I could forgive the unoriginality of the film if it could make me laugh. Sadly, the laughs were few. I spent most of my time wondering how the film was produced. It would have been better if there wasn't an attempt at an enduring plot, but rather an episodic plotting of American ignorance. And where the film could have delivered funny commentary (say, a consistent kind of reporting back to Kazakhstan about how Americans do this or that), it instead went for Jackass-style embarrassment of real people. Since this kind of ""humor"" clogs all contemporary media, I feel desensitized and therefore disinterested in it.

But really, I shouldn't be reviewing this film. I'm not of the intended audience. It was made for those who had a political awakening at a younger age than me. What seems boring and immature to me might actually tickle the funny bone of my younger siblings and my students. That's what getting old does to you. It separates you from the younger generation. The decision is to either embrace or reject this inevitability.

Perhaps some people will think I'm ""looking too deeply"" into this movie and expecting too much of it. If that's true, let's not pretend that this is the greatest comedy ever.

In the end, I didn't get much out of this film. What I did learn is that I have finally started getting old. I'm glad that I can go to a movie like Borat and be unable to enjoy its mediocrity. Most importantly, I'm glad that I didn't waste $17 on tickets.",1203811200,10,2112,4.5473684210526315

You have to admire Cohen's cajones (which are on view in more ways than one) as he goes above and beyond the call of duty in his determination to stay in character no matter how hostile the environment he's helped to create. It's pretty easy to spot the faked or partialy faked sequences - the friendly Jewish couple who rent them a room, the children at the ice cream truck, the Pamela Anderson finale - and most of the victims that aren't faked are more than deserving of their fate (the racist rodeo impresario, the frat boys) or handle themselves well (the feminists).

The film explores the darker sentiments of our nation, of the xenophobia, ignorance, and prejudice that still plagues us.

Perhaps America ought to wake up and take a good long look at itself....of course, when they see themselves, all they want to do is sue! Highly recommended for anyone who is open minded and can roll with the punches...and highly recommended for those who will be grossly offended so that maybe their prides and prejudices will be exposed.

While it is very possible to see Sasha Baron Cohen's characterization of a Kazakhstan immigrant offensive, I think it has a lot more to do with how Americans deal with people from other countries and their beliefs of people who live in them.  Cohen seems determine to get Americans to take a look at their prejudices whether they are out there in plain sight or hidden under the guise of ""tolerance"".  I do have complaints about how hard he leans on gay jokes which I believe he is uncomfortable with, and the naked fight scene goes on far too long and offensively.  Of course, that is what Cohen sees as his bread and butter - giving offense to everyone and everybody.  I guess that includes me because I was not immune.",1200182400,,866,4.415094339622642
2350981,5,6302078164,"The success of this film was a phenomenon, but when you see what Cohen suffered for his art - standing in the middle of 10,000 cowboys and parodying their American anthem and their prejudices (and almost getting lynched) is just one example, having his face stuck in the hairy backside of his fat Kazakhstani compatriot is another. And it is all thoroughly hilarious, almost throughout the entire film, it doesn't drag at any part and the fact that the staged scenes are almost impossible to distinguish between the many genuinely ad lib moments are a testament to his skill.

The question remains as to what exactly we are laughing at here? Is Third World backwardness or American ignorance the butt of the joke here?. If the latter, the success of the film across the Atlantic demonstrates a quite unforseen and admirable capacity of the Americans to laugh at themselves. Probably, in the post twin towers dillemma of reconciling Political Correctness and distaste at the cultural backwardness of some Islamic societies, Borat allows us to let off steam and laugh at the feared 'enemy' whilst legitimizing our laughter through simultaneously showng up our own fundamentalist prejudices and dogmas. And of these there are many, from Redneck anti-semitism to po faced Feminists utterly bewildered as to what to do when finally confronted with a male who has not been culturally castrated (to say the least).",1200009600,,1407,5.03862660944206

Since everyone else has analyzed this thing to death, I'll only ask one question:

Azamat: In the naked wrestling scene, where are his gonads? He is sans penis. I have watched the beginning a couple of times and I do believe that the ""woman"" who plays his short, fat nasty wife is Azamat. Azamat has female breasts and if you look close enough, I think a female actor was given a FX ""hair shirt"" and male balding pattern wig. The voices of the two characters are identical. Haven't read all 566 reviews, so if anyone knows some inside info, please clue us in. Azamat has been completely castrated otherwise.

2350985,4,6302078164,"Borat, a wild and sometimes almost completely out of control comedy, tells the fictional story of a news reporter named Borat Sagdiyev who travels from Kazakhstan to America to study American life. His government allegedly hopes to ""benefit"" from learning American ways. Of course, all this is merely a premise for a wacky comedy. We see Borat, played by Sacha Baron Cohen, traveling around the United States with his producer Azamat, making fun of them and sometimes driving them crazy with his Borat personality. The people he interviews, including a humor coach, feminists, a rodeo crowd and college students never knew that he was pulling their legs while they were making this film.

It's stunning at times how much the Americans, including the humor coach and the people at a society dinner, put up with the rather crude and obnoxious Borat. Borat has many ways of making people less than comfortable and catch them off their guard. For example, he actually walks up to men on the New York City subway and tries to kiss them on the cheek! Ay! Of course, some people paid a high price for being ""subjects"" of the Borat experience; we are all familiar by now of the lawsuits that people filed against Sacha Cohen because they were humiliated by him on camera. They never knew they'd be seen across the world on movie screens. That could be embarrassing!

Look also for a strong subplot: Borat sees Pamela Anderson on television and decides to run across the country, ""interviewing"" people, as he travels not just to understand Americans but also to trap Pamela Anderson into marrying him. Watch how this plays out when Borat eventually does meet Pamela!

This movie is not for sensitive people who insist on political correctness. Borat Sagdiyev is certainly very much a Jew hater (although in real life Sacha Cohen is very religious Jew); and Borat's views on women, romance, handicapped people and African American people aren't exactly politically correct. In fact, Borat's beliefs are mostly downright racist. The trick, to make the movie work as a comedy, is to take these bigoted views and expose them (and the Americans who become ensnared in Borat's ""little schemes"") in a way that is sure to get a laugh. In essence, Borat tries to be a modern day ""Archie Bunker"" who also makes fun of (and provokes) people by trying to kiss them on the cheek when they have never even seen him before.

The DVD comes with a plethora of deleted scenes; and the music ""infomercial"" was also very well done. We also get footage of Borat speaking to crowds, being interviewed on Late Night with Conen O'Brien and more!

The cinematography is great in the scenes with Borat and Pamela Anderson; and I liked the scenes back in Kazakhstan when Borat is preparing to go to America.

If you can take a joke, you will enjoy Borat. It's not for everyone; it's far from being politically correct but it should be OK once in a while to make fun of ourselves. After all, if Sacha Cohen, a devout Jew, can play the Jew-hating Borat, we ought to be able to laugh at ourselves, too. I will give this movie four stars and not five because there are some awfully controversial moments in the film; but I do recommend you see this.

How to show up this hypocrisy to those who aren't aware of this fact?  Turn the tables.  Make a film where EVERY gender, racial, economic group is offended and see who shouts loudest.  The result - heterosexual, white men were not offended in the least by attacks on their gender, which occurs in the film by making them look racist, sexist and stupid in the extreme.  This is because they are used to a similar level of heterosexual male abuse on any visit these days to a cinema.  No, its those who are normally completely protected by the unfair rules of PC who are up in arms.  It will be years to come before the genius of this film as a kind of social PC experiment is recognised.

Sorry, did not do anything for me, other than maybe -almost- cause the expulsion of my dinner through my mouth.
The biggest issue, here, is the fact that I was under the impression, throughout the whole movie, that Borat was a real person, and not a made up character by the same guy who does (sorry, can't stand him) ""Da Ali Show"". My impression did not change at the end of the movie, either.

The reason I strongly felt this way, is because I've been exposed to many different cultures in my life, also thanks to my dad's profession, growing up, and I've actually met middle-eastern people who shared  Borat's character, behaviour, and opinions on our western, Christian, definitely more civilized society. I was having deja-vu moments about all these middle eastern people I met years earlier. They actually are that way.

The ""movie"" itself is nothing but a disorganized pile of trivial situations, some so trivial I was grossed out to the point of debating whether I could even finish watching the movie.
I definitely fail to see any comedy in it, as I personally find the movie to be more real than actual scripted ""comedy"".
Offensive? You bet. But maybe this was the point Sacha Baron Cohen was trying to achieve, as I'm used to his ""Ali"" character's inability and unwillingness to relate to white people.

The movie's about a man who travels across America and meets different people and religions and does nothing but disrespects them the entire time.  It's all because he wants to go to California and have a relationship with Pamela Anderson.

The best way to respect the REAL people who actually had their feelings hurt during the recording of this film is to give it a low rating.  Sure, I laughed at a few parts, such as the bear in the ice cream truck scaring away children and the two naked men wrestling each other in the bedroom (in a very disgusting, almost sexual, way).  Still, everything about the movie was more about shocking the audience instead of delivering a satisfying story.  When the movie was finally released, many people found out they were involved in the film who didn't have a clue about it while the film was being made, and these people felt absolutely sick about the movie, and rightfully so.

One man going across America making fun of all the cultures and religions isn't funny to me.  People have a right to hate this movie with a passion.  Some people try to convince me Borat didn't mean to make fun of the people in the film, but the expression on his face that he's supposedly clueless when in fact he's actually knowledgeable about different cultures paints a more accurate picture.

Being funny means, in large part, being detached from everything good and bad - comedy is standing back long enough to admit error, fault, excess and contradiction that we cannot honestly talk about and face. Cohen does this better than 99% of the comedians out there.

As the character BORAT, Cohen has brought to light all the things our Western societies are most afraid to acknowledge. In fact, compared to BORAT most so-called ""comedy movies"" these days miss the point completely. BORAT is hilarious!!! By totally obliterating the boundaries of decency, and by highlighting the massive gap between what actual people espouse and what they really think - especially their prejudices - BORAT has done more than any other recent movie to revitalise the comedy genre.

But you need to have the taste for this kind of comedy - if you like movies like Austin powers, good chances are that you will like this movie, even though it is a of totally different kind.

2350994,1,6302078164,"Now, I'd heard Borat was crude, rude and lewd.  And funny, which it is. (But nowhere in the comedy ballpark of, say, ""Hotshots Part Deux"" or ""The Court Jester."")  But would it have broken the professional reviewers' typing hands to hint at just how raunchy this movie is?  Well, there were the feces jokes, the constant potty language, etc. some of which were funny.  There were revealing moments of Americana, such as the now-infamous frat boys ride Borat took.

What no one warned about were the scenes, filmed up close and personal from several vantage points, of Borat's fat pig of a manager setting his testicles and then his nude butt on Borat's face.  Jeez, even the maggots in Kazahkstan must have upchucked.  If you think that's hilarious, you must think a toilet is a laff riot.

But back to just the regular raunch.  As comical as many Americans showed themselves to be, I can't help but think how nastily Sacha Cohen (Borat) treated some of them.  Maybe they had it coming, for they surely must have smelled a rat, or at least a little mouse, when this purported foreign hick strolled up to them with a filming crew.

The many vignettes in this movie must have been largely staged, else Borat and his grotesque manager would have been in jail most of the time.  I've pointed out elsewhere too that some Amazon reviewers read too much into some of the supposedly revealing incidents in the movie.  The dinner party that Borat in every way undermined didn't break up because he brought a black woman to it, but because she was a whore.

The movie made me curious.  How much was staged?  And secondly, when an actor reads the script and sees that millions of people will watch his repulsively bloated, naked body running around hallways and bedrooms and sitting on top of the star's face, what does he think?  ""Better this than the bread line""?  ""Anything for art""?  ""Oh boy, will this ever pad my resume""?

His humor is sometimes awful - scatological,sexist and demeaning to other cultures- but when he draws laughs from these taboos, he makes the viewer also laugh at ones self by offering often unintentional paralells to the behavior being mocked.
Playing a fictional TV personality from Kazakhistan, Cohen uses a mixture of staged and real interviews of unsuspecting Americans who for the most part politely acommodate the guest in their nation. Playing on the good nature of most Americans, Cohen proceeds to shock by asking stupid and filthy questions of his hosts, all using the the persona of the out-of-place, backward but well-meaning foreigner.
Cohen mocks many attitudes of the developing world: paranoia of Jews, lack of respect for females, etc., but delivers also a look into America that shows regardless of how progressive the ""U S and A"" claims to be, we're more alike than different.

His comments about Jews are based on his culture. It would be like how people here want all the rebels in Iraq (the ""terrorists"") dead for simply defending their country. Looking at it from their point of view, or anyone else's, you can understand why Borat would take the position he does. In his culture it's okay to have sex with your sister, make fun of retards, treat women like garbage (though you can also say we do that here to some extent), and make fun of homo's. That's his culture, his way of life, and it just so happens that he is also a FICTIONAL character. The genius behind Sasha's character is that he's thrown into situations deemed by our culture as normal, but by his standards is much different and probably weird. Borat is trying to learn about us and how we think and act.

To call him racist or sexist is to judge him based on our ""elite"" standards. I agree, though, that all human beings should be treated with dignity and respect and no one should be ridiculed for their beliefs. The scene where Borat invites the ""escort"" to the uppity dinner is a perfect example of the ridiculous standards American people have. The guests (all religious tight-@$$es) were interested in Borat like one would be interested in some alien creature. But invite a black woman into their home and they all of a sudden ""have to be going."" It just shows the real raw nature of American people, ""elite-""American people, and how we simply judge everything and are really not sympathetic.

This was not always the case in this country, but I'm slipping into a historical rant about the problems with this country. The problems with this movie is that most people who don't get ""the joke"" are just embarrassed about seeing the way we really are. We're not as pure and clean and innocent and wholesome as we think.

The film follows Kazakhstan journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) on his journey across America. In addition to filming a documentary, Borat falls madly in love with Pamela Anderson after watching an old ""Baywatch"" rerun, and he desperately tries to get to California in order to make Pamela his wife so he can have ""the sexy time"" with her.

Yes, ""Borat"" can be pretty funny at times. How can you NOT laugh at a man traveling across the country in an ice cream van with a grizzly bear in the rear compartment? However, there are a lot of things in the film that cross the line in terms of poking fun at women, Jews, etc. I probably could have taken all that in stride, though, if not for all the other crude elements of this movie. All the jokes about rape and bestiality were really pushing it, but the nakedness proved to be too much for me, especially the much-talked about nude fight scene between Borat and his travel companion, Azamat (Ken Davitian). Watching the two of them chase each other through the hotel nearly blinded me for life.

Part of Borat's hilarity is that it matches our hunger for reality-show type interaction with candid camera type events and in doing so, exposes the bigotry of its unwitting cast.

The plot is almost beside the point, so I won't go over it in detail here.  Suffice it to say that Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is a journalist new to America from Kazakhstan, making a film with his producer Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian).  They film every experience, from Borat singing a national anthem at a rodeo to Borat hitching a ride with drunk frat boys, Borat running naked in a hotel to Borat attending classes on social etiquette.

Contrary to what the many lawsuits that arose from this film, most of the American citizens compose themselves admirably. Sure, there's the occasional bigoted jerk, but said jerks are easy to spot.  If you're shocked about a gun shop owner not blinking when Borat asks for a ""gun to kill a Jew"" then you haven't been to a gun shop.

And perhaps that's part of the humor.  Borat visits places we know exist in America but haven't been there ourselves, and it shows the worst and best we have to offer in typical American fashion...by pointing a camera at it.

But I don't buy it.

One of the key elements of a magician's art is deception.  The magician will tell you he has nothing up his sleeve, but he most certainly does.  People picked from the audience who supposedly don't know the magician are actually trained plants. In short, magicians lie and we believe them because we want to.

Similarly, Cohen's crafted a charade that this is all raw footage, and yet there's the omnipresent camera with its boom microphone and glaring lights. It's clear that the subjects, if they aren't in on the joke, are certainly pandering to the camera.  Until we invent floating invisible cameras or simply violate peoples' rights to make good television, this will always be the case.

Borat is rude, crude, and hilarious.  But the amount of navel-gazing it created on behalf of the nation due to its supposedly candid look at America is unwarranted.  In the tradition of our reality TV culture, Borat is as authentic as...well, reality TV shows.",1191628800,3,2267,4.69873417721519

I laughed too (I just happened to cringe more than I do at your standard hack and slash horror.)  There are a lot of uncomfortable moments, so beware.

Why a review of Borat when so much has already been written?

Because what I have yet to see mentioned in any review is that Borat the character is an Elizabethan court jester magically transported to the twenty-first century. Historically, court jesters up to the Renaissance were typically midgets spouting vulgarities. (Freud touches on this aspect of the development and rise of European court jesters in his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TOTEM-AND-TABOO/dp/B000PGYME4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TOTEM AND TABOO</a>.) But as the intellectual life of European courts intensified during the Renaissance, court jesters became more and more sophisticated comic powerhouses of Shavian wit who furthermore enjoyed blanket protection from their royal patrons. You fiddled with the fool at your peril. Renaissance fools were the short-lived but brilliant apogee of centuries of court humor, slowly dying out as a protected class after the reign of Henry VIII.

This modern comedy reprises all that is best in Shakespearean comedy. In the Shakespearean plays, the fools are what ground us to our own humanity. They cut through the guff, no matter how much guff there is, seeing through and past (or somehow ignorant of) ossified social conventions of what's ""normal"" and ""proper"". They are, in other words, the proverbial ""breath of fresh air"" that makes us smile and laugh. Indeed, the general judgment of the Fool is he is the smart one; it is we who are the real fools. Shakespeare's fools range from the brilliant (King Lear's court jester), to the wisely witty (Feste in Twelfth Night) to the merely witty (Touchstone in As You Like It) to the cowardly (Sir John Falstaff) to the truly benighted (Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing). Clearly Borat is a modern Dogberry.

If there is a ""law"" in Shakespeare's plays, it centers around the Fool. As long as the Fool is with you, as long as society tolerates the Fool, you are safe and society is healthy (or at least retains some measure of health). A society that tolerates the Fool is a society with hope and humor and self-knowledge. When the Fool vanishes, there is nothing left to halt the spread of hypocrisy and destructiveness: In other words, political correctness. The Fool is the one we can always rely on to tell us, ""The Emperor has no clothes"". Because in the final analysis, the Fool embodies Truth. And Truth is sustenance to every human soul. Borat the Fool is benighted but kind, and does us all a very great service by reminding us - even in the twenty-first century - that ""The Emperor has no clothes"".

Awesome comedy. But buyer aware, this is extremely off-color and degenerate stuff.",1188518400,4,2774,5.169265033407572

It was a very well made film.  I do, however, want to make it extremely clear that I found absolutely nothing in this movie to be offensive or shocking really.  I adore stereotypical humor.  I can also certainly see why a lot of people did find it to be so.  There were absolutely some very funny parts in this movie and I did laugh.  However, when so many people dub this as one of the funniest comedy in years I have to kind of wonder why.  As I was watching, Yakov Smirnoff kept coming to mind.  He was a relatively similar character, only not nearly as satirical and outlandish as the Borat character.  I guess I just have a weird sense of humor.

(although I am not sure about the second part ""mash"") where ""jakshi"" (yakhshi) in turkic (Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Azeri, Turkmen, Uzbek, Turkish etc.) languages means ""well, good"" and is probably used in greetings in those societies.

After the war, humor began to take itself seriously, particularly in the 60s with all these so-called brilliant comedians with college educations and axes to grind. Pure nonsense got lost along the way. Many of us have not forgotten, however, as evidenced by the continuing popularity of the Marx Brothers. Borat fits right in with that lovable family of goofs. Can't you just picture him there at the races with Harpo, Groucho, or Zeppo? The intelligence, of which he has plenty, is shown in his razor sharp satire. Oh, this goofiness should not be interpreted as stupidity. He's brilliant. He's a genius. He's sees a lot, and in this short film succeeds in showing as much about America that is true and deeply revealing as any of the serious dramas that incite rave reviews. Borat falls in with Harpo Marx and Forrest Gump as a lovable moron whose innocence is crucial for exposing the lies and hypocrisy of Americans, especially those who claim to be ""good,"" ""honest,"" or ""proper."" Borat is all about pulling the curtain aside to show everybody that the Wizard is a humbug.",1186790400,,1203,4.844660194174757

By looking at its ratings on IMDB.com and other websites, it was supposed to be one of the funniest movies of 2006.  I was wholly disappointed.  As a minority, and someone who appreciates good racial and ethnic jokes, I found this movie's comedy to be a haphazard mix of derogatory, old-hat or just plain disgusting.  Much of the humor featured in this film has been included in older movies.  For example, the notion of Borat going from his backwards, ignorant, rural village in Kazakhstan to the wonders and cosmopolitanism of New York City is a storyline with too much play already.  The Beverly Hillbillies mastered this situational backdrop decades ago without the overt illusions to incest and personal violence made in this movie.  As another example, when Borat first enters his hotel room in NYC, he unknowingly refreshes himself with water from the toilet bowl.  A similar scene was used 20 years ago in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures in regards to the Mongol warrior.  The underwear scenes were also quite old as similar tricks have been used in old SNL skits and the movie Zoolander.  Even the bungled singing of the National Anthem by Borat seems to reminisce Roseanna Barr's blasphemy in front of a MLB game in the early 1990s.

There were occasional, original funny scenes, such as the bear Borat adopts to defend themselves.  But these few scenes were drowned out by the quantity of jokes in poor humor.  This DVD does not feature much beyond the movie, and the labels of the different special features were hard to comprehend.  All in all, a waste of time and money.",1186531200,,1662,4.765734265734266

I assume that the people behind the movie have achieved what they set out to achieve.  People love it or they hate it, but the movie was talked about, quoted, merchandised, etc...

The movie was certainly funny and, on it's own, I would give it four stars, but I feel that the level of humor was a step down from the original skits on Da Ali G Show.  Having to follow a storyline often has this effect on skits-turned-comedies.  Normally, we would see Borat set out to interview someone or sit in with some group in an attempt to learn of the American way.  The skit would hit you hard with laughs and then it was back to Bruno or Ali G...  The movie does suffer, somewhat, due to the need to adhered, even loosely, to a storyline.

Anti-semitism is not contained to Kazakhstan, of course; and racism and misogyny are everywhere; what better way to expose this by pretending to be from another country and do it in a truly hilarious fashion? Most of the people in this were not real actors, and two of the ""scholars"" tried to sue. My favorite scene is the rodeo scene, which features a real gay-hater jackass in charge of it, and a National Anthem sure to please anybody who is sick about our illegal, immoral war started by our current tyrant in charge. It is hilarious! Other highlights include the Midnight Cowboy parody/montage; Borat's choices of what to yell at a car while being tought how to drive; and his meeting of some young black men, who teach him culturally. His obsession is ""Pam-ela"" Anderson, and the ending is just perfect. There are those who consider this a ""gross-out"" film, due to some scenes (and granted, it has surely one of the grossest nude scenes I've ever seen), but it is far more than that. It is both a hilarious film and a great commentary about and against the bigotry in our country, in our world. (Hey, Blazing Saddles kinda paved the way for this,wouldn't you say?).Most importantly, it IS so funny you'll laugh your head off. The packaging is brilliant, very clever; the bonus footage is, for the most part, great (excepting an Andy Kaufman-like bit on Cheese); and Kokibuchuck is referenced!

Boy, are Americans dumb. One of the rodeo officials advises Borat to shave so he won't look like a terrorist. Boy, are Americans racist. Or maybe Borat was just selective in who he chose to film.

And he speaks blatantly offensively to policemen, politicians, street gangs, and worst of all, to organized feminists. I know I could not come within a million miles of doing any of that.

This not usually my type of movie, the huge success of it was a clear consequence of all the propaganda and publicity surrounding it (which by the way is included as bonus material in this DVD release), I was a little reluctant to watch it at the movie theaters and I waited to watch it on DVD.

Man I loved this film, the ""innocence"" of the character may be funny to a lot of people, but that is precisely what Sacha Baron Cohen used as a mean to get the worst of the people interacting with him, by provoking everyone surrounding him while pretending to be an innocent character from Kazakhstan, many of the more bizarre lines in this film come from the people around him and not Borat himself. This of course generated a lot of legal problems when the film was released that did nothing but give the movie more publicity than the one it already had.

I still find it hard to believe he was able to leave the rodeo after insulting all the people in the place, there are lots of situations in which Borat does nothing but set the situation for people to show what they really think or believe (a police officer tells him to be ready to be stopped in his van lots of times because of his appearance, when Borat asks why, the officer simply replies ""that's the way it is in America"")

I am not saying of course this is a serious film, it can be outrageous, disgusting, but funny in the end. This release contains deleted material that I believe could have been better that some things that were left in the film (check out the employee at the convenience store when he tries to explain that in America there can be many different types of cheese and also see Borat trying to buy a dog to have ""sexy time"" and then eat it)

It also includes a section for ""Global Propaganda"" that contains interviews with Connan O Brien, Saturday night Live and Jay Leno with Martha Stewart (my personal favorite) It is also funny to see the way Borat thanks Michael Moore at a film festival when he tries to thank him. Another bonus material to be found is the bizarre music infomercial (advertising the music from Kazakhstan) released on the web to promote the film.

  Borat basically mocks all his characters attributes: antisemitism, sexism, lack of etiquette, etc. An interesting trivia note is when Borat is speaking Kazakh, he's really speaking Hebrew with some Polish thrown in.

His work here completely solidifies his reputation, and I look forward to him finding more work in Hollywood. Perhaps, like with Jim Carrey, they'll build entire films around his presence which would suit this fan just fine. It sounds like they're on the road to doing so as I read he's making a movie with Johnny Depp and I know he played a character in Talladega Nights. As for Borat, it is a magnificent film and I highly recommend it; although, it certainly isn't something that you can see over and over again. Its humor is all of the ""embarrassment"" variety so it goes down with the jolt and thrill of a shot of Maker's Mark. You do feel very bad for the average citizen who finds his or her self unintentionally lampooned. One aspect of it I loved in particular was the interaction between Borat and his producer. With the suit and short tie he was a 100 percent sterling imitation of a Soviet Union bureaucrat. Every time I saw that guy I laughed.  I must disagree over the anti-Semitism charges as Borat's posing as an anti-Semite created the situation in which people could then speak more freely. Borat is also fun to laugh at and laughing at him also allows for the satirization of those who hold the same offensive views. We know that Jews don't run our nation or are a force of evil so it's quite natural, and healthy, to laugh at those fools who think otherwise. There's no Jew baiting here in my opinion.

The genius of this movie is to bring a cross section of America into the public spotlight via one man's innocent adventure across the United States to capture the American Dream (Pamela Anderson) only to discover not only a hostile citizenry and disillusionment with his perceptions of said dream (the dreaded sex tape between Anderson and Lee) and how the system keeps him from it. Too many people have taken this movie way too seriously. This is a comedy, a satire, a farce.

Borat, Borat. I kept hearing how funny and great this little film was so I finally rented it. I have to say that maybe the first 20 minutes keeps your interest, but it gets slow, less funny, and tedious as it goes on.

Sacha Cohen is great at creating a unique character but the overall plot is very lacking. Basically, you have Borat coming to America to learn about their customs and mocking his country's.

The jokes of rape and sex, et al, grow very tiring at times, as that seems to be the extent of Borat's character.

The supporting cast leaves a lot to be desired and is very forgettable.

This is not a movie to watch with family or to watch as a date movie as you'll probably offend any reasonable female within view of the television screen.

Definately a guy movie and this comes from a guy.

2351107,4,6302078164,"I think the main reason I hate ultra-offensive films is the film makers usually lack the talent to make any jokes besides offensive ones.  I think Borat is different though.  Although offensive jokes run consistently thoughout the movie, Borat shows the capability to pull off other kinds of humor as well.  In one scene he's shown riding in a car to go off to America, and when the camera zooms out, we see that the car is actually being pulled by a horse and buggy.  Then there's a scene where Borat sings his country's national anthem at a rodeo and upsets the entire patriotic audience.  And all through the movie Borat's broken English alone is enough to make me chuckle.

When Borat isn't ultra-offensive, it switches to being just plain silly.  Its like a combination of a Mel Brook's movie with MTV's Jackass.

Like I said, I usually can't find a way to enjoy comedies that advertise themselves as low-brow and crude, but I must admit I found Borat's total disregard for political correctness to be very refreshing.

He was telling us about how funny this movie was and even showed us clips on Youtube.  So when I finally get around to seeing it on DVD, all I can say is what was all the fuss about?

The DVD is mostly bathroom humor, candid camera and a few sight gags.  He goes around filming this ""documentary"" for his homeland, and acts goofy and sees how people react.  Some parts were funny, especially their fear of Jews, and how they portray them, and there were some sight gags if you caught them, like his producer telling him their bear got away, and later seeing the bear's head in the refrigerator in the background.

Borat is a reporter in his country, Kazakhstan.  Borat and his producer, Azamat go to America to make a documentary on American culture.  This is where things go awry and hilarious.  Borat just cannot understand why people do not do certain things and is puzzled when they ""bared their teeth"".  For example, the 2 quick pecks on the cheeks when greeting is the traditional custom for Borat.  However, Americans resist that particular kind of greeting.

Borat cracked me up when he meets diverse Americans, such as gays, Blacks, the upper class, prostitutes, Pamela Anderson and Jews.  What was even more hilarious was when Borat catches Azamat using the Pamela Anderson book as a stimulation for self-pleasure, Borat goes ballistic.  They wrestle in the nude and run out to a conference hall chasing.

Now, *Borat* isn't funny every single seconds.  There were a couple that were worthy of a half-chuckle.  It did have a couple of short slow or dry moments.  Other than that, *Borat* was consistent with humor throughout.

2351140,5,6302078164,"You've heard about it, you've read about it, and by now you have probably seen it. Borat, the legendaery comedy movie starring our friend from Eastern Europe, has two purposes, to shock you and make you laugh your heiny off.

In all seriousness, only a Jewish person could get away with a movie like this. If a non-Jew were to make these kinds of jokes, this film would have probably never seen the light of day. Much like a black stand-up comedian who has a license to say N****r, Borat can show an oversized female Jewish character laying an egg and then having children crush it. This is the kind of humor that politicians in America have to ignore. If anyone caught them laughing, they would be run out of town.

I am not saying this film will be funny for everyone. Maybe not everyone likes to see a 300 pound, hairy and disgustingly obese man run around naked, getting bit on the teet, and having his massive bare buttocks slamming down on another man's face, but when you buy a ticket on the Borat Express, you got to stay on for the ride until the end.

To me this film was refreshing. In a time when over-budget, A-list star movies leave you wanting more, Borat looks and feels much more like an independent film. I sincerely hope that one of the reasons this film was made was to strike Hollywood where it hurt. You can make a funny and entertaining movie without a billion dollars. I only wish Borat had a derogatory joke about Steven Spielburg, but insulting the most successful director of all time (and a fellow Jew), well maybe even Borat has his limits.

I personally enjoyed every part of this movie. Some of my favorite scenes were the yard sale (""I come to collect your tears Gypsy""), the hotel room wrestling match (""How dare you make hand party with my Pam-eel""), and of course the village (""Dis is my sister, she is number 4 prostitute in all Khakistan""). I am not running for office and I have no need to be PC. This movie made me laugh out loud several times. From the driving lesson to the dinner on Secede Ave. From the rodeo to the gun store (""What is best gun to kill a Jew?""). This film is something I can watch again and again.

The only thing I did not understand was the Pamela Anderson part. Right before he turned on Baywatch, a scene of Married with Children came on. Peg Bundy (Katey Sagal) was the sexiest woman to ever sashay across a TV screen. If I was Borat I would have wnet after her in a heartbeat.

In one of the first scenes, when Borat says ""I like sex. It is nice."", you get a pretty good prelude to what is to follow.

This is politically incorrect, tasteless, offensive and crass humour, to put it mildly. However, despite myself, I had to admit that Borat was pretty cool guy and that Cohen is a much braver man than I. Offending everyone from driving instructors, rodeo managers and audiences, passengers on trains, people in the street and etiquette coaches, ""Borat"" really is ""in-your-face"" humour.

The basic premise of the movie is Borat's journey to the ""US and A"" to find out about that great country so as to improve his native Kazakhstan. Along the way, he falls in love and travels across the entire country to find the woman of his dreams. I still wonder that he didn't get pounded into a pulp by the security.

Despite all the rudeness, I was very surprised that there was a bit of a sensitive side to the movie as well, between Borat and Luenell. It was a nice little message, if somewhat cliched and corny.

In short, this movie is not for everyone. If sexual references and nudity are not your thing, I would avoid this one like the bubonic plague. Would I see it again? No. However, I am glad that I have seen it. Some parts were genuinely funny, and others made me cringe. However, it was good and fun.",1179360000,,1493,4.498154981549815

2351217,5,6302078164,"Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen takes one of his many creations onto the road across America and ends up making one of the biggest movies of 2006. I would never have believed it was possible in a million years. I was never a huge fan of his TV show or particularly, Ali G, one of his many zany characters. For various reasons, I decided not to go see it when it was out in the cinemas and really wasn't going to check it out at all but there's been such a furore, in the end, I just had to get the DVD to see what all the fuss was about.

I guess I can see it now. One minute jaw-droppingly awful, the next minute so hysterically funny I had to keep pausing the DVD to wipe the tears from my eyes, Cohen has taken a huge risk, touched a cultural nerve and struck gold. (Over $230 million worldwide, to be exact).

He makes complete fools out of a lot of people (including the po-faced, the uninformed and those too kind to say anything for fear of seeming disrespectful to this apparent innocent from the developing world), without them actually realising he's doing it and while I accept that he doesn't seem to care who he offends, in my opinion, anyone who take offence to anything in this particular movie has missed the point of it altogether. Directed in 'mockumentary' style by Larry Charles of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" fame, I can only guess that the people 'Borat' comes across do not have HBO.

I don't think I've laughed so much in one sitting in a long time. I'm not entirely convinced it would stand up to repeated viewing but I definitely believe that anyone who hasn't seen this movie will enjoy seeing it at least once.

Borat is a movie that I found both wildly hysterical, but also utterly tastless too. In my opinion this film could have been great if they had just excluded some of the totally unneccessary and offensive material. The movie had such a funny premise to begin with, but the writers almost ruined the script by choosing to go for the cheap laughs.

One incredibly offensive scene that stands out far above the rest, is the naked fight scene at the hotel. I don't know about other reviewers here, but I didn't find that scene funny at all. On the contrary, I found it outrageous and completely disgusting! It's hard to believe they could find two actors willing to be in a scene like that.

If you can get past some the offensive material in Borat, it's actually a very funny and original movie. The film had the potential to be so much more, maybe even a comedy classic, but sadly it's not.

I saw this in theaters and thought it was funny but as i said i still like the show better.  As far as being shocking, i was not personally offended or shocked.  Basically in movies you can have peoples' heads blown off and bodies torn to pieces and still get a Pg-13 rating, but if you say the F word or show a breast it gets an R rating.
As far as the really negative reviews it seems as if people are madd at the movie and wrote reviews with a thesaurus and dictionary on hand to incorporate every large word into their review.  I think the movie was actually smart and the show smarter basically it makes fun of the close minded, judgemental, conservative, and uptight people in our society, by making them look bad by using a ridiculous character to bring out their ugly side.  In a way it's theraputic to see these people that judge everyone to be mocked i mean these are the everyday people not putting on blinkers in traffic, talking on the cell phones while driving and driving bad, people that work a register and don't say thank you or welcome, that push their views on other people, people that basically are oblivious to their surroundings but are able to annoy everyone else, where maybe sometimes ignorance is bliss but in the show and in this movie we get to laugh at them instead of honking our horns at them.

I liken the hype machine of this movie to the same people who did 'Napoleon Dyaminte'.

2351235,5,6302078164,"Firstly, I have never laughed so hard watching a movie.  For that alone, I'll give it five stars.  There are elements of ""Borat"" that I was uncomfortable with; but, to the extent it makes some people look bad (for instance, the cowboy who denigrated Arab people), they were simply having their bigotry exposed.  At other times, Sacha Cohen is using his own Borat character to mock a variety of regressive attitudes.

This film not only brought out some ugly attitudes of Americans, but also showed some of our kindness - such as the patience that many people showed toward Borat and his antics.

And while some reviewers were disgusted by the naked battle Borat had with his producer, by the time that struggle entered the meeting of business professionals, I had tears in my eyes.

It was revealing to see the contrast in treatment Borat received in New York City when he tried to greet people with a kiss on the cheek (threats of violence and fear), versus the love he received at the Gay Pride Parade in D.C.

There are ways in which this film undercuts the carefully crafted image of ""brand America"" that many people here and abroad have uncritically accepted.  It also takes a jab at the US ""war OF terror"" - which, is more accurate than the term ""war ON terror.""  The synchronicity of the US flag-bearing horse and rider tumbling over during the Kazakhstan ""national anthem"" was amazing.

After seeing this movie, I purchased the first season of the HBO program ""Da Ali G Show"" which inspired the movie.  I didn't enjoy Ali G so much.  Cohen definitely turned it up a notch for the film.  However, I was delighted to discover an Ali G interview of Noam Chomsky on YouTube.

To look more deeply at this film and the controversy, I'd suggest the Wikipedia write-up of Borat.",1177113600,2,1778,4.638977635782748

By any aesthetic, this movie was so repulsive as to cause an aversion to ever seeing Sasha Baron Cohen in anything ever again.

You do not want to be eating when Borat and his producer get into a fight sans trousers because the producer was 'making hand party' on a Pamela Anderson magazine.  There is no redeeming social value in a naked, hiruste, over-weight man 'making hand party', or fighting with a naked, skinny, hirsute man.",1177027200,12,778,4.561151079136691

2351238,3,6302078164,"I must say that I'm a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's ""Da Ali G Show,"" and have enjoyed it for some time now.  Borat was fun to watch as he made his way through the United States looking for people to agitate, disgust, anger, etc.  However, in this film, ""Borat:  Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,"" Cohen runs the comedy well dry.  The scripted moments of this film were the weakest points in the movie.  **SPOILERS**  The incident with the bear, the bickering with his producer, and the lonely nights pining for Pamela Anderson were lukewarm at best.  I will say that the celebrated ""naked fight"" is very, very funny and is actually a highlight of the film.  However, Cohen is at his best when he confronts people in candid moments.  Be it at a church service, in the company of drunken frat boys, or at the dinner table, Cohen knows how to get funny (or at least brutally honest) responses from those he encounters.  These types of interactions show just how cruel, ignorant, kind, proud, forgiving, or oblivious people can be when put into certain situations.

**End Spoilers**

The film itself is okay, but it's nothing more than an overdone ""Borat"" skit that is best taken in small doses.  The DVD provides a few deleted scenes (some of the best being with the numerous police officers that Borat interacts with). It also includes a report on the Borat incident at a rodeo and a few other things that neither add to or take away from the film.

If you're familiar with Borat already and enjoy his antics, consider this a strong rental.  If you're easily offended, don't bother.  Overall, ""Borat"" is a funny film that has equal parts hilarity and unfunny idiocy in it.  Even though I'm a fan of the TV series, I have no plans on purchasing this DVD.  Rent it before you buy it, folks.",1176940800,,1827,4.58641975308642
2351239,3,6302078164,"""Borat"" is as politically incorrect and tasteless, etc. as others have stated, but my predominant take on it overall is that it offers proof positive that a man in this country can be just about as obnoxious as he chooses and get away with it, especially if said man is one very long drink of water like Cohen. The possible exception here would be in NYC, since New Yorkers can be quick (and in this case, correct) to assign boundaries to those who have none (Borat). And you thought the character wanted to head west just to hook up with Pamela Anderson... No - methinks he was seeking better opportunities to exploit others.

I'm as eager to expose bigots as anyone, but these so-called attempts largely fall flat and don't ring true at all. OK; the rodeo guy was a jerk but big deal. Even the frat boys were much ado about nothing. I mean, since when do drunken pack/party animals NOT talk trash, for crying out loud?!

And beyond that, most of the people that Borat/Cohen sought to browbeat/humilate were very gracious/patient at coping with increasingly imposing and frightening situations. As for the attempts to ""prove"" pervasive anti-Semitism, how can a single individual be expected to overtly take on a towering, unpredictable crackpot? Sure the gunseller failed to challenge Borat's ""views""; but he didn't sell him a gun, either.

In essence, the whole package of ""Borat"" is just one big chicanery; one which snowballs and will reap ever larger profits as the lawsuits and publicity continue. Have you purchased your ""My Sister is #4 Prostitute  in Kazakhstan"" T-shirt yet?",1176940800,2,1584,4.855555555555555

2351241,3,6302078164,"Although superficially this mockumentary would seem to be a satire of the people of Kazakhstan or the citizens of any country thereabouts, it is really a satire of America the beautiful.  Surprise!  It makes some good points and there are some laughs.  Mostly though I think the average viewer would be grossed out about half the time.  But that's okay.  For the average movie-goer or DVD watcher, getting grossed out is a lot better than being bored.

Of course you might be bored too.  Personally I don't think I could watch the naked mock fight between Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitan) again.  I wasn't so much grossed out as made to feel that really I ought to find better ways to waste my time.

Yes, we're bored in America.  Our neurons are sated with violence, pornography, and crude, boorish behavior toward our fellows (both real and on TV and in the movies).  Which is why, to be successful, people like Sacha Baron Cohen have to turn up the crude volume to get the old laugh-o-meter activated.  A glimpse of stocking used to be looked on as something shocking, now, heaven knows, anything goes.

But should we care?  Yes, your preteen sons are going to find out who in the neighborhood has this DVD and they're going to watch it.  Will they be scarred for life?  Will they ""get it""?  Will it make them uncouth?  Will they watch it more than half a dozen times?

One of the interesting things about this movie is the publicity it got and the controversy it engendered.  Kazakhstan initially was greatly offended and protested loudly at this misrepresentation of its people.  But then they thought it over and realized that maybe this isn't necessarily such a bad thing.  In Hollywood any publicity is good.  They probably figured out that what is being made fun of is the average American's provincial attitude toward foreigners.  Cohen goes a long way toward proving that with the scene at the rodeo, for example, where his line, ""We support your war of terror!"" gets a nice round of applause.  And the guy who thinks that somebody with a moustache looks like a Muslim who looks like a terrorist adds a little to the impression that Americans, when they think about foreigners, think superficially.

Actually, they don't do any real thinking.  Xenophobia reigns supreme in the heartland--but that would be the heartland of any country.  The frequent anti-Semitic shtick throughout was originally aimed at Europeans, I understand, who despite the embarrassment of the Holocaust are apparently as anti-Semitic as ever.  But Cohen, who is Jewish, makes fun of the antisemitism of Muslims as well as Westerners.  And he makes fun of the uneducated and uncouth as well as the superficially sophisticated--witness the scene at the Magnolia Fine Dining Society.

Some people sued or threatened to sue.  Some guys from the University of South Carolina who were caught off guard and drunk, mouthed some stupidities for all of the world to hear.  They sued but lost the case, I understand.

Larry Charles of TV's Seinfeld fame directed.  He achieved some tension with the simple plot of Borat coming to American and making a road trip across the land to California to meet and hopefully mate with Pamela Anderson.  That was pretty funny.  I understand that some of the scenes were staged and scripted, for example the book signing scene with Miss Anderson was at least partly staged.  But other scenes were play-as-you-go with Cohen just making up stuff and saying provocative things to get reactions from the innocents.  The scene in the bathroom with the woman from the Magnolia Fine Dining Society was pretty funny as she explains to Borat so seriously and so sincerely how to wipe himself.

Bottom line here is, should you bother to watch?  My answer: maybe if you can stand the crudities, and maybe if you don't squirm at satire directed at Americans.  On the other hand, this is not in my opinion in the same league as some other famous comedic movies.  Certainly it is not nearly as good as Blazing Saddles (1974), which I was watching the other night.  Finally, the techniques used by Cohen and Charles are interesting in their own right because of the reaction of people who were taken in, or somewhat taken in, and so that they ended up saying some outrageous and embarrassing things.",1176681600,3,4321,4.796747967479675
2351242,2,6302078164,"I know that I am probably in the minority in my opinion of this movie.  This is my 50th Amazon review, and I generally only review goods, books or movies that I really like because I want to help shed some light on them for other people.  Only one other time was I moved to give a negative review to something.  I will preface my review by saying that it comes from a very personal place.

As an artist myself, I think artists' efforts should be celebrated.  I'm also all for artistic freedom. However, although I found much to like in this movie, on balance I found it to be just excessively vulgar.  I like satire and I appreciated the fact that BORAT exposes elements of sexism and racism and almost every other kind of ""ism.""  I especially appreciated the commentary on America's hyper-patriotism.

But I thought the movie just went too far in its vulgarity and, as such, may be doing more harm to our society than good.  We already live in a society where crudeness is rewarded by big money (Don Imus, Howard Stern).  This in itself is a problem.  Within that context, I find myself wondering why BORAT had to push the envelope so much:  I just didn't think it needed to.  So much of it was very, very funny:  the running of the Jews, the scenes with the humor coach and the feminists, the scene where Borat is buying the car and is looking for a p*s** magnet.  But other scenes are just too over the top:  the nude wrestling match, the photograph of a [...], the [...] scene--why does the movie need these?  For shock value?  I am perplexed, truly.

I also am a little concerned that many people won't understand that this is a satire.  There is a fine line between attacking social conventions with humor and condoning those social conventions.  I think this distinction is not always clear in BORAT.

It does pain me to say these things, because there is much to like in BORAT.  But we live in such a social climate of crass vulgarity these days that I find myself disappointed in the movie ultimately because I think it may be contributing to a climate of shallowness and an attitude of ""anything goes.""  Many of my friends and colleagues like this movie, but I am troubled by it, and I think the maker of the film could have made better choices.",1176681600,13,2255,4.430656934306569
2351243,4,6302078164,"This is a creative and funny film that is simply not for everyone, as it contains material that is bound to offend someone. It is a quasi mockumentary, cinema verite style flick. Sasha Baron Cohen plays the character of Borat Sagdiyev, a journalist from the eastern European, third world country of Kazakhstan.

Borat travels to the United States to learn American culture and film his experiences in order to bring back his new found knowledge to the masses in Kazakhstan. Along his journey, he interacts with real people with hilarious and eyebrow raising consequences. Borat always stays in character, which means he is alternately offensive and ignorant. Some of the Americans with whom he interacts raise a few eyebrows themselves.

There are moments in the film are simply startling and totally outrageous. Others are even amazingly funny. There certainly are scenes in the film that rise to the level of social commentary, while others are simply sophomoric. Still, the film cannot help but entertain those who view the film without pre-conceived notions.

The movie starts its racist juvenile course by making fun of another culture (am I supposed to laugh at how stupid those Eastern Europeans are?) and continues in that vein by making fun of unsuspecting Americans. I don't think it's comedy when it comes at the expense of making others look foolish as a result of trickery. Yes we have some pretty misguided bigoted people in this country and I certainly don't sympathize with their politics but their tolerance of Borat the idiot was remarkable (and typically American). The fact that Gays and Feminists are also ridiculed is indicative of the film's agenda which is to be as crass as possible and totally disrespectful of people who are different from 'the accepted norm.'. Those who laugh at other peoples' peculiarities and cultural or religious differences are just as intolerant as the target of their ridicule, setting themselves up as somehow superior, and we all know where that leads in any society.

Besides all that, the slapstick just was not funny relying on crude themes  with no craftsmanship (compare with the best of the best John Cleese in Fawlty Towers, Monty Python, Stephen Colbert, Tracy Ullman, Lewis Black and Tom Sharpe).",1176595200,14,1286,5.0046728971962615
2351255,4,6302078164,"The pseudo-documentary ""Borat"" resembles nothing so much as a ""Candid Camera"" episode on crack.  Like Allen Funt, the originator of the format, Sacha Baron Cohen - along with his co-writers, Anthony Hines, Peter Baynham and Dan Mazer and director Larry Charles - generates laughs by tricking unsuspecting people into making complete and utter fools of themselves on camera.  Only, in this case, Cohen ventures much further into the realms of vulgarity and crudeness than Funt could ever have imagined or the television censors of his time would ever have permitted.

As embodied by Cohen, Borat is a fictional character who hails from the very real West Asian country of Kazakhstan.  Convinced that he can learn some valuable lessons from the West that he can then bring back and share with his own people, Borat says goodbye to his impoverished village and heads to the United States to experience first hand the accoutrements of American culture.  The film chronicles the many absurd encounters he has with the folks he meets, mainly in Middle America, as he wends his way westward across the continent in search of his dream girl, Pamela Anderson.

Some of the ""skits"" the filmmakers have come up with are sidesplitting and hilarious, some merely amusing, and others downright offensive (and all the funnier for being offensive, I might add).  The movie is least successful when it breaks away from the strict ""Candid Camera"" formula and shows us Borat on his own, out of sight of anyone not in on the joke, still carrying on the fiction.  In other words, the more ""scripted"" the movie appears, the less authentic it feels.  It should also be noted that there are times when one gets the impression that the people on whom the deception is being played are not quite as ignorant of the ruse as they appear to be, primarily because the placing of the camera often feels illogical if the spontaneity were truly real and genuine.  The one element that made ""Candid Camera"" utterly believable was that it was careful to keep the camera completely hidden throughout the course of the bit.  Here we wonder why it takes people so long to realize that they are indeed the target of a colossal joke (a prime example is when the old Jewish couple is walking up the stairs to bring food to the visiting Borat and the camera is filming them from OUTSIDE the room rather than sticking with Borat and his cohort within).

However, what gives the movie its gravitas and heft, and takes it far beyond the level of mere ""Jackass""-type gimmickry is how Cohen manages to use his shtick to expose the bigotry and xenophobia that lie just beneath the surface of a certain segment of American society.  Yet, one should also point out that quite a number of these people are actually more tolerant and indulgent of Borat's inane antics than one might except any reasonable person to be (or than we ourselves might be if we were put in a similar situation).  Indeed, there's a certain cruelty to the film in that the individuals and groups he is mocking are actually treating him rather nicely at times.  The audience is allowed to feel superior to the people on screen in a way that might not be entirely justified.  ""Candid Camera"" always seemed innocent and harmless in its intentions; ""Borat"" definitely does not, which is both the strength and the weakness of the film.

Still, love him or loathe him, one cannot help but sit back and admire the sheer courage and chutzpah Cohen displays in placing himself in what are, in actuality, some pretty hairy situations.  That he isn't ridden out of town on a rail, the outraged citizenry chasing close behind him with torches ablaze, is, perhaps, the most astonishing aspect of the movie.  It's the bald-faced audacity with which Cohen throws himself into his work - rather than the quality of the individual sketches themselves - that ultimately makes ""Borat"" so much fun to watch.",1176508800,2,3910,4.791666666666667
2351256,4,6302078164,"Okay, let me start with this statement....as other reviewers have said, this film is NOT FOR EVERYONE.  Its not politically correct but it is VERY FUNNY.

Borat, a reporter from his native land of Kazakhstan, is sent, along with his short, chubby producer Azamat, to the U. S. to explore American culture.

In New York, after watching an episode of ""Baywatch"", Borat falls for Pamela Anderson and decides he must cross the country to find his beloved lifeguard in California.  Along the way, Borat encounters dozens of people with various and hilarious outcomes.  Whether its a nude wrestling match between Azamat and Borat, hitching a ride with racist and sexist frat boys or his ""marriage"" attempt with Anderson, you are bound to bust a gut at some point in this film.

Finally, don't skip on the deleted scenes.  There are six of them and all of them (other than the ""cheese"" one) are very funny too.  Borat's trip to the animal shelter and massage therapist are priceless.

I loved the show on HBO.  It is like my favorite.

I found this movie to lack that bite I was looking for.

It was like old jokes from the TV show.

I guess this movie is for people who like The Family Guy.  Kind of dumb and like to eat chicken all day long, with grease all over their lips and other dumb stuff.

I walked out.  Not becasue it was offensive.

Because it wasn't funny.  Not like the TV show.

Total let down.

And it was kind of scary.  The auidence was just eating it up. Why?

I felt alone in the world.

Scared.

It wasn't funny.

Maybe if you haven't seen the TV show, you may have liked it.

I guess check that out and you'll see what I'm talking about.

America, America....

Whew....

If there was one piece of genius in this movie, it would have been watching America watch it.

2351277,5,6302078164,"This rating falls into two subcategories...the movie itself, and the DVD presentation.

The Movie (5 stars):

""Borat"" tests racial, social, political and cultural boundaries like no film has.  This feature is not for people who have trouble stomaching alternate viewpoints or tense situations.  Most importantly, the viewer must be able to accept personal criticism, because that is what ""Borat"" is all about.  It has the capability to piss you off, make you hide your eyes and laugh until your sides hurt.  No matter how this film affects you, the one thing you'll feel when it's over is like you've been on a roller coaster.  If you're a coaster type of person, this is your film.  If you prefer to stand and watch, take a pass.

The DVD (4 stars):

The extra scenes were just as entertaining as the movie itself.  Unfortunately, when I opened the DVD case, I couldn't help but be a bit deflated by the lack of anything paper-based to check out.  It's simply a one-page doc, with the DVD.

If there was a tiny guffaw in the scene, it occurred in the first 15 seconds - several minutes later there was no reason for it to still be going on - but it was. Not only is this scene not suitable for childeren, it's not suitable for you mother, father, wife, husband, or even somebody you don't like. Sometimes gross can be funny, crass is just crass.

Then the movie follows ""Borat"" and his friend ""Azamat"" on a road trip through the U.S. The movie is not that long - less than an hour and a half.

If you have seen movies with gross sexual or bathroom humor you haven't seen anything yet. This has got to be the most far out movie I have seen. I thought sometimes they went too far. In one scene in Birmingham, Alabama, Borat uses the restroom. He comes back with his stool in a bag. It was absolutely disgusting. If I was sitting on that dinner table I would have thrown up.  Scenes such as that, or when he is ""relieving himself"" on a New York street or he has a naked fight with his friend are disgusting.

I would give this movie three stars because it is very original.  There are some nice parts like when ""Borat"" apologizes to the woman who was not able to eat dinner in the Birmingham, Alabama home.  When Borat talks during a ballgame on the ""War On Terror"" that is a good scene also.  Seeing how Americans act in the NY subway and the frat boys (he is being sued by them also) talk was good.

Some want to put it on a pedestal as a brilliant political comedy that pokes fun at America, while others simply lambast it.  I am taking the middle road here.  The movie is funny to watch, with some parts that make you cringe and feel uncomfortable even as an innocent observer.

The most troubling aspects of this movie dealt with the sheer mean-spiritedness that some of the scenes featured.  For example, a very sweet jewish couple that ran the bed and breakfast.  Whether or not Cohen is Jewish, the way those people were treated showed little class.  If they were part of the joke, I would not be so disgusted; but I don't think they were.

The fight between Cohen and his partner in which they were rolling around nude, served no point other than sick shock value.  How that scene, or the bathroom/dinner table scene serves as political commentary is beyond me.  There is no reason to make this movei more than it is.  It is a slapstick, low brow, comedy with some funny scenes and other scenes that are simply gross and geared towards the type of drunken college kids in the R.V. that Borat got drunk with.

2351389,4,6302078164,"OK, so by buying and watching this film, I succumbed to all the hype, some of it utter nonsense, that preceded its release. Masterful spin, I'd say. Anyway, unless you are one who takes everything literally and/or are one of those who doesn't appreciate humor that denigrates (What other kind is there?), then you should find Borat hysterically funny but...
But what? Well, the word is about that all of the scenes in Borat (except the one with Pamela Anderson) were spontaneous, that is to say that the people meeting Borat actually thought they were contributing to a documentary about America to be shown on Kazakh TV. I'd say that after watching closely several times that while some people may have been caught off guard, others surely were in on the game. Though New Yorkers' reactions to Borat trying to kiss them is entirely believable, some other scenes were not. I can't imagine the scene at the rodeo where Borat butchered the national anthem, nor can I imagine that Borat could get away with defecating in front of the Trump Towers in full public view without being challenged. The scenes toward the end where Borat and his assistant run nude into a meeting of mortgage brokers taxes its credibility as well. Then there is the scene where Borat sleeps next to a campfire on the steps of a mega-church and hasn't been rousted long before the congregation begins to arrive. Come on!
Then there is something that perhaps the film's producers missed: Borat's appearance on the evening news in Jackson MS long before he and his assistant got anywhere near Jackson. Watch closely, unless you are geographically challenged, you'll see what I am saying.
Beyond all that, there is a lot to laugh at. Sacha Baron Cohen's character causes you to confront some of the crudest and most outlandish stereotypes about others, particularly about Jews. There is the Running of the Jew back home in Kazakhstan where the object is not to let the Jew get the money, there is the idea that Jews can shift shapes and that the new form can be mollified by throwing money at it (must be a peculiarly Eastern European myth, not even the Nazis tried to sell that), then there is the idea that Jews will cunningly kill, eat and rob Christians. The scene where the traveling pair went to a bed and breakfast that turned out to be owned by an elderly Jewish couple is just hilarious. Other stereotypes are confronted as well: about gypsies, about blacks, about gays, about evangelical Christians and even about Southern whites.
Some of the scenes tut-tutted in the press as being horrible I see in retrospect as being just cleverly spun, like the scene where Borat asks the gun-shop owner about which is the best gun with which to defend himself against Jews. The owner told him, but he didn't sell him a gun, did he? Ditto the man in the car lot who told Borat what speed would do the maximum damage to a crowd of gypsies with minimum damage to the Hummer that Borat was trying to buy. If indeed the answer was spontaneous, my view is that the car lot owner considered the question a joke since where would one find a crowd of gypsies to plow into in the US?
What's my favorite scene? It's Borat returning to the dinner table at a fancy dining club trying to find out where to dispose of the turd he is carrying in a baggie and the hostess then having to show him how a toilet is used.
My caveats aside, don't try to read too much social commentary into Borat though its there for those who seek it. While its not clean, its great fun and some of the deleted scenes featured in the bonus section will have you roaring as well. Some of the movie is downright silly, but overall its still one of the funniest I've seen in a while.",1175212800,3,3711,4.5568862275449105

2351422,4,6302078164,"Like Jerry Seinfeld, Sasha Cohen goes straight for the laugh, and isn't concerned with any ""message"". Like Trey Parker and Matt Stone, co-creators of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/South-Park/dp/B00023P49C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">South Park</a>, in ""Borat..."", many of the laughs fall into the category of toilet humor. This movie is my main exposure to Cohen. I saw a few episodes of his TV show prior to the movie, but just like watching a few episodes of South Park couldn't possibly prepare me for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/South-Park-Bigger-Longer-Uncut/dp/B000022TSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut</a>, I had no idea what I was in for.

While Cohen isn't concerned about a ""message"", we see one immediately when he arrives in New York. His overeager attempts to greet New Yorkers with kisses are met with hysterical results. One man quite literally runs into and down the street to escape him; others threaten him with great bodily harm.

Borat is supposedly in the ""U.S. and A"" to film a documentary for his country, Kazakhstan. While in his hotel room, he sees an episode of Baywatch, and falls in love with C.J. During a meeting with feminists - hysterical - he finds that she lives in Malibu, CA, and so decides to travel cross-country and ask Pamela Anderson to marry him.

I won't go through the so-called plot, because the fun is in the spontaneity of the humor, but there is one incident I'd like to address.

On the way to California, he schedules various stops to learn more about American culture. One such stop is at a rodeo in Roanoke, VA, where he angles his way into singing the national anthem - but he chooses to sing it with the words of his country's own anthem supplanting ours. Before singing, he espoused great support for the war on terror, and hoped that George Bush would drink the blood of every single [Iraqi]. This was met with thunderous applause. But then he started to sing, and asserted that Kazakhstan was the greatest country in the world. What struck me as odd here was that nobody started to boo until he declared that Kazakhstan was the #1 exporter of potassium, and that their potassium was the best. Honestly, I don't think anybody knew what they were booing about, other than someone was saying that a country other than theirs was #1. Again, Cohen wasn't going for a message, just a reaction, but we got one loud and clear. It was even clearer in the extras, where news coverage for that event was shown and the newscaster declared that Borat was ""bashing"" everything from the war to the Bush administration, which was a flat-out lie.

Borat's trip took him through the South, and as one reviewer indicated, the South has been picked on considerably, and it would have been interesting to inspect the reactions of his radical behavior when applied to Midwesterners. I agree. That would have been an interesting approach. My gut tells me, though, that it wouldn't have been as funny.

Borat's fear and hatred of the Jew was, to me, humorous, mainly because they were shown, during one of his ""interviews,"" to be ill-founded and silly. Indeed, that particular scene, where he rented a room from an elderly Jewish couple, spoke loudly to the tumult in the Middle East, and the pointlessness of the hatred that is there so deeply ingrained.

The Bonus Features weren't all I hoped them to be. Other than the enlightening Roanoke news broadcast, nothing that had been ""censored"" was as funny or pointed as what was in the film, so those were judicious cuts.

Also, the extras were neither subtitled nor closed captioned. I don't understand why, when the movie grossed almost fifteen times what it cost to make (this virtually guaranteeing that the DVD will be successful), they couldn't spend the extra money and subtitle and/or caption the extras, as they did for the film itself. More and more producers of DVDs are doing this now, and for those of us who are hearing impaired, it makes a difference - the difference being that we might not buy a DVD if we don't think the special features/extras will be accessible to us.

Lily Tomlin & Steve Martin in ""All of Me"" made me laugh.  ""Little Miss Sunshine"" made me laugh.  I don't like disparaging humor.  In this film, Sacha Baron Cohen's anti-Jewish sentiment made me squeamish.  Then they started getting sillier like when instructing the artist to remember the horn, ""It must be realistic.""  By then I was laughing.  I wondered if there wasn't intended irony with the actor's last name.  Yes, this humor is very lowbrow.  It makes us ask the existential question, ""Is it really okay to laugh at backward Eastern Europeans?""  But then, this is no more an accurate a representation of them than it is is of Americans.

The scene in the animal shelter where Cohen wants to adopt a dog so he can ""have sexy time"" and the outrage on the animal shelter operator's face as she shoos him out of the facility is hysterical.

A Borat example - when Borat confronted the African Americans on the street, he quickly showed us that all were friendly no matter their appearance, the language barrier or their skin color. When Borat decided to mimic them he showed us how human beings in this country are treated with prejudice simply because ""of their appearance"", the clothes they wear and the ""slang"" they speak [bringing to mind images of ""racism""]. There are many more such examples in this excellent parody. i.e. the paranoia of our ""military state"" (the cops and the Secret Service) and of course the asinine prejudice against Jewish people.

Nothing personal, but I would be surprised if Poodytat ""poodytat"" can define parody??? I feel sorry for such people and MOST IMPORTANT, I'm sorry for our country to have people with such short-sightedness and lack of depth; lacking the understanding for the plight of others!!!

I just feel it works best in ""Da Ali G Show."" For me, the best part in the film was with the Frat boys in the RV who watch the DVD with him and his heart breaks, this is just classic.  Another thing that worked great for me on the DVD was the compilation of the press footage Borat got. His appearances on Jay Leno and Conan are worth the price of the DVD alone and show just how far this man will go with people who may, or may not know how far that is, something that was not as central in the movie. To me, that's the appeal of every character in ""Da Ali G show"" and especially Borat since he plays off the the whole culture clash sensitivity and shows just how sensitive people are and how much some people try to hide it, just for the sake of a foreigner.

2351446,3,6302078164,"Borat was a bit of a disappointment considering how good Ali G Indahouse had been, not to mention all the hype surrounding the release of this latest movie.  The film brings to the screen the Kazakh sex-starved journalist Borat, as he travels across the USA on an errand by his government to make a documentary on the American way of life.

Sacha Baron Cohen takes the country by storm when he hits the American shores and starts picking on as many different groups as possible; from politicians, minorities and religious groups to feminists, hotel staff and innocent passerby's.

His success lies in the indiscriminate use of caustic humor against everybody.

However, unlike in Ali G Indahouse and the Da Ali G Show-The Complete First Season, a.k.a. Ali G in Da USAiii, where the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful, in Borat it's just average and in some cases, such as the male nude ""wrestling"" scenes, just tasteless and sad.

Nevertheless it does have its moments and at times it does make you hold your breath in anticipation or burst out laughing.

In addition, the way Borat had that crowd going with ""We support your war of terror!"" was hilarious and he managed to get his message across very effectively.

In a nutshell, it's an ok movie if you're in a silly mood and/or are heavily intoxicated, and that's about it; no masterpiece here.",1174780800,2,1389,4.7625

I think that the anti-Semitic, anti-gay and other politically incorrect sentiments expressed in the film were not meant to poke fun at Jews or gays, rather, they were intended to poke fun at those who hold such attitudes.  Mel Brooks used this type of humor in several of his movies- (Blazing Saddles comes to mind.) The forbidden ""n"" word is used many times in Blazing Saddles, but only to poke fun at the ignorance of those who oppose the hero of the film. Mel also pokes fun at Jewish stereotypes in the movie Spaceballs, (and he's Jewish himself) but the end result is that he is not making fun of Jews or any other minority group, but of the stereotypes themselves. He motivates us to examine the truth and the exaggeration inherent in our many stereotypes, which is what Cohen is also doing with the Borat character.

I absolutely loved this movie, and it was deliciously funny precisely because it is so innocent and honest.  The rodeo manager was my favorite character aside from Borat himself.

The bad:

I found the scene with the Jewish bed and breakfast to be mean spirited.  The elderly Jewish couple that ran it were clearly very sweet and trusting people and I found it to be immoral whether Cohen is Jewish or not.

The dining club deserved to be exposed- especially since they put up with all of his nonsense until his black girlfriend showed up and they went berzerk. However the jab at the guys wife before that should have earned Borat some broken teeth from the husband.

Finally the naked male wrestling scene is DISGUSTING.  Trust me on this one.

The Good:

His time in New York is so funny that in the movie theater people were laughing so hard and so loudly that we were missing parts.

Making fun of the hicks at the stadium saying ""We support Bush's War of Terror!!!!"" etc. was really funny.

Exposing the racist frat boys was priceless.

Bagging Pamela Anderson- classic!!! And it pissed off ""Kid Rock"" so much the wussy divorced her!

2351456,5,6302078164,"Well, here's the moment of truth: my review of BORAT, one of 2006's most controversial films. Sacha Baron Cohen, originating on HBO's ""Da Ali G Show"" stars as the delightful Kazakhstani journalist who has been sent to America to make a documentary on cultural differences. Borat starts out with a bang, from the very first line which is ""Jag sez mais! A-my name a-Borat!"" In Borat, the ACTUAL country of Kazakhstan is made out to be a dump full of prostitutes, animal rapists, town abortionists, and a country that has yet to discover DVDs and Music CDs, and are instead stuck with the ""VCR recorders"" and ""play cassettes."" The first five minutes of the movie is filmed in a studio. Then, for the remaining 75 minutes, Borat travels to America in an absolutely uncut, uncensored, unscripted, and completely unexpected and daring film stunt. Throughout the movie, Borat talks to American citizens: normal guys off the street of New York, rich home owners, slums, even a pair of old Jewish people owning a bed and breakfast. And, then, Sacha Baron Cohen does what he does best: makes people look stupid. Eventually, Borat falls in love with Pamela Anderson and sets off on a cross-country journey to California to make her his wife. The movie is disgusting, revolting, shocking, vulgar, crude, full of sexual jokes, intentional racial prejudice, and is just about insulting to every person in the audience. However, it is without a doubt, the funniest movie I have seen in 2006!! While watching the film you really have to put all the crude scenes and jokes beside you and just appreciate the sheer genius of Sacha Baron Cohen and see that actually, behind all the crude childish stuff, this movie is SMART and ultimately RIGHT! I laughed so hard my throat hurt and head ached after leaving the theater, plus I had a Cherry Coke stain on my pants that appeared sometime during the movie, as the drink had come out of my nose. I can see why some people don't like it, including the Kazakh government, but you need to relax and just take it for what it is: a movie. A movie filmed with no script, no rules, no boundaries, and a bunch of unexpecting and unlucky Americans. And you know what the best part is? After leaving the theater, the first thought to run through your head will be ""Wow. America truly does suck."" See it for yourself. You may or not be disappointed, but I loved it, and I hope you will too!",1174521600,5,2407,4.639344262295082

2351460,5,6302078164,"It takes a certain kind of genious to recycle an old ""Candid Camera"" idea and make it relavently funny in the new century.  Sacha Baron Cohen is THAT kind of genious.

Most people know the origins of the bumbling, cheerful, optimistic, innocent, bigoted, anti-gay and anti-semitic reporter from a formerly Soviet country few people know anything about.  Cohen proves that Andy Kaufmann may not have been crazy after all, just merely born ahead of his time.  He remains totally in character in a number of diverse situations many people have found themselves in, but never saw through totally clueless eyes.  It's easy to see how people can be taken in by his act, as Cohen really gives his all in performing the role he's chosen to (nicely) torture Americans (and others, to be fair).  I see why people shown in this movie would be angry to be in it, as at best, we see them trying like all Hell to be nice to someone so obviously lacking cultural literacy about the ""U S and A,"" and at worst see their own prejudices flown as high as any freak-flag imaginable.

This is also where I've discovered a film that is as much showing our darknesses we'd rather keep hidden as having fun with them.  How much of the folks saying what they say is ""playing along"" with someone who doesn't know thing one about the United States and how much is being allowed because of it to say what they really think about gays, Jews, etc., is what we don't know.  Perhaps the number of suits coming up against Cohen tells us this.  If true, that's dispirating because ""Borat"" to me is telling us what hasn't changed about people.  We're still as much afraid of the ""different"" amongst us as he is, and while we try to keep it well hidden, our bigotry still has a tendancy to sneak out when we least expect it, such as when we're trying to not be shocked ourselves when someone else makes inappropriate comments.

In trying to make it as much as crude ""documentary"" as possible, Cohen and his merry crew have the prerequisite background shots about Borat and his (fictionalized) country.  We also see shots ""behind the scenes"" with his producer, usually these involve dealing with a situation they'd rather not be in (like the bed-and-breakfast owned by a sweet elderly Jewish couple).  While necessary, these are the weakest part of the film (except for certain naked jokes involving Borat - they are as funny as the interviews themselves).  The best bits are the interviews and real-life moments.  People actually don't know what to make of the silly man who says obnoxious things so cheerily, and that's what makes ""Borat"" so funny - real life and how WE deal with it.

So, if you're looking for a movie-film that is laugh-out-loud funny, you could do worse that ""Borat.""  If you're looking for an out-of-kilter mirror on society, you could also do worse than ""Borat.""

Popular TV journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Cohen) travels from his simple home in Kazakhstan to the United States to record a documentary about American customs to bring back to his beloved home. With his able producer Azamat Bagatov, Borat interacts with Americans and heads to California to seduce ""Baywatch"" star Pamela Anderson. ""Borat"" is an outrageously humorous mockumentary that showcases Cohen's fearless comedic talents. Most scenes in the movie are unscripted with real Americans. ""Borat"" isn't for everyone. Due to its prejudiced remarks, the mockumentary generated much controversy and was banned in several countries. In the United States, ""Borat"" received strong positive reviews by critics, became a commercial success and received numerous awards.

If you enjoyed ""Borat"" in theaters then pick up your copy of critically acclaimed mockumentary on DVD. The mockumentary is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. Due to the various types of cameras used in the film, the picture quality is somewhat mixed but still pretty sharp. The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound isn't terrific but still clean and well-balanced.

They must have known what a whirlpool of criticism it would raise. Anyone who feels offended after watching this film either did not get it or strongly resembles some of the ""Americans representing America"" in the film. (In this connection, I burst into another fit of laughter while reading one of the preceding reviews here and the nine comments on it - some terrific comments, thank you!) Cohen's diction as Borat is flawless, his acting and lines simply hilarious! Ken Davitian (as his producer and traveling companion Azamat Bagatov) is entertaining and convincing as well. You've got to put any seriousness aside as soon as the protagonist introduces himself with a big smile, ""My name is Borat. I like a-you. I like sex,"" then proceeds to introduce his little ""Kazakh"" town inhabitants from the local ""mechanic & abortionist"" to the ""kindergarten"" = kids with guns. When he arrives to the U.S, New Yorkers (true to their reputation) respond to his peculiarly warm behavior with a lot of F-words. Even the most polished-looking man in an expensive suit does not hesitate to say: ""You kiss me, and I'll pop you in the f-----g balls!""  The long (but never boring!) line of his encounters with unsuspecting Americans goes from there all the way to California. One has to admire how composed and patient some of these people are while being faced with Borat's bizarre and/or shocking statements and behavior (well, except perhaps for the Veteran Feminists of America). Cohen would have me laughing in no time, whether I'm on his true story or not. You can also see hypocrisy of others, and downright chilling responses from people like the GM salesman who's not sure how to explain the ""pussy magnet"" in a car, but gives Borat a precise estimate on how fast he must drive a Hummer into a crowd of gypsies to kill them. Or the man behind the gun shop counter who wastes no time finding the right gun ""to defend (Borat) from a Jew,""  the Imperial Rodeo general manager with his ""dadgum Muslim"" advice, and the spectators at the Imperial Rodeo who keep clapping and cheering while Borat talks about ""American terror of war."" Are they actually listening to him or is the crowd mentality simply taking over? And what about the screaming and running preacher who looks more possessed than the people he claims to help? Or the drunk Fraternity Brothers from University of South Carolina who not only don't know the difference between Russia and Kazakhstan, but show what poor excuses for human beings they are while talking about girls. Losers either way. My favorite scene has got to be the one at the Magnolia Mansion. Whether it is the ""retired/retard"" word play, Borat's little surprise after using a bathroom or his unexpected dinner guest, the members of this dining society are exposed as the self-righteous, hypocratic, and patronizing people they are. Some scenes are close to revolting (e.g. Borat & Azamat's wrestling in a hotel room), but they are a crucial part of the film. I will not go into more details so I don't spoil the film for those amazon customers who have not seen it yet (if there are any), I'll just add that the music score is pretty awesome, too, and the Deleted Scenes on the DVD are also worth watching (I will never pass a cheese aisle in a supermarket without laughing again). To close with Borat's words, ""I had learned that if you chase a dream... especially one with plastic chests..."" - well, for those of you who haven't done so yet, better watch the film until the end to hear the rest of this true line, and (hopefully) comprehend the bright idea behind the whole film.

I haven't laughed out loud during a movie since liar,liar with Jim Cary.

To make a culteral impact this movie has made in these times takes a hard feat. Most people are numb to everything that is put in front of them nowadays. The fact that Sasha has created a culteral fenom in the year 2006 speaks volumes.

Try creating something with as much shock and awe this movie has created, it would be hard pressed.

2351481,1,6302078164,"It is almost impossible for me to believe that a movie like this got funding in the first place.  As my daughter explained the movie was based on ""Da Ali G Show"" character developed by Sacha Baron Cohen.  It probably attracted some of its initial following just because of that.  Of course, it wouldn't be the first movie to have been spawned by a TV show and it won't be the last.  But as TV shows go, is this the best that could have made the transition?

Several of my friends swore by the movie.  To be fair, it goes where most movies would dare not tread.  But in an age where appeal is where others find it, it seems certain that many folks might feel less than hip to admit this movie to be totally devoid of any merit.

I'm not afraid to admit that one or two scenes caused me to chuckle.  But what seems terrible to me is to think that I wasted an hour and a half and watched it!  As my wife often has claimed that's because men will watch anything - even if the movie is terrible.  Of this, I confess, I am indeed guilty.

It just might be that this movie and its appeal are an overreaction to our so-called modern society and its incredulous politically correct attitudes that shy away from truth in the name of total acceptability - an impossible feat by definition.  If we really lust for escape from our modern attitudes of propriety, why don't we exploit the real and funny truths which we all inherently understand?  We really don't need to be slapped ""up the side of the head"" to know what is possible in today's world.  There are far too many examples of real people mistreating others that have nothing to do with a warped fantasy.

I guess most of us would love a chance to do something we love and possibly even make a living while doing it.  To that extent, we can't really blame the writers, producers, directors, actors and even the investors from doing this project.

All shot as a faux documentary, Borat is supposed to be the 4th most famous person in all of Kazakhstan, coming to the US and A to learn how to improve his country's cultural learnings.  After falling in love with CJ on Baywatch, Borat convinces his producer companion to leave NYC in search of California (and Pamela Anderson) so that they might cross the US and A and find real culture. Armed with his vial of gypsy tears to ward off evil, a wild bear, and a dilapidated ice cream truck, the two companions from Kazakhstan head west.  What ensues is comedic blasphemy to the point of needing an oxygen bottle to maintain consciousness; because you will laugh yourself into asphyxia.

Shot for real cheap.  The producers of this film scored a hit and scored hard.  As for the controversy and all that.  I'll say this: No one is holding a gun to your head to watch this!!  Right?  Gawd!  People are so f*cking uptight nowadays!  Get a clue.  This is the most tongue-in-cheek movie ever made!  There are no boundries.  And the most hysterical thing is that most of the people in this movie (supposedly) had no idea that it wasn't real.  That is the sheer genius of Borat.  They took real people, put them into uncomfortable situations, and watched the results.  Most people aren't very nice when they're nudged in the wrong direction and Borat proves that.  If people can't take a joke, f*ck them!  There are far too many other attrocities going on in the world to be wasting time protesting a movie.

Borat is obviously not going to be for everyone, but if you want to laugh yourself hoarse and you have a somewhat open-minded sense of humor, buy it right now.  You won't be disappointed.  The deleted scenes are hysterical too.

2351501,5,6302078164,"Borat, one of the characters made famous by comic actor Sacha Baron Cohen on British television and then in the United States via HBO, is offensive and moronic, yet endearing and funny. This is completely stupid, completely funny comedy. I'll skip the details of the story, since so many other reviewers have clued you in on the premise, and instead tell you that if you appreciate funny, aren't easily offended, and like something different, get this movie.

My face only used about three expressions while I watched Borat. First was disbelief and shock in what I was seeing followed by complete surprise and laughter, with moments of digust thrown in for good measure. I mumbled things like, ""Oh no..."" or ""I can't believe it,"" and ""He just..."" throughout the film.

This movie is fresh, though Borats antics are not, considering he was doing this stuff on ""Da Ali G Show"" for a while. It required a movie like this to present this character to those of us who don't watch TV that often.

One reviewer mentioned that while the character of Borat is funny, ""what is funnier is watching the reaction to the character by the people that he is duping,"" And that couldn't be more true. The candid aspect is what makes this movie really work.

Most of the people in this film were not actors, and had signed a release to consent being filmed for a ""documentary."" After Borat became so popular I think some disgruntled ""filmees"" tried to sue the filmmakers.

In all I found Borat to be incredibly entertaining. That's why I bought it, so I can watch it again. Even the packaging reflects the comical nature of the film. If you like twisted humor, bizarre slapstick, and just plain funny situations, with a dose of the inappropriate, you'll love Borat.",1173744000,11,1746,4.711475409836066

2351503,3,6302078164,"The public reaction to Borat speaks volumes about the very small amount of the US population that either doesn't have HBO or simply has never tuned into HBO's Da Ali G Show. Sacha Baron Cohen certainly didn't break new ground with the Borat character in the full-length feature film Borat. Indeed, the Borat character was a regular part of the Ali G show first popularized in the UK in 2000 and introduced to US viewers via HBO in 2004.

So technically, all the hub-bub on the one side of the fence about Borat being a ""racist"" character or a misrepresentation of the Kazakhstan people is about 7 years late. And the suggestion on the other side of the fence that Borat is the funniest movie or character to come along in years is way overrated.

The Borat character is funny. But what is funnier is watching the reaction to the character by the people that he is duping. Similarly, Cohen's Ali G character (a stereotypical hip-hop, British ghetto banger TV host) and the Bruno character (a stereotypical gay mannerismed TV host) have the same modus operandi....

....And that modus operandi is Socratic irony. The characters deliberately feign ignorance in order to expose weakness in another's position. The result: most of the time hilarity. Whether it's Borat, Ali G or Bruno, the laughs are less to each character's behavior and more to the reaction of the person being duped and the commitment that people have to being politically correct so as not to question the ridiculous opinions and questions that Cohen's characters come up with. Cohen's characters' naive stupidity make his victims look equally stupid...Socratic irony. (The only victim that I ever saw that had enough intelligence to walk out of the situation without any regard to whether or not he was offending the Cohen character was Donald Trump.)

Comparitively, if what we're really after here are public reactions to pranks and gags, you can get it all for free on YouTube. Cohen just has a better knack for executing his gags on VIPs. Therefore, to make a full length movie that developed the Borat character was a bit overkill for me. A movie that was similar to Da Ali G Show that mixed up the characters a bit would have kept the gags a bit more fresh.

So do you want to see some funny pranks and gags that get a bit tired by the end of full length feature film about just the Borat character? Then the Borat movie is for you. Would you rather see it mixed up a bit between different characters? Then go with Da Ali G Show seasonal DVD releases. You want pranks and gags for free? Go to YouTube.

But don't be fooled into being offended by any of the Cohen characters. They are not real; the man behind the mask really isn't that stupid. He's trying to make YOU look stupid.

Actually, I am usually the one explaining to all my friends why a joke is funny or the humor in a situation they may not immediately see.  But Borat took it all too far.

For the uninitiated, Mr. Cohen is very much like this generation's Andy Kaufman, a comedian who purposely antagonizes people and fearlessly faces retaliation from them. Borat is akin to Kaufman's ""Latka Gravas"" character, a stranger in a strange land whose (fictional) culture is so far removed from that of this foreign country that he cannot assimilate. The crux of the film, of course, is to emphasize aspects of American culture. In the film, Borat travels from his native Kazakhstan to the United States in order to glean ""cultural learnings."" He had to act quite outrageously in order to elicit a response from New Yorkers, though most other Americans he encountered found most everything he did offensive. I'm not entirely convinced he made the film so much to show Americans' biases as much as merely to evoke our common cultural traits. I watched this film with a girlfriend, who hated it with a passion and did not see the point of making it because ""everyone knows this is the way Americans are."" Yet, she came to this country from Bangladesh at age seventeen and has experienced firsthand some of the bigotry exhibited in the film. At the other extreme, my mother, who has lived in Ohio her entire life, considers the portrayal of the dysfunction in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" to be ""unrealistic"" and over the top. It seems to me Americans do not know one another as well as one would think. So, why is this film important now? What is Mr. Cohen, who is English, trying to say by making this film? Perhaps he thinks Americans are too full of ourselves, that we are hubristic and believe we can do whatever we want with the world? Perhaps he wants to divide the Americans who watch the film, to dissociate ourselves from one another along ethnic, religious or other cultural lines? Maybe he wants to introduce the rest of the world to genuine America? Perhaps it is to draw Americans closer together, to get us to embrace our cultural heritage (as the antique store owner in Dallas states)? Or, maybe he just wanted to show how bigoted some people are? Whatever way one interprets his intentions, his act is brilliant and hilarious.

2351516,1,6302078164,"Borat is great at showing how low American movie making has gone. I noticed that most professional reviewers top ten lists were half filled with foreign films for 2006. Borat is a great example of why. I am an open minded person. Rocky Horror and Requim for a Dream are not for the squeemish or closed minded, yet I love both. But Borat is just crass and uncomfortable. That a person can stoop so low as Sasha is so disturbing that it does make you laugh - out of embarressment. The fact that it gets so much press is doubly disturbing. Let's be kind and accept the sexual sister kissing, the running of the Jews, the purchase of Jew killing guns and the butchering of the national anthem. The naked fight in the hotel is about the most disgusting thing I've ever seen and so far from funny as to not even being worth consideration.

2351518,1,6302078164,"I am nonplussed at the thought of writing a review about ""Borat."" I guess the thing to do is to get some choice words out of the way.

Vile, sophomoric, lewd, disgusting, soporific, pathetic, lowbrow, worthless and unbelievable. Whew. That feels better.

I mildly laughed at the film a couple of times early on. A friend belly-laughed at scenes that were anything but funny. I knew we were in for a long night when Borat and tag-a-long buddy Azamat stopped at a bed and breakfast ran by two sweet Jewish folks. Later, when Azamat began overtly admiring a ""Baywatch"" book (I'm cleaning up the scene), I walked out of the room.

""Waterworld"" and ""Joe Vs. The Volcano"" can rest easy. This is the worst movie I have ever seen.

The gag is that Cohen, who is Jewish, is attempting to show that racism, and anti-Semites, are still prevalent in America, particularly --- wait for it --- down South. I'm refraining from calling this train wreck satire because satire is an artistic term and ""Borat"" is nowhere near worth calling art.

Thirty-five years ago, Norman Lear's ""All in the Family"" accomplished what this film can't by using sophistication, wit and good writing. Imagine that.

This worthless pile of celluloid is intended to shock. If you like unspeakably bad jokes, humor that wouldn't do in a frat house, full-frontal male nudity and content that should make anyone with a brain blush, by all means this film is for you. I sincerely hope I never hear of Cohen again.

At their best, movies have the power to raise us up, to comment on the human condition and make us better people. Less lofty films at least can entertain and offer 90 minutes of mindless humor.

""Borat"" is none of this. It is an amazingly unfunny, poorly done, offensive, worthless piece of garbage. And all those other adjectives I used at the beginning of this piece.

2351522,5,6302078164,"Recommended to those who enjoy irreverent humor, BORAT tells the story of two journalists from the fictionalized nation of Kazakhstan who travel to the US to film a documentary about life in the States.  Partially scripted with professional actors and partially filmed guerilla-style with regular people, it stars Sacha Baron Cohen and Ken Davitian.

A buddy film that documents a cross-country odyssey from New York to Los Angeles, the story veers off the road, when Borat finds a photo of ""Pah-may-la"" Anderson at a yard sale and decides to make the Baywatch star his bride.

Critically acclaimed and wildly popular at the box office, BORAT will nonetheless never be made into a sequel, thanks to the hundreds - if not thousands of lawsuits - it inspired.  Still it is definitely worth seeing if not for the humor then for the revealing sociological window it offers into American culture.

Like a fun house mirror that exaggerates anything that stands before it, the Borat character succeeds in provoking and poking fun at both the stereotypically nave American characters who appear in the film and those who watch and review it.

Whatever the unfortunate personality quirk is, Borat, like a caricature artist, is a genius at uncovering and magnifying it - which is undoubtedly why this is the film that launched a thousand lawsuits.  From the misogynistic, anti-Semitic frat boys and the homophobic rodeo director to the perfectly polite Southern socialites who eventually call the police to have Borat removed from their dinner party, no one is safe from ridicule - not even the film's reviewers, many of whom use the occasion to indulge in middle-American bashing.

Before I saw the film I could easily understand why politicians in Kazakhstan would be upset by a movie that misrepresents and makes fun of their nation.  But after seeing it, I realize that BORAT plays the same fun house prank on Kazakhstan that it pulls on the US, by provoking this huge Eurasian country to ban the film from ever showing there.

In the spirit of ""I had to kill him because he falsely called me a murderer,"" BORAT inspires America's self-flagellating, intolerance of intolerance and Kazakhstan's ban on the film in protest of being portrayed as a dictatorship where people have few if any natural rights.

One last thought: if I were one of the horrendous frat boys who appeared in this movie, I'd be too busy getting appearance-altering plastic surgery or a personality transplant to bother suing the filmmakers.

It is a legitimate dvd.

The film is quite funny and sometimes embarrassing to watch...sometimes utterly excrutiating, but I was screaming with laughter througout the whole film.

Mr. Cohen is definitely a force to be reckoned with, and I applaud him for his effort. The DVD has lots of extra scenes that were cut, and will be as offensive as the film itself. I really enjoyed it a lot. The only way I could  see a sequel is if Borat took a northern route and met the mid-westerners like myself. We have foibles of our own, and the southerners have been picked on enough. I can't blab away plot-points, but this is truly a sweet, outrageous, crazy display of human nature; innate prejudices that everyone insists they don't have; longing for acceptance in an often alien world.

Believe me when I say that I am not easily offended, nor am I given to prudish attitudes regarding subject matter that is risque or offensive to some in polite society. This movie, however, goes far beyond the pale.

It was neither satisfying or pleasant to see two naked men, one of whom was outrageously rotund, wrestling around together on a bed. This homoerotic bit of comedic misadventure burst from the privacy of their hotel room into an elevator, through corridors of the hotel, and ultimately intruding on a meeting of some sort in the hotel ballroom.

Not only does this movie suck, it nearly shows you the act!

While I am not Christian, I was disturbed by the fun being made of Christianity.

While I am not a Jew, I was offended at the ""running of the Jew"".

While I am not a rodeo fan, I was offended at the insulting behavior directed toward those who are.

While I am not a cowboy, I thought the film made fun of those who live that life in America.

I am, however, a patriotic American. I was offended at our national athem being corrupted for totally purile comedic purpose. I certainly did not find it funny in any manner whatsoever. I also did not find funny the sight of our flag being pitched to the ground. This is an outrage, especially when our young men and women are dying daily in Iraq under that same flag.

A word to Sacha Baron Cohen: If you want to make fun of a nation, go make fun of your own! Instead of hurling insulting humor at George W. Bush, why not take on Tony Blair!

The major premise of the film seems to be how many ways they can sneak male genitalia into the picture without getting an ""X"" rating. Photos of a penis are gleefully shown with gay abandon! No pun intended. The other overwhelming theme seems to revolve around excrement. From being presented with the spectacle of Cohen relieving himself in the bushes at Trump Towers, to his bringing a bag of his own fecal material down to a dinner party, to the van in which they housed a bear, they seem almost ritually obsessed with feces. And crap is what this movie is.

This movie is the most tasteless, disgusting and banal piece of tripe to come along in many years, and whatever actual humor may be found in the film is lost among the incessant sex and toilet jokes, tastelessly woven through a fabric of intolerance masquerading as humor.

This movie is the cinematic equivalent of Michael Richards ignorant and racist attack on blacks. Except in this case, Cohen does not stop at the implied ""N"" word, but enhances his act with the ""J"" word, the ""S"" word, the ""Q"" word and a host of others.

That this film won awards only serves to illustrate how quickly our world is devolving an ultimate IDIOCRACY! When intolerance, bigotry, ignorance, incivility and the lowest denominator toilet humor is celebrated with awards and critical acclaim, we are in peril of losing any sense of decency, community and progress as a nation. To be succint, it illustrates that depravity is rapidly becoming tolerated and even extolled as somehow viturous.

In a world where the highest ideals of humanity are marginalized, where films of oustanding import to us all exist, where artistic quality goes unrecognized, and profound values unrewarded; it is disheartening that this sort of drivel receives widespread acclaim!

Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is a fictional television journalist from the backwoods of Kazakhstan who, along with his producer Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian), comes to the United States to learn from American culture and document his adventures. The pair arrive in New York City, where Borat finds the populace not quite friendly enough for him. An evening spent watching television in his hotel room introduces Borat to ""Baywatch"", and he falls instantly in love with Pamela Anderson. Determined to make Ms. Anderson his wife, Borat and Azamat set out for California in a de-commissioned ice cream truck, trying to make the most of their contacts with American culture along the way.

Sacha Baron Cohen has guts. He let Borat's unenlightened views of women, gays, and Jews lose on unsuspecting Americans and barely got out of a rodeo in Salem, Virginia in one piece. Other reactions to Borat were subdued, however, probably because people knew they were being filmed. Only four characters in the movie are portrayed by actors: Borat, Azamat, the prostitute Luenell, and Pamela Anderson. But this isn't Candid Camera. The humor coach, feminists, etiquette expert, dinner guests, B&B proprietors, antiques dealer, and others believed that they were being filmed for a documentary. That explains why the pranks feel staged and the reactions are feeble. If the intention was to show that Americans are insular and intolerant, it doesn't come off. Only the Chi Psi frat boys are truly vile, and they were drunk.

""Borat"" has some very funny scenes, but it is funny only sporadically. The material is more suited to comedic bits than to a feature film. Scenes run on too long, and Borat and Azamat's ambling about the country is tedious. The jokes are funny once, but Borat essentially plays the same prank over and over. There isn't enough material for 1 hour and 25 minutes of movie. The promotional stunts for the film are funnier than the film itself, because they are shorter. As for its controversial (and counterfeit) opinions, ""Borat"" is far too silly to be offensive. And it's too monotonous to be funny. I was sorry to find that ""Borat"" is a yawn.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): Bonus features include 8 deleted scenes (""Censored Footage""), ""Global Propaganda"" (16 min), which is footage from the promotional tour for the film, including Sacha Baron Cohen's appearances as Borat on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and guest Martha Stewart, and ""Musicks Infomercial"" (1 min), a pseudo-promo for Borat's music.

Being fans of Da Ali-G series, which we bought from Amazon and rewatch periodically, I was amazed at how absolutely UNFUNNY the movie is.  Borat in this film is simply too sweet, the ""romantic"" subplot slows the pacing down, and Borat's experiences are not as revolting or un-PC as either in Da Ali-G shows or what my husband and I hear or observe and have even experienced on any given day in the US or at the various times we have lived abroad.  Americans are both wonderful and downright mean-spirited, often in the same individual, which this film simply demonstrates.  There are no outrageous examples of racism, homophobia, even misogeny -- what is everyone out there either moaning about or applauding as cutting-edge or biting humor?  People, get real about entertainment and hyperbole. The double-edged swaord of free speech (and who would want to live otherwise?) is that people can express their true thoughts.

In my opinion the funniest parts of the film are those in which Cohen as Borat, interacts with people who have no idea who he is. His attempts to give men welcome kisses as he walks the streets of NY are hysterical. The driving lesson is outrageously funny as a real driving instructor, oblivious to the fact that Cohen is acting, tries to cope with Borat's attempts to drink booze while shouting obscenities at other drivers. You will fall down laughing. Another great segment is the ride in the RV with the sexist college frat boys. Cutting edge stuff. However, a lot of the other material falls flat. The rodeo is embarrassing. The nude wrestling scene could have used a good edit. Pamela Anderson obviously knew who Cohen was when he appeared at her ""book signing"" and it's just not spontaneous. Also -- what happened to the song, ""Throw the J**s down the well so my country can be free?"" I heard it prior to the film's release; it really made you think about the convenience anti-semitism provides to some folks and, at the same time, was terribly funny. Much better than the National Anthem sequence at the rodeo. Gone in the R-rated version. Also, warning - the scatological humor in ""Borat"" is just revolting. See the film -- Cohen is amazing. But I'm wondering where he can go from here. I hope his next film has a better editor and is a bit better crafted.",1173312000,6,1529,4.543478260869565

It hard to predict which movies will spark controversy in the media, thing that attack religion such as passion of the christ, or movies such as brokeback mountain.

By far, Borat has always been my favorite. For those who love this character, this movie is hilarious and had me in tears laughing at times.  Some people may not understand that this is humor and are offended by some of Borats comments. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who isn't offended easily.  For those that are, lighten up, it's all make believe. My own son told me he makes fun of Jews throughout the movie but that is his character, a naive, backwards person from a country about 40 years behind the rest of the world.

2351555,3,6302078164,"After seeing ""Borat,"" I would have to say that Sacha Baron Cohen is one of the most brilliant and audacious comedians I've ever seen--a four-way cross between Peter Sellers, Andy Kaufman, Johnny Knoxville, and Rabelais. But I also have no desire, at least right now, to ever see this film again. As with some of Richard Pryor's concert films, ""Borat"" makes us laugh partly in pleasure, partly in shock, and partly in embarrassed recognition of the foibles of humankind, of which the entire audience, of course, are members. But whereas Pryor merely gave his observations of America as he saw it, Baron Cohen travels the U.S. disguised as Borat to record the less-than-enlightened opinions of the various Americans he meets. In the cases of elected officials, fundamentalist ministers and other self-styled official spokesmen for American culture, he hoists them fairly by their own petards (the homophobic rodeo manager is the best case in point). I was less comfortable, however, with his forays on the private citizens who were only trying to be nice to a foreigner, and who would have remained anonymous forever if it weren't for Baron Cohen/Borat. Even Borat's biggest fans have to admit he's an agent provocateur of grotesque proportions. Was it really necessary to regale formal dinner guests in Atlanta with bags of (putatively) his own feces? And while I don't really like being in the position of defending drunken frat boys, those particular drunken frat boys were trying to be kind to Borat, and all non-habitual drunks tend to say and do things in private that would never translate to their behavior when sober and in the outside world. There are parts of ""Borat"" that I consider as hilarious as anything ever put on film: I never thought anyone would beat Mel Brooks' evisceration of anti-Semitism in the ""Springtime for Hitler"" sequence of ""The Producers,"" but darned if Baron Cohen doesn't do it with ""The Running of the Jew."" However, too much of the film in my opinion amounts to sabotage on innocent private citizens. My guess is that I would have made like the one New Yorker Borat approached, and run away from him. Now that I've seen his movie, I'd run twice as fast.",1173312000,9,2189,4.902964959568733

2351557,2,6302078164,"""Borat"" is like a car crash that draws in the lowest common denominators. It's like Cohen had a brain cramp and figured the best way to stretch his tv material into a movie was to remove the more clever ideas and add more boorishness and vulgarity (which he also seemed to do with the Ali G. movie.) Sadly i think the reason this movie did so well in this country is that many of the people that he was trying to make fun of didn't get his jokes. If anything, he overestimated the intelligence of the American public. How else can you explain two terms with the worst president ever and morally reprehensible war. Then again, maybe Cohen did know what he was doing. Either way, the joke is on us Americans. Perhaps we'll wake up and see what a mess we've made  once the housing and stock markets collapse.

Checkout was a breeze, and within 10 minutes of my purchase time, my internet-connected TiVo began downloading the movie and was finished in about an hour.

I also went to my Media Library and sent Borat to one of my bedroom TiVo's also!  It's a wonderful and convienient new service!  I can't wait until Amazon's movie catalogue becomes substantially larger!

If the immense popularity of a mock-umentary film like `Borat' ('06) isn't a sign of the impending demise of Western Civilization then I don't know what is. Lewd, crude, demeaning and repulsive are just a few of the words that come to mind when I recall viewing this movie. Oh yes I forgot, not funny. It reminds me of the now defunct `Tom Green Show' that aired on MTV several years ago, it has that same type of documentary style in your face humor with Tom acting weird in public and freaking people out. `Borat' is kind of like Tom Green with an accent. There are a few funny sequences like the gypsy tears bit at a yard sale and the Mr. Jesus material was enjoyable, but the good moments are very few and far between.

I've been told that I'm completely missing the point of the movie. It's supposed to be offensive, afterall it's pointing out societal norms and beliefs that are in and of themselves offensive. That's the point. I get the point and I'm not against scathing political or social satire, I just didn't enjoy this attempt.

However, I would like to point out to the people who hated this movie:

(1) The anti-Semitic, sexist, racist, misogynist, etc. jokes were obvious satire.

(2) The movie does not defame Kazakhstan. Borat and the depiction of Kazakhstan is obviously fictional.

(3) The movie does not defame the U.S. However, some bigots in the movie succeeded in defaming themselves. Bigots we have all over the world not only in the U.S. (I grew up outside of the U.S./Sweden). Hopefully everone understands that. Also some people came out quite sympathetic.

Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat, a native of Kazakstan and also a reporter from that country who comes to America in the hopes of learning something constructive to take back and apply to his own culture.  What the film really does is show a hilarious, if often times disturbing and yet comical view of American culture through Borat's eyes.  From his purchase of an ""auto car"" to falling in love with Pamela Anderson after watching an episode of Baywatch, it was fun to follow him through his journey from New York to California.  Cohen is great because he makes the character he plays very believable.  Whether it was the Rodeo, the Bear they bought for protection or the etiquette lessons, the film was highly entertaining.  This kind of humor is not for everyone but I know people who would have found some of it to be a turn off still ended up laughing a lot.  Borat holds nothing back and in the meantime explores everything from run down neighborhoods to evangelical church meetings.

2351565,4,6302078164,"I have finally seen Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, and it was very funny.  It is not, as some people have said, one of the greatest comedies ever made, nor it is particularly good satire.  Many scenes are really just done to provoke people, and this they do very well.  It's not very difficult to offend southerners (or anyone else for that matter) when you bring a prostitute to their house, or when you take a dump and bring it down in a bag, or the scene where Borat and his producer run through a hotel naked.  Most of the targets here are quite easy, and there really isn't any wit here at work.  With that said, there are many hilarious scenes, like the opening segment, the driving instructor (who is very funny himself), the weather man (who manages to upstage Borat), Borat's insulting of the feminists, and the camraderie Borat has with some bruthas in the hood.  It may be interesting to note that Borat's encounters with black people in the film are the most congenial, as they are very nice to him and treat him well.  His meetings with white people are usually hostile and confrontational.  This is a film worth seeing, but it's not a revolutionary comedy or anything of the sort.  We probably won't see another Borat film (at least not like this one), because everyone's in on the joke now.  Just a note--for those wishing to see/hear Borat's legendary ditty ""Throw the Jew Down the Well"" and see his ""Jew Hunting"" segment with a Texas hunter, those are NOT in this film.  They are part of the Ali G. show, where this character originated.  The film is worth seeing, definitely, but probably just once, maybe twice...",1173139200,7,1686,4.620805369127517

***May contain spoilers***

But let me say that when I got my Borat DVD in the mail today (how I love Amazon deliveries the day DVDs are available - and with super saver shipping no less) I was a little confused.  I opened the package, and found a DVD covered by your usual sleeve promoting its highlights like any other you might buy in the US.  Then, I eagerly slipped the plastic-covered DVD out of the sleeve, turned it over to read the back, started reading and wait... what? or rather, CHTO? because the entire DVD cover is in Russian.

Now, I read Russian.  And I have purchased pirated DVDs for $2 at Moscow metro stations because that is pretty much what you do when you're in Russia. So the fact that I examined this DVD case for a good 5 minutes, opened it to find what looks like a DVD-R disc with ""Borat"" labeled in permanent marker and seriously considered the possibility that somehow a pirated DVD had been sent by Amazon... finally, of course, I realized that the whole thing was a joke.  Possibly even funnier to me than any single joke in the film.  The giveaway was the single slip of paper inside promoting more films you can buy from the US and A that are legal in kazakhstan...

Anyway. Now all I have to do is go to Russia and purchase an ACTUAL pirated version to compare!

This is the only plot of the film, and it is irrelevant to its purpose. Borat has benefited from the truth that there is no such thing as bad publicity. The controversial film will offend just about everyone with its anti-Semitic, racist, misogynist, homophobic, and anti-Christian humor. To me the problem with the film was not its vulgarity, which was plenty bad, but that the film simply wasn't funny, and that's a problem for a comedy. Some of Borat was staged, and other parts were real life ambushes of unsuspecting people; the directors will not say which parts are which.

Before anyone else says it the film itself is not racist, Cohen is himself Jewish, and as most of the gags are at their expense its clear hes just trying to provoke a reaction from the people in the film.  The controversy coming from Kazakhstan was also ridiculous as no one in their right mind believes their country is actually like this, he could have put his finger on the map and picked any small middle eastern country for Borat, it is indeed just a joke.

All in all a superb comedy following on from the great tv series, and while it is clear that Cohen picked his targets well (ie the rodeo and all the hicks that came with it), its important to know that people like this do exist, and the idiots who are now trying to sue him for making them look stupid in the film only have themselves to blame.

Of course, in real life we cannot talk and behave like Borat but the movie does capture the spirit of life in America and what it is like to be an immigrant.
For example, when he introduced himself on the streets and in the metro.... It is so touching. Every immigrant goes through this kind of awkward introduction, although nobody carries a chicken in their suitcase.
And the music is just awesome - it is a gipsy music but it is very touching, romantic and emotionally moving.

2351600,1,6302078164,"Wow. I guess being hip to offensiveness is the new cool.

It seemed fitting that upon arriving home after I saw this movie I

channel surfed past a Comedy Channel ""roast"" of Pamela Anderson. In

that ode to maximizing the ratio of dollars earned per ounce of IQ

present, several people - some famous - pulled out all the stops (one

surmises there were no stops left to pull) to scrape through the barrel

bottom to reach previously unplumbed depths of mean-spirited, profane

puerility. It's hard to call it humour.

Borat slides right in to that same vein. Or does it?

When I found myself laughing constantly and often uncontrollably

through ""There's Something about Mary"" I figured then that I could be

as caught up in potty humour as much as anyone. Borat, however, goes

well beyond ""Mary's"" silly and simple sight gags (related often to the

middle third of the human body). In that movie, the humour is based

upon two factors: the reaction to the initial gag, and also the

viewer's realization of their reaction to the gag - they laugh a second

time at themselves when they realize they laughed at such silly stuff.

Monty Python was often similar.

Borat, in contrast, works off a very different premise.

First of all, it is about deception. Sure it ""pokes fun"" at attitudes

towards others. In the global scheme of things of over 6 billion

""others"", Cohen leaves us with the suggestion that the way to deal with

diversity is ridicule. Cohen suggests that the ridicule need not stop

when one is invited into anothers house for dinner - it's OK to leave a

turd beside your plate on the way out. That'll fix 'em so they can all

be like... like.... who? Which of the >6 billion is the correct model

that we should all follow?

I don't believe that Cohen and the rest of the production team was out

to provide moral guidance or even point out anomalies in our society. I

think it's likely that he was simply out to be as ridiculously

offensive as possible and choosing the race, moral, cultural & religious subjectswas simply the vehicle for doing that and, besides, harming animals is against the law.

As for the rating (1 out of 10), I had considered initially rating it

much higher. The logic goes like this: It provoked me into thinking

deeply about my reaction -> thought-provoking cinema is a good thing ->

forces a re-examination of both what I know and my moral foundation ->

reinforces (or not) my personal moral beliefs -> I should be thankful

to the film-maker.

Ultimately, however, it made me think: What does this really say about

our society and how much we value other people and diversity of views

and cultures? This is rhetorical but it's not even the movie

itself that most concerns me but the effusive reaction to it from paid

critics and its box-office popularity. But then, they effused over Eyes Wide Shut as well.

What does it say that we honour a person simply because they have a

pathologically low level of inhibition and decency? That we would place

such a person in the same league - through awards - as the true cinema

artists simply because he pushes the envelope of offensiveness? In our

society, we view this as being behaviour to strive for and worth

rewarding? Now that I have seen the movie I can question why Cohen was

even nominated - much less having won - at the Golden Globes.

Best actor? He has the range of a toddler trying to hit the toilet he

is sitting on.

Similarly, that the Academy would nominate anything about this film for

an Oscar - best adapted sceenplay...? What screenplay?

download it or whatever. Don't pay anyone a cent to watch it.",1171584000,19,3705,4.57557251908397

Yes he meets a number of intolerant idiots but most people he pranks are just trying to be nice to him. Most of the leftist dolts who review this film see it as an expose of the bigotry of America. This is pure nonsense. When Cohen previously did the same shtick in England he got very similar responses from his victims. Imagine if ""Borat"" were to enter a mosque in an arab country (or perhaps even in the U.S.) and present the Muslims there with intolerant comments about Jews. Now then you would hear much more more than bigotry from his subjects. You would hear death threats and assurances of violence against Jews. Homosexuals? Women? Islams attitudes in theses areas would be quite shocking. Immediate death to homosexuals is the Korans answer actually carried out in Muslim nations, not just just some stupid and intolerant joking about harming them and for chattel-women  the acceptable prescription is beatings and worse.

It pokes fun, in some cases more extreme than others, for our benefit.  If we're paying 8 and in some cases even 10 dollars to see a movie, we expect to see something hilarious!

Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is raunchy, crass, and often the character Borat is racist and sexist, and yet it always makes you laugh.  While many laughs comes from Borat's statements and questions, many more come from the responses of the real life people involved, such as the scene where Borat asks a car dealer if he has a car good for running down gypsies.

2. It is significant that Politically Correct Hollywood has now awarded one of its Oscar Nominations for this Politically Incorrect movie. Since the end of the Cold War - which the capitalist USA won and the communist Soviet union lost - Hollywood has lost its moral anchors and, consequently, now its Academy has become inconsistnt with its evaluations.

3. Moreover, its also significant that the dumb-founded American media have not commented on this phenomenon (neither on the left, nor on the right).

Finally, very few Americans seem to care about the fact that the Kazakhi in Kazakhstan have been deeply offended by this movie, which was not even filmed in Kazakhstan, but in Rumenia, showing once more that many Americans do not know where Central Asia is situated (NOT in Eastern Europe). Their high school education is severely deficient in global geography. And this USA is supposed to lead the world? No wonder that a lot of foreigners are becoming raving mad with this Hollywoodesque ignorance and arrogance.

We are also shown a very sick, dark side of America, such as at the bullriding event, where an old cowboy shows how anti-gay he is and basically agrees with Cohen ( in character, of course, as Borat) that gays should be killed. We also hear the cries of the crowd when Borat says he supports the war 'of terror' ( no one seems to pick up on the fact that he says ' of terror'n as the crowd screams in agreement. Just showing how stupid some parts of this country are...).

If you are Jewish, just know when you go into the film that Cohen himself is; there are a lot of anti Jewish jokes/comments, but they are done on purpose by Cohen.

One of the saddest, but educational, moments of the film for me is when Borat hitches a ride with some college students. The boys are absolutely gross, and are the epitomy of stupid frat guys. They basically state that they want to screw loads of chicks and would never date any of them, and want them to kind of be slave-esque. They then say that they would never have any respect for the chicks they sleep with.

I am a chick, and I am NOT some feminist, but I went to a hockey school in Minnisota when I was living in the States, and the guys at this school ( it was a high school and middle school, btw) were EXACTLY the same; many of the young girls were severly sexually harassed. I myself was backed into a corner by two huge sadistic hockey players who would not let me leave until I 'put out'.luckily a teacher came, as if they hadn't who knows.

Sacha Baron Cohen deserves a whole lot of credit for really putting his life in danger just to make people laugh.

Myself, I think this is an instant comedy classic.  I can't remember the last time I gasped and laughed so much at a single movie.  ""Blazing Saddles""?  The acting, the writing and the wonderful timing of the opening scenes in Borat's village were hysterical.

I thought Sacha Baron Cohen was a genius when I saw his Ali G show on HBO.  I'd resisted watching it for a long time because--like all the people in each segment of his show--I thought these idiots (Ali G, Borat, Bruno) were real.

2351628,4,6302078164,"This movie is extremely funny, in a ""JACKASS"" sort of way, but comedy is dangerous and for two good reasons: (1)what we laugh at often reveals who we are; (2) comedy misplaced is offense, and woe unto him ""from whom offense cometh.""

For example, is it funny, really funny, to learn that some Southern frat boys are racist?  Is it funny that we, with our experience of American history, have to LEARN that they are racist?  What might we have learned if Borat had pulled the same stunt at a Northern school?  I am certain we would have learned something there, too, really learned, for instance, that a certain kind of racism, if that is what you want to call it, shows up not just in the south--but alas the filmmaker has to make choices, so why not learn what we already know--let's go with the old stereotype about southerners and let it play out as ""surprising"" and ""revealing.""  But it is funny--I just don't know for sure why I'm laughing because, see, it's kind of a dumb, mean-sprited ""Candid Camera"" if viewed in a different light.  I'm sort of ashamed that I'm laughing, but I AM laughing.

Second, Borat pretends to be a foreign national and the nation in question, Kazakhstan, is disturbed by his portrayal of them.  My first impulse is to say--get a life.  It's humor.  It's funny.  It's as innocent as . . . blackface.  Yeah.  Someone of a different (superior) ethnicity/nationality is merely dressing up as you (silly, quaint, backward idiots) and prancing around poking fun at your foibles and mannerisms to get a cheap laugh.  This is very funny stuff, and here is the proof: when the same kind of humor was done based on African Americans starting back in the late 1880s and 1890s and carried over into the twentieth century, everybody got a real kick out of it, even the silly, quaint, backward, African American idiots who were being spoofed to provide the cheap laugh.  Yeah, right.  How funny would ""BORAT"" be if it was about a white man in blackface, shucking and jiving-talking through Europe and Asia as a representative American journalist trying to find sexy white European girls to play on his big black meatpole?  That would be very funny, too, but I don't think such a film could be made today.  African Americans wouldn't stand for it (I wonder why?).  And if the star of that mythical film were actually a white-skinned Muslim Arab from, say, Iraq (yeah, an Iraqi in blackface, pretending to be a black American journalist in Europe looking for white European girls to sleep with), I don't think even white Americans (patriots that they be) would stand for that.  Do you see where I'm going with this?

In all honesty, my point is that Borat is indeed very funny, but risky.  It is Candid Camera, Jackass, and Blackface all rolled up in one.  If you are in the right mood and you get the joke, then there is nothing funnier. Just don't be surprised if you're the only one laughing.  On the other hand, if you find yourself in a group where everyone is laughing, then be afraid.  Be very afraid.",1169164800,9,3026,4.600746268656716

I've never seen Sasha Baron Cohen's ""Ali-G"" Show on HBO, but his ""Borat"" character from the show did just fine in his own feature-length movie.  Much of the tale of Borat's (a Kazakh journalist's cultural adventures in the US) was unscripted, as Americans he encountered were led to believe that Borat was a legitimate journalist. Their reactions are understandable in some cases (as when Borat tries to kiss male strangers in the ""traditional"" Kazakh way in the subway), and just plain scary in others (as when the gun dealer recommends ""a gun to kill Jews with"").  The result is almost non-stop hilarity, from the Running of the Jews in Borat's hometown in Kazakhstan, to his rendition of the Kazakh national anthem (""oh glorious exporter of potassium"") at a Virginia rodeo.  The movie features a lot of bathroom humor (much of it very graphic), sex humor (all talk) and hairy male body humor (much of it just gross), but you never know what's coming next--somehow it's all both direct and subtle enough to keep you both grossed out and guessing.  I wondered if Pamela Anderson knew what was coming as Borat finally catches up to the fantasy love object he sees an episode of Baywatch on his hotel TV (the word is that she did).

Many people told me not to see this movie, but I decided to see what it was all about.

As a Jew, I was very uncomfortable with the scenes about Jews; I found myself looking around to see how many people were laughing when I wasn't laughing.  I was not laughing at religious jokes.

I could not help it - I wondered if those who weren't laughing were being politcally correct, and/or were Jews, too.  Those who did laugh made my skin crawl.

My only deep concern is what many view as Antisemetic material in the movie. Those who were Antisemetic when they walked in may not change.  It would certainly be wonderful if they did change in droves upon viewing their absurdity and cruelty to their fellow human beings on the big screen.

In the end, I think I got what Cohen was doing:  Many Americans view themselves as so sophisticated and superior, that we laugh, look down upon, and/or feel we have the right to invade others we feel need our, ""help,"" or threaten us because we don't do our homework about the outside world.

Those who weren't in on the joke showed, unfortunately, the real America. Who are we to poke fun, etc., at so-called backward, or, ""Third World"" countries?

As a person who appreciates potty humor, this was some of the best stuff since Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles, and many of my fellow Americans (and I'm far from perfect) need a lecture about innumerable subjects, and this movie delivered it for those who paid attention.",1168732800,2,1662,4.452145214521452
2351637,3,6302078164,"I find this an excruciatingly difficult film to rate and review.  In its short lifespan in the public realm it has tended to polarize viewers into a camp that has dramatically overestimated its virtues and one that absurdly exaggerates its vices.  I belong somewhere in between.  I have often been impressed with the talents of Sacha Baron Cohen in the past, but have not always been convinced that they were being employed in a worthy manner.  I have often laughed my head off at Ali G., only to ask myself later, ""What was the point?""  I can't help but wonder if there is a degree of cynicism underlying his work.  Much of his work depends on fooling other people into thinking this utter idiot he is portraying, whether Ali G., Borat, or Br&uuml;no, really exists.  Many of the interviews we are shown end up incredibly truncated, no doubt because those he is interviewing either walk away or see through his act.  Only rarely does someone figure him out and then join in (check out his interview as Ali G. of Pat Buchanan, who quickly figures him out when he asks whether or not Saddam had BLT's and Pat says that in fact Saddam used BLT's on his own people).  Who are we supposed to laugh at in these films and sketches?  Are we ever laughing with anyone, or only at people?  Sometimes we are clearly laughing at Borat and with Cohen at his creation.  But very frequently we end up laughing with the people populating his movie.  I had a great deal of trouble enjoying these scenes in the movie.

It doesn't help that we can't always figure out when everyone in the scene is in on what is happening.  For instance, it is quite clear that Pamela Anderson was perfectly aware she was in a movie at the movie's end.  And the woman playing the prostitute who agrees to marry him at the end of the film obviously had to be in on the joke.  But it isn't clear that the owner of the antique store was aware.  If the owner wasn't aware, the grief Borat's antics caused anguish that I simply find unpleasant and if he was aware, it was simply not a very funny scene.  There were too many such moments in the movie.

Despite these misgivings, however, there is no question that Cohen does an astonishing job as Borat.  He is gifted on so many levels:  he is a tremendous physical comedian, somewhat reminiscent of another tall graduate of Cambridge University, John Cleese.  He also has an astonishing gift for improvisation both in scripted and unscripted scenes.  Anyone who has seen him as Ali G. knows how he can make amazing adjustments with those he is interacting with.  And his ability to stay in character is a ceaseless wonder.  He is also a genuinely funny man.  I actually regret that all too often he seems more intent on seeing how far he can take things rather than trying to be funny, but he still manages to be incredibly funny in scene after scene.

But, once again, to what purpose?  Many have referred to this as social satire, but I can't acknowledge that it ascends to that level.  There is no doubt that he wants us to see America as being as strange as we find Borat and he certainly finds a number of incredibly quirky people.  The scene in which he has dinner with a dining club the South illustrates this perfectly.  Despite his absolutely bizarre behavior, he somehow manages to make the diners look as bizarre as he does.  In the end, it doesn't reach the genuinely satiric levels of Albert Brooks or Neil LaBute, but neither does it become something that merely mines the gross and bizarre for laughs like HAROLD AND KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE.

By the end of the film I had winced a lot, groaned a bit, and shook my head in discomfort, but I also laughed very, very hard on many occasions.  I don't know if this adds up to a recommendation or not, but I can honestly say that except for the Borat skits on DA ALI G.

In a post-modern twist, we laugh at the morons who enjoy this humor (us) as the same time we laugh at the movie.

where this film works in comparison to say the ali g movie is that it is relatively plot free.  whereas the former unwisely tried to pidgeonhole the character, here the premise is flimsy.  our hero travels to the us with his manager (who does a mean oliver hardy impression), falls in love with pamela anderson and travels to the west coast to meet and marry her, changeing people's lives as he goes.

where it works too is by exposing this crude, ignorant buffoon to an unsuspecting public and focussing on their reactions of disgust, horror, bemusement, sympathy or agreement (to be fair, the ali g show did something on similar lines).  sure its been done before but not to the twin aims of getting laughs and revealng certain people for what they really are.  off guard we see an appallingly racist/ homophobic (and seemingly, after the furore/ lawsuits this film has generated, unapologetic) rodeo manager and some drunken fratboys revealed to be, well, idiots basically.

gloriously funny throughout (and i think stopped before the joke wore thin).  one scene which has been mentioned by other reviewers had me laughing so hard i thought i was going to throw up (you probably know the scene i'm talking about).  other highlights include the rodeo scene (wonder how many people in the audience did a double take on hearing 'war of terror'), which included an incredibly funny faux-kazakhstani national anthem sung to the tune of the star spangled banner (""all other countries are run by little girls"" indeed).  its a wonder that girl managed to stay on her horse as long as she did.  hysterical too is the guy who runs from borat on approach - premonition circuits on full blast there.  i admit on first viewing i was slightly disappointed he didn't do much to the christians.  after watching it again though i realised the truth...they're doing it to themselves.

Cohen is a 'comedian' who makes his living by betraying people's trust and demeaning them; his formula is to scrape the barrel through pandering to the worst instincts in marginalized folks who revel in seeing OTHERS as fools.  This, of course, is the last resort of unfunny  comedians; actually, Cohen is a jester, rather than a comedian and is probably incapable of creating a genuinely funny, open-hearted and entertaining product.

In short, this film belongs to the Jackass genre by having nothing to say and sinking to the lowest common denominator.  It cynically masquerades itself as 'a fight against intolerance, racism and ignorance', while in reality representing a textbook example of media opportunism. Basically, it combines pseudo-outrageousness, bad art and lack of acting talent to get two minutes in the limelight for a guy whose claim to fame is that he has no social inhibitions.

2351648,4,6302078164,"I went into this having heard about Borat but never actually having seen any of the skits.  I must say that for the most part this movie was really funny.

This is the story of Borat, a Kazakh, who is sent to America to learn America's ways and bring them back to Kazakhstan.  This is a mockumentary, where they mimic the style of a documentary.  While in America Borat seeks out Pamela Anderson to be his new bride after he learns of his wife's death.  Borat crosses America to get to Los Angeles in search of bride to be and gets into ridiculous situations one after another.

Some of the skits of the movie are as follows:

Borat on the subway where it pretty much shows that all New Yorkers are overly hostile pricks.  With the U.N. located right in the heart of this overly bitter city no wonder we have the problems we do.

Borat going to comedy counselor who has got be the unfunniest person possible.  How can this guy possibly teach humor?

Borat going to see the feminists, Give me a smile pussycat

Borat calling a fat hooker to come uninvited to an extremely conservative southern dinner party.

The list goes on and on with situations where things could not be going worse but people simply take it very politely (except NY) because they think this guy is foreign and simply does not know what he is doing is wrong.  The only part I had a problem with was when he was at the Jewish Guest House.  I understand what Cohen, a devout Jew, was trying to do with these types of skits but this one was off target.

I think Cohen's type of comedy is also an important social tool and exposes people's ignorance and bigotry.  So if these people say something stupid on camera, get overly offended, or are made to look ridiculous then so be it.

I am pretty open to any type of sense of humor, even if its at the expense of others or myself. That is why it is called humor.

So the movie is about this man who travels across America trying to learn the culture but then it turns into a search for Pamela Anderson in California. Along the way, they stop by at different cities, learning about the different people living there.

Sure, the entire movie is about poking fun of homosexuals, women, blacks, Jews, etc. but it doesnt entirely call for so much controversy. The jokes aren't even that funny, and sometimes the movie is a little boring.

2351652,5,6302078164,"Sacha Baron Cohen is the most fearless comedic presence I've ever seen.  I don't believe there is anything he would not do, and he pulls off some of the most offensive antics by adding such naivite, he's almost endearing as he is shocking.  This is not for the faint of heart, mind you.  Satire is not meant to be warm and fuzzy or easily swallowed; those who cannot wrap their minds around this idea need to stick with The Santa Clause 3 or some other such inane, mindless comedy.  If you enjoy People Magazine and Bill O'Reilly, you'll want to skip this one.  However, if you like Jon Stewart's Daily Show and The Onion, this will be right up your alley.

Another word on the ""offensive, anti-Semetic"" nature of this movie.  Mr. Cohen is JEWISH and the majority of his ""Kazakhstani"" dialogue is Hebrew (along with some Polish).  His humor is meant to expose the anti-Semitisim in the world, the jingoistic manuvering world-wide that is isolating nations, how blindly people will follow the party line and perpetuate stereotypes by failing to have independent thought.  This is no different than Dave Chappelle or Chris Rock slamming black culture or Carlos Mencia thrashing Hispanics -- when you insult your own culture, it's usually to expose both racism by others and the self-sabotage that perpetuates such garbage.  People ask, ""Why aren't there more black jokes by Borat?""  Easy -- because that would be offensive and beyond the point of the whole exercise.  Notice that very little has been said by the Anti-Defamation League or other Jewish cultural groups.  They understand the point of this movie; why should we be so quick to ""save"" them, as if they weren't capable of analyzing this on their own.  That in itself is offensive, in my eyes.

So, is you're looking for a great diversion that is unlike any movie you've ever seen, this is your kind of movie.  If you're narrow-minded and fail to realize progress often comes from exposing our own shortcomings, stay home and watch Everybody Loves Raymond.",1166486400,17,2014,4.811046511627907
2351653,2,6302078164,"Curiosity drove this viewer to see BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN.  Especially when the Golden Globe nominations  pegged both the film and the star as candidates for potential honors!!!!  And though many very fine reviewers find this film worthy of praise, the response after viewing the piece in a theater packed with people howling with laughter - again, for this viewer - was one of being appalled.

Comedy is an art, an art that magnifies human foibles and allows a different viewpoint to make even sad aspects of life appear humorous. Dark comedy can be cruel when the writing is acerbically witty and smart.  What BORAT seems to have done is costume and scene change a standup comedy routine bent on grossing out its audience and choosing a demeaning manner instead of a parody to lash out at the multiple groups it attacks, be those the people of Kazakhstan, Pentecostal Holiness churches, drunk sexist/racist teenagers, feminists, businessmen, actors, Jews, homosexuals, rodeo folks, genteel Southerners, TV talk show hosts/weathermen, etc.

Production wise the filming is crude, the storyline is plotted to look as though it were spontaneous candid camera takes (yet credits a long list of writers including Cohen), and the flatline character of Borat is as predictable as the potty mouth humor it accompanies.  But apparently the public wants this type of entertainment on the screens: the film is raking in millions for the effrontery of Sacha Baron Cohen.  Have we really arrived at a state where our choices range from comic book hero flicks to gory slasher flicks to the base, crude, and thoughtless antics of extended comedy hour routines?

I think the reason why there is so much disagreement amongst viewers is because there is a little bit of everything in it... and depending on your tastes, your sense of humor, and your turn of mind, each person will get something different out of it.  To me, that makes it a pretty good film.

However, in aid of being a helpful review, I'll ask this:  Do you like British comedies?  If you do, more than likely, you'll love this.  There's a very British flair to the entire film (yes, I know he's British which is why it has that flair) in that its bawdy and lewd, a bit satiracle with PLENTY of innuendo mixed in with lots of Monty Python-ish slapstick.  If you don't ""get"" British humor, or find it dull because you miss the subtle inside jokes, then you're probably not going to find this funny and will end up being more offended than enlightened and probably should not watch this film.

P.S I know many people were offended by the male nudity, but I for one say BRAVO!  It's about freakin' time!!!!  I'm not one who usually wants a lot of nudity in movies, but I'm so sick and tired of it always being women when it IS in the movie! It's about time for equality!

2351655,5,6302078164,"The plot of this movie is very simple. Borat (Sacha Cohen) and his sidekick Azamat(Ken Davitian) go on a journey across America to learn how to improve their own poor, backwards nation of Kazakhstan.

At first it seems like the jokes will involve mocking the people of this Third World country. But instead the movie quickly evolves into a hilarious and insightful parody of America itself. This is done through a series of laugh out loud comic skecthes, mostly featuring regular folks being secretly filmed during their interactions with Borat. These scenes  include a Southern dinner party, a group of drunken frat boys and a Pentecostal church. But what makes this movie so brillant is that it is never afraid to take chances and to skewer ""sacred cows"" in order to both get laughs and to make intelligent social commentary on just how much bigotry and ignorance still exists within American society.

There used to be great comics, like Richard Pryor and Lenny Bruce, who were willing to risk offending their audience in order to challenge social hypocrisy and question the status quo. But nowadays political correctness has cowed so many comedians into boring and irrelevant humor. Thankfully we have Sacha Cohen to ask the tough questions about race, gender, religion, sex and the many other important and controversial issues facing America today.

2351657,3,6302078164,"I first learned of the character of Borat this past summer from a friend of mine who introduced me to DA ALI G SHOW. I found the sketches that I watched to be rather intriguing and at time quite humorous. Sacha Baron Cohen's portrayal of the faux-Kazakhstanian journalist reminded me of another comedian that I greatly admired, Andy Kaufman. Cohen's Borat most resembles Kaufman's Latka Gravas. However, Borat is a far more crude and rude type of character than Latka ever was.

The movie is ""filmed"" in a grainy, mockumentary style. According to the plot of the film, Borat has been sent to America by the Kazakhstan government to observe the people in the United States and bring back what he learns so that the lives of the Kazakhstan people can be improved by the knowledge he brings back. Borat and his comrade, Azamat Bagato (Ken Davitian) begin their journey in New York City. Actually, they are supposed to stay in New York, but after Borat views an episode of Baywatch on television, he decides he has to go to California to find Pamela Anderson and marry her. Thus begins a cross-country excursion that takes Borat through Georgia and Texas and eventually California. Along the way, Borat stays at a bed & breakfast operated by an elderly Jewish couple, buys a black bear as a guard pet, befriends a prostitute, causes havoc at a local television station, scares children, and offends lots of people.

There are moments when the movie is hilarious and there are other times when the film is quite insightful and becomes an almost brilliant dark satire into the American subconscious. However, more often than not, BORAT (the movie not the character) is so pretentious that it is comes off as being a boring travelogue. There are some very funny bits that occur (the chicken on the subway made me chuckle and I couldn't help but laugh when Borat was able to stand his ground against a group of feminists). There are also some times when the movie shows part of the bigotry that many people in America have, such as when Borat asks a gun owner about which gun is best to kill a Jew, when Borat is talking with an older cowman before a rodeo, and when Borat goes on a drinking spree with some college students. There are people in the United States who still harbor great hatred towards people of different races and religions. But, we already knew that, didn't we. In that sense, BORAT fails as a satire because it doesn't show the audience anything new that we didn't know and it doesn't offer any real suggestions in curing those problems.

There are many moments in BORAT that are intended to be funny and illustrate how backward American people are, but instead of doing that the film illustrates just how kind and giving American people tend to be. While lost in a ""rough"" area of Atlanta, Georgia Borat is befriended by a group of young black men (of course this is later used to show how racist certain hotel people are). While eating dinner at the home of a genteel Southern family, the hosts go out of their way to accommodate Borat and make him feel welcome; they go far and above what people would consider acceptable, but they are good and kind people. In a scene that is meant to be funny, Borat is embraced by a Pentecostal church--despite what one might believe about their religious practices, the people at the church embrace Borat. Even the group of drunken college students, who spout various racist comments, befriend Borat and seek to comfort him during a trying time.

There are also some moments in the movie that are intended to be funny, but have no humour value whatsoever. For instance, there is a scene where Borat and Azamat get into an argument and begin wrestling naked in their hotel room. The wrestling match continues throughout the hotel and into the stage of a conference room of the hotel where a dinner is being held. Apparently, two naked men wrestling with each other in various sexually-suggestive positions is supposed to be laugh-out-loud hilarious. I just didn't get it. It was unnecessary and served no value whatsoever.

Having seen some of the Borat skits from THE ALI G SHOW, having been intrigued by the preview for BORAT, and having heard so much of the hype, I was disappointed by BORAT the movie. It wasn't the laugh-out-loud comedy I thought it was going to be and neither was it the full-blown dark satire I had heard that it was. The film contains elements of both, but the movie doesn't live up to the hype. The film most resembles a SNL movie, but the grainy film style makes it more entertaining than most of those. Many high school and college students will love this film, but unless you're in those crowds are work with them, you probably won't find BORAT very entertaining at all.",1164758400,,4750,4.663484486873508

2351659,5,6302078164,"This is definitely a comedy that lives completely on the edge. Its sheer audacity and fearlessness against public rebuke are admirable to some, repulsive to others. Except for a few groaners, this is one of the most hilariously observant films about global perceptions of the U.S. and an incisive, unguarded account of the prevailing social attitudes and cultural taboos in this country. In a compelling Andy Kaufman-like turn, Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat Sagdiyev, a television commentator from Kazakhstan, here portrayed as the most backward of third-world countries. He has been assigned by his government to travel to the U.S. to make a documentary about American cultural mores.

After introducing us to his country, Borat arrives in Manhattan accompanied by his hefty, worrisome producer Azamat. But there is a change of plan when Borat sets his sights on Pamela Anderson and sets out on a road trip across the country to meet her in L.A. There is no let-up of ridiculous sight gags and maddeningly funny asides during its quickly paced 82-minute running time. Unlike the Pamploma bulls, there is the ""Running of the Jew"" in which the Kazakh villagers attack a couple of giant, papier-mch puppets, Mr. and Mrs. Jew, who in turn lays a giant egg which the local children beat furiously with sticks. Other scenes have Borat erroneously presuming that a hotel elevator is his room and being a semi-attentive student to amazingly tolerant instructors as he gets lessons on comedy, driving and etiquette.

Throughout the movie, Cohen keeps upping the ante and yielding even more comic dividends  - a question to a gun store clerk about the best weapon to kill Jews answered without hesitation; a B&B owned by a kindly Jewish couple which turns into a scene from ""The Blair Witch Project""; a conservative Southern dinner party that gets ugly when Borat invites an overweight black prostitute as his guest; an aging cowboy who lets his bigotry spew freely at the rodeo; a trio of frat boys from South Carolina who enthusiastically share their supremely sexist attitudes; and most infamously, an extended naked wrestling match between Borat and the grotesque Azamat that ends up in a convention of mortgage brokers. All these scenes expose a raw nerve which feels concurrently offensive, truthful and hilariously comic.

Credit needs to go to director Larry Charles, who guides this venture with the same type of deadpan lan he showed with HBO's ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and the screenplay by Cohen, Anthony Hines, Peter Baynham, and Dan Mazer, which lends a loose structure to what seems to be a series of staged scenes with all the non-actors. But above anything else, it's Cohen's major accomplishment that he can make Borat an anti-Semitic, sexist homophobe and still have him come across as an amiable, cheek-kissing fellow full of innocently executed malapropisms. I'm sure the easily offended will continue to express their disgust, but for the more adventurous, brace yourself for a comedy that will make you roar with laughter while giving you that unsettling feeling of recognition. It's quite a trick which Cohen and company pull off superbly.",1164758400,16,3152,5.090909090909091

Borat Sagdiyev is a television talking head from Kazakhstan played by the very clever Sacha Baron Cohen.  But, what the heck, everyone knows this!  You would have to have been living in a cave not to have at least heard of Borat.

The basis of the film is a travelogue of the anarchic Borat travelling across America from east to west ostensibly to film a documentary but also to marry Pamela Anderson.  Along the way, Borat has a series of misadventures.  It is probably the more subtle of these that gave me the biggest laugh.  His thinking that a New York elevator was his hotel room was beautiful.  His shock that a woman could write a book while speaking with a group of feminists was absolutely priceless.  How so many people can be taken in by Borat is simply amazing.  Some people seem to take themselves just a little bit too seriously.

Along the way he falls in love with Pam Anderson and decides that he is destined to marry his dream-women. This is Borat's first time in the US so he isn't used to the customs or modern conveniences (such as a commode that flushes.)

Along the way Borat meets, interviews, and speaks with various Americans. ""Borat"" is a thousand times more vulgar than any other adult-comedy and makes ""South Park"" look like a sweet Disney picture.

I loved when Borat met with the feminist organization in NY and referred to one of the ladies as ""pussycat."" It was pure comedy and so offensive. I don't think this was scripted? Borat's sidekick, Azamat was also very funny. When Borat and Azamat had the nude wrestling match I thought I was going to wet my pants, I never laughed so hard.

Borat takes cheap potshots and Jewish people, homosexual men, women, African American people, and the physically and emotionally handicapped. His ignorant comments are very offensive and make him sound extremely stupid. But as Borat speaks to various other Americans on his journey it is soon apparent that many Americans also share Borat's bigoted views. By the way, I found it very curious that the dinner party guests did not want to end the evening until Borat's African-American date arrived; but everything else he did before that was acceptable? Kind of sad and shocking and really says a lot...

A lot of the scenes must have been scripted, staged, and rehearsed otherwise the movie never could have been made. But it was still funny to see Borat when he tried to ""marry"" Pam Anderson. I am shocked that it only got an R rating. It should at least be rated NC-17; I hate to imagine what was cut out to keep the R rating?",1164585600,81,1837,4.625766871165644
2351662,3,6302078164,"Borat is a film that reinforces a variety of cultural stereotypes, while supposedly shedding light on ignorance. In this way, I think it's real nature and intent are the opposite of what we are meant to think. Borat's approach in this film is similar to the law enforcement technique of entrapment, when overzealous cops or federal agents actually encourage people to break the law. Often, the people they encourage are already inclined in that direction, but in such cases the government is promoting antisocial behavior in the name of fighting it.  Borat similarly eggs on people who may have racist or other politically objectionable attitudes, encouraging them to expose their ignorance. Yet when you really pay attention, it is mainly Borat himself who is expressing ignorance. The humor is supposed to be in the complicity of his victims, but I think the real strategy of the film is to make us laugh at people who we are predisposed to think of as ignorant or racist, such as residents of Southern states. Borat is supposed to be the very antithesis of political correctness, but in a way he actually shows us the dark side of PC, which gives people who think of themselves as urban, liberal, educated or sophisticated the opportunity to laugh at the ignorance of their social inferiors.

  When Borat behaves boorishly in a Southern household where he is supposedly trying to learn the principles of etiquette, or when he denigrates women to a group of feminists, there was really nothing outrageous about the reactions.  When you add to this the uncertainty of whether these scenes were even spontaneous, the impact is further diminished.  I admire the marketing campaign for this movie more than the movie itself. I was led to believe it was a controversial scouring of America at the hands of a brilliant satirist. The only parts that were even remotely shocking were some of the gross-out scenes, but that is hardly uncommon in today's cinema. I'm afraid the social commentary was rather banal. If it had been a real documentary, it would have had more humor and power, but the fuzziness of the mockumentary label means that it doesn't have to be real OR as compelling as good fiction. What I most dislike about this genre is that we never know which parts, if any, are real and which are staged. We can assume several of the more outrageous scenes, as when Borat and his hirsute and overweight assistant are chasing each other nude through a crowded hotel, and when Borat is chasing Pamela Anderson (who he supposedly wants to marry) around a parking lot, are fake; if they had been real, Borat most likely would have been arrested. The examples of mainstream Americans exposing their racism, sexism and homophobia were basically a let-down (which, when you think about it, is probably a good thing). Assuming the people Borat was talking to were speaking unscripted lines (questionable in itself), in most cases they are merely responding to Borat's outrageously offensive words. In the scene where he addresses a rodeo crowd, he first calls out for the death of all Iraqis; many people cheer. Then, instead of singing the American National Anthem, he sings a parody about his own supposed nation. People boo this. I doubted the authenticity of this scene (how did he get permission to sing at this event?), but assuming it was real, there wasn't anything surprising about how this rodeo audience responded to his antics. I have a suspicion that the mockumentary aspect of this film has reached beyond the movie itself. I recently read that the drunk frat boys in the movie are suing the filmmakers for portraying them as ignorant. In the story about this, which I read before seeing the movie, it quoted them as wanting to bring back slavery. In fact, they did not say this in the movie, only that it would be nice to have slaves. This is more than a quibbling over semantics; the point is, there was no racial connotation to the comments, which you would not have known from the story as it appeared in print. Is all this part of the PR for the film? We may never know, but either way it's an example of over-hyping something rather ordinary.

The most you will learn about American culture from this film is that there are still people in the heartland who are less than politically correct in their attitudes, not exactly a bombshell, nor especially hilarious either.  Borat is not a terrible film and it does have some chuckles. The opening scenes of his supposed native land are amusing (if a rather crude rendering of Hollywood stereotypes of the Third World), as are scenes where the pair drive around in a tiny ice cream truck with a pet bear in the back. Overall, it was like a long sketch on Saturday Night Live, with some amusing moments --a decent low-brow road movie with pretensions of  cultural relevance.",1164499200,3,4835,4.787769784172662

3. Integration: While smoothly integrating all scenes, real or otherwise, using the humorous plot device of sexual infatuation, the end result amounts to misintegration rather than authentic integration.

2351665,4,6302078164,"""Borat,"" the twisted comedic gem from the brilliant, alert mind of Sacha Baron Cohen has one thing on its mind: exposing the ugly bigotry still festering just beneath America's seemingly welcoming, cosmopolitan society.  Cohen's antics as clueless and helplessly hateful Kazack reporter filming a documentary about America and searching to wed Pamela Anderson provide different Americans with an assumededly safe launching point to talk freely about their own prejudices.  Cohen also gets in a naked man-fight, rides around with a protective bear, makes out with his sister and pokes fun at the mentally challenged and the Jews, but that is all beside the point.  Cohen's real mission is to make America stare into it's own still prejudiced heart.  A rodeo cowboy in Georgia generalizes all Muslims as terrorists and admits he would want to see every single homosexual hanged, and the rodeo crowd cheers when Cohen says that George Bush should drink the blood of every man woman and child in Iraq.  A bunch of drunk frat boys casually admit slaves in America would be a good thing and that women are dumb, weak and should be subserviant to men, to say nothing of their attitudes toward the Jews.  These exchanges are funny, but in an almost frightening way.  America should have exorcised these flaws long ago, but they still stick around, waiting to rear their ugly head, if they are given the right catalyst of course.  Cohen's strategy does not always work, as some scenes (the dinner in a southern mansion, humor lessons with an Amerian instructor) sacrifice the social satire for more routine laughs about cultural divide.

There is a political theme in the fact that Borat comes a different country and I guess jokes about jews are taboo but the real comedy (the parts were you'll laugh till it hurts)comes from jokes about nudity, bowel movements, and other themes that appeal to the lowest common denominator. Will you laugh, yes. Is it the political satire or ""smart"" comedy the media has made it out to be, no.",1164067200,2,1140,4.331775700934579
2351670,5,6302078164,"Folks, let's get real here. Anyone who believes this sickening swill of gross-out, sophomoric, compilation of cruddy commode humor is some in-depth meaningful satire of American life in the post 9/11 era is as dumb and silly as the people Borat cons into doing and saying ignorant things before the moive cameras and are now suing after signing releases to appear in this cinematic slop for the hogs.

As any functioning human being in Western Civilization in the year of our Lord 2006 AD knows, Borat is a Central Asian dufus who stumbles to America and shocks everyone with his crude and naive behavior, sort of the dark, evil twin of Peter Sellers' character ""Chance"" in ""being There."" The glitch is that Borat (supposedly) goes to real Americans with his stupidity and goads them into saying equally crude and racist things before the camera. Now, in real life, the real people are suing the producers en masse.

Since Borat gets a stuck up Birmingham society group to flip out over inviting a black guest for dinner, gets drunk frastboys from the University of South Caorlina (my alma mater, BTW) to make racist and sexist remaks , gets a gun owner to talk about shooting Jews, gets Alan Keys (remember him?) to comment on gays, et cetera ad naueum, some people think that this somehow makes the film a profound commentary on anti-semitism, racism, homophobia, religious intolerance (although I'm not Pentacostal myself, his cruel mockery of these folks ""speaking in tounges"" would not have been tolerated if it had ""spoofed"" a more mainstream religion). Plus, the portrayal of the Romanian gypsies who were paid a piitance for performing disgusting acts (and who are now suing) is beyond contemptible. Bamboozling supposedly educated Americans who should know better is one thing-to exploit uneduated peasants is just plain shameful!

This is mostly high school potty and bathroom gross-out humor that is not about to change anybody's mind about anything other than having something to eat after seeing this. The deepest message on can find in this film is ""See how disgusting we can be? We want your money!""

Come ON, people! This is NOT any kind of high-level satire filled with deep meaning. Anyone who thinks that is full of what Borat presents to the Birmingham socialite after he leaves the bathroom-as is the case with this movie itself!.",1163980800,5,2351,4.944303797468354
2351671,4,6302078164,"Out of all the supposedly daring, controversial pictures released in 2006 - ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""V For Vendetta"" being two prime examples - here is the movie event of the year, that one must-see picture.

""Borat."" Yes, ""Borat.""

It is not the slickest comedy, and surely not the funniest, but its timely fusion of ingredients - satire, puns, visual gags, verbal gaffes, grossly-gross nudie stuff - make it irresistible and effective. Let's face it: It's the 10-car pileup on the Interstate. Our eyes are wide, our necks are wrenched and our mouths are slack in disbelief.

Officially titled ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,"" the film stars comedian Sacha Baron Cohen as the title character, a wild-looking, anti-Semitic buffoon who plays up every stereotype Americans have about the Third World and Eastern Europe.

Especially the anti-Semitism, which is revealed in an annual Kazak ritual so terrifically offensive (and creative) that writing about it won't do it justice. Several set pieces in ""Borat"" fall into that category. They work solely in the context of the character, not outside him. The best parts of the movie are the kind of satire you have to leave at the theater door.

Doesn't mean you can't go back.

So Borat is sent to New York City with his assistant (Ken Davitian) for cultural reports, and he finds a hostile city unwilling to receive his customary greeting of a kiss. His work there is unsuccessful. Then he sees Pamela Anderson on ""Baywatch,"" finds out she lives in Malibu, Calif., and treks across the country in a used ice cream truck with his assistant. And a pet bear.

He makes stops, mostly in the South, on his way to California. In scenes that Cohen and director Larry Charles insist are real, Borat appears on a morning show, sings at a rodeo and breaks up a Southern dining club by inviting an overweight black prostitute named Lunell.

Some of ""Borat"" really is a crass reworking of ""Candid Camera,"" as this fictional reporter, through innocent, Third World ignorance, forces his subjects to confront his skewed morality or cheerfully join him. A couple do, including some fraternity members in an RV. If there is one scene that feels forced in ""Borat,"" it's this one. These guys seem to be cranking up their misogyny a few too many decibels.

But one sequence is hilariously real, and that's a nude wrestling match between Cohen and Davitian, who is, well, a big man. The two are fighting WWE-style - except that it's no act - and I've never seen anything ? quite ? like ? it. It works on three levels: As a shock fest, a study in fight dynamics and a play on the homophobic Borat's complete willingness to engage in the grapple.

What we're seeing is the id run amok, a movie that pretends as if children grew into full-size adults within the first 10 years of their lives, lacking an understanding in subversion and dark corners of the human heart. That's deep talk for what seems like such a goofy movie, but comedy occasionally does what drama cannot by throwing truth on a tilt to bring a shaded corner into light.

We know that ""Borat"" is after more than cheap laughs because chunks of it just don't work. For me, anyway. The Pam Anderson material is dumb and overdone, but then, I'm no fan of Anderson. The dinner party sequence was lame, and Cohen is a little needlessly mean. If Jews want to accuse Cohen, who is Jewish, of self-hate, they could, but his use of anti-Semitism mostly highlights its stupidity.

In other words, it's not searching, as most American comedies do, for a lowest common denominator, but erecting its own standard upon which to be judged. Cohen is a cagey, clever talent; while ""Borat"" is often improvised, the comedian had to map out these targets and create a humor that could survive the length of a feature film and not just a skit.

""Borat"" called its shot, slugged it into the cheap seats and just introduced us to the next year's No. 1 Halloween costume. Very nice, Mr. Cohen. Very nice.",1163980800,5,4023,4.73
2351672,5,6302078164,"Borat proves to be the Python of our generation.

I say this as a die-hard Monty Python fan - not because the humour is on the same level or follows the same guidelines (in fact, the common ground is here is that it follows no guidelines) - but because both comedy teams mask their sketches in a feature film, passing them off as a story when it becomes glaringly clear that the latter is an elaborate pretext under which to have outrageous, absurdist and side-splittingly fun in a series of genius gags.

Yet for all of Borat's subsequent disorganisation and warped narrative, we are first served a gorgeously condensed introduction to our character in his village in Kazakhstan. This segment was possibly the biggest crowd-pleaser in my theatre and perhaps rightly so, for I would call it the film's goldmine in terms of sheer laugh-out-loud humour. Here we are introduced to Borat's sister (""She is number-four prostitute in whole of Kazakhstan.""), whom he kisses on the mouth, his main interests (ping-pong, sunbathing and ""watch ladies make toilet"") as well as a wide variety of hilarious native Kazakhs. Undoubtedly the success of the introduction stems from a combination of novelty and a culture shock.

Once the sprawling surge of Kazakhstani culture subsides, Borat flies to New York City to make a movie-film about the glorious US and A. The booming Russian ethnic score melts into Harry Nilsson's ""Everybody's Talking' At Me"" and the film gets ambitious: it spoofs Jon Voight's incongruous cowboy character walking down Manhattan in Midnight Cowboy (1969). This I found a pleasant surprise, but the referential spoofs end here and the rest is all Sasha Baron Cohen - and we couldn't be happier.

The second half of Borat is arguably less compelling. It is hard to tell why, for the humour remains consistently good and there is an almost exponential stupidity with our Borat character as the sets out to go to California to marry Pamela Anderson. I would not go as far as to say the novelty ""wears off"", but we are a little more settled now and Borat has found his safe footing. Next, however, the film totally floors whatever safeness you may have with one of the most unspeakably graphic hotel room scenes I have ever seen. I won't give anything away, but rest assured that some viewers (*males*) will watch in horrified silence while others will literally cramp up from laughing so violently. I belong more to the latter category.

As Borat travels through America, there is a wealth of juxtapositions to be found when he interacts with the people - members of the white house, television broadcasters, etiquette teachers, Christian fundamentalists and Jews - all offers layered hilarity and a consistent cloud of laughter kept hovering in the air. Sadly, it was not always directed toward Borat (but most of the time) but toward some truly idiotic hick Americans. When I was informed the film used many candid takes, I can only hope the unreasonably creepy Jesus convention was *not* one of them.

In conclusion, ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006)"" is a towering comedy achievement. It is apparent that Sasha Baron Cohen has done something truly cool here and has created an anti-semitic, misogynist and bigoted character that aptly embodies all racy taboos. As an actor he is unmistakably brave and uninhibited, which makes it easy for the film to lose itself in a tornado of gags, spoofs, bizarre one-liners and graphic jokes. The most fun I've had in a theatre since...forever!!!",1163808000,6,3555,4.9463986599664995
2351673,4,6302078164,"First and foremost, if you are a parent of a child under 18 spare yourself the anguish and kicking yourself in the rear by not taking your kids to see this,  The same goes for everyone who thinks they'll be offended by it; chances are you will be offended.  In the theatre I saw Borat in, half the audience was laughing or on the floor while the more conservative audience (usually non-college student adults and older viewers) berated us for laughing at the racial and sexist jokes that clutter Borat.

I will admit, Borat goes well over the top in both crude humor and imagry.  The one scene that comes to mind involves wrestling between a naked Borat and his overly obese producer... who is also naked and the fight tends to meander... a lot.  At this point I covered my eyes (while laughing hysterically) and kept demanding the movie Gods to make it stop.  The showing of the full-frontal nudity in males happens twice and while it is seemingly hysterical to myself and other Cohen fans, the general audience in the theatre just gagged or walked out.

As for being whitty and satiracle, I found Borat to be hilarious.  I will not say American culture involves inherant violence and desires to kill all people of Iraq (as Borat more or less ""proved"" during the Rodeo scene), but he certainly brought out the worst in everyone he encountered.  The scene where he visits a gun shop to get ""protection from Jews,"" the owner just stands there and changes the subject.  Many saw this as condoning the act when the guy was simply trying to be polite and not cause any trouble.

Borat does a great job of taking social norms and taboos and throwing them right into the face of Americans.  For instance, he tries to be friendly on a subway only to be threatened by everyone he encounters and given the social norms in NY, this certainly makes it all the more funny.  Another social norm turned upside down is his treatment of women; when attending a feminist meeting he laughs at the feminists and brings up ""research"" that women's brains are smaller and keeps refering to one feminist as a guy.

Pertaining to the candid-camera aspect and the controversy thereof; while I sympathize with the people he was extremely rude to such as the dining society... let's think about this.  If someone acting incredibly stupid shows up with a camera screw and is well-financed; he's either a friend of George Soros or it's a prank.  The fraternity guys claimed they were duped into thinking it was a documentary on the fraternity system and yet they didn't question why a guy from Kazachkstan was doing the filming and he was incredibly stupid.  Not to mention one has to know if he's being filmed and with technology today (particularly youtube etc) the film is going to be distributed.

I loved the story; Borat is trying to find Pamela Anderson to make him his wife and it was obvious that one scene where he meets her is staged... but still funny.  Borat encounters many funny figures along the way and his usual antics such as loving women will make crude humor fans laugh.  One of Borat's obvious querps is his disdain for Jews (Cohen is a Jew himself) and the encounter with a Jewish couple at a bed and breakfast, who tried to be very sweet (although it seemed as though it was staged) and trigger the Blair-Witch Project scene that follows.

Again, this is very crude humor appealing to college students, teenagers and Cohen fans like myself.  DO NOT SEE THIS is you think you will be offended or are easily offended.  Cannot stress this enough; which does force me to ding Borat to 4-stars because while I found Borat to be a five-star in my book, it does not appeal to the general audience.  This film was very entertaining for my friends and I to see and was worth the wait; we will get the DVD when it comes out as well.",1163721600,4,3817,4.5549048316251834
2351674,2,6302078164,"Let's be honest here. Cohen is no Mel Brooks, Marx Brothers, or even Andy Kauffman. Compound this lack of sophistication and brilliance with, among other things, overexposure in the media, and the film lost its punch early on for me. I have just read too much about it. So here I am, adding to the clutter.

Truth is, it is a film that would make you laugh. ""The Problem With Mary"" made me laugh also, and it's on a low brow par with that. Inspite of his education, Cohen, whose other artistic highlight is BBC's Ali G, is more Benny Schill than anything resembling Cleese, Chapman, Moore or Sellars. The schtick you know: Dim Eurasian Muslim visits America and interviews dim Americans. All sorts of groups have taken issue with the pillory he runs their interests through, but if you are taking this anywhere near seriously, get a grip. It's dumb comedy, possibly satircal, but essentially easy laughs for the mentally challenged. Nothing wrong with that on the surface. But as Chapman might intone, I find this all too silly, now get on with real comedy. No one enjoys a good joke more than me. Well, except maybe my wife. And her sister......

Cohen takes his cues more from Howard Stern and Artie Lang ( a vastly inferior departure from Howard's collaboration with Martling), than Walt Whitman and Jack Kerouac, who were the philosophical underpinning to Andrei Codreisciu's brilliant ROAD SCHOLAR,  which takes a similar pilgrimage: an Eastern European Jew sets out to discover what it means to be an American. The journey is often very funny, very touching, often brilliantly incisive in depicting how the core of America is its ability to assimilate many different groups with just as many beliefs and social customs in an integrated stew, one not always smooth, and sometimes not very integrated, but encompassing none the less. And to that end, Codreisciu celebrates his own amazement and the diversity itself that he encounters with a sense of grace and self-deprecating humour. Cohen is all sex, fart and jew jokes. Oh well. Flatulence is its own reward.

I suspect the Cohen film would have found its audience even if the government of Kazahkstan hadn't objected to its depiction of its country as a jew-bashing sexist nation. I'd like to think that even in red state America, there might be some recognition that Kazahkstan might have more to it. Scratch the surface and it's clear it is a self-sustaining democracy in the former Soviet enclave with enormous oil reserves. The rub for Cohen might be that it is a Muslim country to boot. For all the hoo-hah about the egg scene, I would suggest to you that what's on offer here is not the literal show before you, and that's what Kazahstan objected to. If the film is anti-semitic, it is so toward the ""other Semites"", to borrow a slogan from the pork industry. Not very Kosher, that. My guess is that, a bit the inverse of Mel Gibson, Cohen has some bigotry issues with successful Muslims. Might be fun to lock him in the same cell as Mel.

Anyway, you won't go blind watching this. Problem remains that there's been too much written about it, and that's not the film's fault.",1163635200,9,3140,4.743589743589744
2351675,5,6302078164,"I laughed and saw the humor in the movie, my wife only stayed in the theater because my birthday was just a mere two hours from the start of the movie and she figured she owed me.

I have to see a dozen chick flicks to get even.

This is definately a love it or hate it movie.  I still don't get Napoleon Dynamite (however I love Team America) so go figure.  Taste is personal and there is no accounting for it.

As to this movie; it's gross and indecent and shouldn't be seen by impressionable minds.  Some of the humor is cruel and mean spirited and much of it is based on debasing others, especially those that are not as fortunate as the average Joe.  However, that said, I didn't get the overall impression that the point of the movie was to be cruel and mean, I think that the point was just the opposite, however you have to see the point to get it.

Some of the people that ""co-acted"" if you will in this film didn't realize they were in a comedy, they were duped into thinking that Borat was a real guy from Europe doing a short documentary for showing across the Atlantic.  For those in the small poor village, they didn't realize they were being used for a comedy either.

I can't say really whether all this is good, bad or indifferent.  If people accept money to be filmed and don't object, then it's ""buyer's beware.""  But I guess I could be wrong, we'll see how some of the purported lawsuits turn out.

Anyway if you like raunchy college frat boy humor and aren't easily offended, then you'll probably enjoy this flick and get the point it is trying to make.  If you're a soft hearted person, whether a pc type liberal or a straight laced conservative, you'll probably hate the movie and feel like you were ripped off, definately you should avoid the embarrassment of having to walk out of the movie house.

This however is the simple explanation of it. The movie however is quite interesting in it's own respects.

Borat travels from New York down to Texas and though to California travelling far for his love (in the form of Pamela Anderson). From insulting feminists to praising our 'War of Terror' Borat is certainly an eye opener.

This is a movie I would recommend to people who enjoy laughing through an entire movie and those who can laugh without fear of being unpolitically correct. If you are someone who can get offended at something, you will in Borat.

And for those of you who don't know, Cohen himself is a British Jew. So the anti-Semitism within the movie is meant to be funny.",1163376000,10,871,4.528662420382165
2351678,5,6302078164,"""Borat"" the movie is crude, vulgar, outrageous and offensive. It is also hilarious, biting and a work of satirical brilliance. Surprisingly, it is also good-hearted beneath its boorish exterior.

Sacha Baron Cohen is a comic genius -- a man whose exquisitely planned bits of anarchy are strung together with an unexpected intelligence and sophistication. Plots lines interweave and resolve; comic elements are raised several times; characters develop, have conflicts and grow. All this in a film whose main attraction is that it contains scenes shot with unwitting actors. It's like viewing a beautiful watercolor painting, only to learn that it was composed in ten minutes by a man licking the canvas with a tongue colored by popsicles. The sheer talent required makes the feat even more impressive.

""Borat"" mostly avoids mere gross-out humor in favor of attacks on the pomposity of the upper classes and on and the hyper-politeness and inherent prickliness of many Americans. Cohen continually tests the boundaries of what we will tolerate, delighting in showing us the critical moments when our feelings overcome our breeding. And he loves to show us being as vile and racist as his lead. Hearing a Texan advise Borat to shave his mustache in order to look more Italian (ethnic but acceptable) than Muslim (unacceptably ethnic) was to witness the moronic underbelly of the national racial conversation. Watching a pastor run out when a hooker crashes a dinner party is to underline how far we have come from the One who invited prostitutes into his company.

""Borat"" is not for everyone. Its vulgarity is pretty extreme, though restrained enough to be believable. Watching Borat and a fat man wrestle in the nude (with sighting of male genitals) is not a sight most would sign up for. Still, it's amazing that even this scene fits in comfortably with the rest of the film. ""Borat"" surprises by taking its actors seriously while satirizing the rest of the planet's inhabitants. The only distraction was the meddlesome question of how much of the movie was staged, how much was completely acted and how much partially staged.

Definitely a movie worth watching for those who appreciate jabs at anti-semites, rich Americans and the occasional swimming bear.",1163376000,12,2258,5.111111111111111
2351679,5,6302078164,"Aside from the fact that Borat is HILARIOUS, I did enjoy how he brings to light the views of the more conservative Americans (specifically in the Southern Regions).  It is especially disturbing when he goes into a church and there are congressmen and judges preaching in it.  They just continue to fuel the ingnorance of these mostly poor, uneducated people while at the same time attempting to be reelected on a platform that mainly focuses on trivial issues (like gay marriage, stem cell research and affirmative action) that are REALLY meant to divide the American people by forcing them to take sides.

Although I deem the aformentioned issues very important, there are more pressing, URGENT issues that need to be addressed that will unite (rather than divide) the majority of Americans.  For example, the minimum wage, environment, health care, social security benefits and the war.

I've seen it twice already.  Sasha Baron Cohen is simply brilliant. I highly recommend this film.",1163376000,7,987,5.099378881987578

To be sure I love edgy humor - the kind that you can't hear in this politically correct world of ours. But making fun of the caucasian Americans, Christians, Eastern Europeans and...Jews (here's something really novel for ya!)...Haven't we seen it somewhere before?...

You want to be on the cutting edge of comedy? Go to a mosque, not a Pentacostal church, and make fun of Muslims. Show the racism and ignorance of the ""sophisticated"" societies of today's Western Europe (BTW, you want to hear real dumb and racist things? Talk to the average Frenchman or German! They make Americans sound like geniuses). Make fun of the culture of poverty among the Blacks -- Cohen's pandering to the Black youth in one of the scenes is an embarassment and shows that there *are*, after all,limits to how far he's willing - or has the courage - to go.

People with prudish attitudes should definitely stay home and even open minded people like myself will have some issues as to how far the movie will go.

This movie seemed like a long joke that stretched so far that I started to get a headache after the first hour.  Borat (Cohen) seemed to want to do really outrageous thing to unsuspecting audiences (we have seen a lot of similar things on YouTube but some of the people in the film seem so generally nice that you feel especially bad with the jokes played on them especially the nice old couple that rent a bed and breakfast to Borat and his companion.

Some of the scenes are gut-wrenchingly funny with a lot of ""guy"" humor especially when Borat says some shocking things to a bunch of women feminists.  Others cross the line especially some of the sexually explicit humor between Borat and his companion.

I give this movie just under four stars but I preferred the previously mentioned Clerks II over it for overall humor (at least I did not get a headache from that film).",1163376000,5,1161,4.504761904761905

The premise--an Eastern European man from a third world culture comes to the U.S. to learn about our ways and make a documentary-- is full of comic possibilities.  And indeed there are many funny moments as Borat, who doesn't know enough to be politically correct, says and does outrageous things.  For example, when he tries to greet strangers on the streets of NYC by kissing the men, or when he tries to negotiate the price of a luxury hotel room as if he were in a Turkish Bazaar.  These are hilarious scenes.  And there are plenty more throughout the film.

And there is sharp satire in some of the scenes.  Like when Borat announces to a rodeo crowd that he supports America's ""War of Terror"" and gets rousing applause, or when he crashes a Southern Revival meeting and finds ""Mr. Jesus"".

But there is a thin line between satire and plain mean-spirited offensiveness, and this film crosses the line repeatedly in search of cheap laughs.  It's clear that many of the film's unwitting co-stars are real people who haven't been clued in, and think they are participating in a real documentary.  Often, these people become the butt of many of the jokes, as the film makes them look racist, ignorant, or just incompetent.  Audiences seem to enjoy laughing at the flaws of others.  But in the end the joke is on us.  We spent $10 to get a few laughs at others' expense, and to watch what amounts to little more than an extended SNL skit.",1163289600,5,1666,4.58445945945946

I know that at a certain point I waited for it to be over. When it ended I felt like my friends felt the same.

2351684,1,6302078164,"Sacha Baron Cohen's film ""Borat"" is being used as a litmus test. If you like the film, you are hip, cool, and part of the new in-crowd immune to the silly dictates of common decency and Political Correctness.

If you don't like ""Borat,"" you are an old fuddy-duddy or spinster schoolmarm.

I laugh at dead baby jokes. I was a nurse's aid and then a Peace Corps volunteer, and I learned to laugh at death, bodily fluids, pus-filled sores, and intestinal parasites.

I cannot tell you how much I hated ""Borat."" I would have walked out, but I had to keep watching because of my field of study.

Based on reviews, I expected a penetrating, edgy critique of Political Correctness that would make me laugh out loud. I did not laugh once. (Full disclosure: others in the theater did.) I'd like to offer you samples of what passes for humor in ""Borat,"" but if I did so, this site would not run my review. That's because just about every joke - - not just some of them but just about every one - - is made at the intrusively graphic expense of women or homosexuals, and/or it involves bodily excretions.

An example. Baron Cohen is a guest at the home of a genuinely charming woman. After defecating, he hands her his fecal matter. That's a big joke. If you are laughing now, this movie is for you.

In another scene, Baron Cohen, without any clothing on at all, wrestles with another undressed man who is grotesquely obese. During this wrestling match, they assume poses for activities I can't name; if I did, this site would not run this review. If jokes at the expense of fat homosexual men are your cup of tea, this movie is for you.

I've never seen such a hateful movie in a mainstream theater. Again, I know full well that I sound like a schoolmarm when I say that. Sacha Baron Cohen, I would have to guess, based on this movie, hates the human race, including you, the ticket buyer. He is willing to exploit everyone he encounters, to humiliate them on camera, to get you, the ticket buyer, someone he also hates, to laugh at others' suffering. Once you do that, he can laugh at you. If watching decent people doing their best to deal with an obnoxious creep is your cup of tea, then this movie is for you.

I feel like repeating over and over: I laughed at Todd Solondz's ""Happiness."" I laugh at politically incorrect humor. And I hated this movie.

There's more going on here, and I know I'm risking a lot by pointing this out.

Borat speaks Polish. Only speakers of Polish will get that. He says ""Dzien Dobry,"" ""jak sie masz,"" ""dziekuje"" and other Polish phrases. The film's opening and closing scenes were shot in a real Eastern European village. Real Eastern European folk music is played on the soundtrack.

With ""Ali G,"" Baron Cohen exploited vicious stereotypes of Blacks. With ""Borat"" Baron Cohen is not targeting Kazaks. He's exploiting a centuries-old, contemptuous and hateful stereotype of Eastern European peasants that can be found in various Western cultures - witness the American ""Polak joke"" - - and is common in one thread of Jewish culture. In this stereotype, Poles, and, by extension, Eastern European Christian peasants, are, like Borat, ignorant, bestial, and disgusting. A good prcis of the stereotype can be found in a famous passage in Isaac Bashevis Singer's ""The Slave."" It can be found in the ""Golem"" article on my website.

In fact, ""Borat"" has a lot in common with Marian Marzynski's controversial film ""Shtetl."" In both, cameras invade an impoverished Eastern European peasant village. Villagers who are not sophisticated or worldly are conned into appearing on camera to perform for us as if they were trained monkeys. We laugh at them, or feel disgust at them, because they are dirty, because they are poor, and because they keep pigs. In any case, gazing at these lesser peasants, we know that we are superior. Perhaps Baron Cohen will try this technique next in a Darfur refugee camp or a homeless shelter. Poor, unsophisticated people can be so amusing.

Baron Cohen speaks of women as if they were less than dirt. Don't misunderstand him. He's not mocking misogyny. He's milking misogyny. The things Baron Cohen says about women in this movie are grotesque; they are brutal. He makes fun of mentally retarded people. He makes fun of white, Christian Southerners, a group everyone feels safe mocking.

Reviews, and no doubt many viewers, are telling you that ""Borat"" is a fearless laugh riot that punctures political correctness and makes you laugh till you cry. It's that very description that made me want to see it. I thought I'd be getting something like the Colbert Report.

I've gotta think I'm not the only one, though, who found looking at Baron Cohen's hatred for an hour and a half to be an icky, profoundly unfunny experience.",1163289600,60,4774,4.69377990430622

""Borat etc.."" is here and the answer is a resounding yes although any reasonable and clear thinking person may find the need to atone for laughing uproariously at this movie clearly made to to both mock and shock.

Supposedly the picture was mostly improvised but I believe a good 90 percent of the movie was scripted in some way. How else do you explain the fact that Sasha Cohen(Borat) is still breathing considering the outrageous and sometimes cruel pranks he plays on ""unsuspecting"" patsies.

One scene I hope is fake is the one between Borat and the gunshop owner when Borat asks the man ""what is best gun to kill Jew?"" The owner offers a gun of choice without a blink of eye or raised eyebrow-it's chilling to think there is someone out there like that.

But still there is no denying this is one funny movie even if you feel a little guilty, actually very guilty laughing at a movie that holds a mirror to the sometimes dark side of humanity, including Borat himself.",1163203200,5,1096,4.697916666666667
2351686,5,6302078164,"Borat is a marvel in the fields of mockumentaries and social experiments.  Sacha Baron Cohen's character of Borat, a Kazakh TV reporter, is not real, and yet he was able to fool a whole lot of people into thinking he was.  The film follows Borat (Cohen) and his producer Azamat (Ken Davitian) as they travel across the United States to film a documentary with the mission of observing American culture and using it to improve Kazakhstan.  The twist is that while Borat and Azamat are fictional characters, most everyone in the film are real people.

The film starts and ends in Borat's home village in Kazakhstan, which is portrayed as a stereotypical ex-communist bloc country; it is very poor, cultural aspects that were cool in America 20 years ago are cool now, and there is a lot of intolerance (the town is extremely anti-Semitic).  All of the people in these scenes are actors, but once Borat gets to America, nearly (I would say 98%) all of the people interviewed for the documentary are real people who have no idea that Borat isn't real.

While the stated purpose of Borat is to make Kazakhstan a better country, Cohen's mission statement was to show the sheer absurdity of American political correctness.  Though we live in a PC culture, racist, sexist, and other ""-ist"" ideas boil beneath the surface.  Borat is a character who says incredibly offensive things without realizing it.  His poor grasp on the English language and racist and sexist upbringing get him into trouble with a lot of people, such as when he tells a group of feminists that it is a proven fact that women have smaller brains than men.  The interesting thing is that most people don't object to any of the insensitive things that Borat says, while a few even agree with him and back up his claims.  For example, while attending a rodeo in the south, he tells the foreman that in his country, homosexuals are hanged.  The foreman responds by saying that people in America wish that they could do that here.

The movie is incredibly offensive, but nothing that Borat says will offend you.  It is what we Americans do in response.  Borat is a fictional character, and while the things he says are silly, we know that Cohen doesn't mean them.  It is the responses of our fellow citizens that are shockingly offensive and hilarious.  Whether it be the Texan antique shop owner whose store is full of Confederate battle flags and pro-secession messages or the gun shop employee who answers Borats question of, ""What gun would you reccomend to kill Jew?"" with, ""Probably a 9mm"", it is a real eye-opener to see how some people in this country really think.

It's amazing to think that the people who participated in this ""documentary"" didn't read their release forms closely enough to realize what was really going on when they signed them (though the frat boys from the end of the film are trying to sue due to feelings of being misled by the producers).

2351695,3,6302078164,"Here's a punchy satire of American narrow-mindedness that takes stinging potshots at us/US using the tried and true method of the outsider looking in.

Borat, a crude wacky Kazakhstan ""media personality""--played by Sasha (""Ali G"") Baron Cohen--comes to America to pay homage to our culture and ultimately to wed Pamela Anderson. Along the way he has all kinds of, you know, wacky adventures. The plotting and overall style is highly reminiscent of too-too stylized 60s and 70s American satires like The President's Analyst, but incidents happen in ""Borat"" that would never be found in its predecessors of three decades earlier.

For example, Borat and Azmat, his grossly overweight ""manager"", roll around naked fighting each other in their hotel room, exposing all kinds of flesh to the camera, engaging in positions that make us both cringe and laugh out loud at the same time. There's no question that there's comedy here; the real question is how emotionally resonant this film will be a week from today, or a month from today. Hard to say.

Borat sings the national anthem at a rodeo, before which he praises America for its war on Iraq, but during which he exalts Kazakhstan as the greatest nation on earth, also mentioning that all other nations are ruled by little girls. The vociferous cheering that greeted his exhortations against Iraq prior to his rendition of the national anthem are quickly replaced by a cacophony of boos and catcalls.

This is really a series of skits and sketches, each of which points up an obvious shortcoming of American culture--and/or of global culture. In his native country, says Borat, his sister is the fourth best hooker in the nation, and he also tells of the annual festival of ""The Running of the Jew""--an obvious takeoff on the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. This points not so much to American cultural stupidity but to its global counterpart.

Borat is likely worth seeing, but is certainly not a linear film. The message is basically--everybody's stupid.  Fair enough. Whether we want to remember a film like that as the weeks, months and years go by is perhaps debatable.",1162944000,5,2132,4.941340782122905

I watched it up until the [...] scene with the horribly fat man.  I had to walk from the theater.  I get it cartoony form, but the reality of a fat hairy naked man ...well it is far too horrifing.  I shall be forever scarred.

2351697,4,6302078164,"Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen, ""Madagascar"", ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"") introduces us to his home town in Kazakhstan. He has been charged, by his government, with creating a documentary to improve the financial fortunes of his country. His journey? To travel to America and find out how he can make his country more like the United States and increase tourism and revenue. Arriving in New York, he greets people on the street like he would at home, trying to shake their hands and kiss them on both cheeks. Naturally, most of the people run away from him, swearing at the freak. His longtime producer, Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian), tries to keep him on track, but Borat begins watching American television in his hotel room and comes across a re-run of ""Baywatch"". Instantly, he becomes completely enamored of Pamela Anderson and decides he will travel to California and marry her. His producer is reluctant, but Borat convinces him and they set off on their journey after purchasing an old ice cream truck. Along the way, they meet many interesting people. But will he be able to find Pamela Anderson?

""Borat"", the brainchild of Sacha Baron Cohen, a British comedian, who seems to have a knack for creating truly off-center characters (he was the most memorable voice in ""Madagascar"" and the most memorable character in ""Talladega Nights"") and directed by Larry Charles (one of the writer/ producers involved in ""Seinfeld"", ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and other television projects), is a truly funny, truly outrageous and truly memorable film. It is not a perfect film, but it is extremely funny and extremely un-politically correct.

From the moment Borat begins introducing us to the people of his village, we know we are in for a strange trip. He quickly exposes us to the character's feelings, philosophies, prejudices and phobias. We learn a little about his country and squirm in our seats. You just can't say the things he says in our country. It isn't politically correct and people would get upset. Will he fit in our country?

What Cohen does here is almost brilliant. He is making fun of our preconceived notions of what Kazakhstan is like because we know little, if anything, about the country. We expect it to look like he is portraying it. He merely amplifies the image, making it more of a caricature. We expect them to use horses to pull their cars, to marry young and have many children and we expect them to carry a rooster in their luggage.

Then he flies to New York.

In New York, the humor continues, but it changes focus. We are laughing at Borat's exchanges with real people, but we are also laughing at their interactions with him. New Yorkers run from him, or swear at him, as soon as he approaches, trying to shake their hand or to kiss them on the cheek.

All of these interactions appear to be completely improvised. The people he meets along the journey appear to be real ""normal"" people who have no idea who Borat really is. They seem to believe they are actually interacting with a reporter from a foreign country that many mistakenly refer to as Russia. If this is true, it is simply amazing to me many of these people are not threatening legal action. They don't come off well and that is what makes much of this humor all the more outstanding. And difficult to watch. As we are laughing at these statements, we are also uncomfortable because even though we know people can't still think this way, we know people still think this way.

At a rodeo, he is invited to sing the National Anthem. Before hand, he tries to kiss a man he has just met on the cheeks. He says ""Don't do that, that's what those guys who float around do"", waving his hand at his wrist, and then makes a comment about them that is truly shocking. People really still believe these things? Amazing. Then, when he steps out to begin singing, he says ""I support your war of terror"". The audience cheers because no one seems to really hear what he is saying. They hear the words ""war"" and ""terror"" and immediately assume he is showing a sign of support. Later, after taking an etiquette class, he meets with a group of well-off Southerners for a formal dinner. They try to understand the cultural differences and build a bridge between the cultures, but when his guest arrives, everything turns for the worst.

The brilliance of this comedy comes from the fact that we are, initially, laughing at his backwards little country, and all of their eccentricities, then we are laughing at our backwards little country and all of our eccentrics.

Cohen does an amazing job of bringing this character to life. Early on, we realize Borat shares his countries fear of and hatred for people of Jewish ancestry. At no point does he ever back off or lessen this viewpoint. We watch the running of ""the Jew"" in his village. Later, he and his producer stop at a bed and breakfast and learn the couple who own it are Jewish. They shrink back in horror, but feel trapped. Throughout the film, Cohen maintains all of the characters eccentricities, creating an extremely consistent and believable character. This is all the more interesting and amazing when you consider how broad the comedy is. Generally, this type of character would laugh at himself, trying to clue us in to the joke, but he doesn't. He doesn't seem to realize there is a joke and as we continue to watch, we begin to think perhaps we are watching a documentary.

""Borat"" contains a lot of laughs, and they are consistent throughout. But there is a lot of truly adult stuff. I was surprised by the amount of full frontal male nudity. In one scene, Borat and his manager get into a fight and begin rolling around their hotel room, completely nude. Its a funny scene, but also sophomoric, because the fight degenerates into a bunch of homoerotic icons. The main purpose of the joke, besides the homoerotic references, seems to be the fact Borat's manager is extremely overweight. Not only are they guys, who fall into a bunch of sexual positions, but one guy is extremely fat. They are doing the two things many might find disgusting. Having sex with a man. And having sex with an overweight person. This was not the highlight of the film, but because it is shocking it is still funny.

The film is technically brilliant. Every frame has been given a grainy image, to make it appear the Kazakh crew is using old video equipment, which is probably new to them. Every time a new person appears on screen, there is a title in Borat's native language with the American translation superimposed sloppily over the top. The film also resembles any propaganda film we have seen from another country, the same sort of phony staged introductions, the same awkward moments, the grainy footage looks like it has been played through ten too many bad elementary school projectors.

In the area where I live, many matinee screenings sold out. I also saw that many evening shows were sold out very early on each day of the opening weekend. This rarely happens. When it does, it is usually an indication the film will have a monstrous opening weekend. Not really surprising because Cohen has been everywhere, always in character; ""Saturday Night Live"", ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" and his show has a cult following. This, and the universally glowing reviews, have apparently created a phenomenon. Amazingly, the film opened on about 900 screens, about half of a normal studio release. Fox has apparently seen the writing on the wall and already ordered a sequel.

Using the male custom of greeting one another for a kiss, having different toiletry folkways, and regarding Jews with an ignorant fear, Borat and his producer sidekick, Azamat (Ken Davidian), set out for America in search of the best in us to take back to his country. His learning curve is necessary lesser than most visitors and immigrants, but it provides some very funny moments. One is found where he and Azamat wrestle naked in their hotel room (a match which goes into the hallways, the elevator and a hotel convention) after Borat catches him having a crude fascination with Pamela Anderson. (His infatuation with her is enough allure to take his trek from New York to California--not as originally planned.) (The Middle East has known to import 'Baywatch' like no other American product, regardless of their regard--or lack thereof--of women.)

Okay. I come speak today of movie, Borat. My second cousin from Kazakhstan make documentary and I love it. It touch my heart. I need say, too, that Borat's sister now #2 prostitute in all of Kazakhstan. Her trophy bigger now. She kiss like Juicy Fruit gum. You know Juicy Fruit? Hello? Okay.

When Borat leave Kazakhstan, we worry he make us look stupid. But he did great job. His house nice place, too. He show how it stand almost straight and have room for beautiful cow in livingroom. I need say, too, there was rumor Borat's wife die. Is not so. She fall in love with man from Siberia and go north. She may be dead now but don't think so.

Borat come to New York City on plane with Azamat, other Kazakhstan man who help Borat. It scary Americans on subway not kiss Borat back when he greet them. What wrong with America? Hello? You still listening? Okay. I worried, too, that Borat's Kazakhstan chicken get stomped on subway when she get out of bag. But not happen. Whew!

It nice to see many good places to relieve bowels in America. The flowers in front of place called Trump Towers look pretty and open.

On early visit, Borat meet man who teach him jokes in America. It strange, too, that Americans do not joke of retards. They so stupid, you must make jokes. And what happening with feminism. Is that right word? Hello? Okay. Borat speak true about womans smaller brains. Scientific study in Kazakhstan prove it. Don't know why those womans so upset with Borat for speaking true.

Television in America look very nice. And is place where Borat fall in love with Pameela Anderson. I would sex her up as good as my own sister, too. But Borat should not have lie to Azamat about why they go to California. He should have said to Azamat, ""We go California so I can sex up and marry Pameela.""

The trip across America is fun and scary. I love bear they get for protection. Too bad Azamat get so hungry later. Poor bear. At least they no have to clean up bear poop now. I not know, too, that American Jews no have horns. Is most scary! When Borat and Azamat stay at Jew home and not know until too late. Brrrr! I thought documentary turn into horror film. But I cheer when Borat and Azamat get out of Jew home safely in middle of night.

When Azamat and Borat get into huge fight, was sad. But Azamat should not been ma$turbate to Pameela's picture. They wrestle and fight and run through hotel. Naked fighting is tough, because no clothes to hang on to. When Azamat pinned Borat to bed and make mustache smell like te$ticle$, was sad day for Borat.

It good that they return to friends soon. I surprised, though, that Azamat dress like Hitler in California. Was he trying to hide?

When Borat finally meet Pameela, it sadden me she not understand Kazakhstan way of marriage proposal. Kidnap is natural courting. I sure Borat should explain to Pameela if given opportunity.

I happy to see Borat return home to Kazakhstan. He bring Luenell back with him, too, and she now #1 prostitute in all Kazakhstan. Borat sister now have competition.

Borat is a spin-off movie from the Borat segments we saw in his TV show, Da Ali G Show. In the short segment we had Borat, a TV journalist from Kazakhstan who is basically trying to understand the ways of American culture. The film is the exact same premise except on a feature length scale.

  In this mockumentary we have Borat who travels to the USA under a grant from his government in hopes of learning ways to benefit the lifestyle in his home country of Kazakhstan. In the midst of his journey he happens to watch an episode of Baywatch and now wants to go to California to marry Pamela Anderson. That's your basic structure, but that's not what makes this movie flat out hilarious.

  What makes this movie extremely funny are the various social commentaries on our culture and religion worldwide. We travel from the east coast to the west coast experiencing all of the United States' diversity. In one scene he sits down with an instructor to teach him manners while eating with upper class white Americans, and he asks if it's appropriate to bring a guest. So, he does bring a guest, and that guest is a black hooker. I mean, just watching him making fun of ourselves is absolutely hilarious. In one hilarious scene he and his producer stay at a bed and breakfast at a home owned by an old Jewish couple. In the middle of the night he spots two cockroaches and they flip out because they think the Jews changed form and are trying to kill them. They stand there jumping and screaming while throwing money at the cockroaches. In another scene he sits down with feminists and asks if teaching women would be a problem since their brains are the size of a squirrel's. It's scenes like these that make Borat incredibly smart and probably the funniest movie you have seen in a while. The film pushes the limits in terms of shock value in some places, for example, a nude wrestling match between Borat and his manager in their hotel room when Borat catches him masturbating to a picture of Pamela Anderson. So, the film has two sides, it can be at times gross out humor but not without it's biting social satire.

  Larry Charles directed this brilliant comedic movie, and while the meat of the film comes from Sacha Baron Cohen's writing you cannot deny the style. Shot as low budget as possible, Larry Charles has made this his own personal style. Some of the scenes are set up so perfectly that you have to credit Charles for the direction. When Borat first arrives in New York we suddenly hear Harry Nilsson's ""Everybody's Talkin"", and then we begin a little reference to Midnight Cowboy as we see Borat wandering New York City. Charles is best known for directing and working on Seinfeld and he stayed with Larry David to help develop and direct some episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm. Larry Charles also has written and directed episodes of Entourage and directed the Bob Dylan starring film, Masked & Anonymous.

ACTING: Sacha Baron Cohen is the star of this movie, and he is the genius who plays Borat. What many people don't know is that Sacha Baron Cohen is British and he is Jewish. He is the most versitile comedian working today in my opinion. He can transform into anybody, hide his accent, and completely embody the persona. He is Ali G, Borat, he co-starred in Talladega Nights as Will Ferrel's French nemesis, and he was the voice of King Julyan in Madagascar. The character of Borat is not offensive to the people of Kazakhstan as many people are complaining, it's a serious jab at our intolerant culture. It doesn't show his ignorance, but rather the ignorance and intolerance of the American people. He created one of the funniest characters in film history.

BOTTOM LINE: Borat is an incredible social satire that will have you laughing till it hurts. It is not only a brilliant satire on our culture, but a crude and hilarious way of looking at it. The only problem with this movie is that it is in fact based on a segment that was only 10 minutes of the Da Ali G Show. In ways it does start to drag and it slows down in a few places, and that's mainly because it was originally developed for television. I said the same thing about Jackass Number Two a few months ago, and that's a problem that I don't think you can fix when translating a television concept to film. Overall this is a hilarious piece of comedic filmmaking. I like! It's very niiice!",1162684800,19,4629,4.585247883917775
2351705,5,6302078164,"I cannot remember the last time I laughed this hard and this much at a movie.  I might have to go all the way back to ""Blazing Saddles,"" ""Animal House,"" and ""Airplane!""

""Borat"" is just that funny.

There is so much that is so politcally incorrect, so outrageous...just so WRONG that I was gasping just before the biggest laughs.  The sold-out crowd I saw it with sounded like they would agree with me.

Before you go, you have to know this: Borat isn't real.  He's one of three characters played by a brilliant British comedian named Sacha Baron Cohen, who's perfected each persona to appear totally believable.  His other two characters, the hopelessly white and moronic Ali G and the out-and-proud gay fashionista Bruno are absent here but Borat easily carries the show.  How Cohen doesn't break character in some situations is as much fun as watching the hapless people he's goofing on.

The film has a loose feel to it but it contains a great eye for detail.  For example, pay attention to what's inside of Borat's producer's refrigerator when Borat catches up to him in L.A.

I can't wait for the DVD to hopefully listen to a commentary from the filmmakers!

Wildly, wildly funny.",1162684800,9,1186,4.703883495145631
2351706,5,6302078164,"Cohen and his crew are fearless.  Absolutely fearless.  They push the Andy Kaufman-type ""Foreign Guy"" bit farther than Kaufman ever did, and with uncomfortably funny results  [This does not take away from Kaufman's genius, though.  Kaufman is still in a class by himself].

The dinner scene, the hotel room squabble, Borat dropping his suitcase to the sidewalk when he leaves the fratboys' RV (LISTEN for it), Borat's chuckling when a feminist tells him that women should be equal to men.... I was laughing so hard I got light-headed and feared I would pass out.  Thank god I saw this film less than a half-mile from a hospital.

Can't wait for the DVD -- can't wait to see the stuff that DIDN'T make it into the film.  Don't know how the film crew kept a straight face during all that (they would have had to in order to maintain the charade).

Take a date to this movie -- he/she will love you so much for it that you can go home afterwards and ""make sexy time"".

Even the end credits are funny.",1162684800,11,997,4.458563535911602
2351707,2,6302078164,"Plenty of the humor in Borat is funny.  Andy Kauffman would be proud that his ""foreigner"" humor is being recycled so heavily.

But there is also a lot of the type of ""humor"" that makes people laugh because they feel uncomfortable- the same kind of laughter that someone may have when they are being tickled relentlessly, or worse, when someone is being picked on for their flaws (there's a big difference between that and self-deprecating humor).  It isn't really funny, it's just embarrassing and/or demoralizing.

Besides that, Borat and the other characters of Sacha Baron Cohen work fairly well in small doses, but overall this movie tries way too hard to break out of it's usual 10 minute segment.  The movie loses a bit of it's steam half way through.

I laughed through plenty of it, but I also left with an unsatisfying sense that the biggest joke in the movie was on the viewer.",1162684800,9,887,4.690322580645161
2351708,5,6302078164,"This film is a work of satiric genius. Its central character happily revels in unabashed jingoism, sexual promiscuity, and open bigotry regarding assorted minorities. Because he's allegedly from an underdeveloped country, many of his unwitting American hosts display a hilarious - because politically correct - impotence in the presence of his barbarism. By the same token, he is able to uncover less overt, though similarly barbaric, tendencies among most of the various Americans from assorted geographical regions he encounters on his cross country journey. Civilization is shown, as a result, to be a very thin veneer coating self-absorbed Manhattanites,  southern Frat Boys, and southwest rodeo attendees. Baron Cohen sees unreflective nationalism, the worship of celebrity, and an adolescent sexual outlook as the true religion both of Borat, his TV talking head from Kazakhstan, and of any number of the Americans he meets. Cohen's satire is the best antidote to sentimental Rousseauistic thought imaginable. He is, as a satirist holding nobody sacred, in the direct line of ""offensive"" artists descending from Aristophanes.",1162684800,3,1131,5.614035087719298
2351709,5,6302078164,this is hands down one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. the only other time i laughed as hard in a theater was clerks 2 and team america. this movie is definetely one that will offend some but who cares. its a movie full of silly stupid humor and i could not be happier with it. go and see it now!,1162598400,4,305,3.857142857142857
2351710,3,6302078164,"Just saw this at the Hollywood Regal 24 around the corner.  Definitely not a movie for the faint-hearted.

When Borat's not skewering PC conventions, he's making you squirm.  You'll laugh either in horror, or disbelief, all the way through this movie.  Well, I certainly did.  I mean, it's not every day I see a bear's head on a plate in a fridge.  Oh, and wait for the prosthetic scene.

One thing that struck me is how intolerant New Yorkers were of his antics (""Kiss me and I'll kick you in the nuts!"" was a typical reaction), and how tolerant the rest of the country was (e.g., the bouffy Southern belle patiently explaining to him how to use a flush toilet, and toilet paper - after he'd shown up at the dinner table with a bag of his own excrement).  An interesting juxtaposition: the Blue state has no time for a clueless foreigner, while the Red states will even put up with an incredibly evil take on the national anthem (Look out for the flag-carrying horse falling over on its side.  Oh.  My.  God!).

I think Sacha Baron Cohen is funny in the way other people are beautiful: He can make you smile, just by standing still.

So, why three stars?  Mostly because the movie struck me as kind of cruel, even if it was funny.  I like it that Americans are nice, and accomodating, and I just don't like to see these virtues taken advantage of, or mocked.",1162598400,8,1359,4.423387096774194
2351711,5,6302078164,"I had heard the hype about this movie being ridiculously funny and didn't really believe it could live up to it's lofty expectations. But, let tell you Borat is the funniest movie I have EVER seen. That is a pretty strong statement but it is true. I have never laughed harder or longer than I did during this film. You would have to see Borat at least 10 times to get all of the jokes, there are just too many funny parts. Just a few highlights include Borat and Azamat wrestling nude, Borat and Azamat staying at a bed and breakfast with Jews, Borat inviting a black overweight prostitute to a stuffy southern ministers house and of course the Pam Anderson bit. The thing that makes Borat so funny is that all of his victims are real people who are unaware that they are being exposed as either racist or sexist idiots. If Sacha Baron Cohen is not nominated for an Oscar and does not win for this role, then no comedic role will ever win an Oscar. Baron Cohen is absolutely flawless and relentless as the mock Kazack (sp?) reporter. The scene where Borat and Azamat crash a mortgage broker's seminar nude and start wrestling on the stage is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life. There are only a handful of times in my life that I can say I've experienced a life-altering event but Borat is one of those moments. This movie will stay with me for the rest of my life. An absolute instant classic and the funniest movie ever made. Highest recommendation possible.",1162598400,6,1472,4.435424354243542
2351712,3,6302078164,"There is no question that Sacha Baron Cohen is very, very smart. After all, he has contrived a way to get ordinary people to open their hearts and minds and let all their darkness and bigotry come spilling out. In the end, I think it's way more subtle and sophisticated than it seems. But that's only part of the story. Not all of the ""victims"" of Borat's pranks are unsympathetic. There are some who are well-meaning, altruistic, and sympathetic to this seemingly lovable idiot from an alien land where, he manages to convince them, men drink fermented horse urine and make women ride on the outside of buses. And that's the rub. Cohen is making sport of the good and bad, the innocent and racist, with one fat brush. Through his eyes, the world is populated with sloppy, boorish, ignorant, and sometimes really, really nice fools that smart people can make sport of relentlessly.

After all, you'd have to be a complete idiot to believe that there is a country where gays wear blue hats, men brag about their sisters' oral sex skills, Jews are feared as shape-shifting demons, and no one knows how to use a toilet. The sad truth, however, is that a lot of decent, well-meaning and sympathetic types take Borat at face value -- not because of stupidity or idiocy -- but because they're perfect targets for a fraud. And that's exactly what Sacha Baron Cohen really is -- a good old-fashioned fraud. He's the embodiment of reality TV, the rich bachelor who isn't, the bold-faced lie.

And, in the end, though I laughed and laughed and felt kind of sick about it afterwards, Cohen a pretty sick and talented schmuck. He's great a making fools of people, and, like the crowd on the school bus that laughed at the clumsy doofus with the banana-shaped head (I think every school bus has one), we laugh along with Cohen at how stupid, pathetic, and flawed people are. Laugh, laugh, laugh.

I couldn't help but smile when I learned that, during his promotional blitz in character, a New Yorker who wasn't having any of it began to deliver a nice beating to Mr. Cohen. A cynical person might be saddened to learn that  someone broke it up.",1162598400,,2131,4.614775725593668
2351713,5,6302078164,"This movie is absolutely hilarious!  It was crude and absolutely brutal, and the laughs never stopped coming.  Sacha Baron Cohen uses the bigotry of his character, Borat, to expose the prejudices and ignorance of the unfortunate souls he meets on a trip through ""U.S. and A;"" all to great effect.

On a side note, ""Borat"" is in no way insulting to the people of Kazakhstan.  Baron Cohen simply chose a country that most people in America would not know the first thing about.  It is just a way of tricking them into letting their guard down and making fools of themselves.  And really now, you would have to be pretty stupid to believe any of the stuff he says about Kazakhstan.

2351714,3,6302078164,"This slightly mean-spirited, vaguely intelligent movie contantly reaches in and drags laughter out of you, whether you want to give it up or not. Yes, it's at times hilarious, and yes, it's a LOT more crude than the innocent old Borat sketches used to be (ah, the simple fun of Borat's country-western rendition of ""Throw The Jew Down The Well"") and I'll admit parts of this movie left me open-mouthed with well-deserved shock, but it's every bit as disturbingly funny as it was promised to be, so it gives you your money's worth. And everything you've heard about it that you can't make yourself believe could possibly be true is actually probably 100% true, including a nihilistic pseudo-homoerotic nude wrestling match between Borat and his producer.

Just in a side note, I really think the Pamela Anderson segment was totally rehearsed and staged, as were the part with the bear, and also the old Jewish couple who operated the bed and breakfast. The B&B part was a total setup, maybe even done in a set with actors, but most of the rest of this movie I do think rang impressively true. (Particularly those South Carolina frat boys!)

Borat's movie is funny, and it does expose hypocrisies and shed light on some American cultural attitudes, but above all this is humor at its most unapologetically raw.",1162512000,4,1308,4.808888888888889

Borat is a real comedy made on a really low budget. Sacha Baron Cohen is the brains and body behind borat. There are many times in the movie, when he does what he does, where i thought, ""How can he keep a straight face?"" You will laugh within the first 60 seconds of the movie, how many movies can do that, i would say none, short of spaceballs or 40-year old virgin. Borat has many marks at anti-semitism, Sacha in fact is jewish and pokes fun at jews, and everyone else as well. For example, you find how some people in the southern United States, aren't the brightest in the country.

2351716,2,6302078164,"Apparently I missed something in this film because I only found it mildly funny.  In fact the audience that attended the same performance I did hardly laughed at all and this included several college age boys sitting nearby.  While some people laughed (as did I) there were no knee slappers. However the reviewers here all think this was a hilarious film.  I was not offended by it, I just didn't think it was funny.

Borat is basically a series of Saturday Night Live skits loosely connected, much like Talledaga Nights, but Talledaga was actually hilarious.  In this film, which is a pseudo documentary the people he encounters are not actors but he deliberately pushes them by his rude behavior to react.  His personal conduct is appalling and cannot be excused on the basis of cultural differences.  He accosts people in New York who react negatively to his attempts at friendliness.  Having personally been accosted by various nuts in large cities I didn't find their reactions to be unusual.  Watching a bunch of college boys get drunk and make fools of themselves didn't strike me as especially funny and the college kids sitting near me apparently didn't either because this skit didn't get any laughs and only a few chuckles.  Of course some of the anti-semitic skits were funny - especially the bed and breakfast scene but these never reached the level of Mel Brooks's treatment of the same subject. Nevertheless because of the few real laughs in this movie I gave it two stars, but overall I thought it was rather dull and as it wore on --  less and less funny. Plus there were scenes that I thought didn't especially fit other than to shock the audience.  The masturbation scenes were sort of funny but to what purpose? The same was true of the nude wrestling scene -- sort of funny but what was the point and how did it fit into a ""documentary""?  I felt that making fun of people who were sincerely trying to help -- the Christian scene -- showed appalling bad manners and whose only purpose seemed to be to make fun of the people.  The same was true of the dinner party.  The Americans were trying to accomodate Borat but he continued to insult them until they reacted.  Would you have acted differently if a guest in your home was as rude and insulting?  Why was this supposed to be funny?  Not one laugh in the audience.  In fact this film is getting great reviews from Hollywood and New York but then those are the people who think the typical American is some sort of yahoo.

I realize I am in the minority because I thought this film was only mildly funny and hardly worth the money.  I would say -- don't bother -- its all hype and not much comedic substance.",1162512000,14,2679,4.562761506276151
2351717,4,6302078164,"Back in 1956, anthropologist Horace Miner published a paper called ""Body Ritual among the Nacirema"". The Nacirema were a savage tribe with outlandish ideas about cleanliness, illness and child-rearing. They lived in North America in the territory between the Canadian Cree, the Yaqui and Tarahumare of Mexico, and the Carib and Arawak of the Antilles.

Hey, wait a minute, that sounds like us. In fact, Miner's paper was a satire that played off anthropologists and Americans at the same time.

Back in 2005, journalist Borat Sagdiyev came to America to makea documentary about America for the enlightenment of his countrymen, The result: ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,""

Both Miner and Borat (created and played by English comedian Baron Cohen) hit the mark by self-consciously missing it.

Borat shows up on our shores in a gray suit,

a small Afro and a penciled in Moustache that may remind some viewers of Depp Throat.  He is a mysoginist and an anti-semite. He is also a customer of his sister ""the number four prostitute in Kazakhstan"".

The genius of this movie is that Borat plays these attributes for laughs. He uses the warm feelings generated among people who share even the vilest prejudice to produce some scenes-a singalong

that includes the chorus `throw the Jew down the well'-that would be hard to believe were they not so utterly believeable.

The Anti-Defamation League has expressed concern that everyone might not know that this is satire. That's part of the joke too. Cohen, as a Jew himself, knows a lot about anti-semitism, especially the casual, british variety. His well-tuned ear is what leads him to find it so easily here.

But the laughs here are not all about Borat's prejudices. I won't spoil the many sight gags, although I can assure you that you'll never look at Trump Tower the same way again.

The film is not mere college gross-out fare. In fact, it operates on several levels at once. The double satire is laced with some fine physical comedy-it's hard to resist some spoiling here-and some very sharp observation.

Borat has the irresistable charm of exposing meanness as form of stupidity and giving us the chance to laugh at it. I imagine that the Borat phenomenon will continue from here-at least as long as we have a supply of national stupidity to fuel it. Look for Borat as a correspondent on the Daily Show or a columnist in Heeb magazine.

In any case, there is something brewing here and you should catch it in the early stages.

Okay, I did a preview before, about 6 months ago, but this is an EDIT of that preview, so the actual viewing of this movie happened on Saturday, November 11, 2006.  Therefore, the 7 of 34 helpful votes you see might be reflective of that prior review.  ""Reviewers of reviewers"" can be so cruel!

I saw this movie with my brother in a packed theater!  I rarely see movies in the theater anymore.  I just don't see the point of paying $7 - $10 for the movie, than $15, three to six months later for the DVD?  What's the point!  But my brother generously invited me, and I have to say, I'm very glad I accepted his invitation!  This movie was absolutely hilarious!  I think it was 10 X funnier than any movie I've seen in the past 10 years.  I even joked with my bro, I told him, I think that was even funnier than ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"" it being one of those movies that we saw as a kid, and thought was so hilarious, but if we were to watch it as adults, would think it was pretty stupid!

POSSIBLE SPOILERS:
But this movie, Borat, we saw as adults, and got to laugh as kids again.  Wow!  What a rush!  I think the whole ""man on man"" love thing, was possibly the most hilarious thing ever caught on film!  I think his obsession with Pamela Anderson was also very funny!  Question:  Did Pamela act, or was she surprised by his attack at the Virgin Records store?  My brother and I were discussing that for a while!

If you want to laugh as kids, but over very adult material, than go see this one, or rent it!  But be warned:  the material is quite adult.  I'm surprised this was Rated R, and not NC 17.  It was pretty bad.  Trust me!  You won't be sorry
