8666214,5,B00LJHZ0TE,"Andr&eacute; Tchaikowskys The Merchant of Venice was written in the years leading up to his premature death in 1982 but, despite interest from ENO in the 1980s, it did not get a full performance until David Pountney decided to stage it at the the 2013 Bregenz Festival with Keith Warner directing.  Its hard to explain the neglect though Pountney ascribes it some degree as the fate of the emigr&eacute;  (the composer being a Polish Jew domiciled in the UK).  The Merchant of Venice is a really solid piece.  Its got all the elements; a strong story, a really interesting but not overly intimidating score and really good writing for voice (it really is singable).  Its the right length at around two and a half hours and it doesnt call for unreasonable orchestral or vocal forces.  John OBriens libretto even manages to overcome some of the objections to staging Shakespeares play.  While one might consider the Shakespeare piece to be antisemitic, OBriens libretto is much more clearly about anti-semitism.  Theres also a clear homoerotic element in the Antonio  Bassanio relationship and perhaps too in Portia  Nerissa.

Its also very much a work of three acts (four really).  In Act 1 the scene is set with the bond between Antonio and Shylock, Jessicas elopement and so on.  Shylock is clearly an outsider in a Christian world but its fairly subtle at this point.  Act 2, with the lottery for Portias marriage and so on is a kind of scherzo; comic relief almost before the trial scene of Act 3.  Act 3 is almost unbearable.  It portrays the sheer relentless injustice of Shylocks trial.  Hes not a sympathetic character of course.  The real injustices that he has suffered have driven him in a horrible direction but its Portia in her guise of the lawyer who really terrifies.  The quality of mercy is severely strained as she relentlessly uses the law to destroy the Jew.  Its legally correct yet flagrantly unjust and modern parallels aren't hard to find.  I guess Portia just didn't quite need a water cannon.  Theres also an epilogue in which Christian domesticity, or at least some sort of four cornered version of it, is restored and the inconvenient Jew forgotten.

David Warners production is fairly straightforward.  He sets it in the early 20th century where anti-Semitism is credible but Jews don't have to look like caricatures.  Interestingly the only uses of stereotypical Jewish caricature elements are by the Christians when they are taunting Shylock.  The opera is framed by a cameo of Antonio and his, presumably Jewish, psychiatrist which is thought provoking.  The main set feature is a wall of safes that can be reconfigured to form various domestic and public spaces.  Most of this happens on the fly so that the action is fairly continuous. The characters are well drawn and he think he does a good job of morally positioning Shylock and his adversaries.  There are some neat comic touches with rather over thee top suitors in Act 2 and the Epilogue has a kind of surreal quality that belies the events that precede it.

The cast is very decent though far from starry.  Adrian Er&ouml;d, looking like a cross between Abe Lincoln and Russell Braun, gives a strongly sung and multi-faceted performance as Shylock.  The ever reliable Charles Workman is an excellent Bassanio.  Christopher Ainslie, a countertenor, is convincing dramatically as a depressive, insecure and rather unlikeable Antonio.  Critics of the stage production complained that he was underpowered and sometimes he seems that way when singing with Workman but for the most part its not an issue on disc.  Portia is sung by Magdalena Anna Hofmann.  Shes convincing and sounds good in Act 2 and the Epilogue but a little forced in the trial scene.  This though may be deliberate and is not unreasonable.  Verena Gunz is a charming and rather funny Nerissa.  The minor roles are all more than adequate.  Erik Nielsen conducts and makes a convincing case for the score ably supported by the Wiener Symphonker and the Prague Philharmonic Choir.

Felix Breisachs direction for film is fine.  When he uses non theatrical angles its to good effect.  There are times when the set looks best from high up for example.  The picture and sound (DTS-HD) on Blu-ray are of the expected high quality.  Theres a 50 minute documentary Journey to Bregenz  The Planning of an Opera that is well worth watching in its own right and as an aid to understanding the piece and the production.  The booklet contains a track listing and synopsis and two short but thoughtful essays by Pountney.  Subtitle options are English, German, French and Polish.

In some ways The Merchant of Venice might seem an odd text for a first opera by a depressive, homosexual Polish Jew but the way the story is treated rather explains itself.  Certainly its a very worthwhile edition to the catalogue of late 20th operas and this disc presents it to advantage.",1481068800,2,4912,4.8731884057971016
8666215,1,B00LJHZ0TE,surprisingly good performance and recording quality and well organized shots of lake bregenz and an entire disc devoted to the making of the production - not bad for a contemporary work by a recently deceased composer. Good incidental pictures of the lake at Bregenz.,1477180800,,267,5.090909090909091
8666216,2,B00LJHZ0TE,"I found it difficult to watch his opera.  The Merchant of Venice is Shakespeare's anti Jewish play.  True, it was based on an historical incident, but in the original account it was the Christian who demanded the pound of flesh from the Jew!  Yet it's fun to play villains and Shylock is a juicy role and some productions try to downplay the hatred in the play.  Not this one which emphasizes the fiction that  Jews have little better to do with their lives than revenge themselves on kind, giving Christians.  I've read that Andre Tchaikowsky was Jewish, and this opera is quite worthy.  I found the music, as much as I heard, OK, but could not get past the production.",1424044800,,670,4.533333333333333
