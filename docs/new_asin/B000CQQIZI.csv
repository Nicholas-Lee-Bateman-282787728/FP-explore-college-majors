8100676,3,B000CQQIZI,"This is a good (2000) overview of the Dark Ages. However they had to cram a lot of history and speculation in to 50 minutes. Written David Manson and narrated by John Viner.

The presentation gives a blow by blow account of who divvied up what areas on the British Isle and surrounding area.

Other than some good shots of Offa's Dyke Path National Trail there is nothing unique about this presentation.",1396224000,,403,4.583333333333333
8100677,3,B000CQQIZI,"It's difficult to compress the Dark Ages into a 50 minute DVD, but this attempt is middling worthy of its epic topic, though it's a bit thin. Many talking heads, and some re-enactments mar the effort. It's ok to watch if you get it from the library.",1250035200,2,249,4.319148936170213
8100678,4,B000CQQIZI,"This unique documentary presents Dark Ages England well using local footage, stylish period reconstructions, schematics, 3D graphics and animations, and expert interpretations and analyses.  The sound and picture quality is good.",1203120000,2,229,6.387096774193548
8100679,2,B000CQQIZI,"This had a nice survey history of England from the fall of Rome until the arrival of William the Conqueror.  Nothing is said about Ireland or Scotland and that may disappoint some.  The work even contextualizes the term ""Dark Ages.""

As a 21st-Century American, it's easy to say ""English"" and mean ""British.""  We moderns have to remember England, Scotland, and Wales.  However, this documentary showed that the Island was cut up in many different ways centuries ago.  I learn about kingdoms such as Wessex and Northumbria, etc.  There is much focus on the Vikings and thus Scandinavians and their descendants in the United States may find that interesting.

This work had many cheesy reenactments when the art of the time would have sufficed.  The work applauds itself for its 3-D graphics, but I wasn't awed by that.",1170547200,4,817,4.905109489051095
