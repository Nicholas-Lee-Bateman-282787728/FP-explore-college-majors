2175782,5,B00068S3UK,"Based on a real event, due to miscalculations in fueling the plane using the metric system, a routine flight runs out of fuel in flight and it's up to the flight crew to land the plane safely. A good, solid, tautly suspenseful airplane disaster movie that proves you don't need profanity, explosions, or fast-paced cinematography to make a good, suspenseful movie. And a fine performance from a fine cast! Don't miss this one! An excellent addition to the library of airplane disaster movies.",1112572800,40,492,4.9397590361445785

2175786,5,B00068S3UK,"I love this movie Freefall flight 174. The story is breath taking and it is a really happened movie. First you see a short review of the lifes of the people who get on board of the plane, also the crew, pilots etc.
Then you see that they have a problem, because they got toooo less kerosine. It is very well played, it is breath taking and also a happy ending. It is worth every dollar.",1257379200,,386,4.092105263157895
2175787,5,B00068S3UK,"This is one great ""obscure"" movie.  People do not know this movie exists but almost everyone in the aviation industry has heard about it or about the real event behind it.  Once you see it, you realize the complexity of life for being a pilot, the immense responsibility that lies on his / her shoulders and you finally realize why air travel is so safe.  Everyone makes mistakes and it takes a whole lot of skill and training - which EVERY pilot gets - to overcome potential disastrous situations.  Most of the people riding comfortably in the back of an airplane have no idea of what really goes on the other side of the door, the side where the controls are.  As far as they are concerned, the airplanes take-off, land, carry them from point A to point B and that's it, oblivious to the fact that the simple fact that an airplane goes into the air takes skill, training, will to provide quality customer service and a GREAT responsibility that not just anyone can and wants to provide.
The way the movie was put together, is very realistic, very close to what happened and with just minimal ""Hollywood"" extras, really gives you an idea of what pilots have to deal with every day they go to work.  Still think they are overpayed?!",1240185600,4,1232,4.502242152466367
2175788,4,B00068S3UK,"This was a good movie for less than ten dollars. It was originally a TV movie, but it is still good.  Some people here gave some bad reviews but I didn't find anything wrong with it. It was good, suspenseful, had a plot, all that stuff. Makes for good clean entertainment. Recommended especially if you like airplane films, lots of tower-talk, etc.",1214611200,3,348,4.612903225806452
2175789,4,B00068S3UK,"this movie is based on true events that occoured the biggest problems were that the sites they used were not the actual sites such as winnipeg international airport, gimil drag strip so in reality the movie while based on facts, was not shot at the actual locations they occured.  i do love the movie and that robert pearson who was the pilot of the actual air canada flight was invovled in the movie even though as a cameo apperance at the beginning. i had it on vhs but glad the dvd is available it is a very interesting movie and do recommend it as it shows what the metric conversion vs gallons can do even to us canadians who are on the metric system and was in the midst of converting to metric at the time",1184630400,,712,4.235294117647059

better is when the plane is about to touch down, looks unreal. But would

highly recommened this show.",1179100800,2,248,3.94
2175791,3,B00068S3UK,This was made for TV and depicts a real incident on a passenger jet in the 80's.  William Devane is great in this part.,1140652800,9,119,3.9583333333333335
8040301,5,B00068S3UK,"Wow, just watched it on Prime. Absolutely one of the greatest air-disaster type movies I've ever seen. Drama mixed with real world pilot scenarios. Actually 'rescares' the hell out of me for flying actually! lol  I thought being a 1994 movie, it would be low-budget and cheesy, but no. It was well acted, and portrayed. I prefer this quality of production than most of the thrillers Hollywood is spitting out these days. If it comes to DVD, I will definitely buy it.",1526601600,,466,4.682926829268292
8040302,2,B00068S3UK,"Being an aviation fan and interested in plane crashes I was excited to see this move on Amazon cuz I know the true story. But I was SO disappointed! There was no suspense (even though I knew the outcome a good movie still would've given you that edge-of-your-seat feeling) The cockpit action, which was the real story, kept getting interrupted by STUPID family drama so tacky it was like this movie was made in the 70's. Who cares if some couple can't decide to make a commitment or Mr. Businessman is too absorbed in his career to spend time with family (cliche, cliche) I tried to fast forward thru all the added-on family drama. I want the real story of the action, dialog, even technical details of what really happened, that is so much more interesting & exciting. SPOILERS but the crew and ground control knew exactly where Gimli was, the first officer had been stationed there in the air force, you don't 'lose' a military airport even if it's no longer active. And this movie so cheap they didn't even bother doing the special effects for REAL 'side-slipping' which the pilot had to do to lose altitude, the plane was flying in a side to side motion like a falling leaf and the movement was definitely felt by the passengers. And who goes back into a crashed plane AFTER KNOWING all the passengers are out safely? NO ONE. Never happened. If you want a much better version with much better special effects, accurate and a heckuva lot more exciting go to 'Air Disasters' season 1, episode 2, that show is freakin' awesome. Gave this 2 stars cuz the actual pilot who flew the real plane has a small roll in one scene.",1526342400,,1622,4.539249146757679
