4564368,1,B00548OC66,"I'm not going to waste your time with a detailed description on everything this video lacks. I'm just going to give a quick list.
1. Intensity: this video is not intermediate and definitely not advanced strictly for beginners.
2. Repetitive: You do the same moves the WHOLE time.
3. Horrid Soundtrack: Explains itself.
I would not give this video to anyone weather they are a beginner or not. Save your money.",1357171200,4,409,4.774647887323944
4564369,3,B00548OC66,"I purchased the Kickboxing workout because this style is one of my favorites. This is my first experience with Janis Saffell as an instructor. I found her style (as well as one of the other instructor's) to be well spoken and easy to follow. I also found the value (4 DVDs for a great price) to be a benefit. I did not, however, find the workouts to be challenging nor much of a cardio routine. Based on the value and ease of instructors, I would recommend it for beginners or those new to exercise but not for more advanced.",1353974400,9,525,4.313131313131313

4564371,5,B00548OC66,I own basically every single one of Janis Saffell's fitness DVDs. The price is incredible for 4 such excellent quality DVDs. If you like kickboxing you MUST purchase her DVDs. I love Billy Blanks but sometimes I get bored with his DVDs and some times the motivational yelling can be a bit much in those. So that is how I discovered Janis years ago. She does excellent kickboxing combinations- with proper alignment and she is NOT annoying like almost every other female cardio instructor out there. She is pleasant- and has an AMAZING body. Not too skinny or overly buff. You can't go wrong with any Janis DVD!!!!,1342310400,28,613,4.685185185185185
4564372,5,B00548OC66,Instructor Gomez has a lot of experience in martial art which helps in understanding kicking and punching along with many techniques.,1331769600,5,133,5.380952380952381
4564373,5,B00548OC66,"I had not done any of Sensei Guillermo Gomez's workouts until this week.  I must say, after purchasing two, I am hooked.  I had decided to buy them after watching some clips available on collage video.  This will give you a good idea of his instruction style.  They looked good and I was looking for something to amp up the burn for me on days when I need more cardio....this completely fit the bill.

The set is basic, hardwood floors, with a Japanese banner and just his two exercisers.  It is a simple set up and completely works for this type of workout.  The music was not overpowering, and seemed to fit the routines, just giving you a little bit of a driving beat to keep you motivated but not be distracting.

The workout itself is excellent.  Sensei Gomez cues the moves perfectly, showing and instructing good form, keeping you motivated without being over-the-top and keeping you working at peak.

The workout is 37 minutes of actual boxing and 5 minutes of cooldown.  There are also 10 minutes of extra martial arts drills that you will need a special mat for if you decide to try them (a martial arts or gymnastic type mat).

Overall, a great workout, an excellent instructor and a fantastic workout to help you torch those calories in a fun way!",1328313600,10,1259,4.546666666666667
4564374,5,B00548OC66,"Guillermo leads this fun 40 minute kickboxing routinein a nice open set with Asian styling. You won't need any equipment for this workout. The dvd also contains a 4 min kickboxing basics tutorial and a 10 min bonus martial arts drills segment.

Guillermo does a fantastic job of really keeping things moving along, working up a great sweat, fun but NOT complicated or boring choreo, and his cuing is excellent.

solid intermediate workout that is really appropriate for most all fitness levels- add some weighted gloves to amp up the intensity, or tone it down for a lighter day.

4564385,4,B00548OC66,"I'm writing this based on doing one of the DVD's so far (I did preview two of the others, just haven't done them yet).  The one DVD I've used is Hardcore kickboxing (with Guillermo and Janis).  I was skeptical at first as other reviewers have said this is for beginners.  While I can see this could be easier than some other workouts, it is possible to increase the intensity (ie: wearing hand weights, jogging in place, etc).  I found myself enjoying the different segments, each with a different routine.  The moves were more innovative than some other kickboxing workouts (think Tae Bo) and I like Guillermo and Janis.  I also liked that the DVD is set up so that you can skip over sections (for example, I did all the cardio sections first, then the sculpting) and tailor your workout to what you feel like doing. I'm looking forward to doing the other workouts!",1481760000,,866,4.590909090909091

4564406,4,B00548OC66,"I own Janis Saffell's 10 min quick fix cardio kickboxing DVD and love it, so I figured I would try this set for more of a challenge. When the set arrived, I decided to try one of the workouts on a weekend because I have more time to work out. I read the descriptions of the each DVD and decided to try the hardcore underground DVD.

What I liked:
- Great workout, I did work up a sweat
- Pretty easy to follow, the instructor repeats what he wants you to do
- Not boring
- Contains a warm up and cool down

What I did not like:
- The production value is a bit low (compared to Janis Saffell's 10 min quick fix video)
- The camera person zooms in and out way too much

I will add another review once I finish working my way through the other DVDs in this series. I would recommend this DVD to someone who is not new to kickboxing.",1451174400,2,829,3.9520958083832336

4564424,4,B00548OC66,"Giving 4 stars for now because I haven't been using this very long.

I just found out about Guillermo Gomez via an email newsletter where he wrote an article for MyFitnessPal - I liked the tone of the article and was interested to learn more about him and his style. I'm always interested in kickboxing... Back in the late 90's, I was taking a kickboxing aerobic class at a small local gym and it was before the whole Tae Bo video explosion. I really loved my instructor and the simplicity of the class. Some of the moves or combinations were not simple, but it was not really complicated with lots of up/down position changes, like I see nowadays. In a short time, I had lost 30 pounds taking that class and I enjoyed doing it. Anyways, that instructor left and although I've tried several kickboxing workouts since, I never liked them as much. It seems like the Billy Blanks / Tae Bo craze changed the way everyone taught their kickboxing class.

Until I came across this video! This video is the style I like - basic moves done at an accelerated pace - not bouncing around to crazy dance music with girls in the background yelling ""Woooo!"" every 10 seconds. (The Cardio Burn and Cardio Dance videos from this series look to be the style that I don't like, but to each their own!)

Anyways, this has turned into a long rant, but I'm very happy to have found this video and am excited to use it over the next few months while I work towards my weight loss goals. :)",1414540800,5,1466,4.402214022140221
4564435,3,B00548OC66,"It's easy to learn, yes.  You do sweat some, yes.  However, the moves keep building on old ones, so you repeat all the moves from (a), then (a)+(b), then (a)+(b)+(c) and so on for the WHOLE TIME, which I found absolutely boring.  I much prefer Jessica Smith's Knockout Body or Cathe Friedrich's Xtrain: Hard Strikes, which are varied and fun.  So if you don't like repeating the same move over and over again, my advice is to skip this.  I'm donating this to the local library.",1414281600,2,477,4.5
4564436,4,B00548OC66,I enjoyed it. It is fast paced and keeps you moving. Great combos. An overall good workout.,1413849600,,91,4.411764705882353

4564445,4,B00548OC66,"It came with four DVD's and different workouts which were long enough that you could skip the weight sections and continue onto cardio and still get a decent workout. Speaking of which, the workouts themselves were fun and easy to follow but still made one sweat. Personally, I preferred the workouts featuring Guillermo Gomez as they were more focused on kicks and combinations at a slightly higher difficulty whereas the workouts featuring Janis felt more like review for those already familiar with the types of punches and kicks. However, if one wanted to focus more on strength they would probably prefer her style of adding in weights. Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase.",1380672000,5,685,5.017543859649122

Her moves are complicated,and hard to follow, she relies too much on doing knees and therefore the workout becomes repetitious. Guillermo Gomez on the otherhand is a great workout instructor, and I really enjoy doing his workouts. My favorite DVD being Kickbox Underground, and if you can get past his accent you will also enjoy them. I also really like the music accompanying these DVD's, which makes up for the bad video quality. My conclusion being this a great buy, but may not meet everybody workout DVD standards.",1376352000,5,672,4.752136752136752

4564450,4,B00548OC66,"So far I have only tried 2 of the 4 DVDs included in this set.  The strike zone workout is great.  I have done a couple of kickboxing workouts before so I'm not completely new to it, but I think even if I was this would be a good workout.  Janis, the instructor goes over the moves nice and slowly before you have to do them.  The second part of the workout is for you and a partner but they also show you how to do it if you are by yourself, which is the part I do.  Overall the workout is a nice challenge but not too hard.

I did not like the second workout kick it.  This one was more challenging because it had some harder routines in it.  I also was not a fan of the camera work.  I would be trying to focus on the peoples' feet so I could see what to do and then the camera would move all around and show their faces and hands.  If you were someone who really knew what you were doing this would be okay, but since it was my first time doing it I wanted to be able to see what their feet were doing.

Overall I would highly recommend this workout even though the second one isn't so great.  The price for 4 dvds is cheaper then some single dvd sets and I would have happily paid that price for just the first workout.  I also still have the last 2 to try.",1372377600,3,1262,3.8638132295719845

He doesn't over-complicate the workout with unnecessary banter and footwork. Also, unlike Tony Horton in P90X he doesn't call everyone dude and ramble on so I can actually keep the sound up. This is nothing fancy so if you're looking for an ""Insanity""-type workout then this isn't it. However, I get a decent cardio workout in a short amount of time. Also, like any type of exercise, it's up to you to make it easy or difficult. You can go through the motions or go for broke. It's entirely up to you.",1363132800,9,645,4.6173913043478265

You find yourself doing an entire kickboxing routine in no time! Strike Zone is the easiest DVD with a simple yet effective kickboxing workout. The Kick It DVD is the most challenging as far as technique goes but after you do it once or twice it's easier to keep up with the steps. Kickboxing Underground reminds me of Strike Zone because it's slower paced but still a nice workout. Hardcore kickboxing is the most physically demanding as it's 55 minutes of kickboxing and strength training circuits.

If you are looking for a quick workout with a lot of downtime something to do in 15-20 minutes ORDER Guillermo Gomez Kickbox bootcamp. 20 minutes 3 days a week will help alot",1485475200,2,523,4.087378640776699

I have done Tae Bo and Les Mills Combat and these videos are right up there with them, his cueing and technique tips are great and the workouts are top notch, with built-in intervals, you really burn calories.

My only beef is with the videos where he has 2 women working out with him, and calls them ""girls"" - I try not to let it get to me, but it kinda grates on my nerves.

If you like kickboxing for your workouts, you have to try Guillermo Gomez. Start with Kickboxing Cardio Blast, it's just Guillermo by himself, an excellent introduction  to him and his technique.",1485475200,2,654,4.300813008130081
