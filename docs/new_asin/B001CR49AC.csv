8288817,5,B001CR49AC,"This Originally aired as a PBS Special. It is well done. Many key people are interviewed and it tells the history of the cathedral, especially the last few years of construction. Music from the cathedral choir and Marine Corps band are heard throughout the video. I recommend watching this prior to seeing the Cathedral, as you will appreciate the effort behind it. I was moved by watching it and recommend it to anyone.",1249862400,7,420,4.767123287671233
