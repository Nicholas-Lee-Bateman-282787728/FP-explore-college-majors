8686280,5,B00P2SA9P6,"Absolutely insightful. Brings to light the parallels between the Old Testament of the Passover in the land of Egypt and the Passion of Christ. The symbolism and the steps are so exceptional as to call it a divine inspiration. So intricately put and each step coinciding with the next step between the two. I had so much more knowledge of what the Eucharist is about and the how and why of the Eucharist and Passion. If you really want to become inflamed by the Holy Spirit and the Eucharist; it is like a marriage ceremony for the whole world to see. I would not ever have enough insight as to do this just once, but over and over to remind myself to whom I owe my whole life to.",1437091200,2,679,4.271317829457364
