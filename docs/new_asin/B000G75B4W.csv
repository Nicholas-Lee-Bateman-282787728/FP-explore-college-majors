2601919,5,B000G75B4W,This is an essential Stephen King collection...a lot of his earlier works..well worth the price if you enjoy Stephen King,1212105600,5,121,5.1
2601920,5,B000G75B4W,"Certainly, my opinion is subjective because I like this sort of fare, silly and all. ""Graveyard Shift"" is indeed the weakest one, made entertaining by the bad acting of all involved. ""Pet Sematary"" is also badly acted, though Fred Gwynne is on hand to save much of it. It's one of King's more mean-spirited plots, and if there was humor involved (as the extras purport), I missed most of it. ""Silver Bullet"" is an odd film, a rather sweet coming-of-age film with a twist. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. (Even Corey Haim was almost tolerable.) And, of course, the special edition of ""The Dead Zone"" stands way above the rest. Fine acting and direction help secure its place among the best King films. Save it for last...OK, some are silly and mindless, but I like most horror films for that very reason. This collection has the added benefit of a couple of winners. The widescreen transfer is excellent. The price is good. I recommend it...all 4 are true to King, inasmuch as they all take place in Maine.",1174176000,13,1015,4.582417582417582
2601921,4,B000G75B4W,"I give five stars for The Dead Zone and Silver Bullet. I give four stars to Pet Semetary. Zero stars go to Graveyard Shift. All in all, it is a good set that is worth the price for three of the films. Just buy it for The Dead Zone, Silver Bullet, and Pet Semetary.",1160352000,5,264,3.9074074074074074

2601929,5,B000G75B4W,"This collection is awesome! I love Stephen King's books, and the movies on their own are great for that era! I know a lot of people get upset because the book storylines don't follow to the letter, but I like to think that the adaptation uses the book just as a ""backbone"" to build off of. I thoroughly enjoyed this set!",1496448000,,320,4.262295081967213

2601932,5,B000G75B4W,"Age tends to warp ones mind.  I clearly remember watching Graveyard Shift (about twenty years ago the first time) and thinking boy is this stupid but I just watched it again and it wasn't that bad.  The movie was about a drifter who takes a job at a textile mill and gets put on the graveyard shift only to discover that the mill had a secret, they built a hell of a set for that movie.  The Dead Zone is another one.  I couldn't get into it when I saw it a hundred years ago (at least it seems like that long) but now I have a deeper appreciation for it.  Christopher Walken was great as John Smith who has the power to not only see the future but change it.  Pet Sematary, things start going wrong for the Creed family and get worse after their neighbor introduces Louis Creed to a burial ground with the power to bring the dead back to life...  Finally Silver Bullet, the story of a town plagued by a werewolf as told from the view of the older sister of Marty, a paraplegic kid (played by Corey Haim).  Marty and his sister get into trouble when they mess with the werewolf and enlist their Uncle Red (played by Gary Busey) to help them.  All good movies and I got the collection from Walmart for ten bucks, can't go wrong with that...",1487808000,,1239,4.194092827004219

2601954,4,B000G75B4W,A nice collection of Stephen King stories made into movies.  The Dead Zone has always been my favorite and I already owned it on DVD but the other three are more obscure and harder to find now on DVD which made the purchase worth while.  The quality was as good as could be expected for the years in which they were filmed.,1432944000,,323,4.193548387096774
2601955,5,B000G75B4W,"This is a great collection of Stephen King movies and each movie comes to $5, (based on $20 for the package), which is a great deal. There is another edition of this product which is more expensive (product description says Special Collector's Edition for The Dead Zone and Pet Sematary) but this one also contains the special collector's edition for those movies. It must be one of those instances where the same product gets cataloged separately so there appears to be two different editions where in fact they are exactly the same (this happens mostly when the product is offered by third party sellers).

Video and audio quality more than meets my expectations (for standard DVD) and all movies have subtitles. The Dead Zone and Pet Sematary, being the special collector's edition, have a few special features.

I think all of the movies in this collection are pretty decent adaptations of Stephen King novels (or stories). Silver Bullet is the main reason why I bought this product as it is one of my favorite werewolf movies along with An American Werewolf in London and The Howling. WARNING: If you have not seen Silver Bullet or not read the novel, DO NOT go to the setup screen on the DVD menu. The picture on the setup menu is a major spoiler and a giveaway that may spoil the surprise. Why the production company would choose to put that picture on the setup menu is beyond me.  The Dead Zone is a pretty good adaptation if not perfect. You know how difficult it is to adapt a Stephen King novel. And this is no more apparent than with Pet Sematary. Although it delivers some good scares and ok as a movie, I can see why some fans were not happy with it. It does move a little too fast and leaves out some of the psychological buildup. It also has a feeling of a tv movie (not quite sure how to describe that). I didn't like the ""Enhanced for wide screen TV 16x9"" presentation. I am still not clear as to what that means but all the images looked elongated vertically. They looked like a little stretched out and filled up the screen as if they were shot with standard lens. I am not sure what is meant by  widescreen enhanced version; there may be a setting on my blu ray player to fix that but I didn't bother.

Graveyard Shift is my second favorite movie in this collection. Even though it has a very low rating on IMDB.com, and despite some negative reviews (probably from younger viewers), I think the movie works great as a horror movie. It is a monster movie based on a short story and the movie works for what it is. I think the production value in Graveyard shift is probably better than Pet Sematary. I think they did a fantastic job creating that eerie atmosphere in the dark tunnels, some danger lurking in the dark, you cannot quite see it, but the tension is there. I didn't expect a lot of character development but I think all of the actors did an excellent job. This may feel like a B monster movie but acting is far better than any B movie you may have seen. Special effects were awesome. I am glad this movie was made back then because if it was made today, all of the rats and the monster would be CGI. Well, actually even the tunnels, locations, machinery, etc. everything would be CGI.

Overall, I definitely recommend this set to any horror fan or Stephen King fan. We still need a more comprehensive Stephen King movie collection (maybe a Blu ray box set) but until then, this will nicely do the job.",1430697600,15,3435,4.453100158982512
2601956,5,B000G75B4W,"It is awesome, Graveyard Shift was scratched bad but after rubbing some alcohol across it, it's doing just fine. Great movies, ive never seen these and Pet Sematary had me on the edge of my seat. Oh my God, they don't make movies like this anymore.

2601968,4,B000G75B4W,"If you enjoy Brad Dourif's work, GRAVEYARD SHIFT is for you. I really enjoyed him as the exterminator in this film. He has a certain over-the-top knack for performance that makes him an indespensible character actor in any role that must be played with intensity.

He has made many important screen appearances in the X-Files, Alien 4, ""Exorcist III"" as the Gemini Killer (1990), and Grma Wormtongue in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy (and many others). His unique acting style made all these films special for me.",1242604800,2,528,4.866666666666666
