5161433,4,B008H1Q36O,"I thought this was a very cute movie. Perfect for young kids, especially dog lovers. My daughter is 8 and loved it. It obviously wasn't produced with the biggest budget or best script, but I believe she'll enjoy watching it over and over simply because it is entertaining and humerous. There were a couple of snotty kids but they get put in their place by the end of the movie. A couple of ""you guys suck"" is really the only objectionable words. The explanation as to why the dog ate gelatin instead of drinking blood made perfect sense! More simple, funny, sweet stories like this should be produced for kids, in my opinion. We also enjoyed the gag reel during the end credits. :) I would recommend this movie for 5-12 year olds.",1348790400,4,730,4.496240601503759

5161455,1,B008H1Q36O,"This is a really, really awful movie with absolutely no redeeming qualities.  It has the same basic plot as ""Home Alone,""  a beautifully-done comedy about a brave child thwarting bad guys.  But ""Vampire Dog"" is such a spectacularly incompetent film, I can't recommend it for humans of any age.  If I had three-year-olds, I'd be embarrassed for them to see this mess.  Poorly acted, awfully written, badly directed, this movie has every element to make it deserving to never be seen by anyone.

One of the most embarrassing aspects of the story, which hinges on a dog who thinks he needs cherry Jello to stay alive, is that they can't say the word ""Jello""  for trademark infringement reasons.  So every time Jello is mentioned, which is a lot, they say ""jelly"" instead.

This movie is NOT for families - unless you have or want a family of idiots.  I am so, so sorry I wasted time watching this trash.",1404518400,,900,4.60377358490566

5161460,1,B008H1Q36O,"Okay, I took one for the team and watched most of this.  I fell sound asleep during it, and when I tried to watch the rest it fried my DVR ...

It's ... just awful.  Not fun awful.  It's just ... something a relative would 'create' and you have to dutifully sit through it.

There's this dog who 500 years ago helped his owner kill Dracula, the last vampyre (who nobody in this world has apparently heard of) and got bit by Vlad Tepes by mistake, and has been living with the descendants of the owner for centuries.  The last guy dies and sends Fang (clever, eh?) to go live with the new owner, a 12 year old kid (who looks disturbingly like Jessica Alba) who just moved to Moose Jaw with his widowed mother.

You see, there's this school, and it's going to be closed, and only she can save it by revitalizing it's music program (which consists of 12 bored kids that can't play a note) so it can win the battle of the bands, at which point it will become a charter school and live forever.  The principal is trying to foil this and force the school to close for reasons never revealed to us.  To this end he's apparently hired the kid's mom to save the music program even though that's the exact opposite of what he wants.  Much much later in the film, he's offered a bribe to close the school by someone he's never met before, so we still don't know why he wanted to close it before, and we never find out why the evil woman that bribed him wants it closed, either.

Said evil woman is trying to create a go away wrinkles product that she's already presold millions of units to KillMore Cosmetics (that's the biggest laugh to be found here) and somehow realizes that she needs the DNA of a vampire dog to complete the formula and luckily the only one there is just moved to Moose Jaw ... the dog needs to eat 'Red Jelly' constantly (apparently in Canada they call Jello 'Jelly' and 'Red' is a flavor)  New kid is the bestest drummer of them all but can't play in front of other people, and his new friend Skye is the science wiz who realizes that all Fang needs to do to run in the sunlight is take over the counter generic allergy medication (and why he eats Red Jelly).  Lots of action takes place in the school lunch kitchen, which is just a regular kitchen with one stove/oven and two lunch ladies.

The kid tells Fang not to ever talk in front of his mother ... for no reason whatsoever.  The mean girls win the battle of the bands so for the most part, evil triumphs, and the school they hate is saved.  The principal is fired and the evil cosmetics woman and her goofy assistant arrested by the cop on charges of 'chasing kids around'  It's never made clear why they don't just offer the kid $5 for some dog DNA - it's not like they want it for any bad reason, it's just wrinkle cream, and they don't want a sample of brain tissue or anything.  From the writer of ... hmm, she has no other credits of any kind whatsover, and from the director of ... some special FX work on Tru Calling.  The dog's voice is the worst part; the Skye actress is the best.  With Spike as Fang, and Myeva Surjik as Cafeteria Lady #1.",1399680000,2,3120,4.229342327150085
5161461,3,B008H1Q36O,"My older child and I found the plot lacking, cinematography dull, and nothing in it that would catch a general audience.  I would not watch it again  - but my 10 year old liked it well enough",1394582400,,191,4.135135135135135

5161470,4,B008H1Q36O,Vampire Dog is a great movie. The dog is real cute and the plot is funny. I bought two copies for my two sets of grandchildren. Not scary for the little ones.,1371945600,,158,3.96875
5161471,2,B008H1Q36O,"I didn't have high expectations when I watched this, but I thought there were 2 very separate quality levels.

It views like a disney channel pre-teen love story with a slight supernatural twist. All that was acceptable. Not great acting, not a super story, but for what it was, it was cute. I'd give that 3 stars.

My problem was the whole band angle.

Band teacher and son go to 'save' a school from closing by whipping it's band into shape to become a charter school. The band (pardon the pun) sucks. There's mention of a battle of the bands to prove that the teacher can turn the school into a good music program and save the school.

4 kids from the school band decide they're going to make a band for the battle of the bands and play some rock song. I thought this was supposed to be a school band competition? The quad appear to actually have some talent from the 10 seconds we hear of them. They play actual 'band instruments' in band compared to the guitars and piano for the 'battle of the bands'.

Battle of the bands comes around, there's 2 ""jazz ensembles"" who don't appear to be playing jazz (1 'ensemble' is a kid on a recorder playing not jazz music badly), then our rock quad come out and our 'hero' replaces the drummer.

And I don't know about most schools, but I've only ever seen a drum set used for a school band song once. Jazz band used it all the time, but never regular band. (I've seen string bass used in school band more often than a drum set.)

At the end it shows the actual school band in class improved about 90% from the original noise they made. The band stuff did not fit into the movie at all and probably could've been dropped completely (or modified to have it be a garage band competition vs school band).

I have to wonder if whoever wrote the screenplay was ever in band (or listened to jazz music) to know what they wrote doesn't work for those who've been in band and have listened to a school jazz band.",1370908800,,1948,4.30327868852459

It's about a sweet vampire dog, who's voice is done by a comedian

The story is sweet, fun, and kid friendly.
My little girl loves it, and sometimes we like to cuddle and watch it
together.
It has some great life lessons in it too that are very age appropriate for
her.
She first saw it when she was about 5 years old, and she's almost 6.5 years now,
and in Kindergarten. :)

5161474,4,B008H1Q36O,"Vampire Dog is a family friendly film about a twelve year old boy and his new dog named Fang that he has been bequeathed to care for. As you can probably guess from the title the dog turns out to be no ordinary dog and has some very peculiar powers, habits and phobias because of the oddities of being a 600-year-old canine from Transylvania.

I don't want to ruin the whole story for you so I am going to be a bit vague at the plot. I did notice some inconsistencies in the script and film, but still I thought that the movie was cute and great for younger kids especially. My kids seemed to enjoy how the story unfolded and turned out. This is live action with CG animation. This wholesome ""tail"" about friendship, teamwork and courage is wonderful for a Halloween flick.

A rotary phone is..ahhhhhhhh never mind. Anyway...this movie had a few holes in it. Here are two now: the dog is a vampire and it can talk. Somewhat implausible on both counts. BUT in its defense the movie did have a message, and I believe that message is ""For the love of God, don't let them make Vampire Dog 2!"" Unless, of course, Norm returns. So..relax. It's for kids, who, incidentally, will watch anything! Have a drink, or 4, and enjoy.",1351209600,,616,4.3652173913043475
5161483,5,B008H1Q36O,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie when we rented it, but we all thoroughly enjoyed it. They do a good job of making the dog a vampire dog without making it too gruesome in the details of HOW he became one and what he lives on. Apparently, vampire dogs live on collagen / gelatin, hence the need for the dog to eats copious amounts of red jelly (or jello to anyone in the USA, but this being a Canadian movie, it's jelly to anyone living there or in the British Isles too).

The whole bumbling scientist plot was a little off, but added some nice moments where the cute dog outwitted the dimwitted bad guys.

All in all, we enjoyed the movie a lot, my 5 year old wants to add it to her Christmas list (she loves dog movies). The back story of the kid trying to learn how to be himself, and saving the school was something my daughter really related to aswell, being as she is in school herself.

I recommend this to any fans of the Santa Paws movies or Beverly Hills Chihuahua movies, or any similar types, it's definitely worth a look from Redbox, and you can get a $2 off voucher at their Facebook page too if you decide to buy it, although Amazon has the best price anyway and quick shipping.
