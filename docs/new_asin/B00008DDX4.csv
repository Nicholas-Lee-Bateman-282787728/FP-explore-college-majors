7981853,3,B00008DDX4,"Recently started viewing Hot Body products, and it is clear they vary in quality from mediocre to pretty darn hot. This one is middle of the pack, but worth a look if you're into fresh faces from the Pacific Northwest and glorious, glorious pink.

1. The Girls - mostly cute, no beauty queens, except for the competition ""winner"" Faith, who is a natural-breasted, busty, girl-next-door brunette beauty. Overall, you'll probably find half the babes pretty hot. Nice variety of natural and augmented boobs.

2. The scenes - production, lighting (you see what you really want to see), etc. competent if not spectacular. As always, too much voice over from the director (who loves his own voice).

3. The action - sexy if not spectacular. Each girl gets a pole dance in front of a live audience (ok), followed by a sexy, more intimate vignette (Hotter). By the book but works.

4. Pink factor - Nice- great spreads, close-ups, and acres of nice pink (always could be more). They ain't shy, which I love (unlike most other softcore producers who try to ""hide the prize"" for some reason).

Overall, nice if you like this kinda thing. Don't waste your $ on other, tamer producers. Buy cheap, burn & resell.",1147046400,6,1199,4.7451923076923075
