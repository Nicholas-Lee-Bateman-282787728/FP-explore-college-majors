7881804,4,6305072418,"This is a great VHS tape before the days when FOX use to broadcast these unique finds of viewership to the public. These are some great but sad uncensored tapes on thrills, accidents, chases, and in some cases deaths. Not for the faint of heart.  But you can find much more of these online on the internet.",1377561600,,306,4.368421052631579
7881805,5,6305072418,"The great ""Banned From Television"" series continues with this 4th installment.  This time all of the footage is inside prison walls, you will see a murder, deadly riots, hostage situations on prison ground, and much more!  Unfortunatley this video has not yet been released on DVD format, if you would like it to be please sign the ""Banned From Television: The Prison Files"" petition by logging on to [...] (CAPS LOCK MUST BE ON WHEN TYPING ""BILLYF"")",1082592000,,450,4.8311688311688314
7881806,1,6305072418,"I live in the uk,and have seen this sh*t,this is not a docu,or anything else but sick,sick,crap,it will never be avialable in the uk,anybody who watches this film and gets enjoyment from it is disturbed,and very disturbing,take my advice and don't watch this,we know people kill them selfs and get killed but we don't need to see a human being tortured and then set alight,it makes me sick thinking about it,the american censors should be ashammed of them selfs!!!!",1070064000,,465,4.89873417721519
7881807,5,6305072418,"This video is the best of all.
Made for man with guts. I said man, not kids.
Better than Faces of Death, similar to Traces of Death.
Grab a [drink], sit down and enjoy!",1039996800,3,168,3.9705882352941178
7881808,5,6305072418,"If you think you've seen it all, then think again! Although some of the shocking real-life footage on this video is not really ""banned from TV"", a lot of it is. This video is real, and not faked like the boring old Faces of Death films. Gorgon Productions (the company that made the Faces of Death videos) admitted to all of the faked deaths in their videos some time ago. Banned From Television is not fake! It is raw, real, and graphic! And it's all UNCENSORED! In this video you will see: a violent elephant rampage at a circus, sex busts, a chimney of bricks toppling over a woman, police shoot outs, a man blowing his head off w/ a shotgun, and a person being hit by a speeding train! This video is not suitable for kids nor the faint hearted. IT IS VERY GRAPHIC! This video contains nudity, sexual situations, adult language, and, of course, a lot of blood & violence.",1031443200,4,874,4.401234567901234
7881809,5,6305072418,"This has got to be the most shocking video ever!  It has gory stuff but some of it's downright hilarious!  Standouts are an elephant going on a rampage b.k.a Dumbo's Revenge, A spectator getting his pants ripped off by a bull, a lawnmower thief getting ""mowed down"" by a truck, a tower that ""gets down"" at a concert, a bust at a motel, and the finale, a dumb lady who learns a hard lesson too late as she's crossing a railroad track when the train comes in and mauls her!  I agree with anyone who says that you have to have guts to watch this and again, IT'S NOT FUNNY.....IT'S HILARIOUS!!!!!",1030147200,,592,4.315315315315315
7881810,5,6305072418,"When i first put this tape in my machine i thought,okay another so called documentary filled with fake deaths,but no truly 100% death & near death experience. I was kept on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. What some of the people were thinking of when there life was flashed before them only god knows. Iwill look forward to seeing 2 & 3 in this series. God bless the video camera. WARNING-DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM IF YOU ARE A WIMP.",982627200,2,441,4.261904761904762
