5188561,5,B008XAT0U0,"The four movies here are fun to watch and hold up better than expected for thier age. Burt Reynold stars in Shamus and Physical Evidence. Shamus is the better of the two but both are worth viewing. Burt plays a private eye in the first. It plays well and the trench coat shctick is a hoot. Physical Evidence has Burt as a burnt out cop who is suspected of murder. Theresa Russel does a nice turn as his defense lawyer. Both transfers are very good and the films are fun and entertaining.
Sean Connery is solid in the Anderson Tapes he is an excon out to rob a suite of rich apartments. The gang he puts together and the way they operate is half the fun of the film. This is definitely the diamond in the set and is defenitely worth having for any Connery fan. The cast in the movie is solid all the way and Christopher Walking is a stand out in his first film.
Break Out is Charles Bronson in an enjoyable action comedy it is fun but I never liked Jill Ireland and she plays the female lead as always in a Bronson film which hurts the movie.
All of the transfers are good and the price is right at under $10. No extras but what good movies.",1367280000,5,1140,4.13963963963964
5188562,5,B008XAT0U0,"Finally! Burt Reynolds is in top form as private eye Shamus. I wish Burt made more films like this and White Lightening, where the overall tone of the film is serious, but Burt brings his sense of humour to it.

Shamus is finally released in widescreen, and included is a widescreen version of Physical Evidence as well as the classic Sean Connery film The Anderson Tapes, and the Classic Charles Bronson film Breakout, Bronson is at his best, he is actually funny in this film.",1367107200,7,478,4.623529411764705
5188563,5,B008XAT0U0,"Shamus, Physical evidence, Anderson Tapes, Breakout. All movies are much above average in entertainment satisfaction. I am not a Burt Reynolds fan as he tries to be too cute. However, in Physical Evidence and Shamus he was ok. The other two movies were just flat out well done and entertaining. The 4 set was a bargain. I rate most movies as less than a 4. To watch them more than once for me requires a 4 rating. It may be nip and tuck but I thought none of these was less than a 4. However, with today's fast paced monotony in action films each to his opinion. These 4 movies were not stopped and watched part by part. They were watched with interest to the plot and the drama. All in all a great value.",1360195200,5,705,4.229629629629629
5188564,5,B008XAT0U0,"All four movies are entertaining and are quality prints of the films. The real treasure is The Anderson Tapes with Sean Connery. For only five bucks, this is a four pack worth buying.",1355961600,8,183,4.575757575757576

5188570,2,B008XAT0U0,"Beware the seller who claims ""Like New"". This 2 disc (Hollywood Hits) set's second disc ""Breakout & The Anderson Tapes"" is sooo scratched on the play side that my player rejects it. It Won't play at all. I think the previous owner used the play side of this disc as a coffee cup coaster.
  I gave it 2 stars because it did come on time and disc one ( Shamus /Phys Evidence) is playable. Still-one expects a seller to have inspected their product before posting a ""Like-New"" disclaimer for their product.",1404864000,,503,4.516483516483516
5188571,5,B008XAT0U0,I bought this 4-pack for Breakout.  I saw it in a theater years ago and wanted to add it to my collection.  The other three movies are equally good and well worth watching.,1402099200,,172,4.181818181818182
5188572,3,B008XAT0U0,"The main reason I purchased this set was because of the movie, ""Shamus"".  This movie has been my favorite Burt Reynold's film for years.  Problem was, I could never find it.  Now, I finally have it.  It was worth the wait.  However, the other movies in this set are good, in their own way.  The Anderson Tapes and Breakout are good action flicks.  The only weak one in the bunch is Physical Evidence.  All in all, a great purchase, especially for the price.",1389830400,5,457,4.421686746987952

8531720,4,B008XAT0U0,"I purchased this movie package because of the film ""Shamus"" which had Arthur Haggerty as a villain. He was one of the most interesting and accomplished trainers of dogs for Hollywood stars and other well known people. When I was Treasurer of Dog Writers
Association of America (DWAA) which meets in New York, Arthur was one of the most active trainers and authors of dog training books. In the movie ""Shamus"" several scenes have savage and menacing dogs which were actually well trained by Arthur. It was overall a good movie for Burt Reynolds.",1523059200,,544,4.797872340425532
8531721,5,B008XAT0U0,I ordered Burt Reynolds DVD Shamus!  The movie was awesome!  I highly recommend this feature!  It's a movie that's kind of under the radar but well worth it!  I had a great time super cool movie! If your a Burt Reynolds fan you'll love this one!,1493510400,,245,4.260869565217392

8531723,3,B008XAT0U0,"This two-disc collection is an excellent bargain featuring three fair-to-good caper films and one clunker (Michael Crichton's banal thriller 'Physical Evidence' - 2 stars), but be warned: 1973's 'Shamus' - arguably the best title of the bunch (3 1/2 stars) - is not presented in widescreen as advertised.  It's the same fullscreen print put out by Sony/Columbia in 2002 (now out-of-print).  'Breakout' and 'The Anderson Tapes' (3ish stars each) are, like their previous studio releases, anamorphic widescreen.  Content merits a cumulative 3-minus stars; package/price 4 stars.",1487462400,3,576,5.674418604651163
