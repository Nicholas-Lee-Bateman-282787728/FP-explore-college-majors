6964895,5,B00S8SJHR8,"This is an incredible story and it's true! I'm certain this documentary will be mentioned as one of the best LGBT films this decade! Very glad this film got put together.

I won't go into a deep description about this documentary. I will just tell you that it needs to be watched by everyone. I felt very good viewing this. Brings a strong feeling of PRIDE :)

A good trailer for this is available as option with the film ""BOYS"", also from Wolfe pictures.",1423612800,10,455,4.404761904761905
6964896,5,B00S8SJHR8,"This is a mix of documentary interviews and recreation of the lives of two gay men growing up in 1950's Switzerland and the magazine that brought them together. Ernst is a mild mannered teacher and he hears of an organisation that is a support structure for people like him - `confirmed bachelors'. This is Der Kreis or The Circle - it was a publication made in Zurich and had readers worldwide. Ernst meets an enigmatic drag queen in Robi Rapp and falls for him completely.

This is told with actors recreating the pivotal scenes and then with modern day interviews with Ernst and Robi. All of the actors are superb but Sven Schelker playing Robi is just wonderful. It would be easy to glamorise this by saying it is a story of sex, intrigue and murder and to a large extent that would be true. However, at its core it is a story of love, companionship and living a lie in a world fearful of what it has never tried to understand. Watch the run off credits too for some great photographs - this is a must for anyone interested in gay history. In German and a run time of 102 minutes - this is a simply brilliant film.",1422662400,17,1118,4.349282296650718
6964897,5,B00S8SJHR8,"Beautiful, affirming and heartbreaking.  It has that made-for-TV perfect look that's somewhat impersonal, but it's professional quality all the way.",1453766400,,148,6.4

6964901,5,B00S8SJHR8,"Based on the real life situation in Switzerland in the middle of the 20th century. The Circle is a group of men who preferred men, holding an annual ball and publishing a regular newsletter / magazine which was distributed by post to the membership list. It was also taken across the border into Germany.  The couple, still living, offered their insights to then and now and makes the story more real.  Well worth buying and watching.

6964910,4,B00S8SJHR8,This is an interesting documentary film. A gay pair of gospel-singers. I hope they have a successful career. They are an attractive and engaging couple and certainly help make the movie engaging for people from every walk of life.,1436400000,,230,4.923076923076923
6964911,4,B00S8SJHR8,"This was a wonderful true story of love and loyalty set in Zurich, Switzerland during the 1950s. It tells the story of Ernst and Robi, and how their love for one another blossomed during a tumultuous time in Switzerland, all while police were cracking down on gay establishments and gay men were being murdered by crazy hustlers. Through it all, Ernst and Robi's love remained strong.

My only complaint is that the director kept interrupting the film to cut to snippets of an interview with the real-life Ernst and Robi in their 80s. It would have been just fine to see them once at the beginning of the film, and later at the end. But every time the plot took a turn, they would have the real-life Ernst and Robi commenting on it. This was a real shame because the chemistry between the actors who played Ernst and Robi was off the charts. I don't know if they are gay in real life, but this was some of the best acting I've ever seen.

The attention to detail was up there with any of the best BBC productions. The cinematography was top-notch. Sometimes gay-themed films suffer from lack of restraint, but that wasn't the case here, and as a result, the emotion leaped off the screen. When the actors playing Ernst and Robi hugged and kissed I could feel their passion. Honestly, it's hard for me to believe some of that was acting. Absolutely unbelievable.",1435536000,3,1361,4.551020408163265
6964912,3,B00S8SJHR8,"It's a good story and the fictional parts of the movie are awesome! I felt that  they shouldn't have mixed in the documentary storytelling every 3-5 minutes or so, that interrupted the flow. I wish they put all that documentary stuff in the bonus features or somewhere at the end....it didn't flow well for me. I almost gave up on the movie all together because the whooooole way it's been interrupted like that with real people telling about the past.....Other than that the actors and story is great.",1434585600,2,502,4.704545454545454

There are so many gay films that are difficult to recommend, but I do recommend this one. A testament that not only is love worth fighting for, but the right to love is also worth fighting for.",1429315200,4,365,4.71875

6964919,4,B00S8SJHR8,The Circle is the name of one of the first gay publications.  The film is a Docudrama that chronicles the lives of those who published The Circle in the 1940's and 1950's in Zurich.  For me the best part of this story was seeing the real people describing the story as actors dramatized the events.  It is an engaging and thoughtful movie that is worth your time.,1428796800,3,363,4.388059701492537
6964920,5,B00S8SJHR8,Excellent movie that is also a documentary.,1428278400,,43,5.285714285714286
6964921,5,B00S8SJHR8,"This is a fantastic film and was especially interesting to me because I spend allot of time in Zurich. I want to meet these two men, what a great story both sad and joyful. They endured so much but triumphed in the end. Bravo!",1428192000,,226,4.159090909090909
6964922,3,B00S8SJHR8,"The Circle seems like an unusually well-made home movie, like a 60th anniversary present from an extraordinarily rich and generous friend. It tells the personal story of an old gay Swiss couple through interviews with them and amazingly effective reenactments of their experiences in the mid-1950s in Zurich. They aren't particularly interesting people, but the movie is so well made that it's entertaining anyway.

As a documentary of Switzerland's uniquely civilized history of homophobia it's a curiosity at best, like an inside look at the interpersonal relationships between employees at a flower shop. If the worst that ever happened was a threat of forced outing, then Swiss gays have a lot to be grateful for and always did.",1428192000,,732,5.203389830508475
6964923,5,B00S8SJHR8,"A very unique way of telling the stories and history of LGBT people in Switzerland. The filmmaker managed to find the perfect actors for the re-telling of the real life experiences, assembled in this well told drama-doc, unlike the often 'trashy' TV-Drama-Docs of the past. It is great to also have the original 'characters' tell their stories themselves as well. This drama-doc is both educational and also very entertaining.",1428105600,9,426,5.188405797101449
6964924,5,B00S8SJHR8,This is a well done reflection on what it took for us to get closer to marriage equality...even in a country that was ostensibly tolerant.  Well done mixture of documentary comment and dramatization.,1428019200,11,199,5.03030303030303

8697725,5,B00S8SJHR8,"A remarkable film, even more so because it is based on the true story of the real pioneers of human rights for gay men.  The film opens in 1950's Zurich Switzerland and follows the lives of young and older gay men on their quest to live their lives without oppression.  The film title (""Der Kreis"") refers to the underground magazine of which the men produce and distribute via the mail.  The film is part documentary and part history lesson combined with the incredible love story of the two main characters, Ernst, a school teacher and his transvestite lover, Robi. While on the surface, that sounds rather uncommon for the period, it's entirely believable as you see their story unfold.  There is so much packed into the film, it's truly a must-see classic, and a testament to the men of this time period who fought, sometimes with their lives, as the film explains.  Risking death, detainment or worse, most of us living in the modern world cannot even comprehend their courage.

Overall, you'll find a genuine love story, as the film is intertwined with memories shared by the real Ernst and Robi, adding a personal dimension that puts you as one with the film characters.  Heavy and deep in some scenes, the film is often lively, fun and even at times, a little sexy.

These gems are all too rare, so make time for this emotional and powerful film.  The film is in Swiss with English Subtitles.  #Zurich #TheCircle #1950s #Remarkable #Film #Emotional #Gay  #TrueStory #History #SubTitles",1485561600,,1493,4.79296875
8697726,5,B00S8SJHR8,"An interesting history of the life of European homosexuals before they became known as gays, which has parallels in the American struggle, which still has a long way to go before it catches up with the rest of the 'civilized' world.",1477008000,,232,4.682926829268292

8697730,5,B00S8SJHR8,"Although homosexual activity was not illegal in post-war Zurich, gay men still suffered from the social stigma, police persecution and the poisonous press of the time, as this superb Swiss (German-language) drama clearly illustrates.
Seamlessly combining part re-enactment and part documentary, this film is both a touching love story and important chronicle of gay history.
A love story between performer/hairdresser Robi Rapp and school teacher Ernst Ostertag - who both appear regularly throughout the film - and their involvement with ""Der Kreis"", a ground breaking gay organization, which for 34 years between 1932 and 1967, arranged social gatherings and produced an influential magazine for its members.
A richly entertaining and thoughtful film capturing the good and sadly, far too many bad times (police raids, hate crimes, fear of careers being ruined), aided enormously by eye-witness accounts by many of the actual participants, all done in succinct and vital interviews.
Both Sven Schelker as the colourful, poignant Robi, and Matthias Hungerbuhler as the more earnest Ernst are nothing short of perfection in their portrayals.  In fact, the whole cast is splendid, highlighted by Marianne Sagebrecht as Robi's supportive mother.
Full marks to director Stephan Haupt and his talented crew  for adapting this piece of gay history so brilliantly to the screen.
P.S.  Many fabulous scenes in this film.  One standout to me was the frosty reception the dapper Robi (and his flowers) get when Ernst introduces him to his stern parents.",1455494400,6,1544,5.420833333333333
8697731,5,B00S8SJHR8,"absolutely theme, carried out magnificantly by the artits. absolutetly the trasformation in different scripts by the director could not be better.
I know many that will say is a gay movie, yet the essence is not. The gay subject is merely secondary.
Excellent movie!",1454544000,,266,5.068181818181818
