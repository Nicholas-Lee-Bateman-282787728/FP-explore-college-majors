4660244,5,B005DJ62L4,"I loved this documentary, with as some others have said is basically the same style as the Classic Albums series. It's an hour long, but the bonus features run a total of forty or so minutes - which really adds value to the release. I immediately went to check out the newly rediscovered song recorded during the album sessions: ""She Smells So Nice."" Don't expect much if you haven't heard it yet, but it was still a fun piece of history to hear. It's basically a blues jam with what sounds like improvised lyrics (with unfortunate distortion marring the vocal track).

But the main documentary goes through the album, song by song (minus ""L'America"" for some weird reason), with the surviving Doors offering lots of interesting anecdotes. They also - separately - play their individual parts for some of the songs, which is cool. Producer Bruce Botnick isolates separate tracks from the master tapes - allowing the viewer to hear portions of some songs with just one instrument, unaccompanied. I actually wish there was more of that.  Fans will recognize most of the old vintage footage of the band performing, and I wasn't wild about the few scenes where they attempted to sort of sync L.A. Woman songs with older performance footage.

Over all, if you love the Doors and especially the L.A. Woman album, you should check out this documentary. The music sounds awesome on Blu-ray in 5.1 surround sound too.",1327795200,14,1408,4.809917355371901
4660245,5,B005DJ62L4,"Forty years ago in 1971, I bought L.A.Woman, and as all Doors fans back then, was completely blown away by their yet- another amazing sound. As like the Classic Albums dvd THE DOORS from 2008, this dvd also takes us into the making of the Doors L.A. Woman, with amazing stories and footage. The surviving Doors John Densmore, Ray Manzarek and Robbie Krieger tell us the stories behind 9 of their 10 songs- The Changeling, Been Down So Long, Crawling King Snake, Love Her Madly, L.A. Woman,  The WASP (Texas Radio And The Big Beat), Riders On The Storm, Cars Hiss By My Window and Hyacinth House. The only song not covered is L'America.

Jim Morrison was and would never be the same after the Miami arrest, and his lyrics on this album especially attest to that fact. When The Doors went to begin recording this album at the Sunset Sound Studios in LA, Paul Rothchild didn't like one sound they were playing and walked out saying he would not record any of it. Paul Rothchild recorded all The Doors albums, so this really came as a shock to all of them. Bruce Botnick ignored Rothchild's walk out and took The Doors to their rehearsal studio and asked if they had anything else to record. As always, Jim and Robbie always had plenty of material for songs.

Unlike being in the Elektra Studio at Sunset Sound,  where it took dozens of takes ending up in weeks or months to get the songs just right for one album, The Doors finished this album in their rehearsal studio on Santa Monica Blvd. in 4 days! All the songs were finished after one or two takes, making this a true garage band album.  Bruce Botnick brought in some extra talent with Jerry Scheff on bass guitar and Marc Benno on rhythm guitar. All 4 Doors were excited, especially Jim, to be working with Jerry Scheff, who was bass guitarist for Elvis Presley's TCB band. I'm sure the heavy blues sounds on L.A. Woman came from the addition of these two highly talented guitarists.

Riders On the Storm came from the old cowboy classic Ghost Riders In The Sky, of which I still love the Johnny Cash and other old cowboy versions. The Doors and Botnick dissect the songs for us and let us hear Jim sing with the different rhythms, which is really fantastic. Crawling King Snake, John Lee Hooker's huge hit, really brings out the blues in The Doors. The big bonus on this dvd, is the song, She Smells So Nice- another blues song that I have never heard before- and Jim can sing with the best of the bluesmen on this recording. Robbie tells of writing Love Her Madly based on watching his girlfriend walking out after a fight. The Changeling is truly Jim Morrison's farewell to his life, family and friends here in America, and so sadly to The Doors.

There is plenty of seen-before footage and photos of The Doors- about 70%, but another 30% I have never seen before, and I have everything on The Doors since 1967! The talks about the music and stories I have never heard before, from The Doors, Botnick, Rothchild, Jac Holzman, Bill Siddons and other friends and associates are very interesting. Another great bonus feature is The Doors Guide to L.A.- seeing the places The Doors were at, back in 1971 and now, really added to the dvd. For a Doors fan, this inside look into the making of The Doors last album with Jim Morrison is well worth buying. On this blu-ray's 103 minutes running time, I viewed a good 30% of never been seen before photos and footage, heard stories about 9 of the 10 songs that I have never heard before, got a view of The Doors LA hangouts from both 1971 and how they look now, and got to hear for the first time The Doors song She Smells So Nice- a fabulous blues song that goes well with Crawling King Snake.

This dvd is bittersweet because it would be Jim's last album with the Doors, as after the 4 days of recording, he would join Pam in Paris, never to return, but it also brings a lot of happiness in listening to these great stories from the surviving Doors and the fact that this album was finished in 4 days in a garage type studio is testament to the sheer genius that was and always will be The Doors. I hope the surviving Doors keep making dvd's taking us into the creation of their other albums, as I can never get enough of their pure magic, that even after 40 years is still there!",1327708800,53,4279,4.4213197969543145
4660246,5,B005DJ62L4,Yeah.  What a great item.  I have waited a long time to get this.  I will watch it again and again.,1327708800,,99,3.619047619047619
4660247,4,B005DJ62L4,"Takes the format of the Classic Albums series; pretty much dissecting the album song by song with interviews, sound bits, video and commentary.

Sadly, almost all of the older video performance bits interspersed throughout are re-treads of what we have seen before: The Changeling video, live Hollywood Bowl footage, etc. That is how it goes, I guess, w/most 60s bands. I've seen all of  this stuff before, but there was enough new video commentary (Bruce Botnick, Bill Siddons,  Jac Holzman, David Fricke, Ben Fong-Torres) recorded to keep me interested.

The real gems here are the new bits recorded by the band: Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore dissect parts they play, note for note, beat by beat, song by song and it's a real treat to watch.

The bonus material is made up of unedited interviews/demonstrations with the band members as well as the unreleased track She Smells So Nice/Rock Me. The track plays accompanied with a really cool photo montage/reel which featured some pics that I wasn't so sure I'd seen before.",1327622400,3,1025,4.970760233918129
4660248,5,B005DJ62L4,"It amazes me the quality of live performances released recently by the Doors from their archives. I ordered my copies of L.A. Woman both on CD and DVD. Milking for what's it worth? Maybe. I will take anything that comes my way. For serious Doors fans of the Doors Google ""lightmyfirecovers"" and discover how many versions of Light My Fire were covered by other artists. The Doors have impacted the music industry in such a big way that they are even more relevant today.",1327190400,8,470,4.607142857142857
4660249,4,B005DJ62L4,"For the second year in a row The Doors have released a documentary on film about the band. Last year it was ""When You're Strange"" with footage taken mostly from Jim Morrison's film ""HWY."" This year to kick off the self described ""The Year of The Doors"" is the film ""The Doors Mr. Mojo Risin': The Making of L.A. Woman.""

""The Doors Mr. Mojo Risin': The Making of L.A. Woman"" tells the story of the making of The Doors seminal album, ""L.A. Woman"". Relying on mostly footage taken from The Doors documentary, ""Feast of Friends"", (that was shot in the 60's and has been used for most other video projects since then) and new interviews with the surviving members of The Doors, including Bruce Botnick, and Paul Rothchild explaining why he decided not to produce L.A. Woman (every previous Doors album was produced by Rothchild) and exactly which song he considered ""cocktail music"". Other interviews include Morrison's film school friend, Frank Lisciandro, early Doors advocate DJ, Jim Ladd and music journalists, Ben Fong-Torres and David Fricke.

""Mr. Mojo Risin' is a good mixture of discussions of the songs and putting ""L.A. Woman"" in the cultural context of the times when it was recorded and released without getting bogged down in the technicalities of either.

All the songs on ""L.A. Woman"" are discussed in the film with the exception of ""L'America"", but interesting facts and stories surrounding the genesis and recording are included, with demonstrations by The Doors on their instrumental contributions. Ray Manzarek tells of how Jerry Scheff, who played bass for Elvis Presley, got involved in the recording and of the contortions he had to got through to play the bass lines Manzarek showed him.

The DVD also features more than the usual amount of bonus features usually found on The Doors DVD's. There's the raw footage of John Densmore's and Ray Manzarek's interviews, a tour of The Doors L.A., set to the song ""L.A. Woman"" and a video of ""She Smells so Nice/Rock Me"" that includes a lot of pictures of the early Doors.

4660250,5,B005DJ62L4,"well it just took 40 years but here it is! So many say the Door's first album was their best, but no, L.A. Woman is their best work! New producer Bruce Botnick came in and gave the band a breath of fresh air, re-engergized them and thus they came out with this gem! Get the DVD and the new 40th Ann edition of the CD!
This DVD is the story of the making of the Doors' last album with Jim Morrison (although the band went on to record two more studio albums without Jim). Released in 1971, 2011 is albums 40th anniversary. This DVD shows the in detail of how the album came about, its recording and what was happening to the band at the time. The story is told through new interviews with the three surviving Doors: Ray Manzarek, Robbie Krieger and John Densmore. The DVD has classic footage of the Doors performing both live and in the studio, many of which you can see on youtube, but here it is and has the best pic quality.",1324166400,17,926,4.207865168539326

You get the story behind all the songs, see some live footage, see all members talking about the songs and Morrison, hear some isolated tracks from the master multi-track tapes, and then see the guys playing their instrumental parts.... AWESOME.

Well filmed, well edited, good sound quality. The Doors can still play and I find them very enjoyable to listen to; it's often boring to hear bands talking about their music, but not with the Doors.

If you care anything about a popular culture keystone such as The Doors,you must watch and listen to
this DVD about how this band ended things,early in 1970. I had long been haunted by LA Woman,but never
knew why.
Now,I know. I was haunted by its greatness,I just couldn't understand it as a younger man.
I was in Paris when Jim died and didn't know til I returned home. Swore I saw him,on July 14,so it just
adds to the mystery.
Watching this DVD helped me so much to get a feel for how things went for everyone,that last album.
It was such a pleasure,hearing from the folks that were there.
Its a compelling story about the end of a wonderful and challenging band that made a permanent impact on
modern music.
The added bonus is that the music still sounds fantastic. Buy both. Enjoy.",1436659200,3,837,4.477124183006536
4660267,5,B005DJ62L4,"I am extremely happy with this DVD.  What I liked the most was the views of Ray, Robby, and John giving insight, and first hand knowledge of the experiences all four of them shared.  It wasn't a documentary by a director who wasn't there at the time.  I know these people do their research, however, it's not the same when somebody tells a story and leaves out details that are more important to draw attention and dramatize the troubled times more so then elaborate on the good things that happened while the band was together from beginning to end.  All three band mates, alive at the time of making this documentary were there and the accounts of how the four worked so well together is refreshing instead of depressing.  Very well put together and thought out.",1430524800,2,764,4.588235294117647

The extroverted Ray is particularly good value - his passion for the music they made is unabated after all these years and he is an enthusiastic and engaging speaker.

4660320,3,B005DJ62L4,"The Doors - Mr. Mojo Risin': The Story Of L.A. Woman.
This DVD is not a concert album. It is a collection of music videos, with narrations by Doors band members and people in the music industry. The bonus footage contains interviews about the making of the L.A. Woman album, and it does drag on a bit. You may need to take a few coffee breaks, to help you get through it all the way to the end. This album is something to watch once, and then file it away as a collector's item, to round out a complete collection of Doors material.

In 1965, the band got together, and released their first album, ""The Doors"" on 4 January, 1967. Unfortunately, the lead singer, Jim Morrison, while taking a vacation break away from the band and the stresses of recording and performing, died in 1971, at the relatively young age of 27 (8 Dec 1943 - 3 Jul 1971), in a Paris bathtub, probably from a combination of alcohol poisoning due to a lifetime of heavy drinking, and a night of snorting heroin with his heroin addicted girlfriend. Thus ended Jim's brief four year recording career. A brief flash of brilliance, and then he was gone, -burned out at an early age. Ah, Jim, we hardly knew ya. Jim recorded a total of six albums with The Doors. The remaining band members recorded two more albums, ""Other Voices"", on 25 Oct 1971, and ""Full Circle"", on 15 Aug 1972. Three and a half stars for this DVD.",1384905600,,1386,4.392996108949417
4660331,2,B005DJ62L4,"You know the artist under discussion is untalented when more effort and time is expended on personal and political problems than on the art itself.  The Doors, as Marilyn before them, are more famous for their antics, for their lead singer's misguided belief that he had something of importance to say than for their music, which is at best amatuerish and oddly unmusical.  They are remembered, when they are remembered at all, for being a band that was always in the midst of ""becoming"" but never quite getting there.  ""If only Jim had lived they might have done something worthwhile"" is the mantra of their fans.  They are at best a curiosity, which is fitting as most curiosities are found in antique shops - and their style of music is nothing if not antique.  Monroe too is best known for her depressions and death, not, God knows, for her acting skills.
  You have one friend of the group rhapsodising over the line ""Don't you love her as she's walking out the door"" as though it held a profound message worthy of Wordsworth or Eliot.
  People such as Morrison are not tragic figures.  There is nothing tragic about someone who is given everything for having a bare modicum of talent and blows it all on self-indulgent behavior.  If anyone believes the Doors were a great blues band that person has not been exposed to the blues.  Jim was not a great singer, he was barely mediocre.
  Ray Manzarak, at the time of this documentary, the very model of a model major hippie who never grew up, claims the band was ahead of its time and that it had the police forces, the FBI, the media, and poliiticians scared.  Ah the delusions of grandeur.  Yes Ray when you need your lead singer to show his privates on stage in order to get some press I guess you're on the top of the heap.  But what a heap!!!  Then someone opines that because he was arested poor Jim ""died"".  The hypocrisy is palpable.  What he though twas the same as many celebrities feel, they can get away with behavior others cannot.  ""But what is wrong with his insulting his audience?  Those who paid good money NOT to see a drunken buffoon fall all over himself, thus demonstrating nothing so much as contempt for those silly enough to feel he is some type of rock messiah"".
  At one point one of the band, who knows who, claims that out there is some 17 or 18 year old discovering the band for the first time, I can only wonder what LaLa land this band is living in.  Unless of course he meant there is ONLY one out there who, scavanging the bargain bin or looking to score a major coup by buying a CD at 5.00, comes across a Doors CD and, after listening, puts on a BB King or Albert King CD to wash it down.",1382140800,,2677,4.392276422764228

4660339,4,B005DJ62L4,"This long awaited documentary about the Doors is focused on the L.A. Woman, album... the very last album by the Doors with lead singer Jim Morrison.

As a long time Doors fan, who's seen myriad documentaries and read a ridiculous amount of biographies, I was at first a little nonplussed that this was indeed a standard-format documentary, and not at all the ""mind-blowing story of the Doors by the Doors"", as had been touted for quite some time before it's release. This is likely said in the other reviews, and if so I vehemently agree.

That out of the way, I did actually enjoy the documentary. There was not a slew of 'new' anything for hardcore fans. Like most commercially branded Doors items, this is an 'introductory level' documentary... obviously and primarily geared for new fans. Many of the same/previously seen footage items, with the exception of some live film of the L.A. Woman recordings done in the studio (though for us diehards, we already saw this entire cut come out on the internet nearly a year ago).

Other gripes I have are how there is constantly live concert footage used depicting Morrison seeming to sing tracks from LA Woman, when in fact it's not only the wrong time-frame for him to be singing it, you can clearly see he's singing some other song with the L.A. Woman track dubbed over it.

The documentary bleeds on pretty effortlessly, moving over the L.A. Woman sessions, while filling in some back-story for the band by going through the tracks of the album one by one. Strangely, some editing must have been had at the commercial level, as L'America was entirely missing. I find this odd, because of all of these songs this one had one of the most interesting back stories.

Also not very much in the way of revelatory new information, much less anything new to ponder in the mythos of Morrison or the group itself. It feels less exposed than it does commercially contrived. This is less an insult than it is simply a description of the overall feel.

Nit-picking aside, the things I did like about the documentary were primarily the subtleties, such as the Doors actually playing their instrument parts of the music, alone. Or Bruce Botnick, their engineer, playing at the mixing board to example isolated vocal and instrument audio. Sadly these parts were underwhelmed by not nearly enough screen-time, with far more focus on the rags to riches story of the Doors and commentary from some few other voices of the times.

Other subtleties would include how it was lovely to see Michael McClure speak of Morrison and his words, and some fine graphical segues depicting Song titles on Billboard signage in homage to the Doors being the first band ever to do such a thing with an album.

What could have made this a true smash would have been if the Doors had decided to give us with this as they did with their music: Something different. Something challenging. Something we can take away with us apart from mythos and planned atmosphere. In summation, something New.

All in all however, while I did enjoy the documentary, it was somewhat lackluster for me as a diehard fan. The pacing was good, the technical editing was alright, and the visual/audio quality was stunning. For me, it's got a great home in my Doors media collection along with several others who (with a few slight variations) could likely share the same DVD cover.",1361923200,2,3371,4.748717948717949
4660340,5,B005DJ62L4,"More than history of THE DOORS final studio album.  Filled with insight into the inner workings of The Doors as a truly collaborative band.  Should go without saying, the music is great; and prominates this musical documentary.  Equal measures of archival and current, reflective footage; we get to see how the music was composed, refined, and came to life inside, what had been, The Doors practice studio. Throughout the making of LA WOMAN, they all knew Jim Morrison had made the fateful decision to flee to Paris.  Viewing this film has elevated, for me, the tremendous value of the group's final collaboration.

The documentary has been available on the SMITHSONIAN TV NETWORK for a few months.  I was enlightened and moved.  My 35 year old nephew is a musician and student of the music and cultural movement as well as the social/political history of the 1960's.  Purchased DVD for him for view of creative process, as well as LA WOMAN CD.

One thought that lingers:  It appears THE DOORS did their best work as a single unit, embracing each other's contribution.  At the same time, the ones that changed it all, THE BEATLES turned out their best and most innovatve work (ABBEY ROAD, SGT. PEPPER, WHITE ALBUM?) while they were barely speaking, sick of each other, and tired with being THE BEATLES.",1357689600,,1302,4.81981981981982

I actually got a taste of it on DirecTv History Channel tonight and the clarity combined with the surround mix was great.  I have several hundred Concert DVDs, Blu Rays, CDs and HD recordings and this recording is right up there in the top 5 for quality.  I played and watched it on a McIntosh audio system in my home theater and it was stunning.  I started played this early in the morning when the family was in bed and I had to watch/listen to the whole thing until 2:00AM because it was that good.  Kudos to Doug Sax and Bruce Botnick for compiling an acoustical rock and roll gem along with great visuals and interspection on a legendary American rock band all on one High Definition Blu Ray disk.

4660354,2,B005DJ62L4,"I watched the LA Woman documentary last night. I bought a copy off Amazon.com for $8 shipped.

It was not very good.  A lot of it was a rehash of the Doors career which has been told many times.  Virtually all the footage used has all been seen before, and the quality of a lot of the footage wasn't that good compared to other documentaries it has appeared in.  Some footage was even shown more than once which seems odd given how much footage exists of this band.

There were a few bright spots.  There were interviews with people you rarely hear from about The Doors:  Jac Holtzman, the owner of Elektra Records;  Bill Siddons, their original  manager; Bruce Botnick (recording engineer); Michael McClure, a poet who was friends with Morrison;  Jim Ladd, LA DJ and huge Doors fan;  Frank Lisciandro (film school friend and the guy who filmed many of their shows).  I don't think I had ever seen an filmed interview with any of those guys except Jim Ladd, so this was truly the highlight of the program. It's also amazing to see how old these guys are now.

They also had what appeared to be recent interviews with the band.  It was mostly the same stories they have been telling for 40 years,  except they did play their instruments a little bit and explained some of the music.  The info about the two session musicians they used was kind of cool but it's not new information. Manzarek, guilty as anyone for the constant mining of old Doors material for money making, can be really annoying to listen to for a variety of reasons.  He has a very annoying trait of interjecting Morrison lyrics into his comments, almost on cue.

They included a ""lost"" song that is on the 40th anniversary CD.  It seemed okay as garage blues but it was not anywhere near as good as the songs on the original record. That's why it was never released. The DVD also has a video of Doors related locations in Los Angeles, which was by no means complete.

All in all, this is really for hardcore Doors fans who can never get enough of their favorite band.  For everyone else, get a copy of  Tom DeCillo's recent documentary about The Doors narrated by Johnny Depp....it is vastly superior.",1336608000,5,2169,4.507692307692308

4660357,2,B005DJ62L4,"What a directionless hodgepodge mess.

Is this yet another Doors bio project OR a doc about recording the LA Woman album that gives us a solid understanding of the making of this LP?

The answer is neither, while making a faint attempt at doing both.

This DVD tries to be all things and does it POORLY... I can point to other ""The Making Of..."" DVD's in this series where they got it right - Some shining examples: The Who ""Who's Next"", Steely Dan ""Aja"", The Sex Pistols ""Never Mind The Bollocks"", Lou Reed ""Transformer"" etc. AND... One of the best examples in this DVD series is (the one covering) the Doors 1st release. This DVD is NOWHERE near as good as that. There's so much ""talking head"" type interview material here rehashing stuff that anyone mildly interested in the Doors already knows. The content, direction, editing and structure of this doc is just sloppy. There seems to more interview footage here of an unknown ""friend of Jim Morrison"" theorizing about Jim's motives, than there is of Bruce Botnick (who recorded & co-produced the LP) explaining the tracks. We learn little about many of songs and actual recording process here - Isn't that supposed to be the whole point? Obviously, some background story on the band & how they got to this stage of their career is well warranted, but if you're looking for something systematic & informative about the ACTUAL recording of LA Woman, best look elsewhere. So many essential things here are just simply skirted over or not even mentioned. For example, where's Jerry Scheff and Marc Benno? (who preformed bass & guitar respectively on the record). They're both alive and probably would've been more than willing to be interviewed (and show us a little of what they played). Other obvious key content for a doc like this is just missing. The things that do work and are actually informative seem like an afterthought for the producers of this DVD. Maybe they should've spent less time on low rent photo montages & the digitally simulated fake billboards announcing the songs and got down to business instead!

As one Amazon reviewer noted ""the bonus material should be the feature"" - I tend to agree (not that there isn't also problems with the bonus stuff too btw). Short version: A disappointing attempt at documenting the making of a great record. LA Women deserves better.",1329177600,5,2340,4.799007444168734
4660358,5,B005DJ62L4,"This is exactly what it purports to be; a recollection of the making of ""L.A. Woman"" primarily told by those who were there. If you love the record, as I do, you'll be delighted. The band is heavily featured, along with co-producer Bruce Botnick. I am a huge Doors fan and an ardent collector of Doors books, videos and music. This DVD is one I will return to many times and will show for friends, who also enjoy The Doors.

4660359,3,B005DJ62L4,"The best part of this DVD is the 40 minutes of ""bonus"" material where they actually talk about the process of making the music.

4660360,5,B005DJ62L4,"Mr. Mojo Risin': The Story of L.A. Woman is a wonderful documentary of the making of what turned out to be The Doors' swan song: the album, L.A. Woman. The back story to this iconic, historic album was made with the full cooperation, involvement and approval of The Doors.

Mr. Mojo Risin' is told by way of brand new interviews with Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger and John Densmore.  There are also interviews with the band's original manger, Bill Siddons, and Elektra Records founder, Jac Holzman and the album's engineer/producer, Bruce Botnick and a ton of other people tied to the band or the record at that time.

For geeks like me who love to hear how a song comes together, you'll hear the guys share how the hits that the album generated came about.  It's always amazing how landmark sounds came about as almost an afterthought or fluke.  Live and studio performances and a boat load of great, rare archival photos make this DVD a real treat for Doors fans.

I'm a sucker for discoveries of long, lost stuff and this DVD sucks me right in with the previously unreleased blues tune, She Smells So Nice.  The vocal track is a little on the scratchy side but that's what adds to its appeal, as far as I'm concerned.  Morrison sounds like he's having a blast with the song.  It would've been great if Jim and the boys had also cut an entire blues album before his untimely death.

The documentary also reminded me of something that I had forgotten and that was that Elvis Presley's bass player, Jerry Scheff, did the bass work on this album.  I'm sure Mr. Scheff will shed some light about this project from his perspective when his autobiography comes out in March.  Stay tuned.

Regarding Morrison's passing, the guys do discuss the subject in a frank way that still seems to reveal the feeling that they still can't believe he's gone. Conspiracy theorists who feel that Morrison didn't really die in 1971 will not see any hits of a smoking gun in this movie that will support their theory.  Nor is there any discussion about the theory that the Lizard King murdered for whatever reason.  I would've been surprised and disappointed if the subjects were discussed.

I got the sense from watching this documentary that the guys still have a love for Morrison as well as for each other that only a tight band of brothers can have.  It's great hearing these guys share their stories and insights into this landmark album as well as the life inside - and dynamic of - the mind.

The production quality of Mr. Mojo Risin' is excellent.  The editing and flow is crisp and clean.  The selection of material is bang-on.  Like all great movies and documentaries, it leaves you wanting more.  Sadly, after this DVD (with the exception of She Smells So Nice) , it's highly unlikely that there is any more.

Avid Doors fans as well as rock music historians will want to have this DVD in their personal collection and will watch many, many times.

Mr. Mojo Risin': The Story of L.A. Woman is available in standard DVD and Blu-Ray formats.

The billboards for each song were a good idea, but poorly executed design wise. Trying to make Cars Hiss by My Window about Paris was a stretch since it was written about Venice Beach, but they had to wrap it up somehow I guess.
