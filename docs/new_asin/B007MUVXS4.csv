It's bigger than that.  It is about his succeeding as a human being & family member.  Truly enjoyed this & hope Amazon offers it for sale soon, as a Region One movie because I want it to lend out to people I care about.  When you want to share a movie, then it is a five star rating!!!",1348963200,2,440,3.78021978021978
