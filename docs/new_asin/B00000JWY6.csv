7913600,2,B00000JWY6,"A kind hearted but poor clerk with a mean boss and lazy wife
meets a friendly spirit which helps him become a new man.
Unlike films like many of the films with a supernatural element
this one cuts back on the action and scares in favour of humour.
In style I would describe it as an asian version of South Park as there is running gag involving a magic penis which makes the film worth seeing.  The poor production values in the set design, costumes and special effect let stop me from giving this
 fun film more than 2 stars.",1011484800,12,526,4.25
