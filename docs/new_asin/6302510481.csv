8270685,2,6302510481,"I enjoyed the film. Unfortunately, it's on a pretty crappy format. Letterboxed film, with hardcoded subtitles.",1509494400,,110,5.9375
8270686,5,6302510481,"GREAT MOVIE. I wish the movie was available as a ""legitimate"" retail DVD instead of a DVD rip from a digital file. The description clearly states that the DVD is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media, so I wasn't expecting much. For some reason though, my ""not expecting much"" must have been too high a standard. Maybe $6.99 would have been a more realistic price point.

Having griped about the packaging I have to say that this movie is excellent!  Other reviewers have given nice capsule summaries of the movie, so I'll skip that.  Instead I want to mention another aspect of this film (which is something I've noticed in many of the foreign films that I've watched recently)  -- the performances of the cast seem to be much more realistic then most american films. The child actors are close to their character ages and the acting/performances are really believable. In Drommen, Janus Rathke and Sarah Werner give outstanding performances!",1488326400,,957,4.925465838509317
8270687,5,6302510481,"Set in Denmark in 1969 we are introduced to a young boy, Frits, who has been inspired by the words of Martin Luther-King. His father has had some sort of breakdown and he lives on a farm with his mother who also doubles as the school nurse.

The Headmaster is one of the old school (quite literally) and believes that if you spare the rod you spoil the child. Or more simply he is just a control freak bully. Frits gets more than his fair share of the rod and decides that all injustice must be stood up to. We also have the political machinations of a small town community, other children being bullies and a new uber cool music teacher - with long hair! The scene is soon set for a show down, but the journey to that will not be easy for all those involved.

This is based on facts and is a great time capsule for the era. I remember bullying teachers and corporeal punishment and those memories always stay with you. That Frits took inspiration from a civil rights leader - who spoke English - is a testament to Martin Luther- King's marvellous appeal. The film is just excellent with great performances from everyone and this includes a very young cast indeed. It is emotional and it will make you think. I absolutely enjoyed watching this it is in Danish with a smattering of English - absolutely recommended",1407110400,2,1313,4.421487603305785
8270688,5,6302510481,I first saw this Dutch film on SBS TV in Australia and enjoyed it so i bought it from Amazon. It is a great story with a twist at the end that is unexpected. Set during the Occupation of Holland in WW2 by the Germans obviously. This story is told through the eyes of a teenager who witnessed and was courageous in how far he went to save a Allied soldier. The shock at the end was unexpected and you can never know just who the callaborators are. For me it was a both a surprise and betrayal. There is much courage and i believe it may have been based on a true story. I always wonder if after the war the Allied soldier ever went back to thank that family. Having said that we do not know if any of them survived WW2. A great story well worth watching if you enjoy true stories about WW2.,1356220800,,789,4.031847133757962
8270689,2,6302510481,This documentary is a good review about the history of the song 'We Shall Overcome'. Disturbing however is the fact that not one of the songs is played in full length. There are better ways tot pay tribute to this hymn,1348963200,,218,4.341463414634147
8270690,5,6302510481,"We saw this film at the Sprockets Children's Film Festival in Toronto.  It was a field trip with our grade 7 students.  The children and adults were so engrossed with this true story film you could have heard a pin drop.  The story hit you on many different levels....we discussed it with the students all the way back to school.
The story, set in a school and village, deals with the use of power for bad and discovering you individual power for good.  It is set in the 60's when the way we looked at who was in power and why they had all the power was being challenged.  Deals with issues such as bullying, trust, loyalty.",1208390400,3,624,4.299145299145299
