8291874,4,B001D690JW,"""Redwood Saga,"" a commercial documentary film made by Guy D. Haselton in 1946, is fascinating from a number of angles.

On one hand, it shows how the California redwoods, now the object of awe and protection, were then regarded simply as commercial assets.  It explains the properties of redwood lumber that made the trees so valuable.  Most viewers will now be astonished by the narrative written by Joseph E. Johnston, but it usefully conveys to us the ethos of a different time.

Students of economic history and industrial organization should likewise be fascinated by the film's view of production processes as the Sequoias were marked, cut, felled, hauled, carried by railroad the millponds, and then cut into lumber.  Rookie filmmakers and film editors can admire this sample of a B&W documentary when films were still ""cut.""  And while we are now stunned by this film of how a great natural patrimony was felled, we must also admire the grit and skill of the loggers of the time.

This ten-minute film can also be viewed on the web.
