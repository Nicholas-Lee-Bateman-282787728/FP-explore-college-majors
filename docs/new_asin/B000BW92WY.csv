8093453,1,B000BW92WY,"I had to watch this film because it inspired the shooting death of rebecca schaeffer.

it's a strange 'film' about the 'ultra'rich and the 'many' problems they endure, i.e: what car to buy and/or mansion.

ordinary 'people' could NOT relate to ANY of their circumstances and/or lives.

the plot is flimsy as is the acting even more so.

not a celluloid masterpieces.",1463702400,,366,4.854838709677419
8093454,4,B000BW92WY,Here is yet another movie that is not out on DVD. An excellent comedy. One of Paul Bartel's finest. I am constantly surprised by why really good movies aren't on DVD.,1461628800,,166,4.387096774193548
8093455,5,B000BW92WY,"I watched this movie back when came out and loved it. You can not GET a copy in the US but good ole Germany will send you a copy and it was perfect! Showed up after a cpl weeks, movie was perfect. Highly recommend the seller and the movie is SO FUNNY!",1434931200,,251,3.8461538461538463
8093456,2,B000BW92WY,"Wonderful movie, should be available on DVD in the States (Region 1) but isn't.  I figure what the heck, I have a universal DVD player, so I paid the extravagant price for it.  Alas, if you watch it with the original English soundtrack there is NO WAY to turn off the Italian subtitles, which are very distracting.  Damn.  Wish I'd known that.",1428537600,,343,4.483870967741935
8093457,3,B000BW92WY,"Love this film, but this transfer is very bad and fairly dark (and I'm not one to obsess about pristine DVD or Blu-ray images).  This may even be somewhat less than VHS quality.  The darkness can more or less be compensated for with your television's brightness and contrast settings.

To date this film has not been released on DVD in the United States.  This release is from Germany (it has German language on the back of the packaging, and the main language is not English (though you can play around with the German language selectors in the menus until you find the English soundtrack.

This is better than nothing, but hopefully the rights owner will do a proper release -- both for us and to honor the late Paul Bartel.

This really is a fantastically funny film.  Highly recommended with the caveats mentioned above.",1399939200,9,824,4.680555555555555
