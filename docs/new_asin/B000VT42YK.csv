8219852,4,B000VT42YK,"Warming:  this video contains interviews and up-close clips of the late Moe Norman, likely Canada's best ever.
His method is carefully explained as Moe hits a lot of balls with machine-like efficiency.  It worked for him, and
also modified, worked for Canadian-great George Knudson, and is taught today by the Graves Golf Academy.
Does it work: I tried it for a stretch of time, and yes it works, but is a bit awkward for me:  when I'm older (only
66 now), I may return for less back and shoulder stress offered by this method.",1390521600,,527,4.585106382978723

8219854,3,B000VT42YK,"Although there is noting wrong with the golf method advocated on this DVD, I had thought I was purchasing the Natural Golf Swing Motion by George Knudson.  Because Knudson's book and DVD have a title very close to the one I purchased, my Amazon search led me to believe that I was purchasing the Knudson DVD when in fact I was not.  I take part of the blame since I should have looked more closely at what I was buying.  I guess I was so happy to see the Knudson DVD for sale (which is very hard to find) that I overlooked the slight difference in title.",1332633600,4,554,4.158878504672897
8219855,1,B000VT42YK,"I live in Thailand, I had the DVD sent to America.  When I visited, I did not open it, but packed it in my carry on luggage.  Upon arrival in Thailand, when I went to copy it, so I could play it here, I discovered it was cracked and unplayable.
I am past the return date, but even if I were to rturn it and have it shipped back here, the cost would be around $40.00.
If the seller had inspected the product, he would have seen it was cracked.
poorly done.",1286928000,,455,3.9347826086956523
8219856,5,B000VT42YK,"I was a golfing nightmare before I bought this.
After watching the video only one time, and practicing the swing at home, I went to a 9-hole course to practice. I could hit the ball straighter immediately.

The system just works. Try it; you'll be pleased.",1251763200,4,256,4.565217391304348
