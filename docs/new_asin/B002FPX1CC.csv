3923925,4,B002FPX1CC,"Shanti Generation for Youth Peacemakers
(Instructional DVD)
By Abby Wills, MA
Available through [...]

As a counselor for adolescents going through recovery I observed first hand that physical health was synonymous with mental and emotional health. There is nothing more important for a young person than to find a way to simply sit and be present. At the very heart of most problems that any of us experience is our inability to sit still. Whether you are a yoga teacher or a parent seeking ways to guide your children to find their own bliss in a world filled with distractions, you will find this DVD invaluable.

3923926,5,B002FPX1CC,"I love the Shanti Generation DVD!  I teach teens and tweens and this DVD really appeals to them.  The music and presentation of the DVD make it fun for kids of all ages, and it presents yoga in a ""cool"" way.  I also like how the kids do the yoga and explain how yoga helps to support their well-being and health.  I highly recommend this DVD for kids and their teachers too!",1260057600,2,374,4.152777777777778
3923927,5,B002FPX1CC,"I love Shanti Generation's new DVD. It's exceptional in quality and inviting in a multitude of ways. Abby's wealth of experience working with this age group is very clear. I love how Abby  gently, clearly and respectfully guides her students from the background, allowing each one to step into his/ her own light. Her voice is both strong and soothing and immediately creates a safe space for adolescents to explore. The reciprocal trust between Abby and her students is beautiful and this DVD offers an invitation to join in that experience. The yoga sequences are fun and easy to follow. I love how Abby  offers step-by-step suggestions for greater understanding of each pose. Her choice of language is very clear and impressively age-appropriate. It's real, down to earth and empowering. Meeting the peacemakers is fantastic! The choreography is exquisite, the set designs calming and beautiful and the musical accompaniment is brilliant. In my opinion, Shanti Generation is a very valuable work of art.
I recently viewed this with my 13 yr old very athletic, energetic son. We did a yoga sequence from ""Choose you Path."" He chose ""Being Peace."" Amazed that he was wiling to try this with me, I followed his lead. After a few moments I looked over at him. He was sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed, breathing peacefully. It brought tears to my eyes.
Thank you Abby and team for sharing your creative gifts with the world and for moving yoga education forward with such love and respect.

3923928,5,B002FPX1CC,"While I'm certainly not young enough to be considered a 'youth', I found this video to be an excellent resource for in-home yoga practice.  In fact, I bought 2 copies--one for me and one for my grandchildren.

The poses are well explained and illustrated, keeping me on track for a safe and healthful experience.  I can do what I want, when I want.

And the music is perfectly tailored for each segment--in the background but adding greatly to the overall experience.

3923929,5,B002FPX1CC,"First of all, Kudos to Abby Wills for producing an entirely ""green"" dvd cover. It is made of 100% recycled board stock, soy ink, and biodegradable potato starch tray. How often do you see that? How they did that and still managed to keep this DVD under $20 is amazing.

Now, on to the content. There are so many yoga videos out there, and several geared towards children and teens. None come even close to this! The production value is outstanding, the kids are doing the poses accurately, and the soundtrack is excellent.

While this is geared toward youth, my wife and I enjoyed practicing the poses as well. It's a really relaxing release from the world.",1250208000,4,657,4.6068376068376065
3923930,5,B002FPX1CC,"In Shanti Generation, teens share yoga with teens.  It's hip, relevant, helpful as well as visually inspiring and appealing to use.  The way the material is organized invites personal choice and multiples uses.  I love that everything about it supports teens in more deeply connecting with and nurturing themselves.  I'm buying it for every teen i know.",1249603200,2,353,5.140350877192983
3923931,5,B002FPX1CC,"Abby Wills and her team have done an outstanding job of bringing a high quality, high production value, content packed DVD to the youth of the world.  I think teens will find this very user-friendly, appealing and most importantly, doable.  I watched this with my own kids (8, 11, 13) and they enjoyed seeing kids doing the poses.  We also enjoyed the ""Special Features"" and learning more about the young ""stars"" of the such a well-thought out DVD.
I know I will be recommending this to all the teens I know.

3923952,5,B002FPX1CC,I teach at a Montessori middle school and every Friday we enjoy participating in yoga together. Montessori education includes a peace curriculum and this video truly speaks to the peacefulness we strive to teach our children. Students enjoy the fact that the poses are led by other teens and I appreciate the variety of poses. Perhaps the best part is that every video ends with a long meditation. My students rave about how relaxed and happy they feel after the meditation series.,1455321600,,481,4.878048780487805
3923953,5,B002FPX1CC,"This was on Netflix a while back and my teen daughter and I would do them all the time! It's no longer on Netflix so I was glad to find this! I'm an adult and I find these great to follow, challenging at times and the voices and music are spot on!
I despise workout/yoga videos with irritating music or voices or repetitive monologue. These are perfect in all counts, and completely customizable!",1455148800,,396,4.438356164383562
3923954,5,B002FPX1CC,My 9 year old really loved this DVD! She ended up doing all of the segments. Great for beginners!,1453334400,,97,4.157894736842105
3923955,1,B002FPX1CC,I hate ads and long time wastage video before the actual yoga and no easy way to skip them(each time).,1451260800,2,102,4.15
3923956,2,B002FPX1CC,"I bought this to be able to do yoga with my 9 and 11 yr old kids. Turned it on, and the beginning of the DVD talks about environment and things for so long I ended up fast forwarding through because my kids were losing interest. I honestly didn't watch more than 10 minutes of the DVD because it wasn't what I thought it would be, plus by this time I was frustrated it didn't hold my kids (or my) attention longer.",1445126400,2,414,4.060975609756097
3923957,5,B002FPX1CC,Wife and kids do this every AM for 10 minutes before getting ready for school.,1444435200,,78,4.266666666666667
3923958,5,B002FPX1CC,Great Yoga DVD for kids. Not too difficult and sends a good message.,1443916800,,68,4.3076923076923075
3923959,5,B002FPX1CC,My students love this video!,1437091200,,28,4.8
3923960,2,B002FPX1CC,Got this for my kids and they weren't crazy about it. I think they were more used to following instructions all the way though with a visual demo and this disc didn't fill the need.,1435881600,,181,4.2
3923961,2,B002FPX1CC,Not enough instruction for some of the trickier poses or safety guidance. My daughter had an injury when she had difficulty with a pose and now will probably never do yoga again.,1435363200,,178,4.59375
3923972,5,B002FPX1CC,"This DVD is great. My kids ages 5, 7, and 9 love it. It's not too difficult or boring. They ask for it every day.",1434585600,,113,3.56
3923973,5,B002FPX1CC,Just great! The class of second and third graders are loving doing different parts of it every day. It is interesting to them and keeps their attention. I would definitely recommend it to others for class use or at home.,1431129600,,220,4.525
3923974,5,B002FPX1CC,"I bought this DVD when I was looking for something ""older"" for my three boys, ages 9-12, who were a bit too grown for most of the kids yoga DVDs that I could find. We all absolutely love it. My boys really like seeing the young teens (especially other boys!) on the video, and it really motivates them to go ahead and try some of the more challenging poses. It's a more serious practice, which is very appropriate for their level. My 9-year-old uses it daily, sometimes twice a day. My 12-year-old loves using the Breathing Room after a rough day. Even my three year old daughter will try to follow along with her brothers! So thankful for this ""bridge"" between young children and adults.",1429228800,4,688,4.512

3923976,5,B002FPX1CC,Product was shipped quickly and arrived as described.,1425945600,,53,5.75
3923977,5,B002FPX1CC,"I love how this dvd is set up.  You can access short vinyasas that focus on a theme or you can search a library for poses.  Teens & tweens will like it, but I am using it to fuel my yoga classes for younger kids as well.  Excellent work!!  Om, shanti.",1424563200,,251,3.8627450980392157
3923978,5,B002FPX1CC,My class loves it. They ask to do yoga every day!,1423353600,,49,3.5454545454545454
3923979,5,B002FPX1CC,"We used this in school with emotional/behavioral kids. They complained but it really helped to calm them down. There are several ways of viewing the posses, I mostly used the compilation (there are 5 or 6 different compilations to choose from) but if the group needed to calm down I would put on a breathing session. I used shorter compilations with a high school class, so it would take less time, and they loved the relaxation one. I saw improvement with ADHD kids, they became calmer and more focused in the session over time. The teacher would love how they were after doing the poses.

I bought the most recent for a niece, she was very happy to receive it.",1422576000,,662,4.516666666666667

3923981,5,B002FPX1CC,"Use it with my fourth grades. Both the boys and girls look forward to yoga days. Great way to develop flexibility, balance and strength.",1415404800,,136,4.708333333333333
3923992,2,B002FPX1CC,This DVD is not kid friendly. There are 30 minutes or so of political propaganda you must fast forward thru before you get to the actual workouts. By the time you fast forward through that my kid has lost her motivation. I do not recommend this DVD.,1404345600,7,249,4.319148936170213
3923993,4,B002FPX1CC,"Sequences are great, but a little slow to begin. For some, this introduction might be great, but my daughter doesn't like having to go through it every time.",1401321600,2,157,4.642857142857143
3923994,5,B002FPX1CC,My two kids (9 year old boy and 10 year old girl) love doing this with me. It works perfect to take a moment from our day to quietly do our yoga together. Not difficult at all. But leaves you feeling rested and refreshed afterwards.,1400198400,,232,4.177777777777778
3923995,4,B002FPX1CC,Its a good video for kids but very tedious to get to the exercise per se. I wish they would have an screen from which you could access the exercises directly.,1397347200,3,158,4.129032258064516
3923996,5,B002FPX1CC,"My daughter began this video when it was on Netflix.  She's a 5 year old with ASD. She would would request it before school and before bed EVERY DAY. Really cute! But one day out of nowhere Nextflix removed it. Needless to say as a child with autism any disruption in her daily schedule means total disruption in every other part of her day.  After a week of searching, we were so happy to find it on Amazon!!!! She is back to her routine!!! Thanks Amazon and Shanti Generation!!",1391904000,3,479,4.370786516853933
3923997,3,B002FPX1CC,"I paid for express shipping to receive this in time for our Christmas gathering, but it did not arrive within the two day time frame.  However, when it finally did arrive, my Granddaughter was thrilled and she loves it.  The DVD is very age appropriate and entertaining for a 9 year old.  My Granddaughter practices her Yoga routine everyday.  Thank you.",1390262400,,354,4.754098360655738
3923998,5,B002FPX1CC,"We enjoy doing this as a family. My daughter loves yoga, dance and other activities, so she asks to do it often. My son is 4 and he doesn't last through the sessions, but he does begin with us!",1389225600,,193,3.9743589743589745
3923999,5,B002FPX1CC,"My 10 year old daughter loves this dvd and I like doing it with her. She practices a lot of the breathing exercises when she gets stressed out. There's only a few poses that she's not strong or flexible enough for yet, but she's getting there.",1389139200,,243,4.304347826086956
3924000,5,B002FPX1CC,Purchased this for use in my classroom.  I had 8 students each Friday for 30 minutes.  The timing was perfect; we could get through one set of positions in that time.,1388620800,,166,4.32258064516129
3924001,5,B002FPX1CC,This has been terrific for my pe classes when it is raining outside and we are forced to do exercises in small classrooms.,1381968000,,122,4.3478260869565215
3924002,4,B002FPX1CC,"This is a good DVD. My family likes that it is not ""kidzy"" and does not talk down to kids or adults. The only thing we struggle with is that it does not move enough for my 6 yr old.",1373328000,,181,3.55
3924003,5,B002FPX1CC,This is a great DVD.  My kids and I have a great time completing the poses together.  They really like the fact that actual kids are teaching them.  This video is wonderful and I can get my hockey boys to do yoga and really enjoy it.,1371513600,,233,4.021739130434782

I love it!

3924005,5,B002FPX1CC,"I was looking to see if Netflix had any yoga workouts on instant queue and this was the only one so I tried it, even though it is aimed at teens.  I'm so glad that I did.  I'm a 45 year old woman with a little yoga experience and I was looking for a short basic workout between my weekly classes with poses that I can do.  I did the first workout and it was exactly what I needed.  Simple, straightforward, and very relaxing.  I will try the other workouts and post back if my review changes.

If you are looking for a workout for your kids, keep in mind that this is aimed at teens and tweens.  It is not really aimed at small children, though a younger child could probably do this as well.",1364256000,14,692,4.044117647058823
3924006,3,B002FPX1CC,"I am a beginner with yoga, but I bought this hoping to do yoga with my oldest.  When it comes to the actual yoga piece, there's no introduction, just hop right into it.  If you don't know what you're doing, you need to look at the screen to see what they're doing, but they go through it so fast that you're apt to miss really doing it and getting any benefit out of it.  I need to go back to it and try it again, but the first time through was not relaxing and inspiring.",1361836800,4,472,3.9473684210526314
3924007,5,B002FPX1CC,"I bought this video for my 8 year old daughter and 6 year old son, and I just love it!  I've always been more of a pilates fan, but both of my kids expressed interest in yoga so I found this DVD.  The instruction is clear, and I love that the ""teachers"" are all kids because it makes it so much easier for my kids to relate.  The voice over is fantastic, really drawing them into a meditative state during the exercises.  I can't say enough - if you're new to yoga and want to enjoy it right along with your family, don't hesitate.  Buy this DVD!",1359936000,4,546,4.065420560747664
3924008,2,B002FPX1CC,"This was just OK, not very appealing to my 7-year-old son. The kids in the video were great, but it could have been more fun, less serious.",1359158400,2,139,4.185185185185185
3924009,4,B002FPX1CC,She is 9 and already enjoys doing the tape with her Mom and brothers. There are several different options on the video which provides variety.,1358208000,,142,4.72
3924010,5,B002FPX1CC,"I have tried a couple of times to get my daughter to do yoga with me. I bought this and we have done it three times, and she likes it.  The routines are not the best by my standards (I don't think they don't flow very well) but they are fine.  It has fulfilled my purpose in buying it.  It also introduces the language of yoga (be with your breath, be fine with who you are right now, etc) in such a way that a ten year old isn't immediately turned off.  I really like this video.",1357689600,,480,3.917525773195876
3924011,5,B002FPX1CC,My nine year old son loved this video. I actually did it with him. He found it made him much calmer. He has ADHD/Anxiety and this seems to help him.,1355270400,,148,3.966666666666667
3924012,3,B002FPX1CC,It has some unnecessary information at the beginning.  It takes forever to get to the actual  yoga part in the dvd.,1355097600,3,115,4.428571428571429
3924013,4,B002FPX1CC,"I'm a special Ed teacher and use yoga in my clas 3x a week. With this DVD you get 5-6 options of workouts to choose from. This yoga DVD does a great job of incorporating moves with positive messages for the students. The moves go pretty quickly and some of the poses are challenging. This would not be a DVD that I would start off with if you are new to yoga, but a great DVD all in all.",1351641600,4,387,3.911392405063291
3924014,3,B002FPX1CC,"I wasn't sure when I bought this if my daughter would even use it but she seems to really like it. It has easy to follow poses doe by kids her age and she really likes that. She will often do it twice a day. I personally don't care for some of the ""preachiness"" on the DVD. I just wanted yoga for my child and this has a lot of unnecessary talking and weirdness on it. If I had seen the extra stuff on it, I probably would have passed it up.",1351382400,6,441,3.8043478260869565
3924015,5,B002FPX1CC,"My alternative students love this one...as do I! The kids in the video are wearing normal clothes and are of different genders and races, which helps with buy in. They weren't thrilled to be doing yoga at first, but they love it now. The poses aren't too super challenging...very doable.",1349308800,2,287,4.76
3924016,4,B002FPX1CC,"My daughter is amazingly smart, but she puts so much pressure on herself that it worries me.  I bought this because I thought the calming exercises would ease her stress.  She is 9 years old.  My younger daughter is 8 and I thought it would be beneficial to her in terms of helping her with flexibility.  WOW!  It has delivered on both fronts.  I have never practiced Yoga, so this was an introduction for the whole family.  I was nervous that it would be too difficult.  Now, I should disclose that we've only done the Yoga poses library and not the routines as of yet.  But so far, just the ""calming"" poses alone, was worth the price of the entire video!!!  My daughter gave me a hug when we were done and said to me, ""this is exactly what I've needed!  I think this will be really helpful!""  What a proud Mommy moment I had right then and there! I promise to update this review once we've actually done all the routines.  Lastly, my youngest daughter did comment on the fact that both boys and girls were doing the Yoga poses.  She claimed that she didn't know that boys did Yoga too.  So obviously it was a great decision on the part of the producers to include both sexes, as well as different age ranges.",1344297600,4,1210,4.315555555555555
3924017,5,B002FPX1CC,"About 15 years ago I attended several different types of yoga classes and had a beginner's vhs tape with Jane Fonda demonstrating sun salutations.  It was great and I really noticed how taking the time to get centered in the morning affected the rest of my day.  Now I have two extremely active boys that I compare to the Tasmanian Devil from the old Looney Tunes  cartoons.  It struck me that calming down at night with some guided kid centered yoga asanas could be a great help.

My boys are nine and seven and are on opposite ends of the physical spectrum.  The seven year old is a natural athlete and self-taught gymnast.  My older son, bless his heart, is... a little awkward.  Therefore, it was not a real surprise to see the younger one move through the asanas with ease and the older one struggle with frustration.

There are five different routines on the video and I let the boys take turns choosing.  Having a variety keeps them from getting bored with the same old thing and I've noticed some are better for calming down and getting centered and others are more invigorating and challenging.

The instructor does a great job and offers variations on poses so that people at different levels can participate and feel challenged or ease off if it is too difficult.  The pace is quick, which is great for kids with short attention spans, but not so fast that you don't get the benefit of a good stretch.

It's great to see boys and girls and a variety of body types in the video.  I was really impressed at how well the children demonstrated the poses and was glad to not be distracted by anything too showy.

After having the dvd for over a month, we still haven't viewed all of the segments.  In the beginning there are parts that focus on educating kids about peace and being a part of the world community.  This is a real interest to me but the boys ask me to skip over it.

I gave Shanti Generation five stars because out of all the yoga dvd's for adults that I've seen in the past and including my newest batch that includes Rodney Yee's video for beginners, this one is the best by far. It did not disappoint in the slightest and it exceeded my expectations.",1330300800,,2174,4.433249370277078
3924018,4,B002FPX1CC,"I used this DVD with my combined 2nd/3rd Grade class, with mixed results. My kids felt that they were too old for the KidsYoga DVDs ( although they all participated with those...! ), and I was looking for something just a little older. This was a bit of a jump from ""Okay, now we're all going to act like alligators... let me hear your alligator roar!"" to "" Now move into downward facing dog... deep breath in... ""

  Honestly, the only two things that make this for kids and not adults is that the actors are all tweens/teens ( very racially diverse, both boys and girls -- my kids appreciated that ), and it goes a little slower than an adult yoga DVD. We've only attempted one of the 30 minute sessions, but some of my kids got bored about halfway through. This is probably more appropriate for a little bit older kids, more about the 10-13 age group. For the younger kids, it felt too serious.",1328400000,3,897,4.359281437125748
3924019,5,B002FPX1CC,"This video works wonderfully for an 8-year old boy and 12-year old girl. Two different personalities, yet it has captured them both.",1328227200,,132,5.045454545454546
3924020,5,B002FPX1CC,"If there was ever a time when our youth and teens needed the focus, balance, discrimination, and self-awareness that a solid yoga practice can help us achieve- it's now. Shanti Generation is leading the movement with their Youth Peacemaker's Training and their youth/teen Yoga DVD: Yoga Skills for Youth Peacemakers. My son is eleven, and I've been teaching yoga since before he was born. However, he's not as interested in having his mom as a teacher anymore and there are no youth yoga classes in my area.  The visuals and music are perfect for this age group and Abby Wills has succeeded beautifully in translating yoga meaningfully and appealingly for what can be a tough age group. So glad I found this DVD - it  is filling in the gap for us perfectly!",1325203200,,757,4.684210526315789
3924021,5,B002FPX1CC,"Shanti Generation is simply the best teen dvd on the market.  It's visually cool, emotionally relevant, physically helpful, teen process respectful.  My students appreciate the instruction, the sequences and the sense of connection to the on-screen kids.  Bravo Abby Wills.",1323561600,,273,5.775
3924022,4,B002FPX1CC,"I bought this for my daughter as she had outgrown Yoga Kids.  It took forever to get to the menu (you probably can skip to the menu, but my daughter really likes watching the video that plays- but if your child/teen can't sit still for long I would recommend you immediately skip to the menu).  She has really loved the video and it flies by pretty quickly for her.  She doesn't get bored at all.  It has had a calming effect on her so far.  At this point I would say the intended peacefulness the video purports is accurate for my daughter at least.  We have not had it long so if that changes I'll come alter the review.",1323388800,,622,4.184873949579832
3924023,3,B002FPX1CC,"The video is a little boring for children under 9 years. For adolescents is better. It has long introductions you can not skip before beginning the practice of yoga. This is a bit annoying because you lose time, but otherwise is OK.",1322179200,4,232,4.5476190476190474
3924024,5,B002FPX1CC,"I got this DVD to do with my 9 yr. old son to help him with calming techniques and to have an active activity we do as a family (his 3 yr. old brother also participates,) and we have been very pleased with it.  It's not too childish or new age-ish, it offers a lot of variety between all the options offered in the paths and library of poses, and has great mellow background music.  My son is a bit clumsy yet at most of the poses, but I'm sure he will get better as we continue.  At first he wasn't enthusiastic about doing yoga, but since we've been doing the Shanti yoga now he's the one reminding me to set up our mats in the living room and picking the paths for us to do.",1320796800,,677,3.963235294117647
3924025,5,B002FPX1CC,"I loved this! I was told that I needed to share a hobby with some tween girls. I thought, what hobby? All I can do is....oh yeah...yoga.

So I had to find a beginner video that could explain yoga while making it interesting to tweens and last about half an hour. This was perfect! I've had the video for a while, but wanted to wait until the girls took the class and I had their reaction. What can I say, they loved it as much as I did!

The only problem I had was the length of time the video gave for exhaling and inhaling. It was a little long for the girls. But, they were just learning it and were focused on doing the poses without falling over and were giggling and having a lot of fun. If they choose to take the yoga again (there's a lot of competition - basketball, volleyball, introduction to Japanese language for example), maybe we could start the focus on breathing then. In the meantime, they have been introduced to yoga and enjoyed it. They all took the name of the video and learned they could buy it on Amazon.

Shanti Generation was positive, peaceful, and the background music was amazing. I'm very happy with this purchase and I highly recommend it to others, especially anyone who is a beginner or wanting to share yoga with beginners.",1316563200,2,1258,4.367521367521367
3924026,5,B002FPX1CC,"My first reaction to this was that it's a bit ""hippy dippy"" in style, but my daughters (8 and 6) loved this DVD and they ask to do it every day. The instruction is excellent, the pace perfect, and it has helped them learn focus, and feel calm and positive. There are so few yoga videos for this age group (older than toddlers but not adults), and this one is perfectly well suited for this age group. My daughters have learned the poses very quickly, and the breathing and meditation exercises were explained in a manner that speaks directly, clearly and respectfully to young people. One of my daughters has moderate autism and yoga is very helpful for her- we've done a bit but got out of the regular practice for a while because there were so few resources for the post-toddler set, so it's really good to see her getting back into it and enjoying it so much.",1315526400,,862,4.427672955974843
3924027,5,B002FPX1CC,"I bought this video for my 6-year-old daughter because the Yoga Kids videos are a little too young for her now, but there doesn't appear to be much for 6-9 year olds. This video was good for her, although not great because the actors are all more in the 11-16 age range. She does do many of the Yoga moves, but it probably isn't entertaining enough for her. However, it is awesome as a family yoga video!! There are at least a dozen different routines that you can easily do to give it some variety and to emphasize what you want--e.g., calm, breathing, energy, strength. It is the best designed exercise video that I've ever seen. The menus are clear and intuitive. Everything is responsive without too much filler time to get in the way of the yoga, but yet calm, as any Yoga video should be. I highly recommend for anyone (adults included) interested in Yoga videos!",1311897600,7,869,4.506329113924051
3924028,4,B002FPX1CC,"Nicely done video - very professionally depicts teens who are dedicated to yoga. I love that it has boys as well as girls! My 10 yr old daughter loves it, but it seems a little too serious for my 7 yr old.",1311120000,4,205,3.9047619047619047
3924029,5,B002FPX1CC,I love practicing yoga myself and my seven year old have been having a lot of problems with anger and focusing so I thought it would be great to introduce my kids to the practice as well. I'm glad I decided to purchase this particular video. The poses are fairly simple and the teacher really does a good job of explaining so the children can understand. If you want to introduce yoga to your children this is an excellent buy!,1305676800,4,427,4.35
3924030,5,B002FPX1CC,"I have an eleven year old son and nine year old daughter.  They have been picking up on some of the yoga poses they have seen me practice and asked for their own DVD.  I looked through several different ones and decided on this one.  I am so very glad I bought Shanti Generation.  I feel like it was the perfect springboard to really get them into yoga. I was especially afraid that my son would thing yoga was just for girls but I'm happy to report that he really liked it and felt like it was challenging but not too difficult. They also like the fact that they can do a different set of poses each time by picking a different path.  They take turns choosing paths each day, just one more way to practice being peacemakers!

We also bought one other Teens yoga dvd and a kids' exersize DVD.  So many of them are for younger kids or have adults saying stuff like ""Wow kids, isn't this fun!?!""  This DVD doesn't dumb anything done or talk to kids like they're stupid.  It also shows boys and girls in it.  The music was great.

We loved this DVD and hope Shanti Generation makes a sequel! Give it a try.  You won't be sorry!

P.S. Be careful about one thing- Shanti Generation's package is 100% recycled board stock, soy ink, and a biodegradable potato starch tray.  This is awesome!  However, when you open it for the first time, you might have to adjust the tray piece holding the DVD because it does not hold the DVD well and mine slid right out and got scratched before I even put it in the DVD player.  Just fix it before you drop it.  Other than that, everything else was five stars!",1303084800,12,1589,4.260869565217392

Our local classes are for adults, and the only ""youth"" videos we'd found previously were geared towards young children (preschool age).  This is just what we wanted!  The exercises are modeled by people in her age group, the tone is appropriate, and it emphasizes the mental aspects of yoga in addition to the physical movements.  It is appropriate for beginners as well as those who have some experience.  (We do the yoga sequences together.)  She loves this!",1296432000,5,570,4.885416666666667
3924032,4,B002FPX1CC,"We ordered this DVD several weeks ago but only just got around to trying it out.  My son (11 yrs) really enjoyed the exercises and didn't have too much difficulty following along with the poses and movements.  Each ""path"" is performed by a group of young teens and runs for about half an hour.  My only criticism is that there is no ""flow"" between each pose in the path.  For instance, you may be sitting on the ground for one pose, and then there is a brief break in the video and the next pose begins with a new kid demonstrating, and the kid may be standing up or laying on his back.",1278547200,3,586,4.15929203539823

3924034,5,B002FPX1CC,I purchased this dvd for my 9 year old daughter who's shown some interest in doing yoga with me. I did a search for something that would be age approriate that she could really relate to and she loves this!! We received it yesterday and she did it for the second time tonight. She is diagnosed with ADD and I feel this is a great tool to help her deal with her feelings and to channel her energy in a postive way. She added this to her job chart...not that she considers it a job. I really feel this will be an invaluable part of her routine. Definitely worth every penny!,1277251200,4,572,4.162162162162162
3924035,5,B002FPX1CC,"We enjoy the quick routines!

I purchased this for my daughter, age 8, because she wanted to do yoga with me, but I wasn't sure she would pay attention through a more adult oriented workout.  She followed all the instructions and was very enthusiastic about participating in an interest of mine.  We go through one of the sessions about every other day, and I enjoy the quick but revitalizing routines myself.

Great for practicing parents whose kids want to join them, and for those families that do not have access to a yoga studio.  We live an hour away from the closest yoga studio, so we practice on our own.  Only thing of concern that I have, is that I feel that this video is best for those who are practitioners already and familiar with the poses; not quite a ""beginners"" pace.",1270857600,21,787,4.507042253521127

3924037,5,B002FPX1CC,"I was looking for a yoga video to use with my 4th grade class, and ordered the Shanti Generation DVD. It provides a great variety of 30 minute sessions to choose from, which makes it a great deal for the price. It teaches form, concepts, and personal development with ease and beauty, and uses young people (male and female) as the guides through all the postures. They are appropriately challenging for young folks being introduced to yoga, but as an adult I also enjoy the routines.  I've been amazed how well the DVD has been received by my class. They now regularly ask for this one over my other DVDs, and are more eager than ever to do Monday morning yoga! It really is geared to the older elementary or middle school child, and I highly recommend it for anyone who works with or has children between 7-16 years old.",1263772800,96,822,4.48

We are working to strengthen her core muscles and bring her back muscles into a more even alignment.  These exercises are exactly what the Physical Therapist prescribed to strengthen her muscles gently and slowly, helping prevent further curvature.  The exercises are easy to follow and fun for kids.  It is well-made and well-balanced between strengthening and flexibility exercises.  I would recommend this dvd to anyone wishing to introduce yoga to children.",1263772800,17,602,5.28421052631579

This DVD is wonderful and I originally bought it for my niece and she was quite excited to do the yoga poses.  I held onto it till Christmas so I could watch it myself and shared it with my friend's kids and they really enjoyed it. So after I post this review I am getting another copy.  I think its important that our Youth Peacemakers get the proper time to relax and balance themselves.  I wish I could have had something like this when I was a teen, it really does help and it has challenged me as well as this was my first time doing Yoga.  Abby did a wonderful job and I type this at 3:11 PM haha as did P-Nut and so thankful for this DVD and looking forward to sharing it with many others.
This is a great gift, and its great to share with family, this next one I am sharing with my childhood friend to share with her kids and neighbors :)",1263340800,,939,3.978723404255319

It really is a great program, and I can see how beneficial it can be for kids not just physically but it also teaches them mental discipline and emotional control, how to center it and release it in a positive way.
Children deal with allot of stress and fear of the unknown, and they don't have the experience or knowledge to know how to handle it. Even though we just started using the DVD I can already notice how it's helping him focus, stay calm and find peace and strength within him before freaking out!",1261008000,,712,4.166666666666667

It got enough teachers involved and encouraged them to start yoga units in PE in middle school and now thoughout all grade levels. Yoga in the library started with kindergarten and then expanded as teachers and students asked for it. The stories l hear from parents are what is most inspiring. Hearing that their child will just start doing yoga posses in the living room in the middle of hectic family life and during stressful times, almost made me cry happy tears! That is what you want-kids to do it on their own when they need to calm down or focus. I can't say enough good things about this DVD!!!
