8026841,2,B0002DRC1U,"I generally don't have a problem with cheap, unrestored public-domain copies of hard-to-find DVD titles-- if it's a worthwhile movie I'm glad to get it in any form I can.  Miracle Pictures' release of 'The Death Merchants' (aka 'Tod eines Fremden,' 1973), unhappily, is one of the few exceptions to that rule.  Not only are we presented with a washed-out pan-and-scan print (with murky, poorly synced audio) duped from VHS, but the transfer is so low-res you may want to sit in the next room to achieve anything approaching a sharp picture.  Other reviewers here sum up the story reasonably well and, while in most respects TDM is typical of an international production from the era (a low-budget potboiler with variable acting and a few interesting turns of plot), it's entertaining enough to merit a recommendation (3ish stars).  In terms of watchability, however, it would be difficult to rate the experience much above 1 star.",1376870400,,930,4.980645161290322
8026842,3,B0002DRC1U,"Jason Robards plays a brandy swigging, cane hobbling investigator in this production which is more drama than action. A group of terrorists is being hunted in the age old Arab-Israeli conflict. A fiction person of high importance is fabricated by Israeli intelligence so they can track the European terrorist group wanting to find him. A prominent lawyer named Hersfeld is mistaken for the fictional man Herzog as he becomes the target of Arab assassination.

The film shows its age with poor quality transfer. The Arab terrorists read poetry while a candle is lit and posters of Che and Mao are on the wall and flute music is playing. Nothing like combining art, terrorist, communists, and hippies as the agents against Israeli and goodness. That scene in itself might make a worth while view in a history of film as reflective of cultural views. Otherwise the action and drama don't live up to 21st century standards. The film is slow.

Also under the title ""The Spy Who Never Was.""
