8629526,5,B00H3PWOJU,"Linear algebra as a math class takes on many forms in a college curriculum, but the the techniques that you use in the class (specifically solving systems of equations) carry over into many other classes, especially if you are an engineering major of any type.  I am an electrical engineering major, but have also had to take some of the ""basic"" mechanical engineering classes like statics and dynamics and systems of equations show up all over the place in those classes.  And if you know how to use matricies to solve them, then your life will be made much easier when doing homework and exam problems because you do not have to waste time using substitution techniques which can take a very very long time and has lots of steps.

In most college's math curriculum the first introduction to matrix algebra comes in college algebra.  Jason actually has a set out already that goes through a lot of that material in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix-Algebra-Tutor-Linear-Algebra/dp/B001A01N14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix Algebra Tutor: Linear Algebra</a>.  In fact there is some cross over between that set and this one.  But what you need from that set is covered in only the first couple class sessions in a linear algebra course.  Then schools class offerings can vary.  At the community college level you usually get a course that gets called calculus 4, which combines basic linear algebra and basic differential equations into one course.  In that course the first half (or so) of the class is devoted to linear algebra, then the last part of the course is devoted to differential equations, including using some of the linear algebra techniques to solve differential equations.  Then at the very end of the course you start talking about Laplace Transforms which Jason covers in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Laplace-Transform-Tutor/dp/B00GNIFHZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Laplace Transform Tutor</a>.  In a 4 year university, you usually get 1 course for basic linear algebra and 1 for basic differential equations, which is what the engineering majors take, then the ""full blown"" versions of linear algebra and differential equations as separate courses that the math majors take.  Many schools also have a version of linear algebra that is tailored specifically to a computer science curriculum (which is also the big real world application of linear algebra).

What you get in this set is about 1/2 or so of what you would get in a basic linear algebra course or calculus 4 course, and about 1/4 to 1/3 of what your would get in a full blown linear algebra class.  Some of the material on vectors you may not encounter much in a basic course.  That depends on your instructor, but the rest of it you absolutely will cover no matter what version of linear algebra you take.  It starts off with with the basics of matrices, including the various arithmetic operations, then goes into some vector operations (that will have some cross over with calculus 3 and a calculus based physics course) and then goes into the various ways for solving systems of equations, first using row reduction method and then using inverse matrices.  In this set he goes through all the work by hand whereas in some of his engineering DVD sets he explains how to do the operations in a calculator (which is also what you will learn in many classes).  Some instructors do however require students to do the operations by hand without a calculator at least on homework and a quiz or two.  If you do have an instructor like that this will prepare you to get through that.

I know Jason intends to release multiple volumes of linear algebra DVDs.  Currently he has a second volume&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Linear-Algebra-Tutor-Volume-2-5-Hour-Video-Course/dp/B00KM74GZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Linear Algebra Tutor - Volume 2 - 5 Hour Video Course</a>&nbsp;which will cover most of the rest of what you will get in a basic course.  Just know that, like with his other sets, he hits the big concepts that are the basics of what you need to know.  He does not go into every detail so there will be some material that fills in what you learn from the big concepts and expands on them that you are not going to get here.  So you cannot use this as a replacement for going to class.  But it gives you enough, that if you do understand this material well, you can get through the other stuff without a major problem.  Jason also does not spend time going through proofs in this set (which is pretty much the case with his other DVDs as well).  Anyone who has taken the class can tell you that linear algebra can have some of the most brutal proofs to work through, so if you are unfortunate enough to have a professor or instructor who loves to spend time on and test on proofs, while this can still be of use it may not be as much help as you need.  But it is also impossible to get through the proofs if you do not understand the basic concepts, so I still think this can help no matter what.",1406419200,2,5152,5.043632075471698
8629527,5,B00H3PWOJU,The junior year in the electrical engineering curriculum can be confusing if you do not have a firm grasp of systems equations. This was a summer gift to a student entering the junior year.,1405814400,,189,4.588235294117647
