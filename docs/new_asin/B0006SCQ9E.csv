I wondered why she took it I wondered why he would be motivated to abuse such a pretty, petite woman. I have made many documentaries about crime prevention and personal safety and thought it would be an interesting topic for me to explore. My research took me to an organization that helped women escape the clutches of abusive husbands. They were suspicious of my motives for the film and were unresponsive. I found another group who were basically treated me the same way. I realized that the women protecting the victims were suspicious of men in general. I read and studied and it became clear that many of the people who were dealing with the victims were placing the entire blame and emotionally charging their presentations toward the disfunction of the perpetrator. In most cases, this is entirely called for, however, in most cases it does not get to the root of the problem. In most cases just pointing the finger of blame offers us nothing more than a simple ""I told you so."" This has been a popular way to bring awareness to a subject. I, on the other hand, have made my film-making career based on the idea that if you show a problem, you should also show a solution.

I finally got a break with a team of individuals who wanted to bring more than light to the subject. They were a team of individuals committed to the idea that we can make a difference and educate people about domestic violence and give them solutions. People can make a difference if they know what to do and how to recognize domestic violence.

This film will engage you at the very beginning and by the end you will know what to do and how to do it.

This film is only available in DVD.",1286582400,,1801,4.418674698795181
