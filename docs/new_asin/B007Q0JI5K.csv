8520954,3,B007Q0JI5K,"A Close Call for Boston Blackie, 1946 film

A police car returns Blackie to his home. He sees men attacking a woman, then drive off. She is rescued. A young child was left in his rooms. Jerry explains the problem. Then her husband John shows up with a revolver! Blackie disarms him, then a man shows up to shoot John! Faraday arrives to question them. He hears a baby, then finds John Paytons body! Blackie is in trouble again. Can he escape custody? The attendants take the covered body away. Jerry visits her friends, we learn about the plot! This is a scheme to defraud Mr. Payton Sr. [Note the icebox.] Can Runt get milk for the child? Yes, in a disguise. Mamie calls Faraday about the child. Blackie offers a deal to Detective Matthews, then he leaves.

Runt returns with a glass bottle of milk, Mamie tells what she did. Blackie returns, Detective Matthews follows them. There is a double surprise here. Mr. Paytons lawyer shows up, Inspector Faraday talks to Jerry. Some of the truth comes out. Faraday and Jerry visit Blackie. A pack of dogs arrives to create confusion, so Blackie escapes. Blackie figures out the deal (there was no Payton baby born in the last three years). Blackie disguises himself to investigate the scheme. But things go awry. Inspector Faraday arrives. Will he make a mistake? There is a surprise at the end, but the problem is solved. Inspector Faraday explains his actions.

Boston Blackie was a reformed safecracker who solved crimes. Milkmen delivered glass bottles of milk each morning (this service died out in the 1950s). Electric refrigerators kept food fresher than iceboxes. Icemen delivered blocks of ice on schedule. Old movies contain information about life in olden days. Note how all the men wore hats then.",1469232000,,1754,4.801324503311259

8520957,4,B007Q0JI5K,"I've viewed A Close Call for Boston Blackie and Boston Blackie's Chinese Venture and like them both, particularly the former. Chester Morris, by all contemporary reports, must have had as great a zest for life as any man alive, and it really shows in his flair for comedy, his action scenes, and the noticeable rapport he had with his leading ladies and with Blackie's sidekick, ""the Runt."" The latter was played by George E. Stone in Close Call, but not in Chinese Venture, where his presence was sorely missed.

This is a memorable detective series. Sony has missed the boat in packaging the Blackie movies individually, at up to 20 simoleons a pop. That's a lot of mazumas for any B picture. Not one of the Boston Blackie pictures was  a cinematic classic, but take as a series they offered a lot of entertainment value from characters that we returned to time and again as old friends. Sony really should consider packing this series the way they did the Bad Girls of Film Noir, 2 movies per disc, 2 discs to a package. (TCM does its Greatest Classic Film Collection the same way.) The same goes for the Warren William / Lone Wolf movies and for the Crime Doctor and The Whistler, whenever they get around to release those vintage series. Right now, Warner Archive clearly has the advantage in detective series reissues because of smarter packaging. If the folks at Sony can get wise to themselves, they can realize a greater sales volume in the detective classics market and serve the public better.",1375660800,11,1504,4.693181818181818

8520959,2,B007Q0JI5K,"Boston Blackie and his sidekick ""Runt"" go through the standard paces in a strictly by the numbers episode of their series in ""A Close Call for Boston Blackie"". I've collected 6 espisodes of this series and so far this is the least insteresting of them. Though the history of the Boston Blackie charactor goes back a while, the film series follows the far more successful Thin Man series in production, without that series wonderful witty writting, acting or production. Boston Blackie is produced on a shoestring and the writting is very low grade and simple. The cookie cutter police charactors of Farraday and his dim witted side kick would make you wonder if they could solve any case beyond jay walking. If you want clever, intelligent mystery/detective writting, watch the Thin Man, Miss Marple or Philo Vance series, leave Boston Blackie on the shelf.",1337385600,4,857,4.958333333333333
