He so thoroughly enjoys the beautiful places he visits and scrumptious foods he indulges in, he's a very appealing host.  Throw in his sweetness and fabulous sense of humor, and you have a winning show.  Bravo Phil, I'll have what you're having!",1445126400,6,331,4.377049180327869
7310594,2,B010F0KU9K,"How annoying can one person be?  Watch this series and find out.  He is extremely self-absorbed with no good reason.  The show purportedly is about him finding great food in great places but most of it is just about watching him make orgiastic faces while eating food that only the one- percenters could afford.  OK for about 15 minutes and then he starts to grate like a Micro-plane.  The show is redeemed(to a small extent) by the beautiful places he visits. Unfortunately, his face is featured more than the scenery.  His commentary sounds like a script from a TV sit-com.  A far cry from  really fun and informative shows like ""Simply Ming"" or ""Rick Steves.""",1444780800,5,662,4.695652173913044
7310595,5,B010F0KU9K,"Phil is this goofy guy who makes lots of facial expressions even walking alone, an American Jewish dude who gets to go to different cities on this Blue Planet and enjoy different meals in restaurants and gatherings and homes of different guests who are professionals, very familiar with the best dishes in their neighborhood. Now this Philly guy eats. He really likes to eat and talk which is hilarious. He is a very genuine, funny guy with absolutely no sophistication who just explains the whole process while consuming every single dish with delight and men, he eats lots and lots of dishes in the name of this production.

Now don't be confused, these are no regular dishes, these are dishes by chef artists who are at the top of their game and what they have is what billionaires are after I am not into these food documentaries, not my gig at all but I wanted to watch the Tokyo episode since I love sea food which happens to be my main diet. I figured I will see how this nation which consumes half of the sea food in the world prepares their food so possibly I could learn a thing or two. I got much more than what I bargained for since I got to see a whole culture. Now that was the Tokyo episode and Phil has many other episodes that I will be watching since I will get to travel to different parts of the world, learn about cultures and learn about food that I can die for. Phil is the perfect host for this travel series for food and he gets to experience life just like you are suppose to before leaving this Blue Planet only if you happen to be a lucky soul. Unbelievable food, culture, tradition and much more in every city with different language and that funny, goofy Phil guy who does an excellent job of putting the whole series together, infact a very superb job. Traveling is a must for humanity and this series is one heck of funny, entertaining, delicious and mouth watering series that everyone needs to watch and see how different humans are in every part of this Blue Planet and how differently they cope with live when it comes to filling their stomachs. Each episode is almost 55 minutes and Phil gets to go to Tokyo, Paris, Florence, Los Angeles, Hong Kong and Barcelona. Phil needs to do a whole complete series about Africa, Middle East and South America sometime in future. A must see series, Bravo Philly boy.

JAPAN: Now don't be confused, these are no regular dishes, these are dishes by chef artists who are at the top of their game and what they have is what billionaires are after; tasty, amazingly put together ingredients unlike what anyone else in the world could even dream of, even the best restaurants chefs. These are colorful, tasty dishes to die for. For these dishes not only these food must taste delicious and blink your visual sensory, but more importantly these Japanese people offer you dining experience that no money in the world can buy such experience except tradition. With all positive things that I just said, I have to admit that Japanese don't really get it. Consuming turtle in the name of tradition is not tradition, it is disregard for current conditions. They need to wake up and realize that certain species need time to recover so being so selfish in the name of tradition is nonsense, stupid and distasteful when the final result is nothing other than diminishing a specie when such specie belongs to all on Blue Planet not only to the Japanese. The same goes Foie Gras, different story if it is from wild birds which you can get in Spain but those are not, that is cruelty for human pleasure. I really will have what Phil is having, except

LOS ANGLES: Amazing how dry that place is. No architecture, nothing. Watch this last since you will appreciate life much more being on the other locations first.

FLORENCE: Just a relaxing Italian food and BBQ, the BBQ of your life. That chef really loves meat and you should see how he swallows that meat with passion. He got me so hungry that I had to eat right after that episode.

HONG KONG: Their food is as exotic and different as their city.

PARIS: Love, beauty and pastries and I mean pastries for breakfast, lunch, dinner and every single minute of life. That is the place to be with your lover.

BARCELONA: This is life. Art, architecture, scenic neighborhoods and humanity. Warm people with dishes to die for. This is my favorite episode.",1443916800,7,4361,4.540712468193385
7310596,3,B010F0KU9K,"Has some fun moments but gets pretty dang precious after 6 episodes.  Also very much ""how the other half lives"", with celebrity name dropping and experiences most people in the world could never dream of having.  Fine, it's your world, Phil, but not that much fun for outsiders once we've seen your ""what a cute five year old I am"" expressions through show after show.  I also didn't appreciate white person jokes coming from blacks and jews.  Yeah, I know, we're the only ones left you can joke about now.",1476230400,,506,4.588888888888889

7310598,5,B010F0KU9K,"I caught one episode on PBS. So I ordered the set.
What a riot!
The food was interesting to see across the world, but what made the show was Phil's experiences and his point of view. He was a writer on ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", but it is glaringly obvious, that show was based off his own family, as you meet them in this series.
The stars he meets and eats with are also a riot.
If you are looking for recipes, this isn't the show you are looking for.
If you are looking to be entertained and see dishes from different cultures, then hang on, pop some popcorn and laugh your way through the evening.",1474934400,,601,4.234782608695652

7310602,5,B010F0KU9K,"Really great food/travel series. One of the best I've seen. Phil just seems so unpretentious and really down to Earth in a way that makes this show so pleasant to watch. The places he goes would make the biggest homebody want to travel the world and try new foods. Watch the Paris episode, two words- Roast Chicken... So incredible! Makes me hingry just thinking about it. Really hoping for more seasons.",1464739200,,404,4.704225352112676

7310610,4,B010F0KU9K,Cultural and cooking travelogue. Phil is very entertaining and witty with a dry sense of humor,1452729600,,94,4.9375
7310611,5,B010F0KU9K,"Before I watched the series, 'I'll Have What Phil Is Having', I had no idea who Phil was. Turns out,
 Phil Rosenthal was a writer on the 'Everyone Loves Raymond' show. In fact he is a very likable fellow.
He is funny and in this show presents his knowledge of food. He introduces us to the kinds of food we
may never see again, thank goodness, in some cases.

Phil takes us to Paris,where we are introduced to the best hot chocolate and croissants, plus some
of the best looking and tasty food I have ever seen. Off to Hong Kong for the most expensive food,
and in one scene sushi that almost walks off the plate it is so fresh. To Barcelona for some of the best
food that Phil has tasted. In Florence, Italy, we have dinner at the home of a well known chef. Her
friends arrive, and it all looks delicious. At each city, Phil introduces us to people who know the area, the city, and good food. In LA we meet several of his well known friends at an area deli. Phil brings his family along on some of these travels, and that is a good time for all.

Each night Phil skypes with his parents. I am not sure what that is all about since Phil's mother was not
a great cook, according to Phil. But they all seem to love each other, and some humorous times are
ahead. Because Phil is having such a good time, so do we. Phil runs everyday so that he can eat all
the good food. I do hope the filming crew had some of this food, I know I was salivating.

7310612,1,B010F0KU9K,This is literally the worst show on TV. Rosenthal is awful. He's like your nerdy cousin caught on camera trying to play it up for his live-at-home friends. One caveat is that the directing and editing is very good. Who green-lighted this guy's role? Literally the worst show on TV now.,1451865600,,285,4.607843137254902
7310613,5,B010F0KU9K,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series!! I came across it on PBS. Each week, I looked forward to the next episode. The locations and the food looked amazing, and Phil was hilarious. You will recognize some of his friends that appear, now and then, on the show. The show is done beautifully, with some street scenes speeded up or slowed down. I hope there will be more seasons, please!!!",1451779200,,380,4.602941176470588
7310614,2,B010F0KU9K,"The video work is quite good but the host seems more tourist and less educated about the places he is visiting.  A writer for a television comedy show does not always make a suitable host for a travel / food program.  Although the photography is quite good, I find Phil just annoying to watch and listen to.  I can take this show with doses of about 15 minutes then I need to shut it off.  I would take Anthony Bourdain over this show anytime.  Not that it is trying to be the same, but at least with Bourdain seems realistic and does not do the norm.",1451779200,,551,4.160377358490566

7310617,5,B010F0KU9K,"This is quite possibly one of the best shows weve seen in a long time. Its so much fun to watch, so engaging. Its funny, emotional, immersive while still educational!

From Phils quirky humor, to the way its filmed, to the family centric way of presenting it, it feels like you're there with Phil and his friends ready to say Ill have what Phils having! The emotion of the moment is conveyed in a way thats hard to explain. Be it the delight of some amazing dish, or the joy of family and friends, this show has the ability to make you taste, smile, laugh, and even feel melancholic of places, foods, and friends youve never visited, tasted, or met. But its so real, so genuine, it will literally make you teary eyed wishing to be right there enveloped in the joy and love.

I hope PBS realizes what a gem of a show this is and keeps it running for many years to come.

I don't think Ive ever written a review for a show, but this one is just that good.",1448582400,,953,4.19672131147541

7310621,5,B010F0KU9K,"While Phil can be annoying, his adventures in eating were great fun.  After a while, you get used to Phil (COME ON......what's not to like!.....he does over use the phrase, ""Come on"").  While Phil seems overly enthusiastic about everything he eats and everywhere he goes, you must bear in mind that he is the guest of all of these restaurants.  It would be unthinkable for him to be critical of chefs who were gracious enough to allow him to film in their restaurants.  I did find his adoration of pork a bit much.  For a nice boy from Queens......really.......PORK????  Still, if Phil does another round of eating adventures, I would most certainly come along for the meals.",1447718400,,675,4.726495726495727
7310622,5,B010F0KU9K,"This is by far a cut above other food adventure programs featuring jaded chefs and the same old places seen over and over again.  Phil Rosenthal isn't a chef, but a comedy writer.  A lovable, goofy, nerdy one with a keen sense of humor.  His delight is genuine -- and often a dish or a personal encounter will bring him to tears.  While he does visit one outrageously expensive fru-fru gourmet restaurant in each episode, a great deal of street food and average places are featured.  The scenes at the end where he Skypes with his parents are absolutely priceless.  I hope to see more of this series.",1446854400,2,600,4.5092592592592595
