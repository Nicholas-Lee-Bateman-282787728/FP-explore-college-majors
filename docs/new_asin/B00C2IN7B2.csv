5688797,4,B00C2IN7B2,"As a member of the jersey Club, Modoka has always gone out of her way to help other people.  Her personality and drive draws people to like her.  But when an mysterious girl asks her to touch a unusual jet fighter, it brings back a memory of her meeting the exact same machine and before you know it she is put on the front line to defend her town and the planet against an alien invader (which she beats by suplexing it).  She is then joined by two other girls, Lan a princess from another planet, and Negumi a survivor from another planet.  Can these three unusual girls join forces and defeat the alien threat, lead by Negumi's ""brother"".

Overall it ws a good story.  While not focusing on any particular girl you get to see how they mix and work together - from Modoka's drive to help people, to Lan's fears, to Negumi's past.  The action sequences were amazing and the voice acting was spot on.  the only thing is it realy was not an MA show, while it has some brief nudity and panty shots there was nothing that really put it in an MA level (Moshiro:the color of love had more of both and that is a TV-14).  But a good story, if a second collection comes out I will look forwad to getting it.",1374192000,5,1199,4.223684210526316
5688798,4,B00C2IN7B2,"In the summer of 2012, Xebec and Production I.G. joined forces in releasing the mecha anime series ""Lagrange  ~The Flower of Rin-ne~"".

With an ongoing manga serialized in Square Enix's ""Young Gangan"" magazine in 2011, a total of 25 episodes were released on television and an OVA was released with a PS3 video game.  And now ""Lagrange  ~The Flower of Rin-ne~"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in the U.S. courtesy of Viz Media.

The Chief Director on ""Lagrange  ~The Flower of Rin-ne~"" is Tatsuo Sato (""Shigofumi - Letters from the Departed"", ""Shingu: Secret of the Stellar Wars"", ""Tokyo Tribe 2), the series is directed by Toshimasa Suzuki (""Hidamari Sketch x Hoshimittsu"", ""Dance in the Vampire Bund"", ""Polyphonica Crimson S""), music by Saeko Suzuki (""Brave King GaoGaiGar Final"", ""Vampire Princess Miyu"") and TOMISIRO, character designs by Chizuru Kobayashi (""Pandora Hearts""), Takushige Norita (""Broken Blade"") and art direction by Michie Watanabe (""Wolf's Rain"", ""Fullmetal Alchemist"", ""House of Five Leaves"").

""Lagrange ~The Flower of Rin-ne~ Set 1 covers the first season and is a series that revolves around a teenager named Madoka Kyouno.  The sole member of the Jersey Club, she is a teenager that loves to help people. May it be saving people like a lifeguard at the beach, to helping other clubs in school.  But if anything, she feels it's her duty to help those in need in her hometown of Kamogawa.  And she also has the habit of saying ""perfect"" while drawing a circle in the air.  She's also a very good athlete and tries to excel in sports.

One day after saving a child from drowning (before heading out to school), while saving the boy, someone had taken her clothes.  So, Madoka ends up wearing her gym clothes to school.  By the time she gets out, she is approached by a unusual girl named Lan, who has the habit of saying ""Woof"" (she was told that was a human greeting for ""hello"").

Lan approaches Madoka and asks her to follow her to an offshore base and asks her if she can pilot the robot aircraft known as a Vox (Ovid).

Immediately when she touches the space craft, she experiences a flashback being submerged in water but is not sure why.  Not long after, an enemy from outer space is seen piloting an Ovid attacks a base in Kamogawa and wanting to protect her city, Madoka goes after it with her Ovid.  And using her skills she learned through athletics, she surprises the enemy using a wrestling move and defeating him.

Shocked by what has occurred, Lan reveals to Madoka that she is an alien that was sent to Earth to protect Madoka and the Ovid, both which are linked together.  She introduces Madoka to the military and learns that the planet needs her help in defeating the enemy because the De Metrio are planning to destroy the planet and a group known as KISS is starting to cause problems with their Vox.  So, Madoka is the planet's only hope!

Not knowing if she has what it takes to protect the planet, she believes as a Jersey Club member, she must fulfill her obligations to protecting Kamogawa from KISS.

Meanwhile, along the way, Madoka becomes good friends with Vox pilots Lan and Muginami who become new members of the Jersey Club.

Can these three working together, protect the city of Kamogawa and its citizens?

VIDEO:

""Lagrange ~The Flower of Rin-ne~ Set 1 is presented in 1080p High Definition that combines beautiful backgrounds, wonderful mechanical designs and a colorful series that looks beautiful on Blu-ray.  While character designs are well-done, I'm really impressed by the architectural and also mecha design for this series.  Featuring CG and beautifully painted artwork, I was impressed by the style, look and feel of the entire series.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Lagrange ~The Flower of Rin-ne~ Set 1 is presented in Japanese and English DTS-HD MA 2.0.  Both are well-acted and will entertain anime viewers with either language.  If there was one thing that I wished the series had was a better lossless and immersive soundtrack.  For a series with a lot of action, it would have been great to hear a 5.1 or 7.1 soundtrack.  But the fact is that a lot of Japanese animation is made in 2.0 and Viz Media tends to not stray from that.

It's important to note that you can not change audio or subtitles with the usual button, you need to go into the menu and select English audio or Japanese audio with English subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Lagrange ~The Flower of Rin-ne~ Set 1 comes with the following special features:

  Production Art - Cycle through various production art using your remote.
  Clean Opening and Ending
  Kamogawa Drama - (15:13) A collection of short ""Lagrange ~The Flower of Rin-ne~"" animated clips about three minutes each.  Some feature the characters in super-deformed chibi format.  Stories examples include Madoka and friends treasure hunting in a pool, a video game competition amongst the KISS members and more.  In Japanese audio with English subtitles only.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Watching ""Lagrange ~The Flower of Rin-ne~"", there have been quite a few anime about the girl who pilots a mecha from ""Gunbuster"", ""Gravion"", ""Super Robot War"", ""Macross"", ""Evangelion"", the concept is nothing new.  But it's how you keep the anime series fresh and different from the other titles, that make it much more interesting and exciting.

What ""Lagrange ~The Flower of Rin-ne~"" does quite well is having a protagonist that has is not too weepy, not too weak, not too whiny and if anything, a high school student that is a bit unsure but is determined to protect others.

From her bubbly personality, Madoka wins you over with her naivety but also her determination and her ""Perfect"" hand gesture.  There is none of the overdone self-doubting or underdog nature that we typically see in a mecha anime series, this is a series about a teen who has made up her mind that her life is defending her friends, her city and doing it to the best of her ability.

Throw in other characters such as Lan, the girl from outerspace that is trying to understand her emotions and finds herself joining the Madoka bandwagon and confronting her own fears.  While Muginami is your bubbly personality, well-endowed character who actually has more of a difficult pass and also a more difficult situation because her brother, that she has always looked up to, is the enemy.

Put these three teenagers together and the result is a mix between a teenage high school anime series drama and an action-packed mecha battle session.  There is no worry of perverted guys, this is not a harem anime series nor is it an anime series that tries to copy other titles.  It's enjoyable, fascinating and quite an uplifting anime series.

The first season tends to deal with character introductions.  We get to learn more about what made Madoka so brave and the fears she faced in her past after losing her mother, we learn about Lan's fears and how Moid doesn't expect much out of her as a Vox pilot.  We also introduced about Muginami and her past and how she is loyal to her brother and how painful it is for her now to fight against him.

While rated TV Mature, that is because the opening episodes tried to incorporate a few fan service with brief nudity and panty shots.  In many ways, I'm glad that this series didn't turn out to be another ""Gravion"" of even another ""Strike Witches"", if anything, it's about three friends trying to defend the city of Kamogawa from alien enemy attack.

And a storyline with fascinating twists that will surely setup an exciting second season.

As for the Blu-ray released, Production I.G. titles tend to look beautiful when it comes to detail and art backgrounds and while a Xebec produced anime series, it's the use of characters, the added detail and mecha design that makes ""Lagrange ~The Flower of Rin-ne~"" so gorgeous on Blu-ray considering it is a TV series.

While I wish the lossless soundtrack was much more immersive, considering the amount of mecha action, the fact is a lot of anime series are 2.0 and it's up to the company if they choose to added an immersive soundtrack for the Blu-ray release.  But Viz Media has typically kept things to its original presentation and so both Japanese and English soundtracks are DTS-HD MA 2.0.  Both are well-acted, but I just wished it was a title that would have featured immersive lossless audio and given a 5.1 or 7.2 treatment.

Overall, ""Lagrange ~The Flower of Rin-ne~"" has turned out to be an awesome, exciting mecha series that is a lot of fun and features very cool characters.

While the series may not be as deep as other mecha series, it does try to keep a good balance of humor, drama and action and so far it's working!

If you are looking for an upbeat mecha anime series on Blu-ray, definitely give ""Lagrange ~The Flower of Rin-ne~"" a chance!  Recommended!",1372896000,3,8807,4.766336633663366
5688799,5,B00C2IN7B2,i got to say that this anime is really good i think everybody should get it. It make you sad and it makes you laugh cause i did throughout this anime i hope set 2 comes out soon :D,1372377600,,180,3.641025641025641
5688800,5,B00C2IN7B2,"This is a heart warming series for everyone, even if you don't like mecha shows.
The focus of the series is about building a relationship between the main characters, even if they are in their mecha the show stays true to this and focuses on the pilots interactions, you won't find random battle footage here.

However, this release has one serious flaw, the Blu-ray version for some reason is TELECLINED!
what that means is the video will look interlaced like watching a DVD, even if you have an HD flat panel TV.

The good news is the show includes all 12 episodes of the first season AND all 6 mini specials from the japanese DVDs!

I personally do not like down-scaled crap DVDs when the original show aired in HD in Japan. Sentai Films is notorious for doing this like selling us A-channel all butchered up at half resolution with all the amazingly good specials missing. However, Viz is at least trying and and the show sells for a great price, I am very pleased with this purchase even with such a huge flaw in quality. For me, I like to think of it as the show's charm point. It is not the most popular series but it is cute in it's own way, just like Madoka's 'Maru!' and Lan's 'Wan!' paw, it is the character's charm point and bright, optimistic and cheery disposition that makes this show a real winner.

If you collect anime, this is a must buy.",1371340800,10,1357,4.416

8576533,3,B00C2IN7B2,"People have correctly been criticizing the video quality on this Blu-ray, but for the wrong reasons. Yes, this title is interlaced 1080i but that is fine. In fact, this show should be encoded at 1080i because parts of the English credits text animate at 60 frames per second, mainly the fancy title logo. The animation itself appears to be mastered at 24 frames per second with few to no exceptions. If your player is bad at deinterlacing, like many Blu-ray players are, then you will get occasional combed images, but this is not the fault of the disc.

The real problem with the video quality is heavy MPEG compression artifacts similar to what is seen on an average DVD. I believe this title uses the old MPEG2 compression standard, not the MPEG4/AVC of nearly all Blu-ray anime. The show also appears to be encoded at constant bitrate instead of variable bitrate. I didn't check the actual bitrate though, so I don't know if the artifacts are due to a low bitrate, or an inferior MPEG2 standard. The artifacts are on everything, including the overlayed English credits text, and disc extras.

Lagrange Set 2 was encoded at 1080p and features even worse video quality, thanks to whining and unknowledgeable anime fans. It likewise is MPEG2 encoded with equally heavy artifacts. There's no more combing on the animation, but instead the opening and ending credits are jerky, or comb.

Despite these problems I'm giving this release a decent rating because they included most of the important extras, minus the OVA. The end cards are present. There is a slight RGB fishbowl effect with the video quality but that is part of the original animation and may have been deliberate.

The show itself is okay. Actually watching it is a bit like torture due to the story. But I just bought this show because I like to look at the green girl and the blue girl. Their pilot clothes are good and they also wear swimsuits a lot.",1472601600,,1917,4.713432835820895

8576536,4,B00C2IN7B2,"It's a favorite cartoon film, so I order to confirm how to be translated into English. When Japanese sound is chosen, English subtitles are inserted compulsorily, but when there are no subtitles, you influence a sales of a Japanese board, so (Overwhelming advantage occurs to the North American board by which one is packaged by all 12 accounts.) this will be helped measure. But, that the North American user buys it, there has been hardly a trouble because the picture privilege filmed by a domestic board is also filmed also image quality is also the quality which has no troubles. But, while a stage in GIRLS und PANZER and Oarai are also success now after theater edition opening to the public, it's regrettable that a Japanese fan wasn't watched mostly in Kamogawa which is a stage in LAGRANGE, either.",1455840000,,808,4.820143884892087

8576538,5,B00C2IN7B2,"What happens when you combine a mecha anime series (like Macross or Rahxephon) with a high school anime? You get Lagrange: The Flower of Rin-ne, but is it really worth watching? There have been many mecha or giant robot anime over the years, but they do seem to be in a decline in the past few years in favor for high school anime that star young girls. This anime combines both elements, and is a very nice story. At the time of this anime review, I have only seen the first half of the anime, which comprises the 12 episodes included on this collection. This half of the anime does wrap up things rather nicely, but you just know that there is supposed to be more because there a lot of plot points that have not been explored yet.

Originally, was not really sure about this anime, and I delayed watching it even after buying the collection, but when I did, I was pleasantly surprised that the series had fun, enjoyable characters, and I watched the whole collection in one day. The story is about a girl named Madoka Kyouno, who is a member of her school's jersey club, which is a club that helps people in need. She shortly meets a girl named Fin E Ld Si Laffinty, but due to the difficulty of saying her entire name every time, she is simply called Lan. She is actually from another planet, and requires Madoka's assistance by piloting a giant robot to fight against invading hostile forces. They also meet another girl called Muginami, and the three of them become pilots. Its not much of a spoiler to state that they become pilots because the three of them are on the cover and are seen in the opening and ending theme songs.

In most mecha anime, the pilots are usually boys like in Gundam Wing, but this anime specifically uses girls as pilots, which is a nice switch. Although it is not an entirely new concept; after all, Evangelion and Code Geass both had girl and boy pilots for their mecha. Lagrange uses the anime clich of the peppy, upbeat main character, the quiet, stoic girl, and the overly happy, busty girl. These character traits almost seem the same as the three girls from Haruhi Suzamiya, but unlike that show, this show does have more emphasis on mecha battles against aliens and events outside of high school. Like in many anime, the aliens look absolutely no different than the humans, so don't expect any alien monsters or giant insects.

It is noteworthy that this anime collection is rated MA for mature, but there is really no justification for such a rating. There is no excess blood, violence, or other adult themes to the show. It should be rated 14. There are some scenes that may be considered fan service, such as shower scenes or a scene with the girls wearing swimsuits and handling eels, which sounds kind of suggestive, but its nothing that would make this show a mature title. Also, most of the show takes place in a beach town, which is actually a nice change of pace setting for anime, which is kind of ironic because there are so many anime that take place in Japan, you may expect more beach towns since Japan is comprised of many small islands, but that is not normally the case. Overall, I do like the setting of this series.

This anime collection does include the first 12 episodes, and has no trailers expect for the advertisement for Neon Alley at the beginning of each disc. There is an art gallery included on the second disc, as well as the OVA collection. The OVAs are about 15 minutes in total, and are quite amusing, but are only subtitled in English, not dubbed in English, if you care. The English cast is actually pretty good with people like Johhny Yong Bosch (Echigo from Bleach) and Vic Mignogna (Edward Elric from FMA.) The main character, Madoka, is voiced by a relatively newer anime voice actor, Kira Buckland, who delivers a good performance for Madoka. At this time, I am looking forward to the second half of the series, and hope that it continues to be enjoyable.",1385683200,5,3937,4.525280898876405
