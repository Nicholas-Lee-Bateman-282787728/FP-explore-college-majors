8248245,4,B0012YO1LM,"This is a great package for fans of the mexiluchahero movie genre. You get a good cross-section of films here that team up any number of luchadors as they fight for truth,justice and the Mexican way. Best of all Superzan doesn't appear in any of these movies. Unfortunately a luchador called the Blue Angel does show up in El Robo De Las Momias De Guanajuata,and he's about as helpful as Aquaman in the Sahara. The two best films on this 3-disc set are Misterio en Las Bermudas(the final teaming of Santo,Blue Demon and Mil Mascaras)and Vuelven Los Campeones Justicieros(the second chapter in the Champions of Justice trilogy).Except for El Hijo De Alma Grande all of the movies here feature Mil Mascaras,the luchador who best epitomizes the similarities between pro wrestling and comic book super heroes. I usually prefer the movies from this genre where the hero is a lone wolf adventurer,but these films are a lot of fun and I recommend them.",1268179200,4,945,4.839506172839506
