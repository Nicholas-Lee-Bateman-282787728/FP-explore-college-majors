4693546,3,B005GRF318,"I purchased this collection for Wes Craven's three ""Dracula"" movies---I don't care much for the fourth movie (""They""). I already own the DVDs for each of the ""Dracula"" movies, so my primary purpose for buying the blu-ray was to obtain a high-definition (HD) picture. I expected the audio to be at least as good on the blu-ray as the DVDs. Sadly, I was mistaken.

All four movies include 5.1-channel Dolby Digital surround sound on their respective DVDs. Unbelievably, the first two ""Dracula"" movies have only 2-channel stereo sound on the blu-ray. Very disappointing!!! You won't hear anything out of your rear surround speakers, making the sound field flat compared to the full 5.1-channel versions on the DVDs.

And it gets worse from there: All four movies (a total of 6 hours and 5 minutes) are crammed onto a single blu-ray disc (it must be a dual-layer disc). So there are NO extras. The commentary tracks, features, extended and deleted scenes, auditions, etc., that are present on the DVDs are absent from the blu-ray.

You'll have to decide if the HD picture is worth the downgrade in sound on the first two movies. Personally, I'm still glad I purchased the blu-ray. The picture is much better on the blu-ray than the DVDs (but you'll need a full 1080 HDTV/monitor to appreciate it). And, while the first two movies have only 2-channel stereo sound, at least their tracks sound clean.

Here's a list of the movies and their tech specs for the blu-ray versions. Note that the blu-ray package lists the third ""Dracula"" movie as having only 2-channel sound like the first two but it actually has 5.1-channel sound like the fourth movie. You can verify this with your ears and with the information displayed by your blu-ray player when the third movie is played.

1 - Dracula 2000 - 1080i 16x9 (1.78:1) - 2-channel stereo sound - 1 hr 39 min
2 - Dracula II: Ascension - 1080i 16x9 (1.78:1) - 2-channel stereo sound - 1 hr 25 min
3 - Dracula III: Legacy - 1080p 16x9 (1.78:1) - 5.1-channel surround sound - 1 hr 31 min
4 - They - 1080p 16x9 (1.78:1) - 5.1 channel surround sound - 1 hr 30 min

Each movie has only one English audio track (no other language tracks are provided). And none of the four movies have subtitles. They are about as ""bare bones"" as you can get.",1323216000,29,2274,4.602469135802469
4693547,3,B005GRF318,"Haven't watched them yet, so can't comment on the quality...but Target did have it for $9.99.  I wasn't sure if I should get it because usually these Echo Bridge 4 packs are sold at Walmart or K-Mart for $5.00.  Either way, a good deal for 4 decent movies.",1315699200,,256,4.3125

4693550,3,B005GRF318,Not a great set of movies but good for the price. Always looking for something for Halloween to entertain at a party. Love Wes Craven but these could have been made better. A good addition to a collection.,1375660800,,205,4.421052631578948
4693551,3,B005GRF318,"Dracula 2000 has a very novel take on Dracula's history and is the high point of this Blu-ray. Great action, an interesting story and a surprisingly appropriate ending. Although the very last scene in this movie is disregarded in the sequels, the Dracula movies here are all related. Dracula III isn't bad. If you are going to watch it, I'd suggest watching the very beginning of Dracula II, but don't go too far into it - it's not worth the time.

I went with the Blu-ray rather than the DVD since the Blu-ray also included a fourth feature, one I hadn't seen before. The blurb sounded good, but unfortunately I struggled to get a whole half hour into They before giving up.

Recommended to those who like vampires with some bite, rather than sparkles.",1370044800,,753,4.611940298507463

4693554,4,B005GRF318,"A very good selection for a single disc collection. Transfer for part 1 of Dracula 2000 is pristine for a single disc release ; part 2 is OK but a bit murky in several sequences ; part 3 is excellent . The story line of all all three parts is revealing and is a unique insight into the origin of Dracula throughout history especially the linkage to Judas Iscariot and the three principal actors who portrayed Dracula were well chosen and fitted their parts admirably. .See part 1 and you will understand my tag line !!  The last selection ""They"" is a good choice to complete  this selection and the transfer is also excellent. This disc is highly recommended .",1362960000,,660,4.491666666666666
4693555,5,B005GRF318,"Wes's movies are nothing if not unique and his take on Dracula is daring and done with his usual panache and within his oeuvre these three movies provide the chills and sly off kilter humor he seems to toss off in horror films with abandon.  He hires excellent actors and gives them much meat to eat...which keeps them from chewing up the scenery and focused on chilling your spine instead.  I liked the transfers (sound could be optimized but isn't bad) and they look great in blu-ray.  I haven't seen They yet. (Don't know how it slipped passed me the first time around)  Saving it for a dark and stormy night.  But the three Dracula films in one gathering is worth the purchase even without the fourth movie, tho I'm glad to get it.  I'm glad to get anything that satisfies my Craven Craving.",1360281600,2,795,4.486111111111111
4693556,2,B005GRF318,Wes Craven didn't DIRECT any of these.  The presentation is decent but I think the set is misrepresented just to get sales off Craven's name.,1340150400,3,141,4.64
4693557,4,B005GRF318,"this is my review for the Echo Bridge Wes Craven 4 Film Series (Dracula/Dracula II/Dracula III-Legacy/They) on blu-ray...my Buena Vista  DVD's of  these movies are in 2.35:1 aspect ratio, however, are released in 1.78:1 aspect ratio on this blu-ray...I was initially upset about the aspect change thinking I was going to get badly cropped video to fill my 16X9, but after some research I found the Echo Bridge blu-ray release is in open matte, with most shots showing considerably more video at the top and bottom and very little to nothing lost on the sides...I wasn't very interested in the movie They, however, it came in the set by default...I own it on DVD as well...it is released on this blu-ray in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio, same aspect ratio as my DVD...video across the board for the four movies is  good...my only complaint would be at the beginning of Dracula III- Legacy..it is a bit grainy, however, it goes away...having watched them now I feel that I am actually seeing more (due to the open matte) even though it may not be the aspect ratio the director intended...another downside is that the blu-ray only has the movies and no extras at all...to enjoy the extras I will have to keep all of my Buena Vista  DVD's....for a quick visual explanation of open matte see... [...] ...for some great  screen captures for comparison of 2.35:1/1.78:1 (from a reviewer of the Echo Bridge vs. Buena Vista DVD, Dracula 2000) see...[...] ...if you look at the technical information at Amazon it shows the aspect ratio of this blu-ray release as 1.33:1 which is, of course, incorrect...all in all a great deal for your money",1323648000,2,1625,4.7686832740213525
