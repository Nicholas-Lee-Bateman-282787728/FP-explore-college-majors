I wish the DVD had included a description to let me know it was just singing and dancing.  [...].",1236556800,6,275,4.132075471698113

3481158,5,B001B3LISS,This item is very difficult to find. Luckily for my granddaughter I was able to find it in time for Christmas! Hi-5 is very popular among the toddler set. Songs are catchy and music is lively. Even gets me moving with the beats and my granddaughter just loves it. We repeat it over and over again. May have to purchase another if the first wears out. Great sounds for all!,1229731200,2,372,4.328571428571428

It's a no go at least for us!!!",1298505600,,290,4.105263157894737
