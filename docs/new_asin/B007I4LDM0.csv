What was best about this movie is the dialogues, they are well-written and different from the sweet-sounding scenes typical of a Karan Johar or YashRaj film, it's a young, hip film with a very real message skillfully woven in by the director.  It is a bit more expensive than other films out there, but imho well worth the investment.  Would seriously give it four stars.  If you're a Dia Mirza fan, it is her last work as a performer but even if you aren't she deserves a look.  LBZ impressed Trina after a long span of watching just ok movies.",1358035200,,677,4.384
