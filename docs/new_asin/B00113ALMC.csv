3059193,5,B00113ALMC,"Such a cutey that Chrysanthemum, smart, fragile and loving... Wonderful story, as real as it can be. It teaches your child how to deal with somehow mean kids and encourages your child to have a self confidence.  Rest of the stories are as wonderful as hers... It is nice and very educational. I highly recommend it.

8240151,5,B00113ALMC,My 4-year-old loves this.  It's her favorite.  Great for children who love books and are at a non-reading age.,1488326400,,110,4.7368421052631575
8240152,5,B00113ALMC,"I am a first grade teacher, and I always start my school year off with Kevin Henkes and his ""much loved"" stories.  Chrysanthemum is one of my very favorites, and the animation in this Scholastic video is incredible.  A parent's worst nightmare is sending a child off to school to be teased and belittled by others.  My students can relate to the lovable character, Chrysanthemum, and I can relate to her parents who patiently remind her that she is ""absolutely perfect,"" and to Miss Twinkle, a teacher, who reminds every child that he/she is unique and one of a kind.  The world needs more Chrysanthemums and more Miss Twinkles, and Scholastic has a magical way of making Kevin Henkes' stories come alive.  Not to mention, who doesn't love the voices of Meryl Streep and Sarah Jessica Parker?  Love, Love, Love the stories on this video.",1443657600,,837,4.7379310344827585

8240154,5,B00113ALMC,I am a huge fan of Kevin Henkes books. This DVD reads several of his books to the viewer and then reads several that are not written by Mr Henkes. It is fun and entertaining for children and adults! I highly recommend it. Thank you,1403222400,,231,4.155555555555556
8240155,4,B00113ALMC,I purchased this DVD to replace the VHS in our school library. Our budget gets cut more and more each year and we do not have the money to replace VHS or DVD's that break. This story is a classic and every library should have it in their collection.,1403049600,,249,4.1020408163265305
8240156,5,B00113ALMC,"My granddaughter loves it.  It has become her favorite DVD.  She has a flower name herself, so identifies with Chrysanthemum.",1373328000,,125,5.2
8240157,5,B00113ALMC,"This was a Christmas gift for my three-year-old grandson; however, and book with Chrysanthemum always has great pictures and is always entertaining!",1357084800,,148,5.7727272727272725

8240159,5,B00113ALMC,A great DVD to watch with your students after finishing a Unit on Kevin Henkes. The students had the opportunity to enjoy reading the book as well as watching the DVD which was even more exciting to see.,1319932800,,203,4.368421052631579
