This documentary does an excellent job of telling a story of something that we still try to understand, one of the most visited locales in the world : The sacred shrine and waters of Lordes, France.

An illiterate peasent girl, Bernadette Soubirous, one day saw something that we still cannot explain.  She sat down before the grotto to take off her shoes before wading across a shallow stream before her to gather firewood with her two sisters.  While they went ahead, she heard a strange noise behind her, turned around, and saw something there.  It was a woman dressed in a white veil, a blue girdle and had two golden roses at her feet.  She returned the next day in the hopes of seeing this again, and sure enough she did.  She called the woman that she saw ""aquero"", a local slang term for ""that one"".  When her parish priest asked her to ask the woman who she was, Bernadette reported that this woman told her that she was The Immaculate Conception a.k.a. The Virgin Mary.  At her ninth vision of this woman, who no one could see but her, Bernadette began digging around the mud in the grotto.  She rubbed mud of her face, tried to drink it like water, and even ate the plants around her in a trance.  The crowd laughed at her, but a few hours later, water began to flow through the holes that she had dug with her hands.  Hence it became the great healing spring still visited to this day by millions all over the world.

Why this deserves 5 stars is because it addresses all aspects of those mysterious goings on in the grotto.  Do these waters possess a healing power?  Many have bathed in these waters and seemed to spontaneously heal from whatever was ailing them.  Skeptics have said it is just the power of suggestion.  It also touches on further miracles and sightings of Our Lady at Fatima and Mejagorie in the former Yugoslavia.  What do we believe?  There are no explinations, truly.  But perhaps there are things that science cannot explain and faith has to take over.",1339977600,,2105,4.475065616797901
8101643,5,B000CS463W,"Good insight into The Waters of Lourdes but sadly only two supporters of it are in it and the rest are all skeptics or the egghead crowd always wanting proof of a God that has Always Existed and His loving Ever Blessed Mother. You hear these keywords ""Reason"",""Science"",etcera to cover up the intolerance they have towards The Church,which as it has been shown in this ""documentary""actually had skeptics herself who as always work with science and reason to validate miracles and in itself to prove The Church is Right.",1318809600,2,519,4.842696629213483
8101644,3,B000CS463W,"In this documentary, one learns how Lourdes became a pilgrimage site, who discovered it, and how that person died.  The work tries to be complete in saying that the ancient Egyptians had such visions and that there were Marianic visions in Portugal and Yugoslavia after the French event.

This work only had one female interviewee and many more male ones.  The fake French accents during readings may irritate some purists.  This work had a few cheesy reenactments, but classic paintings and modern video recordings are the primary visuals here.

I was reminded of the ""Alien"" series in watching this.  In those classic films, there are always people who want to wipe out the alien and others who want to preserve and worship it.  Here, there are vision believers and skeptics.  Recently in Chicago, a person said an image from dripping water in a tunnel was Mary.  People kept visiting it until one person spray-painted the image, protesting that it was sacrilegious.

Supposedly, Madonna's daughter's name has two syllables where the ""d"" is not pronounced, in the Spanish fashion.  Here, they use the French pronunciation in which there is one syllable and you do hear the ""d"".",1181865600,3,1179,4.964285714285714
