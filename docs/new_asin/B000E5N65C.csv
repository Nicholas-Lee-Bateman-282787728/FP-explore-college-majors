2495490,4,B000E5N65C,"You have to understand the concept of the alter ego to understand the movie. The name Don/Dawn brought this to light. This was a fairly decent movie to watch, but would be confusing to anyone who has never studied Freud or Psychology. I enjoyed the depth.",1410566400,2,255,4.565217391304348
2495491,3,B000E5N65C,"What I find to most disturbing about this movie...every night she washes her face, brushes her teeth and THEN has a glass of orange juice. Horrifying.

Aside from that - good audio, good video, decent acting, and tolerable story line. Acceptable viewing fare for a rainy Sunday afternoon, if you're bored.",1408838400,6,305,4.980392156862745
2495492,5,B000E5N65C,"Kelly Overton stars as a medical student assigned to a homicidal patient in a psychiatric hospital. Her professor has given her six weeks to get through to him, or she might not become a doctor. The patient's name is Don Wake, and at first he is non-verbal, so she secretly lowers his medication dosage. Unsurprisingly, Don goes berserk, but not before giving the student an ominous warning. Odd things begin happening, and she starts seeing a shadowy figure that seems to be following her. She also encounters several bizarre people in her life. Is Don simply paranoid / delusional, or is something paranormal going on? What is the real meaning of Don's conspiratorial ranting, and just who is Malachi? Is the young student losing her mind, or has her world really turned into a living nightmare? BREAKING DAWN is a superior psychological thriller that had me guessing right up to the final act. Highly recommended...",1391472000,12,918,4.929032258064516
2495493,5,B000E5N65C,"This was a great psychological thriller and the price was cheaper than renting, all together it was $3 with shipping and handling. Added bonus~Angelina Jolie's brother (I didn't even know she had a brother) is the actor in this movie.",1334448000,,234,4.875

2495495,2,B000E5N65C,"For most of this movie, I thought it was quite an interesting situation and it was quite captivating.  Then, suddenly, it started an ending that left both my wife and me utterly confused and feeling we'd wasted our time watching the film. It seems that the movie makers couldn't tell the difference between reality and hallucinations any more than the apparent patients could.",1180310400,4,376,4.968253968253968
2495496,4,B000E5N65C,"So..I had some time to kill while doing my laundry and saw this movie was on my ONDEMAND.  I decided to take a chance and watch it.  I was surprised to be completely entertained through the whole film.  There are some points where the acting is a bit overdone and the story does have a few ways it could be improved...but... how many big budget, over advertised, movies have crappy acting and yet make a lot of money just because they are either A) a sequel to a famous franchise (how many Jason movies do we need?) or B)have big name actors.  This film is pretty darn good.  I believe more movie makers should quit trying to make the next big, arty, trend setting, overly thought out movies and just do what films should REALLY be...a couple of hours of decent entertainment.  I beleieve this movie accomplishes just that.",1168732800,6,823,4.489932885906041
2495497,2,B000E5N65C,"Breaking Dawn started as a halfway decent flick, but then quickly broke down. Kelly Overton as Dawn Wake wasn't very believable, and her overacting and constant crying became annoying after 1 hour in.

Joe Morton as Professor Simon gets another nod as an over actor with his overblown performance. Really, that was the the key for my annoyance with the film: it was over dramatic and overacted, especially the latter.

It seemed that both Joe Morton and Kelly Overton had only one speed. I could almost sense the director screaming ""More passion! More Passion!"" It didn't work for me.

There were some good points in the film. James Haven as Don Wake was absolutely brilliant, and the film is worth watching for his performance alone. Rarely do I say that about such a pointless and dull film, but here James Haven commands your attention. His acting subtle, gripping, and able to change speeds on a dime. It was everything the other actors in the film lacked. Hank Harris was interesting as Ted.

All in all the film was pointless. The story ends in a very unexpected way, but feels like something you've seen twenty times before. You do find yourself caring about Don and Dawn Wake, but after repeated blows with bad story twists, endless crying (almost screams: look, I am a REAL ACTRESS - I CAN CRY!!!), Joe Morton's hyper-spiels, and bad acting, I felt like I had 2 hours taken from me. I don't feel that often about a film, but I felt it here.

This movie is worth renting it you can get it cheap, simply for James Haven's performance. Nothing else much to see though.

Total Score (out of 100) = 34

2495498,4,B000E5N65C,"True suspense and mystery throughout.  I didn't know what to expect from this movie, and assumed it would be a bit boring, but I was wrong.  I was on the edge of my seat most of the movie.  It has an unexpected ending with many twists and turns.  Definitely worth watching.",1146960000,5,273,4.294117647058823
2495529,2,B000E5N65C,"The premise is not new, in my personal opinion, the best is of the bunch is ""Shutter Island"",  but this movie was enjoyable, like a cotton candy version of the same concept.  Performances were Lifetime network worthy but the eyes of the ""patient"" are quite haunting.

2495613,2,B000E5N65C,"Within the first 15 minutes I figured out what the whole overused predictable ending of the movie was gonna be. Talk about originality. Lol
By the way, I must say that James Haven was perfectly cast for the role of the crazy patient because not only does he look crazy but apparently he really is. This is the guy who made out with his equally creepy sister Angelina Jolie.. ewwww ..What a couple of wackos..

2495616,4,B000E5N65C,"Overall, it is very difficult for a film to get a good rating.  It has so much with which it must compete.  The best of the best cannot be compared to such a film.

I do not consider this to be an excellent film.  However, I do think the actors in this film were exceptional from young to old, which pulled it off as a legitimate flick.

There is one weak point, which is the transition, which could have been done better, but budgets are what they are.  I do not know if the director or producer had the budget to make themselves look good.

The actors, however, did a fantastic job, and that could be, in part, the impact of the director.

I hate the five star system because there are so many different types of film.  I have to compare this to movies on the whole to grade it.  It is one of the few I would give four stars in this class of film because it is excellent, but by the confinement of its budget, it is limited.",1455408000,,926,4.066298342541437

The acting was great the script was complex and engaging.
This was a tough project to pull off but I think it was done with great skill.
Good quality filmmaking  Don was very good as was Dawn etc.
