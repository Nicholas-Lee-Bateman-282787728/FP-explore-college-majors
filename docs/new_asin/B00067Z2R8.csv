2174373,5,B00067Z2R8,"Although I really enjoy dance workouts, I was a little wary of this one, as I had heard that instructor MaDonna Grimes didn't cue very well and that there was a lot of ""take-it-from-the-top"" movements, which I dislike.  So, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I LOVED this video!  The workout basically breaks down into 3 segments:  warm-up, dance routine, and cool-down (these are not chaptered on the DVD).  The 10-minute warm-up gets right into some basic dance steps such as the merengue, getting your heart rate up right away.  MaDonna sometimes fails to fully explain the movements, but my minimal experience with just a few prior dance videos allowed me to follow along with no problems.  There are a few small jumps included in this segment, but they don't appear until about 5 minutes into it, when you're already well warmed up; some basic stretches conclude this section.

During the 12-minute dance routine section, MaDonna introduces new moves one at a time, gradually building up to a complete dance routine.  When teaching the moves, she did something I'd never seen before that I really liked:  instead of teaching one segment with 3 different moves, a second segment with 3 different moves, and then stringing the two segments together (I always find it difficult to remember the first segment), she'll teach 3 moves and then introduce 2 new ones, but she combines the last move from the first 3 with the 2 new ones (I hope this makes sense!).  This method makes it very easy to remember the order of the moves, as you're constantly combining the older moves that you've already learned with the new moves.  Even more importantly, the moves are FUN--mambos, hops, hip swings, etc.--and the time just flew by!

The workout ends with a brief (4-minute) cool-down.  I liked the neck stretches that were included here, although some people might have to be careful with these.  The DVD also includes a 10-minute bonus workout for the lower body:  MaDonna leads you through 4 different types of squats, performing several sets of each, and she ends with some brief standing and floor abs work.  An additional DVD feature is a music-only workout option.  Some people might complain that this workout is too short (about 26 minutes overall), but MaDonna packs a lot of both exertion and fun into that time period, making this video perfect for anyone who wants to get in some quick, intense, yet extremely enjoybable cardio work.  Highly recommended!",1122249600,709,2464,4.882211538461538
2174374,4,B00067Z2R8,"The dance routine on this DVD is nice, but limited, very few combinations are taught, The DVD cover says ""Leaves you sweating for more!"" It made me laugh because the program is so limited it looks like a trailer. But I enjoyed it anyway! I liked the moves and I loved the performance, it is worth buying the DVd even if you end up dissatisfied with the routine they teach.",1111968000,6,372,4.328571428571428
2174375,3,B00067Z2R8,"I have many dancing DVDs I love & been doing for about 2 years now, but I still need a breakdown. She incorporates cute, aerobic movements to increase heart rate, but not something you'd want to be caught dead on the dance floor. She start a new movement does it only 2-3x in normal speed, no slowing down or break-down, then moves on the next, to build a routine.
They say you can rewind if you can't get it. I'd be very frustrated by having to keep stopping, grab the remote & rewind to right spot over & over & in slow-mo.... What's wrong with teaching it 1/2 times several times? Once you have mastered the steps, you can just do it normal while the dancers go slow.
I like DVDs more where you stick to it more then 1-2x to really get a feel for it before turning it into a whole routine. The music had a nice beat, but it was about one step from elevator music. She does have a nice, upbeat, friendly personality & talks to the other dancer which is nice.
The entire workout is ONLY 28 minutes long INCLUDING the warm up & cool down.
The bonus workout w/Madonna is 2 min of warm up with basic 80s/90s aerobics fast-paced arm & high kick leg movements, then 3 min of a $*#!load of squats, then 1.5 min of basic plies, then 1 min of standing toning abs/leg pose, then on the floor for 1 min for basic ab crunches w/legs in air, then 3 stretches for legs & spine. She does it in your basic gym aerobics instructor, no dance or flair.
The DVD also has a ""performance"" after the cool down of her & the 3 girls & 2 guys dancing in a modern dance & most had moves that looked learned in dance school & some break dancing. There's trailers for her other video & the Havana one & a belly dancing one.
Madonna Grimes had made previous simple stage, very complex dance steps videos which she breaks down into 8-count & teaches in 1/2 time at first & assumed this would be broken down as well.

2174376,5,B00067Z2R8,"I love this workout! Since moving out of the city, I have been unable to find a gym that offers a good variety of group aerobic classes, so although I use a gym for weight training - I had to find another way to get my cardio in. I did a lot of searching in stores and online and came upon this DVD. I was nervous to order it, but I am glad I did. It is basically just dance moves. For the record, I trained in dance for over 20 years including studying African and Caribbean Dance. The moves in this routine really aren't as complex as those found in the African and Latin Dance forms - which is good - African Dance is difficult! The moves are simple but fun. VERY FUN! And simple enough that you can pace yourself - making it as easy or as demanding as you wish -  WHICH IS THE MARK OF A GOOD AEROBIC ROUTINE AND INSTRUCTOR!

I also love MaDonna Grimes' personality - she is so easy going and cool - I much prefer her to the typical tan and blonde buffy video instructor!

Although I rated it 5 stars - I don't like the music, it lacked oomph for me, but I never like the music in classes or DVD's so don't listen to me!

If you are looking for a fun way to workout - check this out - it will get the heart pumping and burn the fat - and routine is so much fun that time flies when you follow this!",1108080000,196,1301,3.9166666666666665

It's fun and it feels great. I understand all the folks that say it is not for beginners, but I consider myself an ""advanced beginner"" or maybe an ""intermediate"" when it comes to these types of dance workouts. I have little to no trouble learning the moves and doing them relatively well, after a couple tries. Not to say I look great doing them (I have no idea what I look like when I do it, but I like to think I don't look like a total idiot). It may not be that easy, but it's not that hard, either. It just takes some time.
Anyway, the only thing that bugs me about this - and it sort of bugs me a lot, despite having nothing to do with the actual workout - is that Madonna constantly talks down to her dancers, and accuses them of struggling with the movements.

2174465,1,B00067Z2R8,This is the most disappointing purchase I've made on amazon. Bought the DVD and had it sent to me in Africa. I got the DVD and in excitement  opened it immediately to use it. But it doesn't work. Apparently it's locked for use only in the US/US dvd players. So disappointed,1433894400,,273,4.352941176470588
2174466,2,B00067Z2R8,This is not for beginners.  The pace was too fast and the dance moves were not introduced slowly.  Music was too fast for a beginner to learn the moves.  I tried the tape every day for a week and found it to be a waste of time and my money.,1433289600,,240,3.76

I took dance as a kid, am well coordinated and have done aerobics in the past. I am, however very out of shape. I just did the video for the first time and loved it! he moves are relatively simple if you have any sort of dance/aerobic experience. Some moves were a little difficult for me since my coordination isn't as great as it used to be and I don't have much space in my living room. I've never done Zumba, so I didn't expect it to be like that, what I expected is exactly what is presented. I got a good workout. My heart rate was elevated and I felt good. It's short, which is great for me since I can't go for very long yet. I imagine that I'll be using this quite often!
MaDonna Grimes was fun and I liked the interactions with the backup dancers.

you didn't know what a CHEESEBURGER was before you ate it either; you were a ""Beginner"" !!
She says ""now letz MAMBO""  ok.  thatz a CUE to open your eyes & see what she is doing.
oh, yes.  of course.  THAT step must be the MAMBO.
now, you know what a MAMBO is !

Madonna DOES indeed show you how to do each step.  OPEN YOUR EYES !!
I am Not coordinated & it took me a few times but I follow along.
I've taken ONE dance class in my life.
I can't keep up.  but I did with this video.

and if I missed a step, she goes slow enough when I can fall back in line.

granted, it is only 20 minutes or so.  however, that is why I bought it.  I walk 30 minutes on the treadmill then
I do this workout.  the music is ""latin' which should make you want to move your hips.
loosen up.  shimmy.....
Madonna speaks eloquently and I can understand her.  I've tried another workout DVD & her voice got on my nerves.

this is not zumba.  itz just a nice little dance workout ~ low impact.
but the more limber you become, the more flexible you will be become.
your intensity should pick up
and you should work up more of a sweat.
it is what you make of it.

2174580,4,B00067Z2R8,"If you are a beginner and want a good introduction to Zumba/dance fitness, then this is a good place to start. She teaches you a lot of moves and stretches that will come up in many other workouts. Some people complained that she went too fast, but I was able to keep up just fine, although I do have some experience doing Zumba just by watching YouTube videos. Overall it will get your heart going and will get you sweating a bit, but won't exhaust you (unless you've never ever exercised). At first it is a little confusing, but during the warm-up she gives you an introduction to several of the moves you will see in the workout which helps later on. After you do the DVD a couple times, you learn it really quickly and know what's coming next.

While that is a good thing, it's also one of the things I didn't like about it. The entire workout is 8 counts of 8 dance moves, so you're only doing one routine the entire time. After about the 10th time of doing this and I knew exactly what was coming, I also knew exactly what she was going to say and when the backup dancers were going to laugh. It just got a little stale for me.

That being said, Madonna is a good motivator, she is high energy and laughs a lot which keeps everything positive. The whole DVD is about 45-50 minutes, 10 for warm-up, 25-30 for workout, 5-10 for cool down, but it doesn't seem that long at all, the time goes fairly quickly because it's broken up into 3 segments like that. I may have lost a few pounds while doing this (I tried to do it every day for a few weeks but eventually fell out of it, then would start doing it again, etc) but I didn't see anything significant. If you are a beginner, I would suggest changing your diet to healthier foods and most importantly smaller portions, and keep your abdominal muscles tight while you do this routine. That's something I didn't learn until after I bought another workout set, but that supposedly makes a big difference. I will probably continue to do this DVD on my ""day off"" from my other workout program, but after you get used to this and this workout doesn't feel like it's doing anything for you, it's time to up the ante and do something more intense so your body doesn't plateau. MaDonna has plenty of other workout DVDs if you like her, other than that I suggest moving on to Hip Hop Abs after this.",1397001600,,2344,4.312925170068027

2174586,4,B00067Z2R8,"Why I like it:
So first of all, MaDonna Grimes is so darned likable, it's hard not to have fun. I'm not a strong dancer, so I get a little lost with the moves, but she does do a pretty good job of explaining them and leading you through. Plus, she's having fun, they're having fun, and it's easy to get caught up in it.

The Workout:
The workout is not terribly intense (it does raise my heart rate a bit, but not anything like P90X or a Zumba class), but it is fun and I use it for break when I'm bored with my other more intense workouts.

I recommend it for people who are beginners in the whole dance-workout scene.",1395619200,3,619,4.065573770491803

2174648,3,B00067Z2R8,I think this dvd is just ok. I've been working out now for about 3 years but I mostly do aerobics and strength training. I wanted something more fun since doing the same repetitive routine gets boring. I decided to give this dvd a try especially since I've never did a dance dvd before. Well I must say this dvd is not one of my favorite. I've done it maybe 4 or 5 times and its's just collecting dust now. It's really not as fun as it looks and to top it off you don't even break out that much of a sweat. I'm still shopping around for something more fun and that will really help me break out a good sweat. If you would like to try this dvd for yourself go ahead but i'm pretty sure there are better beginner dance videos out there on the market.,1373328000,,748,4.026845637583893

The instructor is clear but does not go into much detail, sometimes failing to describe what she is actually doing with traveling steps for example,and rarely specifying which arm goes up at the time of which leg, etc. The video is also skimpy --only about 30 minutes of content.  However, I do get an enjoyable work out from it, but plan to look for higher quality stuff. It was a good start in terms of dance videos for me.",1373241600,,600,4.759615384615385

More intermediate. I was expecting there to be more then one workout and a dance demonstration on the video for the price. Jillian Michaels videos, and Rodney Yee's work out varieties are much better overall and don't make you feel like you were headbanging last night. Even Shiva Rae has a work out selection that allows the user to choose the warm up/work out/cool down and each one flows into the other. For the price I paid I had much higher expectations. She is a great instructor, and the video is culturally diverse, but I was hoping for more work outs and longer, then I paid for. I would hesitate to buy this video if you want to add a variety to your collection, it'd probably be better to just go to a Nia class.",1370217600,,1000,4.381720430107527

It does the job in 10 minutes - that walking & eliptical could not do in 30 minutes.
Something about MaDonna and her smile are so appealing, makes you want to workout & do it right to please her.  Sounds crazy, I know.

It would have been nice to have at least one more routine. So, whenever I do this DVD, I always follow it up with another routine to make sure I get a full hour's worth of cardio/toning in.

2174728,1,B00067Z2R8,This was the worse purchase ever. The quality of the moves are bad and the instructor seems annoying. You can see her cast in the background messing up the moves as she is demonstrating them. It was not worth the money or the time.,1359244800,,231,4.2727272727272725

2174741,1,B00067Z2R8,this dvd appeared to be outdated. the instructor doesn't explain the dance moves well and goes too fast. she doesn't give you the chance to pick up the moves before she switches the next one and goes to the routine. you spend more energy being confused and stumbling over yourself than actually dancing.,1356739200,,303,4.735849056603773
2174742,5,B00067Z2R8,I use this whenever I can't make it to Curves to exercise. Love the beat and the dance steps are easy but still challenging enough that I have to work to get them right.,1356652800,,169,4.0

2174750,2,B00067Z2R8,I can't deny that MaDonna Grimes is an excellent dancer... but I am not.  I just don't have the rythum that she does so following along wasn't the easiest.  The pace and steps weren't that difficult... but the movements and motions are for those with a internal beat.  Being from the MidWest... I inadvertanley turned the AFrican Beat with Latin Heat into a country line dance... which was actually kind of fun.  I ordered this DVD because a lot of my friends were raving about Zumba and I 'thought' this was a beginners version.  I must have misread the description.  Oh well.,1354147200,,577,4.607843137254902

2174754,1,B00067Z2R8,"The music IMHO was less than engaging. Sounded a bit dated. It was one of the lesser priced Dance Fitness Discs, but probaly a good example of,""you get what you pay for"". I tossed it.",1353715200,,183,4.257142857142857
2174755,5,B00067Z2R8,"If you are familiar with Lupus you will know that our body attacks itself and often times make it impossible to get out of bed much less workout.  On good days the limbs and joints can hurt like hell.  On great days we look and act like everybody else.  My doctor calls me ""highly functional""- whatever that means. I am blessed to have a personal trainer come to my home for a ""whopping"" $40 bucks a session (how cool is that). She is spectacular because she adjusts the workout based on how the Lupus affects me that particular day. Sometimes the hips go out and other times the wrist starts acting wacky.  She adjust and we keep it moving.  This dvd does exactly that- keeps it moving!

I was able to do all the movements without straining any part of my body with this dvd session.  It was low maintenance but high impact.  I found myself sweating and felt that I was getting a good cardio workout.  Plus the movements made me feel sexy- and all that.  She started off slow with the warm up- but strong- which felt pretty good.  Then she smoothly began on the movements and a particular set.  I say ""set"" because that's what she did.  She did a group of exercises (or better yet dance moves) and we followed while still getting a cardio workout.  Then she speeds up after walking through the dance move several times.  After that she moves on to another set.  Then she combines those two sets to make the dance longer.  Then she adds another set, and so on.

By the time she stops you are doing a complete routine.  I learned the full routine after 3 sessions.  The 1st session made me feel out of rhythm and silly.  I was glad that no one was there.  I heard myself say several times --""what the hell was that"".  My lab barked as in agreement with my frustration.  However, the 2nd time was good.  I stumbled a little bit, but did pretty okay.  The 3rd set was great!.  When my trainer came over I had her go through the rountine with me as the workout for the day.

Then I used ""Barry's Bootcamp- 15 minute Belly Blaster"" for my abs.  That is also intense but manageable.  Combining those two dvd's gave me the Perfect Work Out Session.  My trainer agreed and said she would copy some of MaDonna's dance moves with her other clients.  I am so pumped now because I know this is something I can actually begin AND finish.  I buy these dvd's all excited then I get frustrated or bored and it goes in the cabinet.  This one is a keeper.

MaDonna is funny and pretty.  She looks normal and not like one of those bony synthetic exercise trainers who has the most unrealistic body.  Now I will say MaDonna is ""bodied up"" but it seems like an attainable shape (for the most part).  Heck I just want some of her abs.  Her arms are amazing and her dance team looks like normal people.  Her voice is not irritating and the steps don't confuse me and easy to learn (by the 3rd or 4th session).  I am going to take a chance and order her other more advanced dvd.  I will try it at least once.  If it is too much I will go back to my old comfort zone----this dvd.  This is a great dvd if you want something ""fun,& effective"".",1353369600,,3116,4.261986301369863

Also, there are moves that are only done on one side, but not the other, so with use I've learned to mix up the moves per side.  The reason I would continue using this disc is that it is a quick way to get your heart up and it's fun to see the interactions with the dancers.",1350086400,,406,4.05

this is a DVD for someone who already knows the steps and the beat/counts

for me if this were for true beginners there would be a primer for each step
""OK here is what I want on the next step""  there is none. it starts off doing the steps and
assumes that the person/people that are following along know what to do.

I had no idea how to get back in shape and this video - a Xmas gift from a friend - was just sitting there tempting me.

Well, I did it last week and it's such a shame about all that wasted time! I should have been doing it a long time ago!

I loved every moment of it. The beauty of it is, there's no limit to how perfectly (or how sloppily) you do it.

I was hoping for a video that was a little longer than the 15 min. fast portion of the workout. As others have said, she moves too fast for beginners and doesn't break down the steps long enough to ""get"" them. I can get up a sweat but don't feel there's a good cardio workout because its too short.

Revision of review after 4-5 weeks:
Can't give it a 5 star but have changed it from the original 2 stars I gave it. After doing this workout for several weeks, I'm onto the steps and enjoying the workout. I didn't think I would say that. I work up a sweat by the time I'm done. Its a fun workout and Madonna is very easy to listen to. I am 55+ and can keep up pretty well with the young dancers. As someone else mentioned you want to be careful of some of the head and arm moves as they may be harmful if you really get into it.

All in all, I'm enjoying the workout now after learning the routine. I've incorporated it into my weekly workouts and added a weight lifting routine afterward. Madonna's awesome biceps have inspired me to try to get mine in shape.",1319068800,4,1110,4.1342592592592595

2174804,2,B00067Z2R8,"I feel this video is not for beginners. They all looked like professional dancers. I kind of gave up after a while out OF frustration. I think I will stick with Denise Austin DVD's, they seem to be easier to follow, but kind of boring. The makers of this video should consider that there could be older, less in shape people out there who need to go a little slower. Sorry, just my opinion.

2174805,4,B00067Z2R8,"After reading some of the one star reviews, I wanted to say something about this workout DVD. I am in no way trying to discount the experiences of others, but I think some of the reviews were misleading and may turn off potential beginners from participating in this workout. I think this is a really great video for beginners, as almost all of the moves are simple.

First off, yes Madonna Grimes does use terminology that most people do not know without having dance experience. That being said, she DOES show you how to do them (the camera focuses on her footwork as she does the step 3-4 times). Most of them (Samba, Meringue) are actually really easy. No, she does not show you in slow motion or use words to explain the steps, but they're REALLY self explanatory if you watch the video.

Second off, just to be clear, I am not a professional dancer by any means. I am quite awkward, my balance is awful, and I am waaay clumsy. Still, I like to wiggle and shake so I decided to get this dance DVD. I'll admit it - the first 2 times I did it, it was difficult and seemingly impossible to master the moves. But dance and fitness are not about being be easy - it's about challenging yourself and rising to the occasion, so I kept with it. I've done this video several times and have been able to master everything except for one move (I'm way too clumsy to do a traveling cross legged samba step). So I modify that part slightly so that it's a move I can do. I still try to do it sometimes, but at the end of the day I just want to make sure that I get a workout.

Madonna Grimes has a lot of style when she dances. I think that can be intimidating for some beginners. I know for myself, I was trying to match her style, and it made me mess up a lot. But once I got over it and let my own body carry me through the moves, I was able to get a really good workout. After doing the video a lot now, I have my own style. I mean, it's an awkward nerdy style, but it is still a style and I feel more confident about myself.

I only give this DVD 4 stars because I didn't like it as much as her hip-hop workout.",1314921600,33,2106,4.079710144927536
2174806,5,B00067Z2R8,Ms. Grimes is an excellent instructor. She knows her techniques and she know how to teach somewhat difficult steps to someone who had not worked out in years! Her enthusiasm is infectious! I use it every day!!,1314748800,,209,4.675675675675675

I suggest with any dvd work out, watch it first and then try it, that way you will see the difference in transitioning. You will break a sweat. Love the bonus 10 minute workout that really works the core, hams and quads. I recommend this video. Stick with it, yes you will sweat despite what you read. I suggest doing it on a flat service and not carpet for free flow foot action. No it's not one to take to the dance floor, but does exactly what you need at home burning calories with cardio.

I think she repeats all of the combinations uninterrupted 3 times after they are learned and the workout is over. The first time I did the workout I repeated the whole thing twice in an effort to get an adequate workout, but it doesn't flow when done this way. I guess the length of the video is what makes it be for beginners, but I'd think the moves are too complex for them. Also, there is a dancer performance on the DVD that is fine to look at once, but when you buy a workout video, you want to workout, not observe a performance more than once.

It works best for me on those days that I don't feel very energetic but know I need to work out.  Another thing I've noticed is the more I use her DVD's, the more annoyed I get by her obnoxious personality and her loud outbursts/yells, mainly directed at the other dancers in a seemingly humorous way.

In the ""workout"", there are a lot of stops and starts...much like learning a dance in a dance class. It doesn't flow at all for a workout. And there are times when the cast messes up and they all sit there and laugh. I thought that was interuptive and very unprofessional.

* There is a lot of African influence and I was looking for more classical ballroom feel and style
* It was too fast and intense for a beginner and there was no step guide for learning gradually
* She criticizes her backup dancers during the routine and even stops moving at one point (while the backup dancers continue) due to some issue that I couldn't understand.  This was very distracting and unprofessional and lowered my confidence that I would be doing the right thing if I looked at anyone but her.

She'll go over the 1st move, you'll do the 1st move repeatedly, then she'll add on a 2nd move.  You'll then do the 1st and 2nd moves repeatedly, then she'll add a 3rd and so on until you're doing a full dance routine.  This may be difficult if you have no rhythm, but after a little practice, you'll get it and start to enjoy it.

2174863,4,B00067Z2R8,"Don't be fooled by the title ""Dance Fitness for Beginners.""  Anyone can do this routine except those with weak joints because there is a lot of hopping going on in this workout.  Even the 10 minute warm-up has several hopping moves as well as some fast neck swings.  After you do that, however, MaDonna leads in several stretches.  The 15 minute routine has a mixture of fast footwork and hops.  The beginner would probably do better to get her other ""Dance Fitness for Beginners"" workout, but I personally prefer this one as a workout.  It is more fun and higher cardio.  The cool-down is really good after all of the high cardio moves you do, and it is about 5 minutes.  There is a bonus 10 minute toning workout that works the legs and abs.  This one works the legs more than the abs as opposed to the toning workout in her other partner video which worked both equally.  It is really short, but I like this workout because it is fun.  The 5 back-up dancers are constantly joking around with each other and MaDonna, and the atmosphere is just one of fun.  There was more of African dance in this workout than there was Latin, and that is a unique workout that you don't see a lot.  This is not the same workout as MaDonna's ""All Star Workouts:Afro-Latino"" which I thought it was until I actually bought this.  Overall, this was a high-intensity, fast workout that was just a little too short in my opinion.",1260576000,,1409,4.453125

I am not a good dancer at all and none of the moves come naturally to me, but this is fun to do and gives me somewhat of a workout.  I've noticed that the better I become at doing the moves, the more of a workout I can get.  Two things were disappointing -- 1) there isn't a step guide portion of the video so you have to learn as you are doing the routine and 2) it's too short.  I like to workout for at least 40 - 45 minutes and with less than 30 minutes this one just isn't long enough.  In order to make it longer I've been doing the warm up, then going through the routine twice, then doing the cool down.  But at least this is fun enough to make me wish it was longer!

2174869,2,B00067Z2R8,"I've been looking for Zumba exercise videos, and when I didn't find any, I was hoping this would be similar. Not the case unfortunately. I agree with other reviewers who found the moves too complicated for beginners. I didn't have much problem with them (w/the exception of that ""travelling"" move) because I've been dancing to Latin music for decades, but I can't imagine that anyone w/out that background would be able to keep up. Although MaDonna repeats the moves several times, she does them too quickly for a true beginner to catch on easily. For myself, I actually liked the dance moves a lot, which is why I rated it two stars instead of one. The issue I have w/the video is that she keeps stopping after only doing a few combinations. Because of that, it was impossible for me to get my heart rate up and keep it elevated for any length of time. I also found it much too brief. I did do the extra 10-min. workout which consisted mostly of squats and a little floor work for abs, but I still didn't feel as if I'd worked out. I ended up following this ""work-out"" w/the Turbo Jam Cardio Party workout. I highly recommend it for anyone who's looking for a fun, non-stop, 45-min. dancing workout that's easy on the joints, will get your heart pumping, and have you sweating big time.

If you're not sure about this video and you're a Netflix member, I recommend ordering it through them first - that's what I did. Needless to say, I'm not going to purchase this video.",1252022400,35,1472,4.492537313432836

I find that after doing a workout DVD for a few months, I get very bored with it and store it away for a long time.  Not with this one!  This DVD is not like working out at all.  It's like being at a high-energy party with the most fun group of friends you can assemble.  The music is good and the moves are easy, which motivates you to put more emphasis on your dance moves (and thus burn more calories).  MaDonna is fun, friendly and motivating and the backup dancers have a great rapport with each other.  Although the workout is shorter than most, I always work up a sweat and get my heart pumping.  This DVD is a must for any workout collection.",1241395200,,740,4.055172413793104
2174873,4,B00067Z2R8,"This workout is an intermediate Latin-/African-inspired dance routine.  It is SO fun and SO intense!  This is the only workout DVD I own that gets me really sweating -- and that's a good thing!

You need to know some simple Latin dance steps (merengue, mambo, cha-cha) beforehand, or be able to pick them up quickly, because MaDonna jumps into them first thing.  Granted, the merengue is an easy dance move -- just marching while twisting your hips/legs -- but there was zero instuction, so I could see how someone with no dance experience would feel overwhelmed right off the bat.  The ""jumping right in with no instruction"" caught me a little off guard at first, but luckily I have had some Latin dance training and was able to follow along with no problems.  If MaDonna provided instruction by going through the steps at 1/2 time, I would wholeheartedly recommend this workout to beginners.  As is, it's probably most appropriate and fun for those who can easily pick up most coreography.

I'd love to take a dance class with MaDonna Grimes.  Her cueing is great.  She's fun and friendly with her backup dancers, frequently talking to them during the routine (like, ""Next is the mambo -- yes, y'all?"" and they shout back, ""YES!"").  A few times, though, MaDonna shouts ""MERENGUE!"" so loud that there's mic feedback, and sometimes she yells ""AAAHH!"" after finishing a particularly intense combo.  If you're following along with the workout, you won't really notice/mind this (I don't -- it's like being in a live dance class), although some people may find it a bit jarring.  For those who don't like lots of whooping and hollering during their workouts, you do have the option to go through the entire routine with just the music (no talking or cueing).

Here's what you get on this DVD:

- Warm-up: 10 minutes of light-intensity Latin moves, some shimmying, stretching lunges, neck rolls, torso isolations, a few jumps towards the end.  I'm glad this warm-up is as long as it is; you need it to prepare you for the next part!
- Workout routine: 15 minutes of INTENSE Latin & African dance steps.  A wildly effective cardio routine that will really get you sweating!
- Cool-down: A 5-minute modified version of the warm-up, with light-intensity Latin moves and stretching.
- ""Performance"": A pre-recorded hip hop performance that plays immediately after the cool-down, featuring MaDonna and her backup dancers.  Fun, but kind of random -- I did like watching it.
- Bonus Workout: A standard aerobic-style 10-minute routine with TONS of squats, some standing/lying ab work, and some stretching.  Probably good for some people, but I don't use this section at all.

I do wish there were a second routine before the cool-down or that the main-feature dance workout were longer.  The front of the DVD says ""Leaves You Sweating for More!"" which is true.  You're having so much fun doing the routine that it's over before you know it.  You're standing there after the cool-down, going, ""Wait, that's all?""  So, I'm taking half a star off my rating because I wish the routine were longer, and half a star off because it needs some 1/2 time step instruction to be truly accessible to beginners (although this wasn't a problem for me personally, it would improve the workout's overall quality).  Compared to MaDonna's Urban Street Heat DVD, which I also own and enjoy, this Latin/African routine contains the same segments (warm-up, routine, cool-down) and is the same length of time (30 min.), but is more fun and more intense (makes me work harder, probably burns more calories).

In summary, I'm extremely happy that I bought this DVD because the routine is SO fun and really gets my heart pumping.  The BEST dance workout DVD purchase I've made!",1241049600,3,3742,4.861198738170347

While I really enjoy doing this routine, I don't really find it to be challenging as a workout. Learning the dance moves takes a little time, but that really is the most challenging aspect. If you're at or near your goal weight, perhaps this would be a good maintenance workout; but to lose weight and really get in shape, I have had to look elsewhere and now only do this routine on occasion for a fun change of pace. I should note, however, that I really like the 10-minute bonus workout and will often do it before the dance routine for some added benefit.",1239667200,6,715,4.303703703703704

I know one or two simple Latin steps, but when I watched this video I was totally off key and pretty much got frustrated and turned it off after 15 minutes.  #1, they go way too fast and don't review the steps well enough, for enough time.  and #2 the camera person cuts off the dancers from the knees down in a lot of the scenes and therefore if you can not remember exactly where your feet are supposed to be going yet you can't watch the screen to get a clue.  I suggest a few begging scenes in the DVD on each step so that during the video everyone may follow along easier AND the camera person should show Madonna's entire body throughout the DVD so everyone can follow along.

After three weeks, there is still one key move that I can't seem to master and I'm not sure the people on video do either.  Madonna is fun and motivating in her voice. It doesn't take long to master the steps.  You can really get steps down good by the third workout.  However, I was barely out of breath and hardly broke a sweat even giving it my all.

Maybe the most disappointing thing is that the lesson is way too short for a really good workout.

But the zumba classes are super demanding, partly because they're a full hour of non-stop fun.  No talking, we just follow the instructor who gives us visual cues only and plays the most fun music!

The camera style doesn't help either, changing angles right when the instructor changes the routine and shooting from the hips up so, we can't follow what their feet are doing.

I love Ms. Grimes workout.  I bought this soley because of the African/Latin combo - thought it would be fun and I was not disappointed.  MaDonna is such a great teacher.  I've never had official dance training - just did LOTS of dancing out at bars (ha) ""back in the day"".  She is great about doing some moves, adding to it, repeating it, and building on that.  What's better is she is having fun with it and makes you have fun with it too!  The whole class is having fun and they all really make you feel like you're right there with them laughing and saying YEAH - I DID IT!  It's such a great motivator.  I just love it.

This is a high impact, high intensity, full on work out.

I don't really like her as a presenter, and she chats a bit too much with the other people. That bit is annoying.

It is also very full on. I think that you need to know your own body quite well, as there are lots of long loose throwing body parts around movements. You want to be careful you don't put anything out.

As a workout, I guess it has a lot going for it. I prefer things where I feel like I am dancing, and even though I could recognise a lot of moves, and see them as dance, I didn't feel like I was dancing.",1203120000,,623,3.9206349206349205

I was sadly mistaken because evidently you need to know how to do the Salsa, Samba & Mambo before participating in this workout. I was very disappointed with MaDonna Grimes indicating this was for beginners. I love her energy, but I like a workout where the instructor explains the moves much more slowly. I've watched her on Fit TV, along with other instructors, but this workout wasn't for me as a newbie.

It's so enjoyable that I'm actually disappointed when it's over.  It honestly is too brief!  Combined with the 10-minute bonus workout (which I usually do after the primary workout),it's definitely a great workout.

2174906,5,B00067Z2R8,Hey everybody! I figured that I would leave a review because the reveiws from other people are what made me buy this tape in the first place. So here goes nothing..... This DVD was awesome. I really enjoyed the high energy and friendly MaDonna Grimes teaching style. I do this workout 4 times a week and I haven't tired of it yet. The dance steps are a bit tricky at first but if you stick with it two or three times then you'll get it and have a blast. I've lost 48lbs in the past two months and I love it. I throw in some light weights twice a week and I'm looking great!!,1155513600,107,574,4.043859649122807
2174907,5,B00067Z2R8,"The first time I tried this workout, I loved it so much that I instantly had to do it again.  On the cover of the DVD it says, 'leaves you sweating for more', and with regards to my experience with it so far, that is exactly what it did.  It left me sweating, and wanting more!

Here's what you get:

10MIN WARMUP - This combines a few low impact dance moves with a few stretches.  Some of the stretches are a bit 'hmmm...', but you only do them after you're VERY warm.  This is around 10 minutes, which is a good length for a warmup.  Some of the moves you learn in the warmup will be re-used in the dance portion of the workout.

15MIN DANCE - Madonna teaches you the moves one by one, building together a longer routine.  One thing that I love about her teaching is that once she's taught you a move, she practices what I like to call 'the transition'.  This is where you practice the move that comes just before the new move, as well as the new move.  If that doesn't make sense, say that she's taught moves 1-3 and is teaching you the 4th move.  Once she's taught the 4th move, she practices moves 3 and 4, before going through the whole routine from the 1st move.  This Latin combination includes hip swings, mambos, cha-chas, and a very tricky samba-travel step.

5MIN COOL DOWN - Here, Madonna takes you through some of the stretches that you did in the warmup, as well as some neck stretches - some people will need to be careful with these.

10MIN BONUS - This is not a african-latin dance segment, but rather a set of intense toning moves.  She teaches 4 different types of squats, as well as some ab work.

Madonna and her group of exercisers - both male and female - exercise in a nice street-dance-studio-esque set.  If that doesn't set the scene, the floors are polished wood, and the walls are dark red brick, with pillars, potplants, and windows scattered throughout.  The windows in the room don't overlook anything, but seem to have a screen of turqoise light outside it; emulating a blue sky.  It kind of reminds of the old Ricki Lake sets (back in the day!).

In terms of instructor personality, Madonna is a breath of fresh air.  She is relaxed, laid back, and interacts with the other exercisers in a 'hey-wassup-mate' manner.  In addition, they also interact with her the same way - giving a fun atmosphere; like being in a class, but not an extreme 'whoop-it-up' atmosphere like in Kathy Smith's Timesaver Cardio.

For those of you who are absolute beginners to dance, you will find this difficult.  What I suggest you do is ignore the arm movements for the first couple of times that you try the DVD, and focus on the getting your legs right.  Also, ignore the samba-travel step and just shuffle here; thats a very difficult step, and it'll only take practice-practice-and-more-practice to get it right.  Madonna moves through the moves pretty quickly, only giving a couple of opportunities to learn the steps before incorporating them into the routine.  She is good at cueing, but not so good at teaching the moves.

A word of warning, the second move that she teaches in the dance portion (which also appears in the warmup) involves you swinging your arms and your head.  Take it easy on this move, since I really got into it, and it was inevitable that I heard a big CRACK from my neck, oops!  It looks like Madonna and one of the other girls are going hard out with this move, but thats because their hair is long, so for your safety, don't try to emulate them.

A refreshing, intense, short workout that is LOADS of fun!  Cheers!",1149811200,292,3560,4.469767441860465
2174908,4,B00067Z2R8,"Just did this workout for the first time today... Was I sweating?  Yes.  Moving?  Yes.  Heart pumping?  Yes.  Having fun?  YES!  It begins with a warm up that already has your heart going and introduces some of the moves you'll use later.  During the dance section be ready because she goes fast.  There are no slow-downs, or break-downs.  It's a full dive in and dance from the very beginning.  Would this be the best first dance DVD?  Probably not.  But if you're used to some of these moves, follow easily, or are willing to do it over and over until you get it, the this quick under 30 minute work out packs a real punch.  There is a short cool down that wasn't quite long enough for me (hence the 4 stars) so I did some extra strechting after it was over.  But MaDonna's energy is high and was very appealing to me, and despite some huffing and puffing I had fun making it to the end.
