8041988,5,B0006OA9DI,"Hi! We own the whole set, and let me tell you, the entire family can repeat, word for word, the scripts of the movies.

And by 'my entire family' I mean myself, my husband, and all the kids, all the way down to my two year old.

In fact, just the other day he quoted, to my utter delight, a full dialogue from ""The Fish Head."" He also knows, and can act out 'what Shimmy does in an earfquake.'

Thank you for putting out such wholesome, enriching, entertaining, ect. entertainment.

Only one problem - my husband's hat collection is now in a very sorry state.

My message to you - buy these videos. You will not regret it.

8041989,5,B0006OA9DI,"Leibel Cohen has done a superb job in creating a whole new Batman styled charicter that allows kids to identify with one who is proud of his ideals and is truly out to serve a ""Higher Purpose""

I have seen kids from all walks of life literally glued to the screen!  The suspense is superb, and the story-line keeps you on your toes, and all this is without anything you would mind them viewing!

It's certainly not a BIG BUDGET batman movie, but if you are looking for something with more meaning than boy loves girl, you certainly won't be disappointed.",1106352000,2,554,4.465346534653466
8041990,5,B0006OA9DI,"As a professional educator and highly involved with outreach, I see Agent Emes as a usefull tool to promote Jewish family values and ideals. As a parent of many small children, Agent Emes provides a highly entertaining medium for our children. My eight year old knows the entire script of all three videos by heart. I myself enjoy watching it with them. Leibel Cohen has done a first class job which is factually acurate in conveying Jewish principles and is technically/cinemtologically cutting edge. I highly recommend these films for young and young of heart.

8041992,4,B0006OA9DI,"We are a secular, ""culturally"" Jewish family with two boys aged seven and eight.  Our kids love the ""Spy-Kids"" movies, and they also watch Agent Emes over and over!  This episode has some particularly nice lessons about respecting one's parents and the value of giving charity (tsedakah) -- wrapped up in a very funny plot and format.  Not all the details are 100% plausible, but the kids will never notice!  You'll have a lot of fun with this DVD.",1106092800,,448,4.632911392405063

  It is a pleasure to know that a parent can trust Leibel Cohen to put out educational and entertaining videos(/cd's)that a parent doesn't have to preview, unless it is just for the fun of it!

  When is Episode 4 coming out?

  We are all waiting!",1106092800,,326,4.578947368421052
