8588131,5,B00000IBOC,"Not only is this video a good continuation of the first one but it  contains the best animated ground battle scenes in the series! It was all  intense action. Ensign Kou finally gains the right to pilot the New Gundam  by beating veteran Lt. Monsha in a ground battle in the first episode. In  the second, Kou fights off enemy mobile suits to try to stop Gato from  taking the Nuclear Gundam! Great action and I loved the battle between Kou  and Monsha.",965520000,,453,4.397590361445783
