This is not really a concert film but more about the experience of a three day event on a somerset farm, and this event looked rainless which made it even more special. With this movie presented in 2.35:1 aspect ratio and lots of music throughout it really makes you feel you are there.",1239148800,,426,4.4743589743589745
7899281,5,6305944512,"Unfortunately, most people in the US only know of the main stage events of Glastonbury, which are comprised of the most popular bands.  But the main stage events make up only a fraction of what the Glastonbury festival is and personally, I can see all of those bands on MTV, so I don't care as much about that scene.  For those who are interested in the festival itself, this is the next best thing to being there.  There was a time when the people in the crowds were as important as the music, in fact for many people still, the music is only an excuse to hang out at what is basically a kind of impromptu circus and hippie scene.  That's right, hippies are alive and well and freaky as ever!  There are a few obscure bands plus Porno for Pyros, but there are no entire sets, just a few minutes of their music.  I can see where band enthusiasts would be disappointed, but if you 'get' the vibe that is Glastonbury, you'll be happy to move along through the throng of people and dig everything that is happening around you.  It's not about the bands ... it's about the freaks!  That's what the scene is all about and quite frankly as a certifiable freak myself, I'm very happy that that's what the movie is all about too!",1138060800,2,1221,4.324561403508772
7899282,2,6305944512,"When I buy a VHS or a DVD of a concert or of a music festival I want to see the band(s) that is playing and listen to the whole song(s). This movie is mostly the movie of  what's going around the stage, not on top of it. Because this movie is not focused on the music the sound is poor. So if you want to see the carnival around the Glastonbury music festival this is your movie, not mine.",971827200,14,389,3.8625
