4127416,4,B003IMEROW,I did the workout for the first time today and really liked it.  It's not an easy workout and I wouldn't recommend it for someone with no experience in kickboxing.  My only real complaint is that some of the choreography is a little difficult to follow.  There is no real effort to show the moves slowly-- I will have to watch at least one part in slow motion to catch on to the moves!! I was definitely drenched in sweat by the time I was done with the workout.  The music is also pretty good and Amy is not irritating and generally pleasant.  I was looking for a challenge and definitely found it in this workout!,1283040000,,615,4.267241379310345
8397486,5,B003IMEROW,"Amy's Kickboxing Videos are the Best, especially Kickbox Surge and Kickbox Xtreme.  They are more fun and interesting than any other kickboxing videos because they have built-up routines rather than just boring drills.  I still use both videos regularly after several years.  Kickbox Surge has a little more fun factor.  They are not beginner videos (intermediate+).  The choreography is not simple, but not complex either.",1527292800,,423,5.446153846153846
8397487,4,B003IMEROW,This is a no frills basic kickboxing video program that gets you moving in the right direction.  It may be a bit intense for some and a bit easy for others.  It all depends on your fitness level.  My wife found that it was not as explosive and she wanted and I thought it was instructive and overall provided a decent workout.  She likes her workout videos to have loud fast paced music where I enjoy videos with dynamic instructors.  So it comes down to a matter of preference.,1432080000,,478,4.325842696629214
8397488,4,B003IMEROW,If I want a break from box aerobics but wants something intense this fits the bill.  It tones your legs and arms quickly while working your oblique muscles as well.  I would check this one out.,1401148800,,193,4.333333333333333
8397489,4,B003IMEROW,"This is a fun workout with rockin' music!  I agree with the other reviews about the music/sound being quiet.  I, too, crank up my TV to remedy that problem.  Also, during the cool-down segment there's a weird spot (almost like a hiccup so to speak).  I though it was something wrong with my DVD, so I exchanged it.  Well, the second one did the exact same thing in the exact same spot.  It must be an editing issue and that's why I took off one star.  Other than that, it really is fun and helps me get all of my aggressions out! :)

p.s. She (Amy) does say, ""Hell yeah!"" a few times, so this may bother some people.  I really don't notice it all that much but thought I should mention it.",1394496000,,689,4.120300751879699
8397490,2,B003IMEROW,"I'm used to more serious kick box styles, the choreography on this was way too dancy for me.  Felt like I was in a 80s aerobic class with a couple of jabs in the mix so they could call it kickboxing.  If you like floor aerobics it would be a great workout. Otherwise, skip it.",1375747200,,276,4.0
8397491,3,B003IMEROW,"I really like Amy Bento's energy, and enjoyed the cardio aspect of this workout. However, I consider the choreography to be pretty difficult, and I am used to doing complex moves in a home workout tape (i.e. Turbofire or Adanced Tae-bo). Even after a few times of doing the dvd, I would still get confused or disoriented in the middle. As a result, it makes it harder to get a really kick butt effective workout.

If you are great at picking up choreography and enjoy listening to pretty recent pop music, I recommend this DVD. Amy even includes Rihanna songs in this dvd, and it's hysterical to hear her sing along. However, if you are mediocre at choreography and are looking to get your heart rate really going, I would pass.",1338163200,2,728,4.557251908396947
8397492,5,B003IMEROW,"I have been doing kickboxing workouts 4 or 5 times a week for several months now.  That said, it's difficult to find a DVD that offers something different and gives me an adequate challenge.  This DVD did it.
I was nervous about buying an Amy Bento DVD because so many reviews complained about the complex choreography.  However, I was really hungry for a new DVD, and it's hard to find one that is purely kickboxing, advanced, and over 45 minutes long.  I am pleased to say this one fit the bill.
First of all, if you are nervous about the reviews about the complexity please do not be dissuaded.  Yes some of the moves take a couple of attempts to get down, but that adds to the enjoyment of the workout.  I watched the video twice before trying it.  The first time I did the workout there were a couple of spots that tripped me up, but the second time through I had almost no problems.  I agree with another reviewer who said that you don't want a workout that you can do perfectly right away.  Once you get it down it's a lot of fun.
The format of the workout is good; there are 5 kickbox sequences; each is followed by a brief, kickboxing-inspired ""surge"" that is higher impact and intensity.  You have an option of doing the whole workout without the surge, which I really like for a day when I want something easier on the joints.  Each kickboxing segment is progressive.  First Amy teaches you a move that you practice a few times, then she teaches you a new move, then you put the two together.  You do that a few times to build up the sequence, then put it all together, then switch sides.  After all that you repeat the whole thing on the right then left twice.  By the time you get to the final pass through you might be a little bored with the first move you learned.  I don't see this becoming a huge problem as long as you don't do the DVD more than once a week.  The intensity level is good, and the impact is pretty low if you cut out the surges(compared to other advanced kickboxing DVDs). There are a lot of jumping jacks in between moves.  You can also expect to see spinning kicks and jump kicks, but if you don't like the impact you can modify those.
There are some really good premixes as well.  As I said, you can do the whole thing without surges, all of the surges without the kickboxing, sequences and surges 1-3, or sequences and surges 3-5.  All premixes include the warmup (which is very good), a cool-down, abs segment, and stretch.
Based on my experience with this DVD I chose to order another Amy Bento video.  This DVD does not include weight-training, so if you're looking for an interval workout this is not it.  I will have this workout in my regular rotation, but I still like both of Susan Chung's DVDs best; if you are looking for the ""crown jewel"" of kickboxing DVDs I would recommend her RapidFire Results.",1333843200,3,2848,4.354166666666667
8397493,4,B003IMEROW,"I've only done this DVD twice, but I prefer moves that aren't too difficult to catch on to.  Some of her moves are very difficult.  I kept watching both times and wondering what the heck she was doing.  There's only two of those types of moves in this DVD so that was the reason I gave it as many as four stars.  Despite the difficult moves it is a very good kickboxing workout.  I've been exercising for years now doing a variety of exercises (Body Pump, Zumba, RIPPED, cycle, kickboxing etc.) and I haven't had a work out in a long time that made me sore the next day until I did this one.  I think eventually I will get those moves that I think are so difficult...I'm just slow on the uptake.  Once I get them this may turn out to be a five star DVD...and I never give those!  According to other reveiwers this is the less difficult of all her other DVDs so I don't think I'll be buying another one of hers, but this one is pretty good.  Oh, and I like the music on this...just an added bonus.",1330300800,,996,4.119170984455959
8397494,5,B003IMEROW,"I love all things Amy Bento and this workout doesn't disappoint.  Even the warmup is tough and gets my heart rate up!  Amy has a great flair for putting together tough workouts that aren't hard on the joints. This is unlike other advanced instructors like Cathe Friedrich, for whom high intensity means high impact.

Amy is having a blast in this workout; her enthusiasm is catching.  I smile just watching her.

I love complex choreography and have no patience for workouts where the moves are broken down and reviewed over and over.  I like to use my brain when I workout and trying to get the moves down keeps me engaged.  Amy will do a move a few times, then put it into the routine and do the routine a few times.  By the end of the routine, I get the move.

Amy explains what she'll be doing before she does it.  Since I'm not completely familiar with her terminology, this isn't as helpful to me.  But, it doesn't matter since I just keep alternating my right and left foot and eventually it all comes together.  The flying knee, back kick, front kick is especially challenging, but really fun once you get it.

The core refining section at the end is fun and filled with some unique moves.

I highly recommend this DVD for anyone wanting a challenging kickboxing workout.",1327968000,3,1279,4.504347826086956
8397495,4,B003IMEROW,"I have done this workout a few times now and really enjoy it.  The choreography is much easier to follow compared to a couple of other Amy Bento workout DVD's I had purchased, Hi Low Knockout and Kickbox Extreme.  I got rid of those DVD's after a few trys because I found myself spending more time being frustrated than exercising.  The moves were just too complicated and used up far too much floor space.  This coming from someone who was on their high school drill team so I have no problem following complicated choreography, but those DVD's were too much.  Amy seems to have gone ""back to the basics"" on this one and it works for me.  She still likes the occasional pivot but not so many that I get lost.  Amy is quite pleasant in Kickbox Surge and the music is great.  I get a good heart-pumping and LONG workout, which I was looking for.  I gave it a 4 because of her lack of form, she's no Cathe Friedrich.  I'd recommend this over Amy's other kickboxing DVD's.",1288137600,9,969,4.363128491620111
