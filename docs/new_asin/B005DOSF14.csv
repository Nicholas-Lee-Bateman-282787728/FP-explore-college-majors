8467277,2,B005DOSF14,"Five stars for the cast and some exceptional acting on the parts of Fry, Wise, Montgomery, and Quick, but the script, plot, and direction are disjointed and unconvincing.  Granted, transforming an opus of this magnitude into a 2-hour film is an impossible task --  a mini-series might have been a better choice -- but the film is seriously flawed.  A viewer might have trouble following had they not read the book -- even so, the film's plot varies from the book quite a bit.  The premise, of course -- breaking the connection between heaven and earth which can only be achieved by a chosen one (for whom an angel has to go through extraordinary lengths to bring about his conception) to return the tablets of the Ten Commandments to Heaven -- is absolutely ridiculous.  In this reviewer's opinion, there are better ways to spend 2 hours.",1419033600,,838,4.712328767123288
8467278,5,B005DOSF14,"One of the most interesting movies I have seen in years with such a great cast with Oliver Platt. Such a great plot. Very suspenceful and not that long when you really find yourslf getting into it, with the big knockout punch coming about 10 secs. right before the movie ends, It's worth waiting for and It was a very moving experience for me!!!  As I think it will be for you too! This is a MUST SEE for anyone who is interested in the plot & their soul and it's destination for mankind. A very unique story and answer to the puzzle for what we all wonder about, hope for and what has already been done for us if we will only follow the clear and specific directions of a man by the name of Jesus of Nazareth who told us what to do & how to escape this coming hell. It's as if there is only one way out of a deep and dark cave and He found the onlyway out of it and is telling us how we can find our only one way out too!  Faith, true Bibical Faith, is a Dynamic (a power) which propells the beliver into obdience to the commands of the Lord. Would Noah have built the Ark if he have just set back in his easy chair saying ""I believe, I believe, oh yes I believe Lord"" ? No! He would been desroyed with all the others and not have survived the flood if he had NOT obeyed the commands of the LORD whot otld him to build the Ark!. ""A faith wiout works is a dead faith."" wouldn't you say? So don't go on just believing that Jesus is the Christ, the only Son of God, the Son of Man, the Chosen One or just another avatar or great teacher who died on the cross so that we would all be ""SAVED"".So many people toaday belive 'WE don't need to pick up our cross, Jesus did that for us"", John 3:16. : But those verses are taken out of contex and most people ascribe a few verses also like that and say to themselves that ""because I believe them, them I am saved. But that is just faith in faith!. Faith then becomes a substitue for the commands( or if you prefer directions, not suggestions) of Christ; which are really pretty easy really, or really difficult, if you find it to be so, if you just have THE CURIOSITY TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS if you will follow them. Matt. 10:38. What have you got to lose? Huh? Life Eternal? Or the Salvation of your very Soul? Faith or belief has become a substitute for Jesus Christ himself!!! If this offends anyone then good, read your Bibles and try and prove me wrong, But, as I have, you will find the Truththe authentic Truth which will set you free.! ""Take the broadway and you lose but take the narrow way and strive to enter ye in at the straight gate and walk the narrow way unto Life"" Matt. 7: 13-14. Christ he would manifest himself to  you if you did this. What does the word ""manfest"" mean. If Presidesnt O'Bama were to manifest himself to you, do you think he wold not know you then? Would he say to you""get away from me I never knew you"" Mat. 7: 21-23, as Christ does come your Judgement Day? Salvation is not an instant thing and many false preachers, teachers and evangelists will tell you that ""conversion"" is just the same as ""rejuvination"", or being ""born again"". They're all over the airways and rake in millions of dollars each year, promising you an instant salvation, instant prosperity,no trouble ever again if you ""just have faith!"". Please, if you value your OWN soul worth saving, check it out. And check out this movie too. If you can't find it on Amazon in Region 1,or elsewhere in your realm, then go to Walmart & buy a Roku box for about $40 and subscribe to Netflix for $8 a month, You'll have hundres of chanels to chose from, mosly free, and 1,000s of movies and other programs and radio shows, TV shows, & more than you could ever do ina life time & you will find this film on the ""viewster channel"". Happy Hunting! Find & follow the Truth you are looking for in your heart. God bless you all.",1386374400,,3852,4.174731182795699
