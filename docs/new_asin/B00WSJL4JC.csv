7152331,5,B00WSJL4JC,"GORGEOUSLY DEPICTED WITH SLIGHT RE-ORDER TO THE EVENTS AND THEMES

***QUICK CONTRAST TO HARDY'S NOVEL AND THE 1967 CLASSIC INCLUDED AT BOTTOM OF THIS REVIEW

From the dazzlingly rich colors, beautiful countryside, moments of revelry or gripping sadness, not to mention the emotional soundtrack, this adaptation is just stunning in so many ways.  The story is reordered from the book in just a few places to save certain revelations till near the end and emphasize romantic situations.  The original novel is actually quite short so this is a rare instance where the movie actually has a chance to develop some aspects more than the print.  I reread the book and re-watched the 1967 classic at the same time and have left a few impressions at the end of this review.  This adaptation emphasizes some themes more for modern audiences while minimizing others.  For instance, female strength is emphasized more here while vanity is less prominent (vanity was a very important theme in the original tale).  I really liked the fresh take, though some purists have expressed disappointment.  My intent is to simply describe and direct according to each individual taste.

THE STORY (no spoilers):  Bathsheba Everdene (Carey Mulligan) arrives to live with her aunt Mrs. Hurst on a farm in Wessex (partially fictionalized region in south west England) and befriends a neighbor Gabriel Oak (Matthias Schoenaerts) who is renting a sheep farm next to them.  He has loans, but improving fortunes that will bring him prosperity and his own land someday.  Bathsheba is intelligent and beautiful, but has little fortunes of her own.  Though Gabriel declares his interest in marriage, Bathsheba is independent and doesn't wish to be tied down.  The tide of fortunes will swirl for each of them and Bathsheba inherits a lucrative property of her own.  She quickly proves that she is an able and benevolent land holder.  Circumstances will bring the two together again, but Bathsheba will attract three potential suitors.  A neighboring squire Mr. William Boldwood (Michael Sheen) is the wealthy gentleman to Gabriel's noble-hearted worker class.  Both seem a little awkward around women.  Contrast that with the third prospect, Sergeant Francis Troy (Tom Sturridge) portrayed as a gallant and ladies' man.  Each of them will try to solve the puzzle that is Bathsheba Eberdene.

OTHER THOUGHTS: There is a brief homage to the 1967 version when Bathsheba addresses her new employees.  The movie presents the scene in much the same way as the 1967 version (this scene and some of the language is in some versions of the much revised novel).  The cinematography in this update is rich with color and landscape.  The soundtrack is amazing with evocative violin pieces, a little English country dance, and a haunting ballad sung by Carey Mulligan called ""Let No Man Steal Your Thyme"".

CONTRASTS WITH BOOK AND 1967 CLASSIC VERSION (still no spoilers):  Note that my point here is not to say one is better than the other as they are made in different eras with different styles.  Both are now favorites of mine for different reasons.  In this version I didn't mind the reorder of the ""sheep"" event and change in themes.  I enjoy the original book and its somewhat parable-esque theme of vanity.  I do think this 2015 version is very careful in what it changes.  The reordered parts are inserted latter to maintain almost all the important scenes from the book.  As I said, the book is short, so both the 1967 and 2015 movie versions are able to develop some scenes even more than the book.  That is very unusual for film adaptations.  The 1967 movie does stick more strictly with Hardy's themes and order of events.  However, I also think this adaptation allows for a rich telling with more sympathetic characters. The 2015 version eliminates some (not all) of the conflict between Mr. Boldwood and Sergeant Troy in order to change some of Boldwood's motivations later on.  One could say Troy is given a hint more potential in his first couple scenes (first church scene).  Mr. Boldwood is a little less emotional and his final actions more appreciable.  Vanity has a very important role in the book and explains some of Bathsheba's motivations and actions.  The 2015 version makes her perhaps more steady and capable, sharper and even more willing to roll up her sleeves and jump in the muck to work.  She is less vain, but still makes her human mistakes.  Sacrifice becomes a theme at the end rather than perhaps obsession for a certain character.  For a few purists, these may be deal breakers and my intent is to describe that for you also.  I do think this version is more adapted for a modern audience and I think even most Hardy fans will be pleased.  The emphasis on Bathsheba's strengths, more than her vanity, was no accident I am sure.  Most will appreciate that as the driving design behind this version.  However, purists should temper their expectations going in.",1434758400,181,5448,5.229527104959631
7152332,4,B00WSJL4JC,"Director Thomas Vinterberg provides a new version of Thomas Hardy's novel.  While I've seen the story originally set to film in 1967, it was so long ago I only remember Julie Christie who starred as Bathsheba Everdene.  In this version, Carey Mulligan (happy 30th birthday by the way) takes on the role.

Set in rural England around 1870, Bathsheba is a young woman orphaned as a child and raised by her aunt and uncle.  She has her own farm and essentially works it herself, determined to maintain her independence.  Her handsome neighbor, Gabriel Oak (Matthias Schoenaerts, ""Rust and Bone""), is a shy, single sheep farmer.  Frankly, nearly everybody is shy in this movie.  Based on the fact that combining the two farms would make economic sense, Gabriel asks Bathsheba to marry him.  It appears that there would be no ice cream dates, let alone a roll in the hay first, to see if they click.

Bathsheba, is a fiercely independent woman as is set to make it on her own, so politely declines.  Her fortunes seemingly improve when her wealthy uncle dies, leaving Bathsheba his huge estate and working farm.  At the same time, an accident kills all of Gabriel's sheep, the source of his income.  He's forced to give up his farm to the bank and sets out on his own, only to fall into the good graces of Bathsheba, who hires him as her shepherd.  While Bathsheba remains confident in her abilities to run the farm, she is somewhat of an oddity to the men and women of the community.  Her new neighbor is a rich single man, William Boldwood (Michael Sheen, ""Kill the Messenger"") who is at an age where he should be married and father an heir.  He's attracted to Ms. Everdene and after a formal meeting or two, approaches her with marriage.

Again, Bathsheba demurs.  The third man comes into her life wearing the red coat of a sergeant of the army.  Sgt. Francis Troy (Tom Sturridge, ""On the Road"") is like no man she's ever met.  While seemingly polite, he's also outgoing and aggressive, especially towards Bathsheba.  She's clearly smitten.  Having never been kissed before, she is and more.  They are quickly married.  She also soon realizes that she made a mistake born out of passion.  In an uncomfortable but convenient twist, her marriage ends and Bathsheba is once again in charge of her economic fate.

The film is beautifully shot by Charlotte Bruus Christensen showing glowing rolling hills, fields of grain and vistas of a setting sun.  Mulligan is well cast as the strong Bathsheba, showing her character's intelligence, grit and determination while at the same time giving her a comely naivet when it comes to romance.  Granted, the viewer would have to be blind to see where the film ultimately concludes and where the betting money goes as to her ultimate true love.  This is a wonderful costume drama.  Recommended, especially for fans of the genre.",1434672000,7,2863,4.738866396761134
7152333,5,B00WSJL4JC,"Thomas Hardy's classic novel ""Far from the Madding Crowd"" has been beautifully rendered in this 2015 movie. It stars Carey Mulligan as Bathsheba Everdene, a proud and independent young woman who insists on running the farm she inherits from an uncle.  She will be wooed by three men:  Gabriel Oak, a strong and honest shepherd; William Boldwood, a wealthy older man; and Frank Troy, a dashing and dangerous soldier.  Her relationship with each man will come to a critical point at a Christmas dance, a well-staged scene that is one of the highlights of the movie.

The storyline of the novel has obviously been compressed, but the movie captures all the essentials of the plot in a wonderfully executed period piece, much of it filmed on location in Dorset. The cinematography may worth the price of admission all by itself, finding all the rich hues in the landscape and in character costumes.  The movie also offers many perfectly staged camera shots, such as the ones of Bathsheba riding a horse over the fields.  The obvious point of comparison for this movie may not be the novel but its 1967 movie predecessor, which featured an exceptionally strong cast of first rank actors, including Julie Christie as Bathsheba.  The 2015 version does not aspire to those heights, but does well in highlighting Bathsheba's courage in choosing to run her own farm, and in her struggle to sort out her feelings about her suitors within the restraints and expectations of 1870's England.  The movie is highly recommended to fans of the novel.",1434672000,68,1532,4.888030888030888
7152334,5,B00WSJL4JC,"This was the second Thomas Hardy book I read as a teenager (""Return of the Native"" was the first). Wessex, his fictitious part of England, was as real to me as Sussex or Dorset, and a headstrong woman as the protagonist was right down my alley.

Working from Hardy's novel, screenwriter David Nicholls has provided director Thomas Vinterberg (""The Hunt"") with an elegant and accessible interpretation, which, along with cinematography by Charlotte Bruus Christensenan, gives us a luminous film with lovely, lovely scenes.

We watch:
  *  Carey Mulligan (""The Great Gatsby"") as Bathsheba Everdene; she is an intelligent, independent woman who has to choose among three suitors. This lovely actress is capable of gentle subtlety, so Bathsheba is both sincere and irresistible and we want the very best for her.
  *  Michael Sheen (""Masters of Sex"") is William Boldwood, a shy, well-established local businessman who becomes the target of an innocent prank.
  * Matthias Schoenaerts (""Lewis and Clark"") Sturdy sheepfarmer Gabriel Oak is as steadfast as his name. We see how a playful young sheepdog can visit devastating financial ruin on a farmer.
  * Tom Sturridge (""On the Road"") plays Sergeant Troy; there's something about a man in uniform....
  * Juno Temple (""Maleficent"" she was Thistletwit) brings us Fanny Robin, an unfortunate young woman who misunderstands the name of a church.

The movie industry in England has period filmmaking down pat. Whole villages exist for filming so authenticity is never an issue. You can lose yourself in the story and not worry about minutiae. I DID appreciate that the soundtrack matched the sound of hoofbeats, to what we saw on screen. You'd be surprised how often that is overlooked! AND our characters didn't have a Hollywood-scale wardrobe. We see familiar articles of clothing several times. A tip of the hat to the production design and wardrobe teams.

Yes, Katniss Everdine of the ""Hunger Games"" trilogy was named after Bathsheba Everdene, even though the spelling is slightly different.

This PG-13 film is for people who don't often go to the movies. You'll see no sweaty bodies, hear no profanity, experience just one (justified) gunshot and have someone to root for. I'm happy to see the release date for this DVD, I'm such a fan of Mulligan.",1434585600,124,2296,5.08

This version seemed hastily done an a bit disjointed. And I am just talking about the film versions, not the book. The latest version to me had no likable characters with the slight exception of Mulligan. And while the first film may have been a bit too long, this one was kinda brief and rushed for some sort of starry payoff. There were a few short scenes of cinematography but the music was lacking.

7152355,5,B00WSJL4JC,"At first glance, you may take this for another golden-hued Victorian-era fluff-and-pucker blanket o cheese, but this friggin movie marks the first time I said out loud, KISS, DAMN IT! Hey guys, turns out Im not completely dead. I have no patience -- or emotion, for that matter -- for romantic movies, but I... I... well, crap, I CARED about the love story in this movie. Its got the best movie kiss after Hitchcocks Notorious (and no dawg, I don't care for From Here to Eternity, because wet sand is no laughing matter).
I don't know THIS Vinterberg. Homeboy kicked off the Dogme movement with Festen and tested our comfort zone with The Hunt -- whose idea was it to bring an adaptation of a schmaltzy classic novel to Vinterberg? If you know Vinterberg, you know he likes to keep us guessing with his repertoire. If you're familiar with Vinterbergs style, youll see glimmers of him peppered throughout this movie in lighting, editing, blocking -- and even tone. Theres a starkness to the movie that whispers Vinterberg.
Can I just shake Charlotte Bruus Christensens hand, just once? The cinematography in this movie is haywire-gorgeous; the second the movie began I knew I was going to dish some dollars for the Blu-ray. She plays with colors, silhouettes, meticulously tempers space between actors and objects, and sweeps sparingly. I know the set was probably a mite too warm, muddy and gnatty, but I want to live in that world, specifically through Christensens lens.
And Matthias, oh, MATTHIAS, with his beautiful face like that of a world-weary Irish setter! Id seen fella in several movies, so I knew to watch this, no matter how sticky the sap. Had I known that I would fall in love yesterday at the Arclight, I would have done my hair a little different.
Again, I have to reiterate just how little space I have for romantic dramas. Im happy to admit that I watch most historical romance flicks in bare hopes that Ill get some gorgeous shots of rolling hills, comely gentlefolks decked out in insanely detailed costumes, but never do I expect to actually give a squeak about the love. This movie is one of The Cheesiest, one of The Most Eye-Rollingly Melodramatic -- so why does it work for this immoveable, bitter-ass moviegoer?
I can venture a guess:
1) The Mister Right in this movie doesnt say much. Early in the film, he makes his feelings clear for our protagonist, but he isn't a huge wang about it. He shuts the hell up and goes about, and that speaks to me, man. I wish all Misters Right would STFU with their backs turned, petting a border collie.
2) Movies of this genre tend to lean heavily on lines like, you could never understand!, Ill be lost without you, Ive never known a love like this, et cetera, damn-cetera. But so much ISNT said between characters. Theres restraint! Theres stillness! Theres a border collie!
3) And the border collie really drops the ball in this movie at one point. Some poor decision-making on the dogs part.
4) And our lady Bathsheba -- she's flawed up the wazoo and tearlessly admits it (her decision-making is almost as bad as that border collies).
Every single emotional beat lands right on time, even if they seem a little ham-handed. Its okay to snort, and you should absolutely take a shot for every movie clich moment.
I loved Celebration. I loved The Hunt. And now I love Far From The Madding Crowd. I cant believe these three films came out of one dude. Vinterberg is unpredictable, and weirdo delivers.

P.S. Specific to the Blu-ray: the description track for the visually impaired is very soothing. We could stand around and make jokes about why a visually impaired person would pay extra for a Blu-ray, but let's instead argue Schoenaert's shoulders vs Mulligan's dimples.",1522368000,,3736,4.730061349693251

That being said, Sturridge and Temple had wonderful chemistry which in the end is probably more important lol. As other reviews have stated this does differ from the book and the 67 movie in theme and ordering of plot. What I was left with at the end of it was a deep desire to have watched it as a miniseries instead of a movie. I think a miniseries would have lent some much need gestation to the relationships. Carey is striking as Bathsheba and Matthias Schoenaerts as Gabriel Oak was so heartwarming I sighed audibly at one point. If you, like me, love a good period drama and romanticizing hard farm labor much more than you should this is one to add to your list.",1520899200,,921,4.391812865497076

7152365,5,B00WSJL4JC,"I remember Thomas Hardy from my teenage years. I believe I read everything he wrote, quite without loving it, but being drawn to it anyway.  His dramas and tragedies just gripped me with sadness. He depicted with great clarity the randomness of good fortune, the possibility of all that could go wrong, and the seeming need for the cosmos to punish his leading ladies, who thought they could rise above it all.

The makers of this movie did get the point that Hardy makes in the book: basically, vanity will lose you all, and humility is necessary to save oneself and loved ones.  I saw an old version of this movie in black and white when I was a kid, and it left me with such a feeling of desolation--the beautiful melancholy music, the sheep with the bloated bellies waiting to die in the fields, the herd that hurtles over the cliffs, the lonely shepherd, the girl who takes too long to learn.  It was overwhelming for my young soul. To this day, the scenes often come to me during times of sadness.  This 2015 version with Mulligan is colorful, capturing Hardy's British countryside with a magical paint brush in a way the books never could. The themes are treated with a lightness that makes the suffering bearable throughout  (or have I grown up and become inured to hardship?). In the end, the viewer is left feeling hopeful.  A purist may not like this version, but I found it much easier to digest and would watch this 2015 version again.",1520553600,,1448,4.546153846153846

Cary Mulligan does a great job as Bathsheba, pulling off the difficult task of portraying a strong woman who makes mistakes but isn't brought down or defeated by them. The cinematography, costuming, and production design come together to create a lived-in, gold-tinted pastoral world that perfectly suits Thomas Hardy's story. The soundtrack by Craig Armstrong is uniquely gorgeous.

If you like Austen films or other period dramas, give this one a try. Courtly manners and lace are in short supply, but there's an independent heroine, a few great gowns, and even an officer in regimentals (swoon).

7152378,3,B00WSJL4JC,"Thomas Hardy is my favorite writer, and Ive read the book multiple times. Id have to say this movie is the Cliff notes version in comparison to the 1967 Julie Christie-Alan Bates epic.  I felt this version was dumbed down for a younger audience that might lack the patience for a version that was more faithful to the true-to-the era dialogue in the book. Other aspects of behavior felt modernized to the point of losing authenticity.  The cinematography was beautiful, but again, better in the other version. The biggest letdown here, though, was the casting. Carey Mulligan is a fine actress, and a decent choice. And yes, Julie Christie did have a bit of a 60s look when she should have looked a little plainer and Carey carried off the bare-faced, no hairstylist look more convincingly. Matthias Schoenaerts has the stoic, strong magnetism required for Gabriel Oak, but is a little watered down compared to Alan Bates. But they lost me with Boldwood and Troy, especially Troy.  This movie is Madding Crowd Light, the Lifetime-Harlequin version. To see the time period, hear the authentic vernacular, understand the lifestyle and the farm hands and their families and the emotional punch the book carries, watch the 1967 movie.

This movie was somewhat madding, which ought to be no surprise given the title. Rumor has it the book is far better, though I have not read it. I hope I would like Bathsheba's character better in written word. She's awful. First of all, who named her that?! After King David's mistress who contributed to the fall of the country and his kingdom? Cool... Secondly, she get's proposed to by super-hottie shepherd boy and turns him down. Which I understand, you can't marry a man you just met, but then the noble old bachelor tries to marry her too and she turns him down too. But THEN she totally falls for Sergeant ManSlut who already has issues because CLEARLY he's a good choice. Oh also, the sheep thing? Brings a super morbid new meaning to counting sheep. Who starts a film that way?! Anyways, bottom line, stubborn chick meets a couple of wonderful men, chooses the smooth-talking jerkwad. Blah blah blah, happy ending. But still. It was painful.

Too saucy.  She is so NOT period appropriate in this movie.  It was laughable.  It was painful.  Had to turn it off.

I don't know a lot about Thomas Hardy, but this movie (inspired by his book) seems utterly unrealistic... as if it were written by a fantastical city person with no idea about the realities of country life and the need for partnerships. Carey Mulligan's character, in my opinion, is an unlikeable brat, though I'm sure many are sucked in by the ""strong and wild woman"" aura the film projects.

I realize this film has many high reviews. I simply disagree. The character ""development"" is shallow and painful to watch. Mulligan's character makes selfish, impulsive and unintelligent decisions. I couldn't find any romance in it at all.",1488499200,8,892,4.900662251655629

7152463,5,B00WSJL4JC,"Its a rare movie indeed that only at its conclusion do we realize whether or not we were changed by the experience, or moved by it, or challenged or affected.  For me, John Boormans Excalibur was such a film.  So were Pulp Fiction, The Right Stuff, and, as I recall, The Graduate.  These rare experiences are partly how I gauge whether or not Ill eventually consider a contemporary film to be a classic.

Im not sure I can explain why I was so profoundly affected by Far from the Madding Crowd (2015), any more than I can successfully explain why I was compelled to buy a ticket to see the film in the first place.  Perhaps I saw it because I suspected that with this film the moviegoing experience for once might be more of a legitimate, genuine artistic challenge than a soulless business transaction.  This weeks Jurassic World will probably clear the billion dollar mark hurdle cleanly, swiftly, and easily.  But is it art?  Is a roller-coaster ride art?  Seven thrills, four starts, and one jump-out-of-your-seat?  Thatll be eleven bucks, please.  And did you want that with or without popcorn?

Produced by BBC Films and distributed in the US by Fox Searchlight, Far from the Madding Crowd was a movie Id been starving to see without even knowing it.  Adapted by David Nicholls from the 1874 Thomas Hardy novel of the same title and directed by Thomas Vinterberg, the picture has a relaxed and naturally rhythmic pace more suggestive of waves washing ashore than seconds ticking on a clock.  Interesting and mostly unexpected plot developments occur at intervals appropriate to mostly-faithful adaptation of a literary work originally published chapter-by-chapter, in serial form, in a British periodical.

It speaks highly of the filmmakers that having read the Thomas Hardy source materialyears ago, in a college literature classI still found myself being surprised by some of the twists and turns of the story.  This picture is like Merchant/Ivory without the fuss.

Briefly, the film encompasses the adventures of comely and independent young Bathsheba Everdeneyes, the character was an acknowledged inspiration for the popular Hunger Games heroine.  Bathsheba wants to succeed in a mans profession, in a mans world.  In this respect, Bathsheba seems fairly contemporary.  Fortunately or unfortunately Bathsheba cant seem to help attracting the amorous attentions of a succession of men, approximately 66% of whom do not have her best interests at heart.

Thomas Hardy took the title of his 1874 novel from a passage in a Thomas Grey poem, which reads,

Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,
Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;
Along the cool sequester'd vale of life
They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.

The term madding is used here as a euphemism for the contemporary frenzied, suggesting Hardys intention was to illustrate that a hot little time is there to be had in the rural areas of civilization as well as in the more dazzling and decadent urban areas.  And it is a measure of the pictures success that English farm life in the middle of the nineteenth century looks naturally compelling, likewell, almost like home, or at least a half-remembered dream, or a memory from an image in a childrens storybook from long ago.

Photographed with loving attention to rustic images and muted tones and hues, misty mornings and firelit evenings, the picture succeeds in transporting the viewer and persuading him that what is presented here is an accurate depiction of another time and place.  I was surprised to find myself longing to visit there.  I still do.

And the actors mostly perform admirable justice to the Hardy novel.  Actress Carey Mulligan as Bathsheba is a force of nature, challenging the weathered men on the farm at one point that she intends to astonish them by being in the fields before they're out of bed and still be at work long after they're asleep at night.  Its one of the pictures high points when the shepherds and farmhands, jokingly and with good nature, challenge Bathsheba to climb into the mud pit with them to help wash the sheep.  And Bathsheba accepts the challenge, happily and with enthusiasm, without an instant of hesitation.

Pretty rather than beautiful or lovely and rather resembling a more pensive and less-effervescent young Sally Field, to the viewer unfamiliar with Hardys work it might be confusing that so many men are so quickly drawn to Everdene, but Mulligan eventually captures the point handily:  She leads with her spirit, and that spirit grows on you.  By the halfway point, Mulligan as Bathsheba had most of the audience, including myself, in the palm of her hand.

As Gabriel Oaks, Bathshebas primary suitor, actor Matthias Schoenaerts is a stolid, laconic but not lurking countenance who, except for one key scene, misses the wry and quiet humor  of the character in Hardys original novel.  Still, the actor generates as much of a heartbeat as necessary, particularly during another key scene in which Oaks argues with Bathsheba.  During that argument, the language is so rich and beautiful that with lesser actors the aggression might well have come across as actors shouting lines of dialogue at each other.  Between Mulligan and Schoenaerts the exchange seems perfectly natural, and eminently believable.

As William Boldwood, Bathshebas older and more affluent suitor, Michael Sheen is all quirks and  twitches and ticksit looks like his costume itches.  Sheens the only actor here who seems vaguely out of place.  In some of Sheens best performancesas David Frost, say, or Tony Blairhe bases his characterizations on clever and canny impersonations of actual personalities.  In this film he plays his character in a manner rather reminiscent of Anthony Hopkins performance in The Remains of the Day:  Sheens Boldwood is so buttoned-up and unaccustomed to his emotional yearnings that he seems mentally unbalanced, trembling his lid prior to flipping it.

Tom Sturridge relishes his role as Sergeant Francis Troy, although the character seems, as in the novel, to have stepped in from an entirely different literary work.  Ostensibly stood up at the altar by his true sweetheart, the Sergeant turns his attentions to Bathsheba, and stirs an itch south of her navel with his dashing appearance and colorful military uniform.  Sturridge as Troy practically twirls his mustache and sneers his lines.  Should Manhunt, James Swansons superb chronicle of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, ever be adapted into a motion picture, Tom Sturridge would be an ideal choice for the role of John Wilkes Booth.

During a scene in which Troy oohs and aahs Bathsheba with his flashing sword, daring her to stand still while he whisks the point rapidly around and past her, you can practically sense Bathsheba palpitating.  But after the display I found myself whimsically wishing shed ask for a glass of water and in drinking it reveal, as in a cartoon, a hundred little leaks springing from her body, or collapse in a pile of individual slices, like a salami.
At the screening I attended, much of the audience actually groaned during the sword displaynot because the ruse itself was so inappropriate but because by that time virtually everyone present in the auditorium except the onscreen Bathsheba knew that of the three suitors Sergeant Troy would be the worst matrimonial selection, like Nell walking past Dudley Do-Right and into the arms of Snidely Whiplash.

As the nave young girl who accidentally strands Troy at the altar, young Juno Temple isn't given much to do:  Shes a cypher, a pawn, a plot device in the overall drama.  But later I was astonished when I realized Temple was the very same actress whod played the intellectually-challenged nymphet in the execrable Killer Joe.  I understood then what a departure this role and this film were from that tawdry trash, and felt a little more respect for the actress.  Thats high praise for a giant step in the right professional direction
.
Screenwriter Nicholls and director Vinterberg actually improve upon Hardys ending, accomplishing in one brief, charming, and unexpectedly playful scene what Hardy required two entire chapters of dry, anti-climactic exposition to do.  In the novel, Hardy seemed almost to be apologizing for the resolution.  I approved of Nicholls condensed version:  Hardy had removed any sense of heart and soul from his published denouement.  It was at that point in the film, the ending, that I ultimately appreciated how fully Id enjoyed the picture.

Comparing this new film to John Schlesingers star-studded 1967 version of the same story feels a little like comparing dice to dominoes:  These are two distinctly different animals.  The point is subjective but it seems to me the new version is far more compelling because a higher emphasis is placed upon characterization and authenticity.  Viewed from a contemporary perspective, Schlesingers film feels like a rustic melodrama enacted by a monolithic Mount Rushmore of 1960s British film icons.

Its a real shame Vinterbergs new version of Far from the Madding Crowd wasn't able to establish a more secure beachhead among the host of CGI-laden film fare this summer.  Id like to have seen the film again, possibly more than once, but by the time I ventured back the picture was gone, out of the local theaters.  Ill look forward to happily seeking the disc when its available.  Far from the Madding Crowd is a movie D.W. Griffith wouldve been proud of.",1487808000,,9481,5.026888604353393
7152464,4,B00WSJL4JC,"This is the Anti-Pride and Prejudice.  The most important line in the move is when the heroine says ""A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle.""  OK, she didn't actually say it, but she did tell two fine men who loved her and would have been fine husbands that the last thing she needed was a husband. I'm pretty sure she would have told Mr. Darcy the same!  I'm pretty sure every decent man out there sees the plot.  She then meets and immediately falls in love with and marries a perfectly horrible man who spends all her money. One of the decent men kills the cad (doing a service to humanity in the process) and he ends up in jail.  One is left guessing that she will end up with the other decent guy, but I doubt it.  She is pretty, and smart, and hard working, but her unwillingness to combine brains and love will probably follow her through life.
The move itself is beautiful.  See it.",1487376000,,899,4.222222222222222

7152474,5,B00WSJL4JC,"When I saw the trailer in 2015 I was intrigued by its elaborate story line and the lead characters strong chemistry.
I had not read the book or even heard of the story so I really had no idea what to expect. I got the DVD from the library and watched it on a little DVD player that was about 8 inches wide (that's what you have to do if you want to watch a movie by yourself in my house).

Anyway, I was a little skeptical at first but the longer I watched it the more blown away I was by the incredible acting, the beautiful landscape and the entrancing music that filled every scene with warmth, wonder and magic.
I cannot say enough about how amazing this film is. It was so well done. I moved me in a way I didn't know a film could. It is simply inspiring.

Immediately after watching this masterpiece I remember thinking ""Oh my gosh EVERYONE has to see this!"" So I went down stairs got my sisters and watched it again. No surprise, they loved it! And I have to say, I loved it even more after seeing it a second time.
A few weeks later I wanted to show it to my cousin, who doesn't normally like those kind of movies. She said she didn't think she would like it but she'd give it a shot.
Almost as soon as the opening came on (Bathsheba Everdene riding across the beautiful English landscape, the warm morning sun's rays making a glowing appearance over the country side and filling our hearts with awe and a renewed reverence for God's glorious creation. All while the most magical orchestra music you could imagine plays in the background) my cousin said ""I change my mind, I think I'm gonna like it.""

You have to watch this movie. It it is simply inspiring. I'm convinced there is something in it for everyone. This movie is made of the kind of stuff that legendary films are made of and it's definitely on my top five movie list.

Far From The Madding Crowd 2015
Les Miserables 1998
Ben Her 1959
Seven Brides For Seven Brothers 1954
Mamma Mia (come on! It's such a feel good movie!)

I also read the original book after watching. It was great, but if I'm being honest I liked the movie better, it gave you more of Bathsheba and Gabriel! After reading the book I was a little disappointed that he didn't write more about their relationship. But I would still recommend reading it. I really like Thomas Hardy so I read Tess Of The D'urbervilles. I was surprised that I actually enjoyed it. I don't normally like such tragic stories but it definitely gave me a lot to think about.
Okay I'll stop.
Bottom line, WATCH THIS MOVIE.",1486252800,,2534,4.315126050420168

7152574,5,B00WSJL4JC,"This is by far one of my favorite movies of 2015, and I watch it at least once a month. It's a quiet, subtle tale with strong themes. The film does differ from the book; however, I believe that given it is being retold in more modern times it simply incorporates more modern ideas of women and does not detract from the story or the message. Both Carey Mulligan and Matthias Schoenaerts give amazing performances, perhaps Schoenaerts being the most superior in the film. Even Michael Sheen's small, yet important role is strongly performed.",1471824000,,540,4.75531914893617

It is still in the player for lunch but now there are  so many features about this movie that makes it perfect for consumption at lunch time.  I LIKE IT NOW and likely to say it is one of my great ""man & woman"" movies.

Why?  Because the story is about a precocious--NO!--I don't want to use that word but words more like: arrogant, and presumptuous, even fool-hearted (young) woman and three men.  But very normal but not to be admired.  I was deliberately raised not to be like her.  (So,  I am definitely oppose to this type of female and I have called her ""fickle"" lots of times and didn't like it a bit how she treated Gabriel) but then it was not up to me to have a say: it was up to Gabriel.  He wanted her  bad enough to suffer her strife to be near her.  Not Gabriel was a real man in his character but I keep wondering if Barsheeba will ever love 'him' and not just have a 'need' for him.

I remember my mother telling me when I was a teenager NOT to be a female who played games with males or I would get hurt or they would get hurt: Somebody would get hurt, she said.  In this movie, she strings along three men and in the end: one is dead, one is in prison (could have been hung) and she is left to be with the third man.  (""Happily ever-after,""???)  Of course not.  She only wants to hold on to him to save her farm....and until another man comes along that she can string along and enjoy it.--MO",1467417600,,1551,4.0493421052631575

7152680,5,B00WSJL4JC,"This is another great adoptaion from the novel by Thomas Hardy.
Of course there is another same movie made by the legendary director John Schlesinger with the great lovable actor like Julie Christie starred but that one was a bit long and I had no courage to watch that one since I am watching two movies in one night usually a day and I am deadly tired everyday doing all kinds of things. This movie was a perfect choice to me and the result was a really a good.

You might be surprised who the director of this movie is. He made great movies like <THE HUNT>and 6 other features in his country Denmark. He is not a new director and this well made film <FAR FROM MADDING CROWD> is not a surprise mistake.
It is in his blood, experience that made this movie a great one.

Carey Mulligan and three other actors who loved her that are Matthias Schoenaerts(a sheep farmer), Michael Sheen (a wealthy bachelor),Tom Sturridge(a handsome and reckless Sergeant).
Among them from the beginning I wanted Matthias to be the one who finally acheive the love and it did happened that way.
It was a long long round about though to be happend that the love was finally acheived.

The scenary of the countryside was so beautiful and whenever there is a sunbeam, it's just blessing to watch the view. It's just the postcard view all by itself.

All four actors are so charming that I cannot say who is the best in this movie.

Carey Mulligan from the beginning when I saw her from the movie WALLSTREET 2, I liked her so much. She is not beautiful or glamorous or anything. but true beauty came from somewhere else. She is the woman that any man want to protect, love and be with everywhere he goes. This is her.
A fragile but somehow strong mannered, stubborn woman. sometimes looks like a kid.
In this movie, she didn't had to act, she was that charactor all by herself.

The final scene can be comparable with the movie <Pride& Prejudice> done by Joe Wright another classical masterful movie.
When finally Bathsheba Everdene (Carey Mulligan ) accepts the love of Gabriel Oak (Matthias Schoenaerts ) a humble sheep farmer who works for her. The only one who always stayed close to her and always helped her silently. As her guard, her servant, her friend and her secret lover.
When all the other men left, one died, one in a prison, he stood there and finally bacomes her true lover.
The sun is in the backside hails at their forever after love. Smiling at them, clap hands to them.",1461888000,,2465,4.491071428571429

This is a film with a big, complex story affecting many characters in a setting that is exquisitely beautiful.  Carey Mulligan shines as a strong and willful woman during the late 1800s when virtually all women had little say in their own lives and even Matthias Schoenaerts as Gabriel Oak does a fairly credible job -- at least better than his flaccid performance in ""A Little Chaos"".  However, this is an action film.  The story is told in action with little character development.  Scenes move and change swiftly, leaving one to wonder why people behave as they do.  In other words, there is great breadth, but little depth.  I often wondered why the characters made the choices that they did and often felt as though I was left hanging.  So whether you love this film, or simply like it, depends very much on what you want from a movie.  I watched it once, then stowed it away in my small DVD collection.  I probably won't watch it again for a long time.",1457740800,,1141,4.463768115942029

7152743,4,B00WSJL4JC,"I haven't read the book, but after reading some reviews online we decided to watch this on Valentines Day as our romantic movie night flick. I suspect that the film is trying to convey a lot more than what actually comes across, as it leaves the viewer wondering about many elements of the film. It is still a good watch, however the movie isn't so much a romantic film as it is a drama. The ending is very ""Pride and Prejudice"" and whilst it does end on a happy note it still leaves a somewhat depressed and melancholy impression. The heroin Bathsheba wasted her life by making bad choices, pushing away those who cared about her, and ruined two men's lives through her inability to commit and return their love. She comes across as self-centered, bratty and indecisive throughout most of the film, leaving the viewer with a poor impression of her and making it difficult to empathize with her plight. Her character is portrayed as being a desirable and beautiful woman, however the actress portraying Bathsheba is in actuality rather plain and average.

I went to see it on my only afternoon off...then promptly went to see it again the next week on my only afternoon off...then bought it.  Such a visually-gorgeous film simply insists that you come and see it again, then again.  The acting is completely superb.  The romantic tension between the main characters is instant and palpable.  I just keep asking my friends, ""Have you seen it? Oh, you need to!""  One of the aspects of the best in story is, to me, the honest struggle to find what's right, to wrestle with what we want versus what we probably SHOULD want.  Characters who are all lightness and goodness from the git-go aren't terribly compelling because they don't reflect real life, real human experience.  And when actors are able to portray that reality so well that you forget that they're actors, well, that's a satisfying movie experience.  And ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" is exactly that.

March Boy nominations: Cinematography

I watched the 1967 adaption of Far From the Madding Crowd by John Schlesinger and was thoroughly impressed. (I know its often derided as being dated and having a 60s unauthentic feel to it but I disagree.) My sister had seen the 2015 Thomas Vinterberg film in the theater last year and extolled its praises to the heavens saying nothing could ever top it. I thought Well, if its an improvement on a movie with a cast like Julie Christie, Alan Bates, Terence Stamp and Peter Finch it better kick some butt! So I saw this film and tried to keep an open, un-biased mind.

Its not by any means a bad re-telling of the story but I don't feel like Vinterberg really brought anything new to the table.

The best performance by far is Matthias Schoenaerts as the true-blue, through-thick-and-thin Gabriel Oak. To play a character of sheer goodness and not come across as smarmy or annoying is not an easy task and he nails it to a T. Michael Sheen is likewise effective as the neurotic Mr. Boldwood who gradually slips off the deep end due to his obsession with the heroine.

The rest of the cast however seem like paper dolls. Theyre not exactly terrible but the script treats them so bluntly and coldly as if the screenwriter was afraid to let them do anything to show off their acting chops. (Even the sword scene lasted less than a minute.)

Carey Mulligan is okay in the leading role but her overall demeanor and rich, low, voice is too mature sounding for a nave immature ditz like Bathsheba and shes not exactly the raving beauty one could see three men falling head over heels for. I understand Bathsheba slowly matures throughout the movie and learns from her poor judgment but the way Mulligan portrays her is as if she was already grown up.  Also some of her line readings sound monotonous. The way she reacts when her presumed-dead husband shows up at the party and gets shot after grabbing her is as calm, cool and collected as if were the most ordinary thing of the day.

Juno Temple (Fanny) on the other hand is absolutely gorgeous with those long locks of wavy blond hair and cute round facethe scene where shes in her wedding dress with the crown of flowers is absolutely breathtaking. Also, in Maleficent she did an excellent job playing a whimsical comic relief character. (one of the fairies who help raise Princess Aurora) I could EASILY SEE THIS GIRL sending a valentine to a total stranger and marrying a guy simply because he showed her a few tricks with his sword.

Tom Sturridge is a wooden as a plank as Troy and the movie goes to slow motion whenever he talks.

I will say, the cinematography is terrific in its vivid colors, the sets are nice and Craig Armstrongs music has a lilting air (especially the violin solo at the beginning) perfectly suited to the pastoral feel of the film.

Mind you, I didn't HATE this film. There was just nothing about it that wowed me.",1452297600,,2984,4.5797373358348965

Felt like a parody of these British period romance pieces -- I kept waiting for one of the Monty Python crew to pop in --  I guess it just wasn't my cuppa tea. Acting seems fine if mannered, the story seems incomplete, the scenery is lovely ....it just seems to bash around from scene to scene w/o much reason or emotional continuity. 200 dead sheep? A Christmas Party? Hopes dashed by silly woman? Dead woman & baby? Everyone reacts the same to each of these events. One carries no more weight than the other.

7152814,5,B00WSJL4JC,"I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this movie!  Despite my initial misgivings that Carey Mulligan looks physically nothing like the Bathsheba of the novel, her performance embodies the character through and through. The chemistry between Shoenarts is a slowly burning, hidden ember and true to the book, a gradual, growing attraction and deep mutual respect. The movie even captures the side characters and customs of rural life perfectly without belaboring anything. It is just there, deeply rooting the reality of the story in specific time and place. Wonderfully directed -- the director elides where it needs to for the shortness of a movie, but lingers where we need to in order to feel the emotions that are central to the story.

I was inspired to reread the novel after seeing this adaptation, and was delighted to discover how true to the book the film stayed. Some might believe that Bathsheba's strength and independence are a modern adaptation for a modern audience, but it's actually all there in Hardy's novel. There are so many examples and scenes, but one example from the book: ""Deeds of endurance, which seem ordinary in philosophy, are rare in conduct, and Bathsheba was astonishing all around her now....She was of the stuff of which great men's mothers are made...indispensable to high generation, hated at tea parties, feared in shops, and loved at crises.""  And as central as Bathsheba is, the story would be nothing if she didn't have a Gabriel who was her equal in strength and intelligence. His strength is utterly different from Bathsheba's, but that is why they complement each other, and Shoenarts's performance does just that. It's hard to project strength when your character is quiet and gentle, even patient to the point of long suffering, but somehow Shoenarts conveys all this and more with his physical presence and steady gaze. A lot of the movie's dialog also uses much of the dialog straight out of the novel, with some abbreviating for the pace of a film. (Ex: where she announces that she is mistress of the farm and dismisses her bailiff, and tells the workers that she is going to be up before they are, etc... from the book; when she tells Gabriel to ask her... and so many more, all from the book.)

Subtle, natural performances, a great script adaptation, insightful directing and editing, beautiful cinematography, gorgeous music... really a wonderful way to rediscover Hardy's novel -- or if you've never read it, to discover it for the first time in film form. (And I do hope it inspires you to read the novel!)",1449360000,8,2567,4.894252873563218

7152879,4,B00WSJL4JC,"This film had the potential to be a really good one.  It's easy to see where it goes slightly awry and that would be in the performance of Carey Mulligan in the central role of Bathsheba Everdene.  We are told Bathsheba is intelligent and independent but there's nothing to suggest that in Mulligan's reading of the character nor does she project the necessary magnetism to believe she would attract a plethora of suitors.  This isn't the first time Mulligan has been miscast in a screen adaptation of a classic novel.  See her work in ""The Great Gatsby"" as Daisy Buchanan.  Puzzling because she made such an indelible impression in ""An Education"" some years ago.  The film can hang its hat on three terrific performances by Bathsheba's suitors, Matthias Schonaerts as Gabriel Oak, Michael Sheen as Mr. Boldwood, and Tom Sturridge as Mr. Troy.  Schoenaerts is on a real roll if you haven't seen his previous work in ""The Drop"" and ""A Little Chaos"".  Sheen is one of our most underrated performers and doesn't disappoint here.  I'm not familiar with Sturridge's resume but the sky's the limit if you account for his work on display here.",1448150400,4,1136,4.7846153846153845

7153000,2,B00WSJL4JC,"2.5 stars A disappointment if you are new to the story- but luke warm for fans of period piece films.
Mulligan really bothered me in this role, which could very well be the fault of the director.  She has two lovely men and lovely offers for marriage- which she protests against, vowing to succeed as a single woman. Enter Troy- a slimy looking, arrogant squinty eyed soldier- who wields his sword and acts dangerously- then suddenly groping her in a completely unbelievable way for a man on his first encounter (who is love with someone else). This is what steals her heart (snickering in the audience) as she runs off, now happy to marry this soldier- who makes her miserable.
SPOILER
Don't worry- he commits suicide- or fakes it anyway, and later returns to swindle money from his wife- in steps brave man number 3 and shoots the soldier suddenly (weirdest dinner party ever) and then he literally walks down the lane and into the jail (more snickering from the audience), freeing her up to run to prospect number 1- (who looked more like a surfer than a shepherd), who was her true love all along. Very weak script writing. I suspect people who like the book will appreciate it more than I did, but this adaption made me never want to read the book.

The good in the film is the gorgeous settings, the homes and sunsets and views are lovely. The cinematography is stunning. Great costuming, as well. Just a poor script and unconvincing conflicts.

7153014,2,B00WSJL4JC,"Disappointing remake. The film is not nearly as good as the 1967 version. One of the biggest problems is that Carey Mulligan is totally miscast.
Bathsheba is meant to be an extraordinarily handsome ,vain woman who is impetuous and sensual. Mulligan has none of these qualities.
She is impish and cute , and although she does display an impetuous nature, she is in no way convincing as the passionate and sensual woman
described In Hardy's novel. She comes across as far too cerebral and childish. Unfortunately she is often filmed in highly unflattering light , which does not help in emphasizing her as a believable beauty. It is hard to imagine her as the woman who has such a magnetic affect on the 3 men in her life. This could probably be overlooked however if Mulligan projected a more sensuous nature but she does not. She is profoundly wrong in this role.
The other cast members are fairly solid but the drama in  many scenes is diluted because of the distracting cinema photography . The scene with the haystacks is too windy and chaotic and dark. The scene where Bathsheba first meets Troy is also too contrasty and dark. Interior scenes with rustic farmhands feel very cliched in their depictions of crowded rural life. In trying to be authentic to the period , the clarity of the storytelling suffers immensely. This sort of period styling has been done more adeptly by other directors such as Mike Leigh or Jane Campion.
Though I still feel this may not have been the right approach for this particular adaptation.
The film has some very nice outdoor shots of the countryside , but overall it is not made with a deft hand. So many of the scenes feel messy and visually similar. The costumes are not well done. The hats worn by Bathsheba at the exchange are purposefully awkward.
I would like to see this film made by a director who knows how to keep things simple. The storyline is already very dramatic and complex .
A ""less is more"" approach could have been used here, Hardy's novel is fantastic material - and as another reviewer pointed out, it is a novel that does translate well to film (as shown by the far superior 1967 version). I am very surprised by the good reviews for this mediocre movie.",1444867200,7,2215,4.621827411167513

I loved the outcome which included Bathsheba winding up with the good guy, Gabriel Oak, a sheep farmer whose character transcended his more elevated competition.  Sometimes a story simply takes too long to get to the best parts, but Far is full of situations that draw the viewer in and won't let go.  Loved it!

7153068,2,B00WSJL4JC,"didn't like story execution, didn't like cinematography, particularly framing, too many scenes shot in closeup for my taste, especially disliked it because the closeups were done before characters were established so felt storyteller was trying to force characters before the story adequately introduced them. Bathsheba is played by a beautiful young actress but when story begins didn't really see why she was remarkable, other than secondary characters saying so. In act one wish she would've done something, something braided into the story, something demonstrated in the story, to make her remarkable. To me she basically walks around looking beautiful with a choice of beaus to chose from but because the story doesn't properly establish her, I don't care as much as I should which male character she ultimately chooses for herself. It's the writer's job to make me care, and I want to care, but Bathsheba doesn't do enough to earn my concern; writer doesn't create enough opportunities, enough situations, for her to display her worth to the audience. beauty is not a story. acting is fine.",1443571200,,1096,5.19774011299435

The romances seem to feel a bit rushed along a bit, but I can imagine fitting 3 love interests into a 2 hour time frame is a bit difficult to do and still give the feel of the book.  This movie has a decidedly Jane Erye type of feel to me in how it is filmed.  That is not a bad thing as I enjoyed that movie and although I didn't like this one quite as much.  The scenery was beautiful and the movie had an authentic period feel.  The story itself was entertaining, although ending in a rather predictable manner.

7153135,5,B00WSJL4JC,"Danish screenwriter and director Thomas Vinterberg`s ninth feature film which was written by English screenwriter David Nicholls, is an adaptation of a novel from 1874 by an English 19th century poet named Thomas Hardy (1840-1928). It premiered at the 34th Istanbul International Film Festival in 2015, was shot on locations in England and is a UK production which was produced by producers Andrew Macdonald and Allon Reich. It tells the story about a singer from the county of Dorset in South West England named Bathsheba Everden who only has her education and a landowner named Gabriel Oak who only has his sheep.

Distinctly and precisely directed by Danish filmmaker Thomas Vinterberg, this quietly paced fictional tale which is narrated by and mostly from the main character`s viewpoints, draws a heartrendingly romantic portrayal of a cousin and how her life is altered after she receives a marriage proposal from a shepherd. While notable for its distinctly atmospheric milieu depictions, masterful cinematography by Danish cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen, production design by production designer Kave Queen and costume design by costume designer Janet Patterson, this narrative-driven story where an inmate at a Victorian workhouse named Fanny Robin is soon-to-be married to a soldier named Francis Troy which was made one hundred years after Women`s Suffrage was introduced in the Kingdom of Denmark, sixty-seven years after the National Assistance Act 1948 was introduced in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and where an English actor named Michael Sheen utters the words: Successful through your kindness, I wish to tell you. I am profoundly grateful.  depicts multiple interrelated studies of character and contains a great and timely score by composer Craig Armstrong.

This conversationally and cinematographically poignant character piece which is set in England in the late 19th century and where the story revolves around the mysterious ways of the compatibly mysterious human heart, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, rhythmic continuity, comment by Fanny: I thought you said all s not all s and by Bathsheba: It is difficult for a woman to define her feelings in a language chiefly made by men to express theirs. and the genuinely revering acting performances by English actress Carey Mulligan and Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts. A majestically equal narrative feature.",1442620800,,2491,5.515706806282722

The preview looked good, and I am all for strong, independent female characters, but I'm sorry, Bathaheba was just a bitch.

She started off promising, a hard working girl with ambition.

She meets Gabriel Oak while horseback riding, they stare deeply into each other's eyes, and in the next scene he asks her to marry him. Ok...? I know things back then were different than now, but maybe they could get to know each other a bit? He offers her unconditional love and she says no.

He then loses all his wealth and she inherits a farm and suddenly she is all above him and too good for him.

She sees some old guy, William Boldwood, in church and the market, they stare deeply into each other's eyes, and so she decides to toy with him by sending him a Valentine (what is this, 2nd grade?) Gabriel tells her not to, as William has been hurt in the past, and she gets mad at him for being the only one willing to tell her the truth. She tells him to leave, but lo and behold, in the next scene she suddenly needs him again and asks him to come back. Manipulative bitch. In the next scene William asks her to marry him, she says no. Sound familiar?

In these 2 instances, the men seem to think that their greatest ambitIon in life will be to make her their wife simply on the basis that she is pretty. She refuses, not wanting to be owned or controlled by a man. Such mixed feminist messages here. But it only gets worse.

Along comes  Sergeant Frank Troy, a soldier whose previous fiancee had showed up at the wrong church on their wedding day. Ok... I know they didn't have cell phones, but wouldn't they at least go looking for each other afterwards?

But never mind that, because he too must fall hopelessly in love with Bathsheba. He sexually assaults her in the woods, and she falls for him because he has a big sword and knows how to use it. Obvious symbolism there, as in their names as well (Bathsheba is a seducer, last names of the other men Oak and Strongwood? Come on.)

Anyway, having finally found someone who can ""tame"" her (so much for independent woman), she marries him. Gabriel tries to warn her not to marry him, but she says hysterically ""you don't know him!"" (Because after having sex with him once, she is an expert)

Frank turns out to be a jerk (they deserve each other) and sees his fiancee at the market, tells her she is nothing to him, and leaves. He promises to help his ex fiancee, but she dies giving birth to a child (his?) After that he is presumed dead. Boo hoo.

William swoops in and once again offers to marry her. She asks Gabriel what to do (because now she apparently needs a man to tell her and wants his advice). Frank Troy returns, still a jerk, and William shoots him.

All the while, Gabriel has been in the background, loyal, hard working, honest. He tells her he is leaving for America and suddenly she wants him. ""Why didn't you ask me to marry you?"" She asks (Because you turned him down?) He has a chance to leave with his dignity intact, but instead he kisses her and it is presumed they end up together. Ugh. He deserves so much better.

I honestly don't understand why all these men are obsessed with her, she's not even that pretty and is a complete bitch to them. For a movie that starts off with a feminist tone, the message in the end is that it doesn't matter how much you use and manipulate men, as long as you are pretty, they will all want you.

Can I have the past 2 hours of my life back?",1442534400,21,3532,4.288721804511278

7153153,5,B00WSJL4JC,"My most favorite genres are suspenseful drama/shoot-em up action/superhero/sci-fi [guy movies] as opposed to chick flicks, however I am a sucker for a good emotional timepiece movie (Sense and Sensibility) or dramatic romance (The Lake House, Age of Adeline). And this movie delivered for me. Set in England, it is full of quirky characters with genuine feelings that manifest in sometimes rather odd-seeming ways. The leading lady is fiercely independent on the outside in words and actions, yet with immature tendencies and an inner struggle to feel sure of herself as she struggles to make various life decisions. As such, she finds herself in situations that lead to both romantic and tragic conclusions. The three leading men in the story are completely different in temperament, yet have one thing in common (although for differing reasons): a fascination with the leading lady. For the storyline to completely work, you must assume more passage of time than the movie necessarily portrays. The other thing the movie arguably lacks is the back-development of the characters so you can fully understand WHY they act/think the way they do. I say arguably because it wasn't a problem for me to fill in the blanks and round out the characters in my mind, although it may bother some. However I found the movie enchanting, heartbreaking, romantic, fanciful and thought-provoking as I watched it initially in the theater by myself, and later at home with my husband. It will be one of my go-to watch again and again movies..",1442361600,,1524,5.051587301587301

That aside, I adored this film and liked the fact that it seemed so contemporary with a very independent lead played by Carey Mulligan.  (See her in the second Wall Street.)  I was VERY impressed with Mathias Schoenaerts who played Farmer Oak.  Not only is he a skilled actor in my opinion, I loved the role of a man with true integrity and the ability to love for the long haul.

The acting was pathetic, there was no chemistry or emotion on anyone's part (with the exception of Mr Boldwood), good grief, they even cut the tombstone scene, and Fanny and Frank's argument outside the church.

7153180,5,B00WSJL4JC,"""Far From the Madding Crowd"" is the fourth novel by and first success of British writer Thomas Hardy, first published in a single volume in 1874. Its title refers to the setting of the story which is 200 miles from London, which was certainly by the late 19th century a noisy and overcrowded metropolis. By contrast the setting is in rural England among mostly farmers and merchants in small towns. The present film is an excellent adaption of one of the high-spots of English literature conveying well both its setting, time and sensibility.

The story centers around a woman who comes into an unexpected inheritance and how she navigates the romantic affections of three male suitors. Bathsheba Everdene (Carey Mulligan), not long into the film, receives the inheritance of a large farm from a passed-away uncle. Her first suitor, Gabriel Oak (Matthias Schoenaerts), is a sheep-raiser and herder who awkwardly makes his affections known. He is an independent entrepreneur and neighbor of Everdene who loses his stock and livelihood when one of his shepherding dogs goes crazy and forces the sheep to their deaths. As a result, he becomes a wandering worker-for-hire. Oak is soft-spoken but resolved, exhibiting subtle confidence in who he is and his knowledge of livestock.

Her next suitor is a 180-degree shift from Oak, William Boldwood. Boldwood is the wealthiest landowner in the surrounding county, possibly landed-gentry, but it's never made clear whether his wealth is from inheritance, business, or a combination of the two. Despite his wealth and prestige, the fine clothes he wears can't hide that he seems uneasy with himself, despite his name ""Boldwood"". He is not very confident around women, and when he becomes enamored with Everdene, his means of making his feelings known are worse than Oak, being uneasy and bashful. Despite being worth many times the other two suitors, he is the least confident of the three.

Sergeant Frank Troy (Tom Sturridge) is the most outwardly outspoken and seemingly confident of the three. While courting, he often dons his military uniform of bright red, the colour of British military. When a previous engagement to another woman fails, he seeks Everdene. Of the three, at first he appears to be the most successful in winning her affections, especially in a scene where he brandishes his sword in front of her. However, as events play out, the ""confidence"" of Troy is not all that it seems, and Everdene begins to see another side of Troy.

This is an excellent story about people living in rural Victorian England and the struggles of balancing both relationships and farming. While certainly the premise is somewhat fantasy in terms of three suitors vying for the affections of one woman, the storyline and characters never lapse into clich. Also, the acting is first-rate, and I could see academy award nominations for the leads, particularly Carey Mulligan as Everdene. The photography is excellent with the lush English countryside in the background. Not to be missed if you enjoy movies such as this.",1442016000,3,3058,5.061507936507937

7153286,5,B00WSJL4JC,"In an era where Marvel, CGI and all things that go BOOOOOM have dominated the big screen, i'm just so glad this gentle, beautiful movie had it's chance to make it's way to the theater. This is just so gorgeous, and almost eerie as to how the scenes matched how I visualized the scenes in the book. It reminded me of how accurate and beautiful season one of Game of Thrones was: It was like Thomas Vinterberg just scooped up words from the book, and spattered them all over the movie camera and went ""Viola.""  My only complaint was that it was hurried a bit. Things whipped by in a flash. But, I understand time and budget constraints for movies, so the truncating of the story didn't hurt the tale in any way. It was just that I could have watched a much longer movie (or binged watched a mini-series) because  I just loved it so much and didn't want it to go away so fast. The casting was perfect. Carey's portrayal of Bathsheba came across as a much sweeter, intelligent and revolutionary person as contrasted to the book version where she seemed a bit more bratty and arrogant (in the begging, of course). I also loved how the portrayed the affections between her and Oak through out the movie. You saw how she felt like she missed her chance and was over compensating for her true feelings. She also portrayed how her self confidence was slowly being etched away by the selfishness of Troy, Boldwood and the general sexist society of her era. Tom Sturridge's portrayal of Troy as an entitled, arrogant, selfish person was masterful. Considering a lot of the truncating of the story came from his story lines, his screen time really shined. Matthias Schoenaerts showcase of respect and  sympathy towards Boldwood was award winning. It was a subtle thing in the book, and to have great actors like Matthias and Michael Sheen (who's like...scary good in anything he does) flesh out their friendship was just...class.
The last thing to say is the scenery. Oh. My. GOOD!!! It's like...LORD OF THE RINGS MAGICAL up in Wessex. Again, it was creepy with the accuracy with  the framing of the environmental scenes and backgrounds matching Harding's words.",1441152000,,2150,4.6798941798941796

I was disappointed in the lead actress, or the writing for her character.  One
minute she's resolute about needing no man, to letting herself be pushed around
by an army deserter.  I haven't read the book for a good long while, maybe it's
time.  Oh, and I thought the leading man was amazingly admirable without
being cloying about it, he just got on with ""it,"" whatever it was.",1440892800,2,457,4.548780487804878

 (SPOILER-ALERT, maybe) It started out fine.  As others have said, the scenery was fantastic, and the portrayal of the earlier time-period was well-done and interesting.  The problem was that the more the movie unfolded, the more I found myself disliking the female main character.  So by the end of the movie, when I felt like we were being prompted to root for her and to cheer her on, and to wish her a happy ending, that I didn't!  I didn't think that the male lead deserved an UNhappy ending getting stuck with her!

We see the heroine going from an independent and willful woman determined to make it on her own, to foolishly falling for a weak man who doesn't even love her in too short a time without proper buildup. It just isn't realistic, maybe those who read the book will enjoy this more but I found it difficult to watch and not very well done. The photography and filming though is outstanding.",1440720000,,576,4.342592592592593

7153341,3,B00WSJL4JC,"I love the book ""Far From the Madding Crowd"". And I really liked the 1998 miniseries staring Paloma Baeza and Nathaniel Parker. The new movie, although it had good actors, was just ok for me. The novel is too complicated to really work in a 2 hour movie. If I hadn't read the book it would have been hard to follow the story line and really get the full impact of the overall story. It also seemed disjointed and didn't really flow well. I thought the acting was fine but the pacing and what they had to leave out threw everything off for me. I don't think the characters were well developed like in the book and they didn't have the same connection with each other on screen. The build-up of emotion was lacking and the maturing of Bathsheba and her repentance for the devastation she had caused in other peoples' lives because of her choices was lacking. If you really want to enjoy this masterpiece by Thomas Hardy, read the book. If you want a more faithful and well done movie adaptation rent the 1998 miniseries.",1440720000,8,1018,4.449197860962567

7153369,2,B00WSJL4JC,"I was looking forward with great anticipation viewing this movie. The original Far From the Madding Crowd is one of my favorite movies. I felt disappointed in the new version, however. The writing was not nearly as good as the original, and especially not as good as Thomas Hardy's writing. Some of the best, most romantic lines of all times were left out. I felt that the writers were constantly in a hurry to race through the movie as they wanted to cut it short. Perhaps they were appealing to modern day viewers who do not appreciate the beautiful writing and filming of the first film. Julie Christie and Alan Bates were superb in the original film and captured for me Bathsheba and Gabriel.

I didn't think this one would be able to top the 1967 John Schlesinger film with Alan Bates, Terence Stamp and Peter Finch (what a cast!!!!), but it did a miraculous job and goes head to head with the original classic. I never repeat watch films, and if I do, several years must pass before I want to see a film again. I watched this movie three times in one month!  The cinematography, mood, energy, editing and ambiance of this film is very 1970's foreign film great. Superb job by Danish director Thomas Vinterberg. Also, actor Matthias Schoenaerts is exceedingly talented and HANDSOME.",1440374400,2,767,4.8106060606060606

7153407,3,B00WSJL4JC,"I had decided beforehand, to do my best to watch and enjoy this famous story, without constantly comparing every facet, with the 1960's iconic film version, and it's equally famous lead actors. I failed. Although it is 50 years since I saw the original, ( not even on TV), each ongoing scene provoked my memory, and I ended up making a mental comparison till the end. I'm afraid the one for one comparison was not in favour of the latest release. Had I not seen the original Blockbuster 1960's film, with it's huge budget, that allowed the story to breath more, I would have enjoyed the new film much better. I always regard the (usually) negative comparisons made by those who have, 'read the book'--first, then complain that it has been trashed by film script writers---with distain. I kind-of understand that now. The opening 10-15 minutes is very depressing, with apparent endless darkness and gloomy skies. After what appears to be permanent sundown, the sun actually shines. My main criticism is the casting of Cary Mulligan as Bathsheba. Cary is a very talented and pretty  Actress, there is no doubt--but, with her very slight figure/stature, and girl next-door cuteness, I think she was miscast. We are supposed to believe ,that 3 mature men, simultaneously, fall at her feet (metaphorically speaking) and completely lose all their self control by revealing their intense rivalry for Bathsheba, like schoolboys on a first date. To believe that, it would take an actress with a 'Cleopatra' like effect on men; stunningly beautiful, fearless, not easily impressed, and totally independent in an age of servile women.  Golden girl Julie Christie, came much closer to that description. Combined with other icons of the time--Terence Stamp , Alan Bates, and Peter Finch, it was a tough act to follow, even after near 60 years. Ironically, and perhaps with bad timing, the original film which had been newly restored, was put out on re-release in UK cinemas,  virtually at the same time. My final conclusion is that, this very good film, looked like, and in my opinion, should have been, shown on TV, not the 'BIG' screen.  P G Croft  UK",1440374400,2,2140,4.900552486187845
7153408,4,B00WSJL4JC,"It's based on a book by Thomas Hardy (which I kind of want to read now), it's not your cookie cutter / typical romance. It's a beautiful and historical setting, a la Pride & Prejudice.  The actor who plays Gabe is gorgeous and Carey Mulligan did a great job, they had great chemistry together. The other actors are fairly well known as well. There are some sad things that occur, but I'm not too sensitive, so I enjoyed it.",1440374400,,423,4.3544303797468356

Come all you fair and tender girls
That flourish in your prime
Beware, beware, keep your garden fair
Let no man steal your thyme
Let no man steal your thyme.

For when your thyme, it is past and gone
He'll care no more for you
And every place where your thyme was waste
Will all spread o'er with rue
Will all spread o'er with rue.

The gardeners son was standing by
Three flowers he gave to me
The pink, the blue, and the violet true
And the red red rosy tree
And the red red rosy tree.

But I refused the red rose bush
And gained the willow tree
That all the world may plainly see
How my love slighted me
How my love slighted me.",1439683200,,877,4.0813953488372094

A book I have not read, so I will not be making any comparisons there. I can only comment on the film.
Which it was incredible.
I didn't want to like Bathsheba. She was full of making the wrong choices and you couldn't help but want to scream at her while watching. She does have a lot on her plate though. During a time when women were pressured to be quiet and know their place as a wife, with nothing more.
Gabriel.
He gets the gentleman of the century award! Quite a character, and I found myself rooting for him the whole film. No joke. He is the kind of character that ladies swoon over.
The ending made the whole movie. It was so beautiful that I cried happy tears. Yep. Sweet like sugar it was.

They interaction between these three characters is so beautifully done that feel you are right there with them.  I have never seen Mathias Schoenaerts before this but I will definitely look for his past and future works.  Carey Mulligan is amazing as always and you can feel her struggle with independence and the possibility of sharing her life.  Michael Sheen is always wonderful and especially poignant with showing his feelings for Miss Everdene.  All three main characters are wonderful together and I applaud the casting director for seeing this.  Of course there isn't a proper love story without a bad guy and Tom Sturridge is perfect in this part, you automatically hate him for his cunning ways.  This turned out to be such a wonderful movie that it is now one of my top ten.  Thank you for telling such a beautiful story.",1439510400,,1058,4.801104972375691

7153534,4,B00WSJL4JC,"There are not nearly enough adapations of Thomas Hardy novels in the last two decades, and perhaps justifiably only two of his novels manage to get a face-lift more often than others: Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Far From the Madding Crowd. But, hey, I'm not complaining, since they're two of my favorites. This latest version of Far From the Madding Crowd certainly satisfies my Hardy craving. Everything - from the pastoral scenes, the cast, and Bathsheba's costumes - is astonishingly beautiful, beauty that feels pure and restrained. I love the subdued color palette, and the cleverly obtrusive way that the locations sets the mood for the scene, as if they are characters of their own. The music was wonderful and emotionally-charged, and even brought tears to my eyes in one particular scene near the end.

Gabriel Oak is definitely one of the top contenders for my favorite male characters in a classic novel. True to his name, he is as sturdy and reliable as an oak, and as pure and righteous as the angel, Gabriel. He often serves as a voice of conscience for Bathsheba throughout the novel, and I loved that scene where he is following behind her on the road, warning her about Troy. I think, for the most part, Matthias S. embodied the character well, working magic through his soulful eyes. I certainly liked him better here as Oak than in A Little Chaos, but I have to say though that Nathaniel Parker's portrayal in the '98 TV adaptation is still the closest to how I imagined the character while reading the book.

Sturridge's Troy is handsome, arrogant, immature and complex. The scene of him standing in the forest in his blood, red uniform made him out as a stark contrast to the unblemished surroundings. He's a new and unknown element, offering passion and excitement.

Mulligan's Bathsheba Everdene and Sheen's Boldwood are just perfect for me, nuff said.

I just wish it was an hour longer. Understandably, you can't fit such a dense novel into two hours without shedding weight, but I felt a disconnect at the beginning with Oak's proposal because it lacked the contrast in Bathsheba's character: He had witnessed her haughtiness in primping herself on the road, but then she had rushed into save him when his cabin caught fire. Fanny Robin's ties with Boldwood is also completely dismissed, and his descent into insanity barely glossed over, so that when the climax arrived, I felt slightly disappointed with the lack of impact it gave me.

Great film that was wonderfully acted, but could afford bulking up rather than paring down. I'm sure the audience would not complain about having to sit through another half hour. The entire film was shot beautifully and I regret my decision to purchase the standard DVD rather than the Blu-ray version. I'm glad they chose a less ambiguous route for the ending this time around as well. Definitely replay worthy and worth your time and money.",1439164800,3,2909,4.833333333333333

Adaptation from literature to film allows for alternative interpretation; a differing emphasis on events and motivations; additions and deletions to make it more contemporary, all this because film does not convey to an audience the same story as text from which it came. They are two different beasts. With that thought it's apparent that Everdene uses people to her own end. She will step on whomever if they are a hinderance to her self (ishness) means, whether Troy, Oak, Boldwood or any others. We see it repeatedly though out the film with her allegiance changing with the tide of fortune. Not to downplay or excuse the dogged pursuit by males, but more so then that they are just a product of their times.
The final whitewashing of this script's plot is the moral omittance of her not speaking up for Boldwood. Rescued from a threatening situation it is her testimony that could save a life, but as before she walks away.

I just expected a different level of tension and chemistry between the farmer and Bathsheba; the sort you experience when you're incessantly tormented by the all-consumption of your own puritanical and loyalist conviction not to satisfy your most intense desire. If you've ever seen the movie 'Splendor in the Grass' you'll know what I'm talking about. Great effort, but falls a bit short for me.",1438819200,5,609,4.922330097087379
7153571,5,B00WSJL4JC,"Thomas Vinterberg directs this immensely successful adaptation of the classic Thomas Hardy Novel, adapted for the screen by David Nicholls (Great Expectations, Tess of the DUrbervilles, One Day, Starter for 10, ShakespeaRe-Told). Blessed with a pitch perfect cast and a cinematographer (Charlotte Bruss Christensen) who understands the landscape that plays such a huge role in Hardys story, this is one of the finest adaptations of a classic work to hit the screen. It is wise to remember the meaning of the word madding is frenzied.

Hardys story, set in Victorian England, is that of an independent, beautiful and headstrong Bathsheba Everdene (a perfect Carey Mulligan), who attracts three very different suitors: Gabriel Oak (the very handsome and gifted Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts), a sheep farmer, captivated by her fetching willfulness; Frank Troy (Tom Sturridge), a handsome and reckless Sergeant; and William Boldwood (Michael Sheen who shines in this role), a prosperous and mature bachelor. This timeless story of Bathsheba's choices and passions explores the nature of relationships and love - as well as the human ability to overcome hardships through resilience and perseverance. There are so many moments of sharing the disparity between those who have money and land those who don't that it becomes a very socially timely piece.

The supporting cast is excellent and all the other aspects of the film work very well. Very Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, August 15",1438819200,2,1487,5.377682403433476

7153580,4,B00WSJL4JC,"There are many thoughtful reviews here that consider Hardy's novel, the 1967 film and 1998 BBC mini series versions of Far from the Madding Crowd that are written about this recent film.  This is another one of those situations where it becomes nearly impossible to resist comparison, but seeing every version of Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights, Pride and Prejudice, Madame Bovary, Anna Karenina, Great Expectations and so on, in addition to reading the novels, taught me much about the wonderful necessity within the film world to revisit these novels and underscore their relevant aspects that define them as classic.  It is marvelous to see them blended with techniques of their particular film eras and the particular eye and intelligence a director uses to develop each one.

Hardy had a lush appreciation and reverence for many of the beautiful aspects of rural farm life in the late 19th century England and great empathy for the hardships connected to it.  Far from the Madding Crowd was Hardy's homage to the apex of a healthy moment in agriculture structure just at a time when it was all poised to fall apart with the entrance of farm machinery, such as the horse drawn device for turning hay, that would replace manual labor and send that population into urban areas and into factories.  This point does not emerge especially in this film and it is unfortunate as it places Hardy as writer who perceived the difficulties of this and other transitions that would change the well being of English citizenry.

The missing star in this review has to do with this absence and with the too little time spent with the hapless misfortune of Fanny.  Hardy had heartfelt concerns for the plight of women such as Fanny and this film backs away from them, but he also had a prophetic sense of the emergent competence women would begin to embody and this film brings that forward.  It is a very interesting Bathsheba that Carey Mulligan has fashioned and visually, this is a terrific film that one will enjoy seeing more than once.",1438819200,,2030,4.813218390804598

7153582,4,B00WSJL4JC,"**EDIT:  Since watching this a second time, I've slightly edited my rating & review.**

Period/costume dramas are my favorite genre, and I've enjoyed some of Ms. Mulligan's prior performances (P&P 05, Bleak House, Northanger Abbey).
Admittedly I haven't read the book yet, but I am familiar with the story.  I've watched the 1998 BBC miniseries twice **Starring Paloma Baeza, Nathaniel Parker (Gabriel Oak), Jonathan Firth (Sgt. Troy), and Nigel Terry (Mr. Boldwood)**.

Probably the biggest problem that a book with 58 chapters faces, is being condensed into a movie format/time frame.  In most cases, books of this length are better left to a miniseries length.  This story is no exception!
I'm curious to know from an actual reader's standpoint, if this format of ""FftMC"" fits all their expectations?
Just in comparison to the 4 pt. miniseries, there were bits of story and characters that were left out in this.  And some of the character interaction wasn't given enough time (such as with Fanny & Sgt. Troy).

Because of rushed timeline, I felt a bit disconnected from the leads at times.  Bathsheba, seems a little more wise and worldly than she should.  The best I can describe is she's a bit like Lydia Bennet (Pride & Prejudice), and Becky Sharp (Vanity Fair).  Sgt. Troy is very much like Mr. Wickham (Pride & Prejudice), and Rawdon Crawley (Vanity Fair).
As for the other two leads-- Mr. Oak, and Mr. Boldwood (or a more fitting comparison-- her loyal sheepdog, and a lamb being lead to the slaughter); if only they could move on to someone more deserving!  For 2 of the 3 men, things end badly.

The biggest positive this movie has over the miniseries is the ending.  The miniseries was so underwhelming in that respect, building up almost 4 hours, to not even one peck between them!  (Although if we're going to get technical, the mini seems in line with the end chapter: www.online-literature.com/hardy/madding/58/ ).

Major props to the costume designer!  I counted around 30 different costumes for Ms. Mulligan herself.  I don't think I've ever noticed that many different outfits in a period movie for 1 lead.  My best guess for this, was that her clothes were an extension of her character-- namely her vanity.
The cinematography, scenery, and locations, were also top notch!

Overall, I was left with an impression, rather than a clearly defined and detailed glimpse of the story.
While I do think there could have been some improvements, and added length, I can  recommend this for those that like period dramas in general.  But advise those acquainted with the book- it may be a bit disappointing.
If you're looking for a more detailed adaptiation, check out the '98:  imdb.com/title/tt0157616/

If you want to know more about life (and farming) in the Victorian era, I recommend the BBC docu-series ""Victorian Farm"":

She is utterly charming at the end, which is more effective in the film than in the book.

7153591,5,B00WSJL4JC,"Despite the spectacular scenery and evocation of the bucolic agrarian life Thomas Vinterberg exposes the hardship and perils of the agrarian life. Bathsheba the main character and heroine is intelligent, independent, determined, but also foolish headstrong, nave, impetuous and vulnerable. However, her flaws don't detract from her as an admirable and sympathetic character even when the strength of mind she often shows goes missing. As a feisty example for a woman of her times she overcomes gender disadvantage and male condescension. The story also deals with the tribulations faced by women and their vulnerability to men during the 19th Century. Fannys story within the story is heartbreaking.
Each of the men enacts different forms of masculinity. Boldwood is the traditional upper class patriarch, emotionally troubled who brings about his downfall. However, he is also a sympathetic character as he is fundamentally decent. Sergeant Troy is shallow, selfish, predatory and vulgar. His symbolic rape of Bathsheba with his sword is particularly resonant with modern audiences, many who are familiar with Freudian psychology. He too brings about his own ruin, and although he is less sympathetic than Boldwood his does elicit understanding as he is a doomed and tragic figure. Gabriel Oak embodies the values of loyalty, honesty and responsibility, but where he really shines is in his intelligence and superiority to other flawed males. Despite the story centring on the heroine Bathsheba, his is the real hero of the story as Bathsheba recognises his importance in her life at the close of the story and that he is truly her equal.
Despite being a slow burning film its riveting story is beautifully edited; a stand out feature is the dialogue. Viewer gain a strong sense that capable as she is Bathshebas tragedy is foreshadowed as inevitable.",1438214400,3,1852,5.28135593220339

7153598,5,B00WSJL4JC,"What a splendid and engaging period piece which I was so drawn to. A hard-fought dramatic and very feeling love story of an independently spirited young woman, Bathsheba Everdene (Carey Mulligan). Based on the Thomas Hardy novel and directed by Thomas Vinterberg from the screenplay by David Nicholls, ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" was a breathtaking experience and an enchanting view of which I couldn't look away from. The meaning of the title featuring the word ""Madding"" being mainly archaic now, but actually meaning 'acting in a frenzied manner' - usually used in the phrase 'madding crowd' to denote especially the cluttered world of human activity in all of its strife. It is from this world that Bathsheba's farming type life strayed far from. Not having read the novel, this was my introduction to the story of Bathsheba Everdene and her three suitors as they each come into her life. All of the characters were fully fleshed out and their personalities jumped off the screen individually while Bathsheba, because of Carey Mulligan's dedicated portrayal, reached new heights. An orphan raised by her Aunt and Uncle, after his death she inherits his farming property and stretches forward to run it as her own mistress. Being fiercely independent, Bathsheba exclaims that she will not be ""some man's property"". Beginning in Dorset England, circa 1870, some two hundred miles outside of London, Bathsheba will make this farm all her own as she takes command of her livelihood, property, staff and each man desirous to make her his wife.

In the days when merging two farm properties together through a marriage consolidation was looked at as the most fortunate of investments, Bathsheba rejects her first proposition which comes quickly from neighbor Gabriel Oak (Matthias Schoenaerts). He is a humble, handsome and extremely helpful sheep farmer who loses the entirety of his livestock in a grievous accident. Finding Bathsheba again at a later time, she hires him for his hardworking ways and his personal care of her farm which is apparent to be to the degree of how much she cares for it also. She meets another man who is wealthy, middle-aged and certainly ready for marriage, Mr. William Boldwood (Michael Sheen). He also encourages Bathsheba to make a possible marriage for reasons of love and to combine their properties once again just as she meets the third rival for her hand in marriage, Sergeant Francis Troy (Tom Sturridge).

Long after a mishap with Troy's 'Sweetheart', Fanny Robbin (Juno Temple), the Officer is an extremely handsome sight in scarlet with golden adornments and has a certain quality of being somewhat dangerous which is appealing to her. Will Bathsheba finally be tempted by this stately man? or possible rogue? As the film began with her being self-reliant and not committed to any man, Everdene works a prospering farm and is boldly establishing a place of work for many which she loves and is fierce about keeping it free from any other's surname. She wins her staff over with good and honest ways but also warns, ""Don't suppose because I am a woman I don't know the difference between bad goings-on and good"" especially when it comes to payday.

This movie was worth the ticket just to see the stunningly atmospheric and picturesque landscapes (Charlotte Bruus Christensen), the huge white crested and rolling waves along with the lovely farming community and period costumes. Beautiful orchestration and delightful strings (Craig Armstrong) score the views that can literally take your breath away and Carey Mulligan sings a lovely rendition of, ""Let No Man Steal Your Thyme"" along with Michael Sheen joining in towards the end. She does sing it another time over the end credits. I haven't read the book or haven't seen the original version of this story, so I came in thoroughly fresh to the experience. I was familiar with Thomas Hardy's ""Tess of the D'Urbervilles"" which was amazing in my opinion if difficult to view in places. This is when I discovered that Thomas Hardy's writings introduced the phrase ""Cliffhanger"" to modern-day writings but mainly, to the cinema now. ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" was pure enjoyment from beginning to end and a look into how a strong woman during the Victorian era moves through relationships, love and unflinching ambition with resilience and the desire to remain her own mistress on her own terms.",1437955200,13,4388,5.024725274725275
7153599,5,B00WSJL4JC,"Despite the ad copy on the cover, the Blu-ray ""Extended Ending"" is actually an alternate ending, one of 10 deleted scenes.  Thomas Vinterberg is one of the best directors alive.  His previous film _The Hunt_ is fantastic.  The casting of Far from the Madding Crowd is perfect, and so is the cinematography.  Unless you don't like the story Thomas Hardy told, I can't see how anyone could fault this gorgeous, perfectly acted, and perfectly edited film adaptation.  it is far superior to the Adaptation starring Julie Christie and Adam Bates.  The only problem with the novel is its happy ending.  No one does depressing quite like Thomas Hardy, and Far from the Madding Crowd is seriously depressing.  The happy ending feels rather compromised, but Vinterberg manages to film the ending spectacularly.  I actually had a tear running down my right eye.  Carey Mulligan should get an oscar nomination (and win it).  The costuming is also amazingly good.  Oscar nom there.  Matthias Schoenhart should also get an oscar for best actor.  If you liked Vinterberg's The Hunt, you will like his Far from the Madding Crowd.

7153601,3,B00WSJL4JC,"I was disappointed with this film which was  pity because it's one of my favorite books. I was expecting deviations from the literature but it felt like the story was cut in strange places, for time perhaps? (Spoiler Alert) The denouement of the triangle where Boldwood takes care of Troy was especially poorly edited. It felt like a huge chunk of material was cut which would have helped to make more sense of the scene.

I admire the work of all the actors involved but I also feel that Mulligan, Schoenart and Stoppard were miscast. Bathsheba is an altogether more wild and strong-willed character--verging on wicked and scandalous, two characteristics hard to capture in Mulligan's sweet face; not to mention that Hardy's physical description is closer to Catherine Zeta Jones (who is a little beyond the role in age). Schoenart's character is meant to have a face, ""like an open sun,"" with curly blond hair. Schoenart brought more darkness to the role than I imagined Hardy had in mind. He's more kindred with a Heathcliff in sensibility than a Gabriel Oak. Stoppard is too young and callow to command much sexual heat--at least in this role. He seemed less like a solider and more like an arrogant high schooler.

With all this said, taken apart from the source material, it is a beautiful film. The cinematography, locations and costumes were all gorgeous. I would be interested to see what someone unfamiliar with Hardy would make of it.

I cannot heartily recommend it but will definitely watch it again to see if it improves with familiarity.",1437868800,29,1552,4.845283018867924
7153602,1,B00WSJL4JC,"After viewing the several trailers, I have absolutely no interest in seeing this version of the classic Far from the Madding Crowd. That it should even presume to compare itself to the 1967 release is laughable; there  seem to be some fine actors like Michael Sheen in the newer version who have wasted their talents trying to pull this movie out of the fire. There are several films that should never have been remade and this is one of them; has hollywood lost all its creativity and must rely on re-makes?

7153611,4,B00WSJL4JC,"Whats it about?

Intelligent, independent and beautiful Bathsheba Everdene (Carey Mulligan) inherits her uncles farm and is determined to astonish everyone by making it prosper. As she pursues her goals, she also navigates the courtship of three men: a shepherd, a soldier and her wealthy, mature neighbor.

What did I think?

I haven't read Thomas Hardys novel, on which this is based, so I came to the story fresh. And it was excellent. It reminded me of a Merchant Ivory production, but it was grounded by the many hardships of the time and didn't stray into sentimentality. Its worth the price of the ticket just for the lush scenes of rural English life, but I was also entirely caught up in the story. The characters, particularly Bathshebas suitors, might have easily been one-dimensional stereotypes, but they were fully-realized and beautifully performed, and the subplots were just as affecting as the central focus on Bathshebas pursuit of a life of integrity and purpose, without compromise. I think I may have to read the book!",1436486400,10,1040,5.0

7153613,5,B00WSJL4JC,"This is an excellent screen adaptation of the Thomas Hardy novel.

If you enjoy this genre of movie- British period romance/ drama- this is a ""must see"".

It has everything you are looking for in this type of movie: the classic Hardy tale of love and angst, gorgeous British countryside, uniformly excellent performances from the ensemble cast, a sensitive music score, and a well written screenplay.

Well worth seeing!",1435795200,8,420,5.057971014492754
7153614,5,B00WSJL4JC,"Id never heard of the 1874 novel or its author, Thomas Hardy, until I saw the preview for this.  After reading the story synopsis and some reviews, I thought itd be worth seeing the movie, and I enjoyed it.  It takes place in Dorsetshire, and the cinematography is very beautiful.  Taking this film on its own merits (I cant compare it to other filmed versions or the book which Ive never read), I found it an uplifting experience, rooted in the moral character named Gabriel Oak, whos played with strong and quiet virtue by Matthias Schoenaerts, a Belgian actor.  Leonard Maltins online review of the movie says This movie offers him another great showcase and presents him as a world-class leading man.  Actress Carey Mulligan enhances the quality of the movie by giving some human depth to the fanciful and foolish woman, whose name is Bathsheba (the name reveals that shes an untrustworthy character before you even begin the story!).  The casting, acting, and directing were skillfully done in this film production, adding realism that I could emotionally invest in.  As a lover of folk music, I enjoyed the parts where the workers of Bathshebas estate have dances and songs.

Even all those components wouldnt have made me stay interested, though, if Schoenaerts hadnt played Gabriel Oak with such dignity and moral discernment.  His very presence keeps me oriented to the story much like Hugh Jackmans portrayal of Jean Valjean in the 2012 Les Miserables film.  Gabriel Oak is a shepherd who now has to work for Bathsheba after his sheep panic and run off a cliff in a storm.  He likes and is attracted to Bathsheba, but faces the reality that shes not willing to marry him, and he moves on emotionally.  Later, he shows strength of character by rebuking her and giving her wise advice, even though she promptly fires him afterward (which he probably expected).  When she wants him back to resolve a crisis, he comes back to work for her only after she shows some humility toward him.  He reminded me very much of the Bibles account of Jesus, in that he was extending friendship to her and giving her moral advice, but also backing away from her when she didn't want it, yet always willing to forgive her when she messed up her life and was repentant, though he would not be bound emotionally by her if she didn't want it.

Her folly is sometimes maddening to watch (the titles word madding means frenzied, whereas maddening means very frustrating).  This is because of the story, not the actress.  She glibly rejects the idea of marriage to Gabriel and to a nice gentleman named Boldwood because she feels itd make her just property, but then falls for the flattery of a man named Troy who just wants her for her physical beauty.  The wrangling of the characters, vying for her affection, is generally civilized throughout the movie (there is a gunshot, though), but though it got a little boring for me, I kept paying attention to how Schoenaerts would portray Gabriel Oaks reaction to the goings-on, and I remained very interested.  The beautiful cinematography was also wonderful.  The movie 12 Years a Slave (2013) had a very similar way of making the countryside look lush and semi-artificial, but also sort of realistic.

The take-home value for me with this film is the grace (unmerited favor) extended by Gabriel Oak to Bathsheba, which finally pays off.  I like it when stories like this or Puss in Boots (Puss initiates good actions for his master out of kindness) speak to a greater spiritual truth about God and nature.  It also helps when movies have equal attention to artistry and realism, which this one does.  Instead of sounding like they're reciting lines, it sounds like they're having real conversations.  A lot of period movies feel kind of fake, and this one feels more realistic, at least to me.  Therefore, Id recommend this movie for the excellent acting, cinematography, and the moral value of seeing how Gabriel Oak (played by Matthias Schoenaerts) handles situations with the unwise character of Bathsheba.  I became more emotionally invested in the movie than I expected to, and also got more out of it!",1435536000,17,4141,4.8039492242595205
7153615,4,B00WSJL4JC,"""Far From the Madding Crows"" (2015 release from the UK; 119 min.) brings the story of Bathsheba Everdene (played by Carey Mulligan) and her suitors. As the movie opens, we are reminded that it is ""Dorset, 1870 (200 km. out of London)"". We see Everdene riding her horse and it becomes clear that she is a free spirit and fiercely independent, so much so that she quickly shuns the marriage proposal made by her neighbor Gabriel oak (played by Matthias Schoenaerts). Their fortunes go in separate directions: Oak loses his farm after a horrific incident (I'm not going to spoil), while Everdene inherits a big farm upon the passing of her uncle. Not long thereafter, a new suitor (played by Michael Sheen) arrives on the scene. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is of course just the latest big screen adaptation of the classic Thomas Hardy novel. Why is a new version needed? Two words: Carey Mulligan. In a span of just 6 years (since her appearance in 2009's ""An Education""), Mulligan has skyrocketed to the very top of the actresses list. In ""Far From the Madding Crowd"", she appears in virtually every frame of the movie, and in essence she carries the movie on her shoulders. When Everdene inherits the farm, she addresses the farming personnel, promising to outwork everyone, and adding for good measure: ""I am going to astonish you all"". Both Everdene the character and Mulligan the actress certainly do. Of the three suitors that Everdene has to deal with, Gabriel Oak as played by up-an-coming Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts has the better part of the three. Oak is a good guy all around, and you just can't help but root for him. Schoenaerts, with outstanding roles in Bullhead, Rust and Bone, and most recently The Drop, plays Oak perfectly. This guy is clearly going places. Michael Sheen and Tom Sturridge play the other suitors. The photography is pure eye-candy from start to finish, and with the movie having been shot on location in Dorset, it feels like a 2 hour commercial for the region. Last but certainly not least, there is a wonderful orchestral score, composed by veteran British composer Craig Armstrong. Also featured in the movie is a drop-dead gorgeous rendering of the traditional song ""Let No Man Steal Your Thyme"", which starts out with Carey Mulligan solo (and on piano), and later joined by Michael Sheen. Turns out that Mrs. Marcus Mumford has a beautiful singing voice herself!

""Far From the Madding Crowd"" has been playing for weeks now at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. I had been wanting to see it but for reasons too long to explain, I only got around to it this weekend. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at was PACKED, much to my surprise given it's been playing for weeks already (and tilting heavily towards seniors, I might add). It looks to me like this movie is becoming a genuine hit on the art-house theater circuit. If you are in the mood for a romantic drama that is pleasing to the eyes and ears, with a stellar performance from Carey Mulligan to boot, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Far From a Madding Crowd"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1434758400,7,3224,4.734875444839858
