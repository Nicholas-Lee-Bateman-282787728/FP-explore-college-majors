8009616,5,B0001BKAMQ,"Dame Judi is stunning in this depressing film. She is beautiful, flirty, coy, secretive and very, very sexy. But, while I loved watching her interact so sexily, the film was very sad. Maybe it was the era the film was made about or the time it was filmed, but I cried for Imogene and wanted to slap Otto silly.",1381708800,2,310,4.271186440677966
8009617,5,B0001BKAMQ,"It is fun to see Judi in something that one might not expect from her, but she did a wonderful job in this movie.  Certainly nothing like some of her more recent movies.",1231632000,3,169,4.121212121212121
8009618,4,B0001BKAMQ,"This is a fine example of earlier work by Judi Dench, Jeremy Irons and Annette Crosbie in a Harold Pinter BBC2 Play of the Week from 1977.
The story is about two sisters who live in their ancestral Irish home in genteel poverty, bored and trapped.
Enter the young student (Irons) and an opportunity for the sensual Imogen (Judi Dench) to express herself.",1199232000,6,354,4.634920634920635
8009619,3,B0001BKAMQ,"Judi Dench is a beautiful, fantastic and versatile actress. This movie was too dark, too sad and I wanted to pluck her from that place and that story.  I wanted to place  her in the beauty of England - amongst the sun and birds and flowers and trees.

I have alot of  her other movies, but this one didn't pull at my heart strings.

A loyal and happy fan of Judi Dench!",1170720000,4,369,4.069444444444445
8009620,2,B0001BKAMQ,"This movie may be worth watching for its two stars, Judi Dench and Jeremy Irons. The story was slow and difficult to understand, though. Scenes appeared disconnected and the audience was given far too much responsibility to figure out the connection. I never did.",1152835200,9,263,5.0
