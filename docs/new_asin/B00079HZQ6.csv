2206682,3,B00079HZQ6,"BLIND HORIZON starts out remarkably well, establishing a deep sense of mystery and foreboding.  Val Kilmer stars as a man found half dead in the desert, and who has amnesia and can't remember his past.  However, he has flashes of memory that intimate the President of the US is going to be assassinated.  Michael Haussman uses flashback scenes effectively, but after a while, the movie falls in on itself in its lack of substantiation for its actions.  It's not hard to figure out why Kilmer must know this information, and it's also plain to see noirish Neve Campbell is not all she appears to be.  The subplot of Noble Willingham (as Deputy Cash) and his illegal activities does little to enhance the plot and perennial Sheriff Sam Shepard tries hard to bring some life to his role, but the movie become simply ludicrous once the assassination plot's secrets are revealed.  Just who is Faye Dunaway and what does she have to do with anything.  So as not to spoil the movie's climactic moments, I can't go into the details as to why the movie fails, but up until that point, it's a tidy thriller...it just doesn't end up being a good one.",1118534400,2,1139,4.608910891089109
2206683,5,B00079HZQ6,"Choice. In the end, that is what this film comes down to. It is the ultimate moment in the climax when the choice is made... and... well, you'll have to watch it yourself to discover the 'next' part.

Val Kilmer play a great role, weaving in out from amnesia as well as sounding a bit slow on the uptake. When he becomes insistant that his attack has something to do with an upcomming presidential assination attempt, pieces of the puzzle begin to drop. Enter Neve Cambell, his fiancee although he does not remember her. She tries various things from pictures to talking to coax herself back into his memory but nothing seems to work. Not when he is focused on conspiracy.

Or the beatiful nurse... Amy Smart, who has taken a liking to him.

With several people involved in this smart thriller, the stakes are high. Yet, the suspense is what makes this movie the keeper. There isn't any real explosive action or violence. This film is more plot driven and relies on some character development to propel the action.

When the end approaches, it becomes clear who is who, and who everybody thought everyone else was is not as predicatable. With a stunning performance by Cambell, this film offers up really good jobs put in by an A and B list of actors.

While not so Blind to the viewer, Blind Horizon offers some thrilling insights into the confusion of the human mind.",1116720000,5,1369,4.594262295081967
2206684,1,B00079HZQ6,"'Blind Horizon' stars Val Kilmer as Frank, amnesiac patient found at New Mexico desert, near the town of Black Point.  Because of the wound inflicted by a gunshot, he severely suffers from a headache and memory loss, but Frank somehow 'remembers' something very important concerning the US presidential campaign.  In fact, it might possibly be a plan to assassinate the president.

Despite the bad script and acting, the name of the actors are pretty impressive.  In addition to Val Kilmer, they include Neve Campbell (Frank's girlfriend), Amy Smart (nurse who fell foe him), Sam Shepard (a sherif), Noble Willingham (his deputy), Gil Bellows (Frank's doctor), Giancarlo Esposito (a nosy journalist), and special appearance by Faye Dunaway.

[VERY CONFUSING WRAP-UP] Some may rightly say that anmesia has been already used too much in thrillers in the past, and is no longer a way to interest the jaded eyes of the moviegoers.  But the real problem is not that here.  Though the initial situation surrounding the main characters are fairly intriguing, the film soon loses its course, and meanders into the series of confusing flashbacks and unnecessary subplots while the main plot itself about Frank and the truths about his past is no secret to the fans who can easily foresee the results.  What is the meaning of the numbers on the card?  Who are these two heavies in suits?  Most importantly, who am I?  To most of you, it's an easy guess.

The film is not only predictable, but confusing as it goes on.  Many suspicious-looking characters turn up -- that's ok -- but none of them make sense after all.  Someone please give me a reasonable explanation as to, say, the identity of Faye Dunaway's character.  Or, why did Frank have to be shot in the first place?  What's the motive?  Speaking of which, what do these people want to do?  Except the nurse worrying about Frank and the local sheriff investigating the case, no one seems to know what they are doing.

Director Michael Haussman (known for his music videos including Madonna's 'Take a Bow' and many commercials) certainly gives stylish images, but none of them help to engage our attention, as there is nothing that makes you want to know more about the 'mystery' or characters. Though some supporting actors are doing pretty good jobs (especially Amy Smart and Sam Shephard), the acting of the two leads is not good, and the dialogues poorly written.

This is a typical case of films coming from Lions Gate Films/Millennium Films.  It shows at some film festival, then disappears, and turns up on cable TV or as straight-to-video.  I don't say these company's films are all bad; still, it is also true that when I see these logos, my heart starts to sink, sensing something onimous coming.  This time, my instinct proved right again.",1115856000,4,2797,4.866807610993657

The fine direction from Michael Haussman compliments things nicely. This movie is like a film noir.
It is dark and smoky, and this reflects the cloudy vision of Val Kilmer's character who has amnesia and is trying to figure out who he is and what has happened to him. He remembers something vaguely about this place, a border town, which seems to be in the middle of nowhere, and the President of the United States. Some things seem predictable, but then it takes a turn here and a turn there.

2206691,3,B00079HZQ6,"""Blind Horizon"", an amnesia action/mystery with some 'big name' stars, went straight to DVD without ever being theatrically released, so many have 'written it off' as a lousy film; but if you give it a chance, this is actually a very entertaining little gem!

Directed by Michael Haussman, the distributor, Lion's Gate, dissatisfied with the rambling 'director's cut', brought in ace film editor Alain Jakubowicz to punch up the film, and his re-cut gives the movie an edgy, fast-paced 'look', reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"", especially in the central portrayal of Val Kilmer's ""Frank Kavanaugh"". A likable 'lost soul', shot and left to die in the desert, who knows vague details of a plot to assassinate the President, he gradually discovers he is not a 'nice' person, and is, in fact, a key player in the high-level conspiracy. But as with Harrison Ford, in ""Regarding Henry"", his amnesia offers him an opportunity to 'change' his whole persona...if he can survive the attempts to silence him, and conquer his own instincts as a 'hit man'.

Blessed with a first-rate cast, ""Blind Horizon"" offers many intriguing supporting portrayals, from a likable local sheriff (Sam Shepard), and his politically ambitious deputy (Noble Willingham), to the mysterious 'fiance' (Neve Campbell) Kavanaugh can't seem to remember, and the beautiful nurse (Amy Smart), he'd LIKE to know better, to a mysterious 'contact' (Faye Dunaway), who drifts in and out of his dreams, with missing pieces of the puzzle. Kilmer is, as always, eminently watchable, capturing both the innocent and unsavory sides of Kavanaugh very effectively, and making his climactic actions worth waiting for.

Of special note is the film score, written by the collective group of composers, Machine Head. Working with non-traditional instruments, the 'sound' is both musical and mysterious, and ideally suits the film's ambiguity.

""Blind Horizon"" certainly deserves a look, as a film far better than it's ill-fated history would indicate. I enjoyed it, and I think you will, too!",1160524800,9,2050,5.279141104294479
2206692,2,B00079HZQ6,"I'm still not sure what happened at the end, and I don't feel inclined to watch it again. The plusses? Well-photographed with some nice moody Tex-Mex scenes. Sam Shepard I liked as the friendly cigar smoking sherrif. Val Kilmer was OK but it would have killed him to wash his hair? The female roles were OK and predictable. The American movie industry again tries to persuade us that a multiple killer/assassin hired to shoot the President; who in one flashback kills a man in front of his child; and in another murders a victim in a confessional, is just a little misunderstood and needs the right woman to set him straight. Aw shucks who couldn't forgive that toothy grin.",1133740800,2,674,4.6722689075630255
2206693,2,B00079HZQ6,"ichael Haussman's over-directed conspiracy thriller takes place in a small desert town in New Mexico and recalls a bad episode of The X-Files, with Val Kilmer as an amnesiac Mulder to Sam Shepard's Cigarette-Smoking Man. Frank Kavanaugh (Kilmer) wakes up from a coma and starts having flashbacks that lead him to believe that the President of the United States is going to be assassinated. Among the shady lot of characters occupying the man's periphery: Faye Dunaway's Ms. K, who may be mediating the plot against the President; Shepard's small town sheriff, whose cowboy hat isn't to be trusted; Neve Campbell as the grieving girlfriend; and Amy Smart as a fidgety, chain-smoking nurse. Naturally, nothing is what it seems. More specifically: The more conspicuous the behavior (like, say, smoking inside a hospital room or wearing an unexplained bandage across one's nose), the more blameless the person. Beyond Horizon is no fun, not so much because of all the rote tricks up its sleeve, but because of a flashy aesthetic that doesn't so much bring to mind an indie-minded In the Line of Fire as much as it does a Hollywood thriller like The Ring that's predicated on all sorts of loud noises and flashing images. Every time Frank has a flashback, it's the equivalent of watching someone piece together a 500-count puzzle. Haussman, whose most famous work to date is Madonna's over-bloated ""Take A Bow"" music video, doesn't exactly afflict his protagonist with amnesia. By the looks of it, he caught whatever Patricia Arquette had in Stigmata.",1132531200,,1546,5.04296875
2206694,3,B00079HZQ6,"Blind Horizon

I bought ""Blind Horizon"" on DVD because Val Kilmer is one of my favorite actors.

Val Kilmer gives a great performance, as Frank, who suffers from amnesia after being shot. Not knowing anymore who you are must be really frightening. But the character he is playing is not the most likeable, so I couldn't really be sympathetic. There are no scenes that touch on human emotions, like in ""Heat"" or ""Thunderheart"", my two favorite Val Kilmer movies.

What makes the movie interesting and entertaining is its complicated plot, the many flash backs, twists and turns, the many questions it raises from the beginning on. I have to admit I needed a second viewing to finally understand most of it, to figure out all the connections between the different groups of people and the parts they are playing. Some questions may still be left open. This movie will keep you busy trying to put the puzzle together until the end.

There is also included the obligatory love story between Frank and Liz, the nurse, which is nice but for my taste this connection was not developed in a natural way, which makes it look a bit unbelievable. There is not a single scene where the two get closer, have some serious talk before she flings her arms around his neck and asks him to come with her.

There are a few more scenes that are quite unbelievable and strange. Like when Frank gets shot at the beginning of the movie he jumps from a fairly high cliff. Nobody can survive such a fall without any broken bones.

For my taste there is also too much smoking in this movie, quite inappropriate smoking, like when the nurse (Liz) smokes next to the patient (Frank), who is connected to oxygen and then barely puts out her cigarette in the chamber pot and leaves it there smoldering.

Later Frank tries to drink and smoke back his memory.

Anyway I recommend this movie to anybody who likes a complicated plot and do some serious thinking.

Another interesting movie with a quite complicated plot is ""Mindhunters"", which I enjoyed watching a lot.",1130803200,3,2035,4.662011173184357
2206695,2,B00079HZQ6,"He's shot on a remote arid pasture of New Mexico. Loses his memory. Wakes up on a hospital cot with all these flashes, you know, US president being assassinated by snipers and all that jazz. No one quite comprehends what White House has to do with this forlorn desert but that's the rote mystery of it all.

Intriguing setup? Well, borderline. But the execution is so flaky, so pseudo-MTV like, it annoys more than it entertains. Strange characters spring up periodically for no rhyme or reason, accompanied by high octane outbursts of sepia and B&W -- flashbacks one concludes.

All of which resolves into a painfully deja vu plot. Every time a clue comes up it feels like a stray clip from a Depeche Mode video. The experience is grating, not so much for all the adoloscent 'twists' up its sleeve, certainly not for a lack of top stars (Val Kilmer, Neve Campbell, Sam Shepard), but for its aesthetic predicated on sudden bass thumps and scattershot imagery.

In other words, a loud B-grade thriller that induces amnesia in its audience faster than its own protagonist could try and remember.",1125878400,2,1093,4.772486772486772
