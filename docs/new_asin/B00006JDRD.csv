7969929,2,B00006JDRD,"I checked this book out from the library and had to keep stopping while reading to pause at the gobsmacky weirdness of this book.

It reads like an old scooby doo episode with an irrelevant cameo.",1322697600,,196,4.444444444444445
7969930,5,B00006JDRD,"My 3 kids aged 7,5 and 3 loved this Arthur episode. They were already fans of the Backstreet Boys, so I hoped they would like this video. Fun story about the music business. You had to wait till the end for the BSB's to perform though, except for snippets of the videos in the beginning. There was also a bonus feature that showed the real BSB's rehearsing the song you hear in the movie.",1223942400,2,388,4.256756756756757
7969931,5,B00006JDRD,"Years after its release, this show has aged very well -- amazing for a story based on pop culture. It starts out with a story and script that are above average for the already high quality level of most Arthur shows. The longer story format allows for a bit more plot development, which makes for a more interesting show without getting bogged down. The soundtrack is very well done, and the music performances are excellent. Who knew that these kids could rock?!

This is a special program (they call it a ""Movie,"" at just under an hour) that can't fit in a normal half-hour PBS broadcast time slot, so you might never catch it on TV. I'm so glad I saw the reviews here and bought the DVD, because I would never have known about it otherwise. In my opinion, it's worth getting the DVD if possible, mostly because the sound will be superior to that of a VHS tape (and the sound matters more than for most Arthur shows).

Like others, we didn't really know much about the Backstreet Boys before seeing this. Well, they sound great. They really add to the overall experience of this show, but without really dominating the storyline at all. The kids, and the lessons they learn, are the center of things -- which is as it should be.

The DVD has some fun bonus features. I do not know if any of these pieces are also aired when the main ""movie"" is shown on TV. Although they're just the usual ""making of"" background snippets, they're fun and add to the DVD experience.",1179532800,2,1466,4.442379182156134
7969932,5,B00006JDRD,"I love the Backstreet Boys and I like Arthur (and I'm 27...ye gods...)  I figured this would be kinda cute to watch.

It was absolutely adorable!

The Boys aren't in it a WHOLE lot, so don't buy it expecting to see a LOT of them.  The music in the episode is great for a cartoon, and it's a good watch for any BSB or Arthur fan!",1170892800,2,328,3.9242424242424243
7969933,5,B00006JDRD,"I saw this show on PBS when it aired,and it is a good show. It is good for the Arthur fans and for The Backstreet Boys fans too. If you like Arthur and his friends, and the Backstreet Boys , this is for you.",1056672000,6,207,3.727272727272727
7969934,5,B00006JDRD,"I rented this from my library and just loved it. Poor Muffy is having to deal with a snobbish friend that calls the backstreet Boys 'sellouts'. Soon we see all the kids trying to start their own bands starting with ""U Stink"" and even ""We Stink!"" Even when Nick and Muffy get stuck in an elevator, everything works out for all involved.
I thought that it was a nice film. It starts out with Muffy watching the Backstreet Boys in live action on her TV. The intercut with animation and live action.  It was one of the best likenesses of a group ever put into cartoon form... This has made me a new Backstreet boys fan. I am 31 years old and I just adore this one. It takes those that want to remember back to a time when we had a crush on our idols...
I hope that Marc Brown does another show like this. It would be interesting to see how Arthur and the gang could interact with singers of the past or right now...
I would get this for the backstreet boys fan... I thought that it was fun...",1039478400,9,988,4.145833333333333
