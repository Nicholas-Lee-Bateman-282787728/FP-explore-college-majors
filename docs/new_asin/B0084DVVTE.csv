5130533,5,B0084DVVTE,"My all time favorite anime series. It is a bit like the flower the space ship is named for---every time I watch, another petal opens, revealing new depths. If there is an anime cliche, this one rips it. Plus, it has a complicated and internally consistent plot, well rounded characters that you care about, and actual science fiction---not just a bunch of big robots shooting each other in space. Some animes are meant to be seen once and forgotten. This is one you can watch again and again.",1355616000,,492,4.6022727272727275

The crew fights to protect humanity from the Jovians and have a little fun. This anime crosses over so many genres. Action, comedy, sci-fi, harem, drama, mecha, and romance. It's very broad. There are also tons of awesome characters. The characters are what make this anime so frickin great. This was one of the first series I ever bought; and over 200 later I still go as far as to call it a legend. You need this anime. I hope you love it as much as I do.",1350864000,5,631,4.448275862068965

5130538,5,B0084DVVTE,"Previously released by the now defunct ADV, now the company that recently brought us Dirty Pair TV, known as Right Stuf aka Nozomi Entertainment, are bringing us a Deluxe version of Marian Successor Nadesico.

The new boxset will contain REMASTERED VIDEO from new telecline prints from component, progressive sources while previous released have been grainy, washed out, faded composite sources. ALL 26 episodes are remastered, including the Motion Picture which is included as well for the true completist fan. If you thought that was generous, we now get the previously UNRELEASED GEKIGANGER 3. This Gekiganger special was previously a Japan exclusive so most fans will be seeing this for the first time. For anyone thats a fan of the old Force Fiver shows like Starvengers, this is a must see.

The amazing English-language dub is included, along with the original Japanese audio which is remastered as well.  We also get better subtitle translations and on-screen translations, and special on-disc extras yet to be announced.  This ia Limited Edition set so get it early before it's goes Out of Print. All 7 discs  come in amazing Thinpak-style, full-color chipboard art box. It looks very expensive and chipboard is rarely used these days.

Overall this is an amazing release and Nozomi have surpassed their Dirty Pair TV release with this release of Nadiesco, a must for new and old fans. Clearly the Ultimate Release and therefore an A+ for Video, Audio, Extras and Packaging. I dare you to find a better release of any show than this.",1343606400,15,1542,5.027450980392157

Well then join us, NERGAL Industries, and the become one of the elites aboard our first space batttle-cruiser, the NADESICO (well what we mean is since there is not enough ""trained"" military people we will take ANYBODY who is willing to go up in space and try to do what those nitwits should be doing).  Enjoy 5 star cuisine prepared by our top chefs, one of which is also our ace Estevalis pilot, join our communications staff headed by the greatest anime voice actress of our time, and wonder as our commander (who is the daughter of the only admiral who actually has had success out there) tries to figure out not only how to beat the Jovian hordes but also figure out why her childhood friend and love interest(the pilot) is dating our head comms officer (the anime voice actress).  Also don't forget the annual Geikigengar convention, this year being held right here in space.  So join now, again we'll take anyone.  (voice over ""Idiots"").

Now that that is over, pretty much says it all does it not.  One part Battleship Yamamato, one part Robotech, and throw in Tenchii Muyo for flavor and this is pretty much what you get.  So join our fearless crew of otaku loving, peace wishing, and genetically enhanced people as they try to take the fight to the Jovians and find out what is truly out there in space.  I loved this series, especially the one where the Geikigengar people are watching the Nadesico as an anime tv series. The movie also was good, a lot darker but still has all the screwiness that you expect from the series.  So pick it up and enjoy.",1342742400,12,1712,4.504854368932039

5130551,5,B0084DVVTE,"Indeed, for anyone who may be wondering like me, who only know anime from cartoon network and the toonami days, this is one darn excellent anime. In fact, I would go so far as to say this is one of the best anime series I have Ever Seen. It's that good. But what makes it that good? The writing, that's what. The writing is just so creative, always veering in different directions and subverting expectations. The series plays as a parody, or rehashed unserious loveletter to the genres it employs, such as mecha and harem. I LOVE harem series, and this is indeed partly a harem, but with a quite satisfying end (for those who were so dumb and didn't realize it, there are Easter Eggs in the OVA in the bonuses in disc 7).

Martian Successor Nadesico: The Complete Collection is apparently remastered, with better audio quality and picture, akin to the Tenchi Universe collection that was recently released. This reissue brings back an essential anime, full of great characters and good stories. If you have ever seen Gurren Lagaan, and indeed I hope you have since that is by far the best example I can think of for such an original series, this is what GL wanted to be and pretty much used as its sole inspiration, but never never never amounted up to. The themes of war, romance, sci-fi, heck let's just keep it at war, are so much more mature in this series. There is a plot twist involving the Jovians that will make you go, 'Oh, there's more to all this than I thought', and this twist will remind you of Now and Then, Here and There, which along with Grave of the Fireflies were my two standards for war anime (along with Gundam Wing, Cartoon Network days and all) UNTIL this series. Seriously, you are missing out on one of the best anime EVER by not seeing this, its take on pretty much everything is original and thought provoking, though lighthearted and entertaining and funny at the same time.

If all you know is Tenchi and Gundam wing, it's time to get out of the anime basement and come up to the surface--you mole--and start checking out everything CN was too afraid to get a license for. Of course you may think this series is a bit too silly at first through the first couple episodes, but things gain a certain Tone at a point, and you'll just want to see it out to the very end henceforth. And believe me, the writing gets very silly, but I think I only thought that because I've never seen anything quite like a drama/pure parody/reflexive--meta-irony theme like this, it's so silly and serious but again, lighthearted, I want to stress that word very much, it's all over the place but the writers really control everything, it's very impressive the creative tangents they can go off on and still bring you back to the main story--an element of complete storywriting so often missing from modern anime, and especially Gurren Lagaan, as inspired and fun as the first 15 or so episodes of that was .

I don't often rate anime series five stars because in my Cartoon Network-centric head I think they mined all the anime talent and classics that were available at the time, but when I find something they totally missed on I do a little jump for joy. I would easily compare Nadesico with the best series of the 90's, such as Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, Gundam Wing, Rurouni Kenshin, Tenchi Muyo et al. You really are missing out on one of the BIG ONES if you don't see this. Essential anime.

And yes, the romantic story which I look for in most good anime is definitely here, even if it takes time to mature into something you care enough about. (;",1388707200,12,3562,4.5007727975270475
5130552,5,B0084DVVTE,"Martian Successor Nadesico is just... There are no words to describe it. This was the first full anime I had ever seen, (I had seen episodes of Naruto or One Piece before, but they dragged on way too long for me to stay interested. Nowadays One Piece has 500+ episodes?! Thanks but no thanks, Eiichiro Oda.) so maybe I'm viewing this series through nostalgia goggles, but I don't care. Nadesico perfectly blends elements of comedy, romance, suspense, action, and everything else you can imagine into one perfect bundle of joy. Every moment you spend with this anime will feel special. Nadesico also has the best English dub I've ever heard. You can feel that each character in the English dub has a personality, while this is not always the case in the Japanese dub (Inez's voice in Japanese sounds horribly wrong and out of place). From Yurika, the cute bubbly captain of the Nadesico, to soft spoken Ruri, who lovingly refers to her crew mates as idiots, the English cast gives us a reason to love these characters, and not brush them under the rug like some OTHER anime characters with bland white-bread personalities (I'm looking at you, Sakura). Prior to owning this Complete Collection (which fully lives up to its name; we'll get back to that in a minute), I owned the Complete Chronicles set, and the amount of features you get in the new one is amazing. Cast interviews (only for the Japanese dub though **tear drops form**), the motion picture epic ""Prince of Darkness"", and even the previously unreleased Gekigengar 3 OVA shows up for the party! The only things I wish were in this collection is English cast interviews, and maybe some insight to what goes on in the Japanese exclusive Nadesico games (maybe some cutscenes or something, I don't know). Either way, this is about as complete a collection available now, and I'm loving it! I love Nadesico so much that I'd buy a new box set if they released one, even if there aren't any new special features added. Get this Complete Collection today; you won't regret it! **In a bunny suit** ""It's time to get to know the Nadesico! You get to burning...""",1387929600,2,2113,4.713513513513513

5130555,5,B0084DVVTE,"This anime has a special place in my heart for the it provides such a diversified team of characters and their eccentric personalities only provide for a better narrative twist.  The series has a balanced mix of seriousness pertaining to the war against the jovians and yet still provides moments of laughter.  If you have the time, check this one of a kind gem out for im sure you won't be disappointed.",1375574400,2,404,4.597222222222222
5130556,3,B0084DVVTE,"In case you were wondering, Baka is a Japanese word meaning ""foolish; idiot; fool"".

I found a large disparity between Nadesico's reviews and what I saw on my screen.  What I saw was a Manga mishmash that lasted far too long.  It was as if the producer was determined to make the series last 26 episodes even though doing that required episodes that contributed little to the core of the story.  I feel that Nadesico whould have been much better if it had been only 13 episodes long.

It is intended to be a comedy/mecha satire.  It's major gag line is that several girls like the same boy, but the boy would rather watch Anime mecha movies.  Admittedly, that's an old gag line, but it would have been effective if Nadesico had been shorter in length.  It's too long.

The animation is drawn in the Manga style of cartooning and the animation is well done.  Manga girls have a unique cuteness.  The Girl with the Blue Eye is another Anime series that is a good example of that style of drawing girls.

If you collect Manga, Nadesico is good enough to be a welcome addition to your collection.  If you don't, its price is a deterrent.  It will be hard to justifying spending the money on a series that will be a chore to watch and that you probably won't want to watch a second time.",1358553600,2,1282,4.377118644067797
5130557,5,B0084DVVTE,"This series was excellent, with all the humor and action. It kind of reminded me of Gundam Wing, not sure why. Didn't really care for the OVA's, but the Full feature movie was sweet...although it took awhile to get going and ended like your typical DBZ movie.

5130559,5,B0084DVVTE,"You can say this anime may be a 90's thing but, no matter how how old the series is it is just funny to the max.  It is about the extremes a love a captain can give to her pilot.  This anime series is a classic and a Ball of fun.  If you haven't seen it, it is exciting to see.

8525051,3,B0084DVVTE,"Martian Successor Nadesico is another example of anime comedies that I don't quite get.  It reminds me a bit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Irresponsible-Captain-Tylor/dp/B00C6ATFSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Irresponsible Captain Tylor</a>, but the problem with that one was that the central character was such a blithering idiot that he had no idea what was going on around him or just how lucky he was to keep surviving, much less winning.  That is not the problem with Nadesico; the problem here is the schizophrenia of alternating the slapstick comedy with death and its associated misery.  Honestly, I think Nadesico would have worked as a screwball comedy; I also think it could have worked as a serious drama; I just don't think it works as both at the same time.  Ive enjoyed other anime comedy space operas:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dual-Parallel-Trouble-Adventure/dp/B0000C2IWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dual!

In fact there is a much more realistic balance between comedy and drama in the parody giant robot anime, Gekigangar 3, that many characters including the central one watch than there is in the main show, and that is just weird.  (Ive heard stories to the effect that the director, Tatsuo Sato, ceded control to others while he worked on something of greater importance to him at the time, and I wonder if that is the truth because more than most this series seemed to lack a controlling vision.)

A more interesting comparison might be made with the slightly earlier and vastly similar Vandread.  IMHO Vandread, unlike Nadesico, works for the following reasons.  The deaths in Vandread (and there are deaths in Vandread) are not wallowed in nearly as much as they are in Nadesico.  In addition the comedy and drama in Vandread aren't as violently contrasted; it always feels like Vandread unlike Nadesico is telling the same story.  In addition the ending to Vandread is a heck of a lot less confusing than the non-ending to Nadesico; one gets the impression that most of the participants in Vandread have learned something while most of the participants in Nadesico have not.  In the final analysis if Nadesico was Tatsuo Satos attempt to copy Vandread, he botched it.

In 2196 the Earth is at war with a race of alien invaders called Jovian Lizards, and due to the Earth militarys inability to defeat said invaders (Theyve given up on defending the Mars colonies and are giving up on defending the Moon colonies, concentrating on defending Earth), the Nergal corporation builds a highly advanced space battleship, the ND-001 Nadesico, to take back the offensive by leaving Earth for Mars.  Interestingly, while the Nadesico is far more advanced than anything the Earth military has, Nergal has to crew it with civilians with some slight personality disorders; in other words the Nergals crew is a bunch of oddballs and some are flipping nuts!  The other issue is that almost everything the Nergals crew think they know about the war at the beginning turns out to be a lie.

What follows is a confusing mixture of screwball comedy, and corruption, lies, and brutal deaths involving battle and assassination, and it doesnt help that almost everybody is lying about something.  Whats more it isn't paced very well; the ending is ridiculously abrupt, as if the creators were suddenly told at the last minute to wrap things up several episodes ahead of time.  (I rewatched the last episode to see if it would make more sense: somewhat, but youd almost need to draw a chart.)  One result is that the Gekigangar 3 OVA, composed mostly of reused footage, actually reveals something more about the main storyline.  Unfortunately, the Prince of Darkness movie introduces more mysteries than it clears up, at least partly because it is written to tell the story after one video game, Martian Successor Nadesico: The Blank of Three Years, and before another one,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Martian-Successor-Nadesico-The-Mission/dp/B000069URP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Martian Successor Nadesico: The Mission</a>.  Definitely could have been written more understandably.

Note: At least for those who like this sort of thing, this is a totally complete set, though oddly one of 4 Blu-rays and 1 DVD, containing 26 TV episodes, 1 Gekigangar 3 OVA (subtitled only, on DVD only), and the Prince of Darkness movie.",1525478400,,4868,5.787114845938375

Nozomi typically has a good history of releasing quality remasters, but I was a little disappointed with the blu-ray of Nadesico. Clarity was definitely an issue here, whatever master they encoded has a LOT more film grain than previous releases, and stair-stepping artifacts are noticeably present in many scenes. Is it really film grain though, or just noise? It's so pervasive that even with noise reduction at maximum on my TV, it was very distracting. The DVD release is even worse, with rampant jagged edges and an overall washed out look. My advice? Having seen both the Nozomi blu-ray and DVD releases of this show, I'd stick with the ADV release from 2008, which has an overall softer look, but significantly less visual noise and an almost complete absence of deinterlacing artifacts (while retaining excellent sound quality.)",1496016000,,997,5.048484848484849

8525059,3,B0084DVVTE,"Was in the mood for an older series, so picked this one up. The mecha designs are nothing special, but the center of the series is in the characters. The Japanese voice acting is good; subs are good. The typical cast of characters isn't the usual batch we'd see nowadays, with a large cast, including a number of folks that don't appear. The story is ok, with an alien invasion, the relationships between the characters, and the emergence of a few mysteries, including why our main character guy teleported from Mars colony. I'm not such a fan of the pacing and tone, because they feel crammed in. One moment the guy is in his derelict mech, floating towards his ship, and the next he's got the love triangle girls in there with him. I thought I'd fallen asleep for a minute, but the story does that a few times, as if a few minutes of animation were removed. Otherwise, one moment it's serious, then they cram in jokes, romance, and even just weird character quirks. It's jarring and distracting, but thankfully mostly at the beginning. I couldn't get invested in the love triangle either. It comes out of nowhere, goes nowhere, and everyone comes off a bit touched in the head. An anime of a different time indeed. Good animation, a nice show-within-a-show send off, and an unmistakable taste of 90s anime.",1492300800,3,1308,4.642241379310345
