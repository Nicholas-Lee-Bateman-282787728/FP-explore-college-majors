8622195,2,B00GCT8KIC,"Pretty good anime, however, the captions are a few minutes slow which makes it harder to listen and read at the same time. If you were to turn off the sound, it becomes easier to focus on the captions considering they come in a few minutes after the characters talk. The packaging was alright. Overall, I did like the anime show, but the captions need to be fixed to where it's in sync with the anime.",1505174400,,401,4.2894736842105265
