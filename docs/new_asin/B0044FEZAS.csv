8416082,5,B0044FEZAS,"Paris Opera Ballet Box Set contains 4 ballets. Jewells is pretty, but there is no story. From this I see Paris Ballet has Extra tall girls. La Dame Aux Camelias is very good story and a very new and good way to tell the story by flash back and forth. Finally it can make you cry. Cinderella and Swan Lake is made by Rodolf Nureyev. I found what he did is different with Royal Ballet. The story line of Cinderella is totally different with tradition. The Swan Lake's story line is slightly different with Royal Ballet. I like this better. Only one thing about Paris Ballet is the stage is boring, not as pretty and life-like as Royal Ballet.",1350172800,15,640,4.38655462184874
