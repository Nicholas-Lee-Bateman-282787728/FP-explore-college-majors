2889854,5,B000SSONFC,"A real delight to see how ""scripted"" the shows were then, and how silly we were as well.
How many divorces happened because of Candice Bergen's Dad,and  silly charlie's comments were made after the show.
This was fun.",1248912000,,217,4.7105263157894735
2889855,4,B000SSONFC,"This quirky 50's game show is notable for the fact that the co-costs are made of wood! Yep, a ventriloquist called Edgar Bergen hosts the show, Which is basically a ""Comedy Game Show"". The contestants are married couples, and the whole show is very charming in a very 50's way. The picture quality varies, Although thats to be expected with such poorly preserved content. The only problem is that the original commercials have been removed, probably since these appear to be re-run prints. Still, the 4 episodes on this DVD are quite rare, and will be of interest to those who enjoy classy 50's TV.",1208390400,2,598,4.704761904761905

8206673,5,B000SSONFC,"If you grew up listening to these guys on the radio like I did then you will enjoy revisiting those ""radio days"" - I listened to The Lone Ranger, The Shadow (knows what evil lurks in the minds of men), and Jack Benny, and Edger Bergen & Charlie McCarthy.",1397174400,,254,4.204081632653061
8206674,5,B000SSONFC,"Edgar Bergen, if only they would bring back all his movies. They are funny and wonderful to watch. I see a few of them
on TCM from time to time. Hope they turn them into DVDs ( for sale). This one is very funny. As for the picture and sound,
great.",1379030400,,248,3.8823529411764706
8206675,5,B000SSONFC,Another gift for a true Edgar Bergen/Charlie McCarthy fan who remembers this from his childhood. This will be very well liked.,1355616000,,126,5.0476190476190474
8206676,5,B000SSONFC,"A great piee of history. As an avid Bergen and McCarthy, I have the opportunity to reflect the early years with my grandchildren. They now enjoy the shows and comments as much as I do.",1297382400,,184,4.285714285714286
8206677,3,B000SSONFC,this dvd is a quiz show much like groucho but you see charlie mc carthy and his friends.  it was okay .,1294272000,,103,3.6818181818181817
8206678,3,B000SSONFC,"I found 3 items featuring Edgar Bergan and Charlie McCarthy... I just HAD to have them all.  Of the 3, this was my least favorite, not because it wasn't entertaining, it really was... but it featured Charlie, and the other Bergan family in a way that I wasn't looking for.  They were/are show hosts for a game show... the contestants were entertaining, but I wanted this for the ventriloquism, not just the entertainment value.  The old time programs are enjoyable as they are, but if you want true ventriloquism this isn't the one for you.  If you love to ""go back in time"" to when TV was clean and entertaining, you'll love this DVD.  If I had the opportunity to return it, I would NOT do so... this is indeed classic, and I'm glad to have it in my library.",1268092800,2,759,4.392857142857143
