8680041,1,B00NT96346,"Sorry but Posies & Big Star drummer are a yes, but Alex is showing his crap attitude & slop, with just a few glimmers of respect for BStar.  Watched once, not to be viewed again by me anyway.",1420329600,,191,4.026315789473684
8680042,4,B00NT96346,"Worth a look if you're a Big Star fan, given how little footage of the band there is (and even here, there are only 2 original members).  But notwithstanding the shortcomings of the source video (some breakups, graininess in low light, etc), it's a pretty good performance with some neat cover tunes.",1420243200,,300,4.769230769230769
8680043,4,B00NT96346,"Half of the original band appears in this line-up, but that's probably the best we're ever gonna get on video.

Jon Auer of The Posies picks up guitar and vocals for the late Chris Bell, and disappointingly Auer comes off as a bit listless at times.  But the clean drumming of Jody Stephens and the remarkable Alex Chilton on guitar and vocals more than make up for it.

Kevin Stringfellow of The Posies takes over bass guitar duties for original Big Star bassist Andy Hummel, who did not participate in this event.  Stringfellow is good, and he takes on lead vocals on ""Daisy Glaze"" and makes the song sound more engaging than any other version of it I've heard.

Now for the bad news:  this show, recorded in 1994, is an old VHS tape transferred to DVD.  Remember all the drawbacks of VHS tape, like tracking issues and occasionally shoddy video quality?  It's all here.  And the audio is NOT recorded from the soundboard, but rather taken from the ambient source of the stage speakers.  Now THAT'S frustrating.  So the sound and video are not up to the professional standards of the time.  But it's still a Big Star live show. I'll take what I can get.

The band covers material from all three studio albums from the 70's, a tune from Chris Bell's solo album ""I Am the Cosmos"", and they even toss in a cover of Todd Rundgren's ""Slut"".  Not a great show, but a very good one.",1419465600,3,1377,4.456
8680044,1,B00NT96346,I don't even think you need this if you're die hard fan. I've heard bootlegs that sound better than this. I'm sorry I paid a lot of money for the double red vinyl and the DVD. Approache with caution.,1419206400,3,199,4.128205128205129
8680045,4,B00NT96346,"This DVD is a wonderful surprise for Big Star fans. It may contain the only releasable full-concert footage of the band from any of its incarnations. Alex, Jody, and the Posies are in spirited form throughout. The set includes an excellent overview of the three classic Big Star records and some interesting covers. I only have three minor criticisms:  no ""Thirteen,"" garbled lyrics by Auer in ""Back of a Car,"" and less than perfect visual quality. Still, this is an absolute must-have for any Big Star fan.",1416960000,5,507,4.827586206896552
8680046,4,B00NT96346,"Four-point-five star performance, with a star demotion for the original technical quality.  Video production had evolved nicely by the early 90s, but there are many glitchy images in this footage.  They had multiple cameras going so I wonder why in editing they stuck with a shot of Jody that was breaking up (for example), rather than go elsewhere on the stage.  It gets better further into the show, as does the show itself.  After the ""Nothing Can Hurt Me"" doc with no performance video (understandably so, but there is Alex solo footage), this is the next best thing.",1416960000,2,571,4.795918367346939
