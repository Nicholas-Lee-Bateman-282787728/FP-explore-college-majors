Studio: DreamWorks Animation SKG Home Entertainment

Andrews Blu-ray 3D Review: SHREK 3D [2001] is a quirky oddball computer-animated fairy tale spoof from the people at DreamWorks Animation SKG Home Entertainment. The title character of Shrek is a large green ogre voiced in the Scottish brogue by Mike Myers, but don't worry, this is not the ghastly over the top Austin Powers territory. Also Eddie Murphy plays the role of wisecracking sidekick donkey. The principal cast is rounded off by Cameron Diaz as the feisty Princess Fiona, and John Lithgow as the egocentric and very short Lord Farquaad.

Lord Farquaad is obsessed with having the perfect kingdom, and to that end is rounding up and imprisoning fairy-tale creatures, most of who flee to Shreks doorstep for protection. But to have a kingdom, you need to be a king, and Lord Farquaad decides the quickest way to kingship is to marry Princess Fiona. There is just one small snag: Princess Fiona is locked up in a tower guarded by a ferocious fire breathing dragon.

Enter the green ogre Shrek, who has come to have a word with Lord Farquaad about getting the unwanted squatters off his property. Lord Farquaad agrees to rescue of the princess in exchange getting the unwanted squatters off Shreks property, and he does so with characteristic directness. Shrek is hardly the Prince Charming that Princess Fiona expected, but she warms up to him in time. The rest of the story cant really be told without spoiling the animated films surprises ending, but suffice to say, it follows the time-honoured trend of skewering the familiar fairy-tale odd ball clichs while still managing to end with a happily ever after.

When all is said and done, the 3D computer generated animated film of SHREK is to my mind a comic masterpiece and at the same time it is also very witty, very enjoyable animated film. The comic timing is absolutely brilliant, the satire is right on the mark, and the voice acting captures of the weird and wonderful characters are perfectly sublime and it also helps that all the actors are totally in their fun filled element, especially in the recording studio. The computer animation is right up there with top-of-the-line sparkling images; which would not expect any less from the DreamWorks SKG Animation studio. The rock-and-roll soundtrack is also amazing, especially with the opening with Smash Mouths All Star and finishing with a jazzed-up cover of The Monkees group song Im a Believer by Eddie Murphy and may seem a little incongruous, but it blends so well with the overall mood of this brilliant animated film.

Against that straight-forward story is a backdrop of famous fairy tale characters including the Three Blind Mice, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Cinderella, Robin Hood, the Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf, the Three Bears. The film makers also introduce a donkey named Donkey [Eddie Murphy] who brays some of the funniest and some of the dumbest lines in the animated film. This aspect is more likely to appeal to those who have an extensive knowledge of fairy tales and the subtleties involved. There are also a few parodies; including one of the classic scenes in the film The Matrix where one could see the coming as soon as Princess Fiona started kicking butt.

Many of the scenes in SHREK 3D you get to hear the funniest lines like ""a castle that big must mean he's compensating for something"" will go over younger viewer's heads, but there are still plenty that won't, like ""I'm going to save my ass,"" which of course is referring to Donkey. The screenplay was obviously written with all age groups in mind. SHREK is not on such a lofty plane that children will feel as if they are missing out on something, but it isn't done in a way that will insult the intelligence of older viewers.

SHREK 3D animation is totally sublime and also totally excellent, and is without doubt has very effective vocal performances of all the voice cast involved and also impressive are the visual imagery and to the point of being very impressive and also very effective and employing both technology and an intuitive feel for what works best in this animated film that definitely delivers the perfect fairy tale story. Again, like any other excellent animated film, this one works because of the brilliant voices of the actors. In fact, I believe that voicing alone can make or break an animated film and even though all these effects are cool, and with this animated film SHREK 3D the sublime and excellent voicing adds so well towards this brilliant animated film.

SHREK 3D is the kind of animation that becomes more prevalent, especially with the importance of choosing the right voices that need equal care and attention. Voices help to define the characters, and a bad choice can do irreparable damage. Fortunately, SHREK 3D has four capable actors that includes and foremost is Mike Myers, who is known as a vocal chameleon. Without seeing his name in the opening credits, you'd never know it was him. John Lithgow plays Lord Faquaad as a nasty and short-sighted, but not really evil, which makes a pleasant change from the usual animated villain. Eddie Murphy shows that a real comic genius can get laughs without relying on his own facial expressions and body language.

Eddie Murphy's Donkey is one of the funniest characters he has brought to the screen. Cameron Diaz's Princess Fiona is equal parts sugar and vinegar and believes in true love and a Prince Charming, and the interplay between Shrek and Princess Fiona is sweet and tender, while the exchanges between Shrek the ogre and the donkey are often barbed and subversively very funny. And, while there is a happy ending, as there must be in any fairy tale, no matter how unconventional, it is not necessarily the conclusion that many people will be expecting at least up until at a certain point, when the animated film reveals its hand. First-time co-directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky; and is her first credit, have crafted a magical animated film to be proud of, and one that will hopefully receive a lot of attention, even during the crowded summer season. SHREK is easily one of that year's 2001 most magical and joyous experiences for audiences of all ages. So well done DreamWorks Animation SKG Home Entertainment for your brilliant professional effort.

3D Blu-ray Image Quality  DreamWorks Animation SKG Home Entertainment brings us this totally brilliant animated film in a stunning 1080p Technicolor 3D image presentation and equally impressive is the 1.78:1 aspect ratio that really enhances the 3D images you view is so spectacular it is just like Real 3D and you feel you are in the film with all the characters. Given the recent nature of the clean-up, the results are nothing short of jaw dropping beautiful, and especially the main colours that really stood out for me were the main colours like the reds, green, blue, brown and mauve, but overall the other spectrum of colours you get to view are truly outstanding and vibrant. On top of all that the image quality is as good as you would get with a brand new CGI computer generated animated film. This SHREK 3D Blu-ray images pop out off the screen in a really spectacular way, that also gives you an amazing depth of field, and makes this SHREK 3D Blu-ray a truly classic demonstration material that will make all your visitors see this animated film in a brand new way compared to the 2D image presentation, which is just as good, especially if you only prefer to watch this Blu-ray disc in the 2D image presentation, but for me personally I prefer the brilliant 3D images that really enhances this brilliant animated film. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

3D Blu-ray Audio Quality  DreamWorks Animation SKG Home Entertainment presents us with an awesome spectacular presentation of the 7.1 Dolby TrueHD Surround Sound experience, especially when you get the upbeat well known pop-songs appear throughout the animated film. You get the experience of all the speakers getting a really good workout and especially the rear speakers that is flawlessly brilliant, that really generates a cheerful soundscape that is so wonderfully enveloping all around you and makes you feel part of the animated film, as well as experiencing the discrete sounds of wildlife when the music is in its quieter mode, that really enhances all of the sound field to highly-satisfying audio effect. Channel separation and movement is very well-balanced, creating an expansive image across the screen in a very convincing way. Dynamics and acoustics sound effects are surprisingly extensive with clean mid to upper levels, and low-bass provides accurate weight and punch to the action as well as the song selections. So all in all this is a totally excellent effort on the part of DreamWorks Pictures SKG Animation and everyone involved in this brilliant animated film should be totally congratulated in their professional production values.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

The Animators Corner acts as a nice complement to the animated film SHREK as it discusses a good array of areas of great interest. It also manages to fill nearly all of the 90 minutes of this animated film, with the occasional few gaps here and there, but overall this special feature provides a totally enjoyable picture-in-picture experience that sheds a lot more light and information about the animated film SHREK from the people at DreamWorks Animation SKG Home Entertainment. One bonus with this special feature is that while the animated film is still running you can still watch the film in the 7.1 Dolby TrueHD Surround Sound.

Special Feature: Spotlight On Donkey [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [11:38] This short special feature tries to explain who Donkey is in great detail. We also get comments by the voice behind Donkey and some of the crew, as well as a look behind-the-scenes, especially some fun times in the recording studio. We also get to see clips from different SHREK animated films that includes SHREK [2001]; SHREK 2 [2004]; SHREK THE HALLS [2007] and SHREK FOREVER AFTER [2010]. Contributors include: Eddie Murphy [Donkey], Antonia Banderas [Puss In Boots], Jeffrey Katzenberg [CEO of DreamWorks Animation], Aron Warner [Producer], Andrew Adamson [Director], Vicky Jenson [Director], Mike Mitchell [Director], Ken Bielenberg [Visual Effects Supervisor], Mike Myers [Shrek], Teresa Cheng [Producer] and Walt Dohrn [Rumpelstiltskin].

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [2010] [1080i] [1.78:1] [8:01] Here we get view three deleted scenes that includes Fiona Prologue; The deal and Fiona Gets Them Lost. At the start of each deleted scene, we get a prologue explaining about the specific reason why they were not included in the SHREK animated film. Contributors include: Aron Warner [Producer], David Lowery [Artist], Chris Miller [Artist] and Cody Cameron [Artist].

Audio Commentary by Directors Andrew Adamson & Vicky Jenson and Producer Aron Warner [Here you can view their comments with German, English, Spanish and Italian Subtitles]: When the film starts, you hear everyone humming to the DreamWorks signature music, then Aron Warner introduces himself, next up to introduce them self is Vicky Jenson and then finally to introduce himself is Andrew Adamson, which he comments that you people out there who like people talking behind you while watching a film in the cinema, then you will enjoy all of our comments throughout the 90 minutes of the animated film. Well for a start I hate and detest selfish people talking in the cinema or using their mobile phone, which I did not pay to have these selfish acts forced upon me, as I paid to watch the film that is why now I prefer to stay at home and watch my Blu-ray discs in my own personal environment. They all start to comment about the animated film, and especially the wonderful opening with the beautiful illustrated pages of the book, that were illustrated by the wonderful Julia Wolfe who was specially employed to work in the Art Department at DreamWorks and they also said that they wanted to give the illustration of the pages in the book in a traditional fairy tale look to set up the scenario for the animated film. When you see Shrek come of the toilet, you see the crescent moon on the door, well Vicky wanted the DreamWorks logo on the door instead, but was denied this and had to compromise with the crescent moon instead. When Shrek finally meets Donkey and arrives at Shreks home and Donkey says he wants to talk about manly things and make waffles in the morning, well for people viewing this animated film outside America, they of course had to have Donkey say a typical breakfast in a specific country in their language. When you see all the fairy tale characters outside Shreks home, they talk about the delicate rendering of the fur on the animals, the flames of the fire, the leaves and the moonlight, well they say this was the most expensive rendering and took over nine hours to do just one frame. When Shrek and Donkey enters the Dragons Castle, they mention that it was the only time that the black colour was introduced, and to be the major colour pallet, so that they could really highlight the black colour lighting, so that it really highlights the shadows. They now get around to talking about the lens flares effects in the animated film, because they wanted some artefacts that you would get to experience in a proper film, as they wanted you to feel as though you were in a real world and totally natural. As we get to near the end of the film, and especially the Karaoke musical number, they ask us the viewer, if we are still listening with them, and that you made it all the way through their audio commentary, and one of them says, believe me it was a lot more fun making the animated film, thank us talking about the making of the animated film, and they also mention about all the people you see listed in the credits and want to thank them very much for all their hard work they put into making this brilliant animated film SHREK. Yes I totally agree with all the people listed in the credits who worked tireless in producing this brilliant and very special animated film, to producing something that was a totally magical experience. But as to this audio commentary itself, I have to say that only about 50% of the comments were of interest, but the other half of it was slightly boring and mostly talked about general aspect of stuff that went right over my head and talking about certain people I had no idea who they were, so all I can say if you want to venture into this audio commentary, see if you agree with my comments. Whereas the special feature Shreks Interactive Journey was far more interesting and I never got bored.

Special Feature: Shrek, Rattle & Roll: Here you get to view four special music videos that are a great deal of fun, which are as follows:

01. Shrek In The Swamp Karaoke Dance Party [2001] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:53] This short music video is set immediately after the plot of the animated film, just before main characters Shrek and Fiona depart for their honeymoon. It features many of the film's characters dancing in Shrek's swamp, singing excerpts of popular songs. The short film is directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson and features the voice actors from the animated film SHREK. Featured songs include ""Just The Way You Are,"" ""Like a Virgin,"" ""Baby Got Back"" by Sir Mix-a-Lot, ""Feelings,"" ""Y.M.C.A.,"" ""Do You Really Want To Hurt Me,"" ""Stayin' Alive,"" ""Who Let The Dogs Out,"" ""Dance To The Music,"" and ""Happy Together."" As a sort of bonus you can also do a sing-along with the different songs by pressing the Subtitle button your remote control, and reveals the following subtitles: Spanish [Catalan], German, English, Italian and Turkish.

02. Baha Men: Best Years Of Our Lives [Music Video] [2001] [480i] [1.33:1] [3:08] Here we get to actually see the group Baha Men perform to their upbeat wonderful jolly Latin beat song, that was featured in the animated film SHREK.

03. Smash Mouth: Im A Believer [Music Video] [2001] [480i] [1.33:1] [3:15] Here we get to actually see the group Smash Mouth perform to their song, that Eddie Murphy sang in the animated film SHREK.

04. DreamWorks Animation Video Jukebox [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1 / 2.35:1] Here you get to view a selection of brilliant music videos that includes lots of your favourite different cartoon characters that have appeared in the DreamWorks Animation SKG Home Entertainment animated films. With the DreamWorks Animation Video Jukebox you get to view the following music videos:

01. SHREK: Im A Believer [1:17]

02. MADAGASCAR: I Like To Move It [1:02]

03. OVER THE HEDGE: Rockin the Suburbs [Over The Hedge Version] [1:58]

04: BEE MOVIE: Here Comes The Sun [1:23]

05. KUNG FU PANDA: Kung Fu Fighting [2:35]

06. HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON: Fly High [1:51]

Finally, SHREK 3D on the positive side, has a lot of excellent hilarious unique humour and some very good messages to make you think. The biggest moral of the story is the totally wrong attitude of judging people by their appearance, although this is undercut somewhat by the abundance of short jokes directed at Lord Farquaad, but the secondary message is the importance of companionship. All Shrek wants at the beginning of the animated film is to be left alone, but he learns by the end that no man or even a big green ogre is an island. While there is nothing really new or especially deep in this animated films moral platitudes, there is still some refreshing outlook in peoples self-centred and image-conscious of todays society. And for children who have not heard them a hundred times before, they could very well make a lasting impression. With noted caveats, all I can say is very well done DreamWorks Animation SKG Home Entertainment for bringing us something totally unique and something that is really enjoyable for the whole family and especially with repeat viewing. Very Highly Recommended!
