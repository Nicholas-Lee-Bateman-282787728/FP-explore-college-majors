8613351,5,B00F9AJ0D4,"I prefer walking as my exercise activity, especially when pregnant.  I wanted to add some strength training for this pregnancy as well.  I have used light weights for some exercises, but was impressed that this series uses just body weight (and a chair).  While anticipating being pregnant during the heat of summer (110+ degrees in my area), I wanted to find exercise options for inside my home.  This series is awesome.  My 2 year old son enjoys doing these with me, and often will ask to exercise.
I have only done the prenatal workouts, but I am so impressed!  Things I love about it:  1- A warm up and cool down section is included, and can be selected as chapters separately.  I like this feature because I can use the warm up/cool down on this set and then mix it up with other exercises.  2- This is great for beginners.  I have learned a lot about exercise and they spend a lot of time talking about correct form. 3-  They pause and remind you to drink water, which is really helpful for me.  It also is at a slow enough pace so that when I'm worn out, I can rest and not get behind.
I am looking forward to trying the 3rd trimester workout soon, and the post baby workouts when I am feeling better post-baby.
4-  With the warm up and cool down sections, I'm finding the workout is 35ish minutes long, which is perfect for me.  If I am feeling tired or short on time, I don't repeat the main exercise routine.  There is also a abs section for 1st and 2nd trimester, but I found that I'm not a fan of the exercises on the 2nd trimester section.  I have learned others from Andrea Orbeck's online videos that work better for me, so I do that on my own.",1405468800,,1659,4.269230769230769
8613352,5,B00F9AJ0D4,Good workout that is easy to follow along! Even if you don't normally work out it is doable. I don't normally work out and was a bit sore after the first workout (in my second trimester) but once you get past the initial soreness it is great for getting ready for labor! The recipes were helpful as well!,1389052800,,304,4.258620689655173
8613353,5,B00F9AJ0D4,"I just purchased these videos for my wife and and she absolutely loves them!  These are the best DVD's for Moms fitness. Dr. Montminy has real credentials and credibility and isn't just some ""health expert"" giving advice.  Her positive attitude and the easy recipes are a bonus as well.  I would highly recommend this product.",1379548800,,326,4.890909090909091
8613354,5,B00F9AJ0D4,"Dr. Montminy, I truly wish your DVD was available 11 years ago when I had my first and then second 7 years ago! But I guess it is never too late. These workouts are inspiring even for us mature and working moms. High adrenaline and energy is even more important when kids are in school. Many thanks for your extremely helpful advice and the workouts!",1379462400,2,350,4.4
8613355,5,B00F9AJ0D4,"I wish I had this DVD set when I had my first baby!  I loved that it addresses all the stages of pregnancy and beyond.
The recipes were easy to follow as well.  It's nice to follow a real mom go through the exercises rather than just a trainer telling you what to do.",1379376000,2,267,3.925925925925926
