7813813,4,6301666453,"This video from The Speech Collection offers excerpts from key speeches in the political career of Richard M. Nixon.  Obviously the main ones for showing to history classes are: (1) ""My Side of the Story,"" a.k.a. the ""Checkers"" speech, given by Senator Nixon on September 23, 1952 and the preeminent example of what would be called a speech of apology in American politics.  Selected as Dwight Eisenhower's running mate on the Republican ticket, Nixon was accused by the New York Post of having received money from a ""secret fund"" and went on national television to defend himself (pay attention to the end; his time was up and Nixon was cut off before he finished his speech); (2) ""Cambodia,"" delivered from the White House on November 3, 1970 to explain why American troops in Vietnam had invaded the neutral country of Cambodia, the last significant escalation in the Vietnam War; (3) Excerpts from some of Nixon's public statements during his visit to China; and (4) ""Resignation Speech,"" August 7, 1974, when the Watergate scandal finally forced Nixon to give up the Presidency.  Obviously I have used the tapes in The Speech Collection for my Public Address classes, but they would be equally useful in American History classes covering the Nixon Presidency.  These tapes provide short introductory sections and minimal commentary, so they are essentially primary documents available for classroom use.",1009065600,4,1408,5.135371179039302
