8581595,3,B00CGCKFWS,The photographic quality of WB dvd is beautiful.  However I deducted two stars due to a cut made by WB in a flashback in which the victim describes himself stumbling around in a drugged state breaking the window of a phone booth.  it occurs at about minute 18 as the victim is having coffee in his room with his girl and robert armstrong.,1502582400,,338,4.349206349206349
8581596,5,B00CGCKFWS,"Adapted from Woolrich's story, ""Cocaine,"" this is a great little Monogram noir that actually deals with the drug issue more than one might think--although he's called ""drunk"" several times in the film, the protagonist is also referred to as being on drugs, a violation of the Production Code.  Has all the film noir tropes that one could desire.",1473120000,,345,4.948275862068965
8581597,5,B00CGCKFWS,"Good movie. Strange plot, but then again weren't most of Cornell Woolrich's stories strange?",1446336000,,92,5.642857142857143
8581598,2,B00CGCKFWS,"""The Fall Guy"" is a 1947 movie from Monogram, a poverty row studio, so it goes without saying it is a low budget picture.  Robert Armstrong, who was so prominent in the 1933 ""King Kong"", and Elisha Cook, Jr, who was apparently in EVERY movie made in this period, are the only actors you are likely to recognize here.  Much of the rest of the cast seemed like less expensive versions of other actors.  For example, the leading lady, Teala Loring, reminded me clearly of Gene Tierney (which is no bad thing), and Charles Arnt seemed to bear a faint resemblance to Franklin Pangborn.

Most unfortunately, though, the leading man, Clifford Penn, reminds you of no one at all, because he has pretty much no screen presence.  Furthermore, although he is apparently meant to be playing a professional wrestler, he loses any physical confrontation he engages in.  At one point, he is standing next to Elisha Cook, Jr., and you cannot help but notice that Cook (the weakling and victim in God knows how many films) seems substantially more formidable and self confident.  According to the IMDB, Penn apparently had a more successful career as a director under the name Leo Penn.

The movie's plot is a typically baroque Cornell Woolrich story, in which Penn is not entirely certain whether he has murdered somebody or not.  The police simply assume he has committed murder because he is found unconscious with a bloody knife while wearing a bloody shirt - even though there is no corpse to be found anywhere at the time, and they first have to demand that Penn tell them who he murdered!  Penn is able to escape them, however, by the clever expedient of walking out of the COMPLETELY UNLOCKED ""police ward"" of the hospital the police took him to.

Fortunately for Penn, his roommate (there was still a housing shortage in 1947) is a police detective who does NOT think that Penn has committed murder, and who begins to investigate Penn's vague recollections of the previous night.  Teala Loring, as Penn's girlfriend (who is way too pretty for him) tries to be useful, but is not given much to do.  Penn and Armstrong wander around the city meeting various shady characters, while Elisha Cook escapes the movie by being murdered, as he so often was.  The solution to the mystery did not seem to make a great deal of sense to me in terms of being a practical way for the villain to achieve his ends, but that is really a very common failing.

It is difficult to recommend this movie to anyone.  It is short, but still seems to move slowly.  It seems to take place mostly indoors, in cheap and dreary.apartments and bars (there is a bartender who somewhat resembles Edward Everett Horton, BTW) and gives one no clues of what the outside world looked like in 1947.  Still, this one might be slightly above many other Poverty Row mysteries just because of the odd and meandering nature of the plot, and the curious hole at the center where a protagonist ought to be.

Note: The IMDB uses the cover of this DVD as the illustration for a 1930 movie of the same title, which stars Jack Mulhall, Mae Clarke, and Ned Sparks.  It also gives the title of the 1947 movie as just ""Fall Guy"", rather than ""THE Fall Guy"" which Amazon uses.",1437868800,,3215,4.607017543859649
