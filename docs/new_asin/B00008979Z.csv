You should know I love it! These 12 episodes are the very best Guyver series hands down! I should point out that to practice my Japanese and for a preference for Japanese audio I avoid the English dub. I know people are critical of the English opening but I can only overall speak to the Japanese presentation. An outstanding series! In fact it's in my all-time top 4 series! Get it to have all of the best Guyver anime there is! It's a violent and brilliant anime!",1510185600,,636,4.398305084745763
7980679,5,B00008979Z,"I remember renting this series back in the good ol' days of video stores and VHS.  I also remember seeing all but the last two episodes of the series.  Well, it's nice to have the original animated series complete on 2 dvds.  It's also worth noting that I have the updated Funimation series, as well.  Even though the art style and animation of the original may be a bit dated by todays' standards, the story, action, and character designs are not.  I'm not going to reveal the story, but suffice it to say that it definitely follows the formula previously established by western superheroes like Shazam/Captain Marvel and Spiderman (except that it is more graphically violent than both of them).  Since we all know that a hero is only as good as his/her villains, Sho Fukamachi (high school student & the main hero) has plenty of them to bedevil him and his friends in the form of the Chronos Corporation and their monstrous creations, the Zoanoids.  I am a big-time monster fan and the zoanoids greatly fit the bill.  Of course, I do not recommend letting little children watch this because, as I said earlier, it is graphically violent.  Dismemberment, broken bones, and plenty of bloodshed, just to name a few.  Also, it is based on a manga series and is faithful to it, for the most part.  However, one doesn't need to read the manga to enjoy this animated series, although it may enhance one's enjoyment of it.

It's also worth it to note that there were 2 Americanized live-action, straight-to-video movies made in the 1990s.  Having seen them, neither of them could do justice to the Guyver.  In order for a live-action movie or series to even begin to do justice to this character and his world, it would require a budget and a level of SFX that's either equal to or greater than that allocated for a typical episode of A Game Of Thrones.  Otherwise, it's easy to see that The Guyver is best realized as an animated series (except for the execrable ""Guyver: Out Of Control"", which I'm glad hasn't seen the light of day as a dvd).

If you're a fan of old-school, action-oriented anime with an edge, you should definitely add this series to your collection.",1504310400,,2164,4.62565445026178

7980683,2,B00008979Z,"If you have Volume 1 already, you are no doubt well aware of the changes Manga Video made to the series (music, credits, english voices) but you haven't seen anything yet!
I must admit I have only seen the entire series on its original L.A.Hero and U.S.Renditions VHS releases, and when the Manga Video ""Datas"" came out, I could only find episodes 4 and 6, so I knew not of what Manga Video had decided to do with episode 12.
Brace yourselves, you may find what you are about to hear hard to believe, but I swear it to be true. Episode 12 was EDITED on the VHS ""Data"" and so it remains EDITED on this DVD presentation. Let me explain what I mean by EDITED: we all know that Manga changed the opening and closing credits and some of the english voices. All in all, fairly excusable considering the original credits are viewable in the special features menu. But, what is unacceptable and, on inspection, utterly pointless, was their cutting (or rather, trimming) of Mizuki's nude sequence in episode 12. Now, instead of being full-frontal fan service, it is...well, exactly what it was before, only shorter (I mean 'frames' shorter). What lawsuit was filed against Manga that warranted these pointless cuts (You can still tell she gets her clothes ripped off by ZX-Tole and Sho still has to give her his shirt afterwards, so what difference does it make?)? Fear not, though, basement-dwelling-Hentai-collecting-Lara-Croft-oggling miscreants; The full, uncut version of episode 12 is available in the special features menu. Of course, this only begs the question: Why did Manga not just put the uncut version on the disc and let that 'edited' version find a nice new home in the dumpster outside the studio? Frankly, I cannot get past my original question of, ""Why was episode 12 edited in the first place? Who were they afraid of getting upset over a nude sequence in an ANIMATED series?"" Maybe we will never know. The whole thing digs up more dirt than it is worth, and I sound pretty ridiculous making such a fuss over a nude sequence in an ANIMATED series. But, if the full version is in the special features, why...OH, FORGET IT! YOU WIN, MANGA VIDEO!
Look, if animated nudity offends you, that is fine, just do not watch it. You have eyelids, use them! But editing the content of films is just plain ridiculous, and this edit (or rather, trim) is simply pointless. There, I have said it, I am done now!
Final word: Four out of Five for presentation, Zero out of Five for EDITING/TRIMMING content. Average is Two.",1065484800,10,2516,4.6945701357466065
7980684,5,B00008979Z,"The video quality is great and it seems that some of the effects are animated at a different FPS or my mind playing tricks on me, some seem a bit modified to look like a greater quality of animating them. The soud is great also, great quality Dolby 5.1/2.0 English track aswell as a 2.0 Japanese track, too bad we get only 2.0 for that one but at least my ears seem to tell me that there isn't a whole lot of difference in quality. There's of course as you'd probably know, for those who do their homework, some neat bonuses such as Zoanoid data files(although already included on the VHS..but not on 2nd act VHS from Manga), Original unmodified(yay for none of that U.S. Rendition's credit text and subtitles) Japanese Intros/Outros, and some others that will make you guys happy, I don't want to spoil the excitement that much so I won't state all of them. Thank you Manga Entertainment! And thank you guys at the U.K. for having it remixed and for getting the man called ""Mad Dog Winston"" to create the awesome soundtrack for the Manga Edition of this awesome 12 part anime series.",1046476800,2,1084,4.50761421319797
