7936555,4,B00005B1ZX,"The Adventures of Justine is a series of seven films, sold separately or sold together as a collection. At first glance one may mistake The Adventures of Justine for one of those ubiquitous perky, adolescent TV shows. Lithe and lovely Justine (Daneen Boone) could easily be a Nancy Drew character and Professor Paul Robson (Timothy Dipri) seems to have been given an Indiana Jones persona. However, one realizes very soon that Justine's adventures are not so innocent.

Justine is a precocious teenage student and Professor Robson is a facility member at the Topacre Academy for gifted young girls. Justine along with several of the other girls are infatuated with the be-speckled but handsome Professor. Justine, who is ostensibly a virgin, and the Professor seem to get dragged into one international quest after another and while Justine manages, to her chagrin, (she desires to be de-flowered by the Professor) to remain innocent, her dreams and fantasies do not.

Justine and the Professor manage to get involved with a group of bad guys in each adventure, usually with Justine being captured but never violated, even while, people all around her, good and bad, are engaging in sex, which, by the way, Justine often watches.

Although Justine never physically takes part in any of the numerous sex scenes, she has a vivid imagination and occasionally gets seduced in one of her dreams. Her spunky roommate Ursula (Kimberly Rowe) and house mother, Madame Souvray (Jennifer Behr) are both sexually active and are often portrayed in simulated sex situations, as are the various nefarious ladies depicted in each film.

Here is a synopsis of the seven films:

In the Heat of Passion - As usual our leggy, precocious student Justine, is daydreaming about the handsome Professor Robson. She is delighted when her dream comes true and she is picked to accompany him, during a school break, on archaeological travels around the world, including the sands of Egypt and glaciers of Alaska.

In A Midsummer's Night Dream, Justine is kidnapped right out of her school and held with the intent to make her a sex slave. She escapes the first time but is captured again and this time is rescued by her Professor, Paul Robson at a wild Hollywood party. The two of them travel to the highlands of Scotland to get a rare book and Justine sees amorous ghosts.

In Object of Desire, Justine and Professor Robson, lose, recover and lose again, a rare, huge, exotic ruby amidst sinister murder plots. Foreign intrigue and a gratuitous quantity of erotica are the norm in this story, which take the viewer from the exotic Orient, to the romantic countryside of Europe.

Exotic Liaison - Set deep in the steamy heart of Amazonia, below the towering Andes, Justine rescues Professor Robson, who has been captured by vicious smugglers of antiquities, trying to steal ancient Incan artifacts.

Crazy Love - Justine and Professor Robson are running from persistent, ex-KGB agents, who follow them from Russia through the jungles of Mynamar (Burma) and eventually, to Amsterdam` teaming red light district.

In A Private Affair, double agents and mistaken identities are the norm as Justine and Professor Robson seek the ""Eye of God"", a legendary ancient gem. This adventure finds them, exploring the deserts of the Middle East, the revelry of Mardi Gras in New Orleans and the sensuous complexity of Paris.

And in Seduction of Innocence, Justine is kidnapped by Professor Robson's archnemesis, the purpose of which is to compel her to divulge the location of the ""Eye of God."" It's up to the resourceful Professor Robson rescue her once again.

What`s Good

* Beautiful people, good casts

* Excellent bodies (male and female)

* Well done, though not overly suggestive sex scenes

* atmospheric cinematography

* a bouncy, somewhat jocular quality

What's Bad

* Low budget and it shows

* weak plots/stories

* Sex scenes seem sanitized (dispassionate)

* mediocre acting

* limited features

Conclusion

Despite the fact that the plots are lame and each story has more holes than a back woods, stop sign, the overall effect of these films, for me at least, is positive. If a soft-core film can be wholesome, this would be it. Each story is kind of a rehash of the preceding story, with some different characters, outside the nuclear cast (teachers and classmates). There doesn't seem to be a continuing story, so it is not necessary to view more than one flick, unless you so chose.

So there you have it, ""wholesome soft-porn"" (is that an oxymoron?). It's not bad. It's something stimulating that you can watch without feeling perversive. Check it out. 4 stars.",1131062400,15,4643,4.974126778783958

The writing is bad, and the acting follows suit.  Stories are cheesy.  Direction is basic.  Back-lot... re-used sets.  Yet, the true purpose of the series is captured in excellent form.  BEAUTY!
I purchased the whole set, and I don't regret it, because I am a huge fan of KIMBERLY ROWE.  Every time she shows up on screen, she just looks incredible.  She's not the main character, but she plays Justine's promiscous best friend.  Despite the fact that I bought them, just for ROWE, the rest of the cast is beautifully captured too.
If you love camp, you can't go wrong with the king of camp ROGER CORMAN.  And if you love beauty.  You definately can't go wrong with Kimberly Rowe, Daneen Boone, Jennifer Behr and a host of other beauties",1009756800,7,787,4.630434782608695
