7031085,5,B00U8BDLFW,"As Director of the Mandell JCC Hartford Jewish Film Festival I screen 100 entries to our annual festival in Connecticut. BERLIN CALLING, which screened in our March 2015 program (...) stood out immediately as a film that would be well-received by not only our loyal fans, but also by a general, non-Jewish audience, including high school and college groups. The film is in English; the story is one many young people today can relate to: about a rebellious, contemporary Los Angeles teen who learns to appreciate her father for his remarkable courage and kindness despite growing up and surviving the worst of humankind. The characters are real and likeable. NIgel Dick, the director, if you should be so lucky to have him in person at your event, is charming, eloquent and immediately connects with everyone who comes into contact with him. I highly recommend BERLIN CALLING for young people to screen as part of their coursework, as well as second and third generation survivor organizations as an example of great storytelling across the generations.",1431561600,7,1053,5.057471264367816
7031086,5,B00U8BDLFW,I love this film. It was raw and real. This film shows you the lottery of life in the middle of a war. The ones who were lucky to survive and the ones that didn't. I highly recommend it.,1431475200,,186,3.7948717948717947
7031087,5,B00U8BDLFW,"Berlin Calling is a real treasure. It is emotional, riveting and adventurous all at once.  The story of Kastle Waserman is thought provoking and inspiring. Kastle lives vicariously through her father in an attempt to better get to know him as a person. Berlin Calling is a story I can't wait to share with my friends and family. I highly recommend it!",1431043200,,351,4.661290322580645
7031088,5,B00U8BDLFW,"Here is a completely original take on a Holocaust survivor -- told from a highly unusual perspective... Former punk rock journalist Kastle Waserman turns 30 and sets out to investigate her own father's mysterious childhood concentration camp experiences... The journey takes the two of them around the globe and results in a series of increasingly surprising and heart-wrenching discoveries, leading to an enhanced father/daughter appreciation... Artfully and tastefully  directed by music-video guru Nigel Dick, this true-life story looks and feels like a well-crafted cinematic drama at every turn... Despite the central theme, ""Berlin Calling"" turns out to be unexpectedly uplifting family entertainment... Highly recommended!...",1428278400,2,732,6.038461538461538

7031091,4,B00U8BDLFW,"Berlin CallingBerlin  Calling; a very interesting WII movie; -- not really a Holocaust movies as such-- it' follows  a German Jewish family from their good  upper middle class  lives in Germany through the various Nazi-occupied countries  and  Theresesenstadt concentration camp and finally back in Berlin where the narrator ( the eldest son) meets and is honored by the mayor. It's biographical and there are no horrors described --  though  we're told  know some people were transported to camps and didn't survive  ( others did, including members of this family

7031098,5,B00U8BDLFW,"Students, especially young ones, are losing the opportunity to get the Holocaust story from a first person narrative. I appreciate how Kastle takes us along with her, opening letters in front of us and showing us the information as she finds it out for herself. I also appreciate the juxtaposition of her young days with her father's unknown experiences and the time it has taken along their journey through time to finally get to this point of dealing with the harsh reality of this story. My students are around the age of Ben and again, while Anne Frank is important as a first person source, with this resource students will be able to compare their own lives of privilege to the experiences of the Waserman's. I appreciate this story greatly and will be writing a thematic unit to integrate it into my curriculum.  The only thing I still wonder is about Kastle's mom and brother. Their integration would have made the story a bit more complete for me.",1469318400,,956,4.690476190476191
7031099,4,B00U8BDLFW,"Fascinating in the way it was possible - through the Red Cross - to track the paths of so many of the Jews who had been plucked from the streets of Germany and sent off to sundry transfer or extermination centers.  The young lady who is the ""star"" of the film is just enchanting as well. Well worth watching.",1466726400,,308,4.220338983050848

7031109,4,B00U8BDLFW,"Though I was thoroughly put off by the inappropriate punk music and Kastle's reference to the Heydrich assassins as being ""so punk rock"" of them to kill him, this was an amazing story of survival and redemption.

Kastle should have been a little less self-serving and more reverent not only to those who were victims of the Holocaust, but her own father and uncle who survived the Nazis for whom this documentary was to be about.  I don't think we needed to know about her love for The Clash and The Ramones (if she wasn't discussing them, she was wearing a concert tee and showing pictures of her as a punk chick in her youth.  Utterly detestable to fit her other agenda into this documentary!)

And obviously the title of this film is an homage to The Clash's ""London Calling"".",1445731200,4,779,4.542857142857143
7031110,4,B00U8BDLFW,Really liked the movie but I kept wondering where the family had settled in the United States and who founded the Holocaust memorial that was started in their city in Texas? Was a group? Did the father who had been in the camps start the memorial? If he started it how did he do it?  Why didn't the brother speak more and how did he feel I know he was very young at the time but there must have been feelings about it. What were his long term affects? But it was a good video and I really loved looking at her view as a American child of survivors and her search for her roots.,1444694400,,577,4.017391304347826

7031127,4,B00U8BDLFW,"Maybe I was just in a mood, but I found this documentary strangely compelling because it was so odd. Kastle Waserman is clearly a journalist and not a documentarian because the flow of her piece wasn't cohesive and it wasn't always clear where she was going with the story, even though she told a good story.  As her family's story unfolded it became very personal and I think that's what hooked me and kept me.  I mean, why would she show pictures of herself during her Goth period in the middle of a documentary about what the Nazis did to her family 70 years ago?  There actually was a good reason, but it illuminates why this was such an odd piece. Maybe in a different mood I would have stopped watching and passed it off as a poor documentary, but I'm glad I didn't.",1434412800,,772,4.347222222222222

7031133,5,B00U8BDLFW,"This has got to be one of the best documentaries on the Holocaust and survivors that I have ever seen, which is *really* saying something. I lived in Germany for a while after finishing school here in the United States, and I immersed myself in the history of Germany and Europe as a whole - good and bad.  I consider myself to be well versed in all things WWII and this film's facts are spot on.  The emotion and and gravity of this portion of German history is perfectly reflected in this film.  Must watch!",1432684800,,509,4.336842105263158
7031134,5,B00U8BDLFW,"I liked the way Kastle led the process of discovery. Her father's early life was mostly a mystery and he even didn't revisit the past. Only Kastle could do what she did, taking the initiative to investigate and experience what remains of this particular past. I could feel the love for one''s father throughout the film.

The pacing was terrific. At every moment I wanted to see what would happen next. This is also the mark of excellent editing. Even now I don't think of this film taking place over its seven years. My mind's eye sees it happening in sequence over less than a year.

There are perhaps an infinite number of deep meanings that will be conveyed to viewers over time. I experienced many while watching and also afterwards. These connections are too personal for me to be able to put them into words at this time.

I'd love to see more films by the people who made this one.",1432598400,,889,4.4753086419753085
7031135,5,B00U8BDLFW,"Kudos to Nigel Dick and  Kastle Waserman for bringing to the screen such a beautifully crafted account of one family's personal journey into the dark realities of the past and then back again into the enlightenment of today. I found it to be most thought provoking and unexpectedly uplifting at the end.  BERLIN CALLING is not a typical accounting of that dark period of history.  The true-life characters are compelling and infinitely likeable. I recommend it to all, no matter what  age or walk of life.",1432166400,,505,4.837209302325581
7031136,5,B00U8BDLFW,"When I originally watched Berlin Calling I thought it would be just another story about nazi Germany and the horrors of the hollocaust that I've seen 100's of times, but instead, this was an intensely personal journey. A very new, and amazing story perspective. The film not only highlights a focused trip for Kastle Wasserman into a dark past in search of answers, it also shows how Germany, and its people, are trying to both remember, and at the same time, move past this horrible period. It is emotionally engaging and informative in a way always lacking in other movies about the victims of the hollocaust.",1431561600,17,611,4.773584905660377
7031137,5,B00U8BDLFW,"This is much more of a personal journey story, about the lovely Kastle Waserman. What is unexpected, is how that journey blossoms, into the stories of Kastle's father and uncle, who are Holocost survivors; then her cousins, the children of survivors; those that do the support work of reminding us of, and honoring, those that suffered so greatly. This is a truly beautiful and gentle story, all stemming from a horrific time. I left the theater a much more compassionate person.",1431561600,,479,4.925925925925926

8704704,5,B00U8BDLFW,"One of the best Holocaust survivor documentaries that I've watched since ""Steal a Pencil for me"".
Kastle Waserman got in touch with the Red Cross and got the ball rolling to uncover her father's WW II past which he, his brother and his mother spent in Berlin at first, then in Theresienstadt/Terezin and Auschwitz at last.

Many of these documentaries only show Holocaust survivors being interviewed at home and in-between WW II clippings. This documentary however takes place not only in the US, but also in Berlin, Germany, where Kastle's father lived until he and his family were sent to Terezin. Kastle  drives to Terezin and later on finds her father's believed to be dead cousin in France.

I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderfully done docu, I was glued to the TV screen with tears in my eyes and was sad when it was over.
Thank you to Kastle Waserman for initiating this documentary (and please write the book that is mentioned towards the end!).",1525132800,,951,4.786585365853658

of  a tour guide person. Seeing it in person was a good way for me to learn about it. I thought the punk rock references were corny and
not necessary but almost a way to make it about her/kind of selfish. I wanted to learn from the dad-about his life and experiences during
the Holocaust.",1515888000,,424,4.367088607594937
