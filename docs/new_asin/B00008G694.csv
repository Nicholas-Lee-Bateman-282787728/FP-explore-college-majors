7984450,2,B00008G694,Found very boring and lacked instructional talent on most of the licks that are important in bluegrass! Would not recommend unless you want a history lesson on influences on the playing styles.,1476489600,,193,5.0625

7984453,5,B00008G694,"If you already know the rudiments of music, and you need to refine your playing with aural demonstrations of how the music is played, tempo, timbre, etc., Tony Rice's method is great for this.  I bought this for my husband and ended up listening to it myself because I play too and was classically trained while in college.  I would recommend this to someone who already has some basic knowledge, however, or has had a year of lessons.",1355184000,2,435,4.564102564102564
7984454,3,B00008G694,"This DVD contained some good commentaries and some great guitar playing.
But It is not a good teaching device. More of a listening experience.
Sorry, Tony !",1281916800,4,156,4.814814814814815
7984455,5,B00008G694,"Tony is a living legend in the bluegrass world. I wouldn't recommend this DVD for those who actually want to learn Tony's work, he doesn't go deep enough into it for the average guitar player to pick up a whole lot. But just watching him play in a living room type setting and explain certain concepts is well worth the price.",1200614400,3,326,4.360655737704918
