The program itself is astoundingly made and the John Downer direction and production comes off as good as the other ones like the one on Tigers, Wildebeest and Polar Bear. Real good stuff. The camera gets right into the pride and into the hunt! How much closer do you want to get than that! I loved every second of it and wanted it to be at least 10 hours long but it is around an hour long. Don't miss it and you should also get the Tiger DVD which is really cool.",1320192000,2,594,3.5692307692307694
