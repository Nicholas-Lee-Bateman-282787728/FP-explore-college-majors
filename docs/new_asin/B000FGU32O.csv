8122447,5,B000FGU32O,"We love these ""Mighty Machines"" videos.  They feature all types of machines -- live footage with dubbed humorous voices.  They're educational because they show and explain how various machines function, and a few catalog how certain machines are made as well.  Most, if not all, episodes are available on Netflix.  However, having these DVDs are convenient for trips and the like.  I was hoping that someone had a list of each episode per volume.  I'll try to add later if I can't find it.  We'd highly recommend.",1361059200,,513,4.827586206896552
