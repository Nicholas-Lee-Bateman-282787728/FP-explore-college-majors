1818065,1,B00007KK3B,"Murderous mice threaten to devour hospital patients unless they're taken to their leader Mickey...just kidding.

  At a mental health institution, the rats from a forgotten experiment (how anyone can forget an experiment I'll never understand, talk about a swiss cheese memory) have begun to mutate (of course) and eat the patients (guess the kitchen was out of head cheese) just as an undercover reporter checks in to do an inside story on the clinic (timing is everything, the proverbial hickory clock must not have struck one yet and the mouse is still running up it).

  Okay, I have to be honest, this movie was lame. The special effects were horrible. The mother rat looked like some cheesy Halloween house decoration you'd leave out on your porch to wipe your feet on. The rat spawns had such fake glowing red eyes you'd think they'd be blind (but then again they all had their tails and there were way more than three of them). There was even a ""Willard"" type character who had a telepathic bond with the rodents (all he must have heard was ""Brains! Brains! Must have fresh brains!"" because the rats decapitated their victims). Although if you're actually into B- horror flicks you may love this movie and think it's the Mouse King of the genre.

  Ron Perlman plays the head of the institution and the head of the forgotten experiment. It's a bad movie but he at least is, as always, good. Want to know more? Remember the remarks I made earlier about head cheese and decapitations?

  Definitely spend no more than a cost of a rental and definitely have a drink.",1104710400,2,1571,4.693430656934306
1818066,5,B00007KK3B,"KILLER RATS is one of those rare modern movies that captures much of the essence of the fifties and sixties ""killer monster"" movies.  Director Tibor Takacs manages to instill some real creepy moments as we are engrossed in this tale of mutant rats.  Sara Downing plays a reporter who goes ""undercover"" to investigate the goings on a HMO type facility.  She meets the esteemed doctor (Ron Perlman) and the obedient staff and soon senses something amiss.  Meanwhile, her boyfriend reporter (Michael Hagerty) tries to convince her to get out after a series of mysterious disappearances.  Michael Zelniker plays the maintenance man who has a mysterious connection with the rats; Bailey Chase plays a drug addict who is a handsome action movie star; and Denise Dowse plays Rose, the bitchy roommate of Sara.  The CGI generated rats of course don't look real, but they are scary nonetheless.  The movie has an eerie atmospheric pacing and I forgive the numerous plot loopholes because it's a scary movie!  If you like this kind of thriller, you won't be disappointed.",1077235200,3,1061,4.988636363636363
1818067,4,B00007KK3B,"Killer Rats has more substance than most killer beastie movies although it leaves me a little confused as to the set layout.
Sewer workers find a blocked-off doorway.  One leaves to find a new way around while the other breaks open the seal.  He pokes his head in the wall and is promptly yanked in.  The other worker returns.  She gets a look at something in the hole and runs.  She gets caught.
We then see a troubled blond woman, Samantha, get delivered to a private sanitarium.  There she is forced to fit in.  We meet some of the other characters, including the ruthless head doctor, and discover that the rats are free in the building.
All is not quite as it seems.  Samantha is actually an undercover reporter trying to report of possibly deteriorating conditions after privatization.  People start disappearing and Samantha may have seen something but she was medicated at the time.
The movie gets pretty intense as the rats get bolder and we learn more about their relationship with some of the facility's staff.  There is one scene of a disturbed girl who had seen her lover killed by the rats.  She knows they are after  her and that she has no way of escaping the padded room where she is on suicide watch.  As the rats arrive, she manages to bite a wrist sufficiently to commit suicide.
The movie's effect vary somewhat throughout the film.  One scene shows rats scurrying toward a door and they look like toys being pulled on strings.  the big main rat sometimes looks very real and at other times it looks two-dimensional.  But one thing is constant, the rats have glowing red eyes that emit malevolence in every scene.
I will not spoil the twists and surprises but I was somewhat confused during some of the action scenes as to what was basement and what was sewer.  I was not sure why the characters could not find a way out.  But it's a good film with plenty of atmosphere and some good solid framework.",1058140800,4,1921,4.551020408163265
1818068,1,B00007KK3B,"This movie is proof that I will watch any [thing]they have at the movie store. But, a one liner ironically describes what you will be thinking while and after you watch this plane crash: ""This is definately....not good for my sobriety.""
A girl is an undercover reporter that moves into a mental ward trying to see if they hurt the mentally ill people, little does she know that the head Psychiatrist and some....dude? Are performing horrible atrocities on rats.
The guy, which I think is the janitor becomes mentally bonded with the big momma rat, saying she ""feeds off his thoughts"" ... Well anyway the rats become physcho, yes physco they got red eyes and love blood. When your watching the film you wonder if the producers just went over the film with a red highlighter or something, dotting the eyes of the rats. But watch out kiddies, there is a big huge alpha rat thing, which when he comes on screen looks like a cgi smear as it jumps and attacks ... and old women. This whole movie seems aimless, you don't know if they are trying to appeal to 80's horror movie fans with the minimal blood and gore they show or PETA members when they preach about animal cruelty, which is the main motive for why the rats went nuts. Oh yes and another one liner ""Time...for a little 1on1 therapy!"", ...
The highlight of this film would have to be the crazy girl chewing her arm off for no reason other than she is nuts. Even though the idea of killer rats is far from cliche, Lets be for real here; I mean honestly, who is scared of someone mutating rats into physco rats? Not me, thus takeing away a scary movies lasting appeal giving it nothing to generate fear off of. The climax is as entertaining and anti-clamtic as Archie Bunker takeing a big joe.
But don't fret because a whole lot of monster rats came out a of trash can at the end, leaveing this horrible movie open for what sees to be a even worse sequel.
A sterling example that rat horror movies can't be any good.",1054252800,2,1969,4.412087912087912
1818069,4,B00007KK3B,"didn't expect much when watching this movie and it turned out to be really good, a great low budget movie!  there's so many bad creature movies out there now days but this one definitely sticks out among the crowd.  body count is plenty high with plenty of blood and guts and the giant rat is pretty cool.  plenty of non stop action and the acting is all well done.  have to recommend this film for the fans of the nature amok category for sure, check her out",1050710400,2,459,4.241379310344827
1818070,4,B00007KK3B,"I've been a fan of Tibor Tacaks since I was a little kid and ""The Gate"" made me afraid to get off the bed during the night, and at the same time launched the career of Steve Dorff.  He went on to direct such classics as ""Gate 2"" and ""I, Madman"".  Even now, as I reminisce, the ice in my glass popped and I nearly had a heart attack.  I can thank Tibor for that scare as well.  He even directed the original Sabrina, the Teenage Witch movie and a few (the better and darker) episodes of the show.
On to ""Killer Rats""...  The title says it all.  I had only to see it on the shelf (""Oh, heavens, another killer rat tale."") and then see the director (""All, right!  Finally a killer rat tale we can enjoy."")  Not since Peter Weller donned a catcher's uniform and demolished his Brownstone with a baseball bat with bear traps attached in ""Of Unknown Origin"" have I been treated to such a screen masterpiece.  I've seen and read them all, guys, I have no shame.  ""Deadly Eyes"" and ""The Rats,"" both loosely based on the James Herbert book (to which he penned two sequels, I know from experience).  ""The Junkyard"" by Barry Porter (The best book of them all, a middle school nightmare factory of rats killing kids in a junkyard.  King wishes he dreamed this one up, my twelve-year-old hands shook for an hour after finishing this one.) and ""The Visitor"" by Chauncey G. Parker, III, the basis for the best rat movie of them all, ""Of Unknown Origin,"" also of interest to Shannon Tweed fans.  Disregard Mario Bava's schlockfest ""Rats,"" which contained one good scene that was given away by the VHS box cover.  Disregard ""Willard"" and ""Ben"" and that horrible Michael Jackson song. Disregard Bert I. Gordon's ""Food of the Gods"" and its cheap dollhouse sets and gerbils passing for rats, or the inferior sequel ""...Part 2"" about mutant rats in a lab, wherein the cutest rat dies in a heartwrenching finale... (yeah, right) but I digress.
""Killer Rats"", if made in the late '80's or early '90's, would have passed the special effects margin.  Remember the great claymation Takacs treated us to in the ""Gate"" movies and ""Madman""?  He uses something similar here, in '03, to create the rats.  They are cartoonish and clean against a dirty background.  The story is about a girl reporter who sneaks (?) into a mental institution and discovers a rat problem that is out of control.  She tries to break out with her boyfriend's help, but there are many unforeseen difficulties.  Could the experiment be controlled by a doctor who has a telepathic link with a great big cheesy looking mama rat with a taste for blood and a lack of compassion for human life?  Could it BE?!!  Ron Perlman has a typically over the top role as the director of the hospital, the only name in the whole flick, but we don't care do we, my brothers?
How could we?
Tacaks gave us a killer rat film with a title that didn't try to be artsy, a film that took us back to the dark corners of our childhood for 90 minutes.  We can allow cheesy effects and we can allow intentionally (benefit of the doubt) bad acting.  We can allow these things because Tacaks is the man who gave the world Steve Dorff and Christa Denton and the Sun Volt rocket that saved the world.  Pretend you're young Douglas in a warped Ray Bradbury tale and take the mental trip back to the eighties and slide ""Killer Rats"" in the DVD player (that we wish we had back then) and think, ""If I was in the seventh grade this would have scared my pants off.""
It would have.  Buy it and see.
Thanks again Tibor.",1049760000,3,3525,4.434782608695652

7977511,2,B00007KK3B,"Rented the movie and it's a interesting movie but it was good and not good at the same time.  Some parts seemed like it could be better even for a 'B' movie.  Though one of the things that bothered me was that some of the rats seemed to be done with cheap CG and didn't seem to all that great like with other movies that use CG for live action.  The acting on the other hand wasn't that bad but I think it could have been better and the writing seemed a bit weak.  Although with the audio it seemed like that it was a on a bit of a low side cause I had to try to figure out what sound on the TV to have it on and turning it up a bit to hear.  As for a horror movie, it don't stack up well with the other horror movies out there and the gore seems to be up there a bit even for a TV movie.  Overall I give Killer Rats 2.5 stars out of 5.",1299888000,,836,3.642458100558659
7977512,1,B00007KK3B,"Rats (Tibor Takacs, 2003)

Over the last five years, the name of Tibor Takacs has come to be synonymous with awful SyFy Channel Original Movies. He is the brain behind such worthless pieces of cinematic history as Ice Spiders, NYC: Tornado Terror, Megasnake, and the dumbest-named SFCOM of all time, Mansquito. But back in 2003, Takacs was just another low-budget director who'd done one thoroughly awesome eighties horror flick (The Gate, starring a young Stephen Dorff no less) and a bunch of, well, Sabrina the Teenage Witch. (Okay, so I've had a crush on Melissa Joan Hart forever. Sue me.) So Rats, the movie that propelled Takacs into immortality by showing the gods at what was then the Sci-Fi Channel that this guy could make really, horrifically, hilariously bad horror movies, blindsided the world. The guy who made The Gate made this? Believe it, bud. And better yet, he managed to con a guy who was still flying a bit under the radar as one of the finest actors of our time into appearing in it.

The scene: the Brookdale Institute, a rehab center for the rich, famous, and those found overdosed in nightclub bathrooms. Or something like that, because why else would a former movie star (more on him later) wind up in a place that looks like it should have been condemned yesterday? In any case, as we open, a young woman named Samantha (The Forsaken's Sara Downing), who did, in fact, overdose in a nightclub bathroom, is brought in by the cops and introduced to the staff. There's Matilda (Ray's Denise Dowse), the no-nonsense matron of the bunch. There's Lenny (Michael Clayton's Sean Cullen), the intern/muscleman. Ernst (Naked Lunch's Michael Zelniker), a former patient turned janitor. And then there's the guy who runs the whole shindig, Dr. Winslow (Ron Perlman). They all seem above-board and really interested in helping the clients, but the clients? They're kind of nuts. Samantha is shown to her room and sedated. Sometime during the night she wakes up and blearily finds the mute Cypress (Eyes of Crystal's Desislava Tenekedjieva) sitting by her bed, curled around a music box, whispering ""they're watching you"". Okay, that's bad enough, but when she wakes up the next morning, she meets Rose (Eileen Grubba, who recently turned up on Sons of Anarchy), her foulmouthed, obnoxious roommate. Can things get any worse? Yeah, of course they can, but former movie star Johnny Falls (Saving Grace's Bailey Chase), at least, seems like he's going to be the one solid friend she has. Then the patients start going missing, and Samantha has a secret of her own...

...but Tibor Takacs has no secrets. Especially secrets about CGI. The CGI here is so obvious and amateurish that you wonder why they didn't just build a big rubber rat and wave it around on a stick; it would have looked a lot more realistic. Add to that a script that somehow took four otherwise variably-talented people to write (original story by Boaz Davidson, whose original stories fueled Mansquito and the eighties dance flick Salsa, among others; Davidson's sometime partner Jace Anderson, who teamed up with him for a few halfway decent flicks like Toolbox Murders and Morutary; Adam Gierasch, who also worked on the aforementioned two movies; this trio, by the way, were also responsible for the horror that was Mother of Tears; and the usually-uncredited Brian Irving, usually a producer, but was also the writer for the English adaptation of Vampire Hunter D) and still managed to be predictable, clich&eacute;-ridden, and all-around silly, set decoration that kinda worked on the creep factor but made very little sense with the story, and me wondering for an hour and a half what in the flying hell Ron Perlman was doing in this flick. Upon reflection, one can say the same for Michael Zelniker, whose career started out with small roles in very prestigious movies (Bird especially stands out in his early resume, as The City of Lost Children does in Perlman's). In any case, I guess a few folks had to make rent...

It's a terrible, terrible movie, and you don't want to go anywhere near it unless you play drinking games having to do with CGI rats. *",1286409600,,4146,4.868271954674221
