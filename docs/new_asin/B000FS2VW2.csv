2582575,5,B000FS2VW2,"During a battle on his home world, the Chaos Emeralds are scattered into space to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Metarex, an alien race that destroy everything in its path as they search for the Planet Eggs, the vital life force of every life-sustaining Planet.

Sonic and his friends now have to recover the Chaos Emeralds to thwart the Metarex plans and to prevent the death of their world. Meanwhile Dr Eggman has plans of his own.

Sonic X season 5 includes the return of Chris Thorndyke & Shadow the Hedgehog and introduces a new character ""Cosmo"", who asks for Sonic's help after her space craft crashes. This is must buy for any true Sonic fan.

To clear up any confusion, this IS season 5 as the show was broken down into 13 episodes per season for American audiances only. There should be at least two more seasons to follow this release.",1163030400,3,864,4.5256410256410255
2582576,1,B000FS2VW2,"It should be noted that the Amazon description for this product is wrong. It does NOT contain both English and Japanese audio tracks. No 4Kids DVDs ever do (save for a few rare, uncut releases).

Sonic X may not be one of 4Kids WORST dubbed animes, but it ranks fairly high. Things are edited out for seemingly no reason, even the mildest of violence is cut, Japanese text and refferences are blanked and not even translated, and entire episodes are re-arranged. Not to mention, plenty of refferences to the Sonic games are not translated properly.

Do not buy this set if you are looknig for a high-quality, entertaining product.",1161561600,13,630,4.770642201834862
2582577,1,B000FS2VW2,"This was the WORST dubbed season of the series ever, I would stick to just downloading the originals or finding imports of them on eBay if you can.  The way this season was butchered, the way these characters were voiced, The replacement music added, the stuff changed in this dub, insulting.  Jason Griffith is the WORST voice actor I have ever heard, have you actually listened to him in Sonic Riders?  The way he made Sonic say ""Yeah"" compared to the way Ryan said it in ""Sonic Advance 3"" and other games is insulting to the character.  I was originally looking forward to this but then when I saw how much it was altered and edited, I just could not watch anymore

Don't buy this DVD, you would be better off just recording the episodes off of TV for yourself.",1150934400,9,764,4.428571428571429
8125743,5,B000FS2VW2,"This is like the first Sonic Anime Show ever!
It even inspired by the new generation of
Sonic Games. And soon, I'm going to get those
dvds of the show. And even if they make a sequal of
that show. And even get these dvd if there are
24 dollars. Sonic X is Awsome!",1307836800,,263,3.888888888888889
8125744,3,B000FS2VW2,"For Younger People:
It's a good show for kids 12 years old and under. I loved the anime when it first came out. I was also about 12ish gave or take. For 12 year olds and younger the story line is usually very easy to follow and there are a few laughs along the way. I recommend that if you want to get a good Sonic series go and get Sonic saTam. You can buy a one set deal here on amazon. it will have four DVD's in them with about...28 episodes give or take. I don't quite remember. The storyline is better and just as a whole it's just a lot more fun to watch. The bad guys aren't as wimpy either. But for 12 year olds Sonic X isn't that bad. It's pretty fun to watch when your that age and unlike older Sonic fans they won't focus everything that is wrong about the anime.

 For Older/other anime People:
Anyone much older tends to not like the show because of some of the characters, voice actors, plot, etc. The show follows a basic outline of some of the games such as Sonic adventure, sonic adventure 2, and sonic battle. Those are the only games that they included in the series. Note that they do not do a very good job on trying to follow the games and how they layed out. otherwise the series itself has it's own storyline to attend to. I did not like the fact that they were on different planets when clearly in the newer games they live on a earth like planet with humans and clearly in comics ,and older games, that they live on the planet mobius (with only antropomorphic animals).",1278028800,,1496,4.173010380622838
