It was especially helpful when he went over specific food types recommended for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  As a physician, I also appreciate that he explains things from a medical point of view. Ie. the same diet is beneficial for decreasing risk of coronary artery disease, cerebral microvascular disease, age related hearing loss, renovascular hypertension & obesity related neoplasia. He also mentions the science of epidemiology whereby much can be learned from populations with proven longevity with regard to dietary choice, physical activity & familial & community relationships as being psychologically supportive to improve immune function.",1290729600,,806,5.5528455284552845
8185558,5,B000OLG5Y0,"I am a physician with a busy schedule. I know I need to eat healthy to keep healthy. However I have not been very good with the quantity and quality of food I consume.

At work I just go to cafeteria and eat what looks or tastes good without paying attention to their caloric content, nutritonal value and what it does to my blood cholesterol, LDL(lousy lipids) and HDL.

I find that Dr. Rogers diet book provides me with a simple way of eating healthy. His diet plan doesnot call for radical change. He enlightens me with a simple approach. It makes sense to me when his diet plan is not simply targeted to loosing weight, but to think about lowering risk of  stroke, heart attack, peripheral vascular disease  etc.

I want to have energy to carry on the days work without geting tired, not become irritable when you get stressed.

While I have not fully familiarized with every thing in DVD, I like what I see and I have already made certain changes to food consumtpion. For example I used lot of sugar in my coffee and drank whole milk. I have cut down on coffee, sugar and replaced whole milk with 1% milk. I increased my vegetable intake and I eat cereal more so than reaching out for greasy foods.

I know Dr. Rogers put in lot of time into sorting out a maze of confusion that exists in figuring out what is nutritious food and one that is easy to follow

I recommend this DVD to those who care to stay healthy.",1176595200,4,1418,4.324528301886793
8185559,5,B000OLG5Y0,"Like so many of today's professional people, I also was too pre-occupied and time starved to realize the significance of maintaining a healthy diet.

  After experiencing triple by-pass heart surgery, I realized we are all vulnerable, especially when a proper diet is neglected. Viewing ""The Rogers Diet"" by Peter Rogers MD on DVD prompted me to recommend to others his well formulated and simple to follow diet plan. Maintaining a healthy diet through my life may have preventd my need for surgery. This is now my plan to stay healthy.

  I also believe this DVD would be an excellent re-hab presentation for recovering patients after surgery to help them maintain a healthy life style.

  An excellent gift for ""loved ones"".",1176336000,3,726,4.983333333333333
8185560,5,B000OLG5Y0,"In the tempest of health and diet resources that regularly assaults the ""diet program pilgrim"" seeking clear and concise solutions, Dr. Rogers has produced an indispensable resource that is both comprehensive and comprehensible.  Confusion reigns in the panoply of programs being marketed today to help those seeking enlightenment on the essential links between nutrition and improved health in all its inter-related dynamic dimensions.  The Rogers Diet (not to be confused with exhaustive lifestyle programs advocated by those proposing more holistic approaches to health) is an essential tool for those who struggle to understand and positively affect their food choices, metabolism and physical/emotional health.  Well worth the the modest investment of time and money for those who have been frustrated by the myriad of fad diets only to learn they eventually lead to life-style trade-offs which result in failure and frustration.",1175731200,3,934,5.6571428571428575
8185561,5,B000OLG5Y0,"I beta tested this diet.  I am Peter's big brother.  For years he had been telling me to eat better and to take better care of myself.  We had relatives who suffered from heart disease and my brother told me he liked having me around.  So I finally said fine I would do it. I started the diet and began working out six mornings a week.

When I started I weighed 247 pounds and had almost no endurance.  Today I weigh 227 pounds and am well on my way to a target weight of 200 pounds.

I have lost an average of 2 pounds a week without feeling hungry, fatigued or anxious.  My endurance has increased and I have not suffered any loss of muscle mass which can come from other diet plans.

This diet plan is not a fad.  Try Dr. Rogers' diet plan - it makes sense, it is easy to follow and it works.",1174953600,4,795,4.006369426751593
