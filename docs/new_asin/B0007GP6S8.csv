2211607,1,B0007GP6S8,"I doubt that Edgar Allan Poe would want to put his name to this total piece of garbage. The film to DVD transfer was horrible and most of it was either fuzzy are hard to see. 15 minutes in I wanted to just shut it off but figured I at least needed to finish it to give it a fair review. I was wrong, 15 minutes would have been good enough, in short it never got any better.
45 minutes into this dribble the reporter finally realized the nuts had taken over, talk about dim. One hour in there was a short orgy and throughout several T&A shots even though it was fuzzy it helps take your mind off of this waste of time.
I can only hope the director ""Juan Moctezuma"" needed money really bad to agree to make this so called film, if not I at least hope he hasn't butchered another film.
Run far and fast away from this cinematic abortion and don't look back.",1356652800,2,854,4.089285714285714
2211608,3,B0007GP6S8,"This Jodorowsky inspired film should be seen at least once and I imagine that it would hold up fairly well in an Ivy League course on film criticism.  A lot of the film veers to near surrealism, but manages to remain fairly linear in the story and plot.  This is noticeably different from Moctezuma's other notorious film, Alucarda, which is more visceral and physically horrifying, while this is horrifying on a more abstract level.  I thought it was entertaining, I don't know if I could call it a favorite, the story is a fairly basic morality tale, but the visuals are on a whole interesting.  There will, of course, be a large body of viewers that dislike this film, claiming that it's an 'art' film with a lot of nonsensical and ridiculous imagery and scenes (the cover depicts a good example, and that claim is partially true) - but I'm not entirely convinced that this film lacks any redemption, and is simply an exercise in patience.  There are some interesting things happening in the movie, and while some parts don't succeed, other parts of the film are executed very well and open the opportunity for speculation and discussion on what the director wants the audience to see and comprehend.",1318204800,2,1203,4.7368421052631575
2211609,5,B0007GP6S8,"I can't begin to tell you how much I enjoyed this flick, or how I could have missed it back in the 70's. (I'm betting that US distribution was limited, if indeed it was released here). It's one of those 'Midnight Movies' that should have been playing in Greenwich Village every weekend. It's equal parts (early) Terry Gilliam, A.Jodorowsky, Fernando Arrabel, Luis Bunuel and Ken Russell, with a dash of Fellini added as seasoning. Indelible imagery, acid-psych soundtrack, magnificent lunacy that's as surreal as a Carlos Casteneda novel from the same time period. A peyote-influenced fever dream to be ingested again and again. I enjoyed it a lot more than his other work from Mondo Macabro,'Alucarda', and I did enjoy that one as well.

2211610,5,B0007GP6S8,"Dr Tarr's Torcher Dungeon or The Mansion of Madness as it was also called is a very bizarre yet fascinating take on a pretty generic movie concept.  The films stars Arther Hansel as a reporter traveling to France in order the write a article of this doctors revolutionary new techniques in dealing with the mentally derange. Little is know about the man so he sent off to investigate.
  When he arrives to the facility and meets said doctor, he notices that things are a tad bit off with him and his so called patients. For one thing the patients are running around playfully trying to kill him. Another thing is that the doctor is always laughing at something like he just lit up before the cameras started shooting (something i highly recommend before watching this movie). Slowly the reported starts to realize that (to the surprise of no one)the hospital has been taken over by the mental patience themselves.  What happens after that is a series of hilarious exchanges between the reporter and the fake doctor as he and one of the real doctors daughter try to escape the MADDNESS.
  Over all i say that this is a good movie.  Its a very suspenseful comedy. Much more so than Con Air if that makes any sense. The atmosphere is mostly eerie but the soundtrack is just plan goofy. There are some moments in the movie that don't fit in with the horror aspect of the film, but to me that just adds to the madness.  Oh and if you do watch this movie remember to watch out for MR. Chicken.",1280448000,,1487,4.481481481481482

2211613,4,B0007GP6S8,"This film is quite odd but it is also a lot of fun and I'm glad I bought it!  It's not a small film, either, with a large cast, wonderful costumes & camera work and parts of it were shot in large, old & seemingly abandoned buildings.  It's not really an ""R"" kind of film at all but its perspective may confuse or seem unpleasant to some.  Some of the dialogue is in English and some isn't but it's not the worst dub job around by any means.",1201132800,2,440,3.977272727272727
2211614,1,B0007GP6S8,"Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon (apparently a shortened - by some eleven minutes - American release of The Mansion of Madness) may very well make your eyes bleed down your cheeks, leave you with both index fingers permanently embedded in your ears, and rob you of your very will to live.  Even though the story is based to some degree on a story by Edgar Allen Poe, The System of Dr. Tarr and Professor Feather, attaching Poe's name to this film just seems so incredibly wrong.  I mean, this is one putrid, nonsensical mess of a movie.  Some people actually seem to find it fascinating, but I would rather rip my own tongue out and eat it than to ever see this film again.  I was shocked to learn it dates back to 1973, as the remarkably bad print of the film I watched (which was, admittedly, a public domain offering) led me to believe it was much older.  It's a Mexican film (apparently director Juan Moctezuma's first feature) featuring one of the ugliest sets I've ever seen (apparently an old abandoned warehouse).  It's not really horror, so don't be fooled by the name.  I guess it's some kind of exploitation comedy or something.  Now maybe you call watching grown men dress up like chickens and crows to perform elaborate dances or listening to some prissy Napoleon wannabe break out into maniacal laughter far too often funny, but I certainly don't.  Even the comical music that accompanies one bound victim having to hop his way through the forest was more discordant than humorous.

As for the story, you have a reporter named Gaston Leblanc (Arthur Hansel) seeking the famed Dr. Maillard (Max Kerlow) at his lunatic asylum to learn more about his unique treatment method.  As he tours the place with the doc, he can't help noticing that the lunatics are basically running amuck and that the good doctor is a few cards short of a full deck.  After visiting the dungeon and seeing how the doctor is mistreating his patients, he's convinced that this apparent mad man is not Dr. Maillard at all.  By then, of course, it's too late for him to escape the awful place.  The action (if you can call it that) culminates in a big banquet, with ""Dr. Maillard"" (Claudio Brook) going on and on about his plans to take over other parts of the world with his ""system"" and making more immediate plans to take care of Leblanc and Maillard's daughter (Ellen Sherman), who Leblanc took quite a shine to early on.  Will they somehow escape with their lives?  Who cares?

It took me two days to get through this lousy movie.  There is some nudity, but even that doesn't make the film any less painful to watch.  The whole story is just hopeless nonsense, there's basically no torture to speak of in the film, and I'm still looking for Dr. Tarr because I didn't notice anyone by that name in the film.  This film should be rated DH for Deep Hurting.",1184112000,,2837,4.558185404339251
2211615,4,B0007GP6S8,"If the budget for this movie was over $10,000 or so it must have been spent on recreational drugs for the cast. From the start it looks to be a total waste but actually improves as the story unfolds, sometimes pretty funny and creative. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that enjoys cheap ""cult classics"", although it might be a little over priced. I'm sorry I didn't see it in the 70s when the Acid would have given me a different perspective.",1173484800,4,452,4.457831325301205
2211616,4,B0007GP6S8,"The first entry in the short film career of director Juan Lopez Moctezuma, The Mansion of Madness  is a fine example of South of the Border Surrealism, and as such, shares more of a  kinship with the works of Alejandro Jodorowsky and Fernando Arrabal, than with Moctezuma's later film (also on DVD) Alucarda.  Based in part on Edgar Allan Poe's The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Feather, The Mansion of Madness tells the story of Gaston (Arthur Hansel) who, having recently returned from abroad, travels to an asylum nestled in the heart of a secluded forest.  During the opening voice over, Gaston reveals that it was in this remote asylum that his father died, and under the guise of meeting with the head of the institution (a doctor named Maillard who employs unorthodox methods of treatment for patients) Gaston hopes to uncover the mystery shrouding his deceased father. However, this initial motivation is quickly abandoned once Gaston is given a grand tour of the sanitarium by the infamous ""Dr. Maillard"" (played with psychotic abandon by Claudio Brook) resulting in the discovery that the lunatics are actually running the asylum, and that the real Maillard and his staff are being held captive.
 Unlike Alucarda, the premise of The Mansion of Madness  provided Moctezuma with a concept in which to explore his Surrealist inclinations, and let his crazed imagination run wild.  The film also reveals Moctezuma dabbling with absurd humor, the results of which are quite funny, and again help solidify his association to Surrealism. Although this film marked his directorial debut, Moctezuma's direction seems confident, his artistic vision clear, and he does not display many of the telltale signs of a novice director. In addition, the cinematography is of a high caliber, as are many of the performances from a very large cast.  In this type of a story the mise-en-scene is crucial and thankfully the locations are wonderful, helping to create a palpable atmosphere of decay, and yes, madness. Perhaps due to the freewheeling nature of the narrative, the film does tend to lag on occasion. However, there is enough going on throughout to hold the viewer's interest, and the final fifteen minutes (highlighted by inmates performing a synchronized chicken dance) are well worth waiting around for.
 This is another fine release from Mondo Macabro, featuring a great film transfer and a Spanish audio track with English subtitles.  The handful of extras include - a director bio, the U.S. trailer, an interview with director Guillermo del Toro (also on the Alucarda disc) who discusses Moctezuma and actor Claudio Brook, an essay on the film, a director filmography, and a Mondo Macabro trailer highlighting past, present, and future releases.",1106784000,35,2757,5.120267260579064

2211628,5,B0007GP6S8,"Juan L&oacute;pez Moctezuma worked in close quarters with esoteric Director Alejandro Jodorowsky, who brought us The Holy Mountain and El Topo. The influence shows in Mansion of Madness, one of the weirdest films you'll ever enjoy. It's darkly hilarious, experimental without being tedious, and showcases incredibly bizarre imagery ranging from sources as varied as The Divine Comedy and Alfred Jarry's Ubu plays. While some may be disappointed that this isn't, strictly speaking, a formulaic horror film, connoisseurs of the unusual, hedonistic, and esoteric will be delighted. Taking Edgar Allen Poe's 'The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether' as a departure point, Moctezuma creates an entire microcosm of indulged madness where inmates act out their delusions. Highlights include a band of inmates playing music on crustacean parts, men with knives dancing in crow suits, nude bodies used as fruit trays, a chicken-man, a cameo by Dante Alighieri, and countless other strange treats. Anyone complaining of the darkness of the transfer hasn't seen the Mondo Macabro version, which uses a crisp print. It baffles me that this film doesn't receive the credit it deserves, perhaps because many have only seen it as a badly cut-up poor print on one of those atrocious '100 Horror Films' sets. I'd urge you to give it a chance. It will reward those with dark wit and a touch of whimsical lunacy.",1397779200,5,1400,5.199115044247788

2211636,3,B0007GP6S8,"FULL REVIEW FROM FILMPHREAK.TUMBLR.COM
First, despite any of the number of things that would suggest this is a horror movie, THE MANSION OF MADNESS really isn't exactly a horror movie. Its not without its shocking and disturbing visuals, but they're not the whole package and, truth be told, THE MANSION OF MADNESS is more or less an art film. Not that horror films cant be art films or vice versa, but some movies are just, plainly and simply, arthouse movies. This one, from the director of ALUCARDA (a horror film, and one whose review will appear here very shortly), and allegedly inspired by a Poe tale, is a deliberate exercise in absurdism. Reminiscent of not only Fellini but also Spains Fernando Arrabal - in fact, kind of a mixture of those two - this movie proves the mettle of its title by offering up a setting that is none other than a mansion. Of madness. But don't expect just any old asylum or what not; this things packed with loonies but the guy in charge also clearly needs an OUT OF THE OFFICE sign on his own gourd. Therapy amounts to explore your creativity, which, to be more specific, amounts to some pretty extreme s***. Theres a giant metal structure that, when finished, will supposedly be able to connect with the nervous system. Theres a guy who has embraced chickenhood - being a bird, I mean, not being a coward. There are all sorts of bonkers but beautiful visuals on display in the films foray through the titular madness. One could endlessly debate what it all means, but Ill leave that to the viewer. Which is you. What? Yes, you can be a reader and a viewer, just not generally at the same time.",1362268800,5,1632,4.554421768707483

8047253,1,B0007GP6S8,"Twenty-plus years ago, psychotronic me would've liked this film. Not anymore. I've read a bit about Juan Lopez Moctezuma in various film books over the years and this film was my first experience with his work. After 82 minutes of my life I won't get back, I'm not sure if I'll be looking for more Moctezuma in the future, even his supposed-classic Alucarda.

Lots of surrealism along with a crazy, over-the-top performance by Claudio Brook as Dr. Maillard. His was really the only enjoyable performance of the film, especially if you like schlocky ham (hey, I'm a Lugosi fan from way back so cut me some slack!). Arthur Hansel has the personality of piece of plywood and is way too old for the role he was playing. Ellen Sherman is an admittedly beautiful leading lady but was unfortunately given very little to do, outside of one terrific scene of her dancing while supposedly under the influence of the cult priest (I say supposedly because of how the scene ends and what transpires later). The rest of the cast was quite frankly forgettable.

There's lots of nudity, including a mildly-jarring rape scene early, but little torture or horror. To say this was loosely-based on Poe's ""The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Feather"" is giving this movie too much credit. The whole thing screams of a movie jumping up and down, waving its arms frantically while yelling, ""Hey! Look at me! See how arty I am?"" And considering the time this was made, it has plenty of psychedelia too. The use of ""kooky hi-jinks music"" during various pursuit-escape scenes is when the whole thing went off the rails for me. At that point, what suspense had been built up completely disappeared and I then realized what it was I was watching.

All in all, a very disappointing experience with Juan Lopez Moctezuma and his work. At least it was Prime.",1467936000,3,1831,4.733542319749216
