7890513,5,6305473889,"Received very quickly from supplier and dvd was brand new in packaging. Absolutely loved the movie. It's one of those feel good movies that just makes you think about friendship, family and life. The movie is about three friends who are inseparable from a young age. They grow up together and the movie follows them through adulthood where they remain close. I don't believe in spoilers so that's all I'll write about the plot. Do yourself a favor and buy the movie, you'll be glad you did.",1385251200,2,490,4.64367816091954

7890518,4,6305473889,"Although this movie was about 3 male friends growing up in New York, anyone who has ever had one or two good friends can relate.  It was a sweet movie that touched on some real life situations and showed how friendship  can grow and be more cherished as the years go by.  After I watched it, I  wanted so much to find the song that played at the end to share with my  best friend.  But alas, I cannot find it.",960768000,9,409,3.9876543209876543
