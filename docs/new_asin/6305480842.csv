8166337,3,6305480842,"""The Collision of the Andrea Doria"" is a fairly amateurishly made DVD that was evidently produced for the educational market. It is extremely expensive, and while some of it is fascinating, it has poor production values, and is generally not a good value for the money.

Apparently this was made in Kenosha, Wisconsin by a company named Southport Video Productions. While I agree that this is an interesting subject, the script and production in general come across as dated and amateurish. In particular, the repetitive narration device featuring a gentleman in a spartanly furnished office is boring at best. (This narration device reminded me of a similar device employed by J.R. Bookwalter in his opus, ""Chickboxer."")

On a positive note, though, there is some interesting archival footage of the ""Andrea Doria"" and ""Stockholm"" featured. Several people (some of whom are survivors) are interviewed, and while I believe there is more than enough blame to go around in this case, the analysis seems biased in the direction of the Italian Line. Toward the end of the DVD there is more contemporary dive footage of the ""Doria"" shown, including some interior investigations, which were fascinating (if a bit disjointed.)

This is a good DVD for the ""Andrea Doria"" completist, but is grossly overpriced and amateurishly produced. I gave it three stars for good intentions and important subject matter.",1117238400,9,1399,5.18141592920354
8166338,2,6305480842,"Being one of the few videos on the sinking of the Andrea Doria I was disapointed with this from the start.  The version I have is on DVD, and is a very poor quality copy, very gassy.
This documentary is about an hour in length, and was made very cheaply.  A large portion of the video shows a narrator, with the rest of the video made up of photographs that were filmed out of pages of books, and clips from the public domain Universal Newsreel of the sinking of the Andrea Doria.
There are some interviews with survivors of the sinking, interviewed at a yearly gathering of Andrea Doria survivors at a Long Island restaurant, as well as some underwater footage of the wreck, but overall I found this a highly disapointing program.",1087948800,3,731,4.488721804511278
