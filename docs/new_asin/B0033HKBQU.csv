4065365,5,B0033HKBQU,"I'm typically cynical about anything that is not proven-fact/black & white/brick & mortar, and I've definitely never been into mythology. After watching Mythic Journeys, I still can't say I'm a fan of mythology per se, but the ideas and philosophies that seem to inspire the movie - as well as the fictional characters and ""real"" individuals we're introduced to - were also inspiring to me and my family. The film itself is exceptionally done. It's extremely imaginative but still firmly rooted in reality. It's very engaging, thought-provoking and never ""talks down"" to its audience. The idea that I came away with after watching the movie is that you create your own reality, and that my reality is possibly as good a story - if not even better a story - than the best literature I've ever read. It's a fun and intriguing notion, and for that alone I rated it very highly.",1302652800,41,874,4.756578947368421
4065366,5,B0033HKBQU,"I first must admit to a certain conflict of interest here, in that I helped to organize the Mythic Journeys conferences which formed the initial inspiration for this film. But the Boe's have taken the question of myth's meaning in modern life in their own direction and have made a wonderful film about it. Even without the fascinating interviews and commentary from such brilliant myth-folk like Michael Meade, Robert Walter, Honora Foah and others, the animated sequences -- voiced by Mark Hamill, Tim Curry, and Lance Henricksen -- are worth the price of the DVD alone. I highly recommend this film. Don't just watch it alone -- it makes for a great viewing party.",1302652800,9,667,4.859649122807017

4065374,3,B0033HKBQU,"Consistent with my thinking about the nature and function of myth. I especially enjoyed many of the images. However, it was much too long and wordy.  After a while the ideas began to break down for me and stopped giving substance to the power of myth.,",1478217600,2,252,4.478260869565218

4065383,1,B0033HKBQU,"Incredibly poorly produced and done.  I hope I did not spend much money on this product!  I cannot recommend it to anyone, even those like me who were just trying to get the perspective of some of those who consider themselves followers of Joseph Campbell.  All his materials are at least rational and fairly well done.  This material was a mess.",1466985600,,346,4.622950819672131

4065395,2,B0033HKBQU,"Unfortunately the overall subject of the interviews came off as strangely politial and preachy. I was hoping to hear people talk about the imagination, the develpment of storytelling, and how these things build connections between peoples. Bummer. I donated the DVD to a public library.",1463356800,,286,5.377777777777778

8387962,5,B0033HKBQU,"This video is more important today than ever. To be able to look at the face of the kind of uncertainty we have to deal with in so many areas of life (racial, financial, sexual, environmental, class, religious, political, universal, age and basic humanity) it is most urgent to see our lives in the largest context of all, spiritually.  We need the help of wisdom in all its forms and throughout all history to connect what is the greatest good to this time and space. To realize the wonder of love in action to both sides of the 1% and all in between is our highest goal and gives us the ability to go on day by day instead of giving up in fear. This video helps us to connect or reconnect to the primal self and explains in creative and plain language as well as story our true oneness with all creation. For those who don't want to live in fear, hate, denial and despair this is most necessary.",1482710400,,897,4.276470588235294
