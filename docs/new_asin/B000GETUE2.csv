2605969,5,B000GETUE2,"NICE ITEM, AS DESCRIBED, INTERESTING, A+++",1408320000,,42,6.166666666666667
2605970,5,B000GETUE2,"A fine gathering of a best of....some of the artists will not be famililiar to an American pop audience, but that's their problem, not yours. Some excellent moments that only make me long to see all of the complete shows.",1390176000,2,221,4.55
2605971,4,B000GETUE2,I have all three DVD's from when they were first released. Very enjoyable. I watched a fantastic performance on You Tube of Patti Smith doing Horses and Hey Joe on the OGWT. The only performance they have of Patti is Because the Night.,1390089600,3,235,4.488372093023256
2605972,4,B000GETUE2,"There were many acts to see,the presenters were knowledgeable and funny.
Some of the introductions could be a little shorter to fit more artists in.
Eclectic mixture of artists.
Overall good value and good fun.",1371340800,2,210,5.0285714285714285
2605973,5,B000GETUE2,"The look on my son's face was priceless. He stated one evening he had wanted it for years and didn't think
It was available.  Within 5 minutes I had it ordered for a birthday surprise.  Thanks Amazon.",1361491200,4,200,4.378378378378378
2605974,5,B000GETUE2,This DVD collection contains a great mix of rock and roll classics. I believe it is must have for any DVD collector.,1310688000,,116,4.318181818181818
2605975,2,B000GETUE2,"Many years ago I saw this BBC program on PBS. Only a few episodes of OGWT were broadcasts in my area. I bought this set on the anticipation from reviews from Guitar Player Magazine and rekindled my interest.

Though starts off great with vintage Alice Cooper, Elton John and Rory Gallagher, the disc quickly got bogged down in long lengthly interviews with the producers. Please beware that their is are apparently two versions? The set I purchased did not include BeBop Deluxe and Thin Lizzy as reviewed in GP? The rare footage of Bill Nelson's '70's band still eludes me. Also as disappointing was Thin Lizzy with a young Gary Moore?? The second disc start menu was corrupted and extras like artist interviews could not be selected, A real shame.

It is not all bad, great rare footage of Montrose and early Sammy Hagar, Johnny Winter, The Who and Supertramp. You just have to fast forward relentless boring producer interviews. Not being a big fan of punk, I quickly passed on those cuts. I have to say Roxy Music and U2 a great look back at New Wave.

Good idea, needed better editing to keep your interest. I would love to see box sets of the Don Kirshner's Rock Concert or the King Biscuit Flower Hour (radio). If someone could unearth the all the footage of 1974 Califorina Jam, I think there would be a lot of interest.",1225152000,18,1327,4.567226890756302
2605976,5,B000GETUE2,Love this set I remember seeing so much of it live and it's where I first saw Little Feat who I have been an ardent follower since. I hope the BBC plan to release more. We need to see Dr hook singing Sylvia's mother.,1206316800,,216,3.9318181818181817
2605977,2,B000GETUE2,"Despite being called The Complete Collection this set is 110 minutes shorter than the product of the same name sold by the BBC in the UK. Not only that but Volume One should be spread over 2 discs as in the UK but here 190 minutes are crammed on to 1 disc to save them a few pennies while delivering over-compressed video to the paying customer.

Read the reviews for Volume Three to discover some of the fine acts that aren't included here but should be.

Of course, I can't give it just 1 star because many of the performances are awesome and worthwhile.",1165536000,58,556,4.336538461538462
8131102,4,B000GETUE2,I loved seeing the performers so young. I found new people that I had never heard of that had fantastic music. Would have given 5 stars but I don't care for punk music and there was to much of that for me. The rest was FABULOUS!,1489190400,,228,3.9782608695652173
8131103,5,B000GETUE2,Classic series.  Remember when it was on TV,1469318400,,43,4.375
8131104,3,B000GETUE2,Nothing like a complete collection - get the UK version with almost 2 hours more footage.,1469232000,,89,4.625
8131105,5,B000GETUE2,Great show set,1464220800,,14,4.0
8131106,5,B000GETUE2,"A word of warning before we begin -- this is the Japanese edition of The Old Grey Whistle Test, Vol 3, which differs markedly in content from the UK and US versions of the same titled disc; AND also, more important, if you're in the United States, Canada, or Europe, you will need to play this DVD on either a computer or on an all-region DVD player (of which, fortunately, I am an owner), because it is NTSC (the US video system, which is used in Japan) but it is a REGION 2 disc.

That said, it's a really fine collection, and the fact that this is Volume 3 makes me want to get the first two in order to see how much more choice they might be. There's a ton of great clips here, by Lindisfarne (""Meet Me On The Corner""), Al Stewart (""Year of the Cat""), Robin Trower (""A Little Bit of Sympathy"" -- it 's like Jimi Hendrix reincarnated), Janis Ian (""At Seventeen""), Richard and Linda Thompson (""A Heart Needs A Home""), Brinsley Schwarz (""Surrender To the Rhythm"") etc. etc.-- and scattered in the middle of all of those rockers are a pair of worth-their-weight-in-gold performances by Freddie King and B.B. King. Some of the later material here, from the 80s, was lost on me (it's a generational thing), even the latter day King Crimson (I would watch anything the 1969-74 bands did, and Bill Bruford's work here on ""Frame By Frame"" is worth seeing, but that version of the band as a whole loses me), but even amid their ranks there are a some great moments (Lone Justice doing ""Sweet Sweet Baby""). The wrap arounds, by the likes of Nick Lowe, Rick Wakeman, and the various hosts, are also worth taking in. The resolution is excellent, and the menu and chaptering are easy to maneuver around.",1461974400,,1693,4.461290322580645
8131107,4,B000GETUE2,Gave this as a gift to a friend. I guess they are loving it!,1461024000,,60,3.357142857142857
8131108,5,B000GETUE2,Finally I got to view and enjoy the third volume in the set - I made the mistake of collecting individually - The first two volumes were very affordable - then come tins to bug the third - wee let's put it this way - it was way more affordable to buy the set of three volumes again - than it would have been to just buy the third - I regifted the ones I already owned.,1453161600,2,368,3.792207792207792
8131109,5,B000GETUE2,Great set!,1429315200,,10,4.5
8131110,5,B000GETUE2,"This DVD has some great rockers - Humble Pie's ""Black Coffee"" is a highlight, as well as Robin Trower's ""A Little Bit of Sympathy"" - as well as some rolling folksy numbers that put a smile on my face, one great example is the leadoff video of Lindisfarne's (never heard of them before) ""Meet Me on the Corner.""  Some surprisingly wonderful performances too, like Roger Daltrey's ""Giving It All Away"" and a kickass ""Boogie Funk"" by Freddie King.  These are just a few highlights - for me they were all great, not a bad one in the bunch.

You might have an issue with the Region 0 (""All Regions"") DVD.  It didn't play on my cheap-o US DVD player, but it was fine on my laptop, where I do most of my viewing with headphones anyway.",1418256000,,728,4.330882352941177
8131111,4,B000GETUE2,"Its a great collection, just not the one I truly wanted.  Was looking for 1975 BBC Lynyrd Skynyrd Old Grey Whistle Test. With ONLY Lynyrd Skynyrd.  Wasn't in stock or available...BUMMER.  Still looking for it.

BUT, This is TRULY a great collection!!!",1413244800,,251,4.904761904761905
