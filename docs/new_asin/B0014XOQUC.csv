3135931,4,B0014XOQUC,"In my utter Jillina fandom, I bought her latest 4 DVD set, and with a little bit of time before my rehearsal with Lilya, I popped in Shape Up or Hip Out.  Now, this is a  bellydance workout video, better than I have seen on the market before, aside from Aziza's Drilling DVD.  This one was really intended simply as a workout, not a drill or technique video.  and it is far better than Dolphina's ""Goddess Workout"" or the Bellytwins or - and perhaps especially better than Rania's.

There is a warmup on the DVD.  I could only criticize it in that it doesn't seem exactly safe for all people.  There are some deep knee bends that seem ill-advised, and I'm not sure if it's the best way to warm up.  Also, she uses yoga-inspired moves, but without the yoga-inspired cueing, people may miss the point of the stretch.  Overall, I would do my own warmup and move on.  Good thing it's a separate menu item.

Next is the Slow Moves.  I admit I skipped this one when it started with a very slow broken-down snake arm.  I don't ever want to do a slow broken-down snake arm again because every damn belly-fitness class or video has them and, well, I know how to do snake arms and there is nothing to be gained for me in breaking them down into their components.

The second workout was a bit more upbeat and the third workout, while no marathon, was the fastest.  I became mildly warm, although I did not sweat through the whole forty minutes.  The format was this: breakdown two movements slowly, then do it them fulltime.  Then repeat the entire sequence from the beginning, stringing all the pairs of movements together.  Jillina puts an emphasis on the muscles, talking about obliques, abs, and glutes.  She even modified her normal technique.  For example, camels include the chest - whereas on her other videos, she teaches them excluding the chest.  Later on in the video, she uses hip shimmies, with bent knees, rather than Egyptian knee-driven shimmies - and she adds an ATS-style arm pull to her hip lift walk.  Many more of her movements are flat-footed rather than releve.  All this is a sign that Jillina understood this was to be a workout video, not a technique video, and she took the most athletic ways of doing things from a variety of styles and combined it.

A beginner could easily follow this video, although some movements would be difficult for them, such as the haggalah.  The 'choreography' such that it is was simple, 8 counts of each move like any aerobics class.  This would teach the beginner a lot of movements, in a basic choreography that is more exciting than a drill.  Plus, remembering the steps in sequence is preparation for choreography.  For the intermediate dancer, the challenge would be adding the arm movements that accompany.  Finally, the advanced dancer could focus on her posture and smooth transitions.  All dancers could use this ""workout time"" to strengthen their muscles.",1205452800,53,2914,4.6568627450980395
3135932,5,B0014XOQUC,"I am a bellydance student who owns more than 60 bellydance DVD. I actually found that one very useful, more than anything else. It is a great workout to lose weight and practice all the basics moves of egyptian dance.

It consists of a warm up, 3 sections, cool down and some live performances by jillina and her bellydance students.
the 3 sections are:
Slow and smooth workout... as you expect, the moves are done slowly and they are suitable for a complete beginner.
Rythm workout... very nice moves, she takes you a little slow first and then it gets fast, they are fun egyptian BD moves.
Turbo workout... this is my favorite workout, the one that takes all my energy away, it is fast, fun and great to shape up and lose weight.
Keep in mind, that this section is NOT FOR BEGINNERS, unless you have a very flexible body, easy to learn and hard to give up.

Then it takes you to the section of the performance by her bellydance students, I didn't care much about it, but you may find it interesting, I only like Heather drum solo performance and each one of the students performs a different style of bellydance.

Anyway, that DVD is a good buy for the price, for the 3 good workouts and it is very useful for any egyptian bellydance student at least it will keep you in shape and will get you to dance right away :)",1277942400,,1318,4.349593495934959
3135933,4,B0014XOQUC,"Beatiful set, Jillina is a good dancer & 3 women behind her. Music is real & several songs, best I can describe is very Engima like. Good beat/drums, fast, with light sporadic singing/chanting. It's great, although the music is the type I use to meditate, so even with a fast beat it didn't always work for me. Audio choices are with or without instruction.

Intro: 90 seconds
Warm up: 7 min
Incorporates a lot of yoga standing fwd bends, chair & lunges & other basic stretches.
Slow & Smooth: 32 min
Here, Jillina goes slowly so you can really feel the muscle isolation the whole time & feel your muscles working, she also teaches here instead of assuming you know how to do them. Snake arms, chest & torso circles, hip bumps, chest lifts, undulations, hip lifts, hip circles (& also while walking), vertical figure 8s, lower abs only undulations. She then does the workout again, not quite a routine, but not as instructional as previous, but she doesn't speak at all here.
Rhythm Hips: 32 min
The same moves, but at a really fast paced & adds some twists, shoulder shimmies, step twists, a couple other traveling steps, basic/common arm poses/movements, horizontal figure 8s, hip lifts to the front & back, This is also done as a routine but with a lot of practice before the next move.
Turbo Hips 38 min
Here is the same thing again w/fast pace & she adds hip shimmies, hip shimmies with travel, double twist step & more.
Cool Down 15 min
Mostly seated/reclined basic stretching.
Live Performance 40 min
2 solos of Jillina, Heather Quinn, Louchia Tchoukri (wings of Isis), Ahava, Denise Arias (red & gold outfit w/sword balancing on head, chest, foot & hand at end)

3135934,5,B0014XOQUC,"I had never heard of Jillina but when I received this video her calm personality came across.  She is excellent.  She has very good dance skills and teaching skills.  I loved the music for each section.  My favortie section was ""Rhythm Hips"".  That music was fun an so stimulating! She is in great shape and knows what she is doing at all times.  Her confidence comes across and it seems to project onto you.  I truly hope she makes more videos like that one.  It is just the best.  Also, at first the workout doesn't seem like you are 'working out' but as the different stages progress you know that you are working your body.  When I finished, I knew that I had achieved something.  Also, I am never bored with the video as I exercise to it over and over.  To me that is the sign of a good product.

3135935,5,B0014XOQUC,"I really like Jillina. She gets a lot of crap in the bellydance world, but I think she is a no-nonsense dancer and a good teacher. This is a good workout geared towards beginners( she says that in the intro), but as an intermediate I enjoyed it too. Good for working on your posture and polishing simple moves.",1239580800,2,310,4.362068965517241

3135937,5,B0014XOQUC,"How I like to use this video:  after using a different video for warming up, I go directly to ""Rhythm Hips"" and turn off the instruction--I use the music only option.  Jillina is easy to follow, she is right on with the beat, and the music is fabulous.  The routine is easy to learn and is fun. I don't really like to exercise, but with this tape I am motivated to exercise every single day.  I am in my forties and not in the best physical condition, so it is a workout and yet it is gentle.  Not only is it exercise, but it works to help alleviate my stress level. If you enjoy bellydancing you will love this workout!",1233446400,9,620,4.133333333333334

3135940,4,B0014XOQUC,"This was a great video for working out using the basics of belly dance. If you're looking to learn how to belly dance at the same time as you get your exercise though, this video probably will disappoint you. To fully understand how to perform a specific exercise from this video, you do have to know at least the basics of belly dance before you start so that you can concentrate more on the exercise than what exactly it is you're trying to do. Great video, and lots of fun!",1218412800,6,476,4.3

8256540,3,B0014XOQUC,"I was very excited to practice belly dance moves as a workout routing, however it is not quite what I expected. The workout selection ""Slow and smooth"" comes close to what I was looking for, practicing some belly dance moves in repetition to tone the core, but the other two workouts on this DVD are just dance choreographies, which are being introduced rather quickly, so that I found them to be very hard to follow. I was somewhat disappointed, because I like her other Bellydance DVD's, in which she takes enough time to explain and introduce the moves. This was not what I was looking for, and I might practice it occasionally, if I feel like dancing, not so much if I want a fun and different workout for the midsection.",1423440000,,725,4.541984732824427

The first workout section on the DVD starts out with slow movements. Most of the movements in this section are done in place. The second workout is a moderate paced workout. Some of the movements from the first section are strung into combinations and there is more walking and moving around the room. The third workout is a fast paced workout. The workout consists of combinations that involve a lot of shimmies and more traveling steps. If someone does not have a lot of time to workout it is easy to pick one section of the DVD. I have so much fun with this DVD the first few months I used it I almost forgot I was working out.

8256546,5,B0014XOQUC,"There are a couple of reasons why I love this DVD.  For one thing, Jillina has found a way to break down the moves faster than any other instructor I've seen, so she keeps me moving while she breaks it down.  I'm already familiar with all the basic moves, so I didn't need a breakdown, but I still find it useful to drill the moves slowly.  So I really do follow along with Jillina, whereas with Dolphina I often drill the moves faster while she's breaking it down.  The other thing I love is that this workout is really challenging.  The first segment was easy, the second one harder and the third one was INSANE.  Not only did it wear me out, but it includes lots of challenging layering movements like a walking hip shimmy, which is something I haven't mastered yet.  Why haven't I mastered it?  Because I haven't practiced  it consistently.  None of the other instructors on my bellydance workouts have even asked me to do it, and I'm so excited to learn it!  I really love that Jillina is giving me this challenge.  I've asked myself if I would have found it too intimidating if I were an absolute beginner, and to tell the truth, I think I would.  The first time I did this workout I just shimmied in place and didn't even try to walk with it.  But I'm going to learn it and it will be fun.  I'm not going to get rid of my other bellydance workouts, but I'm glad I bought this one and I'm going to use it a lot.",1363564800,,1417,4.215613382899628
