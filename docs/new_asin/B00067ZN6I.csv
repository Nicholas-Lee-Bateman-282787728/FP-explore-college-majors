(7.4) Our Relations (1936) - Stan Laurel/Oliver Hardy/Alan Hale/Sidney Toler/James Finlayson (uncredited: Virginia Grey/Bobby Dunn/Tiny Sandford)",1392940800,2,728,5.213675213675214
8039982,4,B00067ZN6I,"Though not one of the big three (Sons of the Desert, The Devil's Brother or Way Out West), Our Relations would have to rank in the top 5 of the roughly 2 dozen feature length films which Laurel and Hardy made.  Although very few of these films were able to capture the Laurel and Hardy persona and cast it inside of a normal framework, this one almost succeeds despite the fact that its premise is a little forced; Stan and Ollie's long lost identical twin brothers have arrived in town. It's Shakespeare's ""Comedy of Errors"" by way of the W.W. Jacobs short story ""The Money Box"".

Our Relations avoids most of the pitfalls that diminish some of their other feature length work.  It is not slow and tedious (like Pardon Us or Pack Up Your Troubles).  It is not disjointed two-reelers being placed together to make a single (feature length) film (Blockheads, Bonnie Scotland) Finally, it is not comedy being used merely to bridge the gap between the romantic and musical interludes (Swiss Miss or any of the Later Fox Films).  It is a fast paced film.  And although it is material that has been tried before (Laurel and Hardy playing both themselves and their children (Brats) or themselves and their wives (Twice Two)), it is a very rich film and not just another expanded two reel comedy.  It is also pure Laurel and Hardy,with the comic duo (Either as Stan and Ollie or their seafaring twins, Bert and Alf) in almost every scene.

What is interesting about Our Relations are the people who worked on both sides of the camera - who never worked with Laurel and Hardy before and who would never work with them again - and how each made this film work.
Harry Lachman (Who seemed to be directing everything at Fox except comedies) succeeds in creating a movie featuring Laurel and Hardy instead of a Laurel and Hardy movie. Sidney Toler (a year away from beginning a 12 year stint as Charlie Chan) and Alan Hale (Who was in the process of becoming one of Warner Brothers leading character actors) make impressions in their roles as the Captain of the Periwinkle and as Al Grogan, the Proprietor of Denker's Beer Garden. Noel Madison is completely convincing as a Gangster who takes Stan and Ollie ""For a Ride"" towards the end of the film.

The Only ""Old Salt"" working in this film is Jimmy Finlayson who plays the larcenous ""Finn"". Cantankerous as always, in attempting to dupe Bert and Alf out of their pay, he sets into motion the events that will finally re-unite both sets of brothers. Look for one of the last good ""reciprocal destruction"" sequences between Finn and the Boys. The diminutive Daphne Pollard (Hardy's best on-screen wife next to Mae Busch) and Arthur Housman (as usual playing the drunk) were both appearing in a Laurel and Hardy feature for the third time in their respective careers.

Our Relations is a fast paced film with no slow spots during its 74 minute running time. It more than proved that Laurel and Hardy could carry a full length feature. This film and their follow-up, Way Out West (1937), represent the last of their truly great screen work!",1284249600,5,3075,4.6464088397790055

SYNOPSIS for ""Our Relations""
It's twice the fun, with Ollie and Stan playing their own twin brothers, Bert and Alf, sailors on shore leave who carry with them a precious pearl ring that a gang of thugs are after. Contains the classic sight gag of Stanley and Oliver immobilized with their feet in hardened concrete. They roll around most hilariously and try to avoid ending up in the harbor. This is the original seven-reeler from Hal Roach studio and not the edited-down 53 minute film that was retitled ""Double Trouble.""

BONUS: ""Southern Exposure""
Written, directed by and starring Charley Chase, this two-reeler features Bob Burns, the Arkansas-born inventor of the 'Bazooka,' a comic musical instrument that worked like a trombone but sounded like musical razzing. Also seen in cameo is Our Gang's 'Alfalfa.' Here, a couple visits the husband's Kentucky relations expecting to meet Southern royalty. Jimmie's folks turn out to be something quite different. (Charley has a dual role as Pappy Chase and Col. Charley Chase.)

8039985,5,B00067ZN6I,"Rarely seen these days, ""Our Relations"" finally gets more exposure with its DVD release. Helmed by Stan Laurel's production company, it's a surprisingly handsome production for a comedy. The lavishly detailed sets (particularly the nightclub sequence) show every single dollar on film.
But enough about production values. The real stars are, of course, Stan & Ollie as they deftly play two sets of identical twins; one set as civilians, the other set as sailors thought to have been hanged at sea for participating in a mutiny. As the sailor twins set foot on dry land and slowly intersect with the comic shenanigans of their other twins, the fun begins as characters confuse one set for the other. This plot device has been used countless times, from the silent era all the way up to Bette Midler & Lily Tomlin in ""Big Business"". But in Laurel & Hardy's hands, they milk it for all it's worth.
The film is climaxed by a brilliantly conceived sight gag: Through mistaken identity (and the possession of a valuable ring), one set of twins is captured by gangsters who encase the boys' feet in cement trays with rounded bottoms. The result: The boys teeter & totter this way & that, never falling over, but providing many hilarious visuals until they finally tumble off the pier. Laurel invented this gag after finding a restaurant ashtray in a similar shape which never toppled but rocked to & fro.
""Our Relations"" is a rare L&H comedy that no fan of the great duo should be without.",1209427200,14,1482,4.748062015503876
