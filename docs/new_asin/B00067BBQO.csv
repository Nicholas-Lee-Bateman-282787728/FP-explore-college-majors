2171349,5,B00067BBQO,"What an artist! If you have any doubt of the multi talents of this artist you are musically challenged! What magic, pain and feeling she brings to the stage. Hate her or love her she is a REAL artist! If you have not checked out I'm not dead... WHAT R U WAITING FOR? P!nk is one of the few artists today that manages to impress, surprise and get better with every album!",1148860800,3,370,4.152777777777778
2171350,3,B00067BBQO,"I must admit that I wasn't too impressed when i first saw this live dvd of Pink's but i was a bit drunk so....

later on i watched it again... sober and i see that it has its brilliant moments. She does give her current best but for some reason i was expecting something more. what exactly?? i don't know but i was hoping for something bigger i guess and more cohesive as i felt her little interludes such as G'NR's welcome to the jungle and twisted sister's i wanna rock discredited the order of the songs. I mean why not sing Trouble all the way instead of doing it as some acapella interlude and just leave it at that??? And the same goes for Feel good time with the exception that it wasn't an acapella interlude.

But u know what, despite its few flaws this is highly recommended especially for the hardcore Pink fans!

Some of the brilliant moments are when she gets a little triple XXX with the oh my god track originally recorded with Peaches. That I would assume you would find on the uncensored version of the concert.

So like i said before, this is Pink live and it's promising!

Oh and what exactly did she say when she was messing with that christina aguilera-like rubber doll on stage?? I mean it was censored even on the uncensored version of the concert! hmmmmmm....",1148428800,3,1283,4.39662447257384
2171351,5,B00067BBQO,"Rocker P!nk comes to Europe with her excellent 'Try This Tour' for 2004 and is definetly nearer to the next Madonna than a Christina Aguilera or Britney Spears!...
Hitting the radios with stompers like 'Trouble', 'God is a DJ', 'Feel Good Time' and angry 'Last to know' she is definetly at her best. This DVD includes all of these songs and loads loads more, P!nk has over 4 outfits which are very raunchy and cool!(Goes with show). Entering the stage in a bird cage, pole dancing strippers, lap dancing for a fan and simulated sex with 'Lady Marmalade' blow up dolls.......CRRRAAAAAAZZZYY! But we LOVE it!!!!!!!! Carry on Pink.

2171379,4,B00067BBQO,"This was a great concert, like all of Pink's are. This concert was before she really got into the acrobatics like she does now, though there is some. I will definitely say that this concert is not appropriate for all ages (Mature only). There is quite a bit of almost full nudity as well as some blow up dolls. I still loved the concert though because Pink always has fun and keeps things very entertaining. Plus her music is great and this has a large variety in it.",1419984000,,467,4.318181818181818
2171380,5,B00067BBQO,The video is shot here and there but Pink is pink.  it's cool waching her be her self and growing as a singer.,1414022400,,110,3.782608695652174

2171382,3,B00067BBQO,I like Pink but sometimes she has too much explicit material for me.  That is just my opinion.,1411344000,,94,4.222222222222222
2171383,1,B00067BBQO,"I'm a HUGE FAN of P!Nk but not of this concert.
She's young and it seems she's being told what to do. And the wigs are creepy.",1409616000,,126,3.7037037037037037

2171387,3,B00067BBQO,"First of all, I am a big fan of Pink, and, as concert DVDs go this one is as good as most.

However...as I noted I bought this for the wrong reasons, mainly the Janis Joplin covers; Summertime, Me and Bobby McGee and Piece of my Heart. Even though they're listed as songs she only sings them acoustically as a brief interlude in the middle of the set. Her voice could really do them justice, but you'll never know from this disc because she never completes any of the three, which is a shame.",1397260800,6,492,4.23404255319149
2171388,4,B00067BBQO,"I love P!nk and she has come a long way!  This is one of her earlier concerts and it is explicit for a reason, I had to shut it off after just one or two songs because my daughter was in the room.

She's great but I wish I would have saved my money on this one.  She has really grown as an artist and she keeps getting better as she grows.",1392681600,,339,3.6805555555555554
2171389,1,B00067BBQO,"songs are great. pink is awesome. Not sure why the editors of these shows have to pan around the room every 2 seconds. After 2 minutes I was done! We are there to see the artist. Focus guys....I want to get the feel of the stage and the atmosphere of the entire concert. Do these film guys have that much of an attention problem. I mean there could be a great solo, singing, guitar etc...and there is the camera focusing on a member of the audience or something else but the solo and what is actually going on. It is so annoying! The artists really need to get involved before this stuff is released. Her new DVD Live in Melbourne got the same reviews, so therefore I am not buying it which is a shame. I was looking forward to it.",1389052800,,731,4.191489361702128
2171390,3,B00067BBQO,"As stated above. It's good, not as good as her more recent stuff. Although all her shows are sexual in nature and I have let my older teenager watch them, this one I was much less comfortable with letting her watch it.",1387324800,,218,4.214285714285714
2171391,5,B00067BBQO,She is so talented probably with out a doubt the most talented star of the past 2 decades for sure! I have seen her in concert 3 times this year and its so worth the money!,1386720000,,172,3.8055555555555554
2171412,5,B00067BBQO,"I enjoy all of Pink's performances...she has high energy, great songs and wonderful choreography!  This is an earlier concert, it her beginning days so it's fun to see how much she has evolved!",1382400000,,193,4.848484848484849
2171413,4,B00067BBQO,"fun to watch a very hot chick exceed her expectations from her original press. she is more professional than her peers who were expected to achieve more, with much less drama. thank you PINK!",1379462400,,191,4.647058823529412

2171420,5,B00067BBQO,"I saw her performance on TV and found her to be very energetic, entertaining and someone with a great voice. I bought this video CD, Pink - Live in Europe (Explicit) see her show more than just once. Over all, I made a good purchase and will probably buy another one of her video CD's.",1302393600,,285,4.2
2171421,5,B00067BBQO,This DVD was awesome. I had never seen Pink until one night she was featured on LOGO channnel and I was very impressed. This DVD was in great shape and came to me very quickly.,1302134400,,176,4.057142857142857
2171432,5,B00067BBQO,"This lady is an erotic exotic super talented performer. Tease me please me then tell me the truth. I am a new P!NK fan, my younger brother let me check out one of her cds, I enjoyed the music and checked out her videos. I bought this DVD and enjoyed it from beginning to end including the special feature (that's where then tell me the truth comes in)I highly recommend this DVD for the non faint of heart.",1285804800,,406,4.217948717948718
2171433,5,B00067BBQO,This video is awesome! She gets a little wild in it which is interesting because I purchased it for my 2 year old daughter but totally worth owning!,1280188800,,148,4.321428571428571
2171434,2,B00067BBQO,"Apparently the director mistook shooting and editing a concert for shooting and editing a music video, and thus we are treated to endless jump cuts and focus changes, completely losing the concert experience. Beyond annoying. I ripped the audio from the DVD and spent much of an hour editing down to 22 songs.",1268524800,3,309,4.849056603773585
2171435,5,B00067BBQO,this is a must see what a amazing performance.  worth watching even if not a big pink fan (but I am).  and you will be after watching this.  love love love,1268524800,,155,3.935483870967742
2171436,5,B00067BBQO,wow this video is all P!nk shows you how hard she works for us to get an awesome concert and how much fun she has up on stage with her crew and fans just great.,1267660800,,160,3.6
2171437,5,B00067BBQO,She puts on a heck of a show. I am glad they've started putting out dvds of all the musical tours. I look forward to buying the newest one.,1259452800,,139,3.8275862068965516
2171438,5,B00067BBQO,"P!nk is just a fantastic performer and even if your not into P!nk, its just a great DVD to watch. Would recomend it to anyone.",1245974400,,126,4.08
2171439,5,B00067BBQO,"If your a Pink fan, you MUST add this to your collection!  I love the special features that are on this dvd.  You go on tour with her, pretty cool to see her some what out of her ""element"".  The concert was amazing also, as she's such a great performer anyways!",1199664000,,261,4.078431372549019
2171440,5,B00067BBQO,"Explicit? Yes. For children under the age of 16? Probably not. This is one of the best concert dvds that I have purchased not only because of the quality of the music tracks, but the great video quality as well. I especially enjoyed the get up and dance drum beats, quality voice work and overall fun factor in watching this concert. It looked like Pink was having fun and the energy she shows on stage is really contagious to the audience.

Unlike some dvd concerts I have bought, this one has a good mix of close-ups, full stage shots and wide arena pans. Yes the editing can be fast for some upbeat tracks but it's not enough of a distraction. MTV A.D.D. people like me will appreciate the vivid post editing work, but is not to ""artsy"" with other imagery thrown in. It's all about Pink and the very electric 90 minutes or so. Just remember to have an open mind when viewing some of the very risque clips.",1178323200,9,908,4.372781065088757
2171441,4,B00067BBQO,"P!nk is a great performer and really separates herself in my mind, from all the other female artist in her age group with this DVD. Great artistry, stage presence and of course singing. My only complaint is the quick cut nature of most of the editing. Frankly some of it looks like it was edited by a Reeses monkey on ten cups of coffee. Also, be aware of the sexual nature of much of the visual content as well as some explicit language. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. Just mentioning it FYI. P!nk, her back-up dancers, and the two female members of her band, are beautiful and sexy. That's the main reason I found the sometimes hyper editing to be bothersome.

If you've liked any of P!inks music or just appreciate fantastic live singing and commanding stage presence you'll love this show. During the last encore she performs some aerial acrobatics that left me slack-jawed. I had no idea she was that athletic, and it's little wonder that she saved it for the end of the show (just in case), and when she sits down with just her guitarist for a medley of Janis Joplin tunes you know you're witnessing something special.",1172188800,5,1134,4.5588235294117645
2171452,1,B00067BBQO,"not worth the free shipping I spent on this, it seems like a mean unfun,not happy sort of concert and dvd singing is bad,lyrics bad, dancing poor  If you want good Female/dance sort of dvd with some joy in it buy the new Gwen Stefane dvd",1166313600,,237,4.1521739130434785
2171453,4,B00067BBQO,"I purchased this concert DVD as a gift for my daughter,who is s HUGE Pink fan. She would probably give it 5 stars, but I found the video and sound quality mediocre. The performance was great, classic Pink, energetic and  in-your-face,which is why three generations of women in my family love her.",1162684800,18,296,4.6923076923076925
2171454,5,B00067BBQO,"It was unfortunate to learn that Pink's third tour was not making it to my city but I love the fact that I can now feel as though I was there with this DVD. Not only did she perform her new tracks from the third CD but she did plenty of songs from her previous albums as well as some awesome covers that I've never heard before. Also, the performances, choreography and set was the most creative I've seen from her!",1156032000,12,415,4.135802469135802
2171455,4,B00067BBQO,"Let me start by saying that I love P!nk. This dvd was a wonderful performance, just a little too much sexual stuff. Come on Pink! You're better than those other pop sell-outs. (I won't mention any names because we all know who I am talking about) The swearing really didn't affect me at all. Keep in mind that this isn't good for little kids who like Pink, but maybe teenagers. (If you're loose on that kind of stuff.)",1155513600,4,418,4.371794871794871
2171456,2,B00067BBQO,"I have been a huge P!nk fan for years, and I have never seen her like this.  During the performance of ""God is a DJ"", ""Oh My God"", and ""Trouble"" P!nk and her back-up dancers are heavily pole-dancing, and the back-up dancers are wearing nothing but thongs and small patches over their nipples. I ended-up throwing my copy away, because the sexual content is just WAY too strong. But, if you don't mind all of the filth, her performances are very good, she has a gorgeous voice, and her performing is awesome. It was simply too much for me to handle.",1154908800,8,548,4.425742574257426
2171457,3,B00067BBQO,"This is a bawdy, fun but oddly directed live concert featuring the always enjoyable and creative Pink. The spontaneous and quirky Pink and her amazing voice are overshadowed by bad editing, sloppy sound and a stunning example of censorship in an unrated dvd! There are numerous examples of Pink's showmanship and command of her audience and some incredible vocals, the Janis Joplin tribute is worth the price but should have been longer. The only song that is tough to get through is the goofy version of Lady Marmalade which for some reason involves choppy singing sections and cabaret with blow up dolls. This spectacle takes away from Pink's singing and becomes an unintended parody. If you can get through the bad editing and sound this is an entertaining ride through a tour in the life of one of pop/rock's great singers.",1153699200,3,827,4.872340425531915
2171458,5,B00067BBQO,"This is an excelent concert-DVD. Pink is quite a performer and you get a long burst of songs, including a very nice rendition to Janis Joplin.. SUPER.  I think Pink is one of the best, if not the best, young female performer of our time. I highly recomend it, you will not be disapointed.",1153094400,9,288,4.333333333333333
2171459,4,B00067BBQO,"Firstly lets say how great Pink is throughout this show- her voice is great and the song selection was awesome and i really enjoyed the DVD!! I did feel however that her costumes were aweful and looked like they had been put together last minute. I mean the first outfit made her look like a parrot, her black gothic album made her look like a prostitute and her last outfit what was that!!!! Some songs were only song part off such as feel good time which annoyed me because it was a hit song that was just an intro into another song!!

Overall, Pink we know you are a rock chick but take some time to think about how you present yourself and how to give the crowd a good time but on the other hand it was an awesome show!!",1150761600,2,724,4.134751773049645
2171460,5,B00067BBQO,"I was amazed in every way with this dvd concert.  I really enjoyed watching the entire concert.  I loved the format too, going from the beginning og her music to her most recent, it shows just how much her music has grown.  I fav part is when she sings ""God Is a DJ"" with the poles and ""Trouble"" as a nice ballad.  I think this would take the doubt out of anyone who thinks Pink isn't a real performer, cuz she rocked that concert so well!!!",1150329600,4,441,4.093023255813954
2171461,4,B00067BBQO,"Don't really understand why the explicit label. I guess it is the language and the nipple piercing she has done while her mother is watching. OUCH! The concert is very good and the music is great plus all the extras. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the camera work. It seems that it is very jumpy. I mean it never stays focused on her. Other than that

it is very good..",1149724800,4,381,4.08

8039651,1,B00067BBQO,"Do NOT buy this for its value as a Pink concert--it has none! It's a herky-jerky mishmash of artsy fartsy editing.
I should have read the reviews so it's my own fault for buying it, but still, why would they chop a performance up so badly? I wanted to see Pink and her crew, not views of the audience's armpits, cellphones, hair, et al.  I don't know what they call the person that put the DVD video together; what I call them is not printable.  The video jumps around so badly that it made me nauseous. Evidently they feel their work has more creative value than the artist's. The director, editor, whoever/whatever, needs to put their ego where it belongs and record the concert as an attendee sees it!  I love Pink but this DVD sucks. Buy the Funhouse Tour if you want to see her at her best.",1476921600,2,795,4.322147651006712
