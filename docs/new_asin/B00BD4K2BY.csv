8566564,5,B00BD4K2BY,"For Kim fans, I would recommend this DVD. It's about 60 minutes, with three separate interviews, and some footage and general information. Among the three interviews, one is Kim speaking to a British guy on TV, which is absolutely hilarious. One is Kourtney and Kim on a radio show. And the last is her talking to a friend back in the early days of her fame. She covers a wide range of topics, issues like boyfriends, her preferences, the failed marriage with Humphries. I follow Kim a bit, and I learned a couple new things about her. The casual fan would probably learn more.
Highly recommended for the Kim fan!",1405641600,10,613,4.581818181818182
