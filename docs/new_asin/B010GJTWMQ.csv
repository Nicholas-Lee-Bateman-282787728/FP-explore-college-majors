8722418,5,B010GJTWMQ,"I found this version of  The Tales of Hoffman to be excellent in purely musical terms;  thus the five stars.  However, my initial reaction to this recording was  negative, primarily because of the staging, about which I am still ambivalent.  It certainly is not for those who are offended by nudity or for those who prefer a traditional set  Nevertheless, repeated viewings have helped me get past my initial objections because of the quality of the music-making itself.  Of the singers, only Brueggergosman  seemed to stand out on first hearing, but the rest of the cast  grew on me with each listening, especially Cutler, von Otter, and Priante.  The conducting by Sylvain Cammbreling is just right for Offenbach, at least to my taste.  For me, the Antonia scene combines great beauty with an intensity that makes for a great listening experience, and it by itself  is worth the price of the disc. This  should not be one's first or only version of this opera, but I can recommend it with enthusiasm for those who love Offenbach's greatest  work and want to explore a new version.",1510790400,,1082,4.778378378378378

8722421,3,B010GJTWMQ,"A very surreal, avant-garde interpretation of the work, and while it is ambitious and interesting, I prefer the opera in a more traditional production. Props to Marthaler and Viebrock on an edgy interpretation with echos of the 1920s. Eric Cutler is perfect as the anti-hero Hoffmann and Anne Sofie Von Otter is sublime!",1448841600,5,320,5.056603773584905
