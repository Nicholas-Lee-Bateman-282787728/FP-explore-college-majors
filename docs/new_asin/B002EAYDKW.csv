Probably just as well as within 200m of leaving Jiri we would have missed the first turn along with a couple of others throughout the Trek had we just used the book on our own.  Book proved excellent info tho for following and plotting our route as we went.  Often referring to it during lunch stops and dinner to see what was in store for us.
Definitely recommend if you are planning on dong the Jiri - Base Camp - Lukla Trek - but probably better to use a guide as well unless you have done this before.",1474329600,,640,4.221311475409836
8367222,3,B002EAYDKW,"I have mixed feelings about this disc. On one hand it is wonderful to get some glimpses of the places I have only seen in photographs. On the other hand it is just that, glimpses. It could have easily been twice as long. Cuts are abrupt, sometimes in mid sentence or mid shot. The volume level is all over the place.

This is what it is, an amateur video. It's a bit over priced, I think 15 would be a fair price for it. That said I'm glad to have it in my Everest collection, but I feel that it isn't quite worth what I paid for it.

3 stars. It's not very good, but it's not too bad either.",1250812800,,592,3.925
