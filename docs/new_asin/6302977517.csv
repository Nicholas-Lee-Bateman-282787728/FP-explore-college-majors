I have had my VHS original copy since the late 90s!!!! Definitely my favorite movie of all!!!!! Is low budget, sexy, dirty, funny, cheap, colorful, with a wicked soundtrack!!!!! A must see for any Almodovar, Tarantino, John Waters fan!!!",1444003200,,363,4.777777777777778

7833262,4,6302977517,"So I saw this movie a long time ago on USA's Up All Night with Rhonda Sheer. I don't know why I liked it then or why I still like it now, but it is cheesy and crazy, in a good way, or maybe it was Rhonda Sheer that made me like it. Anyway, it brought me back. The love story in it is cute and I love Mel Carter's song, Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me! Everything else is ""out there"". It is a decent watch, but don't buy unless you are into cheesy, cultish, 80's films, like me. =)",1344988800,,476,3.722772277227723
7833263,5,6302977517,If you enjoy Almadovar and John Waters then you will love the antics of this wacky film. The line up of characters that starred in this movie are to say the least HYSTERICAL and leave you wanting more.  Keep an eye on that Andrea Naschak!,1261180800,3,238,4.288888888888889
7833264,5,6302977517,Great movie.  Seriously funny.  I wish I could find the soundtrack as the music is hilarious and well incorporated into the film.  REALLY wish this would be released on DVD.,1199664000,4,173,4.7
