7982552,5,B00008G6PI,"This is part of a six composer set.  The others are on Strauss, Liszt, Rossini, Bach and Bizet.  They are very good videos for elementary school students.  Kids have lots of questions while watching.  The movies are engaging for K-5 alike, strongest in the grades 2-5 range, though Kindergartners can watch for about twenty minutes per viewing without getting too wiggly.  I read somebody write that they teach a college music appreciation course and that this is ""a miss"".  Probably is for college students, unless the college student is between five and ten years old.  At any rate, the quality of the production on these videos is top notch and the stories, though fictional, are well researched with much truth surrounding the fiction.

In this particular show, G.F. Handel has arrived in Dublin, Ireland troubled by critics about his music.  He is preparing to premiere his work, ""The Messiah"".  Along side Handel's story is the story of a boy, Jamey, who finds trouble in stealing things to survive poverty.  The lives of the two intertwine a bit.

All six of these composer's series videos follow a similar pattern in that a child comes in contact with a famous composer.  That's why these films work with children.  They have a connection.  I wouldn't waste time showing this to a college class as those students are a bit older in general (ya think!).  However, for elementary age students, these movies have tremendous potential for teaching both about music history and social studies.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Composers-Specials-6-DVD-Collector-s-Set/dp/B000FA5ETW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Composers' Specials 6 DVD Collector's Set</a>",1212278400,2,1701,5.5096525096525095
