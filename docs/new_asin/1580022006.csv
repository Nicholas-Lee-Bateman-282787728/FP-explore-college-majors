7799328,4,1580022006,"Produced and hosted by Bob and Penny Lord, at times this documentary has a preachy and staged feel.  But, the content is a potent reminder of what the Church has always taught concerning the real presence of Christ in the eucharist.  If you are a Catholic looking for encouragement to your faith or a non-Catholic seeking evidence for the faith, this is a great video for you.  Obviously, there will always be those who question miracles - I am an extreme skeptic myself - but the true skeptic must be open to the possibilities.  A true skeptic does not doubt simply for the exercise of doubting but examines and weighs the evidence.  In the closing frames a personal heartfelt message from Penny Lord dispels all the staged and preachy feel you might have felt in the beginning.  Do not dismiss this video or its content as simplistic and do not let your search for truth end here but continue to investigate these incredible events.",1321920000,4,934,4.664634146341464
7799329,4,1580022006,"Well told stories of some of the key Eucharistic miracles throughout the Church's history.  The footage for this video was shot back in the late '80s so the editing isn't the greatest but what greatly overshadows that is this is a sorely needed message to all Catholics today.  I remember seeing one other video of this kind but I can tell you after some rigorous shopping on the Internet, this is one of the very few videos on the Eucharistic Miracles that actually exist.",1250380800,14,473,4.619047619047619
7799330,5,1580022006,This CD by Bob and Penny Lord is an excellent synopsis and visual aid in being able to see first-hand the miracles of the Eucharist in several distant locations.  It is astounding to witness the continuing miracles that still go on today in movie format.  I orginally had the book and this reinforces the awesome power of God and the presence of Jesus in the Body and Blood of Christ each time we receive Him in the Eucharist.  Very good video.,1240531200,,444,4.45679012345679
