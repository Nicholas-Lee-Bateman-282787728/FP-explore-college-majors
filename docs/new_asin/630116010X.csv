7809821,4,630116010X,Have used VHS tapes of this and others in this dated but good Esquire series and like them.  The instructor is excellent.,1383350400,,121,4.5
7809822,5,630116010X,"Super? Advanced? Well...This reminds me of ballet warm ups or warm ups by Karen Voight. It takes virtually no space as your feet never move across the floor. seriously, there is no footwork whatsoever--your feet stay in a wide second position with toes pointed out for almost the entire workout. Instead, you do plies with big arm circles done to a pulsing beat. A few leg lifts and knee-repeaters and back-step lunges are the only time you take a foot off the floor. This workout might seem like a joke to some, but just what others with two left feet are looking for. If you have knee problems you may not like all the plies and lunging from side to side, but if you would rather get your heart rate up through big arm movements, this is for you. The aerobics is 22 minutes, with a slower standing cool down, such as a runner's stretch. Total 29 minutes.",1280188800,4,856,4.424050632911392

7809824,5,630116010X,I enjoyed this workout. I think it is good to do it on day when I am short on time. It is a 30 minute program with aerobics and toning. They go through easy aerobic steps that are easy to follow and then they go on the floor for toning. The instructer is pretty easy to follow and cues well. This tape is very good for beginners they will enjoy it. For intermediate and advance levels it is a very good change of pace.,1153180800,6,418,3.988095238095238
