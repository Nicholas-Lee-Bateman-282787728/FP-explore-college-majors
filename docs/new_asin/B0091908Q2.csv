8533904,4,B0091908Q2,"Made in 2011 this tells of Putin's arrival to global impact in 2000 and then 9/11 occurs. There is some efforts for the United States and Russia to work together against the terrorists. Incudes some meetings between the two countries but things eventually go sideways when client states of Russia aspire for Democracy one leader gets poisoned and then Russia attacks Georgia. What a mess! Interviews, insightfully explains the situation to Westerners who may not understand the situations.

Obama/HR Clinton aspire to create a reset in relations. Ultimately Putin muscles his way back into power. Occasionally wonkish.",1507939200,,618,5.371134020618556

8533906,4,B0091908Q2,"Putin has been playing chess with Russia's foreign policy while Obama has been using checkers game theory. Just look at the global situation currently. Putin was KGB, Obama was ACLU, guess who's philosophy works best in today's climate?",1463702400,,236,5.2368421052631575
8533907,4,B0091908Q2,"The Russian Federation is one of the few states in the world that has an independent foreign policy.  Too bad that the National Geographic Society could not have given a better picture of Putin.  The main reason the US elites don't like him is that he is a nationalist and not easily fooled.  That is apparent in the account as you see Medvedev and Putin reacting in similar situations.  But it really got to me that the so-called chicken embargo was not given a full picture in that the chickens were embargoed because of possible health issues.  That was only one of the examples of having Putin painted as an obstructionist rather then just looking out for what he was supposed to -- the Russians.  And how would you feel if the Warsaw Pact had surrounded the US?  This is exactly how the Russians feel about having NATO surround them.  They tried to join but NATO has other agendas, none of which is mentioned in this film.  Nor is the Russian reaction to all of this NATO action tied to all of the times they have been invaded and lost so many people.  Most People don't know that Russia was decimated in World War II by the European part of Russia in ruins and as many as 27 million Russian lives lost in the war.  Small wonder they are concerned about NATO on their borders.  It would have been much better to have a more balanced view, but I am beginning to despair of getting any of this on US news or television.  Which is a shame!  There is really no reason for us to be fighting the Russians in the future at all.",1379980800,14,1525,4.323943661971831

8533909,5,B0091908Q2,This film documents the rise to power and strong leadership of Putin in his first term in office and also gives insight into his present role as he continues to guide Russia. The film footage is remarkable as it incompasses the history of his presidency and the battles fought by Russia against some of the breakaway republics.,1356480000,6,327,4.754385964912281
