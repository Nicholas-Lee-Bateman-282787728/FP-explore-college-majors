8181157,5,B000NQRR2A,"After defeating Berserker and taking Ilya into their home, Shirou, Rin, and Saber are planning out their strategy. They decide to launch an attack against the servant, Caster. She apparently controls another servant and her master as well. Their attack fails, and Sakura is taken. Caster plans to summon the Grail using her spiritual powers. The trio goes to rescue her but faces nearly impossible odds. Caster's master is as proficient a fighter as most servants. Defeating them won't be easy.

This another great volume. The animation, voice acting and soundtrack are as good as ever. The story is getting more dramatic and intense. The final servant has yet to be seen, and winning the grail war will require defeating everyone. If you have seen the series up to this point, then you'll like what happens in this edition. If you haven't seen it, then you really need to check this out. I don't know about the box sets, but these individual volumes come English dubbed. I like that. Especially since the voice talents are actually talented.",1354924800,,1042,4.887005649717514

8181159,5,B000NQRR2A,"I absolutely LOVE this series. It incorporates the legends of past heroes in a fast-paced, and intricate plot (with a bit of a new twist). For those who love action with a bit of romance... this is the anime for you!
