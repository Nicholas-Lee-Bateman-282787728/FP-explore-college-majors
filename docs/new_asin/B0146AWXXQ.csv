7385167,5,B0146AWXXQ,It so happened that when I opened up the package and played the disc for the first time I was feeling a little out of sorts as the result of a disturbing dream. Peace and relaxation was just what I needed. It's nice to think that now I can have the experience of being by the water or among the trees whenever I want. I'd particularly recommend it when you're in the sort of mood where you don't want the demands of active interaction but just an unobtrusive but soothing background. Remember that you can adjust the volume to suit the occasion.,1450137600,11,545,4.352941176470588

8729926,2,B0146AWXXQ,Does not loop and I prefer nature scenery that moves visibly - also lots of the vignettes have people walking through the scenes :(,1505433600,3,131,4.5

8729928,3,B0146AWXXQ,"Meh, not my fav, but I can do my Pilates to it. The scene transitions bothered me-- not 100% smooth.  Music stopped at one point, as the scene changed and I get distracted when something like that happens-- similar to a minister who gets a LOUD case of hiccups during a sermon!
Not his/her fault, necessarily... just distracting.
Not bad, either-- just distracting!",1487635200,2,365,4.7936507936507935

8729932,5,B0146AWXXQ,"Purchased as a gift for my aunty in her 70s. She thoroughly loves it. Very calming after a stressful day, she loves coming home, switching it on and relaxing with a cup of tea. Immediately takes her out of her busy day and into a calm, quiet place.",1463270400,5,248,4.1875
8729933,5,B0146AWXXQ,"OMG! What an amazing experience. Rarely do you get the opportunity to experience such peaceful surroundings from your living room. Beautifully shot and with such subtly, it is a wonderful experience. My 20 month old watched it and immediately calmed her tantrum and slept so well that night (Thank you).
