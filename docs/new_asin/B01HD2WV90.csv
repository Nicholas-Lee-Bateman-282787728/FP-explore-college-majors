8764985,4,B01HD2WV90,"Meera (Tannishtha Chatterjee) is a successful divorced Indian mom living in Sydney, Australia with her more Indian parents and daughter. During an Indian Holi celebration she bumps into Will (Brett Lee) who teaches Aussie dialect and slang to foreign students...most likely a non-credited course. Will stays the course and eventually this evolves into a romantic comedy...you know the one where the guy comes running back and confesses his never dying love...sorry for the plot spoiler if you never saw a romance film before.

The production, like the film, was a mix of Bollywood and western. There are some cultural differences, but not a bad as it could have been. There is a mystery character that develops in the second half to maintain the drama.

This is a simple heart warming romance which always has a happy ending and involves beautiful people...just like real life.
