8614475,5,B001WBQKQY,"Agree with first reviewer. Many instructional dvds sit in my drawer because they are BORING or a pain to use. This is challenging, fun, different, and created in such a way that it is very easy to use - repeat segments as many times as you like, skip ahead, etc. I even wrote to Rachel George I liked this (and the Volume 2 which is also awesome) so much. Cheers, Rachel! Make some more! :)",1278892800,,390,4.213333333333333
8614476,5,B001WBQKQY,"The only advanced instructional that has the written choreography with the break down of each combination and eight count exactly!!!! Easy to follow!!

This DVD teaches an intricate drum solo routine to Frank Lazzaro's ""Cairo to Casablanca,"" also found on Middle Earth's ""Lavender"" CD. The variety of rhythms featured, coupled with the precise locks, isolations and layering Rachel is famous for make this piece a treat for dancers looking to expand their repertoire of performable drum solos as well as ideas for movements to add to their own choreographies. This choreography is technically challenging while portraying a mood of sassiness and fun.",1237680000,5,650,5.372549019607843
