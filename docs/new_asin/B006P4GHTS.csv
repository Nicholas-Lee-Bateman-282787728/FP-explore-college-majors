8502582,1,B006P4GHTS,Very distorted. The picture looks like someone copied the the game from an old vhs tape to a home dvd recorder/copier. Very Choppy and looks like something from 35 years ago on tv. Too bad that espn couldn't have made the dvd instead. Just seemed that xos sports did a very bad job. Wish I wouldnt have bought the disc. Buyer be ware.,1406160000,,334,4.317460317460317
8502583,5,B006P4GHTS,I enjoyed this victory as much as any the mountaineers have ever won.  WV all the way!  Go Mountaineers!  Super job!,1371772800,,116,4.428571428571429

8502586,3,B006P4GHTS,"I am a college football fan in general & a Mountaineer fan in particular.  I have all three WVU BCS bowl wins on DVD.  This is by far the worst product:  the video quality is poor to average, the content quality is lacking & there are no special features.  I have no explanation for the content not having the pregame hype by the ESPN announcers (who were excellent) and the pregame interviews with the coaches.  Also, there are no commercials, which is good, but when returning from one the announcer mentioned that ""Obie had recovered!""  If one had not seen the game, one would have no way of knowing Cook #25 had tackled the mascot in the end zone & he (actually she) ad libbed throwing up in a trash can...whoever edited this out deprived  the viewers of the ebb & flow of one of the biggest momentum changing plays and the youthful exuberance displaying comic relief.  If you want only game action, this is for you.  If you want more, burn your own dvd from ESPN3.  For a little more space & about 5 viewing minutes, you will have a better product.  You can even record a small part of the halftime show (Train); maybe there is copy right laws that prevented some of this.  If you are spending over $5, you are better off doing it yourself & fast forwarding through the (Blank on ESPN3) commercial time.",1336780800,4,1308,4.426778242677824
8502587,5,B006P4GHTS,Received it when they said I would. Good quality DVD. Had no problems. Nice to watch WVU smack Clemson again and again and again! Hey WVU just scored again!,1334534400,,156,4.413793103448276
8502588,5,B006P4GHTS,I was very pleased with the quality and editing of the video.  The video was edited in such a way that you still felt the flow of the entire game.  Great work!  Great price!,1332028800,,173,4.029411764705882
8502589,1,B006P4GHTS,Agree with other reviewers.  Poor quality all the way.  The extra 15 minutes of bonus coverage was never available online.  Website was for xossports just to try to sell you merchandise and the video was not available.,1331251200,5,218,4.837837837837838
8502590,1,B006P4GHTS,"I just received my Ornage Bowl DVD.  I read comments about the poor quality and thought maybe just their TV.  Well most were right on.  Its one thing not to have Hi Def quality but the angles were poor and depending on what camera angle they recorded from would show how bad to how good the quality was.  The worst part is they give you a free 15 minutes online of highlights, but that just goes to show how good the DVD quality should have been.  A 3 year old in front of a TV with a BETA camcorder could have done a better job.  I gave it one star because I was at the game and wanted backup to my DVR copy.",1330560000,5,609,3.910569105691057
8502591,2,B006P4GHTS,"The video is of very poor quality.  All the motion on the DVD digitizes like it was filmed in a speed unable to handle the motion of sport. At times forward passes causes the ball to nearly disappear due to digital distortion.  Extremely disappointing.  I would not recommend buying this, there are downloadable HD digital copies that cost far less and are of much, much better quality.",1330041600,6,386,4.731343283582089
