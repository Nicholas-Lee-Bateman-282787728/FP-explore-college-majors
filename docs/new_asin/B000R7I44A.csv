2859755,5,B000R7I44A,"According to Nickelodeon, this DVD will feature the first double length (60 minute) Backyardigans episode, Super Secret Super Spy. This episode will air on Monday September 17th at 7PM ET/PT. The DVD follows on Tuesday, September 18th. Singer Cindy Lauper provides the main title theme song ""The Lady in Pink""; much in the same fashion as the James Bond movies. Pablo can be seen on the DVD cover and in commercials wearing a white jacketed tuxedo and dashingly holding a juice box (shaken or stirred?). He also cleverly hides a jet pack on his back, provided by the head of the International Super Spy agency, Miss T (Tasha). Agent Pablo his assistant Tyrone must stop the evil Lady in Pink (Uniqua) and her bumbling henchman Austin, from stealing three top secret containers. A cool, hip jazz soundtrack provides a basis for the action, including Uniqua's infamous Tickle Torture.

Super Secret Super Spy travels to multiple locations in this episode, another first for the kids from the backyard. Locales include, London, Miami, Switzerland and the Carribbean.

Also included are ""The Secret of Snow"" and the never before seen episode ""A Giant Problem"".

Other DVDs have been a favorite and the storyline and creative process involved in this production make it a disc sure to please.",1188864000,12,1287,5.0046728971962615

2859924,5,B000R7I44A,I have bought several Backyardigans episodes but this one was special. My son seems more interested when there is a lot of different events going on in a movie. This one is sort of like a cartoon James Bond. The art work and colors are supurb. We were so tired of watching Barney videos. Our son is only 20 Months old.

Dora or Diego after two hours would have seen a malfunction in the player!
The characters relate information to children in a way that is not degrading to their intelligence and that is real important to me as we have never talked down to our children, but they also make it fun and enjoyable so that the girls try to sing and dance along.  A nice balance to some of the shows that they could be exposed to.",1231113600,,768,4.1066666666666665

The backyardigans is a really good movie, as a big sister I think it teaches kids good things. ""Like there is this episode that the whole thing is about saying please and thank you.""

My sister probably watches this movie and 3 times a day.

  The characters are different from some of the other characters because they are not drawn. They look real for a toddlers eye view. I really recommend this show/movie for parents that have kids from eighteen months to five years olds. Because it teaches little kids about manners and other things. They can sit there and watch like three or four episodes  and you can do work around the house or just relax, when they are watching the shows. if you don't have a lot of money they are not that much money to buy the movies.

2860032,5,B000R7I44A,"This DVD contains the last episodes of Season Two of The Backyardigans, but luckily for us all, there's going to be a Season Three.

In a change of format, the first adventure is a double feature, rolled into one 60 minute spy movie named ""International Super Spy (Parts 1 & 2)"", complete with music, opening sequences, and lots of gadgets.  Pablo plays Agent Secret, Tasha is the head of the secret service, and Austin is the kangaroo of many disguises as Pablo's faithful contact.  Of course there must be villains, and this time Agent Secret is up against Uniqua, as the Lady in Pink and her evil henchman Tyrone, who looks like Odd Job.  The assignment is to recover three cylinders before the bad guys do.

Modeled after the James Bond movies, this one provides excellent entertainment for all ages, with hot dance numbers and a guest appearance in voice over by Cyndi Lauper, the girl who knows how to have fun.

The next episode is ""The Secret of Snow"" where Uniqua seeks out Ice Lady Tasha to find the aforementioned secret.  Austin is the Ice Lady's overworked and kind hearted assistant, while Pablo is a cowboy and Tyrone is a jungle dweller.  This one is set to Christmas tunes including Jingle Bells, Good King Wenceslaus and Deck the Halls.

The show ends with ""A Giant Problem"" where Queen Uniqua's afternoon nap is rudely interrupted by the pitter patter of Tasha's giant feet.  Silly sorcerers Tyrone and Pablo are commanded to chase the giant away, but aren't so sure they can handle such a big job.  The music for this episode is immediately recognizable as `80s pop.

Another excellent Backyardigans DVD, and a must-have if you're a fan of the series.

2860034,5,B000R7I44A,"So, do you like your juice box shaken or stirred?

Well, the James Bond-esque Pablo likes his shaken, thank-you-very-much!

This fantastic DVD includes the first Backyardigans movie ever, Super Secret Super Spy. Featuring hip jazz and kid-friendly James Bond references, Pablo--Agent Secret--is hot on the tail of Lady in Pink (Uniqua). With her henchman, Tyrone the Moose, the villains race around the world to obtain three containers with unknown contents.

Tasha the Hippo plays ""Miss T"", the head of the secret spy organization, while the purple kangaroo, Austin, dons various disguises as he provides Pablo with state-of-the art equipment (like a transmitting snowcone!) which gives Pablo his assignment.

Pablo's fast race car turns into a boat, helicopter, snowmobile and other modes of transportation (too cool!), and the music is top notch. In fact, he must peform certain dance moves in order to unlock the secret containers.

But what happens when the code needs two people to dance...and then three? Who will get the containers first? And, more importantly, what in the world is IN those three containers?!

From Switzerland to London, Super Secret Super Spy is a rousing movie that young fans (and adults!) will adore. My only criticism is the song that's supposedly sung by Cyndi Lauper. #1 The singing sounded like it was done by an amateur who could barely hit the high notes #2 It didn't sound like Cyndi Lauper! (So don't let THAT be a draw for you to buy this DVD...)

In addition to the Backyardigans first movie, this 100 minute DVD also includes the episode A Giant Problem (set to 80's-inspired pop music) as well as a Dirty Socks Funtime Band Music Video and ""The Lady in Pink"" Featurette. The Secret of Snow episode, which showcases Dixieland Jazz, is also featured on this DVD.

In addition to the catchy lyrics and fun plot, the colors really POP in this episode (how about that white tuxedoed Pablo racing down a highway in his cherry red convertible?)
