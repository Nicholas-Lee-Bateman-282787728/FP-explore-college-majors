You knew everyone who was going to die, and once again  you have people taking more risks to save a stupid dog.  It seems to be  against the rules these days to let a dog die in the movies.  I'm not  against dogs or anything, It just seems like a stupid PC stunt to me.  Now  look, I've gotten off track.

48683,4,0783226535,"Stallone and the composer think they're involved in a much better movie than a schlocky 90s disaster flick, and that's a big reason why I liked it. Sly is in peak ""hero"" mode, fully committed to saving every stranger in a tunnel filling with water. The cause for this disaster is also funnily contrived, when today's movies would just say ""terrorists did it."" I should also note that this was when blockbusters still relied heavily on practical effects, and some shots here are impressive (SPOILER?... A scene of fire bursting through the tunnel comes to mind).

Enjoyable movie, but not quite 4/5 stars (I'd give it 3.5 if I could).",1503446400,,633,4.754545454545455

48703,3,0783226535,"Sylvester Stallone will never get past his two iconic roles of Rocky and Rambo.  No matter what else he does.  This might be his best movie since the original Rocky.  There is an explosion in a tunnel beneath the Hudson river and he tires to rescue the victems out of the tunnel.  There is plenty of action, and suspense in this one.  A disaster/action move.

He writes and directed all the Rocky Movies, and he continues to direct many of his films.  He is in the class of a Jerry Lewis, Mr. Lewis wrote and directed EVEY one of his films also.  Sometimes during the breaks of directing other films.  I wish some celebrity would fund a Muscular Dystrophy Telethon to respect Mr. Lewis's unrelenting contribution raise funds for research to cure this scary disease that takes away the use of all bodily muscles.

48734,5,0783226535,"This was one of the best Sylvester Stallone movies that got overlooked in my opinion. Coming off the box office hit Cliffhanger, this disaster film hits just the right tone of action, drama, and tenderness. Sure it has to pay dues to disaster films of the past such as The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno but all disaster movie have to do that. Stallone is very good here as a every man who tries to help those in need and right a wrong in his life. It was a modest box office hit in the US but did big business overseas. If you have not seen it, grab a copy and some popcorn for a Friday night and have fun. Highly recommended movie.",1454371200,2,646,4.217741935483871

You talk about determined, Sylvester Stallone is so convincing and determined to save all of the those trapped. Stallone's performance is very physical and demanding. And there is also a very impressive cast including Amy Brenneman, Viggo Mortensen, Dan Hedaya, Jay O. Sanders, Karen Young, Claire Bloom, Danielle Harris and Barry Newman. The excellent score is by Randy Edelman. Randy Edelman scores has not only a lot of drive and energy, but there is a real emotion there that genuinely touches you and brings the humanity, the human element, the struggle to save others and survive to the forefront.",1421884800,,899,5.040268456375839

48806,1,0783226535,"So I finally got to see this movie after all these years.  And frankly if I had know how poor this movie was, I may have just left it alone.

The movie has Stallone in it who was a big shot EMS or director of EMS or something like that.  But he has fallen from grace and he can only find work as a taxi driver.  That doesn't really make sense to me.  A guy who did all that good for people and makes one mistake and suddenly he's reduced to a taxi driver?  He couldn't find work anywhere else any field?  His only safety net is to become a taxi driver?

Plus why does anyone tolerate him at the scene of this accident or in this control room?  Do they just let him in for old time's sake?  Nostalgia?  If I went to one of my old jobs and tried to help out, they would probably be happy to see me and ask how I was doing, but if they were in crisis mode like these guys were, they'd politely ask me to leave.  They wouldn't put up with me like they did with Stallone.

Also throughout the movie, Stallone is saying he won't leave anyone behind.  But he leaves George behind to die without even really trying to find a way to get him out, or make him comfortable in his last few minutes on Earth, or even leave him with a light source so he doesn't have to die in the dark.  Plus when the old guy's wife dies, the husband insists on not leaving her behind, but Stallone tells him to leave her.  So he's constantly leaving people behind and contradicting himself.

The worst part is when Stallone himself is left behind with one of the survivors and he throws a temper tantrum because he's mad at the tunnel or angry for being in such a bad movie, I can't really decide which it is.  So they eventually get out and he has to tell a woman that her boyfriend, George, died but he managed to get her bracelet back that he borrowed from her for some reason.  ""Yeah, sorry your boyfriend died, but here's a tacky bracelet to remember him by!""

The only parts about this movie that I liked was the dog, Cooper and the performance by Trina McGee.  Her performance was very good and she made me believe she was actually scared for being in the situation she was in.  Other than those two things, this movie was lame.

Skip this one.",1418601600,,2221,4.125874125874126

48893,3,0783226535,"I was never a big fan of disaster flicks but I remember this one as being decent. After re-visiting it I'm changing my tune.

Here's the scoop. Sylvester Stallone plays Kit Latura. He was a big wig in New York's Emergency Response Department. Something bad happened on his watch and some people got killed. He's tossed out. Now, through a series of flukes, the tunnel connecting NYC and New Jersey is collapsed at both ends and Kit just happens to be there (why not?). He has to fight the politics and the circumstances to try and help those trapped inside.

This is directed pretty well. The problem is at the script level. In trying the figure out some of he problems in freeing the trapped victims Stallone, and some of those he's interfacing with, rattle off a lot of technical jargon. Well...they spew it out so fast they could just as easily been reciting a phonebook and I wouldn't have known. And when he's down in the tunnel with the trapees there are a lot of dime-store platitudes about how ""we gotta stick together"" and ""we can do anything we want if we try hard enough."" My God I thought someone from Hallmark might have written the script. And the trapees: Sometimes they're yelling at Stallone because they figure he's leading them to their doom. Other times he's their savior and will do whatever he asks. Sometimes they try hard and sometimes they're really nasty toward one another. There are also loads of cliches being bandied about.

This is an Okay watch. Just check your brains at the door and have at it.",1372636800,,1528,4.589743589743589

48897,4,0783226535,"This movie has generally tended to get bad reviews. While some of the acting is cheesy and some of the scenes are completely implausible, it is still an interesting action movie. The premise is that an accident at the mouth of a tunnel from Manhattan causes the tunnel to not only be locked, but also in danger of flooding and collapse. Passengers trapped inside have to try to find a way out with the water rising. An ex transit cop who supposedly knows the tunnel like the back of his hand volunteers to go into the tunnel through a ventilation shaft to try to lead the trapped people out. While much of the action borders on the ridiculous with many last second escapes and impossible feats, what makes the movie interesting is the odd venue for an escape movie like this. It's interesting to visualize how a tunnel is built and what might happen if someone were trapped in one. This movie didn't win a lot of rave reviews, but it's worth checking out if you like action movies.",1369526400,2,981,4.4860335195530725

48909,4,0783226535,"I have to preface this with the admission that I am not a Stallone fan by any means.  I am, however, a fan of things that go BOOM!  As disaster films go, this one might be minor, in that it only involves a small portion of humanity rather than a city, the nation, or the world, but it's still absorbing to watch.  (Although I've often wondered why Claire Bloom of all actresses, lowered her standards to appear in this!)
As far as the story goes, it's ponderous and punishing in that it glosses over so much.  I still don't quite understand what that whole ""disgraced EMS"" business was about, it's mentioned in bits and pieces in passing and really doesn't amount to much because disgraced or not, Stallone's character is instantly in the thick of it solving problems like he owned the joint.
Of course, the whole thing is based on a clich&eacute;, trapped people banding together and working their way to safety, losing members along the way until only a smaller number gain daylight.
I was amused to hear Stallone describe this film as something that has no villains in it.  Apparently, he missed the part about the men illegally transporting barrels of toxic waste or the gang of diamond thieves who rob a man and steal his car (the cause of this disaster).  Not to mention the woman official (Rosemary Forsyth) who was more concerned with getting things opened up again instead of worrying about any possible survivors.  Also, the people in the tunnel weren't so charming; hardly the lot one would invite to tea.
For me it's more about the components, the disaster itself (as a character).  Some of the actors rise above the material (especially Stan Shaw as George).  Pity there was so little of Viggo Mortensen, to waste an asset like that in a comic throwaway moment!",1365033600,,1774,4.660256410256411

48941,3,0783226535,"I first saw Daylight on December 20th 1996, at a preview screening at a long since-demolished theater. It was an enjoyable experience at the time though I was let down at the numerous cliches the story bombarded us with. Now, over 14 years later, I am still impressed by the action the film has to offer, but the predictable nature of the narrative brings the overall quality of the film down.

The opening scene introduces an illegal shipment of highly-volatile chemicals being smuggled through the Holland Tunnel (New York to New Jersey). A stolen car driven by eccentric diamond thieves (who look and act a lot like the Splatterpunks from RoboCop 3) crashes into the transport truck carrying said chemicals with a resulting explosion that incinerates almost every living thing in the tunnel before causing it to collapse at both ends. Disgraced EMS Chief Kit Latura (Stallone) witnesses the explosion and throws himself back into the game and into the tunnel to rescue the handful of trapped survivors.

Daylight goes through all of the expected motions. It does make a strong effort to make us care about the characters but the real stars of the show are the in-camera stunts (very rare these days) and the Oscar-nominated sound effects (which lost to The Ghost and the Darkness). There's plenty of exciting set-pieces, the best of which is Kit's descent into the tunnel via a series of unstable ventilation fans. But the character drama moments are upset by inconsistent acting and questionable behavior. There's nothing exceptional about Daylight, but it's an entertaining, if relatively disappointing, action/disaster no-brainer.

The Blu Ray sports a murky 1.85:1 1080p transfer. The film never looked any better than this due to the dirty nature of the setting, and, much like the film itself, the transfer is good without being great. The DTS HD-MA sound design is much better though.",1296345600,3,1894,5.044728434504792

48943,4,0783226535,"Good effects and good acting make this an enjoyable film. Films like this don't win awards (usually) but they're made for good, old-fashioned fun.  This one fits the bill.  Enjoy!",1293580800,,179,4.933333333333334
48944,5,0783226535,I loved this movie as a kid and was happy to buy it. 5/5  movies should be more like this nowa days,1284163200,,99,3.5
48945,4,0783226535,"After a brief argument between two guys who may or may not structural engineers, the first ten minutes or so contain roughly one reference per minute to the Hudson River and a tunnel, presumably the Holland.  It comes as no surprise when a goofy gang of jewel thieves steals a car and accidently rams into some trucks carrying toxic chemicals that shoot massive fireballs, implode the tunnel, and burn like napalm.  And you KNOW Sylvester Stallone - as disgraced former EMS chief Kit Latura - loves the smell of napalm in the morning.  It's his mission to band together a ragtag group of survivors (who fulfill every stereotypical diversity requirement for ""random"") who face a variety of dangers, not the least of which is an exponentially diminishing air source, and lead them towards daylight.

The special effects for this film are awesome!  The explosions throughout are perfect, and at the beginning produce a hilarious human on fire scene - if such a scene exists - where a random extra rolls around in flames like a trick birthday candle that won't go out.  Another sends wall tiles and shards of rock like ninja stars into a ""token"" character with enough concussive force to eject Goose AND Maverick.  Comparable to the FX is the action, but many scenes are a bit hokey.  One of the more joke-worthy shows Latura battling massive ventilation fans in the most ignorant manner possible, and it's simply a preposterously thought out yet entertaining action sequence.  Later an, oil tanker rolls and creates something straight out of Temple of Doom.  I also recommend looking out for a ludicrous scene devised for the sole purpose of displaying Stallone's ability to do a one-arm pullup.  Brilliant.  The hits just keep on coming.  From beginning to end there is one intricately dangerous mouse-trap after another from which Latura must lead the superb supporting cast including Viggo Mortensen and Amy Brennemen.

There are major downfalls to Daylight, however.  The score is too loud, far too melodramatic and detracts from several scenes.  As for character development, there is none.  The cast is superfluous at best, comparable to the anonymous Ensign Smith who always beams down on dangerous Star Trek away missions with Cpt. Kirk and Spock.  I didn't care about one of them, and no connection to the audience is even attempted.  Finally, Stallone's never been known to deliver magnificent monologues, but in Daylight he absolutely butchers several lines through the use of grunts, yells, and guttural noises impossible for other humans to produce or understand.  Almost forgot, the final scene is completely absurd for a tunnel nearly 100 feet below water.

Watching this film is like a metaphor for the actual movie.  Parts are hopeless, dark, and disappointing, but eventually there is a light at the end of the tunnel.",1273968000,,2833,5.0085470085470085

48961,5,0783226535,"""Daylight"" is my second favorite disaster flick.  ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (the original version) is my all time favorite.  ""Daylight"" mimics ""The Poseidon Adventure"" in many ways.  Both films deal with a group of disaster survivors trapped beneath water.  In ""Daylight,"" it is a collapsed tunnel rather than the luxury liner of ""The Poseidon Adventure.""  The survivors must battle rising water, electrical cables, flames, rats, and crumbling walls and staircases as they escape from the tunnel.

  Kit Latura (action adventure icon Sylvester Stallone) is a renegade lone wolf who is much like Reverend Scott of ""The Poseidon Adventure.""  Latura, a former emergency medical chief, is determined to rescue the tunnel survivors and get them to daylight.  His romantic interest is a struggling playwright, Madelyne Johnson (Amy Brenneman of ""Judging Amy"").  Other survivors include a group of juvenile delinquents, an elderly couple who've lost their son and are obsessed with keeping his dog alive, and a vacationing family that is trying to mend its broken relationships.  Most importantly, there is a tunnel security officer who is desperate to see his fellow employee/girlfriend; he wants to ask her to marry him.

  The characterization in ""Daylight,"" as it is in ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" is excellent.  The viewer will fall in love with the characters.  I wept whenever one of them died as I did when Mrs. Rosen (Shelley Winters) suffered a fatal heart attack in ""The Poseidon Adventure.""  Both movies are about surviving so that we can continue to love.  Through love, we find the strength and desire to live.  It is love that makes life worth living.  It is love that keeps us bound to others even if we are separated by water, flames, and death.  This is all clearly expressed in the terrific theme song ""Whenever There Is Love"" sung by superstars Donna Summer and Bruce Roberts.  I love that song; once you get it in your head, it's hard to get out.  It is as lovely as ""The Morning After,"" the theme song from ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" which also deals with love helping us find a way to safety.

  ""Daylight"" is highly recommended for fans of Sylvester Stallone.  It proved that he can act without having to expose his muscular physique as in ""Rocky"" and ""Rambo.""  This clean, family friendly movie is also highly recommended for fans of disaster flicks such as ""Earthquake, ""The Towering Inferno,"" and the aforementioned ""The Poseidon Adventure.""",1239148800,3,2457,5.057356608478803
48962,4,0783226535,"If there's something to admit about the successful career of Sylvester Stallone is his clever smell to chose original proposals in which the action and  drama shake hands. Particularly, his most notable filmic projects during the nineties were two: this one and ""Cliffhanger"" ( By far my favorite first choice).

During a normal day in N.Y.C., New York Holland's tunnel collapses when a terrible accident traps people inside and so, this usual way will become in a true hell, with multiple dangers to surmount.

The realism sequences are outstanding and certainly make us to remind Poseidon's adventure in more than one scene, in which to survive against all the odds is the main and unique goal.

As the previous sequels, there will be a lot of secondary plots, in which courage, despair and anguish will conform a very worthy film to watch.",1234915200,3,842,4.908450704225352

  It seems that a very bad chemical company wants several truck loads of explosive waste taken away but doesn't want to pay the cost of getting rid of it the right way, so they hire some guys and ship it out on trucks that have to drive through New York City to get rid of it. Add jewel thieves in a high speed chase from cops and the Holland Tunnel and before you can say Irwin Allen you have a spectalular explosion and people trapped in a flooding tunnel with no way out and the walls coming down around them. Enter Sly as a former EMT(disgraced but it really wasn't his fault) and you know who's going in to save the day.

  Like I said nothing new but Sly keeps this one on track and the director keeps the pace so tight that it pulls you in(at least it did me). Top flight action scenes and a pretty good cast make this one a very good rainy day movie.",1175731200,,1091,4.0046082949308754
48980,4,0783226535,"DAYLIGHT is everything you'd expect it to be as it joins the genre of disaster films of the seventies.  Sylvester Stallone is a noble, almost saintly, hero, and we get a mixed bag of trapped people in the Holland Tunnel.  Director Rob Cohen wisely focuses on the disaster and its aftermath and leaves the stereotypical characters to respond in expected ways.  But what a cataclysmic set of special effects!  The car crashes and resultant explosions are terrific and incredibly filmed. That alone is one reason to watch the film.  Much of Stallone's heroics are implausible, but in a film like this, we are indeed holding out for a hero.  The supporting cast is eclectic and adequate:  a pre Lord of the Rings Viggo Mortensen is some kind of adventurer whose self-importance is his downfall; Jay O. Sanders, Karen Young and Danielle Harris are the troubled family; Stan Shaw is the heroic but doomed cop; Dan Hedaya is the loyal ex-partner; Amy Brenneman is the frustrated writer who becomes Stallone's romantic interest; the lovely Claire Bloom and Colin Fox are the elderly couple with the dog; and even Stallone's son, Sage, gets in on the action.  Nothing new here, folks, but it is well done and the effects are awesome.",1115164800,4,1224,4.822966507177034
48981,3,0783226535,"Daylight is a traditional ""disaster in New York"" story, with Sylvester Stallone playing the fired Chief who redeems himself by saving people from a tunnel collapse. Given that short blurb, you can probably now plot out the entire movie, from start to finish :)

First, you go through the traditional ""meet all the characters"" scenes. There are fractured families, an older couple, a young struggling author, a prison transport. Throw in some unscrupulous toxic chemical transporters and a trio of insane diamond thieves, and the disaster is telegraphed from the beginning. There's no surprise, and no sense of ""story"" as it begins. It is very blatantly a ""let's see each person start as selfish / uncaring so we can watch them grow"".

Then BOOM! One thing you can say for this movie is that it has some pretty cool special effects. The scenes of the fiery blast shooting through the tunnel and taking it down are pretty impressive. We went back on the DVD and watched that part again. Even while we were watching it, though, we were pretty incredulous that anybody in that blast would have survived enough to let the movie continue. We've seen enough disaster recreations on TV to know what that type of fireball does to people. But of course, this is Hollywood, and while most people are completely slain, you end up with about 12 people trapped within the tunnel who are all perfectly able to walk and talk. There's nobody in between. Hmmmmmm.

While Stallone goes through some insanely silly moves through moving fans to get IN to the troubled group, Viggo Mortensen gets his moment to shine as Nord (yes, that's really his name), the mountain climber / rich company leader. Nord is shown as a blondeish (of course) super-sure-of-himself man who has taken on every challenge in life. Luckily, Nord is trapped in the tunnel with all his rock climbing equipment. So he tells everyone he is going to save them, tells them to pray, and heads up into a shaft to climb out. Stallone tries to warn Nord that the shaft is shaky, and for some boneheaded reason, Nord's response is ""don't worry, I'm invincible!"" OK, he doesn't quite say that, but he doesn't pay attention to the creaks and groans of the area around him. It is really hard to believe that someone as successful as Nord in extreme situations would have possible not gone more cautiously into this current one. Sure enough, Stallone is correct, Nord is squished, and Viggo's light is put out.

Stallone then quickly goes on to do even MORE ridiculous things than Nord was attempting, but of course being the hero, Stallone's various efforts work out pretty nicely.

I realize of course that the movie aims to show how everyone deals with stress poorly and then finally bands together as a team to help each other out, but it was REALLY annoying how certain characters kept turning into insane complainers. Sure, there will be one or two whiners in a crowd. But I think it was way overblown here. Instead of having the movie one where we could sympathize with the characters going ""against the odds"" - you really wanted to see most of the characters killed off. Quickly. Surprisingly, they really do kill off far more characters than one would expect in a movie like this.

But, of course, the Guy Gets the Girl, and enough people survive to make the whole ordeal worth it. Unfortunately, the movie ends with perhaps one of the worst ending lines ever made in a movie. You'll have to wait and judge that one for yourself.

A fun disaster flick with some great fiery moments - just don't expect compelling character development or much of a plot in this one. And as a safety note, contrary to what the movie says, the reason you want to be in a car during an electrical storm is NOT that the tires are rubber. Studies show that the amount of rubber on a tire is completely meaningless when compared with a bolt of lightning. It's the metal cage of the car that protects you from the electrical strike.",1115078400,17,3957,4.668579626972741
48982,5,0783226535,I literally live right next to the Holland Tunnle so I had to give this 5 stars even though it's your basic hollywood wizz bang flick with bad acting. Great special effects!,1112572800,,173,4.4375
48983,3,0783226535,"To date, there exists three films with great performances by Sylvester Stallone: ""Rocky"" (of course), ""First Blood,"" and ""Cop Land."" These three films stand alone because Stallone put himself entirely behind the characters, going so far, in the case of ""Cop Land,"" to gain fifty pounds for the role. This is a man who can write, direct, and act. So why does he make so many bad films? Why did he, like Jean Claude Van Damme, die the straight-to-video death? It's an interesting question. But it's one that I do not have the answer to. Maybe ""Rocky VI"" needs to be about Stallone beating up his agents.

In any case, with so many bad films on his record, Sylvester Stallone manages to keep getting overlooked for any other achievement that doesn't have the trademark of ""Rocky"" or ""Rambo."" In 1995, he decided to make a different kind of action film. Under the direction of Rob Cohen, Stallone abandoned the shoot-to-kill image to play a former EMT Chief turned New York City cabbie. It was a wise choice.

The plot: Two trucks carrying toxic waste are traveling through the Holland Tunnel to Jersey when a group of thieves, hauling some serious buns, cause an accident to ignite the chemicals on the trucks. ""Boom"" is too light of a word to describe what happens next. The tunnel collapses at both ends. A wall of flame engulfs the tunnel ""Independence Day""-style, leaving maybe a dozen people alive inside with a chemical fire burning up what oxygen is left to breathe. Stallone's character, Kit Latura, is present just outside the tunnel when the blast hits. He snaps back into the mindset of a paramedic and begins to save lives. As it becomes clear to the city engineers and emergency crew on the scene that a traditional rescue operation won't work, Latura is given clearance to enter the tunnel through the ventilation system.

Pretty standard action stuff so far. As the film progresses, it's Stallone's interaction with the survivors in the tunnel that begins to elevate it above clichd action film junk. The people inside are just normal people in an extraordinary situation: Sometimes they don't act how we would like to think we would, and sometimes they go above and beyond the call of human nature to help each other. There are some real inspirational moments in ""Daylight,"" boosted further by an emotional score by Randy Edelman. These are the moments you will remember after the credits roll.

There is also a moment allowed to Stallone, famous for these types of scenes, when he lets loose. In ""Rocky,"" it was the scene when Rocky yells at his trainer, hitting the door, screaming about the cleanliness of his apartment. In ""First Blood,"" it was a monologue about the horrors of Vietnam. In ""Daylight,"" he is fed up with his own search for redemption, and is fully ready to embrace death as he plunges an explosive into the mud of the Hudson River. There is something to be said about an actor who manages not to look ridiculous when he rambles on for minutes on end in front of the camera. Stallone inhabits this kind of character monologue with a raw energy that brings him a strange grace as an actor.

""Daylight"" may not be a great film, but it's a good one, and it shows that Sylvester Stallone may not be as big of a failure without Rocky as most people think.",1112313600,13,3282,4.681109185441941
48984,4,0783226535,In this movie we begin with several looks at different people going through there daily lives. Gradually they all converge on a tunnel in New York city that goes under the river to get to the other side. At the same time a runaway car is flying through the tunnel to get away from the police(some punks pulled off a robbery). Unknowingly they crash into a convoy of trucks carrying toxic flammable material. The resulting firey explosion is by far one of the best Ive ever seen. Our heros are trapped in the tunnel in which most people died. Stallone is an ex-rescue chief who goes in against all odds to lead them out. The battle of these people is almost overwelming but they forge on in all sorts of bad conditions. At places there is some fine acting as the group bonds with each other and things are revealed about them that takes the viewer by surprize. I won't spoil the ending but it too is pretty good although  unbeliveable. Even so I recommened this movie.,1091836800,,967,4.463276836158192

A rag-tag group of survivors, containing every possible patented Hollywood character, from the dignified elderly to the know-it-all WASP and the fiesty token minority, are subjected to a truly hilarious disaster that makes the Poseidon Adventure look like Citizen Kane.  My favorite part of this film is the invincible dog.  You can always tell a Hollywood hackjob by the invincible dog, which always survives everything and is, gosh, just so darn *cute* that you're supposed to get all weepy with relief when it survives through to the credits.  A classic example is the golden retriever in Independence Day that, in an awe-inspiring display of poor blue screening, somehow jumps out of the way of a fireball that just destroyed Los Angeles..and of course just at the last moment.  A cousin of that redoubtable pup is found here, where it actually disappears for half the movie and then suddenly comes paddling out of nowhere in a moment that is clearly intended to be triumphant, but is just flat out funny.  It's long been known that people watching a movie react far more emotionally to injuries to dogs than to people, but you've stooped pretty darn low when you have to fall back on that as a plot device.",1078790400,9,1268,4.847222222222222

But what I like best about this film is that it ""quietly"" includes two individuals who are now big hits in Hollywood ... Viggo Mortensen of the recent trilogy Lord Of The Rings and Amy Brenneman of the current TV hit, ""Judging Amy.""
I like both of these actors so I have a special appreciation for ""Daylight."" It was one of Amy's first films, but it was just one of many for Viggo. Viggo has worked a long time in film, quietly in the background, offering wonderfully crafted supporting roles. I'm excited that Viggo is now being casted as a Leading Star. Good for him.

If you don't like this sort of flick, then give it a pass, because there is nothing really new. However, you if you enjoy edge of the seat thrills or daring do, well this is a pretty good time.
Stallone dons the mantle of hero properly and gives you nail biting scenes as he goes in to rescue people trapped in the Holland Tunnel after it is sealed off after a fiery explosion.  Rob Cohen's (Dragonheart) direction is taut and fast paced, not living a lot of time to get to know these people, but it works.
A lot of good supporting work from solid actors, of note Viggo Mortensen (Aragon of Lord of the Rings for those who have been sleeping of late), makes this a rather enjoyable action film.",1071360000,3,996,4.226315789473684

49001,4,0783226535,"It's been a long time since I've given a Sylvester Stallone flick a positive review, maybe not since First Blood which was released thirteen years prior.  But Daylight is maybe his best action movie, a disaster film that'll make you think twice before driving through a tunnel ever again.  Sly plays an EMS chief whose been disgraced after losing a team while looking for survivors in a collapsed building.  And when an explosion closes the tunnel connection Mannhattan and New Jersey on both ends he offers to go in after any survivors.  He's seeking redemption which Stallone plays with subtle grace, giving his best performace since Rocky.  The supporting characters are equally well acted and includes Amy Brenneman (Judging Amy), Viggo Mortensen (The Perfect Murder) and Dan Hedaya (A Civil Action). I don't want to make this sound like your typical dumb popcorn movie but Daylight will keep you on the edge of your seat with suspense and once the action gets started don't be expecting a chance to catch your breath because it's not coming.  The DVD is fabulous, you'll never knew you're not in the tunnel yourself with the creaking walls and splashing water filling every one of your six speakers (if you're so lucky).  If not the picture is crystal clear and with special features like this it's hard not to recommend it to everybody.",971308800,6,1342,4.859649122807017
49002,2,0783226535,"This film was meticulously crafted to the established disaster movie recipe. That recipe demands a handsome but misunderstood hero, a pretty girl for him to rescue, a good but not particularly likeable person who  will die on cue and of course, a spectacular disaster.
That is exactly  what is served up here. The scenario is that the Holland Tunnel has  collapsed at both ends because of a multiple vehicle pile up that involved  some highly flammable waste being carried illegally through the tunnel. The  requisite set of characters are trapped inside the tunnel and have to find  a way out. Time pressure is added by the fact that the tunnel is not going  to keep the water out forever and Stallone has to find a way out through  long forgotten passages in order to save himself and the girl.
If you are  a disaster movie fan, you are sure to like this film because it passes all  of the standard disaster movie tests. However, there is nothing in the film  that can give it a wider appeal than that. The special effects for the  explosion in the tunnel are very good indeed but the impact of those  effects fades with time as new films go further with better  technology.
The things which make a film last are missing here. You can  be pretty sure about who will escape and who will perish so there is no  suspense. Also, despite a setting with a lot of potential, there is no real  atmosphere. A lot of that is down to the script and acting both of which  are pretty pedestrian.
As a result, I can only recommend this movie to  disaster film buffs and Stallone fans.",964224000,,1572,4.471830985915493
49003,5,0783226535,"Here is a disaster flick that puts the audience into a real life situation, which is unique and quite different from the typical action and adventure films.  The movie, Daylight, is based on a real life occurrence  of a tunnel accident in the late 1940s at the Holland and Lincoln tunnels  under the Hudson River.  Directed by Rob Cohen, the movie is a visionary  masterpiece of a tunnel explosion that brought the whole character set to  work together and risk their lives on this horrible disaster situation with  the elements of nature involved.  The character set is where the true inner  beauty of the movie rests. It is one that I describe as not too well known  to the public with a notable exception of Sylvester Stalone, who played the  lead part.  Here, Stalone played a sympathetic character, who brought the  survivors to daylight.  Although he has the persona of Rocky and Rambo,  Stallone was, in the movie, an ordinary citizen who blends perfectly well  with the others in the set without putting emphasis on muscles or action.  Amy Brenneman (NYPD Blue) plays the female lead.  She adds a freshness and  excitement in the film.  The presence of Viggo Mortenssen (Crimson Tide)  was also exceptional who played a role as a sports celebrity.  The family  role models of Steven & Sarah and their daughter Ashley and an older  couple put emphasis on values of caring and loving in a disastrous  situation.  The juvenile offenders were also terrific.  Stalone's son in  real life, Sage Stalone, especially gave some good highlights in the movie.  The tunnel cop, George, played by Stan Shaw was a symbol of sheer humanity  and warmth as he put the survivors together. Lastly, the worthwhile  appearances of medical-relief workers, firemen and engineers have given  their dedication for making this movie so believable for the audience to  like it.
Besides the good casting, this film is appraised for its  outstanding cinema production as far as visual effects are concern.  The  filming of an explosion at the tunnel is one of a kind.  What really amazes  me here is the long fire ball sequence that takes the audience into this  journey, for the first time, of looking inside  the horrible flame that is  rolling as it impacts every object in its path, melting and burning down  vehicles.  The DTS sound quality of the DVD is amazing here.  Also, there  is a lot of stunt work involved here, of course, in order to make it  believable. Stalone's stunt work in the fan sequence was a thrill portion  to see.  Feeling the power of the water reaping through the ceiling,  turbulent tremors and explosions, and the tile cracks are all formidable  forces that alert the audience to join the character set to express true  fear and is really amazing.  The blowout was the climatic scene between  Stallone and Brennemen for their last chance to escape.  This blowout scene  is very original and is enriched with animated graphics and stunt work,  which is beautifully accomplished.
One thing to comment is the  excellent musical score.  The musical effects present in disaster films  like Daylight have the essence of thrill, fear, escape and hope. In  Daylight, the musical score is one that depicts on heroism, failure and  triumph of the human spirit over fear. In the introduction of the movie  title itself, it has a speedily haunting sound, as it travels with the  audience through a laser journey through a tunnel at night and at fast  speed, which really prompts the audience to be prepared for that  unthinkable situation that is about to happen.
As a huge fan and  collector of disaster films, the movie, Daylight, is a great flick.  The  DVD Collector's Edition is packed with bonus materials.  It includes this  film in anamorphic widescreen, a special ""making of"" and behind the scene  track, feature commentary, production notes, cast & filmakers,  theatrical trailers, a featurette and even a music video of the movie love  theme ""Whenever There Is Love"" performed by Donna Summer.

What made them terrific were not just the great special effects,  but the neat characters and that ""fun quotient.""  In Daylight,  you get to meet an interesting cast, but you never get to know them;  consequently, you never really care what happens to them, and part of the  fun of disaster flicks is caring what happens to the characters.
