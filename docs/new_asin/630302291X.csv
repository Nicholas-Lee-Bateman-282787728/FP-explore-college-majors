534272,3,630302291X,"Joey Coyle was my 2nd cousin. The book ""Finders Keepers"" was more close to being true than the the Movie ""Money for Nothing"".

Joey lived with his mother on Front Street alright, but his older brother Billy and wife Eleanor lived on second street. Also his mom moved in with Joey's sister Ellen and her Husband Charlie O'Brien and his niece Katie O'Brien. Don't remember Billy's kids names.

Also they mentioned in the movie that Joey's middle name was John and that was a mistake his middle name was William after his dad. I think the police accidently arrested a Joseph John Coyle for the crime based on some conflict, heck everybody in Kensington in NE Philly and in SE Philly was either called Jimmy or Joey Coyle.

Also Joey's natural hair color was light and not dark. He died it dark, not blonde when he took off for NY with his friend.

His girl friend was not a marcy, it was some teenager named Linda, who was two timing it. They were both doing drugs and booze.

We just thought he gave all the money away to all the poor on the streets, we never knew he was mixed up with the mob, but that is easy to understand if you live in Philly and are on the streets. There used to be hustlers working for the Italian and Irish mobs on every other corner with a bar.

Anyway, the movie was just OK, I would not watch it again. The actor playing Joey was way too smart for the role, and did not act like the real goofy Joey.

Read the book, if you want a more realistic understanding of what happened. You can read it in a few hours. You can tell the writer was definitely a writer for the Philadelphia Inquirer, what he was not sure of, he left out of the book. The movie may not have portrayed Joey's sister and husband and daughter in the movie for legal reasons. They were a bit more intelligent, religious, and really not wanting to advertise their brother's mistakes.",1282521600,,1874,4.321937321937322

534274,5,630302291X,"I love John Cusak and I found this movie at a garage sale.  I didn't even know about this movie, but I loved it.  It is entertaining and always interesting to see movies about the turmoil characters go through over doing the right thing.  Plus, I believe this is based on a true story.",1112140800,15,285,4.2407407407407405
534275,5,630302291X,"I just seen Money For Nothing and I think it was a great movie that kept me entertaining.  The true story of Joey Coyle was very interesting because some people who find 1.2 million dollars out of a Armored car are shelfish  enough to keep it and do goofy things to try to get away with it .  This  film was shot in locations I was filmilar with including the Old Airport  and near monoghela river in my hometown of Pittsburgh, PA.

534384,2,630302291X,"I got two John Cusack movies the same evening and I am not sure which one this was. I guess the one with Billy Bob Thornton and they embezzled a couple mil. The acting was poor, the dialogue childish... I did not watch either movie through to the end. I was disappointed that Cusack played in such poor, simple movies. I liked him much better in ""Shanghai,"" and ""2010."":",1434672000,,370,4.3768115942028984
534385,5,630302291X,John Cusack is one of those actor's that does not hesitate to take on roles that are always different. His career path shows this. It is always a delight to see some of his earlier work that I had not even known of. Oh and his being so handsome does not hurt!,1431648000,,259,4.0
534419,1,630302291X,"I like John Cusack, but I hate stupidity.  The characters in this show are so stupid.  Their first mistake was taking or not leaving the toolbox or money box... if they hadn't made that mistake at the very beginning, they would never have been found out.  Then, they started spending the money, and they let somebody see them... It was very difficult to watch.  They could have gotten away with it if they wouldn't have been so stupid and greedy.  It is like another movie ""Empire State"" supposedly starring The Rock Dwayne Johnson, but he's really only on the cover of the movie.  He's not really even in the show.",1427068800,,615,4.545454545454546

534494,5,630302291X,I chose this rating because I love how John Cusack portrays this guy! I also love the story which is based on a true story of Joey Coyle. He finds money that fell off a armored truck & craziness ensues! Lol,1388707200,,206,4.048780487804878

534497,5,630302291X,I am a fan of John cusack  The story line is great in this true life film. You r really drawn into the film from the start to the end. Loved it.

534520,3,630302291X,I listened to Joey's story Finders Keepers on a library audio rental a few years ago.  It was much more melancholy than the movie.  The sad thing is that he ended his own life before the movie was released.  He was a goofy young man with a big heart and a drug problem.  I think that explains some of his poor decision making.  If I remember correctly he had voiced his concerns about the movie...he needed the money offered to have it made but it replayed the failures of his life that he didn't seem to be able to get away from.  I liked the movie by itself but when compared to the true story it fell short which is why I gave it a 3.  I think it is better to watch the movie if you haven't read the book and don't know the true story.  I wish the real man could have picked himself up and recovered in as lighthearted a manner as the movie ends.  At the end of the book it talks about the movie but I didn't know it had been released.  May He rest in peace.,1360972800,,961,3.9583333333333335
534521,5,630302291X,One of those questions in life.  Cusak handles it nicely.  His is an unlikely senario but it is food for thought.  Pretty good portrayal with our present day economic woes.,1358294400,,172,4.666666666666667
534522,3,630302291X,"Like Joey Coyle, I am what you call a ""Two Streeter"" and without defining what that actually is, you can't possibly tell his story. I had a port number and was working the docks when I was 15 years old. I actually worked in one of the ""gangs"" where one of the Coyle's was foreman and my cousin did the hiring for that gang. One of my younger brothers was in Joey Coyle's class at Bishop Neumann High.  I was not living back there then so my information on the whole event was third hand. I believe the filmmaker missed a huge opportunity to give some meaningful background to the story via more on the life of a dockworker from that particular neighborhood.  Joey's drug addiction was another reality that could have been elaborated on. The drug sub culture in South Philly in those days was a story in itself. I read the book Finder's Keepers a while back and repurchased it along with this movie. I was glad I did. I think Finder's Keepers is a concise account of the events as they actually happened. The ""Drug Addict"" making a druggie's bad decisions is much more to the heart of the events than the ""loveable idiot"" that the movie romanticized. The whole event was fictionalized even adding a ""lost love retrieved"" interest to the story. I think a movie closer to the book may have been a blacker comedy but if some of the neighborhood anecdotes were inserted it would have added a lot of color.  I see where some of the critics here berated the actors.  I think they did a good job considering that they were miscast in those roles. Debi Mazzar seemed to be playing My Cousin Vinny's girlfriend and Marisa Tomei already owned that a year earlier.  Brad Pitt would have made a great Joey Coyle in those days when the movie was made he was still affordable. All in all, the movie was not that bad. Considering it with movies like Get Him to the Greek, Duplex and Date Movie it might have won an Oscar! Buy the movie and remember Joey Coyle as a good guy who got into drugs and could not get away from them. It even ruined his big payday.",1356825600,,2041,4.360526315789474
534523,4,630302291X,"It sounds like the kind of thing I always wanted to do, so I was intrigued. However, I would add, especially after watching this, I would rather find someone's untraceable money, not government money. With the law and media trying to find you, it has to be a nightmare, not the good life. I am glad I saw it.",1356825600,,308,4.237288135593221
534524,2,630302291X,My husband and I both like John Cusack but this movie just didn't do anything for us.  Just don't think the plot was that good.,1356393600,,127,4.08
534525,3,630302291X,This is an entertaining movie but the main reason I purchased it was for the final scenes of the movie. The end of the movie takes place at the old Pittsburgh airport which was replaced by the newer airport in 1992. I spent a lot of time in the old airport and this movie contains some of the only footage that I can find of the old airport.,1352505600,,341,4.029411764705882
534526,2,630302291X,"Even John Cusack's excellent acting ability can't save this movie.  If I'm understanding correctly, this story is ""based on"" a true event.  Man finds 2 bags of one-hundred dollar bills that have fallen from an armored truck, (total of 1.2 million dollars) and decides to keep the money.  Whereupon he sets about throwing money around, even after a TV newscaster reports that police are looking for anyone who is spending a lot of hundred-dollar-bills. In one scene, he passes out money to strangers on the street.  This mental midget tells practically everyone he knows about his good luck, deals with criminals in an effort to ""launder"" the money, and naturally, criminals being what they are, they cheat him by taking $600,000 in greenbacks and trying to give bags of nickels in return.  Given this character's goal of keeping all the money and living a sumptuous life, there seemed to be nothing too ignorant for him to do in the process of defeating his own purpose.  My advice?  Buy a copy of John Cusack's film ""Runaway Jury"" and enjoy a great story and superb acting, and don't bother with this one.",1324252800,,1106,4.7894736842105265
534527,1,630302291X,"I bought this about a week ago from BARNES & NOBLE and have returned it twice (a total of three copies). None of them would play on a Sony Playstation 3. Sony claims it is the movie. Mill Creek the production company, claims they haven't had any complaints about it not playing and says something must be wrong with my player. I have over 100 Blu-Rays and have since watched 4 other movies. Now remember Mill Creek are the wonderful people that gave us the butchered box set of WISEGUY.
