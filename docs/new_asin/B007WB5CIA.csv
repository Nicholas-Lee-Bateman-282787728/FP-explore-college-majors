8522479,5,B007WB5CIA,"For my taste, this is exactly what an opera should be: melodious and dramatic. And here presented with grace, visual beauty, and elegance: apparently with a view to showing it the way it was very likely shown to its original audiences in the time of librettist Frederick the Great. There is a bit of a culture shock in seeing Montezuma and his Mexicans clad as 18th-century European nobles; but I adjusted and understood it as emphasizing the common humanity of American Indians and Europeans. At the same time, the fact that all the Mexican characters (of both sexes) are sung by women and all the Spaniards by men adds a certain modern piquancy to it that Frederick and Graun almost certainly did not intend. (As I understand, those male roles of pre-19th century opera which today are sung by sopranos, mezzos, and altos were written for and originally performed by castrati.) It becomes apparent at the very end that Frederick had a contemporary political ax to grind, which puts his overwhelming sympathy for the Mexicans more into its contemporary perspective; but this merely whets my historical interest and is in any case a very small price to pay for a thoroughly enjoyable and frequently thought-provoking evening.",1506643200,,1225,4.951456310679611
8522480,5,B007WB5CIA,"Most people who decry this piece of ""Eurotrash"" do not have the faintest idea of how Baroque opera actually looked like on stage.  Well, folks, this is it.  Baroque music was meant to be presented in a Baroque setting, so this production is right on target, and is quite traditional.  Knowing both German and Mexican history, I found the depiction of the Montezuma as an ""Illustrated"" monarch quite a forshadowing of the ""noble savage"" theory.  The Spaniards as usual, are the villains.  The ending, in which Cortez orders the wholesale extinction of the Mexicans was also a sinister forshadowing of the Holocaust itself.  I did not know the opera, nor did I know the singers involved, but they all performed gloriously.  As for cuts, they make long borig operas into viable, entertaining short ones.  A really enjoyable performance of a neglected Baroque masterpiece.",1384992000,2,868,5.020979020979021
8522481,4,B007WB5CIA,"The Deutsche Oper in Berlin is one of Europe's liveliest ensembles. Ensemble it is ! Whether it is visiting guest stars or  house performers, the conductors and production teams always manage to put together a great show.
This heavily cut, wrong language performance of Graun's MONTEZUMA, from 1982, is a fine example of what they do best, even though they are performing at the Baroque Margrafisches Opern Haus in Bayreuth (Wagner isn't the only operatic presence in that town) and not the modern auditorium they call home. The Bayreuth location is a perfect venue for this traditonal but effective staging by Herbert Wernicke.
Conductor Hans Hilsdorf despite allowing heavy cuts gets fine work from the orchestra.
Alexandra Papadjiakou is a bit rough of voice in the travesti title role, but is technically assured and committed to the character she is playing. The American coloratura Catherine Gayer offers a very amusing and very well sung portrayal as a kind of philosopher/servant, also in travesti. Sophie Boulin and Barbara Vogel offer lovely singing. Walton Gronroos is an appropriately malevolent presence as the conqueror who ulimately destroys Montezuma.
There are some grainy moments, but the picture is generally clear and watchable. The sound recording is fine throughout.",1362441600,3,1288,5.313725490196078
8522482,1,B007WB5CIA,I have 275 opera dvds and this is the worst I have ever seen. There is no one that even resembles Montazuma. It looks as if it were staged in a French drawing room. A typical example of Euro trash.,1351641600,3,197,3.95
8522483,4,B007WB5CIA,"Released as part of the Deutsche Oper Archive series, this 1982 recording of Carl Heinrich Graun's Montezuma may not be the most authentic representation of a rare work of Baroque opera seria or the best quality in terms of video presentation, but it's a performance that is well worth preserving for a number of reasons.  Although there are have been some revivals and discoveries of the operas of J.A. Hasse and J.C. Bach in recent years, there are very few recordings available of any of Graun's work, despite the fact that he was an important figure in German opera composition of the period, working as Kapellmeister to King Friedrich II of Prussia, Frederick the Great.  It's his relationship with the latter which is the most notable aspect of this particular work, Montezuma (1755) - aside from the fine musical qualities of the work itself - with the King himself even providing the libretto for the opera, and it's this aspect that is considered in the actual production, recorded in the suitably regal venue of the Markgrfflichen Opernhaus at Bayreuth.

It's not difficult to see what would have attracted Frederick the Great to the subject of Montezuma, as not only is the subject that considers the duty of a great ruler towards his people a popular subject for opera seria, particularly compositions written or following the Metastasian model, but it's one that evidently has political relevance here for the librettist himself.  Montezuma accordingly is characterised as a benevolent ruler, who sees his duty to resolve human misery, not to rule over his subjects by force.  It's a fairly conventional opera seria then in this respect.  Montezuma sings of length of his devotion to his people and his duty, and of striving for personal happiness through his planned marriage to Eupaforice, the Queen of Tlascla.  The plot ties both aspects together rather well with the arrival of the Spanish, Montezuma in his goodness and with faith in human nature, inviting Cortes and Narvs to his wedding, only to be betrayed.  If the relevance to Friedrich II's time isn't obvious - the Seven Years' War would commence a year later in 1756, plunging Prussia into conflict with Austria - it's made apparent in the staging of this production of Montezuma by Herbert Wernicke.  Clearly not set in any exotic location, but rather in a more European palatial setting and gardens, the Aztecs wear the period costume of the courts of the 18th century with powdered wigs, ball gowns and military greatcoats.  The production would also seem to end with a reading of Frederick the Great's actual declaration of war, as if the preceding opera has just been a warning that kindness and wisdom in a ruler is admirable, but sometimes he needs to be wise enough to chose when to fight for those freedoms.

The 1982 performance itself is fine, if not quite authentic in the manner we would expect today. Considerable cuts have been applied to the long repetitions of the aria da capo with some perhaps excised altogether, so the work only runs to 2 hours and 20 minutes in length when you could expect an opera seria of this period to be between three to four hours long.  To make it a little easier on the audience, Montezuma is also sung here in German (with some Spanish recitative), rather than the original Italian (it was probably written in French by Friedrich II before being translated to the common Italian for opera seria).  Although inauthentic, this however works in favour of the production's parallel to the historical Prussian Empire.  There were no specialised baroque ensembles in 1982 either, so other than the harpsichord, the music has been arranged to fit modern orchestra instruments, but the whole pace and rhythm of the performance nonetheless feels absolutely right.  No countertenors either, so the castrato roles are taken up here by female sopranos and mezzo-sopranos, which actually has the impact of making all the Aztecs in this production female and the Spanish male.  If the work is mostly fairly conventional and not terribly dramatic, with stately marching rhythms and expressions of noble sentiments, there are nonetheless some lovely arias and one particularly fine duet between Montezuma and Eupaforice in Act III ('Ach, nur fr Dich' in German).  The singing is also exceptionally good, particularly mezzo-soprano Alexandra Papadjiakou as Montezuma, and the performance of the Deutsche Oper orchestra is also strong, performed with an elegant brio.

Released on DVD only, the video quality isn't up to the standards you would expect today, but certainly acceptable and even very good despite the limitations of the source material. Clearly shot on video 4:3 for television broadcast, there's a certain amount of noise and shimmer in the background, a level of graininess, and chroma noise, but it has nonetheless clearly been fully restored, the colours well-defined, strongly contrasted and a surprising level of sharpness and detail is evident.  The transfer is also very stable, with no flicker or wobble.  The audio track is PCM stereo only and it's also fine, with decent clarity to the orchestration and singing, holding relatively firm on the sustained higher notes.  There are no extra features, but there is an informative essay and a synopsis included in the DVD's booklet.  The dual layer DVD is region free, NTSC, with subtitles in German, English, French, Spanish and Italian.",1341360000,12,5416,5.034675615212528
