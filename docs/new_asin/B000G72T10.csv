8129181,5,B000G72T10,I took this DVD with me to church for the children (ages 2-9) and they all sat there watching intently and really enjoyed the story; the songs are so catchy!  I highly recomend this DVD as well as any other of the God Rcoks DVD's.,1323648000,,230,4.111111111111111
8129182,2,B000G72T10,"I want to start by saying that I LOVE God Rocks!! 'Splat Ball' is my favorite (there is a song in that one that I can listen to over and over - Be Yourself#. My nephew #in Christ) loves these also and so when I saw a new one, we were both excited. I had thought that it would be another cartoon story. It wasn't. It starts and ends in a cartoon, but it's live action in between. My nephew got to see God Rocks perform at a church here in St. Louis this past year and he did enjoy it, but when it comes to watching their shows, he enjoys the cartoons (I like the cartoons, too). I don't mind when they're live action on the dvd's, setting up the story or talking about it afterwards, and then the story is a cartoon. There's a story in that format, and my nephew really learns from those. There was a story with this one, but it really didn't stick with me. So, I just want to say that I was disappointed with this dvd, but that I look forward to future products from God Rocks.",1260662400,,977,4.015384615384615
8129183,4,B000G72T10,"I show these dvds at Sunday school for the kids. They are all well done and the kids love the music.  However,this particular episode did not have enought cartoon segments, and the kids were disappointed. They did enjoy the sketch with the pink poodle. That was very funny. This one had mostly music clips with the live actors; Okay, but not as great as the other ones.",1259280000,,369,4.507462686567164
8129184,5,B000G72T10,This story is about a rock who wishes to teach the Word of God to boys and girls all over the world.  In a dream he becomes human and gets to do just that!  It is a really great movie to teach kids of all ages to be themselves not to try to be someone else.  The music is great and so are the characters!,1237507200,,304,3.646153846153846
8129185,5,B000G72T10,"Our kids love God Rocks! With so many questionable role models out today, it is great to find some ""cool"" kids who care about what God thinks. Messages were easy to understand and relate to and were not too corny.",1214265600,,213,4.35
