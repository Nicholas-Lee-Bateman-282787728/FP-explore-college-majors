8555937,4,B00AQ590MS,"With 12 movies, there are bound to be a few clinkers and a few really good ones -- or something for everyone's tastes.  Heart - The Marilyn Bell Story and also  The Dionne Quints - which was a two-part movie (3-hours total) --  were unexpected hits! I was looking for movies for my elderly mom and she really got into the 1934 birth of the quints and all of what followed. And usually we need captioning for her to follow everything. There are no captions in this set of movies and still it was a success.",1513036800,,505,4.239583333333333
