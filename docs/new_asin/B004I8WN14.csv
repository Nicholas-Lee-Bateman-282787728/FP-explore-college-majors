4384452,3,B004I8WN14,"I feel that this second series of the anime was little bit more enjoyable than the first series. There isn't much difference between the two series. The few differences is that you get to see Moka little sister in this series and all she does is try to get Moka vampire form to come out and stay forever. Also, you get to see the parents of the other girls now too.

So besides the few differences in this shows than the last, it's pretty same thing . All it is, is Moka and Tsukune want to be together, but the problem is that there are so many other girls that want Tsukune too and the parents get in the way too now. Then add in a slight easy problem to fix in every show so that Moka can fix with her kick.

Moka still solving the problems at the end of every show with just a few kicks. Still really boring.  She does ""kicks"" because those are her only moves that show her pantis. If she punches people then you won't see her pantis, so she only kicks when she fights.

Fan service is great and all but there's just too much of it here still. It just boring so fast. Their skirts are way too short. It's like they are not wearing anything sometimes because you are always shown from below skirt level to see them.

There nothing else to say about this anime because that's it.

But...the spoiler alert....the second series just have Tsukune show some more power since he got some of Moka blood in him now. You will see this at the last show of the series. He not exactly human anymore but not a monster either. He just above a regular human.  He wants to be with the nice Moka more than her vampire self. He shows this by trying to get her a new rosario from her father.

Like I said before, this show was just tiny bit better than the first series. But still average overall anime.",1333756800,,1787,4.174418604651163
4384453,5,B004I8WN14,I bought the second season right after I finished the first.  I found that the second season had more fan service and a little more adult themes including full breasts.  I still enjoyed the stories and liked how the characters developed.  I finished it and searched for season 3 to no avail.  The ending if you can call it that seemed to be left unfinished and from what I could find the manga goes much farther into the characters giving them more depth.  I was surprised that there wasn't a third series in the works and several sites were waiting and emailing anyone they could for information.  I have never bought manga before but this series makes me want to give it a try just to see how it all ends.  I liked the show and would love a third season but I take what I can get.  It a good watch if you like fun and light hearted anime.,1332720000,9,840,4.20625
4384454,3,B004I8WN14,"As a fan of the manga I got this and season one at the same time and watched both of them.  While I mostly enjoyed it (especially the opening music number), there were so many things that did not make this season two, more like a filler between seasons like they did with Full Metal Panic.  While seeing Moka's sister was funny, and also was happy to see the Mothers of the girls episode and the season one return home episode (end of season one in the manga), i think they went too far off the story line with this season, mixing some of season one with the first 2 books of season two.  add to the fact that Ruby is regaled to a minor character status and the changes about the great seal situation just did not sit well with me (though I did enjoy watching inner moka trying to still be one of the group).  Then the ending really made no sense.

Still it gets at least a B- with over the top humor, and fan service of the first season.  Hopefully the producers will read some of these and make a real season 2 and stay more on the story of the manga (even if it gets darker).",1331769600,12,1078,4.085308056872038
4384455,5,B004I8WN14,"This season has a lot more fan service than the first one, so be prepared for that. At some points near the end it is borderline hentai...but I'm not complaining =P",1331683200,2,164,4.32258064516129
4384456,5,B004I8WN14,"The quality of this anime in both seasons is just beautiful, and I just LOVE this show.

Even though there isn't much of a long-term plot, and it's sort of redundant for him to act like he doesn't know who he wants yet when every episode involves him staring at Moka, I still think that the little adventures they have are extremely entertaining, and almost as hilarious as they are sexy.

This certainly isn't for anyone interested in an action or drama anime. Like the first installment of the show, it's very light and laid back, mostly focusing on little problems that can be solved with a hug and action scenes that mainly consist of panty shots.

If you're like me though (an enormously perverted 17 year old girl) who enjoys a nice laugh and cute anime girls, then you NEED this in your collection.",1328313600,4,805,4.537931034482758
4384457,1,B004I8WN14,"I am reviewing this as a biased person because I read the manga. I think that it's fair to do this because I really wish I would have noticed it before I went and purchased this. I was very disappointed with the first season due to how the characters where not developed due to very important scenarios being changed, moved around in the timeline or just outright left out. This season makes the last one seem like perfection in that area. I'm wondering if the people who created this even bothered to read the manga. It's like this was written by a 12 year old. Anyway, I think you get the picture. This anime will upset you if you have read the manga. Otherwise, If I was to merit it without taking the manga into consideration... I would give it about 3 stars. The previous background artwork has been improved and the music is good. Still, the characters are thin and the story is meh as it is. Fan service is a little over the top but whatever. I think that it is worth a view just not a purchase. Most definitely not worth a purchase if you liked the manga and were hoping to see the sweet action and character development.

Ok, so I have finally finished this trash. The anime has nothing to do at all with the manga and honestly, it is crap stupid and so full of fan service that it is pointless. Christ! I have always made it my point to purchase anime so that the market expands in the US but it seems as if recently garbage like this is what they think we want. This tripe deserves negative stars imho. One of the worst animes ever. No content, development or action. Just stupid panty shots. If you are 12 - 13 years old then this should be great material. What a waste of a decent manga.",1327536000,6,1700,4.2631578947368425
4384458,5,B004I8WN14,"If you like monsters, vampires and the mix between normal and abnormal life styles. Then you're going to love this anime. Rosario vampire does contains a lot fan service; however, the anime does contain some action and comedy in between. In conclusion, I love this anime. Period.",1327363200,8,279,4.957446808510638
4384459,5,B004I8WN14,I recently purchased season one of Rosario Vampire I must say Funimation did a great job in the dubbing and as far as season two its funnier well lets just say that its defiantly not for kids and at least in this season well no spoilers unlike inuyasha where it took 8+ seasons and two movies for the main carater to realize there feelings and that is all i am saying :) back on topic its the best series next to heavns lost property that funimation did thus far.,1324944000,2,463,4.213483146067416
4384460,4,B004I8WN14,"The package for the DVDs is unimpressive, it's a normal DVD case with two DVDs.  It has the little plastic divider for one DVD and the other sits like normal.  As stated in my last review if you you don't like to keep your extras (Slip Cover) than you can put this DVD into the box set of ""Season 1"".  The box ""Season 1"" came in works well to keep both seasons together.

The show is not censored, and not for kids.

Season two of a good anime kicks off with a family member coming into the main cast life to mix things up, and it kind of borderlines on incest.  It does not go over the top, but still present.  Season two picks up right where season one ended, and will end like normal anime ends, leaving you with no real closer for the main characters.

Season two has a lot more action than season one, but falls back on the tried and true anime love story formula.  That is, boy can never make up his mind but all the girls love him.  If you like that kind of anime this one is for you.  For some reason I like this kind of anime, it makes me laugh.  There is a lot of fan service, and this anime is not intended for children. There is nudity.

A lot of the monsters are really cool, and the animation is top notch.  I recommend you purchase this anime when it comes out.  Knowing Funimation and the quality of their anime I can recommend this before even getting the DVD set.

The color is good on the DVDs not to much background issues. The transfers are well done.  No problems with picture.  Sound is well done as well, The 5.1 sound, sounds better than most anime so no complaints.

At times the characters voices can be annoying, but nothing to write home about.  The dub for this anime is well done, and worth watching.  If you do not like dubs, the subtitles are there and from what I have seen match up well to the fan dubs.",1323216000,5,1838,4.121126760563381
4384461,4,B004I8WN14,"PROS:

Character designs and backgrounds are detailed, colorful and bright.  Everything usually remains on model.

Animation is a bit more consistent and less choppy than the first season.  Fewer footage recycling and shortcuts are used.

Art direction has more flair and variety than the first season.

Everybody in the dub cast gives a stellar performance.  The dub is accurate to the sub translation with some minor wording differences.

Sometimes succeeds at being very emotional and intense.

Main cast is very vibrant and likeable.  The protagonists receive a good amount of screen time.

The vocal songs and both the opening and ending songs are great.

All the in-show vocal songs were translated into English and song by voice actor of the corresponding character.

Captures the comedic aspects of the manga perfectly.  There is lots of breaking the fourth wall jokes, slapstick, raunchy humor, and overdramatic situations and reactions.  Season two is even funnier than the first.

Fight scene in episode 7 is a highlight of the season.

Great packaging.  The amaray case, slipcover, and discs have a matching beige and brown school motif.  Amaray case has interior artwork.

CONS AND YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY:

If you can't enjoy or look past fanservice and risqu humor very little of this show will appeal to you.

Often reuses the same gags.

The majority of the fight scenes are short and one-sided.

The shift between the comedic and serious is sometimes gradual and other times rapid.

It is an even looser adaptation of the manga than the first season.  It only adapts parts of chapters 1 and 3 of part two of the mannga and chapters 35, 39, and 37 of part one.

Season two features mostly original stories which results in several storyline changes and anime-only characters.  Some fans of the manga may feel the show takes far too many liberties.

Some of the characters are portrayed differently than their manga counterparts.

Even less violent and comedic in tone than the first season.

Even though the series has an ongoing story it might feel too episodic and repetitive for some viewers.

The non-vocal background music is fitting but ultimately forgettable.

The villains are one-dimensional and the protagonists sometimes come across as being too obsessed with their love interest.

Some instances where two characters are talking at once so the viewer has to put on subtitles in order to decipher what the other person said.

Students and faculty never seem to receive any disciplinary action despite constantly breaking school rules.

Extra features are extremely lacking in content.  There is no production art, no Japanese promotional commercials, no interviews with voice actors, and no audio commentary.  The only thing available is the textless versions of the opening and ending songs and a few trailers for other anime.",1323129600,6,2853,5.095238095238095

12 to 13 episodes for each season for 30 something bucks is a bit much if they're not gonna make a complete collection at least lower the price a bit maybe to like 26 dollars a piece even that's a lot but at least that's more acceptable then 34 dollars plus tax that goes with so your roughly spending 40 dollars for one season with only twelve episodes",1494633600,,488,4.191489361702128

4384487,5,B004I8WN14,"- Synopsis: The whacky situations and interactions between the only human and a school full of monsters continues. More monster girls arrive, as well as more enemies. Our main character has even more work cut-out for him on top of his increasing harem of monster girls. Tune in to see how this sequel to the first season plays out, as the ecchi scenes and silliness increases, as well.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: The plot is simple and further emphasizes this light-hearted anime loaded with plenty of fan-service. It doesn't have nudity, so it has moderate amounts of fan-service. Plenty of temptation and panty-shots, though. Not to mention monster waifus.

- Analysis: Though it's a work of fiction, there's still relevance in which humans can get along with other species. The most relatable example would be pet owners. Even though humans aren't related biologically to their pets, it doesn't prevent many of them from seeing their pets as being a part of their family. So, it would seem that many times, feelings can prove to be a strong influence, despite the differences that may be present.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subtitles. Includes all 13 episodes on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-MA due to some violence and sexual content.

- Conclusions: Overall, this is a fun and light-hearted anime to enjoy, especially if you like fan-service and monster girls. The situations are silly and the plot is simplistic. The girls are cute and evoke a warm feeling for the most part. Although, the main character gets teased and put in awkward situations, time and time again.

This sexy comedy continue to break the 4th wall with having the characters seem to know their in a TV show. by not over using this bit it remains interesting rather than getting on one nerves.

The frustrating thing about this however, is that there is no page to select episodes from--they're just one after the other. There are no extras or anything--which are always a plus, so I can't really fault anyone for that...not really, that is.

I'm a 23 year old bi-sexual female, and frankly I love this sort of harem anime. It has just the right mix of everything I'm looking for in this sort of series. There is plenty of fan service, but it's not excessive in my opinion... It feels right. It's also a very funny comedy series with hints of serious romantic interest (woven within layers of over the top moments that actually make fun of the entire romance genre). I also love the different characters and their personalities. And the main guy, it's so cute how naive and innocent he is... I think that's what makes everything so enjoyable, especially as a woman.

4384612,5,B004I8WN14,"the cast are back in the 2nd season with newer cast making an appearance , mostly kokoa is the finest addition in the cast and i find her adorable when she gets hot headed and doing mischief stuff from time to time  .

i still find that the 1st season has a more serious plot ( for what it has anyway ) , so i see that the 2nd season is full of funny moments and crazy unexpected episodes ( DAMN that yukari episode .... never saw that one coming  )  ,  and of course the fan service is tuned up heavily for more .... Ecchines i should say  .

for the most part i really enjoyed this season as well for its cracking up moments , ive even liked the cast even more  but  i still find the silver haired tough cookie moka the most sexy ( those serious eyes tho  ), as well that i adored her spicy sister kokoa .

diffidently  a great watch specially if you watched the 1st season .",1409616000,,877,3.9485714285714284

I love this anime great story once you get through all the fan service, lots of T & A sexual situations/innuendo nudity language would suggest 15 to 16 yrs old and up very funny and about acceptance of others which I think we need a lot more of today.  Lots of fun to watch you will be laughing like crazy there is a love story hidden in all the fan service and comedy but its well balanced so it doesn't seem to lovey dubby.

4384671,5,B004I8WN14,"A high school student's parents find a way for him to immediately start high school even though he'd failed his entry exam, but there is one problem... the private school they'd found an acceptance form for is only for monsters. In no time he has befriended a group of girls the only problem is each of them intends on becoming his girlfriend.

Season one... focuses on Tsukune and the girl's lives at Yokai academy and feels like a slice of life anime due to the season lacking an overarching narrative, but the season concludes with a great three part finale!

Season two... Tsukune and the girls are back at Yokai academy and a new student has a grudge against them. This season has an overarching narrative and concludes with another great three part finale!

The animation, characters, finales and English dub are amazing which is why this is one of my favorite animes!

Be warned that the series is not suitable for children due to all the fan service and if you're unfamiliar with the term then let me explain. Fan service means there are a lot of large jiggling breasts, revealing clothing, panty exposing character animations, poses and camera angles as well as brief nudity and strongly suggestive themes.",1363392000,2,1215,4.771428571428571

4384697,5,B004I8WN14,"Tsukune failed his entrance exam. Luckily he was able to get into 1 school. He finds out that it is a school for youkai (monsters). On the way to his new school he meets a vampire girl named Moka. She's very self conscious from living in the human world through middle school. She quickly begins to cling to Tsukune. He also manages to attract a succubus named Kurumu, a snow woman named Mizore, and a little witch named Yukari. All 3 of these cute girls are all about him and fight like crazy people to win his affection. The problem he faces is his humanity. If he is discovered to be human he will be killed. The only other person that knows is Moka, but Moka is loving and loyal enough to keep his secret.

This season begins with all the characters going back for 2nd year. This time Tsukune meets Moka's sister, Kokoa, on his way to school. She's a feisty brat, and she's determined to remove Moka's seal and get her ""real"" sister back. There are also 2 episodes that involve Kurumu and Mizore's mothers. There just older versions of their daughters.

There is a descent amount of nudity in this season, unlike the 1st. So it's probably more of an R rating. There is not much of a difference as far as the animation and flow of the series is concerned. Thankfully, all of the voice actors have returned. I think they do a good job. I have seen rumors of a 3rd season, and I hope they are true. At the end of this season Moka tells Tsukune that he will be having to choose one of the girls very soon. That leads me to believe that a 3rd is likely. The popularity of this anime in Japan is also very large.

Overall this is a great harem anime with cool characters and lots of laughs. I really enjoyed it and I hope you do too!",1350518400,7,1731,4.239393939393939
