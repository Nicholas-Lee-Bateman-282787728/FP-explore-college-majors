8123366,2,B000FII2A2,"Firstly,  I am more interested in videos that capture the responsex from worship or praise services, especially those that are held in churches.  Those performances of the same kind that are held in theaters are secondly acceptable.  In studios and related areas, I am hard to please, but its not impossible.  If you have godpel videos expressed in the above criteria, whether they be DVD's or VHS's, I would be interested in them. I like live performances.
  Note!  I do not like the modern gospel videos when the performers appear and dissapear, here and there, jumping all over the country in various scenes.  I'm sorry it took me so long to reply.  I am not very efficient on these things.",1427155200,,693,4.708333333333333
8123367,5,B000FII2A2,So thrilled to have found these old favorites in CD form.  Cleveland was my favorite gospel artist back in his day.  His songs are so deeply down to earth--and such a good  reverence to God and His works.  Good clear singing on this CD.,1387411200,,236,4.295454545454546
8123368,5,B000FII2A2,I was raised in the Baptist Church so this type of music makes my day. I put some of the music on my Mp3 player and listen when I am at the gym. How sweet it is.,1382140800,,161,3.3783783783783785
8123369,1,B000FII2A2,"when you buy anyone's dvd's/cd's, you expect the majority of the songs to be performed by them not some choir that you never heard of so it is a great disappointment----  the bottom line is that if the dvd or cd has a well-known singer on the cover then the songs should be performed by them",1254700800,5,291,4.196428571428571
8123370,3,B000FII2A2,"I'm a bit puzzled here. There is a bit of James Cleveland on here. But it's stuff I already have. Then there are performances of the choirs with him directing. If that's alright with you, I guess it's alright. But, I need more of James.",1191974400,6,236,4.266666666666667
