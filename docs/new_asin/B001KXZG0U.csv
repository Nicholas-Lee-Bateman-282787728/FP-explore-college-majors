8316511,5,B001KXZG0U,"The series itself is really amazing. If you like action, adventure and fantasy then you'll love this !! I remember the 2006 original japanese release for this anime and how I watched it from begining to end. I even remember when they first featured it on toonami jetstream and how good the dub was. The only unfortunate matter in my case is that while collection 2 floats around like a cloud in the sky collection 1 is extremely hard to find. I know the time to probably get it was back when it was released in 2009 but heck it took me 8 years till I got my hands on buso renkin. I know its unlikely it will pop up but I do hope that collection 1 surfaces again someday (:",1436140800,,672,4.137404580152672

8316513,5,B001KXZG0U,"I would recommend this to anyone who likes anime action and adventures. It has a pokemon kind of feel to it, but instead of capturing pokemon, you are born with a monster spirit. The animation is really visually striking.  I personally like the Japanese voice acting better than the american. But that is just my opinion. I don't want to spoil the show, it really is a great anime that not a lot of people know about. It deserves more attention then it gets. The music is really great! I cant even explain it, but when something really great happens in the show you can just feel the excitement through the music. I wish I could get the sound track hehe.

Anyway- All of these quick summaries describe the themes of this anime: countries at war, cool looking spirits, action and adventure, ""finding ones destiny"", slice of life, the meaning of friendship, and what one would do to keep that friendship. WATCH IT!",1348617600,,912,4.588957055214724
