2255240,4,B0007ZSNPW,"Carol has made some wonderful programs for people looking to strengthen your body,gain balance and to also improve posture, these DVD's are excellent just for that. Carol also did a Ti-Chi DVD before these and it is also a very good program to try. She is an excellent instructor. Try her DVD's you will love them, especially if you are into water exercises.",1311206400,,358,4.698412698412699
2255241,4,B0007ZSNPW,"I have had this DVD for about a year now. The first several times that I watched it, I found it hard to follow because in several of the routines, the voice directions didn't correspond with what was on the screen, and it was confusing. But I liked the routine, and kept doing it. I've learned where the differences are and make my own adjustments. I have about 5 other aquatic DVDs but this is the one I use the most - at least 5x a week. And I am getting results. At my last physical, I actually increased my height by a 1/2 inch (after a 2 inch loss over the past 10 years). I credit it to the lengthening aspects of water pilates. I hope Carol does another water pilates DVD with new routines and with attention to direction and video. I would stand in line to buy it.",1298592000,9,772,4.119205298013245
2255242,5,B0007ZSNPW,"Wonderful Exercises in the Pool

I can wholeheartedly recommend the Water Pilates DVD!  After the knee replacement surgery on my left leg, I used these exercises to help me increase my strength and coordination.  My right leg (or non-surgical leg) still has a great deal of arthritis.  I also use these exercises to  keep the pain level bearable in that leg.
I learned so much about the precise movements and philosophy behind the workouts.  Moreover, Ms. Argo demonstrates all the activities in such a graceful manner.  Very helpful and enjoyable.",1287792000,,548,5.022222222222222
2255243,4,B0007ZSNPW,"I wish we could all be as graceful as the ladies doing the exercises!  They look great!  The underwater camera makes the movements easy to follow. I have done similar water exercises and have found they have been of great benefit.  I am an old lady of 86 and have had no difficulty with them; if I can do them anyone can.

Carol Argo is an excellent teacher.  I like the way she uses imagery and explains the purpose of each exercise.  There are a few technical difficulties with the filming and editing.  I believe these are minor and could be easily corrected.  They do not detract from the content, in my opinion.  Overall, it is a very good training film and should be in inspiration for us all to get in the water and start moving.",1286150400,3,736,4.313868613138686
2255244,1,B0007ZSNPW,"This was a slow, poorly 'shot' video.  I realize it is water aerobics and is hard to get good video shots of the actual exercise, but this Carol Argo lady seems to be a knot on a log.  I need Denise Austin or Leslie Sansone to teach me Water Aerobics.  I rented it from my Library and am very happy to know that I didn't have to fork over any $$ for this lame, boring video.",1279756800,2,374,3.8947368421052633
2255245,5,B0007ZSNPW,"I was introduced to Water Pilates by a talented fitness professional Carol Argo. The DVD is well planned, easy to follow, allows to work with all body parts. I feel very energized and rejuvenated after doing the water Pilates with Carol. It is very convinient to exercise under Carol's guidence, can be easily done at home if you have a pool or in the public pool after you memorize the movements. The DVD has a great music selection, very well balanced and it is fun. My mother, 73 years old lady, enjoys the Water pilates as well, exercising at her appartment's pool and many other ladies ofter join her. Thank you, Carol, very much. Our bodies and minds love your work! We are looking forward to your new creative masterpieces.",1269648000,,730,4.623076923076923
2255246,5,B0007ZSNPW,"This is an excellent DVD for someone looking for a Pilates workout in their own pool.  The visual production is outstanding and movements used in the routine are simple to learn and easy to memorize for self directed water workouts.  As a fitness educator, I can testify that the standing Pilates movements feature balance and strength work that demands challenging core stability. I love the noodle exercises because they add a great deal of variety to the workout. I use Carol's moves in my classes all the time.  Most people simply do not realize that they can do Pilates exercises in their pool.  This is a creative and enjoyable workout and all you need is a noodle, a relaxing music CD and a pool!",1266710400,2,703,4.645161290322581
2255247,4,B0007ZSNPW,"I thought the routine and choreography were well planned and thought out.  I especially like the underwater photography so that you could see what you were doing.  Land-based pilates is hard for me so when I discovered it could be done in the water, I was really excited.  This is a great workout for me!",1265760000,,304,4.490909090909091
2255248,4,B0007ZSNPW,"As an instructor and trainer of twenty years I was impressed with her Water Plates DVD. It was educational and has added a wide variety of fresh new movements to my routine. When introduced it to the class, they all loved it!",1265414400,5,225,4.380952380952381
2255249,3,B0007ZSNPW,"I found the voice was not coordinated with the picture.  She was moving her mouth, but it wasn't in sync with the audio.  This was very distracting.  Also, there was too long a pause between exercises and the screen was completely black during this time.  Music or just water pictures would have been better.  The movements in the water used an under water camera for each exercise and this was helpful.  It looked challenging and I found I will try this form of water pilates.",1171670400,16,477,4.552941176470588
2255250,1,B0007ZSNPW,"This was completely useless. I had read other people's reviews but I thought I would try it anyway. That was a mistake. My friend bought the Peyow Aqua Pilates instead, which she let me borrow and I found that it was very useful and well done.",1425513600,,243,4.304347826086956

2255254,5,B0007ZSNPW,I viewed the DVD a couple of times and I used the CD to download to my Ipod and use at the pool.  I have knee problems and wanted a low impact way to exercise and become more flexible and mobile.  Excellent.  Whole-heartedly recommend!,1374451200,13,235,4.295454545454546

2255256,5,B0007ZSNPW,I recently became a shallow water teacher in our city and had no training.  I was so glad this video helped me - especially with some Pilates stretches.  The ladies love them.  The video was very easy to follow - covered lots of parts of the body.  Thank-you@,1361577600,,259,4.333333333333333
2255257,5,B0007ZSNPW,"I have done Pilates for years and just love it.  When we put in our new pool, I started thinking about what exercises I could do in the pool.  After researching, I found this DVD and CD.  I think it is great.  Carol's instructions are very clear, you can just shut your eyes and follow along.  I like the music and the pace of the workout. I reviewed the DVD first, and then just took a portable CD player to the pool and had a great workout! If you have a laptop, you can set that up poolside and view the workout.  I definitely plan to order more of her water workouts.",1345680000,10,571,4.053571428571429

Today the temperature was zero outside while we enjoyed exercising to Carol's CD inside.  Thanks, Carol!",1326844800,7,269,4.680851063829787
2255259,5,B0007ZSNPW,"Carol Argos instructional CD is easy to follow, calming to hear, and very beneficial. Our small class meets 5 days a week and have not tired of the routine, rather we find something ""new""  occasionally which we swear we never heard before.  I just ordered the Water Yoga cd to ADD to our daily class. We find that after the 53 minute workout, we don't want to leave the pool!  Thank you Carol for this great way to start the morning!",1326844800,11,433,4.320987654320987

8054985,5,B0007ZSNPW,"Bought this for a friend that finished cancer treatment not too long ago. Her joints were very affected by treatment, so working out in water is her only option. She used to do pilates before, so learning to do it in water is just what she needs now. DVD and CD arrived very, very fast and I was able to gift it for Christmas.",1484179200,,326,4.109375
8054986,4,B0007ZSNPW,A good work out.  The video helps with doing the exercises correctly.  The audio is loud enough to hear it while you are in the pool.,1469664000,,133,4.076923076923077

8054989,5,B0007ZSNPW,"Wasnt sure what to expect but i needed something to use in the pool and could not find a water aerobics program that fit my schedule.  If you can put your tv/player/laptop next to the pool the dvd is great, but i could not do that a the public pool here so after watching the dvd and making a few notes i ripped and downloaded the cd to my phone.  I keep my phone in a waterproof holder (a freezer bag would work just as well) and before you know it an hour has passed.  The work out is hard enough for a beginner like me but for a real gym rat it probably would be to easy. Now i am looking for cheap waterproof bluetooth ear buds.",1449705600,8,632,3.921875

8054991,5,B0007ZSNPW,"As an aquatic exercise instructor, I was skeptical that this DVD would offer something different and not be a repetition of other water pilates workouts. Although the names of some of the segments are the same as other DVD workouts, Carol Argo takes them to different levels in the speed and execution. My exercise participants have fully embraced this workout which complements the other two pilates workouts that I offer.",1437609600,8,423,5.057142857142857
8054992,4,B0007ZSNPW,"Was easy to watch, with good pacing, gentle music and good instruction.  Mostly leg work and core( as Pilates is focused on), perhaps more exercises or suggestions about upper body, back neck and shoulders.  Can't be everything.  We worth the price with many exercises that I have used in pool work.",1436313600,2,299,4.823529411764706
