2640195,5,B000HRMAL8,"Great workout with individual choices for everyobody, great for beginners and experienced people",1169078400,8,96,6.461538461538462
2640196,5,B000HRMAL8,"I order this dvd to add to my workouts. I love the power walks, the music could be a little better but it will still get your heart pumping. GIVE IT A TRY!",1394496000,,155,3.727272727272727
2640197,4,B000HRMAL8,"This is a very good workout.  It's not difficult, but it is challenging.  It really keeps you moving.  I've had the DVD for a couple of months and I use it alternately with my other fitness DVDs.",1365292800,,195,4.216216216216216
2640198,4,B000HRMAL8,I needed another DVD on a walking routine for my cardio exercises.  Even though I am 88 I found this movie very useful and easy to follow.,1286323200,5,138,4.111111111111111
2640199,4,B000HRMAL8,"I am easing back into exercising and I have tried some other at home walking videos as in Arizona, it is too hot to walk during anytime of the day in the summer.  I have tried Leslie Sansome and can only do her workouts a few times before I get bored.  This workout however was a nice change of pace as Chris Freytag is great and she incorporates a lot more movement than Leslie does.  There are three styles you can follow: Cardio, Body Shaping, and Accelerated (I believe).  I am currently doing the Cardio section and I just love it!  I get more variety and Chris is very motivating.  There is some high impact jumping but I was able to easily do my own low impact modifications.  Overall, this is a great DVD to help facilitate a workout regimen.  I would have given it five stars if she had more mileage options for the cardio section (ex: 2 or 5 mile walk).  I recommend it!",1284076800,,880,4.253012048192771
2640200,4,B000HRMAL8,"I wanted to give this 5 stars. I really really did. There are 3 workouts to chose from. Accelerated, Body shaping and Cardio - or ABC as the instructor puts it.
Workout B & C are awesome. Love them. Fun and sweaty. About 25 minutes with warm up and cool down. The B workout uses weights. There are 4 weight-using sections. So you do cardio, then 1 minute of weights, then back to cardio. It's really good. Workout C, or Cardio, is basically just a walking/marching/kicking/with some fancy footwork. Stick to it, you'll pick it up in a few minutes. Then you feel pretty smart.
Ok, here is why I took off a star. I don't like The Firm workouts. I'm not that coordinated. I don't want to dance myself fit in a choreographied workout. I just want an effective, minimal brain function exercise. I have other things to think about then if I'm going to twist my knee out of socket because I can't do the jumping, twisting, fancy steps. That's just me. You may like that kind of thing, in which case you should do workout A, the Accelerated Workout.
It wasn't fun, for me. I don't want to spend my precious workout time trying to learn fancy dance steps. I have limited space, limited time. So, I just skip this one. I hope I don't sound bitter, but it was disappointing. Afterall, this is a ""WALK yourself fit"", not a ""crazy dancy, fancy-moves yourself fit"". so there!
I have done B & C workouts several time and I like it!! I like Chris Freytag a lot and I'll keep buying her dvds. She's good at what she does.
Oh, the back up exercisers are good too. All sorts of ages and body shapes. I aspire to the wonky, jivey workout of the skinny girl to Chris's left but know I can keep up better than the little girl on her right. :D Lots of motivation.
It's a fun workout and I'm glad I bought it.",1279584000,9,1785,4.284023668639053
2640201,5,B000HRMAL8,"I love Chris Freytag, she is upbeat without killing you.  But you definitely get a great workout.  Probably not for the more advanced, but great for beginners.  It is a wonderful all around workout.",1277769600,2,198,4.764705882352941
2640202,4,B000HRMAL8,A well put together program that provides the low impact instruction you would expect with hosts that aren't terribly annoying.,1269907200,,127,5.4
2640203,4,B000HRMAL8,"I loved this DVD. As an avid exerciser, the pace was great, the instructor is peppy, and encouraging, and the moves are easy to follow. If you are a fan of Leslie Sansone....this is a good alternative to add to your collection. There are 3 workouts, which you can mix and match as you desire.
Be aware of two things.....1) This Dvd is a remake, and is sold under the title of ""Ultimate Walking Workout"", also by Prevention. Although there is a year's difference in the publishing....I assure you....it's the same Dvd. 2)This dvd comes with an audio cd as well. I did not enjoy the music...and the instruction on it, is minimal, at best.",1262908800,3,636,4.539130434782609
2640204,5,B000HRMAL8,"This is a great DVD easy to follow, you work up a good sweat quick.  A nice addition to my DVD's My wife loves it!",1258588800,,114,3.56
2640205,5,B000HRMAL8,"By complete chance, I received a different Prevention walking work-out video with this personal trainer, Chris Freytag, in the mail.  I don't really use a lot of DVDs and videos to exercise, but I decided to try the one I got (Two-Week Cardio fitness through walking), since I couldn't get outside and my week-end was running out.  Based on this, I am totally impressed with the work-outs she does, that are fun and fast and also caring/attentive to the body.  I hope to continue to use the one I have when I can't get outside to walk.  It was really great, and she is really pleasant to follow.",1245628800,,595,4.481481481481482
2640212,3,B000HRMAL8,"it is more cardio, the routines will get you heart going. Her cues aren't perfect but she goes through everything enough times that you pick it right up. I bought this along with Drop it in 30 in 2007, my only major complaint is her warm up does not correspond to the muscle work out and her cool down is horrible on both DVD's",1243468800,2,327,4.125
2640213,5,B000HRMAL8,"This is an easy tape to follow.  The music is good and the instructor is great.  If you like ""Walk Away The Pounds"" you might like this.  I highly
recommend this tape.",1240790400,2,167,4.15625
2640214,4,B000HRMAL8,"I like Chris and the program is energetic.  However, there are some areas where I need clearer instructions and a little more time to learn the steps that are more ""dance-like"".  My favorite is the walk with weights.",1236556800,,216,4.657894736842105
2640215,5,B000HRMAL8,"I really like this workout, as I do all Chris Freytag's tapes.
I wanted another workout DVD that was low impact, as I am 9 months pregnant and have worked out before and all during my pregnancy.  This is great for being pregnant and even when you aren't.  I will continue to use this afterwards.  There are 3 different workouts, but they are very similar.  I usually do 2 workouts in one day, which equals about 40 minutes.  She, like usual, makes everything fun and unique.  The time flies by and you will actually enjoy it.",1221091200,,525,4.416666666666667
2640216,5,B000HRMAL8,"try this dvd. you have different options, so you can mix and match creating a great workout, great feeling afterward.",1213228800,,117,4.9
2640217,5,B000HRMAL8,"The first time through it is a bit complicated because her moves are new and interesting...but the second time through the workout I had the hang of it and it was actually fun and energizing. I'm already pretty fit and this workout is actually toning me even more, so it is great for beginners (which I would say will def. see results and fast) and it is still beneficial and fun for people who are already fit!...I would recommend this video for anyone who is looking for a new and fun workout!!",1208044800,,496,4.4021739130434785
2640218,3,B000HRMAL8,"You will get a decent workout from this DVD but it's not one of my favorites. It's more aerobic than Leslie Sansone's WOTPs series which I really like. However, the choreography is a little challenging and her queuing is not the best. It's broken into three sections that you can choose from. There is an accelerated cardio, regular cardio, and body sculpting segment. However, there is only 3 minutes difference between the accelerated cardio (25 minutes) and the regular cardio (28 minutes). The body sculpting segment isn't bad but almost as soon as you put down the weights she asks you to pick them up again. This happens multiple times throughout the 24 minute segment. Another exercise she loves is lunges so if you aren't into lunges you might want to stay away from Chris Freytag workouts. I would recommend Walk Your Way Slim with Michelle Dozios and Get Moving, Walking for Weight Loss with Madeleine Lewis. Both of these are excellent. They are both on the same aerobic level as this workout but I like them far more. Walking for Weight Loss with Madeleine Lewis has toning sections that I found to be much better than Chris Freytag's. If you don't want any toning with weights then Walk Your Way Slim with Michelle Dozios would be a good choice. Overall, it's not a bad workout which is why I gave it 3 stars but the other two DVDs that I mentioned are 5 star workouts in my opinion.",1207267200,35,1396,4.610441767068273
2640219,5,B000HRMAL8,"I love this tape as well, I do this on a regular basis as well.  Easy to follow and a good workout.  Would be good pretty much anyone.",1203292800,,134,3.75
2640220,5,B000HRMAL8,"This is, by far, my favorite workout DVD.  It is fun and Chris Freytag makes it easy to follow.  The cardio workout provides a good sweat and a great workout.  The body shaping workout is tough but doable.  I love the way these workouts made me feel and the sense of accomplishment keeping up and sticking with it really feels.  This is a great DVD for all levels of fitness.",1202860800,3,375,4.3
2640221,4,B000HRMAL8,I haven't done a DVD workout before and found the moves a bit complicated at first but after doing the workout 4 times I've got the hang of most of them. I find the warm-up and cool-down stretch really good. It's paced nicely and keeps me moving longer than I would if I was just walking around my living room! :) And the variety of movements keeps it interesting and challenging. I'll be looking to try out other Prevention workout DVDs in the future.,1200441600,,452,4.392857142857143
2640222,4,B000HRMAL8,"I have several of the Prevention Fitness series CDs and love all of them. They are easy to do, short, and fun.",1194393600,,110,4.045454545454546
2640223,5,B000HRMAL8,"I really like ""walking"" exercise DVD's and have purchased quite a few over the years. This is the best one I've purchased to date!  The routines are not too hard, they're fun and easy to follow.  Chris Freytag is very likeable and explains each move before she does it.",1193356800,3,269,4.469387755102041
2640224,5,B000HRMAL8,"Great for light days.  Chris is refreshing and upbeat, not annoying, overbearing,a disoriented cheerleader or obnoxious.  Toning segments work both sides evenly, which seems a rarity in the workout dvd market.  Cuing is much better than most of the others out there, even with the fact that there are a couple of spots that she misses.  I am becoming more of a fan of the Prevention Systems DVDs the more of them that I get.  Every level of fitness will enjoy this.  3 Different workouts.  All include a warm up and a cool down.  Really like the fact that the warm ups don't include trying to stretch cold muscles, as with many of the other dvds out there, as well as the fact that they don't drag the warm up out.  Short and simple.",1189382400,14,733,4.41044776119403
2640225,4,B000HRMAL8,"I've been trying to get in shape and I've gotten tired of Denise Austin, so I read about this and decided to give it a try. The 3 workouts are pretty much the same with a few different moves, but honestly, it's fun. Chris is a great instructor- encouraging without being fake/cheesy (ala Denise). I like how she gives you the heads up on mile markers, which makes it really motivating I think. Prevention did a great job including a workout plan (to firm up, lose weight, blast off a plateau and to get fit), plus a few other extras. I haven't listened to the included CD but I assume it's good.",1186531200,5,595,4.321428571428571
2640226,3,B000HRMAL8,I have bought several exercise tapes through Prevention.  I have not liked any of them.  The moves are not smooth or go together well.  I usually end up with some injury after I have done one of Chris' tapes especially the knees.  She tries to be different but it doesn't work.  There are too many other good dvd's out there without wasting your time and money on Prevention's!  This is not a walking tape like most walking tapes where you stay in one place.  It is more of an overall workout.,1185235200,15,493,4.351648351648351
2640227,5,B000HRMAL8,"Another good offering from Prevention.  Easy to follow.  Excellent instructor; I very much like Chris Freytag and all of her exercise programs.  Potential buyers should note that this program goes beyond a basic walking program for users who want to add more complex moves and have a more complete aerobic workout.  For those who want simple walking routines, stick to Leslie Sansone programs. If you want more than that, this is a great choice.",1181606400,12,445,4.972972972972973
2640228,1,B000HRMAL8,This is terrible to follow.  She changes steps with little or no warning!  She doesn't describe what is coming up and the steps change so fast that there would seem to be no benefit from it!  The music is dull and annoying and I don't like looking at her belly button for the whole work out.,1180569600,20,291,4.160714285714286
2640229,5,B000HRMAL8,"I did not buy this DVD, it was a free gift from Prevention when I subscribed to their magazine. I was a little skeptical at first, but when I tried it, I loved it. The cardio and the accelerated routines get your heart going! I use this DVD to get my heartrate up and then I jump on my treadmill for 60 minutes. I would highly recommend this DVD to someone who wants to start working out, but does know where to start. It has quick routines and is very easy to follow. If you can walk, then you can do it!",1179878400,4,505,3.9607843137254903
2640230,1,B000HRMAL8,Not enough time walking.  I thought this would be walk aerobics.  Instead it is only 20 minutes of walking.  Also no proper warmup and cool down.,1178409600,19,145,4.5
2640231,5,B000HRMAL8,"This dvd is wonderful.  You will not be bored.  The moves are different and the video is fast-paced.  Chris Freytag is fantastic and her programs really work.  Do not be afraid to order this one and ""Drop It in 30"".  They are both great and well worth the cost.",1175731200,8,261,4.244897959183674
8140870,1,B000HRMAL8,NOT for beginners. NOT instructional. Assumes you already know the different steps and exercises. Leads routines but does not teach you how to do them. Leslie Sansone is much better.,1510012800,,182,5.1
8140871,5,B000HRMAL8,"I find myself easily motivated to do these fitness programs when weather just doesn't permit walking outside. There are several programs of different intensity, one with weights for toning.  I have other DVD's by Chris Freytag and I think she is wonderful.",1500940800,,256,5.095238095238095
8140872,2,B000HRMAL8,"Unfortunately, this is the same dvd as Preventions Ultimate Walking Workout.  You would think that somewhere in the description it would state that it was previously packaged under a different name.  The ONLY difference is that in one section the clothes are different on the participants.  In one video she has and 'accelerated walk' which on the other dvd is called 'cardio walk'. Same workout, same people etc.  I am really angry about this.  In and of it self they aren't bad workouts, the walking is varied and not boring like some of these walks can be.  On the other hand, all participants are young and only one looks like she has any body fat whatsoever.  There are no modifications demonstrated, or even suggested.  I would not recommend this video on because of these issues. It seems like a shady practice IMO.  I plain to write the same review for the other video.",1486857600,2,877,4.6797385620915035
8140873,4,B000HRMAL8,Awesome,1458086400,,7,7.0
8140874,5,B000HRMAL8,great.,1437696000,,6,6.0
8140875,2,B000HRMAL8,"Very disappointed in this dvd.  I bought it to add to my collection of Walk Away the Pounds workouts.  The people do not seem very excited at all.  There is a lady on the front row who when she raises her arms, you can see a ""5 o'clock shadow"" on her underarms.  It just does not have the same feel as the series I'm used to.",1430784000,,325,3.878787878787879
8140876,4,B000HRMAL8,I am a Freytag fan so I had no doubt I would like her video.  The three sets of video routines were easy to learn.  I would have liked to be able to pass up the warm up sessions if I were to do all three sessions at the same time.  They come automatically before each 20 minute routine.  I liked that one routine included using weights with cardio  in short bursts.,1412640000,,365,4.013888888888889

8140878,2,B000HRMAL8,"I love Chris and enjoy most of her workouts but this one not so much. I wanted it because I need to go lighter with my workouts and figured indoor walking would be great. She really doesn't spend much time actually walking. If you want a light aerobic workout then this might be good but if you are looking for walking, I suggest Leslie Sansone!",1398470400,2,345,4.323076923076923
