8238789,5,B0010WDMXO,Great workout and music. A comprehensive body workout.,1458345600,,54,5.875
8238790,5,B0010WDMXO,This is an excellent workout video for use with a rebounder.  It has a variety of movements and exercises the whole body.  I recommend it.,1429056000,2,138,4.48
8238791,5,B0010WDMXO,"I ordered this from Amazon. I have 4 other rebounding videos, which I like, but I find the music and moves get very boring. One reviewer said the music was dated...I guess I'm dated... I love the music. In the 35 minute aerobics part it starts with Dixieland, goes into ragtime, old 1920's sounding jazz, African, Merengue, Italy, Polka, Celtic, crazy circus music, Calypso, Hoedown, Russian or Eastern European, and music where you imagine Charlie Chaplin, or Buster Keaton getting chased. The music was great sport and very energetic. I was looking for something different and this is it.

I forgot to say that this program is very aerobic, and is great for posture. The last aerobic push at the end of the video is super energetic with high kicks, which I found somewhat scarey as I am 60. (Don't want to fly off and get hurt. Takes too long to recover at this age). I modified it but stayed aerobic. Bouncing with light hand weights was very challenging... The instructors were perfect! Still doing this video and loving it!
  Actually been doing this workout, and the aerobics part is longer than 35 min. About 41 min. I feel so good after I do this.",1420416000,11,1155,4.624390243902439
8238792,3,B0010WDMXO,Good workout but a bit out dated.,1411948800,,33,3.857142857142857
8238793,5,B0010WDMXO,"I have the girls Bellicon workout & while many of the moves are similar, the workouts are not the same. This workout is fun & challenging. There is a short warm-up/core section, a long rebounding section and then a cool down/ stretch. As with the other DVD, they use arm weights for a portion to make a true total workout. The menu allows you to pick where to begin which I always like.",1380844800,11,386,4.301369863013699
8238794,4,B0010WDMXO,"This is a great workout. The combination of pilates and rebounding is a stroke of genius. The only problem is that the music, is pretty dated. Good idea though, please release another workout with better music, better themes, and perhaps a short workout included for days when you can't devote an hour to cardiolates.",1261958400,14,317,4.888888888888889
