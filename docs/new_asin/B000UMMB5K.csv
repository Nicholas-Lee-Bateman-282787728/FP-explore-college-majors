8213866,5,B000UMMB5K,"AB is the best! I found the packaging a little confusing, each disk has three full episodes (each recipe in that episode is listed on the package)",1455667200,,146,4.444444444444445
8213867,5,B000UMMB5K,"""Kitchen Classics"" is another great ""Good Eats"" DVD set. Alton Brown is both brainy and creative, and this show is like no other cooking show in history. Here Alton offers his quirky takes on classics such as spinach salad, stew, sub sandwiches, and ice cream explaining not only how to make tasty variations of these dishes, but also the history of the dishes and ingredients, and the chemistry behind why the recipes add up to good eats. My favorite episode in the set is ""Coconut Cake Revival"" which taught me more about both coconut and cake than I had ever learned elsewhere. Oddball comedy is omnipresent as in all episodes of ""Good Eats,"" and Beatles fans will especially enjoy the episode ""Major Pepper.""

This is an outstanding collection.",1419379200,5,748,4.84375

8213870,4,B000UMMB5K,"I'd never heard of Alton Brown until a friend recommended the program - there were several dvds to choose from and this is one of the three I chose randomly.  I am quite satisfied with this purchase.  Even though the acting/skit part I find too much, it is worth tolerating because of the great content.  The history behind the food is fascinating and the recipes are wonderfully explained.",1321228800,2,390,4.705882352941177
