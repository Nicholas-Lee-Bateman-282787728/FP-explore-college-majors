7894009,5,6305743762,"Master story teller and mythologist Joseph Campbell takes us through the complex world of Kundalini Yoga. Campbell believes that the purpose of Kundalini is to translate the earthly experience into a spiritual exercise for union with the Divine.
  Step by step, Campbell guides you through the symbology and meaning of the seven chakras of Kundalini that leads one to illumination. You see how each chakra interweaves with the other in enabling a person to come to higher levels of Divine understanding. Each chakra is a vehicle  in which to engage the spiritual.
  Joseph Campbell takes a complex subject and makes it accessible and understandable to those interested in Eastern religion, particularly Hinduism. His sense of humor is a delight and our host , Susan Sarandon, does an outstanding job in summarizing his thoughts after each lecture. This is a ""must have"" video for anyone interested in eastern religion in general and Kundalini in particular.",986169600,,957,5.188311688311688
