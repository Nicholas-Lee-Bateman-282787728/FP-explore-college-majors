8208250,2,B000T9D6F8,Didn't seem as interesting-- focused more on food than places --thought it would be different than it was-more like what I usually see on tv,1379808000,,140,4.64
8208251,3,B000T9D6F8,"Rick Steves is a legend. His travel shows can make even the most boring city or country seem interesting. Unfortunately, he doesn't do the Far East. Hong Kong is one of my favorite cities. I decided to purchase this DVD. It wasn't awful, but it could've been better.

The Hong Kong episode included a ride on the Victoria Peak Tram and the Star Ferry. It also showed Rudy going to a horse racing event and the Maritime Museum. I didn't feel this episode- it felt rushed. Even Samantha Brown's Hong Kong episode was better than this.

I couldn't care less about Shanghai, but just to justify purchasing this DVD, I also watched the Shanghai episode. It was slightly better than the Hong Kong episode. I learned that Shanghai has 20 million people. It's so large, yet it's not as popular as New York, London, or Paris (Shanghai has more residents than those three cities combined). It has an impressive skyline. At night, it looks like Times Square. Rudy visited the riverfront, the Yuyuan Bazaar, a dumpling shop, the Shanghai Museum, and an acrobatic show. He then took a side trip to Suzhou, which has nice gardens, and Zhouzhuang, which looked like Venice.

Rick Steves, PLEASE do some shows in China and Japan.",1374969600,,1213,4.712264150943396
8208252,3,B000T9D6F8,"I liked the episodes, but there were 2, and they were half and hour long! Rudy shows you several nice places to visit, but if theres only 2 episodes, so you'd think they would be much longer, and more informative! This was kinda backround noise for me, if there was something interesting, id look up, but mostly it wasn't too informative. Samantha covered Hong kong, and it was 45 minutes, and showed more than this, so I would go with her Aisan set, plus it has other countries like Malaysia, Japan, Thailand, ect.",1305244800,,515,4.548387096774194
8208253,2,B000T9D6F8,"This is a very disappointing DVD. It is short, and not only does it only include the 2 cities, but the coverage of those is very brief. The narration is all right but just didn't inspire me as much as others such as Rick Steves accomplish. At the end of the video my reaction was ""that's it?"". Very unsatisfying. And where is Beijing? How can a trip to China called ""China to the MAX"" not include the place of the Forbidden City, among other reasons. And if you want the Great Wall, forget about it. Yes, I know the ""max"" is a play on words - but you really realize how lame it is after you watch this video and realize what a minimal tour of China you just got. I'm not a huge fan of Samantha Brown, a little too ""perky"" and stereotypical American for my tastes, however, her China episodes left me feeling a lot more satisfied than this video. Take a pass on this.",1243036800,5,866,4.191616766467066
8208254,4,B000T9D6F8,"Quality is the usual Rudy Maxxa as is the target. When Globe Trekker targets the backpacker Rudy targets the people with more money wanting more luxery. Different strokes for different folks.

My biggest problem with this video is it only covers two cities and one I have no interest in. Considering it's called China to the Max you'd think it would get more than 30 feet off the coast.

What I'd like to see is Beijing to the Max, Sichuan to the Max, Guangxi to the Max etc...

Overall one of the better China travel Videos",1210636800,,524,4.4375
8208255,5,B000T9D6F8,A clear look at Shanghai and Hong Kong so you know what to expect when you visit.,1203292800,7,81,3.823529411764706
