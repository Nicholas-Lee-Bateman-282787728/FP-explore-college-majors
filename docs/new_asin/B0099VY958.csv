8538202,5,B0099VY958,Very informative. This has already help me a lot in taking much better flash lit pictures. A must have for aspiring photographers.,1421712000,,130,4.954545454545454
8538203,4,B0099VY958,"Great review and ease of reading how to use my new flash unit for my camera, it saved me from having to do a bunch of reasearch.",1400803200,,128,3.7777777777777777
8538204,3,B0099VY958,"Almost half the video is devoted to lighting techniques, which I though was unnecessary.  The title does not say it's a lighting technique crash course.",1395792000,,152,5.08
8538205,5,B0099VY958,"This is my first TTL flash. I've had fully manual ones for a few years but this a different ball game. This flash is very complex and sophisticated. I had been using the flash in full auto mode for a few months, sort of aimlessly, and not always being pleased with the results. I wasn't getting very far with online videos and articles. This crash course provides a full understanding of the flash and its capabilities. An amazing bonus is the Lighting Crash Course that comes with the DVD. For me, it's well worth the reasonable price to receive the information I need in one place that I can continually go back and reference whenever I need to. Michael's teaching style is extremely straight forward and easy to understand. I would recommend this crash course to anyone who wants to get into flash photography and improve their understanding of it. I loved my Canon flash. Now I love it even more.",1394409600,3,900,4.596273291925466
8538206,5,B0099VY958,"When I got my flash I was so confused. Not confused but, it seemed rather complicated. This DVD really broke down how it should be used and how to use it and get the best possible results. This was so worth the purchase and it came fairly quickly.",1393977600,4,247,4.166666666666667
8538207,5,B0099VY958,"I want to be positive because I did get a lot out of this video.  The content is well worth avoiding a steep learning curve.  The functions and operation of the Speedlite 600EX-RT are simple to follow and arranged in a logical and accessible manner. However, (here comes the BUT you're waiting for that demotes it to a 4 star review) this is about LIGHTING, and the lighting in the early part of this video couldn't be less professional.  Yes it is a video, but lighting applies to video as well as still or motion picture photography or painting for that matter.  At more than twice the price of Blue Crane videos, I would expect the production values to be on par, but they fall woefully short.  In one beach segment, the wind noise is way beyond acceptable limits.  But, this is a 3.5 hour information packed DVD, and I certainly have not found anything out there to rival the content and delivery.  The hosts are likeable do a great job of presenting the information.  So, come on guys and learn from your mistakes on the next video, because I'll probably buy it.  Oh, what the heck, the information is worth the 5-star rating, so I'll change it, but I feel production merited four.",1393200000,2,1186,4.5046728971962615
8538208,5,B0099VY958,"I was already familiar with the 600EX-RT as I've been using 4 of them and an ST-E3 for several months.  That said, I learned a ton from this video because it covers everything.  And I mean everything.  If the 600EX-RT is your first Speedlite, you will enjoy this video because it doesn't assume you know anything.  You might want to watch it in sections as you absorb everything but don't worry, the pace isn't too fast.  In fact, the pace is good for both beginners and experts.  Since I was already familiar with many of the concepts I was a little worried the video might be too slow or basic, but it was fine; the sections for beginners are sprinkled with tidbits of interest to experts.  Later in the DVD he gets into using multiple flashes and even explains when you might use a Pocket Wizard with the 600EX-RT which is something I'd been curious about.  He goes into the details of every single custom function, every single connector, batteries, and then some.  While the 600EX-RT manual dryly explains what each feature does,  this video additionally covers when you might use each feature and gives good examples.  Those last two are what make the concepts stick and make this DVD worth the money.

The production quality of the video is a little cheesy and some of the examples at the end aren't great pictures.  There's one picture of a model under some trees where his preferred settings have her severely blown out and he says ""there...that's what we want"".  While my aesthetic choices are different than some of the authors choices, it doesn't detract from the value of the lessons.  You will still learn what each control does, when to use it, and you get great examples that are easy to understand.

The only topic he could have spent another couple of minutes on is the gel filters that come with the 600EX-RT.  He explains what they are and shows how to insert them, but doesn't explain when you might use them or show examples like he does with other topics.

The lessons were obviously filmed in different order and at different times as the author's hair length toggles a between long flowing Fabio look and a short  James Dean.  Pretty funny.  Also, the author isn't as smooth as a professional actor.  His expertise is in flash photography, and that's why you buy this video and why despite a few minor quirks, I give this video an A++.",1384560000,6,2360,4.595693779904306
8538209,5,B0099VY958,Great DVD . It is doing a seminar on your speedlite for half the cost and when I have the time.,1379635200,,95,3.5714285714285716
8538210,5,B0099VY958,"This DVD will get you up to speed using the Canon Speedlite 600 EX-RT.
I wanted to update from my 580 EXII and 430 EX II and purchased three of the new radio controlled flashes. I wanted to make sure that I had the knowledge base in order to use the flashes to their fullest and decided on this DVD.
It met all my expectations. I chose this rating because of the extreme amount of information available for this Canon product.
I am fairly new to flash photography but this 600 EX-RT Crash Course has me up and running with confidence. I can and will return to the DVD for review.
I liked the tips along with examples of practical applications in using the flash (flashes). There are advanced segments that I will be able to view as my experience grows. I think that this DVD can benefit beginners  as well as more experienced photographers shooting weddings etc. Well put together and worth the money. Buy it!",1363564800,4,909,4.4431137724550895
