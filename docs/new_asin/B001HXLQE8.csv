Where it gets tripped up is the women themselves, all but one of whom look like they could be the second-most attractive gals in their trailer parks. They all have to be pushing 40 (and a couple brushing 50). So they are throwbacks not only in their dancing and attire, but also in their pudgy, pasty body types.

Of course I can see why this isn't entirely a negative; for an offering of this type you don't want the chicks to be too sexy, because that would detract from the fun spirit of the production and make it something that it very clearly isn't supposed to be. So, this is a criticism with awareness attached.

The bonus music CD is a nice addition.",1322179200,,873,4.547770700636943
8309940,5,B001HXLQE8,This a great DVD the idea of not just watching a fireplace is an awesome idea.  It's very entertaining and I am sure all will love it!,1229212800,,134,3.962962962962963
8309941,2,B001HXLQE8,"A good idea that is poorly produced. The vertical linearity is such that the dancers appear to be 6 ft tall and weigh 80 pounds; like Twiggy!  Also, the disc doesn't track properly; cannot change or reverse tracks easily.",1227571200,,221,4.666666666666667
8309942,5,B001HXLQE8,Great gag gift.  And it's a great quality product.  The production values are A+. The music is catchy and kitchy and fun.  The choreography is great.  The dancers are beautiful and talented.  Burlesque is back and this is top of the line proof!  I am buying one for my sister in law to play at her holiday party.  What a hoot!  I am also getting one for my best guy friend and his girl friend.  They will get a total kick out of it!,1225843200,4,432,4.0476190476190474
8309943,5,B001HXLQE8,"I must say I was fascinated when I heard the idea of the  Christmas yule log with dancing women. It is fantastic dvd to own for the holidays. The women are all beautiful, their costumes are incredible, and their performances are  sexy and original. What a wonderful way to incorporate burlesque into the holidays. The music will also knock your socks off. The Christmas songs we all grew up with is performed with a sexy go-go twist. Yule a go-go is a must have for your Christmas dvd collection and will definitely entertain your guests for your holiday parties.",1223856000,3,563,4.6767676767676765
8309944,5,B001HXLQE8,I love this DVD!! All the girls dancing on it are sooooo hot! Also I really love the music. I also love the fact that I can turn the girls off and just play the fire place if I want! I can't wait to have my annual Christmas party and have it play on my new 52 inch LCD TV!!!!,1223683200,3,275,3.6
