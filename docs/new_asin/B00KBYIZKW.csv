6413976,4,B00KBYIZKW,It's a good installment in the Revelation Road series. Anyone familiar with the book of revelation would know there's a lot more story to tell so like so many others have asked -- When is the fourth installment coming out?,1504483200,,222,4.575
6413977,5,B00KBYIZKW,Great inspiring movie really loved it so much,1501804800,,45,4.75
6413978,3,B00KBYIZKW,"I enjoyed movie 1 the best and the rapture scene special effects were even better than Hollywood could have done. Movie 2 was a throwaway as if the writers were trying to figure out where to take the character. Movie 3, especially with the character of the witness was very good, but it made a fatal minute-star error, it left on a cliffhanger. Even worse, Pureflix will ignore every query as to when movie 4 is coming out. There isn't even any information on whether or not a script is being written. Because the producers think so little of their fans as to not even reply to an email, 1 star for their character. 3 stars for a couple of halfway decent flix, - 5 stars for the cliffhanger.",1494028800,,691,4.364341085271318

6414003,5,B00KBYIZKW,It is a slower paced movie about the end and the coming of our Lord. This being said I did not feel like I was watching the clock to see when the movie would end. I cannot wait until Revelation Road 4 comes out.,1468281600,,211,3.8181818181818183

6414009,5,B00KBYIZKW,"Absolutely excellent movie. You must first watch Revelation Road and Revelation Road 2, in sequence, in order to understand what is going on. I'm not a pre-trib rapture believer, but in this movie it was actually more like what I believe it will be in the final coming of Jesus Christ, at the end of the world... When we are transformed into His likeness. The old will disintegrate at His coming, as our new, resurrected bodies take on our permanent form. Regardless of what you believe, however, the story is excellent and turns people to Jesus Christ. From sorrow, fear, and heartache, to pure joy... And really, that's what is should be all about. The acting is top notch... This isn't some B movie with second hand actors. It keeps you on the edge of your seat at times, in a very realistic way, not the typical hyped up sensationalism of Hollywood. It is also full of realistic emotionalism and is very inspiring. Really gets you to thinking!",1461196800,3,947,4.642857142857143

I don't watch most Hollywood movies because they don't seem to know how to make movies w/o cursing the Lord's name - that's my line in the sand w/ movies.  Enjoy this David A.R.

6414033,3,B00KBYIZKW,"The third in the Revelation Road series of Christian Post Rapture action flicks holds its own in the B movie genre.  It is darker than the earlier films and continues to follow the adventures of Josh McManus ( David A. R. White) a Mad Max style lone rider traveling around trying to help people.  McManus has been tagged in this one as The Black Rider and is attempting to find a doctor or the mysterious Shepherd to help her.  James Denton and Kevin Sorbo turn in interesting roles.  This film is a must for fans of the Revelation Road fans and some Apocalyptic fans, but there are others who don't like anything with Christian talk in it and they should pass on this rather than sit and complain because it is a key factor in the movie.  If you are anti-Christian you should pass on this, but if it does not bother you it is a decent watch and can be recommended.",1428710400,4,865,4.314814814814815

This is a nice end time thriller movie that has a clear Gospel message that fits into the storyline. The reference to this movie being a ""scaled down"" version of the movie ""The Book of Eli"" is accurate in my opinion.

6414049,4,B00KBYIZKW,"I never quite know what to expect from a David A.R. White movie. I only know that it will be edgy and more or less biblical about End Times. This movie was exactly like that. David White's character from the previous movies in this series was left behind as an unbeliever and now is searching for a particular girl in mostly lawless enemy territory. In the process, he cleans out a town ruled by a tyrannical leader and the leader's gang and helps two left behind believers on part of their journey to the Holy Land. Along the way, he gets into one adventure after another complete with edgy fights and gun battles. It was an entertaining couple of hours.",1423353600,,655,4.466666666666667

6414056,1,B00KBYIZKW,"This series is great, would love to actually own this in real quality. DVD is just unacceptable and poor quality for anything any more.
I could understand if this was released prior to HD, even BRD formats, but this is not the case. The movie was released in 2014, and there's really, really no excuse for excluding blu-ray releases",1421625600,,332,4.6440677966101696

6414058,2,B00KBYIZKW,"We have our third installment which opens with a quick glimpse of Revelation 6:5, one that is not on the screen very long, perhaps assuming its audience has it memorized. It concerns the breaking of the seal and the black rider of justice. In fact a black rider on a black horse appears, looking like death...and just like that you never see him again. Later in the film, to add to the confusion Joshua (David A.R. White) is called the black rider, although Revelation fails to mention the vintage Dodge he rode around in. In case you haven't figured it out, Revelation unfolds in Montana. There are people who control all the wealth and food. They have a triangle swastika looking thing above their left eye. The world is anti-Christian because...well because the Bible said it would be.

In this installment Joshua is looking for ""Grace"" a woman doctor while riding around with Sophia (Hilty Bowen) because the film is in desperate need of eye candy. He battles a bunch of bad guys along the way, including one called ""the beast"" (Pete Fields) in case you didn't have enough Revelation references, although he is not THAT beast. Josh is your basic God-fearing Republican who doesn't believe in guns...except for maybe that one time. Bruce Marchiano makes another cameo as ""The Stranger"" as it is listed in the credits as if the audience is too stupid to figure out he is Jesus, as that is the role he typically plays in these films. Oops. Sorry if I spoiled the plot with that one.

White seems have gotten into the role, finally after three films and has turned it up a notch. Unfortunately they had a bad cast of extras, especially the uncredited crowd extras who had trouble yelling and jeering during the fight, only making noise on the directors cue.

It is a bad interpretation of Revelation, but one that many enjoy regardless.",1421020800,,1836,4.695652173913044

6414060,5,B00KBYIZKW,"Great movie about the end times. I love David A. R. White's acting in this movie as well as the other two. This movie has a lot of action yet good internal conflict as well. Definitely watch the first two first because you won't get all of the references if you don't. One reason I think this movie stands out from other end times films is the focus. It focuses on a man that has been saved after the rapture and is looking to help others. Most focus on the mark or the global government, so this is an interesting change. Great plot, acting, and spiritual focus. Looking forward to seeing the next one whenever it comes out.",1420761600,,625,4.305084745762712

6414062,5,B00KBYIZKW,Fantastic movie.  Wish this were an ongoing tv series....  all the Revelation Road productions have been thrilling and the acting is great.  The days ahead for those not raptured are going to be beyond belief.  These scenerios may not even touch what will actually happen....and it's certainly going to happen.  Christ is at the door.  Do  you hear Him knocking?,1420243200,,362,4.933333333333334
6414063,4,B00KBYIZKW,A great story about doing what is right.  Jesus is also in this one and gives Josh a big decision to make.  It's great that Josh and Jesus disgust the results of each choice.  It made you realize what's important in life.  The best part is that the ending leads you to believe a part 4 is coming with Hawg coming back? It seems Hawg needs Joshs' help?,1420243200,,351,4.117647058823529

6414068,5,B00KBYIZKW,"Having been raised by a religious traditional mother, it's no surprise that I was raised on some End Times movies, but I quickly grew bored of them since they were scripted and designed to be shown in churches most of the time. This time, an End Times series has bite and isn't afraid of pushing modern-day theology's limits.
Josh McManus brings a gravely injured woman to a town that has outlawed all forms of religious talk. But, at the very time he has a appeared, the extremely strict governor has need of a man with Josh's skills to look for a mysterious man known only as the ""Shepherd"", and find him real soon.
The first two movies, after seeing this one, feels like a two-part prologue dealing with Josh and the degradation of society, this starts the End Times proper without rushing things too much. The Shepherd is given vague details most of the time with people really not knowing if he is a good person or a cult leader (or, as a cannibal once mentioned, a demon). So that creative story device really spurred the story on, along with other substories intertwined into the greater story.
Is this movie violent? It better be, to be an accurate end movie, it truly better be. Though not nearly as violent as The Book of Eli, in fact, with nearly every explosion, it's obvious that it's a low-budget film, which I'm okay with. Pure|Flix is indie, so I'm not worried about big budget looks, but it certainly has a better budget with costume design and more fistfights than the previous two films did. A little more theology (interspersed with a hint of psychological thriller in one scene) and some expository moments on specific things the Book of Revelation says, with more than a hint of Mad Max in the inspiration (Kevin Sorbo, in the behind-the-scenes, admitted that he loves that series, and it shows).
All-in-all, I'm glad some company is going further with limits and breaking traditional rules and actually getting dirty with the End.

Oh, and the very last scene definitely has a surprise cameo that made me drop my jaw at the what the next sequel could contain. Yes, I am eagerly anticipating Revelation Road 4.",1419206400,3,2132,4.670212765957447
6414069,5,B00KBYIZKW,Watch the series and see what leads up to this the 3rd part. We watched them out of order and each can stand on their own but we had to get all 3 because this one made us want to know what happened before. Very good movie.,1418860800,,222,3.74468085106383
6414070,4,B00KBYIZKW,A continuation of the story in the first episode when the Rapture occurred.,1418601600,,75,4.846153846153846

6414073,5,B00KBYIZKW,"Arrived fast! This movie is the best in the series, in my opinion. It's so refreshing to view a movie that doesn't contain blasphemous, obscenity ladden, filth.

A word of caution to other parents, use your discernment; while this is a very good faith-based film, it does have a significant amount of violence, which may not be suitable for young children.",1418169600,,356,4.836065573770492

6414078,5,B00KBYIZKW,The Road Warrior meets Jesus Christ........That's the best way I can describe the post apocalyptic Revelation Road movies. I always liked Mad Max and The Road Warrior but I don't know that I don't like Revelation Road movies better.  Anyone who thinks these movies will be lame because they are Christian movies would be very badly mistaken. The Revelation Road movies are action and adventure packed with a very heroic lead and very intimidating bad guys.,1416960000,10,456,5.0

8657421,3,B00KBYIZKW,I like anything that James Denton is in. I missed that it was another in a series so I wished that I had seen the others before watching this one. You don't have to have seen the others but I'm kinda obsessive that way.,1519171200,,219,4.0
