5006774,5,B006MWA93S,"Thanks to What's in the Bible, we had a chance to sit down and watch it with some of our friends and have a party of sorts. We always love an excuse to have friends over! Our kids were so excited when the package arrived with the latest installment and especially excited to share it with their friends.

After watching Exile and Return, we grabbed some snacks and sat down to color together. The DVD also comes with a coloring sheet that can be photocopied to share with your children. Inside the case are questions that you can review with your kids after the video to see what they have learned and remember as well.

Our verdict? We loved Exile and Return: Ezra, Nehemiah and Esther! The humor and quality are similar to the other videos in the What's in the Bible line and ones that we will hang onto. It's been in our house a week and has already been seen two other times!

One of the things that I personally have been most excited about with the DVDs from What's in the Bible is how they are fitting in with our history curriculum, Mystery of History.  As the girls and I sat down to watch Exile and Return again later in the week, so much of the history that they were explaining in the DVD {about the country of Assyria, for example} just clicked with the girls because of what we've been studying in history. Having a fun visual to add another dimension to their history studies was a huge help!",1341532800,2,1407,4.338403041825095
5006775,5,B006MWA93S,"The best teaching of the Bible and the plan of Salvation I have ever found for kids. I started buying the series when my granddaughter was just 3. She didn't get it at first but as I had her I would play them for her over and over again, I also bought other cartoon Bible stories of characters that were mentioned in the series (Samson, Adam and Eve, Ruth, etc.) She got to understand and now knows more than most adults do and she is only 4!! I highly recommend doing this to get the gospel in them to equip them for what they will have to face in this day and age!",1337904000,,566,4.017699115044247

5006789,5,B006MWA93S,"We have all of these DVDs.  My children love to watch them in the car on trips to grandparents.  My husband and I even find ourselves listening to the information and learning something new.  Beware - some of the songs will stick in your head ALL DAY LONG!  Our 5 year old has watched the videos since she was 2 and has enjoyed them at every stage.  As she gets older she discovers and understands more of the information and humor... so she can definitely grow with these DVDs.  Our second child is starting out on the same path of loving them, too.",1452643200,,550,4.29126213592233
5006790,5,B006MWA93S,"I really love this whole series. It explains Bible verses and theological in ways that my daughter not only understands, but also enjoys. She loves this series and I'm glad to get her this and any other in this series knowing she will be taught sound theology, truth and have fun in doing so. I am truly amazed at some of what I hear. The first time we saw a WITB video, I was working on the computer and then I started to realize some things were being said that I heard in my college theology classes. I stopped to listen and remember thinking, how awesome is this? My daughter is learning something more than surface level Bible stories and it actually still makes sense to her!",1451606400,,681,4.3700787401574805

5006797,5,B006MWA93S,"Phil Vischer is now officially half way through his new project.  Best known as the creator of VeggieTales, for the last few years hes been focusing on Whats in the Bible?  This straight to DVD series features Phil and a range of puppets are we get an overview of the Bible and why each section matters.  The series will run 13 videos, and Exile and Return! is volume 7 in the series.

This DVD looks at the final three books of the histories, the Old Testament books that chronicle Israels history.  Specifically, that means Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther.

Each video in the series is an hour in length, and thats further broken down roughly in two.  The first half hour, then, looks at Ezra and Nehemiah.  First, theres a brief recap of where we are in Israels history (both kingdoms have been conquered).  As we delve into the story of the return to Jerusalem and rebuilding the temple and later the walls of the city, we also learn about the rulers who allowed the Israelites to return and rebuild their land.  I must admit I am fairly shaky on this time in Israels history, so I found the program interesting and learned a lot from it.

The second half focuses on the story of Esther.  Its one of the longest retellings of a Bible story weve seen to date on the series, but even then they leave out a few of the details.  But the entire point of the videos isn't to retell Bible stories but to give a broad overview of what is in each book of the Bible and how that fits into the overall story God is telling.

Toward that end, they actually spend the last 10 minutes of this video asking what weve learned from the History section of the Old Testament, that starts with Joshua and covers twelve books.  The answer, of course, is about Gods love and patience but ultimately his holiness and justice when faced with continual sin.  It also shows that, no matter how we try, we cannot follow Gods laws on our own, so we need a Savior.

Speaking of learning, there is also a discussion of why some numbers in the Bible are rounded or why some names are spelled differently by different authors.  They also discuss would Judah became for the basis for the ethnic term Jews that we still use today.  (And I felt so foolish for not figuring that out myself years ago.  See, even adults can learn something from these videos.)

Of course, this isn't just dry facts.  Our host Buck Denver is trying to host despite a caffeine overload.  Clive and Ian are still in a plane, and Captain Pete is still trying to join them for the songs.  The back and forth between the characters can create some fun jokes and keeps this from being boring lectures but something that kids will actually learn from.  I know I laughed along the way.  And if a really serious point needs to be made, Phil is standing by in person to make it, although he doesnt say much until the last few minutes as hes trying to wrap things up.

The one downfall to this series has been the songs.  They can be enjoyable or they can be painful.  There are only a handful here, and they are okay, so that didn't distract me too much from the information I was supposed to be learning.

So Exile and Return! becomes a stronger entry in this fun series.  Considering the books well be tackling in the next couple of videos, I cant wait to see how Phil makes them interesting as we learn Whats in the Bible?",1429660800,,3359,4.369354838709677
5006798,3,B006MWA93S,"the kids watch this over and over and over.....don't agree with ""freewill"" approach, was hoping it would just stick to Bible stories and not put their own theology into BUT, hey it's a great teaching tool to discuss differences in religions. God chose us because of HIS grace for us, and what HE did for us, not the other way around....Romans 5:8 ""But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."" There was NOTHING good in us to be able to ""choose"" Him.....Buck and I disagree on this point.",1429228800,,538,4.5

I fist bought these DVDs when my daughter was about 4 years old, but she was too young for them then and couldn't really follow along. She is now 7 years old and LOVES them! She keeps asking me to get her more from the series.  They contain a wealth of information and they are very Biblically sound. And funny!! It's a great series for kids, I would say starting around 6 years of age, perhaps.",1420848000,,446,4.247058823529412

5006805,5,B006MWA93S,"These two episodes of Whats in the Bible? cover the Babylonians, Medes and Persians and the history of how they were involved in the Hebrews exile from their land. It focuses on the books of Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther, and finishes up the Bible's historical books.

It is about an hour, and covers Ezras rebuilding of the Temple after their return, and the problems they had doing it. It also covers Nehemiah and rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem. A catchy song about this by the Bentley Brothers, Lincoln Neal and Rhett McLaughlin, is one of the many highlights on this DVD.

The song is so cleverdone with an unusual beat and Popsicle puppetsand there's one Popsicle puppet wearing an I (heart) NY shirt trying to get into the picturethis song and puppet segment is more than worth the price of this DVD. It is funny, yet it tells the true story with accuracy, one standard met by all the songs in this 13-DVD series.

The story of Esther is told by the voice of Chester Whigget, and his Popsicle puppets. Here is one difference between Vischers new series and his previous series, VeggieTales: In VeggieTales version, Esther is a gourd, and her uncle is a grape. Many details are changed, though despite that, the main idea of the story gets across. Whats in the Bible? deals with the actual story. Both are good. But these Popsicle puppets of Vischer's are great, every time he uses them to tell a story.

Bonus Features include the usual two, Show Outtakes and Michaels Deleted Scene, and there is also a bonus video of some very young children telling what they like about the Whats in the Bible series.

5006817,5,B006MWA93S,"This is a great DVD and series for teaching children about the Bible, especially parts that are not often found in children's Bibles or common Bible stories.  It walks through each book and highlights the main points and ties it all into ""God's Rescue Plan"".  Our 5 year old loves this DVD and the whole series we have so far and often surprises me with how much understanding he actually has of Biblical concepts.  I would recommend this series to anyone with a 4-8 year old child especially, but actually for the whole family.",1403654400,,528,4.595744680851064

5006819,5,B006MWA93S,"I can not SAY ENOUGH about this series. I was really looking for a curriculum that my 12 yr. old and 8 yr. old could enjoy together, but this is something even my husband and I enjoy too!

We have 1-10 now and are ordering the rest. This is something we watch as a family and discuss it as part of our weekly family bible study. It has facts and history that my husband and I (both 'church kids', and I am a PK) haven't even heard before.

I am most impressed at how it gives the great overview of covenant, showing what even most adults don't see, the thread that runs through the entire bible from sin to salvation. We just finished the first New Testament DVD #10 and can not wait to get to the others. My only worry is that we are catching up to the series and will have to wait for others to come out. =)

It's a great tool for teaching kids (and adults) about the Bible.  The kids consider it funny, love the songs and characters, and like that I'm using it as part of their Homeschool Bible class this year.  It has to be viewed multiple times for it to really sink in (since it packs so much information in some episodes) but that's ok.  It make for good conversations and teaching.  I extend the learning with hands on activities in our Bible Interactive Notebook.  Just have a few more DVDs to acquire and watch.  One improvement that could be made is to have the characters speak more slowly.  The content is hard so slowing it down would be great.
