The story of ""Abilene Town"" [1946] begins with a herd of Hereford cattle in 1870. A thousand miles of cattle trails stretched from Texas to Abilene Kansas. The cowboys get paid and celebrated like sailors after a long voyage. One side of town has places that catered to young men who wanted a good time. Shots are fired. The town has two rules for visiting cowboys: check your guns with the bartender, and don't cross Texas Street (the decent part of town). The saloons attract trail-hands, their cash makes the town prosperous. Settlers arrive in town. The cattlemen don't want homesteaders. A cowboy argues with a gambler and loses again. The Town Marshal keeps things peaceful so the dollars roll in. Sheriff Bravo Tremble has a different attitude from the Marshal. Someone robbed the train? What can the Sheriff do? The homesteaders came for their government land. They produce crops. The Sheriff visits a saloon, its owner worries about his future. A man shoots at the Marshal then hides in the theater. We hear another song and see dancing girls. Rats in the basement? A long dull evening? The Marshal visits a rooming house for young women. Rita loves her life. Outside of town riders burn out a settler and shoot a man. Then they attack the settler's camp. Who wants to drive the settlers away? One of the riders was recognized: Jeff Younger. The Marshal visits the saloon, and is offered a job by Charlie.

Sheriff Bravo forms a posse to search for the killer. Marshal Mitchell has a clue, but the Sheriff is in command. Sheriff Bravo plays cards with a sod buster. ""Let's deal again."" The Town Marshal captures Jeff alive to bring him back to town. The Sheriff looks for votes! The people cheer his return. There is another song. Mitchell visits Rita. Jeff escaped from jail with a gun. What will the Sheriff do? Marshall Dan ends it. Will Abilene ever change? Shelly says Dan loves his job too much. The homesteaders must organize to fight for their rights by fencing their lands with barbed wire. Is it a crime to work hard for yourself? The cattle stampede past the fences and destroy what is in their way. Mr. Boulder does the math: 500 families will generate more sales than from cowboys. Marshal Dan closes the saloons. Charlie hesitates. Riker's gang arrives to break into the saloons. Shelly can handle a gun. ""I'm proud of you."" Sheriff Tremble will lead the men, who sing as they march. A wide open town? Marshal Dan tries to arrest Riker. The cowboys are told to ride out of town peaceably. The fight is over, the townspeople won. [This was adapted from the novel ""Trail Town"" by Ernest Haycox. It has songs, romance, action, comedy, and economic conflict.]

""The Fighting Westerner"" [1935] begins with a rider who visits an empty house. Larry Sutton meets the Deputy Sheriff Tex Murdock. Larry has a letter of introduction (to replace Parsons). Mr. Borg is dead due to a mining ""accident"". Parsons was accused of murder, but he disappeared. ""What noise?"" Larry wants to learn more about this crime, and visits the Ballard's house. Two huge dogs guard the house. Relatives talk about their presumed inheritance. Larry knows about radium mining. One gram of radium sold for $37,000! Mr. Ballard is confined to bed. Larry meets Rita Ballard. How valuable is the mine? Who wrote that warning note? The stamping mill makes a noise; Fritz was murdered! Ballard tells about his will; if an inheritor dies his share will not be divided among the others. We learn about the people there. Who shot at John Borg? Who stole Borg's body? Larry advises building a new factory; Ballard disagrees. Will the Black Rider strike again? Is a girl in danger? Will a search of Mrs. Ballard's rooms reveal anything? Is a hoofprint as individual as fingerprints? Was that Jack Parson's horse? What happened to Rita? The former Mrs. Ballard arrives, she wants to see Mr. Ballard. A masquerade is over. Larry figured it out. Borg makes a deal with Larry - can he be trusted? Larry tries to rescue Rita from Borg. Justice triumphs. Rita and Larry will be sitting on top of the world.

This story was adapted from a Zane Grey novel ""Golden Dreams"". It is basically a murder mystery set in a mansion, where heirs to a fortune are eliminated so someone will inherit a fortune. This story reminded me of Dashiell Hammett's short story ""Night Shots"". ""Eyewitness evidence is most credible when it is supported by circumstantial evidence.""

8096592,3,B000CBEX4G,"The two black and white westerns featured here are both excellent western fare although ""Abilene Town"" is the main event here and is without doubt the better film, although perfectly viewable it is let down by a less than perfect transfer to DVD (Star rating reduced accordingly). Strangely enough although eleven years older and somewhat dated ""The Fighting Westerner"" transfer to DVD is excellent! All well worth the low asking price from Amazon.

ABILENE TOWN (1946 - 89 Minutes).

Based on the novel ""Trail Town"" by Ernest Haycox and well scripted by Harold Shumate with some excellent one-liners - The story is set in Kansas five years after the end of the Civil War. Abilene is the town at the end of the Chisholm Trail and depicts the struggle between cattlemen and homesteaders in between the two is upright town marshal Dan Mitchell (Randolph Scott) who is trying to calm down the homesteaders led by a head-strong Henry Dreiser (Lloyd Bridges) whilst routing out the corrupt cattlemen. Vying for the marshal's attention is dance hall queen Rita (Ann Dvorak) and general store keeper Ed Balder's (Howard Freeman) daughter Sherry (Rhonda Fleming). Jet Younger (Jack Lampart) is wanted for a train robbery and an out-of-town murder; Dan sets off to capture him with county sheriff  ""Bravo"" Trimble (Edgar Buchanan). Later the homesteaders fence off the cattle trail, leading to the cattlemen stampeding the cattle across the homesteaders land resulting in several deaths. Culminating in both sides facing each other across the streets of Abilene.

Directed by Edward L. Marin with some nice Fordian touches like the hymn singing in the church with the 23-year old Rhonda Fleming in fine voice, also the haunting strains of `Glory Glory Hallelujah' at the homesteaders camp. Marin also seemed to have Scott alternately (according to his attire) to look like Gary Cooper or William S. Hart. On its release in January '46, critics of the day reported that ""Scott showed his age (47) also he looked tired and in need of a rest"" Indeed little or no rest lay ahead for him as over the next 15 years discounting a cameo appearance he made another 40 films 38 of them westerns; half-a-dozen of them minor-masterpieces and culminating in Sam Peckinpah's elegiac RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY (1962).

THE FIGHTING WESTERNER (1935 - 70 Minutes).

Formerly known as ""Rocky Mountain Mystery"" Based on a Zane Grey story ""Golden Dreams"" this charming early Randolph Scott contemporary western is, more or less a semi-comic murder mystery set in the West. Mining engineer Larry Sutton (Randolph Scott) teams up with a cantankerous Deputy Sheriff ""Tex"" Murdock (Charles ""Chic"" Sale) to solve a series of murders in a Nevadan Radium Mine. James Ballard (George Marion Sr.) has hired Sutton for his mining expertise on arrival at the mine he is fired on by Rita Ballard (Ann Sheridan). From here on in the story moves at a fast pace as Sutton and Co try to solve the Rocky Mountain mystery.

Directed by Charles Barton. Scott is perfectly at home in the title role. The love interest is supplied by 20 year-old former Beauty Queen Ann Sheridan in only her second major role. Charles ""Chic"" Sale (1885 - 1937) played ""Ben Gunn"" in the 1934 version of TREASURE ISLAND. Halliwell's Film Guide records: Mrs. Leslie Carter (a rare screen appearance, and just as well to judge from her performance) plays Mrs Borg the housekeeper.",1169856000,4,3405,4.952714535901927
8096593,4,B000CBEX4G,"I had never seen these two Randolph Scott westerns before, and boy I was bowled over by Ann Dvorak's dancehall scene.  Wow where have I been!  Actually wrong generation.  I'm sure my grandfather would have known about Ann Dvorak.

Both movies were very interesting in their own way.  Abilene Town shows the stress between ranchers and cattleman, and the difficulty presented to Abilene in living with both sides.  Rhonda Fleming is beautiful, but looses out to Ann Dovrak in the end.  Lloyd Bridges is good as one of the young ranchers.  Seems to be a very authentic story, but one very short section of the film has contrast problems.

Rocky Mountain Mystery, based on a Zane Grey story, is typical of the kinds of westerns I remember seeing on Saturday morning television in the fifties.  I wonder if it was originally meant to be a serial, because of the way Randy Scott seems to escape from certain death every 20 minutes or so?  Very entertaining, and like a lot of these movies the gorgeous outdoors, trees, range, seems to steal the movie from the actors, even when filmed in black & white.",1168732800,5,1097,4.661458333333333
