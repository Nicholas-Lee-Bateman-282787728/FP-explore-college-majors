8298902,5,B001EN2HEE,"I really recommend this DVD series. Since getting it, I have been painting along with Sue in the evenings.  And, while my paintings aren't much to look at yet, I'm learning alot.  Painting is a good stress reliever after a long day at work, and Sue is a very good instructor.  I watch her, then hit pause and do what she does (or try to!) then hit play again.  Art lessons aren't available in my area and I'm sure real live classes would be better.  But these DVDs are the next best thing.",1339286400,2,489,4.21505376344086
