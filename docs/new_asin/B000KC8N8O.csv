8155536,5,B000KC8N8O,"This video was very informative.  I was interested in learning more about how guide dogs were trained, and this video definitely delivered.  I never knew what an involved process it was for everyone.  I love the footage of when the dogs were puppies, and then to see them in action in the last steps of their training.  I am glad to know that there are people that devote their time and energy to such a good cause.  I am also happy that such a great video was made so that I could learn more.  I highly recommend the purchase of this video.  You won't regret it.",1047254400,,563,4.254716981132075
8155537,5,B000KC8N8O,"I found this educational video to be informative, entertaining, fun and even nerveracking at times as I found myself becoming anxious watching the dogs take tests that could make or break them as guide dogs. I watched this video because I was interested in knowing how guide dogs were trained. I learned that and more as the story introduces you to a litter of puppies and then rides you through their journey in becoming guide dogs. I highly recommend ""Future Guide Dogs.""",1043884800,,473,4.780487804878049
