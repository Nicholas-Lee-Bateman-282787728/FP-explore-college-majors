5956210,1,B00EYJC1QY,It was not obvious that this produce was being shipped from Italy and that the DVD's most likely would not be able to be viewed on the average DVD unit in the United States.  I had to jump threw hoops to get this item returned and refunded to my account.,1368057600,13,254,4.08
5956211,2,B00EYJC1QY,6 DVDs but 3 film. I thought that they were 6 film and I didn't know that it was sent from Italia.,1361145600,6,98,3.5
5956212,5,B00EYJC1QY,"All of the 3D blurays worked on my Smart Samsung 3D UHD bluray player! The regular blurays do not, but I didn't buy this for that. So if you want all 3D films then this is for you! I'm so happy!",1503619200,,194,3.7560975609756095
5956213,5,B00EYJC1QY,"This is a great deal, amazing movies. I don't see how anyone can say some won't play. My UHD and 3D Sony player is region free... they all works perfect... thank you very much for a great product.. perfect!",1502668800,,206,4.3076923076923075
5956214,5,B00EYJC1QY,"If you don't have any of these and want the 3D versions, this set is great.  In fact, even if you HAVE one of these, it's still cheaper to get this than any of the single titles for 3D versions, AND we've LOVED the 3D!

It says it's region B/UK but 5 out of the 6 discs worked fine in our player (Samsung UBD-K8500).  Nightmare before xmas 2D had a region block on it and therefore didn't play in our region 1 player (worked fine in the Oppo). For the price of this set, and the fact we wanted 3D most of all, this was an awesome purchase.  The other 2D dis.cs played fine in our US player.  I'm not knocking a star for the disc that didn't work - the description warned that it was region 2

(Total side note - I'm not sure what beef there is between Disney and Amazon, but the UK prices on Disney blu-rays (and 3D versions) compared to US is inexcusable.  If you can find region-free discs, save yourself some cash and get them.)",1494979200,,931,4.110497237569061
5956215,5,B00EYJC1QY,For me it's nice to have these three 3D Tim Burton works in one package at a price lower than Nightmare Before Christmas can be found as a standalone purchase.  Have only watched Alice so far but the mastering and 3D is very good.  This collection is a good deal for anyone interested.,1493683200,,285,4.3584905660377355

5956224,4,B00EYJC1QY,"Okay, so in the UK version you'll get the 3 movies, here is what I received in my box set to clear up some confusion. We are Region 'A'.

Frankenweenie
2D - Region A/B/C
3D - Region A/B/C

Alice In Wonderland
2D - Region A/B/C
3D - Region B - Won't play in USA

Nightmare Before Christmas
2D - Region B - Won't play in USA
3D - Region A/B/C

To sum it up, with USA players you can watch Frankenweenie in 2D and 3D, Alice in 2D, and Nightmare Before Christmas in 3D. Hopefully this helps!",1471910400,20,487,3.9896907216494846

5956226,1,B00EYJC1QY,"I am very disappointed.  I didn't even know there was such a thing as regional DVD/blu rays.  When I got the movies, 2 out of the four won't work in my player.  The main one we wanted won't work.  I read the fine print after the fact (but this was tucked away where it was hard to find and I really had to look for it.  Many of these other good reviews keep saying it is a great 3D set and that it works fine, but I think they are reviewing the wrong thing since this isn't a 3D set and half of it won't play in the US :(",1470787200,2,521,3.7
5956227,1,B00EYJC1QY,Do not order if you are looking for region free. Only one of the movies in the set is region free. The other two are region B.,1466553600,2,126,3.7037037037037037

5956229,5,B00EYJC1QY,"One could say that my discovery of The Nightmare Before
Christmas is very much like Jack the Pumpkin King's
discovery of the holiday itself.  Full of magic and wonder,
Tim Burton has given his own contorted homage to the best
known Christmas story in a film that has become his own
personal masterpiece as well as my favorite animated tale.

Released theatrically in 1993, this overly-dark animated
musical has stood the test of time.  Thanks to its brilliant
stop-motion animation and three-dimensional sets it remains
one of the most innovative, quirky and spectacular classics
ever made.

In a world where holidays are run by individual towns,
Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon) is the undisputed
Pumpkin King of Halloween who after years of heading
up the celebration of the holiday, becomes depressed at
his continued efforts.  Upon taking a walk into the forrest he
happens upon an entrance way into a wondrous place called
Christmas Town filled with beautiful colors, decorations and
finely wrapped gifts.  In the film's most memorable musical
number, Jack becomes enamored with this wondrous world.

After boasting the virtues of Christmas to his hobgoblin and
monstrous friends of Halloween Town, Jack hatches a plan
to kidnap Santa Claus and take his place for the upcoming
Christmas holiday. Though Jack feels this to be a novel idea,
he finds opposition from an adoring frankenstein-ish rag doll
named Sally (Catherine O'Hara) who feels that these plans
pose dangerous consequences.

Collaborating with Tim Burton, Danny Elfman wrote the songs
and composed the score for the film.  This partnership once
again proved to be a huge success as Elfman provides a devilish,
dark underscore to Burton's story whichd features such memorable
tunes such as ""This is Halloween"" and ""What's This.""

Though not originally conceived for 3D when theatrically
released in 1993, The Nightmare Before Christmas has
been recently upconverted to the format. The results are
quite astonishing.  This is perhaps the best upconverted 3D
title that I have seen.  Though there isn't that kind of blatant
""pop up book"" effect that I usually prefer, I was rather taken
back by the more subdued layered effect of the 3D presentation.
There is definitely a sense of depth here between background
and foreground images.  Some of it gets lost within the dark
backdrop of the Halloween world (where slight ghosting issues
are introduced) while some shots seemed to be framed so
perfectly that one could easily think the film was conceived
for the format.  Mind you, this doesn't rank as the best 3D I
have seen, but it's nice to see that the conversion has actually
enhanced the 2D experience to something even more satisfying.

There is very hardly any screen protrusion happening here,
though there are moments where feet and fingers just seem
to barely poke outwards.

As one would expect from a Disney transfer, The Nightmare
Before Christmas just looks and sound top-notch.  The transfer
is incredibly sharp and well defined.  Though the drab, Halloween
town scenes through most of the film minimize any sort of color,
the outstanding, deep and inky black levels give these scenes
amazing texture.  When the film switches to Christmas Town one
can't help but be as wide-eyed as Jack Skeleton as you soak in
all the beautiful, vivid colors.  Of course, the most impressive
eye-candy sequences involve Santa's encounter in Oogie
Boogie's lair with it's eye-popping neon images that look even
more impressive in 3D.  There is not a flaw to be found here.

The film's 7.1 Dolby TrueHD (downconverted to 5.1 on my
system) is a real head-turner, and I mean that in the respect
that this is a totally immersive sonic experience that has a
seemingly never-ending barrage of vocals and supporting
effects emanating from every channel. Dialogue is well
centered across the front three channels, never drowned
out by the robustly presented musical numbers that come
through with amazing clarity.

The Nightmare Before Christmas is presented in a 3-Disc
3D Blu-ray/2D Blu-ray/DVD+Digital Copy combo package.
The 2D Blu-ray contains all the bonus material that includes
a Tim Burton introduction, Jack's Haunted Mansion Holiday
Tour, audio commentary, deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes
featurette and short films Frankenweenie and Vincent.

Let's face it.  The Nightmare Before Christmas has
remained one of the most original and memorable animated
films ever made. It is beloved by multitudes of fans who
consider it to be a timeless classic.  And certainly, after
18 years, this film has not lost a spec of its appeal.  It is
one of those films that is no less deserving of an annual
holiday viewing than It's A Wonderful Life would be.

Disney has done an outstanding job with the transfer. In
all, this is a demo-quality disc.  The 3D conversion is very
good -- considerably better than most upconversions I have
seen.  This certainly has whet my appetite for the forthcoming
conversions of The Lion King and Beauty and The Beast.

This title belongs in every 3D collection.",1453075200,,5050,5.099635479951397

8610315,4,B00EYJC1QY,"this is a region B box and worthless to any Americans who don't have a multi-region player. don't be suckered by reviews that say it will play. they are region B discs. Amazon needs to learn to clearly State what region on every single 3D disc.
I need to update my review.the 3D disc of The Nightmare Before Christmas is a region a b c not a region B like it says on the back of the box.
the 3D version of Alice in Wonderland is a region B but the special features disc is All Region.
the special features disc on the nightmare before christmas is a region B.

For US without a region free player, this is the purchase of 2 3D movies and 1 2D film. Decide for yourself.
