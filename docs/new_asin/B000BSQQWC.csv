8324048,5,B000BSQQWC,I am lucky enough to have an all-region dvd player.  I remembered this series from when I lived in the UK in the early 80's.  It certainly left an impression that I would remember it all these years later.  Fantastic series and worth every penny to see it all again.,1344902400,,266,4.28
8324049,5,B000BSQQWC,"25+ years and I still remembered this series from when I lived in the UK.  I was only 13 then.  I was so happy to find this dvd.  I had to also order a dvd player that I could hack the region codes to play this, but it was totally worth it.  The series was exactly as I remembered.  The acting was superb.  The characters are so well written.",1240876800,4,342,3.8840579710144927
