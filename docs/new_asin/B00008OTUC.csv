7986136,5,B00008OTUC,"This video is BJJ at it's best and it's highest level.  Not an instructional video, but a ""greatest hits"" of Jean Jacques.  The tape shows Jean jacques as a blue belt, then later as a black belt fighting the Japanese champion, and his fight against Wallid Ismail.  You also get into the mind of Jean Jacques and get to see what he thinks about as he approaches, and trains for a fight.  This is an excellent tape for the BJJ practitioner who wants to see the game played at it's highest level.",1013299200,2,493,4.326086956521739
