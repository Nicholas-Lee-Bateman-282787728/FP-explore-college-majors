7920311,5,B00004CYOR,"This 1947 film is a fun-filled journey about a G.I. (Bill Williams) who overhears the diagnosis of another patient by a doctor and nurse while a stint in hospital. He is convinced he has a short time left & tries to commit suicide when he's saved by an artist (Barbara Hale) whom he befriends and falls in love with. She tries to convince him he isn't dying. He soon becomes attached to the woman and her younger brother (Lanny Rees).

Much chaos & misadventure ensue with a great cast of performers. If you are able to catch A Likely Story (1947), it really is worth watching. I've seen it several times already. A light, madcap comedy of the 1940s which is thoroughly entertaining. :-)",1397347200,,687,4.540322580645161
7920312,5,B00004CYOR,"I would like to see this movie, with Barbara Hale and Bill Williams, as my uncle played an artist.
His name was James A. Grenvold (1902-1998). I wonder if it will be on dvd ???",1291680000,,176,4.057142857142857
