8506282,5,B006XF2WG6,"This ""Jesus"" is so much more like the Bible than the other versions. The history and culture in this are educational and inspiring.",1402012800,2,131,4.739130434782608
8506283,3,B006XF2WG6,"I received this DVD to review free.

I enjoyed this film and the simple statements the narrator gives, as well as the great visuals of Jesus...
This is a good DVD that you could use for teaching supplemental material for small groups etc...

My only issue, and it is small, is that I don't know this teacher.
I have nothing against what he said in the episodes I was given to review; yet I don't know him.

I don't want to promote a preacher or speaker that I am not familiar with.",1345334400,,481,4.206521739130435
8506284,5,B006XF2WG6,I love the way the Jesus is portrayed in this DVD series. For once we see a Jesus who displays a full range of human emotion and looks like a Jewish man from the ancient middle east! Andy Frost's commentary is very powerful and convicting. This is an excellent discipleship tool.,1330732800,3,279,4.490196078431373
