8486997,1,B003L783JE,"I ordered this DVD (Food as Medicine Part 1) and also Part 2, Part 3, Part 4 and Part 5.  Because of the way they are titled, I thought it reasonable to assume that each successive DVD would build upon the previous one and contain new and different information about the diet that Dr. Wahls espouses.  Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. The first 4 DVD's consist of a power point presentation that is just plain dry.  You never see anything except the power point and hear Dr. Wahls' voice giving the presentation.  There is only a slight difference in any of the presentations and that's because of the different audiences, some of whom seem to be medical professionals and some are students, or the public in general.  That's it.  The presentations are dry as dust and if you are looking for interesting ways to implement this diet, forget about it.  There is not one recipe or serving suggestion.

I learned of Dr. Wahls from an article and video clip on Dr. Mercola's site.  I should have stuck with that - it would have saved me $200!  I really gained no further usable information from these presentations.  I feel ripped-off.  The price of these videos is ridiculous.  The last video, Part 5, at least shows the two speakers,  Dr. Wahls and a ""Master Gardener"".  I've been gardening for more years than he's been on this earth, so I can't say that I learned anything from him, either.  It was more like a gardening pep-talk, but at least it was different from the first 4 and you could see the speakers.

My advice to anyone interested in the Paleo diet is to research it online and find some information you can use.  I respect and admire Dr. Wahls for taking her future and health into her own hands and coming up with a solution to her serious health problems, but if you are looking for how-to's, you should save your money and keep looking.  You can find lots more info online and it won't empty your bank account.",1332374400,33,1947,4.527220630372493
