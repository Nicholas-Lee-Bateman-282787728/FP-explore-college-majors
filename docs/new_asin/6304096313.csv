8317509,5,6304096313,I bought this video last year and I love it! I love to wacth the antics of the dogs but this video also tells you about spaying or neutering your dogs and about puppy mills. I love the music esepecailly the music when they show the German Shepherd. This video shows about 50 breeds a lot of them are my favorites. The Dog Tips and Dog Facts are very informative. So this a really good dog video,1215302400,,394,4.12987012987013
