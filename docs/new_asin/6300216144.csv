252462,4,6300216144,"Just wanted to clear up one thing about this excellent movie. Many of the Molly Maguires were murderers and not particularly noble ones at that. The movie uses real names of the people actually involved in this story. The character Richard Harris plays comes out looking pretty bad at the end, but if there was a hero in the real Molly Maguire story, it would be this very brave, or very stupid, detective spy.",980035200,2,410,4.554054054054054
252463,5,6300216144,"I was raised in coal region where this movie is about and had grandparents work in the mines.  This movie was very personal to me because of this and showed just how life was.  All my life I heard stories of the Molly's and  the characters portrayed in this film they were brought to life in this  film.  Richard Harris is excellent and you see him gain understanding and  sympathy for the men he is after.  Through him you slowly learn their  struggle and reason for the course of their actions.  Sean Connery, as  always, is tremendous in the part and I can  easly close my eyes and see  him exiting a coal mine, dirty and sweaty after a 12 hour shift.  This  movie is worth seeing again and again",948585600,8,699,4.276923076923077

252524,5,6300216144,"We lived in the area where these events took place and this movie is probably very close to the truth of the hardships that the miners endured.  There is a hand print on one of the walls of the old Carbon County jail (now a museum) that was supposedly put there by Alexander Campbell who stated before his hanging that the hand print would always remain to proclaim his innocence.  Campbell was not a miner, but a recruiter for the Molly Maguires.  Although local sentiment is divided about the guilt or innocence of the Molly Maguires, there is no doubt that the mine owners kept the families in poverty and debt to the mines.  I would very highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see what earlier immigrants had to endure to live in the United States.",1476662400,4,764,4.474820143884892

252531,4,6300216144,"The Molly Maguires, 1970 film

The story begins in 1873 Pennsylvania. The country was in another economic depression. A man enters a bar and looks at the others there. He is a stranger. His hands say he is not a coal miner. He plays card; did he cheat? There is a fight. The police enter to break it up. [We learn about a double agent there.] He has to identify the leaders of the miner's resistance so they can be caught red-handed. [Isn't that a fancy cell with wallpaper?] McKenna walks down the dirty street of a coal town to a boarding house ($1.50 a week). He applies for a job; it starts at 5am. The workers descend below to dig out anthracite coal (hard coal powered steam engines for industry). Holes are drilled in coal seams to insert dynamite to break it up. On pay day they get a ""bob-tailed check"" after the deductions for rent in a company house, groceries in a company store, tools from a company store, etc. The mine owners profited from this.

The priest warns against the use of violence, as at a local colliery. The Church condemns secret societies. Who talked back to the priest? Jack Kehoe. Why did McKenna come there? For privacy and work. Later there is an accident in the mine. Young boys kick a ball around. [In reality, they would be working sorting coal, not playing or even in school]. Some men wonder about McKenna - is he a spy? There is game of football (or rugby?) on a dusty field. [No grass?] Can another coal worker become rich? There are shots and a fight. [This works off anger, ""divide et impere"".] Jack Kehoe calms a few angry men. Will they get revenge? McKenna reports what happened. Can he stir up trouble? Kehoe and others arrive to meet McKenna and induct him into the AOH. He learns the recognition signs and the password. An accident keeps McKenna out of work. He travels to Philadelphia to meet his controller and collect money, some of it counterfeit (for his cover story).

Coal carts are raised up an incline to dump their load so young boys and old men can pick out the stones and other impurities. McKenna is questioned about counterfeit money; he disavows knowledge. The AOH will work for the election of governor (who grants pardons). Another lodge requests assistance with a new manager in Shenandoah. The men vote on his punishment. Three are sent, but it is a trap! There are gunshots but they escape. Can they be identified? ""There may be a spy"" says McKenna. The next day men are arrested and put in jail. They are let go, the police captain wants them caught in the act so alibis can't be used. We see the blighted landscape of a coal town. Can decency alone bring good fortune? ""Violence begets violence"" says the priest at a funeral. A witness says it was the ""Peelers"" who did the crime! How will they react to this provocation?

Kehoe is called by the parish priest with a warning. The Archbishop told him of an informer in their midst! There is a wake for an old man. Kehoe speaks out (for drama). Can he get suit for the deceased? McKenna uses a spade to demolish the interior of this store. Later three men walk out to visit another town. The police are there! They are caught for the murder. The first witness is James McPartlan, detective. These three men are found guilty of murder. McPartlan will be sent to Denver Colorado, [another mining town]. His girl friend rejects him; there are some things she won't do. McPartlan visits Kehoe to talk about his reasons.[Believable?] To seek absolution? ""See you in hell.""

This move was said to be inspired by the book ""Lament for the Molly Maguires"". Those miners never used that name to describe themselves. There is a lot of Hollywood hokum in this movie. You will learn more by reading a good history book. Jack Kehoe owned a tavern, he was no longer a coal miner at this time. He did not take part in a murder like in this movie. Instead, a political persecution was used to convict him of a murder committed a dozen years earlier. In 1977 the Governor of Pennsylvania gave him a posthumous pardon for his unjust conviction. I didn't notice any mention of the Pinkerton Detective Agency. Benjamin Franklin McGowen owned a railroad and coal lands; he used high transportation charges to take over other coal lands. After he overextended himself and couldn't pay his debts he shot himself. One of the sons of Alan Pinkerton met A. Conan Doyle and told him the story; this led to ""The Valley of Fear"". This novel, like ""A Study in Scarlet"", provides an unflattering look at 19th century America. In 1905 McPartlan was involved in trying to frame Big Bill Heywood for the murder of Governor Steunenburg. There is a lot of interesting history that is censored from schoolbooks.",1468972800,,4692,4.567695961995249

He does a great job of doing this in a visually delightful film set in a restored Pennsylvania mining village in the anthracite patch.

252682,4,6300216144,"When Sean Connery decided to quit playing James Bond to pursue other acting roles, his surprising first choice was ""The Molly Maguires,"" a film about as far removed from the Bond universe as possible. Even more surprising, he agreed to take a distinctly supporting role in the movie, one in which co-star Richard Harris has both the big dramatic conflict and the romance. Not surprisingly, the film flopped. However, looking at it today, the film's virtues, not the least of which are the performances of the lead actors, outweigh its flaws.

Maguires is based on a deadly, real life union conflict in the Pennsylvania coal mines in the 1870s. Irish-American miners, rightfully upset at horrendous and dangerous working conditions, reacted by forming a vigilante group called the Molly Maguires and  resorting to violence against the mine owners' property and the Welsh police force the miners hired. Eventually, a number of the miners were convicted of various crimes, including murder, based largely on the testimony of an undercover detective who infiltrated the group.

In the movie, Harris plays the detective and Connery the leader of the Maguires. Obviously, a group like the Maguires required secrecy in which to operate, so Harris initially poses as just another miner seeking work, and it takes nearly half the movie before the group is willing to accept him. While realistic, that scenario isn't the world's most dramatically compelling, so the movie inserts a budding romance between Harris and Samantha Eggar, who runs the boarding house where Harris lives.

Director Martin Ritt, already acclaimed for films like Hud, would have his best success a few years later in Sally Field's union saga ""Norma Rae."" This movie clearly lays the groundwork for the later Field film. We get to see at some length just how depressing and dangerous the mining conditions were, and the way the owners exploited the help. In the film's best scene, miners were given their weekly pay, as the owner recited a long list of deductions for things like equipment and blasting powder, so that the men wound up with pennies on the dollar for the work they performed. In essence, the owners used the miner's wages to offset the expenses of running the owner's business.

The relationship between Harris and Connery works well too, a long feeling out period leading to some genuine affection between the men. This proves difficult for Harris, who winds up becoming conflicted about what he's there to do. On the one hand, he provides the deciding vote in authorizing a murder, a crime that proves to be the beginning of the end for the group, but on the other, he tries to help Connery avoid getting caught.

If the film makers had contented themselves with merely dramatizing the miners' plight and the eventual tragic outcome, the movie would have been considerably better. However, the frequent attempts to turn this into a more-or-less conventional romance between Harris and Eggar fall flat, not because of the actors, but because the romance feels exactly like what it is... a plot device to ""spice up"" the movie.

The Molly Maguires has largely been forgotten today, even by fans of the lead actors. However, in its best sequences, it is a moving portrayal of a sad part of American labor history and a testament to the acting skills of the two leads. Those looking for romance would be best advised to look at other Harris films, but those looking for a solid period drama will find Maguires a melancholy but moving experience.",1396742400,,3521,4.9576271186440675

252768,4,6300216144,"In a post in this space ""In The Time of The ""Robber Barons"" And The Early American Union Movement- The Molly Maguires"", dated February 21, 2007, reviewing a book about these early labor militants, The Molly Maguires, Wayne Broehl, Jr., Harvard University Press, Cambridge,  Ma, 1964, I hit the high points that I want to make about the Molly Maguires and that are reinforced by this commercial film effort starring Sean Connery as a leader of the  Irish coalminers in the Pennsylvania coal fields of the 1870's, the age of the American ""robber baron"" capitalists, their ""Gilded Age"".  This film is also directed by 1950s ""blacklisted' director Martin Ritt (director of the Woody Allen film on the blacklist, ""The Front) so he has a feel for telling labor's story (and providing some very naturalistic cinematography, as well)  I will make additional points about the film below the repost:

""The tale of the famous ""Molly Maguires"" of the Pennsylvania coal fields in the period immediately after the American Civil War is another in the seemingly endless stories of the Irish diaspora triggered by the ruthless policy of the bloody English imperialists, who come what may, refused to part with their colony until forced to by the Irish national liberation fighters of the early 20th century. One can read the Molly Maguire story as one of the first attempts in the post-Civil War period to organize an industry-wide labor union in the coal industry, including its sectionalism, political immaturity and oath-bound secrecy. One can also read it as a story of atomized labor confronted by the consolidation of capitalism in the extractive industries linked up to the carrying trade of the railroads and financed by stockholders here in America and in Britain. Finally one can read the story as a police procedural, highlighting the role of the infamous Pinkerton Detective Agency and its founder Alan Pinkerton in bringing some of the alleged leaders of the ""Mollies"" to trial and execution on behalf of the railroad and coal bosses. That is the route the author of the book under review has taken...""

""Another point to make is how the mainly English capitalists of the area aggravated the already existing antagonisms between ethnic groups, like the Irish, Welsh and Germans (and later the various Slavic groups) to their benefit in a classic example of capitalist ""divide and rule"" policy. Finally, the story points out the key role that privately-employed detective agencies, private police and ultimately state and federal troops played in bringing about the early defeats in the American labor movement (and continue to do so today as about one billion dollars a year is spent on keeping unions out or keeping them docile in the United States, one need only think of Wal-Mart).....""

Sean Connery as a no-nonsense, level-headed, driven, militant labor leader of the benighted Irish Pennsylvania coalminers works here. (Of course, he also ""worked"" as British super-spy James Bond, but we will let that pass.) Jack (Connery's role) tasks are not easy ones as he has to keep the younger hotheads in line, deal with the ""peelers"" (police), deal with planning some kind of strategy that will get labor out from under the thumb of the greedy, very greedy, coal and rail bosses who will stop at noting to break the union efforts.  But most of all, and what forms the dramatic tension of the film, Jack has to deal with one James McFarland (played by Richard Harris), a willing, no, a more than willing, labor ""fink"" who is sent in by the bosses to round up the local labor leaders, and in the end settle scores in the only way that the ""robber barons"" really liked- execute the leaders. (Remember also ""robber baron"" Jim Fisk's old saying-""I will hire one half of the working class to kill the other half.""). Well, in the end they got old Jack, but you know he fought them tooth and nail. We could use a few more Jacks and a few less labor skates these days as we fight the one-sided and uphill class struggle.",1278547200,,4007,4.873715124816447

252770,4,6300216144,"This is a serious film about morality and social injustice and perhaps not surprisingly it flopped at the American box office in the 1960's. Set in the Pennsylvanian coalfields of the 1870's it revolves around two characters:Jack Kehoe, the leader of the Molly Maguires,a secret society dedicated to violently fighting the enormous exploitation that was the lot of the miners working in the coalfield; and James McParlan,who as the undercover agent for the Pinkerton Detective agency is prepared to shed all common notions of human feeling and loyalty in pursuit of a ""higher"" justice and more obviously his own American Dream
There is a strong cast including Frank Finlay and Samantha Eggar giving support to the two leading performances of Sean Connery and Richard Harris who is particularly successful at conveying some of the inner conflicts within his character's situation.
However the real quality of the film lies in other directions. It deserves its oscar nomination for art direction and the authenticity of the set placed in the almost abandoned Pennsylvania town of Ecksly is amazing. The pace of the film is more European than Hollywood and this is particularly evident in the strangely beautiful opening which with its well crafted choice of shots and sequences establishes the background of the drama.
You may choose to side with the underdog refusing to be buried by the industrial machine or you may ultimately judge the Molly Maguires to to be violent thugs and murderers. However, the final shot of the film with the gallows rehearsal as McParlan finally turns his back on all that he has done leaves little doubt that the inner life of this man will have to pay a cost for the deaths he has brought about.
I too enjoyed Henry Mancini's unobtrusive but effective score.
This is an undervalued film that is at last like that other great flop, ""Heaven's Gate"",getting some of the attention it deserves. Indeed the beautifully filmed rugby match between the Welsh and Irish miners performs a similar function to the skating in ""Heaven's Gate"", reflecting something of the spirit and ethos of an immigrant community. Well worth a viewing. There is much to enjoy.",1259193600,,2177,5.016574585635359

252774,4,6300216144,"I bought the DVD of Molly Maguires (1970) to study the branch of my family from eastern Pennsylvania. Much of this film was made in Eckley, Carbon County, where my great-grandmother was born in 1862. My great-grandfather was born in Minersville, Schuylkill County in 1859. He was in charge of the mules that  pulled wagon-loads of coal in the mines. The action of the film opens in 1876.

Jack Kehoe (Sean Connery) and three other miners commit acts of violence against the mine-owners' property. A long strike had failed to better their pay and working conditions. Detective James McParlan (Richard Harris) charms his way into the inner circle to gather evidence against this secret society. To show that he is committed to their cause, McParlan beats up a superintendent so badly that he dies. In retaliation, mining police shoot one of the leaders and his wife, both asleep in bed. Eventually, the three other leaders are tried and convicted of murder with McParlan as chief witness.

Although there is a romance between McParland and Miss Mary Raines (Samantha Eggar), the real emotional bonding is between Kehoe and McParlan. McParlan feels the injustices the miners suffer, but he ultimately sides with law and order. This well-plotted tragedy was a commercial failure and did not advance the careers of Connery and Harris.

Artistically, however, the film has many gripping scenes. During the long opening sequence when the four ""Mollies"" light a long fuse deep in the mine, we wonder if they will reach ground level before the explosion goes off. At a secret meeting when the four tell McParlan to kneel down, we wonder if they are going to shoot him for being a spy. When Kehoe takes a suit from the company store for Mary Raines' dead father, we wonder if McParlan will stop the robbery.

The real Jack Kehoe was not a miner, but the owner of a saloon. In the film, the bartender is played by Malachy McCourt, brother of Frank, the author of ""Angela's Ashes."" At the urging of a great-grandson, Jack Kehoe was pardoned in 1979 by Milton Shapp, then Governor of Pennsylvania. (Some material from Wikipedia.)",1237852800,,2116,4.866666666666666

The Molly Maguires shows an accurate picture of the hard life these people faced and how the mine owners schemed to keep them poor and virtual slaves in company towns. Sean Connery and Richard Harris, along with Samantha Eggar and other Celtic actors do a fine job of showing how the workers pushed back against their mine-owner masters.  The media of the time called them murderers, but in truth, the wretched conditions in the mine towns killed far more than the Mollies ever did.  I've often thought that Sean Connery was good as James Bond, but he grew into a seasoned actor playing in this film.

252817,5,6300216144,"This movie is slow moving and grimly realistic. Although it
was unsuccessful during its original Hollywood release it is an
accurate rendition of the life of coal miners in 1800's Pennsylvania.
  The Molly Maguires were an immigrant Irish terrorist group
who were concentrated in such coal mining locations as Carbon and Schuylkill and a few other counties throughout Pennsylvania in the 1860's and 1870's.
  Sean Connery dominated early James Bond movies so thoroughly
that it misleadingly seems like he is relegated to second-fiddle
status in this interesting film. This movie is the direct antithesis of a James Bond movie. Do not make the mistake of subconsciously rating this film low because it doesn't live up to James Bond movie standards!  This may be the only Hollywood movie to ever explore the Molly Maguires topic.
  Actor Richard Harris portrays an Irish immigrant named
James McParlan who assumes the false imposter identity of a James McKenna
in order to infiltrate the Molly Maguires organization and convict
them of murder.
  In reality my deceased grandfather John Aloysius McKenna's grandfather was Patrick McKenna who was an immigrant from the city of Castlereagh in County Donegal, Ireland. Patrick owned a saloon called ""McKenna's"" in Summit Hill, Pennsylvania (a few miles outside of Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania in Carbon County). My great-great grandfather Patrick McKenna was convicted in 1876 for being an accomplice in the murder of Welsh coal mining supervisor Morgan Powell. Patrick's brother-in-law Thomas P. Fisher (brother of my great-great grandmother Bridget Fisher McKenna)  was one of twenty men who were hung after his conviction in the Molly Maguire murder trials although he denied being guilty all the way to the gallows.
  Actor Richard Harris's reenactment of a fictional James McKenna represented my real McKenna ancestors. Coincidentally my great-grandfather's name was James McKenna (he was one of Patrick McKenna's sons).  My McKenna family is also described in detail in the book by
Allan Pinkerton entitled ""The Mollie Maguires and the Detective"" which was first published in 1877.",1210377600,5,2127,5.370481927710843

252819,5,6300216144,"The Molly Maguires is a film that depicts the history of one of the most notorious and infamous secret societies in history. Many have criticized the film and the content used in it. However, the real truth is that much of the film was edited down from what was originally shot. The film was taken in part by a book written by Arthur Lewis, which, at the time, was the foremost piece of literature available on the subject. To this day, the Molly Maguire mystery/story has scholars and everyday people debating just how much of an impact this alleged group of ruffians, murderers and terrorists had on the labor industry and in the Anthracite coal fields of Northeastern Pennsylvania. The actual story of the Molly Maguires dates back to Ireland hundreds of years before they were acknowledged as the reason for many coal mine-related incidences in the 1870's. The movie picks up around the time the Mollies were facing the end of their run as the most infamous clandestine society ever. The film was directed by often-overlooked Director Martin Ritt. Ritt himself had a deep interest in bringing the story to life, while at the time many others in Hollywood balked at his desire to retell the controversial story. What should have made the film a box office smash was the amazing cast Ritt assembled. Such stars as Sean Connery, Richard Harris (at the time considered the number 1 actor in Hollywood) and Samantha Eggar headline the cast. Ritt chose these individuals because of their roots as being Irish or British in nationality. Ritt wanted only actors with a real background in the culture to bring the character's roles to life. Much of the film was shot in the authentic mining town of Eckley Pennsylvania. Eckely itself had been a mining town for decades and was chosen since most of the small village remained virtually unchanged from its natural appearance of a 19th century mining town. Very little from a production standpoint had to be done to the village to dress it up for a film set. Perhaps one of the most iconic legacies the film left behind was the creation of a large coal breaker prop built at the end of the town to serve as a main focal location for the film. Sadly, despite having the day's top actors, a brilliant director, legendary score creator Henry Mancini, and many other top talents from Hollywood, Paramount Pictures failed to promote the movie in a fitting way, and thanks to semi-confusing plot line, the film was poorly received at the box office. Many wish the film would have been shot in black and white, capturing the vintage essence of the time period perceived in the movie, but instead, it was shot in color. The addition of a love angle between Harris and Eggar also confused some and is believed to have taken away from the film. Sean Connery remarked after seeing a finished print of the film that he wished it would have been handled differently. Also, many outside the labor industry and the area where the events actually took place in the late 1800's were unaware of just who or what the Molly Maguires were. But the film is still widely talked about and is definitely worth at least 1 viewing. It is also available on DVD. It was said to be the director's favorite movie amongst his own works. Check this film out and enjoy. If you can get past the factual mix ups and a little skew of the plot line, you just might enjoy it.",1204156800,,3378,4.641068447412354

But, I love the coal country part of Pennsylvania. From all the stories I have heard first hand from those who group up in coal country in the 20s, this story is an accurate portrayal of the miners struggles with the company owners. It accurately portrays the challenges faced by these working class heroes, and we should all be happy that the story is being told. If we forget this chapter of labor relations within mine country, we will loose a key part of the story of who we have become and where we have come from. The acting is good as well.

SUMMER 2009 UPDATE:
Over the past summer, I visited Jim Thorpe, Pa, where some of the Molly Maguires were held prisoner (and executed?).  Among students of this slice of history, there appeared to be a strong sentiment that the film did NOT treat the Molly Maguires fairly.  So much for my ""The more historically accurate the film, the more it tends to drag"" theory!

JANUARY 2011 UPDATE:
Last weekend, I had my second visit to Jim Thorpe, which I learned was the filming location for the movie's ""trip to the city.""  The former Carbon County Prison (which was indeed the site of several ""Molly Maguire"" trials & executions) is open as the ""Old Jail Museum.""  The museum proprietors, Tom & Betty Lou McBride, have recently published ""Civil War Draft Resistance and the Molly Maguires"" (Christmas City Printing Company, Bethlehem, Pa, 2011), which does not yet seem to be available on Amazon.

They strongly suggest that the Molly Maguire executions of more than a decade later were a retaliation for the Irish draft resistance in Pennsylvania coal country.  Unfortunately, the McBrides fail to note how the Union cemetary at Gettysburg is packed with the graves of Irishmen from New York's Fighting 69th.

At least in the trial/execution of James McDonnell, the McBrides makes a powerful inference of a great injustice having been done (Unfortunately, that book is also used to promote dopey ideas about ghosts in the jail, which Catholics should NOT be promoting.  Delete that stuff, & you vastly improve the book!).  Though the McBrides do not appear to be professional historians, it seems that a tremendous amount of research went into this little book.",1172361600,3,2693,5.767676767676767

In fact, they appeared to have purposely edited the movie to make the audience think that the comment that Richard Harris makes after the service about ""talking back to the priest"" refers to the pleasantries that Sean Connery exchanged with the priest after the service on the way out!

I remember this scene vividly since it when I saw this movie almost 40 years ago now, it was cool to see someone stand up in the church and stand up to the church's hypocrisy.

The cut of this scene also distorts the movies development of the close friendship that the priest held with Sean Connery and how each could act within their roles while retaining their bond.

Odd.

In 1876 Pennsylvania, a group of Irish emigrants working as coalminers are part of a secret organization called the Molly Maguires. After a failed strike attempt, the Mollies resort to murder and sabotage. A detective, James McParlan, is sent in undercover to expose the Mollies and their leaders, but he soon begins to side with the men he is supposed to take down. As tension escalates between the Mollies and police, McParlan must decide which side to take.  I'd never heard of this movie before seeing the dvd, but I really enjoyed it.  It is an excellent period piece that feels very realistic. The cinematography is beautiful throughout, from the depths of the coal mines to the green Pennsylvania mountains, and the musical score is pretty good as well.  However, the movie does drag a bit with some scenes lasting a little too long, but it didn't take away from my overall enjoyment of the movie.  If you're like me, you'd never heard of The Molly Maguires, but don't let that scare you away, it's a very good movie.

  The movie's two stars, Richard Harris and Sean Connery, carry the movie. Harris plays James McParland, the detective working undercover to take down the Mollies.  He must battle his desire to move up in the world with his feelings of respect and understanding that he feels for the Mollies and what they're doing.  Matching Harris is Connery as Jack Kehoe, the local leader of the Mollies who will continue to fight for the coalminers' rights no matter what it takes. He is initially suspicious of McParlan but comes to trust him as their relationship develops.  Samantha Eggar is very good as Mary Raines, the young woman who provides McParlan with room and board and a possible love interest.  The rest of the Molly Maguires the movie focuses on includes Anthony Zerbe, Art Lund, and Anthony Costello, all who provide good support for Connery's Kehoe. Frank Finlay also gives a chilling performance as Davies, the police chief who wants to bring the Molly Maguires to justice, or what he believes is justice.  The DVD is pretty bare-bones, but it's pretty cheap so it's a good buy.  No trailers or documentaries here, just the movie in letterbox.  The movie looks cleaned up, and widescreen is how this movie needs to be seen.

It is notorious in that the man whose character is portrayed by Sean Connery, before being hung, placed his hand on the wall of his cell and swore his innocence.  The handprint can still be seen in the jail, which is now an historic landmark.  It has been scrubbed, sanded, and even painted over -- yet it still shows through.  Now that it is available in DVD form, I am buying it for my husband, who I think will enjoy it.  We both decend from Pennsylvania mining stock -- not Irish, but Jewish!  In fact, during the mining violence of the 1920s, my uncle delivered payroll to the mines.

252867,5,6300216144,"The Molly Maguires is the kind of film that would simply never be made today: a major studio picture about social injustice and betrayal in the coalfields of Pennsylvania in 1876 that became one of the most colossal box-office flops of all time (despite a massive budget and the presence of Sean Connery, it actually grossed even less than John Sayles' low-budget Matewan). Set in the aftermath of a failed strike where a group of miners are trying to win with dynamite what they lost with a strike as their powerlessness turns into violent action, it's a surprisingly bitter film for a studio picture, even in the 1970s. There's no doubting that Richard Harris' infiltrator is damned. Screenwriter Walter Bernstein was blacklisted, and that experience clearly fuels much of the script. Certainly the end, where absolution is denied, recalls Abraham Polonsky's comment that he got through being blacklisted ""because I knew for me one day it would end. For those who named names, it will never end.""

But there's more to his script than mere words: huge sections of the film are played without dialogue - it's 15 minutes before a single word is spoken and 40 before Sean Connery speaks despite his background presence quietly dominating much of the proceedings. James Wong Howe's astounding scope photography is a major asset, quietly confident as it paints with light a real portrait of a time and place, conveying a sense of the way the pits worked in the beautifully timed establishing shots. There's real intelligence in the framing of the film, whether turning a door frame into an impromptu confessional booth or, in the haunting final shot, turning a rehearsal for one man's execution into another man's silent purgatory. Henry Mancini's score, along with The White Dawn his most beautiful and atypical, is another major plus in a seriously undervalued film.

Paramount's DVD is a bare-bones affair - neither the trailer nor the 10-minute short about the film's making shot at the time are included, with only an optional stereo soundtrack as an extra. The 2.35:1 transfer is good, but not quite as good as the previous laserdisc release.",1128470400,9,2144,4.9860335195530725
252868,5,6300216144,"James Wong Howe's cinematography looks beautiful on the restored DVD version of this underrated film, an unearthly intervention which brings us the actual physicality of the 19th century in light and radiance.  It was an era in which electric light was just being invented and candles and gaslight were still the norm, that is, among people with the money to afford them.  The unwashed faces of the coal miners and the families they supported form a canvas from Brueghel, but even the whole weight of the mining companies cannot extinguish the inner spark in their eyes.

Filmed by the Left-leaning director Martin Ritt, freed up from the blacklist that crippled the earlier part of his career, THE MOLLY MAGUIRES finds Ritt at a curious place, picking at the ugly scab of US history that the scandalous MOLLY MAGUIRES represents.  Indeed historians argue whether or not there was ever a conspiracy among Fenians to bring down the oligarchy of the oppressive coal mining companies through so-called ""shillelagh law.""  Ritt was able to attract not only Richard Harris but top-billed Sean Connery to this project; for each of them a commercial risk.  Indeed the movie, re-edited at the studio by nervous bosses, probably doesn't represent the script that Connery and Harris read.  Samantha Eggar, one of the loveliest of 60s screen actresses, took the leading women's role which was turned down by Anjanette (LOVED ONE) Comer.  Oddly enough, thirty years later, Comer took the minor part of ""Sue"" in TV's recreation of the nine miners in Pennsylvania who were rescued from the Quecreek cave-in in the summer of 2002.

Yes, the film is depressing.  Yes, it is slow-moving, sparked by moments of intense brutality.  But give it a chance and savor its unique blend of 1870s locations and 1970 radical filmmaking.",1111708800,30,1807,5.010033444816053
252869,4,6300216144,"Martin Ritt has a central theme that he explores in almost every film he makes. What unites and seperates us? He's become the master of that extremely difficult question and this film, for my money, was one of his best explorations of that theme/question.

It's about the workers and the company- 'the ones who push up or push down- who has more push?', as Connery's character sums up. It's about the choices people make to get up, get ahead or to get out. Ultimately, it's about compromised positions and consequences that come from such compromise.

Connery and Harris are terrific in this movie- the two sides of the coin. Harris has the tough role as the detective 'sent in' who struggles with both sides of the coin. Connery (just as his Bond days were coming to an end), does a slow boil to a funeral scene where he lets it rip. His dad was a soft spoken Irishman, he once said in an interview. I swear he vented something wonderful about the meek and good in this world, in this scene, that rocks with truth. "" They haven't even left him with a proper suit to be buried in! "" Watch him in this- one of Connery's finest performances.

Mancini captures the Irish flavour with a terrific score and Samantha Edgar and Frank Finlay and Anthony Zerbe lend their talents, as well.

Another buried treasure that deserves the sunlight. If you want a good film with some history, some food for thought and some fine performances, treat yourself to this.",1099612800,19,1450,4.565384615384615
252870,5,6300216144,"The spirit of the industrial boom times is captured, but not in a factual way.  With some exageration, and with few facts in order, scenes from the past brought alive in an excellent manner.  Totally worth owning if you like action/suspense!  Sean Connery does an excellent job, as usual, as does the late Richard Harris.  Rumor, with good source, has it that during the making of this film, Harris went to a Hazleton, PA bar and 'hit' on somebody's wife, and was punched out on the spot.  Hazleton, PA, is also the childhood home of Hollywood great, Jack Palance.
......But don't treat this movie as the gospel truth - it's not even close.
Viewed with prior knowledge of the period is the best way to go.  Once again, Hollywood misfires its facts.  Amid the Industrial Revolution, Irish Catholic, in addition to several other ethnic groups (the Irish certainly not the only ones in the mines at the time), worked in horrid conditions when having a job anywhere in the world was an accomplishment, wages were slim, and rarely was there enough to save.  If you can justify the shootings and murders of people in order to exonerate a secret society, masked by an organization (the Ancient Order of Hibernians) that was supposed to be humanitarian - for other Irish Catholics.
This movie is not an accurate portrayal of events, but certainly is entertaining, with a very good glimpse of what coal mining was like for many ethnic groups, including: English, Scots, Welsh, Polish, Italian, German, Bulgarian, and Hungarian individuals, not just Irish Catholics.  Granted, Irish were mistreated, giving Molly Maguires, who definitely existed, a Saintly Status (which is what some people want to do), is truly ridiculous.  They were hanged, caught by another very similar to their own background, in a court system somewhat flawed, red-handed, at a time when few had any tolerance for outlaws and the violence they forced on honest, hardworking communities from many diverse backgrounds.  Glorify the Mollies if you must, but don't confuse them with heroes in an objective light and expect to be treated seriously.  Read up on it, even the local Catholic Priests condemned them by name, ""Molly Maguires,"" making themselves targets and getting brutally beat up for it.  Irish Catholics themselves considered Molly Maguire violence outrageous acts.",1078617600,12,2339,5.044155844155844
252871,4,6300216144,"Having seen this film several times I was very impressed by the acting, particulary Sean Connery and Richard Harris. The Cinemtography was superb, after all James Wong How was easily one of the greatest Cinematographers of the 20th Century. The music was fantascic and Henry Mancini captured the flavor of the 19th Century Irish. However, even though the script as script was powerful and compelling, it was more fiction than fact. Why is it that script writers must take such liberties with history?
The so-called Molly Maguires, a name invented by the publisher of the Miner's Journal newspaper, were in fact a group of men who were fighting for fair conditions in the coal mines, honest pay for honest work. Many of the men, though certainly not all, hanged were, in fact, innocent of the crimes for which they were convicted. These brave men gave their lives for a movement that would eventually lead to the United  Mine Workers of America. However, this being said, the movie is entertaining and certainly worth watching even if only to watch Connery, Harris and the beautiful Anjanette Comer.",1027900800,7,1098,4.935135135135135

BTW, the ""patch"" portrayed in this film is an actual town in Pennsylvania -- Eckley, about 10 miles outside of Hazelton -- and has been restored by the State Museum Commission as a bit of living history.
That being said, a few additional comments:
1. ""It's dark and gloomy..."" -- DUH! IT'S ABOUT LIFE IN A COAL MINE!
2. Walter Bernstein's script did not have the benefit of Kevin Kenny's ""Making Sense of the Molly Maguires"" (1997). If he had, his script would have been very different, because the Mollies were, to a large degree, a fiction devised by Franklin Gowan to justify the virtual slavery of Irish immigrants in his coalfields. Yes, many Irish miners were hung for murder. No, these murders were never proven. These men were labor martyrs.
3. The myth of Molly violence led to the hiring of the Pinkerton Detective Agency, which made its money in the 19th century by infiltrating labor organizations and framing their members (who had the temerity to suggest things like a living wage) on any number of trumped up charges to the authorities. McKenna was a particularly loathsome example of the sort of human dregs they hired.
In short, this is a lost American film classic, as good in its way as John Ford's ""Grapes of Wrath"". It has the power to comfort the afflicted, and afflict the comfortable -- and what better can be said of a work of art?",987638400,111,1700,4.632450331125828

Directed by Martin Ritt in 1970.  The movie is set in Pennsylvania in the year 1876.  The Molly Maguires is an illegal, violent union who took their cover under a legal union of coal miners by the name of, The Ancient Order of the Hibernians.  This movie starts with the Molly Maguires sabotaging and destroying a portion of the mine.  Jack Kehole, played by Sean Connery, is the leader of the Molly Maguires.  Whereas Jack McKenna played by Richard Harris, is a detective sent to uncover the members of the Molly Maguires.  He goes under cover into the mines and befriends the members of the Molly Maguires.  During this period, he befriends them/gains their trust so much that they induct him into the Molly Maguires.  However, in the end, even though it seems like he has taken their side, he has to do his job and testify against them. I believe that this was an accurate portrayal of the hardships and dangerous working conditions that the miners had to endure every single day.  For example, the detective made $9.24 for his first week of work.  When it came down to the nitty gritty he was only paid $0.24 due to all the deductions that were taken out of what he made.  The mines were also dangerous placed to work mainly because of the risks took to having lung problems from the dust.  Also when you do that sort of manual labor everyday there are great possibilities of being hurt. I enjoyed this movie to a certain point.  For starters it had Sean Connery, and I do not know of any movies that he has done that were bad.  He is also not a bad looking man.  But enough about that.  From this movie, The Molly Maguires, I learned about the Molly Maguires in general.  Before hand, I have never heard about them.  I was also unaware of how violent some of these unions were.  I found the fact that they were not caught before they were because many of the people in the town had known who they were.
