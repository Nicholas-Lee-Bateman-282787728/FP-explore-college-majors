4560892,5,B00546032K,"I've been a fan of the tv show for years, so I didn't know how well the show would translate to broadway. Upon watching, I forgot it was even a broadway show! It was great seeing the original characters, as well as some new ones come to life on the live show. I now have a cursh on Sergio, I might add. After about 25 years after the tv show was made, Paul [Pee Wee] is still going strong!
Seeing this just made the the luckiest girl in the wooorrlld :)",1320192000,2,453,3.989010989010989
4560893,5,B00546032K,"Erich Asperschlager, DVD Verdict --The Pee-wee Herman Show on Broadway is a brisk 89-minute love letter to fans, reuniting Pee-wee with the characters and puppets from his stage and TV show. After an opening song and Herman-led Pledge of Allegiance, the curtain parts to reveal an exact replica of the Playhouse. I haven't seen Pee-wee's Playhouse since I was a kid, but when the lights went up on that set, I couldn't help but grin. If I was the kind of person who cheers at my TV, I would have joined the audience in raucous applause.

That infectious joy is the reason Ruebens' TV show became a hit. Like pure id with a red bowtie, Pee-wee Herman's childlike enthusiasm for the world makes everything, from a scrap of foil to a postcard from a pen pal, fun. AAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!! Yes, The Pee-wee Herman Show even has a ""secret word"" of the day: ""Fun.""

Although the show breezes through from beginning to end, it's an amazing juggling act of puppets, performers, props, and sound cues. The filmed performance has the benefit of second takes and reshoots, but the edits only polish an already sparkling gem. Under the direction of Marty Callner, the HBO special adds dynamic camerawork and close-ups to focus attention and punch up the jokes. The combination of stagecraft and TV wizardry makes The Pee-wee Herman Show on Broadway the definitive version of Paul Reubens' triumphant return, and Blu-ray is the definitive way to watch it.

The 1.78:1/1080i AVC-encoded image is packed with detail, from the glittery jewels of Jambi's turban to the fine weave of Pee-wee's signature grey suit. The hi-def presentation is saturated with color, and bright. At times, the image is too bright, with whites that threaten to blow out under the harsh stage lights. The quick camera movements and interlaced picture also result in some motion blur. Still, unless you were at one of these performances or somehow toured the TV set as a kid, you've never seen the Playhouse look better. Instead of surround sound, The Pee-wee Herman Show on Broadway (Blu-ray) audio is in uncompressed PCM stereo--but don't worry. It's a powerhouse mix, creating an open soundscape that feels like it was recorded live, while making sure everything from dialogue to musical numbers to the thousand live sound cues come through with clarity and kick.

The disc's lone bonus feature is a cast commentary with Reubens, Lynne Marie Stewart, Drew Powell, John Moody (who plays Mailman Mike), John Paragon (Jambi, and the voice of Pteri), Josh Meyers (Fireman Phineas, and several puppet voices), Phil LaMarr, Lexy Fridell (the voice of Chairy and Magic Screen), and Lance Roberts (The King of Cartoons, as well as the voice of Globey and one of the flowers). After a quick, standard def intro video for each of the players, the group rockets through the feature with a commentary that's every bit as energetic as the show itself. Reubens is funny, sweet, and genuine in his appreciation for this opportunity. He leads the roundtable discussion, which is full of behind-the-scenes information, comparisons between the old and new stage shows, and general camaraderie--extending beyond the end of the special for three bonus minutes of chat.

4560894,4,B00546032K,"I've been looking forward to seeing this ever since it was announced that HBO was going to tape the show and sell it on DVD and Blu-ray for the masses who couldn't see it live.

It's a quality production and the cast is great. It was nice to see a lot of the original actors resprise their roles (i.e. ""Jambi"", ""Miss Yvonne"", and ""Mailman Mike"")
It's just like watching a ""live"" episode of Pee-Wee's Playhouse (sort of like ""the lost episode"", if you will).

My only real problem with it, is that some of the story elements are cribbed from Pee-Wee's original HBO special from way back in 1981.  --><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pee-Wee-Herman-Show-Live-at-the-Roxy-Theater/dp/B000BZN1L4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pee-Wee Herman Show - Live at the Roxy Theater</a>
Sure, there are a some new characters added and the story is tweaked a bit for an updated audience, but the end result is the same as his last stage production... 30 years ago.
I expected something different after all that time and all the different stories that were played out on the TV series.

That's not to say that this production isn't fun. I was laughing at quite a lot of it (mostly just the new material, though) and I've always enjoyed Pee-Wee, so I don't regret buying this at all.
I was just expecting this to be a totally brand new production with a new story.

If you are a fan of Pee-Wee and loved watching the Playhouse on Satruday mornings, then I would still recommend getting this.
But if you're kind of a passive fan and you've seen the original HBO special he did (that predates the Playhouse), then you might want to see about renting or borrowing this instead of spending money to own it.",1318118400,5,1726,4.917525773195877
4560895,3,B00546032K,"First of all, I'm a huge Pee-Wee fan, and have been for pretty much all my life. I still watch his movies/TV shows regularly and have a handful of his 1980's action figures unopened in my closet. I wasn't fortunate enough to catch his new Broadway stage show live in person, so needless to say, I was thrilled to pick it up on Blu-Ray so I could experience it at home. BUT - and I hate to be the one to say it - having finally seen it for myself I can't help but feel that so many of the positively glowing reviews I read beforehand, from both the press and ""everyday people,"" focused more on the nostalgia angle than the actual content of the show, which ultimately turned out to be very little, I'm afraid. There's a lot to be said for nostalgia and childhood memories, of course - even watching at home in my living room I felt tinges of giddiness when the lights came up to reveal the colorful Playhouse set and I saw Chairy and Conky and Pteri and all the rest of the gang  revitalized for the first time in 20+ years. But that initial excitement can only get you so far, and when it comes down to it, there simply isn't enough interesting material here to keep one's attention for a full 90 minutes.

I think the biggest letdown was the lack of the wink-wink, nudge-nudge kind of humor that Pee-Wee Herman is best known for in the first place. Not that I expected anything quite as racy as his 1981 stage show at the Roxy, but aside from maybe two or three brief scenes (the best being when the power goes out and everyone is looking for a flashlight), it almost seems this was geared towards kids specifically. Yes, all the famous one-liners and catch phrases are here, even the Secret Word game and the Tequila Dance, but some elements are almost painfully overused for the sake of stretching out the running time and masking the fact nothing is actually happening plot-wise. Not that these sorts of things always need to revolve around cohesive storylines, either, but even as a fan on a trip down memory lane, it had me checking my watch more times than I'd like to admit.

That's not to say this was a ""bad"" show necessarily, because technically, everyone involved was on their game. Paul Reubens hasn't aged a day and is spry as ever; and Miss Yvonne is still the most beautiful woman in all of Puppet Land (lol). The puppeteers were amazing with their timing, and the crew in charge of the soundboard came up with some creative effects that really enhanced the visuals of what we were seeing onstage. The guest actors were suitable, if not a little over the top, but in this case I think that was the point. Everybody obviously had their heart in it and it shows, but still, there was a certain spark missing when it came to the script and overall presentation. Nevertheless, the audience seemed energetic and enthralled (as I'm sure I would have been, especially during the final Jambi bit) so I'm just going to chock it up as one of those ""I guess you had to be there"" experiences.",1317859200,10,2996,4.423913043478261
4560896,5,B00546032K,"I have always been a Pee Wee fan and even enlightened my own kids to his movies and show. When we read about his Broadway show (and were visiting New York) there was no way we were going to miss him live!! And the show lived up to every one of our high expectations! Yes, the cast is older, but no less wonderful. The show features some current pop-culture, but mostly lets you relive Pee Wee in all his glory. I felt like I was a guest in the Playhouse!

I understand this was aired on HBO a few times, but I don't have HBO! :( I am so thrilled that it is being released on DVD/Blu-Ray and you better believe I have pre-ordered!!

There is lots of tongue-in-cheek/double entendre stuff here (and Pee Wee's abstinence ring!), but my 11 year old twins laughed the entire time, even if they didn't ""get"" the jokes the same way we older folks did.

4560957,3,B00546032K,"I LOVE Pee Wee Herman, I don't care what anyone says, he lives in the heart of my inner child with almost a sacred reverence. But even that did not help getting me through this show. The excitement I had for this show evaporated quicker than I could contain it.

-Recycling is good for the environment, but crappy for entertainment. For those 5 star reviewers who sang glorious praises for this show, I can almost bet you money that not a single one of those reviewers have ever seen the ORIGINAL, the Roxy Theater version of the Pee Wee Herman show from the 80's. I would say about 70-75% of it was a rip off (some of it was a literal, direct, word for word rip off) of the original show. I was actually counting the instances as I was going along. Let me put it to you this way: if that were a drinking game, I'd have been in serious trouble hahaha :.P

-Adding the latino electrician just felt like it served as ""Hispandering"" and an overextended time-filler, the mute bear role just screamed ""phoned in time filler"" (Mute? Scream? No pun intended, heheh). In fact, I felt the cringe and twinge of overextended jokes/gags more than once while watching this show, it would have been better to have left the show shorter.

-In this version, Miss Yvonne was romantically frustrated over Cowboy Curtis. In the original version, it was Captain Carl. In both versions, the story, dialogue, gags and all PLAYED OUT THE EXACT SAME WAY, just replace (fill in name here) with (fill in name here)...Gee, just move on down the list of eligible male characters, wonder who is it going to be in the next version? Mailman Mike? Skinny fireman dude? Where does the line to date her form? It pains me to say these things because I love her, and Pee Wee's world, though at the same time I feel the characters were not given due justice by the (rehashed) jokes and story.

-The fried Sham-Wow bit was just too dark to find funny :.(

-The overabundance of infomercial references is either a forced approach to (needlessly) prove to the audience how ""relevant"" the show is, or they are incorporating into the show ""a word from their sponsor"" while we are unaware...I don't know about the rest of you fans, but I love Pee Wee's show for what it is. My love is what makes it relevant to me, and odds are you feel the same. That unique, magical mosaic of art, humor and imagination that only Pee Wee's Playhouse had, the only way it can be improved is to MAKE MORE (it ended so abruptly, you remember). IMO, modernization=detraction. I hate to say that it appears that even Paul Rubens had difficulty recapturing that old magic, and it showed on stage...

-Adding an abstinence ring? Where the hell did THAT come from? It did not add to the show, except add questions about Pee Wee I do not wish to know the answers to. As Pee Wee might do...(sticks fingers in ears and goes ""la-la-la-la-la!!"").

-Am I the only one to notice Cowboy Curtis' horse HAD BOOBS AND WORE A CORSET???

-Why bring on Magic Screen if all she(?) is going to do is serve as an uppity know-it-all? Bringing down that projection screen and having Pee Wee ""jump in"" to play with Magic Screen would have helped a great deal (remember in the Playhouse where Magic Screen approached forward ""Pee Wee! Pee Wee! Play with MEEEE!""?).

-The gag where Pee Wee says ""nooooooooo!"" to Jambi was better in the original: Pee Wee exclaims a childish tantrum-like ""no"" so long, he walks around the room with it and returns to stop, there is a second of silence, and just as a bewildered Jambi looked like he was about to say something, Pee Wee repeats his ""nooooo"" around the room, that was funny. Here, it is unnaturally extended (in more than one sense), you can actually watch him breathe while he holds his mouth open.

-The latrine/hand washing bit was originally with Captain Carl (which was funnier, the timing was better). The Mr. Bungle film was also recycled here, but it actually was funnier with the added sound effects whose presence is so obvious, it borderlines painful. Cowboy Curtis' seashell gift and it's ensuing gag originally involved Captain Carl instead, PLUS it included Captain Carl giving Pee Wee his first taste of tobacco.

-Randy plays the role of antagonistic snarky brat better than Pterry, who originally played that role in the 80's version. That attitude better suits Randy's character than Pterry.

-The bit about Jambi's hands were another recycling, except they added a follow-up of busting in on him while washing his hair. The original didn't have that, but I felt it was better to leave it ambiguous, less is more in this case, thereby leaving the humor intact.

The old Pee Wee style humor had more subtly naughty ""wink-wink"" overtones that this version lacks. Here's some irony: the success of this production largely depends on the deepest, most die-hard of Pee Wee Herman fans...yet, only the deepest, most die-hard of Pee Wee Herman fans will recognize this production as a self-plagarization...leaving this deep, die-hard Pee Wee Herman fan not much to muster but a slightly deflated, much more moderate ""Yay"". So yes, while I love Pee Wee and his Playhouse friends (though the latin guy, skinny fireman dude and the mute bear all felt more like impositions), and loved feeling like I was back ""in the playhouse"" again, the re-creation of it on stage actually brought me to tears the first time I saw it, it was that good (But am I the only one to miss the Puppet Land Band?), it was disappointing that they were given nothing better to do than what was (RE)written, even after all these years :.(",1458691200,,5578,4.633603238866397

4561012,3,B00546032K,"Normally a big fan of Pee Wee content, I was looking forward to seeing this.
I remember seeing the 1981 special about 10 years ago and enjoyed it, I've always liked the movies and TV show.. I figured this would be a great watch. And for the most part, I did enjoy it.

The Blu-Ray clocks in at 89 minutes (including a short intro and credits) and I felt that the show may have run a bit better at an hour long.

The set design was perfect -- looked straight out of the 80's show. Almost like the entire set was put into storage and cleaned off, looking good as new. Everything seemed to be in place, the props were all there.. great job and probably one of the best things to see in the special.

Camera work was also good - lots of moving around, different camera angles and cameras setup for specific shots.. they did a nice job filming it!

Video was also good - while only 1080i, I didn't notice the issues some have (with motion). Audio was in english and english closed captions were also included - I didn't see any other issues. Blu-Ray is listed for Regions A, B, C but one of the reviews states it ONLY works in Region A players.

The show plays out as an hour and a half long stage show and they do keep a pretty good flow throughout. My issue with the show is that so much of it was re-used from the 1981 special (Live at the Roxy - available on DVD). What I mean by this are that not only are jokes similar or references to the earlier show, but the same lines are used (almost throughout the special) nearly word-for-word.
The new content making current references (such as 4square and twitter) also came off a bit odd - I was almost expecting to hear ""Myspace"" references in it!

The show is still entertaining (though I did feel it went a bit long), but it would have been nice to see more than the same jokes. Even the ""Mr. Bungle"" short film makes an appearance in this one, while characters from the original show (Captain Carl/Phil Hartman) are missing (for obvious reasons), having some of their jokes/references moved to other characters.

The only extra is an audio commentary (which is a nice bonus). I would really have loved some behind the scenes features such as bringing the playhouse back and making it look so authentic 30 years later.

I was really looking forward to this, but seeing it was almost a word-for-word remake in parts, it left me a bit disappointed.",1438560000,2,2394,4.3640449438202245

I went right to some of John Paragon's material on You Tube. I really hope the movie in production better than this. FYI: I watched the original TV show every Saturday and own the DVDs.

This was just as much fun! I was especially happy to see the original Miss Yvonne and Jambi, and how well Paul Reubens has aged. The funniest part is that this is a redux of a 30-year old show which at the time was a throwback to 30 years earlier in the 1950's, yet it's just as entertaining as ever. Featuring much of the original soundtrack (which has aged well), they also added some great new scenes like the dancing chair and singing flowers (the King of Cartoons intro is classic Broadway entertainment and he is larger than life). Cowboy Curtis filled in wonderfully for the late, great Captain Carl (Phil Hartman). This is must-see material for any Pee-Wee fan!",1382054400,,872,4.422360248447205

I think some of what bothered me was the intense applause and laughter from the audience. It was all nostalgia, in the original the applause and laughter was real, it was happening because what was on stage was truly funny and terrific.

The original play could be watched at any time to any generation and it would make sense. The new play brings in the internet and other technologies/jokes that date it to right now, so when I watch this again ten years from now it'll feel dated.",1361404800,,544,3.9545454545454546
