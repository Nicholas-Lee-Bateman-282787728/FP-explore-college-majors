8080777,1,B000AYEIYK,"I find it interesting that the film maker has to come on this board and give himself a glowing review and 5 stars. I expected no more from a former speechwriter for the Democratic Party. The facts are these. Hollywood is a liberal town. Overwhemingly so. On-screen talent aside, writers, producers, and most in the picture industry have many times proclaimed their allegiance....publicly. Liberals constantly whine about the ""McCarthy"" era which ended over a half century ago but see no duplicity when conservatives are regularly, sometimes happily discriminated against today. For a much clearer and truthful look at the situation, may I suggest Primetime Propaganda by Ben Shapiro. BOTH sides of the aisle weigh in on the subject and anyone who has watched movies or television these past few decades will immediately recognize responsible journalism from the indoctrinated fluff.",1314576000,5,882,5.35251798561151
8080778,5,B000AYEIYK,"The filmmaker, Jesse Moss, did a great job with this film.  Although he is a Democrat, he really took a ""fair and balanced"" perspective.  The best part was Patricia Heaton's story about her dinner with the producers.  Hilarious!",1251849600,2,228,4.947368421052632
8080779,5,B000AYEIYK,"I Tivo'd this off the AMC channel mostly because I've imagined that being a Republican in Hollywood has got to be awkward.  I've always wondered at how famous Hollywood personalities often feel compelled to try and make very liberal views seem mainstream, while suggesting conservative views are wacko.  Ben Stein pretty much said this during this documentary.

I especially liked the five minutes of time respectfully given to the Act One group of screenwriters that hold to Christian views.  Barbara Nicolosi and Dean Batali were featured in that segment, talking about how they can bring hope and uplifting messages to television and film.

Patricia Heaton relates how she was at a party and everyone was bashing the president.  She finally piped up and said that she liked Bush and that both she and her husband voted for him.  Speaking of the aghast looks she got, she says ""It was like I crapped on the table or something.""

Imagine my surprise when the writer/director of this documentary, Jesse Moss, stated that he was a democrat who disagreed with the viewpoints of those he interviewed, but found that he generally liked the folks he interviewed (Drew Carey, Patricia Heaton, Ben Stein, John Milius, etc.).

Finally, a Hollywood documentary worthy of being called Fair and Balanced.",1148601600,19,1293,5.032863849765258
8080780,5,B000AYEIYK,"This remains one of the better and, fittingly, more entertaining political documentaries around.  Moss investigates Hollywood's Republican counterculture with respect and aplomb without playing partisan favorites.

Note: the scathing user reviews here seem to be written by people who have not actually watched the film.",1146096000,14,320,6.088888888888889
8080781,5,B000AYEIYK,"Since I'm biased,  I won't offer a review, but I will point out that  TV critics around the country have described the film as ""entertaining"" (Miami Herald), ""fair and balanced"" (Seattle Post Intelligencer), ""well mannered"" (New York Post) and ""an interesting, honest documentary"" (New York Sun).",1134691200,14,296,5.413043478260869
8080782,1,B000AYEIYK,"Every parent fears their child will one day come out of the closet and announce that he or she is a Republican. We count on liberal Hollywood to set our kids straight. If Toby Maguire is a liberal then it will encourage little Bobby and Sue to be one as well. Unfortunately, there are those in Hollywood who stray from the norm and vote GOP. These people are trying to corrupt our children. Fortunately, celebs like Drew Carey aren't very well liked. Children are our future so, please, protect them from the likes of Pat Sajak.",1127520000,17,528,4.510416666666667
