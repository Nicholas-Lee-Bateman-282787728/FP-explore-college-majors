I got toned and went down 2 sizes in 2 months.  20 years later, I'm picked up some weight and want to loose it.  I remember the Easy Stretch was very nice and stress relieving.  I so order them again (lost the first set over the years)...The only problem and why I'm giving it 4 stars...I have to pay to convert it to DVD.",1456444800,,467,4.043478260869565

7850160,5,6303548849,"Being middle aged and having tried various exercise programs throughout my life time and failing miserably, I can now highly recommend the Starting Simple Series with Greg Smithey.  I am thrilled to find myself looking forward to working out with Greg most mornings, feeling as though I have been ""set up"" for success.  The tapes are designed for folks like me who have to start slow and small and build up strength and confidence.  For the first time I feel like I can succeed at an exercise program, lose weight, tone up and feel better about me.  That's a lot of  positive results just because some exercise tapes were titled ""Easy"" Aerobics, Toning and Stretch----that being the key reason I selected them over so many others.  I'm already wondering what will be next when it is time to step up my routine.  That's certainly a first for me. Thanks Greg for investing in my health and future.",984873600,6,895,4.662420382165605
