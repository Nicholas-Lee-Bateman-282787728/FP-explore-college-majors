8424889,5,B004D7SBLQ,"How do you combine studying the origin of our solar system, the start of life itself, what head, body, and pubic lice tell us about human evolution, and building/erasing memories? Neil Degrasse et al manage to do it in 60 minutes, while both educating and keeping one interested every minute. It's amazing what meteorites, rat research, and lice DNA can tell us about complex, long, long ago topics.",1373846400,,399,4.882352941176471
8424890,5,B004D7SBLQ,"I'll keep it short and sweet ~ ""Where Did We Come From"" is every bit as enjoyable as it is informative, and well worth
watching again.",1372723200,,134,4.1923076923076925
8424891,5,B004D7SBLQ,"This is a great DVD, very informative and entertaining.  I really  liked how the information was shared with the viewer",1372636800,,119,4.9
8424892,5,B004D7SBLQ,"I must confess that I am not a scientist. I majored in philosophy and took entomology to meet my science requirement in college. I got lucky here because lice play a major role in this DVD. Instead of trying to explain everything on this DVD, I will list  the major topics found on it: meteorites, asteroids, Arizona desert, Iron 60 from a supernova, DNA and RNA, Charles Darwin, precooking in volcanic vents, mutations, sensory deprivation, neuroscience and rats, PKM ZETA and hippocanthus.
If you the reader find any of these topics interesting, get this DVD, then write a review for all of the philosophy majors on Amazon.",1359158400,2,625,4.841121495327103
8424893,5,B004D7SBLQ,"Nova science now is just an incredible series, but this is by far my favorite episode. It explains the physics of the universe and the chemistry and biology of life in a way that's understandable to children and still very enjoyable as an adult. Neil Degrasse Tyson is the man.",1323648000,2,277,4.56
