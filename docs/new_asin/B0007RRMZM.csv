8051004,5,B0007RRMZM,"I purchased this video when it was first released in 2005. My youngest son was a 5-year-old at the time. We had a large number of what I would have called ""similar"" videos at the time, hand-me-downs from his two older brothers and other ones purchased new.

I remember the first time we played the DVD: I played it for my son to enjoy and quickly noticed that the music and character banter caught my attention in a unique manner I cannot describe. I turned to notice that it had the same effect on my son.  He probably watched the entire DVD three times in a row or more during that first sitting. It has remained his favorite video for years...

Now Ryan is 10, almost 11 years old. He has Down Syndrome, so he still enjoys some of his ""old"" tapes and DVDs now as much as he did when he was much younger.  ""A Day on the Farm"", by far, remains his favorite.

Ryan stayed at home today (sick) and wanted to watch a ""movie on TV"".  I went through at least a dozen choices of popular movies, including all the Disney favorites, the Wiggles (another of his favs), but nothing met his desires. Then I re-found ""The Old Red Barn - A Day on the Farm"" and he immediately decided that's the one.  Just like old times, he watched it three times through before moving on to something else.

""The Old Red Barn Club - A Day on the Farm"" is simply a far superior entertaining childrens' learning DVD than anything else on the market. It is the one we are most thankful to have in our library. It is THE one we most recommend to add to every young child's video library (and every not-so-young child's library, too).

If only we could convince the creator, Scott Huetteman, to produce another, companion masterpiece! I would buy it without reservation.",1245110400,,1738,4.372670807453416
8051005,5,B0007RRMZM,"I gave this to my grand-nephew who is 16 months old.  He just loves it!!!  After my parents, sister, and newphew saw it, they are buying some for friends and themselves to keep at their house!",1155081600,,192,4.305555555555555
8051006,5,B0007RRMZM,"My son is almost two years old and he absolutely adores The Old Red Barn Club. The show not only showcases life on the farm but includes songs, colors and a variety of learning tools that my son finds fascinating. I highly recommend the Old Barn Club!",1144972800,,251,4.361702127659575
8051007,5,B0007RRMZM,"I sent the video to my grand-nephew for his 1st birthday (April). When I visited this past weekend, we watched the video together. I was drawn in by his excitement. He is just learning to speak. He was so involved with the characters and songs. I would highly recommend this. So refreshing !",1118793600,,291,4.509433962264151
8051008,5,B0007RRMZM,"This is a fantastic dvd for the pre-k/kindergarten age group.  Cute characters, catchy music, and entertaining story lines that blend educational material with real-life lessons.  It's like ""Sesame Street"" without the commercialism and the hype.  You should definitely consider ""The Old Red Barn Club"" if you have small childreb!",1111449600,,329,5.673469387755102
8051009,5,B0007RRMZM,HIGHLY RECOMMEND this DVD which has quickly become a favorite that both my girls (2 and 5) will watch.  Interactive educational TV watching for young kids--that even exposes your child to some Spanish!  The kids like the actual real footage of the animals on the farm as well as seeing other young kids in the program.  This is a nice change from all the computer generated and cartoon animated children's programs out there.  The songs have catchy tunes that the kids love--the 2 year old gets up and likes to dance along.  I'm going to check out the fundraising offer on the website [...] .  It would be a great fundraiser for a nursery school.  Worth getting!,1110844800,,662,4.6068376068376065
8051010,5,B0007RRMZM,"I purchased this DVD as a gift for my nieces, ages 2 and 5.  Since they visit several times each week, I'm always in the market for new ideas.  The Old Red Barn Club is a hit!  That's all we watch - we sing along with Pete and the other characters and enjoy seeing how many shapes and colors we can match!  It's been a great addition to our library.  I hope the producer of this character continues to expand Pete's adventures and as a result, ours!  Great job!",1109289600,,461,4.123595505617978
8051011,5,B0007RRMZM,I watched this movie with my 2 and a half year old son.  He really enjoyed it.  He danced along with the music.  He played along with it too by naming the colors and shapes.  We watched it 2 times in a row and he even asked to watch it again.  I would defintely recommend it to parents with toddler age children.,1108425600,,312,3.967741935483871
8051012,5,B0007RRMZM,"This has been very entertaining for my three children - ages 2, 4 and 6. As they do with their favorites, it has been requested to be watch over and over and ...

Educational and fun. Good music, good message, good characters - a refreshing break from so much of the stuff on t.v. I highly approve and my kids do too.",1108425600,,317,4.112903225806452
8051013,5,B0007RRMZM,"I bought this DVD for my 4 1/2 year old son with the intention of giving it to him for Christmas. The cover artwork was so inviting that as a parent I could not wait and gave it to him as soon as it arrived.  The DVD lived up to its inviting cover and it has become a favorite.  The music is indeed ""toe tapping"" and we often sing the song ""It's time to get up"" Actually I turn on the DVD in the morning to wake my son up and for him to enjoy while I am getting ready for work.  It's a great way to start the day in a cheerful way.  The characters are well developed.  I think your child will enjoy it as much as mine and it's good clean, wholesome entertainment that even Mom enjoys.  The same reason I still like Sesame Street will apply to the Old Red Barn Club.  I hope to see future DVDs because my son would enjoy getting to know the characters.",1108425600,,851,3.9127906976744184
