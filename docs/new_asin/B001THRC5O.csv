3790648,4,B001THRC5O,"Though the introduction was interesting I would of liked more on the Etiquette techniques or manners involved in a social setting, then were given. Such social settings as when one goes to a Tea (with both Gentlemen & Ladies),for their is not much information on that & on Buffets and the proper mechanics in working with them. I learned a lot from this DVD & had wished there was more.",1352246400,,386,4.5285714285714285
3790649,5,B001THRC5O,"I was taught of course how to eat, but not the art of formal dining, which became a problem when a client invited me to a formal dinner party.  Since the idea of all those knives and forks and courses intimidated me, I immediately purchased this DVD and thoroughly studied it before attending the dinner.  I can honestly say that because of this I was very comfortable.

There were only two things that surprised me that were left out of this DVD: one was that when a lady excused herself to go to the powder room, the men at the table didn't rise, which did occur at the party I attended.  The other was that after dinner coffee served in the living room was not shown.  I just watched the other people and got the hang of it, but if Mrs. Watkins ever re-does this video, it's my polite suggestion that she add these two things.  Otherwise, VERY well done.",1350345600,2,857,4.325
3790650,5,B001THRC5O,"Her voice, her poise, the way she communicate with the kids catch totally their attention. My daughter was ipnotized while watching it. I love it. She now said can avoid remember everything she watched on the video. It just come to her mind, then she tried to apply it in her every day life.
Thank you.",1340150400,,302,4.410714285714286
3790651,5,B001THRC5O,"Everyone should know the basic etiquette in this DVD. It was worth ever penny. A little snooty, but the kids really listened and related to material covered.",1330560000,,157,4.851851851851852
3790652,5,B001THRC5O,"I really like this DVD. ""Kindness is a Lifestyle"" Exactly what I would like to receive and also to give to other people.  And Certainly wish for my children to be know for their polite manners too! We are reviewing good manners before we visit with family this Christmas. Last Christmas my children did not know all the good table manners that they should have been using, even though they were sitting at the kid table. I felt embarrassed that I had not taught them better. So I'm correcting that situation now. We just finished watching the DVD of Formal Dining and my 10 year old said she must watch it again as there was a lot of information and she can not remember it all. I would recommend this DVD as it shows the formal table setting and it also explains the less formal setting. And there are mini reviews after each segment to help enforce the major points to remember and practice. I'm sure this will improve all our manners at the table when at home or when out in public. I also liked the DVD because it shows the children using their good manners too. And then I'm able to stop and explain how or what a restaurant may do with a hot towel instead of a water bowl. We are going to practice what we have seen by taking turns with being the server to place the food plates onto the table and to remove them as this will help reinforce this when we are out at a restaurant too.",1323907200,4,1388,4.257575757575758
3790653,5,B001THRC5O,"I purchased two  CD's for my two children, who are attending college in Charleston, SC and Dallas,TX.  They  both  watched the quick etiquette course with their dorm mates. It was surprising how many comments I received from their friends.  They all loved it!  Thank goodness this younger generation has not drifted too far away from their traditional  upbringing.",1272153600,6,364,5.172413793103448
3790654,5,B001THRC5O,"For any doubters out there, this DVD perfectly illustrates why manners continue to be relevant in today's busy world.  The ceremony of formal dining, as demonstrated in this film, provides a setting where respect and kindness are the focus of all interactions.  The secret here is that manners, especially those perfected through formal dining, can easily be applied to any gathering, formal or informal.  As a twenty-something guy, I've found that both business and social events are always more enjoyable (or successful) when I'm familiar with what is expected of me.  Also worth noting is that Mrs. Watkins, along with her exceptionally cheerful and well-mannered dinner guests, propels this film with her grace and subtle sense of humor.  Thank you!",1238371200,10,753,5.241666666666666
3790655,5,B001THRC5O,"This documentary about table manners and fine dining etiquette reminds us all of the finer things in life; a perfect way to introduce children, teenagers, and adults to social etiquette. The film shows both children and adults dining. Mrs. Watkins does a great job explaining, and more importantly, showing how to sit at the table, eat a variety of different dishes properly, make conversation, deal with waiters and table settings, and everything else you need to know. A definite must have for children, and equally good for adults who need to brush up on table manners for important business dinners or trips abroad.",1235088000,12,619,5.019417475728155

8341446,3,B001THRC5O,"I really wanted to brush up on Western table manners, so I decided to buy this DVD after reading great reviews.
This DVD teaches in depth table manners and very very educational.

However, the lady who created the DVD seems a little scary because she keeps mentioning ""A well bred person will never make such mistakes..."" when she talks about bad examples. Sounded a little offensive.

Regardless of her word choices, you can learn a lot from this DVD.
You will be able to learn surprising details about table manners and brush up your social grace whether you are well-bred or not.",1392595200,5,582,4.696078431372549
8341447,4,B001THRC5O,I used this video for an etiquette class that I was giving and it wasn't the best video but it was realistic and formal without the extra antics.,1390348800,,145,4.214285714285714
8341448,5,B001THRC5O,"This is DVD but has been taped a while ago and now it is turned into a DVD.  It teaches very formal dinning.  Although we don't do formal dining every day, but you never know,  at least when you learn these stuff, if it happens that you are invited to a formal  dinner party you will not be at lost as what to do ten different forks and knives, and glasses !  The DVD is made for kids, but of course any adult can learn form it, it does not have any games or cutesi things in it.  The teaching itself is very formal too.  I bought it for my 13 year old son and I am glad I did it !",1386892800,,581,3.7131147540983607
8341449,1,B001THRC5O,"I should have checked this disc immediately upon receiving it from Amazon. Unfortunately, when we finally sat down to watch it as a family it was long past Amazon's return window. There was no ""Broadwell's Elegant Etiquette for Today's Child & Adult"" on it all. Instead, it's a six-minute Total Gym infomercial hosted by Chuck Norris. Really?! Seriously. I feel justified in shaming Amazon for this poor quality/vendor control.",1384646400,,427,5.202898550724638
8341450,5,B001THRC5O,"I loved this video. People should read about this....It is a good way of educating ourselves. It is not about been snob, but simply to educate.",1374969600,,143,4.538461538461538
8341451,4,B001THRC5O,"Like it or not, there are different social classes in America and this DVD is a shining example of such.  If you want to know what people in the highest echelons of (Southern?) society are actually thinking when you are eating dinner with them, then this is for you.  While some may find the nature of this DVD to be pretentious or offensive, I appreciate Ms. Broadwell taking the time to pass along her knowledge of  this exclusive world so others can see and learn.  You will not find this kind of etiquette instruction anywhere else - enlightening.",1365897600,,551,4.591836734693878
