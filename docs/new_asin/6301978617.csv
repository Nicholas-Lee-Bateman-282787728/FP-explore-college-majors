415664,4,6301978617,"Released in September 1969 after the culmination of his artistic resurrection, ""The Trouble With Girls""  is a hidden gem in the Elvis filmography. This charming, offbeat comedy-drama about a traveling medicine show remains among Presley's finest efforts. The 1920s setting is beautifully evoked, complemented by an excellent supporting cast (including Sheree North, Edward Andrews, Vincent Price, John Carradine). For once, Elvis is part of an acting ensemble and delivers a refreshingly mature performance. He also sings a standout rendition of ""Swing Down Sweet Chariot""  one of the few gospel numbers Elvis performed on film. Because of its misleading title, ""The Trouble With Girls"" continues to be sadly overlooked.",1097971200,10,720,5.657407407407407
415665,5,6301978617,"OK, we all know that Elvis starred in some pretty bad movies.  However, every one of them MADE money.  What other actor can say that about their movies?  Not very many.  This is one of his better roles.  The great thing about this DVD is the print that was used.  The picture is VERY clear and crisp.  The audio is mono (but you can play around with it if you have a surround sound system) but also very clear.  Elvis sings a few very good songs (""Clean up your own back yard"" is one of my favorites).  Elvis in good form - some laughs - some good acting.  An all-around good time to be had by all.  Again, the picture is the story of this DVD - such a BIG difference from the VHS.  Warner is to be complemented on this and the ""Double Trouble"" DVD.  I hope the boxed set with 6 movies (a re-re-re-re-re-release of ""Jailhouse Rock"" and ""Viva Las Vegas"") along with 4 others to be released later this month have the quality of picture and sound as these two have.",1092441600,10,962,4.163043478260869
415666,4,6301978617,"Forget the stupid title (which has nothing to do with the story) and enjoy one of Elvis Presley's best movies. A recent Los Angeles Times review ranked this 1969 effort as a ""turkey"" along the lines of ""Harum Scarum"" and ""Spinout."" The reviewer obviously did not see this charming 1920s period piece, which is remarkably different from most Elvis films. Highly recommended.",1091750400,23,373,5.032258064516129
415667,4,6301978617,"""The Trouble With Girls"" brings on a big change of pace for Elvis as he plays the manager of a tent show who has a lot of trouble coming his way. Mainly when the local pharmacist played by Dabney Coleman is murdered, and efforts are made to track the killer down. Sounds like a mystery. Elvis finally solves the mystery and has caught the crook who definetly needed to sober up. You want to see something pecaueful in this picture is, where Marlyn Mason finds Elvis in a close-up shot playing the piano and singing ""Almost"", as the tent show Chautauqua is about to pull out of town. This is not a cheap film. There were over 400 extras used, lots of special effects, and lots of costumes. By the way, what the heck is Marlyn Mason saying to Elvis when the firecrackers go off? It didn't sound pleasent. In a unique film, due to Elvis only showing up in only half the picture, Elvis looks good in the sleek white suit. I'm going to get me one of those.",1037059200,10,951,4.288888888888889
415668,4,6301978617,"The Trouble With Girls was a pleasant change of pace for Elvis, who had long grown weary of the typical formula flicks, regardless of how well they did at the box office.
The light comedy had a good story to it, and the 1927 setting was great. Elvis is the manager of the traveling Chautauqua, and he blends in well with the rest of the performers, highlighted by Vincent Price, Dabney Coleman and John Carradine.
It was nice to see the movie not centered totally around Elvis' singing, although his rendition of ""Swing Down Sweet Chariot"" was really motivating. ""Clean up Your Own Back Yard"" was a great song as well, especially when compared to some stinkers he had done in recent movies.
I read where they were originally going to call the movie ""The Chautauqua."" They should have done so. I agree with another reviewer who said ""The Trouble With Girls,"" is a deceiving title, making people think it's an ""Elvis"" movie. This has indeed made it one of his more forgotten and underappreciated efforts. Elvis was in the best physical shape of his life, having come off of the filming of his comeback special, he obviously enjoyed making a different type of movie, and he put more effort into it knowing that his comeback to the stage was just over the horizon once he finished filming ""Change of Habit.""
And we even see Elvis smoking a cigar. To my knowledge, that is the only time Elvis was seen smoking on screen. Definitely a change from his squeaky clean image from the ""Blue Hawaii"" days.
See this movie. It won't win any awards, but it lets Elvis fans see him in a different light as his movie career came to an end.",1007942400,34,1622,4.539249146757679
415669,4,6301978617,"Elvis is so cool. In a lot of his movies, though, you'd never know it. Don't get me wrong. I love him in all of his movies (big fan, here) but let's face it. He's a cornball in most of his movies. Most of his movies. Not Live a little, Love a little. And Definitely not this one. Elvis might be at his absolute coolest in this one. The story is entertaining, but it's one that you need to watch all the way through in order to enjoy; miss a few spots, and you'll lose interest. Big deal, though. Make your snacks in advance, go potty, then sit down and watch the movie from beginning to finish. You'll be given a treat as far as the story goes, but then you'll get a bonus: Elvis singing Clean Up Your Own Backyard. For this scene alone, the movie is definitely worth the price. The song is cool, and Elvis is just so damn laid back singin' a little Rockabilly...and the camerawork for this song is totally socks. It really is.
It's not a typical Elvis movie like Worlds Fair or Girl Happy or Spinout or even Paradise, Hawaiian Style. But it's very cool in its own way.
You'll dig it, and you'll appreciate how absolutely effortlessly cool the King is.
Rock on, baby.",992822400,4,1167,4.261261261261262
415670,3,6301978617,"It's funny to consider a movie title suggesting the SAME OL'-SAME OL' ELVIS MOVIE, when the actual movie is such a success in a new arena: it's Elvis Presley in an admittedly light but enjoyable old-timey comedy/drama  with decent tunes. The project was previously discussed with Dick Van Dyke  in mind, and that would have been interesting, but he couldn't touch Elvis  on ""Clean Up Your Own Backyard"" - just kidding. (Actually the  anachronistic country blues rocker is another plus for this enterprise).  The fine cast is well-utilized and the art direction is impressive. Marilyn  Mason, Sheree North, Dabney Coleman and others work well with Elvis.",961027200,6,653,5.113207547169812
415671,2,6301978617,"The second film in which Elvis plays a character named Walter (the first was ""Kid Galahad"", ""The Trouble With Girls"" is a snooze, but a worthy  addition to the King's filmography if only because it represents a complete  change of pace from most of his other 1960's vehicles.  Set in the 1920s,  he's the manager of a  travelling tent show rocked by assorted scandals,  and he's surrounded by a cast of solid professionals (Vincent Price appears  in a cameo).  Slim, relaxed, and impeccably dressed
in a white suit,  Elvis looks better here than he has in a decade, and it's no wonder.  By  the time this film entered production, the TV special that would represent  his return from the ashes of low-budget Hollywood pap, was already in the  can, and he had only one more movie to go (""Change of Habit"") before  bidding adieu to the film capital that saw him as nothing more than bait to  reel in an often undiscriminating teenaged audience.",928108800,7,941,4.652439024390244

I just wanted to see the minute-long scene where that smallest Brady Bunch girl became a star.  An adorable sweet close-up and Star Turn.  Who can resist a long-gone era or a dream girl with pigtails?  Explosions become jokes and POLLYANNA lives!  Little Buffy is there too.  BUT HEY!  Half-way through this movie, there is a body floating in a pond.  When I first reviewed this movie, I had stopped after the cameos I wanted to see.  When I watched the whole movie, I was disgusted.  Lots of sick jokes and harsh language.  What seemed like a Disney-type movie had degenerated into ugliness.  I liked showing college-football men as idiots--a touch of reality.  But please don't bring sexism back as a joke.  The framing narration is in poor taste.  Not for kids, unless you want to STOP in the middle before the murder.",1452124800,,959,4.579881656804734

415789,4,6301978617,"..I bought this because I've been a devout fan of Anissa Jones (who played Buffy on ""Family Affair"") since I was in diapers. Aside from the sitcom and a cameo on another Don Fedderson production called ""To Rome with Love"", this role as Carol Bix is the only other credit to Anissa Jones' acting career. And, outside of her typecast 'Buffy' persona, she really does shine, and after you see this, it's no wonder she did try her hand at other acting roles following Family Affair's demise (and was coldly, flatly turned down by producers and directors) amid the early days of the 'Rural Purge'. She's candid, funny, matter-of-factly, earthly...and always adorable with her natural charm. Her talent is often showcased, along with that of her 'replacement', Susan Olsen (uncredited here, she becomes Cindy Brady, of course) and another young star, Pepe Brown, who promptly vanished into obscurity two years later. Fans of Family Affair will enjoy having this in their collection.

Yup it's even worse than 'Change of Habit' which was so bad that it was actually quite watchable and sort of enjoyable.

415907,5,6301978617,"It had been years since seeing ""The Trouble with Girls,' but I remembered it was the only Elvis Presley film my father actually liked (he grinned from ear to ear, belly laughing through it). By the opening credits, you already know everyone meant business in making this film; from the costuming to production values to writing to acting to budget). This is no ""Stay Away, Joe!""

Interestingly, Elvis is completely relaxed in a way he rarely seems to be in the bulk of his films from the mid-to-late sixties. He's a little rougher around the edges (a newfound love of cigars), but it all works. He's both invested and confident (perhaps knowing he was soon to depart to a new phase of his career after his '68 Comeback Special). Upon watching this particular film, one might agree Elvis certainly could have handled the acting gravitas needed to pull off ""A Star is Born"" in 1975, perhaps very realistically garnering his first Oscar nomination. Sadly, it wasn't to be.

But, ""The Trouble with Girls"", along with ""Wild in the Country"" (1961), and ""King Creole"" (1958), feature an Elvis where, upon watching, it's hard to remember how anyone could have viewed him as a poor actor. Of course, all three of these films share common variables: serious actors, talented direction, a tight script, and invested professionals from art design cinematography to costumes.

If none of that is enough, it's worth mentioning Elvis is better looking than a thousand movie stars in this film. He is at his physical and charismatic peak in 1969.

Presley plays Walter Hale, manager of the traveling ""Chautauqua"" tent-show, circa. 1927, who gets mixed up in the lives of the residents of the latest town to host the show.  Hale finds himself falling in love with Charlene (Marlyn Mason), organiser of the children's activities; whilst trying to help local single mother Nita Bix (Sheree North) when she murders her nasty married boyfriend (Dabney Coleman).  Presley's numbers include ""Swing Down Sweet Chariot"" and ""Clean Up Your Own Backyard"".

It's certainly a lot better than some of the other Elvis films from the same period; and seeing Elvis in a more traditional musical is a great treat.  Marlyn Mason, probably one of Presley's most formidable leading-ladies, is stunning (and her rendition of ""Sign of the Zodiac"" is a knockout).  Nicole Jaffe (as the amorous hotel clerk), Vincent Price (eccentric speaker ""Mr Morality""), John Carradine (as a colourful Shakespearian actor), Joyce van Patten (disgruntled former channel swimmer Maude) and Edward Andrews (as Hale's beleaguered assistant) are also fine.  Fans of classic TV shows should keep an eye out for Anissa Jones (""Family Affair"") and Susan Olsen (""The Brady Bunch"").",1147478400,2,1359,5.322429906542056
415911,4,6301978617,"To start with, the film's title gives no indication whatsoever of  the film's content, and can be seen as a cynical ploy to attract a greater box office audience. This may have been achieved (although whether The Trouble With Girls made money is debatable, as the sheer size of the cast, and the period costumes, vehicles and settings would have made this anything but a low-budget outing), but it was at the expense of the film's reputation. It is unfairly criticised among hardcore Elvis fans as a stinker among his movies, when in reality it is certainly one of the five best that he appears in. The King is cool, assured, and in control. And he looks better than ever.

It's easy to imagine many Elvis fans, expecting another Girl Happy type piece of fluff, might have been disillusioned having seen this picture. It is like no other Elvis film. The scenes involving Elvis in the first half of the film are quite sparse, yet virtually throughout the film is extremely ""busy"". It is one of the very few Elvis films that does not have a title song, and has only very few songs at all, but those that do appear are of excellent quality. There is no romantic interest for Elvis at all, even though there does appear to be some chemistry between the King and the cute and feisty Marlyn Mason (who comes close to stealing the show), to the point where they even have a snog at one stage, this aspect is not developed in the story. Just when you think Elvis has tamed the tigress, she's back screaming at him again.

In the first half of the film (on initial viewing) so many characters are introduced and so much is happening it is quite difficult to follow the main plot of the story.

The film veers into slapstick on several occasions, and some scenes are quite bizarre, such as the scene leading to the discovery of the body where a female long distance swimmer enters into a lengthy discourse on the advantages of axle grease over goose fat as a body coating.

There is so much happening in this film, it must be watched carefully, and I suspect would reward repeated viewings. Amusing elements abound. The awkward and frumpy young lady who literally falls over herself to be noticed by Elvis's character in order to get into the show (and succeeds in doing so) is a hoot. As too is Johnny, Elvis's co-manager, who seems to cause more trouble for the King than anyone else.

The period settings and constumes are immaculately executed.

This is one Elvis film you can get your teeth into.",1136332800,6,2491,4.546875
415912,1,6301978617,"This is certainly the WORST movie that Elvis had anything to do with, unless you count the final televised which can be just as disturbing and difficult to watch at this ""ATOMIC"" bomb. I enjoyed SEEING the sweet little Anissa Jones, John Carradine, Dabney Coleman, and Vincent Price, but beyond that this movie is absolutely unbearable. Please avoid even VIEWING it. Bottom of the trash can, literally.",1108252800,5,402,5.014925373134329
415913,3,6301978617,"I found this to be quite entertaining.  What raises this above the usual dreadful Elvis movies is:  the cast is better than average (Marlyn Mason, Dabney coleman, Sheree North, Vincent Price, etc.), the songs fit the context of the movie and there is quality not quantity (of songs).  Elvis got mired in light musical comedy - more often than not it didn't work.  If  he had only made a few movies of this quality (and less like Paradise Hawaiian Style and Girls, Girls) I don't think his career would have suffered so much.  I agree with another reviewer about the quality of the picture and disc - a good reissue.  Worth checking out.",1105315200,9,636,4.575221238938053
