8706033,4,B00UGPWC7I,"Being that it is a Tinto Brass film, it will have frequent nudity, some quite explicit.  The character of Lola is portrayed by a very attractive young actress, who is a monster flirt.  She is about to be married, and her beau abstains from sex until marriage, which isn't what Lola wants.  The film covers a few days and ends with the wedding dance.  It is actually quite a charming movie, and viewers will be charmed by Lola.  The movie is 101 minutes in length, so I do not know how it compares to the directors cut also offered on Amazon.  This DVD states it is unrated (and would probably get either a very strong R or an easy NC-17), it is uncensored and states on the jacket it is the complete widescreen version.  The DVD had a couple of glitches in the form of a couple of freezes for less then a second each time.",1521676800,,822,4.230769230769231
