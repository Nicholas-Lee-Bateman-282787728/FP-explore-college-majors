8275982,2,B001A4CUZI,This is definitely not worth the price.. There are actually 152 episodes in the fist of the north star series.. I bought mine off of eBay for 69.90.. You can't beat that price and it's the entire collection.. Sorry but amazon needs to work on some of there prices.. This item ships from Malaysia... I gave it a two star rating because I love the series.. Enjoy and it's english sub...,1259884800,4,384,4.422535211267606
8275983,1,B001A4CUZI,"....this collection deserves a rating below 1.

False in advertising by being called the ""Complete Collection."" This is only the first chapter of this amazing series. If you don't have time to dedicate to a 100+ episode series, then this is perfect for you. Otherwise search the net to find the complete box set but be warned of imitations and be prepared to read a LOT of nonsensical English. It is very difficult to get complete collections of imports, especially of series that are close to 30 years old but it is well worth the time, money and effort to track down the entire series. Happy hunting.",1256428800,6,602,4.626168224299065
8275984,1,B001A4CUZI,"Lies and misrepresentation. Hmm 109 episodes of this TV series was created, however only 36 were ever dub for DVD release. Yes the complete 5 volumes only has 36 out of the 109 episode. See Manga entertainment held on to rights of the TV series for years, however there laziness and inability to ever finish anything led to this shameful offering. Don't get me wrong this is the bench mark of all action anime, and the translation is quite admirable. However the lack of the remaining 73 episodes is a slap in the face to all fans.",1231891200,9,531,4.484536082474227
