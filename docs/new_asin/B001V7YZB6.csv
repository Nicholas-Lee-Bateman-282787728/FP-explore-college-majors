3819677,5,B001V7YZB6,"My only regret is that, as far as I can tell, there are only two seasons of this show. This is the original UK Kitchen Nightmares, which takes place in little cafes, B&B's and bistros in locations like Blackpool and Cardiff. Although Ramsay is acerbic, confrontational and challenging as ever, he's gentler than he is in the American shows he's been in since. In my view, this makes his outbursts all the more entertaining, and the drama more real.

If you're anything of an Anglophile, and/or find cooking shows entertaining, you'd enjoy these. They include plenty of dramatic chef-on-chef fighting while showing us inside English, Scottish and Welsh kitchens... anyone fancy a steak and kidney pie?",1320710400,2,700,5.0344827586206895
3819678,5,B001V7YZB6,"The US version of KITCHEN NIGHTMARE'S is a huge hit and honestly what introduced me to Mr. Gordon Ramsay.  I have been enthralled since by his personality, talent, skill and passion with food.  With this dvd all I can say is it is amazing how much better the British version of this series is.  And this season is even better than the first.  The show is all Ramsay from voiceover to his full involvement with each restaurant he visits.  These restaurants are in trouble and have asked for his help.  The candor, wit and intelligence with which he proceeds with each new venture is enthralling.  He is able to identify problems immediately and allows us, the viewer, to see what goes on behind the scene in many restaurants.  He provides his usual tough love and takes each establishment with its owners/workers on a reality check.  Sometimes he comes across tough egos or wimpering weaklings but bottom line is that with his usual dedication and true caring passion he helps all to see the light.  The thing with Gordon Ramsay is that he is known for his slight foul mouth but this is who he is and when he speaks it is the truth.

He helps each restaurant identify problems, helps make things better but does not leave it at that.  He tries to make them truly understand the nature of the problems so that they can go on succesfully after he leaves.  The viewer can't help but get truly caught up in Ramsay's truly caring dedication to help these people.  This show could be gimmicky and make an emphasis of only shoewing sickening things in bad restaurants.  We do see much that is bad but only as long as it is necessary.  Gordon will try to make a different life for these people.  One worker in a restaurant said he was sent from above.  It can seem that way.  Thes restaurants are on the verge of closing and clueless.  Ramsay has much skill and knowledge and can make them see the light.  Through his typical tough love and candor he reaches that deep spot that is most effective.

I can't get enough Gordon Ramsay.  Not only does he have the craft and knowledge but a hugely entertaing personality that adds a wallop of fun to each episode.  I find all Ramsay's shows addictive and this one is the absolute best.  I highly recommend this show and this season.  Also, I love how British tv spends less time censoring as we do.  it helps us to truly see the people for who they are.",1273363200,8,2389,4.457274826789838
3819679,5,B001V7YZB6,Our family enjoy watching Gordon Ramsey in all his programs either on US TV or BBC.  The DVD's are uncut so language may be an issue for some but we find them funny and entertaining. It's always fun to see what goes on behind the scenes and you learn what goes on behind those double doors into the professional kitchen.,1267056000,,320,4.333333333333333
3819680,5,B001V7YZB6,"Wonderful !!!

I enjoyed the series on television and now enjoy watching at my leisure.  Gordon is a riot, totally melodramatic, but each show comes together well and despite the theatrics one can appreciate his skill and strength in the kitchen - he knows what he is talking about.  We over-complicate everything.",1264291200,,314,5.0
3819681,4,B001V7YZB6,"If you like Gordon Ramsay; you will enjoy the series and it does improve with age.  Seasons 2 and 3 are more diverse and interesting than Season 1. Just a note for expatriates (like myself). Though one of the benefits of living abroad is avoiding much of the daily 'trash' TV, it does mean that you may not be familiar with many of the 'celebrities' who guest on the show.  (It is interesting to watch these 'celebs' who are unknown to you as, stripped of their fame, you can evaluate these personalities and their talents objectively.  Almost without exception, their only virtue appears to be their celeb status and most have no entertainment value or visible talent at all.)  Fortunately, their appearances tend to be brief and it's a DVD; you can always fast forward.",1260662400,,771,4.688888888888889

Bonus: Biography of Gordon Ramsay

No wonder this won an International Emmy Award.  Part comedy, part drama, and all reality, this show gives a strikingly unglamorous view into the inner workings of restaurants and the people who run them.  Ramsay shows his unbridled passion for food and hard-won business acumen.  The U.K. series is far superior to the US version, more honest less polished, all real!  Can't wait for Season three!",1252886400,13,655,5.240384615384615

8345660,5,B001V7YZB6,"Gordon Ramsay is really helping REAL people on this show. He does it with brutal( out of necessity) honesty and humour that has me giggling all the way through. It doesn't become formulaic because he addresses the individuals and their unique problems such as problem ingredients, atmosphere,staff without commitment,ignoring customer base our self delusions. With all the complex challenges of running a restaurant, it is a fun and entertaining exercise in problem solving.",1360454400,,474,5.506849315068493

8345662,4,B001V7YZB6,"Season 2's look at La Gondola was fairly enjoyable, because it shows a lot of bad practices in the restaurant business without placing much importance on changing the restaurant itself.  The menu was not simplified nearly as much as other restaurants in the series. Also, I liked the end result.  The piano was a nice touch.",1347408000,,324,4.767857142857143
8345663,5,B001V7YZB6,"The first season was much shorter and had this sense that every restaurant helped ended up going back to old ways and bad habits.  The second season turns that around in the premiere episode, Lanterna.  The restaurant was being run by some boys who really had no respect for Italian food yet wanted to run an Italian-themed restaurant.  Ramsay spotted this contradiction as soon as it came up, and the staff of the restaurant really listened to everything that was said.",1346803200,,470,4.777777777777778
