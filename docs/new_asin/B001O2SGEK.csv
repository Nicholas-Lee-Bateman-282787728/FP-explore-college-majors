8328954,5,B001O2SGEK,"I have to say that when I purchased this movie I really didn't know what I was getting but when I finally saw it I was totally blown away. I'm not really into movies with subtitles well who is. But this film is one that you really don't need to read the subtitles. Had to wait until I purchased an all region dvd player but it was WELL worth the wait. Fantasy films and family films are very hard to find. I am a fantasy film LOVER. I adore Narnia, Harry Potter, type films. The only thing is that you have to hunt these films out, ones like Island of Lost Souls. I'm a movie buff and it took ALOT of time and research to find this movie. One of the best danish directors right now is Nikolaj Arcel! This guy is surely capable of directing one of those big blockbusters. His attention for details are huge, and you can feel it throughout the movie that he likes what he is doing.

If you like Harry Potter or Chronicles of Narnia, you will absolutely love this movie! The plot is one of those good old adventures about the battle between the good and the evil, souls, ghosts, dark creatures and evil sorcerer. For a Danish film, the visual effects are amazingly. They are insanely well done,it BLEW me away and is just as good or perhaps better than the effects of the rescent Narnia & Potter-movies.

The acting is FILLED with emotion, considering we are dealing with teenagers and small children. The older actors are some of the best danish actors right now, Anders W. Berthelsen is always a pleasure to watch, and Lars Mikkelsen is frightening as the Necromancer. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to ANYONE who likes Harry Potter or the Chronicles of Narnia. The imagination that went into this film rocked and they gave alot of thought to the execution of it. I had a hard time taking my eyes off the screen and trust me once the film introduces the characters you will fall in love with this movie.",1312416000,4,1901,4.38243626062323
