7999863,3,B0000D1FGX,"When ""The Bloody Brood"" began my expectations were low.  I soon found myself moderately engaged with the story thanks largely to the lead actors.  There's a reason so many people know the name Peter Falk, and the reason this movie might be worth watching is due more to him than any other single person.  Yet I would be remiss if I didn't give Jack Betts some credit.  Here again is guy with a list of credits a mile long (though far less impressive than Falk's) for good reason.  This movie was very early in both their careers (I think it was actually Betts' first movie) so don't take this as me saying it's their best performances ever, the movie is certainly not great; it's just not bad.

Nico is the go-to guy for a drug fix.  The beatniks around him seem obsessed with him (probably mostly for that reason), and he seems to get off on the control it gives him.  He gets a power trip watching someone die and decides he wants to control death which leads him to orchestrate a murder.  Cliff, the brother of Nico's victim, comes looking for answers and narrows the culprit down to Nico's group.  It's a cat and mouse as one tries to avoid getting caught as the other seeks out justice.

This flick is beatnik overload.  The culture is an important part of the plot, but still it becomes almost unbearably too much.  Part of the problem with it is the obsession with Nico. Yeah, I get it, he's virtually worshiped which more or less becomes his own drug; it's important to get that across, but I got tired of hearing Nico this and Nico that every few seconds.  If the rest of the movie had been like this I might have punched my TV in the face.

There isn't much mystery since we know from the very start who did what.  It's more about watching the two sides of the conflict: Nico covering his tracks and Cliff tracking down the killer.  A stronger atmosphere of suspense and danger might have boosted the movie to the next level.  The story itself isn't particularly strong, and there isn't a whole lot of exciting action so you can see why enjoyment of the movie hinges so much on the character portrayals.

Content:
Typical of the B&W movies from this era there is nothing questionable here aside from the concepts of murder and drugs.

DVD:
I have seen 2 copies in different 50 movie mega-packs: Fright Classics and Chilling Classics. The audio is scratchy and a little distorted.  The video is trashy and shifty.  That applies to both prints. Neither offers any extras.

There are a variety of other editions out there, so hopefully they have improved on the A/V quality for the price they tend to ask, but I have yet to find one that I can point to as a guaranteed improvement over the collection prints.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
This is a pretty decent movie despite its drawbacks.  You really need to be a Falk or beatnik movie fan for it to be worth the asking price I see online which is why I recommend going as cheap as possible if you're getting it. 3* out of me.",1518739200,,2973,4.420955882352941

7999866,4,B0000D1FGX,"Like man, dig it.  A young Peter Falk, (32, though he looks younger)complete with that glass-eyed stare plays the mob-like pseudo beatnik Nico.  Along with his Ivy League looking alcoholic pal they feed a delivery boy a hamburger full of ground glass and the action ensues.  The boy dies, and his brother seeks revenge.  Lots of scenes in the beat club, chicks dancing with themselves, and plenty of beat haircuts, poetry, dark rimmed glasses and goatees. A must-have for your beat collection.  COLUMBO: ""Pardon me, is this the scene of the murder? It must be, there's a lot of dead bodies laying around.""",1204156800,,605,4.834951456310679
7999867,3,B0000D1FGX,"Peter Falk is Nico, a smack dealer who poses as the leader of a merry band of beatniks. Nico's not just cool man, he's like crazy baby! He watches an old bum die and decides it is the ultimate kickeroo. Later at a swinging party, complete with goofy dancing, goatees, bongos, and a sea of turtleneck sweaters, Nico and his crony decide to feed an unlucky messenger boy a fatal ground-glass burger just to watch him die. Thankfully, the victim's non-beatnik brother Cliff (Jack Betts) sets out to catch those responsible for his sibling's death. Cliff delves into the dark, dank, terminally hep underbelly of beatnik culture looking for clues. He turns out to be one of the only ones among them with either a conscience or a brain. He is finally helped by a girl (Barbara Lord) who is disillusioned with Nico. Together, they attempt to cramp Nico's style. THE BLOODY BROOD is full of quasi-philosophical musings about life, death, work, etc., and priceless quotes like, ""Did he die, or was he murdered by life?"" WOW! That's deep, man! So, just pull up a floorpillow, put on your sandals and raybans, and tune into the scene! ...",1080777600,5,1127,4.696969696969697
7999868,4,B0000D1FGX,"First, I should mention that the edition I've seen is not this one, but the one put out by SWV - - I mention this, because sometimes same movie/different cut can almost amount to a different movie (even a different ending), but that may not necessarily be the case.  - Whatever, see an unbelievably young Peter Falk make his film acting debut in a North of the border (Canadian) film as a ""cool"" cold blooded drug dealing ""beatnik"" who commits a murder just for the kicks of it.  He does it by feeding ""ground glass"" to a young ""square"" all American type delivery boy, who's brother gets on the case, makes the scene and tries to pin it on him.  - - In all honesty, I had a lot of trouble believing that you could actually kill someone by feeding them glass... so (proving myself to have way to much time on the internet) I looked it up... and one of those ""urban legend"" sights confirmed :  though a popular way of killing someone in many murder/mystery books and movies... it is quite unrealistic... but still, its just a movie right ?
While this film lacks the cool daddy-o finger popping hipness and quirk of my all time favorite ""beatsploitation"" film THE FAT BLACK PUSSYCAT, and at times has all the excitement of a COLUMBO episode (you can tell the director *was* definitely a square) its still a good film if you're a b-movie junky... or you just want to get the kick out of seeing a very young Peter Falk playing the warped leader of a ""beatnik"" gang.  Incidentally,  I kinda dug that Maynard G. Krebs type character... I have a bobble head at my bar in Tokyo that looks just like him !
If you're interested in Beatnik culture in general, check out RHINO'S BEAT GENERATION box [set] while you're at it... and again, SWVs double FEATURE DVD the BLACK CAT which is coupled with THE FAT BLACK PUSSYCAT.",1069286400,13,1808,4.447129909365559
