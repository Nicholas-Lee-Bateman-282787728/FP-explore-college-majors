7800800,5,1878993232,"Fantastic sensationalistic Christian fundie apocalyptic tone blah blah 'documentary' about yoga.

from the mid 1980s

before the internet
before reiki

Before many people knew about Kim Jong-Il and North Korea.
Do you think Hitler is bad?
ha! that's nothing.

What do you think is at the absolute centre of his rule?

Shamanism.

I'm sorry to say it. I'm sorry to be so blunt. I really am very sorry to anybody I am offending.

but it is the truth.

This documentary, sensationalistic or not, exposes and draws attention to one of the most difficult and misunderstood problems of our time.

Religious fanaticism and occult power.

It really does exist.

I study shamanism. It is a passion of mine. I am a practicing shaman. It has irrevocably altered the course of my life. I am the better for it. I found love, happiness, and peace. But not before being hospitalized and going through lots of pain as any shaman should. Not before being lied to.

Indian yoga, compared to the vast field of shamanic studies that I have looked into, was and is an enigma certainly.

Not that I didn't believe in it, or because I hadn't experienced amazing things to do with lifeforce energy, but because it really does, by first appearances, exist outside of the field of shamanism.

Why?

But it isn't, is it? I recommend reading The Five-And-Twenty Tales Of The Genie. This book talks about some ethical dilemmas of practicing sorcery, including what happens to the magic powers of a yogi after he finds the love of his life. He becomes divided and it is the spirit from the cremation grounds, evoking the domain of Shiva, that advises him correctly on what he should do. So, if you think Indian culture is without morals, not so fast, read this and educate yourself. It is on the penguin classics collection label.

After studying vietnamese Len Dong, Korean Muism, and Japanese Shinto I have learned a lot about the psychological dangers and the dawning of psychic powers. I have also learned a lot about how to practice shamanism by yourself, without needing to pay anybody anything.

but it took me the better part of eight years to get to this point where I am in University and have access to quality library services and databases.

the lot of you out there? the common plebeians rummaging through local bookstores?

What do you have?

Nothing. Jack all.

This ought to change..",1349913600,,2370,4.745721271393643
7800801,1,1878993232,"As a Christian and a yoga teacher, I have very mixed feelings about this so-called ""documentary.""  On the one hand, I had quite a good laugh.  It is entertaining, for sure!  On the other hand, it is concerning, in that the film was seriously intended to induce fear - and it has apparently succeeded, based on some of the other reviews.  My concern is that people are being terribly mislead.  The film does make a couple of good points, one being that a person should not allow oneself to be brainwashed and controlled by any guru (including, IMO, the pastor of a fundie church!), and that we ought to worship God, not the ego (my own biggest criticism of the New Age).  However, it also presents an extremely misinformed view of yoga and meditative practices in general.

First, you do NOT have to be a Hindu to practice yoga.  Yoga is a neutral spiritual technology which can be used by persons of any religion, or even no religion.  (See my review of Mark Whitwell's new book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Promise-of-Love-Sex-and-Intimacy-How-a-Simple-Breathing-Practice-Will-Enrich-Your-Life-Forever/dp/1451626312/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Promise of Love, Sex, and Intimacy: How a Simple Breathing Practice Will Enrich Your Life Forever</a>.)  As the film correctly points out, yoga means ""union"" (or ""yoke"") and for the religious person this means union with God - the God of YOUR religion; e.g. for Christians, Jesus said, ""Take my yoke upon you...""  (Mat. 11:29).  But no particular belief is required, and non-religious practitioners simply interpret it as ""unity of mind-body"" or ""wholeness.""

Secondly, the film in fact opposes ANY form of spiritual practice which involves focusing the mind, whether Hindu or otherwise, because if you succeed in quieting the internal chatter for even a moment, demons will rush in!  So even contemplative prayer, the Rosary or the Jesus Prayer would be forbidden, and meditation on Orthodox icons likewise, not only because it may induce altered consciousness, but also because it involves ""idolatry"" (which per this film, includes ANY visualization of the Lord).

But what is truly amazing/amusing is that according to this ""documentary,"" pretty much EVERYTHING IS BAD!  In addition to yoga and meditation, the film covers quite an extensive list of demonic practices including (but not limited to) biofeedback, hypnotism, self-help, psychiatry, holistic medicine, acupuncture, vegetarianism, the game Dungeons and Dragons, and the Star Wars movies - all of which are part of the evil Hindu plot to take over the world, assisted by the Nazis and the United Nations.  So whatever extremely dubious credibility the ""documentary"" might have had, it loses by stretching the limits of rational belief beyond the indulgence of most educated people.

In summary, my concerns are first, that the film may deter Christians from experiencing the physical and spiritual benefits of yoga, and second, that the film makes Christianity look foolish and paranoid to non-Christians.  On a personal note, it was exactly this sort of fundie propaganda that turned me off to Christ in my youth, and it was yoga which eventually brought me back to Him.",1344470400,3,3233,5.391650099403578
7800802,3,1878993232,"I am somewhat torn reviewing this film. I think the material is quite important, if presented in a style that raises other issues. It certainly questions Hinduism rather severely. If a person is into Yoga, Mind/Body techniques or other aspects of New Age thought you are going to feel a straight forward assault. But then again that was the point. Some of the material here is awfully hard to deny. It's well documented. Some of the interview subjects are quite respected. And it fairly interviews people who would are involved with the practices and philosophy described.

Yet at least one interview subject tilts the thing in not merely a Christian direction, there's no getting around the fact that this is a Christian documentary, but in a kind of apocalyptic extremism. Also while I would agree that Star Wars has some watered down New Age thought in it, by the time they started talking about Dungeons and Dragons it seemed like they were trying to rope in too much. And the tone of the narration is far more ominous than it needs to be. It should have just stuck with the facts. Or if making certain connections, like that between Eastern thought and Nazis, it shouldn't have just squished it into the last three minutes of the film with no real documentation.

Nevertheless the actual factual material here is worth pondering. And if it is far more offensive today than it was when it was first made in 1984 it is possible that our society has been influenced far more by these ideas than it was at that time. In 1984 one could still create something to argue about. Today anything that provokes argument is considered problematic. Why? Because of exactly the positive energy vibe that this film dissects quite effectively.

This is quite a valuable film for anyone studying religion or cults in America. If you are among the millions who use yoga as merely a physical discipline watch this at your own risk. 4 points for the information, this being the ONLY documentary to really deal with this subject critically. 2 Points for presentation. = 3 Points split the difference.",1331596800,5,2083,4.7645429362880884
7800803,4,1878993232,"Gods of the New Age is an eye-opening expos&eacute; of the New Age movement and its roots in Hinduism in the form of spiritual gurus, yoga, transcendental meditation, holistic medicine, self-enrichment programs, and other seemingly innocuous eastern ideas becoming more and more prevalent in the west.  Beginning with gurus who have transplanted their teachings to America and Europe, the documentary shows how eastern mysticism in all its trappings conditions its followers into subjection to authority (namely of the guru) and subverts the core teachings of Christianity by encouraging its practitioners to look for God within themselves.  It then goes on to show how the increasingly popular, seemingly ""scientific"" practices of yoga and meditation actually serve to introduce the ideas of Hinduism unknowingly into individuals seeking better health, less stress, etc.  The presentation does reflect a Christian viewpoint - and I believe the presenters take things a little too far toward the end when one expert asserts that popular films such as E.T., Poltergeist, and the Star Wars saga are actually based on Hinduism - but it makes a number of good and incisive points for anyone concerned with personal freedom, individualism, and free will.

According to one of the New Age authorities interviewed in this documentary, freedom in the East is freedom from individuality.  Hinduism is a morally ambivalent religion in which there is no sin, no forgiveness, and thus no hope; suffering is regarded as the lot of the sufferer, a punishment for the mistakes of past lives.  Rather than a source of hope, reincarnation is shown to be a curse within Hinduism from which each soul must attempt to escape - and the fundamental means of escape is linking to the godhead via yoga.  This document puts forth the argument that yoga is at the very core of Hindu belief; the two are so intertwined that individuals practicing yoga for better physical and mental help are exposed to Hindu tenets as part of the process.  Yoga classes, we are told, were designed to realign the serpent force (kundalini) with the body, not physical fitness.  The whole process of finding strength and enlightenment within is compared to the knowledge offered by the serpent to Eve in the Garden of Eden.  The program makes similar arguments for the hidden influences of vegetarianism, holistic medicine, acupuncture, biofeedback, etc.

Of course, the overt danger of eastern influence is best seen in the subjection of self to the will of a guru.  We see and hear from a number of westerners who have fallen sway to self-described gods of Hinduism, giving up everything in cult-like devotion to a ""master"" who commonly indulges in the most lavish of lifestyles with their money.  The most extreme example of this was, of course, the controversial Baghwan Shree Rajneesh who left India to set up shop in Oregon in 1981.  At the time of this documentary (1984), he was perhaps most famous for his collection of scores of Rolls Royce automobiles, but only a year later he was arrested and deported after his ashram fell apart in the wake of a crime wave that included a bioterrorism attack on a local town.  We see how children are essentially left on their own and husbands and wives are divided inside these religious communities, as the guru demands and receives all of the love and devotion each individual is able to give.  Most shocking of all, however, are the video clips we are shown of dynamic meditation sessions in which practitioners work themselves into an animalistic frenzy in the pursuit of spiritual insight.  In terms of the really big picture, the documentary closes by demonstrating the influence of the United Nations in establishing the legitimacy of and expanding the influence of many of these dubious groups as a means for preparing the way for the global submission of man to their authority.

With its numerous interviews with former gurus, past and present ashram members, yoga instructors, New Age authorities, and other primary sources, Gods of the New Age compels the viewer to reexamine the nature of the products of eastern spiritualism so prevalent today.  The documentary goes into great detail on the dangers implicit in the modern merging of science and mysticism.  You may not agree with all of the arguments presented here, but they do make you think.",1310256000,6,4363,5.033333333333333

7800805,5,1878993232,"Just watched this documentary tonight and was very glad I was able to find a copy of it.  It is showing what I have been seeing for years.  The rise of apostasy in the Christian church.  Oh how sad the almighty God of the universe must be to see His people buying into a spirituality that is the counterfeit and follows the serpent from the garden and not God.  This gives an excellent presentation of how this counterfeit spirituality has arisen and placed itself into our own churches.  If you have any questions about odd spritual practices or things that just don't seem like they are of the Holy Spirit, I strongly suggest you buy this film and watch it.

It begins with showing you the poverty of the Indian people whose Hindu religion can be seen as part of the problem.  Then it shows a bit of how the Hindu religion works and what people think about it.  I liked in particular hearing from those who were previously a part of some aspect of Hinduism and had since left that practice.

It then shows how various pieces of Hinduism is entering into our mainstream culture, in the political, educational and church areas.  It covers the practices of mostly Yoga and transcendental meditation (TM).  It shows how it is being repackaged so that we will accept it as a good thing, and not see it as something that could be dangerous and lead us away from the God of the Bible.

It is an excellent work and I thank Jeremiah Films for making it.  I would also recommend that you find the book ""Gods of the New Age"" by Caryl Matrisciana and read it as well.  It will add much to your understanding of what is in the film.",1154995200,11,1621,4.377926421404682
