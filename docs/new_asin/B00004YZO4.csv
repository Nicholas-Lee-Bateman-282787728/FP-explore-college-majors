7927814,2,B00004YZO4,"Here in the East and probably in most of the US, the WCS is a dance done to blues, soul, motown Al Green, Wilson Pickett, etc. (music with a beat and soulful sound). This video is off base. The istructors in their western outfits teach WCS as a country type dance with no emphasis on soul, rythym or blues (the heart of this dance). When not laughing, giggling or cracking corny jokes, they are competent in teaching something about the basic steps. Albeit in a bland, marching ""do dah"" style that may suit a country bar but will get you laughed at in a social dance or nightclub. Princeton, NJ.",1153094400,5,595,4.418181818181818
7927815,4,B00004YZO4,"It's always a disappointment when the instructors do not dance to an entire song on a visual tutorial. Robert & Laureen are great dancers. It would have been fun to see them dance an entire dance together. The instructions are easy & straight forward. They are fun teachers.

The first DVD was lost in the mail. I use Amazon a lot. The custumer service I received to replace the lost DVD was fantastic.",1152489600,,402,4.506849315068493
7927816,3,B00004YZO4,"I'm taking East Coast Swing Dancing Lessons, but recently my friend introduced me to West Coast Swing.  I was somewhat interested so I bought Scooter Lee's ""The Ultimate West Coast Swing Reference Video"".  I found the video to be excellent in teaching any beginner the dance steps and in particular, the tips on how to lead...which is quite important.  However, the video is quite slow in the beginning.  They don't really get into the thick of things (teaching you the West Coast moves) until 1/3 into the video.  So what are they doing in the first 15 minutes or so?  Teaching you the basic footwork.  By the end of the video, they tell you that you are now ready to go out there and dance.  To be honest with you...I don't think so.  Not with the limited number of moves that you know.  I'd be completely embarrassed to keep on doing the same 4-5 moves over and over again.
In summary: If you wanna know what West Coast Swing is like, this video is pretty good.  If you expect to go on the dance floor and do West Coast Swing...realistically??? No.  Maybe if you are a follower...you can get away with it...but not as a leader.",1025740800,10,1130,4.432038834951456
7927817,5,B00004YZO4,"I was looking for a tape to augment the West Coast Swing dance lessons I was taking at a well-known studio in San Francisco. Typically, a studio will insist that a dance student enroll in a block of 4 class sessions in a particular discipline.  After two months of hit-and-miss group instruction with my instructors and spotty attendance on my part, I still had gaps in my understanding of the most fundamental West Coast steps. I'm happy to report that this video completely covers all elements of that first month of classes. Make no mistake; All elements for leaders and followers, of the beginning lesson plan of West Coast Swing offered at a major studio in San Francisco are covered in this tape.
And frankly, judging by the quality of the video presentation,I was surprised at the completeness of the instruction offered here. The production values of the tape are lackluster at best. However, the instruction is clear, consise, elemental yet thorough. These instructors are advertised as World Champions, (in fact, production credits roll over a shot of a glittering, championship belt buckle), and the important elements of beginning West Coast are covered meticulously. You are given the timing of steps, the necessary co-ordination between step counts and hand cues, 6-count turns, 8-count whips and importantly, every move that constitutes that first month of WC Swing instruction at my local studio is thoroughly covered here. This tape is what it says it is: a focused reference to the necessary building blocks of this dance.",1025395200,9,1540,5.062992125984252
7927818,5,B00004YZO4,This video was one of the best quality videos I have ever seen.  The instructors Robert & Laureen did such a nice job going over the real basics of West Coast Swing.  Many tapes show you just a little and then move on to advanced.  Robert & Laureen stayed basic and at the end did an intermediate teach.  I could follow them right on my tv and felt like I was ready to try it on a dance floor.  Plus they are very funny and you feel ok if you make a mistake.  I was given the video as a gift but will look for more of their tapes.,974937600,11,530,3.81651376146789
