4834468,5,B005M9VSNC,"""The First Grader"", like Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, seamlessly combines story and place to create an illuminating beacon for our time.

""The First Grader"" portrays the story of Kimani Maruge, an 84 year old Mau Mau veteran who helped liberate Kenya from the British. After the Kenyan government announced in 2003 that free schooling would be offered for all, Maruge, played marvelously by Kenyan actor Oliver Litondo, arrives at a primary school to finally get his chance at an education - long denied under oppressive colonial rule and unavailable to him since independence.

As the story unfolds, the realities of rural Kenyan life intermix with Maruge's traumatic memories of torture, incarceration, and the murder of his loved ones, which he endured steadfastly for the sake of freedom. These very real scenes make a powerful emotional impact but with a remarkable reverence, a profound sense of calling and self respect despite injustice. There is an artistic elegance to this film that combines truth telling with transcendence.

'The First Grader"", based on a true story, uses a school full of actual Kenyan pupils playing themselves. Oliver Litondo (Maruge) explains that high up in the Rift Valley ""education is coming in as a new thing."" The youngsters were not surprised to see an older student, there was already a fifteen year old in a class of six year olds, so the students accepted Maruge as one of them - just another student seeking an education like they were. Shared goals and shared experiences create a bond between the young students and Maruge.

There are also important shadow elements in the story written by screenwriter Ann Peacock. ""The First Grader"" deftly covers the post World War II history of Kenya: moving back and forth from Maruge's struggle against British rule to his struggle against tribal prejudice and mistrust of his motives in 21st century Kenya. By combining traditional Kenyan music with his own compositions, composer Alex Heffes creates a rich sonic landscape.

The film, compellingly crafted by cinematographer Rob Hardy, opens with a gaggle of school children running through mist shrouded trees to their isolated but beckoning new school. On this first day of the new term hundreds of children and their parents jostle to find a place. The exuberance of youth contrasts with the dogged strength of Kimani Maruge and the desperate drive of parents struggling to gain a coveted spot at school for their child.

Naomie Harris plays teacher Jane Obinchu who grows to support Maruge's fierce drive to learn. The joy of learning and the bond between teacher and students is so evident in ""The First Grader"" that while watching the film, I felt as if the audience was compelled to grab a sharpened pencil and join the class.

'The First Grader"" is a transcendent human story about confronting injustice and achieving redemption. The film spreads balm for old wounds and lifts the spirit with hope for the future. ""The First Grader"" is highly recommended.

(Please Note: During the First Grader's theatrical release, I attended a marvelous question and answer session with Justin Chadwick, Naomie Harris, Richard Harding and Sam Feuer. I met Justin at that event and he mentioned that people were asking him if his brother had written a review of the film. Justin and I are not knowingly related but I am sure if you follow the genetic path you will find  a connection somewhere in the distant past. In honor of my artistic brothers and sisters and their beautiful film, ""The First Grader"", I am posting my thoughts on this marvelous film.)",1321228800,14,3587,5.00503355704698
4834469,5,B005M9VSNC,". . . in hope, history and humanity. I was unaware of this film until ensconced on a 16 hour flight where I discovered it and watched it twice. I eagerly await the release of the DVD. The film is set in Kenya in the mid first decade of the current century. It concerns an old man -- a former Mau Mau revolutionary in Kenya's struggle for independence fifty years ago. The man, now in his eighties, has received a letter from the President of Kenya. He wants to read it for himself but cannot; he is illiterate. At the same time, it is announced that there will be free primary education for all Kenyans. He shows up on the first day of the school year to attempt to enroll in a school in a nearby village so that he can learn to read and write. Ultimately, the woman who runs the school accepts him over the objections of the parents of the children. I won't disclose any more of the plot, but this should be enough to provoke your immagination.

The film, based on a true story, does have a darkside in the recollection of some of the actions of the British in trying to control the rebellion. I commend the BBC for producing this film; it is very critical of the UK. There are very brief sequences of violence which are a necessary evil in the film without which the story would not ring true. But on the whole, The First Grader is inspiring and can be viewed on many levels.

I was touched deeply and entertained at the same time. This film is a must for anyone who loves teaching, learning and contemporary African history. And, if you haven't been to Kenya add a trip to your bucket list.",1318032000,70,1593,4.271523178807947
4834470,4,B005M9VSNC,"""The First Grader"" is a UK film based on a true story of Kimani Ng'ang'a Maruge (c. 1920 - 2009), who entered Kapkenduiywo Primary School in Eldoret, a town in western Kenya, at the age of 84. Inspired by a Los Angeles Times article by Robyn Dixon, the film is directed by Justin Chadwick (""The Other Boleyn Girl"") and the script is penned by Ann Peacock (co-writer of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe""). Though the film is not perfect with its melodramatic handling of the source material, ""The First Grader"" is an uplifting experience especially for those who are interested in important social issues like education.

Hearing on the radio the announcement of Kenya's government to give free elementary education to every Kenyan, 84-year-old Kimani (Oliver Litondo) walks all the way to the local school and applies for enrollment. The school's principal Jane Obinchu (Naomie Harris) is sympathetic, but Teacher Alfred (Alfred Munyua) refuses, telling Kimani that he needs two pencils and a notebook (and a uniform) to enter the school. But the true reason for refusal is, of course, something else.

Kimani never gives up, however, and comes back to school again and again. Jane accepts him in her class in the end, where Kimani learns to read and write among children. But the presence of the new ""first grader"" leads to unexpected consequences when Kimani gains attention by the media and the politicians. Moreover, the community members do not always share the opinions of Jane, who has to make a tough decision while Kimani, a former Mau Mau member, has to face his own past.

Those who are looking for inspirational movies based on real-life events (especially about the current educational issues) will be interested in ""The First Grader."" They will not be disappointed, but they should keep the following things in mind. Shot in Kenya, the film benefits from the authentic location and effective acting, with Oliver Litondo convincingly portraying the protagonist with dignity, but the overdramatized story contains some unnecessary episodes (anonymous phone threat is just one of them). Though too direct descriptions are wisely avoided, the film's flashbacks include torture and killing scenes. Certain thought-provoking aspects of the film's source material - so what prompted Kimani to study in the first place - are not fully explored.

For all its obvious flaws, ""The First Grader"" is an engaging film with a good if a bit melodramatic story and strong acting from the leads.",1314230400,2,2522,5.084541062801932
4834471,4,B005M9VSNC,"Insofar as it plumps for a ""heart-warming and inspiring"" general vibe (and it does: it's even in the production notes), Justin Chadwick's new film The First Grader certainly gives itself a fighting chance. Well, how many cockle-warming boxes can you check: illiterate octogenarian; overflowing rural Kenyan primary school; the massive, rolling expanses of the Kenyan bush; the accompaniment of African music and a dazzling, wholesome heroine to beam at the screen whenever things start to lag a bit.

Chadwick makes the most of these facilities, available to him in abundance, and why not: there are several scenes where unbearably cute little children buzz happily around the sombre silhouette of a elderly figure, and it is impossible not to be gladdened, whatever the context. Kimani Maruge, the titular first grader, even wears a child's school uniform - including shorts and socks - and gamely wrestles with cat, sat and mat by day and in the night retreats to a darkened shed, and stares into the distant darkness with ancient, sad eyes.

Before long we are let into the secret of those sad eyes.

As of course it must be, while based on a true story this account is heavily fictionalised: only that nod to verisimilitude gave any licence to make a film which would otherwise be too cheesy to survive the pitch. No doubt in a number of ways the real story would have made for inconvenient narrative: I doubt, for example, Maruge actually marched into the Kenyan education minister's office and ripped his shirt off.

While Chadwick is never ambitious with his film - he knows what his assets are, flaunts them, and doesn't try any funny stuff - he is nonetheless challengingly political. In its back-story First Grader is by no means saccharine: Maruge was a Mau Mau resistance fighter in the fifties, was imprisoned for the best part of a decade and, as the screenplay unfolds, we find out it is this history which compels him to seek his education. The film repeatedly flashes back to the resistance, and the flashes don't compromise. There's some pretty brutal viewing in there. Now, all Maruge has is a letter. And he can't read it. Hence the story.

The Mau Mau's plight at the hands of the British colonials is at the top of the news agenda at the moment, so Justin Chadwick couldn't have timed it better in terms of profile; on the other hand I suspect he may have romanticised the struggle somewhat (the Mau Mau are portrayed more or less as hapless victims; the British as torturing fascists), and this may lead to some charges of revisionism that he might otherwise have avoided had his story not had the same currency.

There are a couple of missteps: in an attempt to force the narrative, the screenplay calls for some anonymous antagonism (crank calls and threats of various sorts) which don't appear plausible since all that is going on is an old fellow showing up at a rural primary school for some reading lessons. Some of the parents at the school display a positively North London sensibility when it comes to their furthering their children's education at all costs: this didn't really ring true either (simply put, no peasant farmer could be quite that neurotic) yet this antagonism is allowed to build seemingly to boiling point, at which point it just dies off without resolution.

This review couldn't pass without mention of Naomie Harris, who is simply radiant whenever on the screen, and completely occupied the character of the principled teacher who takes Maruge in regardless of the firestorm it improbably provokes. Harris could have been reading the back of a cereal packet and I'd enjoy it: it's hard not to like a film when there is such a natural sparkling beauty in it. Expect to see more of this young lady in the next few years.

The First Grader sets itself an unambitious target and, with such prime quality raw material, gets home easily. Those of a delicate sensibility go in forewarned, though; some of the scenes from the Mau Mau uprising are more disturbing than you commonly see in a ""heart warming and inspiring film""

4834496,4,B005M9VSNC,"The First Grader is an inspirational movie about a an 84-year old African man played by Oliver Litondo who does whatever it takes to receive an education.  He's a strong believer that the children are the future, and that they need to be educated.  Interesting how he looks a lot older than he really is.  He's only 60-something years old but portraying a much older man in the film.

Relentlessly in the beginning he waits behind the gates of a poor African school so the teacher (Naomie Harris) can let him inside and teach him.  Eventually she gives in much to the disagreement of everyone else associated with the school (except the kids of course who welcome Oliver with open arms once they warm up to him).  Oliver becomes a student with the rest of the kids learning to read and write.  It doesn't take him long to learn how to read and write either.  He often helps the other kids (especially the little boy who has trouble writing the number 5 correctly).

Throughout the movie Oliver is often haunted by the memories of his past which includes torture involving either himself or the killing of his lover by the British involvement/imperialism, and later the story shifts gradually into Naomie and Oliver having to fight hard in order to keep Naomi around as a teacher after she's let go.  All because of Oliver's relentlessness and willingness to fight for her.  He goes all the way to the head educational board to fight even, which is a more daring task in Africa.

We see glimpses of the outdoors of Africa which are always a welcome sight.  Mostly however, the emphasis is on the small school.  Often the story goes through dry spells with little in the way of story development so you have to be patient to watch a movie like this, but it does accurately capture the struggles and difficulty for the people living in Africa and how the education system needed drastic improvements and basically begging for someone like Oliver to come along and save it.  The movie probably could have shown more in the way of daily struggles for the people of Africa however.

Either way, pretty good movie, and it's interesting that Oliver breaks a record by becoming the oldest student in the world.",1441756800,,2201,4.648578811369509

4834506,3,B005M9VSNC,"This film tells a remarkable story, but oversimplifies it to the point of misinforming.

The protagonist, Kimani Maruge, became famous for being the oldest person to enter primary school.  He did so at the age of eighty-four, when the Kenyan government declared a policy of free education for all.  He faced adversity in continuing his studies, but overcame it.  Eventually his story went international and he spoke to the U.N. about the importance of literacy and education.  In his earlier life, Maruge had been a member of the Mau Mau, the group of Kenyans (Mostly from the Kikuyu tribe.) who fought to force the British to leave Kenya.  He was captured by the British, and tortured in their now notorious (And rightly so.) concentration camps.  In the end, he and other survivors of those camps received compensation from the Kenyan government.

That's the story the film tells, and it is genuinely inspiring.  However, as films about actual events often do, this story is made simple in order to create a two-dimensional ""feel good"" movie.  Here are some examples, all of which are shown through flashbacks of Maruge's days in the Mau Mau.

The scene in which Maruge will take the Mau Mau oath shows a number of native Kenyans out in the country with a goat.  The scene is quite pastoral.  It is clear something important is about to happen, but the film doesn't show it.  An adult might guess that the goat will be killed, but younger audience members will not.  In actuality, the goat was going to be slowly tortured to death, with one bone at a time being broken with a club.  While the goat was being slowly and horribly put to death, the oath-takers would state that if they ever broke their oath, the fate of the goat would be their fate as well.  The whole point of a Mau Mau oath was to awe the oath-takers with its brutality.  That scene might have made us less sympathetic to Maruge and the Mau Mau, so it was left out.

The scene in which Maruge and other Mau Mau steal guns from a white Kenyan's farm shows several unarmed Mau Mau quietly sneaking into a house to find the guns.  They do so, and while some run with the guns, we briefly see one of them hitting a white farmer with his fists.  In reality, the Mau Mau weapon of choice was the machete, and they on at least one occasion hacked an entire family to death, including their children, one as young as six years of age.  Clearly you wouldn't want such a scene in a feel-good movie.  As Mark Twain said, ""Never let the truth get in the way of a good story.""

Maruge's wife and child are murdered by soldiers of the King's African Rifles at the order of a British officer.  Without actually showing the murder, the scene quite effectively portrays the well documented cruelty of the British in dealing with the Mau Mau and their suspected supporters.  During the film Maruge mentions that he had a wife and child.  In actuality, Maruge had more than one wife and fathered fifteen children, five of whom survived.  He was actually enrolled in the same school as two of his grandchildren.  By distorting the truth of Maruge's family, the film-makers once again cheated the audience.

I think Kimani Maruge's story is an important and inspirational one.  I would like to have seen him written and portrayed as a three-dimensional person.  By simplifying his story to the point of two-dimensionality, the film-makers have deliberately dumbed it down as though the intended audience couldn't handle complexity.  I'm sorry they did so.",1430611200,4,3503,4.653094462540716

4834535,5,B005M9VSNC,"""The First Grader"" is a surprising story about a generally unheralded (in the West) Mau Mau tribesman's journey through flashbacks coupled with his genuine desire to learn how to read at the age of 80+.

It is based on the real life experience of Kimani Ng'ang'a Maruge who, after hearing on the radio the Kenya's government pledge of free elementary education to every Kenyan, walks quite a distance to claim his spot. Not surprisingly, he is not automatically welcomed to join the elementary age children but he perseveres. The reason for his goal is that he wants to be able to read for himself a letter sent to him by the newly elected President of Kenya following his 8 years of imprisonment and torture by the British in their war of independence.

This movie includes some harsh scenes of the negative sides of colonialism, as well as continuing tribal conflicts.  Kimani's persistence  eventually pays off, and the stories of interacting with the children are moving. The expected conflict with politicians and some community members are offset by attention from the media, and the results are at times mixed.

""The First Grader"" is an inspirational movie, and addresses global social issues, including racism, economic struggles and education.  It is filmed in Kenya,  and the political struggles before and after independence are worth watching and reflecting on.

This movie is totally low tech and very high touch in message.  The principal character has a parallel to the journey of Nelson Mandela, in that he was interested in improving the conditions of his fellow citizens and not looking for self glory.  The fact that he eventually addressed a United Nations Conference in NY says that there can be change in the world, IF............... someone cares and does something about it.

Well done and worth watching!

4834564,5,B005M9VSNC,"I grow up and become a doctor and heal you. 5yo Agnes to the deaf Mr Maruge

84yo Mr Maruge dreams of being a veterinarian, enters first grade in 2003 to learn to read. The First Grader is his story. The Special Features documentary of Maruge and Mrs Obinchu his teacher is as touching as the fictional movie of their shared adventure.

No actors except the principals, Kenyan village grandparents, parents and first graders portray the true story of 84yo Mau Mau Freedom Fighter for Kenyan independence whose passionate desire to learn to read leads him to enter first grade when the government offers Free Education for All in 2003.

You must love education so you can be better than me. teacher Mrs Jane Obinchu

Mr Kimani N'gan'ga Maruge is a spirited Kikuyu tribal, married with two children. 1952 the British enter his home, split his skull with hammers, cut his toes off, shoot his wife and two children in the head in front of him, push pencils in both ears deafening him.  Maruge joins Mau Mau Freedom Fighters who pledge to recapture their country from British. Maruge carries visible body scars from his 8 years of daily torture for refusal to renounce the Mau Mau oath to liberate Kenya from colonial British rule. Mau Mau honor and guard their oath and have never revealed its content.

The First Grader which passionately advocates literacy is filmed in a Masai village Kenya. The 5yo behave naturally, responding to the actors as genuine teachers, and to their 84yo classmate as a human being in need of comforting and friendship. Heartwarming film with outstanding Special Features: making of feature, documentary interviews with Kimani Maruge and Mrs Obinchu. Maruge is an 85yo third grader at the end of filming.

Special Features website: more children will be out of school in 2015 than were out of school in 2006.

Sadly months after end of filming Mr Maruge passed away still vibrant curious and engaged in learning.

Village children interviewed in Special Features reveal the gift education can be. A recent book suggests that education is associated with terrorism. The author confuses the tool with the content of the exploration. If I learn the alphabet, what I choose to read is my own decision: angry vindictive or reaching out to understand myself and others, for example the Great Books series from U Chicago. Twenty years ago 6 couples all friends of mine took the Great Books leader training. We held weekly Great Books 2 hour discussions for 5 years. Then parenting intervened. We will revive the Great Books Shared Inquiry. What we thought we had solidified as knowledge in ""adulthood"" then, has evolved into a different point of view. As Mr Maruge shares with his 5yo classmates, we each have something to learn and something to give in the journey of curiosity and wonder of acquiring self efficacy and power. Mrs Obinchu values her encounter with a determined insistent and charming 84yo first grader.

5 star hopeful message of aspiration and lifelong learning

The entire audience sat in rapt attention throughout the movie and gave him and the producers of the movie a standing ovation as the final credits were rolling.

The incredible depth of the characters and the background story of the Kenyan revolution added to the rich story line and character development. The overarching message that my 12 year old gained from ""The First Grader"" was than too many in our country take education for granted and that the value of learning, no matter what age, cannot be overstated. The desire to learn leads to a greater level of education, but it is not achieved in a vacuum. There are others, teachers, parents, family, friends, that can either support or hinder our educational development.

I highly recommend that people rent or buy ""The First Grader"" not only for the rich performance of the lead actors, but for the historical perspective and the appreciation of an indomitable human spirit.",1333411200,,1055,4.921348314606742

Yet that is the ""hidden"" story.  He is determined to get an education when his beloved country announces ""free education for all!""  At age 84, he wants to learn to read, and nothing deters him - not walking for miles, nor everyone criticizing or making fun of him.  Not the children who at first tease him; nor the teachers who deny him and give him reason after reason.  This hero is marvelously portrayed as is the beloved head teacher.  Political corruption, even after ""freedom"" is obtained is correctly shown too; unfortunately too true and too frequent in these beautiful countries in Africa.  His determination to get an education was not to base it on what he had done for his country until they took his teacher away; then he went to the ""top"" to get her back - for him and for the children, and I think for her, too.  Well made, beautifully acted, scenery beautiful Africa/Kenya.  When I read later tho it was planned for South Africa, then made in Kenya, I was pleased.

4834574,4,B005M9VSNC,"Insofar as it plumps for a ""heart-warming and inspiring"" general vibe (and it does: it's even in the production notes), Justin Chadwick's new film The First Grader certainly gives itself a fighting chance. Well, how many cockle-warming boxes can you check: illiterate octogenarian; overflowing rural Kenyan primary school; the massive, rolling expanses of the Kenyan bush; the accompaniment of African music and a dazzling, wholesome heroine to beam at the screen whenever things start to lag a bit.

Chadwick makes the most of these facilities, available to him in abundance, and why not: there are several scenes where unbearably cute little children buzz happily around the sombre silhouette of a elderly figure, and it is impossible not to be gladdened, whatever the context. Kimani Maruge, the titular first grader, even wears a child's school uniform - including shorts and socks - and gamely wrestles with cat, sat and mat by day and in the night retreats to a darkened shed, and stares into the distant darkness with ancient, sad eyes.

Before long we are let into the secret of those sad eyes.

As of course it must be, while based on a true story this account is heavily fictionalised: only that nod to verisimilitude gave any licence to make a film which would otherwise be too cheesy to survive the pitch. No doubt in a number of ways the real story would have made for inconvenient narrative: I doubt, for example, Maruge actually marched into the Kenyan education minister's office and ripped his shirt off.

While Chadwick is never ambitious with his film - he knows what his assets are, flaunts them, and doesn't try any funny stuff - he is nonetheless challengingly political. In its back-story First Grader is by no means saccharine: Maruge was a Mau Mau resistance fighter in the fifties, was imprisoned for the best part of a decade and, as the screenplay unfolds, we find out it is this history which compels him to seek his education. The film repeatedly flashes back to the resistance, and the flashes don't compromise. There's some pretty brutal viewing in there. Now, all Maruge has is a letter. And he can't read it. Hence the story.

The Mau Mau's plight at the hands of the British colonials is at the top of the news agenda at the moment, so Justin Chadwick couldn't have timed it better in terms of profile; on the other hand I suspect he may have romanticised the struggle somewhat (the Mau Mau are portrayed more or less as hapless victims; the British as torturing fascists), and this may lead to some charges of revisionism that he might otherwise have avoided had his story not had the same currency.

There are a couple of missteps: in an attempt to force the narrative, the screenplay calls for some anonymous antagonism (crank calls and threats of various sorts) which don't appear plausible since all that is going on is an old fellow showing up at a rural primary school for some reading lessons. Some of the parents at the school display a positively North London sensibility when it comes to their furthering their children's education at all costs: this didn't really ring true either (simply put, no peasant farmer could be quite that neurotic) yet this antagonism is allowed to build seemingly to boiling point, at which point it just dies off without resolution.

This review couldn't pass without mention of Naomie Harris, who is simply radiant whenever on the screen, and completely occupied the character of the principled teacher who takes Maruge in regardless of the firestorm it improbably provokes. Harris could have been reading the back of a cereal packet and I'd enjoy it: it's hard not to like a film when there is such a natural sparkling beauty in it. Expect to see more of this young lady in the next few years.

The First Grader sets itself an unambitious target and, with such prime quality raw material, gets home easily. Those of a delicate sensibility go in forewarned, though; some of the scenes from the Mau Mau uprising are more disturbing than you commonly see in a ""heart warming and inspiring film""

To focus on just one of the many great aspects of this movie, the greatest value of this movie is how it familiarizes us with rural Kenya - not only how school life is for children away from the city and the effects of tribalism, but the positive and negative results of gaining independence. The tribalism was understandably muted in the movie, but evident enough. I brought my most recent team of first-timers to see the movie before we left, and it served to prepare them for the world they were stepping into. The value of this movie is more than being interesting, moving, and entertaining.

It is an excellent movie,  but a little formulaic.  Perhaps that is unavoidable as it is a true story so they can't change things too much.  Very good, but not the best movie I have seen this decade.  I am glad I saw it, but wish I could have rented instead of purchased it.",1325980800,,561,4.018018018018018
4834581,4,B005M9VSNC,"Very good and well directed movie that every student (over the age of 13) should watch. If you live in the USA, the movie will show you the level of education in Kenya, and will also maybe teach your children the importance of education. There are some very violent scenes where the main character flashes back to a bloody war with the British, and the atrocities that they committed. But, the movie itself is uplifting, educational, and a great story.

Parents may need to explain some of the background of Kenya, and the British take over of the country, but the acting is superb, the direction is excellent, and the story so much more significant than the usual tripe that comes out of Hollywood.

One of the best movies you have never heard about...until now.",1325289600,5,763,4.644444444444445

8479277,5,B005M9VSNC,"This movie is a critical and dramatic documentary of racist injustice and the persistence of one man who would not succumb to the past or to present  criticisms that would prevent him from seeking a justice for himself that would have far-reaching effects.  This is an inspiring movie that tells the story of another country in a way that enlightens our own sense of racist injustice.  As I watched, I realized I had to yet confess my own past of racial injustice and the ingrained feelings that  permitted it.",1508284800,2,510,4.696629213483146

But the triumph in the end of both the student and the teacher is worth the pain and darkness through which they both must pass.  It is an amazing journey.  But there are many disturbing images, so it is not for everyone.",1492387200,3,381,4.309859154929577
