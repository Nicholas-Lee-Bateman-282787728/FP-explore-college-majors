1796174,5,B00006WUWQ,"I can't wait to get this groovy 3 pack! I think the Austin Powers movies are great! (...)
10/10 Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery - Great Great film. Truly an original.  Mike Myers scores big with this one.  I saw this movie 7 times in the theater.  It has to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and a true classic. Elizabeth Hurley is still the best Powers girl.
2/10 Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me - Terrible Terrible movie, what was Mike Myers thinking?  They just recycled all the same Jokes from the first one. Heather Graham can't act to save her life. Fat (guy)is so gross and if you close your eyes you just hear Stuart Mackenzie, his scottish character from So I Marries An Axe Murderer.  It was a really dissapointing and pointless sequal. I gave it 2 out 10 because there were some okay moments, like the Introduction of Mini-Me. I did laugh a couple of times, but I only saw this once in the theater and never again.
7/10 Austin Powers in Goldmember - Groovy Baby, now where back on track.  Though not as original as the first, it was good to see a fresh Austin Powers movie that didn't borrow much from he first or second.  It grows on you the more you watch it too. For instance the first time I watched it I didn't like the Goldmember character, but as I watched it more and more I began to apreciate the humor and respect the craziness of the character. Beyonc Knowles is great. It was nice to see some who can act for a change after watching Heather Graham and her awful awful acting in the second film. I really liked the Foxxy Cleopatra character.  Though I liked Vanessa Kensington from the first movie, I'm glad Beyoncs character was way different and not all [like prostitutes] like Heather Grahams character in the second film.
Those are my two cents take it or leave it, to each our own. This may not be the best way to buy the films, but I like to buy movies as sets so alas I purchased it. Enjoy!",1037232000,2,1948,4.317808219178082
1796175,5,B00006WUWQ,"OK, i saw Austin Powers 3 this summer and loved it times 1,000,000. The others are great too. I must buy this set! Trust me, these movies are great and I guarantee busting out with laughter.

1796235,3,B00006WUWQ,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.  You've all been gathered together to form my evil cabinet for the triple feature Blu-ray of Austin Powers.  Everything went perfectly to plan except for one small flaw.  Due to a technical error by my henchmen at Warner Brothers, complications arose in the framing of the letterboxing of the transfer.

I've seen this movie many, many times... and I'm quite sure that I used to be able to see Dr. Evil's soles as he chases his son out of the room - I used to think how funny it was that he was wearing those silly white shoes.  But guess what - on the Blu-ray you don't see it at all.  That made me start to notice how weirdly a lot of things are cut off in a way that no good D.P. would allow to end up on the final cut of a film - particularly in scenes that are closer and people suddenly stand up and get their heads cut out of frame.  DID WB DO A LETTERBOX OF A 4:3 ASPECT?

Because if they did that, obviously that's a huge screw up.

The last time I remember this kind of thing happening was back in the DVD days, when they'd occasionally take a movie that was already ""formatted for your TV"" and then cut that along the top and bottom to make a ""letterboxed"" version.  I remember the DVD of Assassins was like this - I had both the VHS and the DVD and noticed how much more you could see on VHS, which needless to say was a huge disappointment.  (They fixed this when they made the Blu-ray of course.)  I've never seen it on a Blu-ray until today...",1521244800,4,1512,4.158075601374571

1796296,5,B00006WUWQ,"This is, for my money and experience and just plain nostalgia, the perfect spoof trilogy of spy movies.

Mike Meyers is, in Austin Powers, a weird and wacky combination of James Bond, Derek Flint and Harry Palmer and probably others. He definitely doesn't hesitate to let others know when he's turned on or excited for whatever reason; always up for a good shag, or crushing the plans of evildoers Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard or Goldmember (both played by Myers himself), whichever seems most appealing to him at the time!

It's too bad a fourth movie, which may have shown Scott Evil (Seth Green), Dr. Evil's son by Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), rise to power out of resentment over his dad's, and his dad's former nemesis, rediscovery of their familial roots, was never done. Unfortunately I believe the time for Austin Powers has passed and it's no longer really relevant in the public eye... but who knows! Miracles have been known to happen.

The only thing I have to say about this set that COULD be considered a negative (but not too much) is that the custom shot animations for the DVD menus, showing Austin himself bringing on the various options, were not ported to the Blu-ray format. However, pretty much all the extras from the ""Infinifilm"" DVD releases I used to have show up here; a commentary and some deleted scenes on the first disc, LOTS of them and a couple music videos on the second and... Haven't gotten to the third yet :)

Anyway, get this set if you love weird and wacky movies as well as the James Bond series!",1514937600,,1535,4.632352941176471

1796360,3,B00006WUWQ,"AUSTIN POWERS TRIPLE FEATURE by warner bros
has each film on 3 Discs inside clamshell case
each film has been given new 1080p 2:40:1 HD transfers with new 5.1 master mixes but that's all you will get
the picture quality for each HD transfer is very Good but not excellent and the sound mixes have only been boosted up a little bit
there are no new extras, no new interviews with Mike myers or Director Jay roach
the only extras are the exact same extras carried over from each dvd version of each film
which include the old audio commentaries and on set interview footage, the Deleted scenes & outtakes
 only in Digital remaster quality, not HD.
so is this blu-ray set worth buying i would say not really cause there's no retrospective featurette with Mike myers & jay roach
or any other cast & crew from the 3 films
warners didn't make much effort except for upgrading the picture quality for all 3 films
so if you already own the old 3 disc AUSTIN POWERS COLLECTION set, just keep that
i gave about 2-3stars for this blu-ray triple feature set based on no new extras, the old dvd extras have been carried over",1497657600,,1111,4.446078431372549

1796491,5,B00006WUWQ,I finally have the chance to watch all three Austin Powers movies without leaving in the middle of the movie. I'm able to remember a couple of lines from each of the three movies. It's cool how Mike Myers is able to play multiple roles at once. In the end you realize that certain charters that he plays is just him talking to himself. I'm glad that Amazon got it to me on time without having to wait the long period of time with the regular mail.,1467072000,,447,4.149425287356322

On the back of the package it says the first Austin Powers film is ""Widescreen"" and it also says it again on the DVD disc itself. However, when I played the disc it says ""This film has been reformatted to fit your screen"" and it's in 4:3 format!

The DVD packaging itself is also a joke with 3 discs stacked into one DVD tray. The discs are also have mismatched cover art like they were pulled from 3 different releases.

However, once I settled in and opened my own shagadelic inclinations to Powers's randy ways, I knew there was no going back. From his gorgeous heroines, to his ridiculous and delightful multi-character acting (except Fat Bastard -- I can't even...), Mike Meyers doesn't stop from beginning to end.

1796810,4,B00006WUWQ,"Mike Meyers three Austin Powers flicks parody James Bond and the swinging 60s-70s. They are as follows: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997), Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) and Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002). Whats interesting about these films is that Austin Powers (the character) is not a full spoof of 007 as hes his own character, just with Bond-like qualities.

Anyway, I wasn't sure I wanted to review any these flicks because, by doing so, Im admitting that I actually watched them (lol)! I say this because they're so goofy, juvenile, silly, sometimes raunchy (more verbally than pictorially) and filled with toilet humor. So I was never a fan and didn't even watch any of them until 2009. What turned me off? Besides the toilet humor and raunch, Powers (the character) seemed to have a gayish quality despite being a renowned ladies man in the stories. A good example is when he says, Oh, beHAAAve, which never struck me as funny, just gay.

Ive since seen all three twice and, despite my reservations about Powers and distaste for toilet humor, I do enjoy the zaniness and stoo-pid humor. If you can catch a grip with these films they're laugh-out-loud funny about a third of the time, sometimes more depending on the movie.

The first one, ""International Man of Mystery"" is my least favorite simply because its the least funny IMHO. It seems like Meyers and his team were experimenting and feeling out the possibilities. With its box office success, the two sequels brim with more confidence and creativity and are just plain funnier IMHO. GRADE: C+

The Spy Who Shagged Me is my favorite simply because its the funniest IMHO, but the third one comes close to matching it. Meyers and Co. overflow with confidence and creativity after the box office success of the first film. Heather Graham replaces Elizabeth Hurley as Austins babe while Rob Lowe appears as the young version of Number Two. Mini-Me and Fat Bastard are introduced. GRADE: B+

Goldmember is my second favorite of the trilogy behind The Spy Who Shagged Me. It has the best opening, by far, with unexpected cameos and the first half is often laugh-out-loud funny. If it kept up the laughs it wouldve taken first prize, but the second half loses its mojo, while still being likable and amusing. Beyonc takes the place of Heather Graham as Austins babe while Fred Savage plays Number Three and Michael Caine appears in a pretty significant role. GRADE: B

All three movies run 94-95 minutes.",1430092800,,2497,4.836065573770492

BTW, I've never heard of putting two movies on the same disc, I guess you get what you pay for, but if you order this three movies on two disks format, good luck.",1395619200,,630,4.122950819672131

With that being said; the sequels to the first film was not so good.  Don't get me wrong, I like the second movie.  It was almost as good as the first but Goldmember was just not funny to me.  I couldn't stand the Goldmember character.  He was annoying and gross, (him eating his own skin?! UGH!) I didn't like what becomes of Dr. Evil in Goldmember either.  It was disappointing.

This set was perfect, offering all three movies in one set, and for a lot cheaper than buying them all individually. Each movie comes in its own case, which are packaged together in a larger case (shown in the picture). It's nice having them each individually, just in case the packaging for the set ever was lost they would still have cases.

Absolute classics.  Individually all three are Masterpieces and together they make a priceless addition to your collection.  (At least they are if you are like me and they strike a perfect cord with your childhood and youth.)

The packaging is Spartan.  One slim jewel case, no insert, no bells and whistles.  The three disks have the usual features and bonus materials available.  The Blu-Ray format doesn't do much for the movies as they are not high impact experiences dependent on big FX splashes across the screen, but it doesn't hurt either.",1384473600,3,735,4.832

1797111,4,B00006WUWQ,"So I really love Mike Myers and the first Austin Powers movie. My siblings and I have been quoting the movie for years and the zany, British 60's music is totally awesome. The second movie starts out really funny and then somewhere in the middle, we all started to get really sick of the film, (I think it was around the part where Dr. Evil sings with Mini Me). It's like, ""Okay, is this film over yet?"" We all felt it was getting really lame. The chick who plays the heroine is such a bad actress--she really annoyed me. By the time we finished watching the third film, we pretty much hated Austin Powers. It started to become obvious that instead of being funny, they were just being disgusting and vulgar--that kind of comedy can only take you so far before people get sick of it. So, even though I'm glad I finally have the 3-film set, I'm also glad I didn't spend too much money for this product because I probably will won't get much use out of the last two films. STICK WITH THE FIRST MOVIE PEOPLE! As far as the discs and case go, I was really surprised that they put the first two films on a disc, (with sides A and B) and then had the third movie on it's own disc. Seems like they would've put the first movie on a disc by itself since it's the most popular. Also, the two discs don't match each other, but I guess that doesn't really matter. The case has a disc flap inside and the whole product arrived in fine condition. Overall, this product is a great purchase for what you get--I just didn't really like the last two movies.",1376784000,,1540,4.2593856655290105

Rumors have been floating about of Mike Myers returning for a fourth installment; however, that rumor has yet to be confirmed. Meanwhile, just sit back & enjoy these outrageous comedies. The first, ""International Man of Mystery"", benefits from being just that---because it's the first, it's the freshest & funniest spoof of British spy flicks. Myers really spread his parody wings on this one, undoubtedly one of the funniest films of the 90's, which is based upon a 60's fish-out-of-water character. He shows versatility in characters (can Powers and Dr. Evil be any more different?), as well as branding great catchphrases into the minds of moviegoers.
Myers and director Jay Roach reunite for ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"", which really pushes the envelope on bathroom humor & racy jokes (especially the former with the introduction of disgusting blob-like Scottish henchman Fat Bastard) as Powers time-travels back to 1969 in pursuit of Evil as he hatches his latest bid for world domination (and gains a ""son"" in tiny, ill-tempered clone Mini-Me). This one has its share of groaners; but there's enough new elements to offset the bad jokes (particularly when Myers repeats old gags).
""Goldmember"" might be the weakest in the series; again, some jokes as the ""a MILLION DOLLARS"" bit have just been done too many times in which they cease to be funny. But the clever premise--a movie within a movie, with famous actors such as Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, John Travolta, etc., taking on various roles from the series--is really something to see, with a knowing wink or inside joke on the movie industry. But again, there's enough new stuff to recover from bad puns. The great Michael Caine has some cheeky moments as Powers' famous spy Dad. Myers really goes over the top this time as Dr. Evil becomes sort of a caricature of himself, there's the inclusion of a weird 70's disco-era villain (the title character), along with a climax which digresses into sort of a convoluted ""family soap opera"". But nevertheless, it's all good fun.
Depending on your sense of humor, you'll either think these films are a grab bag of satire, puns & racy jokes, or you'll think they're simply hilarious. I thought the latter, of course! Groovy baby!",1362182400,4,2331,4.964194373401535

1797232,4,B00006WUWQ,"Mike Myers certainly found his mojo when he came up with the idea for Austin Powers. A super-hip super spy from the 1960s that volunteers to be cryogenically frozen to face his arch-nemesis Dr. Evil (who as also frozen) some time in the future. Well, the future arrives in the 1990s and we soon see the 1960s ""free love"" mindset of Powers collide with the ultra-conservative AIDS era with the results being really funny.

The following two films finds Powers travelling through time to continue his fight against Dr. Evil, but by the time he confronts Goldmember in the third film, the premise has begun to wear thin. I think it was obvious to all that despite leaving an opening for a fourth installment, it was time to leave well enough alone. After several years, there were rumors of a fourth Powers film, but I think Myers came to his senses.

Yet, this is certainly Mike Myers at his best and its a delight to see him making fun of the James Bond franchise with all its predictable contrivances that Myers revels in making parodies out of.",1357603200,,1045,4.5828877005347595
1797233,4,B00006WUWQ,"I am not a huge Mike Meyers fan. To be honest, though I loved Wayne's World. This is a must have for those who like Kitchy comedies. While a parody of sorts of James Bond flicks, like Undercover Brother, it basically tells its own story adding enough personal flavor, that it really isn't parody anymor as much as it is its own thing. One thing I should add (as I always like to hear the details as much as I can). The first copy I bought myself was a slip cover with three slimline cases (not bad, even though I prefer normal blu ray size cases not slims). And the second I purchased for a friend has one case with three discs in it. I am not sure if it's exactly the same  as the first as I can't open it as it's a gift lol. But, it all depends on what you like most.

As for the movies, I still feel if you take the best gags from all three movies you can have one  hell of a great movie. The movies are a bit slow in pace for a standard parody and seems to tell it's own unique store (so it balances out). The humor is crude and suggestive (as one might expect) but it's never raunchy enough to get an R (which I would not care if it did actually). The casting is great and the power women (as opposed to Bond women) are lethal but doubles as sweet eye candy. Overally even if you have seen these movies and only like maybe one it's still a great price. So I wouldn't pass it up. If you like british-like humor or if you like bizarre action comedies you will not want to let this one get away (before they raise the price). each movie has it's own flavor...and the worst jokes are not horrible by any stretch. But I've seen these types of movies for many many years, so a movie needs to be more than crude to get a laugh from me. Some of the raunchy humor is well crafted while others seem like Benny Hill joke rejects.

I may be sounding too critical, so I should add, this is great for any collection. but be careful of what you are getting used to. though it's not R it's still not really something anyone under 15 should be watching. So overally I'd have to say it's something that I can appreciate more now then before (as there was too much hoopla/build up that by the time i actually got to see it, I was expecting too much. But looking at them now, they are fine and can still make me laugh (but if you get bored by too much potty language or junior high school type jokes then this isn't for you.

1797292,5,B00006WUWQ,"Well, I don't want to speak of these films as a lot, so I'm going to review each one individually.
Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery. This movie is the introductory film, the one in which we meet Austin Powers and Doctor Evil, two people (ironically, both played by Mike Meyers) who have been frozen in the 60's to be defrosted in the 90's. It's a funny movie with hilariously rude sexual remarks. Even the names in this film seem a little off (Allotta Fagina, for example). These movies are kings of crudeness, yet they are hilarious. The menacing Dr. Evil is trying to stop British spy Austin Powers from destroying him. To top it off, Doctor Evil is introduced as an idiot that can't handle tying his shoes without getting ruined by Austin Powers. It is a hilarious movie, and left a good taste in my mouth after I seen it. 5 out of 5 stars.
Austin Powers. The Spy Who Shagged Me. This middle movie (well, it's the middle at the time of this writing, but hopefully by the time you read this, there will be another new 2012 Austin Powers movie on the way) picks up right where the first one left off. Austin is married, and he has banished Doctor Evil to space. However, Doctor Evil gets de thawed to be on a Jerry Springer show titled ""My Father Is Evil And Wants To Take Over The World,"" where he is with his son, Scott Evil (when Doctor Evil was frozen, he had semen frozen as well, and they made a son, in the event Doctor Evil never returned). We also meet Dr. Evil's exact clone, like him in every way... except 1/8 his size! Another addition is ""Fat Bastard"" (played by... YOU GUESSED IT! Mike Meyers) who travels 2 years after Austin was frozen to steal his mojo! This movie continues the inappropriate names (Ivanna Humpalot, to name one), and feature many rude humorous moments... nobody who's seen the movie will ever forget the opening segment in which Austin Powers is running through a hotel COMPLETELY NAKED! This movie is unique to me, moreover than the first movie, because it seems to have more in it. A lot more happens, and there is more happening in a shorter time (not to mention ditzy Doctor Evil making a ""laser,"" and going to unleash ""The Alan Parson's Project"" on the United States of America. It is up to Austin Powers to stop him in this hilarious sequel! 5 out of 5 stars.
Austin Powers: Goldmember. Sequel to Spy Who Shagged Me, Goldmember begins what seems like a long time after SWSM (AP2) ended. However, Austin is back, and again travels to the future, where a Dutch gold enthusiast has kidnapped his father. Austin must travel back through time to get his father back! We discover that there is a bad relationship between Austin and his father, and Goldmember (GUESS WHAT?? Played my MIKE MEYERS, as these must be EXTREMELY low-budgeted films) is working for Doctor Evil, who is (AGAIN!) back! We find something frightening about Austin and Doctor Evil (Duggie) by the end of the film! It ends up being a very touchy family film! The crude humor still continues (and the NAMES again: Fook Mi and Fook Yu), and there is an appearance from Ozzie Ozbourne! It's really the weakest of the series, but the fact that it is Austin Powers and in the hands of Mike Meyers makes it an awesome film! 5 out of 5 stars.
If you have some spare change (or are a big spender) be sure to get an Amazon gift card (or fire up your credit card) for Austin Powers I-III on DVD!

(If you can't find Goldmember, try flipping one of the DVDs over.) The original is just as funny as ever. The second and third are still amusing but somewhat dated.

1797298,4,B00006WUWQ,"I purchased the ""1-3 Collection"" on DVD.  I know enough about the other versions that I can compare/contrast.  If you're looking for information about the movies themselves, look elsewhere - I'm not going to mention the plots, the cast, etc. in this review.

First, the ""Austin Powers 1-3 Collection"" on DVD.  You get two DVD's.  The first and third movies are on a 'flipper' disc, with the second movie on its own disc.  A little strange, perhaps, but no biggie.

Comparing it the the Blu Ray collection, other than packaging difference (3 blu rays in their own slim cases instead of two dvd's) the contents are identical.  All movies are in 2.4:1 aspect ratio.  Each movie features commentary, deleted scenes, etc.  And while the DVD transfer is perfectly acceptable, I can see how these movies would really ""pop"" in HD.  If you like these movies enough, spend the extra $ for blu ray.

Comparing it to the first release of individual DVD's, note that (1) the first movie is presented in its proper 2.4:1 aspect ratio here, but not on the individual DVD (I don't know what aspect ratio was used, but it was wrong) and (2) that the extras on the individual discs are less.  Since you can easily find the ""1-3 Collection"" for about $8 shipped, I recommend purchasing the ""1-3 Collection"" if you choose to buy on the DVD format.",1342569600,7,1327,4.643776824034335
1797299,3,B00006WUWQ,"so that other consumers are not misled... this IS a 'full screen' edition of these movies... that's the aspect ratio of old-style television and computer monitors --- NOT wide-screen as shown in movie theaters (1.85) or typical HDTVs (1.77).  Fortunately I was able to cancel my order when I realized my mistake.  Consumers who purchase this expecting to see the full theatrical release scale will be very disappointed.  of course, 1.77 still cuts off the side edges slightly, but it's a heck of a lot better than 1.33.

I am rating this product at a ""3"" because it *is* a ""full screen"" release which is not entirely fair to the product, since it clearly states that that is what it is.  However i feel consumers will be misled by the first review, and also I really hate it when they muck with any of the original production qualities (including colorizing old b/w) so blowing a big raspberry on this one.  As i said, not entirely fair, but I didn't want to give it a five star rating either, since I haven't purchased it, I'm simply correcting some misleading information.",1340150400,5,1074,4.656084656084656

The only difference is you get these with HD sound & picture, and the packaging is different.  The standard set contained a ""flap"" style three disc set, while the blu ray set has each disc with its own slipcase.  This is basically my only reason for the 4 star review.  And it's Austin Powers.

Is it worth the extra $10-15?  I guess if you're a fan, and don't want the discs getting all beat up from the packaging from the standard DVD set, and are picky about picture & sound quality...then, yes...it's worth it.  Just don't expect any new bonus features.",1338163200,,664,4.567796610169491
1797321,3,B00006WUWQ,"I think we all at this point know what these films are about so I will spare you the plot reviews. I will say that the films get worse as they go along. The first one ""International Man of Mystery"" was one of the best films of the 90's and is really a cult classic now. It's one of those films you can watch over and over and still enjoy it. As the films progress the humour becomes more forced and juvenile. By the last film it was just a few moments worth watching. I also hated the fact that they changed the love interest in each film, esp considering both Hurley and Graham both expressed interest in staying.

""International Man of Mystery"" = solid ""A""
""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" = ""B-""
""Goldmember"" = ""C-/D+""

1797364,5,B00006WUWQ,"Watching these films one after the other, one is aware of just how good they are. Though full of vulgar/sexual humor that sometimes steps over the line (it's amazing how close they come to an R rating), they're also extremely funny. I saw ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" with a friend in 1999, and the ""fisting"" scene reduced me to such uncontrollable laughter he thought he was going to have to help me out of the theater. The father/son therapy session and the Jerry Springer ""My dad is evil and wants to take over the world"" are other highlights. Frankly, Myers does movie spoofs a lot better than Brooks.

My only complaint is Heather Graham. She's pretty, and... That's about it. Her ""acting"" is dreadful, unacceptable even in a high-school pageant.

The image quality is terrific, sharply detailed with psychedelically eye-popping color. I thought the phosphors in my plasma set would blow out. A bit of grain is visible at times, but this shows that little or no grain reduction was used, which is almost always A Good Thing.

Austin Powers is a 'sex symbol' of the 1960's and has himself frozen for 30 years, until his enemy Dr. Evil returns. He teams up with Vanessa Kensington, the daughter of his 1960s sidekick Mrs. Kensington. Can Austin defeat Dr. Evil again? I highly recommend AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY!!!

Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me- This is an extremely funny sequel with plenty of gags and hilarious toilet humor! This time, Dr. Evil travels back in time when Austin was frozen, and steals his Mojo. Austin also travels back to 1969 to stop Dr. Evil from destroying the world, along the way he meets an incredibly beautiful spy named Felicity Shagwell, stops a miniature clone of Dr. Evil named Mini Me and much more. I highly recommend AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME!!!

Austin Powers in Goldmember- This is a very funny sequel that brings closure to the trilogy! It has hilarious gags, and more awesome toilet humor! Austin's father, Nigel has been kidnapped, and Austin needs Dr. Evil's help to find him. He is told that a man named Goldmember has Nigel in the year 1975.

One of the big bonus's for me anyway is to finally have the original Austin Powers movie in the proper 2:4 aspect ratio after years of having to watch it on 1:85 on normal DVD. This may not mean much to some viewers but to those interested in seeing what they did at the theater it does. The other two films came out in proper 2:4 aspect ratio on DVD previously so why the original was formatted a bit off was always a mystery to me.  The films look great on Blu-ray ...and while they don't have any NEW bonus features to my notice..at least they did import all the old ones and music videos (some blu-rays are coming out WITHOUT the previous bonus features).
I picked the set up for a price that came to about $15 per film so I think its a very good value.

If you have casually seen a few or most of the ""serious"" James Bond films, you might not get this important aspect, as I seemingly did not at first, because while the Austin Powers films are supposed satires of the original Bond films, they are in essence, actually parodies of parodies.  Clear as mud?

While this DVD trilogy is a great buy for those who love/loved the original three Austin Powers' films (and a fourth one is on the way, they say, yippie) and while one can easily get repeated laughs from frequent viewings of all three, while all three films are better than about 95 percent of most Hollywood comedies, past, present, and future, this collection will always remain a must have for even the most fussy collectors of recent comedy movie series.  And particularly collectors of comedic genius Mike Myers' best efforts past/present (especially considering the apparent critically and box-office misfire ""The Love Guru"").  These three Austin Powers films however, were not created equal, for various reasons.  For me, the first is great, the second even better (and the best of the three), but the third is a bit of a slight downer compared to the first two.  All three however, have their strong and weak points, and as to which one a fan may like better than another, it's all certainly relative, because all three are very good at the very least, and there are more than enough purely funny moments in all three to make this collection a must have.

Mike Myers got his ""big"" start in the biz as a member of NBC's ""Saturday Night Live,"" where many of his characters/ideas and unique brands of humor and outlooks on life engendered popular and critical acclaim, including skits and sketches involving Deter, the German neo-wave TV talk/dance show ""Sprockets"" host, and Barbara (""I'm verklempt"") and Wayne's World's Wayne (which led to two feature films).  But none of his work prior to his Austin Powers efforts truly showed his potential, in my view.  I can only hope that if and when we DO see a fourth Austin movie, it pays attention and tribute to the first two of the series, and less so to the third.  Breaking down the three films a bit more individually...

AUSTIN POWERS, INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY (the first):

After a few viewings, it became clear to me that this was not so much a parody of semi-serious 60-70's spy, secret agent films as it was and remains a parody of all of those even remotely-genre similar films.  This realization is an important part of how one views this and subsequent sequels.  This idea is even cleverly incorporated (as are so many others), in the second film, when Austin is seen watching one of the earlier James Coburn spy spoof parodies while watching TV, when Powers says, ""Hey, this is one of my favorite movies...""  This was in fact, the turning point in my own turn-about appreciation for Myers' entire Austin Powers trilogy.  For in more youthful days, I had loved the Flint and Matt Helm flicks and eventually came to see the Austin Powers films and general ideas, as what they were/are really all about, parodies within parodies.  And ones done with true comedic abandon.

The first film gets at least 4 and a half stars.

AUSTIN POWERS, THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME (the second):

After generally converting to a casual fan of the whole Austin Powers experience, after giving the first movie a few viewings, I was so ready for another go-around, and the second film more than delivered.  It also cemented me as a die-hard Austin Powers fan.  New characters include ""Mini-Me"" and ""Fat Bastard,"" as well as much more Doctor Evil scenes and ideas, which were the highlights of the first film (and generally all three actually).  Both two, new main characters add to the general mayhem and funny parts, as well as does Rob Lowe as a younger Robert Wagner (""number two""), but there are many new incarnations and developments from the first film which only add greatly to the original concepts.  Mainly, consistent referrals back to the original effort, and imaginative additions and refinements to the first movie.

Overall, the second film of this original trilogy is without a doubt, in my opinion, the best, and earns 5 stars, without a doubt, baby.

AUSTIN POWERS, GOLDMEMBER (the third):

After some clever and innovative beginnings, but which rely more on their star-studded offerings than their genuine humor or originality, this third Austin Powers film was/is undoubtedly the weakest of the three, but is no doubt worth at least four stars.  Mike Myers adds and plays yet another character here, besides Austin, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard, in the form of Goldmember, but a lot of the jokes and humor here falls kinda flat more often than not.  While it is still a great comedy, it is without question a step down from the first and second films.  The female lead, strong and relevant in the two previous efforts, is lacking here, because while singer Beyonce is as gorgeous as Austin's prior two female partners, her acting leaves a lot to be desired, and there really is no ""chemistry"" between Austin and her as was strongly present in the first two films.  There is also a continual but mostly tame, self-referential mock-parody of the series itself here, which gives me the feeling that this third entry wasn't too well thought out or written as were the original and first sequel.

Therefore, at best, Goldmember barely manages 4 stars.  But its still pretty good compared to most other studio-released comedies, despite various shortcomings.

After all is said and done, while this type of Airplane/Naked Gun series throws everything at the screen in rapid order, in hopes that at least a few of the many jokes and humorous ideas may stick, and add up to a truly enjoyable time and DVD collection bargain, these films and their own unique brand of humor, do just what they're intended to do.  And that is, to make us laugh or at least smile.  That is Mike Myers's general career gift to us all, and these three films will always do that for those who appreciate humor for humor's sake.  Even if you've seen all three, this is a great buy in that it affords not only commercial free and uncensored, uninterrupted versions of Myers' genius (seeing as how mainstream TV showings of all three seem heavily edited), but a great addition to anyone's collection of rainy-day, forget-your-troubles for awhile, get-a-way movie pleasures.  While a lot of the humor is crude and bodily-functioned, sophomoric nonsense, and definitely not suited for all tastes, a lot of the humor and intent additionally hits the mark more often than not.  And while most of the hilarity aims for nothing more than what is actually presented, throughout the series, there are equally funny but subtle ideas and perceptions scattered about which one can only discern with repeated viewings.

If and whenever there is a fourth movie in this series, I can hardly wait.  Because while the first movie is great, the second even better and arguably the best, the third flawed but still hilarious in parts, all three together for the low price being asked as I write this, is no doubt probably one of the best film comedy collection bargains ever offered.  And remember, as was stated in the second film, paraphrasing, try not to think too hard about any of this making much sense, and just enjoy the overwhelmingly silly ride.",1213920000,,7914,4.782512858192505

Jokes are constantly reused and recycled in new ways through each movie, but they never get old, an each new version can make you laugh harder than the last! Also, Mike Meyers certainly proves his acting skills by taking on a multitude of roles. All in all, it's a great buy, and you can't watch just one, so you may as well get all three!

Mike Myers is genius and makes the movies funny because he plays Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and Fat Bast***. That's lots of talent!

Beware because if you didn't know, these movies are very silly and dumb but will definitely make you laugh your head off.

1797496,4,B00006WUWQ,"It's hard to believe almost 10 years have gone by since we first saw Mike Myers' Austin Powers character for the first time. These are among the funniest films made at the close of the 20th Century. For the most part, they are chock full of sightgags and silly puns and give Mike Myers ample opportunity to wear funny costumes and try out as many joke accents as possible. Myers rises to the occassion each time out, eventually playing 4 characters at once ala Peter Sellers.

As introduced in the first film (International Man of Mystery), Austin is swinging 60s' superspy who thinks he's a lot hipper than he really is. Think Sammy Davis Jr trapped in Davy Jones' body and you'll have an idea of what Austin is like before seeing him. Also introduced in the first film is Dr Evil (also played by Myers), a cross between Blofeld and Ed Sullivan. If anything, Dr. Evil has even better lines and gags than Austin himself.

The three films primarily spoof the James Bond series. The first film has strong overtones of both 'Diamonds are Forever' and 'Casino Royale' but Myers goes totally bonkers in the second film (Spy Who Shagged Me), in which 'Star Wars' and 'Moonraker' are yanked in for a well-deserved ribbing. The second film doesn't break as much ground as the first, but is arguably the funniest of the three as leading lady Heather Graham is the perfect partner in crime to Mike Myers' Austin character. Graham is the funniest of Austin's three leading ladies.  Unfortunately, the third film (Goldmember) declines after a very strong start, coming across as a stitched-together effort to wring the last bucks out of the Powers franchise. If the series has a flaw, it's that few of the characters seem drawn from life, rather than pieced together as parodies.
