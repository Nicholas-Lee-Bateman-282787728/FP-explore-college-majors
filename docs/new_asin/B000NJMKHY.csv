Although I admittedly know nothing of this particular style or of the demonstrator, I have been a practitioner of Nanquan for about 30 years. I am less than impressed with the demonstration including his posture (note the obvious head tilting throughout the form) and his footwork. Didn't seem to work together as an integrated whole. Aside from that, this is supposed to be an instructional DVD. Although I have no intention of trying to learn from it, this is not formatted to help someone achieve that goal. There is only demonstration of the form without a breakdown and explanation. There are absolutely NO applications shown for any of the movements, which would further clarify the intent of the movements in the form. I only wish I could have seen this demo before purchasing the DVD.",1358985600,,868,4.91156462585034
