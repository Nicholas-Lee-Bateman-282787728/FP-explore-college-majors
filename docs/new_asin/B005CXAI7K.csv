8466006,3,B005CXAI7K,"this is a large grouping of scare places,(about 5-8 min each)..for me it was not enough detail,and the film tended to jump around..to different places..without a real great back stories for each place..honestly,i never finished the movie...but i did give it to my roommate...and she loved it...so with this movie i guess it's a matter of taste..if you like series,the a haunting,paranormal witnesses than this movie isn't for you,but if your into casper,the friendly ghost..than you found the right movie..sorry..it's really not that bad..just to much,in a very short time..with not alot of great spooky back story..still if you get it cheap enough,it might be worth it..",1352073600,,671,5.280373831775701
