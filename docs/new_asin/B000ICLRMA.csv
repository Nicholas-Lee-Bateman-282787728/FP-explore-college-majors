8144914,2,B000ICLRMA,"The backcover emphasised that Ms Dragoni bears a strong resemblance to Maria Callas. Upon watching the DVD, I realised that it meant the pre-diet Callas. If only her voice had similar resemblance too!. Ms Dragoni as Norma had difficulty handling the long-breathed melodies of Bellini, and as the opera went on, she became increasingly short of breathe and gaspy. The Adalgisa was harsh and shrill all the time, and was very stiff in her acting. The remainder of the singers are unmemorable.

Of the recent productions, that featuring Theodossiou is the better one despite, as Mr Rishoi said, being very provincial. The one featuring Papian is a horrible travesty (the production, that is). Lets wait for the up and coming one with Gruberova in the title role.",1166572800,5,759,4.9763779527559056
