7885645,1,6305135290,"SCREAM QUEENS NAKED CHRISTMAS is actually 57 minutes long not 85 minutes. The rest of the 28 minutes is theater trailers. The movie features the talents of Debbie Rochon, Susan Ellen White, Christine Cavilier, and Lisa Ann Duval. The blonde you see on the video cover is not in the movie and some of the pictures on the back of the video box were not in the movie. I can tell you right now the nudity is in the D+ area and that is being nice. If you are going to be naked then be naked. The actresses if you want to call them that start off with skimpy clothing then strip down. The stripping takes forever and you have less than a minute of nudity. Also there is no plot to this movie. I guess the whole movie was written on a napkin. The sound is horrible and the narrator made it only worse. With him out of the picture, good ten or fifteen minutes of the movie could have been deleted. This video was neither a scream nor truly naked.",1214870400,4,938,4.15934065934066
7885646,2,6305135290,"If your idea of Christmas revolves around the fantasy of finding B-movie Scream Queens under your tree on Christmas morning, Naked Christmas is probably as close as you will ever come to the real thing.  Basically, Naked Christmas gives you four young ladies dancing and stripping in front of a Christmas tree, Santa, Frosty, and toys (no, no, no - kid toys).  Only one of the ladies ends up completely unwrapped, but the other three come pretty close.  Who are these ladies?  Well, they are none other than the ladies of the film Santa Claws: Christine Cavalier, Lisa Duvaul, Susan Ellen White, and the lovely Debbie Rochon.  Naked Christmas is actually a companion piece to Santa Claws, featuring the crazy murderer as the host.  You see, Naked Christmas is described as a movie with in a movie.  Debbie Rochon's character Raven, along with the other female characters in Santa Claws, were all filming a video called ""Scream Queens Naked Christmas.""  What this means is that director John Russo made two ""movies"" at once.  We see parts of the girl's photo shoots in the actual film, but Scream Queens Naked Christmas contains the complete versions of those striptease videos.
Quite honestly, Naked Christmas isn't much on its own; the ladies are somewhat attractive, but watching even a naked lady dance around for endless minutes to the tune of some very bad music grows tiresome.  What is worse, Debbie Rochon gets far less time than the other girls; there is in fact no additional video of Rochon in Naked Christmas that you won't have already seen in Santa Claws.  Basically, I wouldn't really recommend this video to anyone by itself, not even to Debbie Rochon fans.  If you order the Santa Claws Special Edition DVD, though, you will get Naked Christmas as a bonus; for my money, that is definitely the way to go.",1071446400,6,1821,4.801282051282051
