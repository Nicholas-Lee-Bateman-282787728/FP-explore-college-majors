While Pearl Harbor is based on fact, the filmakers play fast and lose with the facts. I think it compares very favorably to Titanic. It also move a lot faster than that movie and there's a lot more action. It fills the role of summer blockbuster very well. I'm not sure why it met with such negative critical reaction, but if it is enjoyed for the escapist fun that it is, I think it works very well. The same can be said of Armageddon. It's fun. Sure the plot has holes big enough to drive a truck through, but that's really not the point. If you want a factual space movie then rent Apollo 13. This is an action movie that's pure escapist fun.
So if you're looking for accuracy or a serious interpretation of history, then look somewhere else, but if you're just looking to have a good time then these movies will work for you.
I've always been disappointed that they never put out an anamorphic version of Armageddon. I resisted buying until this two pack. The film would of course benefit from a new transfer, but it's adequate and the sound is very good. The Pearl Harbor transfer is pristine. It's reference material. The DTS sound is enveloping and the bass is kicking. Like I said, if you're looking for a good time, then you found it with these two. And the price is right.",1020470400,,1456,4.41635687732342
7960334,5,B0000640W8,"Well.....all I've got to say is that these two movies are a perfect choice if you're planning to buy new DVDs anytime soon. although ""Armageddom"" is not exactly ""New"", I think it will do good to your DVD collection, especially since it's one of the best movies that combines love and tragedy. ""Pearl Harbor"" is a combination of those two too, and Ben Affleck also takes part in the movie as he did in ""Armageddom"". I would definetely buy this ""movie combo"" if I had my parent's credit card, so I definetely recommend this to anyone who loves to see good movies about love and war (Pearl Harbor) and love and sacrifice (Armageddom). And also....if you love movies with nice visual effects and a nice soundtrack, these two are for you!",1019520000,4,733,4.603053435114504
