I watched it with many in the theater who cried and laughted and said wonderful things -- and with some that it looked like it might have touched but they've been too ""touched"" by the world and our society - and they put on a blank face, blinked back any sign of tears and said - ""oh, it was okay"".  these are the people, as we all are, who are hurting in this world and too proud or stubborn or sold on the ""world"" to ask for help, admit they need help or accept help.  Please keep them all in your prayers -- and I will keep you in mine!  HRS",1229126400,22,664,3.860294117647059

3706423,5,B001N26HFG,"Point blank these are all powerful, meaningful movies. Each with its own strong message. Flywheel is really about character, integrity, honesty and doing what is right in God's eyes. It really does make you take a look at your own actions and evaluate yourself. At the core is walking the walk and not to just put on a show for others...it really does matter. Especially, great for anyone who owns a business as well. Facing the Giants is still one of the best movies I have ever seen. Give God your best...praise Him when you lose, praise Him when you win. We had a group of kids play soccer and implemented the principles of this movie and testimonies after testimonies poured in from strangers who noticed that this team was different...different in their attitude, different in their actions...they were literally preaching the gospel in their actions to hundreds of people at a time...amazing...This movie is just not for guys, there is a powerful message for everyone. Fireproof defines what love is in biblical terms. Defines what unconditional love is...it shows how any marriage can become great when you have God in the center of it and these same tools can be used in all relationships...we need to be more like Christ...humble, loving, selfless. Fireproof really does give you hope to overcome any obstacle you may be experiencing especially in a marriage...gives you a real solution that works.

Overall, I have seen lives change in miraculous ways from each of these movies.",1472256000,4,1488,4.9282868525896415

3706579,5,B001N26HFG,"Wow!  Don't get me started about how wonderful these movies are!  LAst weekend,  I watched ""Facing the Giants"" again.  This time with my husband (he'd never seen it) and he loved it almost as much as I did the first time I watched it. ""Flywheel"" is for anyone who has ever had a business or worked in one, for factual!  It's a 'trust God and all things fall into place' just like the other two.  ""Fireproof"" with Kurt Cameron is so well done also, that if you don't cry by the ending as with the others, something is wrong with your thinking.  If I had to pick a favorite, it would be ""Facing the Giants"".  Not that the others are any less important with their messages, it's just that it will appeal to the younger crowd and every child should see it and understand God's love to them.  Amen!",1404518400,,793,4.268456375838926

3706601,5,B001N26HFG,"The Sherwood Baptist Church of Albany, Georgia, has now made four AWESOME movies using VOLUNTEER people and talents from their own congregation, right down to people VOLUNTEERING to provide childcare and meals plus arranging for costumes and making sets!  These 4 movies are extremely family-friendly, and they display their message of Faith and Hope in a very captivating and fun manner!  Each movie has more than one story line, which keeps the movie interesting for both men and women as well as children!  The other 3 movies made by Sherwood Baptist Church are ""Flywheel"", ""Facing the Giants"", and ""Fireproof!"" (in which Kirk Cameron starred and VOLUNTEERED his talents!)  FLYWHEEL is about a used car salesman trying to get a restored classic car to run, while keeping his business afloat and his family united.  FACING THE GIANTS is about a small Christian school whose football team is trying to win games, and eventually faces the 3-time state champion ""Giants"" -- while the coach and his wife are trying to have a baby.  FIREPROOF! is about a fireman (Kirk Cameron) and his wife who are very devoted to their jobs, but not so devoted to their marriage--until the husband realizes he does not want a divorce, and accepts the challenge of a ""Love Dare"" to see if he can bring his marriage back together.  COURAGEOUS hadn't yet come out when this Triple Feature was put together...but your money and time will be well spent when you purchase a copy of Courageous and watch it and share it with your family and friends!  I am grateful to Amazon for offering the ""Combo Pack"" of Fireproof!, Facing the Giants, and Flywheel (Triple Feature), as I have bought several of these Combo Packs and given them away for gifts -- and this year I bought 12 copies of Courageous and gave them away for gifts!  All 4 of these movies are extremely entertaining and I believe they bring Glory to God -- and I'm not even Baptist!!! --so I again thank Amazon for making these wonderful movies available, and I'll continue buying them for gifts as me and all of my children now own a copy of every movie!",1388620800,2,2090,4.71978021978022

3706626,5,B001N26HFG,All these movies are simply wonderful. If you are feeling down in your faith I highly recommended Facing the Giants or even for adolescents learning how to appreciate their elders. It's def one of my top favs! Fireproof is an amazing movie to fix a marriage and open your eyes to many aspects of your relationship with someone else and The Lord. We have yet to finish the third movie but I am sure it's just as great! Quality is lower then the other due to funding but still I'm sure has an amazing message!,1387497600,,507,4.347368421052631
3706627,5,B001N26HFG,"Superb family-oriented value.  Director and story line are excellent.  I am a big fan of ""Flywheel,"" made for something like $20,000, it started the whole Sherwood Pictures production line effort.  Great set.  Buy it.  Watch it.  Share it.",1386460800,,239,5.157894736842105

If you start with Flywheel, then Facing the Giants, and leave Fireproof for last you will see how the quality progresses and gets better and better.  Facing the Giants and Fireproof both made me cry.  Great movies!!",1383091200,,374,4.621212121212121

3706646,5,B001N26HFG,"These movies have good clean plots, no vulgar language or suggestive behavior, of how families can overcome addictions that lead to divorce and split troubled families. Good clean uplifting films that help us find ways to keep couples and families together in these troubled times if they will only take the time to really see what brought them together in the first place. Very refreshing to see movies like this coming out once again in todays troubled world.",1380672000,,461,4.923076923076923

3706667,5,B001N26HFG,"I saw Fireproof a few years ago and thought it was a great movie and was even more impressed by their newest movie Courageous. I bought this 3 pack in hopes that the other two movies would be just as good. I loved them Courageous and Fireproof are still my favorites, but these movies are also great films. Facing the Giants may be a little hard to follow if you are not a football fan, my girlfriend got bored easily, because she's not a big fan of the sport. On the other hand it is a great film for football fans (religious or not). Overall these are good movies to buy for friends to help them turn to Christ.",1367971200,,613,4.159663865546219

3706691,5,B001N26HFG,"The three (3) pack is a perfect idea! Although I had already seen Facing the Giants and Flywheel, I did not see Fireproof. By getting all (3) in a package at the same time, for me it was a no-brainer to add to my collection so I could share viewing with other Christians as well as with those that I may have opportunities to ""bring a good movie"" when visiting.",1358899200,,361,4.171428571428572

3706703,5,B001N26HFG,These movies are free actors who want to get the good nature out of them to the public.  They are Christians doing the job for God and doing it without pay.  They donate all the money to the poor or the church!  Very surprising that they can act and serve the Lord with doing so.,1358380800,,279,4.036363636363636

""Fireproof"" and ""Facing the Giants"" are more well known but we enjoyed discovering Flywheel as well. These are stories that touch on a few things many churches do not like to address, but that almost everyone struggles with at one time or another: Commitment, fidelity, faith, & honesty.",1344038400,,405,4.71830985915493

3706725,3,B001N26HFG,"The ideas of the movies are good but ehh.. I probably would not recommend it. First of all, Fireproof is sort of awkward at many times; I don't feel like I'm watching a movie. I just feel like I'm watching a couple argue and make up at the end, through a camera. Facing the Giants has to be my favorite out of these three. Frankly, I was so confused in the beginning of the movie. The movie/story doesn't even have a solid beginning. But there was this one scene that actually grabbed my attention because it was interesting. After that one scene, the whole movie was great! It has a great picture of how God is a God of miracles. He is able and He is working. The third DVD, I honestly didn't even watch like 30 minutes of it. I had no idea what was going on and I couldn't pay attention even if I wanted to. What. I regret buying this triple feature. Should have only gotten Facing the Giants.",1338508800,,895,4.209302325581396

I have no doubt they are quality films.",1323129600,,333,4.015151515151516

My children can actually sit down with the family and watch these.  You don't have to worry about foul language or sexually explicit scenes.  These movies are definitely for the family.  I can't wait for Courageous to be released in January!  It is another top movie in my book!",1322956800,,444,4.569620253164557
3706730,5,B001N26HFG,"Of the three movies in this pack, Facing the Giants is by far the best. However FireProof is also very good. Flywheel is good (they are all good stories with a Christian based theme), but you can see that this was the first film made by Sherwood Films and the Kendrick brothers. The production qualities are more like made-for-TV movies of the past, and the acting is a little stiff from some of the cast members, but knowing that this is a film made by volunteers from a church community allows you to overlook those minor defects. I love watching the evolution of the skill sets of these movie-makers and their devotion to their faith. God is truly at work here. There is a distinct message of each film and you walk away understanding the message, but not preached at. I eagerly anticipated the follow up movie, Courageous, and saw it the first day it came out. WOW. I can't wait to buy it on DVD. Keep 'em coming. GOD IS STILL SPEAKING - and has found a perfect medium in the movies of Alex Kendrick et.al.",1322524800,2,1010,4.406417112299465

I could see the improvement in the script writing and the acting from one movie to the next.  The best thing about all these is that they all show us that solid family values and morals are essential for the strong bonds of marriage and family stability.  The latest movie Courageous, in theaters now, is a must see if you have seen any of the first three by this cast.  I would suggest seeing Courageous in the theater and purchasing the DVD when it becomes available.  We really enjoy the works of these people.",1321488000,,670,4.450819672131147

If these movies don't seriously inspire you, then you'd better check your heart.
I was also blessed by watching the behind the scenes of Flywheel, to see them praying before every scene (they did the same for all the movies).
These films are a testament to what God can do, if you just commit everything to Him and let Him be in control of your life.",1316736000,3,459,4.275862068965517

My children who are 12 and 14 begged to watch these movies every chance we get. Alot of people say ""Fireproof"" is for married couples but the kids love it just as much as the other two. Our family at facedm.com think this series of movies cant be beat!! It's hard to beat the price Amazon.com is selling it for in the three-pack. You will never regret buying these movies, but you will regret not buying extra copies for your family & friends!

I was looking forward to watching it but on arrival, my national postal service, Royal Mail, charged me 12 pounds sterling more to have it retrieved.

Therefore I am hoping they produce more movies in the future because they portray authentic, wholesome entertainment. Although they may not be quite as polished as a typical Hollywood production, their substance creates a better experience. I appreciate the creativity, humor, and real-life situations that reflect how faith and life interact.

Even though each one seems to begin a little slowly and somewhat homemade, you will be pleasantly surprised that these stories move into a real-life pace.  They are all simple, human interest, true-to-life scenarios which will benefit viewers with positive outcomes. One might even derive an uplifting, life-changing benefit from the lessons portrayed in these movies.  Since each one has a different story line, one's favorite will probably be determined by one's personal interest or background.  For instance, young married couples might find ""Fireproof"" the most interesting. All three provide good, moral endings which are suitable even for young children.  There is no profanity, violence, or sex.  There is, however, some very natural humor. Everyone should see these movies.  Take the plunge.",1244592000,2,872,5.4148148148148145

3706846,5,B001N26HFG,"These movies showed how faith is lived out through daily lives.
""Flywheel"" and ""Fireproof"" are both excellent. ""Flywheel"" talks about ethics in workplace (as a used car salesman in this case). ""Fireproof"" talks about the true meaning of love (being carried out in a marriage). I was deeply touched when watching both. I strongly recommend these two movies to all Christians.
I think ""Facing the Giants"" is a little weaker on the storyline. Not enough said about the proper attitude when you lose a game. They just prayed a thankful prayer, and that's it. Their attitudes were still pretty low. I think the movie could have said more on this. But it is still a good movie with a good message.",1240531200,,691,4.7190082644628095

I am not what you would call a ""highly religious"" person but these movies moved me in a way I haven't felt in years.

3706850,5,B001N26HFG,"In a word, WONDERFUL!  A friend loaned us ""Facing the Giants"" and asked that we review it and comment.  We found it to be sound theologically, warm and tender to the spirit, and very much inspiring to the soul.  We were absolutely amazed at the production quality and very fine performances given by the ""volunteers"" who brought this film together.  When we heard of the first one produced by these fine Georgia folks called ""Flywheel"", we couldn't wait to see it as well.  After checking around it also came to our attention that ""Fireproof"" the third production had been released and we decided to take advantage of this special ""three-pack"" offer and collect all three at once.  Now our problem is - we can't decide which one is our favorite!  I'm sure there are many reviews that will discuss the details of the cast, crew, storyline, etc, which most will be interested in.  What attracted us was the good clean family entertainment that we can enjoy for ourselves and share with others.  How many movies can you say that about today?

These movies are the kinds of movies that should be watched with our children. All three are good wholesome family movies that speak the Truth! It is an excellent way to share the gospel and also be entertained.

You can tell that Flywheel was their first movie and was low budget, but they did an AWESOME job with what they has. They took it a step up with each movie. My 3 year old son asks to watch Facing the Giants every morning and at night it's Fireproof.

I recommend ALL 3 of these movies to everyone, especially families. You will not be disappointed. I pray that everyone that watches see their need for Christ if they have not already accepted Him.

3706874,5,B001N26HFG,"These three movies are awesome family entertainment!!!  Although they are PG, I have let my 7 and 4 year old watch them, because they are only PG for Christian content.  Fireproof they have not watched yet, just because it is about marriage and I thought they needed to be a bit older.  Fireproof is the best one but they are all well acted and have an awesome Christian moral message.  Facing the Giants is about a high school football team that starts winning big once they begin to depend on God.  Fly Wheel was the first one this church produced and the acting is still great but the filming isn't as good as the other two.  Keep in mind that this church put all 3 together themselves and most of the actors and actresses are volunteers from their church.  Fly Wheel is about a used car salesman who is very immoral until he becomes a Christian and then Christ helps him change his life and business around.  These are all great fun and moral lessons for the whole family!!!",1239321600,,978,4.424581005586592

Each story starts with the ways and expectations of the world and the difference our God and Jesus can and does make in our lives because we seek His ways and not our own.  Each has a turning point in the daily life that causes them to seek another way.  All three are great movies to share with the ones you love.  It is the greatest bargain out as far as I am concerned.  It is a must for any video library and especially when you are sick of the sex, nudity, violence, and heart ache Hollywood is so famous for.

3706898,5,B001N26HFG,"this is a great Christian Movie that should be shown in Churches and Youth groups across the Country. it tells about a crooked Car Salesman who come to know Christ and has remorse for cheating People in the Past.
He sets out to make things right with his Customers and sees wonderful things happen in his business and homelife, truly inspiring.",1238112000,,344,4.655737704918033

3706914,5,B001N26HFG,"To review you own faith in God, these movies will help remind you of who you need to go to when things seem impossible. Facing the Giants is one you can view over and over again. If you need a blessing then you need to watch these DVDs",1237766400,,235,3.9166666666666665
3706915,5,B001N26HFG,"These three inspirational movies will bring a smile to your face and hope to your heart.  The viewer lives through the fear of a dishonest used car salesman whose past cheating of his customers is found out, the dejection of a high school football coach and players whose losing seasons seem likely to continue, and the bewilderment and sense of loss of a heroic firefighter whose insensitivity towards his wife leads her to want a divorce.  You will feel good after watching the drama, dilemna, humor, and amazing relationships of the films' characters.  Each of the three movies focuses on a different demigraphic group -- a small businessman, high school athletes, and a married couple with a shaky marriage.  In each case, the main character makes a moral choice to change direction from a failure to a course that ultimately enables him to succeed.  These are warm, engaging films that one can watch and enjoy again and again.",1237680000,,931,4.867088607594937

I truly hope they (Sherwood) will continue this form of out reach ministry as it has been a blessing to me and my family.

3706919,5,B001N26HFG,"All three of these movies are great.  Good stories, good acting.
The ""Pranks"" extra and the 60 second movie at the end of Fireproof had us laughing so hard we could hardly breathe.",1237593600,,180,4.454545454545454
3706920,5,B001N26HFG,The included three pack DVD movies are worth the time and effort to see. They are a must for any collector of Christian movies. Even if you are not a Christian the messages are clear and to the point. We live in a time of uncertain realities and moral break down.

3706922,5,B001N26HFG,Fireproof and Facing the Giants are inspirational movies. I highly recommend them. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed watching these two movies with two other couples. We were so inspired by Fireproof that we purchased the Fireproof book.,1237248000,,236,5.2368421052631575
3706933,5,B001N26HFG,"To each its own!!! i have to disagree with the person who gave it only 1 star and who on top of it put it down and refer to it as ""lifeless, watered-down and a waste of your time"". THESE MOVIES ARE INSPIRING!!!

These movies send a clear message about the reality of life and why we are here. we are here to serve and honor god. it is about obedience to god and god's promises. it is about faith, trust, hope, forgiveness and love!!!
there is nothing boring about them and they certainly aren't a waste of time.
i think majority rules and if you see all other reviews they are giving it 4-5 stars. amen! i can only hope they make many more movies like these.

watch them! invest in them and keep them in your family for years to come!!! share the good news about god and his promises with the unbelievers.",1237161600,,805,4.187096774193549
3706934,5,B001N26HFG,I am sick of the off color remarks and Godless television that is forced on the Christian public. My sister and I enjoyed the three movies that I bought because they had the same Christian values that we have. My whole family borrowed and watched. They were so glad that anyone can watch and enjoy them. Just because I'm over 13 doesn't mean that I want to watch smut. Buy these movies so the Christian companies can make more and give us the movies you can watch. Hollywood shouldn't call the shots.,1236902400,,500,4.445652173913044
3706935,5,B001N26HFG,"These 3 movies are excellent movies for family oriented people and for those who are sick of watching just sex, swearings, drugs, cheating, and other stupid stuff that the world worships on movies.
I think the biggest difference between these movies and Hollywood movies is Hollywood has great acting and no message, no content, it doesn't add ANYTHING good to your life and these 3 movies made by volunteers from a Church don't have the same acting experience (YET), however the message is life changing,uplifting, it makes you reflect about little things in life and shows what the TRUE VALUES are!
BUY THESE movies, you won't regret! Watch and live the MESSAGE that is sent by it!",1236211200,,683,4.846153846153846

3706938,5,B001N26HFG,It is so hard these days to be able to watch a movie and be glad you did. These movies have such a wonderful message that you can overlook the lack of skill of some of the actors . Each movie does get better in the amount of skill portrayed. I would recommend these highly.,1236038400,,273,3.981818181818182
3706939,5,B001N26HFG,"These movies were the ones that  made me rethink my movie tastes. They are very powerful! and have great messages! Everything I received from the action movies plus more! They took control of all of my emotions! Happy, Sad, Angry, Suspense, Anxious! I will watch these movies OVER AND OVER.

The actors are common people like you and me. The acting might not be the most polished, but they are fantastic stories! I like all three of them...

""The Ultimate Gift"" is a nice Big Budget film with the same type of message.

I checked out these movies from my local Library first, then purchased them from Amazon. Thank you for letting me ramble... Hope this helps.",1235952000,,660,4.615384615384615

3706941,4,B001N26HFG,"As I am reviewing a Three-Pack (Facing the Giants/ Fireproof / Flywheel) I gave it four stars.  Fireproof alone I would give 5 stars.  Having said that I much enjoyed all three, it is just that the quality of Fireproof was better.  All three were family suitable and gave good lessons on living.  I will look for more of these in the future.",1235952000,2,341,4.365079365079365
3706942,5,B001N26HFG,"I initially ordered this looking to buy Fireproof and saw this as a good deal since it got me free shipping.  My wife and I like Facing the Giants and were pleasantly suprised with Flywheel.  You can see the acting and production steadily get better through the movies, but the message is as strong as ever.  Flywheel is just as strong as Fireproof in my opinion (message wise).  We are buying another three pack to pass out to friends and co-workers.  If you are looking for big hollywood production, you will be disappointed, but come with a ""made for TV"" attitude and an open heart and you will be deeply touched!
