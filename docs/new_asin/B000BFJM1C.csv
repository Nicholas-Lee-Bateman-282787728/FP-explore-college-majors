I paid $4.98 for this DVD and I tried, God knows I tried, to see more than 20 minutes of it...but it was impossible. This DVD is a glued product of whatever pieces the producer/director found in his movies closet which he probably was going to throw away in the trash can, but somehow or someone gave him the idea that making a 96 minutes of pure trash was possibly going to sell based on a fakeful Scene Index listing at the back of the DVD and the possibility that he somehow participated in the Communion movie...but, my Lord, don't you even think about spending a cent on this piece of, yes, you said it! Unbelievable!!",1363219200,2,705,4.348484848484849
8086076,3,B000BFJM1C,"This ""movie"" is a bizarre collage of home movies, stock footage, interviews, and some extremely wild allegations that all center around UFOs.  It's hard to get past the beginning where the home movies are the most prevalent, but once you get past that and the interviews start, that's when the fun for me began.  I really hope that the people Mora interviewed were actors because it's just too disturbing to think I live and work next to them.

What's of equal interest to me is to see a real glimpse into Mora's way of thinking.  The things he puts in the film, either because he believes them or he was doing it for fun, really tells us a lot about the man and his thinking process.  In this case, that may be too much for many people, but I found it to be a fun ride.",1281571200,,770,4.2465753424657535

8086078,1,B000BFJM1C,An extremely juvenile mockumentary advertised as much more.  Nothing of any quality or professional effort to view here. Maybe it cold be used by our present White House for learning purposes to further their current Fox News/two-bit propaganda machine.,1148083200,3,253,5.487179487179487
8086079,1,B000BFJM1C,"There is really no way to describe how bad this movie is.  Although the filmmaker has previous credits to his name and (contrary to the ending of this film, where he is said to be missing) subsequent credits, this thing looks like a bad high school documentary.  If you've ever wanted to make a movie and thought you didn't have what it takes, this movie will give you hope.  The production values are awful, even for a low budget documentary, but then again, you can't tell if it's a documentary since the bonus footage includes people screen testing for their parts.  Although ostensibly about alien abduction, there is little in the way of facts beyond blatant speculation to be found here.  My favorite scene is where they show a picture of Hitler on the telephone and they tell us that he is talking to aliens. Come on! You could say the same thing about a picture of anyone talking on the phone!  Save yourself an hour and a half and avoid this movie.  Maybe this is meant to be a mockumentary, but it's just not funny or remotely interesting.",1143331200,2,1049,4.518518518518518
8086080,1,B000BFJM1C,"I rented this because of Mora having directing Whitley Strieber's Communion film, and expected a UFO documentary, which this 'film' has been advertised as.  What I got instead was a waste of a chunk of my life (even having watched bits of this thing in fast-forward).  Mora presents his home videos of his family and friends as they occassionaly joke about uFOS.  stock footage abounds, with cheesy music playing in the background as mora cracks what I can only guess are supposed to be humorous jokes.  A few minutes total time are spent with Mora interviewing some unknown ufo 'experts' but any ufo documentary on the markt contains more of both information and entertainment.  I have no idea why this was even released or what it was supposed to be, other than a cash scam on the film viewing public.  And by the way, don't misunderstand: I am also enjoy ufo humor and mock-umentaries as well as real ones, but this is neither.  It's not funny or interesting, it's not as advertised, and there seems to be no real point beyond Mora having a chance to exploit his collection of home movies.  Mora et al, you should be ashamed.  PS- oh, and the extras on the disc contain footage of Moras interview subjects (alleged abductees) auditioning for their roles.  Mora couldn't even be troubled to have real alleged abductees tell their stories, instead we get actors portraying them (though we aren't told so and why is still a question)",1137542400,6,1433,4.718875502008032
