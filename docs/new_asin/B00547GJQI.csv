8456406,1,B00547GJQI,"By the title we have to infer that ""the Miraculous"" Virgin (Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal, who has a large following in these zones of South and Central America) intervened in the solution to the drama of Eduardo Villarreal (Antonio Merlano), protagonist of this motion picture, the son of a bourgeois family from Bogot, and helped to free him from his guerrilla kidnappers. Of course, we also have to deduce that the Miraculous has connections with the Colombian army, which is the force behind the (accidental) liberation of the hoity-toity kidnapped guy, rescued in the last moment by a peasant family, after he is left wounded in the battlefield. By then the best characters have been killed or have gone deep into the jungle: Arturo aka Lagarto (Guillermo Ivn) and his sister Mayra (Mnica Gmez), the son and daughter of a peasant, witnesses of his killing by a paramilitary troop. In the end we the spectators as well as the leading character (an arrogant fool who sticks to his class' principles until the end) have understood nothing about the Colombian war which has more than 50 years going on, and have to resign ourselves to the usual list of figures of dead, missing or kidnapped victims of the bloody war. The posh son returns home to mom and dad and literally ""That's all folks!"", because the final song that expresses the emotions of the Spanish-speaking victim is in English, no less. Unfortunately his grandmother (Clara Samper), who gave him a medal of the Miraculous Virgin as a present, is not around to explain the miraculous power of the Virgin, but we also infer that the guy's best friend, son of a Colombian senator, who was kidnapped too, died in the first minutes because he did not have the Miraculous with him. For fans of action movies, the battle scenes are excellently choreographed, with highly professional special effects; there is also a little game for fans of the world industry of corporative football, and Merlano, who has top billing and wrote the story on which the screenplay is based, also has some screen time to sing a tune (in Spanish). You are warned. With good technical values and crass ideology. As ""Secuestro Express"".",1428796800,,2173,4.828418230563003
