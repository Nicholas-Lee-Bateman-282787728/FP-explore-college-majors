7921918,5,B00004STDX,The captain ginyu saga is probley one of my fav dbz series when goku arrives on nemek with his new powers at 100 times gravity he defeats 2 of the ginyu force with ease until jeice runs away to go get captain ginyu their leader. Goku surely sensed his power and knew he was way stronger then the others so why did he waste so much time by letting the fight drag out? He should've switched to his true power and killed ginyu and jeice fast and easy cuz he did has the power to win but he let ginyu get into his head and goku let his guard down and is ability to beat him. He's always been way to trusting to be a saiyan vegeta's right but still goku is the strongest and i just wished when he got off the spaceship he would've handled his fight differently.,1495843200,,756,4.046666666666667
7921919,4,B00004STDX,"the ginyu saga is one box-set of non stop action.  there are the three main story arcs in it that are Nail vs Frieza, Goku vs Ginyu, and the munchkins on a frantic search to get the 7 seven dragonballs out of the hands of the enemy.  wow...  it was great with lots of action and some unique surprises (ginyu's power really made me wonder if that was his original body...) it is a great addition to any dragonball z collection.",1073779200,3,426,4.234567901234568
