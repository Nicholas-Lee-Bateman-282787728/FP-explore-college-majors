4216292,5,B003XDJEKI,"PureFlix keeps getting better and better and this movie is proof of that.  The action sequences were very good. One small complaint would be what seemed to be a hurried ending, but it doesn't take from the main body of work.",1357516800,,224,4.463414634146342
4216293,3,B003XDJEKI,"This is a good Christian film up to the last scene.  I like the realism because life does happen to Christians as well as everyone else.  It dispells the notion that Christians are some type of heavenly race far removed from the problems of real life.  I do object to the final scene on the beach where the man confronts God.  He accuses God of giving him a child and taking her away, of giving him a friend and taking him.  And then he says ""I give in.""  Th overall implication is that God punishes people and abuses them until they submit Him.  By Scripture and by pesonal experience I know this is not true.  People do blame God for every bad thing that happens in their life, but that's because they don't understand God or the corrupt world in which we live.",1356825600,,763,4.286713286713287

4216296,5,B003XDJEKI,This is a great Christian movie.  It is a great evanelistic tool and a movie that has action.  It makes one think that there has to be something better out there.  Finding God is the answer.,1354665600,,190,4.222222222222222
4216297,5,B003XDJEKI,"I work at a christian bookstore and see many different christian movies. This movie is by far one of my favorites for the genre of christian suspense. The story and acting is believable and it has a very good message. This movie talks about the grace of God even in bad situations. I would highly recommend this movie, but there is a lot of violence so it's more of a PG 13 type movie.",1354233600,,385,4.216216216216216
4216298,4,B003XDJEKI,"This is a 2012 drama of 90 minutes in length.

PROS:
It's a strong low budget dramatic movie that entertains and makes you think.

I cried at the end.  You don't get better movie making than that!

It stars the guy who played the character from ""Indiana Jones"", who was the friend that threw down the Nazi flag to hoist Indy out of the Ark pit.  He's funny and serious and seems so very full of life.

98% of the acting was great, and the local actors who played the bad guys were superb and made your blood run cold.

CONS:
There was a couple of places where the cinematography left something to be desired, but I doubt the average movie-goer would notice or be distracted.  For instance, a scene in the cage was not well focused, and the island chase scenes were not framed well, but it could also be a matter of taste, since the directors were all from Thailand.

There was a couple of short scenes that should have been shot over a few times until the actress was less wooden.  It might also be that the male leads were so good, it overshadowed the performance by the actress who played the grieving American wife.

SYNOPSIS: Husband and wife doctor team flea to Thailand on an extended medical mission trip after the death of their baby.  The wife is open to believing and reads a Bible her friend gives her, but the husband is openly derisive and hostile to God.  The husband is taken by a gang of killers to an island where he is forced to treat their leader with little more than his bare hands.  Another captive befriends the doctor and his positive outlook and openness about his foibles, and his un-shaking faith in God, help the doctor cope with the situation, and survive.

OPINION:
Is it kid friendly?  Yes and No.  Yes, because it's clean, has a good Christian message, and is very mild in violence.  No, because younger kids probably wouldn't get why the main character is so mad at God, and there is  a scene where the really bad guy falls in a bear trap and screams a lot.  SPOILER: plus, the captive girl and the main Christian character die, so it might be a big emotional thing for little kids.

Liked the movie a lot.  It's clean and can be shown to any audience.  The shots of Thailand will make you want to dust off your passport and book a flight to SE Asia. Buy this one and encourage the movie makers to make more.",1353456000,,2341,4.34331797235023
4216299,3,B003XDJEKI,"I found this movie to be very creative in using a plausible scenario to convey many Biblical truths.

On another site, many reviewers are highly critical of the acting by Jean Rhys-Davies.  His part came across as tremendously overacted, I agree.  I think that C. Thomas Howell definitely could have done better as well; but I suspect that may have been a result of a directorial or even poor screenwriting could be the underlying issue rather than poor acting.  Most of the other actors didn't come across well either especially the woman, who plays Rhys-Davies wife.  Some of the dialogue seemed a bit flat or plain unlikely given the situations the characters are in.

The point of the story was meaningful as through the dialogue several points were conveyed.  1) God knows it is an ugly world and our free will is in part some of the reason, why some bad things happen;  2) God knows our thoughts and emotions, so if we are angry suppressing it doesn't change anything; 3) God's ways are not our ways; 4) We can ask him to help us get through or do it ourselves; 5) The plan of salvation is simple and easy to do - confess your sins, accept Christ's work on the cross and ask God to take control.

The movie definitely had drama and suspense, you have no idea how the movie will end, which I think given the other flaws, these qualities make it a must see.

Its a pretty decent evangelism movie for 90 minutes for those who heard the message but didn't have a context for it. It is great for all ages, too.

The scenery was gorgeous and this region would be one I am adding to my bucket list.",1351555200,,1597,4.3979591836734695
4216300,5,B003XDJEKI,"Even before I watched the movie for the first time knew it was going to be a good one.. Just did not know just how great it would be. One of the best movie I have seen in a long while. The film is great visually with it's shots, and locations of the film including the water shots. Both C Thomas Howell and John Rhys Davies were amazing in the movie. Escape is the best film that I have seen Davies in.

It's a Christian film, with Christian stuff at the same time in script. But yet it didn't feel like a Christian film/ a Pure Flix film. At least what I think. Blown away with the film def a must see",1345766400,11,602,3.9344262295081966
4216301,4,B003XDJEKI,"Received a free copy of Escape with C Thomas Howell and John Rhys-Davies.
first here is what the distributers had to say:

Doctors Paul and Kim Jordan are struggling to find peace in their lives after the tragic loss of their baby's life. Paul (C. Thomas Howell from The Amazing Spider Man, ET) persuades Kim to escape reality and flee to the exquisite islands of Southeast Asia. Paradise becomes a nightmare when he is kidnapped by human traffickers in need of a skilled doctor.

Faced with a fight for survival, Paul finds himself captive alongside the wealthy Malcolm Andrews (John Rhys-Davies from Indiana Jones, Lord of the Rings). He quickly realizes there is no hope for his captors dying leader and is forced to examine his eternal fate. With life and death in the balance, Malcolm challenges Paul to stop running from God. Will Paul realize that trust in God is his only hope for escape and reunion with his wife?

Pure Flix has had many films over the past few years from Brother White to Encounter to Jerusalem Countdown and many more.
this film was another step up in every area.

First thing that caught my eye was the great photography. This movies production value took a giant leap in quality.

Second was the actors. From a LOTR actor in John Rhys-Davies to Pony Boy Curtis from the outsiders tthe films actors did a great job.

Finally the script was very solidly written as well.

Our main characters find themselves after a tragic loss leaving everything they have to do doctor work in the villages of Thailand.
One day a young boy comes to the clinic and Howell follows him to a so called emergency.  He soon finds himself kidnapped to help some local pirates.

The story carreans from there into a suspensefil drama that is not the norm in Christian cinema.

4216334,4,B003XDJEKI,"Okay, this movie might be a bit hard to find the right niche audience for. It deals with the question ""If there is a God, why do bad things happen to good people?"", but in more of a documentary nature than a ""This is why"" canned-faith sort of way. It is a Christian film, but probably not for younger audiences because of the violence. No obscenities I can remember though, and it doesn't glorify violence the way that Hollywood does, so Escape has that going for it. I didn't have a problem with the actor's performances or the photography either, so I guess if I have a problem with the movie it might be with the way it deals with the subject matter. The movie compares how two people go through a tough situation - a doctor struggling with ""How can there be a God?"", and a British ex-pat with a strong faith. This movie struck a chord with me at many levels, but it doesn't come straight out and answer the question. (Personally I think the answer usually lies with God's rejoinder in the book of Job, or perhaps C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity) But one thing the movie did accomplish was help me think about my own struggles.",1417824000,,1128,4.401913875598086

4216341,3,B003XDJEKI,"I was so pissed by what the criminals put the kidnap victims through and then for them to continue to help people ... It really made me queasy.

 I think a better strategy would be to design it so that people are empowered to help themselves so that their culture s not so cynical and ruthless.  Helping someone regain their health doesn't change their world in the way that will savr the life of someone trying to help.

Human trafficking is unforgivable and the Land of the Smiles should be held accountable:

4216353,2,B003XDJEKI,"First off, I watched the Blu-Ray and I found the production quality and acting relatively decent all things considered. This was a ""Christian action"" movie (even writing that seems a little odd). It kept me entertained and engaged throughout and did not bore me.

This could have been a truly great movie.  Unfortunately it has a major problem with it. The main character personally witnesses no less than 4 deaths - including 3 people he really didn't want to die. That's not the problem per se (though this fact alone tells you that this movie is NOT really a ""feel good"" movie) - the problem is that throughout this movie with these deaths and other suffering, all these questions are raised about God's goodness, but are never really resolved. And in fact, shortly after 2 more people die, the main character finally ""gives in"" to God in surrender and begs him not to take his wife too - basically portraying that God was killing people to get his attention so he would surrender to Him - it portrayed a very skewed view of God IMO.  This guy didn't turn to God because He heard all about Jesus' love for Him and God's kindness (i.e. it wasn't God's kindness that drew him to repentance).  He turned to God out of fear of God because he was afraid that God would continue killing people close to Him.  At least that's how they portrayed it.  It seems to me this would make it hard for such a person to ever have any real, loving, deep, intimate relationship with God.

The film basically just gave a message that bad things happen in this world - they quoted Jesus in the book of John (though sadly didn't mention it was Jesus saying it) that talked of how in this world, we'll have tribulation but to take heart. But that's about the extent of really trying to come to grips with everything. No mention was made of the devil and that indeed it is the devil that steals, kills, destroys (John 10:10), and that the reason for the suffering and hurt and death is because we humans mucked it up way back in the garden and basically submitted to the devil's plan for us - and the result of that sin still plays out today and affects us all, but that God is for us. The movie portrayed that God is basically the one deciding that these people die, but even though we know that God is over all, God allowing the choices of humans and letting things play out in our world is not the same thing as God actively choosing to take someone. Just because a little baby dies doesn't mean God really wanted that little baby to die - He does not always intervene - especially since He has the eternal perspective. God can certainly use the results of a death to work in a person's life since God specializes in taking bad and turning to good, but that's different than a portrayal of God as a giant ""meanie"" out to get you.  This movie did showcase the eternal perspective a little, which was good, but the overall ""troubling"" questions raised about God's goodness and justice (including a bunch of ones raised by 2 characters in a major scene) were never really satisfactorily answered by this film, which means that viewers can easily be left with more doubt in God than they might have had going into this film. And that is a problem. I could easily see an unbeliever watching this film and it actually hardening them further against the Lord, rather than turning them to Him.

In one of the key scenes, one character asks another why bad things happen to good people.  The other character replies basically stating that none of us are truly good in ourselves - that we all have made mistakes.  Which is true, but the problem is that as they are talking about this they are locked up on an island being held hostage by murderous, ruthless, clearly evil men, while they are clearly portrayed as ""much better"" (one of them is a doctor that came to help people etc.)  So that whole answer to the question just felt totally disconnected and insufficient given what you're seeing on the screen.  Again, to an unbeliever watching this trying to come to grips with such questions, I think it likely to ring very hollow.

Despite what this movie seems to portray, Our God is a God of LOVE and is for us, not against us (time to go read Romans 8, people!). Tragedies do happen here, but God isn't very likely to be killing everyone close to you just so you'll ""surrender"" to Him. This is a very troubling message that this movie portrays (reminiscent of other troubling Christian movies with related themes such as ""Saving God"" and ""Though None Go With Me"").

Note for future Christian film producers: Please, if you're going to be so bold as to tackle the issue of ""why bad things happen to 'good' people"" as a part of a feature film, then at least make sure that you adequately answer any questions that you raise. I'm getting really tired of seeing Christian films purposefully raise questions of God's goodness but then not adequately answering those questions, which in the final analysis ends up pushing people away from God (even if it's so subtle that many don't realize it), rather than towards Him. Trying to answer the ""problem of pain"" (as C.S. Lewis described it) in 2-word or 1 phrase sound bytes just doesn't really cut it.

For those with children, be advised there is some violence in this movie, including a rather heart-wrenching knife-stabbing scene, and a shooting, and as mentioned - several deaths.  Based on this alone, I wouldn't show to children under 13.

I waffled between rating 2 and 3 stars. I would really probably put it at 2.5 if I could. But since I can't, I decided to go with 2. This could easily have been a 4 or 5 star movie if the filmmakers had appropriately resolved the serious questions they raised.  I don't know of any real positive Christian messages you'll walk away with from this movie. Maybe one about the fragility of life or sacrificing for a friend (one of the ""death scenes"" was well done as a believer ""goes home""). But mostly you'll probably just walk away a bit sad at the deaths of 2 people you really didn't want to see die. You're not going to leap for joy at the end of this movie.

Now, I say that, but I'll be honest that I'm a bit baffled. Because I've read other Christians' reviews of this film where they thought it was so encouraging to them in their faith and had a great feel-good ending. (warning: slight spoiler) It is true that in the last like 3 minutes of the movie, things turn out okay for the main character. But this follows right after 2 other people that you wanted to see things turn out well for here - and it didn't. It left a very bitter-sweet taste to me and I don't understand how anyone could really call this movie ""feel-good"" in any way. And while I won't specifically call this movie ""discouraging"", I really don't get how it could be labeled ""encouraging"". It portrays realities - that people die and bad things happen to all, which is fine. But its ""harsh"" portrayal of God I don't find very encouraging, and I don't really understand why others do. Sometimes I wonder if we're more comfortable in having a distant, angry God that's ""out to get us"", instead of having a close, loving, intimate God that ""is FOR us"". And in a strange way thus finding films or books that portray the former more ""encouraging"" than the latter. I don't know - but it's my best working theory right now. Or maybe just having a film tell you that everyone, Christian or not, is going to have hurt and pain here is greatly encouraging to some. I don't know. But since I've read positive reviews, part of me just can't help but wondering if I missed something.

4216355,3,B003XDJEKI,"decent enough movie, a little overplayed and didn't like some of the turns it took.  not sure I would have purchased it, had I seen it first.",1366243200,,141,4.222222222222222
4216356,5,B003XDJEKI,This movie is unique in its story line. It will keep you entertained and interested. There are several good characters and the story plot is different and refreshing. If you hate to hear talk about God then you will be less interested in this movie. There is not a lot of talk about God and it is well handled by this movie.,1365465600,,324,4.241935483870968
4216357,4,B003XDJEKI,"This movie was interesting.  It was a good movie for a family with older kids to watch to see how far a person might have to go before turning his/her life over to God.  A bit predictable, but entertaining.",1365206400,,206,4.256410256410256
4216358,5,B003XDJEKI,"Good story. Intelligent movie. Good acting. Great job Paul Emami, the director and producer. The scenery of the movie was breath taking.",1364515200,,136,5.2272727272727275

4216361,3,B003XDJEKI,"The scenery of the movie was breath-taking, and even the slums was worth taking a second look at paradise and trying to escape the ruins of their life of losing a child, didn't find true happiness he was seeking. Redemption was the key and trusting God, which the movie explained even in his mission to escape, while another man laid down his life to save his. C. Thomas Howell did well with some of the action scenes, characters were identifiable, but in some aspects of the movie it just fell flat for me. Yet, some of the lines in the movie was piercing to the soul, or thought-provoking for sure.

8407953,4,B003XDJEKI,Not good for any kids under 14 cause the Reality of this movie is frightening to them. We as adults have our faith strengthened by the message movie expresses.,1514592000,,159,4.517241379310345
8407954,5,B003XDJEKI,"I waited awhile before getting this movie.  I was not disappointed.  The message was a good one and the actors did a very good job of delivering the message.  It was sad in a way but then, life isn't always happy.",1503100800,,213,4.146341463414634
8407955,1,B003XDJEKI,"I purchased this dvd because of C Thomas  Howell and John Rhys Davies. first the dvd forces you to fast forward through awful previews, the story is so predictable not even the great acting saves it from being boring. it was not even worth watching. stay away!",1498867200,,260,4.531914893617022
8407956,4,B003XDJEKI,"Good message, good actors, good clean entertainment.  I do think, however, that Thomas Howell plays a better cocky rival as in Woodlawn than an emotional wreck.  Somebody teach that man how to cry on cue!  They could have also done more with the rescue and Davies' character's death.  All in all, I'd watch it again.",1495238400,,316,4.6909090909090905
