8193586,1,B000PWIE9C,"I don't believe that this is an official release. There are videos of performances like this available for free all over the internet. This seller most likely downloaded this ""rare"" performance from a peer sharing website, burned it to DVD, and wants to sell it to you for $40. Ch-ching!!!
Even the previous review sounds like a sales pitch.
Before you buy this ask yourself, ""Have I ever heard of this release before? Are Robert Plant or Jimmy Page getting paid a dime for this?
Is this a BOOTLEG RECORDING?",1197504000,6,508,4.655555555555556
