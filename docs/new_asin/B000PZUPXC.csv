8193950,2,B000PZUPXC,"The picture looks like the real Kimba I remember as a child, as does the storyline but right off the bat, the song theme is not what I remember nor are the voices. I guess the copyright 1994 tells the whole story. This is a re-make. How sad.",1437091200,,241,4.041666666666667
8193951,3,B000PZUPXC,"Ok, I agree with all that has been said but I bought this last year for my kids ( 4 & 7) and they still both like watching it.",1296259200,,126,3.3793103448275863
8193952,1,B000PZUPXC,"The other reviewers are right; this is not the original Kimba the White Lion. This is a quickie re-dub done in the 90s, with excruciating voices and really bad music. The only way to see the real Kimba the White Lion is to get the big Ultra Edition Box Set.",1254873600,,257,4.16
8193953,1,B000PZUPXC,The other reviewer doesn't seem to understand that this isn't the Kimba he has the fond memories of. This is a re-cut and redubbed version.,1201996800,2,139,4.6
8193954,1,B000PZUPXC,"Let's face it: the only reason any of us aging baby-boomers buy stuff like this is to relive a fond childhood memory. Kimba was one of my favorite cartoons as a youngster, and I looked forward to having a fine nostalgic time of watching this old classic (nor will I lie: I was looking for some of the much-reported similarities between this forty-year-old cartoon and Disney's The Lion King).

Ouch, ouch, and OUCH! Even combined with a healthy dose of low expectations, my dusty old recollections could not prepare me for this wincingly dreadful cartoon. Even in the context of anime style, the animals are drawn so bizarrely as to nearly be unrecognizable as their species, and the voices are excruciating (I have struggled without success to come up with an appropriately agonized description of the effect they had on me).

Then there's the animation itself. Long-frozen characters are made animated by the crudest of mouth movements (I'm put vaguely in mind of Clutch Cargo), and movement of characters and scenes is depicted by the same crude jerky sequences repeated over and over. Alas, Kimba stands strongest as a testimony to how far even the mass-produced and cheapest of current animation has come.

Strangely, one of the biggest disappointments of this particular release of Kimba was that the original theme song (still retained in my memory after all these years: ""Who lives down in deepest, darkest Africa...?"") has been replaced by a pointless ditty chirping about everybody's favorite lion Kimba. Odd how much of a disappointment that was...

You can never go back again, I suppose, and I recommend that your fond memories of Kimba the White Lion be left in their misty, affectionate form, unassailed by the harsh light of reality cast by viewing these archival cartoons.",1180915200,,1789,4.993288590604027
