8310691,5,B000WQ6IZS,"Clannad in it's entirety is an extremely solid, varied, and creative series. It is definitely worth a buy when it finally becomes available.

Originating from the key visual novel, Clannad is an extremely long story, so long, in fact, that Clannad ~After Story~, a 24 episode direct continuation to the first season (of 23 episodes), was needed simply to finish telling the visual novel's lengthy story.

Clannad might at first seem in the mold of many other series that are based on visual novels, but it is unique in that it's sexual components are extremely toned down. Fan service, nudity, nigh any typical 'naughty bits' are nowhere to be found, a refreshing change from many comparable series that use sexuality exclusively as a driving point for story and humor. Instead, Clannad is a 'slice of life' series in which we see the triumphs and miseries of a very entertaining and likeable cast. While certain characters are painted in the 'anime archtypes' of cuteness, shyness, and innocence, most of the story arcs have themes that are overwhelmingly universal. Clannad's driving point is the emotion it evokes; mainly, the fluctuation between joy and sorrow. Fuko's arc is a perfect example of these differing emotions, a beautiful and painful reminder of both the brevity of our lives, and the importance and power of our will when we truly commit.

Apart from the feel of the story, Clannad visually is a treat, smooth animation, attractive character designs, and good backgrounds (without any loss of quality or 'lazy animation') are standard. Similarly, the OP and ED, are . When Clannad finally is released stateside (or wherever you live), give the series a try. I think you'll agree that Clannad is what all visual novel-based anime series strive for; a fulfilling and meaningful experience.",1227571200,,1805,5.050335570469799
