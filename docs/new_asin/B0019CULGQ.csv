8326985,5,B0019CULGQ,"My first impression of this DVD was the price, "" WOW"" why is this so expensive?  After some hesitation I decided to purchase it, to my happy surprise it was well worth the money considering the amount of information it contained.  The DVD package is nicely done, also the insert that outlines a summery origin of the form and it's training philosophy is a nice touch.  Good angles showing the form in different directions, also the technical explanation is a good start for the layman beginner.
Over  all considering the wealth of information in this DVD, it's worth the money.  For those that have some martial arts back round this is a form you can learn from a DVD, Eddie Lane Sifu has given Wong Fei Hung's Fu Hok Seong Yin Kuen much respect
