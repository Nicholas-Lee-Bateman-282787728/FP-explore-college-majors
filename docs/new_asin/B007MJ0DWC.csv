This film really holds up and delivers a great level of excitement and was to me, one of Brian keith's best films.  A must for his fans.",1407801600,5,250,4.636363636363637
5099899,4,B007MJ0DWC,"I had to get this after ""Sorcerer"" and ""The Wages of Fear"" so I'd have all three films based on the same book. In that company, this rates no better than a Bronze medal, but that's no excuse no to see it. Interesting twist on the story and not quite so ""dark"". Mr. Keith makes the film, in my opinion.",1384128000,4,301,4.033333333333333

5099901,4,B007MJ0DWC,"I had watched this movie as a small boy, and loved it! It was only until recently that I actually found out what the title was after have forgotten all these years. It still kept me on the edge of my seat like it did then! The only problem I have with the movie, would be that the picture quality isn't that good, it's fuzzy or slightly blurry over all, like looking through a mist! If they would digitally remaster this quality, it would be perfect! Once and if you can get past that part, it's fun to watch!",1364256000,2,509,4.151515151515151
5099902,4,B007MJ0DWC,"This is an American remake of the French film ""Wages of Fear"". The premise didn't sound that good given that remakes tend usually to be worse than the original. But this was unexpectedly good and a good representative of a certain type of 1950s movie.

The film is about a bunch of truck drivers running a dangerous cargo in exchange for a lot of money. They run the trucks through an empty desert landscape and run into about every problem there is with a truck.

Brian Keith turns in one of the best performances of his career in the film. He is the boss of the drivers. Each one is different problem and Keith keeps them in line and driving onward. The character development is actually better than Wages of Fear. Even if the action is often not as good as Wages of Fear.",1339977600,5,774,4.368055555555555
8519533,3,B007MJ0DWC,"The truckers had to ship a dangerous liquid, very corrosive.  A leak developed, and instead of using a wrench, or
putting on proper gloves, the man closed off the leaky valve by hand.  Then badly burned.  This is ridiculous.
If there was a special shipment, it could be escorted by police or National Guard (at a safe distance).",1518652800,,328,4.620689655172414

8519540,1,B007MJ0DWC,"I really wanted to like this film. I knew it was basically an American remake of the excellent French film, The Wages of Fear. In Wages, a group of desperate man haul nitroglycerin over really treacherous jungle terrain, in old, decrepit unsafe trucks. In this film, the desperate individuals in question are hauling rocket fuel elements over, ""not quite as bad"" desert terrain, in not-so-bad trucks. I knew this much, so I'm thinking ""how bad can this movie be that it never became very popular?"" Well, to put it tactfully, this movie smells worse than the chemicals the truckers are driving. The overly dramatic, no make that melodramatic, moments in this film are almost unbearable-in the ""character development"" moments, where we get the back stories on the drivers, the characters are totally unsympathetic or even worse, annoying to the nth degree. There are two women in this film-one, Brian Keith's current love interest, who's a step up from a street hooker and the other, a shrewish harpy who makes you understand why her husband would volunteer for basically a suicide mission. Throw in Efrem Zimbalist Jr., as the angst-ridden inventor of the rocket fuel, who has guilt about a previous rocket launch disaster, and tries to atone by unnecessarily going along for the ride with these boys. Trust me, this is not a ride you want to go along on.",1421539200,,1354,4.891304347826087
8519541,3,B007MJ0DWC,"Modest thriller similar to the earlier feature ""Wages of Fear"" in which six men transport volatile components of rocket fuel over a dangerous route.  Running out of time to meet the deadline of a lucrative government contract, the Cyclone Rocket Company hires Mitch Barton, portrayed by Brian Keith, to organize a team that will haul the dangerous cargo over a mountain road to avoid populated areas.  The film is good, it contains the same components of ""Wages of Fear"" and ""Sorcerer"", but it doesn't have the depth due to its low budget.",1413072000,2,539,4.8478260869565215
8519542,4,B007MJ0DWC,"I remembered seeing this movie when I was a kid, but when I looked for it as an adult, could not find it on Netflix.  After buying it and watching it, I wonder what other ""gems"" are out there that I've missed.

This movie is a good story in and of itself, but it is also a glimpse into the culture of the 50's.  It takes place on the backroads of California,
has plenty of drama, excitement and action, and enough ""human interest"" to make you care about the characters.  Plus, you get to see actors early in
their careers.  I suppose it's a ""guy"" movie, but more than that it's a movie about people getting stuff done in a much simpler world.",1410048000,3,642,4.186991869918699
