First off, major thanks to Palm pictures for sending me a screener of this film so that I could review it. Quite the honor.

Review:

Ernie Chin is on the edge of that dangerous chasm called puberty. He is stepping over the line from boyhood, when playing with the little sister turns into bullying of the Barbie mutulation kind. I remember as a young teen, my sister had this off-brand singing mermaid doll that would sing the same seven notes over and over again, so that my hand was forced in delivering the aquatic mer-person to her doom at the city dump. Nuff said.

When we are between the ages 10 and 13, strange things occur, you ladies understand this as well. Our bodies begin to do wierd functions and hair sprouts out in the diverse places, and our hormones begin to become totally defunct - to put it mildly. Ernie is in this stage, where women are suddenly no longer just cootie farmers or moms, they are gloriously appealing - like some buried treasure suddenly unearthed from your own back yard. This is a little unsettling for Ernie's girl-friend (not girlfriend) Christine, who suddenly goes from pal to object of desire.

At home, in the motel that he and his family both live and work in, there is civil unrest between he and his mother, which seems bent on emotionally beating him into submission; Though I never felt that she was aiming for pure cruelty. Rather, it seems that she is parenting with a tough-love-drill-sargeant philosophy, which many parents do. Her character seems to have experienced this in her own past, though its not stated. If the whole film could be most simply dichotomized, it is really about their relationship.

One of the major highlights is the character played by Sung Kang from Tokyo Drift. He embodies a person who is empty and trying to fill the void with multiple prostitutes and lavish spending. His character is a knockout, and one of the better ones in recent memory. Loved his performance.

There are some truly funny moments that happens on the motel grounds, which I will not spoil. Must find out for your self, says I.

Motel is not been submitted to the MPAA for a rating, but if it were it would recieve an R. I can read the Motion Picture Association of America like a book, it would be something like this: Rated R for some strong sexual content/nudity, and language. So there you go.

Motel truly is a really good film. I have watched short-subject pictures and rated them simply as they are, but I couldn't do this in Motel. I had to knock off a star, because I loved the characters so much that 70 minutes made me feel slightly cheated and unresolved on what could have been a warm-welcomed 2 hour visit with the Chins.",1175817600,,2700,4.5850622406639
2667496,5,B000JBXHE6,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie! I know a guy who grew up as an asian american pre-teen running a motel with his family and he said it brought back lots of memories. There were some choice, funny moments in the movie and Michael Kang got some really great performances from the cast.

It got a couple Sundance awards and a prize at the San Francisco Asian American Film Festival.  I believe it was also nominated for an IFC Spirit award for 'Best First Feature.'

2667497,5,B000JBXHE6,This is such a great movie.  Seems like this movie was made about me.  Roy is played by such a great actor.  Pick up this movie,1170374400,,127,3.8076923076923075
2667498,4,B000JBXHE6,"i saw it the first time expecting it to be a type of comical ""napoleon dynamite"" movie. that is where it didn't quite cut it for me. so i saw it a second time focussing on puberty and relationships, that is where it excels. i wanted more from the mother and the movie in general, but it was just right to get the points across.",1170374400,,327,4.046153846153846
2667499,5,B000JBXHE6,"This movie is about an Asian-American adolescent and his younger sibling living a frugal existence in a seedy motel run by his mother. His life isn't so pretty in the presence of lowlifes, soiled sheets, and puberty, but he gets by. The boy and a sketchy drunkard (one of the motel's occupants) form a tentative friendship. The drunk becomes a sort of mentor while he vicariously confronts some problems in his own life. It's gritty, true-to-life, and funny. If you like simple, poignant portraits of American life this film is for you.

Don't expect ""Mr. Miyagi"" to turn up in this movie. If you're looking for Zen Buddhism, Anime schoolgirls, or just another silly martial arts-exploitation film, just back slowly away...",1166227200,11,723,4.975206611570248
2667542,2,B000JBXHE6,"Overall, an interesting idea for a movie, following the life of a Chinese teenage boy whose family owns a local Motel that he works at after school.
After thirty minutes in, despite a few funny scenes, I had to stop watching. The movie just wasn't going anywhere. The whole idea for a story is to present your character, and then throw them a curve ball where they have to ""sink or swim"". Action drives the story forward. Where was the action?  The only action I saw, in the thirty minutes I gave it to do something before I turned it off, was the kid pushing his maid cart around. It's not enough. I don't have all day to give a movie, you've got to hook me within at least thirty minutes. And in fact, the hook is supposed to be in the first ten minutes.
Total let down in the story and character development.
The movie is based on a book, and I'd be curious to know if the book is any better.
I will not be buying this movie for my collection.  You're shocked, I know.",1330732800,,971,4.18716577540107
2667543,4,B000JBXHE6,"The movie is not rated. It would be an R with the brief nudity, sexual situations, and occasional bad language (MF bomb).

The film starts out on a light note with 13 year old Ernest eating an egg roll sitting on a dumpster outside a Chinese restaurant. He is smitten by a 15 year old girl working at the restaurant with whom he shares life and growing up experiences. Ernest is in love, while the girl (Christine) doesn't hold the same feelings. (Such is life.)

There are some funny scenes and others that make you feel awkward. (Spoiler) The best acting scene was at the very end when he comes face to face with his mother. There is no conversation, just a look of understanding on both their faces. This would have been a great turning point for the film, but alas it ends here. Made me hungry for more.

Has anyone else ever eaten 3 day old Popeye's chicken they found left behind in a Motel room?",1276992000,,902,4.357142857142857
2667544,4,B000JBXHE6,"If your desire in watching The Motel is to stare in at someone else's life, or re-affirm your faith in the ultimate goodness of life, then choose another film.

If, on the other hand, you thrive on being shaken, disturbed, cut into pieces that you have to re-assemble following the film, then you will respect and
nurture yourself by viewing The Motel.

The hero--or anti-hero--of the film, Ernest, experiences attacks on his germinating self from his raw mom, his would-be teen paramour (she scowls
and laughs when he envisions them married), his past-ridden grandfather, his jock teen neighbor, and even his met-by-chance guide through puberty.

Specifically, he endures slaps across the face from his mom; tales of being duped by fake contests from his grandfather; wrestling defeats from his
girlfriend; and being cornered by his puberty guide into smashing him with a baseball bat so that he will leave the motel Ernest's mother operates.

It's healthily unsettling, and shakes you for a reason: to re-assemble a stronger, more seasoned human being.

If that's on your to-do list, then give yourself the 1 hour and 20 minutes to allow the film to seep into you.

You'll never regret it.",1267920000,,1191,4.98989898989899
2667545,4,B000JBXHE6,"Jeffrey Chyau is great in this film - he is the perfect embodiment of the character of Ernest. This film explores the angst and trials of being a teenager with empathy and poignancy and regular doses of comedy. Sung Kang, as Sam Kim, gives a strong performance to drive the plot forward and does a great job at being the 'anti-hero'.",1260316800,,333,4.475409836065574
2667546,3,B000JBXHE6,"The Motel is like a successful blind date: the conversation is not terribly interesting or engaging, but the banter is pleasant and non-offensive; the food isn't gourmet or great but the serving sizes are adequate and no one leaves hungry. At the end of this movie you will feel that you didn't waste your time, but you might not want to pursue it.

Actually, for a small budgeted indie film, this one does earn some points. The acting is superlative, the setting (a seedy motel that rents rooms by the hour) is genuine and the cinematography is honest. But the story doesnt go anywhere and creates little visceral response.

 It is a  3 1/2 stars film-- 4 stars if you can identify with the Chinese-American, cultural coming of age theme.",1221264000,,739,4.661538461538462
2667547,4,B000JBXHE6,"I've seen this movie in my school as a part of an Asian Club event, Michael Kang, the director of the movie came to my school to talk a bit about his movie. Being an asian american kid myself, my parents had to work endless jobs to get their kids a good future, of course, we also had to help work for them too. I definitely would recommend this not only because it is a sneak peek to a life that is rarely told, but it also is about growing up and that sometimes the ""bad influences"" may end up being the good ones.",1219017600,,516,3.9711538461538463
2667548,5,B000JBXHE6,"If you are a fan of Sung Kang's and not sure if you should buy this movie or not, trust me. It is a really good buy. You won't regret. I like all of the characters in this movie. Very attractive and no fake feeling.",1208649600,,215,3.8
2667549,3,B000JBXHE6,"The Motel (Michael Kang, 2003)

The reviews have been divided on this one. I've been going through them because I have no idea what to say about it. I got it, I watched it, and by the time the movie ended, I had forgotten most of it-- this despite it having an exceptionally short running time for a feature (seventy-six minutes).

It's a coming of age tale about Ernest (Jeffrey Chyau), whose mother runs a seedy hourly-rate motel. He has no father, but finds an approximation in Sam (The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift's Sung Chang), who attempts to drag him kicking and screaming into the world of adulthood so he can win the girl of his dreams, Katie (Alexis Chang), whose parents run a nearby Chinese restaurant.

I can't really put my finger on what it was about the movie that didn't grab me, but perhaps it's just the absence of stuff to grab me that did it. There wasn't anything that really stood out here. All of it was competent, but nothing more than that. A good time-killer, but not one to go out of your way for. ** ",1185926400,,1035,4.375
2667550,5,B000JBXHE6,"This is a quirky, charming and irreverent indy film that stars Jeffrey Chyau as Ernest Chinn a 13 year old Chinese-American boy whose family runs a seedy motel where he works the night shift. It has the feel of one of my old old cult favorites TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME JUNIE MOON...with a bit of Weekend at Bernie's tossed in and a bit of American Graffiti on the dark side. Can you imagine coming of age where sex and drugs and the bizarre are the rule rather than the random occurance. Chyau is amazing, stoic yet poignant, awkward yet wise beyond his years. Befriended by a Korean fast Eddie type dude crashing at his parents motel, he gets the first feelings of having a big brother or father yet that whiff is complex and unstable like the rest of his life. Chin proves that puberty sucks at any age and place. This film won the humanitarian prize at Sundance and it is humanity at its best and its worse. Why is it so hard to grow up? Chyau is a stubby chubby kid and that adds to the challenge especially today when so many kids are overweight and often overlooked by busy parents. Samantha Futerman (Memoirs of a Geisha) brings a sweetness to 15 year old Christine who is Chinn's first girlfriend or at least he yearns for her to be. The DVD includes cast audition tapes, behind the scenes featurettes and deleted scenes. It's a rainy day kind of movie in mood.",1177200000,4,1369,4.372549019607843
2667551,4,B000JBXHE6,"The Motel is a coming of age story which tells the story of Ernest Chin, a thirteen year old boy living and working at his family's motel.  It is clear he is interested in his fifteen year old friend, Christine, but she seems to treat him as a younger brother.  Ernest is trapped in his life (as one would expect from barely a teenager).  Ernest is just going into puberty and he is in a very awkward phase.  Sam Kin is a drifter of sorts who checks into the motel and somehow befriends Ernest and tries to mentor the boy, though in a unconventional sort of way.

The Motel is a very low key movie, filled with humor, nostalgia, and sadness, but it is surprisingly good and moving.  Ernest is so awkward that we root for him to get something going in his life but understand why it is difficult for him.  This understated movie is well done and at a 80 minute run time, is worth the small time investment to see a different sort of coming of age movie.  There is nothing flashy here, but a decent movie which we do not see presented quite like this on the big screen.

Note to parents: With the coming of age nature, there are some sexual situations and nudity...none of it with the children, but it is in the movie.  Some language, too.

8149442,5,B000JBXHE6,"I love this movie. It is a great indie feature with several symbolic layers to the story. The nudity is actually not gratuitous as it fits the theme of coming-of-age sexuality in several key ways. The script is actually very tight and the tension between male fantasy sexuality vs. reality is paralleled in the older Korean guy who becomes like a hot mess of an older brother.  This guy a is warning for the protagonist but also a temptation.

The only weakness I think is the end. It needs one more scene I think besides the one with the mom.  It's rather sour note to end on what should be a movie about a boy spreading his wings. His submitting completely back to the mom at the end didn't quite work for me but it was in character I suppose.",1473811200,,745,4.307142857142857

8149445,5,B000JBXHE6,"Jade Wu is great in this little film .  It's not filled with action or sex but it's brimming over with humor and human feelings , not Bathos and not Pathos but truthfully performed .  I am only familiar with Jade Wu's work .  The other players are marvelous  .  This should become a cult classic on par with Taking Woodstock , (one of my favorite films of all time) . Motel is the greatest little movie that develops into a big movie ...if you are moved by cross cultural interaction you will get a hint at what it's like to be Asian . This is the most under-rated films of all time ....I have watched it four times ...each time gleaning more richness and talent from the cleverly devised story line which is not the predictable strings of this modern wonder of an independent film .",1441929600,2,783,4.299319727891157

8149448,3,B000JBXHE6,"This movie is supposedly based on a great book called Waylaid but the only thing they have in common is that the main character is Asian and lives at his parents' motel. I realize it is hard to turn one into the other but to toss out 99% of the scenes and characters makes no sense. They were obviously trying to make a family friendly movie but even the more ""adult"" parts of Waylaid are still based in the character's innocence. If it weren't for the excellent acting of the star I would have turned it off.",1409961600,,509,4.257731958762887
8149449,4,B000JBXHE6,"It's just above average. Mainly because it's a low budget movie and at least they had good story line and actors playing their parts.

It's about a young Asian-American boy (Chinese-American to be exact), who works in his family owned motel. They live in a rural area and nothing really around. He gets bullied by a local kid what seems like a daily thing. He has one female friend another Asian-American, which he kind of likes, but she doesn't really like him.

The boy seems like he just going with the flow and nothing to do with his life. He is a good writer, but his mom doesn't think he is that good and puts him down for entering a writing contest. Then, when he doesn't win, she puts him even downer.

The boy then meets this older Asian-American guy and gets to know him because he is staying at the motel now. They becomes friends and he seems to enjoy his life more. The older guy encourage him to enjoy life and helps him try to get his dream girl.

Eventually, the boy will have to learn one of life hard lessons, which is we don't always get what we want. Then, everything seems to get back to normal and his relationship with his mother seems to be somewhat better now.

I recommend this movie. It's not the best movie out there, but it delivers a decent good time.",1336867200,,1281,4.320833333333334
8149450,5,B000JBXHE6,"The main kid in this coming of age story is a superb ""first-time"" actor, it's a complicated story done very simply.  It's like ""Napoleon Dynamite"" meets a Wes Anderson film.  This is film lovers film, no doubt.  I only accidentally purchased ""Motel"" at Amoeba Music because of its inexpensive price and its ""Ghost World"" style cover, being more like a Graphic Novel.  I absolutely enjoyed its every-day life humor about family and growing up, tossed in with a not so usual setting of a Motel used for drunks and prostitutes.  Combined with its indie soundtrack, any Todd Solondz lover would admire this movie's dark spirit and its uplifting metaphors.  I suggest to watch it and then pass on the word.  If you're a collector like me, just buy it and put it next to your Gregg Araki/David Lynch collection you keep separated on your DVD mantel!!!",1334880000,3,845,4.7465753424657535
8149451,4,B000JBXHE6,"Ive watched it about 20 times now.  pretty good movie. its worth seeing. Not a kids movie, though, like some may be lead to believe.  The humor isn't very strong, its more of one of those ""awkward things you don't tell anyone you did as a kid"" type movies.",1331078400,,256,4.204081632653061
