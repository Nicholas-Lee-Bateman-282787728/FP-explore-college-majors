4235332,4,B003ZTNT38,As long as you know this isn't Hollywood then you have a different scale to compare it to--it is so hammy but the story line is great--you can't stop watching it because of the ridiculous twist and turns and the relationships are wild--it is halarious--there isn't a note of anything in it taking itself serious and as long as you stay on that ride its really awesome--its like a group of film students doing a homework project together on a 1/2 of shoestring budget--the acting is poor but again they must be students and they don't even take themselves serious---the skin is good too--i cant wait till the next movie 'unsolved summer suburbia' or something---bye now-i gotta go watch it again--enjoy,1306713600,3,701,4.801652892561983
4235333,1,B003ZTNT38,"Don't let the cover art or the synopsis fool you. Cheesy movie. Appears to have been done with a handheld personal video cam. The acting was awful, dialogue bad, and the storyline absurd. Don't wast your money on this.",1296086400,7,218,4.615384615384615
4235334,3,B003ZTNT38,"Marty is a high school senior who is gay ... on weekdays.  Weekends, he has a girlfriend.  Life gets complicated when the girlfriend meets the boyfriend, then implausible when they decide to become one combined, happy ""triple.""

But Marty is also concerned about his friend Jake, whose claim to fame seems to be as a peeping Tom, a skill which reportedly he has used to influence friends and make some spare cash.  Then there's Thomas, whom Marty helps to hide after Thomas' boyfriend Eddie is shot, possibly by Thomas' homophobic brother, a theory with which Marty disagrees.

This is essentially a parody of an old film noir mystery - complete with ""red herring"" tangents - crossed with a ""gay boys go wild"" sex comedy. The screenwriter seamlessly uses black and white as well as color photography, dramatic music, and multiple showings of scenes from different perspectives.  It gets rather confusing, though the inexperienced actors make a shaky script and meandering dialogue seem better with their efforts, for the most part. Coming in at just 66 minutes, counting the numerous repeats of scenes, there simply isn't much here, if you look at the film as a whole. DVD has only chapter stops; not rated, but would be an R for lots of male and female nudity.  I'll give it just three stars out of five.",1287446400,10,1305,4.799107142857143

4235336,1,B003ZTNT38,Disjointed story. I could never tell who was who -- perhaps it was the darkness and the photography. Motivations were murky.,1461801600,,124,4.9523809523809526

4235340,3,B003ZTNT38,For a free movie - this one was not too bad - the ending was a bit surprising - I expected a different ending - but I liked the one they showed.  There were a lot of characters that were a bit confusing at first - but again - a good movie and worth watching - some cuties for sure,1445558400,,280,3.6666666666666665

4235343,1,B003ZTNT38,This movie is a garbled mess.  Characters are confusing and plot (loosely used) twists are ambiguous and confusing.  Fortunately it's short and you are put of your misery quickly.,1429488000,3,179,5.137931034482759

4235345,3,B003ZTNT38,"It's not a great movie, but it's not bad either. It could have been better if I had a better clue as to what the heck was going on. At first, this appears to be a film about one confused bisexual, but turns out to be a sort of murder mystery that has way too many twists (M. Night Shaymalan, anyone?). Honestly, it's a sub-par movie produced by a sub-par GLBT-themed production company.",1420329600,,386,4.301369863013699

4235352,3,B003ZTNT38,"NOT MUCH OF ACTING HERE. I DID NOT FINISH VIEWING IT. SORRY GUYS.

4235354,2,B003ZTNT38,"the acting was sub-par and the storyline vague or confusing.  What's the point of this movie?  Its a series of vignettes into the minds of various teens who seemed obsessed with sex??

4235357,1,B003ZTNT38,I love some B movies.  They're fun to watch and you can see the labor of love that went into them.  But I couldn't get through 20 minutes of this one.,1390435200,,150,3.806451612903226
4235358,2,B003ZTNT38,too slow moving for me. took to long to develop a  story line and characters were so so. i 'll try watching it again to see if i missed something.,1389830400,,146,3.8666666666666667
4235359,2,B003ZTNT38,"Two weeks after seeing this movie for the SECOND time, I'm still wondering what this film is about. It was very difficult to follow, and several of the intersecting plot lines didn't see to be any more than tangentially related. Most of the actors delivered highly amateurish performances -- sort of like high schoolers who haven't yet had the benefit of a good director and acting lessons.",1387670400,,390,4.835820895522388
4235360,2,B003ZTNT38,"I thought this movie was going to be better...by the cover I saw but it turned out to be rather dull.  There's not much plot to it...a few teens messing around with each other and life.  I watched it all because I paid for it...but if I knew it would be this dull...I would have passed on it.  I had read other so-so reviews...took a chance...and now I agree with the unfavorable reviews I read.  Off to the next yard sale with this CD...maybe, if I'm lucky, I'll be able to get a buck for it...if not...it'll be a free-be!",1333497600,,523,4.2
4235361,3,B003ZTNT38,I really enjoyed this movie.  It was funny and a very pleasant surprise.  I have watched it twice so far.  Interesting plot twists and the story moves along quickly.,1318032000,3,165,4.620689655172414
4235362,2,B003ZTNT38,"Unsolved Suburbia is a gay noir drama. The cast is comprised of mostly teen characters. And boy, is it a mess! There is some humor (but not enough), and some good nudity (but again not enough). However, that's where the positives stop. Everything else, from the acting, to the pacing, to the direction is pretty bad. And the plot goes back and forth, and it makes things really confusing. How Unsolved Suburbia got released is a mystery that is and will always be ""Unsolved"". 2 stars out of 5 for the nudity and cute guys.",1316563200,,522,4.505263157894737
4235363,1,B003ZTNT38,"Are there a few cute boys in this movie? Yes. Does that make it worth it? No. Stupid acting and a script, if you can call it that, which left me dumbfounded as to what the movie was about. In the end, more crass than corny. Not worth it.",1309651200,2,237,3.857142857142857
4235364,1,B003ZTNT38,"Amazing only in the fact that this was actually released.  Without a doubt, the WORST movie I have ever seen.  After viewing it and being tempted to stop in the first 5 minutes, I wanted to wash my eyes out with soap.

The acting was universally horrible.  The story excessively convoluted without reason with far too many characters to keep track of and with no characters who I could ever care about.

Save your money and your time...don't buy it or watch it.",1308009600,2,461,4.506024096385542

8410926,3,B003ZTNT38,"This is obviously a low budget (very low budget) production. Having said that one must also see this film for what it is, most likely a film school project. So, seeing it  for what it is, here is my take-away.
the production values was rather good, as was the story line and the flow. the acting is not good, but keep in mind this is a student project, witch means the cast was more likely friends and family. this director and writer shows promise and hopefully they will have the support and resource to hone their craft. I hope to see great things out of them in the next 10 years or so.
Very good job guys or gals, not a great film, but a good one in the form of cinematography, writing, and yes production values. and the use of black and white was just right. this hawkens to the days of the infancy of film making. I kind of see a hint of Hitchcock in it.
If this was re-made with actual actors it would be outstanding. change nothing else, just get actors.",1525564800,,964,4.210810810810811
8410927,4,B003ZTNT38,"It's certainly a movie you need to pay attention. It's modeled after the 40's film noire, kind of like a detective story. Not for everyone, but I found it enjoyable.

It's easy to get lost. Judging by the low reviews and what they say about this movie, obviously those people did.",1520467200,,280,4.490196078431373
