8563755,4,B00B7VI1RA,"I found this show on the net as it does not play here in Australia. I am a music fan and thought it would be interesting to see more about the Nashville area and see how it compares to what is pictured in music from the area. Wow is it a great looking place and now on the top of my list of places to visit if I go back to the USA again.

Hayden playing a bitch rather than the usual goodey two shoes is cool. The only thing I had seen Connie in was Friday Night Lights which plays here but is not that popular a show as we don't have the football fetish Americans have and their game always seems a bit light weight compared to the versions played here. Still I would not have pictured her as a singer but having seen Nashville, she sure has her Reba vibes working for her.

Snippets of the Civil Wars and Marinda Lambert slipped into the background music got me hooked and I have already purchased two of the show's albums because of the cool lyrics. I knew Hayden could sing and have seen her on YouTube but she fits right into this show like she was made for it.

Highly recommended for anyone who loves music and is interested in how it is created and what the scene is like in a place like Nashville. I kept looking in the crowds to see if Keith Urban popped up to give it a bit of an Australian feel LOL.",1384300800,,1311,4.0346153846153845
