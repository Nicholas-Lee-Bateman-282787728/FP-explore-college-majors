7684919,1,B01CKJE234,"I am offended that amateur filmmakers chose the Holocaust as the subject for this very amateur film.  There are already zillions of Holocaust dramas in existence. This film made zero contribution to the subject of the Holocaust.  Just the opposite.  If these people had made a (decent) Holocaust documentary, I would not have been offended.  But, to make a cheesy, schlocky drama and use the Holocaust as the subject matter is a very cheap shot.  The Holocaust is way too serious and way too sensitive a topic for these people to have been so presumptuous as to handle it with their amateur hands.

While I am no film critic, there were many things obviously wrong with the filmhere are just a fewthe young girl in the film wore a star of David necklace.  No Jew fleeing Nazis would ever do that.  When she is hidden in the back of a wagon and has to go through a Nazi gatepost, she is merely under a blanket.  After living in an abandoned house for a year, her dress shows no wear. The spoken German parts were obviously written by someone who had a couple of years of high school German and poorly pronounced.  The Hebrew prayers were so poorly pronounced they were upsetting to the point of being sacrilegious.

For your next film stick to cowboys and Indians, this subject was way too ambitious for you and you had no business touching upon it.",1465084800,11,1348,4.528925619834711

7684922,1,B01CKJE234,"Terrible casting and accents! The main character, Adira (Andrea Fantauzzi), who is supposed to be a young Jewish girl, is not believable in the role. Even with a childish bob at the beginning of the movie she looks like she is in her mid-20s. Then after being in the woods alone for several years, we are led to believe she gets her period for the first time. That's just the tip of the iceberg. For such a serious topic, it is offensive how careless they were about details.",1513728000,2,475,4.409090909090909
7684923,5,B01CKJE234,"This is a slow, detailed movie about a young Jewish teenager who goes into hiding for 3 years after her parents were captured by the Nazi army. She becomes very resourceful after her food runs out.  The filmography of the forest, streams and animals was wonderful and also the background music was intense.  This is a story that needed to be told.",1511481600,,347,4.580645161290323

She is a strong female figure. It is also a poignant reminder of the far reaching costs of war. It illustrates depth of loss at  and the impact of losing family, especially at such a young age.",1508457600,,342,4.34375
7684926,5,B01CKJE234,"I loved this movie! it's great for kids and adults. I highly recommend this as a family movie. It's not too violent so it's ok for some kids and young adult. It teaches them how to have strength , faith and encourage and the importance in believing in yourself and your own strength not just physically but mentally. It's worth giving it a chance!",1505433600,,347,4.4375

7684930,4,B01CKJE234,"Jarringly inaccurate. Day  210 would have been in December but there was neither snow nor any sign of winter. That detail can be forgiven in a low budget movie. However in the flashback of an illness to have a European Jew speaking in Hebrew is an impossibility. The conversation should have done as it was in that place and time, i.. e. In Yiddish. Granted prayers at table and Adira's own prayers  the film is a mess when it comes to historical accuracy, but it is still a good piece of fiction",1502150400,,496,4.380434782608695

I am sure I could have googled and found out under what misguided motivation this disaster came to me, but I wouldn't waste the time.",1501545600,,287,4.538461538461538
7684932,5,B01CKJE234,"A beautiful film, well written and directed by two talented young filmmakers. It is a tribute to those children forgotten during the German persecution against the Jews. It has no waste of resources and if much talent and good performances remembering that it is an independent production, without the necessary capital to achieve what others achieve based on effects and many millions of dollars. We congratulate the entire cast, especially Irene Delmonte, writer and Brad Lincoln.",1498521600,,482,5.355263157894737
7684933,3,B01CKJE234,"It was a nice little story, perhaps for older Children and teens?..  For Adults, it expected a lot of not noticing that the actress was a young woman playing a little girl,  wearing a little girl's dress and shoes, for 3 years, as another reviewer said.  Her hair was always beautifully clean, even if there was no soap to be had.  What Child could live through cold winters, inside a shell of what was once a house?..  Yes the producers and director of this film I guess expected us, to see this film as a fable, where it was the story that counted, and not a real depiction of anything.",1496707200,2,588,4.3090909090909095

7684935,2,B01CKJE234,"Stick a bad wig on an adult actress and pretend she is a child, rather than hire a child to play the child part.

Have the actress playing a child lost and starving in the wild for 3 years look bursting with health, plump rosy cheeked with clean shining hair.",1494288000,3,333,4.138461538461539

I would have rated it just okay but I gave it the extra star because it was a clean watch and could easily be used for homeschooling older children. It was very slow in the beginning. The acting from the girl as she escaped and was running through the forest was a little over dramatic but it got better after a while.",1489795200,2,465,3.9574468085106385

7685005,4,B01CKJE234,"This is the story of a young Jewish girl in hiding at her grandfather's abandoned farm in Germany during the war.  The plot is not quite believable, and we can objectively look at the movie and ponder all the things we would do differently, but we are dealing with a child who manages to survive over 3 years waiting for the resistance to rescue her and reunite her with her parents.  She has no idea what is going on in the outside.  There is a spot where she turns on a radio she found in another abandoned house; unbelievable since there was no electricity.  We might assume she was hallucinating.  Also there was a lantern that would have long been used up.  Then again this is not a true story, a bit of a fairy tale, but interesting enough for the watch.  An allied soldier in hiding happens upon her.  In the meantime two German soldiers arrive in this remote area and kill a Jewish couple and the girl sees this.  See the rest for yourself.

7685020,4,B01CKJE234,"The young actress was not perhaps top notch, but her recorded voice-overs were fine, and I thought the British soldier who showed up after her isolation at a deserted farm (fleeing the Nazis) was especially good, but I found the camera-hovering on the scenery too extended and those backwoods looked nothing like Europe. Then I learned in the credits that the film was shot is (yes) Missouri.",1465862400,6,392,4.865671641791045
8753387,1,B01CKJE234,"If you cannot afford a budget for a believable looking wig on the main character, then don't waste my time. Like the other reviewer said this is a low budget silly movie. Who would hide a girl in a truck and just throw a blanket on her then spit in the face of a guard? Yeah right. Pathetic.",1537747200,,291,4.0344827586206895
8753388,1,B01CKJE234,"First; they used an adult actress with a bad wig to portray a child. Then, the gazpacho had a bad German accent and didn't bother to look for the girl. What? Then the drivers acted completely unbelievably, spitting in a Nazis face... for what reason I cannot fathom. Drama? Of course they get shot.

The girl has magic hair that never looks bad. She has a dress that never gets holes and stays relatively clean, even after months and years outdoors.  Even more unbelievable were the stockings that were still going strong and hole free for years on end... in the forest. She even has a magical period, where the menstrual blood defies gravity and bleeds up! The ridiculousness continues!

Somehow she survives all this time walking around with a giant spear. Come ON. What Jew hiding from Nazis would wear a Star of David necklace?!

The  miraculously stupid yet somehow sole surviving British Paratrooper enters the movie. His accent is WTF? His description of a concentration camp is beyond laughable. Yep- he hung out for hours or days just out of sight and learned all about the inner workings of the camp and failed to mention it until days in. The story there unfolds exactly as youd assume. Of course he is handsome and an even match for age and attractiveness to the main lady.

The Nazis look like they are out of some British comedy show. The military wear definitely needed some work- the British one too.

Obligatory execution of innocent jewish folks? Check.
Obligatory overdone and fake female empowerment message? Check. Over and over.
Obligatory almost rape scene? Check!
Obligatory saved just in time from previously mentioned rape scene? Check.
Random, drastic changes in behavior for no explicable reason? Check!

Lazy, embarrassing storytelling, acting and props that not support; but INSULT the stories of Nazi survivors all over the world. I am sick and tired of people making these films on serious subjects that deserve our respect And mutilating them while still getting great reviews from people who feel bad about the subject itself. Its cheap and its gross!

Shame!",1534118400,4,2093,4.906515580736544

8753392,4,B01CKJE234,"Overall this was a good movie. Adira was portrayed as a young girl of maybe 12 or 13, but her appearance was much older than that of her character. As the movie progressed after 3 years she states that she is 18 which would  have made her 15 years old at the time of the escape. Yet still she was dressed as a young school girl. At first when she found the radio I was thinking electric, but quickly remembered that at that time there were battery operated radios. The ending brought closure to her life and brought her peace. The actors were not big named actors, but portrayed their parts very well.",1526688000,,601,4.31858407079646
8753393,4,B01CKJE234,Who knows whether some situations like this really occurred in the horror that was WWII. I wouldn't be surprised. I thought it was interesting and showed the courage that probably anyone who avoided the concentration camps would have to show in order to survive. I liked it.,1526256000,,274,4.851063829787234

The actors were amazing its worth a watch in my opinion the movie kept my attention for sure! I appreciate what the movie is about. 11 percent !!!! So sad,1517702400,,276,4.226415094339623
