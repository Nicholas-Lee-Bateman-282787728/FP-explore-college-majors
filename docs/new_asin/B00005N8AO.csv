1629390,5,B00005N8AO,(...) This Tournament was great but the second one was twice as good as the first one. this tournament had funny parts like Carlito Montana forgeting his shirt and getting torn to peaces and landing in the bulbs but hey its all good. (...),1007078400,,239,4.454545454545454
1629391,1,B00005N8AO,"I couldn't give this 0 Stars. I wish I could have. I have no idea what people are doing giving this DVD 5 and 4 stars. This DVD has no matchs that were even close to being 3 star quality. The matches have many, many, many mess up spots. The matches move slowly, very slowly. A quick match that last like 5 to 7 min. seemed to go on for ever.
 Like the match between Kronic and JN, I would much rather put my Yam Bag in a meat grinder than watch that agian. Kronic couldn't even do a Bull-Dog right and that JN couldn't sell a body slam if his life depended on it. The announceing is horrible, with the Latino Guy being one of the announcers. You couldn't understand what he said and when you could understand him he was stealing an old-schoolers line. All in all this DVD isn't worth the money. They don't show some of there big guns (if they really have any) such as Pogo the Clown or Damien 666. If you want a good Hardcore DVD check out ECW (any of them are good) or the first couple FMW DVDs, or wait and get one of the new FMW DVDs comming out in late Oct. (I recomend International Slaughterhouse; ECW v. FMW <YAY!>)",1001980800,5,1122,4.1
1629392,2,B00005N8AO,"This has got to be the worst attempt at a deathmatch tournament in wrestling history. I spent the 25 bucks to see what xpw was all about and to be completely honest, don't waste your money. Former ECW stars John Kronus, Chris Candido, Shane Douglas, and Axl Rotten all make a presence felt, but that is not worth the 25 bucks. Supreme granted is a big man and took some pretty sick bumps is no Mick Foley. The Xpw's version of Ric Blade(czw/japw) comes off as a more guts than brains high flyer. The world title match between the real deal damien steele and Chris Candido is nothing special. People don't waste your money, buy ECW's Hardcore History, or Path of Destruction and you won't be dissapointed.",998092800,8,704,4.551181102362205
1629393,5,B00005N8AO,"I have not seen this DVD yet since it is set for release 8-7-01. But I can say that the 1st Baptized In Blood release contains some of the most BRUTAL Death Matches I have ever seen. I would only expect the same thing from this wild card filled with all the sickest stipulation matches in Professional Wrestling!
1. Vic Grimes vs. Kraq (Bed of Barbed Wire & Nails Match) 2. Kronus vs. Homeless Jimmy (Bed of Light Bulbs & Broken Glass Match) 3. Nozawa vs. White Trash Johnny Webb (Barbed Wire Ladder & Bed of Thumbtacks Match) 4. Steve Rizzono vs. Pogo the Clown (Bed of Barbed Wire & Thumbtacks Match) 5.

BED OF EVERYTHING DEATHMATCH!) 8. Messiah vs. the WINNER of the tournament 9. New Jack vs. Mr. 80's Dynamite D 10. Messiah vs. Tool 11. Juventud Guerrera vs. Kid Kaos Note: This is the match listing I have seen for the VHS.  I would expect the same on the DVD.",995673600,,1055,4.301507537688442
1629394,4,B00005N8AO,"This is XPW's second video release. I'm a huge fan of XPW and this video has it's ups and downs. The first match is a round one match between Supreme vs. Kid Kaos with involves beds of barbed wire and nails. I think fans would love the high flying mixed in with the use of barbed wire. I think it's a good match. Next match is ""White Trash"" Jonny Web vs. The Messiah in a thumb tack ladder match. They definetly take full use of the thumbtacks in this match and alot of the bumbs these guys take are really cool. The next match is Kronus vs. Carlito Montana in a bed of barbed wire and lightbulbs match. First to say the match was too short. The only highlight is when Kronus throws Carlito on the bed of lightbulbs. There's also a part in the match when Kronus throws Monana on a table but the table doesn't break. The match was very dissapointing. The next match was Axl Rotten vs. Homeless Jimmy in a bed of glass and nails match. Another dissapointing match. Axl uses his trademark barbed wire ax handle most of the match but this match is also short. and the only big part of the match is when Axl hits Jimmy with a chair and he lands on the bed of glass. The next match wasn't part of the tournament. It was Chronic vs. J.N. This was probibly the worst match of the whole video. On three ocasions, J.N. pukes. Chronic tries to do a bulldog from the top rope to the table but he messes up and the crowd boos them. Then later there's a run-in by Mustafa and him and Chronic throw J.n. threw a table. I'd advise you to fast foward threw this match. The next match is my personal favorte of the match. It's second round match of the tournament between Supreme and The Messiah in a bed of thumbtacks and barbed wire match. This match is what all hardcore fans would love. Both wrestlers give it there all in this match. Its a shame that some of these other matches couldn't be more like this one. The next match was Kronus vs. Axl wrotten in a bed of barbed wire and nails match. The match was too short and too many screwups in this match. The only highlight in this match is when Kronus suplexes Axl Rotten threw a bed of barbed whire for the win. I was expecting alot more in this match between two hardcore stars but things arn't always what they're suppost to be. The next match is for the XPW titel as ""The Real Deal"" Damien Steel defends the belt against Christ Candido in a falls counts anywhere match. This match could have been real good but both of these guys just can't work well together. The only good thing about the match is when Shane Dougles comes out and shoots all over WCW and tells XPW that you now have yourselfs a ""Franchise"". The next match is the final match in the tournament between Supreme and Kronus in a barbed wire ropes and beds of glass,nails,lightbulbs,thumbtacks,barbed wire and barbed wire tables match. A cool thing about this match is Slayer's lead guitar player Kerry King is the special guest ring announcer of this match. This match was just boring. All it shows is Kronus throwing supreme in all the beds. And then out of nowhere, supreme bodyslams Kronus and then gets on top of the latter and wrapped in barbed wire, he splashes on him for the win. Also another dissapointing match. They then show a part when Lizzy Borden and Kronus strip Kristy Myst in front of everyone. It was cool but not enough skin. Then they show a steel cage match between The Messiah and ""White Trash"" Jonny Web. This match is also another reason to own this video. Theres this cool part where Web hits the Messiah off of the top of the cage and he lands on the table. These are two of XPW's best and I think the fans won't be dissapoint with this match. Then they show a bonus three way match between Kid Kaos, Phinominal Phil, and Mike Modest. For non hardcore fans, this is an amazing fast paced high flying match. Ofcourse they throw in some hardcore elements into this match but it gells well with the wrestling. These three wrestlers work there asses off in this match and pute on great performances. I think ECW fans would love this match.
All and all, ""Baptized in Blood"" could be better. but it could be worse. if you want to see how XPW started, then you should purchase ""Hardcore Conception"" (their first video release) and ""The Revolution Will Be Telivised"" (which is the first two episodes fromt here telivision show). But if you want their best release, get ""Go Funk Yourself"". It has some great matches  like Sabu vs. Terry Funk for the XPW title and both wrestlers destroy everything in their paths. The King of The Deathmatch battle between Supreme and The Messiah which any hardcore fan would love this match. There's also a really good three way match between Kronus, Homeless Jimmy, and ""White Trash"" Jonny Web. plus a six man brawl with Kronic, Big Rot, and Carlito Montana vs. Halloween, Damien 666, and Rey Misterio Sr. And Kid Kaos competes in two matches. first against Steven Razzono. then against Tracey Smothers.",984960000,6,4963,4.429978118161926
1629395,3,B00005N8AO,This tape is full of hardcore gimmick matches in a death match tournament. But be warned this tape is a indy tape so don't expect too much out of it because these guys are rookies and make alot of mistakes and don't sell the action very well. (ex. when john kronus tries too cut Supreme with a piece of glass you can see supreme take a razor blade and knick himself with it too bleed while his hand is in front of the glass.) But the tape does show some wrestlers taking some hard bumps (wrestling lingo for hard falls and hits) so in conclusion this tape is worth the price if your a fan of indy wrestling or must see every hardcore match in the world.,984528000,,653,4.149606299212598
7946439,2,B00005N8AO,2 stars for the blood and gore factor. 0 stars for the actual wrestling quality. True garbage fans will love it!,1425513600,,112,4.380952380952381
7946440,4,B00005N8AO,"For those who've never seen it, XPW was an indie league out of Southern California(originally) that mimicked the bloody style of ECW and took it a notch further in grotesque extremness.

In this disc, the main draw is the KING OF THE DEATHMATCH tournament. All matches feature some form of 'barbed wire', 'broken glass', 'bed of nails', 'thumbtacks', etc.

Some well known faces in this disc include Shane 'Franchise' Douglas, Chris Candido, Tammy Lynn Sytch, and ECW vet Axel Rotten.

The main draw is held at some old theatre place in Hollywood. There's a bonus cage match that is held at the L.A. Sports Arena.

Announcers include a guy with an accent claiming to be related to Victor Rivera and a Joey Styles wannabe with an annoying scream.",1334966400,,745,4.796875
7946441,2,B00005N8AO,"XPW a word that hardcore wrestling fans may have heard of. Those who have usually are split down the middle 50/50. Some like it and some don't. A lot of the ones who don't, do not like because they feel as its a bad rip off of ECW or they just don't like that style of wrestling(Hardcore). Now, I don't know too much about the company. I mean I heard about it before and whatnot but never really watched a bunch of their stuff. I did get a VHS tape of some event back in high school from some kid but I don't really remember anything special about it, but I recently was at a used DVD store and found this DVD for $3.99 so, I thought why not and picked it up.

The first thing I find with this DVD is their announcers are just plain horrible. One guy sounds like somebody doing a bad impression of Scarface's Tony Montana and the other sounds like someone trying to be Joey Styles except replace Joey Style's famous OH MY GOD!!!! with what sounds like a women yelling in a bad horror film when ever something hardcore happens. Also during in ring segments, the camera man and production are bad. During the first segment Chris Candido was in the ring with Sunny, and some other guy was talking well while he was talking they didn't show him at all until pretty much the end of him talking they kept showing Candido and the crowd.

As for the action, it is what you would expect out of a hardcore wrestling company. It has the King of the Deathmatch tournament, blood, all kinds of weapons(such a barbed wire, nails, glass, thumbtacks, and light bulbs) and did I mention blood? It isn't the greatest DVD I ever seen and it from what I can remember it was better then a lot of other ECW knockoffs, but it is nowhere near as good as ECW was. I will say the matches are pretty good and they do entertain. So if you are a fan of hardcore wrestling you might want to pick this up, but do remember what I said it is no ECW even though it does feature a few former ECW Superstars. The DVD does have a few bonus matches so that's a plus. I give this DVD 2.5 stars out of 5

Oh and before I forget some guy in one of the matches keeps vomiting throughout the match. I am not kidding, sadly.

7946442,3,B00005N8AO,"XPW is along the same lines of ECW. This particular event is very extreme and is not wrestling at all. All matches are from the February 26, 2000 Baptized In Blood card.

Kid Kaos, Supreme, Johnny Webb, Messiah, Kronus, Carlito Montana, Axl Rotten and Homeless Jimmy compete in an 8 man tournament to crown the first ever XPW King Of The Death Champion. There's Barbed Wire, Nails, Thumbtacks, Broken Glass, Light Bulbs and more.

7946443,3,B00005N8AO,"KEY:

91 - 100 - Perfect. A flawless PPV, you must buy this. Without a doubt this belongs in everyone's wrestling collection.

81 - 90 - Superb. An outstanding PPV, I highly recommend that you buy this.

71 - 80 - Great. A first-rate PPV, certainly worth your money.

61 - 70 - Good. A satisfying PPV. Perhaps buy this if you really feel you want it.

51 - 60 - Fair. An average PPV. It is worth a look, not your money.

41 - 50 - Mediocre. A dull PPV. - Perhaps take a look at this if you get a chance, I don't recommend it though.

31 - 40 - Poor. An unsatisfactory PPV - Maybe for hardcore wrestling fans, not for anyone else.

21 - 30 - Bad. A lousy PPV - This is not worth a look from anyone.

11 - 20 - Terrible. An awful PPV - Stay away from this and make sure you never see it.

1 - 10 - Abysmal. An appalling PPV - This is just a waste of time.

BAPTIZED IN BLOOD 1:

Beds of Barbed Wire and Nails

Supreme vs. Kid Kaos - 9/10

A fantastic deathmatch. Loads of high flying moves from kid kaos and a very hardcore match.

Barbed Wire Ladder and Thumbtacks

Johnny Webb vs. The Messiah - 8/10

Another great deathmatch. There are some sick moves done onto the thumbtacks.

Beds of Barbed Wire and Light Bulbs

Kronus vs. Carlito Montana - 7.5/10

A very short match. It features Carlito been thrown onto light bulbs with no shirt on. Very graphic as his back is cut up from the glass.

Barbed Wire Bat, Bed of Nails and Glass

Axl Rotten vs. Homeless Jimmy - 8/10

Homeless Jimmy never fails to impress. A very good deathmatch, when Jimmy is involved it is very hardcore and this match is no exception.

Chronic vs. Jay N - 5/10

A boring match and the table spot is messed up. Fast forward this one.

Beds of Barbed Wire, Thumbtacks and Nails Beds of Barbed Wire, Light Bulbs and Glass

Supreme vs. Messiah - 7/10

Not one of the greatest deathmatches on the tape. It's hardcore but it is over very quick.

Beds of Barbed Wire, Thumbtacks and Nails Beds of Barbed Wire, Light Bulbs and Glass

Kronus vs. Axl Rotten - 5.5/10

The worst deathmatch on the tape. VERY short and not very hardcore at all.

Damien Steele vs. Chris Candido - 6/10

An average non-deathmatch when it comes to XPW. The match would have been better if they didn't spend most of it in the crowd.

No Ropes, Barbed Wire, Beds of Everything

Supreme vs. Kronus - 6.5/10

I expected more from the final but you have to remember that these guys have been through two deathmatches already. It does feature one sick spot where supreme's leg gets caught up in the barbed wire. This match also has a crappy ending.

SCORE:  62.5/90 (69/100)

According to the key, I have rated Baptized in blood as `Good', a satisfying PPV and perhaps buy this if you really feel you want it. I agree with this. While some matches let the PPV down, the first few deathmatches are amazing and are nearly worth the dvd alone.",1119398400,2,2878,4.2110091743119265
7946444,1,B00005N8AO,"I could sit here and review the terrible matches on this DVD, and explain in great detail why each one is worse than the other, but I'm not going to. If your biggest ""superstar"" is The Messiah (who I respect personally, but don't care for as a wrestler) then I think it's time to make a huge change in your direction.
Imediately, the commentary alone almost makes this promotion unwatchable. You have your average color-commentator who sounds as if he's having a heart-attck throughout the DVD's duration, and the straight guy happens to have the thickest Mexican accent ever. How can you hire a guy to talk wrestling for two hours when he can't even speak English!?
Second, the audio is fake. All I can think of is that the crowd in attendance is so bored that canned tracks had to be mixed on top to seem as if they're actually getting into it.
Come on guys, there's more to wrestling than barbed wire, light bulbs, and thumbtacks. As for fans interested in this DVD, turn away now! The only good thing about it are the decent extras, which include histories and a bonus cage match.",1080345600,3,1084,4.535714285714286
7946445,2,B00005N8AO,"I have only seen this tape, bap in blood 2, and ... in regards to xpw.  All of them have been ok, but nothing special.  A lot of XPW cards seem good on paper but do not translate well into shows, and this is no different.  Axl Rotten, John Kronus, and Chris Candido all look awful in this video even though they are big names in wrestling (come on guys, take pride in your work!).  The stars of the video are Supreme (who takes vicious punishment), Messiah (who wrestles a terrific match with Supreme), and Kid Kaos (who, even though it is a death match tourney, still impresses with his insane high flying moves).  Every match that is not part of the actual tourney is, to be put nicely, aweful.  This tape gets 2 stars as it has 3 decent matches.",1030838400,,748,4.2695035460992905
7946446,5,B00005N8AO,"It may not be ECW, but it certainly is as close as you'll ever get. It's definatly better than anything you'll see on monday night or even a pay per view nowadays. These guys risk their lives in a brutal tournament. This video does have a couple down spots though, the Chronic vs. Jay N match was lame, but it did mark a debut of an ECW star, and the Candido vs. Damian Steele macth was also pretty lame, but what happened after was awesome. The announcing isn't very good, but it's better than anything you'll hear from the WWF. Also, the Extra Matches were cool too. Kid Kaos vs. Mike Modest vs. Phenomial Phil and White Trash Johnny Webb vs. Messiah Cage Match were both above average matches. This video will go down in wrestling history and is a must have for any wrestling fan, it's so extreme and hardcore you'll wonder how they guys are still walking to this day.",1012780800,,871,4.382716049382716

I'm a big ECW/FMW fan, and was expecting (perhaps wishing a bit much, but still...) to at least get an entertaining hardcore wrestling experience, but to my disappointment I got a disc full of amateurs doing stupid stunts with little to no skill, regard for themselves, or their opponents. Sure, hardcore wrestling is supposed to be crazy, but this is just plain sloppy. The only entertaining moments were from the VERY latino announcer ""Larry"" and the brief shoots by Chris Candido and Shane Douglas, the latter of which was the only moment where you could actually tell the audience was enjoying the show. Quite frankly just skip over this DVD on your way to the ECW DVDs, because, just like I am right now, you'll be kicking yourself later for having wasted money on such garbage.",1008028800,7,825,4.657534246575342
