8204800,4,B000S8CLRY,"This is an entertaining thriller about revenge. The violence has been toned down. This is a thriller starring people of color and that makes it different than most. The soundtrack is good. The actors are pretty and their reactions to the killings are realistic. The language, the hip hop music, rap and dance scenes give the film a hip hop sensibility. The film definitely has an urban vibe. This film is recommended for people who enjoy revenge films but want to see one starring African Americans with a strong, female heroine.",1477094400,,529,4.824175824175824

8204804,1,B000S8CLRY,"This is such a bad movie. Most of it seem to be in slow motion. The actors lack emotions There was no fear from these teenagers that are noticing their friends getting killed. The ""missy"" girl act like she wasn't scared to death..come on, beating up a man with his height and size!! Bomb movie, bomb acting, bomb waste of money.",1316822400,,328,4.39344262295082
8204805,2,B000S8CLRY,"What is their about this slasher flick that makes it different from any other? Other than changing the race of the major players...nothing. So this movie did not stand out. The urban angle , as opposed to some dumb kids lost in the woods or venturing into one of those ""lets go look in this building"" places, is still the abnormal for this genre. The story is old. The acting was good, not great. I do not think the race changing will reach any new audience. The special effects could have been a little better. The fight for life scene between Deago and the killer could have been drawn out a little more. Deago was the main a-hole of the April Fools bunch, so his death should have been prolonged and special.  Actually, all of the fight-for-life scenes could have been drawn out a little more. The score was terrible during most of the movie. Being so terrible, it made me realize how important the right music at the right time really is. That being said,it was just okay for a B-slasher flick. The only difference is the victims had sould and attitude. Not worthless, but not worth going out of the way for either. Just good.",1244937600,,1130,4.458937198067633
8204806,2,B000S8CLRY,Ok I love the actors from other movies that they have played in. But this movie I did not like them in this movie it was to ghetto.,1219363200,2,131,3.7142857142857144
8204807,1,B000S8CLRY,"Ok, first off, I am all for supporting black made movies but this one, come on now!! It comes across as though a bunch of friends got together and said ""Hey, let's make a horror movie!""...LOL...I'm convinced this was shot in one day, bypassing the editing phase.",1195516800,5,262,4.595744680851064
8204808,1,B000S8CLRY,"Let me begin by saying that I worked on this movie for three days. The script had a water mark ""Final Draft 7 Demo"" insignia on it, not a good start. This movie offends me it's so bad. There's about 15 minutes worth of footage that advances the story with about 50 minutes of rap songs, free styling, jirating of the gludius maximus, and horrible, horrible acting. I know how the horror film genre is supposed to work, it's supposed to be fun, fast, and exciting. You know that show ""Mystery Science Theater 3000""? They could win Emmy upon Emmy if they watched  this pile of crap. I'll put you this, here's an ACTUAL line from the movie. ""I am sorry your friends are dying!"". Are you serious?

If you buy this movie, make sure you have a lot of guange on you, it's fun to watch like that, but as an actual movie, a lot of good film was wasted.",1192406400,9,843,4.229813664596273
8204809,1,B000S8CLRY,"Oh, this is bad. It's nothing more than a very low budget, bad acting, no suspense, snooze fest. It also rips off ""I know What You Did Last Summer.""",1191974400,6,148,4.137931034482759
