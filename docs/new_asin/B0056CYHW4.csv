4587940,4,B0056CYHW4,"Four More Years is the lighthearted and charming story of a forty-something Swedish politician named David, the leader of a political party, whose wife Fia is his chief aide and adviser.

In the aftermath of a disastrous election, which instead of making him Prime Minister as expected loses his party almost all its influence in parliament, David falls in love with Martin, a younger, openly gay leader of the opposition party that trounced David's in the election. (The movie was directed by the actress who plays Fia.) There follows an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adam-s-Rib/dp/B001J1S4GQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adam's Rib</a>&nbsp;sort of dilemma, with lovers on opposite sides of a professional matter of great importance to both - in addition to David's anxiety over coming out as gay.

Americans and other Anglophones may have a hard time believing politicians of opposing parties ANYWHERE can treat each other with unfailing mild-mannered courtesy, but it may well be true that Swedish politicians actually are civilized human beings, unlike the snarling savages who dominate American politics.

And gay American men may not recognize the intensity of the passion between David and Martin. I think the two guys are very sexy, both individually and together, but viewers conditioned by the hairless twenty-something gym bunnies and feral copulation that distinguish American gay movies will find these two men unattractive.

Anybody looking for fireworks - either political or sexual - will be disappointed in this movie; but as a look at how civilized, mature (but not old) gay men with serious interests outside of themselves might behave, Four More Years is a revelation and a welcome breath of fresh air in the world of gay movies.

All the performances are good, the dialog is intelligent, the story is not as predictable as it could be, and there are some very entertaining supporting characters - particularly David's mother and Martin's father. I enjoyed the movie enough to watch it again right now.",1390608000,3,2066,5.484276729559748
4587941,4,B0056CYHW4,"Entertaining political satire with a distinctive Swedish flavor.  A high-ranking and popular 40-something politician takes a shot at the country's premiership, but is undercut in national elections by the poor performance of an allied party.  He's out politically and somehow liberated personally.  That sense of liberty leads an unexpected attraction to another man--who happens to be a political enemy and openly gay.  The budding new romance and subsequent coming out have predictable zig-zags as the newly out pol finds himself with a lot to reconcile.

This is a story told with deft humor and honesty.  The principal actors are believable in their physical ordinariness and humanity.  They behave first and foremost like politicians (or so it seems to this denizen of Washington DC) and this makes their personal lives all the more complicated and amusing.",1385078400,3,862,5.340740740740741

4587944,4,B0056CYHW4,"Finally a delightful movie about grown men coming to terms with themselves and with love and which ends on a wonderful note!  So many movies are about teens to young adults and it was good to see a movie where the two main characters are adult men!  Wonderful movie, delightful, recommended!",1362873600,4,291,4.686274509803922
4587945,5,B0056CYHW4,"This is simply a fantastic  film, sort of a `Thick of It'' in Sweden but with a gay love story thrown in. It is all about next Prime Minister to be David Holst (Bjorn Kjellmann). He is happily married to his job as Party Chairman of the Liberal Democrats, brought up as a Baptist he was taught to believe that most fun things were wrong, causing him to indulge in a life of denial including punitive masturbation (that is think of someone ugly while you're doing it). After his election goes south he has to rebuild the party from the ground up and starts to look at things a bit differently.

Then he runs into the stalking horse of the Socialists Martin, and as such sworn enemies of all things `right' ,(in the political sense that is), but there appears to be a frison between the cut back king of the right and the spend advocate of the left. David is also married to his personal assistant who has more good one liners than an average stand up, so often steals the show. He also has to deal with his ageing parents, inability to write speeches, bad pronunciation and his ratings free fall in the polls. Meanwhile Martin (Eric Ericson) starts to have feelings of a non political nature for his alleged nemesis.

So with bags more characters and humour thrown in, this is just one of those films that had me laughing for more than average in a film. It is all well acted and the comedy timing is perfect, but at the same time it has pathos and the emotions of all concerned are dealt with in a mature and grown up way, which is often missing from `rom coms'.

Special mention has to go to Tova Magnusson- Norling, who directed this and plays David's wife, Fia, she is just superb but plays it just right to leave the lime light for the two main characters, this is also a gay film that avoids the bedroom squelch as it would be superfluous, so if that is your thing, then give this one a miss. But if you want something original, funny. Sweet in a good way and ruddy entertaining then this is a must see, so long as you don't mind the sub titles or can actually speak Swedish - absolutely recommended.",1348704000,11,2105,4.33502538071066
4587946,5,B0056CYHW4,".......title of this Great little Swedish film (actually released as:  ""Four More Years"")

(( WARNING......WARNING...Do you get that I have discovered the ""World of Region 2 DVDs and All-Regions Players""?  Yes, there are so many of these little DVD gems out there, just waiting to be found----and which US releasing companies have not been smart enough to pick up.  BUT, here again, let me remind that the ONLY way I know you Gay, fun-loving types out there are going to be able to view a purchased copy of this Region 2 (only) DVD is if you already have....or obtain an All-Regions player ))

((  RATING ADVISORY XXXX RATING ADVISORY:  NC-90 / 18----No one under Age 90 is allowed NOT to see this movie  ))

(( AND...did you know that wearing the wrong shoe size can lead to meeting (running into, actually) the Love of Your Life? ))

A CAST OF CHARACTERS (by order of importance, naturally):

- David Holst (Our Guy) - (played by:  Bjrn Kjellman) ---- He's our Starched & Proper Male Lead, a Swedish Liberal Party big-wig, who is now attempting to gain a position within his party which could lead to him ousting the current Opposition Party Prime Minister.  Oh, yes, he thinks he has things under control (but does he?).  Already married for 12 years to a strong, strong woman who manages his career, Our David is, in reality, a ""Lost Liberal"" adrift in a marriage of convenience.  More to the point, he is, EMOTIONALLY, this wee, shivery lamb of a guy who we just wanna reach out for and enfold to our chests.  Anyway, Readers, maybe his situation is not quite so bad as all that.  He is, at least, nice looking....pleasant in temperment....and usually in control---when not being yelled at.  (Oh, and he wears great neckties).  YET...yet, what he really, REALLY needs is simply to meet ""That Person"" who can show him what he has been missing for about 40 years of his life.....and then introduce him to WHO he really is.  (An Aside for your viewing pleasure:  I don't think ""That Person"" is too far off right about now).

- Martin Kovac - (played by:  Eric Ericson...how original) ---- Good Golly....he's here already:  ""That Person"" I just mentioned to you.  And in the very pleasing form of our Male Co-Lead.....who is Hunky...who is Charming...and who is (Yikes!) ""OUT"".  Oh, my, oh my.  BUT, even worse for Our Guy, is that Martin is (Gulp) an Up-and-Comer in the Opposition Party....you know, the one David is trying to defeat.  Nevertheless...Martin's Cool...he's Fun...he's Smooth, and oh so easy to be with.  Always sunny-tempered and as steadfast as the Rock of Gibraltar.  Gosh, yes, you'll definitely fall in love with Martin because, well, he's just the kinda guy everybody gravitates to.  An even better way to describe him is that HE is the Shepherd to David's Little Lost Lamb.  (( Leaving Martin for now, just let me say that, out of them all, this is the Guy I really, REALLY fell for.  You wait and see for yourselves....he makes it so easy to do ))

- Fia Holst - (played by:  Tova Magnusson...our Director, herself---Who must be a Bi-Something or other) ---- This character is a ""Man of Steel"" (oops....I mean ""Woman of ....."").  And sometimes she's a little Bitchy (well, if you were in this kind of marriage, wouldn't you be?).  This is a no-holds-barred Gal who, despite some surface gruffness, will come to recognize and accept what is in her best interests and those of her (Our) man.  Actually, toward film's end, you will definitely see her getting exactly what is coming to her...what she deserves (I know, this may sound ""harsh""....but you'll probably be laughing your heads off anyway).  (( Leaving Pia for now, just let me say that, look closely....and you'll find she is working on a little Surprise of her own )).

- Mamma Holst - (played by:  Inger Heyman) ---- A hard-as-nails Roofer (er...I mean Mother) who often calls her son, David, whatever-the-Swedish-word-for-Schmuck is.  She pulls no punches when it comes to telling him what he SHOULD HAVE done.  This is, for sure, a Mother who is definitely less easy on the eye...and the ego...than the Mother in my recent review of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/He-Is-My-Girl-La-folle-histoire-d-amour-de-Simon-Eskenazy-He-s-My-Girl-Ma-mec--moi-O-trelos-erotas-tou-Simon-Eskenazy-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-2-Import-United-Kingdom/dp/B004RZXIM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">He Is My Girl ( La folle histoire d'amour de Simon Eskenazy (He's My Girl) ) ( Ma mec  moi (O trelos erotas tou Simon Eskenazy) ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - United Kingdom </a>]"".

- Barbro..""The Shocker"" - (played by:  Lisbeth Johansson) ---- Kudos by the Dozen to whoever was smart enough to put into the script, this priceless character and the words that come out of her mouth.  In a scene shot at dawn, she is on her knees, peeking into and knocking on a small, ground level bedroom window....trying to grab the attention of our rudely awakened David....as he's attempting to keep her from seeing ""That Person"" in the bed he has just jumped from.  Folks, this is an Hilarious...Almost-Caught-Red-Handed scene.....You'll be falling off your seats laughing.

GENERAL THOUGHTS....PLUS SOME THINGS THIS FILM CAN TEACH YOU:

- And these 2 Hot Swedes are one of the cutest couples you'll ever run into (there's nothing Cold about Sweden)

- And be wary of elevators....just one short ride together in one...and a person can become Smitten

- And Oh, Wow!....When your eyes meet across a crowded room....

- And what do you do when he's innocently standing there...spouting political parables?  Why, you lean into...and kiss him, of course. (Yummy)

- And if you've recently fallen out of love....these 2 Guys will take you right back into it.  What a Treasure!

- And this is a movie where you really get to find out what a guy might do to a Horny Baptist.  So, like it or not....Take that!

- And when asking your Lover how many ""Others"" BEFORE you....ask only for a Ballpark Figure (saves Heartache)

- And have you EVER heard of ""Punitive Wanking""? (Just think about it....Mustn't you punish yourself for having Impure Thoughts?)

- And you'll never believe the funny-weirdness of a minutes long ""On-line Dating"" montage (Don't tell me YOU'VE been there!)

- And when you've caused a ""Someone"" to walk away.....That's when your heart feels Torn Out.  Absolutely Wrenched from your chest!

- And, oh yes, there are Sad Moments....Misunderstanding Moments (BUT....don't you Folks out there dare give up on this)

- And now for a Final AND -- Bright RED...is the very best Color for these 2 Lovely Guys.  Trust me...in the end, it is the color which will Warm Your Hearts!

TWO FINAL NOTES:

- The DVD Extras has ""Behind The Scenes"" shots which are not captioned.....NEVERTHELESS, you can easily tell these 2 Leads are having a ball with one another between shots.  Makes for a Good and Fun Production, doesn't it?

- (You'll never have guessed):  I've fallen in love with this movie.....Well, these 2 Guys, actually....David & Martin.  Indeed, it's hard not to go back and revisit them every few days.

8459420,4,B0056CYHW4,Liked the plot of the film. At times I didn't quite get the dialogue's political references due to my not living in that country. Enjoyed it enough to watch it twice.,1502582400,,166,4.387096774193548
8459421,5,B0056CYHW4,"Delightful! and watching it a second time around it is even funnier, and more sophisticated with plenty of smart, cynical, witty and realistic exchanges between those two men who are (seemingly) on different spectrums of political views. Just goes to prove that most of us do not chose our own way, but pretty much being influenced and doctrines  by our parents and family beliefs, socially and politically.  One man still struggles with his genuine nature, the other celebrates it. they go thru all the emotions two people who suddenly and passionately fall in love and are in a difficult situation go thru. I really wish that American politicians would display even a third  to half the sophistication and maturity those two European men posses...But I can dream on...Anyway - the movie is funny, natural, heartwarming, and executed to perfection by all actors.  You will fall in Love with them (especially David), and the people around them. Highly recommended for a mature (emotionally) audience who finds two smart and very human men very sexy...",1498348800,,1051,5.057803468208093
