340928,5,6301640780,"My mother was the one who suggested this movie.  She had seen it as a little girl, and kept telling me about Marcelino.  After months of looking, I found it here.  We watched the movie three times that day.  The movie is definitely a five star, with humor, religion and about the little boy who talked with Jesus. Marcelino and the brothers make this an enjoyable movie to watch.  I have only one question, was the movie based on a true story?",990662400,17,443,4.353658536585366
340929,5,6301640780,"Now a days when movies are so preoccupied with costumes and special effects, it's nice to sit down and watch a movie with a great story.  You have to keep in mind that this movie is from the 1950's, the director wanted it to feel as realistic as possible in using only lighting effects to create moods and ambiances.  The realistic scenes seemed to enhace the mystical part of the movie.  The religious tone is presented in a fun and amusing way, just imagine 12 friars raising a little boy and dealing with his mischief only to find out what a iracle child he is.  It'a a great story for children cause it reinforces certain values and creates a mystical outcome, something amazing that happened to a bot maybe their age.",973814400,17,722,4.488549618320611
340930,5,6301640780,There is no question that this film is one of the all time greats.  I remember seeing this movie as a child and it has remained in my thoughts  for over forty years.  The film overwhelmingly moving and will inspire  many.,966297600,8,221,4.317073170731708

I have never forgotten this film.
Let me emphasize broadly how wonderful this story is, without revealing critical details, climax and ending.
I saw this as a little girl. My entire  grammar school viewed it together in the auditorium, and its shocking  poignancy remained memorable for decades. (I'll thank the availability of  home videos, for allowing me to see this film again, now).
The catalyst  for the intense drama that follows is this scene: One exasperated monk,  trying to instill discipline in a beloved orphan boy, conjures up a rule.  He exclaims, ""You must NEVER climb this stairway!"" to the  attic.
The monk, Brother Francisco, is the dominant parent-figure, among  the twelve Italian Franciscan monks, in an Hispanic land, who have adopted  the youngster, Marcelino, at infancy.
Marcelino, being a child, curious,  mischievous, climbs the stairs. In the attic, what he finds there, how he  responds, ultimately forces the humble, bewildered monks to confront the  mystical center, of their faith.
In many ways, this film subtly emanates  the very spirit of St. Francis of Assisi. It's as if I am glimpsing what  Francis must have been like as a joyous child, and as a soul, early in  life, opening to Love. The aptly named Brother Francisco eagerly embraces  the abandoned infant, nurtures him, as Francis would do, for the varied  creatures of nature. The film's Brother Francisco is, fittingly, the first  to witness an extraordinary occurrence in which Marcelino is  involved.
Even if you are not Christian, the purity, generosity,  exuberance, of this boy, might touch you. His deep-felt yearning to have a  mother, to know his own mother, stirs my heart. It might be wise for adults  to be on hand, if children watch this film. Some aspects could be  misinterpreted, promoting unnecessary fear of loss, or even, of God.
In  the story the monks at dinner read from The Little Flowers, an anthology of  St. Francis anecdotes. You might check that work, as a complement to the  film, as well as a small, moving book, on the prayer by St. Francis,  written by Kent Nerburn, entitled, Make Me An Instrument Of Your Peace.
A  beautiful film.",958694400,218,2185,4.961325966850829
340932,5,6301640780,"If you are one who is seldom moved by emotions, this one will really melt your heart. These kind of movies are never ever seen nowadays. A must see for all families who want to know a little more about Jesus.",955238400,76,208,4.097560975609756
340933,5,6301640780,"This movie is great.  I won't get into it.  The other reviews of it, did it justice.  Take the time to read what everyone else wrote.  That is also how I feel.  I was shedding tears at the end.",949536000,8,193,3.8461538461538463
340934,5,6301640780,"If film makers today wanted to produce a film like this they would have to remove every cynical brain cell in their body and regain their innocence. I wonder if they even could.
This is a very strange film, jumpy, old,  scratched print, dubbed, monochrome, frames missing and therefore sometimes  parts of sentences are missing (though fortunately not enough to worry  about.)yet for all this it is still a gem. I showed it to my wife who  instantly declared it the best film she had ever seen.

341058,5,6301640780,"I have seen this film three times in the past few years. There are two versions -- this is the better, but the other is very good too. Anyway, I recommend it for devout Roman Catholics especially. But if you like films about orphans who struggle and surmount their trials with the help of a fraternity of kind, earnest, devout men, with a sublime ending, then this is for you. If you are a good Christian this will make you a great one. If you have already made Jesus the center of your life and been born again, this will movie will inspire you to sainthood! Yes, there is a miracle at the end, and it WILL move you, (unless you are a Pharisee with a hard heart.)

I still love the adorable lovable little scamp of a boy actor playing the precioso orphan who can't stay out of trouble - he gave me a lump in my throat during both viewings. My mother, by the way, a tremendous movie lover, did NOT like this movie at all but I couldn't understand why until I saw it as a grown-up. Not sure who the intended audience was meant to be.

341197,4,6301640780,"Here's a lovely little film about faith that also appeals to this decidedly agnostic reviewer. Why? Because of its striking B&W cinematography & its simplicity, which makes it feel like a centuries-old folk tale that's become an integral part of the local community culture. The little boy who plays Marcellino gives a pure, unaffected performance that's utterly natural. The monks have individual personalities & come across as very human, without any loss of their devotion. When you recall how overblown many religious films of the 1940s & 1950s were, the gentleness of this modest film is all the more moving for its understated quality. Yes, there's certainly much to discuss about the uses & abuses of organized religion -- but that discussion has no place here, because this film is meant to be a plain depiction of belief that's also a small work of art. A thoughtful viewer doesn't have to share that belief to appreciate the quiet beauty of the film. The ending may trouble some, but within the context of the film, it's an honest view of how this faith regards life & death. Recommended!",1452211200,6,1098,4.877005347593583

341263,5,6301640780,"This is a beautiful story about an orphan boy, adopted by a monastery.  His life is comfortable, loving and well nourished as far as a monastery of austere aging  monks can provide.  He lacks the companionship and play pals normal that a boy his age might expect.  But most of all, he lacks mother love.  The monks are aware that he needs an emotional fulfillment which they cannot provide.  He finds the individual love he needs in a miracle.  This is very Catholic, yet it is not as ""religious"" as you might think. Even if you are not particularly religious you will love this story because it is about the very human search for love:  a child's search for the love he needs, and others' attempts to find it for him, culminating in a miracle.

There is a remake made in the 90's VCI entertainment also has that version, but it is simply lousy.  The 1955 version is story pared down to the absolute essentials of the search for love.

If you ever experienced doubt in your life regarding faith, this film will not only bring tears to your eyes in the very first hour but it will replace that doubt with faith that never truly left you to begin with.  At one point a very long time ago when Spain was attacked by the French, twelve monks seeked permission from the Spanish government to rebuild their monastary.  Their request was granted and soon everything was back to normal or so they thought for in the middle of the night, they were awakened by a baby's cry right on their front doorstep.  It was an infant boy and their choice was made the minute they saw his face.  They named him Marcelino and raised him as one of their own with no regrets.  Of course they never realized beforehand when Marcelino turned five-years old, he would someday become a handful.  At first the monks thought the boy's practical jokes were funny but when he caused a ruckus in the village costing them money they didn't have, he had to be punished.  He was told, ""do not go up the attic stairs, there is a big man up there and you cannot disturb him"".  Not listening, Marcelino went slowly up the stairs, opened the door and saw a very large cross with a man on it.  He ran downstairs, slipped into the kitchen taking bread and wine and ran back up.  He pulled the table up to the cross, stood up and offered the man the food.  It was at that moment, Marcelino made a friend and a long over-due wish was granted.  People from all over visited the monastary once a year and their faith was restored forever!  .....this is a must see!......the film itself is outdated but the film will have you in tears....keep the kleenex handy!....thank you",1425254400,10,1868,4.371014492753623

The love and dedication of the monks, the mostly good nature of the town's people, the innocent and trusting faith of young Marcelino.  Do not read a critical review of this film that reveals why this boy has such innocent trust.  This is revealed in the story -- and how it is Marcelino's life that teaches the town and the monks what love and faith truly is.  The ending is sad, but you will weep with joy over what this sadness means.

341404,5,6301640780,"This is a classic, mid-1950's movie that came out with a whole score of other Catholic religion or Vatican/Rome themes. Some of them were ""Three Coins in the Fountain (1954), ""The Nun's Story "" (1958), ""When in Rome"" with Van Johnson and Paul Douglas (1953), ""The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima"", with Gilbert Roland (1954), ""Roman Holiday"" with Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn (1954), and lastly ""Rome Adventure"", with Suzanne Pleshette and Troy Donahue (1961).
I loved this movie for it's touching depiction of the innocence and love of a little child for his Mother who is deceased). It is also a story of Faith.
This movie (and all I mentioned) were made before the time of Vatican II in the Catholic Church, when all the beautiful religious traditions of the Catholic Church depicted and seen in so many of these movies was downplayed or overtly ridiculed and rejected.
These movies were of a time when the Catholic Church was strong and flourishing,  before there were all the terrible scandals of priest sexual abuse, radical dissident USA nuns, or Popes who spent their time traveling instead of working.  It was the time of Pope Pius XII, who many regarded as a true saint even in his lifetime, and still today.
If people like stories of the simple faith of monks raising a little boy who could touch the heart of God, then I suggest this classic video.
(As an aside, in 1955 Pius XII actually received the little boy who played Marcellino in private audience in the Vatican, blessed him and the movie.  The child actor's name was Pablito Calvo, who sadly died about 15 years ago at about 52. He was well known in his native Spain as a child actor.",1402272000,7,1656,4.645051194539249

She decided that she wanted to share the film with me and bought me a copy when she came across it again in a catalog many years later. I also love the film.

It's about a baby who is left in front of the gates of a Monastery that has been rebulit where 12 monks live. They adopt him. and for the first 5 years of his life young Marcelino grows up there. Without giving too much away if you have not seen the film, Marcelino is told never to go up this set of stairs because their is a big man up there that will take him away forever.
Eventually Marcelino cannot help himself and has to see what is up those stairs.
What he finds will change his life, the monks lifes and the lifes of the entire town forever more.

I have not received my copy yet, as I only ordered it a few days ago.
There were several films, or events during my childhood  that imprinted their image or memory, on my""psyche""

There have been some ""tricky"" times in my life, close to death from alcoholism, and cancer, and recently the traumor of a 47 yr. marriage coming to an end,NOT from the death of a spouse, somehow that would have been easier, but God ""writes a good script"" so i accept the circumstances, and trust in God s judgement.

Now back to this film and my attempt to review it !!
Somehow, receiving it is of secondary importance.
If you have already got to this page, you already know you are curious about the subject matter, I don t need to sell you the product.

I saw this film as 7yr. old, and as with other films or events, it is interesting, for me to know at what age I experienced them, and sometimes to be amazed at the interpretation, and level of understanding and emotion, that I experienced as a small child.

""desert island"" choice only one film... this one .
It has haunted me for a lifetime.
In those days no VHS. or DVD, no internet for reference, and a family to raise, left little time for research.

I am an alcoholic, and have a daily reprieve from that desperate illness.
Keeping close to my higher power is essential for  maintenance, and to enable a sustained recovery.

I promise I will get the 20 words about the ""product"" but if you beleive as I do,every word I write is testimony to the real meaning of this beautiful film.

I am not sure if this has reached 300 words, maybe it has.
If you are not bored, I will continue with the rest of my story, perhaps my ""editor"" or higher power will chose.

Love to all , and thanks (If you have )for reading this far.

341560,5,6301640780,"One of the finest movies ever made, Ladislao Vajda's THE MIRACLE OF MARCELINO (Spain, 1955) was always a compromised viewing experience, with all previous video releases taken from used 35mm source material, or murky foreign editions with poor subtitling.  All that is history now.  VCI's new release may indeed be ""restored,"" as the advertising boasts, but more importantly, it appears to be mastered from the original camera negative, or something close to it.  I've never seen the film looking as good as this in my entire life, and I first ran into MARCELINO on NY's ""Movie Four"" back in the early '60s.  Up to the standards of a Criterion release?  Almost...  VCI could have timed their transfer just a little better -- the exterior fair sequence is a tad more contrasty than it needs to be, for example, with some faces burned out -- but the dark and spooky scenes, the meat of the film for most, benefit from this full-illumination telecine approach, with every little precious detail in the attic clear as a bell.  In addition to the magnificent source material, VCI's package includes some new, faith-themed documentaries, trailers and a promo for the forgettable color remake.  A well-researched short about the 1955 movie itself would have been nice, and a film historian providing a commentary downright terrific (I would have done it for free).  But none of these missed opportunities detract from what is quite clearly a significant quality upgrade.  All in all, it's been a great couple of years for fans of classic black-and-white fantasy movie masterpieces.  I never expected to see the 1951 A CHRISTMAS CAROL scanned from its original negative; ditto an art house perennial like Cocteau's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  Yet there they are on glorious Blu-ray, digitally transferred from camera neg sources, looking a generation better than they would in any form of projected celluloid.  Wow...

Then I saw this film and I ultimately discovered my lifelong hero.
Viewing it made my faith in God tangible. I could see it, touch it, feel it within me.
An abandoned little baby boy is raised by clergymen in a monastery, where he is educated and as he grows into a small boy, his curiosity grows as well.
Despite being forbidden to climb the stairs all the way up and enter the attic, of course, Marcelino does exactly that...and here the story becomes miraculous and cause for jubilation.
Little Marcelino makes a new friend - a friend that is within the grasp of us all to love and cherish, if only we could once again see through the eyes and with the innocence of a child.

However, please proceed with caution it is a very sad movie and some of the content may be too much for the younger ones.  It is however a very underrated classic and should be viewed at least once for all of those who are deeply connected with their christian/catholic roots.
Parents should however watch it first and see if it would be appropriate for their younger children to see it first.  It deals with death, sacrifice, faith, and love for God.
Please see this movie with an open mind and enjoy the story about a young boy who is deeply devoted to God and has the heart of saint and wishes the best for all the world and everyone around him.  It is heartwarming and touching, but very sad.
Enjoy and tell me what you think.li",1244505600,3,899,4.359281437125748
341600,5,6301640780,"Wow, this was stunning, both in photography and in content. Here's a nice, old-fashioned ""religious story"" you rarely see anymore.

It's a simple tale of a group of monks who discover a baby at their monastery doorstep one morning and then raise the boy. They try to find suitable parents for the infant but are unsuccessful. The infant scenes don't run too long because, before you know it, they have fast-forwarded it to when the boy was six years of age....and that's where he stays until the end of the film.

Pablito Calvo as the title character, Marcelino,"" is excellent. Kudos to cinematographer Heinrich Gartner for beautiful black-and-white photography. The DVD transfer was very good, too. The lighting, particularly on faces, is terrific.

I found the story oddly captivating the entire way and very touching and moving in the last 20 minutes or so, after the boy discovers the big statue of Christ and supernatural things begin to happen.

The film depicts a series of religious apparition experiences that lead to an unexpected ending.

I saw it once and it stayed with me all these years until I finally found it on DVD and immediately bought it.  The story of young Marcelino who is found abandoned at the doorway to a monastery and taken in by the monks is very moving and beautifully filmed.  The first three-quarters of the film sets the scene in showing how much Marcelino is loved by the monks as they raise him, but yet he misses having a mother and constantly asks everyone about theirs and his.  Like all children, he eventually gets into a bit of mischief and strays into areas where he's told not to go.  There he meets a most loving friend....This film is so well done both in the way it is photographed and in telling a simple, loving story that it would be a shame not to see it.

341637,1,6301640780,"""Marcelino, Pan y Vino"" (1955) is a marvel. Simple but touching, beautifully acted and filmed, it captures that elusive mixture of logic and mystery at the heart of childhood. Ladislao Vajda's spare yet sensitive direction is mirrored by Pablo Sorozabal's masterful score, and by the child Pablito Calvo's marvellous portrayal in the title role.

This Spanish/Italian co-production came up fresh as paint in a recent Spanish-only release from Video Mercury Films (2002.) It gives me no pleasure to report that the 2004 Vanguard Latino issue - the only one currently available with English subtitles - is a travesty of the crisp original print. It claims to be ""digitally remastered"", but the Vanguard DVD is horribly bleached, blurred and blocky, with crumbly sound and laced with video artefacts. It is in fact well-nigh unwatchable. Presumably it was taken from a poor VHS copy, maybe of Mexican provenance (which might account for its attribution of the film to that country.)

The English subtitles are sparse and spiky - whilst the magical sung scene at the heart of the film is not subtitled at all! It's frustrating that the excellent Spanish issue has no subtitles, but anyone with even the barest smattering of Spanish should seek it out, rather than this appalling Vanguard Latino travesty, which defaces a cinematic masterpiece beyond repair.",1112832000,74,1353,5.17351598173516

He loved taking us to horror movies, this day was with a warewolf movie with the Miracle of Marcelino as the second featurn. Maybe because I was so firghtened by the first movie that I sat glued to the second. I was adoped at the age of six months, but didn't find this fact out until after I had seen this movie.  Let me say that I was that little boy who wanted to see his mother and would have given anything to have been in his place. It was the need to fill that empty place in my heart I had but didn't recognize at the time, but came to realize when I was finally told that I was adopted and that both of my birth parents were deceased. This turned out to be untrue, but here I am at the age of 60 and still realizing the depth of those emotions then and now.  My adoptive parent are no longer alive and my birth mother has forbidden any contact with her or her family even after she dies. I guess, what I saw in this little movie was a life truth, the need to complete ourselves, get in touch with our roots and to be nurtured if we weren't as a baby or small child.

The dramatic black and white photography of the rural areas of post WWII Spain was the most appealing aspect of the film to us.",1004918400,5,414,4.684931506849315
341676,5,6301640780,"There are many foreign films that captivated or inspired me,such as Roberto Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful"" and Federico Fellini's ""Nights of Cabiria"".  But I haven't seen a foreign film so beautiful or so spiritual than Lidislao Vajda's ""Miracle of Marcelino"" (Marcelino pan y vino).
  The Miracle of Marcelino is like a religious fairy tale that sends a message about hope and love.  The film begins as an allegory where a town Franciscan monk is sent to tell a story to a terminally ill little girl about a miracle that occured several years ago. The story is based on the narration from this faithful monk.
  After the Spanish civil war, twelve monks constructed their new monastary.  Once they finished and settled in their new home, they had an unexpected surprise. A baby boy was given to them to take care of, inspite of their heavy work load.  This boy, Marcelino, grows up to be a mischievous, but good hearted little five year old boy.
  Because of Marcelino's mischievousness and childhood innocence, the boy becomes a saint.  By watching this masterpiece,you realize the importance of faith and the value of being a child.  This film is definitely the best foreign film I've ever seen.  Never watch this film dubbed.  The quality is in the English subtitles with its original Spanish language.",1000425600,88,1304,4.894977168949771

7813359,5,6301640780,"I purchased this movie as a recommendation from a friend from Mexico. I was very excited to find it in its original language but with the option of English and with or with out subtitles. I have a terrible habit of reading them and analyzing the translation when they are on the screen. It is in black and white and has not been colored like some older movies are. This movie was very good and taught some very interesting lessons if you really pay attention, a little humor, and a little bit of a tear jerker. Overall money well spent.",1519862400,,536,4.37
