7673409,5,B01CDHXVAS,This opened my eyes to the potential of home schooling and gave some really helpful ideas regarding what it takes to have a successful experience.,1464307200,3,146,4.88
7673410,5,B01CDHXVAS,"Every parent, teacher and school administrator needs to see this documentary.  It is a definitely a must see if you feel you have no options when it comes to educating your children.",1463356800,3,182,4.6875
7673411,3,B01CDHXVAS,"This was a decent documentary, but I wish it had delved deeper into More of the other types of homeschooling. I personally fee
Like it focused more time on unschooling than anything else.",1462752000,5,187,4.696969696969697
7673412,5,B01CDHXVAS,An honest exploration of one family's journey.  It was interesting to see many options in homeschooling and how they actually played out in real life.,1460160000,2,150,5.0
7673413,5,B01CDHXVAS,"If you're exploring the option of homeschooling and can't see how it could work for your family, this film will clear the air, dispel the myths and stereotypes, and give you hope. You get to eavesdrop on a typical American family as they take the plunge into homeschooling -- fed up with the public schools' excessive homework and testing that suck the joy out of learning and put the kids AND the parents in a state of constant stress. You'll see them take back their power, try different homeschooling styles, and create a personalized approach that works for every member of their family. The results are truly inspiring!

If you've already decided to homeschool, you'll want to show ""Class Dismissed"" to your friends and extended family members who don't understand how homeschooling works and why, for many families, it's a better fit than standard schooling. Director Jeremy Stuart has gone out of his way to present homeschooling in a matter-of-fact way that's informative, not righteous. It doesn't push homeschooling as ""the one right way"" or try to make non-homeschoolers feel bad, so you won't be putting your friendships at risk when you share this movie with others.

Admittedly, I'm biased -- not only did I homeschool my own kids (and love it), but I'm also a parenting coach who advocates self-directed education, and I appear briefly in the film. Through my work, I frequently encounter parents who are interested in homeschooling but need help seeing what it would be like to leave conventional schooling behind and take their family's education into their own hands. Now I can simply recommend viewing ""Class Dismissed"" and they see how homeschooling empowers parents and students to learn on their own terms and, in the process, rediscover the joy of familyhood.

I highly recommend both the DVD and the streaming version of ""Class Dismissed.""",1457654400,5,1863,5.022653721682848
7673414,5,B01CDHXVAS,"A great film for everyone who is homeschooling, who is thinking of homeschooling, or who isn't but wants to know ""what's the deal with homeschooling?"". This film clears up so many misconceptions about homeschoolers, gives a great history of compulsory schooling, and shows some of the many different ways to homeschool your kids. It was interesting to see how the main family struggles to find their way for a while, but eventually found a style that worked for everyone.",1456876800,2,471,4.974683544303797
7673415,5,B01CDHXVAS,"Informative, interesting and eye-opening. This movie gave us the confidence to homeschool our daughter. I have recommended to all of my friends and am so grateful that this movie was made. There is nothing else like it that addresses this topic currently.",1456876800,3,255,5.095238095238095
7673416,5,B01CDHXVAS,This documentary came at the perfect time for my family and helped us feel more confident in our decision to homeschool. It's nice to see the different ways to homeschool and it's informative about the history of compulsory education. I definitely recommend everyone to see this. As parents it's important to be aware of our options!,1456790400,2,333,4.964285714285714
7673417,5,B01CDHXVAS,"Thank you for this important film!  It's an insight to homeschooling in the 21st century that demystifies who homeschoolers are and what they do all day.  Class Dismissed can help anyone who wants to learn more about this evergrowing educational alternative.

The movie follows one family as they pull their children from one of the best public schools in the area and choose to homeschool instead.  No spoilers here, but the family experiences a very typical transition as they move through the year.  For people who may be considering homeschooling, it's great to see what that looks like.

There are also informative interviews with homeschooling and unschooling veterans and other experts in the education field.  The film can be a great resource for concerned families and friends of homeschoolers -- it answers so many questions and debunks some deeply held preconceived notions about homeschooling (no, we're not homeschooling for religious reasons; no, we don't spend all day at the kitchen table doing school; yes, we have rich social lives, etc).

Great movie, great resource -- 5 stars!",1456790400,4,1097,5.15819209039548
7673418,5,B01CDHXVAS,Great film about school options.,1482710400,,32,5.6
7673419,5,B01CDHXVAS,"An excellent film about home schooling and de-schooling, very balanced, insightful, and fine production values.  Entertaining, even.",1481241600,2,132,6.764705882352941
7673420,5,B01CDHXVAS,"I thought this movie was going to be another critical analysis of public schools; however, after watching the whole film I realized that was not the case. I won't spoil anything, but the film (in my honest opinion) was a very real representation of families wanting different choices for their children's education. The film does focus primarily on one family, and their choice to pull their kids out of school. The journey through different means of ""educating"" their children is pretty fascinating. The movie does talk about formal education, homeschooling, and unschooling.
If you ever watched ""War on Kids"" and didn't like that very much, and want to see what families do besides school, watch this movie. However, you may or may not like it. It all depends on your perspective, values, and beliefs when watching this film. In addition, there are also several speakers (who are knowledgeable on different educational choices) that talk about families and learning. Well I hope you enjoy!",1473811200,6,991,5.085889570552148
7673421,5,B01CDHXVAS,"If you're considering homeschooling, this is worth watching. It'll take some of the pressure off of you, and you will realize that 1) you don't need to recreate a ""school environment"" at home where you sit your kids at a desk and lecture to them and give them busy work. And 2) that your kids WANT to learn-- your job is not to force it upon them but to fuel their curiosity and let them run with it.",1473552000,7,400,4.141025641025641
7673422,5,B01CDHXVAS,"Very Interesting documentary, but its very narrow in that it only covers one family who suddenly makes a decision to home school their teenage children. Much of the issues of parents who start home school K-12 will not get much value from this documentary. I wish they could have covered more than one family.",1472256000,3,309,4.7407407407407405
7673423,5,B01CDHXVAS,This documentary came at the perfect time for me. I had been considering homeschooling but had a hard time taking the leap. This film inspired me to finally dive in.,1471478400,,165,4.533333333333333
7673424,5,B01CDHXVAS,"I loved this movie.  It really gives a clear picture of what homeschooling can be like and what the transition is like if you are leaving a school situation.  The girls that they focused on as the primary subjects really grew in this movie, from kids who couldn't stand school and the whole idea of learning, to young women who were playing an active role in their education, deciding what they wanted to learn and who they wanted to be.  If you are on the fence about homeschooling yourself, you already do it and want to see a great movie about it, or you just want to get more educated about what homeschooling is, this movie is for you.  I highly recommend it!",1471392000,2,664,4.373983739837398
7673425,5,B01CDHXVAS,Good information,1468540800,2,16,7.5
7673426,4,B01CDHXVAS,This is a good movie for anyone considering home schooling their kids or just wanting to get another viewpoint on the state of public schools today.  When watching this movie it comes across as soft and not pushy.  I liked that it didn't say that there was one right way but rather explored other families and how they homeschool.,1466380800,6,330,4.576271186440678
7673427,4,B01CDHXVAS,"This gives a good look at several of the different types of homeschooling, as well as many reasons to consider homeschooling for your family.",1464393600,3,141,4.916666666666667
8752651,1,B01CDHXVAS,"This movie made homeschoolers look like snowflakes.  Our family does not homeschool because we dislike rules, schedules, and sharing space with lots of people. Our focus is ""productive"" struggle vs ""non-productive"" struggle. The family in this movie seemed to be focused on removing all types of struggle - whether productive or not.  Such a disappointing film.  It was very specific to California, with a nod to Oregon, but within our fair state there are so many different configurations of homeschool families - not just comfortable middle class ones that look like they shop at World Market and Trader Joe's.  Nothing in the movie about how homeschooling yields many benefits for low-income families and at-risk families, and families of color... Way to go filmmakers!  You made the homeschool scene look extremely douche-y.  I would never show this film to people if I actually wanted them to LIKE homeschooling.",1533600000,,917,5.204081632653061
8752652,4,B01CDHXVAS,Being a homeschooling family it was nice to actually find a decent documentary exploring home education. It was fairly generalized and obviously was only following the experience of one family. I enjoyed it over all and look forward to more documentaries in the future.,1531180800,,269,5.136363636363637
8752653,3,B01CDHXVAS,Great story about a family and their struggles with homeschooling. I wish there was more information though about the types of homeschooling methods they used and reviews of those programs.,1527292800,,189,5.333333333333333
8752654,4,B01CDHXVAS,Good documentary about homeschooling.,1522540800,,37,8.5
8752655,5,B01CDHXVAS,Great movie that really helped my family understand my choice to homeschool my son. To see so many people validate my feelings assured me my choice was right!,1517356800,,158,4.678571428571429
8752656,3,B01CDHXVAS,"Decent overview of the alternative choice of home schooling.  Unfortunately, the brief length of the movie format does not lend itself to in-depth analysis.  So the net was cast rather wide and the discussion kept broad and shallow.

Not too impressed with the filmmaker's choice of family to feature as the case study.  It appeared the director's intent was to draw hesitant, unsure audience members in by exhibiting a family they could relate to.  But the tense, high-strung mother and passive step-father seemed to be setting an example of what not to do...letting their children sit around and do nothing, and then recreating the public schooling pedagogical fallacy by purchasing a traditional curriculum.  There was a little drama about a homework demerit given to the older girl--kind of a ""last straw"" with the public school--and the family couldn't even get the story straight in their separate recounts:  The girl said plainly that she did not get one of her assignments done....the mom says in a separate shot that she did the homework but forgot to turn it in (adding that her daughter is ""such a good kid"" in a semi emotional tone of voice, as though she had suffered somehow by receiving this demerit for not finishing her homework).  It looked like the parents were shielding their little snowflake from unpleasant, non affirming consequences and conflating their own personal offense at the demerit with the school's overall quality and effectiveness.  I can understand if parents think the homework load is excessive and understand the downfalls of excessive use of demerits, but if that's the case, then just leave it at that.  Don't conflate overall school quality with debatable disagreements on disciplinary philosophy.

It was a bit clunky, but an adequate introduction to the idea that public schooling is neither satisfactory nor the only available option.  I was much more impressed with the filmmaker's podcast interview on Chris Kresser's Revolution Health Radio (which, ironically, was plugging this film) than I was with this film.",1494720000,3,2060,5.153153153153153
8752657,5,B01CDHXVAS,"Great documentary! Although I'm still new to the thought of homeschooling, I wish this documentary would of touched base on the clerical side of hs. Like how to properly file a PSA in California. One of the reasons I wanted to watch this film was because the family was from Cal. So I was really hoping to see if they talked about the legal side as well. They really dove more into how to Unschool or Deschool. Which,don't get me wrong,can be a very beneficial way of hs. For me personally,Thinking about starting hs from a public school,it will take my brain a while to learn how to teach deschooling to my children. I do recomend the film. It helped with many other questions I had as well. Like the difference between,private school hs vs charter school hs.",1486425600,,760,4.5144927536231885
