3520208,4,B001CUAY3U,"My family and I recently travelled to Galvaston Texas and learned about this storm.  I read the book and wanted to see the documentary.

The product was as described.  The dvd was circular as expected and fit into my dvd player.  The center hole was the correct diameter and fit snuggly on the dvd player hub.  The data on the disk was correctly installed and worked properly.  The dvd case performed flawlessly.  The disk came in one piece and undamaged.  The cover was clearly labeled and has the title along the edge, so you can find it when stored with other dvds.  The case is top notch.",1402704000,,592,4.457943925233645

8289721,1,B001CUAY3U,"Information was good but as the title suggests, it only pertained to Isaac, the man who failed to properly warn Galvestonians of the incoming storm in a timely manner.

More stories pertaining to the greatest disaster ever to hit this country and the History channel missed out on presenting them.

DVD quality is very bad.",1465776000,,323,4.8545454545454545
8289722,5,B001CUAY3U,I teach Texas history and purchased this dvd some time ago. The documentary is very well done and engages students at a very high level. I could teach about the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 for a week and the students would not retain the information as well as they do when they view this video. Highly recommend both for the classroom and for individual viewing.,1459728000,,363,4.6
