1050871,3,6305588171,"About a vamp that is a trouble maker and picks up another one that he made and tries t stop the Dracula himself.  Lots of boobs but that's it swearing too, but that's normal.",1276473600,,174,4.117647058823529
1050872,1,6305588171,"What where these people thinking? I can't believe they even made this movie! From the silly opening scene where the main vampire is driving and admiring his fangs in the rearview mirror, to him brushing and filing (FILING!) his fangs in the morning, to the silly accents everybody had, to the lisps that proved the actors couldn't master talking with fangs (or was it intentional?) - this movie is just plain stupid. All of the actors in this movie (bear in mind this movie was filmed 9 years ago) must be ashamed of being in it, of that I am sure!

Everything is so over the top it's just stupid. The plot is a mess, the characters are laughable, and please don't remind me of those incredibly cheesy accents! The acting is so bad it's actually painful in some scenes. The wild cat sounds when some of the vampires attack? And the whole ""gangbanger/crip"" theme, turning the whole thing into a ""white vampires vs. black vampires"" sort of deal? I just don't see the logic. It's all just incredibly stupid to me.

Is this movie supposed to be a spoof, a satire? I honestly can't tell, and the description doesn't specify that (if it had I wouldn't have rented it). I like my vampire movies with substance and logic. This movie tries to be so many things it's none of the above. Don't waste your time. It's just dumb.",1225411200,4,1314,4.493723849372385
1050873,3,6305588171,"Well, now... this movie is not what you'd call a masterpiece. I once saw it some years ago in german language. As the tape was from our local video rental station, the quality was not exactly great. I enjoyed the movie immensly - it IS trash (despite some realy great actors), but I do like trash.
When I noticed there was a DVD available I couldn't resist in buying. It had something about a ""Special Director's Cut"" ananounced, but I hat to realise there was nothing new in this version. Maybe the german tape was from the directors cut, too.
The Quality is allrigth - some classes better than the old rental tape. the picture is clear, the sound is well. There are some nice features - the trailer, biographies to the main actors (you get a lot informations about them with this DVD), a commentary (which I haven't tried yet) and a interesting, partly funny Behind-The-Scenes-Featurette. The sound on the last mentioned is not so great, but as it is only a feature I think it's OK.
If you like trashy vampire-movies with real modern vampires you should definitivly check this DVD out - it's not exactly expensive, and you got a very nice version of the movie!",1218326400,,1162,4.564593301435407
1050874,3,6305588171,"Dracula is in modern day Los Angeles and is trying to control all the vampires living in the city. Campy fun with not much of a plot. It's funny to listen to the actors try to talk with their fake vampire fangs on. They all come across as lispy and ridiculous, although I'm not sure that was the intention. Good for a laugh.",1183852800,,324,4.158730158730159

1050876,1,6305588171,"What the heck were they thinking when they made this movie? Were they trying to make a horror movie, a comedy movie, or an action movie? I couldn't tell, because it failed in every single one of those categories, and more. Even worse was the casting...I mean, sweet, lovely Eldin from 'Murphy Brown' as Count Dracula? And Mr Wick from 'Drew Carey' as an evil vampire? And Kim Catrall as a...actually, I don't know what she was, or where her accent was supposed to be from. Every accent in this was laughably bad, as bad as the acting, if you could call it acting. And the plotline was so illogical...I mean, allegedly the Count wanted to kill off a vampire girl because her killing spree was drawing attention to the existence of the other vampires. But then, the other vampires went around biting and abducting and killing people whenever they went, so how were they any better?

This movie was awful. I think it was made simply for the sake of getting to see lots of people with their clothes off and women kissing one another. I don't usually have a problem with seeing either of those things in a movie, but in this instance I feel that there should have been more to the movie than just that...like a believable plot, for instance, or acting, or suspense, or something, anything, your average moviegoer would find interesting.

The worst thing about this movie (and boy was it hard, in a movie this bad, to find a thing I hated more than everything else) was that many of the vampires had tans. And not only did they have tans, but they had tan lines where they'd obviously been wearing swimsuits while tanning out in THE SUN. Five bucks worth of fake tan probably could have fixed that little glitch and hid the tan lines. But no one involved this movie was cluey enough to think of it. That, or they realised the movie was crud and just didn't care. I got the feeling everyone involved in this was just there to get their paycheck.

By the way, don't be fooled by the credit at the beginning of the movie that reads: 'music by Danny Elfman'. I think he does about one song in the whole movie, tops, and that was probably only because this movie was Richard Elfman's project (my guess is that they're related, and Danny did it as a favour, probably because he felt sorry for poor untalented Richard.)

My advice is to avoid this movie. There are better skinflicks than this that you could be watching.

If you want to see a GOOD, funny movie with the talented Natasha Lyonne kissing a girl in it, get hold of 'But I'm A Cheerleader'.",1160870400,4,2539,4.463362068965517
1050877,5,6305588171,"As a youngster I learn to be scared of as well as facinated by Vampires. Dracula was so cool, there have been really good films about Vampires. Then there are those who sort of makes fun or create a campy version, this one being one of those. I love seen Craig Ferguson in anything, but I really did enjoy his preformance in this film. He looks so handsome in his fangs, he is a gentle soul, even if he is a Vampire.  Buy it..I think most Vampire fans will enjoy it.",1145577600,5,466,4.1208791208791204
1050878,1,6305588171,"I think this movie was a complete waste of my time and money.  The movie was so bad that, from now on, it will only collect dust on my shelf.  I highly discourage anyone considering this movie. It is nearly a joke with the shallow acting, over-done sound effects and thin plot. Terrible...Terrible...Terrible.",1126137600,9,309,4.811320754716981
1050879,1,6305588171,"Oh, where do I begin to list the woes inflicted by this film?

Modern Vampires is so bad that it's actually hysterical.  The cliches are obvious.  The plot is so weak that it's nonexistant.  The acting is horrendous.  The ""special effects"" look like they were cooked up in someone's basement.  The dialogue is taxing to the point of being annoying.  I was actually forced to mute the film at several points to simply be able to watch it.  The only redeeming value to this film is a nice shot of Casper Van Dien's [...].

Honestly, I couldn't decide which was funnier -- ""Richard"" encouraging the young vamp, Nico, to ""rips the lungs out"" of a store clerk, the pregnant vamp that's been happily expecting for years, the comments made in the VW bus by the ""Crips"" about being the ""first black vampires"", or the death scene for Dracula.

If you're into bad B-movies simply for their ability to make you laugh, then Modern Vampires is fits the bill perfectly.  Although -- I hate to admit this but truth is truth -- Dracula: Dead and Loving It (starring Mel Brooks and Leslie Nielson) is a much better vampire comedy in every respect: acting, dialogue, and effects.  If a Mel Brooks film is better than one that is supposedly meant to be a ""serious"" film, then you know its bad.",1107820800,8,1274,4.5394736842105265
1050880,1,6305588171,I bought this movie for Casper Van Dien and Kim Cattrail and the hope that it would be a fun vampire movie. I fast forwarded through a lot of it due to the fact that it was not that interesting. I could not find one character in the movie to root for or care about. If you want a fun vamp show with a character to root for stick with Buffy.,1107216000,6,340,3.8028169014084505

Van Helsing (Stieger) has his own possee, Gabriel Casseuss (Black Dog, Black Hawk Down) with his gangsta thugs who help Van Helsing in the fight with vampires. Crappy acting filled with boredom beyond your imagination. Kim Cattrall (Sex and The City, 15 Minutes) is in this movie and she has sex with a bunch of black guys in her demon form and then they turn into vampires...wow..what fun! not! it was stupid. Udo Kier (Blade, Barb Wire) also stars in a throwaway supportee role. Best line in this whole entire movie is ""Count Dracula my ass!"" as the black guys light and stake Dracula too death, that was the only funny part, otherwise it was a complete mess of a movie.",1099094400,6,1104,4.725388601036269
1050948,1,6305588171,"I'm a person who likes B-movies but this one is not in the ""so bad it's good"" category, it's just plain ""bad"".
So what do we have here?
Well, we have Natasha Gregson Wagner trying hard to be an even cutsier version of the feral female vamp that Annie Parillaud did so much better in ""Innocent Blood"". -- Yech!
We have Casper Van Dien from Starship Troopers trying hard to be an even badder version of Tom Cruise's Lestat at the conclusion of ""Interview With the Vampire"". Mr. bad-a** rock'n'roll vampire cruising down the highway in a hot car. Yeah right. -- Yech!!
We have various supporting actors who just plain can't act, plus a script that relishes cardboard stereotypes.
We have an unbelievably bad performance from Rod Steiger as Dr. Van Helsing. My respect for him as a great actor went right out the window after seeing this horribly cartoony excuse for acting. He and poor Udo Kier must have been in sore need of a paycheck to make the next payments on their Maseratis or something to stoop to the level of this totally uninspired and worthless waste of time. What WERE they thinking???
And to try and up the ""coolness"" factor of this movie we have Gabriel Casseus and his gang of Homies doing the overused-to-death ploy of ""cool black dudes highlight hopeless un-hipness of straight, uptight white dudes"". -- Ultra-Yech!!!
Throw in some gratuitous nude scenes (including the Homies having group sex with a vampire bat-chick), and ""boy have we got a movie for you!"" -- NOT!!
-- But hey, I hated ""Fright Night"" too, so what do I know? If you like films like ""Fright Night"", ""Love At First Bite"" and ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"", you might like this one too.
But if your taste in Vampire films is more atmospheric like ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" or the Hammer films, you should stay FAR, far away from this one.",1086739200,21,1824,4.615384615384615
1050949,4,6305588171,"This movie is deliberately, carefully, precicely made to be absolutely awful. And because it's supposed to be so bad, because no effort is made to make it a dramatic great, it's perfect. It's got some great ideas - I LOVE the vampire hunters and the take on Van Helsing.
This movie is, in it's way, seamless. I put off getting it for so long, despite Amazon popping it into my recommendations every other day for a year; and now that I have it I'm glad.
It's evenly paced, cheerful, full of action, a little love story, some bloody murder, utterly horrible special effects and some synthisyzer-dubbed wildcat screams. You can't take it seriously, and you're not supposed to. But for all that, it's very well made.",1085097600,19,713,4.666666666666667
1050950,1,6305588171,"This worthless sack of filth that somehow was made into a film is all we have to pay tribute to Bram Stoker who basically started the entire meaning of vampire fiction? Well this is total disrespect and I can't believe people actually allow these kind of movies out. Honestly throughout this entire movie I wondered which one offended vampirism the worst- Queen of the Damned, another horrible vampire movie, or this one. But I will state here and now I would watch Queen of the Damned a million times than ever watch this film again, although I hate Damned dearly- but not as much as this film. Did this movie have depth whatsoever- any kind of human feeling? NO. Sure, that man that's supposed to be Van Helsing tries to make us cry about his own personal reasons of why he's killing vampires- but that does not save the movie whatsoever. I don't care if this was to be a movie that was only for laughs- this movie I couldn't laugh with because it was just ridiculous and once more like so many other horrid vampire movies made today- made vampires look like all they do is have sex and drink blood- without any sort of conscience. I hated this movie and never would recommend it to anyone.
Come on people, how about making occult movies that evolve around characters that actually are not all a bunch of moronic sex- manics with no souls? It would be nice for a change don't you think?",1085011200,2,1388,4.468503937007874
1050951,3,6305588171,"There are no modern vampires in this story (the youngest having been turned 20 years previously) as most of them are very old.  The story centers around an outlaw vampire (Van Dien), the young vampire, Dr. Van Helsing (Steiger) and The Count.
The Count rules the vampire world and must approve all new vampires.  The young vampire was not approved.  The outlaw is back in town for a few days.  Van Helsing out to tell everyone he is Van Helsing.
Not only do we have some very silly-acting vampires (especially the one played by Drew Carry's Mr. Wick), but Steiger seems completely clueless about everything except killing vampires.  To top it off, none of the actors seemed to have taken the time to learn how to speak while wearing fangs.  The whole movie can be summed up in the opening scene where we see Van Diem using a fang to poke a hole in the end of his cigar.
The real problem is that is feels almost like this was supposed to be a serious vampire film with some comedy accents but it comes off as silly and cheap.  But, silly and cheap is still entertaining, so you will probably like this one.",1071187200,2,1105,4.413793103448276
1050952,3,6305588171,"I was not expecting this satircal, campy spoof when I popped the DVD in the player...for the first few minutes I wasn't sure I wanted to watch...after about 10 minutes I was involuntarily drawn into this fun and silly movie--spoofing many of the vampire traditions, while at the same time creating believable characters about whom we come to care, however reluctantly.  I found myself chuckling involuntarily at the one-liners (""Be still, my beating trousers!""), and at the absurd and hilarious plot turn in which some gangsters are recruited to help the German professor nail some vampires in Los Angeles.  The gags, while unapologetically blatant and silly, are nonetheless funny.  Have you ever seen a vampire brush his teeth, giving particular attention to his fangs?  Or, perhaps you have seen a solitious eternally-pregnant vampire, doomed to never give birth, take a new young vampire under her wing, take her shopping and school her in the finer arts of vampirism and glamour?  My favorite scene, I must admit, is near the end with the gangsters...I will not spoil the surprise.  Keep a lookout, also, for Udo Kier--ever a vampire throughout his movie career--you would have seen him as the head vampire in Blade (1998) and as Count Dracula himself in Andy Warhol's Frankenstien (1974). This is original and funny...don't put it in the player if you are looking for suspense, thrills or horror.  Put it in if you need a good laugh.",1067990400,8,1439,4.970833333333333
1050953,5,6305588171,"This movie is a riot.  It involves an alternate vampire world a la Buffy or Anita Blake, but does not take itself too seriously.  If you've seen the Steve Martin movie ""LA Story"", this is the LA Story world with vampires.  The acting is sometimes wonderfully over the top (Kim Cattrall from ""Sex in the City"", Rod Steiger as Van Helsing and Craig Ferguson as a terrific British Vamp) sometimes merely adequate (Casper Van Dien of course), but its the ridiculous situational comedy scenes that make this movie.
Modern Vampires has TUNS of terrifically bizarre scenes. The ""people as food"" motif is hilariously done in an LA sort of way.  You have a crazed Dr. Van Helsing aided by Crypts gang members going after bizarre fun-loving and weird LA Vamps, who are themselves enmeshed in trying to help a trailer park trash vamp (played well by Natasha Gregson Wagner) in learning how to be civilized while not incurring the wrath of the local head vamp who wants her ""dead.""
For a T&A rating, this movie gets a big 2 thumbs up.  There is a good sprinkling of jovial and perky nakedness throughout that helps makes this movie a nice grade-B gem.  While Modern Vampires did not make it to the big screen, it certainly deserves to be watched at home.  5 stars on the B-grade movie scale.",1057104000,12,1279,4.607929515418502
1050954,4,6305588171,"Somewhere there must have been an axiom written that all vampire movies must be horribly written and acted. This film definitely falls into that category. Never the less, I find this film highly entertaining. Casper Van Dien stars as Dallas, a vampire who appears to be the protagonist. Interestingly, this film seems to portray vampires as both evil and good. (As witnessed by the Count and Dallas, respectively.) All in all the film seems to be more of a good time than any sort of chronicle on vampire lore. This film definitely has the most interesting way of making people into vampires I've ever seen though... If you like vampire movies, you'll enjoy this. If you liked Interview with the Vampire, but hated Queen of the Damned, you probably won't enjoy this (it's more on the Queen of the Damned side of vampire films).",1056585600,4,827,4.75

But unlike juvenile tripe such as ""My best friend is a vampire"" and ""love at first bite,"" ""MODERN VAMPIRES"" truly excels as a quality adult horror film, ripe and rife with sparkling wit, clever innuendo, hot and sexy vampire vixens, excellent acting, and art direction of a caliber that allows genuinely qualified comparison to major hollywood studio pictures. And unlike ""Dusk til Dawn,"" there was actually good writing and a fun, ingenious plot, nearly gordian in complexity, that kept me guessing right up to, literally, the very last minute of the film!!!... And yet it was just as entertaining to watch this movie a SECOND time!!! I look forward to watching it a third time as well. Certainly a MAJOR achievement in this age of cutting intellectual corners (especially in action films) to leave more room for the sex and violence. And yet there was still plenty of sex and violence, my friends-- hooray for the sex and violence! With enough blood to satisfy even a rather jaded geek such as myself, MODERN VAMPIRES kept me wide-eyed and laughing, entertained from the first scene to the last.

So sexy! This is the best vampire movie to ever come out of the USA. Fantastic Tragi-comedy at its most divine level of suspension of disbelief. I really believed that all the actors were vampires, they were so good, even though some of them had bigger fangs than others. The scary parts were really scary, and the funny parts were just hilarious, and when the film was over I felt completely and totally satisfied. My boyfriend was happy too because I was holding on so tight. He also loved the movie, though. Also there are a lot of sexy parts in the movie, but the people are so pretty and the movie is so well-written and perfectly directed and filmed that even when it's bloody, it's still really totally stylish and so much fun to watch (and such a turn-on too), which I guess must be hard to do because I see so little of it in other movies.

Rod Steiger is simply perfect as Van Helsing chasing down vampires in modern day Los Angeles.
Oh yeah, plenty of T&A to please everyone, as well! Think Kim Catrall does Sex in the City of Angels. Natasha Gregson Wagner will be emblazoned on the retinas of Vampire lore aficionados for decades.

I would recommend that anyone whos curious about this movie, let me put it this way - I would rather bang my head against a wall for a few days then to sit through another minute of this movie!",995328000,7,419,4.121951219512195
1051056,3,6305588171,"I'm crying as I pan this.  It really hurts to do it.  I adore the Forbidden Zone and Shrunken Heads.  I think it's really sad that Richard Elfman can't get the budget he disserves.  He couldn't even get his own brother to score more than the theme song!
I tried to like this film.  I Really tried.  I knew I would never admit that after waiting several years, that Richard would make a bad movie...but this is bad.  The acting and script are just not very good.  The sound editing sounds like your watching a home video.  Rod Stieger's character repeats everything that he and everyone else says too often.  By the way...he is Dr. Van Helsing from Vienna, which he tells you ad nauseum.  The white trash vampire is cute but annoying.  I don't have a problem with Casper Van Deen.  I met him in San Diego, and for a pretty boy, he's almost as much of a sci-fi geek as Mark Hamil.  Casper's heart is in the right place.  Udo (sp?) is great as well.  Dracula and Kin Catrell could have used a lot of improvement.
The Crips and the finale were high points of the movie.  All in all, it was mildly entertaining.  I like the idea of the film, I just think it could have been better executed.
Watch this movie if you're a Richard Elfman fan or if you get a kick out of watching campy/bad movies.  I know a lot of reviewers loved this movie, but even as an Elfman fan, I just couldn't get into it.  Sorry.",992995200,3,1397,4.21969696969697

We made it to where Kim Catrall's character took the guy home and killed him and stuffed him in the trunk, and we saw a little of the night club scene that followed. After that. it was a race to see who could get the remote the fastest. I won.  This movie was so beyond absurd it would be kind to call it ridiculous.  I was expecting a good ""Modern Vampire"" horror story. That is what the film is billed as, a horror story. What it is however, is one of the biggest loads to come down the pike in quite a while.  I was saddened to see the great Rod Steiger in this  piece of garbage.  But as my wife said ""He's paying the bills."" This movie is another shining example of hollywoods mistaken attitude that their are no more true horror fans left, so they crank out this crap that instead of going for genuine scares goes for genuine stupidity. It's like they are bending over backwards to show that they don't take the genre serious anymore. Well, some of us do and we want a good scary movie, and this ain't it. The only ones to get it right in years are John Carpenter with ""Vampires"" and Wes Craven with ""Dracula 2000."" both excellent horror movies. They knew what they were doing.  I don't know what the guy who made this was doing. I do know he failed at it.  This movie tries for comedy and it fails there too.

It just shows you the Lifestyle of the upperclass L.A. Vampires and there twisted and funny way of life. The hilarious and gory way they view and kill humans is just to funny for words.

Blade was straight ahead, big budget, horror action.  Modern Vampires is an an audacious, subtle masterpiece that satirizes society.  The art on the cover has people not in the film, acting serious, holding ""blades"" that one never sees in the film.  So much for DEVIOUS ADVERTISING.  The film is great if you want off the wall humor and subversive attitudes.

It's an up-to-date vampire movie which you don't see many of those these days. Most of vampire flicks are period movies. This black comedic movie has a good plot and a well written script. The lead character named Dallas, played by Casper Van Dein, comes to Los Angeles to see old friends when the boss of the vampire society Count Dracula, played by Robert Pastorelli, finds out that Dallas is in the city and wants him dead. During this problem Dallas meets and falls in love with a another vampire named Nico, played by Natasha Gregson-Wagner, and that makes for bigger trouble. And on top of all of this Dr. Van Helsing comes into town to kill all the vampires. That's messed up!  Plus the fact that Casper Van Dein looks good in fangs(that's just my opinion).

My guess is that the people involved in the  filming of this movie are hardcore Vampire: The Masquerade players.  Although none of  the vampires seemed to have much in the way of  supernatural powers, the setting is very tongue-in-cheek White Wolf.  The  movie is shamelessly cheesy, and even features the vampire flick legend Udo  Kier as a short-lived vampire with a choice death scene.  Could he have it  any other way?
The pairing of a Nazi Van Helsing with a rag-tag team of  Crips is priceless.  Similarly, the culture clash between trailer trash  vamps, Ilsa-the-Wicked-Wardenesque vamps, jolly-old-chap British vamps, and  German vampire artistes provide unabashedly hokey and hilarious dialogue.  The movie also has lots of cute and gratuitous T&A, if you like that  sorta thing.

Everything about it is sooo bad. -The acting, the script (there was a script ?), the not-very-special effects, the ""humor"", etc. -I was almost expecting Leslie Nielsen to pop up any second. But probably worst of all is what could very well be the sleaziest, most pathetic and non-informative DVD commentary track ever recorded. The director and his star come across as a pair of horny juveniles, constantly drooling over the ""sexy"" actresses in their awful movie. They talk preciously little about the effects, no doubt because they realize they're so bad, few and far between. -Like the movie itself, this commentary is one big boring snooze. There's clearly nothing sensible for them to talk about, so if you compare it to, say, the perfectly done Universal Monster Classics DVDs, I guess these two guys did a pretty thorough job afterall !. Why on Earth did Steiger and Cattrall take part in this sick film ?. And how come it's only full screen, when I've seen it letterboxed on German TV with more picture information on each side ?. Not that I care, of course. One good thing though; the music from the best fang flick ever, ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"", seem to have inspired composer Elfman (brother of the director). I won't even start mentioning any of the great Hammer movies, but the nutty ""John Carpenter's Vampires"" is like the ""Citizen Kane"" of vampire movies compared to this dull stinker !.

The acting is perfect. Not a serious minute from  any of the actors, only from the vampirehunting Van Helsing, played by a  fat and bald Rod Steiger, and he is so serious and fanatic that its even  funnier! Natasha Wagner plays a young vampireversion of Nikita or even  Betty Blue, she's beautiful. Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers) also is  good. Only the count seems a bit boring sometimes.
The best thing is that  noone of the vampires seems to take anything seriously, they drink blood  from some humans, order a pickup for the corpse as others would order a  pizza, and then just enjoys themselves. For those who enjoy the old Hammer  movies, this might not be your stuff, but otherwise I would recommend noone  to miss this.",948585600,5,977,4.589595375722543

Now, given the dreck that is mainstreamed these days, it's a damn  shame Modern Vampires was direct to video. But for this who catch it, it is  a great find. Not only a nice take on the vampire genre, liberally campy of  course, it is just down right hilarious. I have not proceeded to laugh out  loud at a film in quite some time. Supplied with the fact that I couldn't  believe the number of ""known"" actors in the film. From the likes  of legends like Rod Steiger and Udo Kier, to young upstarts Natasha Watson  and Casper Van Dien (forget Starship Troopers, he is even better here, and  gets to show some range). Toss in perennial supporters like Rob Passtorelli  and Kim Catrall and a host of others. Bottom line: this movie is a hidden  gem. And forget the ridiculous packaging. It is completely misleading.

Two of may favorites: at a vampire disco, apparently an undead man has been lured in, stripped, and is about to devoured in some way. He yells, ""You can't do this to ME, I'm an attorney!"" and as a vampire-character with a posh British accent is immolated, finally ending his reign or terror, the flaming body calls out, ""Crikey!!!""

Worth watching more than once, as the fairly-famed actors seem to actually enjoy hamming it up for this farce. Most actors always have more fun playing bad guys.
