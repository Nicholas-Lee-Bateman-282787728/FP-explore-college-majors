7848666,3,630347750X,"Okay...

A lot of schtick humor. Numerous desperate grabs. Ideal for male in their late teens/ early 20s. If you enjoy decent to good standup or comedy that requires any type of thought or the slightest of wit, this may not be for you.",1445212800,,235,4.340909090909091
7848667,5,630347750X,"Hilarious, wish they had new stuff....",1433635200,,38,5.5
7848668,5,630347750X,"It beats out 90% of the comedies you've been watching mainly because
the jokes are unpredictable ha-ha for those who like surprises!",1348444800,,132,5.045454545454546
7848669,5,630347750X,"This is not Jerky Boys The Movie, this is the guys prank calling people and filming their reactions.  It is NOT the hollywood movie with Ozzy Osbourne it it!!!! If you think it is, you're retarded.  If you posted on here thinking it was, then you should find a way to remove yourself from the gene pool.
In my opinion, this was $4 well spent.  These guys crack me up no matter what they do.  i really don't know where they get their skills, words, and ideas from.",1068854400,2,463,4.2272727272727275
7848670,3,630347750X,"The Movie was alright, but I think the cds are better. The plot wasn't really that good and there wasn't really any crank calls in it. The Jerky boys should make video tape of them making crank calls and only sell it on video and not in the theatre.",995500800,,249,4.1020408163265305
7848671,5,630347750X,"Some of the reviewers for this video have it confused with Jerky Boys Movie,wich is not available at Amazon.""Don't Hang Up,Toughguy!"" is a video compilation of HILARIOUS prank calls,tour bus Tom Foolery,and wild p.a. system antics. The latter strikes me the funniest,they really went all out over the supermarket's public address system. A well-earned five stars! Buy it now! As for the Jerky Boys Movie,it's a full-length feature film starring everyone's favorite pranksters,in which they make a prank call to the mob and get in a hell of a lot of trouble...if you see it anywhere,GET IT,it's pretty hard to find,and also deserves five stars. Well,I hope this clears up some of the confusion between these two vids...bye for now you bunch of loudmouth liverlips!",988502400,2,763,5.112
7848672,4,630347750X,"I decided to buy this to see if this really was any good. I figured that it would just be a rehash of some old bits with video. I was really  surprised after the first 10 minutes. They really took advantage of the  video form, and while the quality was a bit ameteurish, it was a hilarious  addition to my video collection.
  In some of the bits they start to  make funny messages over a loudspeaker in the supermarket and a tour bus  and you can see the peoples reactions. Also, they have hidden cameras  around some of the MTV offices (This is partly made by them) and make prank  calls. If you've heard ""A Need To Dance"" on one of the Jerky Boys  albums, you will know what it's like.
  It comes down to this. If you  think prank calls and the Jerky Boys are funny, don't be at all hesitant to  get this.",969321600,7,807,4.122580645161291
7848673,5,630347750X,"Man, this is a hillarious video full of hillarious prank calls. All five of the Jerkey boys succeeded in this movie. The Jerkey Boys creators went  on to announce on a tour bus also and were announce in a groecery store  with the voices that made me take a big wizz in my pants. Now, I want this  video for special occasions.",966470400,,325,4.209677419354839
7848674,5,630347750X,"Listen punk, this movie is the greatest, ya hear.  No if you don't like it, tough.  Watch this movie as soon as possible liver lips, and don't make me come down their after ya tough guy!",948326400,,186,4.138888888888889
