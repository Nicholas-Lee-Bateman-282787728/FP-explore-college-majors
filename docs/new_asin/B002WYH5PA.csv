4008442,5,B002WYH5PA,Both great movies!,1405641600,,18,5.333333333333333
4008443,5,B002WYH5PA,Loved these two movies as a child and purchased these for my 2 daughters.  They crack up at Troop Beverly Hills as we are also active in Girl Scouts!,1400630400,,149,4.137931034482759
4008444,5,B002WYH5PA,"These movies take me back to my childhood and how they helped me get by everyday and now I get to watch them with my two daughters, who now have happy memories with this movie.",1389225600,,176,4.057142857142857
4008445,3,B002WYH5PA,"Neither of these movies send a very good message to kids, and both are geared towards young girls (9-15?).  They both show adults behaving badly and kids suffering as a result.  A divorce seems to be just as central to the Troop Beverly Hills plot as the girl scout troop itself.  Either way, my wife loves these movies and since we run a girl scout troop wanted my daughers to see Troop BH.  I am not a prude, and they weren't horrible movies, but there are much better out there.",1375315200,,481,4.311111111111111
4008446,4,B002WYH5PA,"I got this for my 11 year old daughter for when she has friends sleeping over.  These movies are good value, but best of all, they're good clean fun and she loves them...especially 'Troop Beverley Hills'.",1363910400,,204,4.666666666666667
4008447,5,B002WYH5PA,I received this set quick n new condition! My kids even loved them as well! Great sharing childhood favorites with your children!,1360108800,,129,4.909090909090909
4008448,5,B002WYH5PA,"The movies are great and it was delightful to be able to watch them after so many years. I used to love them when I was a child and 15 years later, they are still fun! The pack was a great idea for a slumber party for girls any age. And the nail stickers that come inside are adorable.",1345507200,,285,3.847457627118644
4008449,4,B002WYH5PA,"This set was a gift for my daughters birthday because she loves the Babysitters club. There were two movies, The Babysitters Club and  Troop Beverley Hills. The Babysitters Club was good, as expected but The Troop Beverley Hills had a few cuss words that were a surprise to both me and my children. Other than that it was a good purchase. So if you don't mind your child listening to cussing its a great choice, but as for me I like to monitor what my children  watch because even the little things play a part in their overall well-being and who they become as people.",1323820800,5,569,4.40952380952381
4008457,5,B002WYH5PA,Loved this as a kid,1453593600,,19,3.0
4008458,5,B002WYH5PA,I watched Troop Beverly Hills back in the 80s.  I was more than thrilled to order it for my daughter and I to watch together.  She enjoyed it just as much as I did back in the day.  The Babysitter's Club movie was a great addition.,1446595200,,231,3.9782608695652173
4008459,5,B002WYH5PA,God Bless whoever thought it would be a good idea to combine the BSC Movie with Troop Beverly Hills on one dvd - and such a bargain price!  I bought one for myself and one for my sister and we couldn't be happier!,1446508800,,213,3.953488372093023
4008460,5,B002WYH5PA,We love this movie. We had our Girl Scout troop watch this movie and they loved it except there were a few bad words that could have been left out.,1444262400,,147,3.933333333333333

4008465,5,B002WYH5PA,My 11 y/o daughter loved this. She was excited for Babysitters Club and had never seen Troop Beverly Hills! Loved both of them.,1420156800,,127,4.565217391304348
4008466,3,B002WYH5PA,"Good deal that you can get this two-fer pack for about the same price or less as buying Troop Beverly Hills by itself!

So I'm not having the best luck with the ""PG"" movies of the 80s.  I think a lot of these would probably be PG-13 these days.  I grabbed Troop Beverly Hills for my 8 and 10 year old girls on a road trip.  I sort of remembered the movie from when I was younger, and it seemed like something they might like.

There is a lot of talk about divorce in this movie and some mommy/daddy issues.  Not the worst thing in the world, but seems like a bit of a downer.  The girls said they thought the movie was ""pretty good"" but I think in retrospect there are probably some better, brighter movies that they would have enjoyed more.",1413244800,,741,4.13986013986014

8383441,5,B002WYH5PA,This came way faster than I expected. The movies bring me back to my childhood I cant wait to share them with my daughters. Best 10$ Ive spent in awhile.,1519862400,,153,4.133333333333334

8383446,5,B002WYH5PA,I love both of these movies so much and I just couldn't pass up the price!!,1473292800,,75,3.75
8383447,4,B002WYH5PA,"I loved this movie as a young girl and wanted to share it with my daughter. However, was shocked by the cursing. I think since I typically watched it on TV as a child, curse words must have been bleeped and some scenes deleted. Still love it, just be aware it is not as wholesome as you may remember but is still just as fun!",1459036800,2,325,4.015384615384615
