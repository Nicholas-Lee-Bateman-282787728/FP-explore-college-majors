2248668,4,B0007XG3T2,"Fans of Kill Bill should enjoy this, like Kill Bill, the movie is so long that it had to be cut in halves to adjust to the low attention span of the western audience.",1126915200,,166,3.911764705882353
2248669,1,B0007XG3T2,"I've never written a review, but I'm writing this one because this movie is a rip off. STAY AWAY.

On one hand, the movie itself isn't too bad. It's pretty corny, and the story is disjointed. However, this is standard kung fu fare.  The action isn't too bad, and after a while, I started to actually dig the plot. We were looking at a solid three star movie--it really started to pick up the pace, when all of a sudden...the movie ends. Credits roll.

And then the credits roll--with awesome footage, THAT YOU CANNOT SEE!  WHERE IS THE REST OF THE MOVIE? It's worse than the Heidi Bowl! What the heck were the producers thinking?  This movie is a rip-off...stay away.  What little redeeming values were there were absolutely killed by the sudden ending.

Pass pass pass.",1124582400,4,770,4.576642335766423
2248670,3,B0007XG3T2,"Don't get me wrong, Kill Bill is the ****, but come on! Gordon Liu is the Master Killer (one of the best kungfu movies ever made) he's the Drunken Master, he's the Shaolin that challenged an entire ninja clan. To boil his filmography down to ""The Star of Kill Bill"" is just painful.

Anyway, with that out the way, there are just plain better (i.e. older) movies in the genre. There are better stupid movies in the genre (Twins Effect) for example though that's not saying much. I agree with most here, the movie is just ok, the ending is wack (it's not even a well done cliffhanger) but OMG what a tremendous waste of talent in Gordon Liu. Hong Kong has made better films in this genre with less advanced special effects because the movies took themselves seriously in an unbelievable fantasy world by focusing on the characters and their relationships. Heroic Trio, or The Bride with White Hair for example. There was just a time in the 80s and 90s when Hong Kong turned out classic after classic and this could have been one. (But I still give props to Hero, Crouching Tiger and House of Flying Daggers)

Sure Liu's face is fuller, and he's not cut up like he used to be, but he's still got the skills. Ah well, it's still one for the collection because Gordon Liu holds the film together, IMHO, and I'm a Gordon Liu fan for life.

Hopefully Part 2 will redeem it.",1123286400,,1367,4.438247011952191
2248671,2,B0007XG3T2,"Well, this was definitely a kids' movie. It starts out great, and within the first 10 minutes there's a ""Lost Boys Chinese food"" homage and an attack by dozens of undead that is fought off with Kung Fu and magic.

After that, there's a love story, a bunch of arguing between two brothers, and a lot of silly humor. There's nothing scary here and the director cuts too quickly in the fight scenes. My 10-year-old son loved the movie, but it didn't hold my interest at all. I much preferred Ong Bak and Shaolin Soccer to this.

Also, the ending is jarring and kills any momentum the movie had. The sequel might make this better, but it doesn't hold up on its own.",1116374400,4,661,4.365853658536586
2248672,2,B0007XG3T2,"The guy above summed it up pretty good, the only thing he forgtot to mention is it is actually a pretty corny movie. Hopping vampires don't get any stupider, the plot stupid and makes no sense, movie just ends out of the blue. the evil dead are only in the first half of the movie then are gone out of know where. Where they come from or or how they just dissapear is unknown. A very common Japanese flick that makes no sense . i have about 7 or japanese flicks and i would say 2 or 3 of them are ok. But thats just IMO. Please rent b4 you buy, I have brought it just about 3 weeks ago on a $5 bootleg and was a perfect copy , just like it was rented from blockbuster. Never would have known it was bootlegged. Rent first buy never.",1116115200,3,732,3.9527027027027026
2248673,3,B0007XG3T2,"This has all you might expect from a mystical Hong Kong kung fu movie: hopping vampires, big name stars who have the skills to pull off all the spectacular moves you'd expect in a film like this, humour (both earthy and slapstick), good CGI, well done makeup and special effects, romance, weirdness and yes the much hyped exploding zombie midget (granted I have seen far better exploding zombies but I don't think many people have seen an exploding zombie midget so perhaps I don't have anything to compare it with). The film builds, with effective changes of pace, towards an impressive grand finale and then ends.

Abruptly.

And then while you are looking to see if there is a secret button on your DVD remote labelled ""play me the rest of the goddamn movie!!!"" the credits roll.

And to add insult to injury alongside the credits we get silent snippets of the rest of the movie!!

And that all looks better than anything we have yet seen!!!!!!

So what is going on? Well the helpful folks at the US distributors (Tai Seng) have explained it to me. Apparently the producer's plan is to release the film in two parts in the same way Kill Bill was. However, it just doesn't really work as a standalone film (the first part is good but not that good) and just stopping the film half way through with no warning or explanation is quite frankly bizarre and ruins the whole thing.

So what do we recommend? Its tricky as this film does feel like it was shaping up to be a great movie but the ending is so frustrating I worry that it might have spoiled the whole thing for me. So with hindsight I'd much rather have waited for the second half and then watched them both in one (presumably three hour) sitting and probably had a great time but if I'd read a review here advising this would I have taken its advice? I can't say but thats what I'd recommend you do and even if you don't follow the advice at least forewarned is forearmed. ;)

Marks out of 5? Impossible to say really - we'll really only know when the second one comes out. I've given it a 3 because it has lots of promise but......

8053445,3,B0007XG3T2,"Under DVD options one is the sequel, another is the first one. They need to fix this.

Anyways, I fast forwarded most of Ultimate Power since no one could be bothered to dub it like they did the first one. If I want to read I'll get a book. I give the first one three stars. It was a bit corny but I liked it. The sequel gets 0 stars because of the lack of an English dub.",1499040000,,372,3.769230769230769

8053447,2,B0007XG3T2,"I recommend tossing this one. While the movie had all the kung-fu Shaolin bald monks, outlandish Vampires, zombie spirits, and horror schlock, it just couldn't seem to get exciting. Not once did it ever. It's either an incomprehensible DVD or an irritating, inappropriately titled Taoist kung-fu movie.

This movie has no plot, no character development, and really no sense of direction or focus at all. It is a D-Movie plain and simple.

It's like they just stopped shooting the ending.

It was certainly disappointing.",1384819200,,520,5.166666666666667
8053448,4,B0007XG3T2,Not real sure if this was a prequel or a sequel. Gordon Liu is billedas the star and he is not in it very much. If you like the hopping vampire films you might enjoy this.,1355961600,,171,3.7777777777777777
8053449,2,B0007XG3T2,"Title says it all really. This film is more a prequel than a sequel, with what should have been the finale of the first film rather awkwardly tacked on to the last 10 minutes. With some of the continuity from that film to this being really really off, as well as the general feel of the film. While the first movie was all about goofy entertaining action this one tries to make you genuinely care about the relationship of the two main characters. And it really doesn't succeed as you already know them from less serious material, resulting in a jarring change of tone.

Poorly paced and with not half the energy and action of the first film I'd say one might be able to enjoy this if they watched it before the first, stopped when the transition from prequel-to-end-of-first-film starts (about 15 minutes before the end) then watched the first movie and finally finished this. But honestly I'd say just skip this one, it is at most a rental.",1333756800,,942,4.541176470588235

8053452,4,B0007XG3T2,"Ok, first off let me tell you this not a sequel to the previous Shaolin Vs. Evil Dead, this more of a prequel, so we don't get a continuation from the first movie's abrupt ending. I know this will disapoint some, I on the other hand, am an old school kung fu fan, so I felt the abruptness of the film's ending was a tribute to the old Shaw Brothers movies, many starring Gordon Liu, that end as soon as the evil one is vanquished.

Anyhow, this one is better than it's predessor, which I quite liked, less silly and humourus. The story is sharper, more of a story dealing with honour and chivalry, the best stuff in Asian movies, that's is of course, except for martial arts. This one has plenty of the fu, all of it incredibly well cheorographed. The special effects are also awesome, some truely amazing stuff that I haven't seen before. A liitle longer running time alows for more developement, and an ending with more closuer than the earlier effort.

Most of the principle cast returns, but it should be noted that the great Gordon Liu dosen't arrive until the third act. He dose however spend most of it in kung fu action, and he is still the main hero and star. Even if you watch him dubbed, he still oodles with charisma, and makes his appearance worth the wait.",1246838400,7,1270,4.4
8053453,4,B0007XG3T2,I was pleasantly surprised the vampirical look on the DVD cover was not run into the ground with mindless neckbiting.  Definate story told from beginning to end with a bit more meat than can be usual for martial arts films.  I'll have to watch it a second time to fully capture all the nuance.  The jumping zombies are a bit much but different enough from the normal leg dragging gouls we are used to that it seemed to work okay.  I'm sure this is a movie I will rewatch from time to time.,1190764800,4,489,4.225806451612903
8053454,5,B0007XG3T2,"Like many of the other reviewers I wondered what the deal was with the ending of this movie.  It was an abrupt ending leaving me feeling rather shafted.  So I got online to figure it out.  This movie is actually called ""Demon World"".  You can get the full version, however unless you speak or can read Chinese it probably won't be of much help to you (seeing as it doesn't even have English subs).  This movie is awesome!!! I love it!!! I am annoyed that this isn't the full movie, but on the bright side it gives me something to look forward to.  I understand they are milking this film for all it is worth and I will buy the sequel.  I wish the Chinese version had English subtitles!!!  Oh well, I can wait.  All in all this movie is really good and for any Gorden Liu fan it is a must!!!",1129420800,3,790,4.144736842105263
