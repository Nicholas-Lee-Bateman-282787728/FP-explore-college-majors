2550529,4,B000F3UA66,"In a year rife with of litarary films (Capote, Squid & the Whale) it is sad this has been so overlooked. Straight to video with only scattered apearances at fests this film exacts comanding performances from all involved most notably Zooey Deschanel and Will Farell. Adam Rapp's assured direction captures the midwesterner lost in New York as good as I've seen. The dialoge is assured and real. What sort of world do we live in where this film can't get a release but Date Movie gets thousands of screens? I pray this film will find a life on video ala Donnie Darko. Find this movie and see it!",1148083200,7,594,4.5092592592592595
2550530,4,B000F3UA66,"Zooey Deschanel finally nabs a starring role (the only other ""starring"" role I can think of was in ""All the Real Girls"") and proves further that not only is she capable of being funny (Elf, Failure to Launch, The Good Girl, & Eulogy) but she can also be a dramatic actress. It is in this film that she delivers probably her best performance...The movie ""Winter Passing"" is written and directed by Adam Rapp, who shows promise as he's able to show both the vulnerable and animalistic side of his characters. Deschanel plays Reese Holden, an aspiring actress/bartender who lives in New York City. Reese is lost and confused and looks to sex and drugs for comfort.

When a book editor offers her 100,000 dollars to retrieve letters, that were written by her father Don Holden (Ed Harris) and recently deceased mother, she reluctantly returns home. Her father is simalar to the Anthony Hopkin's character in the movie ""Proof"". He's brilliant and slightly off-center. When Reese arrives she discovers that her father is sleeping in the backyard and the garage, while his two roommates inhabit the house. His roommates are Shelly (Amelia Warner) a former student of Don's and Corbit (Deschanel's co-star from Elf, Will Ferrell), an aspiring musician. As Reese tries to stay in the house, while looking for the letters, she also forms bonds with her father as well as Corbit and Shelly. Now for an evaluation on the performances; Ed Harris is good, but is actually in the film for a pretty small amount of time.

Amelia Warner, who I'm pretty sure is new, is really good as Shelly. Zooey Deschanel, as I've already said delivers her best performance and I look forward to seeing her in some more dramatic films. Now, it's time for Will Ferrell who many people have said they can't imagine in a serious role. People get to ahead of themselves, however, because this isn't quite a serious role. It's a dramattic role, but it's played with an off-color goofiness. But, don't get me wrong...This is not a typical Will Ferrell role and he could easily transition from comedy to drama like Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler, Stever Martin, and Tom Hanks have. Anyway, this movie does have it's flaws...It's not perfect, but it is worth watching but just because Will Ferrell is in it. Don't assume it's funny.

GRADE: B+

Side-Note:

For Zooey Deschanel fans; Zooey Deschanel does not appear nude in this film. There is a sex scene, but the only thing visible is her face for the most part. This is the bravest she's gotten with the sexuality factor in a film yet, but it's still not full frontal.",1147824000,4,2575,4.751677852348993
2550531,4,B000F3UA66,"This is a film about relationships.

Reece is offered  a lucrative  sum of money if she can  get her hands on and then sell the letters which her now deceased mother wrote to her father when they were a young couple.

When she finally meets her father he is in a run down home  with two graduate students Corbet and Deidre who seem to be loafters and bums just looking to use the old man for a roof over their heads..

Reece hates this arrangement and wants them out of her fathers' house; which just happens to be her house - although she doesn't know it as yet.

As she reads the letters she realises that what lies in them cannot ever be sold in fact what lies in them chronicles the lives of her parents and explains why this are as they are.",1145232000,5,746,4.131944444444445

Her father played by Ed Harris in a very forgettable role has slided into the abyss of lunacy and essentricity and has as his aides Corbit and Shelly who both have benefitted from being in his presence to varying degrees...both having problems of their own.

2550540,1,B000F3UA66,What a depressing pit of a movie at the end of this fine day. I really wish such movies didn't happen.  It makes me really sad to think of all of the great things I could have watched or read in the time I spent with this movie.  I love these actors but this movie was actually predictable even though it was hard to imagine it getting more boring.,1394064000,2,348,4.028985507246377

It takes place in Michigan and they even mention my hometown on the bus - Traverse City!  I would call it a sleeper that shouldn't get missed!,1388966400,,417,4.048780487804878

Trust me, it will not disappoint no one. Sense the all cast is great. And the actors played so well. I hope you will enjoy this film.",1322697600,,432,4.345679012345679
2550545,5,B000F3UA66,"It's dark and disturbing, even excruciating to watch at times, but it's a form of twisted beauty you hardly see in modern films. 'Winter Passing' is probably the most underrated drama I've seen in years as it rides the coattails of truly sensational acting.

It's the story of a self-destructive actress and bartender living in New York City and on the path to nowhere. When presented with the opportunity to make a small fortune, Reese Holdin journeys back to her home state of Michigan in order to retrieve letters written by her parents, both well known authors. Upon arriving at her childhood home, Reese discovers it occupied by a former student of her father's named Shelley (Amelia Warner) and a Christian guitarist named Corbit (Will Ferrell). Her father, meanwhile, has since moved into the garage and taken to drinking in favor of writing. Mother having recently passed away and estranged from her father for years, Reese finds that before she can walk away with the source of a $100,000 payday, she has to fight the better judgment of her conscience... and finally face her corrupted past.

Zooey Deschanel & Will Farrell team up to play much more somber roles than that of their days in 'Elf', and Ed Harris portrays Don Holdin as if he was a close relative of J.D. Salinger (the author most assume this movie was loosely based on). It's a film that will have you singing the blues, but if you're in the right state of mind, you'll be able to appreciate its subtle honesty and painful journey to self-actualization.
It's real in the sense that a person's motivations are not always for the right reasons, but they can lead you right where you belong; real in the sense that at times it can be boring, but even the most seemingly insignificant moments in our lives can have purpose. It's a realistic display of a broken relationship between father and daughter. There's more pain than joy in the resurrected ""bond"" between Don and Reese Holdin, and though they both made mistakes, you can sympathize with both sides.

A lot of the less than favorable reviews on here talk about the scene with the cat. It didn't bother me any less than the next person, but I do believe it played well into Reese's bitter, detached personality. For positive or negative, that scene certainly did move people. Hopefully some can come to grips with how it fit into the storyline. I don't think the movie should be smitten for that one scene.

* It's worth mentioning that this is the least conventional role I've ever seen Will Ferrell in, and despite his somewhat shy and always neurotic personality as the religious musician, Corbit, he was the only thing close to comic relief in this film. I dare say that it might be the best performance of his career thus far behind only 'Old School' and 'Elf', which may one day be considered among the Y-Generation's classic comedies as it stands.

* Zooey Deschanel is my personal favorite actress (the reason I wanted to see the movie to begin with), and though I haven't seen everything she's been in, I've never seen her in such a rebellious, standoffish role as she was in this movie. Armed with doubts that she could play a convincing Reese, I was proven wrong time and time again. Farrell and Harris were remarkable, but Deschanel made this movie go. Her ability to show vulnerability while maintaining distance between her and the other characters was what made Reese both believable and real. Hats off to Zooey for her performance.

It's not an assault on the senses, nor a thinker of a movie. Take it for what it is. It's a story about four people that find themselves in spending time with each other. Dark, but beautiful.

2550546,5,B000F3UA66,I feel in love with Zooey Deschanel in this movie. She is oddly promiscuous and psychotic. I love the way the story weaves together and the ending is peaceful.,1265500800,,159,4.517241379310345
2550547,1,B000F3UA66,I was horrified to see the Zooey Deschanel character drown a kitten early in the film.  I took out the dvd and threw it in the trash.  Do not watch this film if you have any human feelings.,1262217600,8,189,3.9473684210526314
2550548,2,B000F3UA66,"Mostly annoying, whiney film about a J.D. Salinger-type character and his whiney, entitled, annoying little brat of a daughter. The eccentricities on display just got on my nerves. Will Ferrell is mildly amusing as a weirdo who lives with the crazy author. Nice indie rock soundtrack, though.",1244419200,3,292,5.23404255319149
2550549,4,B000F3UA66,"This was a wonderful movie! It made a great Christmas present for a friend of mine!! I'd recommend it to anyone. Simply because, anyone can relate to this movie.",1229385600,,161,4.586206896551724
2550550,4,B000F3UA66,I thought this movie had interesting characters. It is a little on the dark side of human nature and a relationship between a father and daughter. The actors do a marvelous job in their portrayal of characters. The story line kept my interest throughout.,1213401600,,254,4.795454545454546
2550551,5,B000F3UA66,"I actually first came across this movie by accident one night when searching for movies involving Michigan on my DVR. It came up in the search results as being set in Michigan, so I recorded it just for that reason. I never knew the movie would end up becoming one of the best movies I'd ever seen.

To my knowledge, the first time I had seen anything Zooey Deschenel did was in last year's Sci Fi movie The Tin Man. She was good in that, but her performance there can't hold a candle to her performance in Winter Passing. She plays a the daughter of two authors that grew up in Michigan's Upper Peninsula who sort of just ""left"" home to find her way in New York. After her mom dies, a few events end with her going back to Michigan to see her dad, played by Ed Harris. She's not so shocked to find her dad has become a self-absorbed alcoholic, seemingly giving up on life after the death of his wife.

The movie sort of plays out as a coming of age movie, but from many different (and sometimes odd) angles. Zooey's character seems to not really care about much of anything except the here and now, her dad seems to dwell on the past and emotions between the two are a mish mash of regret, despair, depression and sadness. There may be some love in there, but you have to really dig deep to find it.

Winter Passing is dark... the atmosphere is gloomy and until you get to the end, you won't find yourself laughing too much at anything that goes on. Except for Will Ferrell's character. While not in the film all that much, Ferrell plays a character living with Ed Harris who is at once shy, overly-religious and kind. His character is the one and only comic relief you'll find throughout most of the film, and he plays the part so well, it's s shame he isn't more well known for this part than some of his other roles. If you're reading this and thinking ""Ah, I hatye Will Ferrell's brand of comedy"", don't fret... this is a character I guarentee you've never seen him play before. He's... disturbed, to say the least.

I've seen some people on this forum talk about the cat scene. They are making it out like she just kills the cat for no reason, but she isn't. I won't give it away, but there's TWO different reason she did what she did to the cat. It apparently made an imapct on some cat-loving viewers, so the makers of the movie obviously accomplished what they set out to do.

Like I said, I recorded this movie, but it was so good I bought it. If the beginning of this movie where Zooey's character was in new York had been cut by 10 or so minutes, this would have been a perfect movie. As it is, it still is damn near perfect.",1204848000,2,2637,4.2554890219560875
2550552,2,B000F3UA66,"I thought this was a depressing film.  Ferrell was good, but the character of Resse, her father, and others was so bleak and dreary that it truly made this a miserable evening.  Full stop.",1204329600,,188,4.5
2550553,5,B000F3UA66,"Winter passing is yet another answer from a filmmaker who wishes there could be a film of Catcher in the Rye. I think Sallinger, quite inadvertently, by not allowing his seminal work that generation after generation discovers, to become a film, has inspired far more great cinema that had he just allowed it to happen years ago. Winter Passing is one such film. Had Sallinger allowed Catcher in the Rye to become a film, this work of simple sentimental art wold never have been made. For that I am happy Sallinger has stuck to his guns.

Other films like The Royal Tenenbaums and Finding Forester are two other films that come to mind as great works that fall along the same lines.

Zooey Deschanel, who is my favorite beautiful face out there right now also delivers a great performance. She is a real actress, not just a pretty head. Even her name was probably inspired by Salinger's Franny and Zooey. She was perfect in this film. Will Ferrell also gives a great subdued performance. He is obviously trying to make that transition to drama just as Adam Sander has been attempting. This was a good step in the right direction.

The film is one of those that requires re-watching again and again. It's a pleasure.",1202169600,2,1214,4.637209302325582
2550554,5,B000F3UA66,"This is my first movie review, and I chose this one because I believe it has recieved unfairly poor reviews, even by actual movie critics.  It is a tremendous movie in general.  Strangely engaging and moving, with some excellent performances with all those involved.  Harris and Deschanel are spectacular and Will Ferrell's first (and only as far as i know) performance in a drama was superb.  He plays his character to a tee.  A lonely, subdued, quirky and somewhat strange and random guy.  Still manages to be quite funny in some scenes ie) Talking about his Christian Rock Group, Punching Pilot.  The movie has a very somber and somewhat depressing atmosphere to it.  You feel for these characters, especially Deschanel and come to appreciate the fact that no family is normal and perfect.  We all have our faults and have made mistakes, but love and appreciation for what we have manages to come through.  A refreshing movie if you ask me, and one that needs to be seen and appreciated by more people",1185753600,,1004,4.7514450867052025
2550555,4,B000F3UA66,"Don't watch this movie if you are feeling depressed as it is not a comedy.  It is a beautifully directed and photographed situation drama.  Read the other reviews for the plot line.  If you like really great character development and a bit of complexity, then this movie is for you.  If you like special effects extravaganzas it will put you to sleep.  The acting is about as good as it gets.  Just remember when you see the kitten scene that the kitten has been diagnosed with a fatal disease.",1177200000,,494,4.49438202247191
2550556,4,B000F3UA66,"This film is about learning how to feel, how to deal and how to go on.  It is so painfully beautiful and moving.  It exceeded my expectations, as I thought it might be too artsy, or too deep that I wouldn't understand it till weeks of pondering and deep reflection...but it's not like that at all.  The story line is quite simple, it's about hurting, lost people who come together and care for each other.  Anyone who loves the idea of a tortured writer or actor will love this film.  Plus there is a bit of comic relief courtesy of Will Ferrell's character that I couldn't imagine anyone else playing that role than him.  It starts off a little slow, and does feel rushed at the end, but I think that's probably because by the end I felt somewhat attached to these characters that I didn't want it to end, nonetheless the ending didn't disappoint.  We all have are flaws, realizing this and accepting it is something this film embraces.",1173225600,,937,4.476470588235294
2550557,5,B000F3UA66,"This has got to be the most misunderstood and sadly overlooked movie of the year. It is very deep and heart felt, Dark and moody.

But it is so wonderfully written and acted, that it makes me sad that it didn't get the attention that it so deserved.

For a person who likes action and fast pace, this movie is not for them. But if you like a movie that takes you on a slow moving, thoughtful journey of the heart, this is the movie for you.

Reese (Zooey Deschanel) is the main character, and the daughter of 2 famous writers (her Mothers deceased) and Ed Harris plays her Father.

When offered money for a box of letters that is in her Fathers posession,She makes the trip to visit Dad, and get the letters. (The letters were written between her parents during thier courtship)

Upon her arrival, she discovers that things have changed since she last lived there. Her Dad is mentally ill, and living in the garage, and in the house lives a drifter (Will Ferrell) and a former student of her Dad's(Amella Warner)

As her and her Father start to make a connection, We learn about the other characters, too and come to like them despite thier quirkiness.

As strange as the situation is, We feel this odd mix of people from different walks of life, care about, and totally accept each other, and Reese.

There is a deep sadness that envelopes this whole movie, not only in the characters personalities, and actions, But it carries on to the very scenery (grey and rainy and cold) to the house (crowded, dreary and cheerless)

ALL is not grey though, as the characters have moments of bonding and caring.

This movie really is a masterpiece, and should not be missed if you like movies with depth, because this certainly has it.",1169856000,4,1725,4.517684887459807
2550558,5,B000F3UA66,"You look at this film, especially the cover, and you think quirky comedy.  Will Ferrell's in it, so you know it has to be a comedy.  Well, it is quirky, but Winter Passing is not a comedy; it's actually a pretty bleak, depressing film.  Seemingly by design, the film defies your attempts to get your mind around what is going on.  Reese, the main character, is a complex, bitter young woman who seems about one disappointment away from killing herself.  The kitten scene, which you may have heard of, was especially off-putting to me.  I can see how it fits into the movie as a whole, and it's actually a pretty basic, simple scene, but this animal lover didn't see it coming, found it pretty heartbreaking, and struggled to put it behind me as the story progressed.  Had I known about this one scene, I doubt I would ever have watched this movie.  I'm not trying to turn anyone away from this movie when I say this, though, because this really is an excellent, compelling film.

Great characters make for great films, and Winter Passing has three, almost four, of them.  None of them are exactly normal, though.  The aforementioned Reese (Zooey Deschanel) is a down-and-almost-out actress/barmaid in New York going nowhere fast.  Looking at her, you would never know she was the daughter of two prominent writers, neither of whom she has seen in years.  She didn't even go home for her mother's funeral.  Her father, Don Holden (Ed Harris), is something of a recluse who disappeared from the scene a while back.  Reese really has no plans of ever going home to Michigan again - not until, that is, a literary agency offers her a hundred grand for the letters her parents exchanged early in their relationship.  Reese doesn't exactly jump at the money, initially telling the literary agent to go jump.  Later, though, as she further succumbs to her depression and thinks about how much cocaine and cigarettes a hundred grand would buy, she changes her mind and catches a bus bound for the Wolverine State.

Returning to the home of so many bad childhood memories, she is met at the door by a stranger, a pretty strange stranger in the form of Corbit (Will Ferrell), a quiet and somewhat childlike ""rocker"" who once played in a Christian rock band but now acts as a bodyguard of sorts for her dad.  Shelly (Amelia Warner), a former student of her dad's, also lives there, sort of classing up the joint with her accent and doing the cooking and cleaning for Corbit and Reese's father, who has now taken up residence in the garage out back.  The acclaimed writer (played brilliantly by Ed Harris) is really a broken man: long, unkempt hair, a glass of liquor perpetually in his hand, unwilling or unable to feed or take care of himself, and writing very little.  This whole, bizarre living situation does nothing to improve Reese's outlook on life, which leads to conflict with her father and with Shelly.  It's basically dysfunctionality squared, leading up to some real emotional fireworks after she discovers exactly how her mother died.  Reese originally came to find the set of letters her mother left her, but she ends up staying several days and discovering a lot of more important things about her father and herself.  Some emotional issues do get resolved between the main characters, but this isn't exactly the feel-good movie of the year.  I would not advise anyone to watch this movie if they're already feeling depressed.

I personally think this is an excellent, albeit unconventional, film, and I'm a little surprised that it doesn't have a higher average rating.  Obviously, the film is probably too dark and weird for some people, and others may just be mad because they expected it to be a comedy, but it's really quite a touching film in its own way, and it has a lot to say about life in general.  Will Ferrell, I must say, really shows his acting chops in his out-of-character performance as Corbit, Zooey Deschanel seems to be seizing the troubled young woman reins once wielded by Wynona Rider, and Ed Harris is simply superb in his portrayal of the alcoholic, shambling, broken father.  The atmosphere and flow of the film really fit the conditions and characters, the writer and director never sell out or overexploit the melodrama borne of the characters' relationships, and the ending doesn't overextend itself across the bounds of believability.  Wild Passing is a difficult film to describe; you really have to experience it for yourself.",1168646400,20,4464,4.774739583333333
2550559,4,B000F3UA66,"Although many may find this movie slow moving, it can't be argued that this is a well acted and directed movie.  The story is human and can be felt by anyone who has ever been truly numbed by the hardships of life.  The characters are very real, and you forget that you are watching actors playing a part.  I cried through much of this movie, relating all too well to some of the lonliness and loss.  This is at times funny, but mostly just moving.  Take a chance on this one.",1162684800,2,476,4.186813186813187
2550560,4,B000F3UA66,"Ok, if it was just me, i might have given it 5 stars.  I loved the movie.  I admit, the first 1/2 hour were painful to watch.  My husband said this was the kind of movie he would have walked out on, but stuck with so we could watch it together. He still didn't like it.

But i loved this movie.  I loved the imagery, the way he gives a feel for the harsh life in new york, of people living on the edge crammed right up against those who aren't . . . i love the way i could almost feel the cold, the way it drove me nuts that everyone closed the garage door by putting their hand thru the missing window pane -- in the winter.  Why didn't they patch the darn window?  The scene of her sitting under the tree by the lake, reading the letters.  Without any comment, you know how cold and hard that ground was, but she stayed until it got dark, discovering for the first time the love that was the foundation of the unhappy life she grew up in.  That scene was so intense for me in its silence, and my husband didntget anything from it at all.  My husband said he disliked the cinematography, and i'm not generally one that likes a movie for its cinematography, but i loved this one.

Its not for everyone, but for those who appreciate the depth of silence and don't flinch at real pain, its beautiful.",1160265600,,1298,4.111111111111111
2550561,4,B000F3UA66,"WINTER PASSING is visually beautiful with skillful acting and slow-paced story telling. The lives portrayed are barren as a winter landscape, rife with drug and alcohol abuse, casual sex, self-injury, suicide attempted and suicide succeeded...in their attempts to block out lonliness and disappointment.

These lives are groping towards meaning and find it in the search for a redefinition of family, after Reese's rocky homecoming leads to a measure of reunion and reconciliation.

The ending is a bit too neat after the messiness we've been privy to. But, the film is worth watching and considering for it's complex interactions among the four characters in the Michigan scenes as they search for some new way, any way, out of a hard winter's landscape.

2550562,2,B000F3UA66,"And it had nothing to do with the kitten scene.  I was just so bored with the movie, it was nearly mind numbing.  I had rented the movie and waited for days to watch it.  I was sort of excited, it seemed to me that it would be a good movie, but as I watched I noticed I started looking at imperfections in my walls instead of the television screen.

I was just so bored by the movie.  Then after watching Reese be all jaded for 15 minutes I got to watch her drown a kitten, because she has a drug addiction to pay for, she couldn't dish out some of cash to put down the kitten or just have someone shoot it.

That isn't even my major qualm, the problem with the movie is that Reese is soooo overdone.  She is so obnoxious with her angst and her childlike behavior.  Oh, lets not forget, it's boring.  Did I say that already?

I didn't want to say it, but Will Ferrel played the most interesting character in the whole movie.  He is the only relief in a relentlessly sad movie.  However even that wasn't saving the film.  Sorry, I don't like giving bad ratings, but this time I had to.",1158796800,4,1084,4.104761904761904
2550563,3,B000F3UA66,"Reese hasn't talked to her dad for years. Her mom killed herself several months ago. Both her parents were famous writers a long time ago so I suppose it isn't that surprising when a publicist comes and offers her $100,000 for the letters her mother and father wrote to each other when they were courting.

I love quirky characters. This movie is full of them. Corbit (Will Ferrell) is a Christian guitarist who was recently kicked out of a band called ""Punching Pilate"". He plays the guitar and sings, but can't do both at the same time. He hits golf balls indoors with his friend, the famous writer, Don Holden (Ed Harris). Holden lives in the garage but keeps most of the furniture from the house in the back yard. Shelly (Amelia Warner) it seems does the cooking and laundry. They all three live in a house filled to the brim with books. Reese (Zooey Deschanel) is an aspiring actress who has a drug problem, and kills her kitten because it is diagnosed with leukemia.

I really like Zooey Deschanel. This is the second movie she has been in with Will Ferrell (Elf was the first). She's a good actress. She plays both the emotion and the lack of emotion with equal skill. She has a way of talking that makes her always sound drunk, but she has a very cute and approachable girl-next-door look to her.

I don't know why Ed Harris took this role. It isn't a very meaty part. He did a good job, but it is just a small role I am surprised he was interested in. It's reminiscent of his role as Jackson Pollack, but it's just...much smaller and shabbier.

Will Ferrell is very good in a semi-serious role. I always thought that the best comedic actors could also be the best dramatic actors (Robin Williams, Jim Carrey etc.) Ferrell helps prove my point.

This is a cold, sad story. It reminds me a bit of Garden State. It was written by a playwright and it shows. It isn't bad it's just...stagy. But it is enjoyable; if you have an extra hour and a half some night it might just be worth a look.",1158019200,3,1994,4.392953929539296
2550564,1,B000F3UA66,"I wish I had read the other persons review regarding the kitten killing scene, cause I never would have watched this movie had I known about it.  The central character is obviously flawed emotionally and psychologically, but the viewers do not need that scene to either make or reinforce that point.  I almost believe that someone in Hollywood intentionally added that scene just to try and stir debate/outrage and increase movie/ticket sales.  Since the character had taken the kitten to the vet, which is how she learns about the feline leukemia, then she could have simply asked the vet to euthanize her pet.  She was apparently able to afford the first visit, so she could have afforded a second trip, or I'm sure the vet would have done it for free.  Instead, the character puts it in a gym bag and tosses it in a river...disgusting and not even a good metaphor for her own life, if that's what it was supposed to be.  The scene is never explained and I only bring it up to help prevent others from making the same mistake I did when I watched this movie and 'that' scene.

I struggled to watch the rest of the movie, but I had hoped that the central character would either show some remorse, or at least receive some form of cosmic punishment for her actions, but she basically ends the movie as she began it....a complete waste of space, maybe just a little less greedy (she does bury the letters instead of selling them, after all).

The other characters were eccentric, but only for the sake of eccentricity....unless you believe there really are people out there who can wake up one morning, find a total stranger asleep on their couch, and simply allow them to stay and continue living there.

Don't get me wrong, I like quirky off-beat characters and movies, but only when they are appropriate and believable within the context of the story.

I also can't believe both Ebert AND Roeper liked this movie (that was the main reason I watched it without knowing anything else about it)...maybe they're working on commission now (just kidding)!",1154131200,5,2051,4.6722222222222225
2550565,1,B000F3UA66,"I would like to expand upon and reiterate a previous review's side note advising animal lovers to avoid this film.  Here's why.

Even if you don't particularly care about cats, it is programmed into a lot of people to protect helpless baby animals.  Therefore, seeing a kitten shut into a backpack and tossed into a river like a piece of garbage is more than a little disturbing, or at least it was to me.  There are some things you can't ""unsee"", and I really don't appreciate something like that turning up unexpectedly in a coming-of-age chick flick.  I'm not a PETA fanatic or anything, but I have enough respect for life to be thoroughly disgusted by character development that requires realistic images of animal cruelty, especially when it is being portrayed as a mercy killing (after the diagnosis of feline leukemia).  It would be a real shame if people who watched this movie arrived at the conclusion that drowning animals is an acceptable or humane way to put them down.

Well, that's my two cents.  Hollywood appears to be running out of gimmicks to manufacture drama, which I find pathetic.  If not for this scene, I would have finished, maybe even liked the movie.  I guess I just can't empathize with a protagonist capable of something like that, whatever the reason.",1152316800,6,1283,4.764705882352941
2550566,1,B000F3UA66,"There is only one scene in this movie that keeps it from being a complete waste of your life and that is the bar scene with Will Ferrel.

2550567,4,B000F3UA66,"Though the cover for the DVD of WINTER PASSING (a photo of the four main characters crowded into a box) may make many potential viewers pass over this little film, thinking that it must be silly slapstick, this is a fine film written and directed with finesse and style by Adam Rapp, a new face whose talents have been somewhat limited to working on episodes of the TV series 'The L Word'. Rapp gives notice of a fine writer and an equally fine director in this barely noticed little touching movie.

Reese Holdin (Zooey Deschanel) lives in New York, an actress relegated to small parts in off Broadway theater while spending her days as a bartender hooked on alcohol, drugs and casual sex.  Her life seems dead-ended: she has become anesthetized by her manner of living.  An agent (Amy Madigan) approaches her with an offer to pay her for the letters between her parents, both once famous authors.  Her mother has just died, and Reese didn't attend her funeral, so distant does she feel is her relationship to her past. But the spark of money moves her to ride a bus back to her Michigan home to salvage the letters to sell for publication.

Arriving home she is greeted by the weird Corbit (Will Ferrell), a Christian electric guitar player and composer who ears black eyeliner etc, but does care for Reese's severely alcoholic father - the once famous writer Don Holdin (Ed Harris) who hasn't written a novel in years and lives in the garage of his home under the care of Corbit and an ex-student Shelley (Amelia Warner), a bright very young girl with demons of her own.  Reese works at reconnecting with her father, struggles with her resentment for the 'caregivers', and ultimately finds the letters she came for, only to make discoveries about her dysfunctional family and her father's status that alters her view of his value as her parent.

The movie is rather stagy and most of the action is unspoken, and while that technique of telling this particular story seems exactly right to this viewer, there are some who will feel frustrated at the rather static pace of the film.  Zooey Deschanel once again proves that she is one of our finest actresses on the screen and hopefully this role will bring her to the attention of casting agents and result in our seeing more of this gifted actress in the future.  Ed Harris is superb as the wasted, quietly grieving has-been author, keeping his performance understated and in doing so creating a character that is indelible in our minds long after the movie is over.  Amelia Warner is also a fine little actress and even galumphing Will Ferrell brings more than his usual tiring comedic talents to this touching role.  In all this is a movie that deserves wide attention.  There is more to quietly hear and understand about interpersonal relationships than we would expect from the cover!
