2729552,3,B000MEYKBY,"Apparently, the After Dark films has done a remake of this old movie with a few additions to modernize the effects. The large Angel statue in Crescent View Cemetery is like Richard Paul Evans' Christmas angels now in graveyards across the country. It is somewhat like the 'Christ of the Ozarks' statue in Eureka Springs, Arkansas; by size and detail, the sculptor, Emmet Sullivan, crafted the entire sculpture by hand. With her extra large wings, she also looks like the picture of the guardian angel of the children which hung in my bedroom as a child, and I still have as a memory. Through the years, iit has been modernized like the Morton Salt girl, but the one in the cemetery was old and stately.

The cemetery itselt was very old, for such a preppy trio (two young men and one woman) to break into on the night their friend Devin was buried there. He must have been a suicide victim as he was in the ""undesirables"" section. Drunk on champagne as they give him a grand ""send off"" to the other world, each dances on a different grave. It must have been some type of pagan ritual. It evolked the spirits to take heed of their ineberiated condition and disregard for the rule never to step on a grave.

The girl unknowingly had chosen the resting place of a demented old man who'd been a sexual predator who must have been hanged for his crimes and sins against nature. The married man unwittingly did his drunken dance on the gave of an accomplished pianist who, like Lizzie Borden, had taken an ax and killed her hated step-mother. The other guy chose the worst grave in this undesirables section of the cemetery, a young pre-teen boy who had loved to play with matches who had ended up burning himself and his entire family to death. I've always wondered if Miran accidentally set the fire which killed her when she was only four as she'd told me she couldn't wait to grow up (she talked like a 10-yr-old) so she could smoke like her mother and grandmother. That will always haunt me.

Supernatural happenings started as these ""undead"" ghouls followed the threesome to their homes to cause havoc for one month to find them ""rest for the weary"" (off one of the tombstones). Sammy, a scary cat, fat as a fluff ball, first felt the woman ghost who played Chopin music on the piano out of nowhere. Most of the haunting caused by the grave dancers' lament (a spell, curse of paganism) revolved around him and his wife, even though she had not been present for the grave desecration. Emma was one tough apparition, strong as an ox and looked like Evelyn Hazen.

The three ghouls followed them to their individual homes and caused horrible things to happen until they and some experts in supernatural occurrences dug up their remains and buried them in hallowed ground. They had all died of fright and horror as if they had been buried alive. The assistant had kept their skeletal heads as evidence -- which she never should have done. It was the wrong thing to do.

Of course, the child had been burned to death, but his ""entity"" was active as the Grim Reaper. ""I'm just a memory now. I know you're still angry at what I did, but this is not the time"" was his lament. With God's help, you can overcome your fears and confusion and learn how to forgive and to love again. The audience which almost filled the small theater were mostly college students whose reactions were typical. The movie was enjoyed by all.",1164585600,,3410,4.538211382113821

I'm not trying to rip apart a ""good"" movie. i just truly do not understand. It had a really neat concept, the whole abandoned/haunted amusement park, it had a seemingly decent cast, but the story/editing, is appalling. What could have been something good, went downhill fast into a screaming cliche. The typical partying teens and the outcast they dragged along. You spend a huge majority of this movie in a van, and it's pretty boring. The jokes fell flat and the gore was laughable. I have watched this multiple times, i do own a copy, but i'm not happy, my friend who originally watched it with me gave me a copy he found at a dvd re-sale store. I should probably re-watch it at some point, but it's still firmly ingrained into my memory as ""you had such potential, but you wasted it all""",1444953600,,893,4.418181818181818

2729633,3,B000MEYKBY,"Dark ride is not a particularly original premise.  And it's handled in the usual fashion of slasher flicks, strand a bunch of nitwits in one location then pick them off one by one.  In this case, the dopes in question are trapped in an old amusement park ride that has been closed for many a year due to some deaths involving a crazed lunatic.  Said loony has just escaped from the world's worst asylum, a place that cannot pay the electric bill, where the orderlies routinely slap their patients with hunks of raw meat.  Said loony leaves a mess behind.  Next stop, the amusement park where the dopes are taking up residence for the night on a dare.  It's a setup, just a lame excuse for an ex-girlfriend (Jamie-Lynn Sigler as Cathy) to get even with her ex-boyfriend (David Clayton Rogers as Steve).  Needless to say, there's a double-cross and these nitwits get more than they bargained for.  Everyone run and scream.  The moral of the story: loonies can come in all sizes and shapes; beware the nitwit standing next to you.  (Insert maniacal laughter).

If you like your slasher flicks standardized, this one does the trick.  All the plot points are hit: locked in, no cell phone reception, lights fail (and even when they are on it's DARK), give your killer a mask, weapons of choice, just enough bodies to last the length of the movie, smoke if you've got them, bare your boobs, and above all else leave the suggestion of a possible sequel.  As expected, this movie suffers from familiarity and a cast of unlikable characters (it's impossible to care whether someone lives or dies if they're so darn annoying from the outset).

Otherwise, it's par for the course.

2729639,4,B000MEYKBY,"Not really anything new, but it does the job well and tells a good story.  A great deal of detail went into the spook house itself maybe even a bit too much as the ride seemed really huge and it certainly was creepy.  Some great effects help a great deal and the killer was certainly menacing.  If i do have one complaint it would be the fact that (and i admit i know nothing of carnival rides) it seems that this is a traditional ride in a car that follows tracks... YET i saw NO tracks and it even seemed that in one shot it appered that the car was built on office chair rollers.  It did detract from me watching in the sense that i kept looking at the floor to see if i ever saw any tracks - also if this were a track ride, the scares only pop out when activated, but these seemed to just move whenever, sure it was neat, but most rides i thought only activated when the car was near or triggered them.  I can understand from a safety aspect that you don't want your actors tripping on tracks as that is a hazard and much of the time they use a fog machine to cover the floor with fog.  Other than that the only other thing i could mention is that i basically knew the ending twist midway through the film (basically when they were explaining the history of the ride).  It isn't a bad thing really, but yeah i saw that twist a mile away, but just like the ride itself - you know what you are here to see and they did a good job at it.

 It is a fun ride with some good effects, so grab some popcorn but don't expect any deep thought provoking plot or hidden meaning, it's just here for a fun ride.",1405728000,,1601,4.009433962264151

For those of you who have seen Tobe Hooper's horror movie The Funhouse (1981), well, Dark Ride (2006) is pretty much the same concept, except for a subplot and a twist at the end.  In addition to borrowing from The Funhouse, this movie also borrows from horror movies of the past, such as Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and others.  Watch this movie to see what I mean.  This movie is not an official remake of The Funhouse, but it comes close to being one.

Basically, this movie is about a bunch of stupid, naive, foul-mouthed, horny college kids who get high and are on spring break and decide they want to spend the night in a carnival funhouse in New Orleans called Dark Ride.  Back in 1989, this funhouse attraction was the site of two twin girls' brutal murders.  Now the funhouse is re-opening a decade after the murders.  The murderer from ten years earlier, named Jonah, has escaped from a mental institution and is returning to the Dark Ride funhouse to prey on these college kids.  While the movie is very predictable in parts, it is unpredictable near the end.  I think the pacing is bad.  It is very slow moving for the first two-thirds of the movie.  Everything seems to happen in the last half hour.  The acting is fair at best.  You'll hear lots of foul language, see some breasts, some sex acts, and of course a lot of blood and gore.  I found (as is the case with so many slasher movies) that I didn't care about any of these kids AT ALL.  There's no character development.  They're just shallow characters who are set up to be killed.  One of the girls is a real airhead.  Very typical of slasher movies.  The ending?  Unpredictable.

The props inside the funhouse are cool, definitely on par with the The Funhouse, if not better.  The sound effects throughout the movie were good.

The Funhouse is better than this.  Even though that movie pays homage to Halloween and Psycho at the beginning, it's an original from the imagination of Tobe Hooper.  The Funhouse is the real deal.

Overall, Dark Ride is a pretty good slasher movie.  I give it 3 1/2 stars.  I recommend it if you don't set your expectations too high.",1298937600,2,2169,4.532299741602067
2729646,4,B000MEYKBY,"Dark Ride was a good slasher film as it had all the elements I want in one.
A legend and back story,which they flash back to..A creepy killer who is still human yet horrifying ,bordering on being a monster yet human just the same. Those are my favorite kind of maniacs.
A good premise, it brings to mind an 80's slasher ""The Funhouse"" which I love. Dark Ride started out with great gore effects and that will always reel me in.
The cast was not bad, Jamie-Lynn Sigler being the star..There is a twist which I really can't say I didn't see coming but most people will not. If you want to see a bunch of teens spend the night in a spookhouse/darkride that is closed but has a maniac on the loose killing them off one by one in gruesome fashion then by all means check this out,I remember it was in the first installments of the After Dark Horror fests touted as too horrifying for theaters so I was hyped..I didn't think it was any more gruesome than anything I had seen in a theater before but it was packed with great gore and it was well done.",1297641600,,1044,4.225

What worked back in the 80's because Hooper gave us a very unsettling carnival, works here as well because the theme is dark right from the opening.
I like dark themed horrors because they walk that knife edge of the teen slasher flick and very adult content as in anything can happen.

A while back I read a review by KlownArt on this film, and I remembered that ""hey"" I have that movie. This film actually turned out to be ok, I had heard mixed things about this movie some saying it was great others hating it. So I went into this with an open mind and came out thinking that while it had its moments it was just ok. This film is most definitely a throw back to the days of when the slasher film rained supreme, the 80's. It really does have that old feeling to it and while some may not like that I think it is a plus. But don't come into this thinking this is a classic because it is far from it, to be honest it is not even the best in the ""AFTER DARK"" series. I will say to its credit that it may not be the worst in the series either so expect something that is some were in between. Of course to enjoy it at its full potential go into this movie with absolutely no expectations and you may end up some what entertained, you may even like the film.

A group of friends decide that the time is right for a road trip and all meet up and are off and running. While off on the road they decide to stop off some where were they come across an advertisement for a you guess it ""Dark Ride"", of course they decide to check it out since one of them recognizes the place. It turns out years ago a man went inside of the ride and killed two little girls in a very creative way. With that bit of information they decide that is the next stop along the way, so we are off. While on their way there they happen upon a hitchhiker who happens to be very easy on the eyes, but she is also a little off [absolutely the best scene in the film]. Once she is picked up and wants to go along they make their way there and break into the attraction. It is here that things get a little interesting as it turns out the killer escaped from the asylum and made his way back to the ride. How lucky is he that a group of fresh new victims are at his disposal, was it luck?

The killer in this film to its credit is interesting but you really don't get enough of him, or maybe you do but it doesn't feel that way. Unfortunately that is were the interesting characters stop for the most part, I say that for a reason. The reason being is that at one point or another most of the characters in this film seem interesting, I know that sounds weird but it is true. They either start out interesting but eventually end up annoying or they were just there and developed into something interesting later. That is not to say that the performances were terrible [some were] just the characters were not fully developed, of course this is a slasher flick so maybe I am being a little hard.

Writers Robert Dean Klein and Craig Singer who is also the director really stuck to the basics of a slasher movie, serve up some young bodies to a killer with a knife [or ride in this case]. I guess in that respect they brought a bit of originality to this film but the creative kills are not explored enough. Also it takes a while to even get to the kills and once it does the movie is to quick, once it picks up it is over. And while the ending is pretty cool it is way to obvious as you will guess it right after the first kill. Patrick Renna, Andrea Bogart, and Alex Solowitz turn in some good performances - but see what I said above earlier about the characters of this film. Patrick's ""Bill"" seems to be a good character throughout but remember what I said about the ending?

I will not say that this is a horrible movie and I will not warn anybody not to see this, you may actually like this film because it does have its moments. To be honest I like this film but I would probably not watch it over and over, it is not a classic in my eyes. I think the main reason to see this would be to say ""yes I have seen all the After Dark Horror Fest"", I bought all of them just to own the series.

This movie is average and worth watching but felt cheated since the plot appeared to have been stolen from another slasher. The camera angles could be better during the interior van scenes with the acting being par. This movie was not the best of 2006 nor the worst but again just average.

2729651,3,B000MEYKBY,"Dark Ride
Dark Ride was a part of the After Dark Horror Fest. I was under the impression that these films were supposed to take us where no other horror films have taken us. This, however, is just a generic slasher. I would suggest looking at any of the other Horror Fest movies before this one.

Our cast of characters are a bunch of stereotypical college students. All they care about are drugs and sex. They all seem to have drama going on in their lives, but nothing important to the plot of the movie. Only one character stands out, but he stands out way too much. This makes the ending of the movie extremely obvious.

These students plan on taking a road trip for Spring Break. Along the trail they decide to stay at an abandoned Amusement Park. The Park was shut down twenty years ago after two young twins were brutally murdered. Regardless, they decide to settle down for the night like any normal idiotic person. It just so happens that the killer, named Jonah, has escaped from a mental institution and is on the loose again. Jonah returns to his former killing grounds for some fun.

Dark Ride features a good amount of gore. Only a few moments seem too over the top. Overall I felt the gore factor was just right in this movie. However, check out the deleted scenes for more extreme moments.

Jonah is a fairly interesting character. He is a child stuck in a super human's body. He is supposed to mimic the props he sees on the Dark Ride. However, he usually just slashes the person in an innovative way. The whole gimmick of him trying to mimic the ride only comes into play once or twice throughout the entire movie. One problem I had with the killer was that he had little motive. He just killed for fun. This is a key part of most generic slashers.

There is are a few shocks every now and then. Most of them are cheap though, and involve the Dark Ride props jumping out at you. Johan can be fairly disturbing, but actually came out fairly amusing to me. He always came of as an idiot having sick fun. This actually worked for me though. I doubt it will for everyone.

The ending is also a key part of all generic slashers. There is a huge over the top ending where the killer is finally put down. After this get a surprise ending...that you saw coming the entire movie. They should have put a nice twist at the end.

The extras are pretty good in this one. The commentary track is informative and a fun listen. Their are some worthwhile deleted scenes and a couple making of features. The deleted scenes contain some of the gorier portions of the film.

If you are looking for a quick slasher, you might want to try this one. I feel that there are plenty of better slashers out there though. If you want an After Dark Horror Fest experience, look into some of the other movies.",1219622400,,2796,4.373795761078998
2729652,2,B000MEYKBY,"Nothing new here in plot wise killers escaping from a mental hospital to return to their familiar killing grounds.

The plot is in 1989, two twin teen girls where killed inside a ghost-train kind of ride. The deal was that the guy who owned the ride adopted two sons, one normal and one disfigured. The disfigured one was left in the ride to live, and because he has the brain capacity of a 5 year old, the dummies inside the ride showing them killing and such is what he thinks if life. So he mimics what they're doing because he thinks that is what life is.

After his first kill he is caught and sent to a nut house, now he has escaped and a group of teenagers break in to the theme park that whatshisname has returned to, expecting it to be a bit of fun and you can already guess what happens next.

The plot sounds better then it is, take my word on that. It can be pretty much the same old thing you have seen over and over in horror movies, just this time, its set in an amusement park ride.

The twists and plots of this movie are way too predictable. They do not do a good job of hiding the end result from anyone, I predicted it very easily and did not feel it was even needed to be done for the climax of this film.

About the only thing I did find cool in the movie was the look of the killer who uses a mask from a doll, so it kind of looks like a smiling baby that makes a good costume for these kind of mask wearing psychos.

And a group of college students headed for New Orleans for spring break decide to make a stop in New Jersey to spend the night in the Dark Ride.  But little do they know that the killer son of the person who owns this ride has just escaped from the mental institute and is also staying inside the dark ride.

2729658,2,B000MEYKBY,"Dark Ride (Craig Singer, 2006)

When your big draw is that one of your cast members is Ashley Tisdale's sister, you're probably in big trouble. That said, Jennifer, Ashley's older sister, is marginally less annoying, and the movie, while derivative and schlocky, is not thoroughly unwatchable.

The very thin plot: In 1989, a serial killer was discovered operating in a dark ride (what the rest of the world calls a tunnel of terror) in an amusement park in Asbury Park, NJ, and put in an institution. He breaks out fifteen years later and heads back to his old hunting grounds. On the same night, a group of kids on their way to spring break decide to spend the night in the same dark ride, which is scheduled to reopen three days hence.

The movie suffers from two plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. The first I can't say anything about without revealing some major spoilers, but the second I've already mentioned; how is it that no one figured out that an escaped serial killer would go back to the place where he'd committed his crimes? You'd think there would be a few uniformed people around over and above the security guards. (This would have actually worked in the film's favor, I think, as it would have increased the risk factor for the group of teens breaking into the place to spend the night there.) If things like that will kill your enjoyment of a movie, then you might as well stop reading now; they're there, and they're awful. Now, the many other things that might also kill your enjoyment of this movie. There's the acting, which ranges from mediocre (lead actress Jamie-Lynn Sigler of The Sopranos, whose role consists of either screaming or sleepwalking through her part) to the truly horrific (Alpha Dog's Alex Solowitz, who plays the group's driver, a stoner surfer-dude type; on the plus side, Solowitz is the spitting image of a young Ron Perelman). The special effects are, to put it tactfully, not special. The plot is tissue-paper thin, as it is with most slasher films, but there's not even an inkling of interesting ways to break out of the mold here; this is a straight slasher film of the type that hasn't been fresh since about the first Halloween film. About the only positive thing I can say is that at least, as with the horrible House of Wax remake from a few years ago, both the crew and the ""name"" star were smart enough to keep the most fun murder for said ""name"" star. (It almost takes the cheesiness out of the obligatory bra-flash shot Tisdale has at the beginning of the movie.)

But, despite all this, as long as you turn your brain off, it's not something you'll find yourself actively hating. That doesn't come until afterwards, when you're wondering why you just wasted an hour and a half of your life on it. **",1201564800,,2773,4.595959595959596

So, she fits right in with the other teens in the van.

This has all been done a million times in other similar movies so I don't need to explain all the creative ways the teens die.

One thing that was disappointing was how so much time was devoted to building up suspense, and then when the action/killing segments arrived, there wasn't much movie time left so all the killings happened quite fast.  Like in a matter of 30 minutes.  Some of the deaths were quite disgusting in the way they were extremely bloody and violent while sex acts were taking place.

While the film looked amazing, having all other movies in the set of 8 pale in comparison to its grafic quality, it was quite lacking in almost all other factors. Characters, all of whome you recognize, but don't really know, were in a somewhat stale stereotypical grouping that you'd expect from ANY slasher flick. The story line is rather bland ""look, a somewhat interesting place to stay for the night"", and way too overdone. I'm hearing lots of reviews comparing it to 80's slashers, but i'd say its more like the recent hollywood movies Black Xmas, Hills Have Eyes 2, and See No Evil; which, i guess if you think these movies had complex and compelling story lines, you'll like this, but, much like any movie that runs off from nothing but the gore factor, i didn't. The only scene that really catches my attention is the one where the bad girl is blowing the stud, and has her head cut off half way through, only to have the audience watch blood and semen drip all down the man's lap and onto the floor.

This could very well be the worst.

I had a blast watching this movie and I noticed it kept the interest of the packed theater at the Loews on 42nd street. Most seemed to appreciate the originality and humor of this film which is what a ""real"" slasher movie is all about.

I did find a bit of over-acting by some. Even Jamie Lynn Seigler was not at her best (but she still looked good which is really all that matters in this type of movie).

That girl Andrea Bogart (Hippie Hitchhiker Chick) was a babe. She was perfect for the part, not to mention extremely hot. I'm surprised I haven't seen her in anything else.

There's one guy that reminds me of a cross between Gary Busey, Anthony Michael Hall and Puck (from the real world)- HA! I hate all of those guys individually, but I found this guy funny and non-irritating for some reason. Probably due to great writing I guess.

I congratulate Lions-Gate for taking a chance on movies like this.

Uh, I dunno....Halloween, Friday the 13th, Sorority house massacre, need I go On?  Ok, well the angle on this film is the setting, in an amusement park funhouse.  It quickly becomes cliche in a veritabal you win of slayings.  If you wanted to you could place bets on which one dies next.  At least make some fun out of this so-so slasher film.
Yes this film had gore in it, some of it pretty good. However, because of the enclosed funhouse setting I felt that this film was very boring. However this film adds a scream type angle where someone in the cast is there to add a fine assist to the killers agenda. Not bad, but kind of predictable.

You go to the video store and the horror movies outnumber the other movies 10 to 1. Yet, they're all the same! Here's a bunch of teenagers in a scary situation... chop, chop, nice mask, scream, scream, die, die, oh, he'll be back in the sequel.

Dark Ride though... actually took a step in the right direction. Yes, there's the teenagers, there's the scary situation, there's a pretty nice premise, there's chopping, screaming, dieing and probably a sequel, but the movie has some twists that you may or may not see coming, but at least they tried.

Ultimately though, the movie is nothing new and that's a shame, because it could have been so much more. The premise of the show demanded more attention and more creativity. It needed to be and could have been a cut above the rest and it wasn't. The script could have been more complicated and it wasn't.

There are too many horror movies and that's probably why most of them are so run of the mill. Everything's been done and if you're gonna get more than three stars out of me, you gotta be more creative and more intelligent. The one teenager down, two teenager down format has been worn thin.

DARK RIDE is not a bad movie, it just isn't anything I'm gonna remember longer than say... this Friday... although Andrea Bogart was pretty memorable.",1177286400,5,1400,4.521739130434782
2729682,2,B000MEYKBY,"When I first saw the commercials for HorrorFest, I was quite excited.  I checked out the previews online, and checked back every week or so to see when they would start posting venues, and then dates and times.  When I finally had all the information needed, including MapQuest directions...it all fell flat.  The directions were poor, and so I arrived too late to bother seeing the first movie I had planned to see that night, and the next TWO were completely sold out.  It was three hours until _Reincarnation_ was going to start, so there seemed little reason to bother hanging around the Elizabeth outlet mall.  HorrorFest had become dead to me.

For some reason, I had had no idea that these movies would be released on DVD, but when I did, I thought I might give HorrorFest a second chance.  I had previously found _Reincarnation_ on the eBay gray market, and wasn't thrilled.  So I ordered up the official releases by way of immediate interest, and picked this one up first.

I REALLY hope the others are far better than this one.

This movie intrigued me first because it seemed that there might be a comic element to it--the set-up seemed so cliche (insane killer escapes asylum to return to the spot of his original crimes, just when a group of college kids make a stopover on their way out on Spring Break), that I thought there might be a chance for some fun--over the top violence that might, like _Shaun of the Dead_, both make fun of and pay homage to its genre.

But no.

The humor of _Dark Ride_, if there is indeed humor to this, is thin.  With the prodigious amount of blood and guts and brutality that has already blessed the genre, the bar is now high, and this movie does little to meet that bar.  People are stupid in their usual manner for a horror movie, and the killings neither imaginative or offer any attempt at revulsion, just blood.  I wanted to think that all of this was at least a little cognizant of its typical method, but even the ending twist makes this movie a mere imitation of unimaginative horror, or if it's a parody, it's a parody that is so dull in execution that it is about as boring to watch as the movies it might be parodying.",1176595200,5,2176,4.459595959595959

2729686,3,B000MEYKBY,"I followed this movie's beginnings when there were reports of it on the internet a few years back.  Then, I didn't hear much about the film and wondered what had happened to it.  I guess it had merely been shelved away as it wasn't the type of fare geared for a wide release to theatres.  But then the Horror Fest came along and it was ushered onto the screens and now DVD.

I was mostly interested as it seemed similar to Tobe Hooper's ""The Funhouse"" which I break out for viewing every so often.  There are many similarities and differences.  ""Dark Ride"" adds mystery and subplot that ""The Funhouse"" never achieves.  However, ""The Funhouse"" is more convincing set-wise in causing the viewer to believe that these characters are actually running around a ""dark ride"" attraction.  Either way, I felt that ""Dark Ride"" succeeds on some levels, especially with the sound mix and scenes of gore.  The cast works well together too, and I liked seeing Jamie Lynn of ""Sopranos"" fame in this kind of role.  The mood and lighting were also great, but I had a hard time believing that these kids could so easily find their way into the dark ride with no concept of how to get out.  But, of course, there would be no movie if it weren't for that little plot point.

Dark Ride really plays up the claustrophobic aspect of these characters trapped inside an amusement park attraction.  The dummies and sets strewn throughout the ride are creepy and add greatly to the mood.  Check it out if you find the dark side of carnivals to be entertaining horror fodder.",1175212800,4,1547,4.578181818181818
2729687,5,B000MEYKBY,"To understand these movies is to truly understand what HorrorFest and Movies to Die For IS and IS NOT.

What it IS NOT: It is not a series of extreme or graphic movies that cannot be released to the public by theaters. Some of these are graphic, but not to the point where these were being hidden away from public viewing.

What it IS: HorrorFest is however a great concept from the director of AN AMERICAN HAUNTING who is a huge fan of the horror genre. The director is quoted in Fangoria as saying, ""I was pissed off that there were so many cool and different types of horror films that were made for the big screen, but weren't getting there. I really wanted to create a venue that would at least let some of them [get on the screen] for a limited time. So from that, the idea for the Horrorfest was born.""

So they put the word on the street for people to send their movies to them for a chance to be selected to be part of HorrorFest and have their movie on the big screen. They received about 50 movies in all and so they selected an assortment of different horror themes for the public to see. They are not all one type over the other. They each stand on their own and in my opinion are just great.

Some more than others for sure.

I think DARK RIDE is one of those that is really, really good. Without going into the fine details on the synopsis of the movie, I will tell you briefly it is a throwback to the good ole slasher films, but this one is different where the writer and director went further in character development and creating a wonderful atmosphere.

Yes you have young kids making dumb decisions and getting killed for it, but that's what you expect when you see these movies. No, in real life no one is going to have sex in a creepy house or on a creepy ride, except maybe my friend Bentley, but that's a different story entirely. This movie does what it sets out to do: Introduce us to a wicked killer, bring in the kids, take them towards the DARK RIDE, and scare us along the way. This movie delivers!

And let me tell you...WOW!!! This ride is very creepy. The jolts and shocks came and I recommend if you have 5.1 surround, turn down the lights and crank it up!!! That's what I did and I found myself hearing things all over the room and it was freaking me out!

Most of all I am so glad there is a HorrorFest because I know for myself I do not rent straight-to-dvd horror movies because they typically look lame. Only twice have I been proven wrong and that was with SESSION 9 and DEADBIRDS. HorrorFest gives life to some movies that may have went straight to dvd and never got the publicity it rightly deserved. I hope you take the chance to experience this movie and I highly recommend you seeing UNREST, REINCARNATION, and GRAVEDANCERS as well.

I cant wait until HorrorFest 2007. It's going to be even better!",1175212800,5,2844,4.291044776119403
2729688,3,B000MEYKBY,"""Dark Ride"" is hardly innovative. For that matter, it isn't really all that scary. The jumps are amped up because of the setting (an eerie funhouse) but the scares are not all that frightening. It begins with an interesting premise. Twin girls go into a fun house ride and are offed in grotesque fashion by a man who is out of his mind. Fast forward about 14 years and a group of college aged friends break into the ""Dark Ride"" for a night of cheap fun... only to be terrorized by the same killer who weeks earlier escaped from the mental institution.

The setting provides most of the jump moments as previously mentioned, and the killer is effectively eerie in the manner in which he carries himself. Donning a mask too small for his face, he has an odd child  like quality to him that makes his brutality seem even more disturbing.

Being a slasher flick that has elements from other horror greats like the origonal Texas chainsaw Massacre and Black Christmas, this film has a chilling feel to it but that's really all it has to offer. The acting is average... some of the stars hitting and others missing. The characters they play are a blend between stupid and dumb as intellegence seems to be left at the rides enterance. There are decent kill scenes and others that happen off screen. There is a mildly sexually explicit moment and brief nudity for horror fans who are into that sort of thing. Including the obligatory ""twist"" ending (a twist I picked up on rather early) modern slasher flicks feature these days, this film is  merely average with a couple of jump inducing red herrings and messy gore shots.",1175040000,5,1615,4.597222222222222
2729689,4,B000MEYKBY,"In between screenings of movies at the After Dark Horrorfest (a.k.a ""8 Films 2 Die 4""), when we were discussing the relative merit of the films there was a general consensus that if the distributors (Lionsgate and AfterDark Films) had their druthers, then it would be ""Dark Ride"" that would be their choice for the film to be selected as the best of the fest and get the general release.  That honor when to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Abandoned/dp/B000OY9V9S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Abandoned</a>,"" which was something of a surprise to me, but ""Dark Ride"" would have been a safe choice because studio executives would recognize it as your standard formula horror film circa 1980s (e.g., Tobe Hooper's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Funhouse/dp/B00023P4SS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Funhouse</a>"" came out in 1981).  Of course the heart of the slasher film is to put a bunch of soon to be dead teenagers in a specific location, such as Camp Crystal Lake or a carnival fun house, but one of the hallmarks of the genre in the 1980s was that there was always some story about what happened once upon a time in that particular place and you have to pay attention to it because it not only tells you who the slasher is but also another part of the puzzle that gets revealed at the end as the ""twist.""

One thing to say for this 2006 horror film from director Craig Singer (""Kill Charlie""), is that he is working with much better cameras and film stock than Tobe Hooper was back in ""Funhouse.""  ""Dark Ride"" certainly does not look like a low budget splatter flick from way back when, but it definitely embraces the genre.  Jumping in the van for a road trip to Cleveland are Cathy (Jamie-Lynn Sigler of ""The Sopranos), Bill (Patrick Renna from ""The Sandlot"" and last night's episode of ""Boston Legal""), Steve (David Rogers from ""The Legend of Butch and Sundance""), Jim (Alex Solowitz from ""Never Been Kissed""), and Liz (Jennifer Tisdale from ""The Hillside Strangler"").  Along the way they pick up hitchhiker Jen (Andrea Bogart from ""DarkWolf""), who gives a bit of a harder edge to tonight's dinner menu.  As soon as you see Sigler's name and realize it is the only one your recognize you know who has the heroine's role in ""Dark Ride"" as the good girl (so forget about looking forward to her gruesome death like you did Paris Hilton in ""House of Wax"").  Jen is the bad girl and Liz the cute girl, while Bill is the nerd, Steve the stud, and Jim the mouthy guy, completing the Mouseketeer roll call that makes up tonight's smorgasbord.

On their way to New Orleans the crew are traveling near Ashbury Park New Jersey, where way back in the 1980s (which decade did you expect?) a deformed psycho named Jonah (Dave Warden), brutally murdered a pair of young girls who made the mistake of going on the Dark Ride.  After all these years the Dark Ride is being reopened and given the choice of driving on the Big Easy or breaking into a fun house in the middle of the night, the group picks the latter.  Of course what we know that they do not is that Jonah has just escaped from the mental institution that has held him since he was convicted and now that he is free it is safe to say that he is not going to New Orleans either and that most of these kids are going to end up dead with their blood and guts all over the place.

Actually, ""Dark Ride"" is not particularly gory, because half of the fun here is the anticipation as Jonah goes after each next target.  Then there is also the dark humor that runs throughout the film, which is not really all that great, but it is not laughably bad, always a plus in this genre.  If this movie had been released twenty years ago it would have been one of the slickest splatter flicks around, but that probably means those of us who cut our teeth on the original version of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and flicks like ""I Spit on Your Grave"" and ""Friday the 13th"" are going to be the ones to round up on ""Dark Ride"" while those weaned on the recent remake of ""TCM"" and films like ""Hostel"" and the ""Saw"" trilogy will decide to round down.  All I ask you to bear in mind when you get to the end and Sigler's Cathy does the right thing at the exact right place at the exact right time, that this bit of audacity is par for the course in those 1980s splatter flicks that Singer is emulating here.  Just remember that in such films what happens at the end is not the twist: it is the punch line.",1174435200,31,4525,4.6375

8168251,5,B000MEYKBY,"I love After Dark Horrorfest movies. 'Dark Ride' is an enjoyable horror movie which seems a lot similar to a classic great horror film from The 80s' 'Funhouse'. I am a hardcore horror movie fan and I have been watching since 5 so I like most horror films but I will be honest in this review. The opening scene with the two young girls was poor acting which makes you feel you are in for a bad film which it's not. It's not a classic but enjoyable. Acting in a horror film is very difficult. It's hard to be genuinely scared and convey the real traumatizing effects it is to be stalked by a killer or whatever the circumstance.

  I feel the story was borrowing from Funhouse a bit but I would say it was not a poorly written story. I liked the story. As for the acting and characters and there are moments of bad acting that make it briefly cringe worthy but 3 of the 4 leads give solid performances. I can't say much for David Rogers performance I felt he was one dimensional and there was nothing to his character and he was not likable and he is a jerk but he's not interesting. His acting was poor in all areas.

  Patrick Reena has the juicy part and his an above average job. I wasn't blown away but he did the best acting job he could. He is a very good actor. Jamie Sigler was about on par with Reena in a tie for acting. She gave the best acting performance of the two females. I found her acting believable and felt she had a good character that was not generic.

  Andrea Bogart was not bad at all in her role but Sigler did a lot better than her and that had to do with the bigger part. Bogart did well but I felt her character was more generic. The real surprise here is Alex Solowitz who plays the ladies man, stoner and the cool guy. He seems to be just an airhead lacking braincells but Alex did a great job in conveying fear and horror. I thought for the character he played he could have given a typical undesired performance but he really makes his fear real and makes his character likable when he is not necessarily supposed to be.

  The ending was not bad. If you are a lover of horror films you will enjoy this one. I'd say give it a shot and if you haven't seen Funhouse and are a new or casual horror fan I would check that one out first. Cheers!",1489449600,,2272,4.138636363636364
