4711569,4,B005J5EOCQ,"First let me say that this video is good quality with clear video and good closeups of the AR15. Jim did a fine job of talking through the disassembly and cleaning of the weapon. I guess I was a little disappointed by a few things (hence the loss of a star). First, the disassembly is basically just at a field strip level, and most people are already very familiar with how to do that. He avoids any detailed disassembly such as with the trigger assembly. Also, I thought that his discussion of ammunition was really lacking. Basically, he just said that Federal XM193 is what was used by the military, so it must be good stuff. I shoot XM193, and it works great. I had just hoped for a more detailed discussion of ammunition. Overall, a good video for those just becoming familiar with the AR15.",1356912000,10,797,4.465753424657534
4711570,5,B005J5EOCQ,"""Proper Care, Cleaning, and Feeding of Your AR-15"" is by far the most comprehensive and practical instructional DVD for maintaining an AR/M4 that I have seen. Jim Van Middlesworth is the on-screen ""talent"" and it is clear that he really knows his way around an AR.

This video clearly shows how to strip, clean, and maintain the rifle, with nothing left to the imagination.

4711573,5,B005J5EOCQ,"This DVD for the price is absolutely unbelievable. I'm telling you i didn't know what to expect so i really anticipated that it was going to be ho-hum DVD with about 40 minutes of average information that is readily available on the internet. it's one hours and forty minutes of packed information. From Cleaning, to recommend Spar parts down to the details of Gas Tubes, to extractor Pins with the estimated dollar value. There is a great section on maintenance and where the host explains things clearly and easily and talks about his methodology and approach to why he does the things that he does. It's great whether you are a beginner that has his gun on order and are just getting into the sport of shooting an AR-15 or the Mr. Know IT All on the other end of the spectrum that has everything peaces of tactical gear on the planet and is just looking to by a DVD and pick up one or two new ways of thinking about something and just wants to enjoy a show on their favorite topic of Rifles.

4711587,4,B005J5EOCQ,"Good video.  However some closeup are obscured by hands and fingers.  In the end, the information is presented fully.  Keep a notebook handy to take notes.  Some historical information presented in incorrect regarding the reasons this weapon failed in early deployment in VietNam.  It was not due to the design of the AR-15, that is the M-16 delivered to the military.  The military wanted a ""no-maintenance"" weapon.  They were delivered one.  However, the Pentagon decided to forgo chrome on critical parts of the weapon.  Rather than use the more expensive propellant that Armalite specified, the cheaper and dirtier propellant used in the M-14 was substituted.  These two factors combined to deliver a deadly weapon, deadly to the war fighter.  The weapon was delivered with not cleaning instruction and no cleaning kit.  The M-14 propellant fouled the weapon.  The lack of chrome allowed the weapon to rust in the humid environment of VietNam.  The pentagon soon learned their lesson and regraded the weapon to its original specs.  They also required field striping/cleaning instruction, and cleaning kits.  The AR-15 family of weapons continues to be improved upon and utilized in its various forms by our military!",1422576000,2,1220,5.211340206185567

4711589,5,B005J5EOCQ,"very thorough. it is a LONG @$$ video that walks you through everything, if you are in to ARs then this is for you... make sure you have a couple of hours to watch it.",1416355200,,167,3.8
4711590,3,B005J5EOCQ,"I purchased this DVD used on eBay only because it was selling for $10 (free shipping) but after I finished watching it I realized it's not a big deal because everything on this video is on the internet...plus more. No wonder why the previous owner was selling it so cheap.

Two weeks ago, I purchased my first and only rifle, a brand new M&P15, I had ZERO knowledge of the AR-15 platform but now, two weeks later, I'm 100% confident that I can take my AR completely apart to the last screw and the last pin (if I wanted too) plus I know how to give the right maintenance. I learned and found all answers and videos on the internet: The use of proper tools - Important parts to lubricate - 223/5.56 recommended ammo - How to replace parts, and even how to improve the trigger by polishing it...all of this plus much more is on the internet: Google, YouTube and the AR's Forums.
If you have the basic knowledge on how to search YouTube you will find an answer to each and every question you have and will understand how to replace or install any of the parts. There is tons of excellent, detailed videos that actually ""show"" the work being done on the gun step by step, not just a guy talking and doing a basic field strip like it's shown in this DVD, there's lack of actual demonstration.
Overall, a good video for those just becoming familiar with the AR15 and will like to add this DVD to their collection. It is informative, but again, nothing I can't get of Google or YouTube for free.",1415491200,4,1488,4.35251798561151

I find the DVD as a great introduction since it manages to tell a complete story. Some will find that the DVD is all they need, but I am an old timer and haven't totally changed to paper.

I was hoping that they would show the trigger and hammer assembly take down. There wasn't any of that. most of the video is the gunsmith talking about the gun not actually cleaning it and he uses a brand new gun. The video has some info but for a 2 hour video he should have shown how to clean a dirty firearm. Anything learned on the video can be found in your owners manual, if you don't have one just Google it and the info id free online.
