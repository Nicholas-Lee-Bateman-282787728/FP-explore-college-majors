fan of old movies.
Second,  Margaret O'Brien was a most wonderful child actress,

5731879,5,B00CP6YNSC,I had been waiting for years for this movie to be released onto DVD. Even TCM has not released it. A lovely movie to add to my Christmas collection.,1390608000,,148,4.137931034482759

5731881,5,B00CP6YNSC,"Next to Meet Me In St Louis, this has to be one of the most beautiful Margaret O'Brien vehicles. Even with the stunning Angela Lansbury in the cast, this is O'Brien's film. For anyone not sure, this is the film with the blind man selling newspapers, the fibs mothers tell their children, and the kneeling cow incident. An absolutely lovely movie, really nice to watch at Christmas time.",1382140800,8,386,4.6911764705882355
5731882,5,B00CP6YNSC,"I love this movie, and have been waiting FOREVER for it to come out on either video or DVD.  I am so happy to have it.  It is such a sweet story, and I love pretty much anything MargRet O'Brien is in.",1377388800,8,200,3.738095238095238
5731883,4,B00CP6YNSC,Many old movies containing specifics of codes of conduct or life expectations are often over looked or shunned by modern movie viewers. Too bad for them. Much can be learned on how the world should become agin can be found in these old B&W classics.,1377129600,7,249,4.555555555555555
5731884,5,B00CP6YNSC,This is my all time favorite Christmas movie. I can't say enough good things about it and so happy they put it on DVD!,1376092800,10,118,3.9583333333333335
5731885,5,B00CP6YNSC,"In my search for some new Golden Age classics to add to my holiday viewing schedule, I happily stumbled on this schmaltzy 1948 drama set in Depression era New York.

Nine year old Juvenile Academy Award winner Margaret OBrien carries the day in this heart-tugger about a precocious little girl outgrowing her childhood beliefs in the impoverished Hells Kitchen neighborhood of the 1930s.  OBrien is supported by an able adult cast, not the least of which is a stunning young Angela Lansbury as her Aunt Susan and Rhys Williams as Blind Mac, the kindly owner of the neighborhood newsstand.

This is a sweet, uncomplicated sentimental story, exactly what I look for to while away a winter Saturday afternoon, and the over-acting is kept to a minimum, which helped this film hold up nicely for me.

Tenth Avenue Angel is no Its a Wonderful Life, but if you love schmaltzy B&W classics--anytime of the year but especially around the winter holidaysyou may find this one well worth a watch.",1482710400,4,985,4.845238095238095

8584358,5,B00CP6YNSC,"I loved this movie .One of three Margaret O'Brien  films I got for my Birthday. A child who idolises the people she loves,and then they innocently betray her .Set in the Depression Era, when people had little money in her neighbourhood,Margaret makes them see Happiness in their lives and Hope. Margret and George Murphy were excellent, as was her Mother and the Blind Man. I can't stop thinking about this Movie. Thank you Amazon for making this possible. The print was excellent. Packaging safe and delivery prompt. From Coral. Victoria Australia.",1518048000,,549,5.032967032967033
