8220317,2,B000VWV5II,"Not that helpful. Would have been better to have slow motion action  to show the details on tacking and jibbing. Didn't give enough detail on how to get fast start at start line. Would say that  one boat or another  was  performing a better  maneuver, but didn't say why.  it was too expensive for what you got and you can't resell it on Amazon.",1456790400,,345,4.3125
