7891139,4,6305487790,"The 1999 Simitar Entertanment of this film is pretty good. The trailer is available as a bonus feature...in addition to cast filmographies and bios.
The image is somewhat faded and dark in many spots, but I never saw the VHS release, so I'm not sure if this is an improvement to that release.
However, on the merits of the film alone, I'd recommend seeing this one! On this release, the movie is in fullscreen format. The audio is a standard 2.0...even though the case states otherwise. The movie has a very eerie atmosphere and the cinematography is definitely something to be seen.
The score is beautiful at times and brings alive the region (Greece) in which it takes place. The acting is pretty good from all involved!
This isn't a slasher film...though it has some elements that might lead you to believe that it is! There is hardly any blood either...so this IS NOT for fans of gore films. This is a light thriller that has an interesting premise and a good cast! Overall, I recommend it!",1467331200,,994,4.621468926553672

7891141,4,6305487790,"Wings Hauser gets to menace a particularly rough looking Meg Foster. It's interesting to watch some older horror b-films. Before slashers, horror films had people over the age of 30 in them as the protagonists. The whole cast here is middle aged or more except maybe Wings who only looks to be about mid to late 30s here. Yep, wild man Wings is the most fresh face here. It's like saying Nicolas Cage is the most calm or that squirrel is the least twitchy. It works well in a sense. I got a feeling it all plays into fears of older people. The young rising up to kill them. It's a killer kid movie in a sense. Even better than most killer kid movies like Logan's Run.

Some of the kills here are pretty funny too. A couple are not completely out of the blue but the movie thinks they are which makes it pretty funny. The movie isn't completely self aware. It's a ton of fun.",1460678400,,874,4.233532934131737

7891143,2,6305487790,"While this 2003 version is better color corrected and clearer than the full screen 1999 dvd release, it is just hacked off the top and bottom. (same studio too ""omega"") Like so many hammer films, they take all the trouble to clean up the image, but then put black masking over it and sell it as ""wide screen"". A big waste. All modern wide tv's have a zoom feature that allows you to watch 4x3 video in 16x9 if you wish.  The only way to see all the nice tidbits (especialy actress wardrobe malfunctions etc) is to view a full screen version. (dvd releases that are especialy bad about this are; ""1 million years bc"" with Raquel Welch, and ""Vampire lovers"" with Madeline Smith.  2 good releases are, ""embrace of the vampire"" (alyssa milano) and ""Two Moon Junction"" (sherilyn fenn).  They have both versions on the disk. Though like I said, black masking is worse than useless. The up shot is that there is still no good dvd release of this little gem of a movie.  Too bad.",1255305600,3,971,4.438202247191011
7891144,4,6305487790,"If you like suspense/thriller type movies you'll probably like this one.  I'm writing this review mainly because I wanted to point out that although it's billed as 112 minutes it's actually only 92 minutes, the same length as the original.  However, it does have a number of special features.",1183852800,3,292,4.938775510204081

Grab your favorite movie-viewing blanket, lock your doors, pop some corn, and enjoy this 80's horror flick. It is a flick, after all, not a film. I enjoyed the concept of the movie. Meg Foster, with those eyes and earthy presence, easily retains one's attention.

The plot: Mystery writer travels to a seaside Greek village, rents a castle-turned villa, and prepares to work on her latest novel. Forewarned of the violent, nightly wind by the property's owner, she takes little heed. (If she hadn't ignored his foreshadowing, then we wouldn't have a story, now would we?) A creeped-out psychotic groundskeeper (along with the ominous WIND) sets about torturing her, beginning on the first night.

The ending: Just watch the flick.

My major complaint with ""The Wind"" is that it is rather poorly edited. The director seemed to prefer long shots--or perhaps his budget prefered them! However, these are technical critiques and really matter very little. Meg Foster rocks, as always.

The dvd is way beyond reasonably priced, right here on amazon. For virtually

nothing, you can just buy it and prepare for an interesting, fun time.",1166918400,6,1138,5.0588235294117645
7891146,4,6305487790,"With friends like these..........A murderous rage dwell within more than one character in this film....some in a hurricane force...and in others like a soft gentle festering breeze.

A very good low budget thriller, full of twists and turns. The acting is fairly good. A little wooden in spots, but it doesn't destroy the tension. However, one big plot hole is what made one charcter kill another over a card. The motivation doesn't really jell for me, nor does his flash rage. Where did it come from? Why was he angry over a card to a girl he is just friends with and not really involved with deeper? This is never really explained. Maybe that was one of the links to the title...he emotionally shifts like the wind?

I do reccomend this little thriller. In fact...I will rewatch this several times in the future.",1159056000,,814,4.685314685314685
7891147,4,6305487790,"I haven't seen the DVD, but I have seen the VHS of this, and it is a pretty creepy movie. What I really wanted to comment on was how great the cover art for this DVD is! Wow, a real improvement of the old cover art,  and really, just a great image! I love the little picture of the guy  chasing the girl along the bloody blade. Pretty much fits with the creepy  movie, about an author who struggles to survive a night of unrelenting  terror at the hands of a mad stalker, all set in an isolated castle in  Greece. Great movie, a definite recommendation.",957484800,12,553,4.179245283018868
