375541,5,6301912373,"The events of November 18, 1978, in which 917 people died in a jungle enclave in the South American jungle of Guyana have continued to rivet the world.  How could all these people have been brainwashed into following a man like the Rev. Jim Jones to their eventual doom?  What social and economic conditions could have driven both them and their leader to do what they did?
The riveting 2-part 1980 TV film GUYANA TRAGEDY: THE STORY OF JIM JONES gives us a pretty good idea.  Neither director William A. Graham nor screenwriter Ernest Tidyman could have found anyone better to play Jim Jones than the then-unknown Powers Boothe.  I agree strongly with a previous reviewer who said that Boothe literally BECAME Jones right before our eyes.  It's not a surpise, then, that he should have won an Emmy for his magnetic performance.
The film also features a big-name cast, including Ned Beatty, Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brenda Vaccaro, Brad Dourif, Madge Sinclair, Colleen Dewhurst, and Diane Ladd.  This is a must-see for anyone interested in incredible single events like the nightmare of the Jonestown massacre.",998092800,6,1109,4.935483870967742
375542,4,6301912373,"Powers Booth is incrediable as Jim Jones.  I couldn't take my eyes off it.  In the beginning I felt good about him and could understand why so many were following him.  You could actually watch the transformation into a monster and his power swallowing them up.  This movie is a reminder that these kind of horrors exist out there,even today.  Definitely worth watching. Since I have never seen anything else made about the tragedy, I would say from what I've read, it's pretty accurate. I heard the actual news tape recording of Jim Jones and Powers Booth recreated it for the film ending and it was so realistic it was frightening.  A good history lesson.  Take the time to watch it!",996278400,3,685,4.6115702479338845
375543,4,6301912373,"Although I'd quibble with some muddying of the facts, this film presents an excellent overview of the events leading up to the Jonestown tragedy of 1978.
The film starts with Jones as a child involved in preaching the gospel to anyone who will listen.  The more disturbing aspects of Jones' childhood (including his torture and killing of small animals) are left unexplored.  However, as the film progresses, we do get more of an idea of the sickness of the Reverend Jim Jones.  His drug use, seduction of both male and female parishioners, staged ""healings,"" questionable financial dealings, and vicious public castigation of Temple Members are all given due screen time.
The cast is unbelievable for a TV movie -- Powers Boothe riveting as Jones, Veronica Cartwright excellent as his wife Marceline, as well as James Earl Jones, Colleen Dewhurst, Diane Ladd, Brad Dourif, Ned Beatty, LeVar Burton, Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brenda Vaccaro, and many others.
Despite the film's grainy picture quality, the production values are admirably high as well -- the recreation of Jonestown is frighteningly eerie, and the film features a great score by the always excellent Elmer Bernstein.
Some may not like the compression of facts and events.  Names are changed and characters are switched around. For instance, Tim and Grace Stoen (they are given different names in the film) were not shot at the airstrip in Port Kaituma, nor did Congressman Ryan spend the night at the Jonestown compound.  There are also several key players who seem to be missing in the film: Deborah and Larry Layton, and Caroline and Annie Moore, for instance.
However, the final suicide scene is absolutely harrowing.  The dialogue is taken from the actual tape recording made at the suicide, and the director wisely chose to shoot the scene without any music.  This gives it the feel of a documentary, and it is easily worth watching the entire movie just for this finale.  I cannot imagine anyone being able to watch this scene without tears in their eyes.
Despite its rather free treatment of the facts surrounding the demise of the Peoples Temple, this film contains excellent performances and should be seen by anyone with an interest in this particular tragedy or cults in general.",973209600,54,2255,5.010695187165775
375544,5,6301912373,"I saw this movie a couple of years ago on A&E.  Since I'm a big fan of Boothe, I was thrilled to watch it.  But I didn't expect to see so enthralled over the story.  I watched helpless as his followers, in blind  devotion, catered to his every whim and finally took their own lives.  Boothe's performance definitely deserved him recieving the Emmy Award for  Best Actor.  He literally BECAME Jim Jones.  Even though Jones was an evil  man, you can't help being seduced by him. Guyana Tragedy was a  heartbreaking movie to watch, particularly the suicide scene.  It's not  easy watching, but it gives you insight into the madness of one man and his  followers",957139200,6,658,4.568965517241379
375545,3,6301912373,"The movie was OK but did not stick to the facts. Much of the information was distorted and took away from the actual tragedy. I think a new, made for television mini-series should be made that is at least a week long.  This one rushed through to many major points. It can give you a general  idea of what went on but no specifics other than the end result.

375628,3,6301912373,"This over 3 hour T.V. movie stars a wonderful cast detailing the life, death, and tragedy of Jim Jones.  Powers Boothe gives a mesmerizing performance as the charismatic cult leader.

It shows his southern upbringing and obsession with religion. It also shows his extensive desegregation efforts and civil rights victories. It also shows his sexual temptations with women as well as men. The final scenes are heartbreaking as he put an end to his own city.

This stars many of the greats:  Colleen Dewhurst,  Diane Ladd, Meg Foster, Brad Douriff, Randy Quaid, LaVar Burton, Rosalind Cash, Diana Scarwid, Veronica Cartwright, Ned Beatty, and James Earl Jones in one impressive scene.

No special features other than lots of trailers of old and new cheap films. This film came out in 1980, just less than 2 years after the real life massacre of almost 1000 Americans, the worst tragedy until the events of 9-11-01.

The film transfer is awful. This is a cheap DVD. This film deserves a pristine edition.",1513123200,2,1001,4.9226190476190474
375629,5,6301912373,"RELEASED TO TV IN 1980 and directed by William A. Graham, ""Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones "" chronicles the life of Jim Jones (Powers Boothe) from his childhood in racist rural Indiana to the launching of his church, The Peoples Temple in Indianapolis, to their move to northern California and, eventually, The Peoples Temple Agricultural Project, better known as ""Jonestown"" in northwestern Guyana.  The last act, of course, involves the cults infamous mass suicide and murders, which left 918 people dead.

The movie (a two-part mini-series) shows that Jones started out with good intentions, but his obsession with the social gospel and its inherent socialism (i.e. communism with a smile), as well as his deviation from sound Scriptural hermeneutics, his many adulteries and his increasing drug problem destroyed him and any positive impact his ministry had in the early years. While the movie starts out with some contrived scenes (the black boy in the barber shop), it soon picks up steam and becomes gripping to the dismal, shocking climax. Remember: THIS REALLY HAPPENED.

The picture scores high marks on the female front with Meg Foster and her mind-blowing eyes, curvy blonde Linda Haynes and winsome cutie Diana Scarwid. Veronica Cartwright is also on hand as Jones wife.

ADDITIONAL CAST: Randy Quaid plays Jones accountant, Brad Dourif his drug supplier (physician), Michael C. Gwynne his bodyguard, Colleen Dewhurst his spiritual mentor grandmother and LeVar Burton an increasingly suspicious disciple. James Earl Jones has a glorified cameo as Father Divine. There are numerous others.

THE FILM RUNS 3 hours and 12 minutes and was shot in Atlanta, Georgia, and Dorado & San Juan, Puerto Rico. WRITERS: Ernest Tidyman wrote the script based on Charles A. Krauses eyewitness account of the events; he was a reporter who was traveling with Congressman Leo Ryan (Ned Beatty), who visits Jonestown in the last act.

375755,5,6301912373,"I got my version from Alpha Home Entertainment recently. Bad mistake! The VCI Entertainment release is in my opinion better than this sorry version released by Alpha! I got the VCI DVD from our local library. True this version also has pops and cracks here and there. But the picture did not freeze, it didn't pause and shake at times, like the Alpha version does. The Alpha version, at the end of part one, when they start to sing Amazing Grace, it automatically starts part two scene where the character David is walking up the walk in Jonestown to Jim Jones resting to give him his medication. Alpha where is the end credits to part one, and the opening credits for part two? At least VCI release has the credits at the end of part one and part two. I rather have the VCI release. I will order that from their website. That will do until this movie is re-released and restored, that is if it ever is. This is my opinion also with The Dark Secret Of Harvest Home TV mini series that it, along with Guyana Tragedy deserves a new restored DVD release. So the production companies that made these two excellent made for TV mini series, I say pull it out of the archives and get on the ball restore and release good quality DVD's of these TV movies.

Guyana Tragedy: The Story Of Jim Jones. A riveting awesome movie, even though it's sad that it's based on a true story, is a very chilling portrayal of the religious cult leader. I rate 5 stars but that's only for the movie, not the quality. But again in my opinion the VCI DVD release is better.",1484524800,6,1545,4.364583333333333

My biggest peeve, is that the filmmakers should have filmed in the actual locations. Like San Francisco. Even Guyana cult of the damned filmed it's peoples temple there at least the exterior shots.

I'm not sure if my fascination with the tragedy is because I can't believe people can be that gullible or if it's because I can't believe people can be that evil. Maybe it's both. Either way, I'm glad I finally found it on DVD to add to my collection.

375927,3,6301912373,"Released in 2003. to my surprise.  So many inaccuracies that I thought it must have been made within a month of the real tragedy.  I recently watched a documentary in which several Jonestown survivors were interviewed.  I've read books and done other research on the tragedy since then.  This movie is not accurate about many important facts.  Among other things, the number of people killed at the airport with Rep. Ryan is not correct.  People who were not even there (and may not even be real) were supposedly killed.  Nothing about the several children who escaped into the jungle (and survived) during the shooting was shown.

It also leaves out Leo Ryan's actual speech to the Jonestown crowd and his getting stabbed right before leaving the compound. Other than that though, Powers Boothe was excellent as Jones. I remember seeing this for a course in college about 25 years ago (which might have been the first time I found out about Jones) and I was transfixed.

376188,1,6301912373,"My understanding of Jim Jones was that he was a very charismatic man and preacher, which is why so many followed him blindly and killed themselves and their children.  Powers Boothe does not pull this off at all.  He's flat and emotionless, even when he's trying to show emotion.  It looks like he's trying too hard in this role.  James Earl Jones was good, as he always is, and Veronica Cartwright was surprisingly good in her role, but the rest of the cast was pretty flat, and I didn't expect it to be so bad with such a stellar cast.  The movie itself looks like it was recorded off a TV before the days of cable.  The quality is just terrible.

Now if you can overlook all of this movie's tragic flaws, underneath it all the story is a good one, though it doesn't live up to it's potential.  It just jumps around too much, making it quite choppy and confusing at times.  It's hard for me to believe this is a commercial release because it seems like parts are cut out of it, as if it really were recorded off television.  I'm very, very glad I only paid a penny for this disappointment.  I wish someone would remake this into the potential that it could become.  I know I would purchase this story again if it were redone.  Two thumbs down on this.  I'd give it zero stars if I could, but if you're curious to watch it, then be sure to buy it really cheap, like I did, otherwise it's a waste.  Even a penny is wasted on it!",1373241600,,1428,4.217712177121771
376189,3,6301912373,"Guyana Tragedy The Jim Jones Story(1980) is a solid TV movie. Powers Boothe is really good as Reverend Jim Jones. Levar Burton plays one of the People's Temple members. There's a scene where he gets beaten up for sleeping in church! The music score by the late Elmer Bernstein is solid work. Characters in the movie sing real People's Temple songs!
This TV movie mixes fact with fiction. Jim Jones and Leo Ryan were real people, but some of the characters in the story are caricatures. This TV movie debuted about a year and a half after the real Jonestown Massacre in South America. The TV censors let some material pass such as blood squirting out of people, the ""N word"" and the ""other F word"". Ned Beatty was cast as Congressman Leo Ryan. Beatty is a good actor, but he looked nothing like the real Ryan. Brenda Vaccaro plays a woman who gets duped by Reverend Jim Jones. This TV movie could use some restoration. It's more than 30 years old. The film shows us Jones getting high on hard drugs, seducing women, and torturing people. The script uses real dialouge from the chilling Jonestown Death Tape recorded in 1978. This TV movie is more than 3 hours.

Starts out when he was a boy and how he was into preaching at a young age and goes on in life and ends up in Guyana and the fatal tragedy with the followers he had.

376235,2,6301912373,"Since it looks like Amazon has aggregated reviews for different releases of this film under the same product entry, thought I would clarify what you'll be getting if you order the Alpha Home Entertainment release (this is the DVD with actor Powers Boothe's face in front of a green and white background, and blood-splattered text in the bottom left corner)

First, you should know this is a DVD-R, not a mastered DVD. The transfer IS very poor, however, I have seen worse. It's a washed out, grainy print of a quality comparable to those public domain titles you might pick up at the dollar store. However it does not suffer from the extreme pixelation caused by poor mastering that I've seen on some of those bargain 50-film box sets (where the image sometimes turns into a digital checkerboard). It's a WATCHABLE transfer, and that's about it.

Alpha Video watermarks the print at the beginning for about 5 minutes (their logo appears on the upper right corner) then thankfully goes away for the remainder of the 3-hour running time.

There are some frames missing from the source print and the film skips ahead several seconds here and there, especially noticeable towards the end (I haven't seen the film prior so can't tell you exactly what is missing). This may be the ""skipping"" that other reviewers complain about, as the DVD itself did not skip and played just fine... just missing footage in the source print.",1361750400,,1419,4.807377049180328

However, do not let that deter you from getting this movie. It is very watchable. Aside from image sharpness, there were no other problems with the DVD I purchased. It's possible that earlier DVDs had some issues that have since been resolved. On the other hand, I think HD television has spoiled some people, giving them little tolerance for things that don't rise to those standards. Don't buy this expecting anything remotely close to a high-def picture.

In this movie, Powers Boothe gives a compelling performance in this life-is-stranger-than-fiction account of Jim Jones and the tragic unfolding of events at the People's Temple in Guyana. Boothe actually bears a close resemblance to Jones, which makes it all the more realistic. It's a horrifying and cautionary tale of cults and how they operate, how followers can gradually give up their personal freedom in the name of religion and end up imprisoned mentally--and, this extreme case, eventually physically.

I've seen this movie multiple times over the years since it first came out and it's never lost it's power for me. I give 5 stars for the movie itself and 3 stars for the DVD. Averaging the two, I give it a 4-star rating overall.",1338940800,,1433,4.864754098360656

My only complaint is with the quality of the DVD. Nothing has been digitally remastered. It's as if a novice recorded the TV-run program onto a DVD. The colors are faded and the sound slightly muted. There are white streaks and snow throughout.

To this day you might here someone say something like ""He's drinking the purple Kool-Aid"" when talking about a blind following of another person's sayings or teachings.

This might be the reason the Kool-Aid man is red and not purple. You have to feel sorry for Kool-Aid. It wasn't even their product in the movie or real life!

Made for TV in the late 70s early 80s three-channel days was in many ways much less restrictive that it is today. The N-word and F-word (the three-letter one) are used in serious context several times.

This was a powerful TV broadcast in its time. Right up there with ""Roots"". Powers Boothe looked exactly like the real Jim Jones when he put those sun glasses on.

Had Powers Boothe chosen to use his powers for evil instead of good he could have had the same cult church following. To say Powers Boothe was convincing in the role of Jim Jones is an understatement. He was Jim Jones. Boothe won an Emmy Award for this. He deserved to win every TV and movie award out there.

I was a child then and didn't understand much but do remember this storyline being quite chilling. Now many years later I've taken a renewed interest in this story. I've been listening lately to live audio of Jones' sermons and recordings as well as archival footage.
What I don't care much about this movie is the fact that Boothe has no physical resemblance or personality of Jones. I don't think he was the better actor for this role. Also, as stated above, I have been listening to audio and I can tell that there are some discrepancies like words being put in and taken out of the mouths of the people who were actually there. It was quite confusing. For one small instance, it was a trusted male advisor and employee of Jones (McElvane???) who said to Christine Miller moments before the killings, ""It's over sister. We've made that day and let's make it a beautiful day.""  Yet the movie shows a woman as actually saying that and it was when they were having a meeting/dinner but not necessarily around the suicides. Maybe this is what you get with made for tv movies.

Powers Boothe, while he doesn't necessarily look or sound like the real deal, captures the darkness of Jim Jones' persona. The film begins in Jonestown with a mock ""loyalty test"" after which Jones, tormented, takes a trip down memory lane. We see his childhood, during which he frequented church services, conducted pet funeral services with childhood friends, witnessed the abusive nature of his parents' relationship(his murder and torture of small animals was left untouched). We witness his becoming a pastor, the first pastor to conduct integrated services in Indianapolis,IN,his marriage, and ultimately, after the success of the People's Temple as a congregation and humanitarian effort, we see his moral and mental decline:drug usage, bisexual affairs, pro-claiming himself divine, physical/verbal abuse of members, all culminating in Jonestown,Guyana with the murder/suicide of nearly 1,000 People's Temple members, Congressman Leo J. Ryan and others. As with many other docudramas, there are a few changes of identity & fact to protect the innocent(and to captivate the audience via dramitization.

He actually had his followers believing he WAS God.

People's Temple attracted all types of folks: the poor, homeless, drug and alcohol addicted, ex-cons, disenchanted Vietnam veterans, young, old, of all racial and ethnic backgrounds, and those who simply were left behind by society as a whole, had no genetic family ties and just didn't fit in anywhere else. In this, they found friendship, peace and perhaps a security that they weren't able to find in the outside world. The followers of Jones' People's Temple lived amongst each other in a sort of Utopian society, and in the beginning the formation of the church had the best of intentions. However, as the saying goes, ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions.""

The screenplay itself draws a great deal from the actual events and news accounts. But the DVD is terrible!

376475,1,6301912373,"Finally VCI Home Video has released Guyana Tragedy on DVD. Months ago we were promised a remastered copy with improved picture and sound. Even the above poster states that this has been fully restored and remastered. But, sadly it has not. For a film that was only made in 1980, I can't believe that a film would have picture quality that is this bad. Honestly the quality of the picture is that of a bootleg, and its even worse than Reel Enterprises version of the film. The video jumps from time to time, it's murky and the sound is like something from a 1930's film.

Shame on VCI for bringing out a title that is this bad. My goodness, how hard is it to clean up the picture a bit? They have really dropped the ball with this release, and because of the extremely poor quality, I will re-think purchasing any further VCI titles. Avoid at all costs!",1185321600,29,852,4.3924050632911396
376476,4,6301912373,"99% of ""made for TV"" movies are garbage, not so much because of plots or third-rate actors but low-production and low monetary funds are a major factor...there are a few exceptions, for example Wolfgang Petersen's Das Boot was originally released as a mini-series on German television that took several nights to be shown and after being shortened and shown in theatres worldwide it has become an all-time classic war film.  I saw Guyana Tragedy as a child and though I was alive when the Jonestown massacre took place I don't remember hearing about it and this film was where I was first exposed to the horrors that took place there, and this film though being a TV movie has always been a favorite. The rarely seen Powers Booth as always is outstanding and is totally posessed by Rev. Jim in this role, if you've actually seen footage of the real Jones the two men are literally one in the same. The movie's long at 4 hours and two videotapes, originally shown over two nights on one of the networks, but it's one of those films that grabs you from the get-go and won't let go. To my knowledge it's never been released on DVD and I haven't seen it re-aired on television in quite some time so pick up one of the used VHS copies if you can find one (I later recorded it onto a DVD-R). The film is also a useful tool to show to those obnoxious Che Guevara t-shirt wearing Sociology grad students/wannabe anarchists still living in their parent's basement to show what a miserable failure Marxism has always been.",1177718400,3,1512,4.538461538461538
376477,2,6301912373,"While the movie itself is very well done, the audio and video quality of this particular brand is awful, almost unwatchable.  I had recorded this movie from tv with a cheap tape (recording over something else) and a VCR on its last leg and the quality was much better than this.  I hope this movie is released on DVD in the future and digitally remastered.  Don't waste your money on the VCI version of this movie.",1176249600,,414,4.421052631578948
376508,3,6301912373,"The video is great, except for the poor video and sound quality.  I wish they'd put out a DVD version with clearer video and sound.",1172620800,2,131,4.24
376509,5,6301912373,"This film is powerful, simplly put.  Powers Boothe gives a dynamic performance as Jim Jones, one which won him an Emmy.  The film was made for television, and premiered not long after the actual event.  The film is presented in two parts, and its structure puts us in the role of Jones follower.  In the first half, Jones is a likable guy, despite some obvious flaws.  He is a powerful speaker, and he opens up the church to people in the community who had previously been excluded (blacks, the poor, etc.).  When he is booted out of the church for this, he opens one of his own, the People's Temple, in a section of Indianapolis.  His people love him, and he uses that love to further his ambition.  He moves the Temple to California.  The first half ends on a note of doom, as Jones presents his ""vision"" of nuclear apocalypse, telling his people that he is the only one who can save them.

Part two is the fall.  Things get ugly fast.  Jones gains power rapidly, both among his people and in Bay Area politics.  He eventually moves the Temple to Guyana and, well, we all know what happened after that.  Even at more than three hours long, GUYANA TRAGEDY is so compelling that the time is hardly noticed.  The story is gripping, and to think that it actually happened makes it all the more so.  Much of Jones' final speech comes from actual transcripts.  Boothe gives a performance that may be his best ever.  The film is worth watching just for him.

This needs to be on DVD.  Even by VHS standards, the video and audio quality is below average.  It would be nice to see a cleaned up version of this with some bonus material.",1171324800,3,1628,4.395973154362416

376511,5,6301912373,"This is one of the best TV 'movie of the week' films ever made. But, it's misleading and can only give its viewers limited information. It was only a two-part mini-series. And it had many of the best character actors and actresses of TV and movies. Powers Booth was an excellent choice for the role of Preacher Jones. Jim Jones' family went from the bluegrass of Kentucky into the concrete jungle of Gary,Indiana. The only good thing about Jim(Kleindienst)Jones was that he saw the basic human need for racial equality and social justice. Some of the Dixie Dregs embraced the Hoosier Republican Klan politics of racial seperation. Jim Jones fought against the Jim Crow laws. Jim Jones the Egotist believed he was the reincarnation of Jesus the Bellwether leading his flock to paradise. Jones was as slick and as glib as 'Old Scratch'.He turned out to be a vain demagogue of destruction and a false phophet spreading lies to his brethen. Jones was the strangest janiform cult figure,of modern history. In 1972,Jim Jones and actor Robert Clary(of Hogan's Heroes fame)were booked for 'indecent exposure and lewd acts' after being arrested at a midnight show in a porn theatre. Jones believed that a nuclear holocaust was coming and Guyana was the only place where their paradise would survive and flourish. Christianity is the opium of the masses,and Jim Jones was the main peddler of cherubic pipe dreams.",1168646400,3,1403,4.9491525423728815
376512,4,6301912373,"The Jonestown tragedy had previously been made into the exploitation film ""Guyana - Crime of the Century"". However, this TV production, with a running time of about three hours gives a better  understanding of how it could happen. The story starts when Jim Jones is a child, being indoctrinated by a Christian fundamentalist friend. He starts the integrated People's Temple Church after discovering how racist the established churches in San Francisco are. He really wants to do something good for the community and he does, but power corrupts and the church turns into more of a money making cult and Jones turns into a cruel leader. His drug use and paranoia doesn't make things better. After moving to Guyana, Jones has complete control over his folloers, and with him as a leader, Jonestown is headed for destruction.

This gives a good understanding of the events, and what it might have been like for the people involved. The mass suicide sequence is reconstructed almost completely the way it happened, based on tape recordings. As a piece of trivia, the gospel songs performed by the People's Temple Choir are recordings of the actual choir.

I certainly recommend this film to those interested in the Jonestown story, destructive cults, or 1970s history in general.",1151712000,8,1274,5.028436018957346

376514,2,6301912373,"Powers Boothe, while obviously talented and provided a strong character, he did not capture the real Jim Jones in any sense.  This movie is so full of inaccuracies that it is not worth viewing to obtain any true information regarding the Peoples Temple movement. I would recommend some of the documentaries such as Purple Haze or the A & E Biography of Jim Jones-Journey into Madness.  I found this motion picture misleading and almost total fiction as I know many, many family members and survivors of Peoples Temple and have written/researched Peoples Temple extensively.",1094774400,12,573,5.085106382978723

376516,3,6301912373,"This film is masterfully done and will grab the viewer's attention from the beginning. Boothe does an excellent job of portraying Jones. Though the film has great artistic merit and portrays an overall sense of the life of the People's Temple, it fails to convey the true roots of madness that became the driving force of the Jonestown cult. For a better overall survey of Jones' theological presuppositions and personal history, I would highly recommend a reading of David Chidester's book, Salvation and Suicide. Also recommended is the audio broadcast ""The Last Days of Jonestown,"" available from National Public Radio.",1052006400,5,622,5.23
