8424895,5,B004D7SBHU,"Absolutely excellent dvd! This dvd was very informative and does a great job of explaining earthquake concepts that relate to STCM curriculum kits. It is especially beneficial for students who reside in the Pacific Northwest. Excellent coverage on the possibilities of a future disaster happening. I highly recommend this dvd! Superb job NOVA, and Thank You!!!",1353369600,,360,5.446428571428571
8424896,2,B004D7SBHU,"I learned a few new things in this documentary - mainly the Japanese researcher who's come up with a way to create a 3D image of a volcano's internal structure using muons generated by cosmic rays decaying when they strike the Earth's atmosphere. Cool! But aside from that, the informative content was rather low - more akin to something one would see on the Discovery Channel than the once-great Nova series (no offense to the DSC). The rest of the doc was repetitious and the narrative a bit dumbed-down and hyperbolic. All those flaws were magnified by the over-the-top melodramatic music. Really awful. I'd feel my intelligence was insulted if I were a high school kid, much less an adult.

NOVA, please stop trying to out Discovery Channel the Discovery Channel. You will lose that battle, as well as what used to be your other core audience - intelligent, scientifically literate viewers.",1326412800,2,894,4.881578947368421
