8136961,5,B000H6SXLA,Great poetry reading! I remember it on ETV in the 60s.,1518998400,,54,4.0

8136963,5,B000H6SXLA,"This is a re-issue of poetry readings originally done on PBS in the late 1970s under the title ""Anyone for Tennyson?"" There are four regulars, based at the University of Nebraska, supplemented by ""guest"" readers drawn from stage, movie, and television actors. Some of these guests give performances that are, frankly, poor. But on the whole, this is worth having and watching.",1465862400,2,376,5.080645161290323
8136964,4,B000H6SXLA,"A few of the readings and performances in this collection may seem a bit strained or artificial, but others are riveting. All in all, an excellent collection and reminder of the treasure trove of riches to be found in the great poetry of the English language. I watched entranced during most of the performances. Those who love poetry should really enjoy these CDs.",1375574400,3,365,4.809523809523809
