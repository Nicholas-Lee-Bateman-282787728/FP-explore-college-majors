8025034,2,B0002AAOXG,"There have been many film versions of Robin Hood -- ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (the best of them all), ""The Story of Robin Hood"" and ""A Challenge for Robin Hood"" (both quite fine), ""Rogues of Sherwood Forest"", ""Men of Sherwood Forest"", ""The Sword of Sherwood Forest"", ""The Bandit of Sherwood Forest"", and ""Prince of Thieves"" among them.  ""Tales of Robin Hood"" may well be the least of them all.  This 60-minute movie is slow, dull, and cheaply-made.  The acting is fairly terrible.  Also, the quality of the transfer on this VHS tape is pretty bad.  The picture is soft and, worst of all, badly cropped on all sides such that even the main title essentially reads: ""ales of Robin Hoo"".  Buy this film only if you're a Robin Hood or swashbuckler completest -- which I guess I am!",1413072000,,782,4.589928057553957
