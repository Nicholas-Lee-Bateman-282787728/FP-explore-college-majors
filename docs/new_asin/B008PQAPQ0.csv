8529549,2,B008PQAPQ0,I'm an avid collector of these sorts of collections but I must say this one is pretty weak. Once you've watched the first dvd the other two are pretty much the same thing. With that said the first dvd is fairly well done. It has interesting stories and historical points. I especially like the parts where they get a musician to play parts of famous Genesis songs on keyboards or guitar to show their uniqueness.  So with that said this is not a must own. In fact if you can find the first dvd somewhere on it's own I would buy that instead.,1424390400,3,541,4.252427184466019
