6648696,5,B00NFYCJNY,"I went into this with vague memories of seeing some of it at my aunt and uncle's swag 70's pad when I was a kid.  They had cable and HBO--my uncle was a stoner, and so there were a lot of reasons for me to want to hang at their place.  They were the COOLEST CATS I knew!  He also had a great stash of porn magazines.  lol

At any rate, there are enough reviews on here for this for me to just say what a totally ASTOUNDING find it is.  I love music, and my taste is all over the place 50's, 60's, 70's, hell, every decade, I'm in!!  What I HATE about ""live"" musical performances is lip sync and air guitar--it really ruins the whole thing for me with very few exceptions (ok, sometimes I do cut someone some slack if they are dancing up a storm, doing acrobatics, etc, but they STILL have to look like their lips are moving to the words.  Michael Jackson was so bad at lip syncing that even the Motown 25 performance that catapulted him to superstardom is hard for me to watch.  It is a great irony that that particular ""performance"" was what REALLY made him a superstar.  It's a great DANCE performance to a recording of great hit song that he happened to write, and there is still magic in it, but it feels like eMpTV to me when I see performances like that, but I digress.

Almost every single performance on the collections of The Midnight Hour that I've bought  is a LIVE, FOR REAL performance, i.e. they are actually SINGING, PLAYING, etc.  Watching them game me pause.  There are songs on here that I've never particularly been a fan of, but that I found thrilling, engrossing, and enthralling to watch live.  The artistry, the fashion of the times, seeing so many solo artists of later years whom I loved, but whom I never knew were in some of these bands before going on to their solo careers, and becoming stars on their own are all fascinating and mesmerizing.  If you watch closely, you can get quite a great education on the family tree of music.  I watch these over and over again, and send them to every fellow music lover and soundphile I know for occasions.  I have blown many a mind with these.  ""Nuff said.",1433980800,,2125,4.293969849246231

6648702,5,B00NFYCJNY,"It is what I was looking for, a trip to the past. The Midnight Special was one of my favorite shoes in the seventies. The bands played live and the fashions were outrageous.",1425859200,,173,4.2727272727272725
6648703,5,B00NFYCJNY,"Man, I was confused beyond belief about how I'm gonna approach purchasing this collection. There are like five different packaging's of this special sound history of our past. Now, I have seen individual releases year by year, which looked cool, but were rather expensive if I decided to buy one, and then another, and then another, and so on.

But, just recently, I see that Time-Life has just released a box set of mixing up all these video clips of many pop favorites, as well as one hit wonders performing their hits on stage on the show.

Through Amazon, I just recently seen that they have a box set.  Two actually. A 6 DVD set for about 35 dollars, or the 6 DVD set plus a bonus DVD (being 7 DVD's) for just above forty dollars. I almost ordered that one, but I still noticed that alot of performances were still missing that I have seen on YouTube, so, I hesitated before I bought anything.

Then, I decided to go right to the source. I found a Time-Life Music and DVD website, and there I found that they are also selling two different box sets of the ""Midnight Special"". One 11 DVD version for about 99 bucks, or a much more serious 20 DVD collection for nearly 200 dollars.

Oh Geez, what do I do? Well, I looked at the contents, disc per disc, to see if I really wanted to go for the whole she-bang. What I discovered was that I appreciate the tightness of the 11 DVD version although it did look like they had a few DVD's of just interviews with some artists from the seventies. I don't know. I guess that could be interesting. But, the 20 DVD version had, of course, more live performances by familiar artists, but many of the songs selections weren't all that familiar to me. So, to me, for the value.  I think that the 11 DVD version is just fine for me. Especially because it has the performance of ""Play That Funky Music"" by Wild Cherry.  That was important to me, and maybe even the deciding factor as to why I chose the 11 DVD version though Time-Life, instead of the 7 DVD version Time-Life sells through Amazon.

So, if you are into collecting the DVD's of the ""Midnight Special"", do some research.  Look into what may be a value to you for your money.

The one thing that is so great about the ""Midnight Special"" is that, unlike the ""American Bandstand"", Burt Sugarman says that his performers must play ""live"", and not lip-sync their recordings.  That made it so much more special. And I love how artists that host the show and perform as well, all seem to show so much respect for each other, even though their music is so much more different than theirs. All the various artists of the 70's all seem to represent themselves as one great big family. I love the warmth that is omnipresent of all these performers being together. I've listened to these songs for years through Rhino and Time-Life Records.  But, now, it's wonderful to see them performing their hit records even before they were released on the radio. What a fabulous show.  You get the best songs and live performances from 1972 to 1981. This is the best music experience I have ever bought on DVD.  If you love all that diversity of pop music of the 1970's, you need to get this collection.

Now, my next venture will be is how do I want to purchase Time-Life's various ""Soul Train"" collections?",1425772800,66,3286,4.4352159468438535

6648709,5,B00NFYCJNY,"This set brought back countless great memories from my college years, and time working at a local State Park on a lake.  Every weekend I'd stay up late, just to catch this show.  While watching it I was reminded how absolutely amazing that period was for music.  One minute you'd have the likes of my favorite Folk/Pop performer John Denver and the next you'd be rockin' down to Aerosmith.  It just doesn't get any better than The Midnight Special.  If you want a great trip down Memory Lane, this is the collection to get.  I'm only sorry I didn't know about it until recently, wasted many a year of enjoying it.",1423008000,,613,4.4774774774774775

There are many good, rare performances, though.

6648716,4,B00NFYCJNY,"We are really enjoying this set; wife is a little disappointed, no Steely Dan as stated in Editorial Review; I was hoping for classic REO as claimed but no-show there also. I'm not as disappointed because ""Keep on Loving You"" is the REO offering (on another set); not a favorite. These and many others are on the 16-disc and deluxe 20-disc sets offered by Time Life. It's far from a deal breaker for us, but I would look closely at Paul Wegner's ""track listing for all 7 discs"", here in Customer Reviews so you see all of what you are getting.",1420588800,6,543,4.3861386138613865

6648719,4,B00NFYCJNY,"I'm old enough to remember having watched ""The Midnight Special"" when it was originally on in the 1970's.  The shows were 90 minutes long.  Each show on these discs is roughly 20 minutes long so they are extremely edited.  What you're left with is still highly entertaining and worth owning if you are a music fan from this period.  Just don't go in expecting the full-length program.  Also, you have the bonus of seeing some truly cringe-worthy 70's fashions, which are good for a laugh!",1420243200,,488,4.694117647058824

6648726,4,B00NFYCJNY,"This is quite enjoyable even though you probably won't like everything and will be disappointed because some artists didn't make the cut. You could gauge when the show took a dive during the late 70's when the emphasis was on the ""dancing"" audience and the music was a soundtrack for the dancers. Sad seeing Blondie lip sync Heart Of Glass amidst the disco balls hanging overhead. Can we have a volume two with Cheap Trick,King Crimson,PFM,Strawbs...etc?Worth it for the nostalgia of my youth.",1419206400,9,493,4.951807228915663

6648732,4,B00NFYCJNY,"The seven (7) disc version of the Midnight Special DVD box set is the one that is available at Costco as I write this review (Nov 2014, and the DVDs were available at Costco at the end of September)  it differs from the 6 disc version in that theres an extra disc with 15 more songs.  Im a bit too young to have seen these when they were originally broadcast, so its great to have some of these performances available, as they capture artists & bands when they were quite young and in their prime, when these were new songs.  Theres a good mix of at-the-time-young, now  Classic rock/established artists (ELO, Tom Petty, Linda Ronstadt, The Cars) alongside some one-hit (or maybe two-hit) wonders (like Redbone, Rupert Holmes and Maria Muldaur).  The overwhelming majority of the artists on the set will be instantly recognizable to anyone over the age of like 40.  Anyone under 40 should probably still see this as theres a ton of great stuff here that puts a lot of todays music to shame, and they really should know who Wolfman Jack was (hes a bit more interesting than Ryan Seacrest).  My only real criticism of the set is that the shows themselves are not complete, which might be due to a desire to fit a more-diverse group of acts onto the set, but also because the discs are really not that long  only around an hour-twenty for several of them.  They really couldve either done this with fewer discs, or put more material on each disc  some of the show excerpts run only 10 or 15 minutes, but they felt a (somewhat annoying) need to run the complete closing credits for the show after each mini-set, which burns up disc time.  Im sure licensing issues also probably affected getting certain artists, but for whats here, it should jog some pleasant memories of a very heady decade (and there are some good mini-interviews of artists today, reminiscing about their appearances).",1415750400,29,1884,4.627627627627628
