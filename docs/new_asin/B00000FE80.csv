1211785,4,B00000FE80,"Okay a crazy fun look at the sex life of cave mens first encounter with the opposite sex. Silly and suggestive great to get the endorphins (health cell builders) flowing, fun for teen and adult in my opinion. (Only suggestive scenes no nude scenes)

First watched at the Drive-in with my girl. Hey we watched the show????? We were young teens at the time. Enjoy",1226275200,,361,4.553846153846154
1211786,3,B00000FE80,"I first saw this movie in the 1970s as a 2nd movie at a drive-in. Very very funny prehistoric movie. I was extremely disappointed when the fire scene (the funniest scene in the movie) was cut short. The movie being on VHS hesitated a lot as if my VCR was bad, but it wasn't my machine. The video quality looks to have been badly copied onto a laserdisc or dvd then recopied back to tape. This normally would be great for the quality had it been remastered, but it falls flat on its face. While my digital counter was still running, the video was herky jerky and actually skipped an entire chapter (the fire scene). If you can an older version of this movie other what's sold on Amazon, buy it as you won't be sorry. DON'T get this confused with When Woman LOST Their Tails as THAT WAS A VERY BAD MOVIE.",1156982400,,802,4.248366013071895
1211787,1,B00000FE80,"The two dreadful films in this series have occasionally been run by stations wanting to save a few bucks, since they are public domain. I purchased I believe the first of the two films in a ShopRite, admittedly for the undeniably sexy presence of Senta Berger. As if the quality of the film wasn't bad enough, I was horrrified to learn the DVD was totally silent. They didn't go through the trouble of finding an audio track to accompany the poor print they made the transfer from, which was faded and sometimes unviewable. The DVD biz has reached a point where some companies will release whatever they can make money from without expending any effort on the release being worth anything. Buyer beware!",1150848000,3,703,4.723577235772358
1211788,4,B00000FE80,"Yes, I Know that this is a cheaply made little-known Italian film that many had panned, but I really found myself laughing out loud at some of the many one-liners that came in rapid fashion in this little gem. I was reminded of the B.C. comic strip as I watched these cavemen discover the little necessities of life, ie; food, shelter, fire, transportation and of course...sex. Each time I view it, I find funny little lines that slipped by before. My hope is that it would be released on dvd like it's inferior follow-up ""When Women Lost Their Tails"" was. This is by far the funnier of the two films and worth a look...L. McNally (dvd collector)",1135209600,,646,4.52991452991453
1211789,3,B00000FE80,"Ok not that I blame anyone, but for one of those really bad movies this is one that has a some tender moments that just inspire. For instance the part when the cave man proclaims, ""You play lousy when your unconscious"" Something to look forward to if you haven't seen this little gem.

Basically short story, short. Cave men abandond at an early age grow up on a deserted island, eventually burn it down, and sail back to the main land where one day they discover a woman, at first they believe her to be a source food something like a strange monkey, later they discover that she's good at something else, eventually they all find women of their own, the end.",1113436800,3,660,4.409836065573771

7908406,3,B00000FE80,"Bunch of silly cavemen trying to learn about life and survival and eventually
find a women with a tail.... Problem is...no man knows what to do with a women.
The movie is so stupid, that its funny...i would recommend this movie.",1344556800,,228,4.585365853658536
7908407,3,B00000FE80,"The title of this movie is perhaps the best indication of its content.

The jacket claims adult only, warns of nudity, sexual content & hype's Senta Berger's role. This may all have been true if filmed in the 50's but it was not true when this was made. It's really for a virgin sexually (giggle,giggle).

This is a spoof with medium level humor through out. You will also spend most of your time watching male cavemen with very little female anything. The sexual content is merely pantomimed in the broadest manner.

If you want a comedy with slapstick action this is it. Nudity is limited to an occasional breast & not Senta Berger's either. She does wear a great cave woman outfit. It gets 3 Amazon stars for absurd stupidity, which I enjoy somewhat.",1263945600,10,753,4.604477611940299
7908408,1,B00000FE80,"First off, this item offered is a burned dvd, and should be notated as so in the listing. Secondly, the video source has to be from an abused VHS copy, it makes a bad grindhouse movie look like a Criterion release. Then we come to the issue that, altho it`s an Italian movie, the only language on the disc is dubbed English, and sounds like it was done by cartoon voiceovers. Couple this with the fact that the dubbing is out of sync more often than not, and what you`re left with is a totally unwatchable movie, even by MST3K standards. It`s not funny, it`s remarkably sad, the slapstick makes the 3 Stooges appear high-brow, any nudity in the film is of people you would never want to see that way, and the ever-luscious Senta Berger had to be paid an exorbitant amount of cash to lend her name to the credits. And, if you can imagine it getting worse from here, she`s not even naked during the entire proceedings!!! Now, I know I`m sounding hyper-critical on a sub-atomic level, but mere words cannot lend depth to the level of trash on display here. And there was a sequel??????? Kill me now...",1250726400,14,1098,4.4405940594059405
7908409,3,B00000FE80,"Looks dated now, but did remind me of the drivein movies and the 70s. Might be worth 8 or 10 dollars but no more.",1249776000,3,113,3.75
