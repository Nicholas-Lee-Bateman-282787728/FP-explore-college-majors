4582588,5,B00561A1UM,"I give this 5 stars because, although this is a compliation of re-issued DVDs, each one is beautiful, exciting and romantic.  The ""Wonderland"" DVD in particular is really great because it offers beautiful renditions of fairy-tale classics in a fairy-tale setting.  Enjoy!",1313366400,8,271,5.428571428571429
4582589,1,B00561A1UM,"These are old DVD's reissued in a new 3 disc packaging. That's why I gave it one star. Gosh, I hate when he does this, especially when he had done so many show this year that could be taped and sold as really new performances that most fans in the U.S. never get to see.",1313020800,40,270,3.9272727272727272

4582635,5,B00561A1UM,As with all of the concerts that Andre Rieu and the JSO this 3 DVD collection is fantastic.  I have never heard any of his concerts that were anything but perfection in both music with master musicians and showmanship that delights children and adults as well. These are really great to watch over and over again. It seems I never tire of watching them. They are really wonderful to watch and enjoy.,1426982400,,399,4.541666666666667

4582641,5,B00561A1UM,"This set is another must have for ANYONE who enjoys incredible music and astounding concerts !!!!! Where and how does he find such high quality and unbelievable talent such as the Platin Tenors, Mirusia Louwerse, Carmen Monarcha, Morschi Franz, Kimi Scotta, Suzann, Carla, and all the other amazing talent that will mesmerize you for hours ??? When you watch the ""WONDERLAND"" DVD, your first thought will be, ""IS THIS MAN BRILLIANT... OR HAS HE JUST LOST HIS MIND"" ! The genius behind this organized chaos results in a production/concert that you will revisit again and again. This is the DVD set requested time and again by my 18 & 19 year old grandsons and their friends and by my senior neighbors. Do yourself a favor and purchase this set. No Regrets Mate.",1397779200,5,760,4.765151515151516
4582642,5,B00561A1UM,THERE IS NOT A BETTER MUSICIAN IN THE WORLD THAN ANDRE!!!  HE AND HIS ORCHESTRA MAKE THE MUSIC SING IN YOUR HEART AND YOUR FEET JUST WANT TO DANCE!!!!!  JOHN,1378252800,5,157,4.2
4582643,5,B00561A1UM,"This DVD is not a film but a variety of concerts by Andre Rieu's orchestra (conducted by Andre who also plays his marvelous violen) which includes both male and female musicians and singers including, among others, sopranos and tenors.  I have another three DVD's showing other concerts of Andre - 'Live at the Royal Albert Hall', 'Under the stars' and 'Home for Christmas'.  These concerts are alive through the personality of Andre and the audience often find themselves singing and dancing, making the performance incredible.  Those who are lucky enough to be present often find themselves joyfully laughing and some  even cry when they hear such pieces of music like 'You'll never walk alone' and 'You raise me up'.  The best word which I can think of to describe these DVD's is DELIGHTFUL",1377820800,8,793,4.932330827067669
4582654,5,B00561A1UM,"It's nice to see Andre live, especially when you get 3 DVD concerts for about the price of one. It's true that these
are not exactly new, but they are good; and if you don't have any of them, it's a bargain. Two of them are fairly long, like 2 hours or so, and the first one is about 1 hour, if you just want a little music before bed. I get these for my Mom who's 92,& she loves them!",1374796800,,385,3.765432098765432

4582656,5,B00561A1UM,Great show as always!  (I don't think that I've ever seen one of his Shows that I DIDN'T enjoy immensely..!),1369958400,,108,4.4
4582657,5,B00561A1UM,Loved the musical selections and the orchestra and Andre were in top form.  The production and settings of the concerts were beautiful.,1369267200,,135,5.136363636363637
4582658,5,B00561A1UM,"This is actually 3 of his concerts in one package.  It was a very good way for me to catch up on
his concerts.  It has ""100 Years of Strauss"", ""The Flying Dutchman"" and ""Wonderland"".  All are
great concerts.  The making of Wonderland is amazing.  I recommend them to everyone.",1368662400,,276,4.44
4582659,5,B00561A1UM,Andre Rieu is the top musician out there today (In my opinion).  The price compares very favorably with what I have seen in other places,1360713600,,136,4.44
4582660,1,B00561A1UM,"Amazon listed this title as a 2011 release and did not say anything about the content titles.
The content is ""100 Years of Strauss"" -- 2003, ""The Flying Dutchman"" - 2005, and ""In Wonderland"" -- 2008.
Amazon needs to describe the content better. I have all three which I have played several times and have enjoyed them each time. I would like to return ""An Unforgettable Evening"" and exchange it for a couple of newer Andre Rieu titles.",1358812800,9,435,4.589743589743589

8459025,5,B00561A1UM,I really enjoyed this dvd especially The 100 Years of Strauss the picture clarity was very good and the music was really great on that dvd and the other two that came with it. I thought this was an outstanding production.,1502841600,,221,4.414634146341464
8459026,5,B00561A1UM,"Three delightful concerts in one package. 100 Years of Strauss is just 60 minutes, but very enjoyable. The Flying Dutchman is 160 minutes of absolute joy and Wonderland at 150 minutes is fantastic. Wonderland was filmed at Efterling (sp?) in Holland which is full of fairy tale settings that really enhance the enjoyment of the music. Andre and his musicians bring such joy to everything they play you'll find yourself saying, again and again, is it over already?!?",1501459200,,465,4.9743589743589745
