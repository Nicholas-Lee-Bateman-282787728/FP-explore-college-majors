3868916,5,B0027VST2Q,"I'll begin with this show is amazing! All of the actors/actresses are a delight and portray each character with style. Many new cases are opened up with this season of the Closer. We delve into deeper crimes than ever along with new transitions that have to take place. The dvd packing is well designed but the only flaw I see is the dvds being tough to pull out of the actual holder. It takes a bit of force to pull them out. Above all the overall plot in this season was amazing and many of the murders that take place are full of twists and turns. One moment you think you know who the killer is but then something throws you off and you are left with a new suspect.
Great Show! Keep them coming Mr. Duff and Crew!!. If you are a closer fanatic, like I am, you'll buy this dvd set. Enjoy!",1278028800,,791,4.142857142857143
3868917,5,B0027VST2Q,This is a wonderful series that always leaves you feeling good and waiting with anticipation of the next series.  There is laughter and suspense all wrapped up together.  Great actors!,1277596800,,184,5.1

3868920,5,B0027VST2Q,"This is one of my all-time favorite programs. Don't have to remember to ""tune in"" -- just pop in a CLOSER DVD & enjoy! I have all the collections so far & hope they keep 'em coming!

3868921,5,B0027VST2Q,"We own all the seasons of ""The Closer"" on DVD. In fact, we own them in the most expensive possible way, because we buy the individual episodes on iTunes so we can watch them on the computer while we're waiting for the DVD to come out. A frequent scene in our household: my wife and I are thumbing through a deck of Netflix, and we will say, ""Oh, let's just watch a Brenda."" I will suggest an episode. She will say, ""Is that the one where ..."" (and here she describes the entire plot). I reply, ""Yes, where ..."" (and here I add some plot details). ""Okay."" Then we watch the episode again and throughly enjoy it.

I've been told, in some English class long ago, that the mark of a ""classic"" is that you can read it over and over and still get something new out it of each time. There is only one other TV show (""Monk"") that I've ever enjoyed watching repeatedly like that, and the reason is the same: the writing, acting, and directing are superb. Even when I know what is going to happen, I enjoy watching all the characters.

Kyra Sedgwick is a thoroughly believable as Brenda Leigh Johnson. In fact, I was floored when I saw her do an interview and realized that she doesn't really have a Georgia accent! Brenda is so human. Yes, she is great at extracting confessions, one way or another, but she also has her foibles, like her penchant for chocolate, her reluctance to throw away old love letters from Will Pope, her rather high-handed and ineffective parenting style with her niece, Charlie (played by her real-life daughter, Sosie Bacon, which is pretty funny).

It's not just Brenda, though. All the characters are fascinating. Personally, I identify with Lt. Provenza because, well, he's me. But Sgt. Gabriel, Flynn, Fritz, Lt. Tao, Buzz, and all the rest are just interesting, believable characters, brilliantly portrayed. And J. K. Simmons, as Chief Will Pope is a delight. That man can say more with one brief facial expression than many actors can in an entire speech. And I look forward to visits from Brenda's mother (Frances Steenbergen) as much as Brenda dreads them.

As a writer, what grabs me most about this show is the writing. The plots are always realistic, the story lines tightly interwoven. For instance, frequently, some little detail in Brenda's ""real life,"" some little detail arising out of a sub-plot about her relationship with Fritz, or her mother, will give her the sudden insight that lets her close her case. But these story points never seem contrived. The interwoven subplots never seem out of place -- you don't realize until the end how neatly everything fits together.

If you are new to ""The Closer,"" I recommend starting with Season 1, to get the background on Brenda's being in L.A., and her relationship with Will Pope. If you are familiar with the show, then this review is probably unnecessary except to say that Season 5 is better than ever.",1268697600,100,2888,4.654901960784314

We will NOT be watching or reviewing!  We already paid for the membership and likely will cancel it.

3869224,5,B0027VST2Q,"I like this show. It's taken the 'city crime-drama with a touch of humor' (you know the shows) and added it's own unique seasoning. I bought the entire storyline from the git-go. What's not to like about an overly polite, sweet-toothed attractive Georgian woman with a flair for shoes and  a hard nose for solving tough crime in the big city? Savvy Southern Belle meets Latino street gangs and Tinseltown murderers. They added a dedicated but fun and off-beat crew to help her out, Potenza, Flynn, Gabriel, Chief Post, et al. There are also a slew of recurring characters that each have strong personalities and add quite a bit to the depth to a show that could easily have gone the way of other predictable and less rewarding TV crime dramas with narrow casting. And Kyra Sedgwick is pretty darn believable as a southern girl too.  With complex personal issues, office romance, pet-gender dyslexia and a true hatred of gadgets, she makes it all look so easy and natural. You start to think she's a real person when you watch the show - sometimes so realistic that you might even misunderstand her at times, maybe even dislike her. But not for long. She's so purty and extremely cordial. Plus, how can you NOT like Mike Stern's 1/2 sister? Thank y'all so much. ;-)",1415923200,,1264,4.663677130044843

Brenda was disgusted when Animal Control did not remove Kitty from her new home, even though she specifically asked them to do so.  She later dismissed Kitty's very presence while talking to a colleague in her new home, even describing the squatter cat with contempt while using facial expressions of disgust and shaking her head back and forth as though she pitied the squatter cat because it was so ugly.

Kyra Sedgwick is an exceptionally talented actress, and was very well suited to this role.  I was not surprised, however, when I read on line that she was the one who decided to end the Closer series with the 7th season.  She has had a really demanding role, and played it with great skill, clarity, and stamina, for a very long run.

The story will be interesting to watch in the continuing series, Major Crimes, without Ms. Sedgwick, in my opinion . I watched the first episode of season one of that series last night, and have to applaud the writers and producers for their attention to the expected problems and disappointments that the squad Chief Johnson left now face without her leadership.

I look forward to watching the remaining available episodes of Major Crimes for many reasons.  One primary reason is to see how the producers fill in the gap left by Kyra Sedgwick's absence.  She really did a great job in a demanding role for a long time.",1412121600,,1200,4.730769230769231

Good storyline so there is some challenge to figuring out who did it.  I love the interviews as they are very entertaining.  Brenda is a strong female lead without being ""absolutely beautiful.""  She is a lilttle too thin but I can overlook this flaw due to the rest of the great things about the show.  I love the banter.",1394668800,,463,4.7974683544303796

3869463,4,B0027VST2Q,"I enjoyed this series immensely, *until* MARY McDONNELL'S character was introduced (and planned to replace Ms. Segwick's). Kyra Sedgwick is a master at her craft. She plays her part as a strong-willed, assertive, at times aggressive officer of the law. As well, the script writers and Ms. Sedgwick apparently were not afraid to allow Ms. Sedgwick's character to have a sensitive -- and yes, *feminine* -- aspect to her personality. Mary McDonnell, on the other hand, plays her character as if she were a completely distasteful BULL. Females in positions of power do not necessarily need to lose their femininity. Equally true is the fact that males in positions of power do not necessarily need to stifle their masculinity (which includes sensitivity to other human beings). ""Feminine"" and ""masculine"" are not dirty words.",1393372800,,822,5.18796992481203
3869464,5,B0027VST2Q,This is by far the best show that has ever aired on television. The characters are great and the stories in each episode are fantastic. I love them so much I watch over and over they are that good.

3869466,2,B0027VST2Q,The language in all the seasons are horrible.  I don't know why producers think this language needs to be a part of the shows.  It doesn't make the shows any different.,1392940800,,168,4.387096774193548

The supporting cast kinda becomes family after a few shows. Everyone has a distinct personality that will amuse you at the very least. A good series, you will like it!",1392508800,,331,4.442622950819672
3869469,5,B0027VST2Q,Compelling script and characters with depth.  A close look at crime in LA....Thought provoking drama.  The question of what is legal and what is moral.  The concepts often collide.  Hat's off to those in law enforcement.  I know that I could not do their job.,1392336000,,259,4.666666666666667

3869471,4,B0027VST2Q,"Just finished Season 5 of ""The Closer"". I've really enjoyed the series. I'll get the bad part out of the way first:

Kyra Sedgwick's character Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson lies to and deceives criminals which is her job. She can't leave her job behind and treats everyone else the same wayher family, her husband, her boss, and to a lesser extent her team.

Even when the truth would serve just as well she lies, makes promises she doesn't keep, can't admit what's plain as day to everyone else.

Now the good stuff:
Excellent stories
Excellent production values
Good comic relief
Excellent supporting cast

I hope the follow up series ""Major Crimes"" makes it to Prime Instant Video soon.",1391990400,,693,4.798319327731092
3869472,4,B0027VST2Q,"I miss this show tremendously, but what better way to relive the days of Brenda and her crew than on DVD.  This is a nice set with the complete fifth season contained within just a few DVDs.  The transfer and audio is very good and probably pretty close to the original broadcast quality from TNT.  My only question is why these are not released in HD???  A discerning buyer like myself would definitely purchase an HD version on Blu-ray but alas the DVD will have to do.  For what it is worth, this is a great presentation and the best available way to view The Closer from beginning to end.",1391990400,,592,4.345454545454546

She doesn't show her week or volnurable side to anyone but when she's alone or working a case her facial expressions show exactly what her inside emotions are dealing with.  I think she wants children but see's what happens to these people (children too) in her job and doesn't want to experience that pain like the families of her victims have too.  She loves Fritz dearly and wants to make him happy and I have a feeling she will in the final season.  I could be wrong but I hope i'm not.,1391990400,,545,4.313725490196078

After I finished watching the 3rd season, when I was sucked in like a junkie on crack, I was no longer able to choose between Standard Definition and HD.  As it kept trying to push HD on me, my computer skipped and puked halfway through each episode before it settled down, making the watching experience, not so great.

3869487,4,B0027VST2Q,"I had never hear of this show until it's spin off, Major Crimes, popped up as an Amazon recommendation when I bought a season of Law & Order Criminal Intent.  I watched the first Major Crimes season, then went back and started with The Closer.  Sure, one has to suspend disbelief and recognize that there is more to the LA police department.  But the characters are fun, the shows cleverly written, and the crimes and solutions satisfying in an entertaining way.  You generally can figure out the whodunnit pretty fast, but who cares.  Great binge viewing.  As a bonus, the banter between characters played by GW Bailey and Tony Denison is like a mini sitcom embedded in the show.",1391040000,,680,4.6722689075630255

This is one series I wish would not end anytime soon but as I go thru season after season I know the dreaded end is coming. I think the casting, the story lines, supporting cast, locations, and guest stars, are all spot on.

3869615,5,B0027VST2Q,"The Closer introduces Kira Sedgewick as the new head of the Major Crimes Division.

The group of almost all male detectives put her through the paces, but she pushes back in gentle ways, always using her southern charm to calm a situation. The men learn to respect her as they watch her in action -- closing the deal, so to speak. Brenda gets perps to confess by expertly sidling up to them with that southern charm, disarming them. Then, like the snap of a southern gator, she latches onto the lie, the statement that doesn't match, or the arrogance of the criminal and twists them in a verbal death roll taking them down and closing the case.

This is an excellent crime drama with a heart -- and a bite! Watch this, and you'll be hooked!!",1374451200,,741,4.4411764705882355

You also use violence sparingly...thank you for that.  ht now, I've started the seventh and final season and don't like that one bit.

3869715,5,B0027VST2Q,"Each season continues to amuse. The characters have individual personalities and they stay in them. The lead character comes across as completely self absorbed, beautiful, but self-absorbed. The actress, Ms. Sedgewick, seems to have taken lessons in how to move her upper lip more attractively or else my awareness of the strange way it moves has dulled. Each episode is interesting and enjoyable.",1366416000,,397,5.317460317460317

3869773,5,B0027VST2Q,"I'm kind of critical of writing; however, on THE CLOSER, my inner editor was blissfully silent and I enjoyed every episode. From the acting, production, direction and especially the writing, I was very happy with this program. The quality of streaming that Amazon has provided made viewing very convenient and the offerings for Prime members is chock full of jewels. I especially like the resume feature for when I have to leave a program before completion.",1360627200,,457,5.026315789473684
3869774,3,B0027VST2Q,"I usually always enjoy this show but sometimes it is just too silly.  It does have a good moral to it, (the bad guy almost always gets caught and Chief Johnson almost always does a miracleous job closing  her cases).  But while the policemen, (Her Squad/Team) do their jobs, well sometimes they, Bailey & Denison, give the wrong impressions to our youth.  They are all funny but serious too, if need be.  Regarding Brenda and her cat;I'm not an animal person I guess, while I like them and disapprove of mis-treatment of any kind, as a child I was never allowed to have a pet in the house unless it was ill.  Brenda & her relationship to her cats are ridiculous.  Based on her actions towards the cat, she never appeared quite old enough to have the responsibility of caring for any animal, nor old enough for any relationship with a live-in partner of any male or female.

I never got it & ended up in a long exchanged with Amazon about it. It was like pulling teeth to get satisfaction. Amazon did take care of me, but the fact that they had a 22-day windows for me to receive this item from the seller. That is way too long.

This seller is still active & is taking pre-orders on items. I want to warn you not to buy anything from this seller.

Amazon took care of me after hours of writing complaints. This is the fault of smitten128 & no one else.

But they're dragging their heels about ejecting this seller.

If you've been ripped off by this seller, contact Amazon right away.

The writing, the acting, the humor and the drama - it all seamlessly unfolds and draws you in, convincingly serious at the same time as being utterly funny. Brenda and Fritz are one of the loveliest couples on TV, while the leadership Brenda stamps her professional position with, is never portrayed in a glaringly aggressive way. A complex and multi-dimensional leader like Brenda can be fierce, as well as humanly frail (and prone to a weakness for sweets). One of my favorite TV series - can't wait to see the next seasons!

3869864,5,B0027VST2Q,"Being a fan of The Closer in the UK is a frustrating business. The show has largely been ignored here except on a subsidiary channel of the Channel 4 Network, which has shown random episodes at various times over the years - hopeless for any continuity. I've had to feed my addiction by importing the dvds after the finish of each marvellous season since catching the very first episode by chance while on a trip to the USA. This has the additional benefit that I always watch the shows without advertising, an important point because this show has very intelligent scripts and unbroken concentration really adds to the experience.

As a cop show The Closer invariably gets filed away in many people's minds with Law and Order, CSI and their clones, which does it no favours because in my view it is so different in its emphasis. OK it's about a murder squad in LAPD, headed by a woman from Georgia, but the murders are really only pegs on which to hang a truly bravura performance by Kyra Sedgwick as Brenda Leigh Johnson, the Deputy Chief of the Major Crimes Unit, and a very talented ensemble cast of J K Simmons, Corey Reynolds, Robert Gossett, G W Bailey, Tony Denison, Michael Paul Chan, Phillip P Keene and John Tenney. Gina Revera made memorable contributions to the earlier seasons but has been written out ""on promotion"".

Created by James Duff, the show excels in displaying the often amusing traits and sometimes irritating foibles of the team members. Brenda Leigh's marriage to Fritz, her own strengths and weaknesses and her exchanges with the rest of her family, have been as beautifully written up in the scripts as has the team dynamics of her MCU. Also in this Season, Sosie Bacon plays Brenda Leigh's niece in the episodes on disc 3. In my opinion, if Sosie's ""Charlie"" isn't brought back say for vacations or supposedly to scout college opportunities or whatever, it will be a miss. I wasn't so impressed by Mary McDonnell's contributions during Season 5 as Captain Raydor but her character also pops up in Season 6, so I'll wait to see how it develops.

For what it's worth, I've read that women particularly love this show; well, I'm a guy and I love it too! They aren't noted for it but TNT Cable has really come up with a treasure here. A five star drama full of human interest. Apparently, there's a Season 7 coming in 2011. Like all the seasons before it, Season 5 is worth every cent.",1280880000,,2412,4.617715617715618

There are so many emotions involved in this program.... the inter-action between the actors is so much fun to experience....

I would highly recommend The Closer series to any person, who enjoys mystery, comedy, intrigue etc etc............ Del Dennis",1280102400,,339,5.1454545454545455

3869875,1,B0027VST2Q,"Why does Video-on-Demand, which sounds like  it would be easy, have to be suck bloody difficult?  For three days I have been trying to watch a series, episode by episode.  Sometimes, I get to a page where I can click the episode I want.  Sometimes, I'm taken to a page where a video is already loading, although I haven't chosen that and haven't selected exactly what I want.  How in the hell do you get back to the page where you can select what you want?  It seems to have disappeared.  I keep going to my account page and then to a download page, when I haven't actually selected anything.  This sucks!  For lack of simplicity and consistency, I rate Amazon Video-on-Demand a great big 0 stars.  Just wait a minute, amazon won't accept this review unless I give it a least 1 star.",1279411200,,783,4.375
3869876,5,B0027VST2Q,"One more season of one of our favorite TV shows.  We have collected few TV productions, ie, Boston Legal, 24, The Sopranos, Shark, Firefly and now The Closer but we find that these episodes of The Closer are so well written and acted that  we started adding The Closer to our collection too.  About every 6 months when we get bored with Netflix arrivals we start watching one of the above series from the beginning and enjoy them all over again.",1278892800,,445,4.469135802469136

Meantime we are so having fun....can't do a spoiler cause of course we are only through disk 1. On to disk two now and no I won't tattle or say anything....suprised at what wasn't addressed such as much to do about Fritz and the Chiefs after wedding or honeymoon time...wasn't even addressed. Just jumped right back into the same fun show without missing a beat.

Oh gotta go....the next disk is in place...and on hold till I get down there....later and enjoy! PS we don't have paid TV up here so depend on the DVD sets
but think perhaps this is the way to go. Even if someday we actually are forced to buy TV via Cable or Satelite......love the series...as good neighbors we all share them.....in fact that reminds me....our neighbors still has the last Prison Break set.....gosh I hope The Closer goes for at least 10 years...as long as the writers stay fresh and the actors have fun too.",1278115200,10,1097,4.654639175257732
