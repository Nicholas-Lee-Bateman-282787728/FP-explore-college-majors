8506153,2,B006X64MU4,"This is a very weird movie or story. It is about a father that prevent his daughter from dating man. So this one handsome young man changed him self into a spirit and tricks the girl into running away with him in the process she gets pregnant for the spirit ghost. Lots of dancing with the Northwest Coast Indian head dresses/clothing and paintings. Understand it is about love and revenge based on a ancient story of the Pacific North West Coast Nisqually Nation. Kind of weird, if you don't understand their culture and tradition.  I do not understand the meaning to the story and on top of that do not like spirits or ghost movies. Very interesting and different anyway.",1501891200,,673,4.608333333333333
8506154,2,B006X64MU4,"I have always loved the story, and as an ex-dancer familiar with Indian dance, both traditional and modern interpretations, I was looking forward to this dvd. I was disappointed.

The interpretation fell flat. The attempt was too modern, stripping away Native American elements. The male lead was ok, but the female dancer seemed to be short on skill. The total effect was sadly sophmoric.",1399852800,,389,5.078125
8506155,5,B006X64MU4,"This is a very different movie. There is very little talking in it and a lot of wonderful dancing in it. There is a women that tells about the story and how they fell in love.  This girl is from a rich family and the father is very protective of her. He listens in on her phone calls and hear that she is planning to meet with this one boy. The father then goes after the boy and gets into a fight with the boy. The boy then goes in a canoe and pads off to an island that is known for the ghost that comes alive at night. She ends up having a baby that ends up like the dad. The whole story does make you think that they're in love with each other. What is great about this movie is you didn't need a lot of words, to make you believe it. I liked it and it kepted my interest.",1390435200,,776,3.7901234567901234
