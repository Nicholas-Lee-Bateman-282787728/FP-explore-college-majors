7998633,1,B0000CBXYL,Totally disappointed not to see the ending...which I knew was meant to be there since I saw it as a child. Why would they not add the ending? Ridiculous!!!,1452297600,,155,4.379310344827586
7998634,5,B0000CBXYL,Very much enjoyed the series. The children are all such accomplished actors.  Too bad they left off the last few episodes. Will have to get the book to see how it ends.,1435363200,,168,4.25
7998635,2,B0000CBXYL,"Any Aussie who remembers this great iconic 1970s Aussie mini-series will be disappointed with how the Americans have made this version ""family friendly"". The quality is OK, but that is to be expected as sadly this series was never ""remastered"" when put on DVD.  But it has been edited which made me feel ""ripped off"" and rather sad. Anybody familiar with the story, knows that at the end the Woolcott children go on a picnic on the last day of their country holiday and that a tree branch breaks off and falls down. As it does, Judy runs and pushes ""The General"" out of the way with the branch landing on her & breaking her back. She dies in a cabin the children take her too. These last several episodes showing this have been edited out by the Americans to make it ""family friendly"". What a giant disappointment and considering the ""blood & guts"" things kids watch today on TV, a joke. For those who remember this series .....stay clear of this version.",1422144000,3,955,4.520231213872832
7998636,5,B0000CBXYL,"I remember watching this series as a little boy back in the 1970's. You can imagine my delight when I found this iconic Australian story on DVD. Ironically, it's not available on DVD in Australia. I highly recommend this series about the Woolcot family
living in outback Australia in 1890s, a nostalgic heartwarming saga. Have your Kleenex handy.",1394150400,,346,4.982758620689655
7998637,4,B0000CBXYL,"This is the DVD set of the TV series made by ABC based on the first book in the Seven Little Australians series by Ethel Turner. There are ten episodes and they follow the book fairly closely. Leonard Teale does an excellent job of portraying the stiff Captain. His wife Esther is well acted by Elizabeth Alexander. Barbara Llewellyn does a fine melodramatic Meg, and Jennifer Cluff's acting (and occasional overacting) brings the irrepressible Judy to the fore. Mark Shields-Brown is perfect as Bunty and Tania Falla as Baby is his perfect match. And, of course, Ruth Cracknell's expertise is not wasted on playing the dry and sardonic Martha. Some of the acting is a little wooden, but, on the whole, this series brings Ethel Turner's Aussie classic to sparkling life.",1369353600,,770,4.885496183206107
7998638,3,B0000CBXYL,I was enjoying watching this programme as I hadn't seen it for a long time. Then disappointment IT DOESN'T FINISH!!!!,1344729600,,117,4.9

7998640,2,B0000CBXYL,"I concur with the person who said Questar ruined this lovely old mini series that I watched when I was a child, I bought it recently not realising that the end episodes where missing and was exceedingly dissapointed by it, I watched it the day I received it and therefore disrupted other peoples viewing because I was so enthralled and wished to continue to the end, therefore I was and am very upset.  Although it was nice to see something that was a childhood favourite of mine, it was a bitter sweet experience for lack of ending!!!!",1222214400,3,536,4.525773195876289
7998641,5,B0000CBXYL,"Seven little Australians was a television series produced in 1974 by the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC). It was based on the book by Ethel Turner.  Watching it again brings back many childhood memories (we used to watch it together as a family) when ABC would keep re-running it.  It was that popular.

Leonard Teale plays the father of a young family in the late 1890s. After his wife dies, he eventually marries a much younger woman (played beautifully by Elizabeth Alexander).  The eldest daughter Judy, presents much stress to the father and is sent off to boarding school.  Judy plays a key role in the series and along with her siblings, brings Ethel Turner's vision to life. The series was an international hit.

This DVD release should be avoided as they have left off the last two episodes.  How this happened is anyone's guess.  My recommendation is that people purchase the ABC edition which is complete, and also includes some interesting special features (eg. an on location documentary from 1974).

I enjoyed watching the series again, and it was the first time I had seen it in colour.  That in itself was a pleasure.",1107561600,20,1142,4.84020618556701
7998642,5,B0000CBXYL,"After having viewed the two video collection of ""The Seven Little Australians"" we are totally hooked!  We were hoping that there were more installments in the collection.  We will certainly be checking out the book collection!",1048982400,3,226,5.25
