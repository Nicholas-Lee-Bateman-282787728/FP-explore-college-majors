The last volume ended with Sakuragi being asked to come in for an injured Akagi.  With only 10 minuets to spare Sakuragi entered the game; however, he was extremely nervous and unable to remember anything about playing basketball.  Thankfully, Rukawa snaps him out of it by delivering a swift kick to Sakuragi's bum.

After being snapped out of his nervous state Sakuragi proves to be an unpredictable factor.  This new factor inspires Sendoh to put 100% into his game instead of at the relaxed level he was originally playing at.  Rukawa on the other hand had been putting everything he had into the game falls to the floor from exhaustion and a leg cramp.  The entire Shohoku team is concerned that Rukawa may have to have a substitute.  Sakuragi takes it upon himself to assist his teammate by kicking him in the leg (this is a pretty funny scene).

Episodes 16-19 feature the conclusion of the practice game between Shohoku and Ryonan.  Probably the most interesting aspects of this game are the following: Sakuragi's improved game play, the interaction between Sakuragi and Rukawa, Coach Anzai having Sakuragi and Rukawa guard Sendoh, and Akagi's return to the game.

The final episode on this volume introduces a new character Miyagi Ryota who is a sophomore at Shohoku High school.  Much like Sakuragi, Ryota has similar girl trouble (he's been dumped by 10 girls) and appears to be a bit of a troublemaker.",1120435200,3,1621,4.854014598540146
