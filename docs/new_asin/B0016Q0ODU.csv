8264103,5,B0016Q0ODU,"I have 6 y/o twin Grandsons who absolutely love everything Mario! When I am busy, especially getting dressed for church on sunday mornings, they watch Mario and I am not constantly interrupted by them. They rush to get dressed for church without argument so they can finish watching. They know all the players, songs and tell me what is going to happen next since they have seen it so many times. They are safe for them to watch with no bad language, etc. Love them.",1284940800,,466,4.4941176470588236
8264104,5,B0016Q0ODU,Good for keeping the monsters at bay while you get to do other things.  Warning - not for consumption by adult humans.  Yuppie and other generational human larvae under the age of drinking beer only.  If watched by adults possible brain slime may occur.  You do not want to test this on yourselves.,1264291200,,298,4.566037735849057
