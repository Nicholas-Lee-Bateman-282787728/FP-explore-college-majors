8446184,3,B004X60R0U,I have mixed reviews on this documentary. I liked it because I love film that shows the air superiority of a McDonnell Douglas F4 Phantom. My opinion the greater jet of our time but the film repeats the same aerial footage and bombings over and over again. It got very repetitious. It was great the first few times but they use the same footage with new dialogue. Not a great film but I bought it used and paid less then $5 for it so for me it's definitely worth having in my collection. If you can get it as cheap as I did then I recommend it.,1462924800,,544,4.093457943925234
8446185,4,B004X60R0U,I would have liked to see more aerial combat footage and a bit less of the captives held in the North.  The story of the helicopters was very well done and interesting.  Overall a nice set of videos.,1423958400,,199,4.2105263157894735
8446186,4,B004X60R0U,Well done,1412726400,,9,4.0
8446187,3,B004X60R0U,"the Air War disc was very poor quality.  Music was too loud to hear narrator and narrator's strong accent made it doubly hard to understand what he was saying.
I would give the Helicopter disc 5 stars.",1376265600,,201,4.4324324324324325
8446188,4,B004X60R0U,"As a pilot, I was skeptical upon ordering this, but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived.  Lots of historical information without the smaltzy or jazzy musical sound that usually curses these types of presentations.  (Maybe I've seen too many PowerPoint presentations of related issues).  This is straight footage, some of it with narration that reflects the time period.  Other clips appear to be directly from the airframe manufacturer.  In short, this is time travel, but from your armchair, with DVD remote in hand.",1365206400,,522,5.240963855421687
8446189,5,B004X60R0U,"Saw this program originally on the military channel. Outstanding, very well done. An accurate account of the air war in Vietnam. Don't understand the 1 star review, its a wrong post as he is talking about an entirely different program
well worth buying.  5 stars.",1352505600,,263,4.844444444444444
