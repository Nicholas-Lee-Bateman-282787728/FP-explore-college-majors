8261544,1,B00168DPQQ,"Wow! This DVD was such a disappointment. A 50 minute time-span isn't enough to give much information other than to quickly gloss over some highlights of the era and location of Five Points. No real history was given on the gangs.  I felt more informed after watching a fictionalized movie ""Gangs of NY"" than after watching this documentary.  After seeing that movie I did some research and read more informative articles on-line.  A little on-line research into the more detailed history of the area will give you a better array of books, movies, and documentaries to choose from.  Herbert Asbury's book The Gangs of New York is a good place to start.  Although historical fiction, Kevin Baker's Paradise Alley is an excellent book that depicts the hardships and politics of the times along with the varied gangs of Five Points.",1433980800,,828,4.885714285714286
