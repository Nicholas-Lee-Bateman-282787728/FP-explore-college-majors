6245032,5,B00I099JZK,Going to make those long car rides with the kids easier.  Now if only they'd release the complete Original Animated Series.  My son likes this one but my daughter likes the original.  We can only hope.,1400025600,,201,4.527777777777778
6245033,2,B00I099JZK,"alright let's start with the packaging this is a 4 disc set it comes in a small DVD case the DVD's aren't even separated by any sort of sleeve, they're all just crammed in there in the same DVD slot. There's nothing special about the menu its just a drawing of zilla, no animation or music.

The show itself is based on the 1998 Roland Emmerich film Godzilla the series picks up after the events of the film acting as a sequel of sorts the protagonist Nick totopolis finds the baby zilla and it becomes attatched. He forms a team that travels the world fighting other mutations and giant monsters.",1399939200,2,597,4.427272727272728
6245034,5,B00I099JZK,"At long last the series is available to anyone who doesn't have youtube or netflix. I loved discovering this when I was younger since 98 Godzilla was my ""first"" Godzilla. And yes, by now I have seen the originals and agree that they weren't done justice with '98, but it was ok as its own movie and this series is like The Clone Wars(2008) to the Star Wars prequels= better than the movies. Obviously the Kaiju fights are the best thing about the show, since it wasn't in the '98 film, which [the fights] at least earned Zilla Jr the awesome nickname G-MAN. The first episodes were only on vhs and of course it would be expensive (unless its from a thrift store or swap meet, which is rare) so naturally I got hyped when i saw 98% of the series on Netflix and now we get the long needed DVD complete set. I hope other Zilla symapthizers (at least) enjoy it as much as I do.",1399852800,,873,4.233532934131737
6245035,5,B00I099JZK,"The redemption of godzilla 98 .Despite the negative reaction to the film, Godzilla: The Series garnered surprisingly positive reactions from fans and it did well in the TV ratings. The series followed the adventures of Dr. Nick Tatopoulos, a major character from the film, and Zilla's surviving baby. The series returned Godzilla's trademark characteristics to Zilla Junior, including his strength and nigh-indestructibility, his atomic breath and general masculinity. Zilla Jr. follows Dr. Tatopoulos and the members of H.E.A.T around, having imprinted upon Nick as his own parent, and fights various other monsters that have been formed by nuclear radiation, in the style of the late Showa era. The fan response to the series was overall very positive, and Zilla Junior gained much respect from those who hated the film.

And please don't read zillaman67 replies just ignore him (pressing link ""Ignore this customer""as I already do ), really this guy have serious problems",1399507200,17,974,5.366013071895424
6245036,3,B00I099JZK,"OK The show itself is pretty good. Much better then the movie it was based on. This review will be based on the DVD release and not necessarily the show itself. As far as this release goes it is very basic. The packaging is that annoying DVD stack packaging much like the Matrix four film favorites for those of you who know what that is. There are no special features, audio selections, or anything like that. The menus on each disk are exactly the same. It just has a play all feature, and an episode selection. It doesn't even give you the info on each episode so you will just have to look that up. But, if you are one of those people who just wants to own the complete series and don't care about any special features then you should pick this release up. The picture quality is nice and the episodes play well. I hope this was helpful.",1398902400,25,841,4.2625
6245037,1,B00I099JZK,"First off-this is NOT Godzilla. This is 'Zilla'...disowned by Toho themselves. For the kiddies who don't know-it's the company who created the TRUE Godzilla in 1954. Tri-Star's 'Godzilla' from '98 (the same lizard in this cartoon-only this one hatched from the first lizard's egg) was and IS a failure. They RUINED G for all true self-respecting fans (like myself). It's only the youngsters (the cartoon/anime crowd) who like this garbage because they didn't grow up with the real Godzilla like I did. The marathons that ran on channel 7, the Thanksgiving features that had King Kong and Godzilla going all day long...this Tri-Star phony did not even have radioactive breath in the film. When they did the animated series they tried to fix their mistakes-by giving 'Zilla' atomic breath, and having him battle other (fake) kaiju. Don't believe it? Godzilla '98 flopped so badly that they canned a sequel, and made the cartoon instead. Also, Toho would not allow them to use ANY of the true G's kaiju foes like Ghidora, Rodan, Mothra, Megalon, Gigan, Titanosaurus, Mecha Godzilla etc., etc. (although there IS a fake Mecha G in the cartoon). The Tri-Star film instead of being dark in tone like the '54 original (which is what it was supposed to be-a re-make of the original) was full of cardboard characters, goofy comedy (CHEAP laughs for sure), and an androgynous 'A-sexual'wimp of a lizard who lays eggs (OH GOD NO!!!), has NO atomic breath, and runs away from the army where the TRUE King would have faced them and CRUSHED them. People-a KING is NOT a 'he-she'-a King is a MAN-men do not lay EGGS! They also gave the cartoon ZILLA atomic breath because they knew they botched their film. I don't know ANY true G fans who like this crap. So anyone tempted to buy this-your better off renting an old Godzilla film (or newer Hesei or Millenium G flick) or go and watch the real 2014 Godzilla when it's released! May 16th 2014 baby! The REAL King arrives! Thank you Legendary Pictures and Gareth Edwards for giving the TRUE G fans what they want!!!",1398556800,3,2048,4.771830985915493
6245038,5,B00I099JZK,"Why could the movie have not been like this great animated Godzilla show! Godzy is a fighter in this series, great monster vs. monster battles, sweet green atomic blast, a pretty funny (annoying more often than not) robot which Godzilla destroys often in hilarious ways, new and returning cast keeps things fresh. Don't let the bad taste of the movie keep you from checking out this fun kaiju series!",1396310400,9,400,4.811594202898551
6245039,5,B00I099JZK,Finally the complete series of godzilla I have all of kong and both movies now I can get ride of my bootleg copies i saw this when it first came out in 1998 and when I found out about DVD I wanted this to come out and now here it is now they just need to release extreme ghostbusters and extreme dinosaurs on DVD I can't wait to sit down and watch it,1395273600,5,350,3.808219178082192

6245042,5,B00I099JZK,this was great for watching with my son. my son is 5 years old and he has always been one who likes bad guys like Loki from marvel or joker from DC. Godzilla is awesome to him because he is huge and scary.,1509148800,,205,3.7906976744186047
6245043,5,B00I099JZK,"Not the perfect Godzilla cartoon. But it's great entertainment for the kids, especially if your trying to teach kids about the monster multiverse.",1507680000,,146,5.391304347826087
6245044,5,B00I099JZK,"This is a great collectors object for Godzilla fans. It is a long ended Cartoon series that aired on Fox Kids on Saturday mornings back in the 90's. It is the complete series on DVD discs. The series is based off of the 1998 reboot movie, Godzilla.",1505606400,,248,4.297872340425532
6245045,4,B00I099JZK,"""Godzilla - The Complete Animated Series"" contains all 40 episodes of the animated show that followed TriStar Pictures's 1998 film, ""Godzilla."" Malcolm Danare (portraying Mendel Craven), Kevin Dunn (portraying Tony Hicks), and Michael Lerner (portraying Mayor Ebert) reprise their roles from the film while Ian Ziering takes over the role of Dr. Nick Tatopoulos (originally played by Matthew Broderick); Charity James takes over the role of Dr. Elsie Chapman (originally played by Vicki Lewis); Paget Brewster takes over the role of Audrey Timmonds (originally played by Maria Pitillo); and Joe Pantoliano takes over the role of Animal Palotti (originally played by Hank Azaria). New characters include Rino Romano playing computer hacker Randy Hernandez, Tom Kenny voicing robot N.I.G.E.L., and Brigitte Bako playing French agent Monique DuPre, who replaces  Jean Reno's Philippe Roach for the show (though Roach does appear twice, voiced by Keith Szarabajka).
As TriStar Pictures's film underperformed, the studio made this series rather than the two planned sequel films. The cartoon, done in the style of ""Men in Black: The Series"" (which aired around the same time), explores different mutations with H.E.A.T. (Humanitarian Environmental Analysis Team) working to study and contain them. The Godzilla monster in this series is the offspring of the one in the movie. Some of the monsters appear to be stand-ins for other Toho monsters that TriStar couldn't license. As the show only ran from September 12, 1998  April 22, 2000, it's relatively limited, though entertaining. Purists who disliked the TriStar film will likely dislike this series (a character asking, ""What would Gojira be doing in Japan?"" stands out as the ultimate dismissal), but those who want to see some form of Godzilla battle other monsters won't be disappointed. The DVD set includes two episodes that never aired and is well-organized for viewers. Worth checking out.",1505606400,,1945,5.437086092715232
6245046,5,B00I099JZK,"I used to watch Godzilla the Series back in the 90s and have watched it on youtube as well. I was very happy to discover it available for a affordable price at Amazon. I am a fan of cartoon animation and have collected a number of shows over the years after working in the animation industry. I thought the animated series was superior to the original american movie that starred Matthew Broderick. The animated series does feature the same character from the movie, Dr Nick Tatopoulos  but voiced by a new actor Ian Ziering. There is an ensemble cast of characters that aid him as well as the titular character Godzilla. I also liked the hydrofoil ""Heat Seeker"" used in the show by the H.E.A.T. team.

Overall the series has some great design work with both the monsters and the human characters. The storylines do tend to be ""monster of the week""  but some of the character relationships are surprising adult for a kids cartoon and reminded me at least a little of Jonny Quest.

As others have mentioned there is too much compression used on the episodes and the packaging uses a single spindle for the 4 dvd disks in the collection. But I am still happy to have it in my video library.",1502236800,,1188,4.511627906976744
6245047,5,B00I099JZK,"Before I rate this cartoon series let me say this: I don't understand the hate that the 98' film gets from people! Its a summer popcorn film...why would you think its going to be a masterpiece? I would say its better that some of the other Godzilla films from the 60's and 70's, those are very cheesy films, and some are very hard to watch. But this one is at least easy and fun to watch. Nothing beats Godzilla 1954 and the Godzilla film released in 1984, but this is good traditional summer fun.

Now for the cartoon series: Its well done and the animation is very clean and crisp. The stories are fine and you can't ask for more. I feel children and adults can enjoy this series.",1502064000,,682,4.286821705426356

6245056,4,B00I099JZK,"Never saw this back when, despite being somewhat more favorable to Godzilla 1998 than others (emphasis on ""somewhat""). Fast-forward to now and I figured for a bargain price might as well try the series, play an episode in the background here and there. As it turns out, as has been noted here and around the 'net, this is actually a solid series. Positives include a cast of adult characters, generally interesting stories, and that this version of ""Zilla"" is a fighter. He even uses a powerful green breath attack quite often.

The packaging is merely adequate, with the DVD discs stacked upon each other but really this is a great bargain for those who enjoy watching animation of all types. And especially those interested in a more entertaining version of the Godzilla 98 creature.",1480982400,,785,4.858208955223881
6245057,3,B00I099JZK,"My review isn't for the show itself, so much as it is for the packaging.

40 episodes on 4, very no frills discs. No special features of any sort, the main menu is a very static image on a black background, with no music, really, there's no point in even having a main menu if they're going to be that lazy about it, they should just auto play.

My biggest complaint is that all four discs share the box without any dividers. They're just sort of stacked in the middle, it's not good.

At the end of the day though, it gets the job done. You have the whole series here for a reasonable price, so you can't ask for much more.",1480464000,,624,4.098360655737705

6245096,3,B00I099JZK,"Godzilla: The Animated Series has some things going for it: each episode is fairly action-packed and the series carries a narrative arc; it gives its characters plenty of screen time and attempts to flesh out the human leads; it carries over Nick Tatapolous, his girlfriend and reporter Audrey Timmonds, and Major hicks (this is only a plus if you were a fan of the 1998 GINO, i.e., Godzilla In Name Only); it brings the monsters and though it gives occasional nods to classic Toho beasties it pretty much creates its own, not to mention that they are fairly detailed and usually grotesque looking rather than elegant (it always made me wonder if the artists ever got mad at the designers for creating rather intricate monstrosities); but most importantly it gives this new Godzilla some of the same characteristics that the classic Godzilla possesses (and the big screen version didnt), including an atomic breath and a fighting spirit.  BUT despite these points in its favor each ep followed a very standard script and that led to a certain level of boredom most of the time.  Thats this series main downfall, that and does anyone else think that Dr. Elsie Chapman was just drawnugly?  Why?  She had such a hard look.  The series also perhaps took itself a little too seriously what with all of the eco-friendly messages.  It could have used a healthier dose of camp and pure escapist fun, like the Hanna Barbera admittedly sci-fi version of Godzilla had.  This set is a great value for the price and it sure is a safe watch for you and your kids, but I wanted more.  3.5 stars.",1468627200,2,1580,4.699275362318841

6245098,4,B00I099JZK,One of the few good things to come out of the disastrous 1998 film. All the episodes look & sound great. The characters are memorable and the monsters are amazing to behold. The only downside the way the four discs are set up in the case. The fact that they needed four discs to put all the episodes on means that there are no goodies in terms of extras. Fortunately the show itself more than makes up for that by being awesome.,1461456000,,428,4.2317073170731705

But the show was a great series/sequel to the 1998 version, there would have been a sequel where we would have had something like from the show happen in the movie, but still great animation and action/adventure.

6245164,3,B00I099JZK,"To start with, the three stars are for the DVD release itself. I'd give the actual series four stars, easy.

If you liked the 1998 Godzilla film, you'll probably like this series. If you hated the 1998 film, you might enjoy this one anyway. The animation is solid and the characters are fairly likable (and, in my opinion, far better than their film counterparts; well, the ones that were in the film, anyway). The episodes all follow the same formula for the most part, but the same could be said for a lot of cartoons. All in all, it's worth a look.

The DVD release, however, is... Very bare-bones. It has the episodes, and that's it, really. It advertises two 'unaired' episodes, but they were already on Netflix (before the show was taken off there; and I am not sure if any other streaming services had them, but it's possible), so they aren't entirely 'new' and 'exciting'. But if you never saw them, now's your chance.

My biggest issue with the DVD release is the fact that all the DVDs are stacked on one another in the case. I strongly recommend you keep some spare DVD cases around, so nothing gets scratched.

But for its price? It's not awful. And the episodes still look and sound good, and they're finally on DVD, so in the end, I suppose that's what matters most.",1419984000,,1280,4.504310344827586

6245201,5,B00I099JZK,"If you bring up the 1998 Godzilla from director Roland Emmerich around most fans of the ""King of Monsters"" it's like pouring gasoline on still smoldering embers.  Yes, few Hollywood remakes evoke as much rage as TriStar's 1998 reimagining of Godzilla (or ""Zilla"" as fans like to call it), but if you were child in the late 90s through early 2000s you may remember this monster in a more positive light.  Why?  Because you likely were exposed to ""Zilla"" through the animated series which aired Saturday mornings on Fox Kids from 1998 to 2000.  This series was chock full of fun characters and all the monster-against-monster action one could ask for from a Godzilla cartoon.  Not only does it surpass the '98 film that spawned it in almost every regard but for this fan it remains one of the most memorable interpretations of the character ever put on screen.

Godzilla the Series takes place right where the '98 film left off with the film's Zilla being killed by the military.  In the aftermath of the destruction Dr. Nick Tatopoulos (now played by Ian Ziering) goes back into the New York Subway to make sure all the Zilla eggs have been destroyed.  As folks who saw the movie already know one has survived and Tatopoulos happens to stumble upon it.  Through a series of coincidences rather than killing him the baby Zilla (which we shall now refer to as ""Zilla Jr."")  imprints on Tatopoulos as its parent.  Zilla Jr. quickly grows in size and begins exhibiting traits the film's Zilla lacked (including a welcome new version of Godzilla's iconic atomic breath) and is sterile, so the film's threat of baby lizards taking over the world is neutralized.

Of course, as a good adaptation of Godzilla it turns out little Zilla Jr. isn't the only monster (referred to in the series as ""mutations"") in the world.  In classic Saturday morning fashion Tatopoulos and a team of quirky human characters going by the name H.E.A.T.  (Humanitarian Environmental Analysis Team) must travel the world with Zilla Jr. protecting humanity from the mutations that would see fit to devour the indigenous population.

The animation of Godzilla: The Series is handled by Sony Television regular Adelaide Productions, who many will likely remember for their other adaptations of Sony films (most notably Men in Black: The Series).  Adelaide's style is unmistakable, and anyone familiar with their take on Men in Black will instantly notice the similarities in character/creature design, color pallettes, and music.

The DVD set from Mill Creek Entertainment (in association with Sony Entertainment) is about as barebones as it gets.  There are no special features, nor audio options to be found, and the picture quality leaves a lot to be desired.  Whule that can be incredibly irksome if you're a videophile like me, I'm honestly just pleased the series actually got a DVD release in the first place.

I highly recommend Godzilla the Series to members of my generation looking for a fantastic throwback to the carefree memories of waking up to Fox Kids and to parents looking for something new to share with their kids.  This Godzilla series has enough action to keep older kids entertained without insulting their intelligence.  The low price more than compensates for the lack of special features and uneven video quality, delivering over 14 hours of animated entertainment at an unbeatable price.  Who knows, maybe strong sales could lead into a complete Men in Black: the Series DVD.

So go ahead.  Give ""Zilla Jr."" a chance and join the H.E.A.T. team on their mission to protect humanity.",1407974400,6,3574,4.936454849498328
6245202,5,B00I099JZK,Good series about the continuing storyline of the '98 American Godzilla film. Actually better than the movie in some ways.,1407974400,,122,5.15
6245203,5,B00I099JZK,"I taped this entire show when it aired on Australia's Network Ten in 1999 and watched these episodes repeatedly. In 2004, I accepted an online acquaintance's offer to send copies of my tapes to his friend in the UK so that he could transfer them to region free DVDs. While I was satisfied with those VHS to DVD transfers, I have long waited for the complete series to be officially released on DVD. That day has finally come, and I couldn't be happier.

While these DVDs have no subtitles or extras, the set is more than I could have hoped for. The picture quality is superb, vastly superior to that of my old VHS recordings (which for the most part I thought had great picture quality, albeit with some occasional video artefacts and Channel 10 logos). In fact, thanks to these official DVDs I am can see tiny details in the picture that I never saw before. Sharp edges of character outlines and the like. Details that were blurred or merged in my VHS recordings. And that's despite my VHS recordings being 576i vs these DVDs 480i. The DVD cover could have done with individual compartments for each disk, instead of just stacking the disks on top of each other. But I find that to be little more than a minor inconvenience.

Many people have criticized the 1998 movie for its deviation from its Japanese roots. Namely Godzilla not breathing fire or fighting other monsters, and getting killed off with missiles. I liked the movie. But for those who didn't, this series more than makes up for it. Everyone I know who hated the movie has had nothing but positive things to say about the cartoon it spawned. Here Godzilla breaths atomic fire (and yes, his spines light up just before he takes his shot). He fights other giant monsters or giant robots in every episode. And, importantly, he survives bomb blasts, missiles, volcanoes, avalanches, you name it.

Plot wise, the TV show continues from where the 1998 movie left off. It's revealed that Nick Tatopoulos returned to Madison Square Garden with the military and accidentally stumbles across the last of the first Godzilla's eggs just before it hatches. The baby imprints on Nick, seeing him as his surrogate father. This second Godzilla grows old and still imprinted on Nick proceeds to follows him wherever he goes to protect him from other giant monsters popping up out of the wood work.

Nick forms an organization devoted to tracking down these giant mutants for research purposes and to, if necessary, eliminate them. The team consists of two characters from the film: Doctors Elsie Chapman and Mendel Craven (played by Vicki Lewis and Malcolm Danare in the film respectively, the latter reprises his role here); and two new characters: Randy Hernandez, a college student and research assistant to Nick who serves as the team's IT expert and hacker); and Monique Dupre, a French intelligence agent sent by Phillip Roach whose modus operandi seems to be ""destroy all monsters on sight"".

While none of the ToHo monsters like Mothra or King Ghidorah are featured in this series, Godzilla's animated opponents are more than worthy to be considered iconic in their own right. Such creatures include El Gusano Gigante, a giant six-eyed, spiny earthworm that feeds off poisons and can burrow through rock; the Crackler, a giant bug/lizard like entity composed of electromagnetic energy that shoots electricity; Skeetera, a giant mosquito that grows larger as it sucks up other mutant's blood and is able to steal the abilities of any mutant whose blood it feeds on; and Crustaceous Rex, a giant walking squid/crustacean hybrid that spits tar and has tentacles coming out of its chest.

Interestingly, some of these animated mutations seem to be inspired by various ToHo monsters. With Megapede, the giant bees, and other mutant insects being inspired by Mothra; the man-eating plants are obviously a reference to Biolante; and the corpse of the Godzilla from the 1998 movie is resurrected as a cyborg - clearly a nod to MechaGozilla. The ""Competition"" episode really peaked the homage to Toho: seeing the animated Godzilla go up against a gigantic robotic ape (with realistic skin coverings) always reminds me of ""King Kong vs Godzilla"".

Actually, I think this series may have inspired later Godzilla movies. The Cyber-Godzilla (or Cyber-Zilla if you prefer), was probably the inspiration for Kiryu, the Millennium version of MechaGodzilla which was built around the bones of the 1954 Godzilla. There was also an episode in which Nick and Monique go inside Godzilla's blood stream in a mini sub to battle giant germs infecting him. This is similar to a scene from ""Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack"", in which one of the protagonists travels inside Godzilla via mini-sub to plant a bomb. And on two separate occasions in the series, the human characters go scuba diving onto the giant monster itself as it moves through the sea: Nick and Monique riding Godzilla in ""D.O.A."" and Randy and Monique riding the Cryptocleidus in ""Monster Wars Part 2"". Watching these scenes now I can't help but wonder if they inspired a certain scene from ""Godzilla vs Megaguirus"". Ironically, this animated Godzilla has even defeats quite a few opponents, such as Rhinosaurus and Skeetera, in much the same way the Japanese Godzilla defeated ""Zilla"" in ""Godzilla: Final Wars"" - one quick swipe of his tail.

In addition to the ToHo-inspired characters, other monsters seem to be based on mythology with a cult following of their own. For example, The Loch Ness monster and Quetzalcoatl both make appearances. It's truly epic to see these creatures in a Godzilla show.

Inspirations and homages aside, the fight scenes between Godzilla and the monsters are always a sight to behold. And the series takes place in so many different places around the world that it never gets boring. One episode we may see Godzilla battling monsters in New York, the next we may see him duking it out in Jamaica tearing down cliffs and pulling up sunken ships, the next he may be on a tropical island, then battling monsters undersea, then he might be back in the city pulling down buildings and hunting down his enemies.

As I said before, I liked the 1998 movie and never really had any problem with the characters therein. Although some people apparently did. I encouraged a friend to watch this show recently and one of the things he said about it was, and I quote: ""All the annoying characters from the movie are corrected here."" Let me tell you, they certainly have been given quite the upgrade. As much as I liked Mathew Broderick, I have to say that Ian Ziering portrays this animated interpretation of Nick as a far more sophisticated scientist and even warrior with pure leadership skills. When he's not in the lab talking techno and giving orders to his team mates; he's out in the field commanding Godzilla, and even wielding rifles whilst dodging explosions and monster attacks. I'd be happy to call this guy ""boss"" any day of the week.

Audrey Timmons is also portrayed more sophisticated here too. Whereas in the film she was this blond nobody constantly feeling sorry for herself and trying to get ahead, here the series takes full advantage of her self-confidence that she developed by the end of the film. She's portrayed as a savvy and intelligent reporter who is determined to get two things - the story of the century and Nick. I like to think of her as April O'Neil from the 1987 TMNT, but with brains.

I was actually surprised that Elise Chatman and Mendel Craven were given such large roles in this series, considering that they were just secondary characters in the film. But Elise's sarcastic remarks and Mendel's on-the-spot inventing make for great entertainment.

The dialogue scenes contain a lot of fun techno babble and each character interacts with each other in their own quirky way which lead to many hijinks. Craven is always pissed at Randy for reprogramming his robot N.I.G.E.L. Elise always spouts sarcasm and casually flirts with Nick - much to the aggravation Audrey, while Nick just seems to ignore Elise's flirting. And Randy keeps trying to make his moves on Monique and fails repeatedly.

And again, the human characters also put up good fights of their own. Trying to take down the creatures with their own weapons or inventions. There are plenty of monsters as big as a buildings for Godzilla to fight. But there are also a few human sized monsters like giant rats or insects for the human characters to try and outrun or open fire upon. So you have the best of both worlds: you got monster battles and human retaliation. Even the smaller mutants attempt to take on Godzilla. In one episode human-sized rats climb all over him in an attempt to take them down, and in another episode human-sized termites did the same.

In all honesty, any nitpicks that I really have with this show are minor. I personally would have liked to see more of Nick and Audry's relationship in this series. Fortunately though, their time away from each other is actually addressed in a few episodes. But I was a little disappointed by the lack of screen time for certain other movie characters. Phillippe Roache was relegated to only three episodes; Lucy was mentioned (indirectly or directly) in a couple episodes but never seen; while Sergeant O'Neal was conspicuously absent without explanation. It's also a little odd that Kevin Dunn's character was a US Army Colonel in the movie, and despite the first episode literally continuing from right where the film ended he's been demoted to Major (maybe for blowing up Madison Square Garden?).

As imaginative as the designs of Godzilla's adversaries are, a few of these mutants could have benefited from some better names. Sure we have creatures like El Gusano Gigante, Crustaceous Rex, Rhinosaurus, D.R.A.G.M.A., etc. But then we have creatures are simply called ""Giant Bat"", ""Giant Chameleon"", ""Giant Turtle"", ""Giant This"", ""Giant That"". These aren't names, these are what they are! And speaking of monsters, at times the show tries to play a juggling game of who will play a more significant role in bringing down the monster of the week: Godzilla or the human characters. For example: in episode 2 it is clearly Godzilla who brings down the giant squids and defeats Crustaceous Rex; while in Episode 3 it is Randy and Mendel's computer virus that ultimately stops the Nanotech Microbe Colony, not to mention Nick who dropped the virus into the creature. But regardless of who defeats the creatures, the battles are always spectacular.

Really, those are the only gripes that I have with the show. And if they are as trivial as that, you can't go wrong. The only major thing wrong with this show was that it only lasted for two seasons. As much as I enjoyed ""Godzilla 2014"", I would have much rather seen a live action continuation to this series. It is also kind of depressing that ToHo has renamed the American Godzilla ""Zilla"", but again the ToHo films have had so many reboots and alternate continuities that it's hard to keep track of what's considered canon anymore. But regardless of what ill memories people may have of the film, or what ToHo calls this monster, this animated interpretation of Godzilla will forever be my Godzilla. That memory is now forever preserved on DVD, and I highly encourage everyone to get that DVD and relive this truly epic saga.",1407110400,,11393,4.867457452294998

6245221,5,B00I099JZK,"The unjust demonization of the 1998 Godzilla film, notwithstanding (itself merely a reimagining of a well-known popular culture figure, no more harmful than Daniel Craig's post-9/11 James Bond, or Marvel Comics' Ultimate reexamination of classic superheroes), this animated follow-up did much to build a fascinating universe set in the aftermath of the film, the ominous-looking (and fast-growing!) hatchling at the end not as harmful as feared, bonding with the first human it sees, protagonist Nick ""Worm Guy"" Tatopoulis (Matt Broderick in the film). A universe where Godzilla is the iceberg's tip, where mutations are concerned, many of these less hospitable than ""The G-Man,"" as he comes to be called.

This series was far more intelligent than most Saturday morning fare airing in the 1990s (mostly merely glorified toy commercials), and its human characters, animated versions of the film's protagonists, are fleshed out as people, as regards workplace banter, character flaws, families, romantic relationships--and careers that conflict with them--and life stories/pasts (focusing exclusively on Gojira could get old, after all), with new characters, such as Randy Hernandez, Dr. Tatopoulis's irreverent Latino lab assistant/hacker, and the team's scornful (in her dealings with matters American) French-Vietnamese ally Monique ""Miss Saigon"" Dupres, sent by Jean Reno's intelligence agent from the film, to keep future mutations under surveillance), rounding out the cast. (Yes, characters look slightly different from film counterparts, but for legal reasons, exact actor likenesses being problematic.)

(And Godzilla is no mere, mindless animal, one particularly dark episode, ""End of the Line,"" revealing an intelligent, emotional being lurking in that reptilian brain.)

For all that traditional fans of the old Toho Godzilla films felt betrayed by the 1998's film's seeming lack of connection to the older films, the series has its own unique take on features associated with those films, features such as Monster Island, Mecha-Godzilla (a cybernetically-reanimated Godzilla which supposedly died at film's end, creating a loyalty conflict for its offspring), and a two-part episode in which aliens attempt to coopt the monsters of Earth in advance of a planetary invasion, a la Destroy All Monsters from 1968.

The series doesn't flinch when depicting consequences of the team's actions (even going to court at one point to defend actions which may have caused more public harm than good), or implications of the giant mutations' existence (mutations which could--and in some instances, did--kill people, given half a chance). And for all the headaches initiated by big monsters, human antagonists are, more often than not, bigger monsters than the mutated variety.

Sure, there are moments which strain credibility; a time travel trip to a post-apocalyptic future shows the ruins of a movie marquee advertising Ghostbusters 10 (?!), an episode claiming that a (monster-initiated) nuclear launch on Baghdad could result in retaliation and World War 3, is a real howler (as Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction), and a Mardi Gras-centered episode claiming to be set in the French Quarter looks more like rural Louisiana than New Orleans. And despite Randy's claims, the World War 2-era Navajo Code talkers were not used against Germany, but Japan. These are small nits, though, as the series is pretty good at getting real-life facts right, i.e., a dangerous, giant mosquito being identified as female (males don't bite), Loch Ness's actual geographical age going back to the last Ice Age, not the dinosaurs, and Monique's reference to Japan's anti-militaristic constitution.

These 40 episodes did much to remedy problems stemming from Roland Emmerich's take on Godzilla (I won't call it ""Zilla,"" the pejorative coined by diehard fans), and I highly recommend it.",1405209600,,3879,5.532883642495785

6245227,4,B00I099JZK,"Too bad the Dean Devlin/Roland Emmerich POS travesty was already in the can when this weekday afternoon series came along.  It showed us that, while this Godzilla certainly didn't LOOK like the one we knew from Japan, he had the same smarts and fighting spirit as his Nippon counterpart.  If the '98 film had portrayed their Godzilla like this show does I would have enjoyed the movie a LOT more, that's for sure!  Wasn't meant to be though and that's a real shame.

Oddly, this animated adventure is basically just a reworking of the classic 1978 Godzilla cartoon from Hanna-Barbera studios.  Many parallels can be drawn between the characters, scenarios and even some of the enemy monsters of the 78 show versus this series, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Actually, this show's biggest flaw is that many episodes feel rushed and are too short for any character development.  That's due more to the 20 minute window that syndicated shows have to live in now rather than the writing, IMHO

The shows look pretty good although there is some artifiacting (pixelation) because they crammed too many episodes per disc; this should have been a five or six disc set, but it is what it is. My biggest gripe is the shoddy, bargain basement packaging.  All four discs come stacked on a single hub so you can't flip through them, but instead must pull them all off the hub in order to select anything but the topmost disc.  Also, there are no episode listings printed on the individual discs nor on the box's slipart cover. Boo! Not a deal breaker by any means, (especially for the way cheap price for the entire series), but a pain nonetheless. Some reviewers here (one in particular) are waaay over the top hating on this show for really no good reason. Judge the series for what it is and don't lump it in with the lame movie that inspired it, because for the most part they are as different as day & night. (And again, you really can't go wrong for the price!) Godzilla: The Complete Animated Series is fun, harmless fluff entertainment. You certainly can do a lot worse when it comes to animated shows. I give it 4 stars. (4 for the show, minus 1 star for the craptastic packaging, but add another star back on because... hey, it's Godzilla!)",1404259200,4,2247,4.623115577889447

6245234,5,B00I099JZK,"The whole new version of ""Godzilla"" animated is in many ways not just direct sequels to the much maligned movie, but trumps it with 40 episodes. Done in a very nice style that isn't influenced by anime. Similar to ""MIB"" series, ""Big Guy & Rusty the Boy Robot"" and ""eXtreme Ghost Busters."" A nice animation style with nice detail beats hands down any of the really cheap animation of the late 1970's to 1980's. The stories are interesting too with different types of mutations, hostile locals and even aliens and various groups, including the US military, adding to the problems that HEAT faces around the world as the rise of giant mutations continues. The action takes place all over the USA, but also the world. Just as in XGB there is a time travel story into a bleak future where HEAT sees the aftermath of a new monstrous hybrid species that seems too well adapted to stop.

Good news! The two previous unaired episodes are part of it. Sadly there are no extras which is disappointing. However the four discs are packed tight so watch out when you open it. A little difficult prying them out. They probably found it was cheaper to stack them so be careful when you work to remove them. They are numbered so no problem there. No trailers or commercials so you don't have to wait long to get to the good stuff.  Now if they would only release those other three cartoon series I listed above and then I rest easy.

For the money a very good deal. Haven't seen this cartoon since it ran in 1998.",1403136000,,1536,4.534296028880866

6245257,4,B00I099JZK,"This series is one of the rare examples of an old gem getting saved from oblivion. Although the film this series followed up on, Godzilla (1998), was of debatable quality to put it lightly, this series was much more well received by the fans. Unfortunately it was at war with the popular Pokemon and Digimon anime at the time, and so sadly this show didn't get the audience for what could have been an even longer run. Still, what we got was a 40 episode, 2 season run that has stood the test of time with its simple but effective setup, memorable cast and quality animation.

The show was in limbo for 15 years, with only 9 episodes getting a minimalist DVD release many years ago, and those are long out of print. If you wanted to watch it you had to stream it or hope a friend taped it or something. A Netflix release was nice for those who had the service, but there was still something missing. Finally, in the wake of the 2014 Godzilla reboot, Godzilla: The Series finally got the full, 2 season DVD release we've wanted for so long.

The show follows the efforts of H.E.A.T. a team led by Dr. Nick Tatopoulos, tasked with researching and containing various giant monsters that have appeared in the wake of various nuclear tests, aliens, lab experiments gone wrong, or whatever sci-fi silliness they could cook up.  Also on the team are Elsei Chapman (sarcastic biologist), Mendel Craven (tech wizard), Randy Hernandez (playful hacker) and Monique Dupre (badass spy). The characters play off each other well, and each of them had a distinct, unique relationship with the others that helped the cast feel distinct and memorable. They aren't cookie-cutter science wizards, they all have their own reasons for joining the team and they all have their own problems.

Of course the most unusual member of the team is the titular character himself: Godzilla. Remember that last egg from the end of the movie? This is him. After the movie Nick and the army find the egg, and the baby 'imprints' on Nick before fleeing. He comes back fully grown and oddly friendly to Nick and his crew. Silly as that setup it, its all the excuse needed for HEAT and Godzilla to travel the world finding various monsters to fight.

And what fights they are. The writers knew what needed to be done to 'fix' the American Godzilla design. Godilla Jr. here is just as fast and agile as his Dad, but he's much tougher, allowing him to shrug off the army like the Godzilla we all know and love. He's also got atomic fire and he's quite smart too. A 'best of both worlds' arrangement. Many of the original monsters made for the show are quite fun and memorable as well: a Sphinx, Mechs, Aliens, even the Loch Ness Monster and Quetzalcoatl . Yes, Godzilla fights the Loch Ness Monster and Quetzalcoatl. And Its Awesome.

Everything is well animated the cast all look distinct, and the sound is great. it still looks and sounds good today. Episodes are mostly formulaic stand-alones with the basic plot of: ""Monster shows up, HEAT investigates,  calls Godzilla, FIGHT!"" It works quite well, and nearly every episode pits Godzilla against a wide array of giant monsters. There are MANY nods to classic Godzilla films here as well, with several monsters inspired by classic Toho Monsters. Quetzalcoatl=Rodan, Cyber-Zilla=Mechagodzilla, Giant Armadillo=Angurias and so on. We even get a robot yeti for a Godzilla vs. King Kong fight!

There are sadly no extras in the set at all, and the menus are very basic, with the only thing being to just play the episodes or select individual episodes. There are 4 discs with 10 episodes each, but the 4 discs are stacked on top of each other, which is a very poor way to stood discs. However, I can easily forgive this considering we FINALLY get the whole series on DVD for the first time after a 15 year wait. I never thought this would happen. All in all this is a fun show that should entertain all but the most vehement anti-1998 fans, and I'm happy to put it on my shelf with all my other Godzilla memorabilia.",1402876800,2,4026,4.628851540616247
6245258,4,B00I099JZK,"I actually never saw a single episode of this show in its broadcast run and decided to take a complete chance on this collection on account of the fact that 1) I was low on animation and could use something new to watch and 2) The price tag was unbeatable for any 4-disc, 40-episode collection (at the time I ordered it here on Amazon it was $7.99 though the price does tend to fluctuate frequently).

What can I say about the show itself that hasn't already been said?  Well for starters it captures the look and feel of the mid to late 90s contemporaries like Men in Black and Extreme Ghostbusters.  If this means nothing to you, think bright colors but a strangely realistic look to the characters especially.  You don't hear a whole about the process (and you certainly won't here either as this set is completely devoid of special features) but I suspect it was accomplished in some sort of rotoscoping technique.  The closest thing I can compare it to visually today would probably be the FX series Archer though that's not entirely accurate either.

Anyway, the plot centers on characters from the 1998 movie and, as cartoons so often do, takes a few liberties with the material to make it all episodic.  Godzilla, or in this case the offspring of the monster in the movies, is actually a misunderstood reptile with a heart of gold and unwavering devotion to  Dr. Nick Tatopoulos (voiced by Ian Ziering).  He, along with a few individuals of varying ethnicities, form the group H.E.A.T.; essentially mutant monster investigator and eliminators who travel the globe on an episode per episode basis.

In my opinion the formula works pretty well- despite what the cover may insinuate, this is actually a character-driven series with the titular character only making brief appearances when the group finds itself in over its collective head with a particular mutant menace.  The characters and acting behind them is all top notch; literally on par with a decent prime time live action drama for the most part and occasionally dipping into the realm of feature film territory (a reoccurring secondary character named Animal voiced by Joe Pantoliano lends to the finer details for example).

The show is structured to be mostly stand-alone plots, which is unfortunate as a wonderfully written and delivered 3-parter along the way provides a glimpse of what the show could have been had it been a serial.  Some of the plot threads are eerily similar to what one would have expected from then-immensely popular scifi cult sensation The X-Files.

As others have accurately stated, the set itself is quite bare-bones with no customization options for audio/visual presentation, special features or goodies to report here.  In fact you get 4 discs each containing ten episodes of the show.  Your menu options are either Play All or Episode Selection for each disc.  While this is a little disappointing, I suppose that such complaints are offset by the fact that at least we are given the show in its entirety on an official release (fans of Extreme Ghostbusters, for example, aren't so fortunate).  Plus, again, at the MSRP, one simply cannot expect a gorgeous, feature-rich box set.

All in all, I consider this a wise investment and am very pleased with the cost per entertainment value ratio.  The show's writing is solid, the animation impressive and there's enough content here to effectively eat up a good chunk or boredom for under $10.  I'd definitely recommend picking this one up, even if you aren't a fan of the film on which it's based.",1401926400,3,3546,4.857142857142857

6245260,5,B00I099JZK,"I loved this series. It did the 98 debacle justice.

This series was very similar to the Japanese series called Ultra Q and Ultraman, where a science team would investigate mutations that would appear. In this case, Zilla shows up to defend the team when the mutations get to much for them to handle.
There are a lot of great homages to the Japanese Godzilla movies.
There is a homage to Destroy All Monsters, Mothra, Rodan and MechaniKong.
The main characters were handled much better in this than in the movie.
The team is very likable and have great chemistry.
Zilla breathes blue fire and is fun to watch.
I recommend this set as it has all episodes including the unaired episodes.
The picture quality is great too.",1401062400,2,719,4.6171875

Including Junior the lone survivor at the end of the movie to the beginning of the first episode. The 1998 Adult Godzilla and the baby Godzillas looked a little like a typical Dinosaur.
