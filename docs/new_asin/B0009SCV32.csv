2318366,4,B0009SCV32,Criminally Insane is a great movie. I Consider it a drive in classic. Its funny and bloody. Satans Black Wedding is pretty good all things considered. Criminally Insane 2 is an unwatchable pile of crap. The special features are interesting and add to the dvd. Overall quite pleased,1402876800,,281,4.875
2318367,3,B0009SCV32,This is a very low budget project. The special effects are nothing to write home about and the acting is really bad. It's a drive-in style movie where you might look up from what you were doing on occation.,1396742400,,206,4.3076923076923075
2318368,5,B0009SCV32,Great movies lots of good actors in these movies this is really a must see movie for horror fans out there,1386288000,2,106,4.095238095238095
2318369,4,B0009SCV32,"I cannot believe I'm about to praise this movie, because it is a no-budget independent feature that is low-brow and amateurish. Priscilla Alden as Fat Ethel is amazingly effective as the recently-released psychotic who is released to a family member. Her appetite for food grows despite her families attempts to thwart her cravings. She will stop at nothing to feed her stomach. My favorite line is ""my heart is just fine as long as my stomach is not empty."" But, as the body count begins to rise, what will Ethel do with the bodies? It's distasteful but the story works well, and still manages to shock even in today's society.",1297814400,4,628,4.718181818181818
2318370,5,B0009SCV32,"The show ain't over until the fat lady kills! For me, this flick isn't scary, it's all about kicks! Get drunk with your buddies and enjoy! Criminally Insane pt. 2 is on this DVD too.",1249776000,3,182,4.228571428571429
2318371,4,B0009SCV32,"Nick Phillips is an interesting director. Here we have three of his horror offerings, none of which had any real budget to speak of. SATAN'S BLACK WEDDING manages to have a dark, sinister atmosphere, in spite of the decision to have it's satanic vampires wear plastic fangs from K-Mart. The ultra-cheap filming actually adds to the paranoia and bleakness of it all. CRIMINALLY INSANE is a well done shocker w/ Priscilla Alden running around murdering just about everyone! Her ""Big Fat Ethel"" character is a wonder to behold, as she stabs, hacks, and bludgeons the rest of the cast! People just seem to rub her the wrong way. Especially those who try to counsel Ethel on her dietary habits. Better to let this gal eat! Alas, this brings us to CRIMINALLY INSANE 2, a shot-on-video hack-job w/ no redeeming qualities whatsoever. After watching BLACK WEDDING and CRIMINALLY INSANE 1, I was extremely disappointed in this hideous waste of time! Oh well, the other two are worth the price of the dvd, and I can just pretend CI2 never happened...",1197244800,9,1039,4.810055865921788
2318372,3,B0009SCV32,"ok this review is on the FAT ETHEL CRIMINALLY INSANE films..

The first one didn't look like a home video but the second one did..

Ok just think of this.. a realy fat woman in a night gown goin' nuts eatin' chocolate pudding and killing people who dont' want her to eat..

end of story.. can't even remember how these films.. not sure if I watched all of either

Pretty sure they used red finger paint for blood..

and I specifically remember an insne scene in the second one (home video looking one) where Fat ETHEL was just sorta dancing around her front yard with a butcher knife all MAMA CASS style laughing for like ten minutes and then dropping the bloody knife into the ground.. and laughing at it.. that may be when I shut off the video!

BUT.. for some odd strange reason I still liked it all..

kinda like the spice girls.. no one wants to admit they liked them but they did.. don't lie.. you liked it! :)

So hit the crack pipe and enjoy..",1145664000,6,951,4.273743016759776

Through it all, I just kept wondering what it was like when craft services brought lunch to the cast and crew. My gawd, don't miss it!",1501113600,,260,4.117647058823529

8066295,3,B0009SCV32,I just finished watching criminally insane. Its not a bad movie it keeps your interest since she is so busy. The end was a surprise I never thought of that. I watched it on Amazon prime. Thank you Amazon.,1475366400,3,204,4.256410256410256
8066296,4,B0009SCV32,I didn't know what to expect with this film but I enjoyed it. NOT BAD!,1470441600,,70,3.7333333333333334
8066297,3,B0009SCV32,"Criminally Insane aka Crazy Fat Ethel is a bizarre San Francisco-shot low-budgeter ""famous"" among some of us for its  reappearance in the 80s in video stores, its box featuring Ethel (Priscilla Alden) wielding a meat cleaver and its content not failing to deliver. The gore is of course low budget as well but also strangely effective, the VERY red blood spilling from a fair-sized bucket all over any castmates who dare to come between released mental patient Ethel and her food  binges in her mother's house. ""What's the idea o' lockin' up all th' food?!"" growls Ethel early in the proceedings at her diet-planning mom, ""Yer tryin' t' starve me!!"" And you just know things are going to head downhill from there. The oddball acting seems to fit perfectly with the story, as we are nowhere near Hollywood here, but in a B-movie wasteland with rules, and attractions, all its own. Interestingly strange in the way that only truly independent films made on a shoestring can be, Criminally Insane has the added benefit of being shot on film before the video craze of the 80s took hold, giving it a sort of underground-arty look to add to the ghastly goings-on. Certainly worth a look for independent horror fans on the watch for weird rarities.",1469232000,,1241,4.794392523364486

8066300,1,B0009SCV32,"My review is not so much of ""Criminally Insane"", the film I bought this disc for, because I knew it was a terrible movie but very entertaining for those of us who like this type of humor. But it's the disc and case itself, that bother's me, unless I'm doing something wrong, and I don't believe I am, it only play's ""Criminally Insane"" and ''S.B.W"", in the directors commentary form. If this had been stated in the Ad or on the case I wouldn't have purchased it . So please be warned unless you don't mine comment's all threw the movie's, I wouldn't buy this.",1421971200,,559,4.333333333333333
8066301,5,B0009SCV32,"Fat Ethel ranks with tawdriness of the late great drag queen Divine, but FE is the real deal, a fat blob of female loathsomeness' let out of a sanitarium and finds alot of catching up to do with her skimpy diet from behind closed quarters enduring electro treatments that I'm sure pissed her off.
Her appetite runs wild with her new found freedom and will stop at nothing to attain it, including murder, lies, & robbery.
This is an hour long of low budget delight as the leading lady is one believable barracuda battleaxe who stomps around in bare feet wielding knifes & meat cleavers at all who stand in her way.
The production has a bloody intro to set up the colorful blood mass that lays ahead. It's truely amazing what can be packed in an hour what most movies, even in today's CGI, can't sustain in 2-3.",1421280000,3,809,4.436241610738255
