Would not recommend this video.",1274400000,,168,4.354838709677419
8166192,2,B000M4DBBE,"The idea for this video is cute and probably warranted.  The graphics are good, characters approachable.  However, there are basic violations of principles which renders it inappropriate.  Among other difficulties, for whatever reason the author, producer, director, etc. choose to use non-words and baby words like ""ducky"" and ""juicy"" instead of the proper  pronunciations. Had they actually combined the pronunciation  with spelling or phonetic units, the educational level would have been much elevated.  Other basic concepts are also violated.  Although the young ones enjoyed watching it, I won't let them watch it again due to the inappropriate lessons that are included.",1186012800,,677,5.643564356435643
