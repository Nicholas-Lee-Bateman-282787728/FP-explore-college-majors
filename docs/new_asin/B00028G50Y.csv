8023694,5,B00028G50Y,My kids love Boohbah for whatever reason. We ordered 3 different ones and they were totally excited!!!! We will order more!,1345075200,,123,4.904761904761905
8023695,5,B00028G50Y,The cousins of the teletubbies look quite like male genitilia and one dosent know if you are amazed or horrified. I have to say that when my daughter goes into a behavior this tv show will 90% assist in cooling her down. I recomend it. Even throw a party with your adult friends and have it the background.,1286236800,,306,4.293103448275862
8023696,5,B00028G50Y,"My grandson fell in love with this DVD when he was 1 1/2.  I have no idea how anyone came up with the concept of big colorful ""blob"" creatures that are apparently from outer space (?), but he is mesmerized by them.

This almost certainly appeals to the ""Teletubbies"" audience.

Each program has dances, is filled with bright colors, and includes segments in which the same human characters (Mr. Man, Mrs. Lady, Grandpapa, Brother, and Sister) interact.  There is narration, but no dialog. Don't knock it until you try it with your toddler!  I was amazed!  We've found it especially useful for ""calming down"" time prior to naps or prior to going to bed at night.",1228521600,2,661,4.655172413793103
8023697,5,B00028G50Y,My 2 year old twins love Booh-Bah and especially this episode. They find the humor in the strong willed little dog that  persists in sitting in the Comfy Armchair. The simpleness of the storyline entertains them. The love the color and the movement.,1125360000,,249,4.790697674418604
8023698,5,B00028G50Y,"My son is only 13 months old and Boobah is definetly his favorite cartoon, even knowing he is way below the age defined for this show: 3-6 years old. Boobahs are supposed to be atoms of energy, but I rather call them weird-looking-but-cute-things. I like that they incorporated the ""Storypeople"", who are people with familiar ""names"" like Grandmama, Grandpapa, Brother, Sister, Mr Man...

I also recommend parents to check out the pbskids.org website, where they have plenty of info on the Boobahs, especially the section for parents and teachers, where they explain who the Boobahs are and why our children can benefit from it.

My son loves the show and I do recommend the DVDs as well. He will probably get one of the other titles for Xmas this year.",1097366400,4,753,4.7846153846153845
8023699,5,B00028G50Y,"My son loves watching the Boohbas dance, and he thoroughly enjoys story people time.  However, whenever the ""Look What I Can Do"" portion of the show starts, he becomes instantly bored and either leaves the room or starts crying.  When we're watching Boohbah on TiVo, we always have to click past that part.  Well the beauty of this DVD is that none of the three episodes on it have the ""Look What I Can Do"" part!  Instead, it's included on the disc as a separate bonus feature.  Better yet is the fact that there's a ""Play All"" option which plays each of the three episodes in succession, which is even more convenient than TiVo, and makes this disc wonderful for long trips in the car or on the plane if you've got a portable DVD player.  I just ordered the other Boohbah DVD today!",1095465600,12,783,4.402777777777778
8023700,5,B00028G50Y,"Boohbahs are strange, I dare say even creepy looking...to ME.  My toddler, on the other hand, LOVES them.  They are these little globs of energy that dance and do silly routines, make funny sounds, and spread happy energy to children all over the world.  It encourages physical activity by imitation of the boohbahs themselves, and of the children in the ""look what I can do"" portion.  Then there are the comical skits with ""Grandma ma, Grandpa pa, Brother and Sister, Mr. Lady, Mr. Man, Auntie and little dog Fido"".  What a hoot!  This may be strange-looking stuff to us adults, but through a toddlers eyes, it's pure fun.",1093651200,5,623,4.722222222222222
8023701,4,B00028G50Y,"I think the boohbah's are a bit bizarre, but friends in England recomended it so we gave it a try.  My 18 month old is not into TV but he loves some Baby Einstein, Teletubbies and this. He even requests 'Bah-boo' if I turn on the TV.  I like it because he mimics the movements the Boohbahs do and tries to copy the kids in the 'look what I can do!' segment.  It is really good for his coordination.  He's also started saying 'Look what I can do' when he's showing off spinning or at the playground.",1089417600,5,498,4.103092783505154
