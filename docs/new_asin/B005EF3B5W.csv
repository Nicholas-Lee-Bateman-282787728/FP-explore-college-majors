4665136,1,B005EF3B5W,"I have a Sony BDP-S570 and it will not play this BD, though I can play it on one of my computers with a BD burner, using Cyberlink PowerDVD10.  I contacted Sony Canada and they did some research for me.  Turns out this BD is in 1080i50 format and Canadian Sony players do not support that format (they like 1080i60).  I was told that Sony had no plans to market a compatible player in Canada in the future.  So be warned: if you have a Canadian, and I suspect, US Sony BD player, you will not be watching this BD on your widescreen television, except via computer linkup, if your computer is capable.  My laptop, with a BD reader, wouldn't touch this BD either.  I suspect that is because there is an older, stripped-down version of PowerDVD on the laptop.

I have watched a couple of episodes on my main computer.  Not all that impressed.  Not much plot and lots of gratuitous sex and violence.",1348358400,,895,4.375757575757576
4665137,5,B005EF3B5W,"First let my start my review by saying that I had zero issues playing this DVD in my Samsung blu-ray player.  So if there are those out there who are on the fence about purchasing this series or not based solely on the play issues cited by the other reviewer then you should know that this item does in fact play on US blu-ray players.  I can't speak for US PS3 consoles since I haven't played the DVD's in mine yet, which is not surprising since I normally don't use my PS3 to play DVD's anyway so the likelihood of me playing it there is slim to none.

Getting to the show itself, Strike Back Project Dawn is the sequel to Chris Ryan's Strike Back.  Season 2 is a 10 episode action drama that you need not have seen season one to enjoy this season at all. The story primarily centers on the actions of Section 20, a secret branch of the British Secret Intelligence Service.  The most important members of this group are 2 likeable guys.  One of the guys is a British Sgt. named Michael Stonebridge played by Philip Winchester and the other is Damien Scott played by Sullivan Stapleton is a disgraced former U.S. Delta Force operative. Stonebridge is the more serious one out of the duo while Stapleton on the other hand is the impulsive one who seems to have no trouble finding fast women everywhere he goes.  Together the two get to have all the exciting adventures with fist fights, guns and explosions that any action junkie can appreciate.  There's also an interesting story going on for those of us who appreciate a good story with interesting-likeable characters.",1335312000,12,1571,4.5265017667844525
4665138,1,B005EF3B5W,"The discs will not play on my playstation 3, but I did some research on the subject. So the problem is not that the blu-ray is region specific.  I believe this series is actually suitable for all regions, unless you manged to get one that isn't.  Anyway, the problem lies in the disc format.  These discs are 1080i/50  which run 25 frames per second, which is cannot be played back on numerous players.  Only 1080i/60 (30fps) or 1080p/24 (24 fps) will run on certain players.  The list of players that will and will not play these 1080i/50 discs are here:

scroll down a little bit to the second post to see the list.

So, if you have a playstation 3 or any of the other players listed, these discs won't play.",1325548800,8,717,4.371212121212121

8468157,5,B005EF3B5W,"This title exemplifies the real life struggles of covert operational warfare. The 2 lead characters do all their own action scenes in this series,with no stunt doubles throughout. This series is a roller coaster thrill ride complete with adult (real life) vulgar language,intense violence,lot's of sexual acts,bare female flesh,hard drinking,graphic intense fighting,killing,anti-gay references and home theater quality soundtrack makes this series an absolute must see for any fan of the genre. Having said that,I must warn any individuals with a weak stomach or a weak mind need not bother to watch this as it will surely cause you to become violently ill or deeply offended.

8468158,5,B005EF3B5W,"For the confused: this is Cinemax/HBO season one, but the ""second year"" of Strike Back in the UK. UK year one is NOT available in a North American format.

While this series has some glaring flaws and inconsistencies, that doesn't stop me from loving it. Let's start with the problems. Virtually every episode has one or more shoot-'em-up scenes with a massive body count, often of a dozen or more, and the sequences are pretty much set up like the violent shooting video games that young people have been playing for the past 20 or more years (I assume it's thus being marketed to that audience). Also, there isn't much analysis of why the bad guys are THAT bad, and sometimes, the rationale can be pretty superficial - I thought this to be particularly true at the end of (North American) season two, though I'll offer no spoilers on that one. Finally, unlike, say, Game of Thrones, where ""anyone"" can die, we can feel pretty confident that the two protagonists are going to make it to the end of the season, so long as there are no problems with their contracts, or they don't drop this show to take on something even bigger (and this one is pretty big, mind you).

Now, on the positive side... It goes without saying that Philip Winchester as Stonebridge and Sullivan Stapleton as Damien Scott are absolutely inspired. This is a buddy show, and these two guys are perfect buddies in that time-honoured tradition - with Winchester the ""straight"" guy and Stapleton the ""loose (but dependable) cannon."" They are also allowed at times (never for long) to have fun, and that element of intermittent delight was never written into the (earlier) UK season one (see my review of Chris Ryan's Strike Back). As to the production budget, it's obviously of good size, and thus we are able to travel the world (literally) with our protagonists. The screenwriting is excellent, the dialogue regularly engaging and deeply insightful, and the soundtrack/music are state of the art - outstanding. The same goes for the cinematography/camerawork, and the Blu-Ray picture is crisp and clear (you will not get that in UK season one, which is equivalent in terms of the competency of its actors, but produced on a much lower budget). Finally, it should be obvious from what I have written that these are characters you will care about (Mr. Stapleton sustained a head injury in Thailand earlier this year, and I'm concerned for him in the same way I would be for a friend).... but, more than that, these are characters who will teach you about yourself and the world: that is, they often face moral dilemmas, and are able to handle them in such a way that it is necessary to reflect on one's own life and choices, and how we might measure up in the same circumstances. The moral dilemmas feel VERY real - they are not staged or strained, and the actors are at that highest level, in that they have the ability to take us to the unexplored places of our own lives.

In conclusion... this series (originating in the UK) was a surprise. I hadn't heard anything about it until seeing the first season blu-ray on display one day while shopping. So I'll rate this one my ""lucky find of the year."" (Last year, my lucky find was Orphan Black, so I think my standards are reasonably high.) If you can handle the extremely high body count, you will be rewarded with every episode. There is very little time wasted at any point in this series.

I see (North American) seasons one and two as of equivalent quality, and the characters only develop further with time. I note that this set is a UK Blu-Ray disc, which will certainly play in Zone B, analogous to Region 2 in DVD. You may need a region-free Blu-Ray player to make these discs work here, and it will take you some research to find one of those, particularly as some of them can reset to 1/A with a firmware update. Take care with your zones and regions.... My advice, just buy the North American set, which is labelled as Cinemax season one.

As an aside, UK season one (Chris Ryan's Strike Back) is NOT available in a North American format, but all the Cinemax/HBO seasons (starting with this one) are available in 1/A formats. (The present product is ""technically"" season 2 in the UK, though it is not labelled as such.)",1405123200,5,4253,4.62037037037037

8468161,5,B005EF3B5W,"This is a fun series based on real contemporay events, such as the bombing in Mumbai and the WMD's in Iraq. For a TV series I think the production is quite good although tongue in cheek in some of episodes. The titles are a little misleading since the Chris Ryan series preceeds Project Dawn and Project Dawn is called Series one. Series two, at time of writing, has not been released on DVD but will be shortly. Unfortunately, the distributor is not planning on releasing a Blu Ray version citing lack of demand by their North American distributor.",1356393600,,549,4.612244897959184
