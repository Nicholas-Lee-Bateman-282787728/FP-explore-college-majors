8656193,3,B00K62YQN4,"I love the film, which I would award 5 stars, but Amazon's description of this Blu-ray disc is wrong.  If you order this item, make sure that your Blu-ray player is region-free or is set up to play Region B discs.  It does NOT play in players coded to play only Region A discs.  Fortunately, I checked it the same day I received it, and I'm returning mine to Amazon.",1408665600,6,366,4.2
