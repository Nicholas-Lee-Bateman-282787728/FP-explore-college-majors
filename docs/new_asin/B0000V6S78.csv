1948494,4,B0000V6S78,"Two new artists break into the industry with a 1-2 punch. Amisha brings the simple and easily overlooked beauty as the ""girl next door."" Shahid adds his playfully boyish charm as the youngster in search for the ""perfect"" girlfriend. A huge misunderstanding keeps these two friends, then couple, from each other. Then, another comes along to make this a serious love triangle. The whole cast delivers hard and strong, which causes the film to do the same. A sweet and uncomplicated love story.",1259884800,,492,4.9397590361445785
1948495,3,B0000V6S78,"This is a sort of Bollywood meets 'High School Musical'- not that they modeled it on that but that is the pitch of it. It is college kids working out relationships - and a end of year dance the main star leads.
We have a self-centred, immature boy who judges relationships and love by who and what will bring him status among his male friends.
His friends are also selfish and superficial and see girls as a meat market (with put-down remarks for them being unattractive or carrying weight - yes India seems cursed with that problem too!).
As Bollywoods mostly can be relied on doing, the boy grows in understanding as he breaks one girls heart them gets involved with a 'high value' girl who doesn't really suit him - and finally becomes wiser and redeems himself!
The girl who has always loved him is played well by Amrita Rao. Also good is Vishal Mahotra who plays his friend.
This was the debut performance for Shahid Kapoor and he won several awards as best newcomer for it. It was made in 2003 which makes him about 22- though he looks more a fresh-faced late-teens.
He's a good dancer and there are some good dance scenes and some OK music. If you like him it is probably worth collecting though other movies such as 'Jab We Met' or the recent recommended 'Kismat Konnection' are a lot more satisfying (he also dances well in 'Chup Chup Ke' though I didn't like that overall movie much).
This is the sort of movie Shahrukh Khan used to do when a youth and if you are into the sort of youthful feel and plot of his old movies you may also like it.
Shahid is a trained dancer and moves well. He also has a radiant 'good heart' look to him that makes him nice to hang out with.
I like to think of myself as young at heart and I often like teen movies. This was a shade too pre-teen at times - though it did firm up as it went on.
btw There is an eccentric opening sequence with a hammy housemaid that goes on a bit. If this puts you off (I felt my heart sink at where this could go!), be reassured this is the only character and moment that goes for silly. This isn't comedy but teen romance.
Was OK to pass the time and see a bit of dance but not an exceptional Bollywood.",1231632000,7,2177,4.235576923076923

8003451,1,B0000V6S78,"This is like a trash version of High school musical. Trash talk about sex and girls wiggle a lot. Acting was laced with so much ham you would think it's a holiday dinner. I made it through half of the movie, I figured if it happened to get better at the end of the movie it still couldn't make up for the first half.",1444348800,,316,3.953125

8003455,4,B0000V6S78,"Cool movie. If you have nothing to do, watch this movie. This movie will neither make you laugh, nor will it make you cry. But you'll be smiling throughout the movie. This college romance flick is good for a lazy afternoon. Amrita Rao looks pretty and fits in perfectly in her character. Shahid Kapoor needs to watch his steps, all through the movie he tries to imitate ShahRukh Khan. Shahid, be yourself! Your way too good to be impersonating someone else. Shenaz needs to press down the attitude, you're just a newbie babe. Don't act like you've conquered Bollywood. You still have a long way to go. And yeah, What's with the weird accent?? And lastly, this review would be incomplete without mentioning Vishal who has done a wonderful job as a faithful Rambo! Also Satish Shah and Neelima Azim (whos Shahids real-life mom too) have done a great a job.",1304467200,,854,4.662251655629139
