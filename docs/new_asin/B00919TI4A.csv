5240937,5,B00919TI4A,"House of Anubis is a great show. An English mystery boarding school. The show is something different then the average Nickelodeon tv show. I pre-ordered the Volume 1 & 2 March 15th, 2013 and I received Volume 1 on December 3rd, but received Volume 2 on November 19th. I also uploaded pictures of Volume 1.

Nickelodeon please make Seasons 1 & 3 including The Touchstone of Ra on DVD soon!",1386115200,,388,4.542857142857143
5240938,5,B00919TI4A,"this is a great DVD, although beware that it does NOT have the full series and ends on a complete cliffhanger. other then that i would really reccomend this product to anyone and everyone who likes/loves house of anubis, the screentests are also a nice touch, overall a great product and i can't wait for season 2 volume 2 to be out!",1372896000,5,333,4.387096774193548
5240939,5,B00919TI4A,"This is a fun, wholesome mystery series that takes place in a British prep school; there's a bit of boy/girl stuff going on, but it's innocent, and the main focus is on the mystery story.  Of course, every episode ends with a cliff-hanger!  Thankfully, this series is far less dramatic and far more interesting than most American-made fare of this type.

This 3-DVD set, contrary to the Amazon description which lists only 15 episodes, actually contains 45 episodes (each a bit less than 15 minutes long), which is the first half, literally, of the complete 90-episode Season 2 cycle.

Also, IF (and only if!) you own a multi-region PAL/NTSC DVD player, this true DVD format edition is the one to get, as the one sold by Amazon direct in the U.S. is in the dreaded DVD-R format (which will NOT play in all DVD players, and is thought by most experts to have a relatively short life expectancy compared to a proper commercial DVD).  I purchased my copy of Anubis season 2.1 direct from Amazon.co.uk for a quite reasonable price.  Remember, this particular DVD set will ONLY play on a multi-region PAL/NTSC player, which is not the typical player one would buy in an American store.",1365120000,10,1180,4.703883495145631

5240953,5,B00919TI4A,"My 2 daughters, who were 9yr and 11yr at the time, and I actually started watching this show when it first premiered on Nickelodeon. We quickly started looking forward to each new episode that they started having every night during the week. For anyone who is not familiar with House of Anubis, it is about an American teen, Nina, who joins a group of students at a British boarding school where upon arrival one of the students has already been suspected missing. The school is run by a creepy caretaker who keeps a stuffed raven as his pet. The missing student's friend Patricia immediately suspects Nina has something to do with it. Nina meets an old lady who claimed she use to live at the Anubis house and she gives Nina a locket and tells her to guard it and that there is a treasure hidden in the house. Nina confides in a select few of the group of students and they see that the locket has powers and they have to figure out clues to the treasure. They form a group called Sibuna. The series ran for 3 seasons. My daughters and I never missed an episode. In my opinion it keeps you always wanting to find out what happens next.  The show is only a half hour long and with commercials even less. The dvd's are great they play one episode after another without commercials with the opening and closing credits dividing each episode. This dvd is half of Season 2 the other half is Season 2 Volume 2.  We have been waiting for this dvd to become available in the US.  I highly recommend this dvd for any House of Anubis fan.",1393891200,2,1529,4.3578947368421055
