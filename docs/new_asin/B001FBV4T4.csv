3585491,5,B001FBV4T4,"This collection of Academy Award-winning films is a striking vignette of how society has changed over the past century.  The relationships between men and women, gender roles, the haves and have nots, and the issues, actors, and themes that entertain the American public (and those Academy Award voters) are all here.

The films in this collection include:

- It Happened One Night (1934)
- You Can't Take It with You (1938)
- All the King's Men (1949)
- From Here to Eternity (1953)
- On the Waterfront (1954)
- The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)
- Lawrence of Arabia (1962)
- A Man for All Seasons (1966)
- Oliver (1968)
- Kramer vs. Kramer (1979)
- Gandhi (1982)

The epics, in my estimation, are The Bridge on the River Kwai, On The Waterfront, Lawrence of Arabia, and Gandhi.

But this is not a review of these particular films.  This is a review of this package of films.

Bottom line?  A bargain.  They are attractively and nicely packaged.  A number of the DVDs have extras included (not really my cup of tea).  This would be a very nice gift for a classic film aficionado, including yourself!  Enjoy.",1258070400,45,1110,4.5786802030456855
3585492,5,B001FBV4T4,"This is a set of 11 Best Picture winning movies from Columbia Pictures spanning the years from 1934 to 1982. Right off the bat you know you're are at least getting very good movies, if not great, because they all won the Best Picture Award from The Academy Awards - not Golden Globes or any other inferior type award organization.

As for for the movies I think they are all great. Lawrence of Arabia and Gandhi and arguably two of the best movies ever made. Someone said that Kramer Vs Kramer is a ""rotten tomato"" in the bunch of 11 movie in the set. I completely disagree. You can't compare Kramer vs Kramer with Gandhi or some of the other films in the set. That's not fair. Kramer vs Kramer is an excellent film - should it have won Best Picture? I don't no - maybe not. But it's still a terrific film

As for the price? Well it's an excellent value. If you bought all these films separately you would be spending at least $130 if not more. I definitely recommend this collection.",1257033600,17,984,4.342391304347826
3585493,5,B001FBV4T4,"I found this to be an outstanding collection of exceptional films.  I am not going to go through each one individually but let me just state that you cannot go wrong watching any of these 11 films.  They are all award winners for a reason and when you are watching them you cannot help but notice/see/feel/hear/sense their quality.  And the fact that they run the full gamut, in both terms of release years and genres, means that you will always find something in this collection to watch.  I am a big fan of boxed sets and this one really should be on the shelf of anyone who calls them self a fan of Hollywood studio movies.  In fact I hope the other studios (or the companies that now own the catalogs of the once great movie studios of days past) would follow this example and release similar sets.",1255910400,22,802,4.391891891891892

3585495,3,B001FBV4T4,"It's 30 years and I still hold a grudge against that wannabe flick- ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", included in this collection. Released the same year ('79) as ""Apocalypse Now"",  KvsK swept the Oscars in all major categories. Sure, Coppola's effort had its flaws, but even so, despite all the lavish eccentricities , it lost only by skulduggery. ""Breaking Away"" ,  ""All That Jazz"", even ""Being There"", all had more merit for the top honor in 1979 than the obnoxious Kramers. The snub of ""Apocalypse Now"" as well as the other fine films released that year is just another example in a long list of H'Wood inside fixes (see ""Raging Bull"" [and anything else by Scorsese] , ""Once Upon A Time In America"", eg).

The inclusion of this one rotten tomato in the collection knocks off 2.5 stars for me.",1253232000,16,783,4.659420289855072
3585496,5,B001FBV4T4,"I enjoyed this collection a great deal.  It's nice to have a wide range of films, including my favorites Lawrence of Arabia and Ghandi. I think this is a good collection for those who like classic movies.  My one complaint is that on the Lawrence of Arabia disc the movie cuts off suddenly when Lawrence and his attendants are crossing the Sinai and then when you put the next disc in about ten minutes later the Intermission starts.  I don't see why the first disc couldn't go up to the Intermission?  Still the product deserves five stars.",1233705600,52,541,4.546391752577319

By going back and checking extras on existing releases, this appears to be a repackaging of stock, with no new releases just for this collection. Also, this list of extras may be incomplete, because some films do have extras on their DVDs that are not listed in the product description I have seen. For example, the current release of Kramer vs. Kramer has a ""Making Of"" documentary that is not listed in the press release for this set.

This does appear to be a complete collection of Academy Award winners by Sony/Columbia, with the exception of The Last Emperor, which is currently on DVD via the Criterion Collection.

3585503,4,B001FBV4T4,"I will not be reviewing the content of the movies in this collection, as Amazon reviews are for reviewing the quality of products. If I were to review the movies themselves, I would be giving this product five stars since this is a solid collection with some truly fantastic masterpieces, which is great for any movie collector who doesn't own any of these yet.

This is a very fine collection that combines all of Columbia's best picture Oscar winners into a single set and it's bound in a very cool book-like casing that's visually appealing, though time will tell of its durability.
I do have one complaint however: the size. I would assume that anybody purchasing a collection like this is most probably a movie collector, so they probably have a whole bunch of movies to begin with, meaning, they would most likely prefer their movies to fit uniformly on their shelf. While the casing is very cool, it could've easily been made much smaller so as to be more in sync with all of the other dvds on my shelf, but the way it is just awkwardly sticks out and it was difficult to place with all of my other movies.

Otherwise, I'd highly recommend this product. It's very nice, it comes with some truly great movies, and the casing looks awesome even if it's a bit big and awkward.",1418256000,,1280,4.536796536796537

3585510,5,B001FBV4T4,"Continue to be amazed and somehow heartened by the number of people reviewing old movies--many of the Capra Classics still move HUNDREDS (In one case, over a thousand!) to share their feelings...about movies that are often over half a century old!  Wow.  (How many of today's comic-book movies will be so fondly remembered?)

About this package.  I haven't purchased it yet...but judging by the comments of others, this is a really fine collection, nicely packaged.

I have to disagree with negative comments re: Kramer VS Kramer. I remember this movie very well...and how edgy (to use the current term) it was back in the 1970s.  Divorce!  Child custody!  It was all just starting to happen very openly, and Kramer was on the forefront. The scenes in which Dustin Hoffman's advertising-man character loses his job (thus, is in danger of losing his child) and his frantic efforts to secure employment with a rival ad agency--he more or less accosted a Creative Director at an after-hours party--were burned into my memory.

3585516,5,B001FBV4T4,"We tend to forget what a distinguished history Columbia Pictures had in the golden years of filmmaking.  With 11 Best Picture wins, the studio was well clear of some of the more ""elite"" studios like MGM, Paramount, 20th. C-Fox and Warner Bros. in Oscar glory. Very meritorious when you consider Columbia was more or less a ""poverty row"" studio until the runaway success of Frank Capra's screwball comedies; two of which are in this marvellous collection.  Dedicated collectors have most of these films in different editions (including me) but to have them all in one very neat book-form type packaging contained in a handsome black box is a great idea.  Included with the discs are color poster reproductions, a nice array of mini photos, plot synopsis and a list of Oscar wins. ""River Kwai"", ""Lawrence"" and ""Gandhi"" each have two discs with stacks of extras included, making this a terrific 14-disc package.  With all these great movies complete in one box also makes it ideal for all of us who are trying to economize on space and with apologies to Mr. Capra,  this collection is so compact, you CAN take it with you!",1395360000,3,1119,4.77720207253886

I need the closed caption & subtitles since my daughter is deaf. The commentaries are from either the director a historian or the directors of photography the directors family or multiple commentaries. I was born in 1857, er, sorry-a bit latter but after  January of 1957 and I was not around for the premiers of all of these gems. ""It Happened one Night"" has marvelous commentary from Frank Capra's son who has a very gentle voice and a plethora of information, much more than you would expect. The film has awesome acting and it was one of Clark Gable's rare foray into comedy. MGM was punishing Gable for a pedantic reason (more than attitude but more like payback for an affair-not adulterous though) and after he won the Oscar he was barred from comedy which after seeing this film you will may agree that he should have done some more comedy. Columbia was considered an independent film company and the big 5 were RKO, MGM, Paramount, Warner Brothers & 20th Century Fox while Columbia, Universal & United artists were yet to surpass or at least rival them. I am a film fanatic which is odd since music is my passion. I find it very easy to write record and release an album and began with vinyl records-cassette tapes and now 11 CD releases (Amazon, I-Tunes etc) but writing a film narrative let alone filming one is very difficult for me, but by viewing masterpieces and independent films  is helping and this collection is a great help.
