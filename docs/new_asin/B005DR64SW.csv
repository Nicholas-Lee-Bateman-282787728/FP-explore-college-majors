8467333,2,B005DR64SW,"Without getting much into actual summaries and spoilers when I was underwhelmed by what this series had to offer for substance. The series ends leaving viewers with many unanswered questions about Ray's past and how she wound up losing her original eyes, or for that matter how she came to get the ones that are central to her abilities in the series. I also found the plot leaving much to be desired as it felt very disorganized and non-cohesive, not to mention that the animation quality varies widely. By and large, Rays' not the worst series you can ever see, but if you're expecting a good thrill with the medical aspects of the series let's just say it definitely doesn't take into mind real life.",1363478400,,703,4.632

The main character, Ray, was once a patient of Black Jack.  He gave her a new set of eyes with X-ray vision.  She has become a doctor of sorts, operating just on the edge of legality in a similar vein to Blackjack, although she does stay at a single hospital rather than traveling about.  Some of the cases have no basis in reality and others are exaggerated real conditions.  One of the major shortcomings of any Japanese drama or anime dealing the medical profession is the derth of real-world medical facts in the ailments, conditions, and treatments.

Nonetheless, Ray is an ethical doctor (most of the time) who takes on the cases no one else can solve and finds a way to resolve them.  Her one real desire, the one thing her eyes do not grant her, is the ability to read the human ""kokoro"", an idealized fusion of emotion, intellect, and spirit normally translated ""heart"".

The DVD collection preserves the Japanese dialogue and adds English subtitles, making it a reasonably good study aid for someone trying to learn conversational Japanese.",1322870400,8,1433,5.922330097087379
