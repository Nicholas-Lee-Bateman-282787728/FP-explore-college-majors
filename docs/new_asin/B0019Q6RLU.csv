But after only 5 minutes in I realized I'd seen it all before ( well 99.9% of it, FOR FREE ON YOUTUBE!!!!! Man was I upset, but if any you are Big Stones Fans like myself, there is a plus side, you have one more piece of 's history to your collection. But yeah folks, if you can find it new or used for under say $10.00 ( and it's not a burnt copy !!!!! ) then consider it, but if you just wanna see it, It's on YouTube in bits & pieces for FREE !!!!!",1508112000,2,526,3.834862385321101
8274974,3,B0019Q6RLU,"There's no denying the interest factor of seeing The Rolling Stones ""unfiltered"" hedonism, while on tour in 1972.  The musical performances are pretty incredible and this is a fractured backstage pass letting us witness their awesomeness up close. But between those moments, the movie is a sloppy, rambling collection that makes you wish it was less frustrating for us voyeurs. I often felt impatient waiting for the good stuff to happen.  I'm sure the Stones were horrified when they realized what the filmmakers had captured - some of it shocking, some of it sad, and none of it glamorizing being a rock star.  The video quality is awful, but tolerable.  All this whining is moot if you want to see the Stones behind the scenes, cause that's what this movie is.",1479081600,3,763,4.801526717557252

8274976,3,B0019Q6RLU,"Among Stones flicks this one is legendary and hard to find...which is why it is legendary, the content is nothing special. Crossfire Hurricane, Ladies and Gentlemen The Rolling Stones, Gimme Shelter, Charlie Is My Darling, Shine A Light, Some Girls Live In Texas all blow this away.",1409097600,2,282,5.0212765957446805
8274977,2,B0019Q6RLU,"Hello all,
While this shows all kinds of craziness, most of it was staged for the cameras. I would not buy this version. It can be had a lot cheaper and it won't be a reburn. As another reviewer noted, this may have been outrageous in 1972 but today? Not so much. That coupled with the fact that you can read about the tour in a number of different books and articles and it sort of makes this movie a waste.",1352764800,3,408,4.049382716049383
8274978,3,B0019Q6RLU,This was out back in the 80's on VHS. It was called Rewind if my memory serves me correctly. And it was nothing special then. Amusing. But nothing to get terribly excited over.,1277251200,,176,4.363636363636363
8274979,1,B0019Q6RLU,"This was probably a big deal 25 years ago. Now you will probably nod off. Endless boredom in hotel rooms- and it's black and white. This thing has been copied so many times you will be lucky to tell one person from another. Save your money, I'm sure the whole thing is on YouTube for free someplace by now.",1268006400,3,306,4.203389830508475

IS THIS A JOKE TO AMAZON CUSTUMERS OR WHAT? PLEASE BE CAREFUL BEFORE BUY THIS ITEM TO THE SELLER JFA42, IS NOT SERIUS THAT AMAZON HAS THIS KIND OF UNFAITHFUL SELLERS.",1260403200,13,303,4.428571428571429
8274981,5,B0019Q6RLU,"A graphic, behind the scenes look at life on the road with the Rolling Stones during their 1972 US tour. No holds barred and not for the squeamish. Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll to the max!",1224892800,4,188,4.108108108108108
8274982,4,B0019Q6RLU,"First of all, it's rediculous to pay $130 for this ""movie,"" because it really ain't worth it.  Keith shoots heroin, Mick and Bianca quibble, Keef & Bobby Keys throw a TV out the window a couple of stories up, then there's that scene on the airplane with that groupie.  If you have to inquire about THAT, just go back to your Def Leppard or Motley Crue paraphenalia.  But that's really...all there is.  And secondly - again -  why pay $130 for this, when it's EASILY available stateside and in commensurate quality for $12 elsewhere?",1219449600,18,532,4.617021276595745
