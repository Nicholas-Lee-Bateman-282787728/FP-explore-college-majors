8452028,1,B0050WD75S,"I wish I went to IMDB and read the review published there. It says something like ""avoid the horribly cut 2 hour version at all cost"". Right on!

The complete version of this movie is something like 4 hours. This... I do not know who had the brilliant idea they could chop it down to 2 hours, but it is just grotesque! Dialogs come at you at a pace of a supersonic jet fighter on meth. They are chopped up, so there are holes in them and themes and topics come out of nowhere. The plot line is similarly chopped up. Acting appears to be rushed. I could not understand what some fragments were doing there.

I made an observation that very often I get a very negative impression of a movie after watching the commercial. Something about how advertising people do material selection just disagrees with me. This ""movie"" feels like a really bad commercial for what may well be a very decent movie, although I suspect I will like Bortko's version better still. There are a lot of great actors cast in this movie and as far as I can tell most of them perform quite well, but not all. Lack of original music score is hurting. Familiar music and the location/decorations for the Satan's Ball make the scene too earthly. Some effects are quite cheap and cheesy, regardless of budge limitations. Other than that, I would want to see the complete version. Too bad I cannot find it anywhere in the US.

Unless you can get your hands on the full version, I strongly suggest getting Bortko's movie instead.",1321833600,,1493,4.481617647058823
