6652532,5,B00NGL7J9U,5 different Nickelodeon shows. Grandkids 1 and 3 love it. The 7yr old will watch too.,1434758400,,85,4.375
6652533,5,B00NGL7J9U,"I bought this to give the kids something new to watch and that was related to Spring.  They ended up taking turns with a cold or the flu so they had to be cooped up for a few days.  They really liked the shows and having a variety like this keeps them happy.  Personally, I find the Wonder Pets a little annoying but since the kids like it I can tolerate the show.  I love that it has Bubble Guppies and Team Umizoomi on one disc.  There are not many out there with both of those and those two are high on the favorites list for the kids.  All of the shows were cute and inspired them to talk about learning aspects (especially Blue's Clues for some reason).",1430092800,,658,4.1015625

6652536,5,B00NGL7J9U,"My grandaughter (5 years old) & my greatgrandson (21 months)  LOVE watching DVDs in the car! They really like to have DVDs that reflect more than one subject (especially when we're on a long drive. It keeps them happy & quiet & we're ALL happy that we don't have fussing kids wanting to know ""are we there yet?""). Even for short drives in the city, the DVDs keep them entranced & happy. I also will bring the various DVDs in their house or mine when they're tired of playing with all of their other toys or when I want them to sit down & relax.",1428796800,,544,4.180952380952381

6652538,5,B00NGL7J9U,"With the crazy weather we have been having it has been nice to have this DVD on hand to get us in the mood for springtime.  There are seven episodes on this DVD that all feature fun stuff surrounding around springtime.  I love that it features a variety of characters, especially ones like Wallykazam and Wonder Pets which we never catch live on television anymore.  The episodes are all previously aired on television but it is nice to have them on all on one collection.

Wallykazam! "" Picnic: Impossible""

Bubble Guppies ""The Spring Chicken is Coming""

Team Umizoomi ""Umi Egg Hunt""
