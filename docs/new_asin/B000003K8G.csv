7902846,4,B000003K8G,"The Klingon Empire wants Worf to stand trial for murder and ""Rules of Engagement"" deals with the extradition hearing that follows.  Worf was captaining the Defiant when it escorted a Cardassian relief convoy that was attacked by two Klingon warships.  When a third vessel started to uncloak, Worf opened fire and destroyed a transport ship carrying civilians (Klingon civilians, no less).  Interestingly enough, Worf is charged with ""knowingly"" destroying the civilian transport, which is rather hard to do since it was decloaking at the time, but what the heck.  ""Rules of Engagement"" is a slightly below-average episode of DS9 in which the performances are all fine, but the storyline does not hold together if you look at it too closely, especially from the Klingon point-of-view.  The episode does underscore the lovely animosity between the Klingons and the Cardassians, who really do not like being enemies of the same enemy, the Dominion.",1000425600,2,945,5.231788079470198
7902847,5,B000003K8G,"Sure, Deep Space 9 was not your typical Trek series, it played around with the traditional format and was innovative with its structure, such as in this episode through the use of Worf's trial. Though this episode is not part of the larger story, it is emblematic of the series' willingness to throw the traditional Trek structure in its head. This innovation might be seen as a failing by some, but they simply may not have the necessary attention span to keep up with a story for longer than sixty minutes. All others, please feel free to buy this video and enjoy it along with the rest of this excellent series. You'll be able to watch it and enjoy it again and again. This is one of the series' many fine hours, including the finale.",981676800,10,737,4.466666666666667
7902848,5,B000003K8G,"This is perhaps the best DS9 episode of the series. (Not counting any two  - parters, or extended story lines.) In this episode we get a feel of how  the war is going and also a glimpse into the difficulties of command. I  currently serve in the military and I know how often it is hard to make  those life and death decisions in a heart beat. I belive this episode gives  you great insight into the characters of Worf, Sisko, and O'Brien and also  Worf and O'Brien's relationship. Overall a great episode and it was  directed by LeVar Burton.",968198400,9,543,4.37
7902849,2,B000003K8G,"The war between the Federation and Kligon Empire is claiming more  casualties, one of them a freighter carrying Klingon civilians, any attack  on these such transport low-risk vessels is prohibited, and so the Rules of  Engagement explores what is right and wrong in war and ultimately how Worf  is framed for the murder of several dozen innocent Kligon's.
Worf gave  the order to fire on the frieghter and thus must face trial. An  hit-and-miss episode that is like so many Star Trek court stories that have  gone before it... the good guy is always innocent.",966729600,3,560,4.831578947368421
