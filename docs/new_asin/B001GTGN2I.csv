8307011,5,B001GTGN2I,"Wow Wow Wow !! Words can not express the joy of hearing The Ventures with such clarity & the quality. It is so clear you can count the  knotches on Gerry McGee's belt along with alot of other things that I was missing watching u tube videos. There is NO substitute. IT IS TRULY A FRONT ROW CONCERT SEAT & I WAS THERE DROOLING !!! This is a MUST ! Songs you will not find but , there on this DVD.

I think I need to order a back up, I see myself wearing this one out.",1407888000,2,663,3.8394160583941606
8307012,4,B001GTGN2I,"Strange having Nokie on the cover of the DVD when he's not in in it. The lineup on the cover is the modern one, not the band tha appears on this particular tour.",1391385600,2,161,3.909090909090909
8307013,1,B001GTGN2I,"This is so obviously a bootleg copy of the Japanese Toshiba-EMI release.  The line-up for the band in 1993 was Don Wilson, Bob Bogle, Mel Taylor and Gerry McGee.  The photos on what passes for cover artwork on this issue shows Don Wilson, Bob Spalding, Leon Taylor and Nokie Edwards - and the photos are from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2008.  Don't buy this.  I am The Ventures' manager so you can believe what I write.",1375833600,6,445,4.390243902439025
8307014,3,B001GTGN2I,"If you're a Ventures fan, it's a good DVD. The video and audio are nothing special, but after all, it was recorded in the 90s.",1366156800,,126,4.08
8307015,5,B001GTGN2I,I have known about the Ventures for a long time.  A friend of mine used to be their stage manager back in the 70-80s and had nothing but praise for them.  But I recently ran across the Ventures on YouTube and saw what I had been missing all these years.  Then I found this DVD with nearly everything good they have ever done.  One can tell the Japanese LOVE them just by watching Caravan at the end!!  And the people in the U.S. also give them credit for being some of the best guitarists ever.  They make even Chet Atkins proud!  I can highly recommend this DVD.  It conveys both their talent and their warmth.  Really GOOD guys!!!,1365897600,4,632,4.288135593220339
8307016,5,B001GTGN2I,"I ordered this dvd for my husband and he loved it and has watched it several times since then,  a great addition to our DVD collection.",1361750400,,135,4.1923076923076925
8307017,5,B001GTGN2I,Can't really comment as this was bought for someone else as a Christmas gift. I'm sure it's being enjoyed as I type this!,1356825600,,121,4.304347826086956
8307018,5,B001GTGN2I,"One of the best surf music groups,(if not the best),of all time. I graduated from high school in 1963,and still remember how great the instrumental ""Wipeout"" sounded. Then there was ""Telstar"", ""Hawaii Five 0"",and others. They are in a class of their own,buy the dvd and enjoy.",1355788800,,276,4.8936170212765955
8307019,5,B001GTGN2I,"The cover is miss-leading in that Nokie Edwards is not in this video; this was one of the tours in which Gerry McGee replaced Edwards; that's not really a problem because McGee is a great player. If you like the Ventures, you should be pleased with this DVD.  You got to love these guys; they did it without drugs, scandals, smoke, mirrors, stage flame throwers and gimmick costumes.",1354665600,4,383,4.632352941176471
8307020,5,B001GTGN2I,"Hello All....I never thought I would review a DVD but here we go. First, this is one terrefic DVD !! The color, photography and sound are uniformly excellent quality !! The photo artwork on the cover of this dvd is a bit misleading. The people pictured on the artwork are NOT all playing on this DVD. The people that perform on this DVD are as follows:
Mel Taylor...one GREAT Drummer
Bob Bogle...Bass Guitar
Don Wilson...Rhythm Guitar
Gerry McGhee...Lead Guitar (Nokie Edwards is pictured on the artwork)
  Gerry McGhee plays a great lead guitar and works well with the other group members. At times Bob Bogle and Don Wilson share lead guitar duties and are truly terrefic. I believe that this particular dvd is the best Ventures DVD available at this time. Buy it and you will not be disappointed !! Great Show !!...Donald R. Brady Jr.",1232755200,18,836,4.719178082191781
