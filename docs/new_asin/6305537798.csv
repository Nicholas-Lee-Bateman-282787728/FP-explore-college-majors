I watched some of the extras & they mentioned the school that totally looks like a castle fortress is a real building they filmed at--really? And it's not too far away, I'm gonna have to check it out. The guidance counselor that writes graphic romance novels--hilarious. I like that it was Bianca (the younger sister) that got to avenge, well everyone, by beating up the jerk. They didn't have someone come to her rescue. I cry a little when I watch it because I remember Heath is not with us anymore & that makes me sad, he was just brilliant & charismatic. Good fit w/Julia Stiles for this part.

1049601,5,6305537798,"For all of us Shakespeare nuts, this is just brilliant.  It's the story of The Taming of the Shrew, set in the 1990s at a high school named Padua instead of a location.  It follows the play almost perfectly, and is a great companion to the play to help understand the story.  I remember watching this in High School after reading the play and thoroughly enjoying it.

If you've never read Shakespeare and never intend to, this is still a great movie.  It's humorous and fun, to be sure!  Cameron, the new kid in town, falls for a young girl named Bianca, who has a devilish sister named Kat.  Their father absolutely refuses to allow Bianca to date until Kat does, but the problem is that NOBODY at Padua High School wants to date the ""shrew.""  Cameron and his trusty sidekick build a scheme around Heath Ledger's character, and a pretty boy who is also after Bianca in order to get Kat to date and therefore allow Bianca to as well.

The story can only be given credit to the illustrious Shakespeare, but the delivery and representation in modern times is truly spectacular.  Very few quotes from The Taming of the Shrew are used, and when they are it's as a joke.  It captures the oddities and awkwardness of high school and the desperation a single father will do to try and protect his children from the madness of an unhealthy world.  Complete with a great message about how reputations are only skin deep, this is a great teen comedy that fits well on any DVD shelf.",1494115200,,1472,4.47191011235955

1049658,3,6305537798,"1: It's the late 90s. The crop tops are awful.
2: It's not as good as you'd expect, considering it's based on a famous play and has a good plot and real potential. Only the main couple are really explored.
3: It's not as bad as you'd expect, considering it's chock full of childish dirty jokes and potty language.
4: It feels way too short. We need to know all these characters more.
5: Heath Ledger makes it worth it. He owns every scene he's in. Wonderful screen presence.
6: Julia Stiles does a good job on making  a spoiled feminist halfway likeable.
7: Heath and Julia come across as a real couple. Girl who thinks she's tough ends up falling for guy who's a lot better at navigating bars than she is. They manage to make this movie still relatable-- the dated 90s eye rolling, nerd jokes, and teen stereotypes are like a brick wall between us and the characters, but something about Heath and Julia's attraction to him manages to surmount that wall, and make the viewer feel involved.
8: The famous ending speech works well. A good improvement on the original lines where Katherina states she is forever submissive to Petrouchio. It proves  that she has changed for good ( become less of a hater) without being pushed around.
9: The cranky schoolteacher is a sort of fantasy for actual teachers, saying the stuff they would never actually say. But his lines get over the top.
10: Heath Ledger. Have to mention him again. He makes it work.",1488844800,,1444,4.528735632183908

I have a teenage daughter and she thought the movie was great, and it was the starter of a great conversation of which sister she may want to be, and why? It's no surprise that I'm a fan of teaching someone how to be true to themselves, and what they want--despite peer pressure--and I think she got that message.

1049718,4,6305537798,"Shakespeares play, The Taming of the Shrew, was written in 1590, four centuries before the film 10 Things I Hate About You was released. Even with the sizable time difference, there are many things that remain constant between the two, including the way the characters are perceived and the harsh societal norms placed upon women. Its no secret that conventional, pure, shallow girls are loved and sought after, while independent girls with with loud opinions who refuse to follow the societal norms are often perceived as crazy and unreasonable. Gil Jungers 1999 film 10 Things I Hate About You, rated PG-13, produced after the first and second wave of feminism, reminds us of this theme throughout the movie. In this fictional film, a modern day adaptation of Shakespeares The Taming of the Shrew, Kat Stratford is often mocked and not taken seriously while Patrick Verona is seen as the man, a model for masculinity, and admired for his ability to get Stratford to fall in love with him despite her reputation as a shrew. I believe 10 Things I Hate About You is a spirited film that anyone could enjoy, despite having the formula for a typical and cheesy high school film.
The story takes place in 90s Seattle suburbia, at a typical all-American high school where kids live lavishly and navigate their way through high school with all the stereotypical high school cliques.  The film begins with Cameron James, a new student, getting a tour of his new school. He automatically spots Bianca Stratford, one of the most sought after, and unavailable, girls at Padua High. Bianca is unable to date, and so is her shrew of a sister, Kat Stratford. Kat, the protagonist of the film, loves indie rock and feminist prose and hates conformity. When Bianca begins to complain about being forbidden from dating, her father decides to change the house rule: when Kat dates, Bianca can date. In order for Cameron to get a date with Bianca, he has to find someone willing to date Kat, which he soon discovers is not an easy task considering her reputation at Padua High.
Camerons new friend Michael helps him obtain the help of Joey Donner, the run-of-the-mill pretty-boy jerk. Michael convinces Joey that if he finds a date for Kat, then he would be guaranteed a date with Bianca.  Joey picks Patrick Verona, a bad-boy with questionable morals and a sketchy reputation. Joey agrees to pay Patrick to win Kat over, but knowing Kat, will Patrick be able to win her heart? Will Cameron get his date with Bianca? Or will it all go south?
In this movie we see the typical good-girl, the typical outcast girl, the attractive jerk, and the father that is over concerned with his daughters relationships: the formula to a classic high school movie. To capture Kats anger, the writers turned her into a feminist, societys equivalent to the angry/bossy b*tch. While I usually appreciate a female character that knows what she wants, doesnt take crap from anyone and aims to smash the patriarchy that supposedly dictates her world, Kats character is slightly unreasonable considering she is an upper-middle class white girl. While I am not saying that she does not face patriarchal values throughout the movie, because she definitely does, I feel like her character was too angry all the times at situations that did not require anger. As for Bianca, she was the cookie-cutter pretty girl at her school, her biggest concern being the only sophomore to get asked to prom and to lock down a pretty boy.
My main problem is that the only vocal feminist in the film is portrayed as undesirable and b*tchy, creating the sense of essentialism and the idea that these are the characteristics that automatically come with being a feminist, giving little room for individuality. Feminism frequently pushes young women to have more confidence in themselves and their intelligence, making them stray away from the idea that beauty is the most important attribute to have. Despite all of this, Kat is portrayed very unconventionally and does not give into what is expected to her as a woman. She was an independent and intelligent female lead, which is not something all too common at the time of which the film was produced. Overall Id say that this film tried to stray away from the typical high school comedy formula, and almost succeeded, if it had not been for the ending in which Kat somewhat gets rid of the principals that she had at the beginning of the film.
10 Things I Hate About You still remains an interesting movie, even though its somewhat predictable one, that offers, at least initially, interesting, unconventional characters. If you're looking for a slightly less-typical high school movie, then this is the one for you. Its nothing revolutionary, but it is a fun film to watch that makes good use of its source and inspiration.

1049761,2,6305537798,"This is 100% a chick flick movie. High school drama, who should the main character girl date, ""hilarious"" hijinx. To most men, this movie would bore you to tears, unless you're hoping the girl you're watching it with will... continue to hang out with you after it's over. It's also a glimpse into the world of the 90's - very much from that decade. Probably one of the more notable reasons to see the movie is because one scene features the Fremont Troll in Seattle, but I imagine that a clip of that scene can be found on Youtube. If you're a guy by yourself, I'd say skip this one.",1484524800,,583,4.3090909090909095

1050134,5,6305537798,"I can't say enough good things about this movie. I do remember the first time I saw it, coming away thinking that I wanted to be just like Julia Stiles' character in it, though.
She was so cool and did such an excellent job in her role, that still to this day I consider her to be the coolest teen in any 'teen movie'.
Basic Plot: Cameron (Levitt), a new student at Pagua high school, falls in love with a sophomore named Bianca Stradford (Oleynik).
However, Bianca has a flirtatious crush on the most popular senior at school named, Joey (Keegan). Cameron's sidekick Michael (Krumholtz)tells him, that Bianca is looking for someone to help her with French and Cameron decides that's how he'll ask her out on a date.
Kat Stradford (Stiles) is Bianca's sister. Totally opposite of Bianca, she is anti-social and is the most feminist high school senior you could ever meet. Against boys, dances, and anything having to do with prepiness and silly fun, she swears off dating and finds herself being accepted to Sarah Lawrence a college across the country in hopes to get away from her father and the city she lives in.
Bianca desperately wanting to date, is told by her father (Miller) that she will be allowed to date when her sister Kat does. Desperate and not knowing how to get her sister to 'date for her', ends up asking Cameron, her new French tutor, to help her with her predicament. Enter Patrick (Ledger). An outcast and rumored to have sold his kidneys on the black market for a new set of speakers, also attends Padgua high, and is unsuspecting of what will happen soon in his future.
Cameron and Micheal decide that in order to make this work, they need a backer. ""Someone who's stupid, but has money."" So they go to Joey, telling him that they know he likes Bianca, and they need him to pay Patrick a tidy sum, to have him date Kat, in order for him to date Bianca. What Joey doesn't know, is that Cameron secretly plans to date Bianca, while he pays Patrick to take out Kat.
It may sound like a very confusing movie. But it is so funny, cleverly written, and not entirely true of American teenage culture, but pretty close. The acting is wonderful and in my opinion nothing in the movie would have worked as well, without the people who played their characters. As I said before I think that Stiles' portration of Kat Stradford was right on, and no one could have done it better. Her best role, more than certainly, and I love this movie so much! I would have to say it's my favorite teen comedy next to The Breakfast Club. One the best movies, and a great watch!",1474243200,4,2575,4.480851063829787

We felt it was mostly suitable for our 8th graders to watch. It's certainly not the first/last ""boy paid to date girl...falls in love...she finds out...etc."" plot. Heath Ledger plays it well though. Not my genre of film, and yet I've seen it at least 5x over the years. Very good movie overall for what it sets out to be.",1468627200,,592,4.584905660377358

For a teen movie it was a cut above some of the cheese of the era despite its predictable but likeable plot.

Some become instant classics, some cult classics & some go nowhere!  ""10 Things I Hate About You"" while coming out in the late 90's is as ageless as its inspiration Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew!!!  It can be proudly claimed by that generation...but notice no Cell Phones & other than a few small things there is no iconic imagery tying this movie to a time frame or generation.  The theme is eternal shattering all time barriers, its hard to beat  "" true love"" for a theme!!!  The stars certainly aligned when making this movie both in the Astrological since & the literal with break out performances from young stars that would grow to be endearing to the entire world!!!  I bought this for my daughter who quickly convinced me to get this specific Anniversary Edition because of its bonus features & being a huge Shakespeare fan & loving "" 10 Things I Hate About You"" it didn't take much convincing on her part !

This movie is only useful because I can understand my new programmers coworkers better.  Being right out of school, their behavior is more like ""did you say hi to me?...  Do I know you?...  What is in it for me?""  Not caring about the things they create.  Instead of hoping for changing the world for the better, it is more like, ""Gain the max advantage for himself or herself, hold on to the power as much as possible, be as selfish as possible, and bully if they can, just for fun, or bully first, so that they don't get bullied.""

 It doesn't take itself too seriously and is actually a lot of fun to watch. I'm a supporting cast buff, and the supporting cast members in this movie, were fantastic!

Were Shakespeare immortal - and some say he is - oh the residual fees he'd be raking in. Him and Jane Austen. And not that it matters but the scene sets itself in Seattle, Washington where popular sophomore Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) is presented at the height of her high school charms. She longs to test the dating waters. Except she's inhibited by a super-protective dad who glances over at his moody, insubordinate older daughter Katarina (she's 18 and played by Stiles) and capriciously imposes a rule: Bianca shan't ever date until Katarina nabs a sweetheart of her own.

Here's Bianca, her vexation surging to new heights. See, Katarina is a social pariah, a senior with a surly demeanor and an arsenal of cutting rejoinders. Kat beats to a different drummer. Her jams are indie rock and feminist prose and being non-comforming. Dudes be terrified of Kat; they simply don't want to be the subject of one of her caustic barbs. And here's newcomer Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who's been to nine schools in ten years and is crushing hard on Bianca. We the theater audience should thank Cameron. He serves as the plot's impetus. It's he who gets the ball rolling. Believing he's got a shot awith Bianca - she may or may not have led him on - he sets about collecting various suitors for Kat's heart. Ah, man, but the pickings are slim. Kat is that scary.

Now consider churlish loner Patrick Verona (Ledger), around whom a grip of rumors abound. It's said he did a year in San Quentin. And that he sold his liver on the black market for a set of speakers. He ate a live duck once (everything but the beak and feet). Yeah, Patrick is willing to have a go wooing the nasty-tempered Katarina. For a price.

Before I forget, do stay at the end for the hilarious outtakes. 10 Things I Hate About You, equal parts scathing satire and dizzying romance, is the movie that put Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles on the map. It established Ledger as a legit teen heartthrob. There's an assortment of inevitable themes and beats here that you'll find in lesser rom-coms, except this movie executes its tropes with wit and style and an irrepressible lightness about it. What also sets this one apart is Stiles and Ledger's tempestuous chemistry. I remember Stiles' infamous heartbreak poem and Ledger's marvelous act of atonement as he serenaded Kat with ""Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You"" while campus security chased him in the stands. But there's also Allison Janney's droll turn as the erotica-writing school counselor. And I love how there's depth to Patrick and Katarina, but especially Katarina. Once upon a time Kat used to be popular, and I appreciate that there's a solid back story to go into why she changed. 10 Things I Hate About You is old enough now that it can be viewed as a nostalgic watch. Except when you do watch it, you realize how contemporary it still is. It's a testament to the longevity of William Shakespeare. Each time I sit down to a Shakespeare adaptation, I'm struck with the commonality that threads us with them what populated the 17th Century. By the way, when I first saw this movie, it took me half an hour into it before I realized that wasn't Melissa Joan Hart as Bianca.",1455580800,,3912,5.196513470681458

I'll suffice to say that it is a cheesy late 1990's romantic comedy. Acting is not spectacular and the plot is quite predictable and corny. However, as a child of the 90's, I really enjoy those types of movies sometimes. It's a pretty fun movie with a mix of light-hearted humor, teen angst, true love (as every teenager imagines it to be), and character transformations. This is not a movie that was an Oscar contender, but it is an enjoyable 90-100 minute film.

I watched it again to see Heath Ledger, R.I.P. This was his ""teen heart-throb"" film, which he apparently tried to get out of that typecast for the rest of his career. In it, he plays a bad boy sort-of turned good by the end.

The character of Kat is refreshing. She's a teen girl who doesn't want to conform to the pretty/popular standards, and just wants to focus on schoolwork and do her own thing. By the end, she becomes more balanced and social, learning that it's okay to trust others sometimes and let her hair down a bit.

This is a sharp, witty teen rom-com, risqu but not raunchy. There are some predictable tropes but for the most part the characters react to situations the way normal people would. Some of the themes/messages seem a bit dated fifteen years later, or maybe I'm just old enough to wince when the guy accuses the girl of being ""selfish"" because he's done all these nice things for her and she still doesn't want to date him. Yes she is selfish, but it's still not a great message when he wins her in the end. A bit more character exploration there would have helped. Never mind: the girls are still well-rounded, autonomous in their own right characters. I've watched this five times this year and still enjoying it.",1444348800,6,874,4.537974683544304

1051594,5,6305537798,"""10 Things I Hate About You"" is a star-studded comedy about life, love, and the stereotypical hardships of high school. Young Bianca Stratford is the object of every guy's affection, including new kid Cameron James and arrogant teen heartthrob Joey Donner. The complication? Bianca isn't allowed to date unless her older, tough as nails, feminist sister Kat does. A deal between Cameron and Joey leads to Kat ""dating"" school bad boy Patrick Verona. All's fair in love and war, and chaos ensues as the interested parties attempt to navigate the unintended consequences of their botched scheme. A list actors (including the late Heath Ledger) and a rocking soundtrack makes this one a comedy to see. :-)",1437350400,,701,5.051724137931035

1051867,5,6305537798,"Suprisingly, I unexpectedly came across this dvd of 10 Things I Hate About You at my Walmart job after searching for another dvd.  For some reason, I felt drawn to this movie even though I obviously graduated from high school quite some time ago (class of 2000).  There are multiple celebrities attached to this film (information available online from both wiki and the Internet movie database) and the movie centers around a popular and charismatic female named Bianca Stratford  (Larisa Oleynik, I remember here from the Alex Mack episodes I watched as a teenager) who is sought after by Cameron James (Joseph Gordon Levitt) and an equally popular and wealthy student named Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan). Biancas sister  Kat ends up getting drawn into this soap opera and is chased after a fellow student named Patrick Verona (the late acclaimed Heath Ledger) thanks  to the calculated string pulling by Cameron James, his friend Michael Eckman (David Krumholtz) and Joey Donner.  Gabrielle Union and Allison Janney are also some of the multiple celebrities featured in this film that I also recognized (online sources credit being  the Mary Jane tv series to Union and Janney to the Masters of Sex tv series).  The dvd comes with the following movie trailers; When In Rome, Extract, and  10 Things I Hate About You tv series.  This dvd feature film also includes the other listed bonus features; 10 Things I Hate About You 10 Years Later, Exclusive Footage, and Filmmaker as well as Cast Audio commentary.  Some of the multiple things I loved about this movie 10 Things I Hate About You; The indie rock music featured in the film that the character of Kat (Julie Stiles) is seen enjoying, the various fun songs featured in this film (Push It by Salt N Pepa, Hold Me Now song by Thompson Twins, Sexy Boy by Air etc), and a compelling quote by that Heath Ledgers Veronica character  is seen quoting in the film. The motivational and memorable quote  referenced in this movie is Dont Let Anyone Make You Feel Like You Dont Deserve What You Want. I say this because I truly feel that this insightful quote can apply to various aims in a persons life (career goals, where a person wants to live, other personal goals etc.) even though the Verona character (Heath Ledger) was actually saying this as encouragement to Cameron James .  Last, but not least,  the various Shakespeare references  unexpectedly encouraged me to look into attending some plays/theater in the future (fortunately, I figured out how I can attend at least one play every 3-4 months at a minimum).  Overall, these are some of the various reasons why I found the five dollar purchase of !0 Things I Hate About You to be a bargain for an uplifting and heartwarming movie.",1429920000,,2736,4.79957356076759

Eventually they do discuss the fact that by the time they are doing the 10 year anniversary edition, Heath had already died. It is rather touching and a bit sad, and at the same time, good to talk about their feelings about him, and how important this movie is in defining him as a person.",1424131200,,506,4.510869565217392

Now if you are an adult looking for a wholesome movie for the younger set, add two stars.",1419724800,,383,3.909090909090909
1052184,5,6305537798,"I haven't been a teenager for a long time now and therefore romantic comedies about teenage dating are really, REALLY not my usual poison. But this one, inspired by ""Taming of the shrew"", I found EXCELLENT and I spend a really good moment watching it! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

The story follows initially Shakespeare quite closely, even if the action takes place in American high school, in our times. By the orders of her father Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) can start dating only once her older sister Kat (Julia Stiles) gets also a date. The only problem is that Kat, although a very attractive girl and definitely not uninterested in men, is such a shrew that no boy is ready to go anywhere near her. Then one day Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a new student, fells in love with Bianca. Following the advice of his friend Michael (David Krumholtz) he hires local ""bad boy"" Patrick (Heath Ledger) to seduce Kat - and therefore open him the way to ask Bianca out. From that moment the story diverges quite a lot from Shakespeare's original, as it can be expected - and I will not say anything more about it.

The greatest asset of this film is a strong scenario, full of good dialogs and tasty jokes but lacking any kind of obscenities. Let's stress it again, the two key words of this scenario are ""GOOD TASTE"". This film is many levels above typical teenage dating comedies, which are usually full of gross, embarassing and frequently obscene moments.

The cast is excellent. Julia Stiles is SPLENDID, both in beuaty and talent, every inch as good as later in ""Dexter"" when she played Lumen. It is really a pity that she didn't have a better career in Hollywood... Young Heath Ledger is AMAZING and Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Charlie Krumholtz are very good. Gabrielle Union adds her glorious beauty to the show in a smaller role and special mention goes to Susan May Pratt who plays Julia's only friend, a girl completely obsessed with Shakespeare. Three other characters add a lot to this film: Bianca and Kat's father (Larry Miller), Ms Perky (Allison Janney), school guidance counsellor with a quite unique side business and last but definitely not least Mr Morgan (Daryl Mitchell), a very competent, very black and totally amazing English literature teacher.

The chemistry between two main characters is very credible, the ending is not only touching but plausible and the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic - it is a real pleasure to listen to it.

Bottom line, this is a very good romantic comedy, clever, well made, without embarassing, obscene or gross moments and at the end we are left feeling really good. Bloopers mixed to the credits are also a recommended viewing. ENJOY!",1419638400,,2719,4.838709677419355

I enjoyed the added insights this look behind the scenes provided. The second feature is a Writers and Cast Audio Commentary.

All the reviews were good so I went on amazon (my family doesn't have Netflix or Hulu) and I ordered it, the movie came right on time! As soon as I got it out of the package, I put it in the DVD player and started watching it. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT, I just couldn't get enough! I have watched it twice in two days and I'm watching it now as we'll. Heath and Julia were brilliant in this movie and portrayed their characters excellently! Joseph Gordon-Levitt did amazing as well, he was such a sweetheart! This movie is not like usual chick flicks or romance movies in my opinion, it had a different plot from other movies and the plot actually wasn't stupid and pointless like some chick flicks I have been forced to watch. Needless to say, this was a very cute movie with a great plot and excellent actors, I will be recommending this to a bunch of people! :D Hopefully people do not get this movie mixed up with the remake...

The young actors in this comedy play their updated Shakespeare-inspired characters well, and help explain the Bard to a younger generation in a much easier and less ""Thou-filled"" manner.

Unfortunately, this movie was released at a time when a lot of teen movies were coming out, and all of the movies seemed to have a common thread of a guy getting paid to take out a girl (or betting on dates). At that time it seemed a bit annoying, but now, it's just cool that so many were released because it gives teens a better selection. 10 Things is definitely one of the best selections that a teen (or a person of any age) could make.",1379548800,,728,4.432835820895522

He's really good at playing a jerk. 10. The part where Kat flashes the teacher, too bad they couldn't show it! One thing I didn't like was the soundtrack.

1053265,3,6305537798,"High school. Some of us remember it with fond memories, but the rest look on it as some of the worst years of their lives. Dating, dealing with cheerleaders, jocks, math club addicts, and problematic teachers. That's most of what we remember about high school. 10 Things I Hate About You is a likable film, but takes awhile in getting there, and in the meantime, reminds us of the worst of our high school rejection years.

Every boy in the school believes that Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) is ""all that."" Pretty, popular, and currently single due to her father's no-dating standards, she is desired by most of the guys that walk the hallowed halls of the local high school. The newest batch to the group of pining admirers is Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), whose recent move into the district has caused him to immediately start scheming on how to get close to her. Taking up French tutoring just so he can be around her, he is turned down flat when he asks for a date, because her uptight father will not allow it. When Bianca takes her concerns to her dad, he makes an agreement -- once her older sister Kat (Julia Stiles) starts dating, so can Bianca.

One of the most trouble-driven brats in the school, Kat's ultra feminism and outspoken nature has made her unpopular with not only the entire male population but most of her teachers as well. The only student even capable of potentially handling her is the rebel of the class, Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger). But he's not willing to do something for nothing, and so Cameron and his friend Michael (David Krumholtz) trick money-stuffed jock Joey (Andrew Keegan) into financing this venture, convincing him it would be in his best interest if he intends to ever date Bianca. Thus the price is set at $50 per date, and Patrick has an uphill battle before him. Bianca has never looked on any man without disgust, and he has to win her over before the prom. This isn't much like any high school that I passed through as a teen. The teachers are rude to the students and inconsiderate of their opinions. The principle spends most of her time writing smut fiction, and bawling out the kids with foul language.

The movie just seems to hop from one horrible thing to another, before gradually slowing down and allowing the audience to come to like its protagonists. That being said, I cannot really recommend it because there is an abhorrent amount of sexual dialogue and jokes deflowering the script. Joey likes drawing certain parts of the anatomy for fun, including sketching a penis on a boy's face. Mr. Stratford works in a maternity ward, leading him to be obsessed with the possibility that his daughters might be having sex. The principle recites the dirty novel she is writing aloud as she's working on it. In an attempt to distract a teacher so her boyfriend can escape detention, Kat flashes him. Attending a party where alcohol runs feely, Kat becomes intoxicated and dances on a table. There's quite a lot of mild language and sexual/anatomical references. Before letting his daughter go out on a date, her father makes her wear a ""pregnancy suit"" to remind her of the consequences of premarital sex. To be fair, Kat does confide in her sister that the one time she had sex, she immediately regretted it, and swore never again to do something just because everyone else was. Insulted that Joey bragged to his friends about hoping to get into her pants on prom night, Bianca punches him several times. The characters do grow on you as the film progresses, and it had kind of a sweet conclusion, but I was disappointed that so much of the production focused on crass material.",1363824000,2,3647,4.6953125

I don't know how many times I've seen it, but I enjoy it equally as much every time. The plot is a modern Shakespeare of two sisters who are not aloud to date. One is popular and the other one is no (longer) interested in boys or superficial things. So when the new guy at school falls for the younger, popular sister he has to find a way to take her on a date. The father of the two sisters finally gives in and says that the young,popular sister can date when the older sister dates. So what does the new guy do? Hire someone to take out the older sister. But will it go as planned?

However, you take this talented cast and fabulous director and waste them on just another mediocre coming-of-age tale where the characters are so under-developed that you really don't care whether they come of age on not. Add to that a forced over-sexed twist to try to be hip and the result is huge loss of opportunity.

1053506,3,6305537798,"High school. Some of us remember it with fond memories, but the rest look on it as some of the worst years of our lives.

Every boy in the school believes Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is the girl to date. Pretty, popular, and currently single due to her father's no-dating standards, she is desired by most of the guys that walk the halls of the local high school. Her latest pining admirer is Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who is turned down flat when he asks for a date because her uptight father will not allow it, unless her older sister Kat (Julia Stiles) also starts dating.

One of the most troubled girls in the school, Kat's ultra feminism and outspoken nature has made her unpopular with not only the entire male population but most of her teachers as well. The only student even capable of potentially handling her is the rebel of the class, Patrick (Heath Ledger). But he's not willing to do something for nothing, so Cameron and his friend Michael (David Krumholtz) trick money-stuffed jock Joey (Andrew Keegan) into financing this venture, convincing him it would be in his best interest if he intends to ever date Bianca. Patrick has an uphill battle, since Bianca has never looked on any man without disgust, and he has to win her over before the prom.

It took a bit of adjustment before I got to where I enjoyed this film but it is a clever modern adaptation of Shakespeare and the leads have wonderful chemistry with one another. Witty and intelligent but also just plain fun in places, it lingers with you long after you have finished it, returning months and even years later to your mind to entice you to rediscover its joys once again. It's well worth seeing once or if you're anything like me, more than once.

I loved this movie. I watched the beginning and wasn't very interested it had a slow beginning and I was waiting for something to happen. But I decided to give the movie a full run and I absolutely loved it. It was hilarious, excellent, and cute. It was an amazing teen movie that is just as good as recent teen movies like Easy A. This movie is a must see! You won't regret it, its just so good!
The 1st release DVD has terrible quality, grainy and the format is fullscreen but with the bars, so on a widescreen tv, it looks very long and stretched. I highly recommend the blu-ray, the picture is full and bright, except I noticed the tops of their heads are slightly cut off, I don't know if it's my tv or the blu-ray or the playing doing but it can be distracting at times, but in the end it's better than having that terrible grainy picture.

1053550,5,6305537798,"I rented this movie and fell in love with it long before ever discovering it was based on The Taming of the Shrew.  Rather than rehash the storyline as so many reviewers are inclined to do, I will tell you that this movie is the best teen flick I've seen since Sixteen Candles, and that's saying something.  I never stopped laughing.  With a great cast of young actors, particularly Julia Stiles as major teed-off rebel Kat Stratford, sexy Aussie Heath Ledger as her very Michael Hutchence-like persuer Phil Verona, and Joseph Gordon Levitt (formerly Tommy of Third Rock From the Sun), you get good, solid performances and superb writing with clever one-liners and plenty of chemistry-driven interaction in each scene to warrant learning the dialog without trying.  This movie is witty and so much fun that I always recommend it to anyone and everyone that hasn't seen it yet.  Get a hold of this for the sheer enjoyment, because it's a total laugh riot.  The music isn't entirely my thing but, by the end, I even started kind of likeing Letters to Cleo.  Destined for classic status if it isn't already.",1308182400,,1104,4.7486910994764395

1053553,5,6305537798,"I watched this in Year 12 for my Media Studies class, along with ""Boyz In The Hood"". I didn't like Boyz much, but this was briliant! I knew already that it was based on Shakespeare's ""Taming of The Shrew"". I loved Kat's witty dialogue and personality. From the moment I heard ""Bad Reputation"" playing, I knew Kat was going to be as much of a shrew as Shakespeare's original Kate was.
Bianca was also a character I loved in some ways. I couldn't help enjoying her shallow conversation with her friend Chastity at the beginning ""Yeah, but see, there's a difference between like and love, cause I like my Sketchers, but I love my Prada backpack.""
""But I love my Sketchers.""
""That's because you don't have a Prada backpack.""
Now, the story. Kat (Julia Stiles) and Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) Stratford have a dating rule. Bianca can date when Kat does. However, Kat doesn't want to date, which poses a problem for her younger sister, who wants to date. She even has two choices. There's new boy Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), very sweet and completely smitten. The other boy is Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan), a model with only one thing he wants from Bianca. The dating rule makes the boys allies in getting Kat to date. Cameron and his friend Michael(David Krumholtz) find the perfect date for Kat-bad-boy Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger). They get Joey to pay Patrick to date Kat, letting him think that it's to his advantage, and the story is made.
Personally, my favourite scenes are at the prom. The scene when Bianca triple-punches Joey is priceless!

1053584,4,6305537798,"This movie is definitely one of my high school years.  Though living a school time far different from these characters, this is a movie that brings back all sorts of memories.

The nice thing is the movie remains just as good as it did.  It's a staple of that late turn-of-the-millenium era, and anyone my age will happily quote lines from it.  So thankful it came to Blu-Ray.

An updated allusion to Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew"" this is full of dilariously witty high school dialogue and banter sprinkled with Shakespearean quotes.  The result is a surprisingly intelligent story of the relationship between sisters, friends, and lovers.

The characters are lovable and hilarious, all working with plenty of energy.  The soundtrack rocks.  And it's another example of how timeless Shakespeare can be.

However, I was a little bit disappointed with the Blu-Ray.  It has a commentary track, plus a discussion on the movie.  Nice, but a bit lacking for what I have come to expect from bonus features.

1053587,3,6305537798,"I have always loved this movie - it's a modern-day adaptation of one of my favorite Shakespeare plays and stars two of my favorite actors and several amazing supporting actors (Larry Miller and Allison Janney, to name a few).
HOWEVER, I have owned the DVD for years and have been anxiously awaiting its release on Blu-Ray.  Browsing the shelves of Best Buy the other day, I saw the 10th Anniversary DVD available for $9.99.  ""Not a bad deal"" I think - ""Let's check it out on Blu-Ray.""  The Blu-Ray edition of this 10th Anniversary edition was $24.99.  Not that I really wanted to spend that much on an upgrade of a movie I already own, but I figured what the hell - there's a new documentary (35 min ""10 Things I Love About 10 Things I Hate About You 10 Years Later""), Deleted Scenes (listed separately) and ""NEVER BEFORE SEEN HEATH LEDGER SCREEN TEST FOOTAGE"" (which got its own sticker on the front of the slip cover).
I got the disc home and popped it in.  Didn't have time to watch the film, but I figured I'd watch the special features (notice my ""s"" at the end of ""features"").  Upon watching the documentary, which is misleadingly labeled - the only recent interviews are with the director and the co-writers - all of the other interview footage was shot on set during filming - I was looking forward to watching the Deleted Scenes which we were given glimpses of within the documentary when the director alluded to them.  When I went looking for them, I realized that there were no ""Deleted Scenes"" on their own, or in their entirety.  The marketing team decided to list them as a separate Special Feature, even though they were only shown partially in the documentary - and the ""NEVER BEFORE SEEN HEATH LEDGER SCREEN TEST FOOTAGE"", which required its own sticker on the front of the slip cover?  About 20 seconds of the 35 minute documentary.
As I said earlier, I haven't yet watched the film on this disc, but I feel it's safe to say that they probably have not remastered it.  Overall, this Blu-Ray was a HUGE disappointment.  At $25, I feel ripped off.  At Amazon's price, if you're a big enough fan of the film, maybe it's worth it for the new documentary; and I commend Amazon for listing the Deleted Scenes within the documentary, even though the packing on the disc lists them separately.

1053588,4,6305537798,"Ok, this review is simply to let people know of the one GLARING flaw for fans of the original theatrical release of the film.'10 Things' is a great classic 90s teen movie filled with quick wit, great comic timing and lovable characters... BUT there are a couple of scenes that are CENSORED from the original theatrical release back in the late 90's. That's right, this is a partially censored version of the film.

When this film was released for television viewing a couple of years after its release, there was a scene where the main protagonist Cameron is sitting on the benches of the soccer field with his friend William towards the beginning of the film, and upon seeing that the Kat Stratford character is not willing to go out with Patrick (the late Heath Ledger's character) Cameron states ""we're screwed... we're SCREWED!""
The problem here is that in the original theatrical release of the film the actual line is ""we're f*****d.... we're F*****d!""
On top of this, there is a scene in the opening of the film where Cameron's character is meeting with the office administrator as she is writing her exotic novel, she walks over to the window and warns the Cameron character about a group of kids at school she refers to as ""s***heads,"" but it is apparent that in the transfer there was some overdubbing and the word does not come out clear. While this MAY have been the original line of the film, it is questionable, but there is definite dubbing at that line.

While the film is still as stellar as ever, just know that somewhere along the way in the transfer they seemed to not have been able to get the original theatrical release to remaster into High Def, therefore probably used a newer censored version of the film and remastered that instead. Considering I'm very big on director originality, I hate dubbed and censored versions of films, and most hardcore film buffs would feel the same, so it is best you know that before you purchase this film. I would recommend that if you want the original theatrical release of the film to go and pick up and older DVD copy.
Other than that, the transfer is very clean and great looking, the audio is well balanced and also remastered well. The ""10 years later"" special feature also doesn't actually feature ANYTHING from the actors 10 years later, but all cast interviews are from when the film was released. The only interviews taken from the 10-years-later perspective were the film's director, casting agent and writer. Kind of a bummer, it would have been awesome to hear from the original cast 10 years later.

Thus for these flaws I have to take a star away from the review.",1289174400,4,2638,4.668817204301075

Both characters were given great lines, but it is the combination that makes the film for me. One of my favorite scenes is when Patrick is told that Kat apparently likes ""pretty guys"" and his facial expression is hilarious as he finally realizes they don't think he is. Which is he, of course. It eventually dawns on each of the two main characters that they like the other despite no initial intentions to do so. These awakenings are touching to watch. They each publicly embarrass themselves as they travel towards being a couple, but by the end of the movie I'm convinced they have a future. Whether that survives Kat going to Sarah Lawrence for college I can't say, but I'll bet they have a good time together for the rest of their senior year.  This is a movie I can watch over and over again because it is funny and entertaining.

Is it fair you can't date until your older sister does? And she's not interested in dating? Anyone? No. So right off you learn whoever told you life was fair was either lying or extremely well off...

This is a chick flick that most guys will love too. Yeah, really! When the good girl with a snobbish attitude appears at the dance with the bad boy in his motorcycle boots the planet tilts, right?

1053635,5,6305537798,"Really, ""10 Things"" was so dry, witty - and yet so sharply observant about high school and the denizens within, it's almost as if it were another John Hughes movie, ten years after. Now it's another ten years after that, and it has aged marvelously well, all things considered; even the minor characters are sharply drawn, and if not actually sympathetic, they are amusing. One of the best qualities about ""10 Things"" is that the adult characters are also real people, not just cardboard outlines and sappy caricatures: they are as sharp and finely drawn as the teenagers - especially Alison Janney as the no-nonsense guidance counselor at Padua High, who is writing a bodice-ripping romance in between counseling sessions, and the lovingly over-protective father of teenage daughters, played by Larry Miller.
The plot setup is lifted wholesale from Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew"" - two sisters, Bianca, (Larisa Oleynik) sweet and pretty, and her older sister Kat (Julia Stiles) being a forbiddingly hostile and sour-tempered shrew.  Cameron, the new boy at Padua High (Joseph Gordon Levitt) has fallen for Bianca - who may not go out on a date unless her sister does the same. Not discouraged, Cameron attempts to fix up Kat with a slightly mysterious, brooding bad boy, Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger)  . . .  and it pretty much plays out, among the modern high school milieu of various sub-groups, which are hilariously outlined by Cameron's new friend and assistant plotter, Michael (David Khumoltz). Just as I remember from high school, there are the brains, the social set, the stoners, the gangsters, the bad boys, all of them uneasily coexisting. Sweet, funny, timeless and with a million things going on in the corners and in the background, ""10 Things"" can bear watching, repeatedly - like John Hughes movies.

Extras are limited to a single fairly well organized documentary, ""10 Things I Hate About You 10 Years Later,"" which includes - among the cast and writer interviews - some footage of Heath Ledger's screen test.",1269043200,,2038,5.020710059171598

So five stars is what it gets even with the complaint I am about to mention. Julia, Heath, heck everyone is perfectly cast, and writing and directing are perfection. Music = Genius. All that said I already had this DVD since day one of the original release. But I prayed for a Criterion release, unrealistic though that was, or OK, so maybe just a ""Special Edition"" with deleted scenes and a making of feature. Along comes this new 10th Anniversary release announcement and I am beyond excited. Jump to now... sigh.... ""Making of"" featurette: CHECK. Deleted scenes: huh? Where? No? arrgghhhh!!!!! I searched everywhere. Every menu. Not even an ""easter egg"" to be found. So I come here and see a recent review pointing out that the ""deleted scenes"" were actually part of the ""making of"" featurette!!! So actual full on deleted scenes, maybe even with director's commentary?: NEGATIVE!!! To paraphrase Yoda: feeling ripped off beyond belief I am. So great movie and a load of horse hockey for extras as listed. Again... sigh...",1263427200,3,1127,4.7846153846153845
1053639,4,6305537798,"One would think, for the 10th anniversary of this movie, the DVD would be a little bit more special, but all you're getting is a digital copy, a newly recorded audio commentary with some of the actors & writers, and a 10-yr retrospective with the director and the two writers (a measly half-hour).  Any shot with the actors in the retrospective all are from when the movie was being made, nothing more current with any of the actors.

Ridiculously stingy DVD extras aside, though, this is still something worth buying if you don't already own the movie.  It's definitely something that will go down amongst Clueless et al. as a great teen movie.  It's a fun, frothy (given credibility by that ""based on Will Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew"" line but frothy nonetheless) teen movie that doesn't condescend.  The script is just so well written!  The teenagers are written like, well, people I went to school with (which is saying something since I was in high school when this movie came out).  And the subtle jokes that appeared in this movie, well, it says something about the writers that they bothered with subtlety for a teen movie.  It's this earnest writing, rife with references to Shakespeare, that allows this movie to transcend beyond just another teen movie.

The cast is wonderful, and it's amazing to think how many names I can easy recognize - Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Allison Janney, Gabrielle Union, etc.  Oh sure, it may have been the first big movie for many of these names, but they all showed why it was that they went on to have real careers after.

All in all, it's worth buying if you don't own the movie but is not worth buying if you've got a copy hanging around.  The movie itself is what you'll be buying this movie for - the audio commentary with the actors sharing a few Heath Ledger stories is cute and sentimental but not especially special.",1262822400,2,1898,4.683734939759036
1053640,4,6305537798,"In 1999, the film ""10 Things I Hate About You"" which was is based on William Shakespeare's play ""The Taming of the Shrew"" was adapted to a teen comedy film by screenwriters Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith (both who wrote ""Legally Blonde"", ""The Ugly Truth"", ""The House Bunny"" and ""Ella Enchanted"") and featured first time film director Gil Junger (known for directing TV shows ""Ellen"", ""According to Jim"" and ""Hope and Faith"").

The film would be appreciated as a teen romantic comedy and since the film's debut is considered among the top 10 teen romantic comedy films out there and the film is known to be the launching point for the director, the screenwriters and the film that would launch the careers of Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger.

The popularity of the film now reaching it's tenth year anniversary has recently generated a television series on ABC Family and now a 10th Anniversary Blu-ray release.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""10 Things I Hate About You: 10th Anniversary Edition"" receives its first entry to Blu-ray.  Presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1), the film looks great!  At first, I was a little worried when the stock footage of Seattle was grainy but once you see the film, you can't help but be happy about the detail.  You can see the skin pores of the people, details on the walls and surroundings.  Some scenes are vibrant and colorful, there is a fine layer of grain on the film,  blacks are nice and deep and picture quality that is much better than its DVD counterpart.

As for audio quality, the film is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and in French, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is front and center channel driven.  Dialogue and music are clear but for the most part, the lossless soundtrack works for the film.  I was hoping that with the crowd scenes, those sounds would be heard on the surround channels but I really didn't hear too much surround channel usage or even anything from the subwoofer.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""10 Things I Hate About You: 10th Anniversary Edition"" comes with the following special features featured in 1080p or 480i, English 2.0 Dolby Digital with English SDH, French or Spanish subtitles.  Included are:

  * 10 Things I Love About 10 Things I Hate About You 10 Years Later - (35:05)  Ten years after the film's initial debut, director Gil Junger, and writers Kirsten Smith and Karen Lutz reflect and hear the story about how this classic teen comedy came to be. Featuring never-before-seen behind the scenes footage, original cast interviews, deleted scenes, original screen test and personal photos from the writers' scrap books.
  * Audio Commentary with co-writers Karen Lutz and Kirsten Smith, and stars Andrew Keegan, David Krumholtz, Larisa Oleynik and Susan May Pratt - An entertaining commentary with the writers and cast reflecting their past working on the film and working with members of cast and crew.  Also, jokes and hilarious things that happened behind-the-scenes.  Also, everyone talks about their memories of Heath Ledger on the set and auditions.  For fans of the film, listening to this audio commentary makes this release so much worth it!

It's important to note that ""deleted scenes"" are mentioned on back of the package are found on the ""10 Things I Love About 10 Things I Hate About You 10 Years Later"" featurette.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I can easily remember when the original DVD was released and how badly I wanted it.  ""10 Things I Hate About You"" was in my mind, the best non rated-R teen romantic film.  Although ""American Pie"" was the more popular teen film of that year (the year also featured my other favorite PG-13 teen romance film ""She's All That""), ""10 Things I Hate About You"" was a film I enjoyed because of its sincerity, everyone seemed to click well with each other and the screenplay never had to go the route of being perverted.  Also, that poem by Kat at the end of the film is absolutely classic!

But here we are ten years later and ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is a pretty enjoyable film that still holds up today.  But I know the big question for many people is if its worth upgrading from the DVD to the Blu-ray version?  My answer is ""YES!"".  The picture quality is much better than its original DVD counterpart but for those who loved the film, the two special features are just worth watching.

The audio commentary is just absolutely hilarious and for the most part, it's like reuniting with old friends again and hearing stories that happened behind-the-scenes of filming to the hotel parties that the cast would have and just the shenanigans that took place and how respectful they were in remember Heath Ledger.  The audio commentary was fantastic!

I would have loved more special features to be included but considering that the original DVD had no special features at all, I'm glad that at least we get two special features for this 10th anniversary edition and the two are very entertaining.

Overall, ""10 Things I Hate About You: 10th Anniversary Edition"" is a fantastic release for fans of the film.  The DVD may not have a lot of bells and whistles as I would have hoped but for the most part, this Blu-ray release is definitely an improved upgrade over the 1999 DVD and the audio commentary, again...hilarious and all-out-fun.

If you are a hardcore fan, a person who enjoyed this film or someone that is curious about this release, ""10 Things I Hate About You: 10th Anniversary Edition""  is definitely recommended!",1262822400,12,5508,4.778012684989429

*Spoiler*

Loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"", ""10 Things"" is a very decent modern adaptation of this sometimes troublesome old tale. Faced with concepts that are difficult to translate to modern audiences, for instance why the desirable Bianca is off-limits until her abrasive sister Kat dates/marries in a world that no longer has bride prices and dowries, the film writers have created the clever conceit of a father obsessed with preventing his daughters from becoming grown, sexual beings. Tired of having the same argument with his social butterfly daughter Bianca, he childishly transfers the burden of parent onto the older Kat, saying that Bianca can date only when Kat does and trusting that Kat will continue to remain solitary and cloistered within the home.

Neatly dodging questions of potential sexism in the original material, the abrasive Kat has been rendered as a superbly sympathetic character. From the beginning, it is clear that her tough exterior is not simply a factor of her being a terrible person, but rather it is a form of self-defense in the cruel world of high school politics. She is willing to open up to genuine kindness, but she refuses to be manipulated or used, and hopes to impart this wisdom somehow to her more vulnerable sister.

Impressively, almost every character grows and learns something in this film. Kat and Patrick learn the value of trust and vulnerability in a relationship; Bianca and Cameron learn to judge when and how to be healthily selfish; and ""Dad"" learns to stop trying to prevent his daughters from growing up and to instead support them in such a way that he can still advise and guide them as they grow.

Although this is a very good adaptation, it is arguable how 'timeless' ""10 Things"" is. High school is a naturally constraining setting, and high school rom-coms tend to age rather badly. Parents will want to note that this movie contains potentially objectionable language and situations involving alcohol and suggestive dancing. This version also contains captions for the hearing impaired.

It was the movie that introduced Heath Ledger to America and is a teen classic. It also stares Julia Stiles, who is no stranger to chick flicks, Larissa Olenik(from one of my favourite Nick shows The Secret World of Alex Mack) and a few other people we know pretty well.

The movie is based on the play The Taming of the Shrew, but it's set in a high school which brings it home for many people, not just teens. The acting is pretty good for a teen flick, and the dialogue followable without relying too much on teenspeak. The ending is pretty much already known, but still rather cute.

1053709,4,6305537798,"""10 Things I Hate About You"" is a film I find myself renting every few years; so I should probably break down and buy a copy.  As Heath Ledger's first major film in the US, it has become the starting point for one of Hollywood's most memorable careers.  Ledger of course was nominated for an Oscar for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brokeback-Mountain-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JOFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brokeback Mountain (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and seems likely for another nomination for his work in ""The Dark Knight.""  As Patrick Verona, he's the hard-edged kid who falls for the girl least likely to be romanced.

As Kat Stratford, Julia Stiles won an award from the Chicago Film Critics Association as ""Most Promising Actress.""  With her work in the Bourne series and her new film ""The Bell Jar,"" she's continued to be visible.  She does a great job of walking that fine line between the shrew who disdains pretense and a girl to whom we can still lose our hearts.  Her dance scene is hysterical.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt who was a regular on TV's ""Third Rock from the Sun"" and who I have watched recently in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stop-Loss/dp/B0013FSL1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stop-Loss</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brick/dp/B000FVQM2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brick</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mysterious-Skin-Deluxe-Unrated-Director-s-Edition/dp/B000F6II1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mysterious Skin (Deluxe Unrated Director's Edition)</a>&nbsp;plays Cameron James, the love-struck teen who must get a guy to date Kat before he can go out with her sister.

Larisa Oleynik who appeared several times on ""Third Rock"" plays Bianca as a superficial party girl.  Their dad is played by Larry Miller who was on the ""Joe Day Afternoon"" episode of one of my favorite TV shows, ""Medium.""  Andrew Keegan who was on TV's ""Party of Five"" plays the narcissistic Joey Donner who pays Patrick to date Kat.  Allison Janey from TV's ""West Wing"" has a delightful cameo as the assistant principal Ms. Perky who moonlights by writing romance novels.  Daryl Mitchell has a very funny role as the teacher Mr. Morgan who seems to dislike his students whenever possible.  David Krumholtz who is the mathematician on TV's ""Numbers"" and who was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superbad-Unrated-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000WZEZGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superbad (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;looks youthful as the brainy Michael who suggests to Cameron how to get a date with Bianca.

Gil Junger directed the film.  He has done extensive directing on television for series like ""Dharma & Greg"" & ""Ellen"" & is currently directing a TV update of this same film.  While scenes like the rooftop concert may move this a bit far on the reality scale, I find this is a sweet romantic comedy that I enjoy revisiting.  Enjoy!",1231286400,,3065,6.398058252427185
1053710,3,6305537798,"""10 Things I Hate About You"" was part of an interesting and often-criticized trend in 90's American cinema: Take a popular work of classic literature and place it in a modern teenage world. The high point of the sub-genre was no doubt Amy Heckerling's ultra-hip ""Clueless"", based on Jane Austen's classic novel ""Emma"". That film had a story that was not afraid to break free of its source material and provided audiences with a memorable new heroine and Alicia Silverstone with a sparkling screen debut. By comparison, ""10 Things I Hate About You"" only works some of the time.

For all its hip dialogue and contemporary sensibility, it uses plot conventions and cliches so ancient that the very thought of it conjures up images of studio executives passing out scripts made of papyrus scrolls and the story in which it is based, Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew"", is used as a springboard for a series of not-so-subtle winks at the camera. The story lacks inspiration in a lot of other key areas as well. It painfully sticks to the traditional boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl formula and for reasons unknown to me, the screenwriters found it necessary to incorporate an assembly line of scenes found in almost ever other run-of-the-mill high school comedy including an obligatory party scene and an emotional climax at the prom.

Despite these flaws, the film maintains an air of freshness and undeniable charm thanks to a competent cast and the occasional sprinkling of wit. At Padua High School (wink), Julia Stiles plays Katrina ""Kat"" Stratford, a smart but angst-ridden social outcast. When her more popular and gleefully shallow younger sister, Bianca, wants to date a self-absorbed underwear model, their overbearing father states that Bianca can date, but only if Kat does too. Upon hearing this, Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a shy transfer student who secretly idolizes Bianca, bribes the school bad boy, Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger), into courting the tempestuous Kat who is won over by Patrick's wily charm in spite of herself.

The scene that is most remembered is in fact the one scene of pure joy and originality. In it we see Ledger's character singing and dancing across the bleachers of the school's football stadium whilst professing his love for Kat and for a moment, it is clear that the film indeed has a heartbeat. The chemistry between Stiles and Ledger is the highlight of the film. Their romance is genuine and effective and at times I wished that their characters could have abandoned the script and started fresh with a new plot.

Complimenting their performances is a bright and breezy soundtrack and a few praiseworthy supporting players including the always reliable Allison Janney as a horny high school counselor and Daryl ""Chill"" Mitchell as a passionate English teacher who raps the words of Shakespeare to glorious effect. Imagine if the writers had taken a cue from the Mitchell character and turned the project into a Shakespeare-inspired rap musical. That would have been interesting!",1226966400,,3051,5.023715415019763

A young player wants to date her sister a bubbly princess, but the overprotective father won't let the daughters date. His rule is unless the older feminist sister dates, she can't. So the young man recruits the help of a bad boy to help him get his girl. What could have been a predictable story turns magical over the next hour. Romance, laughs, drama this movie has it all and then some.

Ten Things I Hate About You works because of the strong writing, solid direction and great performances from the cast. This modernized version captures the heart and soul of Shakespeare's material and makes it relatable to today. The characters in this script are so well developed and the actors make them into three-dimensional people you want to root for.

 Julia Stiles gives the best performance of her career here. She carries the movie from opening act to final scene. The late Heath Ledger is equally strong here; he has great chemistry with Stiles and shows great acting range even in this early role. I loved the scenes on the football field! Gabrielle Union is solid in a supporting role. I wish she had this kind of writing and direction in Deliver Us From Eva. Deliver Us From Eva retells the exact same story but she's ten times better in this movie than in that one. The rest of the cast is just as great. Everyone should give themselves a round of applause. This is a top notch teen movie I would be proud to have in my DVD collection.

Ten Things I Hate About You is a Shawn James essential Teen Movie. Pick this one up with The Last American Virgin, The Breakfast Club and Pretty In Pink.",1216166400,2,2000,4.526315789473684

1053795,4,6305537798,"The 80s were a big time for the teen genre; it seemed like almost every week there was a new teen movie opening, but with the end of the 80s and the end of the John Hughes era seemed to be the end of the teen genre. While there were still some teen movies produced in the 90s they didn't seem to get over as well. But towards the late 90s with the success of the TV series Dawson's Creek and the American Pie franchise suddenly the teen genre was back in a big way. What followed were mostly lackluster movie, but 10 Things I Hate About You is one of the better ones to follow.

Clichs are a very odd thing; sometimes they can do a movie in due to how predictable it is where as other times they help make the movie enjoyable. 10 Things I Hate About You is one of the movies where the clichs actually help and make the movie a lot of fun. We've seen movies like this done back in the 80s and overall done better, but there is just something about this movie that works really well and it comes out very enjoyable.

I have no problem with sexuality in movies it's a shame in these PC days everyone seems to complain, but it's kind of nice not having any of that. At first the sexual gags are fun, but then other filmmakers see that and try and up the ante and it's no longer fun. It becomes doing these gags for the sake of it. 10 Things I Hate About You goes back and does things more simple and simply just aims to make you laugh and entertain you and it very much gets the job done.

The screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith was very well written with excellent and characters with plenty of depth; all the usual type characters are here; the jock, the pretty popular girl, the guy in love with the popular girl, the outcast and the bad boy. With all of that one would think this movie would probably fail, but to the credit of the writers they take the basic teen movie formula and work it well and write a very entertaining movie.

Director Gil Junger pretty much delivers the text book teen movie direction and like the writing instead of hurting it really works well despite any clichs. When doing a teen flick there are often silly and over the top moments; sometimes they work and sometimes they fell flat. But here the over the top moments are well done and believable.

10 Things I Hate About You in my opinion is a much better movie than one might think. The movie has a lot of heart and a great message of just be yourself. This is the type of movie that is a great pick up if you are feeling down. At least for me it works like that and entertains me for 90-minutes and puts a smile on my face and despite any flaws that is all that matters. How the movie ends shouldn't come as much of a shocker to the audience. I think it's safe to know from the very start once the plot kicks in how this will all turn out. But again despite all this 10 Things really works so well and is one of the better teen flicks of the 90s and quite honestly would make my top 10 teen comedies, I really enjoyed this film a lot more than I thought I would.

I'm not gonna jump on the let's all praise Heath Ledger, which due to his tragic death a lot of people are now doing. Heath Ledger was a very talented actor and despite being an Oscar nominated actor didn't fully reach his potential. I think the future was very bright for him and he would have lived up to that potential. But here in 10 Things he was really great. He played the typical teen movie bad boy with another side. And he does it so well and brings so much to the role. His character was one of the leads and honestly it could have been a boring clichd character, but Ledger brought so much and almost makes it fresh. Julia Stiles I also really liked; her character was a lot of fun and any scene with her and Heath Ledger worked great.

The rest of the cast is excellent as well, but in my opinion Larry Miller as the over-protective father steals the show. I've always liked Larry Miller; he's one of those guys that seems to always pop up. You might not always know his name, but you'll know his face. Even in the smallest of roles he always delivers and in 10 Things I Hate About You he clearly steals the show.

Teen driven movies often hire actors in their mid to late 20s and even as old as early 30s. While that isn't old, but for playing a teenager it sure is. So it's really refreshing to see a movie about teenagers and all the actors very close to the ages. Most of the cast in the movie were very close to the ages of their characters at the time of filming.

In closing, while 10 Things I Hate About You may not be the most original teen comedy what it lacks in originality it makes up in just pure fun. This movie is a blast from beginning, middle to end. The highlight of the movie is Heath Ledger singing Just too Good to Be True in the bleachers to Julia Stiles.",1203292800,5,4852,4.120507399577167

1053863,4,6305537798,"""10 Things I Hate About You"" (1999) is probably the all-time most ambitious of the teen comedies. Updates of classic literature like this have become relatively common; ""Emma"" is adapted as ""Clueless"", ""Othello"" as ""O"", ""Pygmalion"" becomes ''She's All That'', etc. etc. ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is an adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"" (which has also been adapted as the Broadway musical and film ""Kiss Me Kate"").

The strange title is less Shakespeare derived than a play on the Elizabeth Barrett Browning sonnet that begins ''How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.'' Even knowing this, the title withholds its relationship to the film content until the climatic scene late in the film when Katerina (Julia Stiles) reads her poem (in iambic pentameter) to the class: ""I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair. I hate the way you drive my car. I hate it when you stare. I hate your big dumb combat boots, and the way you read my mind. I hate you so much it makes me sick; it even makes me rhyme. I hate the way you're always right. I hate it when you lie. I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry. I hate it when you're not around, and the fact that you didn't call. But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you, not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all"". Either the producers can't count of they didn't like the sound of ""13 Things I Hate About You""

The film was fairly popular at the time of its release and made a considerable amount of money,  but critical reaction was mixed. Most of the negative reviews came from critics who felt the film was too distanced from the original; specifically that Katerina was not Shakespeare's mega-shrew and that her taming was just too tame. While these observations are correct, in this case toning down the original makes the film work better. A less gritty story allows for more lyrical storytelling and better unity with the great pop soundtrack and the inventive cinematography. And few will miss the original's out-of-control misogyny. The film goes out on fantastic rotational helicopter shot of the group ""Letters from Cleo"" as they perform the closing song on top of spectacular Stadium High School in Tacoma.

The story begins with obstetrician Walter Stratford's (Larry Miller) grudging agreement to allow his younger daughter Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) to date if her older sister Katerina (Stiles) starts dating. Walter's occupation has made him super-paranoid about teen pregnancy, but he feel quite safe with this compromise because Katerina is a brain with little interest in boys and an abrasive enough personality to drive away anyone who might be attracted to her.

Miller and Stiles are exceptional in these roles, the best performances of their careers. Oleynik (formally Alex Mack) does not have nearly as much to work with but is solid in her role; if you view the film a second time you can better appreciate the subtle tease she brings to this role. My main criticism is that the film has the same dynamic as ""Some Kind of Wonderful"", with the abrasive tomboy significantly more desirable than the foxy girl every guy is after. Back in her ""Alex Mack"" days Oleynik was the #1 ranked female in a People Magazine survey of the most beautiful person in the world. I don't see it and I'm pretty sure that I have a lot of company.

One interesting bit of trivia is that Oleynik went on to attend and graduate from Sarah Lawrence College, the school that Katerina wants to attend in the film.

Female viewers will generally be pleased with Heath Ledger as Patrick Verona (afterall the action takes place at Padua High School),  who is hired by two of Bianca's admirers to tame the shrew.  Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) is the obnoxious pretty boy who is cruising for his comeuppance throughout the film; but he is not close to the bad guy standard set by  ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" and Pretty in Pink"". Allison Janney is hilarious as a porno-writing guidance counselor.

I really liked the tentative feeling between Patrick and Katerina. In one of the most enjoyable scenes he appears in the grandstands while she is at soccer practice and sings ''I Love You Baby'' over the P.A. system, having bribed the school's marching band to accompany him from down on the field.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1184544000,2,4351,4.651041666666667
1053864,5,6305537798,"One of my favorite teen comedies would have to be '10 Things I Hate About You', a film that remains hilarious and smart as each year passes.  The dialog is snappy and sincere and the acting is really top notch for a teen film, every actor in perfect unison and really in tune with their character.  As far as modern adaptations of Shakespearian novels go (and there are tons of them as we are all well aware) this is one of the better ones.  It stays true to the concept of the original `Taming of the Shrew' but adds enough clever twists that make this original and a lot of fun.  The chemistry between the actors is wonderful, and for a film staring a group of young actors it's one of the only films to star a group of `talented' young actors, from recent Oscar nominee Heath Ledger to Oscar snubbed Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

The plot of the film follows Cameron, played by Gordon-Levitt, as he pines for the attention of Bianca, played by Larisa Oleynik.  The problem Cameron faces is not the fact that she's one of the most popular girls in school, and way out of his league but the fact that her father refuses to let her date.  His stipulation is that her older sister Kat begin dating first, and Kat is not about to do that anytime soon.  Cameron decides his only option is to find a suitor for Kat, someone to sweep her off her feet, problem being that everyone at the school is afraid of Kat.  She's abrasive, rude and has made it perfectly clear that she has no interest in boys.  But Cameron finds Patrick Verona, the mysterious tough guy with no fears, and offers him cash to take out Kat.  Thus the hunt begins.  Patrick finds it more difficult than expected to woo Kat but as he attempts he finds that his original disinterest in her is turning to genuine infatuation and then to a more mature caring and concern.  He's falling in love with her and surprisingly she's falling for him as well.

All four of the main stars work wonders with their characters.  Oleynik is sweet, funny and realistic as Bianca.  I remember watching her on Nickelodeon's `The Secret World of Alex Mack' and thinking she had that natural talent, of course I was twelve but whatever.  Here she doesn't disappoint, even now that I'm much older than twelve.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great here, really natural.  He's matured into such a wonderful actor and his selection in films is wonderfully eclectic.  Julia Stiles also blew me away here.  I've always been a fan of her acting, she's charming and beautiful to look at, but her she shows layers of depth and reality to a character that could have easily become surface in the hands of another actress.  She truly deserves a better career than the one she has.  And talking about better careers, look no further than the standout performer of the bunch Heath Ledger.  Before `Brokeback Mountain' he was the one to watch for.  Here he's charming, natural, charismatic, funny and definitely ahead of the pack as far as natural talent is concerned.  I'm so proud of him as an actor.

The supporting players are all great as well, from Larry Miller who plays the girls paranoid father (that whole scene with the pregnant crack addict story is priceless) to Allison Janney who plays the sex obsessed guidance councilor, everyone is on the top of their game.  But ultimately this is a teen movie, about and for teens and so I need to make mention of the supporting actors playing teens (I say `playing' because I'm sure most of them are in their twenties/thirties as is almost always the case).  David Khumoltz is effective in the geeky sidekick role, but it's Andrew Keegan who shines as popular, too cool for his own good, cocky jerk Joey.  He's utterly hilarious in his role which could have gone the route of stock character but instead stepped out from the pack and became a very memorable part of the film.  That whole scene with the two pictures was genius.  With a tight script and an effective cast '10 Things I Hate About You' should prove to be an enjoyable movie experience, one for the textbooks!",1183593600,2,4041,4.554016620498615

But why the title? It is not from Taming of the Shrew but seems to come from sonnet 141 which Kat's class has to paraphrase--what's the connection? Sonnet 141 ""In faith I do not love thee with..."" is a dense dense piece of work  and I am still not sure what it is about.

Kat and Bianca live with their father, an OB/GYN, whose wife left him. He is raising his daughters alone. He's very caring father, though very strick both because of his profession and his abandonment by his wife.

Bianca, who is younger than Kat and a certified flirt, is not allowed by her father to date unless Kat is dating.  But Kat refuses to date anyone. She is cynical and unhappy though it is obvious that she is very intelligent (much more so than Bianca). She's very unpopular at school; even her English teacher doesn't like her. Something has happened to Kat to make her cynical and bitter, but what?  We find out much later in the film.

Cameron, who has been tutoring Bianca in French, is infatuated with Bianca and wants to date her. He and his friend Michael (a geeky kind of guy) devise a scheme to find a date for Kat. No one will accept their proposal except Patrick who is the most unpopular tough-guy/loner at the high school (he lights his cigarettes with a blow torch in one scene). The school rumor is that Patrick was in prison at one time. Though frightened of Patrick, they approach him and convince Patrick to work on getting a date with Kat by tricking Joey, an egotistical guy with plenty of money who also wants to date Bianca, into bribing Patrick.

It takes Patrick quite a while to make it through the wall Kat has thrown up to keep everyone at arms length. Kat hates Patrick at first but his persistence pays off.

The scenes between Patrick and Kat, as their relationship develops, are charming. My favorite scenes are the book store scene, Patrick's tenderness to Kat after she gets herself drunk at a party, the paint ball scene, the music store scene, and most especially the scene where Patrick sings to Kat from the bleachers while she is in gym class playing soccer.

Why did I give this movie 4 stars if I liked it so much? Because this movie is an very loose adaptation based on Shakespeare's play ""The Taming of the Shrew"". In comparison with ""Clueless"", another teen romance movie which is a loose adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Emma"", this movie falls just short of the perfection of ""Clueless"". If ""Clueless"" is a 5 star movie, then this one must be a 4 star movie.",1173571200,3,2405,4.512643678160919
1053899,5,6305537798,"Regardless of whether 10 Things I Hate About You (from here on out referred to as 10 Things...)is based on a Shakespeare work or not, the end result has stayed relevent after all this time.

10 Things... is the only teen movie I can think of that falls into every possible cliche situation but somehow comes out on top every time. From Patrick singing across the football field to Kat to Bianca ditching the pretty-boy Joey for the newbie, unpopular, Cameron, for some reason it all works perfectly. I'm convinced the reason this film is so good and is able to carry such a worn plot is because of the cast. Julia Styles and Heath Ledger are really convincing as a couple and, oddly enough, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Larisa Oleynik also seem to work wonderfully together.

The plot revolves around five characters. Basically, Cameron and his school-showing guide/friend concieve this idea to get a rich guy named Joey to pay Patrick to date Kat, so that Cameron can date Kat's younger sister, Bianca. Cliches and chaos ensues!

10 Things... is your average boy gets girl/boy loses girl/boy gets girl back movie, times two since there's two relationships blossoming.

1053900,3,6305537798,"This is a well produced teenage-formula film, and for the genre, particulaly entertaining for young adults because it touches on issues such as relationships, the frustrations of young adolescence with great looking actors and a great soundtrack.

The screenwriter's suggest that the movie is a modern rendition of ""The Taming of the Shrew"", a Shakespearean comedy, a story about the taming of a bad tempered ""in your face"" young woman into submission.

As far as the film's connections to Shakespear's play, there are few.

Watching the film again, there are only a small number of connections and they are vague at best; connections one can count on one hand.

We have a bad tempered young woman and a suitor with a goal. There is a bet, something about ""taming"" the Shrew, but really, that's about it.

The theme of the film is about attaining ""true love"", against seemingly unbeatable odds. However, Shakespear's play is about ""taming"" a woman, a nasty shrew, bending Katharine to Petruchio's will! Altogether entirely different themes.

In the original play, Petruchio sees Katharine as a challenge, and once given her hand in marriage, abuses her into submission through starvation and intimidation.

At the play's end, there is a ""bet"" between the men on whose wife is the most obedient.

Petruchio wins the bet because he has essentially bullied Katherine into  an obedient, submissive wife.

All said and done, this film is an entertaining teenage collection of clichs' which really is designed to hold the attention of a young audience.

Ten Things...is musically a good buzz, most the actors performing tongue and cheek with a typical, feel-good Hollywood ending.

My only complaint, really, is the alleged connections to the 16th century play...because there is no substantial comparison...

For a teenage movie, however, one of the better one's.",1162684800,4,1858,5.153333333333333
1053901,4,6305537798,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. ""Ten Things I Hate About You"" is VERY LOOSELY based on William Shakespeare's comedic masterpiece, ""The Taming of the Shrew."" The film is set in a modern day high school. Kat (Julia Stiles) is an angry teenage girl who seems to loathe all men. Her younger sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is a popular girl who can't wait to immerse herself in the dating scene. Unfortunately for Bianca, her overprotective father (Larry Miller) is incredibly paranoid and doesn't want to see either of his daughters come within 50 feet of a member of the opposite sex. In order to pacify Bianca's constant complaints, her father finally concedes that he'll lift the dating ban as soon as man-hater Kat shoes an interest in boys, which is unlikely to happen in the near future. Once Bianca's potential beau (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finds out about this, he hires a mysterious classmate, Patrick (Heath Ledger), to feign an interest in Kat and loosen her up, thereby freeing up Bianca to date. At first Patrick is happy to oblige, but he is stunned when he begins to develop feelings for Kat, who isn't always as cold and collected as she appears to be.

This movie is very entertaining. As a big ""Taming of the Shrew"" fan, I really enjoyed the occasional snippets of Shakespearean dialogue. This film does an excellent job of reinventing Shakespeare in a very modern way. Also, the young cast is talented and fun to watch. Stiles and Ledger have good chemistry together and make a very cute onscreen couple. Overall, I was very impressed!",1156636800,24,1558,4.813432835820896
1053902,4,6305537798,"Of all the recent teen romantic comedies, I think this one is my favorite.  ""10 Things"" is (losely) based on Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew.""  The movie is about Kat (the Shrew) who is a anti social outsider.  Unfortunately her younger and more popular sister Bianca cannot date until Kat starts dating.  Various suitors of Bianca's conspire to free her by hiring the school bad boy Patrick to date Kat.

I love the fact that both the lead characters are somewhat outsiders in high school, rather than following usual story arc for a teen romance where at least one of the leads is part of the ""in crowd.""  The character of Kat is also very refreshing.  She is a strong willed and feminist, but remains sexy and human rather than a Hollywood sterotype.

I also loved the setting of the movie in Seattle, Washington.  What a departure from the vast majority of teen movies which usually take place in California!  I especially like the school where the film was shot, which is a real High School in Tacoma.  Compared to where I went to high school, the school in this film is absolutely sureal and it definately gives a certain feeling of fantasy to the movie.

Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles are perfect as the leads.  Both were very young when this movie was filmed, but you could tell then they had talent and would go far.  Julia Stiles really impresses with her ability to be sexy, strong and even vulnerable all at the same time.  The supporting cast is also excellent.  Larisa Olenik gives a great performance as the beautiful and naive Bianca.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Cameron, the boy who will do anything for Bianca. I also liked Andrew Keegan as the vain and vapid Joey who also is after Bianca, but for less than honorable reasons.

The movie does have some cliche's of the teen comedy genre, but the story is surprisingly clever and engaging, the characters are charming, and the setting in Seattle is fantastic and fresh.  I highly recommend ""10 Things I Hate About You.""",1154822400,3,1994,4.645714285714286
1053903,4,6305537798,"This movie is without a doubt one of those movies that seems to ""stake it's claim"" sort of to speak within many peoples minds, including mine.

I'm 23 years of age as I type this. I will be 24 years old in the next few weeks, and I finally seen this movie for the first time this past week, and I have to tell you, I'm sorry I didn't see it sooner. Especially when the movie was first released in 1999, when I would have been 17, and could have related all the more to the people in this movie.

This movie, an adaptation of ""taming the shrew"", and is set in modern day times at a school in Washington state if I'm not mistaken. The cast really brings the characters of this movie to life, and the situations the characters find themselves in are very typical of those the teen-ager in high school finds themselves in.

This movie has the teen romance story, which is typical of most movies, but involves a few more twists than the average plot. The plot also involves difference characters with different views and standpoints on life in High school, but they all come together to make the plot of the movie work in a fashion that is very likeable, I would imagine for anyone of any age. It really brings to life the teen-ager I think exists within us all.

This is one of those movies you will enjoy watching over and over again, especially for certain scense, such as when Patrick (Heath Ledger) performs his musical to gain favor in the sight of Kat (Julia Stiles). Or the part of the movie where Kat, enraged at Joey(another guy in the movie) for pulling in behind her, and blocking her way, backs her car purposely into his Z28 Camaro.....OUCH! There is also some odd humor in this movie, such as when Patrick and Cameron are talking, and when Patrick, after being informed by Cameron that Bianca kissed him asks where Bianca kissed Cameron, Cameron responds by saying ""In the car"".....lol.

I don't want to say anymore, as I don't want to give all the scenes away. I will simply say if you've ever seen any teen-movie that you liked, then you will LOVE this movie.",1147824000,5,2071,4.4109947643979055

The movie that is set on a gorgeous school campus shows the different high school groups and how they are split. Although they are a little exaggerated, it shows what many high schoolers go through in trying to fit in. It is easy to relate to, not always being the most popular kid in class but still trying to fit in the ""jocks"" or ""cheerleaders"". Another great part of the movie is the stars. Heath Ledger is not only an amazing actor but easy on the eyes too. Heath's supporting actor, Julia Stiles, is also a good actor and they both fit their specific roles perfectly. After a game of cat and mouse between the two, the fairytale ending brings the two lovers together. The movie also has a wonderful sound track.

1053906,5,6305537798,"No matter how old I get, I'll never be too old to enjoy a good teen movie.  Yes, it's rather formulaic, but 10 Things I Hate About You is smart and funny and more intelligent than your average teen comedy.  It also stars Julia Styles, which is a definite plus in my book.  I can't say my high school was anything like Padua High (how many high schools take place in a huge castle?), and I certainly never had an English teacher like the one teaching here, but every high school is pretty much the same when it comes to cliques, romances, misunderstandings, sibling rivalries, and the like.  One of the things I really liked about this film is the fact that it didn't break down according to the overused formula of rich kids vs. poor kids and never the twain shall meet (unless you're, say, Molly Ringwald).

It's true that this film is loosely inspired by Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, but don't make too much of that.  How many teens would even know what a shrew is?  Personally, I don't look at Kat Stratford (Julia Styles) as a shrew; she's just a bitter, disillusioned teen who can't stand the thought of doing what is expected of her - and she does have reasons for taking on this persona.  Her sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is her exact opposite, a vivacious girl who just wants to be a normal teenager.  Her problem is the girls' overprotective father, who refuses to let Bianca date until Kat starts dating (which doesn't look like it will be happening any time soon given Kat's nature).  The new kid in school, Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), is smitten with Bianca, and he puts together a plan to make her date-eligible by having someone else take out her sister - ingeniously using the school's pitifully shallow cool guy (and Bianca admirer) as the middle man.  The chosen one is the school's mysterious new tough guy, who has to earn the money he's being paid to win the reluctant Kat over.  Obviously, he ends up falling for the girl, which puts everything in place for the predictable conclusion.  Will Kat and the designated dater become a couple, or will everything explode in the guy's face?  Will Bianca ever win the right to get out of the house and spread her perkiness all around?  And who will Bianca choose - the hot, brainless Mr. Cool or Cameron, the nice boy who looks like he should still be in junior high?  And, since she's already taller than the guy, will Bianca ever stop putting her hair up when she goes out with him?

Clichs abound, but the script really is rather witty.  For those keeping score at home, the film does feature one wild dance party and the required minimum of one barfing scene, but it never crosses the line into a completely dumb teen comedy.  10 Things I Hate About You isn't quite as good as the classic John Hughes films of the 1980s, but it's easily better than most of the teen films produced in recent years.  With its PG-13 rating, it's also a teen movie suitable for teens of all ages - a little table dancing is about as racy as this one gets.",1143417600,7,3018,4.482632541133455

The ending may be all too perfect and happy but by the end you'll just love Julia Stiles' character sooo much that you'll be glad for her.

1053972,5,6305537798,"Nothing to Hate about this Film

10 Things I Hate about You is one of the best films made in our generation for our generation. Although it is loosely based off of the Shakespeare play Taming of the Shrew, One could not tell this unless he/she were to see the play close to when the movie came out. The screenwriters did an excellent job covering up the fact that the plot is centuries old. This modern day version is set in a high school, a very strange place for a Shakespeare play. Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik), a sophomore, is the lovely daughter of a gynecologist who delivers babies for a living. Her father makes a rule that she cannot date until her sister, Kat (Julia Stiles), does, a heartless senior who could not care less about men. This has never been a problem before but now there is a new boy, Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) who moved to town and they both have an eye for each other. In a desperate attempt to be able to date the lovely Bianca, Joey interviews some tough guys from school. None of them are willing to try to date Kat. Finally, Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger), a senior who just moved into the area, is willing to do the dirty job, but for some cash. This means that Bianca and her prince can engage in several dates. The dad, meanwhile, is going ballistic, his plan to keep Bianca from dating, forever, is going south. The next thing that he knows Kat wants to go to the Prom with Patrick, which da! da! da! means that Bianca can go too. The movie was an overall success. The plot was interesting, thanks to Shakespeare, but with a new twist that renews the old love story into one that can be enjoyed by our generation. While it did not follow the play exactly, it did do a wonderful job sticking to the basic ideas and keeping the overall emotions the same.",1140134400,,1794,4.37125748502994

I got my cousins hooked on it too, and they were only 10-12 years old. It somewhat became a tradition for us to watch it together when we spent the night at each other's house. So this movie really does have a special place in my heart. It's fresh, modern, and entertaining. Unlike most teen movies, all the actors can act, and even though there are many one liners, they work.

But the fact remains, this movie is just irresistable.  It's one of the few ""teen movies"" that seems to remain totally watchable over and over again.  The performances are all terrific, down to even  the smaller roles (Daryl ""Chill"" Mitchell as Mr. Morgan the take-no-prisoners English teacher and Allison Janney as Ms. Perky, the brutally efficient romance-novel-writing guidance counselor).  While there's a certain amount of stereotyping going on amid the ""geeks"" and the ""cool kids"", both types are portrayed with more humor and complexity than usual.  The story's take on Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew is, like other reviewers have indicated, a good balance between faithfulness and fun.  Also, the music soundtrack (featuring a number of songs by Letters By Cleo) seems to be aging quite well (always a hazard in a movie of this sort).  But let's face it:  The movie is worth watching, simply to see Heath Ledger lip-sync the song ""Can't Take My Eyes Off of You"" in front of the girls' soccer squad.  Can't take my eyes off of you??

I also like the message that being yourself is what makes you cool in your own right. If you ever had strict parents, you can relate to the Stratford daughters.

It must be admitted that the movie is very loosely based on TAMING OF THE SHREW but the operative words are VERY LOOSELY. Some of the names are right and the rough outline of the idea are there as is the shrewish nature of the elder daghter. After that, the divergance goes pretty wide. That didn't stop it from being a good show.

The premise of the story is that there are two daughters with a controlling father. Everyone wants to date the youngest daughter but there is a catch. The younger cannot date until the elder does. Since the eldest is so hard to get along with, Pop thinks that the girls will be safe well into their 40's. That doesn't stop the scheming. A boy is paid to get the elder to go out with him, opening the way for the younger. No one couted on them falling for each other.

Some of the elements of Shakespeare's play are not present. This is almost mandatory since the original is anything but politically correct. Kate, the eldest, is played as a shrew but she never becomes tamed. Her famous speech from act 5, or an analog, is not present. Neither are the identities of Bianca's suitors switched to fool the dad. As I said, it was loosely based.

I never heard of either of the girls playing the leads but they do a good job. The father seemed familiar, though I don't know his name, and did a great job in his role racking up the laughs. Other minor parts also added magnificently to the whole.

The father in the movie was much different than that of Batista in Taming, having more of a stricter personality toward his daughters.  But in Taming, Batista was much more outgoing and happy with the suitors.  As the general plot of the movie goes, it takes a modern turn and is set a high school.

People who are new to the Shakespearian cover scene are introduced to characters who, for the most part, are easily identifiable. The high school's name is Padua, as is the town in ""Taming of the Shrew"". (Which, by the way, is where this movie took its plot from. Come on, everyone should know that by now.) I found the humor to be very substantial, meaning for the most part there was always something to keep me laughing. And that is important.

In the play Petruchio tames her by giving her a dose of her own medicine. The movie really helps you figure out what is going on in the play. It helps to give you a sense of who all of the characters are. I would recommend watching this movie before and after you read the play. That way you will have a feel for the characters and when you are done with the play you can compare and contrast.",1114560000,,734,4.404411764705882
1054106,3,6305537798,"Ten Things I Hate About You brings a great overview of the Shakespeare play, Taming of the Shrew. The wittiness and attitude are there definitely for the two sisters, Bianca and Kate. Instead of finding a husband though, the girls in the movie are trying to get dates for the high school prom. Petruchio is the tamer and seems to have a different strategy in the movie. In the play he is very overpowering and demanding, while in the movie he seems to tame her by doing sweet things after he messes up. There is one main example of how these two versions do not relate though, and that is how in the play it is as if Katherina is playing Petrucio like a fool by doing as he wants and it doesn't even seem like she is in love with him. In the movie though, Kate still shows acts of not liking him, but overall she falls madly in love with him and it is like a dream come true. Overall, I believe that This movie was a good example of a relation to Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew.",1114560000,,981,4.168421052631579

The movie is portrayed as a love story with Patrick making Kate fall in love with him with his charm. But this is no where near the attitude of Pertruchio in The Taming of the Shrew, where he treats Kate very poorly in order to ""tame"" her from the way she has always been. He makes her fast and not sleep for an extended period of time by ""killing her with kindness"".

I liked the play but was a little confused as to where all the characters and plots fit together.  So, to help my class better understand the play, my teacher had us watch ""10 Things I Hate About You"" as we read.  As many people may or may not know this movie is a modernized version of the Shakespeare play ""The Taming of the Shrew.""  Believe it or not the movie did help clarify the confusion I was having with the play.  This movie followed the general plot of the play very close, but also put a modern spin on it to make it more relatable to today's standards. I liked the movie and would have watched and enjoyed it even if I wasn't watching it for a class. I would recommend it to others to watch.",1114473600,2,788,4.124183006535947
1054109,5,6305537798,"10: Solid writing! 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU has all the potential of being a real yawner but the screenplay comes through crisply with lines that will have you quoting them again and again.

9: Excellent story! Yes, the immortal bard had a hand in this one but the writers, actors and director put it on the screen as more than a simple modified Shakespeare play.

8: Unpatronizing high school scenario. Often with movies like this, where the set is the local high school, you feel as a viewer that you've been taken hostage and imprisoned.  Not so with this one.  It's about kids in high school but there is so much in the characters that it's easy to see it more as a gathering of interesting individuals than a high school story.

7. A great adult supporting cast! Too often in movies like this the adults are portrayed as nothing more than brainless morons. Performances here by Larry Miller (Mr. Walter Stratford), Daryl Mitchell (Mr. Morgan), Allison Janney (Ms. Perky) and David Leisure (Mr. Chapin) are hilarious. Crazy, yes, but they don't play second fiddle to any of the teenagers.

6. Andrew Keegan. Keegan plays the airheaded, self-absorbed Joey Donner, the delusional ""King of the Campus."" Keegan is so good that you'll absolutely love hating him.

5. David Krumholtz. The deadpan actor who came to the screen as Bernard, the elf, in THE SANTA CLAUSE, is terrific as a campus nerd, Michael Eckman who accepts his place while showing that he is really the one in-the-know.

4. Larisa Oleynik is wonderful as the spoiled and nave Bianca Stratford. While it would be easy to take the role south as an abysmal airhead, Oleynik is delightfully on the level, inexperienced but not stupid.

3. Joseph Gordon-Levitt. JGL, late of classics like A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT, ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD and THIRD ROCK FROM THE SUN is absolutely irresistible as Cameron James, the new kid on campus who is befriended by Michael Eckman. The story revolves around his efforts to win the heart of Bianca Stratford.

2. Julia Stiles is surprisingly good as the Bianca's antisocial older sister, Katarina ""Kat"" Stratford, and

1. Heath Ledger, as Patrick ""Pat"" Verona, does a sensational job of portraying the local misunderstood bad guy. Ledger's versatility is incredible and his role here is another winning performance to add to the likes of those in THE PATRIOT and A KNIGHT'S TALE.

So there they are, ten things to love about 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU.

1054110,4,6305537798,"This is the story of the Stratford sisters (nice in-joke that one), Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) and Katerina (Julia Stiles). Bianca is the babe of Padua High, the heart's desire of all hormonally-charged young guys there. Elder sister Kat, is not. Now it just so happens that the rules of the Stratford household are that Bianca can get to date when Kat goes on a date. Since Kat is, by choice, date-challenged, Bianca is frustrated, as are her new French tutor Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and model/hunk Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan), both desirous of the attentions of Bianca. So Cameron and new Padua High nerdy mate Michael Eckman (David Krumholtz) hatch a little plan to get Kat a date with anyone and score a date with Bianca for Cameron. The plan involves the money-enhanced Joey Donner (who naturally thinks he is to be the recipient of the date with Bianca) paying one Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to date Kat. As you can imagine, a tangled web is created, especially when Patrick actually falls for Kat, Cameron realizes that Bianca wants Joey, and Bianca realizes that she cannot stand Joey and wants Cameron.
This is the sort of tangled web of a story that only a hack like Shakespeare can actually carry off with ease, and this version of the tale has certainly been updated well. The story has been well brought to life by a cast of essentially up-and-comers, with some nice enough performances on offer. I would like to say that Heath Ledger was one of the notable performances, but here he is somewhat overshadowed by Julia Stiles in my view. In general, the consistency of the cast is the main asset here rather than any being especially stellar. The direction is not much more than a typical by-the-numbers effort by a rent-a-director type that seems to be the norm for the Disney conglomerate.
10 Things I Hate About You is a better-than-expected film that I actually quite enjoy. It demonstrates the continued relevance of William Shakespeare in modern day life, and is a most worthwhile effort.",1103846400,,2013,4.820809248554913

Camron and Micheal come up with a plan, have Joey pay Patrick to go out with Kat so that Camron can go out with Bianca.

There are some problems such as Bianca liking Joey initially, and Kat not liking Patrick. Patrick grows on Kat though and they fall in love. Camron eventually gets Bianca after Kat tells her that Joey slept with her then dumpt her after she told him that she wasn't ready.

At the prom Kat finds out that Patrick was payed to take her out by Joey and Bianca finds out the only reason why Joey was interested in her was because he wanted to take her virginity. Bianca then procieds to beat Joey up.

Things work out at the end though. Camron and Bianca are together, and Patrick and Kat get back together after he buys her a guitar she had been looking at.",1103155200,3,1019,4.2642487046632125

Inside of people trying to change others to conform we have a lead character with some spunk and a 'take me as I am' attitude which is refreshing.

It has the normal teenage theme of romance with the wrong kind of person but is still one of my favourites.

This movie is good, but when I found out it was an extremely butchered version of a shakespeare play, I was kind of apalled that it had none of the acting charisma of shakespeare and it was so loosely based on the play (who went to prom in the 17th century?)that you felt like you were watching just an ""average teen movie"". but, all hating aside, this was a good movie that I recommend to anyone who isn't a shakespeare purist. Heath Ledger's charm definitely lent a hand to this movie. I love Julia Stile's bitterness but before she shows it, we all know she has a soft side.",1095120000,,582,4.3

Did you hate Shakespeare In Love? You'll love this because it avoids craming all the little cute parallels down your throat. Have no idea what I am talking about?

1054181,3,6305537798,"Whatever happened to Julia Stiles?  When this movie came out, she and Kirsten Dunst were neck and neck for IT GIRL of Hollywood, and for awhile one would rise up and the other fall, but they had pretty much an even spread.  But now, when I watch TEN THINGS her greatest moment in films, she looks dowdy and the outfits they put her in look horrid.  Meanwhile Dunst goes from good to better roles.  Someone should tell Julia Stiles that with a big face like hers, bangs are better.  And whatever happened to Heath Ledger?  At the time this movie was released, he looked like the next big thing, with a big part in THE PATRIOT, etc, and a bright future.  Now it's like, Heath who?  And starring in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is really going to help his career.

Well, all in all, now that THE O C is on TV, why even watch TEN THINGS again?  It's almost the same show, and the girl who plays Bianca here might as well be rehearsing for the part of Summer, and her boyfriend Joey uses the same coy quips as Seth Cohen.  The OC's leads are more attractive than STILES and LEDGER and all in all, it's a more satisfying experience all the way around and at least SUMMER never wore a prom dress as hideous as the one poor BIANCA has to appear in.

Years later as I re-read some of my old reviews, I'm mortified by the things I wrote about this film!  Kirsten Dunst doesn't seem like the IT Girl any more than poor Julia Stiles.  Time passes so quickly when you're young and incandescent and the camera's trained its eye on you.  Since I wrote the above, The O.C. came and went, and so did Heath, although he did make his comeback right in a big way before his terrible death by misadventure.  And BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was a great part for him and he handled it beautifully.  So I was wrong everywhere.  And now that he is gone he can watch his performance in this film, 10 Things I Hate About You, from different perspectives, and mourn all the promise shown that we are now bereft of.",1092787200,2,1967,4.284552845528455
1054182,3,6305537798,"I liked the film because it was a hip take on Shakespere's The Taming of the Shrew. It was creative in that spin, yet it was to slapstick to take on a deeper intent. I enjoyed that Heath Ledger really showed a comic and fun character to us. I haven't seen him like that in his more recent movies. Julia Stiles is good as a bitchy teen, taking on the shrew role quite well. I also really liked the counselor, Ms. Perky. She just did was really funny acting like the romantic writer slash autoritarian. It was a pretty much a basic formula for teen films, excepting the 2 leads. One of the actors I have seen before in a movie, he played the other guy dating Stiles popular sister. The movie was pretty much boy meets girl, falls for girl, girl takes a while being a shrew than falls for boy. The other side story is the sister who is completely opposite, bordering on shallow while her sister is deep. She also has the similiar thing going, boy meets girl, girl takes a while to warm up, than girl falls for boy. Oh well, it was a fun film and not a waste of time.

It's a hard trip to get Kat in a liking happy mood, much less to get her to a party that she must attend dually with her sister, or else.  The girl's have to live with an overbearing father who takes good watch over his girls.

1054187,4,6305537798,"This movie is the only movie that I actually have fully memorized.  I'm not talking the kind of memorization where you can recite it only if it's playing at the same time.  I'm talking the kind of memorization where you sit and recite scenes when you're bored.
This is because I've been absolutely hooked on this movie ever since I first saw it in theaters.  It could have been the plot that got me. Sophomore Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) wants to date. In particular, she wants to date Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan).  The only thing stopping her is the ulimate rule in her house: NO DATING UNTIL YOU GRADUATE.  Bianca appeals to her single father (Larry Miller), who finally concedes and makes a new rule just as challenging as the first: Bianca could date when her sister did. The roadblock?  Bianca's sister, senior Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles), could quite possibly be more against dating in high school than her dad.  Enter Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), new kid to school with a major crush on Bianca, and his friend, Michael (David Krumholtz), who plot to get Kat dating so that, in turn, Bianca will start dating.  The rest of the movie involves Cameron and Michael doing just that, with Patrick (a brown-haired Heath Ledger) engaging in their little game along with the less knowing mega-hotshot Joey.
Maybe it was the characters. Kat Stratford has an unchanging, bitter attitude about being yourself and not doing something just because everyone else is. Bianca loves to conform and be popular - basically the exact opposite of Kat. Larry Miller does a great job in his role as the sisters' overprotective dad who's ""up to [his] elbows in placenta all day long"" in his career as a doctor and is obsessed with keeping his daughters from growing up.  Cameron is easily likable, a boy who becomes fixed on making Bianca his own (pure intentions).  Joey is just as easily not likable as a boy who is also fixed on making Bianca his own (impure intentions). Michael is perfect as an awkward teenager who, I suppose, most would describe as being the ""geek"" of the movie, while I would disagree (ex., being the one who comes up with the ""Joey's just a pawn"" plan).  Patrick is hilarious in his attempts to capture Kat's attention.  Other noteworthy characters include Ms. Perky, the unhelpful guidance counselor secretly writing a dirty romance novel; Mr. Morgan, the  Shakespeare-rapping English teacher; and the gym teacher/soccer coach who is the perfect comedic tool.
Maybe it was the memorable scenes: Bianca at prom, the detention room, the stadium serenade, Boogie's party, the motorbike, and Kat in English class, just to name a few.
I'm not sure what exactly it is about 10 Things I Hate About You - the characters, the plot, the scenes, the catchy Letters to Cleo tune - but it's a movie for anybody who wants a good laugh and wants to see how crazy somebody else's life can get.

An all-star cast including, Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger and Larisa Oleynik. This movie has a few memorable moments in it that won't be forgotten easily. Such as when Heath Ledger began to sing in front of the soccer team, When Julia Stiles flashed a teacher (no nudity, damn!) When Julia Stiles dances to a little bit of Biggie at a big party or when Larisa Oleynik beat the hell out of this dude.
This movie is about a beautiful popular girl (Larisa Oleynik)  that isn't allowed to go out period, but when her father says that she may date as soon as her unpopular weird sister (Julia Stiles) begins to, a dude that has a crush on the popular girl pays this dude (Heath Ledger) a overall bad ass to date Julia Stiles, thats when things get crazy with Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles falling in love and two guys after Larisa Oleynik things heat up in this hilarious and clever comedy.

I could go into more detail - mostly I just thought the plot rang true - the emotions were 'right' for their situation such that the whole thing held together very well. It didn't require a straw-man or morons to get cummupeance - the psych of the movie felt fully formed, and it was fun to go along for the ride.
 It didn't hurt that the actors were all naturally sympathetic and beautiful in a likeable, friendly way, so I would probably be dragged in even if it wasn't so well-built in other ways, avoiding the usual pitfalls and flaws that usually come from aiming at teenagers.

i have to say i loved this movie, yet it is a teen movie, yes it is an adaptation of shakespeare taming of the shrew (and i don't really like shakespeare), but it was funny, witty, romantic, and sarcastic, my life in a nutshell!
If you needed to find the quintissential romantic-comedy teen flic, besides preety in pink, it would be this (not clueless)it's got everything a young girl want, and the songs, would bring a small to your face (im not saing it's good or bad), it just will",1068595200,,722,4.3161764705882355
1054210,2,6305537798,"I had read the reviews as well as heard my friends' opinions on this movie and had thought that it would be great and witty and funny...and it was a great disappointment.
Kat and Bianca are sisters in the same school, Bianca being popular and Kat the polar opposite. Popular boy Joey wants Bianca and she feels likewise. However, their dad won't let Bianca date unless Kat does...which seems impossible to him. In order to have Bianca, Joey pays Patrick to woo Kat and date her. Seeing the money, Pat goes for it, only to fall in love with Kat...even though he's still taking money. Cameron is also in love with Bianca and had planned to tell Joey to pay Pat so that when Bianca can date, she would choose him. However, his plot is foiled until the end, when Bianca realizes what a bastard Joey is.
When I had seen the trailer, with Heath Ledger singing, I had thought this was when their true feelings are revealed. Little did I know that he was still taking money from Joey. This just seemed very much like betrayal to me and I didn't like that in a romantic comedy. I would never be able to forgive the guy as quickly as Kat did.
Also, I felt that there were so many subplots that the movie was all over the place. It felt as if the director was trying to ram all this information into and hour and something of film. As a result, many of the subplots are underdeveloped. Such as the romance between Cameron's geeky friend and Kat's Shakespearean addict friend. Also, Cameron and Bianca barely had any chemistry and Cameron's reasons for transferring are never referred to...he was just there one day, saw Bianca and wanted her. Joey and Bianca's ""relationship"" was also very fuzzy. Not to mention the part where Kat reveals to Bianca the very reason why she hates Joey and Bianca storms out of the room in anger.
The only redeeming qualities of this movie is the hilarious counselor and Kat and Bianca's father, who's comical talent is seen in this film, which is why it received two stars instead of one.",1068336000,,2009,4.491803278688525

Some of the gags, e.g. where the archery teacher gets shot in the butt, didn't fit in the film at all. It was more like spoof comedy and just made the film even more unbelievable. Luckily i only rented this and didn't waste my money buying it. The main characters are only just likeable, and coupled with a bad script, make this film an embrassment to the whole teen/romantic comedy genre.",1067385600,5,682,4.404761904761905
1054212,2,6305537798,"This movie is as lame and predictable as many teen films.  Julia Stiles' acting is stale --although as usual there's no denying her screen presence, the dialogue sounds like it was written between takes and the rest of the cast are cardboard cut outs of high school stereotypes.  I'm not knocking teen films because I happen to like teen films even though I probably outgrew them long ago but this one is pretty bad.
However, this movie has a few saving graces.  First of all it's a modern version of Taming of the Shrew.  And, it name-drops a few literary giants along the way (due to Kat's unquenchable thirst for literature!). Also, Allison Janney is priceless as a guidance counseler/wannabe romance writer. And, the rantings of Bianca and Kat's father about teen pregnancy are very funny. Finally, the firey Heath Ledger as high school bad boy makes the last half of the film bearable.  I'd throw in an extra half star for these things alone.",1066694400,,947,4.715151515151515

1054228,4,6305537798,"I like this movie a lot.  I saw it in the theaters and have the DVD.  It's a teen love story based on Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew (loosely based!).  The story is about the shrew (Kat/Julia Stiles) and her sister Bianca.  The new boy in town wants to date Bianca, but Bianca can't date unless Kat does.  So he hatches a plan to get Kat hooked with someone so that he can date Bianca.
I think the story is cute, and I completely fell for Heath Ledger's character, Patrick (the guy who gets paid to date Kat).  He and Julia Stiles are great in this movie - the other characters, however, leave a lot to be desired.  I can't for the life of me figure out why anyone would WANT to date Bianca. Sure, she's pretty - but she's got no personality until the very end.  It's not bad though, since most of the story revolves around Kat and Patrick who are well developed characters with a lot of chemistry.

1054230,5,6305537798,"Generally speaking I abhor most of the films sheltering under the umbrella-genre of ""teen comedy"". The idea of a film made specifically to gratify the insecure and the horny makes me kind of queasy. In an entertained sort of way.
But...10 Things I Hate About You, despite its cringe-worthy title, is a cut and a jump above the rest. Lay to rest the ghosts of ""She's All That"" and other related Freddie Prince Jnr cast-offs and worship at the altar of a truly funny slice of teen life.
You know the drill. 10 Things is based loosely around the lesser-known Shakespeare play ""The Taming of the Shrew"". And, against all expectations the adaptation is intelligently done. The interaction of Shakespearian dialogue and ultra-trendy American teen speak is blended without hesitation. ""I burn, I perish, I pine..."" proclaims the love-struck Cameron in the words of the bard himself. ""Put her in your spank-bank and move on"" replies his Tranio-a-like sidekick Michael. The more you know about the Shakespeare play, the more you'll appreciate the subtleties of 10 Thing's referencing. Of course the plot isn't exact, but its themes are maintained in healthy condition throughout.
So, this is a production that didn't take its script-writing according to formular. Some of the one-liners are literally classic, and the supporting cast, particularly Miss Perky, school councillar and erotic novelist extroadinaire, are different and lively.
That doesn't mean, however, that the star acting suffers. The cast has strong leaders in Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles, both of whom transcend and epitomise the teen hero/heroine simultaneously. Refreshingly, Stile's character doesn't succumb to being objectified by her inevitable good lucks. Ledger doesn't just convince her that wearing a dress is going to make her a more convincing ""girl"". Of course guy does get girl, but in the same way girl thoroughly establishes herself as equal to said guy. And looses none of her expressive capacity.
The scaffolding sub-plot also turns out some cracking performances from the likes of Joseph Gordon-Hewitt as Cameron (you'll recognise him as the kid from 3rd Rock from the Sun), and the pretty Larisa Oleynik as Bianca.
Mix all of the above ... with the likes of Letters from Cleo enjoying several cameo moments and you've got a movie that could very well join ""Empire Records"" as teen classic material.",1057363200,3,2379,5.149870801033591

You know all the basics: based on ""Taming of the Shrew"", Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger, yadda yadda yadda.  What makes ""10 Things"" rise above its more drecky cousins (""Cruel Intentions"", ""Drive Me Crazy"", and anything -- whether based on classic literature or not -- that had Freddie Prinze, Jr. within 50 yards of it) is the fact that this film came with a well-written script, and the director and producers put actors in who could handle the comedy.  In addition to Julia Stiles, major kudos go out to Darryl ""Chill"" Mitchell (the wise-cracking English teacher) and Allison Janney (the erotica-writing guidance counselor) for their performances.
Definitely one to add to the collection, even if it's as a guilty pleasure.",1051574400,2,930,4.734567901234568

Regarding teen movies, isn't it funny how they're often better when they're based upon classic source material? I mean, this one, based upon ""Taming of the Shrew,"" is top-shelf entertainment, and ""Clueless,"" based on Jane Austen's ""Emma,"" is a terrific, witty movie. And the movie ""O,"" based upon ""Othello"" and featuring Julia Stiles, is an amazing, bleak drama.

The genre of teen movies is considered by many as an easy target for criticism, which of course is not completely unjustified. Nevertheless, films belonging to that genre are not necessarily full of flaws. ""10 things I hate about you"" is such an example.
I have not read Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew"" so I cannot say if the script of ""10 things I hate about you"" is close to the Bard's original work, from which it was inspired. What I can say though, is that ""10 things I hate about you"" is a fresh, witty movie with sharp dialogs and a rather interesting set of characters.
The plot: What can you do when your high school love interest is not allowed to go on a date with you, unless her older sister first goes on a date herself? What about becoming an ally with your main rival in order to find a guy capable of dating the older sister?
Larisa Oleynik plays Bianca, the pretty, always in fashion but rather shallow, younger sister. Kat (Julia Stiles) is the older sister. She is the one that has to go on a date first, if her younger sister can go out too. The problem is that Kat is unpopular and ""incapable of human interaction"".
Bianca immediately catches the attention of Cameron (Joseph-Gordon Levitt), the likable, smart (how else would he be able to learn French so quickly??), and shy, new boy on the block. Cameron with his friend (David Krumholtz, in a role that provides some good moments of laugh) will have to try and persuade the wild and scary Patrick (Heath Ledger), who may not be that wild and scary after all, to go out with Kat. Of course, there is the ""bad"" guy, played by Andrew Keegan, who will try to mess things up, just when everything seems to lead to a happy ending.
I especially liked the Kat-Patrick couple. Stiles and Ledger definitely have the required chemistry and are able to make us believe how their relationship gradually develops into genuine love.
Apart from the main characters, a big asset of the film is the supporting characters, like the English teacher (who makes a habit of throwing Kat out of his class, without any apparent reason) or the sex-obsessed counselor (who tries hard to find fitting words for her new novel...)
Overall, ""10 things I hate about you"" offers quite a number of moments of genuine laughter, without ever resorting to cheap or crude humor. It is a movie that you will enjoy, if you know what to expect.
One thing though, I have to note as a negative: there were no real extras in the DVD version to completely justify such a purchase.",1027555200,2,2664,4.494845360824742

I was pleasantly surprised when I first saw this cute, charming movie. Joseph Gordon Levitt(""3rd Rock From The Sun"") plays Cameron. He has moved to Seattle and is the new kid in school. He quickly befriends a geek(David Krumholtz from ""The Santa Clause""), who gives him the run down of the school and it's students. Cameron falls madly in love with Bianca Stratford(Larissa Oleynick, who, coincidentally, played his girlfriend for a while on ""3rd Rock""). Bianca is a the quintessential popular, beloved, rich girl who is untouchable. Cameron makes it his mission to get to her. Then there is Bianca's sister Kat(Julia Stiles). She is the 'Anti-Bianca'. She is tough, sharp mouthed, and generally hates people. Their dad, who is played the always watchable Larry Miller, makes a deal with his daughters. Bianca can date as soon as Kat does. Bianca is upset because Kat doesn't want to date. This begins Cameron's mission. He and his friend enlist a tough, brooding guy named Patrick(Heath Ledger)to start wooing Kat, for cash, supplied by empty, pretty boy Joey(Andrew Keegan of ""7th Heaven"").If he succeeds, then Cameron can date Bianca. Naturally, things get complicated and awful before they can get better and work out for everyone involved. The film is based on William Shakespeare's ""The Taming Of The Shrew"". Julia Stiles was first noticed with this film. There is something so intoxicating about her. She has a special quality to her that is irresistable. Her smile is a wondrous thing. She is a star. The movie is very funny, and surprisingly funny in some ways. The dialogue is pretty clever, sharp, and well written. It is head and shoulders above most teen comedies of the last decade. The actors are all well suited for their roles and are enjoyable to watch. Larissa Oleynick is as cute as a bug. Allison Janney from ""The West Wing"" has a hilarious, but all too brief role as the school's guidance councelor who is in the middle of writing a trashy sex novel. David Leisure also appears as the gym teacher. It is unfair that this movie has to have the tag of ""teen movie"" attached to it. To some people, that equals poison. Especially in this day and age. I'm telling you right now people, this movie is better than that. This is enjoyable for any age. It's funny, cute, and has more depth and intelligence than most of these movies combined. If only all teen movies of this modern era could be as delightful as this one. There are many things to like about this movie, but the 10 things I love about this movie are:Julia Stiles, Julia Stiles, Julia Stiles, Julia Stiles, Julia Stiles, Julia Stiles, Julia Stiles, Julia Stiles, Julia Stiles, Julia Stiles.

1054426,5,6305537798,"My reasons for why I love this movie. In no particular order.
1) It is a teen movie but NOT a teen movie
2) The way Shakespeare is thrown in every so often so that it connects to the original writer of the play. Patrick Verona (where most of Will's plays are set), the school is a character. Mandala's hapless and hopeless obsession with him 'we are one'as she puts it
3) I am not a feminist, but Kat played one kick[ing]girl for her time.
4) How well the movie was adapted by Gil Junger from the play. Original plot and even lines! were in the movie
5) Incredible likeable actors. Both estetically pleasing, Heath and Julia are great actors. Considering it was Heath's first role, he stood out incredible.
6) The 'witty repartee' of the movie. How could anyone not like the line ""Am I that transparent? I need you, I want you, oh baby, oh baby"".
7) The smooth dialogue throughout the movie. Very quick responses from each character
8) The secondary characters never lacked screen time and were not made to look like supporting characters
9) How well the actors cemented their roles to how good old William protrayed the characters way back when. Really, you would think it was Shakespearen actors trying to invent 'our days'
10) The moral issues it comes out with. The pregnancy suit that Bianca has to wear. No smoking, no drinking (except when Kat shows her 'stunning digestive pyrotechnics'.
And in true 10 Things fashion, I had one four more. See number 12 to understand my reasoning.
11) Mrs. Perky
12) The end when Julia recites the poem that is obviously written about her love interest, Patrick Verona. The ironic part of it, there are 14 things she mentions she hates, not 10. Count it, you will see that I am right.
13) The music that fit into every scene. From Club Skunk to the prom to when Patricka and Kat play paint ball.
14) How finally, the slimy bad guy who was after Bianca got decked.",1019433600,,1905,4.508670520231214

Because it was based off a Shakespearean play, it doesn't seem as contrived as most recent teen genre movies -- but don't let that fool you.  It still manages to be contrived, but in a fun way.  This film does what it's supposed to do -- entertain young people.  I mean, what do you expect out of it -- Shakespear?",1018828800,,431,4.271604938271605

I'm 33, bitter and cynical, for crying out loud, I can't be seen paying to see these movies...  But when it was released on DVD, I decided to give it a stab (having OD'd on 'Kiss Me, Kate' and the Taylor/Burton 'Shrew' earlier in the week) and watch it after work one night, with my husband and kids asleep in their rooms, so my descent into teeniebopper movies would remain my own evil skeleton in the closet...
I kept finding myself having to cover my mouth with my hand, to stifle the laughter.  Julia Stiles really stood out, as did Susan May Pratt (as Kat's friend, Mandela), and Heath Ledger *really* sold the gradual fall into affection.  Andrew Keegan, as Joey, just *exuded* slime, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt was, well, adorable.
I liked it *so* much I had to make my husband watch it the next day.  Yes, my reputation as a 'heinous 'b****' is shattered, but I don't care anymore - even on a second watching, I laughed until I cried.  And my husband, also a hard-bitten cynic...  Well, I think it's safe to say he liked it, too.
Even at PG-13, it's a *little* more than I might let my kids (ages 13, 11, and 9) watch - I'm *really* uncomfortable with my kids reading the screenshots of Ms. Perky's novel, but otherwise, no problems.  Doesn't glorify drinking - Kat gets nasty sick at, and possibly on, Patrick's feet; doesn't glorify smoking - Kat very clearly shows her contempt for Patrick's smoking and he quits for her; doesn't glorify teen sex - Joey, the only one who's clearly in it for the possible sex, is so obviously a slimeball that you can't possibly think anything good can come of Bianca dating him, and Kat clearly regrets her one experience with him...
Look, apparently stereotypical teens, actually thinking!  Who knew?  The one thing (aside from the novel Ms. Perky was working on) that I could have lived without is the Dawson's Creek reference - that's going to date this movie so fast!  Everything else in this movie will still be funny ten years from now, but who'll get the joke about 'those Dawson's river kids'...

I'm not sure what exactly it is... Maybe it's the very graphical (and funny) Dr. Stratford - the girls' dad... Maybe it's the whole Shakesperean look and ""feel"" of the whole feature... Perhaps it's the character of Kat, which I adored... Or maybe it's the liberal policy of the Padua High School, which did remind me a bit of the High School I went to (here in Greece), but also of something I never had...
Whatever it is, I can't pin it down. However, watching this movie as a whole (...again and again), makes me sure of the 5 out of 5 I give it.

1054430,2,6305537798,"10 Things I Hate About You claims to be based on Shakespeare's bawdy, politically incorrect play, The Taming of the Shrew. In truth, the movie uses only fragments of the Bard's tale about a man-hating young woman who is ""tamed"" by a man who is at least is mad as she is. It is a difficult work for modern audiences, because 400 years has seen drastic changes in the battle of the sexes. The film's creators failed to revise the material satisfactorily. There are elements of it which make it watchable, but it turns out to be a fairly typical romantic comedy aimed at teens.
Bianca Stratford [Larisa Oleynik] has never had a date. She's pretty and smart in a kind of valley girl way, but her Dad refuses to let her go out with a boy unless her older sister, Katrina [Julia Styles], starts dating. Katrina hates boys, and Bianca's social future looks dim. [This plot device is an example of the weakness of the story's update. In the Shakespeare version, the younger sister could not marry until her shrewish sister did. This was a custom of the time. Bianca's father comes off as a fruitcake.] Enter Cameron [Joseph Gordon-Levitt], the new boy at Padua High in Seattle. It's love at first sight when he meets Bianca. One of his friends convinces the campus hunk, who also has the hots for Bianca, to pay the school rebel, Patrick [Heath Ledger] to con Katrina into going out with him. This will free Bianca. Naturally, the idea falls apart, and the characters encounter a series of comic mishaps.
There are some bright spots. The story lights up when Julia Styles and Heath Ledger are onscreen. Unlike the other performers, most of whom came from television, these two have worked in live theater since they were kids. He was trained in Australia, she in New York. They are obviously familiar with the original play. In addition, they have an obvious chemistry.
The school's guidance counselor, who spends most of her time writing a bad erotic novel, is hilarious. A black English teacher with attitude reads Shakespeare's sonnets with a rap rhythm. They actual sound pretty good. His bad attitude may be caused by the school's being about 98% white.
Seattle and Tacoma, the two cities the movie was shot in, provide lush backdrops. The songs chosen for the movie are weak for the most part. It is hard to imagine this hip high school crowd being eager to jump and dance to these tunes. Out takes are shown during the end credits. These are interesting because they imply that 10 Things I Hate About You should have been far more energetic and offbeat.",1016668800,,2552,4.660753880266076

1054479,4,6305537798,"Although a step-up from the usual mediocre teen flick genre, '10 Things' doesn't *quite* escape that label altogether. The script is very witty, even to the point of being really good, but the developement of its characters is sadly lacking. Heath Ledger's character, Patrick Verona (the male lead), goes too easily from ""tough and scary"" to ""sweet and sensitive"", without anything to make us believe it. Since the dialogue shows no evidence of his being in love with Kat (Julia Stiles) until he comes out and says it, it's rather hard to believe. Juliat Stiles character has a similiar problem, going from ""grumpy loner"" to ""happy teen"" in hardly a blink. Of course, one hardly notices due to these young actors supurb preformances.
The co-stars steal the show, however. The bumbling new kid who falls for the sweet and popular, if a little shallow, Bianca (Kat's sister) is so likable I wish the story focused on him and all his troubles, and his quirky new friend has some great lines. Allison Janey is wonderful and often provides great comic relief among some flat jokes.

1054480,1,6305537798,"Seven things I hated about 10 Things I Hate About You:
1. The movie's gimmick is that Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is barred by her hermetic father Walter (Larry Miller in yet another thankless role) from going on a date until Bianca's sister Katarina (Julia Stiles) decides to ever date a man. That seems pretty unlikely, given that Katarina is a male-hating, insult-spouting bundle of neurosis. Somebody involved in the movie thinks this is an original character, but I saw About Last Night... (1986), in which Elizabeth Perkins played the same sort of self- and man-hating hag. We're meant to feel sorry for this kind of character because she's been so hurt that she lashes out at the world in spite. Personally, I feel that this sort of character gets what she deserves.
2. The movie thinks it's clever just by doing hip updates of William Shakespeare's comedy The Taming of the Shrew. What a pity that this movie is readily available on video, and episodes of the 1980's TV series ""Moonlighting"" are not. ""Moonlighting"" did a killer take on Shrew that had more laughs in the opening credits than are in this entire movie.
3. Updating Shakespeare to modern-day high school is a nice concept, but the movie's script never develops the concept any further. Instead, it does a lot of dumb sitcom-like jokes to curry favor with the teenaged viewers most likely to rent this movie. In fact, I'd be amazed to see any high school in America that is run like the one in the movie. The teachers regularly curse out the students and get no reprisals for it. Sure!!
4. Allison Janney (later to do far better in TV's ""The West Wing"") here plays a horny guidance counselor who spends most of her job-time writing a dirty novel on her laptop.
5. The Walter character is a beaut. Two daughters, and he barely lets either of them experience the real world. When one of the girls actually is allowed to go out, Walter insists she wear a ""pregnancy suit"" to remind herself of the dangers of sex. And that leads to...
6. There isn't an event that isn't motivated by anything other than the urge to get a cheap, sitcom-type laugh. The guy (Heath Ledger) who eventually woos and wins Katarina can't just sing a song to Katarina--he persuades the high school band to back him up. Never mind that most high school bands need weeks of practice just to do a simple half-time-show number. And when Katarina wants to divert a teacher's attention in order to get her guy out of trouble, she flashes her breasts at the teacher in front of an entire class. Don't tell me that either Katarina's action or the teacher's reaction wouldn't send the local school board into apoplexy.
7. Two women, Karen McCullough Lutz and Kirsten Smith, are credited as the screenwriters for this tripe, proving that females in Hollywood can sell out as easily as males do.
One thing I do like about this movie is the climactic scene where Bianca and her boyfriend are challenged by the local macho student, and it looks like the typical ""two guys fighting for the girl's honor"" scene. Instead, Bianca takes matters into her own hands and decks Mr. Macho. In a movie with a supposedly feminist slant, this is the only scene that smacks of modern-day reality.

Trying to keep his daughters from dating for fear they may get pregnant, their paranoid father (Larry Miller) makes a family rule where Bianca cannot date until Kat does, which seems impossible. New kid Cameron (Joseph Gordon Levitt) has a huge crush on Bianca and, thinking Bianca likes him in return and wants to date him, he and his friend Michael Eckman (David Khumoltz) devises a scheme where they try to pair Kat off with the school ""Bad Boy"" Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger).
By reading the basic plot above, you probably think this is just another Teen Flick? Well, though technically a teen flick, it lacks the shallowness that other movies of this genre have.

When this film came out I missed it because at the time I hated any sort of 'teen' films and after I did 'Taming of the Shrew' for A'Level's I thought well ok I'll see it. Expecting another 'She's All That' (which I didn't like at all)
I was really suprised! It does start worryingly at first because it doesn't seem to have a direction but once the actual plot gets under way it soon picks up. Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger steal the show as the feminist, cynical man-hater and the bad-boy with a wicked reputation, respectively.

Being a teen myself, I can say that it's probably because most adults don't think and act the way we do...which means they have different tastes in everything - including movies! But just because you see a movie and it looks as though it's gonna be labeled as a ""teen flick"", doesn't mean that it's actually a bad film; it might actually (believe it or not) be awesome! And that's what 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU is. I have to admit though that I do intend to enjoy many of the teen flicks that are out there these days such as SHE'S ALL THAT, DROP DEAD GOREGOUS, BRING IT ON, RUSHMORE, DRIVE ME CRAZY, the SCREAM series, the I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER series, IDLE HANDS, CRUEL INTENTIONS, THE FACULTY, and many others not listed here. But hey, what can you expect from a 17-year-old American girl? (It's not surprising that I love most of the cute guys that are in these movies, too!) But trust me, 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU is an excellent teen flick with an excellent casting assemble, starring some of today's hottest young ""teen flick"" actors such as Julia Stiles, Joseph-Gorden Levitt, and Heath Ledger, along with many others. This movie is based on a modernized version of one of William Shakespeare's plays (I forget which one). It takes place at a high school in Seattle, Washington. The movie is about this new kid who comes to the school, Cameron (Joseph-Gorden Levitt), and who tries to win over a girl named Bianca who is of course very beautiful and perfect. The only problem is, is that Bianca's not allowed to date (ordered by her strict father) until her older rebellion sister, Kat (Julia Stiles), does! When Cameron finds this out, he pays a cool, snobish model-jock, Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan), to find someone who Kat will go out with. If Joey does this for Cameron, then Cameron promised him Joey will get to date Bianca (whom Joey is also in love with). Hearing this, Joey goes off and finally discovers the dark, mysterious Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) who seems to be the perfect match for Kat, since they have so much in common. Joey then pays Patrick to take her on a date, and Patrick and Kat end up falling in love and even go to the prom together. This is great for Cameron because Cameron was able to ask Bianca out and they end up going to Kat and Patrick's Prom. Kat and Patrick also end up going to the Prom and everything seems perfect until Joey (who is furious at Cameron for ""stealing his girl"") shouts out during the Prom that he paid Patrick to go out with Kat so he could go out with Bianca! Then Kat gets mad at Patrick for thinking that he lied to her and leaves! (I don't want to spoil the entire movie so I won't say what happens at the end.) And now that Patrick has fallen in love with Kat, he must find a way to win her back.

Heath Ledger, a personal favorite of mine, is funny as the 'bad boy' Patrick Verona, a part which Ledger makes the best of, dispite it's limited range and convenient and unexplained transformation in to a 'good boy' about halfway through.

NOTE:  I love that Julie Stiles, Heath Ledger(RIP), and Joseph Gordon-Levitt all went on to have pretty stellar careers.  I hated the ABC Family series though, it ruined all of characters and totally changed the story, I am so glad it tanked, it was more than awful, it was an embarrassing mess that destroyed the characters and totally obliterated the original message of the film with ridiculous hyper PC nonsense.

ORIGINAL UPDATED REVIEW  when I was 16yrs on February 1, 2001:

Some people probably won't want to watch this because its a romantic teen comedy, but ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is different and a step above most teen flicks (New Comment 12/6/17:  At the time this was released it was underrated, but it along with the inferior ""She's All That"" revived the Teen Movie Genre, which produced some good and some bad movies, but it was a fun time.) .  The cast include the at the time, relatively unknown actors: Allison Janney,Julia Stiles,Heath Ledger, Joseph Gorden Levitt, Larissa Oleynik,and Andrew Keegan, many of which who went on to further stardom. Together they create this funny and ridiculous yet realistic movie.

This is basically an updated version of ""Taming of the Shrew"".  We have the shrew Kat who alienates all men with her bad attitude and her sister Bianca whom is the complete opposite: vapid, shallow, and popular.  What makes this movie better than ""She's All That""  and update of ""Pygmalion"" is the acting is much better, the script is better, and the character changes are actually believable here.  The humor is juvenile at times, but appropriately so, from the snarky and romance novelist Guidance Counselor to the soccer teacher/detention teacher.  Not to mention Andrew Keegan's often over-the-top performance as an aspiring model.  It all works together very well, and never feels insincere in its execution, and was a refreshing change from the perfunctory teen films that proceeded and followed in it's wake.

This movie will be the cast's high point. Julia Stiles messed up with Down to You and Heath Ledger put a wrong foot with The Patriot. But, at least we can look back in a couple of years time and remember there delicious on-screen presence. The script is imaginative and laugh-out-loud funny, and there is alot of touching, romantic parts of this film which actually give it a subtle side, providing the audience with alot of chuckles as well as tissues. In short, this wee gem has more than 10 things to love about it, and less than 5 to hate.
Although flawed, 10 Things I Hate About You remains extremely recommendable teen fun which all interested film-goers should rent on a Friday night.

1054588,4,6305537798,"Well first let me say this: As a movie-loving Teen I actually don't like teen movies a lot because often they don't seem real and 30 year old actors playing teens is just ridiculous. 10 things however surprised me very much cuz it really felt believable to me and it was one of the first romantic movies I actually thought was romantic. 10 things renewed my faith..
THE STORY... is losely based on William Shakespear's Taiming of the shrew. Julia Stiles is Kat, the girl who doesn't want to date... but her sister Bianca wants to. So here's the problem: Their father came up with this rule: ""Bianca doesn't date... until Kat does"" The shy new guy Cameron falls for Bianca the day he arrives. Now he has to find a date for Kat to get to her. Heath Ledger's character gets paid to ask Kat out but the inevidable happens... he falls in love with the shrew...
THE CAST.. is young and fresh. I've seen Julia Stiles for the first time since The Devil's own and was totally amazed by her. Heath Ledger is the perfect man for her and those two together seem so real. There's real chemistry there. His ""I love you, baby"" performance is one of the highlights of the entire movie (along with Julia Stiles' dancing performance)
THE DIRECTION... is pretty conventional but that doesn't matter because this is not a visual movie. It's about the characters and their relations so I guess it is best that it is kept very simple. There are some pretty cute songs in the movie which want to make you to buy the soundtrack. There's almost no score but the source music is pretty amazing...
THE DVD: Shame on Touchstone! The DVD comes with less than none Special features and sound and picture quality are mediocre.. This movie would have deserved a little more treatment for DVD adaption. SO... I'm a guy and I really loved the movie although it is a ""chick flick"". But, hey we can get emotional, too...",981072000,2,1884,4.511695906432749

1054594,4,6305537798,"The Shakespeare revival continues unabated, as the Stratford-based writer proves to be more in demand than ever. One of the results of sparky, entertaining films such as this reminder that Shakespeare is a writer for all ages, not just some literary legend who speaks only to the time in which he lived and is therefore fit for a privileged few, as well s the odd GCSE taker.
Far from it, 10 Things I Hate About You - based on The Taming of the Shrew - has the wide appeal to be a big succes and the quirkiness to prove a cultish hit too. Wisely skirting the less politically correct issues within this mighty clash of the sexes tale, writers Lutz and Smith have made a John Hughes-esque high school romantic comedy that provokes as much thought as it does laughs.
Beautiful yet aloof Katarina Stratford (Julia Stiles) is given a wide berth at Padua High School, where she is feared for her feisty manner and biting wit. Her younger sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is much more popular, especially with new boy Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is desperate for a date with her. But this is far from easy as their horribly nervous father insists that if they are to date, they must date together, safe in the knowledge that Kat would never find a man who could live with her exacting standards. So Cameron and his new pal Michael (David Krumholtz) set about to finding such a man. The lucky guy they select is the brooding Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) who no-nonsense tough guy image would seem the ideal foil for Kat.
And the start of the fun when things don't go quite as well as planned. Laughs come effortlessly out of the characters and their plight, as all play out a drama that has a basis in reality, that is recognisably an adaption of the Schrew, but which is a fun film all on its own. Above all, Stiles and Ledger make a winning couple against a roster of entertaining supporting characters, as the film proves itself stylish, uplifting and thoroughly winning.",973296000,3,1973,4.592067988668555
1054595,4,6305537798,"10 Things I Hate About You is a fairly basic teen love story, but with the added twist of Shakespeare and some good comedic acting.
The story is based on Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. It is about two sisters, one very popular, Bianca Stratford (played by Larisa Oleynik) and the other, Katrina, or ""Kat"" (played by Julia Stiles) hated because of her gruff character. Their overbearing father (played by the hilarious Larry Miller), devises a scheme whereby Bianca cannot date until rebellious Katrina does, which seems an impossibility. Thereby is set up a scheme to pair Katrina off with the roguish Patrick Verona. One of the masterminds of this plot is Cameron James (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a newcomer to Padua high, where the movie takes place. The other is his assistant of sorts, Michael Eckman (played by David Khumoltz).
Though somewhat predictable, especially if you have read Taming of the Shrew, it is an interesting light diversion. The dialogue is quite well done, intertwining a word or phrase from Shakespeare with modern teen slang. Other odes to Shakespeare are seen in Kat's friend who idolizes him as if he is a teen heartthrob, plus reading of his works in one Kat's classes. The timing in the dialogue is also very Shakespearean (for a comedy). It's Very rapid fire. I think both David Khumoltz and Larry Miller are amazingly funny!
Overall, this is not your typical shallow teen romance movie, but can appeal to anyone who enjoys witty dialogue, and many literary references.
The DVD is unremarkable. It has a good DD 5.1 soundtrack driven by a nice selection of alternative rock - Letters from Clio had several cameos, but I believe they mainly played cover tunes, not their own stuff. The DVD does not contain any special features.",971222400,88,1770,4.903333333333333
1054596,4,6305537798,"Like many of the other people here, I avoided this film like the plague because of the way it was pitched:  directly at the teen market, between the ""slasher"" bores of I Know What You Did Last Summer and the ""romantic comedies"" featuring She's All That.  Plus, I have a general rule:  if the majority of my classmates like the movie, I refuse to see it.  This would be why I haven't enjoyed the likes of the Scream trilogy or Varsity Blues and American Pie.
However, upon much insistance of my English class, I finally broke down and watched it (plus, we were doing the original Taming of the Shrew).  To my surprise, this is a very smart and well crafted film.  The main ensemble cast (Heath Ledger, Larisa Oleynik, Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon-Levitt) did a wonderful job, but what really made it especially endearing were the ""minor"" characters.  Mandella and Michael, the friends who find love over Macbeth; Andrew Keegan as Joey Donner, the guy everyone loves to hate and/or kiss up to; Alison Janney (from the West Wing) as the horny guidance counselor; Bogey Lowenson, the unassuming future MBA.  The person that stood out in my mind the most, though, was the English teacher.  He was the funniest person in the entire film.  The interaction between Mr. Morgan and Kat was quick, witty, and even a little double-edged.
I would recommend this film to almost anyone, even those wary of the teen genre that's flooded the market with truly horrible flicks.  It probably takes someone with a penchant for Shakespeare--or feminist literature--to truly understand the wit of the lines.",971049600,2,1584,4.808118081180812

The  high school is like no high school I've ever seen, and the plot has holes  you could drive a mac truck through.  So why has it taken up permanent  residence in my DVD player?
First, the main players have some sparkle and  bite to them.  Heath Ledger makes a great rebel type, and Julia Stiles  plays a heroine with attitude to spare.  A great deal of actual acting is  required from her, and she rises to the task.
Secondly, the adults in the  movie are well cast, for a welcome change.  Larry Miller is hilarious as a  paranoid father, and Allison Janney shines as a dirty-minded guidance  counselor.  Both are as good as Eugene Levy's K.O. as the father in  American Pie.
Finally, the script.  The plot's a bore, but the dialog is  sharp and believable.  Julia Stiles' ""shrew"" gets plenty of  zingers, but there's enough for everyone to have one or two.

1054642,4,6305537798,"""10 Things I Hate About You"" is a teensploitation movie. Don't get me wrong, because that's not a bad thing. At least, it doesn't *have*  to be a bad thing. But the reason that most people over the age of 21 groan  when they hear about yet *another* movie about teenagers, is because the  teensploitation fad has given us the recent ""Scary Movie,"" and  less-recent releases like ""American Pie,"" ""She's All  That,"" ""Varsity Blues,"" ""Can't Hardly Wait,"" and  the abysmal ""Drive Me Crazy."" Now, there's nothing wrong with  putting a bunch of attractive twenty-somethings in a plot about the trials  and tribulations of high school. But (and this is my only complaint about  ""10 Things"") could they at least aim for a little more realism?  Whose high school looks like a castle? Who has gone to their senior prom to  find all the attendees dancing in unison? Who's ever had an inappropriate  sexual encounter with an apple pie, and who has ever had a hot exchange  student masturbate on their bed, live on the internet?
Other than the few  instances where the viewer is forced to suspend disbelief (come on, we all  know that Joey Donner is a closet nancy-boy), ""10 Things"" is a  pretty good movie. If it weren't for modernized versions of the Bard, many  of us wouldn't be able to stomach the mandatory studying of ""Romeo and  Juliet,"" ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" ""Macbeth,""  and of course ""The Taming of the Shrew."" By putting the plot and  characters in a setting that most people understand-high school-the  filmmakers have proven that Shakespeare's work is truly timeless, and  definitely worth studying. (I don't mean to insult Shakespeare fans out  there-in fact, I admire you; you're a lot smarter than I am!)
""10  Things"" is funny and has its touching moments-like when Patrick (Heath  Ledger, ""The Patriot's"" adorable Aussie) serenades Kat (Julia  Stiles) in the stadium. When I saw that scene, I thought, ""Who cares  if it's believable? That's so sweet!"" Several notably good scenes  include the party, where the writers say (by way of the students'  acceptance of social outcast Kat only after she performs a drunken  table-dance, something she would never normally do) that ""everyone's  popular when you're drunk."" During the inevitable prom scene, when  Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) fights with Joey (Andrew Keegan, in a  wonderfully snotty performance) to defend the honor of Bianca (Larisa  Oleynik), it shows that likes her for who she is, and not just because  she's pretty.
The movie has good character development and some great  acting, especially by Ledger, David Krumholtz as Cameron's A/V Club pal,  and Allison Janney as a demented guidance counsellor. Don't write it off as  just another teen flick-it's a big fish in a small pond, and it's not only  watchable, it's enjoyable.",965865600,3,2802,4.9697624190064795

In this highly acclaimed 'teen' movie, influenced by the comedy Taming of the Shrew written by William Shakespeare, the routine is still on, but with a new and refreshing twist. With unfamiliar, yet talented new faces, this brand spankin' new cast is entertaining from beginning to end.
 Newcomers Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger light up the screen as the potential couple who incidentally fall for each other. The stratford sisters live under strict rules stated by their strict, humorous father: Bianca, the younger, outgoing sister, cannot date until her older, anti-social sister Kat (with the perfect I-hate-the-world attitude) decides to date. As soon as Bianca attracts two fellow students, their plans on finding Kat a date lead to mishaps here and there. With witty dialogue and great music to go along with it, this movie is worthy of being in the genre of 'teen'.

Unfortunately, the writers--having taken ""The Taming of the Shrew"" as the template for their story--run out of direct parallels to Shakespeare early on, and they can't replace them with anything except the usual, tiresome teen-movie cliches and leaden, disposable dialogue.

Apart from more than a few scenes which inspired more groans  than anything else, some token ridiculous and bit characters, and some  harsh cliches the movie is not altogether terrible. The idea of it being  based on ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" though, is a complete  fallacy. It is as much an adaptation of that piece of Shakespeare as  ""U-571"" was an adaptation of ""Das Boot"" (and at least  both of those had submarines!). But amid the rapping of Shakespeare and  ridiculous attempts at physical comedy (not to mention the blatant blending  of two distinctly separate cities; Stadium High School is NOT in the middle  of Queen Anne, Seattle)there is the occasional surprising scene. For  instance, the initial jabs at teenage social structures are moderately  intelligent as are some of the views espoused by the angry teacher. But  some of the funniest gems from the piece lie in the almost perfect satire  of American high school students and their social structures.
For the  most part, however, the movie does not deviate from the standard teen fare.  For virtually every good bit of the movie there is a corresponding bad  piece. The acting falls somewhere between ""She's All That"" and  ""American Pie"" as does the story line. The characters cannot seem  to actually stay characters but this is a failing on the part of the  screenwriters.

1054672,2,6305537798,"""10 Things I Hate About You,"" a modern updating of ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" demonstrates what happens when filmmakers drain The Bard of his poetry and language and cater to modern moviegoing tastes -  they reduce a classic work to yet another in a long line of lamebrained,  dull teenagers-on-the-make tales featuring a contingent of adolescents who  would never be caught dead reading Shakespeare.
In this version, set in  contemporary Tacoma, Kate and Bianca have been converted into two  squabbling high school sisters, the former a notorious harridan from whom  all peers flee and the latter a virginal beauty whom all the boys covet but  who is laboring under her father's edict that she not be able to date until  her older sister does.
That Shakespeare's plot fails to translate to  modern times goes without saying since the father's obsession lacks the  kind of logic the original author provided. In the original's historical  context, the cultural tradition dictating that the older daughter must  marry before the younger one rings true as a motivation for the story's  narrative underpinnings. Here, since the fathers seems mostly concerned  with the - real or imagined - horrifying consequences of his daughter's  dating, his decision to allow Bianca to date only if Kate does seems  counterintuitive and counterproductive. It seems hardly sensible that his  fears would be allayed by having TWO daughters out on the town with  boyfriends.
All this could be forgiven if the filmmakers had provided a  screenplay with even a smidgen of cleverness and humor. In fact, the first  ten minutes hint at a reasonably astute satire of modern high school life,  particularly in the character of a sex-obsessed female counselor who  provides the only moments of amusement in the entire film. Since she us  dropped almost immediately from the action, all we are left with is the  spectacle of a group of shallow teenagers laboriously executing the  mechanics of a once irresistable plot. Kate is nowhere near the terrifying  shrew nor her pursuer the arrogant rogue they need to be to be comically  effective. They come across as only slightly askew, but basically ordinary,  adolescents who lack the charisma to make them even slightly  interesting.
""10 Things"" proves yet again that Shakespeare  without Shakespeare results only in a bareboned plot devoid of wit and  artistry.",964310400,,2384,5.114285714285714

As far as teen  movies go, this one treats the audience as intelligent individuals whether  teens or adults are watching it.  I'm in my 30's and I found this movie and  the characters and actors especially refreshing.  Also, the LACK of vulgar  language and nude scenes is definitely a plus!  Finally someone realizes  that four letter words and sex are not needed for an audience to enjoy a  movie.
Both Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger stand out in this movie.  Their onscreen chemistry is not to be denied.

1054887,4,6305537798,"10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU is a modern update on William Shakespeare's classic comedy THE TAMING OF THE SHREW.  Meaning it's not Kenneth Branagh.  Meaning you don't need an English-Elizabethan dictionary to understand half  the words.  Meaning no fops parading around in tight tights.  Meaning no  royal kerfuffles.  Meaning no ghosts, witches, fairies, or one-legged  Turkish disco dancers.  Meaning no obscure references that only English  teachers get.  Meaning no actors walking around talking to themselves like  they just got released from Shady Acres Happy Home.  Meaning, finally, a  movie geared towards a young audience.  And unlike some modern-day  adaptations of classic plays or movies, this one will actually hold your  attention for more than seventeen seconds.
What makes 10 THINGS I HATE  ABOUT YOU really work is two things.  First of all, it doesn't pander down  to its audience, instead treating it as an equal.  Second, and most  importantly, writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kristen Smith flesh out the  characters and make them seem real.  This couldn't be accomplished without  good actors, and 10 THINGS has plenty of those.  Instead of going with the  huge teen stars of the moment (Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar,  Freddie Prinze Jr, or any other heartthrob with three or more names), the  casting directors chose lesser-known actors who could get by on talent, and  not necessarily name value alone.  They chose wisely.
Stiles makes Kat  into a multifaceted, complex heroine who is both charming and viciously  fierce.  Ledger brings a new dimension to the oft-used ""rebel who's  really a misunderstood poetic soul"" cliche.  The chemistry between  these two is probably the most compelling part of the movie.  When Patrick  serenades Kat with the song ""Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You""  accompanied by the school marching band, it's such a joyous and spontaneous  moment that I guarantee your heart will melt and you'll break into a huge  smile in spite of yourself.  10 cheers for 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU!",952560000,29,2047,5.094224924012158

 ""10 Things"", like the better teen flicks out there, is loosely based on classic stories.  ""Clueless"" is based on Jane Austen's Emna.  ""She's All  That"" is based on (sort of) My Fair Lady/Pygmalion.

 It's not  to say that ""10 Things"" or those other films derive even 1/10th  of the original's inspired creativity.  That's not the point.  The fact is  Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"", like the other stories,  gives at least a base for entertaining characters and great sitcomy  situations.

 And ""10 Things"" works well with that.  It's  not deep.  It's not that clever.  And the direct Shakespeare references are  sorta weak.  But, it has some pretty well-done funny, and sitcom-romantic  moments with contrasting characters and a complete story.  You're always  having a good time with the flick, you'll be totally rooting for the guy,  and ""10 Things"" definitely hits it off with how sisters can be.  How many teen flicks have that nowadays?

 And oh yeah -- the lead  female actress rocks.",946512000,8,1108,4.7287234042553195

Yes, I am a teenager, but I also understand that many adults (including my parents and sisters) have enjoyed it.  Any teenager  that watches this movie can relate to something, which is one reason I  found it so interesting.  I think many viewers find themselves totally  interested in one character and paying attention to that one throughout the  movie, hoping he/she gets what they want.  Also, the acting in this movie  was AWESOME. The casting director needs some kind of award for this,  because the teenagers portray their characters very well.  If you haven't  seen this movie, you must see it.  Maybe some people find it to be a bad  movie, but I think most of you will be very interested in it and want to  watch it again and again.",944352000,10,833,4.496644295302014

1054993,4,6305537798,"This movie appealed to me immensely even though it centers on high school students and I am a 24 year old graduate student in English.  It is a perfect example of the timelessness of Shakespeare because it shows how the  characters he created (in this case, in The Taming of the Shrew) and their  experiences are universal and we can identify with them nearly 400 years  later, whether we are 17, 24, or 50.  As a movie lover and a sucker for  romantic comedies, I am always disappointed in those that have cheesy,  sappy, or unrealistic love confession scenes, but this movie handled them  well and I was thrilled.  The characters and relationships were developed  as well as you can hope for the genre.  I was thoroughly entertained by the  whole movie, the characters, and the soundtrack and, of course, I Loved  Heath Ledger's character, Patrick!",943833600,4,850,4.739726027397261
1054994,3,6305537798,"If someone said to the average 13 year old that a new Shakespeare movie is coming out, and they are going to love it...they would probably respond with a stereotypical ""WHATEVER!"" However, if you give it a catchy name, hire the  cute boy from 3Rd Rock From the Sun, and make a trailer with ultra hip  banter, then you suddenly have a box office hit with the teens. 10 Things I  Hate About You is one of the best from this recent trend.
  A modern adaptation of the Shakespeare  play ""The Taming of the Shrew"", stars  Julia Stiles as Katarina, the shrew that is  mentioned in the title. A virtual  newcomer to  the screen, this lady  has something that  most ""teen stars""  (minus of course Leelee  Sobeski)  lacks...the ability to act. Her turn  as Kat is actually very refreshing, and as  someone who loves `Shrew"" this is one of  the best people I have seen to play this  role. (Shakespeare purists, please hold off  your hate mails.)
  The story revolves around Kat and her sister  Bianca (Larisa Oleynik). Bianca is beautiful,  the popular girl at school, who would have  everything she wants if it weren't for one  little dilemma. There is a family rule  that prohibits her from dating until unpopular, and borderline scary Kat,  gets a man of her own. So, an admirer of Bianca's hires someone to win  Kat's heart, so that he can take out Bianca.
I am sure you are thinking  that isn't anything original here...and you are right there isn't. However,  it's tempo, and nonchalant references and odes to Shakespeare is what keeps  it going and makes it fresh.
I recommend this film to anyone who is  looking for a little harmless fun.",943833600,15,1636,4.569444444444445

One is very into her looks and wants  everyone to love her.  The other sister could care less about people liking  her or about the way she looks.  This movie is about the sisters  relationships with others and how similar they actually are.

1054998,2,6305537798,"I'm going to disagree with all the 13 year old swooners that reviewed this film.  This was without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever laid eyes on, it's lone redeeming qualities were Larry Miller (Kat and Bianca's  father, who is pretty much hilarious in everything he does) and Joseph  Gordon Levitt.  Every character in this film was one dimensional and there  was no developement at all.  Kat was the WOMAN POWER! male hater (She would  have made a good pro choicer in Stephen King's ""Insomnia"", but  that's another story).  Bianca was the bubble headed ditz, Joey was the  chisled Italian jock whose range of emotions went from arrogant...to  arrogant...to arrogant...to arrogant...to, well you get the idea.  I  suppose the rough australian punk (whose name I've completely forgotten)  was a decent character in his own right as well.  But Gordon Levitt's audio  visual friend is the stereotypical geek who ends up getting a girl by the  grace of God on high at the film's climax.  To even put ""The Taming of  the Shrew"" in the same sentence with this movie would be a grave  injustice.  The only reason I gave it two stars is Miller, Levitt, and the  out takes at the end.  Those were pretty hilarious.",941932800,3,1215,4.708133971291866
