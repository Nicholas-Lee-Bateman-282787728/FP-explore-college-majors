353815,5,6301777840,"If you are looking for a movie about the south in the Civil War era, buy this movie.  You won't be sorry.  The acting and the story line is one of the best by far.  It is not as good as Gone With The Wind, but it comes very close.  It is a very touching story and really gives insight to how people in that era had to live to servive.  I have watched this movie several times and enjoy it every time as if it was the first.",1060992000,4,423,3.707865168539326
353816,5,6301777840,"I believe this was a great movie, it was no near  Gone with the Wind , but in a totally different live. It shows thestoory of the old south from a very different perspective.

353817,3,6301777840,"This movie was not what I expected, I really did not like any of the characters in it and it is obvious it was never a blockbuster movie.  It was certainly no Gone With the Wind, not even close.  I was anxious to see it and enjoyed it enough to watch the whole thing however, I would not recommend it as the movie to see.  I will never watch it again.  It was not moving, exciting nor interesting to listen to.  I will keep it in my collection in the event someone else wants to see it when they have nothing better to do.",992908800,3,522,3.980769230769231

353934,4,6301777840,"RELEASED IN 1980 and DIRECTED BY Harry Falk & Virgil W. Vogel, Beulah Land focuses on the titular Georgia plantation in Antebellum South, starting in 1827 and proceeding well past the Civil War.

MAIN CAST: Lesley Ann Warren stars as the emerging matriarch, Sarah, who basically takes over the plantation after marrying the likable, but feeble Leon (Paul Rudd). Meredith Baxter is on hand as Sarahs drama mama sister while Michael Sarrazin surfaces as Sarahs knight in shining armor from the North. Eddie Albert & Hope Lange play the elders of Beulah Land. Dorian Harewood, Franklyn Seales, Grand L. Bush & Jean Foster have important black roles. Paul Shenar plays a literal slave-driver with Jenny Agutter as his babe of dubious morality. Don Johnson appears in the first act as a rash young buck from a neighboring plantation and Madeline Stowe his maybe (or maybe not) wife. Ilene Graff, Laurie Prange, Jonathan Frakes & Patrick Harrison all have secondary key roles.

COMMENTARY: Novelist Lonnie Coleman obviously used Margaret Mitchells Gone with the Wind for inspiration for her first two Beulah Land books (1973 and 1977) from which this three-part miniseries was based.  While it lacks the production values of the iconic Gone with the Wind (1939), Beulah Land is a generally more accurate depiction of the Plantation Era in the Deep South. For one thing, it was actually shot in the Deep South, at a plantation in Natchez, Mississippi, whereas the outside sequences in Gone with the Wind"" were all obviously shot in friggin California (not counting establishing shots).

The beginning is weak with all the principles as children (provoking me to tune out the first time I tried to watch it), but after the first half hour youll find yourself embroiled in the melodrama of plantation life. You can tell John Jakes North and South trilogy took a lot from Beulah Land, but the latter came first. There are a few shocking moments and thrilling sequences, particularly when the Yankees invade, but this is a melodrama of the Plantation Era with the expected virtues, sins and gray areas thereof. Needless to say, Beulah Land is a great companion piece to The Blue and the Gray (1980) and North and South (1985/1986/1994).

The three parts run 281 minutes (19 minutes shy of 5 hours). The screenplay was written by Jacques Meunier from Colemans books.

IMPORTANT NOTE ON THE DVDS: PART II is featured on Disc 1 immediately following PART I. You have to wait for the ending credits of PART I and then it automatically goes into PART II without selecting anything. The disc makers should have indicated this on the Main Menu, but they didn't, which can confuse some viewers and make them think that the 2-Disc set doesn't include PART II.

We immediately realized that people were missing and there were characters in this that were not in the first DVD.  The WHOLE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE WAS MISSING.  THE MOVIE SUDDENLY MADE NO SENSE.

354282,5,6301777840,"This was a mini-series in the early '80s. Vaguely like Gone with the Wind with a different family and longer stretching time period. Was controversial at the time is was shot because it included more about the interactivity and friendships between some of the slaves and the owner family. Includes the evacuation of Atlanta, the ""triage at the Atlanta train yard"".  Shot in authentic period plantation homes. Did fairly well with period accuracy in look and feel. Shot in Natchez, Mississippi.  Enjoyable trip through the time period.

Eddie Arnold, Hope Lang, Don Johnson (early in his career), Michael Sarrazin, Paul Rudd (before he became a full time prof), Dorian Harewood,  Meredith Baxter Birney, Martha Scott, Jonathan Frakes, Bibi Osterwald,Madeleine Stowe (early in her career).
Includes appearance by the Delta Queen, which people are still trying to save and preserve.  A good many authentic civil war uniforms were lost during production due to extra's being sent to lunch in thunderstroms and the old thread giving out on the seams from the weight of the wet wool AND then being packed and sent back to rental company without being dried out.",1426550400,4,1155,5.08994708994709

Part of the fascination is how the movie doesn't show the civil war battlefield violence, or the physical brutality of slavery except through its effects on the black and white characters who are destroyed in their own personal lives as mothers, wives, lovers, daughters, fathers, husbands.  I liked the way the south becomes a presence of something dying. Its a haunting movie . There is only one happy ending, which is more a hope than a possibility. Good acting from the known and unknown actors. I've never heard better dialogue from people whose  fate dangles by a string. This film doesn't show its age.

War takes us through a soap-opera like miniseries, with social issues, war, love, death, and beautiful scenery with beatiful clothes and beautiful people.  Audiences will love Sarah, the main character, and emphasize with her problems and triumphs as she becomes new mistress of Bealah Land, the plantation that sees lavish pre-war parties with dancing and fire as the Yankees burn it.  Surviving the fire is a beautiful painting of Sarah done before the war by a Yankee painter, with whom she has an illicit affair.  Her husband has an out of wedlock affair with Sarah's sister and fathers a baby girl who Sarah brings up as her own.  The saga continues as trouble erupts at Beaulah Land when Leon, Sarah's husband, shoots the overseer and himself.  The Civil War comes, and Sarah's niece's husband goes off to war.  The story traces Sarah's trials and tribulations as she is widowed.  But when the Yankee portrait painter comes back after the war, she must decide whether or not to take him in.

354907,5,6301777840,"This is what I especially love about DVDS, the chance to see something that will likely never play on a television channel again.  1980's BEULAH LAND was a three-part mini series running just over four and a half hours.  It's not perfect but it is highly entertaining and very well-acted.  The program spans a period of over 30 years, from decades before the Civil War to the War to it's aftermath.  BEULAH LAND stars Lesley Ann Warren who marries her childhood crush and eventually becomes mistress (the nice kind!) of his vast plantation estate, Beulah Land, battling evil overseer Paul Shenar, Yankees, financial hardships, hunger, and her feelings for artist Michael Sarrazin, not necessarily in that order. At times BEULAH LAND threatens to become a P.C. GONE WITH THE WIND or a PG MANDINGO (or vice versa) but it's extremely watchable (I planned to watch it over several nights and ended up watching the full movie in a night) and nice bit of nostalgia when these lavish mini series were on the main networks several times a year in the late 1970's and early 1980's.  One thing I found a bit irritating was the continous jumps in years in the storyline as well as several main characters dying outside of the story, having just read some Amazon reviews of the book it appears the movie is only following what the book outlined.

Lesley Ann Warren is very appealing as the noble heroine Sarah,  Meredith Baxter is fun as her fairly trampy sister. Paul Rudd (not the current film star of the same name) is appropiately bland as Sarah's husband Leon and Hope Lange shines in a too brief role as his imposing mother.  Paul Shenar may give the best performance as the rather dashing example of pure evil but equally fine work is done by Dorian Harewood in the complex role of Floyd, a slave of dignity and intelligence who yearns to be a free man but remains on at Beulah Land.  Clarice Taylor as Floyd's mother Lovey also gives a superb performance.  Jenny Agutter is pretty good as the whore who becomes Shenar's bride although the British actress curiously speaks with an Australian accent at times instead of a Southern one.

Some of the more fascinating threads in the storyline of BEULAH LAND are somewhat under the surface: Leon and Floyd's relationship from best friends in childhood to it's ultimate strain as they grow into master and slave, Floyd's discreet unrequited love for Sarah, and a strong suggestion of at least a latent lesbian relationship between Leon's sister and her devoted black companion.

The current DVD cover shown on Amazon.com for BEULAH LAND seems to suggest the film is a grittier Civil War story like THE BLUE AND THE GREY; the copy I own has a more appropiate cover of Warren and Sarrazin that suggests a old-fashioned romance.  Although the DVD lacks any sort of ""extras"", and doesn't even have closed-captioning, I consider it rather bargain-priced considering it's a two-disc set with 281 minutes of story at it's current price.  BEULAH LAND may not be a classic but it's a solid piece of storytelling and should appeal to those who enjoy this genre of filmmaking.",1230336000,150,3105,4.768656716417911
354908,3,6301777840,"Personally, I was disappointed.  I won't even comment on the fact that the primary actors scarcely age 5 minutes over a period of 25 years.  More important is the fact that the acting is uneven and many of the 'southern' accents syrupy and forced.  I also thought that the  film dragged in many places.  Also, quite unforunately, the story and sets parallel 'Gone with the Wind'.  The setting is even in Georgia and we see virtually the same fires, crippled soldiers and escaping civilians.  There's even an evil ex-overseer trying to buy the stricken plantation.  The problem is that 'Beulah Land' isn't nearly so good.

I gave the film 3 stars, though, based on the complexity the film depicted in the relationship between slaves and slave-holders.  It was a love-hate relationship with probably more love than hate.  There was something like interracial harmony but with an undercurrent of discontent.  Paternalism was rife and when the Yankee artist asks the mistress of the plantation why she won't free her slaves, the woman answers...'but what will become of them?'

Southern culture reckoned that blacks couldn't care for themselves and therefore there was little alternative but to continue a troubled system.  Yes, there was also fear that 'freed' slaves would turn on their previous masters.  Emancipation occurred and the Federal Government, in all too many instances, set itself up as the greatest plantation master of all because, after all... 'What will become of them?'  It is an ironic and fearful thing that racial relations in the U.S.A. have become increasingly strained since the early Civil Rights Era.  There has been true progress in the social and economic status of blacks but...in my humble opinion...either despite of because of this progress interracial relationships are worse now than at any time in the past.

It should be noted that if you are a Civil War (battles) buff, there aren't many here, it is a story of a family of the Old South and how they cope.  I think the character portrayals are all great.

354969,5,6301777840,"I've read Lonny Coleman's BEULAH LAND series of three books three times.  The first time in high schoo., again as a young adult, and for the third time just last week.  I saw the movie when it came out as a mini series a long time ago.  Today I finished the movie again.  I found the movie follows the books closer than most movies do.

True, it's no GONE WITH THE WIND, it's better.  I can relate better to Sarah Kindrick than I can to Scarlett O'Hara.  BEULAH LAND is a heartwarming saga that I recommend to anyone interested in a saga about the old south and Civil War.",1212019200,10,572,4.192660550458716

354971,5,6301777840,"I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a different, true look at the War Between the States era. Being a movie buff of this nature of movies, this is the only movie I know of that shows the cruelty of The North, as well as who started slavery and other facts. All the actors did a great job. Be ready for a good intense, romantic, blast of reality.",1171756800,71,365,4.154929577464789

354975,5,6301777840,"Persons who collect good Civil War fiction will love this one.

See a younger Don Johnson here in a major role too for the fans of DJ.

Similiar to the old favorites GONE WITH THE WIND...NORTH & SOUTH...THE BLUE AND THE GRAY.  If you enjoyed or own any of those DVD's you won't want to miss adding this mini series to your collection of fine, fictional Civil War drama.

I have long awaited this to come out on DVD.  I have tired of and no longer use VHS tapes on my large screen DVD.  I cannot tell you just yet about the screen quality of the DVD as mine has not yet arrived at this writing.

The story line is great and the actors all have done a fine job in this story and best of all, the price is great for a great movie.",1122249600,80,727,3.972413793103448

Well-acted by established stars Lesley Ann Warren, Michael Sarrazin, Don Johnson, Meredith Baxter, Dorian Harewood, et all. Plus a few up and coming players of that time such Jonathan Frakes and Madeleine Stowe. If you like sweeping civil war epics, check this one out!",1100908800,4,345,4.9655172413793105
