1646084,5,B00005QAQD,"In this movie we have a few stereotypes, the gay guy and his best friend who is a woman, the gay guy afraid of commitment but also some new moves and enough jokes to give you laughs all the way through.  this was definetly a fun movie.  Set up on a blind date by two friends ""A guy and girl who have the hots for each other and need an excuse to keep in contact"" two guys, meet, have a disasterous first date and then keep bumping into each other.  The guys are attractive but not unrealistic and the female friend is nice and funny but not the weird outrageous type getting so much overplay ""e.g. Grace on Will and Grace"" Fun side story with the straight couple, as when the guy uses the word butter cup to describe the color of a chair and suddenly has to convince the woman that he is in fact straight.  A nice straightforward film that you can watch with friends, a boyfriend or just by yourself.",1005609600,5,900,4.184971098265896
1646085,5,B00005QAQD,"During my summer at USC for screenwriting, I was invited to a special pre-screening of this movie because the director is a USC graduate. I generally don't like romantic comedies, but this movie was heartfelt with drama, and genuinely very funny. The controversy is the main focus on a homosexual couple, as opposed to the traditional heterosexual comedy. But, make no mistake, this movie is not aimed at gays, so even though homophobes will likely be turned off by this movie, as long as you're good-natured (meaning you don't hold prejudice- just to clarify, prejudice is bad!), you won't at all feel alienated by the homosexual relationship. The beauty of the movie is that the characters are so wonderfully crafted that it doesn't matter what their sexual preference, everyone can relate to them and their struggles. The movie is light and fun in one respect, but also sincere enough with feeling that it can be quite moving. The director, Julie Davis, attended the screening and responded to our audience questions, at the end of the film, which was an exquisite experience in itself. Lisa Kudrow and Christina Ricci have minor roles in the movie, and the writer/director of the excellent Opposite of Sex and decent Bounce, was executive producer of All Over The Guy. It's a shame the movie will not get wide release, due to the groundbreaking portrayal of homosexual life, but I definitely recommend the movie if you can get past all that.",1004832000,,1445,4.90204081632653

1646303,3,B00005QAQD,"This movie is okay - more good than bad - but it has a couple of huge flaws.

First, the attraction between Eli (Dan Bucatinsky) and Tom (Richard Ruccolo) is completely unbelievable. There's obviously no real chemistry between the two actors (since Ruccolo is straight), and they're not talented enough to conjure it up out of acting skill alone. Since that relationship is the heart of the movie, its total lack of believable passion is a very serious flaw. Better casting of either (especially Tom) or both roles could have solved it. (Ruccolo looks too much like Rene Zellweger to be sexy anyway, and his shaved chest is a big turn-off.)

Second, when Tom, the self-proclaimed martini expert, makes one for Eli, he uses vodka. Now, I know there are idiots in the world who actually do make a drink with vodka which they call a martini, but that doesn't make it a martini. A martini is made with gin, not vodka. Using vodka to make a ""martini"" is like using Crisco to make ""butter"" cookies: you can call the result butter cookies, but that doesn't make them butter cookies.

What this movie has going for it are a mostly entertaining and intelligent screenplay (only occasionally irritating and stupid - like the Gone with the Wind bit on the first date, and a few similar times when an only marginally entertaining joke is dragged out way too long; Tom blowing vermouth fumes into the ""martini"" is another clunker); a dynamite comic performance by snarky Adam Goldberg just being snarky Adam Goldberg; a solid performance by Sasha Alexander as the female glue that holds the three male flakes together; and a good enough performance by Bucatinsky to make Eli believable as a person if not as a lover - but even that is more Ruccolo's fault than his. Brief cameos by Doris Roberts and Lisa Kudrow are bonus treats.",1384473600,2,1816,4.70440251572327
1646304,4,B00005QAQD,"I think this is a fun plot, the actors are great - I love how the movie shows that gay & straight relationships are quite similar, I love how there are straight sidekicks! I think Dan Buckatinsky is fantastic. He's hilarious, but also great at the deeper things too.

I see a lot of people singing the praises of Richard Ruccolo. He did a fine job bordering on ineffective, in my opinion. I find that a lot of the emotional points of the story threaten to not land because Ruccolo doesn't convey much emotion past cockiness or anger. If it weren't for the end line, I'd've never really known how he felt the whole way through. But we get enough from the other actors that you get the picture, and it ends up quite lovely.

1646305,5,B00005QAQD,I think most gay men have been Eric and Paul at some point. So the story is well scripted and one that most of us can relate to in a personal way.

And I have seen sooo many gay films about an up and coming gay character coming to terms with his sexuality. Once he finds his identity, then what!? That is where ""All Over the Guy"" picks up. This is a story that is good and funny. The writing is good and so is the acting. The actress playing Jackie (Sasha Alexander) really stands out in this movie. She has some of the funniest lines! The film has several cameos from Christina Ricci, Lisa Kudrow and Andrea Martin to name a few.
If you a gay man, you will be able to relate to this little film (because it helps being written by a gay man).

The funny thing is, though, that three of leading characters had also appeared in ""Friends"" serie before:)

Ultimately the movie shows how when people let their guards down and show their true selves, that love will find them.

They are totally unmatchable, Eli the nerd and Tom the jock, but indeed they will discover that, aside from being different on a physical level, they totally match on an heart one. Both of them grown up in a family that is not exactly your perfect ad family, suburban home and 2 kids and a dog, but in a way, they overcame that to become self-conscious gay men. Being gay is absolutely not their problem, find a long-term partner that is another story. This is another point I really like: the relationship between Eli and Tom moves through the different stages, boy meets boy, boy has sex with boy, boy loves boy, without guilty sense or drama or self-punishment.

It's comical, heartbreaking, ironic, and in the end it's got the kind of ending I wish MORE such movies had, ESPECIALLY, ""Brokeback Mountain"", which I wish Ang Lee would have made an alternate - HAPPY - ending for the dvd.

""All Over The Guy"" ends on a high note, like ""Beautiful Thing"" does. Unlike ""Get Real"" and certainly not like ""Brokeback Mountain"". (""Get Real"" and ""Beautiful Thing"" are two others I watch all the time, with ""Get Real"" being my favorite of the two.)

I personally feel, ""All Over The Guy"", is a lot like real life. The moments of exuberation one moment, the crashing down the next, and in spite of the pain and heartache that ""Eli"" and ""Tom"" cause each other, they both feel bad about it moments later, and it's those moments that ultimately bring them together in the end...

1646431,5,B00005QAQD,"In my opinion, there are two films that should be considered staples for anyone's gay movie library...Latter Days is one, All Over the Guy is the other.  I stumbled upon AOTG a couple of years ago while surfing the pay channels...and completely fell in love with it.  This movie is both hilarious and touchingly poignant.  It's a romantic comedy that's neither sappy nor silly; it's hard-hitting, but not in-your-face.  The bottom line is that AOTG is a slick, seamless, well-crafted piece of work that both entertains and conveys a message about contemporary relationships.

In addition to excellent direction, the acting is first-rate.  Everyone who's featured in this film did an outstanding job, but the real kudos have to go to Richard Ruccolo for his flawless and powerful portrayal of Tom.  I've never seen an actor who can say so much with just a facial expression, and the ""Hey!"" scene in the kitchen at the wedding reception is nothing short of goose bump-producing brilliance...he just plain got it right.  I completely agree with the other reviewer on this site who said that Ruccolo is one hell of an actor!  I guarantee you that if Hollywood producers and directors would watch this movie (particularly the aforementioned kitchen scene), we'd see a lot more of Richard on the big screen.  I also agree with the reviewer who said that this film warrants being watched more than once.  Not only does viewing AOTG again enable you to catch subtleties that you might have missed the first time, it also enables you to re-experience the sharp, sophisticated humor and the truly fine acting.  Personally, I've seen this film well over a hundred times and I was as moved by it the last time I saw it as I was the first time.

It doesn't appear that anyone on this site has yet said anything about the background music of AOTG.  I think it's worth mentioning because each and every piece of music fits so perfectly with its respective scene...from the hauntingly beautiful ""If I Could Bring You Back"" to the uplifting and feel-good ""I'm Gonna' Make You Love Me"" at the end.  Whoever chose the music for this film did an incredible job.  And speaking of the ending, I've actually witnessed straight friends getting choked-up by the bottom-of-the-stairs scene at the wedding reception.  That, in my opinion, is one of the most tender, most beautiful scenes ever captured on film.  If I'm feeling down and don't have time to watch the entire movie, I'll pop the DVD into the player and go right to that scene...it improves my outlook every time!

Whether you're gay or straight, this is one movie that's not to be missed.  It's actually become my all-time favorite film...eclipsing even Gone With the Wind.  As I mentioned above, All Over the Guy and Latter Days are two must-see staples for anyone's gay movie library.

1646434,5,B00005QAQD,"This has gotta be one of the most under-rated and ""under-known"" US-made gay movies out there (well, maybe not under-rated since nearly 80% of the reviews here are 4- and 5-Star).  But how could it have gotten by without having kicked up more dust?

Each time I watch it I enjoy it more, each time I watch it I appreciate it more.  It becomes like picking up and studying a finely crafted object; it suddenly hits you:  hey, there're no seams here, no rough joints; its finish is wonderfully even.  How'd they do this?  And then you think:  Well, Goldberg and Alexander......sure, they've been around for awhile and are truly spot-on here, but.....Bucatinsky...who is this guy??!!?? (only the one who crafted/wrote this play-to-movie, of course).....and Ruccolo...wow...where'd all this acting depth come from of a sudden?  And however in the world did one apparently straight guy actor playing against one apparently gay guy actor get this so right?  Well, the answer has to be, of course, that they understood if it's about love, it just doesn't matter whether 2 guys, or guy and gal, or 2 gals are the focus.  These actors obviously came to realize that, and so it became easy for them to act that.  (Not something that two other guys, named Ennis & Jack, were ever fortunate enough to learn in time, eh?).

Well, on to a bit of what this movie's all about.  A pure romantic comedy this is NOT.........perhaps, more correctly, it's a ""dramedy."" After all, how many mainstream gay movies have you seen in which a character utters such descriptively jarring words (see title of this review) after a sexual act that's earlier taken place? Yes, this movie's for real and is very much a real life movie. Just stop to think about it---that when you've had Eli's and, particularly, Tom's kinds of childhood---well, you'll then have a great deal to overcome in adult life, whether it be a heterosexual or homosexual one. And if you, dear reader, haven't grown up in a household where alcohol has been a parental ""drug of choice,"" then don't presume to judge Tom's behavior in this movie. Most realistically, Ruccolo has made Tom a direct product of his parent's relationship.

In this dramedy Ruccolo gives us an especially intense performance which is actually easy to see, if you will only carefully watch his scenes: the telling facial expressions and eye movement; his body-set when he, for example, moves to stand against Eli in one scene, or to unobtrusively cup Eli's hands in another; even his movement of jaw muscles (did someone think his role through, or not!) His end-of-film, wedding kitchen tirade (""Hey!!!!!........"") is more than enough to almost scare and stop any viewer short, as it certainly does Eli in that scene. This guy is one hell of an actor......why haven't we since seen a lot more of him? (The ""curse"" of playing a gay role, the hex of giving us such an intense guy-on-guy bedroom scene; is there such a jinx as this?)

Yet it is in Eli's control freak behavior that lies Tom's salvation. For, of all the inappropriate things Eli's shrink parents (and they're marvelously performed) have given him that they shouldn't have, it's his capacity for understanding (which they also bequeathed) that will in the end save Tom......and Eli, himself, for that matter. And Bucatinsky is just great at showing us a little bit of ourselves (or, perhaps, a lot) in his skillful portrayal.

If you're reading reviews for a movie such as this, then please accept my recommendation to make it a part of any DVD collection you may have.....it's more than worthy of repeated viewings.......you'll catch so much more each time that you do.

PS--Can't help but conclude these comments by saying that, IF ""I"" had been the scriptwriter for this marvelous little film, the following is the way ""I"" would have wrapped things up.  At movie's end we'd find our struggling duo sitting and conversing in a garden, when all of a sudden you'd see in their eyes and faces---as if the proverbial light bulb's been turned on---each one realizing that they have in the other what they've been needing and wanting all along.  What a great heart-swelling moment it'd be for us, eh?  (Oh.......what's that, you mean somebody else already's done that?)

Director Julie Davis does an excellent job of steering this movie and preventing it from going the way of many gay films: manic and choatic. The two lead characters have tremendous chemistry together and as the viewer you are drawn into their relationship and can identify with many parts of this story: a shy blind date, the flutter of butterflies in your stomach, that first kiss, the conflicts, and the adjusting to someone else in your life and making that choice to let someone into your heart.

1646467,2,B00005QAQD,"Last night I saw ""I Think I Do,"" then tonight I thought I was watching ""All Over the Guy,"" -- in a way, though, I felt like I was watching the same movie. Both of them are colorful, bright and snappy; both of them feature self-hating gays who fall in love with straighter, butcher type men. Both have one of their leading men who has a fag hag best friend. Both insist on having their characters talk as fast as possible, as if the world is an episode of ""Friends"" or ""Will & Grace."" Both are disappointing as almost all the characters are totally selfish, self-involved people whose little worlds are all about ""relationships"" -- and yet, no one seems capable of really having one, because everyone explodes over incredibly stupid, pointless things, followed by episodes of sulking, sighing, crying or feeling sorry for themselves and/or saying, ""I'm sorry."" Both have the self-hating gay protagonists dismiss the love interest so many times that I thought, ""You know what? You don't deserve to have this man, because your world is so tiny and self-absorbed that there isn't enough room for love or acceptance for someone who isn't exactly like you.""

I simply do not get these movies or what their points are. It's nice that people made these films so that gay men could get screen time in quasi-romantic comedies, but I felt that most of the characters were cardboard cut-outs and that the deepest thing any of them had ever experienced was an enlarged pore.

Richard Ruccolo in AOTG and Christian Maelen in ITID were superior actors compared to Dan Bucatinsky and Alexis Arquette, the supposed leads, respectively. Not only were they were physically more attractive, they were more skilled as actors. The ""leads"" on the other hand were... Dan looks like the son of Barry Manilow and Alexis looks like the son of Herman Munster.  They might be great as character actors, but not people to watch for an entire feature length film.

The thing that bothered me most about both films is that they seemed to have their own private shorthand conversations and humor. I felt like I was excluded from the ""clique"" and that it was just too damn bad if I didn't get their blathering and blabbering.

AOTG is the superior of the two films because it didn't have fifteen subplots and their were more laugh out loud moments. However, AOTG used the ""f"" word almost every five minutes, even having Ray Romano's TV mother Doris Roberts blurt it out as often as they could get her to do it -- but for what reason, I don't know. The movie could have had broader appeal if they didn't absolutely insist on using the ""f"" word -- it didn't achieve anything at all.

AOTG is also the superior because of (what amounts to) cameos by Lisa Kudrow (hysterically funny as a clueless voiceover actress) and Andrea Martin as the psychologist mother of Eli  (the self-hating gay man).

I kept hoping for more, but I felt empty at the end of both films. It's great that they actually got the funding to be made and I can certainly appreciate the love that went into making them. But I wish the characters could have been richer and the humor not quite so sitcom. Sitcom humor is funny, but it belongs on the TV screen, not the silver screen.",1140220800,5,3213,4.634446397188049

Their friends (Sasha Alexander and Adam Goldberg) have a less-rocky but equally funny romance.  The two couples are compared and contrasted and the result is an interesting, insightful, funny, and touching movie that works exceptionally well.  Sasha Alexander, particularly, is a standout in this wonderful ensemble cast.

The dialog in this film is exceptionally tight and very funny.  You have to listen carefully to get all the jokes and probably watch it more than once.  Probably, you will want to.

You can relax, sit back, enjoy. . . no-one moaning on and on about how much they hate themself, no suicides--just very adorable, lovable people struggling simply to be true to themselves and every once in awhile making you burst out in laughter in the process.",1101513600,4,1048,4.427083333333333
1646472,5,B00005QAQD,"""All Over the Guy"" is a romantic comedy with enough drama to make it an engrossing film. It is about an adorable yet nerdy, neurotic, perfectionist, named Eli (Dan Bucatinsky), and his search for ""the one"" person to spend the rest of his life with. It is easy to see why he is high-strung. Eli has over-protective Jewish parents, who are not only shrinks, but they psychoanalyze his every feeling.
Tom (Richard Ruccolo) is a promiscuous, self-hating, recovering alcoholic, who fears commitment, especially when he likes a person-or worse-the person likes him. He goes back to Alcoholics Anonymous when he falls off the wagon; he claims the trigger as being ""all over this guy.""  At AA, Tom vows to quit drinking-and guys-because he cannot be trusted with either. Tom was raised by uncaring, bickering, alcoholic parents, who fostered his fear of intimacy. When you meet his parents at their country club you understand why Tom is the way he is. Richard Ruccolo is irresistible as Tom.
Jackie (Sasha Alexander) is Tom's best friend. She meets a guy named Brett (Adam Goldberg), who works at a furniture store, and immediately falls for him. She finds out Brett has a gay friend, Eli, and since she has a gay friend, Tom, she devises a way to get a date with Brett by fixing their two friends up. Jackie and Brett arrange for Eli and Tom to go on a blind date while they cement their own relationship.
Eli and Tom's blind date was awkward and both men decide it was a disaster. Then, they run into one another at a flea market and feelings begin to stir. They have a quick fling, cheapened by Tom claiming it was a mistake. Eli didn't know what to make of it. Every time Eli thinks Tom is letting him in-Tom backs away because of fear. Tom tells another member of AA the story about his rocky relationship with Eli. The person turns out not to be his ally.
Eli meets a receptionist at an STD Testing Clinic, Esther, played by the hilarious Doris Roberts (Everybody Loves Raymond), and tells her the whole story about Tom and him, while waiting to be tested for HIV. Doris Roberts does not disappoint as the yenta (busybody) who gets Eli to open up and share his feelings.
Eli's parents (Andrea Martin and Tony Abatemarco), as liberal therapists, are hysterical. Dr. Wyckoff, Eli's mother, is the epitome of the smothering, meddling, Jewish mother who drives her son crazy. She gives him neurosis he probably wouldn't have had, had she not gotten her PhD in order to use her ""expertise"" on him.
Lisa Kudrow plays a perfect airhead, Marie, in a cameo performance, as an actor trying, and barely succeeding, to make a radio commercial. Christina Ricci plays Eli's sister, Rayna, who is a nice addition to the ensemble.
""All Over the Guy"" is about the trials and tribulations of relationships and love. It is a funny, delightful, double date, which is positively yummy. The movie mixes comedy with drama. I have seen All Over the Guy several times and it cracks me up every time. It is such a feel good movie you want to feel good repeatedly. This movie includes an incredible cast, good music, likeable characters, an interesting story line, and a witty screenplay, written by Dan Bucatinsky. These fine elements all come together to make this an incredible movie.",1085961600,7,3259,4.6975524475524475

The story was realistic in regard to the difficulty of getting to know someone and the baggage involved with the late 20's single scene. I was drawn in and enjoyed the film.

1646505,5,B00005QAQD,"Few movie buffs can argue that ""Annie Hall"" was one of the better film classics to come out the last half of the 20th century. Few movies have summed up themselves up as brillantly as Woody Allen's dialogue at the end of the movie when discussing the difficulties and frustrations of relationships people constantly put themselves through because ""they need the eggs."" While this movie was created on a limited $500,000 and may not convey this theme as convincingly as ""Annie Hall,"" it comes very close. Update the topic of ""Annie Hall"" some 20+ years later with the additon of a gay angle and you have ""All Over The Guy."" As the plot is described in many reviews here, I won't do that, but instead give some of my perceptions of this wonderful movie! A good combination of actors, dialogue, and songs, especially the two by Peter Stuart, which set a nice tone for important parts in the movie- this flick is a winner!
While some reviewers may not completely understand Tom's (Richard Ruccolo) flip-flop personality of nice guy/bad guy in dealing with Eli (Dan Bucatinsky), it makes perfect sense for people who do not feel good enough for a partner they are in love with due to a lack of self-worth within themselves. Particularily in light of the frowns and pressures put on gays in general society, Tom's rebuffs, isolation, one night stands, and alcoholism are easily understood. Both Tom and Eli's personalities, fears, hesitancies, idiosyncrasies, and quirks are ""explained"" and very well done in scenes involving their relationships with their parents both in the present and in flashbacks as children as Mr. Allen did in ""Annie Hall."" One of the powers of ""All Over The Guy"" is how well it communicates the premise that we are who we have become due to the influences of our parents and siblings as we grow up. We become consciously or unconsciously ""extensions"" of our own parents and family as adults due to our life experiences with them.
Julie Davis, the director, and Dan Bucatinsky, who wrote this storyline as a play involving two straight couples do an incredible job of adapting this updated story to the big screen with a gay and straight couple. Great casting and good dialogue, some have unfairly critized, I think, as being too ""Friends""-like or ""soapy."" That's not too surprising to me as two of the actors, Adam Goldberg and Dan B., have both appeared in ""Friends""; Sasha Alexander from ""Dawson's Creek""; and Richard Ruccolo is of ""Three Guys and A Girl"" fame. They all carry the dialogue, however, in admirable and entertaining fashion. Add Lisa Kudrow of ""Friends"" and Doris Roberts of ""Everyone Loves Raymond"" in great cameos and you've got the whipped cream on the cake. I can't say enough good things about Andrea Martin- the cherry on top of the whipped cream! Ms. Martin- very under-rated and under-appreciated- is one of the funniest comedians and character actresses of our time. Most of her portrayals are borderline-line genius and she doesn't disappoint in this film! Finally, Richard Ruccolo's portrayal of Tom made him the ""shining star"" in this movie. I came away with a newfound respect for him as an actor than simply labeling him as a ""sit-com"" actor. I am perplexed why we haven't seen more of him in starring roles after viewing this film.
While some may tire of Tom and Eli's on again-off again tug-of-war relationship, it speaks a brillant and universal truth in a great screenplay about a relationship(s) we may have ourselves been in at one time or that we know someone has been in at sometime. The movie flows evenly through funny and serious moments and has one of the most personally intense love scenes- gay or straight- I've ever seen in a movie. While the scene is short on both length and skin, I felt for a brief flash that I was actually ""intruding"" into a very personal moment between two people. Bravo Dan and Richard!
I consider this movie to be one of the better gay-themed movies to be released over the past few years and one I have advocated my friends to see. The DVD also has some nice additions with a commentary track, an additional short film, and an alternate ending. Word of warning! Watch the movie, let it sink in, and assess it (as this is how it was released in the theatre) before watching the alternate ending. It will completely alter your perception of the film. For those who haven't seen this movie or those who were not impressed initially, I say watch or re-watch it from the perspective of what ""Annie Hall"" conveyed to us about relationships and what makes them so hard. I guarantee you will come away affected, moved, impressed, and inspired by this film.",1076371200,9,4640,4.758064516129032

The film centres around two guys who are brought together by their best friends for a blind date, and they coudnt be more different. Once neurotic and slightly camp, the other troubled and very straight acting, both with their family issues which had left their marks on them; they have difficulties trying to start a relationship, but you end up really wanting them to be happy and get together.
Whilst not groundbreaking, I thought it truly enjoyable; I giggled my way through the whole film.
Good extras too which includes an interesting alternate ending.
The cameos from Christina Ricci and Lisa Kudrow were unexpected and amusing.",1073952000,3,670,4.991071428571429

Along the way, brilliant cameos illuminate and enhance the plot, from the hilarious (Lisa Kudrow's turn as a voice-over actress), to the tragic (Joanna Kearns's appearance as a bitter, alcoholic mother), to the just plain out-there (Andrea Martin shining brighter than ever as a neurotic PhD who hated In and Out as much as I did).

This is a story about two gay men, screwed up in their own ways, having a strained relationship. This story is funny, romantic and ultimately satisfying. That, and one of the main characters is such a cutie....too bad he's straight in real life ;-)
The verdict? If you like gay themed movies, this is a must. If you just like funny or romantic movies, and aren't put off by a gay element, which to be honest is not really that important to the story, this is a definite must-see!",1068336000,2,646,4.391666666666667
1646509,4,B00005QAQD,"I've been searching and waiting patiently for the perfect gay film to come along.  Something with a real plot and real characters.  Something that doesn't pander to the straight audience, but doesn't play exclusively to gays.  Something with bite AND a heart.  Julie Davis' ""All Over the Guy"" comes close... so close.  And then tanks.
The story in brief: while shopping in a furniture store, Jackie (Sasha Alexander) meets furniture designer/salesman Brett (Adam Goldberg).  The sparks are instant.  After realizing that they both have a gay male best friend, they decide to fix the two of them up.  The first date of Eli (Dan Bucatinsky) and Tom (Richard Ruccolo) goes down in flames, but on a second meeting something ignites.  But Tom's alcohol fueled insecurities and Eli's need for order makes their ensuing relationship rocky.  Essentially, they just can't seem to get it together.  Will true love prevail?
Look, I really, REALLY wanted to love this film.  In the end, I liked it a lot, but it missed that being-a-classic benchmark by a good distance.  Here's why:
There aren't many films with opinions are widely and clearly polarized as those regarding ""All Over the Guy.""  That's a nice way of saying you either loved it or hated it.  Me, I can understand both points of view... if you aren't into snappy, overly-glib, ""Friends""-like dialogue you are going to definitely hate this film.  I happen to love that sort of stuff.  Okay, call me shallow, but the movie made me laugh out loud on several occasions.  (Example... BRETT: ""Be there or be square.""  ELI: ""I hate when people say that.  'Cuz even when I'm there, I'm square, so where's the incentive?"")  Overall, I thought the dialogue was sharp, and the juxtaposition of a gay relationship against a straight one was handled nicely.
I also really liked the acting in this film.  All of the supporting characters do a nice job bringing in a level of quirkiness to their small parts (I mean, c'mon... how funny was Andrea Martin as Eli's analysis-obsessed mom?), and the four leads handle what they're given with tenacity and appeal.
Likewise, the first three-quarters of this film are structured well and interesting.  I hate to say it, but it really drew me in.  The non-linear storyline doesn't feel choppy or forced.  So what went wrong?  Why does that final quarter of the film take such an incredible nosedive?
The primary blame has to be placed on the character of Tom.  As much as the filmmakers try to make this Eli's story, the crux of the action centers around Tom's behavior when faced with a potentially fulfilling relationship.  We're asked to believe that Tom is a nasty drunk, and his addiction is why he endlessly treats poor Eli like a yo-yo.  And although we never really see Tom even remotely plastered, we can see that he's overflowing with anger and bile.
What the script doesn't do is completely justify Tom's wild swings from wanting to be near Eli to harshly and nastily (really nastily) pushing him away.  And it all reflects poorly on the character of Eli, who never truly tells Tom to get lost.  I wanted so badly for someone to just level this jerk... when it does sort-of happen at the film's climax, Tom's reaction is to DEFEND himself.  What is all this saying?  ""Oh, poor damaged me... my lousy upbringing gives me the right to treat others like ca-ca.""  Sorry, I don't buy it.
Similarly, I don't buy Tom's seemingly happy-go-lucky decision to end up at AA.  The fact that alcoholism is simply wrecking his life is woefully unexplored.  Most of all, that angle of the story completely lacks any grit and bite.  Alcoholism is ugly.  It's a disease that can kill, just like AIDS or cancer or any other unpleasant illness.  Here, it's handled like a plot device, giving its sufferers a reason to be verbally cruel, and nothing else.
Please note that I can't blame Richard Ruccolo for any of his character's failings.  He does an amazing job with what the script gives him.  He plays his winning smile and boyish good looks to the best of their ability.  Likewise, his control onscreen is superb... he's one of the rare breed of actors who can flash a single facial expression and it says pages worth of words.  (Just imagine Keanu Reeves in the part and you'll see the complete opposite of what I'm talking about.)
Nonetheless, I was exhausted with the on-again-off-again nature of Tom and Eli's relationship by the end of this film.  And as much as Tom has something of an excuse for his yo-yo-like behavior, Eli doesn't have one for not just telling him to shove-off.  We're asked to believe that it's because he sees something greater in Tom, but by the final quarter of the film it looks more like Eli hasn't an ounce of self-respect.  The ending seems entirely forced; any two everyday gay men in Los Angeles would have called it quits long, long before these two.
It's too bad, because there was so much in this movie that I really enjoyed.  I'd love to see this group try again with something meatier.  How about this: explore the alcoholism angle with depth and sincerity by adapting Augusten Burrough's hilarious, self-deprecating book ""Dry"" into a film?  And please cast Rich Ruccolo in the lead!",1066176000,6,5197,4.746651785714286
1646510,5,B00005QAQD,"I thought this would be a cute gay romantic film with little kinks in the plot but ultimately end in fuzzy sweetness.  Basically, a nice, light movie.  Well, it does end sweetly, but the journey that took us there was full of twists and turns and hardships and heartache that showed us relationships take work.  It isn't add water, mix and presto.  Dan Bucantinsky, in addition to being so cute and sexy (is he single?), brilliantly adapted his play into this marvelous script that realistically depicted many issues in relationships, whether gay or straight, in which two people must overcome a lot of personal problems in their own life and background, accept each other as they are and move on, learn to love themselves, and finally come full circle to love someone else.  The story is framed in clever and funny flash back scenes (that incidentally also deliver a responsible message of safe sex in this age of AIDS) with incredible lead and supporting casts (Doris Roberts, Andrea Martin, Joanna Kerns, Lisa Kudrow, etc.).  Dan played the main character - as smart, funny, vulnerable, clever, dysfunctional, normal, abnormal, dynamic, timid and so very sexy!  It definitely felt as if he wrote and acted from personal experience.  I certainly related to many of his plights.  Richard Ruccolo was fantastic as his alcoholic, commitment-fearing love interest who is capable of great affection as well as distance.  Ruccolo really made that character work - I've liked him ever since that ABC sitcom, ""Two Guys, A Girl . . . .""  Sasha Alexander and Adam Goldberg were the hilarious straight couple who set the two guys up in the first place as a way to get to each other.

1646512,3,B00005QAQD,"An earlier review mentions that nepotism (of the boyfriends variety) played a big role in getting this film made. If true, that would support my sense that this film suffers from a huge case of the entitlement heebie-jeebies.
Much of the unrelentingly ""witty"" dialogue seems italicized, as if the writer had been told way too many times how cute and clever he was at poolside brunches at James Whale's house. More annoying is the writer/protagonist's bone-deep assumption that his dream-man's commitment issues are character flaws rather than a sensible response to Our Hero's prissy Felix-Ungerism. Perhaps the biggest entitlement giveaway is the number of times satellite characters tell Hero-boy how ""fantastic"" and what an ""amazing man"" he is when, at best, he seems mildly pleasant -- and at worst (and more often) a grating pain in the butt.
""All Over"" isn't a total waste. There's real charm in some of the performances (in particular Ruccolo's), and technically it's not too bad (especially given what was, I suspect, a home-video budget).

However, he has been in several other things since and I cannot watch most of them because - well they were bad - so I am not that much of a fan I guess.
As for this movie, I did not get enlightened on any gay or other social issues (thank you) - there is way too much of that in ""minority"" movies. Nor was it so filled with nudity, sex, or other things - that usually make you wonder if it should be classified as porn. Nope, this is a movie... like other movies...

1646537,4,B00005QAQD,"""All over the guy"" is a winning romantic comedy that brilliantly explores both gay and straight relationships, perfectly capturing the fears, foibles, and confusion facing modern twentysomethings looking for love.
Eli (Dan Bucantinsky, who also adapted the script from his stage play) and Tom (Richard Ruccolo) are complete opposites, set up by their two straight best friends, Jackie (Sasha Alexander) and Brett (Adam Goldberg) after a chance encounter in a furniture store.
Eli and his sister (Christina Ricci) are the products of therapist parents (his mother is played by the always hilarious Andrea Martin) who over-express, over-analyze and idealize love. The exact opposite of Eli, Tom is a detached, promiscuous alcoholic unable to express the slightest emotion. The two share a night of physical attraction but after constant bickering they quickly conclude that they cannot have a meaningful relationship. Despite a few chance encounters, the seemingly polar opposites quickly fall back into their single routines: Eli hits therapy and Tom hits the bars. Meanwhile, a blooming relationship and subsequent engagement between Jackie and Brett forces the estranged Eli and Tom to finally face one another, allowing more romantic complications to arise.

Julie Davis (writer, star, and director of last year's lesser ""Amy's Orgasm) wonderfully directs the large cast with consistent skill and judgment, while Bucatinsky comes up with some unexpected revelations that effectively add darker tones to his abundant sense of humor. Best of all, ""All Over the Guy"" displays a light, warm, funny, and unself-conscious quality, making it loads of fun.

If you want an artist's view of how humans stumble through life and love (and if you can tolerate a happy ending), you'll enjoy AOTG.  The final scene, the wedding dance in the sunset over LA, still plays in my memory, with the Jayhawk's ""I'm Gonna Make You Love Me"". This movie is a celebration, equally, of friendship, of love between men and women, and love between men. I like it a lot.

Director Julie Davis didn't intend to illustrate a stereotypical gay film that deals with 'coming out', 'Drugs and Sex' or 'fighting aginst AIDS'. This movie is just about a relationship whose main characters happen to be gay. I like movie with this sort of healthy approach. Writer Dan Bucatinsky should be praised for that also. However, the plot was too common thus predictable. Well, at least it's still a good  choice for a relaxing evening filled with laughters. I must conclude that Richard Riccolo just shines!

1646542,5,B00005QAQD,"I had ordered the DVD of ""All Over The Guy' on the strength of Richard Ruccolo. I loved him in '2guys and a girl' and was eager to see him in another role. Richard really breaks out of the sitcom mould in this movie - his characterisation of a chain smoking, heavy drinking masculine gay man is nothing short of breathtaking. The film itself is wonderful. It really delves into the difficulties of gay relationships in todays' society and how hard it is to meet 'Mr Right'. The onscreen dynamic between Dan Bucatinsky and Richard Ruccolo is excellent - you really are drawn into the complexities of their relationship. A special note should be made of the DVD. Unlike many smaller budget, indi films, this one is packed with features such as an audio commentary, deleted scenes, storyboards, interviews, trailers and a short film made by the director that will have you glued to the screen for hours.

I think we all know the answer,  so the talk had better be at least interesting enough that we want to stay to the end. It isn't.

1646593,4,B00005QAQD,"This is a delightful movie. All roles are taken by good American character actors. I know that the writter of the play and of the script plays the lead (Eli). He is believable and very likeable.
What I enjoyed, the most, about this film, is that the gay charcters are just part of the whole fabric of the film. Their ""gayness"" is not the issue. As (most of the time) in real life, the film shows that gay people have the same problems, joys, hopes, and romantic dreams as anyone else does. The movie is simply about two guys that are the opposite of each other and about how they try to workout their differences due to the fact that they are falling in love with each other--both characters bring to the the relationship a lot of psychological garbage mainly stemming from childhood and/or dysfunctional parents. The flash backs are hysterical especially the ones about the psychologist parents.
One of my favorite actresses, Doris Roberts, has a small role that she makes simply wonderful by acting everyone else under the table.
Tom would be a character that I normally would not care too much for (my affections and sympathies being more with Eli); however, due to the skill of the actor portraying Tom, I really grew to understand, appreciate and sympathize with him. The actor is ""butcher than thou"" but still likeable.
In closing, if you desire a nice romantic movie to curl-up to--with or without someone, buy this film.",1030060800,10,1428,4.716
1646594,3,B00005QAQD,"All Over the Guy is a welcome addition to the genre which omits any homophobia or the angst of coming out and instead deals with a relationship between a couple of twenty-somethings.

The film tells two love stories that are variations on the theme of `opposites attract.'  A straight love story, which is more entertaining because it's characters are less inhibited, proceeds to marriage at several times the speed of light for reasons which are not apparent to me, unless a 10% discount on home furnishings is a much bigger factor in straight marriages than I had ever imagined.  All the better to contrast, however, with all the obstacles the two gay guys keep throwing in each other's way.
Dan Bucatinsky is Eli and Richard Ruccolo is Tom in the gay love story; between them they bring enough baggage to their prospective relationship to sink the Titanic on a warm, sunny day in the Tropics.
Ruccolo is not the actor from `Two Guys a Girl and A Pizza Place' I would have expected to show up in a gay love story and  I did not care for him at first but nuances of his performance have impressed me on subsequent viewings.  Still, he is not very
convincing either as an alcoholic or recovering alcoholic or even as a drunk (btdt).  As Tom, a Special Ed teacher, he is very involved with his kids but judgmental and unapproachable to he rest of the world, unless you have a drink in your hand.
Screenwriter and producer Bucatinsky plays the choice role of Eli well.  He is a manipulator, a little nerdy, a little nellie, a bit of a voyeur and an exhibitionist.  He has eyes that make him look like he's the one with the problem with the bottle.  Raised on the psychobabble of est, Eli has an addiction, like Tom, but not to the bottle:  he's desperate for a man, and willing to put up with anything to get one.  What he see's in Tom is never very apparent to me.

The supporting roles are all well played.  Sasha Alexander and Adam Goldberg as the straight couple are cute and entertaining even if their supposed attraction is incomprehensible to me.  The roles of the parents of Tom and Eli are very well acted also.  I shudder at every scene with Eli's creepy-feely parents.  Doris Roberts of `Everybody Loves Raymond' is excellent as the gosspy receptionist at the AIDS clinic, but the role is a lame story-telling device.
But for all it's plusses the film gives me no great satisfaction.  It seems shot for the small screen, not the big one, entertainingly cute and not so offensive or passionate or probing of the issues or larger than life that it couldn't slip into your living room once a week, same time, same channel, for a couple of years and not really make much difference whether you missed an episode or two now and then, like most sitcoms or TV melodramas.

The characters mouth platitudes about relationships and cliched lines - Tom's `You do the math' is particularly overworked and not very applicable to some of the situations in which he tosses it out - and a few truly horrible ones.  Tom says to an acquaintance at an AA meeting ""and then we went where two men have never gone before,"" Oh yeah? I kinda doubt it. Eli says to Tom on their second time in bed together ""do you have a thingy?""
It's not really much of a love story, when you get down to it.  The characters have too many annoying character defects and seem too ill-suited to each other for me to really care much whether they ever get around to admitting they care about each other at all and I don't feel much of a sense of jubilation at the end when they finally do.  I give `em about 6 months.

Being that realistic, some people will love this film and some will loathe it, and many will find a happy in-between place in their hearts for this film, which runs the emotional gamut and pushes most of your buttons.

The guy and gal who played ""matchmaker"" are developing their own relationship at the same time as the gay male couple they introduced, and the ongoing comparison/contrast is quite entertaining and enlightening.  Those who dislike ""formula"" gay-themed films (In my opinion, ""In & Out"" is rightly attacked in this film as unrealistic and contrived) will especially like this fresh approach, fleshed out with vivid characterizations that make it impossible not to ""take sides"" in the arguments that develop between the two sets of couples.

The humor is quick and breaks up the emotions of Tom trying to overcome alcholic tendancies and images of a broken and drunk home as he tries to find love with Eli.  Ultimately, fighting these demons and allowing love to take wings is a re-assuring message.  Positive images of gays and straights from the twenty-some-thing group, who are obviously well-off (this may make it seem too idealistic), is also a nice change.",1029024000,4,815,4.955882352941177

...
So when I saw this movie, I must admit my hopes weren't that high.  But this movie did more than pass that meager bar.  Bucatinsky and Ruccolo put forth great performances as the lead (gay) couple, neither of them camping it up or relying on overblown stereotypes (with the exception of a few ""all gay men like xyz"" type jokes).  At the same time, neither man's straight-acting character comes anywhere near the closet either: there is little indication of either character being anything other than who they *are*.
The love story is tortuous, but then I guess that's the point. Ruccolo's character is flawed and has a difficult time allowing himself to fall in love.  Bucatinsky's character -- well, maybe he's a little too much of a pushover, but it made for a great ending.  I like how the movie shied away from the typical ""riding off into the sunset"" ending in favor of a simply, slightly optimistic (but no promises) fade-off.

1646600,4,B00005QAQD,"gay and straight individuals because the inherent problems in the building of any relationship are identical no matter the gender mix.
This film obviously has added interest to the gay community because finally here is a down-to-earth romance/relationship story applicable to their own personal experiences, because the relationship at the forefront of the tale happens to involve two men.  Interactions, routine love story trimmings, all the things we heterosexuals find familiar in the majority of motion pictures are here in very everyday, ordinary, and realistic events occuring between two people in their search for a partner who happens to be of the same gender.
A large portion of viewers of either sex and any sexual orientation will be able to identify with a first meeting that comes off less than perfect, but germinates a spark of interest that continues to grow despite problems that insinuate themselves between two good people who may or may not be good for one another.  Just such an evolving emotional roller-coaster is encountered by the two nice, but very different, men in this really enjoyable film.
Some of the deepest loves flourish between two people who are so busy convincing themselves and each other that they are not 'right' for one another that they totally miss the obvious until it smacks them on the lips.
Eli and Tom (Dan Bucatinsky and Richard Ruccolo) allow themselves to be distracted by the baggage they have been busily packing since early childhood while their love grows up, around, and through their hang-ups and flowers despite their best efforts to thwart any possible positive romantic conclusion.
Both male leads are believable in their sharply drawn characters.  The fact that one is a hunk and one a more a plain-joe makes the story more realistic.  Look around at the couples you know, both hetero- and homosexual.  Rarely are both partners eye-candy, perfect specimen, movie-star-type individuals.  Too much ego to squeeze into one relationship.
That both these men had childhoods that were more than a little dysfunctional was also quite believable.  We are each products of our upbringing, some of us just take a little longer to become our own person.  For these characters, their past and parents definitely formed the individuals they were and obviously who they were was the very reason they fell in love.  Who each ultimately became was due mainly to what they offered each other in addition to their love.
The straight-couple (Sasha Alexander and Adam Goldberg) and the cameos and supporting  cast (including Doris Roberts) were interesting and brought some diversity to the film, but I found I focused on the ups-and-downs and humor surrounding the main characters.

This film has a lot to say, but entertains us thoroughly while reminding us of the less-than-perfect path that leads to perfect love.  Gay or straight, this funny and touching movie about the pitfalls of falling is definitely worth watching.",1026345600,3,2968,5.122153209109731

My friends & I are thinking about joining an ""All Over The Guy"" support group, because, not a few weeks go by that we don't watch this flick, or share it with friends, who always love it, & usually go out & buy it themselves. Yeah, we find it that funny. There may be a couple of moments that will fly over heterosexuals heads... But for the most part, this movie is for everyone...The premise of the just met & really hot for each other straight couple, hysterically played by Sasha Alexander & Adam Goldberg, who have a first date kind of based on the condition of fixing up their respective best friends, both of whom are gay, gets the ball rolling. The best friends are flawlessly, humorously, and touchingly played by Richard Ruccolo and Dan Bucatinsky, Bucatinsky also being the writer and producer of this film. (Yeah, the boy is talented.)The trials of dating, gay or straight, and the ridiculous walls we put up in order to avoid intimacy, which would thereby result in us ""exposing ourselves"", and committing the punishable- by- death crime of being ""vulnerable"" and admitting we're human, are universal. This film is filled with so many little bon-bons of witticism, that you'll uncover new ones on each viewing. And you'll be screeching at the all too familiar patterns we all employ, where love is concerned. This is a great ensamble cast, with even the smallest parts, like Christina Ricci's, being hysterical & relevant. Also, Doris Roberts is a hoot as the clinic receptionist.

I must admit that Dan Bucatinsky (Eli) is not my idea of a perfect lead, but hey, he's a perfect foil for the oh-so abrasive character of Richard Ruccolo (Tom).  The chemistry was off-center at the start of the film, but they eventually worked their way towards becoming a delightful pair of on-and-off lovers who just couldn't get their relationship off the ground.
Richard Ruccolo is a revelation in this movie.  He is so natural as a straight-acting gay man without giving any hints that he is uncomfortable performing the rudiments of the role, such as a few kissing scenes with Dan Bucatinsky.
The script (written as well by Bucatinsky) is so witty and gay without resorting to excessive melodramatics.

Once it goes to a decent retail price, I will definitely be adding it to my video collection.  Until then, I may just go rent it again...several times.  And...Whitedane, learn to spell.  It's Christina Ricci.",1011484800,4,609,4.626168224299065
1646655,3,B00005QAQD,"This film is completely watchable. It's based on a play written by one of the stars of the film, Dan Bucatinsky. At the opening and for the first several minutes one thinks, ""Oh boy! Another cutesy little gay film with cutesy guys and cutesy jokes and punchlines!"" But then it fools you on more than one occasion with a breakthrough. There's even a high hoot or two in the movie. But my criticism of this notable effort is the same as it is with so many gay films. (..) One of the main characters in the film has a severe drinking problem. He's cute and buff and something to take home. The only way - apparently - alcoholism manifests itself is by making a person reticent to commit. (...) True, this film doesn't try to be ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" but I hunger for a greater sensibility in gay films. One that reflects gay life back to us the way that it is and not the way it would be if we all lived in Gay (...).",1010880000,2,914,4.198863636363637
1646656,5,B00005QAQD,"I must say that I enjoyed every single minute of this movie. Outstanding performances by Dan, Richard, Sasha and Adam.
Great performance by Doris Roberts and Lisa Kudrow.
What a SEXY and GORGEOUS guy Richard Ruccolo is. And the chemistry between him and Dan is absolutely unquestionable.
Very refreshing, funny and romantic movie.
I hope to see more of this cast very soon.
Good work guys!

1646657,3,B00005QAQD,"Yes, I really liked this movie; it is, in the end, another addition to the feel-good gay relationship movie library.  I thought the actors were very good and mostly believable; I enjoyed seeing a gay couple exhibited as having the same problems in their relationships as straight couples, I enjoyed the straight sidekicks--without whom the movie would not have been complete.
But then, on the other hand, we have another movie that is set in the la-la land of ""all gay guys are good looking;"" ""all gay guys have unlimited witty one-liners;"" ""all gay guys have a best friend who is straight;"" ""all gay guys have their own great apartments surrounded by great neighbors;"" and, the one I love the most, ""gay relationships blossom out of no shared interests between the partners.""  So as a date movie I think it's great, and I own the DVD, because I liked it that much.  But then there's that undeniably present and depressing feeling we'll all get when we leave the theater of ""why can't I have that?""  The answer, of course, is that ""that"" only exists... on the screen.  Which is fine at the movies, that's what movies are for.  In the end, while the script could have used some work to make the characters more real, I thought the cast delivered beautifully.",1009843200,33,1257,4.665158371040724

THE BROKENHEARTS CLUB did this kinda feelings for me in 2000, and then this very fine movie came along in 2001! the casts were so amazing! (especially Richard Ruccolo).

1646659,1,B00005QAQD,This is the most shallow piece of junk that I have ever seen. It tries to sell it self of as an art house flick but it is from a major releasing company with bad hollywood acting and actors (cristina richee) and overloaded with over - the - top political correctness. It is a waste of celluloid and the plot is  like a bad t.v. show. This film is insulting to anyones eyes and ears.,1009497600,2,382,4.093333333333334

This information comes directly from the DVD producer. Also, I believe the disc may contain 5.1 DD audio but am not certain.
Just wanted to let everyone know it not only is a great movie, but also a great DVD!",1008633600,,369,4.36231884057971

1. Straight people are stupid.

3. People who have absolutely nothing in common will fall in love and live happily ever after.
4. Alcoholic, studly hunks are innately attracted to nerdy, PLANET OF THE APES-obsessed queens.
5. Random strangers are just DYING to hear about your relationship problems.
6. The boyfriend of the writer/director of THE OPPOSITE OF SEX and BOUNCE can get his script produced based on no other merit than who he's dating.
