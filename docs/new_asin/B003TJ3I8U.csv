4190445,5,B003TJ3I8U,"This is another wonderful classic that I highly recommend for anyone that loves a good old fashioned love story from an era when they knew how to write captivating, sweet stories. It is worth the watch and if classic films are your thing I'm sure this will become a quick favorite! I know I love it and I would tell anyone to buy it!",1315872000,12,333,4.21875
4190446,3,B003TJ3I8U,"The story is of a down on his luck writter (Jimmy Stewart)who through a chance encounter meets an European showgirl who's about to be deported because she's illegally in the Country.  Her only way solution is to marry an American.  I suspect they threw in the fact that it would be life threatening for her to return to Europe (due to the war) because a showgilr having an affair with a rich married publisher is not a very sympathetic character.  The publisher who'd gladly get divorced but that would still not be quick enough so marrying Stewarts character is the only solution.  She offers to pay for his expenses (he's broke because he hasn't published anything yet) in exchange for marrying her.  The bargaining part of their arrangement is rather funny.  They agree on a price and so begins their business arrangement.  Their arrangement inspires Stewart's charatcer to write novel about it.  The novel comes to the attention of the publisher's wife who thinks the story is great and that her husband should make Stewart an offer for the book rights.  He doesn't think so since he recognizes that the story is about him, Stewart and Lamarr.  Needless to say Stewart falls in love with Lamarr and when Lamarr wants to get divorced so that she can marry the publisher then Stewart comes up with a plan to take her on a trip to his home town so that he can make her fall in love with him.  I'm not going to say more except to say that it's a happy ending.  The actress who plays his grandmother is simply amazing.  I wish that she could have been more often on screen.

***This is a slightly disapointing romantic comedy.  It's not the fault of the actors because both do a good job playing their parts.  I think that 86 minutes isn't enough time to develop the story properly and therefore their are some gaps that could have been filled with an extra 15 minutes of film.  It's till a nice enough movie to make the price worth it.",1312156800,2,1935,4.514367816091954
4190447,5,B003TJ3I8U,Great Classic movie. I love James Stewart and Hedy Lamarr. This is a great classic love story.

A must have Classic movie in your collection.,1307750400,7,340,3.9420289855072466
4190448,5,B003TJ3I8U,". . . but they've got to know each other before they get divorced.""  So Bill Smith (Jimmy Stewart) explains to Johanna ""Johnny Jones"" Janns (Hedy Lamarr) in this romantic comedy with Capra-esque overtones.

Married as strangers to enable her to avoid deportation, penniless would-be writer Bill understandably falls for Johnny, a wealthy cosmopolitan beauty whom he only sees once a week when she brings a check.  In return for the formality of the marriage she has agreed to bankroll him during what turns out to be his first successful writing project, a book called Without Love based on his unlikely and mostly imaginary relationship with her.  Just as he reaches this professional success and resolves to pursue her affection, she asks for a divorce so she can marry an older and more equally matched man, a wealthy publisher.  As a condition for agreeing to the divorce, though, Smith insists she get to know him first, enlisting the help of the peaceful countryside he grew up in and his homey plain-spoken grandmother.  Neither knows the publisher who has bought his book is the same she hopes to marry.

While not perfect in every gesture like Stewart's earlier&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shop-Around-the-Corner/dp/B00006FDCV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shop Around the Corner</a>, this is still a fun, clever and sweet film with two very attractive leads.  Occasional rough edges are more than made up for with some fine moments of comedy and romance.  Fans of the actors and the genre won't be disappointed.",1294704000,21,1565,5.381147540983607
4190449,4,B003TJ3I8U,"Jimmy Stewart and Hedy Lamarr might make an odd pair but it works perfectly in this story.  I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but suffice it to say the combination of the home spun country boy and slick beautiful city gal works perfect here.  There is also a great short performance by a late blooming actress as Stewart's grandmother.  If you like romantic comedies and are a fan of either Stewart or Lamarr you can't go wrong here.",1290729600,30,447,4.36144578313253

4190459,3,B003TJ3I8U,"At one point, back in the day, Hedy Lamarr was regarded as the most beautiful woman to ever grace cinema. And like all pig chauvinists I'll dismiss her supreme knack for mathematics. But, okay, did you know that, according to Richard Rhodes's book HEDY'S FOLLY: THE LIFE AND BREAKTHROUGH INVENTIONS OF HEDY LAMARR, she co-invented technology that was a precursor to Bluetooth? I don't believe she was ever hailed as a great actress, but, man alive, she's so stunning I could watch her onscreen all day, even if all she did was clip coupons. I have no doubt she'd make clipping coupons this wildly seductive act. Hedy Lamarr was showcased in a series of exotic melodramas (ALGIERS, WHITE CARGO, SAMSON AND DELILAH) in which she played the irresistible siren. Except I enjoyed her more in her lighthearted pictures.

(Here's a drinking game: take a shot each time you read the word ""married"" or ""marriage."")

With her temporary passport expired three months ago, an Austrian refugee (Lamarr) hiding in New York is finally tracked down by a kindly Immigration Inspector and given a one week deadline to marry an American citizen or face deportation. Naturally, ""Johnny Jones"" (her Americanized name) can't tie the knot with the rich, middle-aged publisher with whom she'd been carrying an affair, because he's already married, never mind that it's one of those ""modern marriages.""

Many minutes into the film, here strolls proud but struggling writer Bill Smith (Stewart) whose prospects are so dim he reluctantly enters into a marriage of convenience with Johnny Jones. Each week Johnny visits Bill to fork over a check worth $17.80 (Bill is a prideful minimalist when it comes to things like cost of living). This arrangement allows Johnny to stay in America and to carry on her fling with that publisher. The story conflict surfaces when, months later, Bill Smith grows dissatisfied with the contract, mainly because he'd fallen in love with Johnny and so wants a real marriage.

I rate COME LIVE WITH ME an above average 3 out of 5 stars. In 1941, when this film came out, Hedy Lamarr was at the height of her physical grace. I was so distracted by her the first time I saw this a few years ago, it took me a second viewing to realize that this movie is more mildly amusing than it is a ribald, uproarious screwball comedy. I do recommend it for its two leads and also for noteworthy performances by supporting actresses Verree Teasdale and Adeline de Walt Reynolds, both of whom lend depth to a shallow plot. Teasdale plays the two-timing publisher's wistful, understanding wife. De Walt Reynolds plays Bill Smith's endearingly crusty, proverb-slinging grandmother. But, overall, the humor is low key - you'll half-smile more than you'll chortle. There's also a sense of, I dunno, lethargy that made me fidget. Also, Johnny's sudden turnaround in the third act is a bit tough to swallow, considering how smitten she was with her publisher. Are fireflies then so magical that mere mention of them would palpitate a maiden's heart? I'll try that next time I go clubbin'.",1353801600,7,3070,4.898076923076923
