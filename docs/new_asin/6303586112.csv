696926,5,6303586112,"This is one of the most moving movies I have every seen. Albert Finney is forced by his peers to live a lie.  He overcomes his homosexuality by quoting and putting on Oscar Wilde plays. No one in the movie every really does understand this complex character, very well acted by Finney.",1125187200,,285,4.480769230769231
696927,4,6303586112,"Opening like a charming and lightweight Irish comedy, A Man of No Importance eventually proves to be more of a pathos-laden drama.  Along the way however, it never fails of be warm, with Albert Finney a joy as the kind yet internally tortured ticket collector Alfie, who is inspired to mount a production of Salome, by his idol Oscar Wilde.  Throughout the film we are treated not only to Finney, but also loveley turns by Tara Fitzgerald as Alfie's idealised Princess Salome, and Rufus Sewell as the bus driver, dubbed ""Bosie,"" the object of ALfie's unrequited affections.  The story could deteriorate into a weepy drama, but it never does, and the conclusion, although sad, is somewhat life-affirming.  A great way to spend an evening.",1014249600,9,737,4.919354838709677
696928,5,6303586112,"This debut from Suri Krishnamma is quite wonderful. Set in Dublin in 1963, it opens with Eartha Kitt singing ""Let's Do it"" and Albert Finney reading Oscar Wilde, so we know something particular is in the wind. Finney is a bus conductor who is inspired to mount a production of Salome after meeting Tara Fitzgerald. The film shows the rehearsals in the local church hall, and slowly reveals Finney's closeted sexual preference, secretly in love with someone he calls his ""Bosie"". What is interesting is the Vertigo relationship that develops between Finney and Fitzgerald. As her director, he recreates her the way he wishes to see her, which can be a common dynamic between certain men and the women they are obsessed with, and the situation is all the more resonant since Fitzgerald is so touching. Time allows the audience to like Finney, since at first his accent and face are off-putting. It seems he is trying too hard, but by the time he is dressed as flamboyantly as Wilde, we are won over. Brenda Fricker plays Finney's sister and is funny, but Rufus Sewell as the bus driver is unfortunately Method-y. However Krishnamma wisely removes him for a time and when he returns, we have Finney's idiot grin of happiness as a payoff.",992649600,8,1234,4.771028037383178
696929,5,6303586112,"This film is a truly unique and enchanting experience.  From the Wilde poem, ""The Harlot's House"" recited by Alfie(Albert Finney)to his bus passengers to Alfie's sweet and kind obsession with Wilde by dressing  like him when he goes out to the bar, you will be delighted by the deep  sensitivity of Finney to the role.  The video is one I watched several  times and enjoyed each time.  It is absorbing, funny, tender and best of  all respectful to Oscar Wilde.",949449600,2,460,4.675
696930,5,6303586112,"To say I loved this movie is an understatement.  Mr. Finney displayed his true acting expertise as the delightful director in search of his one exceptional performance.  The very thought that man or woman could fall in  love with Robbie (Rufus Sewell) makes the movie even more believable. Mr.  Sewell can speed up the heart with just a wink.  Sprinkled with light humor  ""we could die your hair blonde... like an angel,"" enables the  viewer to accept those scenes that depict how life is not always grand but  the few chuckles we get along the way make it worth living.",946512000,3,570,4.63
697011,5,6303586112,"To paraphrase a line from the film, this is a lovely story about love.  Finney is a wonderful actor, but he alone does not carry this film.  Kudos to all the supporting cast, especially Rufus Sewell.  Sewell has shown such depth and sincerity in recent roles (Lord Melbourne, John Smith) that it might be assumed he has matured as an actor, but as ""Bosie,"" and a very young man, he shows his sensitivity, humor, and skill early on.  He completely holds his own beside Finney.  By the way, I'm an older, middle-class Southern heterosexual white woman and I think this is one of the sweetest love stories I've ever seen!",1488240000,17,618,4.581818181818182

697018,5,6303586112,"This movie is fantastic! Unfortunately, I don't believe it's possible to get a copy on DVD in the US right now, which is why I went for the VHS. I then copied it over onto DVD, just in case the VHS degrades. The quality isn't amazing, but I don't expect you can get this film in great quality unless it gets remastered or something. In any case, it looks just fine for home viewing purposes, and that's all I need. It's a shame this movie isn't more widely available because it's really lovely and definitely still relevant.",1484697600,,524,4.412371134020619

697117,5,6303586112,"This is a jewel of a film.  Each element is perfect: the casting, the acting, the setting, the story. Rare and delightful.  Finney is amazing as the innocent  fan of Oscar Wilde and The Love That Has No Name.  Michael Gambon downplays the local butcher,and always main actor in the local theater,  while Rufus Sewell, in an early film role, plays a kind young motorcycling, busdriver of Dublin.  A must for anglofiles and those who love a perfect plot, dialogue, with a certain amount of angst.  Finney is a bus monitor who also runs the local amateur theater in the auditorium of the church.  I own a region free DVD player and can therefore watch DVD's from other regions.  USA-Canada is Region 1, UK and Europe, Region 2, Australia, Region 4 and so on.  You can play other regions in your computer as well.",1327622400,2,809,4.555555555555555

697119,4,6303586112,"Albert Finney is superb, as always.  Supporting cast are also very believable.  The story line is not complex, but allows/requires the viewer to do a bit of interpretation.  Good human drama.",1211760000,,191,5.096774193548387
697120,5,6303586112,"Alfie Byrne is loved by everyone. He is a simple bus conductor who has a passion for art-most importantly the plays of Oscar Wilde. He quotes Wilde,and produces Wilde's plays on an amateur level,yet unlike Wilde,Alfie has yet to reach the true knowledge of love for himself and his own sexuality. Through the works and life of Oscar Wilde,A MAN OF NO IMPORTANCE is a cleverly constructed screenplay that allows Alfie Byrne,so admirably and convincingly portrayed by Albert Finney,to find true knowledge of himself and love in his life.

This film will be greatly enhanced by an acquaintance with Wilde's work and life in order to gain the maximum satisfaction and understanding. A viewing of the film WILDE will make A MAN OF NO IMPORTANCE so much more enjoyable on all levels.

The songs LETS FALL IN LOVE and CAN'T GET USED TO LOSING YOU are used to great effect in this film.

All in all, this is an incredibly well written,well directed and beautiful tour-de-force of a film.",1172361600,4,979,4.781065088757397
7852155,5,6303586112,"This film was a tour de force of acting and story told in film. By the end I had red eyes that were watering and a lump in my throat with a widening smile. A film like this is why I like Prime a lot.  I had heard of it sometime ago and found it today for free streaming.  Truly a gift.  I watched 48 hours and the Hunt For Red October today, and this was far far superior to both.",1499472000,,380,3.6666666666666665
7852156,3,6303586112,"Assails Irish Catholic intolerance of sexuality in general and homosexuality in particular.  Released in 1994, the film was surely groundbreaking in its time for its frank portrayal of the predicament of a closeted gay man in a homophobic world.  Sad to say the figure of the homosexual protagonist Alfred Byrne is the only fully developed and genuinely lifelike character in the screenplay.  All the other characters are cartoon simplifications of Irish Catholic life and sensibility.  Moreover, the plot reduces Dublin in 1963 to a dreary soap opera about unwed motherhood and feckless clericism.  The ghost of James Joyce's rejection of Dublin provincialism haunts the film throughout.  Oscar Wilde fans will enjoy the recitation of passages from his work throughout the film and the realistic depiction of an ordinary Irishman's genuine admiration for an Irish poet's English verse.",1497225600,2,886,5.430656934306569
