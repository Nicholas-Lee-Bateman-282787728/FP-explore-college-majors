The plot involves a pistolero Martin Brady or Martin Bredi as he is known below the border in Mexico.  He is returning across the Rio Bravo to El Puerto or El Paso on business for Cipriano Castro, the local Chihuahuan warlord or 'governor', when Brady breaks a leg and is forced to stay on the U.S. side of the river for a couple months. Upon returning to Mexico he is dressed as an American and quickly becomes untrustworthy to one of the Castro brothers while refusing gunman work for the other Castro brother. Situations begin to rapdily change in Mexico and Martin Brady soon finds himself a man without a country.  Now wanted in the U.S. for killing a man, separated from a married woman he now loves, and out of favor and work by the Castro family he quickly becomes a gunman on the run.  All of this is splendidly played out by Robert Mitchum, Julie London, and Gary Merrill. One of the last large screen color western Hollywood would turn out it remains a real treat for viewers.  It's a shame it has not been released yet for region 1 DVDs.

If you enjoy not only solid, realistic western stories but good motion pictures as well, it is a good bet this movie may become one of your favorites.  Check it out soon on Encore westerns this month, January, 2009.

Adios, amigos.
