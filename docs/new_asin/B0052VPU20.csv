8454484,5,B0052VPU20,"I didn't expect much out of this movie and was surprised at how good it really is. Considering the low budget and that it was shot without a crew, this is amazing. The monster/alien effects are pretty cool, the acting is realistic,and it has a decent plot. What lies at the heart of the movie is the journey and relationship of the two main characters (who married in real life). While some may find this a little slow paced, that is part of its charm- slowly building tension. Note (slight spoiler alert)- Pay very close attention to the opening sequence as this is actually the end of the film. This film reminds me style-wise of a few other films I like - Europa Report, Cloverfield, 84 Charlie MoPic and even the Blair Witch Project, though the subject matter in each is very different. Director Gareth Edwards did a magnificent job on this. I am looking forward to his next film- he is helming the big budget remake of Godzilla. The steelbook edition is truly a beautiful addition to my collection. This has become one of my favorite films.",1389052800,,1045,4.5638297872340425
