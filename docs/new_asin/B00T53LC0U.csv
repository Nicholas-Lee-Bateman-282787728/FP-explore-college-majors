8700284,3,B00T53LC0U,"Could be a better play if the writer/director goes back to the drawing board.  Auntie needs to calm down.  Play could flow better, but it was decent.  Time the songs better, and place the stories in a more orderly fashion.  Don't let the character's lines contradict each other.  One final thing: Tyler Perry is Tyler Perry.  Be great at your own format and being you.  You are gifted in your own right.",1511049600,,403,4.513888888888889

8700292,1,B00T53LC0U,I was very disappointed to be truthful. The acting was not good and miscast to be believable. The comedy was not funny and over the top. It could have been a wonderful movie if it was seriously done. I wish that I could get my money and time back.,1434412800,,247,4.061224489795919
