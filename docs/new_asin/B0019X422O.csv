8568469,3,B0019X422O,It's badly recorded and mixed.  It's difficult to hear what Mr. Taylor is saying.,1525132800,,81,4.785714285714286
8568470,3,B0019X422O,"Like many of his interviews, much was unexplained, and what was explained didn't have a whole lot of connection to what was played.  But Taylor's performances were captivating, and those of the students were quite interesting as well.  What you learn about Taylor's creative process on the DVD will be from listening to the music.  Still a fair purchase for new fans who've not gotten to see him live, but a full DVD of him playing would have been better.",1312934400,5,455,4.6625
