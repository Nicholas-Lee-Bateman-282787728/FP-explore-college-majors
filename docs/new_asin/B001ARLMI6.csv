8326266,5,B001ARLMI6,"This film is one of my favorites of all time, and since it didn't had a wide distribution I was really pleased to find it here. The film touches relationships matters from a poetic perspective; while being very crafty, very carefully made. As a film director and teacher, this film has been set as an example of metaphoric filmmaking several times. However, if you're looking for purely entertainment, this film might seem a bit slow for you.",1322352000,,442,4.753246753246753
