5847432,2,B00DQG736E,"I bought this primarily for my niece, who was having a destination wedding in Door County.  I, myself, love ghost hunting shows AND Door County, so when I came across their website, I couldn't wait for the video to be released.  Luckily, I checked their website again just a few weeks before the wedding and realized it was finally released.  I almost bought it directly from them, but, then decided to check Amazon too, as my favorite place to shop!  Needless to say, Amazon delivered to me quickly and I was excited to watch this video.
As far as a ghost hunting video goes, it does not uncover much of anything.  Pretty much nil.  It offers a little more interest just in viewing familiar locations, and hearing about the histories and stories associated with these places.
But, I was not enthralled with their investigations.  I am happy, however, to have supported a local group.",1388448000,,884,4.701298701298701

5847434,5,B00DQG736E,"I was very happy when I received my copy of ""Ghost of Door County"" in the mail the other day. It came swiftly and the quality of the packaging/DVD far exceeded my expectations. None of that cheap plastic and/or imperfect discs that can sometime be the case with these types of purchases.

As for the movie itself, I was really impressed with the it.
Not only does it provide the viewer with excellent scenery and history on Wisconsin's Door County Area, the investigations conducted by the paranormal investigators are extremely informative, entertaining and often times humorous.

I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend the ""Ghost of Door County"" to anyone interested in ghosts, paranormal activity, and the beautiful state of Wisconsin.",1373241600,10,756,5.088709677419355

8596333,3,B00DQG736E,This movie was good in that the investigators seemed very professional about what they were doing & went to lots of interesting places. But it was boring in that they didn't use cameras much & i wanted to see that more.,1432857600,,219,4.365853658536586
8596334,3,B00DQG736E,"This movie was well produced I liked the fact that the history of each place was provided. But the part that was lacking was what most people probably watched the movie for. The hunt for evidence of the paranormal, which was never given enough time to even look as though these experts as described by the narrator would be able to gather any evidence in so little time spent. I mean, most ghost hunters spend entire nights in one location trying to document evidence. These people I swear must have spent less then an hour at some locations and certainly not anything that would be considered effective ghost hunting. I realize they may have spent more time then what was shown. But you could still tell from the editing and time frame of scenes it was not very long. At one place toward the end of the film,  the investigators complained that the owner of the bar told them to leave sooner then they wanted? No explanation, they just had to leave? I'm not saying they would have captured more evidence if they had stayed in one location more then they did. But the movie sure did not portray them as dedicated investigators.",1431648000,2,1126,4.54679802955665

8596336,1,B00DQG736E,"I have a friend whose parents live in Door County, and she's told me how haunted it is. So, it was especially disappointing that this documentary was so boring.

Why is it boring?

1. The team's investigative techniques - why doesn't everyone try for EVP everywhere? Why is there one specific location within the investigation and then only one person does it? And what's with all the EMF stuff? And the arbitrary way you decide if a place is haunted or not.

2. If you're not from there, you get no perspective about where anything is. How about a map of the county and then showing the various locations on it?

3. Boring people. Not a personality in the bunch.

4. Maybe two EVP? Out of all the investigations? And no other real evidence?

I could go on, but I don't want to bore everyone.

If you're from there or live there, this might be fun. But I can't recommend it for anyone else.",1423785600,2,890,4.390243902439025
