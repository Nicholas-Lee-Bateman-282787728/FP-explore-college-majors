5256658,5,B0093URN8K,"Excellent total body workout DVD for beginners, or advanced users.  I highly recommend buying this new DVD from SparkPeople.com and Coach Nicole.  This new DVD takes up where 28 Day BootCamp DVD left off. Very well planned for head to toe exercises, strength training and balancing.  Coach Nicole guides you through each session with ease.  You have to think about what you are doing which is a nice challenge with great results.  Kudos, Coach Nicole!",1354320000,22,451,4.96
5256659,5,B0093URN8K,"I really like the new SparkPeople Total Body Sculpting DVD.  It has a great variety of workouts that not only focus on toning, but give me some cardio, some balancing, and plenty of strength training.  The workouts are well thought out and each exercise flows from one movement to the other. Coach Nicole points out what to focus on as you do each exercise and she talks you thru a preview of the next exercise just before it begins. The exercises are clearly demonstrated in Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced levels. The music has a good tempo, with an even pace, making very easy to keep up with. It has a great blend of exercises that works several issues at once. And it even has a 10 minute bonus cardio workout that will challenge everyone.  It truly is a total body all-purpose workout video.  I received this DVD for free from SparkPeople but did not receive any form of payment for my review.",1354320000,35,904,4.561728395061729

5256661,5,B0093URN8K,"This was the prefect match for my fitness level. As an obese mid forty year old person I struggle to find DVDs that move at my pace and are challenging. This was the prefect match, I can't wait for tomorrow's workout. I am only a little disappointed that they don't have more DVD's and no male assistants",1470355200,,304,4.350877192982456

5256663,3,B0093URN8K,Unfortunately I cannot physically do any of the exercises on the D V D. So my review is unfair. I am sure someone in better health would like it,1456790400,,144,4.0
5256664,3,B0093URN8K,I would give the DVD five stars.  It is a very good DVD but there is a little part where it doesn't work for a few minutes.  Like it has a scratch on it or something.  I don't see anything.  It is right in the cool down part of the first workout.  Other than that it is an excellent DVD.,1439769600,,287,3.716666666666667
5256665,5,B0093URN8K,I think that the DVD is fantastic.  The exercises are not overly difficult and can be adjusted to any fitness level.  I am totally satisfied with my choice of DVDs.,1431129600,,164,4.433333333333334

5256682,5,B0093URN8K,"The moves look deceptively easy, but as they work on one's balance, they can be very challenging. Very effective for improving strength, balance, and coordination, which benefits us not jut for making us look and feel better, but actually improving the body's day-to-day functionality. Thanks, Coach Nicole!",1378598400,,307,5.553191489361702
5256683,5,B0093URN8K,Nichol Nichols does a wonderful job of making exercise more pleasurable.  I like that this is broken up into segments.  I highly recommend this!!!,1378512000,,146,5.041666666666667
5256684,3,B0093URN8K,"Easy to follow and complete, but just not that exciting or challenging.  This might be good for a day when you need a break (or when I have a minor injury), but I prefer my Jillian workouts or my regular runs to this.",1375920000,,217,4.046511627906977

5256687,5,B0093URN8K,"I love Sparkpeople and the videos on the site (free!) so I really wanted to check out this DVD.

5256689,5,B0093URN8K,"I have been working out to a number of tapes for years and I didn't know what to expect, in all honestly I thought it would be pretty easy.  I was nicely surprised at the intensity and challenge of the workouts.  This tape can bring variety to an experienced exerciser, but it also would be good for a someone who is just starting.  Great job Nicole and Sparkpeople!",1370044800,,366,4.352941176470588
5256690,4,B0093URN8K,Low-intensity for me to follow along with until I am in better shape and can do the harder ones.  I like these workouts and I  believe they are making a difference,1369440000,,163,4.225806451612903
5256691,5,B0093URN8K,"I have tried all the workouts on this dvd.  They are definitely a work out for me as I am a beginner.  Nicole shows 3 levels for each section.  All are easily followed, and you can do any or all of the workouts.  I have done two workouts each session.  I feel I have worked out after doing these workouts.",1369440000,,305,4.016666666666667

5256694,5,B0093URN8K,This is a total body workout.  I have never sweat so much while exercising.  I feel rejuvenated after this workout,1368144000,,114,4.65

5256696,5,B0093URN8K,"I love this CD.  It has more than one exercise on it and you can choose which one you want.

5256698,3,B0093URN8K,"This got really good reviews so I gave it a try. I do like it, but it isn't strenuous enough for me. I liked the exercises and Nicole, but have only done it once as it just didn't grab my attention.",1366416000,,198,3.8536585365853657
5256699,5,B0093URN8K,I love Coach Nicole's exercises.  They are so varied and I like the fact that there are different routines for various parts of the body.,1366416000,,137,4.48
5256700,5,B0093URN8K,I got several exercise videos a short while ago. BUT THIS IS THE EASIEST TO FOLLOW. There is a main menu at the very beginning to choose what you need instead of skipping round looking for the warm-up or cool down exerices!  There are several levels to choose from.  But even the lowest level assumes you may just be starting out to exercise...and doesn't rush through the steps. And you can follow one of the models doing a  low level or a slightly higher one in the same routine. I've done better than I thought I would've.,1366156800,4,525,4.391752577319588
5256701,5,B0093URN8K,I do this DVD with 5 other ladies & they were all impressed.  We were all sweating doing this but it was all worth it.  I would recommend this to anyone who has to shape up after losing some weight. We only wished that the music was a little more in tune with the exercises.,1365465600,,274,3.963636363636364
5256702,5,B0093URN8K,"I get a different workout every day with the choices she offers.  The warm up and cool downs are the same everyday, but after that there are 5 options that you can mix up or add up.  She offers three levels of exercise from beginner to advanced and gives tips to increase your effort or to stay low impact.",1365465600,3,306,4.169491525423729
5256703,4,B0093URN8K,Have had this about 2 weeks and really enjoy that I can cue up what I want to work on and go for it.  She is really good about offering easier and more challenging options too.. Great as always SPARKPEOPLE!!,1365465600,2,207,4.175
5256704,5,B0093URN8K,"This is a great workout video for those looking for body sculpting at home.  I love Coach Nicole because she has a caring and encouraging attitude.  She always gives options for those that feel they cannot do the advanced moves, so it's great for those that are just beginning to workout.",1365206400,,288,4.627450980392157
5256705,2,B0093URN8K,"First, let me say that I really have a lot of respect and appreciation for Sparkpeople and what they are trying to do with their program, as well as the talented Coach Nicole.  I have done this workout now at least a half a dozen times, but that is not enough to be used to the moves.  The moves are complicated and she moves quickly between the sequences (which makes sense because you want to keep your heart rate up) but what drives me crazy is the direction.  Coach Nicole says to move your right, but they are moving their left.  And then sometimes she just says switch sides instead of move it to your left, for example, so I get lost on whether I am following them like a mirror or her direction of left and right.  And then sometime it seems they say right and they are moving their right, so it looks like I should be following opposite instead of mirroring them, but I can't be sure because I haven't just sat down to watch it (I did watch it once start to finish before I ever tried the first workout, but maybe I need to do it again).  Maybe after more practice I will get it, but right now, I just want to return the DVD and get something else.",1365033600,5,1157,4.142857142857143
5256706,5,B0093URN8K,The first time I did this video I intended to follow along the best I could and before I knew it the time had passed and I'd done pretty much the whole DVD but in a very beginner sort of way.  After that I realized I had more muscles etc. than I realized.  The next time was the beginner version.  I tolerated the beginner version  more moderately and would recommend the same for other beginners.,1363737600,6,397,4.253333333333333
5256707,5,B0093URN8K,Starting out from square one after lower back injury.  The first routine was easy enough and challenging enough to work up a sweat.  Bought the 28 day bootcamp as well.  I'll use it soon and hopefully write a good review there too.,1363392000,,231,4.4523809523809526
5256708,5,B0093URN8K,"I would definitely recommend Coach Nicoles newest exercise DVD, Total Body Sculpting.

There are three workouts that you can do separately or together:
~ Barre Body Blast  all you need is a chair and some weights
~ Body Weight Burn  a mix of cardio and strength using your own body weight
~ Sizzle Sculpt Circuit  a faster-paced weight routine

I like Coach Nicoles workout DVDs. There are three people exercising and they are easy to follow. They will often show you modifications for beginners and more advanced moves for those who want a more intense workout. Coach Nicole talks you through the moves without being annoying and the room and music complement the workouts without being distracting.

I have some issues with my knees so I had to modify some of the squats and lunges but they make it easy to do that. You can use Coach Nicoles plan, which is labeled as beginner, intermediate or advanced. You can also set up your own custom workout calendar, which is something I really like. There are also other bonus items, like a couple of extra exercise routines and some Spark recipes.

This is a great way to mix up your routine or get one started.",1362355200,,1156,4.637254901960785
5256709,5,B0093URN8K,This provides some very good workouts but no longer than 22 minutes.  I feel good after doing them but not totally exausted.,1362355200,2,124,4.636363636363637
5256710,3,B0093URN8K,"I did this video last night.  It burned a good bit of calories for me.  But I found it a bit difficult to keep up with.  I am very uncoordinated and when she threw in arm and leg movements at the same time; I got lost. I will stick to a simpler exercise video for myself.  If you are coordinated, it is a very good video!  She is very detailed about the movements.",1362096000,3,364,3.9315068493150687
5256711,5,B0093URN8K,"Coach Nicole and SparkPeople did it again!  The Total Body Sculpting DVD with Coach Nicole is a great addition to my exercise DVD's.  I love that it provides a good total body workout for all fitness levels so you can choose how challenging the workouts are.  This is why I would recommend this to anyone looking for additional ways to get in some exercise.  The exercises are clearly demonstrated for beginners, intermediate and advanced fitness levels.  It includes good cardio, strength training and toning workouts.  While I prefer to exercise outdoors, it's not always possible.  The SparkPeople DVD's give me good options when it's too cold or raining outside.  I also have Coach Nicole's 28 Day Boot Camp DVD, and I love both of these.  I received this DVD for free from SparkPeople but did not receive any form of payment for my review.  Again, thanks SparkPeople for another great workout DVD!",1361923200,,902,4.875
5256712,5,B0093URN8K,"I haven't done any targeted workout for years, but consider myself to be in good shape.  I'm 46 years old and was really starting to notice the need for toning.  I wanted a workout I would stick with so I purposely didn't choose one of those popular work outs or high profile trainers.  This is perfect for me at this stage.  I can see myself moving up to a higher challenge later.  This has three 20 minutes workouts in it plus a warm up and cool down.  At first I did two of the workouts in the same session.  Because of all the squats in this video, my knees were really aching.  I currently do one workout at a time.  I really like the lower body workout you get in these sessions but the thing I like the most is the all over strengthening of muscles.  My balance was terrible doing many of these exercises.  I had no idea how much my core and legs had weakened over the years by not doing any targeted exercises.  This DVD has been a great motivator for me.  If you are in good shape already this would still be a great exercise program because they have advanced techniques you can do to add difficulty plus you could do all three segments together.",1361577600,2,1156,4.223744292237443
5256713,5,B0093URN8K,This video gets me results. It moves at a moderate pace and focuses on proper form and still gives me sore muscles. I have been running and working out regularly for over 1-year. Great for all fitness levels.,1361491200,,208,4.5

5256715,4,B0093URN8K,I really feel like these routines are a good addition to my fitness regimen.

5256717,5,B0093URN8K,"I love SparkPeople and Coach Nicole. This is a very good workout regardless of what your level is. I like that Nicole isn't in your face jumping around with a bunch of hyper people on the screen. She is relaxed, helps coach you through the moves and offers just the right amount of verbal coaching. I would recommend this workout.",1361232000,3,330,4.516666666666667
5256718,5,B0093URN8K,"I loved this DVD!  I'm not a fan of strength training at all, so I was really skeptical.  I loved that the moves are easy and you can modify them to your fitness level.  I loved that Coach Nicole is calm and that the girls in the video look ""normal.""  This is a great dvd for anyone who wants to add strength training, but hates standing still and doing free weights. I highly recommend this DVD!",1361232000,,396,4.171052631578948

If you're serious about your health and body this is a good choice for anytime workouts at home.
Coach Nicole is easy to listen to and not intimidating to work along with like some other DVD's I've purchased and returned.
Give this one a try if you've been working out or if you're just starting out try the Cardio Blast. It'll ease you in to working out and let you decide for yourself if this is for you.

As well, some cardio is included in each of these and many exercises are shown by the three women in a beginner mode, Intermediate mode and advanced level. A person can do as much or as little as is appropriate for his or her level and still have a goal to work towards. There is a good warm-up and a great stretch that can be added at the end.

Nicole's instructions are easy to understand and I like the fact that she has two other trainers working at different levels. You are able to choose to follow the trainer with the level that best suits your ability and comfort.

You also have the option to complete the full 69 minute workout from warm-up to cool-down or pick and choose an individual workout that is best for you that day.

5256733,5,B0093URN8K,"This DVD is ideal because it doesn't just focus on one part, like abs or weight training.  It features three different workouts, done at three different levels, (beginner, intermediate, and advanced), and works the entire body.  The workouts utilize a combination of interval cardio, dance, and weight training to get the heart rate up, but not so far up that it becomes too much.  The pace is challenging but not impossible, and the music helps you exercise steadily.  The workouts start at 22 minutes, include a warm-up and cool down, and you can work your way up to an advanced level using the included calendar schedule.  Coach Nicole changes it up quite a bit during the workouts, do you don't get bored.  Her calm and friendly demeanor is the perfect accompaniment to this thorough and manageable batch of exercises.",1359936000,2,822,4.877697841726619

5256736,5,B0093URN8K,"I just bought Total Body Sculpting yesterday at Target. Let me start by saying I've only done the 19 min circuit work out and felt every inch of it! I can already tell that this combo is probably going to be my favorite! This work out really gives you something to work at and think about as your doing the moves! Absolutely love the unique moves using weights, lunges and swats! Who would have thought?! I'm on a mission to become good at this routine! Can't wait to try out the others on this DVD! Great job Spark People, Nicole and whoever else that may  have been involved in creating this God send of a work out! This gets FIVE STARS from me based on the one routine alone!",1357603200,3,678,4.255813953488372
5256737,5,B0093URN8K,"OMG Everything hurtssssssss! (That's what I was saying the day after I first did this DVD.. lol). I did each section of the DVD on my first time through. That was a POWERFUL hour and it kicked my entire butt! (big work for sure.. hehe). I felt things I hadn't felt in a while and I work out regularly, so.. well done! This DVD is amazing and I LOVE it! Great job, SparkPeople and Coach Nicole! The combos of movements on this DVD are very unique, challenging, and fun! There is a tougher version and a modifier for almost each move as well so this is for every level of fitness!

Much of the DVD seems to be pilates/ballet inspired.. and I LOVE that!

The DVD consists of:
Warm Up ~ 4 minutes
Barre Body Blast ~ 20 minutes
Bodyweight Burn ~ 22 minutes
Sizzle Sculpt ~ 19 minutes
Cool Down ~ 4 minutes

The warm up has an awesome and very original. There's a squat knee combo that I LOVE!

My favorite section was the Sizzle Sculpt. It really worked every part of my body, was unique, and very fun. Just awesome!

There are also sample workout mixes available on the start menu that you can choose that will mix and match segments. Awesome!

The only thing I wish was different was more direction such as ""we will start with the left arm in 3...2..."" Sometimes she is not specific, other times she is super specific. My second time through, I didn't even notice though, so.. that isn't a true problem for me! :D

AMAZING DVD. My favorite one from Coach Nicole so far!

*side note* I received this DVD for free from SparkPeople but did not receive any form of payment for my review.",1357516800,18,1580,4.3141891891891895
5256738,5,B0093URN8K,"This DVD is great. I love Coach Nicole's style, and I love that all three ladies on this video actually seem like ""real"" people. :)
The workouts are great and easy to modify up or down to get the level that you need. There's also a workout plan included for beginners, intermediate, and advanced exercisers, so you can use this DVD for a long time and still get results. I highly recommend this DVD!

I also highly recommend Coach Nicole's 28 Day Bootcamp! Get them both!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SparkPeople-28-Day-Boot-Camp/dp/B005NGKJW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SparkPeople: 28 Day Boot Camp</a>",1357257600,6,650,5.989247311827957
5256739,5,B0093URN8K,"I completed all 3 workouts on this dvd. Of the three workouts, Bodyweight Burn, Barre Body and Sizzle Sculpt, the Barre Body is my favorite.  As a child I took ballet and this workout brought back a few memories. Enjoyed this one very much. The pace and fluid movement was nice and controlled. Due to an injury, I kept it low to no impact, yet the workout was very effective. I also limited or did not use weights, although, it is just as effective without weights. Like the previous dvd from Sparkpeople, The 28-day Bootcamp, I  enjoyed that all the moves can be modified to fit ones physical limitations or needs.

There are three workout levels, Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.  The more your progress, the more time you spend working out.  But even for the time-crunched individual, you can amp up the basic level by following the advanced moves in that workout and still receive an effective workout.

This is a great addition to my Leslie walks.",1354924800,56,956,4.6946107784431135

8535449,5,B0093URN8K,I just completed the entire DVD and it was a great doable program. I exercise at a fitness center an average of 5 times a week and am fast approaching the big 70. I wanted a DVD that I could do at home that wasn't above my ability but still challenged me and I found it in this DVD. Love that it has some balance exercises as I have found that I really need to work on balance as I age. Also liked the barre portion. Actually liked the whole thing and I was impressed with the coach. As much as I already workout I can tell this program hits some areas that I am not getting at the fitness center classes. I expected some muscle soreness tomorrow.,1491004800,3,647,4.0625
