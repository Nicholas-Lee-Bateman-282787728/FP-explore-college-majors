1221044,3,B00000ICDJ,I bought this in the hope of a good video of my favourite Donizetti-opera. And Sutherland was famous for ANYTHING belcanto... But here she's too old and it was too late. She's transposing and slowing down the madscene... Something she has never done before... A gorgeous production with a strong cast except for Sutherland...,1073865600,2,325,5.037037037037037
1221045,4,B00000ICDJ,"I think this a very authentic production of the opera, from staging to customes. A delight for opera purists.
For the casting, Joan is still amazing at her age. It is true that she does not possess the stamina at the end of the opera (listen to her last note and compare with her Decca CD recording), but in average, this is still Joan's typical great performance. James Morris handles his role brilliantly, and acts as if he were a king ^_^. I think the tenor Michael Myers' timbre is a bit too dark for my taste, but his overall vocal and acting skills are still admirable nonetheless. Other smaller roles are mostly very capable, including Ben Heppner taking up Hervey.
A minor criticism is that, in the year 1984, they are still recoring in mono! I do not understand this, and this may scare away some audiophiles. By setting up my surround sound system, I manage to get a more spatial sound stage. And after about 3 minutes after the overture, I totally forget about this audio deficiency since it is really an enjoyable opera performance.",1034208000,,1044,4.588235294117647
1221046,3,B00000ICDJ,"This is a very lonnnngggg opera and Joan should have passed on Anna as she didn't have the stamina nor the voice to pull it off.  Having heard her in the earlier years, this is almost embarrassing to witness her decline vocally.  I bought it based on the customer reviews of the supporting cast and production.  Found the customer reviews very accurate in my opinion.  I loved the costumes and the sets were just perfect as well.  Joan's hubby did a commendable job in the pit with a responsive orchestra.  The star turn was James Morris' Henry the VIII!  Wow! Forst was fine and Heppner, though a tiny role, demonstrated that this was a voice with immense promise.  Don't believe there is another video available to rival this one.  The only other recommendation is Beverly Sills' CD for this opera.  Somehow, I had a difficult time avoiding boredom with this performance except for Morris.  Maybe repeated viewings will improve my opinion.  Ok if you can forgive Joan for growing old, losing her support and along with it her middle and low voice.  Her high notes pinched with a very wide vibrato. I just felt sorry for her - she was exhausted and it showed!",997833600,5,1160,4.627450980392157
1221047,5,B00000ICDJ,"This Anna Bolena recording does not have the best audio or visual quality that we really desire. However, it is an extremely important document and shows why Dame Joan was still ""La Stupenda"" at age close to 60 !It is ashame that the Met refused to mount this opera for Sutherland during her raving success around the world-a great lost for New Yorker! This is a must for any opera lover---------including fans of Dame Joan.",992736000,9,424,4.666666666666667
1221048,5,B00000ICDJ,"On May 22, 1984 Joan Sutherland gave her very first performance as Donizetti's Anna Bolena in Toronto.  Two performances later, on May 28, the performance was televised with the premiere cast and quite a premiere cast it was: James Morris as Henry VIII,  Judith Forst as Jane Seymour, Michael Myers as Percy and in the small role of Hervey, the as yet unknown Ben Heppner.  Pirate videos have been floating around for years of this performance but what a treat it is to see this mint copy looking as if it were being telecast today!  Sumptuous costumes and appropriately stern sets along with excellent camera work help the singers to bring their characters vividly to life.  Even though Sutherland was definitely in her later years, there is plenty of voice left to cope with the many vocal as well as dramatic challenges of this role.  It is also a great opportunity to see James Morris as Henry -- a role he rarely performed and never recorded.  The role offers no vocal  difficulties that Morris cannot master and he is visually the antithesis of the overweight letcher we expect Henry VIII to be.  Richard Bonynge conducts with sensitivity and style, bringing a ""rightness"" to this performance which many modern day bel canto performances rarely deliver.  As with VAI's Norma -- subtitles are permanent and not optional but this is a small drawback which can be easily overlooked and indeed a plus for those who are hearing this opera for the first time. This DVD comes highly recommended not only as an aural but a visual treat as well.  Many thanks to VAI for releasing its recent DVD's (Great Opera Stars on the Bell Telephone Hour and NORMA) -- keep them coming!",988329600,20,1671,4.727586206896552
1221049,5,B00000ICDJ,"This Anna Bolena originates from Toronto, Canada, 1985, and it has a spectacular Joan Sutherland for the title role, along with James Morris as Enrico, and Judith Forst as Giovanna. Bonynge conducts with wonderful Donizetti style(Italiainate), and the rest of the principles are excellent. Buy it and enjoy. A few cuts, but check out B Sills' recording for the complete(near?) of this fabulouis opera!",987465600,7,401,5.28125
1221050,3,B00000ICDJ,"If you want to hear and see what Joan Sutherland was really about, don't buy this Anna Bolena, she sounds old and tired. She was close to 60. If you  want to hear why La stupenda caused such a sensation during her operatic  reign as the Queen of bel canto, I would recommend the following VHS  tapes.

7910174,3,B00000ICDJ,"Sutherland is pure magic when it comes to vocalisation.  But acting was never her forte and she does more posturing than acting.  However, there's magic there and I like to play this when I am doing something else.  For those who don't mind her attempts at acting this would be a winner.",1401753600,,287,4.480769230769231
7910175,5,B00000ICDJ,"There are three definitive Annas: Callas, Sutherland, Sills, Of the three, only Sutherland was filmed in the role.  Thus, this DVD becomes a permanent testimonial to La Stupenda, as are all of her other DVD's.  She is, as usual, in formidable voice; and her stage presence is much improved, given her total immersion in the role.  Morris is in fine voice as Henry the 8th, and Forst proves her command of bel canto.  My only other DVD of this opera is with Nebretko, fine, but lacking the aura of mystique any performance by Dame Joan creates.",1400025600,,543,4.625
7910176,5,B00000ICDJ,"EXCELLENT Sutherland!  Rather than being 'slightly' past her vocal prime, as so many reviewers relish pointing out ... I would say this is from the stage of her career where she is ENUNCIATING clearly (something she did NOT do so well in the good old bad old days).

Unhesitatingly recommended, this is one of the best opera DVDs I've ever experienced, a true joy.  No eurotrash and no lip-synching here, just a great dramatic and musical stage experience.  Audio is recorded at a slightly lower than average level, so just turn the volume and bass up a little, sit back and enjoy :)",1397260800,,583,4.631067961165049
7910177,5,B00000ICDJ,"Though I was scepticle, I must agree with previous reviewers that after seeing/hearing this DVD of a favorite opera, ""Anna Bolena"", Ms Sutherland was still ""La Stupenda"". Yes there were transpositions and yes there were cuts but she has given us a great performance to enjoy and cherish. She was a big horsey woman who was never a beauty but that face can convey pathos, charm, innocent happiness and deep dispair. And the voice was still right on pitch, accurate on inflexion and nuance. WOW she was still in top form. We are truly fortunate to have this document to remember one of the truly great singers of this or any age. The production is lush and regal; quite worthy of Henry Tudor's court. And the Henry of James Morris is also worthy of that court. His is a headstrong, impetuious and very virile performance of a role that too often is unnoticed. His great Woton years were just begining and his voice and being truly became the part of Henry.
The opera itself is such a great achievement one cannot understand that after it ill-fated first performances in the 1830s (New Orleans 1839 the last) it was not done again until 1957 with Callas. In my opera books of the 1950s it's not even mentioned. Fortunately I was able to see Sills in a couple performances and she truly invaded the part. Both Sills and Sutherland were skilled interpreters of this gloriuous role and I hope to see many more performances of this beautiful opera.",1280448000,,1441,4.6328125
7910178,5,B00000ICDJ,"Gaetano Donizetti was a composer at full speed. Operas flowed one after the other, contained in your resume more than 70. The style has always remained, but when it came Belcanto, Donizetti dominated, was unbeatable. Anne Boleyn is one of the three operas he made about the Tudor queens. His last performance was given in 1881 in Livorno. Was forgotten, languishing in the archives until you get to a Greek or American talent, never to know her nationality. Maria Callas Anna Bolena unearths, with Giulietta Simionatto and direction of Luchino Visconti makes a memorable show at Scala in 1957. After her, the great dramatic sopranos realized the potential of opera, who does not want to be cheered by the final scene. Leyla Gencer, Beverly Sills, Renata Scotto, Joan Sutherland and Dimitra Theodossiou interpreted the complex character, over the decades.
  There are two commercial versions available on video. The earliest was recorded in Canada in 1984 with Joan Sutherland, James Morris and Judith Forst. Baton of Richard Bonynge and Ben Heppner in early career, playing the role of Hervey.
  Portrait of its time, this assembly is tradition squared. Costumes loaded, little or no scenic interpretation. Everyone Paradita, beautiful singing. Everything in its place, the light is a constant shadow. The direction is limited to tell a story, transcribes what is in the libretto faithfully and nothing more. The highlights for the voices, all the soloists are of feedback. Sutherland has great agility of a coloratura soprano, her timbre like, though his diction is weak. Baritone James Moris are legitimate, not those that currently exist, has those serious and bulky caracterticos full of singers of the past. Judith has Fosrt voice thick, enormous. The regency of my husband (of Sutherland) Boninger is classic, no innovations. The analog picture and sound are a little lacking for supporters of Blu-ray.
  Anna Boleyn of Bergamo, recording made in 2006, is the opposite of Canada. His direction is impeccable, not only transcribes the lyrics, but makes a theatrical release. Provokes the viewer calls for reflection. The scenario stands possess the background, always present with members of the choir. The director's reading is clear, the life of the royals is public, no private space. The soloists do not have the same level voice of the Canadian version is in hand, they act, give realism to persongens. The light is part of the scenery, the costumes are lightweight and digital recording leaves everything in line.
  Hear snakes and lizards Dimitra Theodossiou, but the soprano is based on Belcanto. Your voice can agility in difficult coloraturas, turns power and technique, but gets worn out in the end. The other soloists are guaranteed, all sing and act, that's modern opera.
  Both versions show the evolution of opera. From traditional to modern reading assembly. Basic scenario of a vision, a way of telling the story, a provocation. All aspects related to production have evolved. Settings, costumes, lighting, color, movement choir, recording, direction of scenes and so on. Won the opera, which advanced in time, seeking to renew its modernized public. Recordings of the century are thought to video. But not everything is perfect, the voices of the past were higher than the present.

Gaetano Donizetti era um compositor a toda velocidade. peras fluiam uma atrs da outra: constam em seu currculo mais de 70. O estlo sempre se mantinha, mas,  quando o assunto era belcanto, Donizetti dominava, era imbatvel. Anna Bolena  uma das trs peras  que ele fez sobre as rainhas Tudor. Sua ltima apresentao se dera em 1881,  em Livorno. Ficou esquecida, mofando nos arquivos, at que aparece uma grega ou americana talentosa, nunca sei a nacionalidade dela. Maria Callas desenterra Anna Bolena, juntamente com  Giulietta Simionatto e a direo de Luchino Visconti faz um espetculo memorvel no Scala,  em 1957. Depois dela, os grandes sopranos perceberam o potencial dramtico da pera, quem no quer ser aplaudido pela cena final. Leyla Gencer, Beverly Sills, Renata Scotto, Joan Sutherland e Dimitra Theodossiou interpretaram a complexa personagem, no decorrer das dcadas.
  Existem duas verses comerciais disponveis em vdeo. A mais antiga foi gravada no Canad,  em 1984, com Joan Sutherland, James Morris e Judith Forst. Regncia de Richard Bonynge e Ben Heppner em incio de carreira,  fazendo o papel de Hervey.
  Retrato de sua poca, essa montagem  tradio ao quadrado. Figurinos carregados, pouca ou quase nenhuma interpretao cnica. Todo mundo paradinho, cantando bonito. Tudo no seu devido lugar, a luz  uma penumbra constante. A direo se limita a contar uma histria, transcreve o que est no libreto com fidelidade e nada mais. O destaque fica para as vozes, todos os solistas so de gabarito. Sutherland tem agilidade de um grande soprano coloratura, seu timbre agrada, entretanto sua dico deixa a desejar. James Moris  bartono legtimo, no desses que existem atualmente, tem aqueles graves cheios e volumosos caracterticos dos cantores do passado. Judith Fosrt tem voz densa, enorme. A regncia do marido (da Sutherland) Boninge  clssica, sem inovaes. A imagem e o som analgicos deixam a desejar aos adeptos do blu-ray.
  A Anna Bolena de Bergamo, gravao realizada em 2006,   o oposto da canadense. Sua direo  impecvel, no transcreve apenas o libreto e sim faz uma verso teatral. Provoca o espectador, chama  reflexo. O cenrio possu arquibancadas ao fundo, sempre presentes com membros do coro. A leitura do diretor  clara, a vida dos membros da realeza  pblica, no existe espao privado. Os solistas no tm o mesmo nvel vocal da verso canadense: em contrapartida, atuam, do realismo aos persongens. A luz faz parte do cenrio, os figurinos so leves e  a gravao digital deixa tudo nos conformes.
  Ouvi cobras e lagartos de Dimitra Theodossiou, mas o soprano se sustenta no belcanto. Sua voz consegue a agilidade nas difceis coloraturas, despeja potncia e tcnica, mas chega desgastada no final. Os demais solistas se garantem, todos cantam e atuam , isso  pera moderna.
  As duas verses mostram a evoluo da pera. De montagem tradicional a leitura moderna. De encenao bsica a uma viso, uma forma de contar a histria, uma provocao. Todos os aspectos referentes a produo evoluram. Cenrios, figurinos, luz, cores, movimentao de coro, gravao, direo de cenas e etc. Ganhou a pera, que avanou no tempo, se modernizou buscando renovar seu pblico. Gravaes do sculo XXI so pensadas para o vdeo. Mas nem tudo  perfeito, as vozes de outrora eram superiores s atuais.",1275868800,3,6571,5.153628652214891
7910179,4,B00000ICDJ,"Dame Joan Sutherland first essayed the role of Anna Bolena in Canada 1984, of which this release captures.  Of all the female singers in any of these performances under review, Dame Joan's technique and vocal means is far and away the most superior - natch, she leaves the competition in the proverbial dust.  Here nearing sixty, La Stupenda's customary coloratura zip and ease of technique are as impressive as ever. Scalework is a snap, trills deftly incorporated, not to mention the fullness and ""largeness"" of her tone, and most importantly, the voice can move. Of course time has diminished her resources, but when those very solid resources are better than those of singers half her age, how can quibbles be summoned with any credibility?  To be sure, there are some concessions made, such as transposing or even changing a good deal of the score to give Sutherland a tessitura which will allow her to end on a confortable high note (all of which are Cs and Ds), but what is a Sutherland without a walloping concluding note to any aria or ensemble (and wallops she does - and stuns!)?

  But what impresses the viewer most is what an adept stage performer Sutherland proved herself to be.  She moves regally, wears her costumes well, and immerses herself to a degree of involvement in the dramatic situation; there is full awareness of the text as demonstrated by her actions and facial expressions.  In addition, Sutherland is a confident, dignified presence, and fully displays her sagacious means as a person of the stage.  This is a thoroughly competent, professional and efficient performance, not to be slighted in and of itself in any way.

  That said, my standing reservation about Sutherland still holds.  For all of the sterling qualities this vocal legend embodies, I yearn as always to hear a more developed musical imagination.  Unlike Callas, Sills and Gruberova in this role, Sutherland displays little individuality, ""vocal face"" or an indelibly original personality channeling through the character.  La Stupenda has the most prodigious inborn vocal means of any singer in her repertoire, but her often utilitarian use of it can leave one wanting for more.  Throughout, there is very scarce use of dynamics other than that of mezzo to mezzo-forte. One will hear in vain for a true half-tone, or much less, any dynamically limned, artful shading; one longs for a well-bound, flexibly drawn-out of a legato line, for any tapering, bending and ""lifting""of phrase-endings, or a magically sustained, diminished tone that floats.  Too, the lack of tonal coloristic variety (further made so by the ever present mushy vowels and lack of crispness in enunciation), giving a semblance of monotony, does not impart to the listener a wide range of emotions, not helped by the transposing of some parts of the score. Inevitably, one must accept the compromises of transposing an entire piece to accommodate those concluding high notes.  The glory of Dame Joan's voice was always in its upper third register; even in her prime, the rather inexpressive, hollow lower third was her least attractive feature, and transposing much of Anna's music accentuates what had by 1984 turned into a plum-in-the-mouth opaqueness of tone in that mittellage.  Nevertheless, Sutherland on her own terms is a formidable presence, and it is a bracing experience in itself to witness the still-considerable means so soundly projected as here.

  Judith Forst as Giovanna is a dedicated, wholly committed performer, with a warm, vibrant tone (sometimes growing pressed in its upper regions), and gives a most sympathetic portrayal.  She is particularly effective at displaying her growing agitation at both being Enrico's replacement wife, and betraying her closest friend.  Forst and Sutherland play off each other superbly in their big duet, with the former projecting a good deal of the requisite angst; both ladies end on a unison high C.

  James Morris is luxury casting as Enrico VIII, perhaps one of the best documented.  The bass-baritone, stunningly costumed, certainly looks the part: tall, big-framed and imposing, he has a voice to match, which is penetrating, flexible and surprisingly expressive.  Towering over the whole cast, Morris dominates - as he should - the proceedings as the lurking, edgy menace who propels his wife to her doom.  Michael Myers, much of his music cut, makes a fine Percy, singing and acting with conviction; Janet Stubb's boyish, nimbly sung Smeton makes a fine effect. It is amusing to see a young Ben Heppner, cast in the comprimario role of Percy.

  Richard Bonynge presides over the Canadian Opera Orchestra with the usual mix of felicities and drawbacks.  The coaching and accompanying of the singers, as always, remains without peer; unlike someone like Riccardo Muti, Bonynge knows how to let a singer breathe. On the other hand, Bonynge can short-circuit some of the excitement of the climaxes, particularly that of Act One (here turned into Act Two for this production). When Anna faces down her accusers, the tempo and pacing of the cabaletta ""Ah! segnata  la mia sorte"" and the resulting ensemble is disappointingly stodgy and lacking in headlong impetus - it ends the act ""neatly"", where it should be febrile and crackling with tension.  Furthermore, one must cope with the limited, mono sound which makes the orchestra appear a bit murky and lacking in contrasts of textures. The camerawork is excellent, though; reactions, and close-ups important moments are captured right on time.

  Visually, this production is a real pleasure to watch.  The sets and costumes are sumptuous, expensive and elaborate, marvelously detailed, with deep, rich hues giving a truly renaissance feel; the quality of the DVD's picture often imparts that of a ""movie-painting."" The lush blues and burgundies give the requisite somber feel to the proceedings.  Lotfi Mansouri's direction is purposeful, and, laudable for its intentions of going past the usual ""park-and-bark""approach in the bel canto realm.  Not only does Mansouri create beautiful stage tableaus, but the performers are blocked and made to enact their characters with some sense of direction and focus.

  The main caveat of this peformance is in its cuts - over a half hour's worth.  Granted, some internal trims are perhaps merited, but having Percy's ""Vivi tu"" sliced out altogether robs not only the overall impact of the score's structure, but also of denying the audience a chance to hear one of Donizetti's finest tunes.",1173484800,4,6517,5.128787878787879
7910180,3,B00000ICDJ,"I've only watched/listened to the 1st 2 acts and the 1st scene of the 3rd (because I can't use my DVD player right now), and after listening (dozens of times) to the glorious 1984 CD of this with Sutherland, Ramey and Hadley, I was expectiving, anticipating something absolutely wonderful.  But I was disappointed.  The duets and ensemble numbers in the 2 acts I have gotten to see/hear so far are really great.  But everything else makes me wonder which Donizetti wrote it.  Actually I think this was his first hit and his coloratura writing really improved with time.  Sutherland's voice was just fine, but there are more of her signature leaps at the ends of arias on the CDs than there are in this movie.  In fact, I suppose the lesser number in the flick is more customary, and she just showed off on the CDs, but I loved  it because I love her and love hearing her do it.  My only (ONLY) objection to this DVD (and why is it so different from the CDs???) is the music.  It is flat and bland.  It is dull.  There is very little in it I would call coloratura-style singing.  That of course turned out to be Donizetti's stock in trade, but there's very little in this to foreshadow what was to come.  The singers all did wonderful jobs.  The sets were skeletal.  The costumes lush.  Henry was skinny and Percy was plump.  (There's a switch in history!)  And whose stupid idea was it to pluck Henry's eyebrows and make him look like Mr. Spock without the ears?",1116806400,,1462,4.432330827067669
7910181,4,B00000ICDJ,"After obtaining a copy of Sutherland's DVD performance of Lucrezia Borgia (I gorgeous rendition-a must!) I just had to get this Anna Bolena. Of course there's a four year difference between performances, and I heard so many rumours and opinions regarding the decline in voice, and yes, inevitably you can notice the difference. But as far as I'm concerned she can still surprise today's singers who are in their prime. Her coloratura, runs, trills, everything...are still clean, tasteful, absolutely beautiful! Whats more, her Jane Seymour, Judith Frost, is fantastic, first in her scena duet with Henry, then with Anna Bolena herself in Act 3 scene 1. The costumes, sets great!

Now the disappointments-a simply miscast Henry-James Morris. He sounds as if he were choking in some of the emballishments. Yes, he can sing Wagner, I've heard him, but certainly NOT bel canto! Others in the cast are more than adequate. Also the sound is pathetic!!! I can understand if its mono sound but sometimes the voices are too far back, the orchestra sounds muchy in places. I disappointment after the top quality of Lucrezia Borgia.

Still, a DVD I would not want to be without!!!

Bravo!",1111968000,5,1177,4.994897959183674
7910182,4,B00000ICDJ,"In a perfect world, there would have been a video ""Anna Bolena"" with Maria Callas, but with that out of the question, I find this Sutherland version quite good.  True --- her voice is not what it would have been ten years earlier ------ but it's still an impressive instrument quite capable of commanding the role.  Secondly, she sounds considerably better here than she does on the London studio recording of 1987 (recorded three years after this performance).  The supporting cast here is excellent, the orchestra plays well for Bonynge, and the picture is pretty good. I'm a great Callas admirer, but I truly find Sutherland's contribution to the art of bel canto to be as basic and fundamental as was Callas'.  This is an excellent ""Anna Bolena"" , and if there are those who have a problem with Sutherland's downward transposition of the final scene by a whole step, they should simply give this performance a pass.  Personally, I'm glad that Sutherland took this role into her repertoire, even at this  late stage of her career.  Is there any soprano out there today who could duplicate her accomplishment?  If so, where are they??",1108512000,13,1136,4.819587628865979
