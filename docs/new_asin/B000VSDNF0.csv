2947171,2,B000VSDNF0,"Very low budget J-horror. I usually prefer smaller movies with good stories instead of fancy effects with bad stories. But in my opinion this was not much of a story, nor was it acted/directed well.

IMDB doesn't even have a page for it. I tried searching by director (Takaaki Ezura) and the lead actors (Hikaru Kawamura, Mikio Sato) to no avail.

My time would have been much better spent rewatching Cure, A Tale of Two Sisters, Spider Forrest etc.",1229299200,,449,4.670886075949367
2947172,4,B000VSDNF0,"This is a notice for all buyers that the film being sold here is a Japanese film, not an American film of the same name. The cover is of the Japanese horror film. The descriptions are mixed up-the cast is listed as all American names but yet the description shows that the film is in Japanese-and the time, date of release and studio all match the Japanese film of the same name.
Here is the description off the back cover:
""Following her father's death, Mirai moves into a house with her uncle and his wife but finds herself lost and confused as she begins to have horrible visions. Mysteriously people around her begin dying one by one and Mirai sets off on a desperate search into her past in an attempt to find the murderer. The past uncovers a mystery that is linked to a startling family secret.""
OK, I watched this film and it starts off like it was a made-for-TV movie, and by that I only mean the lighting is different-it has that television show quality. The story starts off a bit disjointed but picks up when Miria starts having these visions and friends get killed off. As she investigates (with help from a cute friend that has more than a friendly interest in her), she digs deeper and deeper into a mystery that could get her killed trying to solve it. It has some good plot twists and the ending isn't predictable, so it is fresh enough that fans of Asian horror will likely be satisfied. I gave it four stars because there is always room for improvement.",1210291200,7,1472,4.435424354243542

2947204,1,B000VSDNF0,"Plenty of beautifully composed shots.  Thats all the movie has going for it.  If you like to study how things are composed, watch this movie, because each of those beautifully composed shots will last several minutes each.  You will have plenty of time to contemplate and discuss how each scene was filmed because literally NOTHING else will be happening for those several minutes.

No one else will enjoy this movie.  There is nothing here for the rest of us to enjoy - nothing fun, nothing interesting, nothing insightful.  The plot is minimal.  The soundtrack is overbearing and pretentious. Its mostly made up of long interludes of 'trick' cinematography.  Each of those interludes lasts several minutes - even though you'll only want to watch each one for a few seconds.

2947206,5,B000VSDNF0,"The opening scenes were disorienting.  I kept thinking maybe I was watching the snippets of a movie that sometimes loop before you hit the play button.  Then, suddenly a more standard scene began:  A wedding at a manor in the countryside.  The remote setting harkens back to the 1800s except there's a golf course instead of hunting grounds.  Kirsten Dunst is the giddy bride whose behavior keeps going off kilter.  There's brief discussion of an astronomical event related to the planet Melancholia then the bizarre wedding scene continues.  By the end of the first act, Dunst/Justine has become completely uninhibited, violating all norms and decorum.

Act two begins with the longsuffering sister, Claire, coaxing Justine back to the manor as if dealing with a small child.  Justine's recklessness has deteriorated into a deep depression.  It's days after the wedding and the main event is planet Melancholia passing by Earth.  Only the two sisters along with Claire's husband and son reside in the house now.  Claire's mood levels out though she's bleak.  And odd events recurrence indicates some supernatural or symbolic meaning.  By the end the significance is clear enough, a fairly powerful statement.

Beware though, the intricate symbolism might compel you to start researching the things alluded to throughout the film just in case you missed something important.",1516838400,3,1374,5.238532110091743

This is NOT an action movie, hence all of the negative reviews.  It is NOT the typical ""we have to stop this disaster"" film.  The slowness of which many complain is the necessary unfolding of complex situations and emotions.

It seems to me this movie even pokes at the dumbed-down joke that Hollywood has become, and I admit, I was impressed by the way it provoked my expectations only to smack me in the face repeatedly with unrepentant hours of story-line legitimacy.
I'm convinced that Lars von Trier sees a swath of reality and human nature that go conveniently ignored by the majority, and Im LOVING the artful way he holds that reality mirror up for all to see in a world ruled by reckless souls, honestly, it's a wonder we're ALL not dooms-day depressed.

2947282,4,B000VSDNF0,"Some compare this film to Terence Malick's  Tree of Life.  Here's my comparison - one of these films is overrated tedious pretentious twaddle and the other is a stylish wonder directed by Lars von Trier.

In Part 1 of the Trier one, Melancholia, a handsome couple, Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and Michael (Alexander Skarsgard) arrive at their wedding reception in a weird Maxfield Parrish twilight.  Everything is beautiful in the castle guesthouse, but the newlyweds are two hours late and a whiff of despair accompanies them.  We don't know why. The bride's sister Claire (a careworn Charlotte Gainsbourg) is exasperated but not surprised. Claire's husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) is beyond exasperated and wants to be sure that Justine knows how much this wedding is costing him; Claire and John own and operate the guesthouse. The bride is alternately smiling delightedly and morosely detached.  We learn that she has promised Claire that she will not make a scene on this night. Justine suffers from melancholia, in the medical sense of a deep and persistent soul-eating misery.  The night does not go well.  Justine's rakish father (a spoon-stealing John Hurt) stolidly avoids the heart-to-heart his daughter wants.  Her mother (a sour Charlotte Rampling) loudly deplores marriage and tells Justine to get out while she can.  Kind, unsuspecting Michael is way out of his depth.  Justine's ghastly boss (Stellan Skarsgard) and his newly-employed nephew Tim (Brady Corbet) - well, the less said the better.  In short, the marriage doesn't take.  Justine sleepwalks, alienates and insults her way right out of it, just as mummy suggested.  It's a night that everyone will remember - for the rest of their lives.

Some time later Justine, now virtually catatonic, goes to stay with Claire,  John  and their son Leo (Cameron Spurr) in the same guest house - although there are no guests.  The red star Arcturus, which Justine noted on her wedding night, (one such sighting heart-swellingly coinciding with a crescendo in Wagner's ""Tristan and Isolde"") has disappeared behind a planet called Melancholia, which in its turn has been ""hiding"" behind the sun and is now approaching the Earth.  Scientists are divided - Melancholia will fly by the Earth or it will collide with it. One or the other. But that ""hiding"" suggests motive and malice.  We know from the wonderful opening sequence of slow-motion shots of birds falling, lightning, Justine dragging muddy grey snares and planets colliding, that this will be no fly-by. We later recognise  these Peter Greenaway-like moments of surreal heaviness and profundity as perhaps the experience of those who inhabit the infinitesimal and eternal, liminal space of the final moments when the laws of physics of this planet are blown to pieces.

The three adults and Leo are strangely isolated - no phones ring, there is no television or radio, the internet is rarely used, no helicopters fly over, no ravening hordes of final-dayers or doomsday preppers climb over the fence.  When Justine twice tries to ride her horse across the bridge to the village he baulks and will not cross, nor can Claire cross in the golf buggy.  We are told that a character whom we know to be dead has ""gone into the village"".  Where is this mansion on a bay with an eighteen (sometimes nineteen) hole golf-course and formal garden?  Some of the characters have English accents, some American, some Scandanavian.  But it's the end of days.  We are nowhere.

John, all bluff optimism, reassures Claire that they are in no danger. Justine, reminiscent of another enigmatic, doomed, blonde beauty, Miranda, ""knows things"".  Like the girls on Hanging Rock - Claire, Leo and Justine spend much of their time sleeping.  John watches the skies with his telescope.  Melancholia approaches and recedes. Then approaches. ""There's your fly-by"" Justine says nastily. Justine is a nihilist, certain that life is ""evil"", ""'life is only on earth and not for long"".  She awaits the end with a cold, bitter fury. The last scene - one of the best movie endings of all time - emblematises her incandescent rage, in all its tragic glory.

Certainly Melancholia is not flawless - Trier's symbolism is not subtle (yes, lily of the valley is creepy); the wedding scene is too long; why is John paying for the wedding?; Kirsten takes her clothes off a bit too much; the ""surprise"" death of a major character is not plausible and is flagged with blinking neon lights; we wonder how Justine could ever have succeeded in advertising; Leo is there simply to provide ""a child"" for the end of the world scenario - he's curiously characterless and listless. Critics witter on about whether the two parts of the film (Justine / Claire) represent imagination/reality, or capitalism/religion v science, or internal destruction/external obliteration, or male reason/female feeling, or the fruitlessness of human activity/the magnificent indifference of the cosmos, and I too could witter on about these things.  But to get bogged down in these muddy grey snares is to try to make the film more than it is, or needs to be.",1487203200,5,5107,5.039285714285715

2947301,5,B000VSDNF0,"After reading other reviews of this movie, it's difficult to know how to react.  I get no joy from bashing others for anything except who they voted for in the last election, so I will say just that clearly, we all seem to agree that this movie definitely does appeal to a certain demographic, and definitely does not appeal to a certain other demographic.  I come at this from a fairly unique perspective: I'm an astrologer (not by profession because it just does not call me to get paid for it, but I could get paid for it.).  I am also a highly-sensitive person, which is a) a real thing (you'll find books on it right here on Amazon) and b) not a disorder and c) while this type of person is predisposed to depression more than someone who isn't an HSP, depression does not necessarily go hand in hand with it.  So NO, you do not have to have experience with depression to enjoy this movie as some have said  thats RIDICULOUS.  You just have to be a bit on the deep and existential end of the psychological and philosophical continuum.

Anyway, perhaps my astrology knowledge and the spiritual views this has created in me lets me see these scenes differently from most.  This is a movie about how knowing the certain end is ahead of you affects the psyches of the people involved and how they deal with the impending end of everything and everyone.  It does not matter that these characters are rich, and that alone should not exclude treating them like people in your minds (again, reflecting other reviews I read).  I think they're wealthy with everything we value on Earth going for them in order to illustrate that when the ending comes, it comes for all, and at the time of the total destruction of the planet, nobody will be saved by how much money they have.  Yes, Kirsten Dunst's character is deeply depressed, but it's being rather pedestrian to not see the reason.  She is aware because she has heightened sensitivity that causes her to feel this planet -- she has something of a kinship with it -- that it is coming to destroy everything.  The scene in which she basks naked under its glow is meant to reflect her energetic resonance with it.  Shes comfortable, even ecstatic, under its influence.  Think of what you might do under the sun and why if nobody was watching, and that might accurately reflect why she is lying naked on rocks basking in the glow of Melancholia. It's not random and it was not just an excuse to get a nude shot of Dunst into the movie. Because Mel is coming to destroy everything, nothing in her life that she's held as meaningful is meaningful anymore.  She's has episodic, existential depression in the beginning, and by the way, good luck not having any yourselves if this situation were to happen in real life.  She had an important, prestigious job but worked for an appalling man for whom she had no respect, and like so many of us, had to put on a lot of masks to make that work.  She's gotten married to a cute guy whom she cares about but this marriage too was probably a choice made to please others (Alexander Skarsgard plays her fiance/husband of ten seconds.  ""True Blood"" fans will know as ""Eric,"" the Viking vampire). With no future ahead of them, it has no MEANING; she's going through with the party because her brother-in-law (Sutherland) paid for it (he doesn't let anyone forget this for a second) and can't get his money back.  All the masks come off, the wall of illusion crashes, because there simply is no REASON to maintain them anymore. At the wedding reception, which is about to happen as the film opens, everyone is aware that this planet is headed toward Earth, but not everyone is of the same mind as to whether or not it will make impact or pass close by, especially Dunst's wealthy scientist brother-in-law who has his own special brand of denial going happening.  By the end of the movie, everyone has dealt with it in a way that makes sense for who they are.

I can take up more space talking about how beautifully shot this was, but thats been said.  I cant see anyone who thinks deeply and sees life for what it is not appreciating this film, and if thats not you, thats fine, just be a student of life and the world at least enough to not say things like Maybe its for you if you have experience with depression.  Its just an incredibly shallow view of life and other people.  It's not for people with major depressive disorder only because YOU don't get it, you just don't get it.",1480464000,4,4463,4.480246913580247

Then the first half is all one night- the wedding reception of a woman with depression. It doesn't delve into any character enough for you to get attached or care about them. It goes on for just over an hour before they even mention this planet that is supposed to do a fly-by of earth. There is no explanation of any science (how has no one known about this planet before, etc). The second part is labeled with the bride's sister's name, but it barely tells you anything about her, other than she's scared about the planet and reads webpages that predict doom. And of course, the planet crashes into earth in the final scene, and that's that.
I don't know that I've seen any von Trier movies before. I don't hate the ""artsy"" flicks, but this really couldn't hold my attention.

Part sci-fi, part psychological, the film had me wondering how things would turn out the entire movie until the ending when the conclusion became apparent.

2947362,4,B000VSDNF0,"I can understand why some may talk negatively about this film. This is my first Lars von Trier film but I know most of his work tends to be critical of humanity. Some reviews may point out its incredibly slow pacing and I can see what they mean. However, I believe the pacing was meant to be slow in order to exemplify the feeling of depression gradually creeping up on you. Even if this was Lars's true intention, I do think it could have been trimmed down in a way that it's not too slow.

Second of all, this film gets very abstract at times. While some may call this being self-indulgent or even pretentious, I consider it necessary in order to provide more meaning in its overall theme and message (that's as long as it contributes to it). And I gotta say, a lot of this film was very beautifully shot. However, I will say some of the camera work was really lazy at times with the image going out of focus a little too often. There was one shot where I was sure that I saw the shadow of the camera operator. But overall, the composition of the shots are very well made, especially the opening sequence. The opening sequence was probably one of my favorite parts of the movie.

Overall, I'd say give this film a shot. Despite some of my personal gripes with it, it tells a really interesting story that portrays depression from a unique perspective along with a very impressive performance from Kirsten Dunst.",1477094400,,1413,4.430769230769231

2947487,5,B000VSDNF0,"After a lengthy and beautiful scenic overture filmed to music from Wagner's Tristan and Isolde, the movie itself begins with Kirsten Dunst as newlywed Justine, happy and chipper, in the stretch limo she requested, trying to navigate turns too tight for it. This is the first indication we have that she's going to destroy life and marriage, and her success excites her. The first lengthy story in Melancholia is, in fact, Justine's methodical demolition of the carefully-planned celebration that her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) has crafted and Claire's husband (Kiefer Sutherland) has paid for. As the story develops, Justine travels deeper into her own personal, inescapable melancholia, consuming what should have been one of the great pinnacles of her life. Depression here, the catastrophe of self-destruction, is as difficult to watch as it is to experience.

*** Here be Spoilers ***

If, as one reviewer said, Justine is a play on Artemis, then John Hurt is excellent as her philandering Zeus father, distant and unreachable; while Charlotte Rampling's Hera is bitter and scolding, mocking the celebration (as we do, and the movie itself does) as ludicrous.

Or, Justine is the witch Isolde portended in the Wagner; using craft and potions and wiles to make her way through men. If Claire binds in love, then Justine complements her in death. All we're lacking is Jessye Norman.

The movie's central device is the planet Melancholia, which makes a brief appearance in the first part, then dominates in the second as it appears to be on a collision course with the Earth.

The second half of the movie belongs to Claire, the patient obsessive-compulsive wife-mother-sister who copes with her sister's clinical depression while trying to contain her dread at the coming calamity. Sutherland's dinner toast ""to life"" brings home Justine's Cassandra-like proclamation that, indeed, Earth is life, and of the universe, all the life therein. All of the terror centers in Claire as the planet Melancholia swings past in its near-miss in the middle of the night, while Justine is incapable of bringing herself to care either way. The next morning is bright and cheerful but underscored by the moodiness of her husband, and her renewed terror on discovering that Melancholia is circling back to strike its fatal blow at Earth.

The final scene as the three create a magical cave and sit, holding hands, is a creation of immense beauty.

The acting is superb. Gainsbourg's terror is palpable; Dunst's progressive misery, inescapable. Photography is a bit too shaky for my liking, but it uses that to become intensely intimate. Melancholia itself is awesome.",1475366400,7,2663,5.164733178654292

2947660,4,B000VSDNF0,"This 2011 movie ""Melancholia"" opens with Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and Michael (Alexander Skarsgard) celebrating their wedding at an expensive-looking party and it is instantly falling apart at the home of her sister (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and brother-in-law (Keifer Southerland).  Meanwhile, a planet called, Melancholia, is on a collision course towards earth... Melancholia is reported to be a psychological disaster movie from the Director Lars von Trier.  This is a movie about the end of the world!  I actually liked the movie...there's lots of drama, there is mystery, there is suspense, there is science fiction and fantasy.

2947665,5,B000VSDNF0,"One of my favorite sci-fi films. This is not your run-of-the-mill science fiction flick. It shows what a good director can do with a good story and a stellar cast. The sense of impending doom is almost palpable anand the main characters handle it in different ways. I find the relationship between Kirsten Dunst's character and the rogue planet to be a very complex one that brings out her sixth sense and her psychotic best. The simple but masterful effects depicting the collision of Melancholia with Earth are a fitting ending to a film filled wth subtelty.

It does establish Justine's erratic behavior and her large range of dysfunctional relationships. It tells us why Justine is used to expecting only the worst in life. But I personally think that the remaining chapters are sufficient to get to know her character. The acting is really superb across the board.
One caveat: please don't be one of those insufferable nerds who waste breath and space picking on the peculiar astronomical physics presented in this film. The behavior of the planet Melancholia is ridiculous from a scientific standpoint, granted. It is not meant to be realistic, but it is a metaphor that drives the dramatic elements of the story.

The story very slowly unfolds, giving you a lot of time to think about all of the different relationship issues within the cast, as it tells the story of a manic depressive and her struggle to ""fit in"" and be happy like everyone else, but the twist is that no one in her life is truly happy and she sees right through everyone. In the middle of this an impending doom sets on the world and you really get to see the true selves in everyone come out. Bottom line: genius. As for the negative reviews, all I can say is most people watch a movie to veg out and not think and just be entertained.

Rather than give a synopsis, which every other review does here, I'll tell you the problems I have with the movie.  Please note there are SPOILERS!:......

1.  How did John die?  Was he murdered, kicked by a horse, or did he kill himself knowing about the impending doom?
2.  How was nobody in the wedding party aware of potential appocolyptic even that loomed in just a few short days?  This would be major headline news that people would be aware of before the power went out.
3.  The film's synopsis on Amazon seemed to imply that the planets coming extremely close would induce chaos.  However, aside from Kirsten Dunst's strange behavior, I don't see anything out of place other than a family and associates that do not get along too well.
4.  When a movie is done well, you feel empathy for the other characters, and sometimes you can even imagine yourself in their own shoes and feel fear.  I felt nothing even close to that.
5.  I am not an astronomer, but I know that it's not possible for another planet to intersect with earth's orbit. There are no star systems close enough for this to happen.  Even if we could not see it, it would be detected by the light it blocks from other stars and the gravitational effects of other bodies around it.  Therefore, the entire premise of the film is just absurd.

You can see that the reviews are all over the place.  You may be one of the people who gains something from taking in this film.  So don't discount it just because I didn't like it.  Read some of the positive reviews and see if it's something you may enjoy.",1473033600,,1724,4.436305732484076

I believe that the first part of the movie was a look into Kirsten's character's very deluded view of the world brought on by a mental breakdown; possibly caused by her ""knowing"" what was going to happen.  The second half was the real-world view of what was really happening through the eyes of her sister.  And then there is the role reversal / hysteria reversal of the sisters as the planets move into position to collide.  A bit slow, but a cool movie with a really wierd prelude.

2948130,3,B000VSDNF0,"Let's face it!
It's an ART MOVIE!
And art movies are not for everyone, someone's opinion about them is too personal.
I can't tell you ITS THE BEST MOVIE EVER.  I can't tell you ITS A BAD MOVIE, because it's art. We all have different reactions to art. We can stare at the same pairing for the same amount of time and one can be moved to tears and the other sick to their stomach.
It's a personal relationship.
So before you press play know that it is an art movie. You may love it, or you may hate it fiercely. I'm pretty sure both reactions will please the director.

I'm not an art movie buff. I also had no previous knowledge of this director. I only watched it because it kept popping up on my Amazon video app and i just hoped that by watching it it would disappear from there lol

As soon as it starts you realize that it's an art movie. The opening is quite beautifully shot, the music it's intense. If by the first minutes you don't quite get that it is going to be a somewhat different movie from what you are used to, you won't like it.

I personally have mixed feelings about it.
It kept me intrigued to the End but I can't  really say I like it.
There were way too many moments, in my opinion, that made me think ""this makes no sense at all"" and to be completely honest with you it felt like the loooongest 2 hours of my life. I seriously thought it was longer than 2 hours.

I guess art doesn't necessarily need to make sense to everyone. I guess whatever the director's backstory and experiences were that made him make this movie also don't matter much if you are going to call it art.
But for anyone who isn't used to this kind of movie you may not be able to get over the fact that a LOT OF THINGS DONT MAKE SENSE.

There were quite a few scenes that were there just because it was pretty and artsy. For example, showing Kirsten dusts's nipples by the light of a planet on its course to crash into earth....!such a beautifully shot scene. Very artsy indeed. But in the back of my mind I just couldn't get passed the fact that it didn't quite fit in the story and it just seemed like an excuse to put a scene with naked Kirsten in it. .

A lot of other things didn't make sense to me but I can't mention them all without spoiling the whole movie to whomever is reading this

I'm also sure that anyone who has experienced depression directly or indirectly (through family members) can relate to this movie in a deeper level.

Bottom line is I DONT recommend this movie unless you are a fan of the director and of movies like this. Then I am sure you are in for a treat! It is beautiful!

If you have an eclectic movie taste and is curious like me, this is definitely an interesting movie to watch. Liking it or not I'm sure you will be glad you experienced it.
but above all don't listen to reviews that say ""it's an awesome movie"" or ""it's a bad movie"", because this is the kind of movie that will have a different feel for everyone who watches it.",1472774400,12,2964,4.164335664335664

I have to applaud the writer, director and all the fine actors in this film for the excellent light they have shown on our viewpoint of mental illness as perhaps, not an illness at all, but a limited yet valid state of consciousness that the masses have not acknowledged.  There was a time not too long ago that those who suffered from depression, i.e. melancholia, were locked away in institutions.  Now, there is the prison of drugs.  To 'know' things that cannot be seen is a gift, and a burden, and this movie is amazingly creative in depicting the depths of the ignorance of modern society.

2948181,1,B000VSDNF0,"This movie is like one of those international flights that feels like it just won't end.  Except that in this story, the full length ""in-flight movie"" is about a planet that ultimately crashes into a mirror image of itself.

If the characters had been likable, then at least one would have a sense of loss at the end.  Instead, the rather unspectacular coup de grace cannot come soon enough.

Even if a metaphor of the two sister planets, not even a glimpse of Kirsten Dunst's bare bosom can compensate for the continual torture that is watching dysfunctional rich people argue about the minutia of their lives.  Perhaps one has to be clinically depressed to identify with any of the characters.  I just don't get it.

Watching this ""movie"" makes one feel as though you are being forced to page through a million spectacular, yet disconnected still pictures.

Trier did not do the camera work as he usually does because he felt unable at the time.  He had gone through a long period of anxiety and depression, a long history of alcohol and different drugs as self medication.  The story he wrote is genius.

wedding reception at the home of sister 'Clair' (Charlotte Gainsboroug) and husband John's' (Kiefer Sutherland) home.
A lavish affair that is dampened by 'Justine's' apparent dis-interest in the expensive cellabration put together on her behalf.
Meanwhile the planet 'Melancholia' which has broken away from it's distant orbit is growing larger in the sky.
The second part is 'CLAIR' which tells the tale of the fall out following sister 'Justine's' wedding cellabration and husband's 'John's' fascination with the ever larger planet in the sky assuring his wife that the two planets will not collide.
Must admit this was one of the strangest films i've seen for for a long time, for me it shouldn't have worked, however the truth is i was totally pulled in....................strangely worth a spin.",1440288000,,934,5.3175675675675675
2948358,4,B000VSDNF0,"Dont believe the title. There is no melancholia in this woman on the front page. Dont believe the Ophelia looking front page with Justine floating in water in her wedding dress holding lily-in-the-valley, a whole bunch of them. There is no Ophelia, no suicide by drowning and no flowers floating on top of the water. Justine is not going to go to a nunnery, the nunnery of the dead, at least not what Hamlet and Shakespeare had in mind.

You will discover as soon as you get into the film beyond the title page that we are dealing with the end of the world set in parallel with the end of celibacy for Justine. She cannot accept her personal perspective because of what has been announced and is coming: the planet Melancholia is going to ram into the Earth. There cannot be any enjoyment while it lasts because lasting should mean there is no end decreed even before it starts, and obviously there is an imminent announced foreseen end.

So the little (though super rich, but the richer the more little) people at that wedding reveal how little they can be while they are forgetting it is one of their very last days.

The mother is obnoxious and ridiculously anti-marriage and anti-husband, particularly hostile to her ex-husband that refused to be dominated into silence.

The father is secretive, more than strange and absolutely selfish meaning he is not able to think beyond his own mental limits and they are quite narrow.

The sister Claire is the only sane person and yet she will yield to insanity when the end is coming. Sane people are only behaving like sane people, as sane people, but as soon as conditions get insane they are also getting insane because they are just copying what is normal at any time in their society. And yet at the last minute just before Melancholia crashes into the Earth she will get back to some sane peace and quiet, thanks to her own sister, Aunt Steelbreaker.

Claires husband, John, is entirely preaching what he knows is not true. He knows there is a margin of error in any calculation and that his own calculations that make Melancholia fly by have a fair chance to be wrong especially since everyone else or nearly says it will crash into the Earth. Actually he is a coward who will see before others the imminent ending and will steal his own wifes poison to leave life before the meeting of the two planets.

Justines newly-wed husband Michael is just a non-entity who loves, in fact desires, Justine and leaves her as soon as he understands she is beyond domination. For him love is submission both ways except that the husband only submits for his own pleasure and enjoyment. And he has little more to say.

I won't say anything about Justines boss: he is the biggest business non-imaginative non-entity that I hope you will never have to come across in life and after life.

So we are back with Justine, depressed by what is coming, always depressed because of a domineering and vain mother who hated anyone but herself and deserted her daughters to only come back once in a while to insult them. She is also depressed because of the evanescent and always absent father who cannot even find five minutes to have a personal word with his daughter on her wedding day. And she is the creative one who will be able to invent some fable about a magic cave that will create peace and bring quiet to her nephew Leo, her sister Claire and herself for the last fifteen minutes of their life.

We are back with Claire who is the sound and safe one in life but also the realist in danger and in a crisis, which makes her buy some poison before the end if it has to come to an end. Like all these people who have their feet well anchored in and not on the earth she is not able to face a real existential crisis in her own life but she is the best empathetic help anyone can find in their own existential crises. And when the end comes it is the sound sister that needs the help of the depressive one.

And we have Leo, Claires son and Justines nephew. He is a child, innocent and gullible, afraid of nothing because he has never seen death and suffering and torturing and cruelty face to face, one on one,  in personal confrontation. When such an event comes he is curious to see it and he believes the soft and smoothening tale of his aunt, Aunt Steelbreaker, who makes him build the skeleton of an Indian Tepee and makes him accept this is a magic cave in which no danger can reach him or anyone with him and he closes his eyes and finds the peace necessary to reach the end of the road without the slightest jolt. He is hypnotized in a way, one of Mars von  Triers favorite device.

When I have said that I have said nothing about the meaning of the film. I have simply repeated, summarize, given a gloss of the factual surface of the film, nothing but spoilers. But what is the meaning?

Here we come across Lars von Trier who has forgotten his provocative and absurd dictum and pronunciamento in his Vow of Chastity that was nothing but a dogmatic fundamentalistic Dogma 95. Everything in this film is fake, unreal, artificial, using all sorts of artifices and special effects including the special effects of the story itself that is supposed to blind the audience and make them believe we are dealing with normal though completely berserk people but berserk because the circumstances are exceptional. And what is so exceptional in it?

In 2011 when the world was falling head first in the worst financial crisis since 1929 (that brought Hitler and the Nazis Lars Von Trier loves-hates so much), when the first signs of the debt crisis in Europe were appearing, when the leadership of the USA was at stake everywhere in the world from China to Iraq with the economic defeat in front of the BRICS and with the military defeat in the Middle East, when nothing was improving and everything was getting worse, he came up with the fable of a cosmic end to the Earth and humanity. To make sure we get the message he does not even look at this cosmic destruction from the point of view of more than four people, first by wrapping up some gathering of the super rich in a wedding party that is a total failure but we can always enjoy the wedding cake and forget about the cosmic end coming soon. And then when we cannot avoid that moment we are locked up in a group of four people, cut from the rest of the world with no telephone, no electricity, no means of communication, no servant even, nothing, all alone.

A crisis of that type cannot in our world be experienced like that. It would necessarily be experienced as a collective drama, a collective panic, a collective epiphany, maybe even a collective salvation. But there is no reference to the billions of people on the Earth, no reference to any ideology, be it religious or non-religious, philosophical or secular, artistic even or poetic, with hardly ten seconds on Google or some Bling like that for some opportunistic info given to us the audience about this Melancholia.

We are manipulated in cold blood and we are not even in any way pushed towards some personal empathy for anyone in the tale, except maybe the horses. The medium is the message and the message is the massage. Good morning, Vietnam, straight from MacLuhans Global Village on Epsilon One Billion, or is it Antares in Scorpius?

Then what is left in that waste land of human desolation? The obsession of death that Lars von Trier cultivates with gusto! His obsession about some kind of catastrophe brought by some kind of agent. Since all man-made catastrophes have failed to produce this end of humanity Lars von Trier wishes with all his heart and not the slightest part of his mind, then he has to come to some more drastic means and that is to use the cosmos as God almighty punishing humanity for its vanity, its cruelty, its absurdity, its folly and insanity.

In other words that film is morbid and is supposed to make us think that there is no hope whatsoever as long as humanity exists. Of course he knows that there is no other life like ours in the cosmos and that our end would not be that drastic for the universe: The Earth is evil. We don't need to grieve for it. Nobody will miss it When I say were alone, were alone. Life is only on Earth and not for long, says Justine. Its obvious when humanity is destroyed no human being will feel sorry for it. How could they since they will be reduced to cosmic dust and powder and back to the super black hole of the big Bang. Good riddance!

2948485,5,B000VSDNF0,"One should be very careful when approaching this film. Otherwise, what is unmistakably one of the finest movies of this decade can rapidly become a tedious sci-fi drama about a strange and annoying bride and the end of the world.

The amount of bad reviews this film has received is all too understandable: it touches a nerve that not only upsets people but really hurts them. This movie is ""dangerous"" (a.k.a. powerful) enough to destabilize; it's the event of the Fall turned into cinematic language.

One has to be able to submit him/herself to fragilization; to open oneself to the monstruous radicality of existence before finally understanding the true beauty of this masterpiece. This is why Justine (played by Kirsten Dunst) annoys us so much.

Her relationship with her sister Claire (interpreted by Charlotte Gainsbourg) is really the key feature of this film. Justine is just about to get married, but something is terribly and painfully wrong with her: she's depressed beyond belief.

She's able to see pure despair and hopelessness behind what others spontaneously see life, pleasure and meaningfulness. It is as if she wears the glasses of truth, where every ideological human formulation is unveiled stupid, random, inconsistent and shallow.

One could say that she personifies what psychoanalysis calls ""the Real"", an eternal, monstruous, abyssal inconsistency within reality (and being) itself. It's precisely this unbearable trauma which Justine painfully personifies.

She's the supreme embodiment of this abyss, and once she publicly displays this trauma, only her sister stands behind her. For Justine's presence is just too traumatic for most people to handle; she's the unspeakable foreign body, what Freud called ""death drive"", an eternal impossibility of self-completion, of self-identification, of life experienced as basically an obscene mistake.

This is also why one should also be very careful with the last minutes of the film (spoilers ahead): once Justine enters that ridiculously improvised and impotent tent, that's not a escape, but rather a passport to acceptance; a small transition ritual which enables whoever enters it the possibility of finally giving up hope and fear; of giving up desire, of no longer caring anymore. To put it short: to overcome existence.

Melancholia (the name of the planet to hit the Earth and exterminate us all) is, in this perspective, the ultimate human redeemer; the one which finally brings us peace. There is also a very specific function for the fact that Wagner's prelude to Tristan und Isolde is playing like that in the background: to assign our deep and final reconciliation with death; a final (and sublime) encounter with the negative abyss within all of us, where every truth is finally unveiled and unbearably experienced.

This is, all at once, a lesson in fine arts, philosophy, psychoanalysis and in human existence and its finitude. This is Von Trier (and cinema) at his/its very best.",1434844800,3,2971,5.251054852320675

Set in a fabulously beautiful castle shot on location in Sweden, visually, this is a treat for the eyes. It is, however, so absolute in it's finality. As one looks in on the lavishly doomed wedding of Justine and Michael, Melancholia, a planet that's found it's way into the solar system, is on a collision course with Earth. Somehow, Justine feels the finality of what this means for humanity and falls into a depression that surprised me at how deep the human mind can close itself. Kiefer Sutherland's John tries to be strong for his son Leo, however, he fails miserably as Melancholia approaches, and he commits suicide. Justine and Leo's Magic Cave shelter them, with Claire as Melancholia's nearness to Earth causes their incineration. If only the end of all mankind could be so poetic and beautiful.

Claire is terrified of it. She wants to control the uncontrollable. The little boy approaches it with the faith of a child.

2948631,5,B000VSDNF0,"Melancholia is a stunning masterpiece which depicts the various hellish characteristics of a dysfunctional, co-dependent family. The cold, angry  bitter mother, the emotionally crippled alcoholic father, the desperate need for control by the sister who did all of the right things, (marrying the rich man and maintaining the perfect household) and the desperate love starved main character (Kristen Dunst), sets the stage for a  drama that shows the pain of a dysfunction that leaves everyone empty. Everyone wanted a piece of Kristin until she had nothing left to give. Even her bridegroom would not listen to her. He only wanted sex, and to pretend that everything was alright when she was falling apart.

The perfectionistic married sister seems to be the strong one but when her perfectly ordered world falls apart( because of the ironic end of the world) crazy Kristen  shows herself to be the strong one when she cares for the boy and her sister, by building an imaginary cave that will supposedly save them all, while her sister falls apart. It is symbolic of Kristen's role in life. Making up a fantasy that will appease everyone else, but is a lie.

This movie works on many levels. It isn't really a crisis when the world comes to an end because these characters are in reality, already dead. Everything was a pretense for the view of the world, to hide the pain and emptiness of lives that were not being lived. Dunst always knew this and could handle the harsh truth of death. What she couldn't handle was the lie that everything was normal.

  There are beautiful visual effects and so much symbolism. The death planet was beautiful, and the anti-gravity scenes were spectacular, adding a mystical beauty to death and depicting release from the constraints of life. The music is also poignant and beautiful. Anyone who has ever experienced dysfunctional, co-dependent families will appreciate this movie. It's a must see.",1428796800,2,1934,4.96594427244582

""The energies of our system will decay, the glory of the sun will be dimmed, and the earth, tideless and inert, will no longer tolerate the race which has for a moment disturbed its solitude.  Man will go down into the pit, and all his thoughts will perish.  The uneasy consciousness which in this obscure corner has for a brief space broken the contented silence of the universe, will be at rest.  Matter will know itself no longer.  'Imperishable monuments' and 'immortal deeds', death itself, and love stronger than death, will be as if they had not been.  Nor will anything that is, be better or worse for all that the labor, genius, devotion, and suffering of man have striven through countless ages to effect.""

A new bride weds under the looming specter of inevitable planetary destruction due to a collision with Melancholia, a newly discovered planet drawing ever closer to Earth. The groom leaves after the wedding, and the bride faces The End with her sister and nephew. Original and shocking. Somewhat depressing, but thought-provoking. Melancholia is the catalyst and the starring role of this film. Kirsten Dunst (the bride) provides calm insight and commentary as it appears that her sister's perfect world is literally about to explode. Some elements don't make sense (the groom leaving after the wedding, the sister's husband selfishly stealing the suicide pills and leaving his wife and son to deal with The End on their own, the golf cart that magically has power when electricity in cars and homes no longer functions, how Kirsten Dunst's hair goes from gorgeous at the wedding to dry and choppy afterwards).

Every scene is meticulously paced and imaged, lingering where they should, even if you don't want them to. It is a very dark and dreary film, but one whose purpose it is to validate an experience. The planet, aptly named Melancholia, is a representation of the looming yet terrifying nothingness that hovers over the heads of those who deal with depression. It is inescapable, powerful, and destructive. The splitting of the film into two chapters allows us to see things from the viewpoint of depressed Justine and her older, anxious sister, Claire.

2948813,5,B000VSDNF0,"This is a qualified 5 - if I could give it 10 for my own tastes, I would.  That said, for some, buyer beware.  And I guess I'm going to end up addressing my review to people who might rate this movie low because I think you can get more out of it than 1-3 stars when you watch it.

If you like Hollywood films and hate art films, obviously, stay away.  If you like living in certainty, stay away.  But before you do, let me make a small suggestion.

Sometimes being unsettled is good.  Sometimes feeling bad is good - we should be grateful as human beings to feel depth of emotion - be it happiness OR melancholy.

Sometimes you should take a walk.  Take a walk when the weather is great.  But get out there and take a walk in a blizzard, on a really hot day, or in the rain... or on a foggy night, put on headphones, go out for a walk at 1am and listen to old spooky blues records.

The whole POINT of going for a walk instead of staying in your living room where you have everything just the way you like it IS that it is unsettling.

The whole, ""ships are safest in harbor, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT SHIPS ARE FOR"" and neither are you.

So that said, what are you buying into with Melancholia?  You aren't getting entertainment, you're getting art.

I don't think it is about depression per se.  It isn't about ""gee, these people are depressed and what should they do about it.""

I got the distinct impression that Kirsten Dunst's character has some sort of foresight.  Not specific knowledge but she feels intrinsically that something is going to go wrong, thus the dumping of the great advertising job that she is brilliant at, the groom, etc.  It turns out she isn't feeling depressed, she's feeling ACCURATELY.

Which begs the question is depression or melancholy ALWAYS a dysfunction or is it healthy when it is an accurate response to what is going on?  Is cheerfulness, teamwork, ambition, confidence, sick in the wrong context?  This isn't a movie about ""oh gee they're DEPRESSED"" which I see in quite a few 5 star reviews as well as 1 stars.  Dunst makes the right decisions about her life, drops the career, etc because something horrible is coming and can feel that in light of that, it doesn't mean all that much to her - that's symbolically valid within the movie with the rogue planet coming, but it's valid in actual real life.

The fact is, something horrible is going to happen to you.

It is coming for you as you read this, waiting somewhere in your future.

Certainly death, the deaths of those you love, absolutely, but not just death.  It's very likely you'll have your heart broken, lose a good friendship, disappoint yourself, act like a jerk in a way you can never take back, experience the whole gamut of suffering, pain, for yourself and those you love - you will lose things or have horrible things happen or do bad things THAT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE.

Ouch, right?  But so, so very true.

Now, if you want to stay in your living room with everything just so, if walking in the fog at 1am listening to blues records or in the rain, lifting your face to feel it instead of rushing inside sounds insane to you, you are missing out.  And besides, your living room won't ultimately save you.

What do you do when depression is PERFECTLY JUSTIFIED, the most sane thing?  Do you withdraw?  Do you rush out to seek other people?  But what if other people can't help?  How do you, how do others, meet what is most definitely coming?  Sorry but this too is part of the human experience.  You will be more alive, more human, more compassionate to other humans, with that awareness - less human, less alive without.

It's one of those roadtrip/cocktail party questions - what is art?  I'll tell you my definition.  When you sleep, you dream and process the events of your life symbolically.  People kept awake to long start too go kind of batty, can't function well - even if you let them sleep but interrupt only when they start dreaming.  Dreaming is the unconscious processing of being alive - of life's experience.  You have to do it or you'll literally lose your mind.

Art is kind of the same way - it's the semi-conscious processing of human experience of life.  Dreaming and art fulfill kind of the same functions - in the months following WW2, in totally bombed-out Germany, while Berlin was still essentially rubble, what did the people there do in the aftermath, as soon as they had their bare, basic needs met?  Put on plays.  Put little orchestras together and play music.  In the RUBBLE.  Because they needed to.  I suspect we're all a little crazy in this day and age because we instinctively reach for art and get entertainment handed to us instead - sleep instead of dreaming.

So anyway, the movie is beautiful.  I was about to say ""well, it isn't entertainment but it is art"" but I remembered, in the 1800's there was a musical subgenre that specifically would be songs about tragically dead children - seriously that was it - people would show up to the concerts in droves, weep, it'd be very cathartic.  If THAT was entertainment, I suppose Melancholia is entertainment - depressing films, horror films that ACTUALLY horrify as opposed to make you jump due to a loud sudden noise, are cathartic and entertaining in their own right.  Idunno, maybe we in America have a religion that trumps all others and that religion is COMFORT.  That makes me feel uncomfortable, which is why I take walks in bad weather and at bad times and watched Melancholia - to take me out of my comfort zone just a little bit.

And ah... have some compassion for the people you run into in your life that aren't all sparky and upbeat - psychological studies prove that slightly depressed people perceive reality more accurately than upbeat people.  Maybe they're onto something.  Non-melancholy is overrated :)",1424304000,23,5817,4.532180595581172

and moody.

and since Melancholia means sad....they certainly played their roles well.  I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone depressed or suicidal.  It could get one weepy and sad.  Another film with dark notes, but one I liked so much better was What Dreams May Come, starring Robin Williams. It explores the afterlife in explicit and haunting detail.  This one explores an impending Extinction Level Event with beauty and haunting style.
  I probably missed the main point.  The trailer suggested that this film would leave one feeling ecstatic.  I wonder what they were smoking???

Her wedding is taking place and she's acting in a very odd manner.  After watching the film a second time, I totally got what was going on with her. The second part of the movie is mostly about the  second sister and her anxiety about the planet that may or may not hit the earth. As you may have heard, this is a disaster movie without the screaming and chaos. This family lives in a beautiful, isolated spot and all the action takes place there.

Keiffer Sutherland, as usual, does a great job.  Too bad he wasn't the main character instead.

Here's a hint to watching the movie.  Any time you see the groom on the screen, you can fast forward through that part.  He loves her, I get it.  But after a minute or so that is understood.  It doesn't really take another 45 minutes to convince us.  And he doesn't play any other roll in the movie.

But for a two hour project you need to have a point.  A focal point.  Nothing of interest here.  Perhaps the biggest problem is that all of the characters do not appear to be people.  It is kind of like watching actors acting like actors who are kind of acting like people.  Yet there is no script, no direction and none of them have creativity enough to come up with anything interesting for their characters to do.

I admit...  I've only made it to the one hour mark before I started to skip forward a little and give up.  So if it gets better and I missed it, I apologize.  But I doubt that is the case.  Note that I certainly have nothing against art film.  I got a bfa in fine art. I have watched and enjoyed many many more art flicks than most.  But as for the first hour there is no content here.  Plenty of aesthetics, but that is all.  Not that there is anything wrong with that..  I've skipped those deeper steps quite a bit in order to get a project done and get a grade.

Not only was this a total senseless and slow moving embarrassment to Dunst, it makes me wonder if she posed nude in the moonlight (or was that two errant planets) just to sell this flick.  The first 15 minutes were in slow motion...literally.  The next 90 minutes must have been directed by a snail...and the mood of this film was totally depressing.  If that's what the creators were aiming at, they won.  But it bored me to death.  Sci-fi films of the 50's were so much better.  Remember ""When Worlds Collide""?  One star is being generous.  Here's my literary take...slow moving, solemn, depressing, no one knows how to smile, lots of wasted footage, horrible soundtrack, the audio was so bad I had turn on the subtitles to understand the script,..bizzare...the wedding would make anyone sick...and she fu--s a guy that she never met after she rejects her husband moments after the wedding?  Kirsten Dunst should be ashamed of this appearance.  I'm convinced she did it to go on screen nude...and the nude scene is horrible.  In fact, I don't believe it was her...it must have been a body double.  There's a 10-minute episode at the very end of the film where her sister walks around asking for ""John""...her husband.  10 minutes????  Avoid at all cost.

After the the first time I saw it this movie has stayed with me. I find myself thinking about it weeks after viewing.
The visuals are spectacular, beautiful and moving. The dialog is sparse, letting the lens tell the story and more importantly assuming that the audience is intelligent enough to understand. What should be lovely and perfect is not, it is uncomfortable at the least. What should be horrific becomes beautiful.  There are other reviews that give an out line of the story. I feel you have to come at this movie with the right frame of mind, maybe feeling a little melancholic or simply in a serious kind of mood. I have seen many reviews that imply that only those with some history of mental illness can truly relate. And yes depression as well as anxiety play a big role in the film, however I think that anyone with a serious mind can understand even if they have not experienced these feelings to the degree that some actors do. I may have experience with some of what Kristen Dunst's character goes through, but I don't think that kind of inside torment is necessary to enjoy the film.  10/2014",1414540800,,1387,4.456692913385827

2949122,3,B000VSDNF0,"I'm a Kirsten Dunst fan, so it's difficult for me to give Melancholia a poor mark, despite a pile of misgivings. Lars von Trier did some fine work here, but it wasn't enough to keep me watching for the duration (I'm saving the 2nd half for a day that may never come). As Melancholia is the antithesis of an action flick, it just felt too long. The first ~5 minutes (very slow motion sequences, etc.) had me worried that the whole film would be the same, so I was relieved when an actual story began (OK, I'll admit it, I fast forwarded to the story).

For those who have the patience, Melancholia provides a glimpse into ""the horror of it all,"" a premonition (or perhaps an actualization) of being trapped in a different flavor of hell. This is a horror film of sorts, cleverly disguised as something else.

What a great cast! Melancholia was my first time around the block with Alexander Skarsgrd outside of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Blood/dp/B00N176ZBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Blood</a>&nbsp;(unfortunately it was difficult for me to forget that he is not a vampire). As for Kiefer Sutherland: I never realized he has such a pointy nose! Maybe age makes noses pointier?

The trouble with Melancholia is that I had little or no empathy with or sympathy for the characters; if you think for even just a second about the global blight of poverty, how can you care about misery among the rich? Melancholia is an extreme example of ""First World problems.""
Anyway, I can't recommend this one unless you're into fart house films... although if you are taking the proper mind-altering substances, it may be just the thing. ",1414195200,,1679,5.050541516245487

2949127,3,B000VSDNF0,"In this beautifully filmed, lethargically paced, obsessively self-indulgent half hour short film interminably padded to fill out an eternity, retired CTU agent Jack Bauer has all the money in the world and an empty life.  He's killed everyone, everywhere, to make the world safe from terrorism.  And now he has no one to play with.  So he buys a huge dollhouse, a bunch of lifesize dolls and has a mock wedding.  It doesn't go well.  The dolls are sentient but soulless and, recognizing their own kind, don't like each other.

Jack Bauer's wifedoll is wired a little too tight and her porcelain exterior is about to crack.  He tries to marry off his sister in law, but during the wedding she realizes that she's little more than a tagline for a new line of lifesize dolls.  Her circuits blown, she becomes catatonic and goes to live with Jack Bauer and his wifedoll and their gingerbread boy.  Sisterdoll takes barebreasted moontans, which earns actress Kristen Dunst accolades from European movie fans who love barebreasted moontans and don't care that Dunst's acting covers the gamut from Barbie to Skipper.

Jack Bauer looks through a telescope and discovers he's very depressed because he killed everyone in the entire world to keep us safe from the terrorists.  His depression is looming larger and larger and takes the shape of a giant blue pill which he swallows.  He then falls asleep with the horses.  His wifedoll sensibly covers him with hay.

Wifedoll wants to sit on the veranda drinking wine and singing Beethoven's 9th while waiting for the giant blue sleeping pill to arrive, but Sisterdoll says no that's boring let's build a teepee instead.  So Sisterdoll and Gingerbread Boy build a teepee, except they only build the frame and omit the buffalo hides so they can see the giant blue pill.

2949175,4,B000VSDNF0,"MELANCHOLIA is the kind of movie that will generate extreme feelings either way: viewers either love it or hate it.  For anyone who has experienced depression or panic, or any form of mental illness, however, Lars von Trier's work will strike an answering chord.  The opening sequence sets the tone, as we see Justine (Kirsten Dunst) in a surreal world, with the music from Wagner's TRISTAN AND ISOLDE striking great aural waves in the background.  The Wagnerian references are significant: we are transported into an elemental world in which the acts of ""knowing"" and ""unknowing"" assume particular significance.

MELANCHOLIA offers some trenchant comments about depression: even though it is perceived as a 'disorder' in most societies, it can confer an incredible calm on sufferers.  This is certainly the case with Justine, whose serene demeanor contrasts starkly with that of her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg).  As the two of them prepare for the inevitable strike by the planet Melancholia (a physical manifestation of a mental state), their behavior significant: Justine builds a makeshift structure which she claims will protect them from the catastrophe to come (even though it doesn't), while Claire tries vainly to escape with her son Leo (Cameron Spurr) but finds no way out.  How can there be?  Even though sufferers are often told to ""snap out"" of their depression, it's obvious that they can't.  They are mentally imprisoned, just like Claire seems to be physically imprisoned.

Lars von Trier's camerawork seems particularly suitable for this type of film.  Mostly shot with a handheld camera that most restlessly around the actors, unable to keep still for any length of time, it suggests a world of uncertainties, one where no one knows what will really happen next.  Claire's wife John (Keifer Sutherland) tries his best to assume an air of quiet authority over the proceedings, as he continually reassures his spouse that nothing will come of them, even if Melancholia does strike; but we know that his efforts are doomed.  This is a harsh, unfeeling world over which human beings have little or no control, despite their attempts to colonize it - through the use of a telescope or a makeshift device made of wire.  The only way to cope with it is to encounter it head-on, whatever the consequences.

In this topsy-turvy, elemental world, Justine comes across as the most capable person, despite the fact that, for everyone else in the film (especially the guests at her wedding-feast), she is perceived as ""ill.""  She is the only person who admits to her state of mind, and alters her behavior to suit that state of mind.  She might seem 'deviant' or 'odd' - especially in one sequence where she lies naked on a rock, her pale torso illuminated by the planet's rays - but she knows how to make sense of her life.  MELANCHOLIA encourages us to question our definitions of 'madness' and 'sanity,' as well as providing a profound insight into the world of the depressive.  A unique experience.",1410912000,,3017,4.998

2949177,3,B000VSDNF0,"I've watched many a movie that I've enjoyed and appreciated more than 'Melancholia...' but why does this film haunt me? It's not particularly likeable and there are sections of it that elicit a 'c'mon, just end this and go on to the next scene,' but it is intriguing and you'll find yourself thinking about it at the strangest times. And when you try to describe it to someone who has not seen it you get the 'uh huh...sounds awful,' reaction more often than not.

But here you have the story of newlyweds Justine and Michael and as 'Melancholia' begins you really like this young couple as they take in stride their humongous limo attempting to navigate a hair-pin turn as it carries them to the venue for their reception, the very lavish estate (owned by the bride's sister and brother-in-law, a couple with issues too numerous to mention...) and they are very, very late. And then you take in that there is no bridal party, no best man and no maid/matron of honor sharing the cavernous limo. Just the bride and groom.

Arriving at the reception things rapidly deteriorate. There are secrets regarding Justine's mental fragility, the bride's parents are present and not at all reluctant to reveal their mutual hatred, and Justine's brother-in-law John (Keifer Sutherland at his least likeable) frequently snorts 'unbelievable' as Justine's frail hold on the situation unravels.

So after the shortest marriage ever, the story moves to the real problem at hand: the wayward planet Melancholia that is on a collision course with Earth. Or is it? So with a bit of foreshadowing and insight, we see that scientist John is convinced that the planet will pass over Earth and the resulting event will be the Best. Thing. Ever. The latter part of the film focuses on how different members of the family embrace the possibility of world's end.

I will say the acting is amazing: Kirsten Dunst is a seriously overlooked actress. There's much more to this young lady than 'Spiderman' movies.

So this will not be my go to movie when I feel like popping something in and putting my mind on hold for 120 minutes. But it's a movie that is just kind of stuck in my brain.",1410480000,,2158,4.7287234042553195

2949212,4,B000VSDNF0,"Kirsten Dunst plays a melancholic girl on her wedding day. She and her groom are in a limo trying to get to their wedding reception, but the path is narrow and curvy and the limo simply can't get through. They arrive 2 hours late. When they arrive, Kirsten looks up and comments on a red star that she says she has never seen before. In response, her sister informs her of how rude her late arrival is. Immediately we get to see how incredibly messed up Kristen's character's family is. Her father appears to be a bit immature and unreliable, drinking a bit much and playing childish pranks on the waiters. Her mother is a bitter, selfish, control-freak who takes over the father's speech in order to blast marriage in general and to tell everyone how much she despises the entire concept of ""till death do us part"" and all that sort of thing. Kirsten's character and her sister simply sit and endure their mother's narcissistic abuse, as they are accustomed to it. Kirsten tries to smile and be nice throughout the reception, but gradually the smiles are less and less and we begin to see a darkness creeping over her.

Kirsten's depression grows deeper, with her repeatedly disappearing from the reception for long periods of time to be by herself. Eventually she and her new husband are in the bedroom. He is clearly ready to enjoy their honeymoon and consummate the marriage. But she is brooding, says she doesn't want to and leaves the room. She wanders outside and climbs into a golf cart which she drives far out into the 18-hole golf course that surrounds the mansion where the reception is being held. It is her sister's husband's house and he repeatedly expresses how rich he is and how much he has spent on the reception. Kirsten's wedding dress hangs on the pedals of the golf cart as she climbs out. So she just rips it loose and walks on, unconcerned.

There is a long series of events showing how depressed Kirsten is, how dysfunctional her parents are, and how hard her sister is trying to hold everything together and make nice. The groom, who had been trying throughout the film to cheer Kirsten up and deal with her depression as best as he could, gives up and leaves her after the bedroom scene.

Kirsten's depression grows severe. Her sister invites her to come and stay at their house so they can help her through it. Her sister's husband, played by Kiefer Sutherland, is openly unsympathetic to Kirsten. His focus is primarily on his money and his love of science. At the moment his passion for science is focused on astronomy and a rogue planet that is supposed to ""fly by"" the Earth in a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Kirsten's sister says she is uncomfortable with this whole thing and Kiefer warns her to stop looking it up on the internet because she keeps upsetting herself after reading posts by doomsday prophets who insist it is going to be the end of the world. About this time the planet is visible in the daylight sky, although it is small.

The story continues with Kirsten's sister trying to cheer her up. They go horseback riding and Kirsten seems happier, at least until her horse refuses to cross a particular bridge. Kirsten had talked early in the film about how no one but she could ride that horse and how much she loved it. But when the horse refuses to cross the bridge Kirsten beats the crap out of it with her riding crop. The horse is so frustrated that it literally sits down on the ground with her still on its back rather than go on. Kirsten's sister has to grab the riding crop out of Kirsten's hand to stop her from beating it more.

Meanwhile, the planet grows larger in the sky. Kiefer Sutherland helps his son make a metal loop that everyone can use to measure when the planet, named ""Melancholia"", is growing closer and when it is moving farther away.  Around this time the planet is close enough to earth that it interferes with some of earth's electrical activity. Kirsten's sister shows increasing fear of the planet despite her husband's assurances that scientists have predicted it will pass harmlessly by the earth. She goes to a computer and looks up a report showing that the planet Melancholia will brush past the earth, loop around the Sun, and then come right back and smack in the earth. As she is printing the diagram of the planet's predicted path, the power cuts out. The planet's nearness to earth has interfered with all electrical activity planet-wide. Kiefer says this was expected and that the power will be out for a few days. He reassures his wife once more that it is all going to work out fine. But later that day Kirsten sees Kiefer unloading survival goods from his truck and hiding them in the barn. He warns Kirsten not to tell her sister because it would only upset her.

I know some of the reviewers here have told you how the film ends, but I'm not going to. I think you should watch it.

Some call Melancholia 'slow' and a 'bore', specifically Part One. This is clearly not the type of movie they would enjoy. As for you, consider a film in which characters who have been completely fleshed out (off screen, mind you) interact with one another. With a few of them comes baggage and unresolved issues. Part One is an exploration of human interaction--the kind that remains behind closed doors--while Part Two is a journey into people's reactions to sudden events as well as their handling of them. Does this sound like something you would enjoy? If not, carry on. Melancholia has enough negative reviews as it is.

I'm glad I didn't know much about it -- the story, the characters -- before I saw it because I love the way it caught me off-guard. And so I would hesitate to spill too many beans in advance. Superficially, the movie is about a wedding reception that goes completely awry, about a clinically depressed woman who is losing the battle for her mind and, lest we forget, the movie may also be about the end of the world. Even if the film confounds you & frustrates you at times, it may sneak into your soul -- and in ways that words alone cannot express. It's the kind of movie you'll love arguing about with friends afterward.  Finally there's the performance of Kirsten Dunst as the battered bride; it is fascinating and beautiful, unrelenting yet full of shadings and subtleties. I usually don't have much patience with "" artsy"" movies but this one -- directed by the brooding Swede Lars Von Trier -- defies any attempt at categorization. The Blu Ray quality is impeccable-- especially the rumbling/soaring musical soundtrack, some of it by R Wagner. Yeah, the German opera guy.

2949371,5,B000VSDNF0,"One of my favorite science fiction films of all time.  It is one of those films that will take you away from it all and make you forget about everything else.  Performances by Charlotte Gainsbourg, Kirsten Dunst, and Kiefer Sutherland are outstanding.  Charlotte, in particular, should have received an Oscar nomination for this.

To me, the film is in two distinct parts.  The first half is nearly inscrutable on its own, but you must immerse yourself in it.  It is only when we get to the second half that we may begin to piece together what had already happened, what the characters have come to understand, and what looms ahead.

This film is not an action/adventure.  (You should not be in a ""hurry up and entertain me"" mood while watching.)  It is a film meant to be experienced, a gradual crescendo moving toward a climax that occurs at the very end.  The last moments of the film are cataclysmic, emotionally.  Its conceit has never been realized so well.  You will be thinking about the film all the following day.

Incidental and background music and sound effects are excellent.  Make sure you have a powerful sound system to get the full effect.  A floor mounted subwoofer is recommended.  Watch it on a large flatscreen if you can.",1402963200,,1244,4.689814814814815

2949395,5,B000VSDNF0,"Nine Things about the Movie Melancholia [Denmark, 2011]

1. This extraordinary film is the second in director Lars von Triers Depression Trilogy, after Antichrist. Its not a sequel, it is a companion film. It examines similar themes, although this time in a science fiction genre. This movie is not as extreme as Antichrist, and is easier to understand. But that doesnt mean this movie is a walk in the park. After all, it is Lars von Trier.

2. Von Trier wrote the movie based on a depressive episode he actually had, and the insight that depressed people tend to be more calm in situations of high pressure - because they are already prepared for the worst result.

3. The opening sequence of the film is a breathtakingly beautiful, surreal montage of scenes that represent themes explained during the course of the film. These scenes are juxtaposed with images of the destruction of the Earth as another planet collides into it.

4. The first half of the movie takes place at a wedding reception for Justine and Michael at a secluded country estate. The reception slowly unravels, partly because so many attendees make the evening about themselves. But the main problem is that Justine suffers from a debilitating depression, and is unable to hold herself together.

5. The second half of the movie takes place at the same country estate, shortly after the wedding. Justine is living there with her sister Claire and Claires family. A rogue planet, aptly named Melancholia, is making a near approach to Earth.

6. Claire is terrified that the planet will hit Earth. Her husband tries to convince her that the planet will miss Earth. Justine is calm in her knowledge that Melancholia will actually destroy our planet.

7. Charlotte Gainsbourg, who starred in Antichrist, plays Claire here. Her two roles in these movies make fascinating counterpoints. Kirsten Dunst almost burns a hole through the screen in her portrayal of Justine. It might be her best performance ever.

8. Von Trier wasn't concerned with making the collision of the two planets scientifically realistic - his point was to illustrate the behavior of the human psyche under extreme circumstances.

9. This movie is a gorgeous, intimate apocalypse. Von Trier is telling us that whether its a brain problem or a cosmic one, we are all alone in this universe. Nothing we do ultimately matters, and were all helpless to control our own fate. We are just thrown around by forces greater than us until we die. But its still beautiful.

If thats not a message you want to hear, then you should stay away from this movie.",1402617600,2,2584,4.8522727272727275
2949396,1,B000VSDNF0,"well this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the whole family is heavily emotionaly disturbed the writer and director are as well,  to make a movie like this ... stay away from it it is a unGodly movie promoting depression anxiety hopelessness loneliness and animal abuse she beats up a innocent horse... this is just the type of movie satan loves and would love for you to watch !!!!!!  keep your children far  away from it and just say no !",1402272000,4,451,4.2823529411764705
2949397,4,B000VSDNF0,"Kristin Dunst expresses the self destructive aspect of depression well. She ruined the happiest day of her life. Marriage and a big promotion surrounded by family and friends. Or did she? As the movie unravels, we find out she was suffering from a crushing depression. Why? Depression is the most mysterious and spiritual of illnesses. Terrible but a gift more often than not. Contemp psychology posits many valid theories which contribute to it. They all tell part of the story. This movie suggests another part. A spiritual accumulation of selfishness, emptiness, lack of meaning, lack of value and lack of connection on a global scale. Perhaps suggesting, we all inhale psychically from the spiritual 'air' of the world. Of a collective consciousness. Of the intent behind random interactions. Of other's thoughts directed toward us. Of our thoughts directed toward them. Of slights, accumulated grievances, unresolved fights, etc Perhaps there is a global mood of which we all partake to some degree. When combined with personal 'evils' it resonates and coagulates into something dark, chronic and foreboding. A gray cloud that refuses to go away. Like air pollution. Spiritual energy works similarly. It sounds archaic but many cultures who were more communally and spiritually connected have posited similar narratives along these lines. Depression often does not make entire sense in its context. With the stories we tell in psychologists offices. They always fall short in explaining why. Its only when we expand our view and realize the spiritual matrix we are all ensconced in that it begins to make sense.",1402012800,,1616,5.243243243243243
2949398,1,B000VSDNF0,"I read all the glowing reviews and decided to give it a shot. There is another 1 star review here that currently has 80+ helpful votes. I wish I paid more attention to that one; it is pretty much dead-on.

From the reviews, I understood going in that the director was trying to make the point that depressed people sometimes handle hopeless situations better. That point could've been made faster, better, and more interesting. Most of the characters are entirely one dimensional; and there were none that I really cared for other than the little boy. As a result, when the end came I wasn't sad that everyone died, nor did I feel bad for their predicament. I wanted to kill them myself.

I'm not impressed by lavish imagery without a story; I can buy photographers magazines if I want to see pretty pictures. I'm also not impressed with character studies that don't give me characters to care about. It's just boring.

The best contrast I can think of is the 1980 movie ""Ordinary People"". An amazing movie that studies the effects of depression, but you actually care about it. And it's interesting. Nothing like this.",1401494400,4,1119,4.698979591836735

The acting was basically good, but not up to par for the quality of actors they used.  There were scenes in the Trailer that were not in the movie.

My simple equation is that movies are an escape.  There is no escape from this movie.  Clinical Depression is the main character in the movie and omnipresent.

2949434,4,B000VSDNF0,"AN EXTREMELY complex exploration of two sisters - Justine [Dunst] and Claire [Gainsbourg].  The first section covers Justines wedding day.  It's literally a story book wedding - but slowly we see how everything unravels and 'the myth of togetherness' falls apart leaving Justine isolated - alone.  Part # 2 ""Claire"" shows her slow recovery under her sisters care - concurrent with all of that is the approach of the mega-planet Melancholia ......which may or may not 'spare' earth.

Performances overall are excellent especially Dunst and Gainsbourg [who has wisely shunned commercial, selecting her projects with great care ... she's a fine actress with tremendous potential].  Dunst and Gainsbourg work well together - and a future pairing would be very welcome  [they're naturally starkly different and it's this difference that makes them fascinating to watch on screen].

Dunst has really come along way since her ""Jumanji"" days!  Kiefer Sutherland [as Claire's husband]; the legendary Charlotte Rampling [as the cynical and realistic mother of the girls], John Hurt [as the estranged father] and the rest of the stellar cast give excellent support.  Tech credits are perfect and the Costume, Art Direction/Production Design appropriately compliment this project.

It's a haunting experience ~ one wonders about the rest of the characters ...... since we only focus specifically on the two sisters and the little boy.

They look for shock value and that's what they expected of  this film. Well this film does not ride on that wave. So does does this mean that this is not a very good Lars von Trier film? Absolutely not instead it has incredible performances by the entire cast. And I find the plot of this film to be one of the most important themes he has ever dealt with in any of his films. Visually just as if not better than his past works. The lovely Charlotte Gainsbourg gives one of her most tender and humanistic performances of her career in this film. And Kiersten Dunst blew me away with her performance as you have never seen her play before. Her very well executed performance relies on very little dialogue and uses very deadpan expressions that carries her throughout the whole film with such complexity. I have been following Lars von Triers career since he worked on television in his native Copenhagen blowing me away on his haunting hospital Epic, The Kingdom, which typically America stole and Stephen King made his own American failure of the version. But this was the beginning of his career and I've vowed that I would always support what he does. Is Melancholia  as good as Antichrist or Nymphomaniac? Well I can say is Melancholia is neither of those films. But just as good if not better. The public is to stop expecting what Lars is supposed to make and appreciate the diversity of his subject matter. He's one of the hardest working film directors in the history of film. watch this film and don't think about his other films and I guarantee you you will grade this film higher than 90% of the films you've seen in the past decade at least.

2949481,5,B000VSDNF0,"Each person is totally entitled to her/his opinion, no one is forced to like some film, music or art. On the contrary, if strong dislike is what one feels or thinks, it's perfectly OK. But reading many one star reviews, just like another reviewer stated, they say more about the reviewer than the movie itself...I was amused by the one who said that the movie's only quality is Kirsten Dunst breasts.

Melancholia presents 2 depressed main characters within a science fiction background. There is no conscious choice from the filmmaker or script for the viewer to like these characters, they are just who they are; likewise, for science fiction fans, there is no explanation about the new planet approaching, it's just approaching.

We have an 8 minute introduction, no narration, no dialogue, only a dreamlike sequence depicting the events that will develop and uses the prelude of Tristan und Isolde; this music is the only one throughout the whole movie, at first it may sound repetitive, but it's so beautiful and its applied in key moments so this does not matter at the end. The first part is dedicated to Justine, a bride who is not sure about her commitment and who suffers severe depression. This first half is basically a drama, the only information about the menacing planet is that there is a new bright star in the constellation Scorpio.
I must mention about the frequently used term ""character development"". For many casual reviewers the main problem of many films is the lack of ""character development""; perhaps they think this 'development' consists that the viewer must know almost everything about the main protagonists, where they come from, what are their motivations or their drive, goals, etc.. I believe this is a misconception. For me, character development is simply that the viewer understands the characters regardless of the knowledge about them. During the first part of Melancholia I knew when I needed that Justine's boss is a pig, her sister Claire is psychorigid and the groom is deeply in love but weak. I didn't need a lot of dialogue and exposition to know that, one just knows as the celebratory events unfold.

The second half is about Claire and now the planet Melancholia is mentioned as a possible menace, there are no TV news clips or people panicking in cities as in a summer blockbuster movie, only apprehension about the situation. What else should one feel about the possibility the world will end in the next few days? Electricity is gone and the only means of information is a telescope and the planet getting bigger in the sky. Justine, who had an emotional breakdown before clears a bit her mind (surely she just wanted to die anyway and planet Melancholia will be just fine for her) and now the role reverses with Claire who begins to fall apart. The final scene is daunting.

Now, being a sci-fi fan I must also comment about the science fiction quality of this film. Of course, this movie is so much closer to hard sci-fi, particularly, Solaris. There's even a painting shown in the introduction that looks so much as one used in a scene in Solaris. Melancholia's two sisters set of mind is practically the same from the main couple in Solaris (both original and the 2002 remake). About the science, the planet just comes quickly from behind of the Sun, I assume for some reason it was not detected before, so it's a surprise; of course, such a planet would alter with anticipation gravitational forces in the Solar System and therefore planets' orbits, but director Lars Von Trier is not concerned about these details, the new planet is just a device for the human drama and his vision to develop.
 The special FX scenes are well done and as I commented before, the final scene is unnerving, majestic and even tragically sad, how Claire and Justine join and share the final instant of not only their lives, but the world's. Just the few seconds before the end of the world (and the movie), the view and sound is quite impressive.

Acting is fine from all involved and Dunst portrays her role convincingly. About the camera movement, I had no problem at all, it's just a style of filmmaking and not taken to the extreme as in movies like Cloverfield or Blair Witch Project.

Amidst too many pointless movies in every genre (even science fiction) that the gargantuan movie giant industry spits each year, Melancholia is like a refreshing but cool breeze, that feels nice if you have the patience to stand in it for a while and contemplate.",1398556800,4,4491,4.779639175257732

The acting of Kirsten Dunst, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Kiefer Sutherland were first rate and the soundtrack captured the mood perfectly.

2949526,1,B000VSDNF0,"This is the most excruciatingly boring film I have ever seen in my life. I kept waiting for the good part, but they payoff never came. Cheaply made. They shot the whole thing in one house. The scene never changes. But they slapped lots of corny ""vintage"" photoshop-y effects all over it, so it's like, artsy or something I guess? Who cares. Do yourself a favor and watch paint dry instead.

Now, maybe you think I'm some bro'd-out neanderthal who's mad because Kirsten Dunst didn't turn into a Transformer robot and shoot up the place with lasers or something, and that YOU would love it because you're such a sensitive soul with a real eye for the beautiful things in this lonely life. WRONG. WRONG. I love well-wrought artsy films. This is just not one of them. It's a pretentious, self-impressed movie with open disdain for its viewers. ""If you don't appreciate this, you simply haven't any taste at all,"" the palpably heavy hand of the director sneers, as you wander out of the room pretending to need another glass of water for the third time.

To answer a claim made by other reviewers: Kirsten Dunst's character is not some touching, vividly-rendered portrait of depression's horrible effects. She's a two-dimensional caricature, a classic manic pixie dream girl. She drifts around frowning at everything, being sad about everything, and never doing anything. Not only is that a reductive portrayal of depression, it's B-O-R-I-N-G. Her character is completely flat. She never changes. She never learns. She doesn't grow. She's just a mopey lump. I mean, I have struggled with depression but I didn't empathize with her character at all. I wanted to smack her across the face with a dead fish and say ""WAKE UP KIRSTEN DUNST!

Sign of director and actor being on same page, whoever, or whatever (script), might be most responsible for the performance. And Keiffer Sutherland and Kirsten Dunst are both really good in this film. Dunst has always been a kind of poor woman's Jennifer Jason Leigh, here she establishes her own chops. Charlotte Rampling also lets it out. Gainesburg very good too.

Another thing that wins points for me is an intelligent filmmaker being allowed to riff.

2949609,5,B000VSDNF0,"A lot of the reviews here that are one star are very troubling.  I'm reminded of the people who reportedly walked out of the theaters during Tree of Life, or Twilight fans posting book reviews of Stoker's Dracula or Tess of the d'Urbervilles (that was mentioned so frequently by the author of Twilight).

I get it.  The movie is slow paced.  I get it.  The science fiction is a mere backdrop rather than the focus.

But the movie is meant to explore an emotion, not merely state it.  It explores how severe depression really is.  It explores how those without depression react to tragedy and how those with it become numb to stress and tragedy.  It is slowly paced - but it does so to bring you to an emotional realization.

There's nothing wrong with movies that are action and more highly paced in their drama.  But, for me, Melancholia - along with other incredibly cerebral science fiction like the Her or the UK televsion series, Black Mirror, are these scifi pieces that are really upping the game as far as art goes.  Too often is science fiction just the window dressing for dumb action movies.  Too often do supposedly adult drama mean to do nothing but over stimulate you and sell you a soap opera story.

Very rarely does a piece get so intimate, require you to reflect upon the people and their situation without jarring you to the next situation and the next and the next.  In a world where society must constantly be forced to be over stimulated, this asks you to slow down to explore this one thing.

And frankly - the one star reviews here say more about the reviewers, than they do the movie.

The shooting locations and the capturing of them are just absolutely gorgeous, it's incredibly well acted and  the prelude to Richard Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde set the tone of the film perfectly.  My one petty complaint, is the naming of the planet.  The movie is aptly titled - but there was no real reason to actually name the planet crashing into earth that very thing.

The psychological story being told is fairly riveting. The creator looks at power differentials between individuals during varying situations. How do people behave when they feel secure? How do they behave when they feel threatened? How do they behave when they absolutely know there's no escape from universal disaster? How long does it take for people to admit that a disaster truly is inescapable and universal? How can universal disaster provide anyone with the impetus to sanity and regained personal power? How much pure mayhem does it take to break through the shell of indifference modern people construct to protect themselves from both too much signal and too much noise?

Like a great work of literature, the images it evokes only hint at metaphor, so that the lessons we derive from making the connections are deeper and more personal, and feel like our own insights.
  I have been exposed to numerous important films over the years (I am the partner of a film scholar) and I am attracted to movies from every genre, but only a handful are this memorable, honestly.  (A bit of free association conjures up Days of Heaven, L.I.E., La Strada, 5 East Pieces, Chinatown, Three Women, The Talented Mr. Ripley... each for different reasons.)  That said, I would recommend watching this one when you have time to contemplate it afterwards, and not when you are in the mood for an entertaining yarn.  I read reviews when the film was in theaters and knew I was interested, yet after it was released in DVD, I let it sit on my wish list for months; then it sat on our shelf unwatched for as long.  It was worth the wait for the right moment, as it is a film you have to be ready to let in.
  I should also say that Kirsten Dunst's performance is phenomenal.  In this, she reveals deep emotional storms within her character, while keeping her performance fully reined in.  Impressive.

It has obviously been extremely informed by the director's own bouts with major depression, and it is almost a textbook lesson to those who are uninflicted with mental illness of its devastating effect. Those with mental illness live within their heads and their skins, the outside world hardly touches them. A scene  like a marriage where everyone should be happy only reinforces the disfunctionality of a character like Justine.

If you are in the mood for a superbly acted and directed film that is disturbing at times yet beautiful and that makes you think deeply... then, I highly recommend Melancholia.",1388448000,2,581,5.6022727272727275

I would recommend it to anyone who has a close family member or close friend who suffers with depression.,1387324800,,353,4.619047619047619
2949791,4,B000VSDNF0,"This is one of those movies that you will probably love or hate.  Since I routinely come across movies that I love and other people can't stand; or movies that I believe are the worst ever and others genuinely appreciate, I will relay a different type of review that I feel might give you a better perspective on what to expect with Melancholia.

First off, let me say this...I believe that just about everyone would agree that the music and cinematography are exceptional.  However, that obviously is not all that makes a movie.  So here goes. (I won't include any spoilers, btw.)

Melancholia is primarily about two sisters and how they relate to one another and to others in the face of the possible destruction of the planet.  This is not, I repeat NOT a science fiction film.  If you are expecting a wild element of sci-fi excitement there is only a small touch of that, although the effects are more than adequate.  This is a movie that takes its time exploring the relationships the two sisters have while revealing the depths and ever-changing energy of a person suffering from depression.

Kirsten Dunst plays the role of Justine, a young woman suffering from melancholia (a fairly antiquated term for depression).  Her sister Claire, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, takes it upon herself to watch over her and defend her from the repercussions of her actions, as well as those of others in response to her illness.  As in real life, depression often runs in the family and their mother, Gaby, (Charlotte Rampling) obviously suffers issues of her own.  This circumstance results in some of the best acting you will see, as Dunst and Gainsbourg very convincingly behave as though they have lived most of their lives together, dealing with the challenges of life and responding in their own, unique way.

And now comes the hard part.  Is this movie any good?  I'll take it from two different angles.

Have you ever been in an art museum and quietly reflected upon a painting that struck you as sad or dark, yet beautiful?  Did you sit there patiently and let it soak into your soul....absorbing the melancholy the artist must have felt when creating it?  If so, you will probably love this movie.  The title of the movie is appropriate not just because it is a term for Justine's illness or because the rogue planet is named Melancholia, but also because it captures the actual feeling of melancholy.  Just as a quality impressionist painting transmits the mood and feeling of a particular scene rather than how life-like it looks, this movie is a moving work of art that requires you to let your guard down and allow yourself to become part of the beautiful sadness and enjoy it as you did in front of that painting.

Do you typically guess at what is to come at a movie?  Do you try to figure them out as you are watching them and feel uncomfortable with slow scenes that do not appear to be advancing a plot?  If so, there is nothing wrong with that, but you will probably not like this one.

Looking for action?...not your flick.  Looking for romance?...sorry.  How about the good ole ""shaky camera"" trick?  There is a lot of that in here and I hate the shaky camera.  But I have to admit that I really enjoyed it in spite of that.  (way too much shaky camera if you ask me...WAY too much).

The bottom line here is this...if you had a hard week at work and need to see a movie that excites you without much thinking about it, or conversely, you are looking for something that challenges your brain to figure it out and exercise your skills in logic, or anything in between, you may not enjoy this too much.  This movie falls completely outside that linear line.  Melancholia is all about experiencing, and ever so patiently enjoying the under-appreciated feeling of wonder, beauty, and uniquely satisfying sadness...of melancholy.",1387238400,,3842,4.679582712369598

2949833,1,B000VSDNF0,"obviously this film is very polarizing, and i really play right into that. i got it. i really really did. i went into it knowing the Von Trier is a product of an education relying in part on German Expressionism, which is a very polarizing genre. from that respect, i knew i should be expecting a lot of sky shots, and he didn't let me down there! slow motion? BINGO! pretty much giving away the entire end game (not plot, there was none) in the opening sequence? absolutely! and the whole too loud music/ absolutely no music thing? got you covered!

and then the other shoe drops. this film was rife with symbolism, and it made the film really predictable. Tristan and Isolde? well, after reading the story was about two sisters who were both married at the beginning, you knew the husbands were out of the picture and  they were left to wander or get to a nunnery, so there that was. also... can i just say V.T.'s remarks about sympathizing with Hitler? Hitler's favorite composer was Wagner, a notorious anti-Semite. Tristan and Isolde was composed by... mhmm. just saying.

this film was very personal to V.T., who wrote and directed. my biggest issue with it besides the laughable predictability and excruciating slow pacing, was that it was so personal to him. this story was him trying to heal and reconcile the darkness within him through the characters; the different aspects of himself were very present in a Where The Wild Things are kind of way. Justine is the crippling physical toll and the relationship mistakes that we make in our despair. Claire is the loss of control when the spiral begins. Michael was the times when it's easier to let it go and walk away. John was when we want to give up, that selfishness that consumes you and turns the world into a singularity and you're in the middle of it, alone and desolate.  the mother, bitterness. the father, cowardice. every character represents an aspect of himself. so i get it, i do. i live in my own head that way (not quite the same cast... just kidding), so i don't have the energy to delve that deeply into his head with him. it was too deep to follow (as it were), but then presented only on the surface, which was discordant and jarring. There are plates, and there's the molten core, but no mantle present to shape the one or buffer the other.

but where does that leave us? good special effects. very single dimension acting, which was a damn bloody shame with that roster. both Skarsgards, and THAT'S how you use them??? oy. V.T.'s love of yellow and blue, which is just... his thing. shaky cameras? did he use a handheld machine for part of filming? hm.

i dunno. commentaries on how we live now and material possessions mean nothing when we're all worm food (or incinerated)... blah blah blah. it's been done, and better. so you'll love it or you'll hate it, just like you'll love or hate my take on it.",1384646400,6,2883,4.555984555984556

The film is visually beautiful, except for the stuff I mentioned in the first paragraph. The first half of the movie(the wedding party) comes off as pretentious and pompous, but I get the feeling that I'm not supposed to realize that, or I will be unsophisticated. The scenes at the wedding party, which is bankrolled by the husband of the bride's sister Claire (and don't you forget it!) are thick with meanness, deceit, selfishness, depression, etc. The bride, Justine, is very disappointing as a person, but she is mentally ill or something, so she gets a pass. After all, most of the other characters are at least as bad in their own ways. Things move very slowly here. I was trying to move the movie to 1.5 speed, but was unable.

The second half shifts gears, and we concentrate on the planet, Melancholia, which threatens to collide with the Earth. The film explores the role exchanges of the 2 sisters, as the stronger Claire is suddenly in need of the new calmness of the former bride--oh yeah, Justine's new husband had left her at the end of the wedding party because she obviously didn't want to be around him.

SPOILER......
.................
.................
At the horrific end, Claire's seemingly strong and reassuring scientist of a husband has apparently gulped all the suicide pills, so Claire, her son, and Justine are left to face the end of the world inside the teepee skeleton thing that Justine has built with her little nephew (Claire's son).  Claire is crying in the final moments, but strangely, the little boy is calm and emotionless, as if he were a prop. Of course, Justine is calm also, as that is part of what the director said he is trying to illustrate.

Although Christ is my Savor and I don't fear planetary doom, if you are easily discouraged and fearful, you may want to think twice about this one. There is a depressing heaviness about it, and after reading an interview with the director, I really think he wants the viewer to experience his depression.

2949840,2,B000VSDNF0,"This review contains a *spoiler alert for Fellinin's 8 1/2*

I watched the movie Melancholia several months ago, so all the details are not sharp in my mind, even while the essence of it had stayed with me for a long time. Quite frankly, I wasn't happy with the impression it made on me in the way most people are happy for having been impacted by a film. I have to compliment the visuals, which were really stunning, but it isn't worth watching for just that unless you were to fast forward through all the depressing mire of it's storyline.

I was not enriched in any way by watching Melancholia. I did not learn or gain anything of value. It did not make me think, only feel...dreadful. It's pretty, but that's all. There is nothing about any of the characters to like, not even the main character Justine, who I really wanted to feel sympathetic towards due to her struggles with depression. She comes off as harsh, empty, and unlikeable as her depression. I knew before watching the movie that the planet named Melancholia, on a collision course for earth, represented the director Lars Von Trier's struggles with depression, and as someone who struggles with depression can understand dwelling on dark thoughts, but why broaden that and include dark thoughts about destruction for THE WHOLE WORLD? What kind of person would want to impose their subverted homicidal desires in a film and have them played out as a fantasy, under the guise that it's a science fiction flick? I like a horror film to be a horror film, a science fiction film to be a science fiction film, and an abstract type art film to stick with that.

Oddly enough the movie Melancholia came to mind recently when I was watching Fellini's 8 1/2. 8 1/2 was about a director named Guido who can't find inspiration for his next film, so he goes to a spa near Rome to relax and thinks about his relationships. He went to be alone but everyone intrudes on him there, including his mistress and wife who he argues with, and then other people and memories from his past impinge on him. Supposedly the story Guido is working on is a science fiction epic, but in the end all he can think about is his relationships, so he ends up writing almost literal versions of his mistress, wife, and other people from his past into the movie as characters... It's now autobiographical as well as having a science fiction theme with religious overtones, and so it's now a confusing mess. In the end of 8 1/2 a writer character that Guido had been consulting with tells him he is right to decide not to go ahead and make it.

""Forgive men for quoting all the time. But we critics... do what we can. Our true mission is... sweeping away the thousands of miscarriages that everyday... obscenely... try to come to the light. And you would actually dare leave behind you a whole film, like a cripple who leaves behind his crooked footprint. Such a monstrous presumption to think that others could benefit from the squalid catalogue of your mistakes! And how do you benefit from stringing together the tattered pieces of your life? Your vague memories, the faces of people that you were never able to love...""

The character in that movie expresses how I feel about the film Melancholia. Von Trier should have had an abortion at some point, before he could give birth to such an unhappy film. It pretends to be many things it's not. For me it seemed like he was unleashing his inner demons in one large, disturbing homicidal fantasy. I suppose this might be an okay film to see if you lead a life of privilege or haven't experienced many disappointments, since it's mission seems to be to bring you down to the point where you are appalled by all the unlikeable characters, and then entertain thoughts about how it wouldn't be so bad if the world was ending. Hopefully if you don't know what it's like to feel sad and this movie hasn't brought you to where you have never been, a reaction hasn't occurred where you feel even more superior because you are better than all the unlikeable characters. I don't know how anyone can feel anything but mired down by a film like this, which is probably why there were sequences where Justine's favorite horse seemed to be melting into a golf course. I would not recommend this film to anyone who suffers from melancholy, since it is definitely not a cathartic type movie and only exacerbates feelings of sadness and angst.",1384041600,3,4409,4.604325699745547

The second part of the movie is a study of the personalities of the characters played by Dunst and Gainsbourg as the end approaches.

The movie is terrifying and disturbing, especially when Dunst says, ""I can see things, and we are alone and not for long.""

2949885,5,B000VSDNF0,"""Melancholia"" is a postmodern science fiction film dealing with families grappling with typical familial dysfunction issues in the shadow of the coming apocalypse; a recurring theme since Biblical times with the family unit standing in for general human society. It establishes this from the opening sequences that go from the observations of an approaching giant planet to a young bride who abandons her groom at the altar to go off to have sex with a stranger much to the consternation of her sister who is very prim, proper and orderly. This introduces another theme as the sisters represent the major opposing forces at work in the universe, order and chaos, the alternating between disintegration and integration speaking to some fundamental concerns of the human dilemma; what is the nature of our individual reality within the scope of infinitely larger framework of a shared existence; why are we here; is there a God of order and justice and does this God have a master plan or is it all meaningless? The film goes on to address these concerns and to go into any more detail is to ruin it for others so I won't other than to say that it does so in a manner that simplifies complexity by positing that we are who we are and we do what we do because given our existential circumstances what other recourse have we.
The films mood and tone reflect these concerns to great effect and the writing, characterization, casting and direction are genius especially Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg as the sisters Justine (justice, order) and Claire (clarity, clear) and Charlotte Rampling as their mother, Gaby (Gabriellia as in the heralding angel).

2949888,5,B000VSDNF0,"Five stars. How ironic to rate the splendid Melancholia and to be limited by stars. This film was exquisite and chilling and one of the best I've ever seen. It is not for those who seek giddy scary entertainment or terror in the form of gore. It is not fast-paced. It is dreamlike, and there is SO much to take in. My husband and I just ""discovered"" Melancholia and we, both artists, were awed and moved by it. The music (some of Wagner's most evocative), the visuals, and the characterizations were lush. I loved Kiefer Sutherland's role. Kirsten Dunst, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Charlotte Rampling, John Hurt. What a cast! All terrific. The possibility of the imminent end of life on earth resonated deeply. I'm a conservationist dealing with habitat loss and threats of species extinctions - work that occasionally overwhelms me due to grief over humans' unbelievable capacity for cruelty and for squandering animal life and habitat that took millions of years to evolve. There is sometimes a sense of helplessness that something vastly destructive and unavoidable is hurtling towards us - except it's our increasing human population and consumption that is the force behind the giant wrecking ball.

The film is set in an isolated mansion within a landscape devoid of intrusions and that is a testament to human-cultivated perfection. Pristine green lawns spread to the sea. Perfectly-pruned topiary lines the lawn like sentinels. Metaphors abound in the setting and in the most ordinary or tangential of details. Everyone seems idle and catered to. Justine is a raw wound. Her sister is shrouded in the protective bonds of marriage, motherhood, and wealth. There is no explanation for the source of their wealth except the vague sense that it is based on innovation or science. Did it protect them? I won't spoil it for you.

When the credits ended, I went outside to look at the night sky above a wilderness here in the northeast. Far from cities and light pollution, the night seemed unusually star-filled, with greater contrast between the bright stars and the black sky. The black appeared more vast and deeper than ever, probably because I was still a captive of the film. The thought that we are so alone, so distant, and that life on earth is rare, and possibly so rare that it is singular in the universe, is unfathomable. This film is an apocalyptic trip, a vision both horrifying and beautiful. The menacing, mesmerizing, ineffable sphere of Melancholia keeps drawing closer. Whether we are alone in the universe or not, for now and probably forever, this world is the only one we get.

Its very hard for me to confirm how many times a movie has actually made me force myself to stay awake promising to myself that the Plot will pick up somewhere along the way. In this movie it never does. First off I have to criticize the cameraman. I mean seriously wobbly, just all around terrible. It was one of those movies that reminded me that these were actors on a set. I like a movie that sucks you in and  makes you feel like you are watching something for real, like you are almost their. Peter Jackson for instance does this quit well in his films (Like King Kong, which was a master Piece). Now granted that comparison may not be far as the two movies are completely different. HOWEVER let me use Peter Jacksons' ""King Kong"" as an example of what a good movie NEEDS for it to be worth a damn, Character Development, Back Story, DETAIL, Connection to the story, plot, and characters. I will say this as well. In THIS movie Dunst played her part as well as one could. In fact the acting wasn't at all bad, what was however was the damn script. It was painfully dull. Also the lighting in the movie was bad. Even on max brightness at times you didn't know what you were looking at. Another serious problem was that all the characters did a 360 and swapped places, and you have no back story on any of them. I mean one scratches there head thinking what the hell are they talking about more than half the time because from beginning to end we know nothing about any of the characters aside from there personalities. We don't know why they are the way they are, and every thing starts spinning right at the beginning. Its like the writer wrote a middle and ending and no beginning and poof that was good enough for a movie. Also a 1 hour scene of wedding drama....wow, it was terrible. The  story never progressed either. Its like we have the middle part of the story and the ending is beginning in the last quarter of the movie and then that's it. Total disappointment here. Not happy one bit. Thankfully I rented it before buying so I saved myself the trouble. The actors were the only ones who did their part. The writers, director, and camera man need to get it together, seriously. You want good drama, watch ""Defiance"" or ""The Pianist"" among so many others.

Melancholia is NOT your typical end-of-the-world movie.

The controversial approach of a large asteroid that may or may not hit the earth - and you won't know for sure until the last few minutes of the movie - provides the undercurrents that motivate the characters.

The main theme in the movie, however, is the two sisters, chaotic Justine, played by Kirsten Dunst, and her sensible big sister Claire, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg,  They are like the sun and moon, or like the earth and the asteroid. As the movie progresses, Justine and Claire's adjustment to the approaching crisis gradually shifts the nature of their relationship.

The director guides Kirsten Dunst into an understated presentation of a melancholic. If you've never heard of Charlotte Gainsbourg before, you may be a huge fan by the end of the movie.

Director Lars von Trier uses the drama of Wagner's ""Tristan und Isolda"" to give the movie a brooding, Gothic air.

I can only conclude that the numerous bad reviews derive from popcorn movie enthusiasts expecting an action-packed, Bruce Willis-styled farrago of sweating protagonists, wide-mouthed screaming, and deafening explosions.

In this movie, the person who can best meet such a disaster is Justine, the depressed sister of the high-strung over-achiever Claire.

The movie starts at a wedding at Claire's posh digs.  Justine is entering into an episode of depression consequently breaks down on her wedding night, thus causing estrangement from those she should be loving towards.  As Justine's depression worsens, she must move in with Clair and her family to be cared for.

The rogue planet-it's headed towards earth.  Initially, it is expected to fly by and head out to deep space but it ends up getting diverted by Earth's gravity and swings around for a collusion.  When this happens, Justine-who has already been to the bottom through her psychological issues rallies her sister's family to meet their fate nobly.

This is a first rate performance by Kirsten Dunst.  Her expressions, her actions, her very speech match those suffering from the darkness of depression.  The movie is also brilliant in color, visual images, and music.  It is however, a bit slow.  An art house sort of classic.",1374105600,2,1237,4.889423076923077

2949992,2,B000VSDNF0,"Melancholia HAS to be one of the biggest disappointments -not to mention most misleading descriptions for a film- of all-time.  It says Melancholia is a science fiction movie.  Um... not a chance.  It's supposed to be about a planet heading for Earth and destroying everyone and everything that makes up our wonderful planet, but... it not only falls short of that, it spends too much time avoiding the *main* *purpose* of the storyline.  That being, the fear, sadness, confusion and eventual ending of planet Earth.  Showing the occasional appearance of a planet passing by in the sky isn't enough to define science fiction (despite how destructively beautiful it may have appeared, which is probably the only reason the film got the name ""science fiction"").

Where to start with this mess...

First of all, the first half is entirely pointless.  ENTIRELY pointless.  If you can find anything worthwhile about it, I guess you either don't care that you're not getting what you've tuned in for (planetary destruction) or you like long-winded weddings.  Oh wait, before I mention the wedding... the first 10 mintues is nothing but a heavily orchestrated, overlong, slow-moving montage of different events related to the collision of two planets.  However this scene is *so* long that you simply end up bored with it eventually.  It misleads viewers into thinking something much bigger and worthwhile is coming with unbelievable cinematography to boot, but sadly that's not the case.  However I will admit the way it's presented is somewhat enchanting and pretty to admire.  I can appreciate it on a much different level, at least.

Anyway, yes, Kirsten Dunst has an hour long wedding for the first half of the movie.  Basically a series of mishaps occur that eventually end up completely ruining the wedding, not to mention the mother and sister not exactly being supportive of Kirsten's wedding so they act like total jerks with bad attitudes while Kirsten is trying to celebrate the most meaningful day of her life.  What the HECK is this?  A planet is heading towards Earth.  But... a wedding is occurring with soap opera-quality drama instead.  Who came up with this crap?

Now the SECOND half of the movie is when some minor improvements occur.  It's now obvious that the planet is coming into Earth's territory and a collision is either inevitable, or that the people will be spared barring a miracle (I won't reveal which one).  Kiefer Sutherland does a remarkable job keeping everyone in his family at ease with his strong firm belief that the planet will veer to the side and miss Earth completely, however there's something really odd about this- nobody is showing believable concern that their lives very well could be over very soon, and quite tragically.  I don't get it.  However Kirsten Dunst going through an episode of depression I *guess* could actually happen, though I'd like to believe a depressed person wouldn't be in such a state given what's about to come.  I could be wrong, though.  It's hard to say how a depressed person would react to such an event.  It might even bring them peace, relief or happiness.

The ending is remarkable at least.  That's when the movie truly deserves 2 stars.  The final 15 minutes of confusion and the several ""What to do/where to go?"" moments are worth sticking with the 1 hour/40 minutes of boredom before this.  But MAN!  Why does a wedding have to dominate the first half?  What purpose does it serve, seriously?  If you think a wedding occurring under such unusual circumstances is abnormal, you're right, it is.  It'd be like a wedding taking place on Pearl Harbor during World War II.  Not the least bit believable.

The film laughably tries splitting up the story into two separate portions with two separate stories involving the two sisters, but the concept honestly fails since the wedding in the first part truthfully doesn't belong in such a film.  I have no idea why the movie writers felt the need to even split the movie into two separate stories.  Unless they didn't have enough writing for the second (more important) story.  They probably wanted to add a fresh twist to the old and familiar ""The world is coming to end!"" plotline, but this is NOT the kind of refreshment that works.

You've been warned with this one, folks.  I can almost gurantee you're NOT getting what you think you are with Melancholia.",1370217600,5,4383,4.874154262516915

2950025,5,B000VSDNF0,"In Melancholia, Trier has again returned to the subject that interests him the most: the end, death and all that involves. This is a strangely moving and beautifully filmed story of two sisters, one undergoing dashed hopes and melancholic depression, the other in control. In many respects, they epitomize the world filled with dreams and wishes for the future. But, now that the world has been taken beyond religious beliefs to scientific knowledge of the universe, we see those dreams about to be obliterated by the arrival of a previously unknown planet named ""Melancholia,"" which is set on a collision course with Earth. This unexpected visitant will, via a gravitational ""dance of death"" destroy the planet and all who reside there. Everything will have been for nothing. And there is no God in whom to seek succor.

Following her superb enactment in Antichrist, Charlotte Gainsbourg makes a major appearance in this movie, proving once again her superb skills as an actress. Although not the lead star, she outshines those around her by being so human. Kirsten Dunst and Kiefer Sutherland also perform beautifully in what is a strangely mesmerizing, almost hypnotic account of the end of life on this planet.

But this is not a sci-fi movie, the dance of death being almost incidental to the emotions and torn feelings being undergone by the characters themselves. Kiefer Sutherland's character cannot face the truth of it and suicides, the depressed Justine,resigns herself to the end, as many of us will, useless to help ourselves or those around us. For Justine, the world will go, not with a bang but with a whimper.

Charlotte's humanity, on the other hand, shines through to the end. For the sake of the child, she helps her sister, Justine, build an invisible protective tent constructed of fallen timbers which will become the last outpost of safety against the arriving cataclysm: ""the secret cave."" As we witness the end of all things arriving, Trier achieves a poignancy I don't think I have ever witnessed before in any movie. I cried. There they sat, the two distraught women and small boy, protected only by a few useless branches formed to make a tepee, awaiting the apocalyptic omega point: the end of all ends.

Here I depart from the opinions of the actors and propose that Justine does not become the stronger of the two sisters. She appears to turn more stoic, but it is a kind of blind stubbornness that overtakes her, a refusal to accept an end. This may well be an aspect of depression, but it is not normality. In Claire's case, however, we witness true humanity, the way we would all react to an inescapable apocalyptic end: we would sob our hearts out at the loss of a future, at childhood's end, and at the final realization that there is no God watching over us.

This is Trier reaching the peak of his performance. Unafraid to face the future.",1368489600,3,2878,4.817813765182186

2950068,5,B000VSDNF0,"I am starting to think that I should only watch films with mixed reviews. The people who hated Melancholia clearly know nothing about how fairy tales (i.e., Mrchen) actually end. Disney endings are an American invention, but  Lars von Trier follows the European Mrchen style, in which a ""happy ending"" is only the best possible outcome to an unfortunate situation. If you are looking for Disney's version of the Little Mermaid, forget it, but if you want to see something more like H.C. Andersen's 'Lille Havfrue,' this fits the bill. To some folks this may be a giveaway as to the ending, but it is worth it to see it through. I was a little distracted by the lead characters having different accents, though being related (one American and one British speaking sister?), but in the end decided it suited their personality differences enough to be forgivable, if not exactly the way I would imagine it. If you have ever read a Grimm brothers fairy tale in the original German and hated it, I would not imagine you would enjoy this film, but if you are the type who enjoys the complexities and melancholia of the Mrchen genre, then you should not miss this modern fairytale.",1365465600,4,1174,4.699029126213592

2950070,2,B000VSDNF0,"This Danish movie needed some editing, it starts off with a credits intro that goes for eight minutes where the director seems to think pressing pause and filming the paused image is something clever.  It might be unique in the film world but missed the point that there is an obvious reason why no one else has done it. That reason is it gets old fast, boring and then annoying. I ended up fast-forwarding to the end of the ridiculous intro, it was that hard to sit through. Even though Melancholia is a Danish made movie the actors speak English and not dubbed or anything like this.  I think Kirsten Dunst does a great acting job with her either mentally disabled or possibly simply severely depressed character Justine. We're never told over the two hours what's wrong with her but the film opens with her wedding and it becomes pretty obvious very fast that she's in no condition to consent to marriage and is simply there because her sister, and others want her to marry the guy. It therefore takes on a bit of a creepy vibe, the guy obviously wants to marry her because she is in a beautiful female adult body, but she clearly doesn't have the mind of an adult.  Even Sutherland's character, the husband of her sister has a creepy you remember our deal line after telling her off for the amount of money he's spent on the party (wedding) which she keeps trying to escape and hide away in different parts of the mansion, implying with the our deal line she's still got to fulfil certain bedroom duties for him when her a lot less attractive sister isn't around, even though she's marrying this other guy. So I do think Dunst does do a brilliant job, it's just the movie overall is so slow paced and dragged out and there is no real payoff for Justine that you end up wondering what the point of the 2hrs 16 minutes you spent watching it was.

The movie is divided into two acts the wedding and post wedding.  The later brings the fact from being a minor focus, to the main backdrop focus, that some planet which has been hiding behind the sun unnoticed all this time called Melancholia, is possibly going to crash into Earth. The makers of this film seem to want to turn your typical cartoon image of the moon rising over a lake into a planet rising over the golf course that was in the backyard of the Danish mansion everyone lives in. Even though you can't detect the curvature of the Earth in real life, somehow you can see it in this film.  Both acts 1 and 2 just seemed pointless, there was no payoff at the end of either. This is one of those movies once you've seen it you wish you'd done something else instead. The only thing reason really to watch it is that Dunst goes topless in a very arty pose at the hour and half mark, but you could probably just Google that image rather than buying this.",1364342400,6,2811,4.385796545105566

2950088,5,B000VSDNF0,"Okay, first off, let's be clear about what sort of movie MELANCHOLIA is NOT. It's not an action / adventure / disaster / science fiction movie. If you are looking for that type of movie, then seek out ARMAGEDDON, DEEP IMPACT, or WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE. Nope, this is Lars Von Trier's film about the insanity / fickleness of human emotions in the face of tragedy and loss. Yes, the Earth is in the path of a rogue planet named MELANCHOLIA, but this is more of a metaphor for what's happening to the characters on screen, than it is an actual event. The huge, impending doom of our dear planet is actually played down, almost until the very end. Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg are fascinating as the bi-polar Justine and her seemingly level-headed sister, Claire. From the opening, hilarious drive in the stretch-limousine, to the wedding catastrophe, to the ultimate climax, MELANCHOLIA is an uncomfortable story. However, Von Trier, like his (very few) peers, is concerned more w/ true humanity, than w/ anything pretty or cosmetic. With this film, he has outdone himself, even overshadowing his brilliant, ANTICHRIST. Quite a feat indeed! Highly recommended...",1363737600,4,1166,5.015463917525773

2950094,5,B000VSDNF0,"I was a little shocked to see roughly half of the reviews are 1 and 2 star.  Obviously this film is not for everybody.  Lars starts with enough borrowings from Kubrick's 2001, ie, classical music and sensuously crafted planetary images, to warn you that this is not your average science fiction movie.

Spoiler alerts
The apparently artsy f*rtsy sequences at the beginning of the movie are truly mesmerizing and they beat the s*** out of the average Hollywood introduction.  Later you find out they are all precognitions, or foreshadows.  Maybe I am not very sophisticated, but these slow motion sequences floating on top of Wagner are like nothing I have ever seen or heard of before.  They are original, really original, in an age of knockoffs, imitations, and sequels.

As the movie winds down, a person ought to be moved by the fact that only the melancholic Kirsten Dunst is possessed of clearheadedness and courage.  Of course, earlier, she is a train wreck to most of those around her, as any gorgeous melancholic usually is.  But she metes out a great deal of love to many of her relatives as well.  Her only really nasty side is the one that destroys her new husband and marriage - but she has her reasons, as he is needy and smothering, something a melancholic has to run from.  Is it possible he is a melancholic as well?  Her sister, apparently an anchor of reason and support, devolves into a blithering idiot, but not before showing us her own demons - she is haunted by terrors which may be larger than anything faced by anyone else.

The nicest, most rational, most stable, richest, and most charismatic person in the cast, Kiefer Sutherland, commits suicide when his family needs him most.  Is he the biggest melancholic in the story? Or just the least courageous?  Wow, that seems depressing, but it is supposed to!

A Danish film maker might be expected to grab a couple of ""character"" Nordics for seasoning, and Stellan Skarsgard and Udo Kier are wonderfully up to the task. Stellan is his usual porcupiny self, and Kier actually provides understated and still hilarious comic relief.

The writing is great, the production is great, the acting is stellar. I am not sure about the science, but, Jeez, ""The Matrix"" started with absolute crap science and everybody moved on rather quickly.  If you don't like the movie, you probably had an unyielding preconception of what the movie was going to be and you're upset that you were wrong.  For the rest of us, I think this was what every great dramatic work always is - peerless character development couched in an unpredictable plot.

So now I have to do the big finish of my review: The medical condition of melancholia isn't the worst thing in the world, and there are other things that will kill you faster.  In the end, only the melancholics are properly connected to reality.  Even when a gigantic planet enmeshes you and pulls you apart, you can still keep your dignity.

This is my recommendation so take it with a grain of salt. As an independent scriptwriter I love this film. It continues his theme of mental illness which he brought painfully to the screen in Antichrist. In Melancholia it's about depression, which Von Trier has personally fought.
With that put aside, the first part is difficult and can be infuriating or absorbing- you need some patience. As Kirsten Dunst falls into her depression is palpable. The second half is a touch of science fiction. Dunst raises her game to her best performance on screen I recall. I'll save the rest for those who wish to see it.

2950121,4,B000VSDNF0,"MELANCHOLIA is a rather slow-moving, very European-flavored drama that is driven more by dialogue and nuance than it is by plot and tension: There is virtually no fast action or violence as we know it here. It does get a little draggy in places, like a long novel that takes its time with meticulous character development. Anyone who finds this description unappealing should probably avoid this one.

Having said that, I found the acting--particularly that of the central ""depressive"" characters played by Dunst, Gainsbourg, and the young Cameron Spurr--quite outstanding. Combined with the painstaking cinematography and slow-burning but solid storyline, the result is a film that is amazing on many levels. MELANCHOLIA is a serious comedy that is different without being deliberately weird.

Part I concerns itself with Justine (Dunst)'s wedding party at the lavish estate of her sister Claire (Gainsbourg). I won't tell you what happens, but some interesting stuff does. There is also finely embedded satire on the corporate world and familiar relations, with special focus on snooty rich people. The characters are all silly in their own special ways, making for a very fine human comedy.

Part II is told from the point of view of Claire. A character who was quite dislikeable in Part I is humanized here. Claire's public rich girl front is believably gone, and the two sisters, apparently complete opposites in Part I, are shown to be very much alike. On this note, the theme in the title becomes evident. Claire's son Leo (Spurr) becomes a kindred spirit with his mother and aunt as the rogue planet Melancholia (to be taken literally, metaphorically, or both) approaches Earth. Once again, some intriguing stuff happens, ending with a climax that is predictable but apropos.",1362009600,2,1783,5.162629757785467

Few filmmakers use what I consider ""negative space"" quite as well as he does; that is, those moments of such visual and aural stillness that they bear at least the same weight as those dense with action and/or dialog. von Trier is really a genius at translating the abstractness of emotional states into narrative. (The Antichrist is another stunning work of art.)

I came back to it a few months later and I'm glad I did. I thought this was a movie about a bunch of rich spoiled folks...I was wrong.

The main female character is getting married but there's a problem, she's neurotic and depressed. She hasn't really developed a good defensive lie of character like almost everyone else around her. Her soul is naked and she feels exposed and at the same time she sees through everyone else's lies and it is destroying her. She sees the horror of life in front and behind her and the terror of death before her. She sees it and feels it and can't stop these feelings or this pressure.......Everyone gives up on her except her sister.

When it looks like the whole world is going to be destroyed she handles it better than anyone else because she's lived with this terror all her life and now the suffering may come to an end......Maybe the underlying cause of depression is knowing what life is really about, without illusions and not being able to express it or understand it. Van Tier is definitely on to something here.....

This movie is not just a science fiction drama about the end of the world, it's about death and the lies that we tell ourselves everyday so that we can get to the end ........ It doesn't matter if the world ends with a bang or a whimper, it's coming.......get ready.

  Now, I have to say that, in my opinion, the fact that I've watched, & liked, Lars Von Triers' movies before, may have a good bit to do with my enjoying this style of film-making, but it certainly doesn't account for my coming out at the end of the story feeling that this may be his finest work & a masterpiece, as well. It's the best movie I've seen in years.
  Not a life affirming flick (thank Jeebus), but there are plenty of those out there if that is what you're looking for. Yet, movies that catch a reflection of truth from the corner of their eyes, are oh so needed, & far between, especially for those of us who feel the majority of heartwarming, life-affirming fare, like yet another kick in the gut.

2950169,5,B000VSDNF0,"This is the most effective and emotionally powerful movie I have ever seen on what it is like to be the Identified Patient in a family.

""Also called the ""symptom-bearer"" or ""presenting problem"" - may display unexplainable emotional or physical symptoms, and is often the first person to seek help, perhaps at the request of the family.""

Even though the family expresses concern for the IP, they subconsciously react to her improving by trying to reinstate the status quo.

She enacts what may be an implicit familial call for help- as with seeing juvenile delinquency as a coded cry for help by a child on his parents' behalf. Subconsciously becoming sick to prevent worse things happening in the family, such as a total family breakdown.

The IP is actually doing pretty well at the beginning of the film, but is going to an extremely elaborate wedding planned by her sister. The family demand that she be 'happy' is another rejection of her self, putting more pressure onto her to be content so that the family can feel okay. Her sister no doubt insisted or shamed her into having this kind of a huge wedding...

By making her 'wellness' the center of the family attention, they focus on HER as the problem, and if she can be fixed all will be well....thus avoiding awareness of the immense pain they all feel and of just how bad things truly are....also it is a way of blaming her for their dysfunctions...a kind of emotional release value, letting off steam when it gets too hot.

Of course this focus on and demand for her 'happiness' only enrages and traps her, and acts pushes her into relapse.

She probably choose her groom because, under it all, he was like her family though not as obviously.

The scene when he wants to have sex, and she asks 'can I have a moment?' Yet he does not understand, he wants what he wants, and his ego is at stake. He abandons and uses her just as the family did...there is NO one there for her as she is disintegrating, the abandonment of both her husband and father are devestating, but not unfamiliar.

No matter what she does, she is trapped. The system is designed like that.

Her sister alternately treats her with tenderness and care, and then berates and bullies her when she can't get into the tub without help, or when she isn't ready to go riding, or when she is late for the wedding, starts to fall apart at the wedding after being in contact with her family again, of course...

That is why she can say, ""You think I'm afraid of a planet?"" For after having lived in the Hell of this family, with the cruelest Mother I have EVER seen in cinema, the impending end to earth seems like almost a blessing.",1359590400,5,2655,4.521920668058455

It has wonderful cinematography and the performances are very good. But in my opinion, the movie does too little with a really fantastic premise, and I don't mean it should have been a ""disaster movie"". The first half of the movie is terribly slow, showing in hundred different ways how ""melancholic"" the character Justine is. Kirsten Dunst's Justine seemed rather schizophrenic than melancholic - considering how she acted during her wedding. It also made the character very unlikeable.
The second part centers on her sister Claire, and the tempo improves (even though there is never any doubt how the movie will end). I liked the second part much more, as there is more interaction among the characters. Charlotte Gainsbrough as Claire is very believable and compelling. She was my favorite character in the movie.

2950197,3,B000VSDNF0,"This opens with a prologue in very, very, very slow motion that seems to last ages. If Zach Snyder (The Watchmen, 300) directed this movie people would immediately troll him on the internet. But this film gets a pass among film critics because Lars Von Trier, who is considered an auteur, directed this.

Its a story of two sisters facing the apocalypse and how they react to it. One gives in to her instinct and accepts the doom albeit in a very depressed fashion. The other sister denies the inevitable and relies on science to soothe her, and panics when faced with the truth.

It has some very nice visuals that seem to be stills (maybe they where), recalling work by Tarsem Singh (The Fall, Immortals). The pacing is slow and deliberate, and picks up speed by the second sisters story.

There are illogical and unrealistic situations in this film. The type of approaching apocalypse should have had killed everyone before it finally happened. The setting is also one of total isolation for the main characters in the film, although privileged and situated in a sprawling estate, there are no looters, rioters, crazies or any other sort of people in their sphere of existence. Im guessing this is supposed to be one of those surreal movies.

Nice but Ill only recommend it to hardcore film buffs. I even had pricey craft beer and cheese with this, still didn't do well with me.",1358121600,2,1381,4.694214876033058

I think the Justine character is magnificently well acted as a realistic victim of major depression who sabotages her life but comes easily to terms with the end, while her sister (who can at some point cross an uncrossable bridge) cannot bring herself to accept the end. This is a film to think about for a good while after seeing it, and then see it again for details that one missed the first time. I'm not a great fan of von Trier's earlier work, but I think he is finally coming a bit down to Earth. Anybody who has dealt with major depression will relate to the Dunst character and find this portrayal quite true to life and intriguing.",1358035200,8,742,4.232394366197183
2950199,5,B000VSDNF0,"A tale of two sisters. If we don't look too closely, Justine and Claire seem totally different, even polar opposites. Yet they have one important thing in common. Both are insulated from ordinary experience, but each in her own extreme. Claire lives a pampered life in a gated mentality. She strives to attain an uninterrupted state of being happy, aided and abetted by obscenely rich husband John who is dedicated to keeping her on a diet of 100% artificial sweetness no matter what ugliness reality would offer.  Anything that might disrupt her fragile version of being happy is summarily vanquished from awareness.  Justine's psychological self-exile is all numbness and pain. Immune from Claire's comical complacency, her reflexive urge to look beneath the surface of everything and everybody has condemned her to the role of an isolated outsider who believes life is evil. Jack the CEO, Michael the dreamer, John the empiricist, everyone is repugnant, ridiculous, and wrong. She suffers an oppressive awareness of life's ubiquitous violence. She knows no niche of warmth and love. Her futile efforts to belong collapse into complete withdrawal. She does not suffer alone for long, however, for Claire crumbles when condemned to a horror she can't escape, the approach of the planet Melancholia. Melancholia is an all-in-one symbol for the accumulated baggage of civilization (mental and environmental), the end of the world, the destruction of Claire's/western values, and Justine's nihilist mentality. Justine welcomes Melancholia as a resolution to her life-is-evil quandary, she even identifies with it (the mystical nude scene). Revitalized, Justine tries to comfort Claire with her spirituality, but neither sister could ever comfort the other.

Wagner presented a similar vision of the world in his opera ""Tristan and Isolde"" and especially ""The Ring"" cycle of operas. We hear the prelude to Tristan and Isolde in the first and last scenes, and at other moments of compassion in between. In Melancholia this music represents the Wagnerian concept of Transcendence through Love, the idea that love lets us peacefully accept inevitable death. This theme is the musical equivalent of Justine's Magic Cave.  In the final scene we see Wagner's music.

This compassionate film about compassion is von Trier at his best.  He is pensive from the heart.  If he can't save the world, then he wants to console it.  As in all great films, each contributor is thoroughly in tune with its messge and devoted to its artful presentation. This is a huge accomplishment, given that the film engages us with unconventional ideas in a mixture of cultural traditions without lecturing or seeming contrived.",1358035200,2,2696,5.268065268065268

Okay, it was very visually artistic.  The beautiful sets, costumes, and scenes with in slow motion that you could dry paint to.  True.
But for me, artistic does not a good movie make.  If Kirsten Dunst is the main character, all I saw, was a couple scenes with her standing there, doing something with her hands.  That doesn't hook me to her as a character.  And she didn't even have to be speaking (though that would have been a plus), but who the gosh-darn-darn is she? What is her life like? Where is the action in the story? Where is the challenge she is presented with, and must overcome as a character (i.e. the whole foundation of a good story).

- there is a scene of Dunst, suffering from depression or melancholia, where she is unable to bathe, walk, or do anything, except to sleep. It is this scene of someone so suffering from depression that she cannot even engage in the living which struck me, that depression, if worse enough, is an illness that creates suffering, and robs one of even the simple acts of living, or engaging in life activities itself. This cost of depression was what struck me afterwards, that depression robs you of time, robs you of even engaging in life, simple or otherwise.

- i dunno about the last half, was it Dunst character, because she suffered so much that she saw the end of the world as being something to free her from her suffering? or was it more that Gainsborough's character had more to live for, son, husband, good life, that she feared losing it all?

- the wedding was annoying, i felt like punching Dunst to get real or to get with it, how could she have gone so far, pretending, and leading other people in thinking otherwise? It was like she was mis-leading other people or acting in bad faith, to those who simply cared about her.

It is impossible to deny that this film is a very impressive piece of film making. Many people might not see a point to it all. It does ""drag,"" but it's not a movie that will spoon feed you the details. Even to those who understand it, it can be painful to watch, but in a good way.

To me, ""Melancholia"" is about depression. The planet is a metaphor for the state of mind that depressed people are in; there is always a feeling of impending doom or a ""what's the point? we're all going to die anyway"" mentality. Once the main character's brother in law, who had been skeptical and frustrated with her state of mind, realized what was really going to happen, he killed himself without thinking twice about it. Once he felt, in a tangible sense, what his sister in law had been feeling, it hit him like a kick in the balls and he didn't even think twice about suicide.

This film is exactly like an art-house version of the video for Radiohead's ""Just,"" or at least that's what it reminds me of.

A slow moving film with shaky cam for ""realism"" and wooden acting may be great for someone who thinks that this style flies in the face of Hollywood excess, but for me this movie was a pretentious slug fest that looked like an amateur effort throughout.  Maybe I'll give it another try later and see if I can become an insider into the heavy world of symbolism and shaky cam realism but I doubt it.  Incidentally shaky cam does just the opposite for me usually as far as getting me deeper into the mix of the film by it being ""realistic"".  I don't view the world with a shaky cam view so how is this realism?  Oh, for the great filmmakers of the past making a reappearance and throwing shaky cam and wooden acting into the trash can where they belong!",1352246400,5,1093,4.302439024390244

Both my wife and I got so motion sick that we started fast forwarding through the movie because we were close to throwing up.

What did I find less than entertaining?

#1 The shaky camera.  Reminded me of home videos and added nothing to the realism.
#2 The slow pace.  This one really dragged.  Not just as a change of tempo, this movie dragged on and on.  The closest thing to action throughout most of this effort at cinema was the constantly shaking camera.
#3 The obsession with clinical depression.  As an element in the movie it might have worked.  It didn't just dominate the movie, it was the movie.  The movie should come with a Surgeon General's warning that it could be dangerous to mental health.
#4 The bad science.  I accept that strict adherence to science isn't always desirable in a motion picture, but no catastrophic effects of a gas-giant planet approaching the earth until the moment of impact is so implausible that it renders everything on the shaky screen  unbelievable.

Kirsten Dunst is superb as the clinically depressed bride who forgoes wedded bliss, nepotism and all the evils of the world for the sanity of Melancholia. Melancholia is the planet that is on a collision course with Earth. As it gets closer she becomes more lucid and emotionally lithe. Her care-taker sister is the one who loses it. The denial of the sister is the very thing that would save the world in the by now banal action-packed film in which Sigourney Weavers and Will Smiths save the day with lasers or some other human ego invention. The last scene of the film makes it quite clear that everybody dies.",1351468800,3,665,4.55
2950274,1,B000VSDNF0,"(There are some spoilers here; but most are expected anyway - and noted on the DVD case's back )

This is a wedding story with all love lost (except for a mother-child tableau, ending in wistfully, lovingly dying together). And too, an elegant celebration of depression, self- indulgence and delusion (actors and director included). Which the title certainly conveys.
No surprises anywhere.

The wedding guests have all lived The Good Life; all that can be bought is theirs. For these ultra-uppers, money is of no consequence.

The pace is turgid,'funeriaile' (yes,'old french),
everyone's insouciant worldly upper-class gentry;
Melancholia seems very European.

Characters are gourmands in everything from foods to aplatinum chain of indulgences. Everyone plays at being gay, but still anesthetized by all they have, do, seen and done to excess; vacuously effete and then some.

They've gathered for the wedding of a manic-depressive (In New Age speak: bipolar) bride who arrives hours late with a smiling, shrugging 'sorry'. Guests barely notice, so into themselves are they. The oblivious groom just coo's endearments and grovels.

Add to the charade the wedding night is just before a planet smashes into a doomed earth (or maybe not); but first, the bride to be gets it on/off with a wage slave mild guy guest from her ad agency (a job she evidently does to simulate purpose)in a sand trap on the mansion grounds; throughout this is an orgy of not-caring.

Is this deadly movie in so many ways, a parody or a slap
at rich folk or rabid self-indulgence/self and audience-loathing of its director?

And this this indulgence got awards at Cannes?
That's a cynical joke or parody in itself.

Some beautiful images but the plot, such as it was, was asinine; the characters were wooden, even though many of them are excellent actors; and von Trier's passion for extended cuts made the film seem to take forever. Oh and then the physics (or lack of it). A rogue planet is approaching the Earth? From where? Perhaps von Trier read an article one day about the risk of an asteroid hitting the Earth and confused ""planet"" with ""asteroid"" but the image is that of a planet. Why is Hollywood so lazy when it comes to getting physics right? Rockets that make right angle turns, guns that go whoosh in a vacuum and now a planet that approaches the Earth without anybody noticing and without any gravitational effects.",1351296000,4,819,4.503355704697986

Melancholia can be exquisitely beautiful if you allow it to be. However, I'm going to start sounding very artsy here: the first time I watched it sober, it was decent. But like everyone else, I'm more easily pulled more toward movies like John Carter.

Watched it quite inebriated with herbs the next time, and the experience was groundbreaking. I'd quite recommend going this route, as this movie is at heart about empathy and pain, and both are incredibly real with the use of substances.",1350518400,3,857,4.8231292517006805

I can stomach the notion of two sisters with completely different accents.  But the bizarre assertion that somebody who correctly guesses the number of beans in a jar has special authority on all the planets orbiting the three hundred sextillion stars in the known universe? Um... no.

That aside, yes the movie is beautifully filmed.  Dunst does a good job in her role and as someone who is very well acquainted with depression, I found her character believable.  Unfortunately, the rest are very stilted, though the fault seems to be in a script that can't decide whether it's the twenty-first or the eighteenth century.

Ultimately, what's frustrating about this movie is that with just a little more common sense and verisimilitude, it could have been fantastic.  As is, it will probably appeal mainly to more pretentious movie-goers who incorrectly surmise that art and believability are mutually exclusive (despite beautiful films like American Beauty and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind proving otherwise).

The cinematography here is outstanding, the ""choreography"", if you will, pure genius, and the acting/direction of the highest quality. Not a film made to please the ""masses"". It's not Spielberg or Howard. This film, like Bergman's, deals with the complexity of feelings and the interaction of its characters. It is by far the best performance ever by Dunst, and where has the brillant Charlotte Gainsbourg been all my life (what a ""face"" packed with character). The demise of the planet is merely a set-technique to add drama and a background to a fascinating saga of psychological character.

No buildings exploding or death defying car chases...just...four people slowly realizing that time has run out, and each dealing with it in his or her own, slightly dumbfounded way.

I was more moved by this movie than any of the big apocalypse blockbusters that have tried to do the same thing.  This is, I think, how the world might end.  Not with a ""bang"" but a whimper, as the poet once wrote.

It took me a full hour after I'd seen it to be able to think straight, and longer to decide what I thought and why.  But I think I've put it into words as best I can.

2950313,4,B000VSDNF0,"Like most Lar von Trier's movies, this one is not easy to watch.  It is a complex film that requires undivided attention.  Great selection of actors delivers set of characters that help define two sister Claire and Justine in all their complexities.  This film is shot at the beautiful chateau and everything about the film is visually pleasing: from the scenes in part 1 where Justine, newly married young woman, has her wedding reception funded and organized by her sister and her brother-in-law; to the scenes in part 2 where some shots of a beautiful planet Melancholia in all its fantasic shine is simply breathtaking.  Many of the scenes from this film remind me of the beautiful scenes from the movie ""Tree of Life"".

At her wedding reception Justine does her best to appear happy: her groom is handsome and attentive, her sister plans her wedding to the smallest detail, the event is catered and organized in a beautiful castle with garden that is zen-like.  But Justine is not herself and she manages in a single night to alienate herself from her family, break up her new marriage and say some things to her employer that very few people would dare to speak out loud - ever.  Justine's emotional meltdown is overtaking her and all around her.

In the second part, Justine's sister Claire decides to take her on after Justine has nervous breakdown.  Justine, a houseguest with indefinite need for rest, joins Claire's family.  Claire's husband John who is an amateur astronomer tells them about planet called Melancholia that is dangerously close to earth.  It is uncertain if this planet will hit earth an cause destruction, or if it will barely miss the collision.  As Claire panicks on how best to manage this impending disaster, Justine calmy observes the world around her.  To her, world is dead already and the only capacity she has left in her is to transition the living into this new stage of being when one is so separated from their surroundings they can only stand on the sideline and help others transition into the new state of existance.

Personally, I enjoyed this film, but I know it is not meant for wide audiences.  It is an art movie that tackles some sensitive emotional, psychological and philosophical questions.  This is also visually pleasing movie with beautiful music that surround this compelling and very personal story.",1347840000,6,2358,4.8575
2950314,4,B000VSDNF0,"Reviewer Sever clues us in on Lars Von Trier suffers from unipolar depression.  So does Sever and so do I.  Thus, this movie was no mystery for us as melancholia is a state of emotional mood.  Kirsten Dunst is Melancholia personified right from the start of the movie, although it may not be apparent to most as she smiles a lot during her wedding reception. After meeting her parents, John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling, her state of emotional health should come as no surprise.

Juxtaposed with this is the planet Melancholia which is on collision course with the earth. Although Keifer Sutherland, her brother-in-law, exudes false euphoria that we will avoid destruction by it, Dunst knows better because she accepts such sad facts more easily. She can see the end of the world easily because she is always perched on her own personal end of the world each day.

Her sister, Charlotte Gainsborough, is initially convinced all will be well but she starts to unravel as the planet looms ever closer. As we move closer to the climax, the three central figures are the two sisters and the young son of the Gainsborough character.

The imagery is exquisite throughout and the beginning of the film is an incredible montage of images which will all be covered by the film.

Lars Von Trier is an acquired taste.  Do I like this as much as the first film of his I ever saw, ZENTROPA? No, but that isn't the point.  These are art films and it requires a different perceptual set to appreciate his work.  If you have no artistic inclination, you will probably hate all of his work. If you are very arty, you will probably want to explore his work.

2950355,5,B000VSDNF0,"Once the credits begain to roll at the end of Melancholia, the only word I could think of was ""Wow!"" Lars von Trier is one of those directors whose films either blow you away or leave you cold, a quick glance at the reviews section will show you that. I found Melancholia to be a beautiful, depressing, involving, and ultimately rewarding experience. The film is divided into three chapters, with the opening prologue leaving me breathless. The other two chapters are entitled ""Justine"" and ""Claire"". ""Justine"" opens with Kirsten Dunst and Alexander Skarsgrd on the way to their wedding reception, were they arrive late. This takes place at her sister Charlotte Gainsbourg's (in a terrific performance) and Kiefer Sutherland's mansion. The second chapter, Claire, is were we find out earth could possibly collide with another planet named, you guessed it, Melancholia. I don't want to give anything away, because the film works so well when you have no idea what could happen. I think this is the best performance Kirsten Dunst has ever given, her character isn't sympathetic per se, but you can't take your eyes off her. I never had the feeling that I was watching actors reading lines on the screen, instead I felt like I was eavesdropping on private conversions. Lars von Trier gives the film a documentary tone in several of these scenes and it works perfectly. As the film unfolded I begin to feel the characters dread right along with them. Melancholia is a dialogue driven film, but it never once becomes boring. It won't appeal to all taste, but I found it to be a masterpiece, both as a piece of storytelling and a master class in acting. I definitely recommend you give the film a chance. Bravo!",1347667200,,1705,4.802721088435374
2950356,1,B000VSDNF0,I was really surprised at how depressing this movie really was. Melancholia. Why didn't I put the title and the contents of the movie together? I could not get into it. I really tried. I woke up and watched as they all got destroyed as a family. Who wants to watch stuff like that? Perhaps there was something deeper to be conveyed here. I consider myself to be an eclectic viewer when it comes to movies but this was one was a stretch for me.,1347494400,4,443,4.223529411764706
2950357,3,B000VSDNF0,"I think I was expecting a lot more action in this movie because I ended up being rather disappointed during most of it. And a little annoyed by Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and how she behaved. Maybe that's a testament to her acting ability that she was so easily able to irk me. Or I just don't like her, but I've liked her in other movies so it's probably not that.

I hate whispery dialog and this movie is full of it so maybe I missed something important that might have explained some things that didn't make sense. A lot didn't make sense but at least you know going in how it's going to end so there's something to look forward to. In the beginning I was rooting for the big sha-bang at the end, because the first half of movie just drags and it's just unfortunate it takes so long to get there. And if the first half is too slow, too whispery, and too long for you too, getting to the end takes f-o-r-e-v-e-r.

I read another review about this movie that said it helps knowing the character Justine suffers from melancholia, and maybe it would have but I guess we're supposed to know one of them does considering the name of the movie but Melancholia is also the name of the planet coming towards Earth, so on the flip side maybe not. It might have helped to see previews too, though we know previews show only the best parts usually.

About three quarters of the way through I started to feel this anxious feeling. Because until the last few minutes or so you really don't know for sure if the end (that you read in the movie description) will come. It's really easy to believe Claire's (Charlotte Gainsbourg) husband (Kiefer Sutherland, especially if you're a 24 fan!) when he assures her that Melancholia will do a fly by and not hit earth.

Too easy.

But soon you know. And then the end is coming and maybe you feel what they feel, and what seemed like a bad movie initially (for the first hour, really) has an ending that redeems itself somewhat.

Only somewhat.

Visually it was beautiful, no denying that. But too dark --and I don't mean the context, I mean the lighting in the movie in many scenes was so dark you couldn't really see anything. Implications aside, a little light is better than ""hey guess what that is"" in most cases. Especially when combined with the whispery dialog and scenes that don't seem to make sense while you're watching them.

When this movie ended I thought ""ugh stupid movie!"" but, having thought about it some more, whatever the point was supposed to be, (over my head or not) it's still with me. The visuals, the characters, the idea of a planet on a possible collision course with Earth.

So for the less high brow crowd that won't likely dissect and explain every nuance and angle, maybe that was the point. To make a statement. (any statement, like look at me! watch my movie! remember me!!)

OK, point taken.

Just know, for those who haven't seen it, this is not your average movie. It's slow, quiet, dark, and the big sha-bang you read about in the description and reviews --- well you'll have see it --- but you have a long way to go to get there, and, maybe like me, you'll give in a little, get into it some, and feel that slow build of the end coming.",1347235200,3,3204,4.39527027027027
2950358,3,B000VSDNF0,"Melancholia is visually stunning. The cinematogaphy is captivating and beautiful. The acting is also well done. But the storyline is disturbing.

This movie jabs at your psyche in the same manner as Black Swan, compelling you to watch and wanting to turn it off at the same time.

2950362,5,B000VSDNF0,"It's bugging me that I'm only seeing 3 stars beside this masterpiece of a movie, so I decided to write my own review. In a world full of reality tv garbage and blockbuster movies apparently aimed at further lobotomizing today's sheepish society, I found this movie quite refreshing. Anyone who gives it a negative review or describes it as ""slow"" obviously did not ""get it"" (too much reality tv?) and clearly chose it only because Kirsten Dunst is in it (in her best performance, in my opinion). It's definitely aimed more toward we existential types and less toward, say, people who want to see a ""feel good"" Kirsten Dunst movie (which, this is most definitely not). The cinematography was breathtaking (truly, like moving art)--particularly in the beginning and end (I love Lars' slow-mo shots). The acting and directing were brilliant. The story line was incredibly poignant and, I think, quite relevant today. We do seem to be spiraling into the depths of shallowness these days. One might almost welcome an otherwise terrifying cataclysmic event to put an end to it all.

Charlotte Gainsbourg is flipping amazing in this movie--as was Kirsten Dunst. I felt quite sorry for Charlotte's character and how she tried, in spite of her own fear, to guide her sister (Dunst's character) through HER anxiety. Kirsten's character's downward spiral was also brilliantly acted. She almost seemed to adopt a sense of complacency toward the end--her way of dealing with the situation. Kiefer Sutherland's blind optimism was also well portrayed. Von Trier did such a great job of highlighting how different people deal with anxiety in different ways. I understand he suffers from depression himself, so this is not foreign territory for his psyche.

In a nutshell, I loved this movie. I've seen it twice and intend to own it. Lars Von Trier gets alot of flack about the controversial nature of his films, but I think he is a true artist--completely unafraid to bare his tormented soul to the world. This one was his masterpiece. If you want a break from the crap that pollutes our movie and tv screens today and have a creative, philosophical mind, I highly recommend Melancholia. Love it or hate it, you won't forget it.",1346457600,9,2212,4.927613941018767

2950376,3,B000VSDNF0,"Reviewed by Amanda Jane Volovik ""Chava"": The 'co-plot' surrounds two sisters who are 'melancholic' and our snapshots into their rich and dysfunctional lives. Of course, the name of the planet is an analogy for the sad atmosphere of the film, no great revelation there. Kirsten Dunst as the bride with a case of Major Depression did okay with the languid, time-stands-still movie style she was given to work with. Her sister, Charlotte Gainsbourg, just has a way about her in every modern movie she's in that's hard to watch, the only place I saw it fit is when she starred in 'Jane Eyre' and other period pieces. Gainsbourg's almost ghostly presence, ready-to-faint vulnerability, and shock-filled, open-mouthed stares in related scenes is so..very...'DONE'. I'm OVER it. I just didn't feel any compassion for Gainsbourg's grating character here - close-up scenes of her angst went on eternally.

***Possible Spoiler Alert***I gave this three stars  because the concept around a planet coming near the earth and its analogy to a family in crisis was quite well done here. I enjoyed the realistic visuals of the planet and its gradual movement, which added suspense. No continuous rain of fireballs coming towards earth or dramatic atmospheric/environmental changes as other movies depict.",1345766400,,1288,5.247572815533981

You can be depressed without being a jerk.  Kirsten Dunst's character is a jerk, who happens to be depressed.  I just wasn't buying the whole ""I'm depressed, my life is terrible, I make bad choices"" thing.  The plot was painfully slow.  Whatever the movie was trying to achieve, I freely admit that I didn't get it.  Hated this movie.",1345766400,5,496,4.556818181818182

I had forgotten that Lars was the guy that did 'Dancer in the Dark' and 'Breaking the Waves'. Both fantastic films, except for that dated hand-held technique. Had to leave the theater on both occasions.

That old passe hand-held thingy that some directors insist on using gets a bit old real quickly (for me). I'm always left wondering if maybe there wasn't enough money in the budget for a tripod?!?

Anyway, for what I was able to see, this was a wonderful film, but certainly not for everyone.

I wonder if they'll come out with a widescreen-tripod version?

2950379,3,B000VSDNF0,"This was an odd sort of movie. Divided into two part, it seemed very disjointed. It had the feeling of being shot with a hand held camcorder. Alexander Skarsgard is in the 1st part but not the 2nd part.  Poorly timed. Some parts dragged on and on and other parts of the movie ran well. Intense musical score makes this feel like a silent movie. If you are a fan of any of the 3 major players you may enjoy the movie.

I really was surprised at all the one star reviews complaining that it was totally boring, I mean my 14 year old sisters got through this fine. I guess people just went in expecting something else. This movie isn't supposed to make you feel excited or happy. It's pretty much supposed to do the opposite. Anyways, I found the movie to be amazing. It creates a beautiful portrait of depression and it's filled with small details you won't notice till a second watch. I'd highly recommend this, just know what to expect.",1345420800,3,581,4.490566037735849
2950382,2,B000VSDNF0,"I saw trailers for this and I was intrigued.  A friend told me she was going to watch it at a small theater in town that plays independent movies.  As somebody who has personally suffered from depression I can say they captured the lethargy and apathy exquisitely.  Only problem is that is captures the lethargy and apathy of depression exquisitely.

Psychologically (and don't take this as gospel as I'm definitely not an authority here), depressed people are the only ones who can appreciate how well they've captured the languid, apathetic drifting that depressed individuals show.  Depressed people don't need to be reminded of how they are depressed.  People who aren't depressed are going to look at this and most likely get depressed.

My first big problem with the movie isn't that she's so readily accepting of their potential fate.  It's that she says it's going to happen.  She knows absolutely without any shadow of a doubt that it's going to happen.  Fascinating.  A main character being introduced with powers of omniscience halfway through the movie.  Then they simply leave it at that.  They ignore that character development and simply expect us to accept that.  The sister doesn't argue the complete incredulity of a statement such as that and the only reinforcement to this claim is that she guessed the number of jellybeans in a jar.  I'm more than capable of suspending my disbelief for cinema, but this one was just a slap in the face.  It felt entirely too forced.  And for what reason?  What possible relevancy did this scene have to the overall plot that she is omniscient?  It's mind boggling.  That's my opinion.  Take that or leave it.

My second problem is the song.  Don't mistake this for a hit on the song.  The song is beautiful.  It's hauntingly somber and fits the theme of the movie perfectly.  They just played it over, and over, and over, and over, and over.  Another scene about the planet?  Play the same exact song we've been pushing the entire movie.  BRILLIANT!

I have to say the final scene was superb.  I genuinely felt scared.  Seeing it in a theater was an amazing experience.

Only problem is when the credits started rolling people started laughing.  A mixture of actually finding the tripe they just wasted their time and money on funny and complete incredulity.  Please, I urge you:  Do not buy this movie.  If you absolutely must watch it out of curiosity find a different source that doesn't include actually spending money on it.

I'm giving this two stars because the overall feel of the movie is actually depressing and because of the ending.  It's just so unbearably boring...",1345248000,7,2634,4.807606263982103

It is like a slow-moving painting and it is a refreshing change in this age where film is chopped into tiny, constantly active pieces.  This film is meant to be savored.

Because if you just read the description (particularly on Netflix where I watched it) of the movie you can tell it's not about the planet colliding with the earth so much as it is about the people. Going by the description, a movie focused on two non-heroic sisters and their breaking/mending relationship is never going to be action packed, it's going to be cerebral. Watch this if you like observing raw thoughts, behvaior, emotions, attachments and a dark/enchanting visual element. It is not a sci-fi movie, but it uses the element in ways I wish more movies would, it stimulates you. It's like looking at a painting, little details unfold the more you look and care about it. Nothing is given to you, you have to try to understand it. If it strikes you as boring from the get-go you won't get much out of it. It wasn't a perfect movie, but it made me appreciate that simply observing people as they are and how they respond can be as beautiful as a traditional, strictly structured plot.",1344470400,3,1097,4.517587939698492

But I found this to be a very well-written and well-acted character study. In a lot of movies today (think ""Battleship"") actors do not play characters, they play character types. This film is different in that it gives the sisters' characters a lot of time to develop--Dunst is portraying a person who suffers from manic-depression rather than a ""manic-depressive"", if that distinction makes sense. Let me put it another way--if that distinction does make sense to you, you will probably think this is a 4 or 5-star film. If not, then you won't like it very much. There's nothing wrong with not liking it, of course, but I can't help but believe that this is one of those films that challenges you to think about the implications of the storyline and become involved with the characters--it rewards an engaged viewer rather than a passive one.",1343433600,4,950,4.798780487804878

Why bother with a wedding if you are the type to take a bath when you should be cutting the cake and then screw a temporary coworker after leaving your intended husband? Wow, guy, you really picked the wrong girl. I am open minded, but gosh, there is just no explanation for that kind of behavior, unless we were to say the planet affected her mind. (Maybe it did.)

I wouldn't watch it again. It was very boring to watch what was meant to be a wedding. Nothing really made sense.

2950459,4,B000VSDNF0,"This movie suffers tremendously from the use of what looks like a digital DSLR camera set on auto exposure auto focus and spot metering to shoot just about every scene, and not a very good camera at that.  The post production process was IMHO not done on the digital footage.  The camera man, most likely the same guy shooting everything, sucked and that's putting in kindly.  I'm a photographer and having to watch the movie was very difficult to do, and so I didn't for the most part.  I closed my eyes and listened to it, and opened them to catch some scenes that sounded important to the story line I was listening to, like the shots of the planet Melancholia, and when the dialog called for a snapshot of a scene to attach to the story line.  Truly the most difficult footage I have every tried to watch.  However, the actors give very good performances and their dialog and delivery is spot on.  In fact the script, music score, and sound are actually very good IMHO.  Even the special effects, although not spectacular, were presented well enough to be considered worthy aspects to the presenting and telling to the story, though basic in nature.

The movie has quite a good cast, and I couldn't help but think that everyone of them had to have reservations about doing a movie where only one guy is shooting with a Canon DSLR for every scene... truly unbelievable to me that someone didn't call the directory out on this one and insist that a camera crew be hired to shoot the ""film.""  As it stands, this movie is better enjoyed by listening to the actors present their lines, catch a glimpse of some key scenes, and that way, the very disturbing and distracting cinematography will not take away from the development of the story and the characters as they take the listener down a path of hope for the future, personal conflict and loss of hope, denial, and in the end acceptance.  I wish the concept of moving on to another life was presented, but in this story, there is no afterlife, it's just the end.  This may be why the planet is called Melancholia and everyone that accepts this concept of finality in the end see this a kind of eternal peace.  To me, it's troubling to think such things, and as such, the movie delivers exactly what it set out to do, and that is Melancholia.  Thank goodness I was over it in about 1 minute though :O)

So, 4 stars for the actors, story line, and music and audio, as these were better then ok.  If I could rate the camera work, I give it an F- and wonder what Super 8 film would have looked like instead?  Or, better yet, 16 superwide, or heck, 35mm film!",1342051200,,2607,4.431865828092243
2950460,3,B000VSDNF0,"I'll start with the negative. The movie was overly long and took me three attempts to get through it as it kept putting me to sleep. I would suggest fast forwarding through the whole first part - the failed wedding.

Now for the positive. The movie was visually striking and once you accept it as a psychological commentary, the symbolism becomes apparent. There is a lot more to it than the basic characters. While I agree with one review which commented upon how depressed people might behave more calmly in the face of disaster, I think that review entirely missed the point of the effects of melancholia upon people other than those who suffer directly. For example, the approaching planet, Melancholia, sucked part of the atmosphere away, causing strain and lethargy in everyone. Then there was a scene in which the depressed person beat a horse in an effort to get it to cross a bridge it would not cross. I thought that the horse beating scene was carried out by the wrong character and would have been more fitting for the frustrated Keifer Sutherland when I first thought about it, but on further thought I see that the scene was meant to symbolize the melancholic's failed attempts to act only to try to please others and not break out of despair.

All in all, the movie was rather interesting, which gets the three stars I gave. It has a lasting effect which might take time to sink in. If I had written the review immediately after watching, I would have given it only two stars, but the haunting effect a few days later has led me to see it in a better light.",1341964800,,1572,4.53169014084507

I actually groaned with amazement over just how bad it was in several areas. I'm disappointed with myself that I sat all the way through thinking somehow, at some point, the movie would redeem itself. Never did, not for one moment.

In fact, the only threads between the two are 4 main characters, the setting, and the approaching planet, Melancholia. The first half of the movie features wholly unlikable characters. No one, with the exception of one little boy and the groom, is likable.  It is beautifully photographed, but horribly boring. There is no point, except to discover the characters we thought might be sympathetic aren't, and the sister, Claire, whom we originally dislike, is not what we thought. It also, in some way, ""justifies"" the impending doom of the approaching planet. Why shouldn't there be potential impending doom. The world sucks, right? Clever, no? Well, actually, no. It just blows.

The second half is Claire's story, and the movie should have started here. It is a story of watching her deal with the impending ""fly by"" of Melancholia, while dealing with her sister's crippling depression. It is still difficult to watch, mainly because every second you will want to drown Justine in the bath. If you skip ""Justine"" and go straight to ""Claire,"" it's worth a viewing.

Listen, the film is slow and methodical; it is at times ""boring"" for the attention deficit disordered American viewer.  The film is shot with an eye to beauty and the psychological.  If you want entertainment, Melancholia is melancholic but if you desire a poignant, philosophical film that asks and answers (perhaps not to your liking nor my worldview) questions like: Is there any point to life? Not really. Is there ""anyone"" out there beyond our world that cares about our planet? No. We are alone and responsible for our own destiny.  In short, this film is not for the Ipoder, Ipader, and IM'ing person, who needs immediate gratification. Rather, it is for thinking, patient, open-minded, and those who appreciate not the run-of-the-mill science fiction/philosophical/psychological films.  By the by, Ms. Dunst puts in a fine performance, showing that when all is failing, depressives might have the ""upper"" hand.  She is very convincing as a person with a serious mental disorder (as defined by Western psychiatry); as the environment approaches the abyss, and the end nears she becomes less and less disturbed, suggesting that there a real strength in a being depressive.",1341273600,6,1276,5.2

Not only is it not entertaining but it doesn't really even have much of a visual value. There are a few decent shots here or there but for the most part the cinematography is quite boring.

2950484,1,B000VSDNF0,"This movie in a word: portentous. Unfortunately, the creators seemed see this as a good thing. There is an old guard in art, born from a time when the average man was poorer, and art was less ""high"" art was less refined in the working class. This old guard seems to believe that they see that which others do not. They believe that their tiny revelations are of particular interest or note. The idea that ""depressed people do not react as strongly to bad news because they expect is evidently overly simplistic. They often do not react strongly because depression is the very often the clinical term for an extreme case of ennui--people just stop caring. So in this case, it would not be that they expect it, but rather that they just don't care.

To take such a simple idea and spread it so thin over so little is either an insult to the intelligence of the general public or evidence of the film's creator's our intellectual deficiencies that led them to believe that their ideas were so profound as to justify this tedious tinsel.

2950497,3,B000VSDNF0,"Melancholia is an apocalyptic-drama that focuses on themes like death and depression. The story is split into two parts named after the two sisters, Justine and Claire. It's a story about their relationship and what happens to it as a new planet threatens to destroy Earth. Overall, the film left me with mixed emotions and I was left in the middle.

What did I like about the film? Melancholia is shot beautifully! The first 8 minutes of the film is composed of several shots of the characters in slow motion in beautiful environments. Not only that, but the story is original and deep. Although I personally dislike most of Part 1: Justine, Part 2: Claire is a powerful drama with immersive dialogue between characters leading to a sad but beautiful ending. Also, the acting was fine and the music was amazing!

What didn't I like? Melancholia sadly overstays its welcome. As I previously stated, the first part was too long and almost pointless. It did take time to develop characters and set-up the second part of the film, but I felt like it took way too long to do so. It was okay, but I'm afraid for some moviegoers the first part will cause boredom. It probably could've been cut and half and still be as affective as it was; cutting in half probably would've created a generally more enjoyable experience.

Do I recommend Melancholia? For people who absolutely love all types of film, like me, I definitely recommend checking it out. If you're a casual moviegoer and you want to see what the hype is about, here's what I recommend: Watch the first 8 minutes, watch some of part 1 (or read about it beforehand and skip it completely), and enjoy the magnificent second part.

2950523,1,B000VSDNF0,"There's a big difference between Art and Story. The two do not necessarily preclude each other, but in movies, filmmakers tend to favor the latter over the former. This has resulted in wave upon wave of horrible film, granted. However, favoring the former over the latter hasn't resulted in any great shakes, either. In fact, both extremes often end with bewildered or annoyed audiences. However, when a story-based film fails, detractors have a much better time of it, because you can point to plot holes, inconsistent or incomplete characters, cheesy dialogue, or pure cliche. When an ""artsy"" film fails, however, the explosive force between its fans and haters gains extra force because, bottom line, it comes down to taste. Likewise with this film. It has as many glowing reviews as nasty reviews, and the bottom line isn't about the beauty, artistry, or skill of the film. It's about whether or not you believe depression can be an art form. I do not.

MELANCHOLIA, as a film, is almost exactly what it sounds like. It is a 136-minute-long gaze at depression. And that's it. Seriously. No, seriously.

Do you want a story? Well, fine then. How about this? A sister planet to Earth is discovered. It is named Melancholia (oooh!) and it is headed straight for Earth. If the two planets collide, then the entire human race is doomed. Also, a girl is getting married and she's very sad. The end.

Does it seem like I'm exaggerating? I am absolutely not. Kirsten Dunst plays one of the most annoying characters of her career (and that's saying a lot). She is part of a wealthy family on a wealthy estate that is holding a wealthy wedding between her and some other wealthy people. Inexplicably, she's depressed beyond words. The movie never explains why. ""Why"" is not the film's motif. Instead, it patiently and lovingly follows its tortured heroine as she weeps, falls motionless to the floor, or goes and sleeps with total strangers on her wedding night. Because she's so, so, so sad, you see.

This is art?

I'll admit, Lars Von Trier IS an artist, but if this is what he's going to apply his skill to, then I want none of it. The movie begins with a pastiche of ultra-slow-motion images set to classical music. I didn't time this section, but it seemed to last nearly twenty minutes (I'm almost certainly wrong). I thought every image was gorgeous and stunning, and I immediately knew that I was going to hate the film. Why? Because it announced, at the start, that it was EXCLUSIVELY about the lavishness of the imagery. Even that I could stand if I didn't have to endure another two hours of a pretty and entitled girl crying for absolutely no reason whatsoever. C'mon, Lars! Make it about a short order cook or an oil rig worker or a fifty-year old divorcee with diabetes. Characters with complexity and powerful lives -- these are people I might be able to handle roiling in self-pity for 120 minutes. A disaffected girl who might just be too rich and coddled? Please.

I did some research, desperate to understand why such a dismal wreck would ever be conceived, let alone put to film, and I read that Lars wanted to show multiple facets of depression. In other words, he wanted to show the good and the bad, how depression might be useful or workable under certain circumstances. How could that be? Well, it turns out that it is useful to be skilled at depression when the world is going to end. End of Deep Important Message.

SPOILERS AHEAD!

Yes. The world ends in the film, and part of Lars' message (if the interview is to be believed) is that Dunst's character's familiarity with abiding ennui made her especially suited to enduring the destruction of mankind. This is about the most ridiculous point a film could make, since the utter destruction of mankind renders moot the way any humans deal with it. Who freaking cares if someone deals with Earth's obliteration with suicide, grace and aplomb, selfish weeping, or some kind of drug-fueled orgy? In the end, you're left with one thing: the utter obliteration of mankind. For crying out loud, is this some kind of deep, insightful message?

I'm sorry. I probably sound bitter. I guess I am. I only bought and watched this movie after the endless praise it received from critics and friends, and when I returned to said friends with less-than-glowing remarks, I was told that I lacked patience, cared more about commercialism, or was too easily bored.

Nah. I like my movies to be about things. And if they're going to travel the path of artistic flair, I'd still like that art -- beautiful or not -- to teach me something either a) new, b) interesting, or c) profound. MELANCHOLIA's message is absolutely NONE of those things, and I will gladly debate anyone who says otherwise. You can film sadness as gorgeously as you want, but if the sadness is prompted by nothing, propelled by nothing, and ends in nothing, then the end result is exactly the same: a big, fat, zero.",1339372800,132,4940,4.707175925925926

*A rogue planet, Melancholia, is going to crash into earth. Turns out there are a lot unattached planets roaming the Milky Way. While it is highly unlikely that this would happen, improbable isn't the same as impossible.
*The hyperbolic trajectory that was shown when a character googles the planet is realistic. Even the last sequence where Melancholia turns and reverses itself on its last approach could be consistant with Melancholia's trajectory.
*The planet isn't Earth-sized but Neptune-sized. Interestingly the Solar System may have lost a similar sized planet early in the formation of the system. Luckily the film didn't make this claim, that would be unbelievable, to say the least.
*The planet was blue. Again, being in interstellar space would mean the atmosphere had cooled to a couple degrees above absolute zero. A gas giant would closely resemble Neptune which is deep blue.
*When one of the characters takes a close up look through a telescope, the atmosphere is roiling. The frigid planet had passed close enough to the Sun to heat the atomsphere up causing the atmosphere to literally boil.
The only problem was Melancholia had no moons, planets this size would--however, that might be not be a disqualifier because we don't know anything, yet, about exoplanets and the moon systems. Other than rumbling, a planet around the size of Uranus or Neptune would cause a massive amount of earthquakes and other tidal effects during the first passing.

I also liked how this enormous event played out in the lives of the protagonists. Undoubtedly, people would have only a vague understanding of planetary astronomy. There were no panic because up to the end everyone thought Melancholia would pass them by. When it became understood that Earth and Melancholia would collide did people resign themselves to their impending death. No crusading scientist was going to save humanity. Unlike ""Knowing"", the film maker didn't resort to supernatural/alien intervention to give the movie a ""happy"". American ending. Realistically, there is nothing, given this is set in the present, anyone could do. A cold planet, as opposed to a star, would be difficult to detect. Everyone dies. Period.

2950567,5,B000VSDNF0,"DO NOT bother reading the synopsis for this movie, which talks about a wedding being ruined by the impending approach of a planet.  This is NOT what this movie is about.  Whoever wrote the synopsis did not watch the movie.  This movie is a study into how different individuals handle an impending catastrophe.  If you are interested in the human psyche you will enjoy this movie. If you can relate to or are interested in the study of overwhelming depression, you will like this movie.  This is not a lighthearted ""wedding threatened by impending doom"" sci-fi or girl bonding movie as the synopsis would imply.

The movie is broken into two parts featuring two sisters.  The first sister is profiled at her wedding and we soon see her struggle with overwhelming depression.  She describes at one point how it feels like large heavy cords of gray yarn are wrapped about her feet, making it very difficult for her to keep moving forward.  This is an analogy to how depression makes one feel in that even the simplest act of walking forward feels like you are mired in quicksand.  Throughout the exhaustingly long wedding reception the sister struggles to keep up a front of normalcy.  There are a few things she does that seem atypical of depression, but perhaps they were thrown in for artistic effect, whatever that means.  I have no opinion regarding the complaints of confusing symbolism and overly arty feel of the movie.  These things must have a greater impact on more sophisticated minds than mine, because my focus was the relate-ability of the characters.  I do not want to reveal any spoilers by giving away what ultimately happens at the wedding, but I think I'm safe in saying that it is understandable how someone would not want to inflict their pain on another.

The second part of the movie focuses on the sister who is not suffering from depression, but perhaps has a bit of a problem with anxiety.  It's interesting to note that the sister trying to take care of and help her depressed sibling, is also being protected from the truth regarding the upcoming cosmological event.  It's fascinating to see the calm demeanor of the depressed sibling as disaster looms ahead, because the end of the world is not the end of the world to her.  She is beyond caring about the struggle to continue living.  She impassively watches her sister spiral further out of control and into panic.  It is not uncaring dispassion, she has just become deadened to emotional pain.  And it is the depressed sister who helps her frightened nephew and sister through the final moments of the disaster.

Highly recommend if you are interested in a study of human behavior as described above.  There are a few bits that could be left out of the movie, but overall, I've yet to see a more interesting study of character in a fiction film.  The few bits of weirdness are OK with me as this seems more real to me, because life can be weird, than something that is perfectly made.  I can't think of any other movie that I have been able to relate to like this one.  And that's why I'm giving it 5 stars.

2950569,1,B000VSDNF0,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS

It seems like a group of foreign students were given an assignment of: ""Make a movie using the concept of a new earth-like planet being discovered in our solar system that had been hiding behind the sun."" Both Melancholia and a movie called Another Earth use this premise. Both are independent films. Both use shaky handheld cameras and the zoom feature where the picture temporarily goes out of focus as they zoom in for a close up. (I think only the Blair Witch Project made sense with that type of filming, since it was about students doing a documentary.) Neither Melancholia nor Another Planet were very good as they come across as amateurish.

Melancholia loses clarity in its attempt to be clever. The introduction of Melancholia is artsy, but it simply isn't clear what it's supposed to be (a dream?, a flashback?, a prediction?, a depressed person's thoughts?, the ending of the movie shown first?).

Then the movie breaks down into 2 parts, but it was difficult to understand at first whether part 1 took place before part 2 or part 2 was supposed to take place before part 1, since the movie opened with the dream/flashback/ending part. Some movies like Pulp Fiction (great movie BTW) jump around out of sequence and characters who were killed earlier are alive showing a different part of the story. Again, Melancholia is unclear.

Part 1 involves a wedding reception, which has some interesting character conflict, but then it stops and introduces Part 2. More confusion. It is not apparent as to whether the time is pre-reception or post-reception or both with the reception itself skipped. Part 2 involves how the characters react to circumstances beyond their control, involving the new planet concept, which isn't mentioned in part 1.

Also, Keifer Sutherland's character reaction in Part 2 comes across as unlikely for the character he's playing. His family would have been involved in the choice he made.

Anyway, most people think the ending was the best part, probably because *SPOILER ALERT* everyone is put out of their misery including the audience.",1337817600,11,2095,4.9714285714285715

2950571,1,B000VSDNF0,"There are apocalyptic movies with a philosophical, psychological, or political message; some of them are entertaining, others depressing.  Good SciFi is based on new ideas about the future of humanity, about the role of technology, about the fate of humanity, or sometimes just new stories and new characters that have never been imagined before.  Acceptable SciFi may simply put classical stories into a future context, allowing us to enjoy old stories anew.

Melancholia is none of those things.  The most advanced technology in it is a bent coat hanger.  Its notion about the future of humanity is that of a dysfunctional, depressed family dying pointlessly.  Melancholia is merely a beautifully shot but otherwise uninspired and pointless movie, a reflection of von Trier's own depressed state of mind, his fears and phobias.

I just wish von Trier's movies would stop showing up in the SciFi category and be relegated to the ""art house film"" category, where the people who like this sort of ""avant garde"" thing can indulge in them without giving SciFi a bad name.",1337472000,8,1068,5.0685714285714285

2950574,5,B000VSDNF0,"Melancholia is one-star awful if you're looking for a date movie, realism, a fable, action, memorable characters, love conquering all, laughs, tears, life lessons, good guys finding a way through, or a beginning, middle and end. If you're in this camp, don't read any further.

But if you're a fictionhead--someone deeply interested in the deceits and values of fiction--Melancholia is a five-star film. In this regard, it's on par with Drugstore Cowboy, High Art, Wings of Desire, Trainspotting and The Virgin Suicides. And within shouting distance of cinema's all-time best rumination on the meaning of fiction, The Third Man.

Why? Because Melancholia is about endings and nothing but. Charlotte Rampling introduces herself with a bridge-burning interruption of an inept toast. There's nowhere for her character to go two minutes after she appears. Ditto for her ex, who's crushed on arrival by her interruption. Stellan Skarsgaard's character is set up as the archvillain, then sent packing along with the other would-be antagonists (the  paramour, the business partners, and  the mother) halfway through what usually amounts to the first act in a feature film.

It matters that the man of finance, order and science (the brother-in-law) miscalculates with a glib, unsatisfying nod to the uncertainty principle, then winds up kicked in the head by a horse. It matters too that the earnest, tender characters--the groom and the sister--are unfailingly inarticulate and/or dead wrong when it counts, because they both want storytelling progressions (gestures that suggest hope for the future, and actions that improve on the present) that the premise of the film won't tolerate.

The constraint of that premise is why Kirsten Dunst swings from confection to wrecking ball in a few implausible filmed minutes--she ruins her world on her wedding night, quickly devolving from picture-perfect high society bride to washed-out bedhead gloomy girl who can't be bothered to wear makeup or flattering clothes. The first suggestion of the film is that she's right to have imploded--when the end is undeniable, that fact crowds out any fiction, regardless of motive.

But the second suggestion of Melancholia matters more, I think, though it arrives only in the last minutes of the film.

When the total resignation of Dunst's Justine has overtaken her sister Clare (and yes, look at those names again, and consider their blood ties), the spell of facts and hopelessness is broken by the fear of Clare's little boy, and the love both women have for him. The three join together to create one last fiction--one that gives them something to do in the final hours. It brings them together across generational, intellectual, and spiritual divides, in spite of their physical circumstances. The child may be assuaged by an illusion of hope, but the women, who have been at odds for the entire film, come to the same place in the end: it was bad fiction (not fiction itself) that led them astray. Their final act of imagination is a meaningful one, because the two women (for once) conjure it for all the right reasons. And the film ends beautifully and tragically, with the idea that fiction matters most when reality holds all the cards. What Clare and Justine give themselves and the child isn't denial, transcendence or control, but a way of putting themselves in accord with the end. Imagination brings them peace.

If you're a fictionhead, the way this film gets where it wants to go demands repeat viewings. Get Melancholia.",1337212800,27,3518,5.136363636363637

2950597,2,B000VSDNF0,"I read a number of reviews which made it sound as though Melancholia presented an interesting and well-written interpretation of how a depressive perspective affects the response to situations that might cause other people to panic.  I'll explain why I was profoundly disappointed.

This is true for the last ten minutes or so of the film.  The rest has very little to do with depression, and although as some reviewers have noted, there is some impressive craftsmanship and the visuals are striking from the standpoint of cinematography, the writing of the characters is, in my opinion, trite and awful.  Based on my own experience of clinical depression, the main character's depression ends up taking a back seat to her being an awful person about halfway through the movie; depression, like any other traumatic experience, does not actually cause people to behave awfully.

The movie obviously wants her to be sympathetic, by surrounding her with awful people and then presenting her in a quasi-mystical role akin to a postmodern version of the Mad Prophet, but she turns out at the most crucial moments to be steeped in unnecessary and pointless cruelty.  Her character seems less like a depressed person, and more like how depressed people are seen by people who don't understand them, lashing out and committing self-destructive acts ""at random.""  Combined with all the rest of the characters, with one or two exceptions, this makes the film seem like it's just one more brick in the wall of the postmodern paradigm: that everyone is awful, despicable, and crazy, and that adults throwing tantrums at one another like small children equals depth.

The two stars are for the cinematography.  There are some beautiful visuals, especially in the beginning, although most of them end up having practically nothing to do with the actual events of the movie; this is a shame, since it probably would have been a better one.  It gets a bit TOO slow in places, but the patient building of atmosphere is expertly accomplished.  If the writing hadn't been yet another offensively awful case of pandering to postmodern anti-humanist sensibilities, it would have been at least four stars.",1337040000,5,2183,5.052924791086351

""Melancholia"" (2011)
--------------------------------
When this film was in theaters, I heard several critics complain about director Lars Von Trier's misanthropy and cruelty towards his characters, and how this end-of-the-world epic was a mega-bummerfest with no sense of redemption and a contempt for the audience and the human race in general... etc., etc.  It's true that this is not the most cheerful of films, but mostly it struck me as being solidly in the Euro art-house tradition of Berman, Fellini, et al. The first third of the film is taken up with an ensemble performance in which a high-society wedding goes horribly wrong, and this sequence in particular seemed studiously set in that art-film tradition -- a dark comedy of errors, packed with character details and observations that are both measured and abrasive. Nothing new here - nor anything particularly explosive. It's depressing, but not earth-shattering. Oh, pardon the pun... The rest of the film deals with the aftermath of the party, going small and closing in on the narrow family dynamics of two sisters at the center of the drama, which we discover is set in the backdrop of a metaphor-laden, moon-sized asteroid headed on a collision course with Earth. Yes, Lars Von Trier destroys the planet, and perhaps he does so with glee, but there is an evocative, imaginative element to this apocalypse, and it is nowhere near as repellant or pointless as the rape scene in his earlier work, ""Breaking The Waves,"" a movie that I actively detest.

Though slow-moving and ponderous, this film is worth watching... It won't scar you for life, and isn't quite as horrifying (or as significant) as you may have been led to believe... It's certainly not the end of the world. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1336953600,4,1811,5.135593220338983

2950602,5,B000VSDNF0,"This film knocked my socks off the first time I saw it.  Shortly thereafter, I saw it once again in the cinema.  As some other Amazon reviewers have noted, ""Melancholia"" is best experienced on the big screen (""Big & Loud"", to paraphrase one reviewer) especially for the opening & closing sequences.  Despite its imperfections, there is a logical arc of progression contained within this film, that can be summarized as follows: (1) the Prelude / Premonition / Dance of Death between the Planets; (2) the Wedding, The Sisters, The Gradual Disappearance of Everyone besides 3 Principal Characters; & (3) the Simultaneously Horrifying & Moving Ending.  The conclusion of ""Melancholia"" reminded me, once again, that the Cruel Cosmos, as well as Amoral Mother Nature, do not care whether we humans exist or not and will roll over us like a steamroller on a whim.  Other Amazon reviewers have compared this film to ""The Tree of Life"", but frankly, TOL was a Disney-esque experience compared to ""Melancholia"".  Despite its being controversial (controversy coming naturally to Von Trier, the button-pushing provocateur) I also enjoyed LVT's previous outing, ""Antichrist"".  ""Antichrist"" made me realize that Von Trier seems to have entered his masterwork phase.

My theory about the intensely dismissive and negative reactions to ""Melancholia"" by many other Amazon reviewers is this: If one does not want to deal with subject matter that is deep, disturbing, metaphorical, mystifying & symbolic -- One won't like this film.  Apparently all those 1-star reviewers who wanted their money back were angry about having been seduced by a concept, that could have offered them a poetic & visionary representation of a potentially frightening reality.  And so this picture is a love-it-or-hate-it experience, as is to be expected from any great work of art built on a definitive & insightful point of view.  Secondly, a familiarity with / taste for European film is advised before viewing this film, given the differences of sensibility, imagery and pacing between European and American cinema.  For instance, I'm not the biggest fan of Andrei Tarkovsky, but anyone who had seen his pictures before having seen ""Melancholia"" would be better equipped to deal with its slow pace.  In closing, although I have previously heard ""Tristan & Isolde"" & other music by Wagner utilized in the scores of films by various directors (Chabrol, Francis Ford Coppola, Fassbinder, Fellini) -- Von Trier's use of ""Tristan & Isolde"" in both the opening & closing of ""Melancholia"" was genius.  Thus the comparisons made to the equally brilliant opening of Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" are completely justified.

2950618,2,B000VSDNF0,"In spite of my love for (some of) Von Trier's movies, I don't hesitate to call this one plain disappointing. It has some very beautiful shots, but the movie simply fails in all respects where it's supposed to bring something to the table. (1) A strained relationship between two sisters: obvious, but incredibly poor, imitation of one of Bergman's favorite topics (which he so masterfully portrays in Silence and Cries and Whispers). (2) Depression: inconsistent, inaccurate, immature portrayal of bipolar/depression (it's not even clear what he's going for here). (3) Apocalypse and human fear: once again, a lame picture, much better portrayed in many other apocalyptic movies.

Where the movie is supposed to be ""artistic"", it comes across as juvenile and pretentious, which is rather unexpected from an experienced director like Von Trier. The opening slow motions remind you more of a freshman's work of cinematography, and the poor development of characters offers nothing to back it up.

In general, a disappointing movie from a respectable director.",1336521600,2,1057,5.323353293413174

2950623,1,B000VSDNF0,"This movie is stupid. Plain and simple. It followed the silly trend of 2012- the world is coming to an end and everyone is doomed to damnation. When I watched it- I couldn't figure out what point they were trying to get across. The movie seemed to be broken up into several different themes. When it came on, I had to fast forward through the first 5-7 minutes because it was nothing but special effects and graphics. Then the movie progresses into a love story about 2 people who appear to be very much in love getting married. After another 30 minutes or so, the bride appears to be depressed and regretful about her decision to marry her husband. She even goes so far as to make sexual advances and then reject her husband. To carry the nonsense even further, she goes outside and has the weirdest looking sex I have ever seen with some strange dude right outside of the wedding reception.  WTH???!!!Meanwhile there is this big wedding party going on. No one seems to notice. The bride then makes these disappearances from her wedding party several times (she takes a bath, she tucks her nephew in, etc.). Clearly she's depressed. However, the focus on this depressed bride took way too long. Then suddenly the wedding reception that last forever is over, and the bride comes back to her sister's house in a cab- hubby no where in sight. One can only assume that she left him. She comes back to her sister's house to mope. Then they bring up the topic of this magical melancholia. Everyone is super calm about it- there's no news, radio. The closest we can get to this is the bride's sister  and her son looking it up on the internet. Again, no one seems to be terribly panicked. Meanwhile, the sister of bride's husband (Sutherland) is a scientist who keeps the truth from his family. He lies continuously throughout the remainder of the film. As time draws near for this ""melancholia"" to take place he decides to be a punk and eat some type of poisonous pill-leaving his family to find out the truth on their own. Meanwhile-the bride is not so depressed anymore. She becomes psychic, and is a nudist at one point during the film; while her sister begins to unravel and lose their mind. The bride becomes so powerful that she helps everyone become at peace with their destiny. There is no attempt of any kind to make contact with family members or other loved ones. Other than the sister of the bride having a mini spaz- everyone is fine and having a jolly good time. Yes ladies and gentlemen, we are all about to perish - yet you've entered the twilight zone. If they would've spent as much money developing the story as they did wasting it on graphics this would have been a superb film. However they did not- so people like me who wanted to see a good movie, wasted their time and money. The film makes no sense. If the film wanted melancholia- they sure got it. That's what I felt when I turned it off.  It's too bad amazon won't let me give zero or negative stars, because that's what this film deserves.",1336262400,4,3013,4.494525547445256

2950637,2,B000VSDNF0,"1.  The title is fitting as it describes the condition of the two sisters played by Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainesbourgh, but more so Dunst who is suffering from a depression ridden mental disorder and destroys any chance at happiness for her marriage on her wedding day.  You almost feel sorry for her, but can't quite completely do it.  She was far more sympathetic as Lux in the movie Virgin Suicides, which makes me believe that she and Sofia Coppola need to work together again.  They are a winning team when it comes to art films about women.

2.  Melancholia is the name of the planet headed on a collision course for earth.  Though Gainesbourgh's character's husband played by Kieffer Sutherland has assured her that the planet will not hit and go around, we find out he discovers he was wrong in one of the most selfish acts a person could do to his family, which made me really angry with him.

3.  Melancholia is exactly what you will feel as you sit through the entire 2 hours and 15 minutes of this depressing  film that tries hard to be art.  The beginning is beautiful, slow, colorful shots set to the background of classical music that is almost worth watching the movie for at all.  Other than that, this movie is slower than the intro, dreary, dismal, and makes you sad to see how Dunst's character is the stronger one in the end, taking charge of the situation as disaster looms.

This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but I wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to anybody I know.  As much as I like the actors who were cast, this movie is simply not that great.  I think next time Dunst makes an art film, she should reunite with Sofia Coppola, as I've said before.  Their chemistry as actress and director is spot on, so I recommend both Virgin Suicides and Marie Antoinette.  The movies are both depressing as well, but they're what I would call true art.",1336089600,4,1889,4.492668621700879

The movie is SAD because it gives the message that life on this fallen planet is all there is. This is one of the biggest lies humans believe. THe truth is that there is God creator and God is spirit who is personal and created us in his image, male and female.

We exist because of something greater than ourselves. We don't exist to exist. That is impossible.

2950640,4,B000VSDNF0,"I've never been a fan of Danish director Lars Von Trier. I think it was due in large part to the cast that ""Melancholia"" kept my interest, but I must admit that I enjoyed the film. It's not possible to spoil it, as we see the ending before anything else. For eight minutes, we watch the Earth collide with the gas giant planet Melancholia, that was somehow set loose from its own solar system and hurtled into ours, to Wagner's Prelude to ""Tristan and Isolde"". Then, we see Part One, in which the neurotic and chronically melancholic advertising copywriter Justine (Kirsten Dunst) attends her wedding reception with new husband Michael (Alexander Skarsgard) at an expansive country estate owned by her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and brother-in-law John (Kiefer Sutherland).

Part Two takes place some months later, as Claire and John, an amateur astronomer, wait for Melancholia to pass by the Earth and give them a spectacular view. Claire is not so sure, though, that Melancholia will pass by safely. Justine, in the meanwhile, has fallen into a severe depression, and Claire has her out to the house in hopes of promoting recovery.

Justine's inability to cope with much of anything makes her insufferably self-absorbed. I didn't think that I was going to have much patience for her. But, between Kirsten Dunst's shining performance and Manuel Alberto Claro's impulsive camera, the audience is pulled into Justine's perspective in Part One. It even makes Claire, who is perfectly reasonable and tolerant, seem like she is imposing on her sister. And I had to like the cocksure John, who refused to put up with his equally self-absorbed and insufferable mother-in-law Gaby (Charlotte Rampling). Part Two is more about Claire's world and the thing that she will find impossible to cope with.

I'm not surprised that Von Trier would ignore simple issues of place and consistency, or flout them deliberately. But I wondered more than once where this film takes place. A mostly American family with some English staff on an apparently European country estate. But all the guests speak English. And why does one sister speak with an English accent while the other speaks with an American accent? ""Melancholia"" was filmed in Sweden, but I don't imagine it was intended to take place there. Von Trier treats time and place like abstractions. I never did discover the significance of the 19th hole on the golf course, among other oddities. It probably doesn't have any. ""Melancholia"" doesn't seem to be about anything in particular, but it is entrancing at times.

The DVD (Magnolia 2012): There are 5 featurettes and 2 theatrical trailers (2 min each). ""About Melancholia"" (12min) interviews the cast, director, and a psychologist about the ideas behind the film, themes, and characters. ""Visual Effects"" (7 min) is about the rogue planet and the collision of planets. ""The Visual Style"" (10 min) interviews Lars Von Trier, director of photography Manuel Alberto Claro about the camera work, and visual effects supervisor Peter Hjoth. ""The Universe"" (4 min) interviews Peter Hjoth and astrophysicist Michael J D Linden-Vrnle about the science behind the film. ""HDNet: A Look at Melancholia"" (5 min) is a publicity spot incorporating interview clips from the bonus features.

2950641,2,B000VSDNF0,"2.5 if you care.

Melancholia is undeniably a gorgeous film, the images of space are beautiful, the scenery is beautiful, Kirsten Dunst's breasts were beautiful, the music was beautiful, and especially the first ten minutes of slow motion was especially breathtaking. The concept was interesting too, a severely depressed character has an opposite reaction compared to the 'happy' and 'balanced' people in her lives when they are thrust into two emotionally contrasting events, a visual aid for the concept would be a yin-yang symbol.

But when it comes to the plot Lars Von Trier again struggles to maintain the audience's interest. Here he splits the film into two chapters, the first half is called Justine and and shows Justine(Kirsten Dunst) is depressed, and it's effecting the people around her during her own wedding dinner to the point where the whole wedding unravels by the end of the night, which was really boring to watch when it shouldn't have been. Who are these people aqain? Why are we supposed to care about Justine's passive aggressive temper tantrum? For someone who's actually depressed, Lars sure doesn't know how to convey it well in film. The whole wedding dinner experience is like being stuck in a distant cousin's wedding where you don't know/care about anyone there and you can't drink.

Another bad decision on Lar's part was the camera work, it looks like the camera-man suddenly became violently ill and started puking while trying to hold the camera on the scene, and it just looks like a disaster. Was this supposed to be a hand-held Cloverfield knock-off? I'm not sure if it was supposed to be 'artsy' or 'cute' but it was just a pointless distraction from the already uninteresting story. After seeing the first ten minutes this part was quite a letdown.

Thankfully the second half picks things up, this time revolving around Justine's sister Claire in the chapter named (you guessed it) Claire. Claire realizes along with the rest of the family that an asteroid aptly named ""Melancholia"" is on course for Earth, and is days away from global annihilation. Each of the characters kind of reacts in their own way, the most peculiar being Justine, knowing that everyone's doom is imminent she becomes strangely calm while Claire is frantically struggling to escape certain doom along with her daughter. The second half is a bit more interesting, but still there wasn't really a sense of dread set up. I couldn't really relate or care about any of these characters, the only really interesting aspect about the story is again seeing how one of the characters with depression cope with marriage and death. At it's best, Melancholia is both beautiful and emotionally devastating (you really have to meet Lars half way to get that out of Melancholia) and at it's worst is bloated and pretentious.

Lars Von Trier has a good visual eye, but his screenwriting and editing are sloppy. Lars could've easily cut down the length or add more to what's going on. But like Antichrist Lars sure loves to have his characters depressed, but he hasn't really found a way to convey it. Unlike Antichrist there is more going on here and there's a real sense of beauty to it all that doesn't have to resort to unnecessary and dumb gore.

It's worth mentioning that the director conceited this film while in therapy for depression, the main actress Kirsten Dunst has openly admitted to suffering from depression, and the whole film revolves around how depression effects everyone, so I'd only recommend this film to people interested in depression.",1335916800,3,3561,4.946488294314381

When I finally got to Part 2, I thought to myself, ""this movie needs to decide what it is."" The long opening seems unrelated to the synopsis of the movie. Parts 1 and 2 are like disjointed ""he said, she said"" stories.

There is much to like about this movie. The performances are top notch, as is the photography, sets, effects, etc. All very professionally produced. But the director fell in love with his opening footage, and didn't cut out or tighten it enough to hold our attention. Overall it needed a better script doctor, and a better editor.

2950662,5,B000VSDNF0,"The problem with rating something like this is that the movie is so unique, so eccentric, and so enigmatic that it will really only appeal to a narrow subset of viewers.  Those who appreciate von Trier's unique style--which serves (among all the movies I've ever seen) as an unparalleled vehicle for both emotional and intellectual impact--will LOVE this movie...those who, perhaps understandably, do not appreciate such a strange style, will either hate it or find it to be somewhat intriguing in a few ways but mostly a waste of time.  The number of stars is misleading--3 stars suggests that it's a pretty good movie, when in reality there are many who love it and many who hate it; most people either gave it a 5 or a 1.

I can try to explain why I love it, but I'm  going to be purposefully vague because I think too many specifics could negatively alter one's attitude going into the movie (if the expectations I've set haven't already)--if nothing else, it's the kind of movie that you want to experience in your own way.  It certainly gets under your skin--I couldn't stop thinking about it for many days after seeing it, and it still comes into my head quite often.  As I suggested above, it is both emotionally intense and intellectually challenging.  The movie is also very strange, but if you're open-minded this can be a wonderful thing.  It operates on several different levels--there is a lot of deep symbolism but there is also a lot of strong emotion right on the surface.  It's the kind of movie that might have a major impact on you...if you let it.

To that end, make sure that you watch it under the right circumstances.  As I said, it's emotionally intense, so make sure you're in the mood for that.  Also, I would recommend watching it ALONE.  Or, if you do watch it with someone, make sure it's someone you're very close to.  Someone else could easily respond negatively or create a kind of tension that would make it harder for you to explore your own thoughts and feelings.  It also wouldn't hurt to turn the lights off and have a drink (but not too much).

I should also mention that the acting and dialogue are fantastic.  I'm not even a fan of Kirsten Dunst, but she does an excellent job in this film.  All of the actresses and actors do.  Another Lars von Trier movie I love (and one that also has truly amazing acting) is Dogville, which is also probably a decent gauge for whether or not you would be turned off by Melancholia.  I'm not suggesting that Dogville and Melancholia are particularly alike (though there are quite interesting similarities), but if you have seen Dogville and appreciated it, then you will probably be able to appreciate Melancholia.

BOTTOM LINE:
-It's one of the best movies I personally have seen, though opinions (unsurprisingly) vary wildly
-It's quite strange and unique (in a very good way), so if that in and of itself is a turn-off, you might not want to watch
-Watch it by yourself (or with someone very close) and when you're in the mood for something quite intense and heavy
-If you liked Dogville, you probably won't be turned off by this at all (and if you haven't seen Dogville, you should)

If after reading this review you are at all intrigued and aren't seriously turned off, then you should definitely give it a shot (with Amazon Prime it's free).",1335744000,5,3325,4.609507640067911
2950663,3,B000VSDNF0,"I don't have anything against 'art films', and Von Trier's last outing, ""Anti-Christ"", wasn't all that bad.  As with ""Anti-Christ"", ""Melancholia"" mixes myths and modern psychology.  The idea of a planet behind the sun is actually part of the Mayan myth of the end of the world, where the planet is called Nbiru.  Both of these last Von Trier movies have been strongly compared to Ingmar Bergman, too.  The wedding scenes in ""Melancholia"" do bear comparison to Bergman... revealing very uptight upper crust people who behave like aristocrats.

In Bergman's ""Cries and Whispers"", the filmmaker supposedly styled his movie after the paintings of Edvard Munch.  Von Trier, in ""Melancholia"", seems to be imitating Paul Delvaux, or some postmodernist like P.J Crook.  So, the large nocturnal scenes in the movie are stunning visually, and haunting, and there are other great shots, like an overhead of two women riding through great clouds of morning mist.  Visually then, the movie is a triumph.

But too much of the rest of it is just annoying.  Jerky movements by hand-held cameras.  Swooning Wagner music, over and over.  Annoying ""geiger counter"" noise, for arty effect.  Annoying symbolic impasses at tiny woodland bridge.  Troubled horses.  Characters and situations that seem to be made up out of thin air.  Who are these people?  Does anyone care?

There are good actors completely wasted who just wander through a few scenes-- I'm thinking of John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling.  If you are only interested in style, or if you are a fan of  Matthew Barney's pretensions, then this is a good film for you.

2950690,5,B000VSDNF0,"Ever since Lars von Trier learned from his mother the truth about his origins, that the father who raised him wasn't his biological father, the Danish director has decided from that day forth to orientate his movies on a quest for honest storytelling and sincere emotions, something that his family always condemned. Starting from the Kingdom, then getting international recognition with Breaking the Waves all the way up to Antichrist, all of Lars' movies have worked on this quest for truth, but also on a mission to move viewers in ways that many would find either pleasant and enriching, or unpleasant and disagreeable.

And this is exactly what happens with Melancholia, as Lars once again confronts the Science-Fiction genre rules and stereotypes, and adds human psychology. Instead of conforting us with the usual end-of-the world story told through the eyes of the scientists, military and space agency who try to do everything they can to stop a fly-by from destroying Earth on the third or fourth of July, Lars has decided to show us this end of the world through two sisters, Claire and Justine, whose story happens in the United States, on the golf property of Claire's husband, John. While we hear excerpts, and see an excellent prologue, using the overture of Wagner's Tristan and Isolde under gorgeous visual effects.

Although Justine, played by Kirsten Dunst, who totally deserved her palm for Best actress, is considered the main star of the story, it is evident that Claire, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, is also the main star of Melancholia. Indeed, though their lives took different turns in terms of professional and social successes, I think the two sisters are both alike because, as we watch the movie, we find out that they are both extremely anxious people who dread an unpredictable future.

To me, the reason why some viewers on Amazon, and on the Web, didn't like Melancholia is probably because Lars doesn't work in the classical sense of storytelling. If Melancholia had been done under a very conventional director and/or scriptwriter, the viewer would have gotten likeable characters, with whom the viewer would identify with; and would have a clear explanation to the characters' lives which would explain all their actions and reactions, especially Justine's as she does things that turn her wedding into another direction. Not only that, Lars never entirely explains the characters' troubled state, though a few hints at the wedding reveal the parents absence to be a major influence. Doing exactly what other controversial directors (i.e: David Lynch, Maurice Pialat, Jonathan Demme, Carl Theodor Dreyer, David Chase, and Michael Haneke) have been doing through their movies, Lars wants us to take a look at the story through an open-mind and to interact with it. Which means that we have to create our own explanations through the subtle details Lars is showing in the movie, which we would then tie up to the missing pieces in this movie that the director has shot like a documentary. Of course this kind of thinking will annoy some viewers who only think of movies as a device to decompress from the week's or job's stress, or to have some quality time with their loved ones. However I think it is much more interesting to watch a movie where the characters act and talk like real individuals; and not like some cardboard stereotypes from the Hollywood Sci-fi and Action genre rules, or get used, just like in the movie Armageddon, as a device to promote some Aerosmith videoclip.

For although I do love to watch a commercial Sci-fi flick once in a while, it is nice to see directors try to follow their own voices and give a finger to what some viewers and Hollywood take for granted when they pay their movie tickets and DVDS. And by that I mean that the movie will give them exactly what they want, will explain everything that they need to know, and that they will come out of the theater or living room uplifted, having learned an important moral lesson for the day, ready to take the stresses of lives with a stronger, but sometimes fake and temporary, sense of hope for humanity.

If you are ready to get your senses shaken and being told that sometimes, life does not work like a Hollywood movie, then get on it and have fun watching Melancholia, which I did. But if you don't and prefer to hide your anger through short one-star bashings, where you don't clearly explain why you didn't like a movie, please do not watch Melancholia.

As Foamy the Squirrel, from the Web cartoon Neurotically Yours, said in the episode ""Germaine for Stupids"" : ""Life is offensive people. It's brutal, annoying, stupid, dirty, and at the end ****ing pointless"". And we need stories to sometimes remember that. So that we can be better prepared when those situations happen. For better or for worse.

And besides, I find it ironic that a movie working under a 13 million budget has better visuals effects, scripts and actors, than movies working with 100 millions of dollars of budget (Spider-Man 3, Van Helsing, Armageddon, The Day after Tomorrow, Transformers). Maybe Hollywood should take a note and remember that it is good scripts and directors that make a good movie, not the stars working on it.",1335657600,3,5235,4.8752808988764045

2950705,2,B000VSDNF0,"I have to say I got pretty excited at the beginning of this flick when the Earth crashed into that other planet. They really psyched me out for a wicked post-apocalypse story about people living by a golf course. Unfortunately what you get instead is fifty minutes of rich people murmuring mean things to each other at the worst wedding ever. The story as far I could tell was that Kirsten Dunst (Mary Jane from Spiderman) was marrying that vampire from True Blood at Keiffer Sutherland's (Jack Bauer) house. They're real happy at first, but then Kirsten Dunst gets all sad for some reason and just messes things up for everyone. People kept taking baths and talking about advertising and I couldn't understand what people were saying half the time because of all the murmuring. So then Kirsten Dunst and the Vampire from True Blood break up. Good riddance.

This is where things get weird. Because all of a sudden Kirsten Dunst is super sad and has moved into Jack Bauer's house so she can be taken care of by her sister. Apparently when you're depressed, you have trouble bathing, because Kirsten Dunst can't muster the strength to get in a bathtub, what is that all about? Then Jack Bauer starts talking about how some planet called Melancholia is coming close to the Earth, but won't hit it. It was hard to tell what exactly he said, because of all the murmuring. Anyway people murmur a lot and then finally Melancholia hits the Earth and everybody dies. Good riddance.

This brings me to my most important point: who names a planet ""Melancholia""? I'll tell you who would: no one. When you name something big and ominous, you're going to go with a happy name, like ""Blue Brother"" or ""Mickey Mouse."" If you give something a name like ""Melancholia"" you might as well call it ""that big thing that's gonna kill us all."" I mean come on. Do you really think anyone in the planet naming community is going to name something after a bad mood? There are plenty of ways to imply melancholy without putting it in the name. How about ""Hamlet""? Great name, alludes to melancholy without beating us over the head. Honestly, I would have been happier if they named the planet ""Sadsville"" so at least they're being honest about talking down to the audience.",1335571200,15,2245,4.652392947103275

It's complicated and I feel as if I had been dropped into the middle of things and left to sort them out as best I could. The ending was only disappointing when I thought I had already figured it out, but I was pleasantly surprised because I was, in fact surprised. I thought the characters were very believable, neurotic but very everyday. The wedding part was like a sad nightmare and all did not work out ""happily ever after"". I respect that.

2950712,4,B000VSDNF0,"Melancholia is Lars von Trier's first feature since 2009's Antichrist, which was one of my earlier reviews. That film had stimulated me both mentally and visually, and also left me wanting more from the director of whose work I had not been too familiar with prior. Melancholia was on point with my expectations, with the end result being a visually stunning and equally mentally engaging picture. Right from the opening montage containing Wagner's Tristan und Isolde Prelude layered over high-speed, slow-motion shots with dark, eerie yet magical visuals, the audience is hinted as to what is in store.

The film follows Justine (Kirsten Dunst) as she and newly wed husband Michael (Alexander Skarsgrd) head to their wedding reception. Upon arrival to the absurdly enormous estate, owned by Justine's brother-in-law John (Kiefer Sutherland), Justine's attention is caught by a mysterious star in the sky. Justine's emotional state, which was previously played off so convincingly as happy and giddy during a humorous scene involving the bride and groom in a limousine on a tight country road, declines rapidly.

The evening slowly proceeds with different interactions mostly involving Justine and various family and co-workers. Each of these situations gives us more insight into who Justine is and set the tone for the rest of the film. Justine's depressive state becomes more and more evident, which starts to become a foreshadowing of much larger events. When the celebration events end, so does Part I (entitled on screen as ""Justine"").

Part II, entitled ""Claire,"" focuses more on Justine's older sister (played by Charlotte Gainsbourg). Claire is a loving yet somewhat controlling older sister to Justine who takes on a motherly like role with an ill Justine. During the second part, the planet known as Melancholia is now known to be approaching Earth and much time is focused on Claire's handling of the situation.

The film is certainly more of an experience, or set of experiences, as seen through the eyes of our characters. Because of this, parts of the film are drawn out, which undoubtedly contributes greatly to character development but almost caused me to lose track of the actual story. We do get to know the main characters a great deal and Melancholia adds a whole different dimension to factor into everything that we're observing.

From the get-go, we know this film is going to be a downer for the most part. Knowing that, how events and characters play out is still involving and mysterious. The performances are so profound in this film that it is near impossible to not have any feelings about each of the characters. The emotive music and usually artful cinematography (I say ""usually"" due to plentiful use of shakycam that I found to be less effective in several areas of the film) makes sure that the film has a lasting impact on the viewer.

This really is a beautiful film. Like Antichrist, it plays on the mental state of its characters as well as the external environment. Melancholia also adds a bit of philosophical flare to make things even more engaging. Dunst also really sold the film for me. While I usually have a fairly neutral response to her, with All Good Things and now this, she's certainly someone to watch. I still just can't help but feel that the ""part"" structure of the film was almost unnecessary. Trier chose to spotlight Justine and Claire, however I feel this was achieved automatically without a need for the extra effort. A few directorial preferences aside, Melancholia stands out from most modern films and is truly a stunning experience.

Then.....what the H---?  A beautifully wrapped package with absolutely nothing inside.  I turned it off, and the next afternoon, forced myself to watch the remaining hour.

I hate you so much.""  Justine, not to be bested, tells Claire flatly that the earth is evil and deserves to be destroyed.

Justine is the first person to spot the gaseous blue giant Melancholia as it slowly careens towards the earth.  She is the only one to fully accept the significance of this mysterious apparition.  Are the psychic powers Justine claims to possess just another sign of her deep narcissism?  Or is her insanity the only sane response to the potential annihilation of all life in the universe?

Also if the point was to contrast the way that 'depressed people' and 'happy people' react to tragedy, then it doesn't really pull it off because all the main characters (except for the groom, who disappears after the first half) seem depressed.

This movie just tries to capitalize on all the hype about 2012 but is silly and uninspired, as though 10 year old kids were shooting a film. Visually it is really pleasing: the lighting is good, the landscape is beautiful. There was some trouble with visual effects like rain and hail but that wouldn't matter if the script itself were any good.

2950797,2,B000VSDNF0,"I think I'm one of the few people who didn't care for this movie who didn't mind that it was a tad slow. What bothered me was that, according to the director, the movie was supposed to relate that depressives deal with disaster in a different way than those without depression.

It was very surprising to me, then, when an hour and a half of this movie did not deal even in the slightest with a sense of impending doom. Even when Melancholia comes to the forefront of the film, it still takes awhile before it is revealed to the characters that the planet will hit Earth. In the end, one gets about 20 minutes of the characters reacting to what will be the end of the world. It makes the wedding, the depression, and the dysfunction all seem unimportant. The whole purpose of the film was contained in the last twenty minutes. It was awfully rushed, and you had the feeling watching it that the director had a vision for the movie, wanted to set up an elaborate backdrop for the real plot, and then realized he had too much background and near none of the meaning the movie was to bring.

I simply cannot understand how this movie was about how people deal with tragedy or disaster. If it really was, I can't understand why the first hour of the movie was necessary.

All in all, this movie was disconnected. I felt like the director was caught in multiple minds about what the film was supposed to be about, and it made for a poor movie.",1334620800,4,1438,4.358208955223881
2950798,5,B000VSDNF0,"After I first watched the journey of Lars von Trier's Antichrist, I was destined to see all of his work. Melancholia easily stands next to Trier's other greats. It is a complex story that revolves around Justine (Kirsten Dunst), a recently engaged and depressed young woman, and the end of the world as Melancholia collides with Earth. What evolves is a deep evaluation of the human psyche, and how different people act in a terrible situation when they are depressed and when they are 'normal'. Justine is calm while death seems imminent, almost happy. Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), Justine's sister, gets more and more panicked as destruction comes closer.

Kirsten Dunst was nominated (and won) quite a few different awards when this was at all the different festivals and it is easy to see why. In this one movie, she plays as many emotions as most actors/actresses do throughout their entire filmography.

I wish that the controversy surrounding Lars von Trier and his ""anti-Semitic statements"" (I could tell it was sarcasm) never happened, because I feel as though this movie would have received a lot more praise than it did, the praise that it deserves.",1334620800,3,1162,4.984536082474227

Am I the only one that caught that the reason for Justine's depression was her ability to see the end of the world? I would be depressed too!! And how do you tell your family/friends that they are doomed without them thinking you are crazy...er. Seriously! The reason she was calm in the end was because she had plenty of time to come to terms with it. She was actually lucky because she could have her ""depression"", grieve, accept (to some degree) and then get smashed by a big 'ole planet with a knowing, sad smile on her face. The only comparison to the severe depression suffered by millions was the portrayal of its manifestation. He did a fabulous job of putting you in the hopeless bubble of, not only the sufferer, but those around them. Nonetheless, to hail this as a representation of clinical depression would be a disservice to those that suffer. Justine knows why she is ""sad"". What a boon for her.
The acting and cinematography were fantastic. It held my heartbeat in an unsteady rhythm for most of the movie, but I have to take two stars away for being so friggen depressing.

2950825,4,B000VSDNF0,"I will forgo a synopsis of the movie as others have done it better than I could have. This review is different like the movie is itself.

I have not seen any other ""LVT"" movies but I did read some reviews mentioning his other movies. I also noticed the dichotomy of reviews like a bell curve from 1-5 stars for this movie. I see clearly why that is. This movie is not aimed to please it's viewers. Most movies produced aim to please viewers and make them feel good and triumphant with a relaxed sense of relief and satisfaction, perhaps like a good meal. This movie uses the visual and musical mediums to provoke thought on a topic that most people have considered but have never experienced. Actually that statement is half true. It depends upon which part of the movie is referred to though it is all tied together.

First I had not read any reviews before watching and was unsure if this was a sci-fi or some other type of movie but I saw the cast of actors and thought it's free on amazon with prime so I cannot loose too much by watching it on my computer. (I was wrong. I think I should have (and still will) see it on a better quality video source).

This was the type of movie that you must have a blank slate brain to watch with no preconceptions of the topic. The topic is complex. I did forget my troubles of the day. The flow of the movie may seem confusing in the beginning but having patience I now understand the beauty and meaning of how this movie began. I fortunately had no one commenting about ""why did they...this and why did they that..."" I was able to absorb this artwork like a chef styles a complex meal, one course at a time actually one bite at a time with all senses engaged and with no desire to skip to desert. I almost want to see other movies by ""LVT"" but am a little skittish based on reviews. Perhaps I should have an open mind.

If you have ever pondered the meaning of life or the end of life as we know it this will fascinate you. If you don't mind delving into answers to questions you most probably have refused to ask then watch this movie. If you are looking for a no brainer to escape the troubles of the day and make you feel good then bypass this movie for now. Give it a chance later.

I personally was drawn into this and felt a parallel that is somewhat intimate and scary. I am more than appreciative of this movie in its entirety and will never forget it.",1334361600,6,2404,4.217391304347826
2950826,1,B000VSDNF0,"Wow! That sure is a big METEOR! (Sorta gives new meaning to The Magnetic Fields song ""I Don't Believe in the Sun,"" doesn't it?)

Too bad the whole movie makes NO SENSE; it's just a ""See? I told you so!"" wish-fulfillment trip, fleshed out to feature-length -- a ""justification"" for anyone who felt like, in their depressive misery, that the WHOLE WORLD should just END!

Grow up, Lars! (Or, wait: I guess it's TOO LATE for THAT, isn't it?)

Sit down, though! That's QUITE enough from YOU, thanks!

""It has been noted the some top-secret Nazi weaponry development was moved outside Germany, to such places as Blizna, Poland -- the same area where Allied aircrews first encountered the infamous 'foo-fighters,' small glowing balls of light that shadowed Allied bombers.  The 'foo-fighters' soon caught the attention of the American news media.  The 'New York Times,' on December 13, 1944, reported news authorized by the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Exepditionary Force.  'Floating Mystery Ball is New Nazi Air Weapon,' read the headline.  The story stated: 'Airmen of the American Air Force report that they are encountering silver-colored spheres in the air over German territory.  The spheres are encountered either singly or in clusters.  Sometimes they are semi-translucent ... The new device, apparently an air defense weapon, resembles the huge glass balls that adorn Christmas trees.  There was no information available as to what holds them up like stars in the sky, what is  in them or what their purpose is supposed to be.'""

'No.  It's a World War Two story, s'got nothing to do with Tinsel Town.'

'Go for it.'

'It was during the final stages of the war.  Himmler was the head of the Gestapo.  You remember Himmler, right?'

I nodded.

'Sometime in the early part of 1944, he was hosting an awards dinner for his men.  They had just finished a sumptuous meal, had drunk cases of the finest French Bordeaux rouge, when Himmler proudly got up to make a toast, celebrating their effort in the final solution.  Standing in front of a giant swastika, he removed his side pistol and clanged it against his glass, calling for quiet.  ""Gentlemen,"" he went on to say, ""in the future, history will record that one of our greatest accomplishments..."" Himmler took a pause for emphasis.  ""We did the thing we had to do while never losing our innate sense of decency."" '

Jerry then fell silent.  I dug deep trying to respond.  I even opened my mouth a couple of times, but nothing surfaced.

2950827,4,B000VSDNF0,"I realized just from watching this that it would be a difficult movie for many people to understand, but upon reading the numerous one-star reviews on here, I see how truly subtle this film is. Yes, a lot of the science is wrong, but that's really secondary to the nature of the movie. The plot might seem to move slowly if you don't understand the immense importance of each scene in creating and depicting the overall meaning of the movie, but as long as you're willing to work at it, you really will get a lot out of this movie. The film stayed with for precisely that reason -- I like having to think about things and work them out for myself, rather than being told what exactly to think and feel at particular points of the movie. I saw it last night and I'm still working through many of the finer points, and there are pieces that I think aren't ever really explained. However, I really love when a movie can end with an element of mystery and a feeling that it didn't all quite make sense, because that's how life is. We don't understand everything that happens, and if you don't mind being reminded of your true ignorance in an esoteric and subtle way, this movie is for you.",1334275200,5,1185,4.366515837104072
2950828,5,B000VSDNF0,"Despite the fact that it deals with such heady topics as depression, mental illness and the end of the world, ""Melancholia"" may well be the most ""accessible"" movie Lars Von Trier has ever made. Which really isn't saying all that much given that the vast majority of his oeuvre consists of works that are, to put it mildly, cerebral, arty, and non-commercial with a vengeance. In fact, this haunting, visionary masterwork is a bit like what ""2012"" might have been had it been designed as a bleak, metaphysical art-house film instead of as a crowd-pleasing, SGI-driven blockbuster.

Like ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Melancholia"" spends the first third of its running-time at a wedding, introducing us to the main characters and the various problems they face. Labeled ""Justine,"" Part 1 focuses on an attractive young woman (Kirsten Dunst) who obviously suffers from a debilitating form of clinical depression. Though she is clearly trying her best to put on a happy face for the guests who have come to see her tie the knot, Justine can't hide the crushing sadness that resides at her core. In addition, Justine and her sister, Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who is desperately trying to pull off a memorable event for her sister despite all the difficulties, also have to deal with the familial stress caused by a cantankerous father (John Hurt) and a hopelessly embittered mother (Charlotte Rampling).

After this deceptively prosaic opening, ""Melancholia"" throws us for a loop in Part 2, simply titled ""Claire."" For we discover that, in addition to the fact that Justine's depression has become almost crippling in its effect on the young woman, scientists have discovered an unknown planet - dubbed Melancholia - hitherto hiding on the other side of the sun that has recently broken out of its orbit and is now on a possible collision course with Earth. Needless to say, this grimmest of all possibilities hangs like a pall over the lives of the characters, like a death sentence passed on a race that daily denies its inherent fragility in the face of massive, impersonal forces of nature and a universe of crushing vastness.

The rogue planet becomes a symbol for all the unspecified fears and dangers, both real and imaginary, that we face everyday as a species - a species that, while it may be uniquely aware of its own mortality, is, nevertheless, willing to overlook that fact as the only means of making it through the day. Indeed, we make a pact with ourselves and each other that we won't acknowledge our own mortality. It's only at certain rare moments that we are forced as individuals to come face-to-face with the ephemeral nature of our existence - only now, thanks to Melancholia, all of humanity is having to do so at the same time. In many ways, Justine, with her depression that existed long before the threatened extinction of the planet, may be the most ""rational"" of all the characters in her reaction to the world around us - and, by extension, the cosmic end of humanity. And it is indeed she, at the end, who manages to not only cope best with the onrushing doom but to provide the strength the others need to come to terms with their fate.

As an apocalyptic fable, ""Melancholia"" possesses all the stark beauty and intellectual rigor of Ingmar Bergman at his finest. Von Trier also shares the Swedish master's ability to draw profoundly layered performances out of a superb ensemble cast. For, in addition to the actors and actresses already mentioned, there is stunning work here by ""24""'s Kiefer Sutherland and ""True Blood""'s Anthony Skarsgard as well.

No review of ""Melancholia"" could possibly hope to do the movie justice, for no words can come close to conveying the visceral impact the film has on its audience. It is a work of art that burrows deep into the viewer's psyche and forces us to ponder - however unwillingly - issues involving our own lives and how we choose to live them.

Mesmerizing and unforgettable.",1334275200,6,3944,4.852897473997028
2950829,4,B000VSDNF0,"mmh.  All these negatives comments.  Too many I would say.  What am I starting to think that all these negativity about this ""Great film"" is only the result of Lars von Trier's dark humor when he joked about ""understanding Hitler"".  He already said it was a joke.  Now, we all know Hollywood is run Jewish, but, is it Amazon now run by the Jewish too? This movie should have won the Oscar but it was rejected by the Director's bad comments(joking).  Now, the Jewish(who run Hollywood, not all) should be shamed of how bad they had portrait the American-Indians in their films and stop thinking that the world rolls around them.  For God's sake.
  Don't listen what other say about the movie.  Watch it and judge it.  Like the old saying, ""when the river sounds, it's because there is some flowing water""

about the Film.

  Beyond its technical ability with the great special effects and great art, the film unfolds a wonderful story.  A human story.  Don't expect some ""End Of The World"" where at the end of the movie the President have the biggest plane to save himself,,lol.  Go out and watch it without prejudice.

To me: This is one of the movies that will stay in my mind and will live in my heart for a couple of years.  If we don't all die in 2012,,hehe.

ps. Please, don't review any movie that you haven't watched in its entirely.",1334016000,4,1340,4.477178423236515
2950830,4,B000VSDNF0,"Quite frankly, if it weren't for the apocalyptic theme in this movie I might have never watched it. That being said, it did capture my interest in an odd way. You might be inclined to walk out of this movie during the first hour or so due to its slow nature, however, I think it is worth watching in its entirety. While I don't normally comment on specific actors, Melancholia, which is written and directed by Lars von Trier, warrants some mention of the main cast. Kirstan Dunst plays Justine, a young, pretty, mentally ill woman who gets hopelessly bogged down in depression and is borderline psychotic. Charlotte Gainsbourg does a remarkable job playing Justine's sister, Claire. Kiefer Sutherland, taking a dramatic turn from the role of Jack Bauer, plays Claire's husband, John, a wealthy and uptight amateur astronomer who owns the mansion and surrounding golf course where the story unfolds. Unlike in some other apocalyptic fiction, Von Trier does not rely on the ""emergency alert system"" or media elements to describe the cataclysmic events as they unfold - it is told almost entirely through the characters with minimal reference to any outside description. Melancholia, it turns out, is the name of a newly discovered planet, which scientists believe is going to come very close to earth in its trip through our solar system. It suffices to say that there is a slight ""margin of error"" in the scientist's predictions. Melancholia is more like a work of art than an action movie. It is not blunt. It certainly has some depth and is thought-provoking. While I would not recommend this movie to anyone that has a low tolerance for slow-moving movies, Melancholia does have some unique, indefinable rewards for those that are willing to invest their time and attention.",1333929600,9,1777,4.946488294314381

The movie is set in a timeless future on a wealthy estate during a wedding party just before the Earth is about to collide with the rogue planet called Melancholia. The film opens with a long slow motion sequence that depicts the ""Dance of Death"" of the two planets, and the principle characters in the film. The movie is then divided in two parts based on each of the two sisters: Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), as they deal with their difficulties and realizations about themselves, the people around them, and their bleak future. The film is a memorable and striking commentary about disenchantment with one's life, and facing one's imminent mortality.

I was committed to stick with it, although it didn't become much more coherent once the symphonic 10 minute slow-mo introduction was over. There were lots of subtly surreal moments, as well as those designed to overtly push our buttons, but in the end it is all clearly a meditation on death (perhaps through the lens of ""clinical depression"", but not limited by it). And the protagonist (Dunst), who was most effected by Melancholia (the approaching rogue planet), was the one most ready for (a good) death. The corollary is that the ones most in denial were the least accepting. Nothing revelatory here, but the fact it was even looked at may be.

This is a slick movie with high production value, great cast, and artful pretensions, but it surely isn't ordinary Hollywood. It is also one whose metaphors will stick with me for years.",1333497600,5,932,4.717791411042945

In the beginning, of the end, we are introduced to fresh faced bride Justine, played by dimpled cheeked Kirsten Dunst and her gorgeous tall soon to be husband Michael, played by Alexander Skarsgrd. The couple arrives two hours late for their own wedding ceremony! Disapprovingly, impatiently and anxiously, they are greeted by her sister Claire, played by the incomparable Charlotte Gainsbourg and Justine's curmudgeon of a brother in law John played by Kiefer Sutherland.

Rounding out this brilliant cast of wedding celebrants are John Hurt, Charlotte Rampling and Stellan Skarsg&auml;rd.

We instantly become wedding guests ourselves and are lead into the grand ballroom of the manor house for the proceedings. Much later, after the cake has been cut, all the guests are ushered outside onto the lawn to join in a charming tradition of writing congratulatory messages on small hot air balloon skins and sending them floating into the sparkling night sky. It was majickal!

Lars gives us tiny glimpses at a time into this privileged, yet terribly dysfunctional family. An undercurrent of uneasiness and outright spoken hostility casts a dark shadow over the festivities as the bride and groom are toasted by estranged family members.

Later, after all the guests have departed, Michael, soon learns that Justine has been barely holding herself together and is irrevocably damaged by major depression. She is incapable of any true relationship nor intimacy with him. Poor disillusioned Michael eventually packs his bag and leaves a broken man.

As the clock ticks tocks, Justine sinks deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole while Claire tries desperately to save her from the darkness while struggling with her own frailties and demons.

By the time we discover the true meaning of MELANCHOLIA, John is having a crushing epiphany! As he sees the light, he decides to take mortality into his own hands while leaving our two sisters to fend for themselves; holding on tightly to each others hands for dear life!

All i dare divulge without ***spoilers*** is that the ending will blow you away!

I hope that you take MELANCHOLIA to heart and love it as much as i did! It is truly a masterful treasure.",1333324800,2,2349,5.12303664921466
2950851,4,B000VSDNF0,"It really helps to have a background in the films of Lars von Trier. His films are not simple, and his characterizations are rich. The DVD extras are plentiful, including moments with the reclusive von Trier, explaining how he wrote it after a bout with clinical depression. Certainly, these are generally unlikeable characters, but its interesting how Claire (always in control) melts down and Justine (insecure and spoiled) trade characters. Sure, the action involved the privileged rich, whose money means nothing in the end, but there have already been plenty of ""end of the world"" movies about regular everyday people. If I didn't care for the characters involved, I was intrigued by the characterizations given by Kirsten Dunst and, especially, Charlotte Gainsbourg. I had little problem watching their development.

If you're new to the films of von Trier, I might recommend ""Breaking the Waves"", or even the unpleasant but powerful ""Dancer in the Dark"". Von Trier is especially known for creating fascinating female characters (Emily Watson and Bjork, respectively). The experimental ""Dogville"" will also remind you of why Nicole Kidman is an A-List actress of depth and focus.

""Melancholia"" is certainly not for everyone, but it's what I would expect from von Trier and I wasn't disappointed.",1333238400,6,1302,5.285024154589372
2950852,4,B000VSDNF0,"I thought this film was amazing. Beautiful to look at and full of metaphors, symbolism & concepts to think about. This is the kind of thing Lars is best at. He takes his time when telling a story - so the pace here is slower than that of a regular movie. All of the important stuff has been accurately covered by other reviewers here... not much to say that they haven't. If you like Lars past work and enjoy Art House fare... you're gonna' love this. (I bought it because I felt it was such a strong work).",1333238400,7,507,4.183673469387755
2950853,5,B000VSDNF0,"This is one of the best films of 2011, deeply philosophical and more than slightly pessimistic about human nature.  It is not for everybody, but if you like films that challenge your preconceptions, then this film is for you.",1333238400,7,225,4.769230769230769
2950854,5,B000VSDNF0,"I watched this movie at a very difficult time in my life, and that probably made it even better than if I had seen it at a happy time. I don't normally like Kristen Dunst, but the movie's premise (end of the world with no CGI or action) seemed to fit my mood. I completely agree with some of the reviewers here in that the pace of the movie, especially Kristen's character, was very indicative of depression and introspection. More than anything, I loved the beauty of the joy of sadness - if that makes sense. The feelings that this movie emotes are very raw and present. I thought it was beautifully acted, written and filmed. It is not a movie that I would recommend to many people, but for those that want to see it, I would recommend watching it when you are feeling uneasy about something, or introspective.",1333152000,5,813,4.426666666666667
2950865,2,B000VSDNF0,The concept of this movie was a good one.  The cinematography was absolutely fantastic.  the acting was actually quite superb.  the script is what just actually was terrible.  so in other words this movie is basically a polished turd.  its really sad because it really had serious potential and could have been absolutely great.,1333152000,,328,5.0
2950866,2,B000VSDNF0,"I was wary about watching this film, and I should have stuck to my misgivings rather than rent it. I must admit, I didn't watch all of it. The story moved along so slow that I skipped through much of the last half of the wedding scene and the next few days. I'm reasonable certain that I missed nothing because every time I stopped to check the story it was still not moving.

There was nothing redeeming about the main characters. All of them were annoying and mostly uninteresting and let's face it, if I wanted to see rich, dysfunctional people I could always catch up on the Republican Presidential candidates. The only character I had any sympathy for was Leo, who's only crime was to be born into the worst family ever. Fortunately, Leo didn't have to spend the rest of his life putting up with them.

I should stress that the acting in Melancholia was good to great...it's just that the characters and the story were written to be intentionally depressing, so it was like walking into an retirement home or a mental ward where no one was ever going to get well. This is a movie where the happy ending is that they all died.",1333152000,5,1130,4.427884615384615
2950867,1,B000VSDNF0,"We strongly suggest you do not watch this awful movie.  We made the mistake of doing so last night.

Worst movie with the most depressing feeling after.

It's about a super rich family (mansion with own private 18 hole golf course and lake and horses) who are unbelievably nuts,  dysfunctional and awful to each other.  A planet called ""Melancholia"" comes in and smashes into the earth and kills everyone.  The whole movie is filmed on the estate.",1333152000,3,447,4.740259740259741
2950868,1,B000VSDNF0,"when i started to watch this movie and i thought it was horrible and by the time the show finished i just want it to slash my wrist, removed my eyes from the eyes socket and take 3 bottles of valium. now i am depresived because i lost 2 hours of my life and spent money buying tickets........:(
btw....i wish i could rate the movie  minus 5!!!!",1332979200,4,344,4.134328358208955
2950869,2,B000VSDNF0,"Yes the movie is artsy, beautifully shot, with characters seriously flawed, withdrawn, and full of emotional pain. Big deal. I had no sympathy for any of them, nor did I care about their coming fate. Basically the characters paralleled the fate of the planet and both made for one big downer. Did Lars von Trier make a great movie? For me, no. I would have preferred seeing the characters explode in reaction to their coming fate. Sutherland doing Dunst as opposed to killing himself. I mean if its inevitable that you're all going to die, have some fun-get drunk, screw, take an acid trip, love everyone around you-anything but lay down and die like a bunch of whimpering losers.

And the portrayal of Earth's demise was just as weak, very unrealistic, and a huge let down on Trier's part as a director. Has this guy never cracked a science book? A planet that size slamming into Earth, come on. The earthquakes, the tidal waves, the fires and devastation-he barely touched on the atmosphere being sucked off. Like the characters, he sent the planet out like a whimpering baby with no fire or zest. Sadly this movie could have been so much more, but then, when a director writes and directs his own work that's usually what happens. There's no one there to tell him/her-hey, this sucks you need to rewrite this.",1332979200,8,1312,4.67965367965368
2950870,1,B000VSDNF0,"This movie is awful. I hate it. Love the actors are great, but horrible story line. Two thumbs down. Its about the world ending after an awfully sad wedding. Definitely don't watch if your planing a wedding.",1332806400,3,207,4.621621621621622
2950871,4,B000VSDNF0,"Whatever else this movie is supposed to be, it's a near perfect depiction of a nervous breakdown and how, as it destroys its victim, it can harm everyone else in its path.  The cinematography is superb and the theme music, which is extracted Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, is spot-on.

I will be seeing this one again, and I will keep my eye on the director and writer, Lars von Trier.",1332806400,4,383,4.457142857142857
2950872,5,B000VSDNF0,"I just rented this movie and had to post my review. Suffering from depression most of my life, I totally got this movie. I was a little confused in the beginning, but then realized it was a vision. A lot of people with anxiety/depressive disorders are more in tune, or sometimes highly psychic, having experienced knowing things myself. It runs in the family the depression along with prophetic dreams. I can't tell you how many times it's happened to me. The only side affect is the depression. This movie was done in excellent taste and I could not take my eyes off the TV. I highly recommend seeing this movie and trying to understand what it's like to be different. Many people won't get it or understand it and that is unfortunate. I loved it and give it a go...........",1332460800,6,775,4.542857142857143
2950873,2,B000VSDNF0,"I'm sorry, I know this movie was much acclaimed and I really wanted to like it - was looking forward to seeing it.  But, alas, the only thing I did enjoy was the first surrealist 10 or so minutes, which were visually stunning.  After that, I was just waiting for all the annoying characters to be eliminated (although the Justine character (Kristin Dunst) is somewhat redeemed of her irritating melancholy at the end of the movie).  There are 3 basically 3 parts to the movie - The Wedding, The sister of the Bride and The End.  As, I have said, the 3rd part was eagerly anticipated after sitting for over 2 hours watching this dysfunctional family await the inevitable.  I realize this was an art movie, but I think the movie could have moved along more quickly without loosing any of its substance.",1332460800,5,800,4.566433566433567
2950874,5,B000VSDNF0,"So many people suffer from depression and in so many different ways. This film is dead set on the actual mental illness/depression melancholia. Great film all around, will buy!!!",1332374400,5,178,5.172413793103448
2950885,1,B000VSDNF0,"To begin with there are two sorts of movies that are made. One is a film that entertains the masses, that type of film that you go to and walk out being completely entertained by. The other is the art film, a movie genre that can often times be included in the first category but more often than not is so full of itself that it offers no entertainment at all, just that pseudo intellectual crap that only people who think of themselves as above all others enjoy. I've never believed that they actually enjoy it but have felt that they want to impress those around them so much that they pretend to do so. These are the people who watch a film like Andy Warhol's EMPIRE, a static shot of the Empire State Building from 3AM until the next day, a think it's art. Give me a break.

This brings us to MELANCHOLIA. Directed by Lars von Trier, a director that the art house crowd holds in high esteem, the film is one of the most boring things I've ever witnessed. It begins with Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and her new husband en route to their wedding reception. Nearly 5 minutes time is spent with their stretch limo having problems getting around a winding curve as they try and help the driver and take turns driving themselves. They finally arrive and rather than greet their waiting guests, Justine insist on going to say hello to her favorite horse in the stables.

Over the next hour or so we simply witness the wedding reception, hear from various guests that are their and watch as Justine, hoping to find some sort of happiness in it all, continues to deal with the depression she is prone to. It doesn't work no matter how hard her family tries to help her (except for her mother played by Charlotte Rampling who piles on the reasons why marriage stinks).

As the movie progresses we find out that another planet it hurtling towards are own on a collision course. There is no last minute save here, no heroes trying to launch an atomic bomb at the planet or anything else, just the knowledge that the two will collide and everyone will die. The name they give this planet is Melancholia thus tying it into the whole depression motif witnessed throughout the film.

The second half of the film deals more with Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), the one who seemed under control and composed who took care of Justine's wedding and reception. Claire has no idea how to deal with the imminent demise of the world she knows, of her family and slowly begins to fall apart while Justine seems to accept the end calmly and coolly.

SPOILER ALERT

As these two sisters and Claire's son gather on the golf course her husband owns under a makeshift bunch of sticks they collected, Melancholia crashes into the planet and everyone dies. The end.

I cannot begin to explain how boring this movie was. From scenes of nothing more than people going through the motions of events to the back and forth dialogue that feels like it goes no where all I could think was when will this be over? This is not to say a movie filled with dialogue must be boring. MY DINNER WITH ANDRE was fascinating to watch and listen to. This movie just is...boring.

Not only does this movie bore the viewer to death it does little more than attempt to inspire a feeling of depression in it's viewers as well. Its as if von Trier said hey I feel depressed and I don't want to feel alone like this so let me try and make you feel just as bad. Are there people out there without enough problems in their own lives that they need to add to it by sitting through this sort of thing?

If you know someone who is eternally happy, who is care free without a fret in the world that you'd like to see brought down a bit then by all means recommend this film to them. By the end even they may be searching for a razor. If not then avoid this film at all costs and hope that von Trier either finds something to make himself happy or stops making movies.",1332201600,9,3920,4.403314917127072
2950886,1,B000VSDNF0,"Oh my gosh - why anyone would want to make this movie is beyond me, and why anyone would want to put money into it or star in it, is even farther beyond me.  Watching paint dry is better entertainment than this movie!  This is the most boring and depressing movie I think I've ever seen - it has absolutely no artistic, entertainment, or even educational value whatsoever.

Kirsten plays a very depressed woman - and she plays it well. Being around depressed people is truly depressing - choosing to watch them for entertainment value is insane and not in the least entertaining or rewarding. Do you really want to spend over 2 hours watching someone be depressed? Through most of this movie she looks horrible as well, as does the woman who plays her sister. Even the end of the world in this movie is unspectacular.

Do not waste your time and money on this one.",1332201600,5,864,4.484076433121019
2950887,3,B000VSDNF0,"So the first 1/2 of the movie, before the planet is discovered.  It's odd, I'm sure it's meant to be artful.  But people that can't relate to each other, can't relate to your either.  The rudeness and unabashed inconsideration of some of the characters is so bad, that you wonder if those characters are even real.  It seems there is a great deal of back story which, we are not privy to, so anything these characters do, appears random.",1332201600,,437,4.493670886075949
2950888,2,B000VSDNF0,"Positive:
The acting, visuals, effects, location and sound both the silence and the background music were nicely crafted.

Negatives:
Schizoid storyline. For 3/4th (about one hour) we have a fearful and slightly manic-depressive bride whose pragmatic sister (already married into a wealthy family) is footing the bill her aforementioned unstable sister's wedding. The soon to be bride seems to be in the perfect relationship but is testing the resolve of her family with her slightly unpredictable behaviors. Really not that interesting as we watch people eat, drink and congratulate each other for an hour. The only thing that rescues one from falling asleep is the cinematography.
The final 1/4th (about half an hour) is about some planet (called Melancholia) that appears out of nowhere and is heading toward Earth on a collision course. There might be some symbolic metaphorical connection between the potential doom from the planet collision and the bride's mental state but it's really fabricated tenuous and adds nothing to understanding the bride.

The physics, and they had an Astrophysicist advisor, was almost as bad as the movie ""Another Earth"". In both a planet from outside our solar system is heading on a collision course for Earth. In this case we have this alien larger gas planet doing some ridiculous loop-to-loop around the Earth; then heads off but then suddenly reverses course to head back. Pleaseee! With script writers and advisors like this it's no wonder that US citizens are more likely to believe myth/superstition at an 80% greater rate than conflicting science based facts and reason.",1332115200,4,1616,5.235521235521236
2950889,1,B000VSDNF0,"In the begening it was interesting, then all at once the story just fell off
the real planet. very dissapointed in the movie, im sure im not the only one that wants there money back for this rental.
not what was in the preview, but then all the movies use the good parts for the previews to real you in don't they??",1332028800,3,315,4.096774193548387
2950890,1,B000VSDNF0,"I don't understand the point, unlike the planets colliding at the end, whatever this movie is supposed to be about, it missed me.

At the beginning there is a slo-mo-picture thing - don't know what its about.

Then the movie becomes motion and starts with Kirsten Dunst in a wedding gown, in the back of a limo, riding with the groom, they're on their way somewhere, the limo is to wide for the road, I guess the couple walks to an estate where everyone else is already arrived, her sister is p.o.'d, Kirsten delays longer to go say hello to a horse and keeps everyone waiting all evening. At one point she simply takes a bath. So does her mother. It's all cuckoo.

The second half focuses on the Kirsten's sister. Nothing special. Just life. She buys a bottle of pills to kill herself in case Melancholia hits earth. Her husband the whole time insists nothing will happen, Melancholia will miss earth, but finds out he is wrong, steals his wifes pills and kills himself. Leaving his wife and son behind to deal with catastrophe and Kirsten.

The scenery is beautiful. But I attribute that to the countryside it was filmed in.

I had to fast-forward the last five minutes, I couldn't take it anymore. I really tried. I found the answer I was looking for, Melancholia collided with earth, the end.

I should've read the reviews before renting the movie. Apparently, someone named Lars - who is quite a big deal somewhere - suffered from depression and this is what begat of it. It has been insinuated that Americans especially, only want to see happy movies and that we cannot handle depression or ""bad moods"" or anything realistic because ""it"" makes us uncomfortable. It is my opinion that most of us have relatives as self-absorbed as Kirsten Dunst,that I feel it unfair to pay $3.99 to watch self-absorbed relatives (the characters mother and father) on the screen. There is enough crap in the world, that having to sit through someone's psychotic view of the end of the world, and that somehow the depressed are better equipped to deal with the world ending, is unbelievable. Step outside your door and mingle with the public and you will experience numerous Kirsten-Dunst-characters, there is nothing special about it. If we ignore it in everyday life, yet see it on the screen and call it art or beauty, then perhaps someone is out of touch.",1332028800,3,2346,4.682038834951456
2950891,5,B000VSDNF0,"It was a beautiful film, I do believe that people with depression react to tragidy more calmly, it was gloom and doom, but it was a good film.",1331942400,8,142,4.107142857142857
2950892,5,B000VSDNF0,"I knew before watching this film that many people were going to hate it.  Then again, most of the films that I seek out are going to be hated by many people.  The fact is... most people simply want to be entertained by movies.  Anything that makes them uncomfortable, or god forbid ""bored"" is seen simply as a nuisance.  Sadly this kind of thinking isn't just prevalent in the visual arts.  How many people are willing to read literature that aims at being much more than entertainment? Or even anti-entertainment in some cases?

In this sense, society has been on a backward slide for some time now.  People don't want reality in movies.  They want an escape.  Melancholia is a film that shows people... flawed people, (like we all are) in a situation that really isn't too far fetched.  Very little time is spent on what most ""end of the world movies"" focus on.  You see enough to know what's going on, but you don't see a lot of action shots of what people all over the world are doing in reaction to this supposed threat.  This is a film that deals with the inner space of humans as much as it does with the threat from outer space.

What I find the most shocking, is that people don't seem to be nearly as put off by films that are full of violence, as they are by films that focus on difficult emotions.  What does this say about our society?
Depression is a very real issue, and a growing issue in our time.  Yet we don't want to think about it.  I think this might be because we know that the answers are difficult to deal with, and some big changes would have to be made to really deal with the underlying problems in our society.  This would surely cause people to do things they don't want to do...and lets face it... they would probably get bored in the process.

I'm not trying to be mean here... we can't blame individuals 100% for this, when we've all been conditioned to some degree by something larger than ourselves.  But I think it's important to keep all of this in mind when taking in a piece of artwork.  Of course there are times for just being entertained, and movies that are meant for this purpose.  Let's just not forget that there's so much more out there to explore.  Sometimes a film is meant to teach us about things that we don't want to face, and there's merit in this.  To just say ""it's boring"" or ""this movie was just awful"" really isn't a review.  It's just a reaction.  Lets slow down and be mindful of what we're experiencing.",1331942400,11,2465,4.353070175438597

The movie looked gorgeous in Blu-ray.  The performances of the actors was top notch.  You could feel that the movie was well put together.. But I could not raise any sympathy or empathy for any of the main characters from the outset thru to the conclusion.

It is really in the characters that this movie fails me.  I found everything about them unbelievable -- sure I understand that the situation in the movie is supposed exacerbate bad behavioral traits, but I was done with everyone of them before their stories even emerged.

I found the special features informative but I could barely keep my anger in check every time the director talked... And Gainsbourg spoke so slowly that I played her interview at 1.5x speed -- although what she had to say was interesting.

When the movie was over, I was just glad it had ended.  I will have to think twice before ordering another Von Trier movie.  What he had tattooed on his hand in the special feature is what he did to those of us who sat through his story.

2950906,2,B000VSDNF0,"Director Lars Von Trier is clearly a very unhappy person.  His world seems to be populated entirely by disagreeable, self-absorbed, and clinically depressed people who tend to wander aimlessly about in vast empty landscapes.  He also wants us to know up front that this is to be an ""Art"" film, so he begins with a collage of abstract imagery filmed in a hyper-realistic, super slow motion style which is accompanied by some wildly inappropriate Wagnerian music.  Perhaps the music is meant to be ironic.  As if all this weren't enough to prove his Art Film credentials, we soon learn that this world is about to be destroyed by a rogue planet.  Doom and gloom reign.  Along the way, we are treated to the usual shaky hand-held camera work, mysteriously burning paintings, and several symbolic clues - to what?  (One of these is a horse that refuses to cross a bridge, which I gather is a reference to one of the director's previous films - the ultimate film geek reference).  All of this is filmed in the curiously flat and colorless manner of bad digital camerawork, which quite simply drains the life out of every scene.  In 40 years of movie watching, I have never had a more disagreeable experience.

Mr. Von Trier is no doubt a skilled, if not a natural, filmmaker who wants his audience to be just as miserable as he is.  Don't go there.",1331856000,4,1343,4.624472573839663

The photography is stunning, the acting is top-notch, and if you are willing to give it a chance, Melancholia may grow on you.

What I think others and myself appreciate about this film is it's documentary-like commentary on the state of a human condition that no one wants to talk about. Others have wrote that this is a film about loss, destruction, and internal and external implosion. I agree. What I appreciate about this film is its ability to take human emotion and not exploit it and pigeonhole it's multiplicity as this ""look-at-me"" destructo-force. Most loss, destruction, etc. is silent, subtle, and incremental, making it thus the more heartbreaking. It's not a rational movie, it's not a movie about reason- but something more humane- struggle and pain. A thoughtful rendition of such concepts. The absurdity of the movie is the heart of the movie!

The first part focuses primarily upon Justine (Kirsten Dunst), who is celebrating her new marriage at her brother-in-law's (Keifer Sutherland) luxurious villa.  It starts out as basic wedding fodder--some humorous scenes between Justine and her new beau (Alexander Skarsgard), some strangely touching ones between her and her father (John Hurt)--before slowly disintegrating into the madness that we know to expect from Lars von Trier.  The second part of the film focuses more upon Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), as she copes with the knowledge that a strange planet called Melancholia is slowly approaching Earth.

MELANCHOLIA is, at its heart, a chronicle of desperation (perfectly captured by Dunst, who gives a truly grave, often unsettling, performance).  It's also a film of the fantastic, a film that wears its bleakness on its sleeve.  While not as visually upsetting as Trier's previous film ANTICHRIST (about which I STILL have not made up my mind, except to say that it genuinely affected me), MELANCHOLIA contains some imagery that cuts straight to the core in both its beauty and its subtle horror.  The visuals are enhances by the film's performances, notably from Sutherland, the Skarsgards (Stellan and Alexander), Hurt, and Charlotte Rampling. (Look also for Udo Kier and Jesper Christensen, both underused).  Credit must also go to cinematographer Manuel Alberto Claro, and Trier's minimalist script.

Ultimately, MELANCHOLIA falls into the same category as most of Trier's films: it will touch you or it won't.  I won't say love and hate; that's far too simple for a film of this magnitude.  MELANCHOLIA is a true work of art; whether it succeeds or fails depends entirely upon the individual viewer. One thing you cannot deny, though: it is truly a beautiful piece of filmmaking.",1331683200,10,2028,5.260869565217392
2950911,5,B000VSDNF0,"I thought this at turns absolutely lovely and heart-rendering, (the first several minutes, and the last several), and at other times very slow, and vexing (very slow pace, and the characters are not very likeable). But...I do think the pacing and the characters are as they are for a reason--to contextualize the end of the world no less. We spend so much of our time servicing our futures; I think it truly brilliant the way this movie made me think of a situation where nothing truly mattered anymore, not the past, not the present or the future, a tragically beautiful and frightening contemplation. Justine knows things, so she places Albrect Durers notable contemplation of everyday midaeval life on the shelf, so we can see when it is reduced to ashes by a planet named for one of his works (presumably named for one of his works), along with the world it contemplated. I thought Justines reaction very plausible, and it resonated with me. There have been times when I have been deeply depressed and, while not suicidal, thought that death was a blessing: finally an end to all of this constant struggle and pain. I think she felt something similar, and therefore Melencholia was not such a tragedy for her. You don't often get that kind of depth and scope in a movie...no car chases or ""kick-ass"" chicks here...just the end of everything we know.",1331683200,8,1353,4.761702127659574
2950912,5,B000VSDNF0,"I am an avid fan of Lars Von Trier and collect all of his films but during the first half of Melancholia I was almost prepared to give it only 3 stars (with an extra star just because its Lars), however bored and disinterested the film may have left me feeling during its initial chapter titled 'Justine,' the end of the latter and the whole of the second chapter did manage to enthrall and enchant.  I'm accustomed to being mentally, visually and intellectually stimulated and hypnotized by his films almost immediately and it took longer for that to happen this time around.  The story of Melancholia is a meditation on that subject as symbolized by a young woman who suffers from that condition and a planet also called by that name.  I won't give away too much of the story but can confirm it will not disappoint, its a very romantic film for Trier, with exquisite shots and probably his most accessible storyline to date.  His penchant for offending certain viewers isn't anywhere to be found in this film and its not heavily layered with meaning and contradiction like many of his other projects so the interpretation of the film is quite clear.  The film is a lyrical mediation on sadness, fear, anxiety and acceptance of reality and his characters are psychologically well portrayed.  Ms. Dunst is cast against type as she portrays the depressed main character and the woman pulls it off with remarkable finesse.  A far cry from bouncy smiley debutant type this is strong role for Kirsten and punches through any pre-concieved notions one might have of her as an actress.  So here again Lars earns five stars from me.  Cannot wait to see what he will tackle next.",1331683200,9,1671,4.695205479452055
2950913,1,B000VSDNF0,"Is Melancholia the worst movie I've seen in the past 10 years? No, I think that award would have to go to Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"". In Spielberg's defense however, WOTW actually has a plot. A stupid plot, but more of a plot than Melancholia. Melancholia begins with slow-motion sequences, and doesn't pick up its pace much from that point on. Basically, throughout the movie, the cast of unlikeable characters waits for the planet ""Melancholia"" to either hit or pass by the Earth. The film ends up being an over-the-top artsy mess, which leaves its viewers hoping the end (of the Earth and the movie) comes sooner, rather than later. Yes, there is some beautiful photography, but the film is filled with so much nonsense and illogical behavior, that many scenes could have been cut, and it wouldn't have made any difference in the film's continuity. The director chose to shoot this movie with video cameras (most of which were hand-held--very artsy) rather than film cameras, and I can only imagine that he felt sub-consciously that it wasn't worth wasting expensive film on this pile of mess.

2950914,4,B000VSDNF0,"My first advice, along with other viewers, is to watch a second time. My thoughts while watching were of Carl von Drier and Ordet.  Where that was about people trying to come to grips with their faith, eventually guided by a Christ imitating figure capable of miraculous ressurection, Melancholia is the perfect inverse of that scenario.  Rather than the mad messianistic brother in Ordet, we have the mad, near-catatonic, hopeless Dunst - the only figure who can guide her sister and nephew into pain and death, in a world that has no g-d or after life: ""No one will miss us.""  The close was weirdly beautiful and I think the film is at least worth one try for everyone, even if you have to break it down into 1/2 hour segments to keep from being bored.

As others have also suggested, check out Another Earth and The Tree of Life, since they have similar plot structures/themes.  All three are really wonderful, striking films.",1331683200,5,929,4.674846625766871
2950935,3,B000VSDNF0,"Danish director Lars von Trier got into a bit of trouble last year when he made some controversial comments at the Cannes Film Festival, where he had previously enjoyed a great deal of success with his films. It's unfortunate, because the film he premiered there, Melancholia, was great, even earning its lead, Kirsten Dunst, the festival's award for Best Actress. The film, split into halves, focuses on two sisters -- Justine, whose wedding reception makes up the first half of the film, and Claire, in whose house the reception is held and where Justine spends the second half of the movie suffering from depression. At the same time, Earth is on a collision course with another planet called Melancholia, guaranteeing the end of human life, and each character finds different ways to cope. Melancholia is bolstered primarily by Dunst's powerhouse performance and by von Trier's distinct and personal vision of depression and destruction. It's not what you would call a ""feelgood"" movie, but it's poignant and beautifully shot, for those who are interested.",1331596800,5,1060,5.132947976878612

I was so engrossed in what I was seeing and hearing while trying to understand the characters and their relationships that when the last minutes of the film make it very clear what is happening I was just stunned. I have viewed it three more times and get more from it with each viewing. I did not find it at all depressing.

2950937,4,B000VSDNF0,"It would be unjust of me to critique Melancholia without first admitting that I didn't finish it with a complete understanding of what I had just seen. I can recite the specifics of the plot and it's not an impenetrable film, but if we were to get into the semantics of subtext, symbolism, and meaning; I would come up short. I think writer/director Lars von Trier would be unsatisfied with his own genius if someone completely understood the film upon first viewing anyway. This admission does not, I feel, make me any less capable of reviewing the film. A review is often a first impression, rarely written with finality. Indeed, there's also the chance that I understood everything there was to understand about the film and am reading too deeply into it. Von Trier has never been a director preoccupied with subtlety.

Melancholia is von Trier's latest film, following his beautiful and brilliant film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Antichrist/dp/B003KGBISO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Antichrist</a>. That film was his first foray into the horror genre, while this latest film has him dipping into science-fiction. Much of the scenario warrants the science-fiction label and the plot, at face value, could serve a mainstream disaster film but this is a von Trier film and Melancholia toys with elements of science-fiction without ever becoming science-fiction. It would be much too linear, too easy and it's an interesting move for von Trier to even skim the surface of the genre as reluctantly as he does. The idea reportedly came to him while he was struggling with depression and a therapist commented that people suffering from depression remain calm in stressful situations. Von Trier responds to this by putting his characters into an end-of-the-world scenario. The plot concerns two sisters and a planet called Melancholia that's expected to collide with Earth. It's not entirely important though as Melancholia is concerned more with expression than exposition.

The title of the film and planet give insight into what von Trier is attempting to accomplish. According to Wikipedia, Melancholia is a mood disorder of non-specific depression, characterized by low levels of both enthusiasm and eagerness for activity. Furthermore, in ancient usage, it encompassed mental disorders that would now be called schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder. After seeing the film, I found this to be a fascinating revelation; one that makes the film seem a bit more heavy-handed in retrospect.

Much like Antichrist, Melancholia begins with an attention-grabbing opening sequence, similarly stylized and equally beautiful although not as easy to follow. There are shots of a lugubrious looking Kirsten Dunst, the Earth, the moon, and the rogue planet that gives the film its title. It concludes with a shot of Melancholia colliding with Earth. Von Trier wouldn't want his audience in suspense for the next couple hours. The film is separated into two parts (entitled ""Justine"" & ""Claire""), each running about an hour long. Part one opens at the lavish wedding reception of Justine (Dunst) and Michael (Alexander Skarsgrd), hosted at the mansion of Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland). As Justin arrives, she notices a red star in the sky. John informs her that it's Antares, the main star in the Scorpio constellation.

The reception is swimming with familiar faces, including John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling (as Justine and Claire's estranged parents, Dexter and Gaby), Stellan Skarsgrd as Justine's boss Jack, Jack's nephew Tim (Brady Corbet), and Udo Kier as the quirky wedding planner who refuses to look at Justine because she's ""ruined"" his wedding. The familiar faces all bring separate kinds of strife to the reception, beginning with a short, but stinging argument between Dexter and Gaby during a toast. Gaby is a cold, confrontational woman and John eventually retaliates by throwing her luggage outside. It becomes clear that Justine suffers from depression and even during her wedding party, she falls into bouts of sadness. Claire and John, who are footing the bill, grow frustrated over Justine's inability to appear happy and that's not even all of it. Emotions of all different kinds run high, but they're understated. Von Trier is not one for subtlety, but he strays far from theatricality too. The wedding party concludes with perhaps the most depressing ending to a wedding party ever put on film. This happens 63 minutes in. This detail could make or break someone's decision to see this film.

Part two is a different animal, with much of the focus turning to Claire. The planet Melancholia has been hiding behind the sun and Claire fears it will collide with Earth in five days, although John is confident that it's merely going to beautifully pass by. With no suspense to keep us guessing, we're allowed to more closely follow and analyze the characters.

The intimate cinematography makes frequent use of handheld cameras and the zoom feature, a technique that will frustrate many. It's an effective approach, which brings the audience closer to the drama. The film alternates between quiet, intimate moments/conversations between characters to moments of cinematic art punctuated by the somber music from Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. This music becomes the film's main theme and greatly complements the beautifully murky atmosphere. It's a beautifully dreary and (yes) melancholy film to behold.

The meaning of the word ""pretentious"" has been unfairly stigmatized by its overuse in regards to challenging films. Oftentimes, pretentious has become a euphemism for ""I didn't understand this film."" Its negative connotations make it difficult to use in serious film discussions. It's unfortunate, because pretentious is not necessarily an insulting term. Von Trier is a pretentious filmmaker whose films aren't challenging due to subject matter alone, but because they're so heavy, so serious, they can be difficult to labor through. Melancholia is as sad as the characters that inhabit it and there's nary a moment of happiness. It's so serious, so consistently downbeat it has a staggering effect since a single viewing can't do complete justice to this film, but it's unlikely you'll want to sit through it more than once.

As heavy and emotional as the material is, it's an emotionally cold film that never evoked a similar emotional response from me. It fascinated me at times, but never rocked me. I never found it tedious, but I can guarantee many viewers will. On the flipside, many viewers think it was one of the best films of last year. I'd agree, but it wouldn't make my shortlist.

When Melancholia premiered at Cannes, more press was given to Lars von Trier's failed attempt at humor than to Kirsten Dunst's Best Actress win. It seems that Dunst has been making a conscious effort to establish herself as a truly serious actress, straying from the mainstream in favor of more challenging independent films. This is certainly the most mature, adult role she's approached. It's a delicate performance, highly emotional and psychologically complex that Dunst doesn't overplay and, perhaps as a result, I'm not floored by her performance. Perhaps I didn't anticipate how quietly emotional it would be. I may have expected less subtlety. She does kind of play second fiddle to Gainsbourg in the latter half anyway. After her performance in Antichrist, Gainsbourg has a tough job trying to impress the audience further but her performance is on par with Dunst's. Sutherland also gives a mature performance that reminds us of what he gifted actor he can be with solid material.

Melancholia is a pretentious (no insult intended), challenging film that both fascinates and perplexes me. Even with a deeper understanding of it, I'd find it hard to love but I respect and admire it greatly on several levels. It's definitely what the average moviegoer would negatively refer to as an ""art film"" though. Those who like von Trier will find things to appreciate, those who don't won't find much to change their minds, and those unfamiliar with his work should approach with caution. I certainly can't help but admire a filmmaker who makes me think about his film, even if he fails to make me enjoy it.

For me, it always comes with great excitement when a new Lars Von Trier film comes out, as you really do not know what you are going to get. This film in particular is one that you either love or you hate. Personally, I loved it. The film is essentially two halves of polar opposite characters. Kirsten Dunst's performance is brilliant and courageous, as a depressed, but calm bride. A highly stressed, Charlotte Gainsborough carries the second half of the film as their peril becomes clearer. But it's the uneasiness of the end-of-the-world theme and the situation of the inevitable which gives the film a strange foreboding of fear, which for me, actually made me question my own existence and reflect on how I would react in the situation.

2950940,3,B000VSDNF0,"This morning I finally forced myself to finish watching ""Melancholia,"" Lars von Trier's end-of-the-world extravaganza.  It wasn't the film's length that had compelled me, a few weeks ago, to stop halfway through (I'm a sucker for long films), nor was it the subject matter or pacing.  I simply didn't care to find out how it all -- and I mean All -- ends.  You wouldn't think that a film depicting a vast planet hurtling towards Earth could be so lacking in drama, so dull and flaccid.  As the credits rolled, all I could think was...""That's it?""  Not to the end of the world, but the movie itself.  Perhaps that's von Trier's point, that once we're gone there'll be no-one to comment or reflect on the fact that we're gone.  The End will be the end.  But I couldn't help thinking that in the hands of a Bergman or a Bu&ntilde;uel, I'd be left with something to think about, some point of view to consider.  Von Trier does drop a hint now and then; one of the main characters says, ""The human race is evil, no-one will miss it.""  Okay, I guess.  But as she's a narcissistic, self-destructive drudge suffering from crippling depression, the statement doesn't have the impact it might coming from a rational, sensible person who's come to that conclusion after intelligent, soul searching meditation.  ""Melancholia,"" beautiful as it is to watch and professionally performed by its game cast, takes the easy way out.  Life is crap, so are People, boom, it's over and it's no big deal.

Maybe I missed a point or two because I didn't quite understand what was wrong with the central character. The film's pace was a little different yes but it was effective no. A bride is feeling moody, drunk, unwell, happy, unhappy all at once. Her sister's piercing looks are getting the worse of her but she is trying not to care. Minutes into her marriage she commits adultery. There is also an end - of - earth situation which is running parallel to her story of being unhealthy. Amidst all this there is a bad relationship between two sisters which is rather uncomfortable to watch. The climax is finally when things get into motion and what happens is well...justified?

But the whole affair seemed really pointless. It was not even arty or fun to watch. The entire texture or the mood of the film is coarse. This is not the film you will look back in four years for inspiring moments, even the grief didn't transpire or move me as an audience member. Although I didn't hate the film, I feel inclined to mention my opinion cause I'm pretty sure I saw the same film as the others.

2011 was a year where another similar science fiction was made, I suggest you go try that one too. It's called Another Earth and it is much better, more capable and somehow doesn't act like an excuse a bad student makes for failing a class.

2950942,4,B000VSDNF0,"The opening prologue makes us aware of the approaching cataclysm,Melancholia the planet is hurtling towards Earth. The movements of the spirit parallels astronomical events,showing us the relations of humans to the world at large. Time seems to stand still or to slow to adagio. Kirsten Dunst seems to float in the water like Ophelia. Breughel's Hunters in the Snow burns,referencing Tarkovsky's Solaris. The soul and planet Earth stand in for each other. Von Trier has said the film is about his own depression. But expressing it can be a positive.

Two sisters,Justine(Dunst) and Claire(Gainsborough)are polar opposites: Justine, the younger one, is sensitive and prone to depression, while her older sister Claire is rational, protecting of her sister, nurturing and tolerant. We have a family wedding melodrama in Dogme vein(luxurious version).There is emotion and humour,but also suffocation with Justine the outsider. Wagner's Tristan und Isolde gives a romantic tenor to the bleakness. The two sisters could be seen as two sides of the same person.

Claire is rationalistic,controlling,represents normality,caring for her sister in her helpless state of depression, for whom the world is too much. However Claire has something to lose,her illusions,she would panic with catastrophe. While Justine roasts(with the glow of melancholy) in the shadow of death,Claire is numbed motionless inexpectation of the planet's impact. Claire is unable to deal with the reality. There is no place in her world for an instant end to everything, for her son never seeing adulthood, all futures preempted. But for Justine ""the Earth is a cruel place that is nothing to mournfor.""

Justine's vision unclouded by illusions that protect the ego from reality,means she does not fear death. She gets stronger,cold but comforting,catastrophe's enliven her. Melancholy casts its raw light on things,destroying distinctions between life and death. The parallel between Earth and humankind disintegrates. The film's slow pace, its recurring leitmotif-like sentences and images in place of a narrative, offer the viewer a condition rather than a story. Here, Wagner's music, with its characteristic stasis, its unwillingness to develop freely, serves Trier as an appropriate backdrop. There is no other way to put it: this film is the phenomenon of melancholy itself. Call it existentialist: we are ruthlessly thrown into the universe with no chance of escape. Even the Earth itself is vulnerable.

Von Trier creates through female heroines. In Melancholia is a female protagonist who is strong by virtue of her weakness, but who here moves no mountains, and makes no sacrifice of herself or others. Her power lies merely in her understanding the merciless, impartial logic of the heavenless sky. She leads her loved ones, Charon-like, through the cataclysm. The scene playing out around her is already overshadowed by what she is long accustomed to, so for her there is no struggle. For Claire Apocalypse is now.

2950944,3,B000VSDNF0,"When the end credits on Lars von Trier's 136 minute movie Melancholia began to roll, my first inclination was to run screaming down the theater isle condemning von Trier and demanding my money back. I mean it. I was pure rage at that moment and I vowed to my boyfriend (extraordinary author Christopher Rankin, [...]) that I would tell everyone I met and post all over Facebook how frustrating and boring this movie was and how no one should see it. Seriously, von Trier is going to just take out planet Earth with a whimper in 30 seconds after forcing me to spend my final 2 hours on the planet with a dysfunctional family at a wedding? I don't even like attending boring weddings with my closest family and friends in toe so I sure as hell don't want to spend my final moments of life suffering through the main character Justine's wedding if there's not going to be a big payoff afterward. I felt cheated and manipulated and was convinced that mind-altering substances must have been running rampant in the screening rooms where reviewers like J. Hoberman of the Village Voice and others decided that this movie about the end of the world made them feel ""light, rejuvenated and unconsciously happy.""

Then it dawned on me. I didn't hate this movie. In fact, I really liked this movie. And the reason I liked it is because this movie is really a subtle and suspenseful horror movie, and I love horror movies. That's right, Melancholia is really a movie about the Devil coming back to Earth in the form of a human being to quietly watch in amusement as the planet and all of God's creatures are destroyed. Justine (played by Kirsten Dunst) wasn't simply a woman suffering from depression. She was possessed by the Devil, who came back to Earth to watch the end of days. That's really the only way you can explain her behavior in this movie. She is extremely careless with her new husband's feelings at the wedding and actually cheats on him with a stranger during the reception for God's sake. And there's a scene right before the worst happens where Justine tells her terrified sister that she knows that they are alone in this world and there is no God or Heaven. ""The earth is evil--we don't need to grieve for it,"" she says, following with the observation that ""I know we're alone.""

Religious types (and Kevin Spacey's character Roger ""Verbal"" Kint in the movie The Usual Suspects) will tell you that the best thing the Devil can do is make you think he doesn't exit, and Justine is adamant in her apparent divine knowledge of the fact that there is no life after death. All the while, she couldn't be more content with what is going on around her and the fact that everyone is going to die. She even goes outside for a nude erotic bath in the middle of the night a mere couple of hours before Earth is going to be wiped off the map. With someone sitting so pretty while the world collapses all around her, she would have to be the Devil right?

People say that Lars von Trier pushes boundaries and is controversial in his films. Well, I say the only problem with von Trier's Melancholia is that he didn't take this Devil theme far enough. Although von Trier and others have indicated that this movie is just about depression, there is some additional support for my theory that Justine is really the Devil. The name of the planet that is going to inevitably hit Earth and kill all of humankind is called Melancholia, and the words ""melancholia"" and ""melancholy"" have specifically been used countless times throughout history in literature and discussions about the Devil and demonic possession. ""Melancholy"" is defined as ""sadness or depression of the spirits,"" and ""melancholia"" is a ""mental disorder characterized by severe depression, guilt, hopelessness, and withdrawal."" See [...]. ""[D]emonic possession was often linked with melancholy, itself an illness which covered a vast array of symptoms,"" and ""suicidal impulses [such as those exhibited by Justine] were often seen as evidence of demonic activity."" Almond, Philip C., Demonic possession and exorcism in early modern England: contemporary texts and their cultural contexts (Cambridge University Press, 2004). Indeed, the origin of melancholia in humans was often linked ""with the fall of Adam himself, with the work of the devil's tongue."" Schiesari, Juliana, The Gendering of Melancholia: Feminism, Psychoanalysis and the Symbolics of Loss in Renaissance Literature (Cornell University Press, 1992).

Those who know me will probably say that I try to make every movie into a horror movie. There may be some truth to that, and I know that you readers out there probably won't buy my Devil theory about Melancholia. Instead, you'll just appreciate the film for its score, artistry and beautiful cinematography, and that is just fine. Those things were all top notch. The bottom line for me, though, is regardless of whether or not Justine is really the Devil, I spent an hour discussing this film with my boyfriend after we left the theater and I've always thought a movie must be good if it gets you thinking and talking, even if you don't actually enjoy the movie-going experience itself. (See my forthcoming review of Dogtooth for a great example). With immediately forgettable movies like The Inn Keepers being released right now, it is a nice change of pace to have a movie like Melancholia actually make you feel something and get your blood boiling.

And maybe, just maybe, those reviewers I mentioned before who said this movie made them feel incredibly happy are really just the Devil's minions sent to Earth to gleefully watch God's children suffer through this film.

2950955,5,B000VSDNF0,"""Melancholia"" is one of the most surprising and enjoyable films that I've seen in years. Maybe it was the mood I was in, assisted by a 'chaw' of K-2 incense.

The film's ""story"" is told primarily through absolutely stunning ""visuals"".  Don't miss one second of the film's opening sequence.  Like Stanley Kubrick's ""2001 Space Odyssey"", ""Melancholia"" begins with a sequence of slow motion scenes, each more visually arresting than the previous.  The entire 12 minute sequence is set to the thrilling crescendo of Wagner's opera score for ""Tristan and Isolde"".  [Throughout the entire film the background music is wonderful; come prepared to appreciate it all.]  This opening sequence ends with an amazing space shot of a monster planet crashing into, and completely obliterating a much smaller planet which looks like the planet earth.  Every shot in this opening sequence is a visual treat, and each is directly related to, and foretells the story that unfolds.

Like ""2001 Space Odyssey"", this movie is not for everyone.  An elderly, 70-plus  couple sitting behind us in the theater whispered very loudly (several times) to her hard-of-hearing mate: ""This is a very strange movie!!"". Indeed it is.  And it's wonderful!!

After the stunning opening sequence, the story/plot unfolds with a minimalist, intelligent dialogue that is focused on the film's principle purpose -- an honest but sympathetic depiction of serious, clinical depression (or what used to be called ""melancholy"").

Several immediate family members have had depression, and I can attest that the film's description is fundamentally accurate.  There are the euphoric highs, when the depressed feel falsely empowered to blow off authority figures (such as the 'boss', the career, the husband, the loving/caring family members, etc.)  The  mania is followed shortly by the 'lows' when the depressed become obsessed with death  -- and are sometimes rendered incapable of leaving their beds or even moving their limbs.  In one scene the depressed beauty, Kirsten Dunst, cannot raise her leg high enough to enter a warm bath that her loving sister has drawn.  In another scene Dunst, alone in the woods, literally baths naked in the light of the monster death planet that is fast approaching earth -- and her.

Yet the closer the death planet gets to earth, the calmer and more rational the depressed Dunst becomes.  Because she's been obsessing about death for months -- maybe years -- she's prepared and the only adult family member who is able to accept with some dignity the inevitability of death.

After reading several critics' reviews I was surprised that most missed the film's 'commanding heights' attention to clinical depression, preferring instead to focus on the 'end-of-the-world' dramatics.  For me the end of the world theme is a mere plot device that serves the overarching focus on depression.  (And what a plot device it is!)

To be sure the film has several minor flaws.  A few scenes strained credibility and therefore distracted.  For example, it is extremely unlikely that even a manic depressive bride would ravage a male intern in the middle of a well-lite mansion lawn where she's just taken her wedding vows.  And in two beautifully filmed scenes the gorgeous black horse that Dunst is riding balks and refuses to cross a small wooden bridge.  None of my film buff friends understood how either of these scenes connected to the film's plot or purpose.  Obviously, the Director decided they were important -- perhaps symbolic -- scenes, but we just didn't get it.  These are minor quibbles, however, and in no way did the flaws detract from the overall thrill of watching this film.

The full effect of the visuals and the music are best experienced in a theater -- the larger the better -- rather than via a small laptop/DVD screen.

Bottom line:  Despite very minor flaws, this film is a creative masterpiece that will certainly stand the test of time.  It may not be for everyone -- or even for the average movie goer -- but it is certainly an artistic gem -- visual eye candy.  What movie fan doesn't appreciate film makers who challenge themselves and us with original, creative treatments of serious, adult topics?",1329091200,4,4209,5.040520984081042
2950956,5,B000VSDNF0,"Most films about the apocalypse involve a group of characters, who are trying to run from the disaster at hand, wanting to fix everything, including saving the world. These movies usually include frantic violence and special effects, paper-thin characters, and not even a remote possibility of feeling sympathy for a character, because you know they will win in the end.

However, in Lars Von Trier's ""Melancholia"", none of this is really the case. From the opening sequence, you know essentially what is going to happen. However, I won't accuse this film of being predictable, because it uses absolutely no cliches that are so typical of the disaster film sub-genre. And plus, it has much more to fall back on.

The film centers around two sisters - Justine (Kirsten Dunst), and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Justine is getting married to Michael (Alexander Skarsgard), however Justine has been severely depressed for a very long time. She hasn't been able to cope with a lot of the changes in her life, and she doesn't know why. Claire has a young son, and she's always been the kind of person who looks after others, her sister, her child, and the rest of her family. When there is talk of a new planet called Melancholia, and the likelihood of it colliding with Earth, it forces Claire and Justine to look back on their lives, and ponder the decisions that they have made, and to find the meaning of their own lives before it becomes too late.

If you only need one reason to watch this film, it's Kirsten Dunst. I never quite saw Dunst as a serious actress. I had seen her in mostly comedies, however I thought she gave a wonderful performance in Sofia Coppola's re-imagination of ""Marie Antoinette"", however, I thought that maybe Dunst just got lucky that one time. This film proves that she can act, and she may even be Oscar worthy. Proving herself to be a character actress, her expressive eyes and face tell you so much about her character, even when she is saying nothing at all.

Charlotte Gainsbourg was apparently in a few of Triers' other films, yet this is the first thing I had seen her in. She's fabulous shining just as much as Dunst. The audience might relate or identify with her character more, making her, in a way, the heart of this picture. Her acting style is very poignant, quiet and thoughtful. I can't wait to see what she does next. Keifer Sutherland and Alex Skarsgard have minor roles here, and while they're very good, their characters could have been better-developed, and as thought out as the two female leads.

Lars Von Trier has made quite a few award-winning films. However, none that I can recall are as universal, approachable and ambitious as ""Melancholia"". As someone who attempted to watch ""Dogville"" and never quite got the hang of it, I can say that this is a massive improvement. First of all, ""Dogville"" had a running time about two minutes shy of three hours. It didn't have enough going for it. However, this one has everything going for it.

As the title suggests, a somber, and depressing mood is established early on in the film. However, it displays a lot of fine acting and cinematography, and the way that startling and beautiful images are put together with concertos from Wagner's ""Tristan und Isolde"" make for something beautiful, and uncompromisingly haunting. The theme, or message of this film is about togetherness, and family. However, there are so many metaphors scattered throughout this movie, that you might take something different away from it than I did.

Regardless, you won't forget about this film anytime soon. While the term ""art film"" has been thrown around to disposable and forgettable films, this is a true art film. The imagery and soundtrack, and the reputable lack of special effects, considering this is essentially a disaster film, are undeniably refreshing. While it is very depressing and devastating, it leaves an impression that is unlike anything you've experienced in film before. It's extremely and unrelentingly thought-provoking, and like the best art, it's open to interpretation.

2950957,1,B000VSDNF0,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

'Melancholia' is not only the name of the condition that afflicts Danish Director Lars Von Triers' protagonist, Justine, but it's also the name of the planet that has just come out from hiding behind the sun, and is on a collision course with earth. If you're anticipating watching another sci-fi thriller, this is not the film to go and see. Like this year's other entry in the indie pseudo sci-fi category, 'Another Earth', the focus is not on that annoying other planet up in the sky, but on the conflicts between the afflicted parties down on earth.

Von Triers divides 'Melancholia' into two parts that focus on two very different sisters, Justine and Claire. In Part I, Justine is a mid-level advertising copywriter, who arrives two hours late to her wedding with groom Michael, at brother-in-law John's estate. Just about everyone is speaking American English, so I assume the setting is supposed to be somewhere in the US, but it's not really clear. Justine is suffering from severe depression for unknown reasons and there are some suggestions that she may have psychic powers.

One explanation for Justine's blues is that she comes from a highly unpleasant family. Don't ask for any back story, you'll just have to be content to accept the fact that Von Triers' characters are inherently dysfunctional. There's a method to Von Triers' madness and I will attempt to shed some light on it by the end of this review. Suffice it to say at this juncture that in Von Triers' weltanschauung, all the so-called 'normal' people, are uncaring, and in some cases, plain 'evil', and the 'abnormal', those suffering from so-called mental illnesses, are actually quite sane.

Justine's relatives, friends and business associates are designed to offend our sensibilities as they all come across as self-centered and misanthropic. The worst offender is probably Justine's sarcastic, divorced mother, who tactlessly condemns the institution of marriage in a wedding toast, and expectorates numerous insults in front of the assembled guests, including the bride and groom. The father isn't much better, a card-carrying alcoholic who promises Justine, in the midst of her worst moment of decompensation, that he'll stay the night, but later leaves a note to his daughter, apologizing for leaving, due to a change of mind. There's also Justine's creepy boss, who attempts to humiliate one of his new employees in front of her, only to provoke an enraged Justine to send the boss to an early exit from the festivities. How does the new employee respond to Justine sticking up for him? He promptly has sex with her on the golf course. Passive schlub husband Michael, decides to leave Justine, with nary a protest. Lest I forget, brother-in-law John has no tolerance for the mother's bi-polar-like outbursts and at one point gathers up her luggage and dumps it outside the front entrance of the estate, until passive-aggressively reversing himself, and bringing the luggage back up to her room.

The second half of 'Melanchalia', Part 2, focuses on Justine's sister, Claire, who lives with John and their young son, Leo, at the estate. Claire is seemingly the most 'rational' and 'normal' of anyone who we've met so far, so when Von Triers transforms her into an abject coward, then we began to see what's going on here. It's no secret that Von Triers created 'Melancholia' as a result of his treatment for depression. When his therapist suggested that depressed people are more 'calm' in moments of crisis, that gave Von Triers license to affirm what he knew all along--that he, otherwise known as one of the ""depressed oppressed"", are better than all those nasties, he's been pitted against during his entire life. Of course one must accept Von Triers' supposition that all the antagonists we meet in 'Melancholia', are not caricatures, but multi-dimensional portraits, of living, breathing, human beings.

Evidence of Justine's 'triumph', can be found in Claire's reaction to her impending doom. As 'Melancholia' (the planet that is), is about to take the lives of everyone on earth, past nut-job Justine calmly pulls herself together and miraculously becomes the 'strong one'. When she finds John after he commits suicide, she calmly covers him with hay in the barn and doesn't freak out. She then builds a protective 'magic cave' for Leo, so he won't be afraid at all when earth completely implodes. Meanwhile, once 'normal' Claire, is frantically driving the family golf cart (the cars don't work because of earth's new found, screwed up, gravitational pull) with Leo into town, so she can get ""help"" (of course the implication is that she's 'lost it' because of course, how can you get 'help', when the earth is about to collide with another planet?).

One can view 'Melancholia' as a poor man's, reverse 'Persona', the classic 1966 film by Ingmar Bergman. Von Triers echoes Bergman's preoccupation with the differences between two women from different classes, different walks of life. In Persona, a lower class nurse, cares for an upper class, well known actress who suffers from mental illness. The 'simpler' nurse turns out to be more 'real' than the actress, who feigns mental illness to cover for her narcissism. Here, the seemingly afflicted Justine, proves to be much stronger than her sister, the wife of a millionaire, who, when faced with the fact that earth is about to be destroyed, is unable to muster the courage to face death, bravely.

If there's any saving grace in 'Melancholia', it's the iconic series of magisterial images in slow motion, mainly seen at the beginning of the film. Otherwise, the actors are hemmed in by the pretentious screenplay, which make them all seem like laughable caricatures. Von Triers' use of a bombastic Wagner score only adds to his reputation as a director with adolescent sensibilities, who doesn't even come close to approaching the sensibilities of the world's master filmmakers.",1328918400,17,5969,5.052791878172589
2950958,5,B000VSDNF0,I saw this movie about 6 weeks ago and I can't get it out of my head. The fact that I love the music must have a lot to do with it and I also can't get enough of end of the world films.,1328745600,5,185,3.227272727272727
2950959,5,B000VSDNF0,"This is one of the most mind-bending movies I have ever seen! This movie is absolutely not for everyone. You have to be ready to be taken into the world it creates, which is challenging. Or, you have to be open to a unique film like this.

I am not the most avid von Trier fan! So, I wasn't sure what to expect from the film, but I was anxious to see it. During the final moments of the film, I was literally holding my breath. The final image of the film is in the league of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" You will see why.

The ending itself isn't a surprise at all. von Trier makes sure you know that the world is going to end in the trance-like opening eight minutes. A series of dream-like images unfolds, leading to the final shot of the sequence: Earth smashing head-on into a planet 10 times its size. So, as the film goes forward, you know what lies ahead.

The film is in two parts. The first shows a wedding reception that spirals into disaster. Two sisters, Justine and Claire, are the focus. Justine is the melancholic bride, who sinks into depression during the reception. Claire is left to try to keep her from completely losing it. The second half sees the next morning when everyone has left, except for Justine and Claire with her husband and son. The planet Melancholia has come into view, and is now on a track towards Earth. It's supposed to only pass close by, but will it? And how will the people in the film react?

We, of course, already know the answer, and that is the key. This film is all about how the characters deal with impending, absolutely certain doom. Each of the four characters react in unique ways, and that's what makes the film so fascinating. Every end-of-the-world movie is about crazy visual effects and melodrama. The key here is that there are no TV reports or anything. Just four people on this otherwise empty estate.

There is a lot of von Trier's ""in the moment"" cinema verite shooting style in the opening half. But, it calms down in the second half. And, there are moments of absolutely gorgeous cinematography in the opening and during the second half. This film is so completely mesmerizing and unique, I would say it is certainly worth two-plus hours of your time!",1328659200,5,2214,4.45679012345679
2950960,4,B000VSDNF0,"Imagine capturing the immediacy of a wedding knowing or not knowing something catastrophic may or may not occur. The audience and the characters are in the same position in Melancholia.

Now imagine you are very rich and having that same wedding in your own mansion with expansive well manicured grounds. Horses in the modern stables. Two or three 4x4s and a butler plus assorted servants to help with the reception. Are the proceedings normal or are they normal plus?

Undercurrents do eventually surface. The two sisters who centre the story are a clash of types. The creative and the stoic. The father is a s...bag. You may disagree. This is a live action story with the drama both extreme AND non-existent. Isn't that how middle-class problems are dealt with? Some other place, not in conversation and never admitted.

Looming doom. I love the magic cave, that would be me. But then I don't drink wine. I savour a film of humans sane. Civility is an art form. Green.",1328572800,4,970,4.761904761904762
2950961,1,B000VSDNF0,"I'll preface my negative review of the movie with this:
- Great acting by Dunst. She perfectly plays an abhorrent character.
- Some really cool visuals and cinematography

Half the movie involves a wedding and how Dunst is too emo and artsy to deal with her family or her spineless new husband. The second half involves panicky characters trying to cope with the potential of the world coming to an end. The movie is disturbingly slow and the characters are such terrible, terrible people. This movie was made by someone with no understanding of physics (if a planet comes anywhere near our planet, especially if that planet is larger, the rise in tides would cause tsunamis that would wipe us all out way before such a planet could hit us); it is a truly artistic endeavor.

I'm actually offended that I was made to believe this would be an ""incredible"" and ""beautiful"" film. I struggled through everything beyond the first 5 minutes.",1327968000,8,935,4.765432098765432
2950962,3,B000VSDNF0,"This is definitely a plus on recent films from von Triers...my favourite since 'Waves'. The camera work and cinematography is often exquisite and the performances are first class. The story is relatively straight forward and the script often clunky. There are dutiful homages to Tarkovsky, the slo-mo horse shots, the doom and gloom recalling Tarkovsky's Sacrifice, the use of Breughel's painting(Solaris), to mention a few. But there's none of the pompousness Malick recently displayed with, ""Tree of Life"". Solid outing.",1327881600,3,522,5.5375
2950963,3,B000VSDNF0,"Inspired in part by Director, Lars von Trier's own battle with depression, Melancholia as part sci-fi , part visual masterpiece and part social drama, challenges the audience to accept an uneven mix of sublime visual imagery and commercially tainted, routine dramatic storytelling.  Ultimately, Melancholia is a sadly frustrating film of three stanzas!

von Trier's opening stanza is a wonderfully mysterious canvas of visual beauty which entrances and affects. With ethereal floating imagery and lush colors, its enigmatic nature captures the imagination.  In typical von Trier style to not follow normal filming conventions, the opening stanza reveals the film's denouement.

The second stanza, captured using von Trier's customary hand-held filming technique (an essential element in his Dogme 95 manifesto), is long, and dare I say it, predictable, pudgy and boring.  Lacking the stunning visual impact of its bookend set pieces  it plays out like a  turgid TV soap opera; offering a by the numbers drama of a dysfunctional and conflicted family.  Occupying more than 90% of the film, the largely prosaic plot of the second stanza completely unbalances and devalues what had the potential to be a cinematic tour-de-force.

von Trier returns to form in the short concluding stanza as sisters Justine and Claire, having realised their promised salvation was false, wait with Claire's young son Leo, as the menacing rogue planet which has controlled their recent lives, looms larger and larger in the sky, until it chillingly occasions their death and the end of the world, enveloping them and the audience in a hauntingly evocative, visually stunning, and unforgettable finale.",1327795200,3,1679,5.426923076923077
2950964,5,B000VSDNF0,"Melancholia totally absorbed me. It had me from the first moment to well after the credits rolled. Every frame was sumptuous and beautiful. Loved the music throughout. The 10 seconds or so of black nothingness at the end.

Amazing contrasts - a wedding and the possible end of the world, depression and beauty. Kirsten Dunst was amazing. Great colorful characters in her folks, boss, brother-in-law Kiefer S, and the dysfunction between them all. Interesting how the entire thing takes place at this castle/estate, which becomes increasingly cut off from the rest of the world, with fewer and fewer characters as the movie goes on.

It seems that every detail in this film was well thought out and quite intentional. I'm sure I'll get more out of it on the second viewing.

You'll see lots of 5-star reviews here but also many 1- or 2-star reviews.  I respect the opinions of people who did not like this film.  It is not for everyone.  It's a film about depression and about the possible end of the world, so many will see this film as a total downer (though, strangely, I felt pretty good after it was over - watching it was cathartic and visceral for me).

Also, the story moves very slowly.  The film is as much about mood and visuals as about plot, and maybe more so.  I really couldn't blame anyone who dislikes films that are so slow.

Yet, there are many folks out there who appreciate a film like this, who will be completely absorbed and blown away by Melancholia.  If you're this kind of viewer, I can't recommend it strongly enough.  Watching it is a very deep, emotional experience.",1327449600,11,1595,4.637010676156583

Acting is superb and the story is multi-layered.  If you are going just for a science fiction disaster film you are in for a treat...if you can be flexible.  If you can appreciate the humor in dysfunctional families and dysfunctional family events you get still another treat.  The wedding will make any quirks in your family seem mild by comparison.  The approach of the big beautiful blue planet is what you are waiting for and it does not disappoint either....but you have to be patient.  On top of all that, the settings are gorgeous....from the lavish estate and wedding to the surrounding countryside in a country you never quite identify...but it could be one of many in the Western world.  No cost was spared to bring you into another world with respect to the filming.  I am just sorry there was not an appropriate marketing campaign to let the world know about this one.  We stumbled across it one evening with nothing better to do and decided to watch it as one more grade B disaster film.  Boy were we surprised! This film deserves to be in the ""hall of Fame"" of great films but alas...not many know about it.  For starters, this film leaves Black Swan in the dust from both an acting and a story line perspective.

I'd go along with that. she's always been a good actress. really good choice of roles/characters, even small stuff like eternal sunshine (love that movie also). and here this character is so deep and so sad and depressing, with a bad actress, or even mediocre, it would've ruined it completely. but she's terrific. never looked better either. the whole cast I'm sure must feel very proud of themselves. in terms of filmmaking as an art movies like this are in a league of their own",1327104000,5,1882,4.688821752265861
2950987,5,B000VSDNF0,"Melancholia is -in last instance- a deep reflection about the meaning of life and our role in this world. If Tarkovsky's Sacrifice deals with a similar issue, Von Triers employs Wagner's Prelude and Liebestod as dramatic device, to keep in suspense the narative thread and so, to maintain suspense and so weave together like the pieces of this enigmatic and apocalyptic portrait of human misery that are openly or implicitly in all households.

It's a film that speaks of redemption, the fatuous delusion of a beautiful woman incapable of self-realization, let alone give a word of encouragement optimistic even in the day of her wedding, due to acute existential conflict dragged on its very childhood.

A film hard to watch due its multiple complexities. In case this is your first encounter with Von Triers, I really would recommend you to watch Epidermic in order to understand certain aesthetics codes he tends to use in his films.

Dunst is the real surprise. She achieved an enormous expressive performance as well as Charlotte Geinsbourg.

Ignore them.  Don't argue.  Reach out to the others who saw what you saw, and share your awe and excitement.  Nietzsche said ""Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster.""

This is a visually stunning movie.  It will make you feel things and see things.  I have to compare it somewhat to being high on something.....  it puts you in a dream world.

Stunning achievements in all areas, as well as Kirsten Dunst's acting.  She might get an Oscar for this.  Who knew....?

Melancholia is similar to The Tree of Life with Brad Pitt, and even to Another Earth.....though Melancholia is leaps ahead of them.  I would rank them Melancholia #1,  The Tree of Life #2, and Another Earth #3.

But do see all of them!!!!

I think Melancholia will become a cult film that is brought back yearly to the artsy theatres in  some towns.  I want to see it again, but need to let time pass so I can feel the ""awe"" of it again.

All the characters were incredibly difficult to relate to and they all seemed to have mental issues which made them even more difficult to like.

Let's go back to the film's beginning, and what is called ""Justine: Part I.""  Justine (played by Kirsten Dunst who's lovelier than I've ever seen her before) has just married and is at the wedding reception.  All of Part I (which is longer than Part II) is in or around this reception.  Somehow Justine has snared a man who clearly had little idea he was marrying someone who sorely needs to be hospitalized for the blackest melancholy, or some other mental disorder.  She repeatedly absents herself, disgraces her newly wed husband, makes love to her boss's nephew on the front lawn, and in general carries on to the point of needing a good slapping or a good medication.

Her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is a paragon of patience and good hosting, trying as she does to keep Justine from flying apart.  Unfortunately for me, Part I had a lot of murmured dialogue I couldn't catch, and since the second part was easily audible I blame the movie.  The director might be trying to imitate real life, but he's got to realize that he's filming for an audience, not for the actors in front of the camera.  Claire's husband John (Kieffer Sutherland) is the poor soul who also has to put up with his sister-in-law's irritating behavior while complaining constantly about the cost of the wedding and reception.  He has a secret, but is the person the audience could most identify with.

The second part is titled ""Claire,"" and in fact revolves around her and her struggle to keep a stiff upper lip concerning her sister, and especially her son.  The wandering planet officially named Melancholia comes into its own now, a beautiful, ominous orb in the sky that gets bigger and bigger.  John sloughs off concern; the scientists have it all figured out he tells Claire, and they say it will miss the earth.  He's still buying emergency supplies on the sly, though.

Justine seems to be rejuvenated by the new planet, at one point melancholia-bathing naked in its greenish-blue reflected light.  It's Claire's turn now to suffer from melancholia, this time from a planet that seems to spell doom for the earth--indeed for all living things in the universe, according to Justine.  As the planet nears, she claims to ""know things,"" one of which is that life on earth is alone, all alone.  When it goes, life itself goes.  That kind of deep gloom sets the final stage, in which a strangely vibrant Justine still manages to be a royal pain in Claire's neck.

Is this the despair that the deeply melancholy feel?  Are there two types of melancholy, a personal inborn one for some people and one that can be forced on otherwise perfectly healthy folks through exterior circumstance?  The movie is beautifully shot with rich color and eye-catching shapes.  It's somewhat claustrophobic since there's nowhere to hide, and Claire's anguish is searing.  A remarkable, if not great movie.",1325721600,8,3087,4.810246679316888
2950993,3,B000VSDNF0,"Danish filmmaker Lars Von Trier crafts movies somewhat reflective of his own character, and experiences. In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Antichrist/dp/B005900DQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Antichrist</a>, a psychiatrist, and his wife, take a vacation, in the woods, and he has concerns that his wife's psychotherapy is not working, while both contend with an unthinkable loss. Lars struggles with depression have been well documented, as have his awkward comments about Nazism at the Cannes Film Festival, which have become a youtube phenomenon. Melancholia was crafted from a depressed state.

It's not difficult to see how personal experience emerges as art, in Melancholia, with depression being represented through a feminine lens mostly through the character Justine, played by Kirsten Dunst. The movie opens with a stunning five minute visual sequence with no dialogue, and a Wagnerian music soundtrack. As this happened, immediately I began to compare it to Tree of Life, although it's the antithetical, instead of creation, birth, and optimism we have a mood piece with destructive overtones.

As the movie begins we see snippets of a story unfolding in slow motion, snippets which will be developed later in the story, a woman in a wedding dress, a pretty face leeched of all energy, a horse unable to stand sinking in mud, and two planets about to collide.

When the movie proper begins we see a bride happy on her wedding day, at a castle in the country, with a 19 hole golf course.

As the evening dwindles down, her happy countenance diffuses, with self serving bitter cynical comments by her mother, played by Charlotte Rampling, directed at marriage. As someone prone to depression, she becomes assailed by lethargy and melancholy. Her sister, Claire played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, comforts her. As the facade begins to fall apart, she has sex with a random stranger, and a destructive confrontation with her boss, also the best man. Next morning her husband leaves her, and she has a breakdown. She remains at the castle owned by her sister, and her brother in law played by Kiefer Sutherland.

Meanwhile, a previously unknown planet Melancholia has emerged from the sun, and heads towards earth. We don't know if it will collide, and end the world or pass by. As it gets closer, its oppressive energy effects everyone, and both Claire and husband exhibit anxiety and depression, while Justine strangely becomes calmer. A mysterious scene has Claire searching a locked drawer looking for antidepressants. To whom do they belong? She, her husband or Justine?

If depression is the anticipation of loss then depressed people may be less troubled by a disastrous future, because they already anticipate loss. The prospect of the end of the world may very well be an antidepressant, as it proposes the alleviation of suffering.

The good points of this movie were its visuals, particularly the acting of Kirsten Dunst, who perfectly and convincingly plays the role of a depressed woman. She acknowldeges she would not have produced this performance without Von Trier. She won the Best Actress award at Cannes in 2011. Coupled with Charlotte Gainsbourg's performance, we have two great performances. Charlotte Gainsbourg previously won Best Actress at Cannes for her performance in Antichrist. One point of interest was the parallelsim of how horses who know nothing of the news finds themselves lacking energy, and how the proximity of Melanchol(y)a effects other peoples energy. Carl Jung said 'perception is projection.'

As someone with personal experience of the subject, I can say Von Trier represents depression effectively, and Dunst represents it accurately.

I have mixed feelings about the movie. I think it will get a mixed reaction from people. Some people will love it, and some people will hate it. If you did not like Tree of Life, you probably will not like this movie. If you did like The Tree of Life as I did you still may not like this movie. By the way&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tree-of-Life-Three-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-Digital-Copy/dp/B005HV6Y5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tree of Life (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)</a>&nbsp;won for best movie at Cannes in 2011.

Its slow pace while artistic is not necessarily engrossing. Something of the mood of the characters was conveyed to me while watching, and I had the parallel experience of feeling drained of energy at the time, although now I am glad I saw it.

I definitely recommend getting it as a rental before you buy, and watch Tree of Life first. I hope this was helpful.",1325635200,5,4680,5.388508891928865
2950994,2,B000VSDNF0,"I hav never liked the films of Lars von Trier and 'Melancholia is no exception. Beautifully photographed and supported by a very good cast, Melancholia is an exercise in severe depression. Consider the dictionary definition of the word: 'Melancholia - a mental condition and especially a manic-depressive condition characterized by extreme depression, bodily complaints, and often hallucinations and delusions'.

The film is divided into two parts; 'Justine' and 'Claire'. 'Justine' focuses on Justine's wedding, a depressive surrounded by her also depression ridden family and friends. 'Claire' focuses on Justine's sister, also a depressive who ruminates while a planet appropriately named 'Melancholia' approaches on a collision course with planet Earth. Real or delusion? The viewer cannot say. What can be said is that the film acts out the inner turmoil of depression and ends with the inevitable end of all things.

Slow and plodding the film displays very well the inner turmoil of depression. Unfortunately, the film can be depressing within itself. If you weren't depressed before seeing this movie, you might be afterwards. Have your suicide pills ready because after seeing this movie, you might want to end it all.",1325289600,6,1227,5.4526315789473685
2951005,5,B000VSDNF0,"It's probably accurate to say that MELANCHOLIA is a ""love it or hate it"" movie, and if the Amazon customer reviews are any indication, that's almost certainly the case.  Is there a middle ground?  Well, before I found myself assigning it five stars, I thought maybe *I* was at precisely that place.  I liked much of it, while watching it, but did kind of succumb to its longueurs at various places.  I also couldn't HEAR much of the dialogue, which doesn't seem like such a problem at most movies, so I doubt I have a hearing issue (at least I hope not--with my luck I'd just get a decent hearing aid and then some rogue planet would come crashing into the Earth and making it all for naught anyway).

I'm enough of a literalist that I can't sit through a movie that casts a (very) American actress (Kirsten Dunst)and (veddy) Franco-British one (Charlotte Gainsbourg) as sisters and not grumble at least a bit thatWh no one's even BOTHERING to attempt to match accents (let alone their  and overall demeanor).  We see that they have a British mother (Charlotte Rampling--Yay!)and a dad who seems so out of it, it's hard to tell (but the actor--John Hurt--is, of course, British).  I can't imagine that ALL English speakers sound alike to Danish director, Lars von Trier.  No, he knew what a mismatch this was, and he DIDN'T care.  And why should he/we? Not if the world is coming to an end.

Which, ultimately of course, makes ALL the difference.  People who accuse von Trier of meandering are not totally off base, but they are missing a basic point, I think.  We've all seen at least some of those end-of-the-world movies and have witnessed the hysteria that attends anticipated annihilation.  MELANCHOLIA has a different mood, and it is--you guessed it--a melancholy one.  Melancholia is the name of the ""blue planet"" hurtling toward Earth.  It is also the overriding mental state of the film's main character, Justine (Dunst), who seems to be picking up on the destructive vibe well before anyone else is even aware of the impending crisis.

Is she supernaturally sensitive to the cosmic vibe, or has she always been in a precarious mental state anyway?  Her parents are total screw ups, and her relationship with her wealthy sister and brother-in-law seems rather fragmented and would seem to have a long history of major and minor conflicts.  If she's in a bad way, well, she has her reasons.

Unlike the typical All-American, big budget disaster film, MELANCHOLIA is relatively low-key, and all the more ominous for it. If it's a technically a ""disaster film,"" it's the most poetic, most haunting one since, at least, THE LAST WAVE. In Part I, we see that a few of the characters notice something strange in the night sky,  but it's explained away by someone who seems authoritative enough.  The rest of the first part is devoted to the disastrous wedding reception,  a debacle so understandable in human terms that we only later realize that this time out, the fault may indeed lay as much in the stars as in ourselves.

Weddings, new beginnings, none of that can matter much now.  It is only in Part II that we learn that despite some optimistic predictions that the rogue planet (which has been hiding behind the sun lo these many millennia) may only be a ""fly by"" (like it was w/ Mercury and Venus, we're told).  But we know better, the prologue told us as much.

Lucky for us, we don't have to contend with the panic scenes in urban centers or suburban tracts.  In the final scenes, we observe only the two sisters, Justine and Claire, and Claire's young son, isolated on the latter's rural estate.  No marauding hoards have descended, but what of it?  Total destruction faces them--and everyone--no matter what.  Still, we see a different kind of doomsday scenario.  The world ends with a bang AND a whimper.

Released in 2011,  MELANCHOLIA may well be the perfect film to usher in 2012's ""count down.""  But even if that's not your eschatalogical beat or bent, you may find yourself thinking about this film for days or weeks after seeing it.  It's haunting in the way that TREE OF LIFE is haunting.  Not for everyone, of course, but for those whose tastes in cinema lean toward the darkly poetic (and you know who you are), '11 has proven to be something of a banner year.",1325116800,6,4286,4.681818181818182

2951007,2,B000VSDNF0,"When Bores Collide more like it. This coma inducing, navel gazing cinematic torture session has only a strong cast to save it from being a total travesty.

Kirsten Dunst is fantastic as the deranged bride at the end of the world. Charlotte Gainsbourg also registers strongly as her sister. John Hurt turns up looking like an alcoholic  Baron Munchausen, Charlotte Rampling is the harridan from Hell mother of the bride (makes you pine for Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS) and von Trier perennial Udo Kier provides a comic relief of sorts.

Von Trier seems to be getting worse as a filmmaker and his usual nihilistic attitudes abound. Women are usually whores, loonies or nutbusters (or a combination there of) and the men are aggressive abusers or doormats.

Apparently making movies helps von Trier deal with his depression, this seems like a very elaborate and expensive way of doing it.

And it's the audience who really suffers here.

2951008,4,B000VSDNF0,"Melancholia is a viscerally brilliant, and deftly plotted character study. It's more symbolic than it is thematic. Before watching, I was unaware of the director's diffculties with depression and it's influence on the movie. But being intimate with the disease's manifestation, I got the symbolism and found it to be particularly clever and poignant. It's important to dig deeper and not take the hatefulness of the main character at face value. If the end of humanity is imminent and inevitable, and we are fully aware of it, is it wrong or selfish to simply behave within our capacity?

There are two parts to this movie. The first part -- a wedding reception featuring the underlying dysfunction of a wealthy family. The bride Justine, (played well by Kirsten Dunst) seemingly happy and in love, quickly becomes aloof, selfish and self-destructive. Meanwhile the witless groom, her sister and ""filthy rich"" brother-in-law try in vain (through threats, reasoning,  guilt trips and kind gestures of last resort) to get the bride to stick to a storybook script -- or maybe just act like a decent human being. (Think Kardashian wedding. Art imitating life--the bride is playing a part; and even though he should know better, the groom dups himself into believing  it's real, not made-up ""reality"".)

The event becomes a failed exercise at damage control. The faade unravels, as everyone kind of expected it to, just hopped it wouldn't. The wedding is an obvious sham, but you are not sure why at first, just that Justine ultimately does not play along and this brands her as a self-absorbed, ungrateful brat.  But there are hints that Justine has depression -- aka melancholia -- that should not be overlooked by the audience. It becomes clear that she's being forced to ""just be happy"" to make others happy.  She tried, she really did. There are also hints that she has some sort of creative brilliance that her boss inappropriately exploits, even during the wedding reception, and she's fed up. (Also worth noting if you want to look back and try to understand the point of the film.)

In part 2 she's spiraled into major depression and is near catatonic. Now completely hopeless to care for herself, her sister and brother-in-law take her in. Melancholia is now a planet that has emerged from behind the sun and is headed towards a collision with Earth. As the planet  Melancholia gets closer to Earth, Justine's heavy depression gets lighter.  She's caught reveling in its glow. Denial and panic set in for everyone except Justine. It seems she thinks of herself as clairvoyant, or she could at least be idiot savant-like smart. She attempts to convince her sister of this. ""I know things"" she says, and she knows the world is about to end and there is nothing anyone can do about it.

Justine is not crazy - just extremely depressed. And it seems that she's not treating the depression - she's just lets it be, and those around her unknowingly enable it. But perhaps it serves her well in that she sustains a disturbingly steady sense of calm and resolve on the brink of the end of humanity.

Critics say that Justine is too awful of a person - unlikeable and cruel.  But true clinical depression steals away compassion and diplomacy. Justine was enabled, not helped, so there was no hope of her acting any other way. And if she truly ""knows things"" then perhaps happy pretenses were not worth the effort if the world was ending soon anyway.

Melancholia as a planet and a condition is symbolic - we can hope it will us pass by, but it will only end up destroying us.  The sister relies on the husband to reassure her they'll live, the planet will simply pass by, based on whatever scientific evidence he's gathered and selectively deems relevant. He wants her to stay off the internet to avoid panicking, but the lack of TV or CNN, as the world enters its last days, was telling. If she wanted the truth, she could have gotten it. The family was too insular, isolated from reality, more comfortable in denial, cowardly. But is there a ""right way"" to deal with the end of the world?

2951010,4,B000VSDNF0,"This film haunts me. At the end of the first veiwing,I couldn't get it out of my head. Whatever flaws it has are made up for by some of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen on film.

The reason it is 4 stars and not 5 is simple-I hate the stupid hand held ""shaky cam"" crap-it is horrible film-making. In fact,I will not watch a movie that is filmed that way. I consider it junk film making. The main issue with it is that it takes me out of the film. Is the first half of the film,the Wedding scene,really too long? Or is it just the stupid shaky cam taking me out of the film over and over? I can be captivated by a character,and then the camera jerks around and I am out of the moment. I really hate it-just say no young film-makers,just say no. Use real movie making skills please.

So if I hate the shaky cam so much,why did I sit through this? Because the first 8 and a half minutes may be the most amazing opening I have ever seen on film. It is stunning,and just left me with my jaw on the ground. By the time the shaky cam started,I had to watch no matter what.

The first half may drag,but it sets up the second half. As Justine shuts down and Clair cares for her all seems in order(if a bit nuts)but then it all shifts. And there are moments that leave you breathless. When Clair is outside looking at the planet at night,she sees Justine walking out after being almost comatose during this part of the film. As Clair follows her,you expect something awful to be waiting for you. But when what Clair is seeing is revealed,it may be the most beautiful frame of film I have ever seen. Justine naked by the stream,bathing in the light of Melancholia-I have never seen a woman shown in such deep beauty.

As the end comes,as Justine becomes clearer even as Clair falls apart,there are moments. When Justine says ""Earth is evil-there's no need to greive for it"" it left me moved. When she says ""We are alone"",I felt it. And when the end comes,the power of it just won't go away.

Kirsten Dunst puts on the finest acting performance of the year-there is no other competition. And this movie just won't get out of my head.

It is likely that you either really liked those movies, or that you very much disliked them. Now comes his latest movie, about the possible impending end of earth, and how it affects a small group of people.

""Melancholia"" (130 min.) starts with a 10 min. introduction, in extreme slow-motion, of what the end will look like, when a rogue planet collides with earth. The music that plays along with it is from Richard Wagner, and those introductory minutes reminded me of Stanley Kubrick. After the introduction, the movie plays in two parts, focusing on two women, Justine (played magnificantly by Kirsten Durst) and Claire (played by Charlotte Gainsbourg). It took me a while after the amazing 10 min. introduction to get into the movie, as I think the wedding reception takes too long to play out, but once we get past that, we are in for a treat, as we watch how the main characters deal with/prepare for a ""fly-by"" or possible collision with the rogue planet Melancholia.

In my opinion Kirsten Dunst gives by far her best performance yet, but certainly Charlotte Gainsbourg and Kiefer Sutherland (playing the role of Claire's husband) are equally in great form. In all, ""Melancholia"" is a great movie.

It is like entering a Maxfield Parrish painting while having Wagner perform live in the background and the neo-classical leitmotif is used throughout the picture.

The visual artistry of the film is breathtaking.  Every single frame is beautiful neo-classical art.  The scene with Justine (Dunst) illuminated by blue light from a blue planet -- Parrish blue bathed Justine on the bank of a river -- is the most exquisite frame in the film.  There was an element of improvisation on behalf of the actors courtesy of Lars von Trier (director) and this allowed a more realistic portrayal of characters.  This was pure genius also.

The soundtrack which was primarily from Robert Wagner's Wagner: Tristan und Isolde which is so powerful and dramatic in it's own right, adds to the mood of this movie. Shaky camera, particularly in the beginning: annoying, but adds to the mood. Deep bass, thundering sounds and music soundtrack: powerful and effective. Although some reviewers complained it was slow, for me it seemed a lot shorter than it's actual time of 2 hours and 16 minutes. It's definitely a deep ""artsy"" type of movie, so if you don't like that sort of thing you probably won't like this movie. In the first 6 or 7 minute preview, that moves in slow motion, you get a synopsis of the whole film. You know what's going to happen before the actual story begins.

The rest of the movie plays out in two parts. The first part, ""Justine"", who is played by Kirsten Dunst, shows the bride and her new husband played by Alexander Skarsgard, on their way to their lavish wedding reception at the home of her sister, Clair, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg and brother-in-law, played by Kiefer Sutherland. Justine seems to be in a state of very deep depression, which we know is because of the impending crash of the planet Melancholia into Earth. What should be a happy affair begins to deteriorate right away, from the ride there in a stretch limo which has problems navigating the winding road to her sister and brother-in-law's mansion. By the end of the night she's destroyed her marriage and her state of mind has deteriorated even further.

The second part ""Clair"" shows her sister, who after trying to help Justine to get herself together, begins to fall into a depression of her own. The planet is getting closer and everyone seems more aware. Interestingly, no one is glued to the TV, watching the 24 hours news stations. Her husband, John (Kiefer Sutherland) is an amateur astronomer and is convinced that Melancholia is going to bypass the Earth, but come close enough for a splendid view. He is the optimist in this story. As we watch Clair become more fearful and depressed, Justine seems to accept their fate and becomes more calm and reassures her young nephew, Leo, Clair and John's son.

The movie is heavy with symbolism. Several people have commented on the scene where Justine and her new husband are trying to get the stretch limo up the winding road to their reception. I wonder if the read symbolizes life and it's twists and turns and the limo, people using wealth in an attempt to navigate it and finding that it can cause more problems than expected. In another scene the sticks representing a cave seemed more than a little strange. Perhaps that tries to show that there is no way to escape death and something as seemingly safe as a cave is no more so than a bunch of sticks? I guess the whole movie seems to show how different personalities deal with the inevitable and how they are able to live knowing that it will end.",1322352000,,3050,4.740112994350283

2951085,4,B000VSDNF0,"Taxes got you down?  Cat tearing up your couch again?  It could be worse---earth could collide with a planet!  It's a simple message, but one that ultimately works as a movie concept, in the end, for this reviewer.

No question, this movie can try the patience of even the most diehard cinema fans.  ""Melancholia"" is not a movie for the masses; no explosions or transforming robots. The varying responses of reviewers just goes to prove von Trier's point: people have different personalities and will react differently to all situations.  Those of the ""melancholic"" personality will probably enjoy this film.  It is somewhat slow and depressing, but it's a great way to understand HOW people view the same event through a different ""lens.""  It's a perceptive way to experience what a melancholic-type person sees by stepping inside their mind.

Also, it's money worth spending to see on a big screen, and---more significantly---hearing it in big, surround-theater sound.  I think the first and last 15 minutes will mesmerize any viewer.  I often asked myself after leaving the film: ""Could these two 15-minute segments be attached to show a brief, 30-minute movie that would please viewers?  I decided: no.

The middle section is sometimes slow and painfully fixated laser-beam like on the expressions of individual faces throughout the wedding scene.  Yet, this drawn out pace will reward faithful viewers if they endure for the entire 130 minutes.

In ""Part II,"" the main storyline (the demise of the earth by an interplanetary collision) picks up.  The suspense that von Trier creates is extraordinary.  The setting is sparse and simple; the characters few.  Yet, I really wanted to know how the main characters would respond when the inevitable end finally greets them.

I don't think the visceral impact of this film would be quite the same if watched on my small, desktop computer.  I haven't seen it through Amazon's ""instant video"" system, but I recommend that if you have even the slightest interest/curiosity from what you've heard, go see it on the big screen.  The ending is bold and quite beautiful.  It still leaves me breathless. . . .",1322265600,5,2150,5.0141242937853105
2951086,5,B000VSDNF0,"Lars von Trier, controversial and oft-times enigmatic, is one of the greatest film makers ever. You may not like his films, or even understand them, but they stay in the memory, and Melancholia is no exception. Structured into two parts, it is a story of two sisters, Justine and Claire, played by Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg respectively.
Part 1. concerns Justine at her wedding party, a hugely expensive and elaborately planned affair, detailed down to the precise minute....the entire affair is unraveled by night's end as von Trier brilliantly peels off layer by layer of emotional issues, leaving the externally controlled Justine willingly withdrawn from her preplanned life. Obsessed with the star Antares and it's eventual disappearance, she progressively rejects every facet of her life, of which she is mortally afraid.
Part 2. concerns Claire, the main controller in Part 1, and her increasing fear of death as the planet Melancholia approaches the earth.
Together, the two parts form a gorgeously filmed juxtaposition of fears and obsessions with plenty of symbolism scattered throughout. A memorable example is Claire searching in terror for Justine at night, only to find her nude on a river bank, illuminated in a blueish light from Melancholia, longing erotically for death. Objects are also juxtaposed, such as the bottle of beans in Part 1 and the ""Magic Cave"" in Part 2.
Overall, this is a great psychological and meditative film that, like von Trier's films usually are, never give answers, but do compel you to pause and reflect.",1322265600,7,1561,5.173913043478261
2951087,4,B000VSDNF0,"Lars von Trier's new film, ""Melancholia"" explores depression and its consequences -- loneliness, alienation, fear -- on a personal level inside the heart and also on a cosmic level. The movie was featured at the 2011 Cannes film festival where the leading actress, Kirsten Dunst, (Justine) received the best actress award. During the festival, von Trier made some highly inflammatory comments and was banned from further appearances at the event. ""Melancholia"" was my first von Trier film.

The movie is lengthy and divided into two sections, each of which is devoted to one of the two sisters, Justine and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) who are the main characters. The story is set against the backdrop of what appears to be an impending collision between the earth and a newly discovered planet aptly called Melancholia. Astronomers see the danger (Remember, most scientists now believe that many millions of years ago, an asteroid collided with the earth killing the dinosaurs and other large forms of life.) but they believe, mistakenly, that the two planets will eventually just pass each other by.  In the movie, the protagonists play out their own lives and their own melancholia against what, as becomes increasingly apparent, will be a cataclysmic catastrophe.

In the first part of the movie, Justine is to be married to a handsome, propserous young man, Michael, (Alexander Skarsgard).  The wedding festivities, sponsored by Claire's husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) are lavish and expensive and take place in a decadent old castle. John is not a professional astronomer but has a strong interest and apparently considerable education in the subject. He tends to discount the fears of some scientists that the earth and Melancholia will colide. The wedding festival is set aginst a tone of personal foreboding as well as Justine's long separated parents quarrel and make a scene, and Justine's boss interjects business into the celebration. But the main problem is Justine. She does not love John and she does not understand herself. Justine has relations with someone else during the celebration and her husband-to-be leaves her.

The second part of the movie focuses on Claire, and on her relationship with Justine, with her husband John, and with their young son, Leo. As the movie progresses, Justine becomes more able to deal with her depression while Claire's conditions, initially the stronger of the two, becomes worse. The changing position of the sisters is juxtaposed against the approach of Melancholia which becomes increasingly prominent and certain as the movie progresses. When it becomes apparent to all that doom will occur, John kills himself while Justine, although taking a nihilistic cynical approach to life and its end on earth, provides a measure of strength and comfort to Leo. She behaves strongly and with dignity during what she believes will be the end of life in the universe and on earth.

The acting in the film is excellent throughout and tension is developed through even with some slow moments. The movie has the feel of lush, indulgent 19th Century Romanticism with Wagner's music featured throughout.  The photography and special effacts add a great deal to the movie as the approach of Melancholia to the earth is captured erily, both in the sky and in the reactions of animals on earth. A sense of vertigo is introduced in the last portion of the movie with the camera work which offers a sense of the impending collision.  The final apocalyptic scene is convincingly portrayed.

""Melancholia"" is a subtle worthwhile movie with its themes of loss, sadness, and loneliness on both a cosmic scale and a personal scale.

2951088,4,B000VSDNF0,"I love it when a movie doesn't spoon feed you perfect logic. I like to be slightly challenged with various situations that are open to interpretations. ( insert Tree of Life movie as #1 ) I can see why this movie has a ""love it or hate it"" response. I am torn with loving the visuals and the way it creates so many questions. But with that, I also hate that I have... SO MANY QUESTIONS with the events and characters. (not being able to cross the bridge? What was that all about?) Dunst's did an amazing job of acting ( insert Droopy Dog 'I'm Happy'. ) Her character's evolution of gloom, sadness and depraved depression was both disturbing and yet mesmerizing.

You will be flooded with symbolism, beautiful and romantic sadness and a buffet of character responses to different situations with a shaky camera. This movie had some fantastic moments, almost genius... brilliant and astonishing. There are lessons here to be learned in the layers of situations. How we as humans manipulate and have expectations of each other and how we react when those expectations aren't met. We realize that people are only and I mean ONLY being nice to you because they want something from you. ( that's right, honey badger don't give a #$@&! ). But seriously, what was the symbolism of the horse or the golf cart not crossing the bridge? Was there something symbolic of the limo being stuck on the curved road? Was the marriage a symbolism of failed unity and then the planets hitting one another a symbolism of destructive unity? What on earth was the mother wearing to the reception, a tie-dyed dress? How do a bunch of tree branches equate a magic cave? Why did one sister have an English accent and the other didn't? See, LOTS of questions. The song ""When Worlds Collide"" comes to mind. If you like simple movies that spoon feed you, you'll hate this film. This is a psychological roller coaster ride with some awesome visuals. I feel/think it is worth renting with some intellectual friends to chat about after viewing. Also, there are some great reviews on here (far better than mine).",1321920000,4,2078,4.662125340599455

This is a slow, pensive, poetic movie with a sci-fi twist.  You need to be in the mood for something more on the artsy-fartsy side to enjoy this.  I, for one, loved it.  Thank goodness souls like Lars Von Trier and Ray Lamontagne (singer) have found their calling.  The telling of the human story is richer for it.",1321747200,4,592,4.425925925925926
2951090,2,B000VSDNF0,"MELANCHOLIA is lovely to look at and it's visuals are among the most impressive I've seen in a while. However, like THE TREE OF LIFE, the story and script are so unengaging that I was ultimately bored and highly irritated by the characters on screen. While the actors do justice to the material, it's the material that deadens this film to where you don't care about any of the characters as they are so self-absorbed and mopey that I was cheering for the planets to collide twenty minutes into the film. I won't go into the plot points here, but I found the whole set-up here to be too pretentious and a bit foppish. Dunst's character is so illogically constructed--she starts off as this lovely, smiling bride who is in love with her groom. Then in a matter of moments, she's this sullen, brooding harridan and there's no real segue into her dark descent. Her family members are all cinematic steroeotypes (the complaining sister, the bitter divorced mom and the shady daddy) and speak in generic platitutdes. And the groom is perfectly fine, but the bride decides to spurn him for no real reason and then has sex with a man who she (and the audience) barely knows. I know a lot of folks might think this is ""high art,"" but it's simply shoddy storytelling. Finally, the film turns towards the approaching planet and this is where it completely derides itself--focusing on four characters and their own self-loathing. By the end, I wanted the planet to win! It's a gorgeously made film and well acted; it's just dreadful in terms of its script and overall story.",1321747200,5,1563,4.666666666666667
2951091,5,B000VSDNF0,This movie is wonderful!!!!  I can not say enough good things about it!  The acting is superb.  The effects are wonderful.  The story line is something that everyone thinks about but is afraid to ask!  I'd give it 10 Stars if I could!,1321660800,4,234,4.348837209302325
2951092,3,B000VSDNF0,"There may be spoilers.

In the opening scene we see a bride running through a field while vines of some kind are grabbing at her ankles.  There are flowers in hand, a pond and a horse sitting near a footbridge.  All the while, the dynamic symphonic music of Richard Wagner plays over the dream sequence.  Then a loud rumbling of such magnitude that my two large sub-woofers moved the couch and rattled the pictures.  It was amazing.  I was able to see this film on the HDNet channel at the same time it was released in theaters.  The film then segues to the same bride inside a stretch limo along with her new husband (Alexander Skarsgard) enroute to a reception at a castle that would make Queen Elizabeth proud.  The film is divided into two parts, each named for the only characters that really matter.  Justine (Kirsten Dunst) is the bride.  Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is her sister and the wife of the man who owns the estate (complete with an 18 hole golf course) played by Kiefer Sutherland.

There is some mention early on about the unusual star in the sky.  It is a large planet that is making its way toward Earth.  John (Sutherland) insists that the science indicates the planet will come relatively close but in essence do a flyby.  No one seems overly concerned.  There are no radios or TV playing and certainly no panic by anyone.  Are the scientists making an honest prognosis or are they shielding the population?  We don't know.

Justine begins to act strange but we are led to believe she has some history of mental illness.  Both her parents played by John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling are a bit odd to say the least.  Claire seems to be the one holding everything together.  Justine comes and goes to the party.  She takes a bath, she returns to the party for a toast.  She stares at the sky, she returns.  She shuns her new husband's attempt at romance, but goes out to a sand trap on the golf course to have random sex with a stranger.  She returns to the party for some Champaign.  Eventually, Justine goes into a grave state of depression.  Her husband leaves her at the estate the next morning.  With Clair's help, Justine begins to regain control of her emotions.  She becomes stable, clear thinking and accepting of the situation.  All the while the planet named Melancholia looms closer and becomes a bright blue ball in the sky.  Now Claire becomes paranoid and the sister's roles reverse.

This entire section of the film, while perhaps essential is extremely tedious and unnecessarily long.  The final 30 minutes however switch gears and we become increasingly concerned about the potential collision...even when the foreign planet appears to be getting smaller and drifting away.  Controversial Danish director Lars von Trier doesn't spend any time on explosions, rescue missions, falling buildings, running animals, high winds, flooding or any other typical doom related effects.  What we do get is the sound of the huge planet coming toward Earth.  There go the subs again.

This movie is far from perfect.  The middle is muddled.  Von Trier throws metaphors, religion and subtext at us throughout. We get no substance of the science.  While both parents are British only Claire has a British accent.  There is no discounting the convincing performances by Gainsbourg and especially Dunst even with an American accent.  And I have to admit, I kept thinking about this movie long after it was over.",1321660800,53,3433,4.758913412563667

and/or emotionally.  However, this one did neither.  I am puzzled by the rave reviews.  Bright
and deep jewel toned colors and slow motion scenes of horses falling down just can't carry any movie.
Yes, the house is stunning, as is the setting.  And the images of Melancholia as it gets closer to
Earth are truly gorgeous, a planet that rivals ours in beauty as seen from a distance.  But all of
these are just the props around which the cast has to carry the movie, and the problem isn't the
cast or the props--it's the script.  I read that people are blown away by Kirsten Dunst's acting,
but I just see a flat character moping around an elaborate house, ripping her wedding dress as
she gets out of a golf cart, having bland, quick, unemotional sex with a near stranger, and
standing by calmly as her new husband leaves the wedding with his suitcase, kissing her on the
head, saying ""Yeah, I guess you're right.  I shouldn't have expected so much."" She did a much
better job acting in Spotless Mind.  The only stand out acting and fascinating character I
saw was Kiefer Sutherland's, who brought his character to life (listen to what he barks at
the servant who comes to help him with his monster telescope or what he says when Justine
claims that she's the only one who can ride Abraham.  I'm not a stranger to people with
depression--in fact a number of close family members have struggled with it,so I'm not speaking
out of ignorance when I say that there just isn't enough of life in the script for Dunst to
carry out a fully developed depressed character.",1321142400,6,1658,4.5369127516778525

Be prepared to feel everything the characters are feeling.  The pacing is slow, so even though it's PG-13, most teens will probably hate it.  The plot is also vague, yet the film never strays away from it.  In fact, you won't see the characters interact with anyone other than the main characters, with the exception for the butlers and ""the Bettys"".

It was a very different role than any we have seen him in before- a refreshing change. Only complaint was his story ended much too soon.

As a species we're not that great anyway. After millennia of civilization, culture, religion, social conventions the only thing we have collectively managed to accomplish is to self destruct more efficiently than ever. With art offering the sole occasional comfort.
So what if scientists and authoritarian figures are deceiving, often in order to hide their own cowardliness in the face of imminent danger like they do in this movie?
What if industrialists try to squeeze every bit of spirit we have left like in this movie?
What if loved ones offer no comfort in hour of need like in this movie?

I'm not going to insult anyone who didn't like Melancholia with the standard ""go watch Transformers or the latest Sandler flick"" attitude. That's why they make 31 flavors. Besides, I love a good popcorn movie as much as anyone. But I kinda feel bad for the bashers of this film in the same way I feel bad for those who don't enjoy Mozart along with their Nirvana.

Even if they didn't like it, I can't imagine a real movie lover not at least seeing the craftsmanship in this movie. I just can't take seriously any one-star reviews of this.

Action-packed, it is not. Science fiction, it is barely. For those who have either experienced depression or have had family members struggle with it, the film is likely to hit home in one way or another.

Not for all, but this movie certainly called to me despite my misgivings about Kirsten Dunst's ability to fulfill this role. I'm glad I rented it, and if after watching the previews you too feel a compulsion to see what Cannes was raving about, I'd strongly recommend the rental.

2951142,5,B000VSDNF0,"Let me preface my review by quickly stating that this is a Lars von Trier film. If you know what that means, you don't need to read any reviews or previews to know what you're getting yourself into. You either love or you hate the man's style. If you don't, well, you end up like the people who are giving this a 1-star review because they came in expecting something completely different. All reviews, professional and amateur alike, are biased in regards to his films: hell, even Roger Ebert completely missed the point of Antichrist because his judgement on it was clouded. But heed this - if you want to see Kirsten Dunst naked, you came to the right place. However, if you don't want to see over 2 hours of a slow-paced crescendo of depression and madness, you probably wanna skip it.

This movie is about that: depression. Reactions to heartbreaking events, overwhelming guilt and despair, impending doom, how we handle stress, deal with trivial things in the midst of chaos, things like that. It's the feel-bad hit the winter and everything about it screams masterpiece but it's not for everyone. Mind you, it's nowhere near as graphic as Antichrist or, in my opinion, as saddening as Dancer in the Dark but it's still a downer if you're not in the mood to sit down and really watch a film about the physical/metaphorical end of the world. Hopefully you are, though, because it's one of the best movies I've seen in recent memory. The acting for the most part is spot on (save for Alexander Skarsgrd who seems like he's reading his lines from off-screen), the cinematography is really beautiful, and the subtle sound design feels haunting throughout. For a movie that takes its time, you never feel like it's drudging, which is remarkable since the first half of the movie plays a LOT like Festen, a dogme 95 staple, which DID feel that way a lot of the time to me. If you're on the fence about this movie, gauge it against the other art-house movies you've seen or let the fact that it's bound to grab award noms like crazy sway your decision but, please, don't expect a traditional climax and feel ripped off when you didn't get your slow motion explosions or Sigur Ros music on the last freeze frame.

I don't want to say too much because the film works from a tension poised on the unknowable (yet, somehow, certain) future. Dunst carries almost the entire film with the purest presentation of intense depression I've ever seen from an actor. Also, if Sutherland didn't have such a distinct voice (and forehead) I wouldn't have recognized him. That's a good thing, by the way. The visual effects are perfect and that means a lot in a film that isn't effects-heavy. It is all interpersonal tension even though there is the threat of global annihilation. I grade this one 9 stars out of 10 without thinking twice. TOTALLY worth 2.25 hours - every damn minute.",1320537600,17,752,4.837209302325581
2951164,4,B000VSDNF0,"Armageddon is given a surrealistic, chaotic and thoroughly avant-garde treatment that only Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breaking-the-Waves/dp/6305899681/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breaking the Waves</a>) can give such a grave subject. This is no Michael Bay-style extravaganza of bombastic special effects but rather a brooding mood piece that is bound to frustrate as much as it impresses, quite often in the same scene due to von Trier's emotionally jarring, uniquely idiosyncratic perspective. At the same time, this 2011 drama is probably his most accessible work for a mass audience, even if it amounts to a study in psychological depression. The narrative splits evenly into two parts revolving around the lives of two sisters, Justine and Claire, on a large estate owned by Claire and her no-nonsense husband John.

The first part, entitled simply ""Justine"", is about her elaborate wedding to Michael on the estate and how their reception deteriorates into emotional chaos and deception. Initially, Justine appears to be a carefree bride, but she turns out to be a rising creative director at an ad agency gradually revealing herself to be a manic-depressive on a path toward self-destruction. This part of the film is filled with von Trier's penchant for shaky hand-held camera shots and awkward confrontation scenes that turn the party into a social apocalypse. The second half, entitled ""Claire"", carries forth the natural consequence of the failed wedding with Justine in a catatonic state and now within the context of the impending collision of a rogue planet called Melancholia. The inevitability of the situation causes the sisters to transform their natures relative to each other - Justine changes from fatalistic to near-spiritual, while Claire moves from protective and insular to uncontrollably fearful.

As with several of his more renowned films, von Trier has assembled an eclectic cast of actors whose differing accents would come across as puzzling if this was not clearly one of his ensemble films. Keeping a relatively low profile of late, Kirsten Dunst delivers a powerful, sometimes unsettling performance as Justine, a near-impossible role that takes advantage of her combination of unforced winsomeness and singular introspection. Looking nothing like Dunst, Charlotte Gainsbourg (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Antichrist/dp/B003KGBISO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Antichrist</a>) is watchful in the more restrained role of Claire even as her character spins out of control toward the end. As her patronizing husband John, Kiefer Sutherland has to play close to the vest exuding contrived optimism in the face of insurmountable odds.

Melancholia is painful to say the least.

How bad was it?

The first ten minutes are ultra-slow mo, beautifully composed shots. They all have a fairy-tale aesthetic to it.

Then we're thrusted into present day world. The blushing bride is probably one of the most depressed characters I've seen portrayed on screen. She can't put on a smile for her own wedding and goes on to do atrocious acts like having sex with a stranger and peeing on the golf course. Obviously we're not fond of our protagonist at this point.

I kept waiting for it to get good but honestly this film is just a pretty portrait of meaninglessness. It's not hard to catch the metaphor and undying theme: A planet named Melancholia is set to collide with earth, destroying all life. Lars Von Trier paints us a picture of how pointless everything is and how we'll all die anyways.

I almost started feeling that way watching the film but thankfully Tree of Life reminded me how worthwhile life is.

Lar Von Trier, I respect you for making a beautiful film like this... but dude lighten up. I know you've got it in you after all those jokes at Cannes. Please make a comedy or a film that actually gives the viewer a good experience rather than an endurance test.",1320451200,7,1266,4.526315789473684

Being a huge fan of Lars Von Trier's work I was highly anticipating this film. It was released in cinemas on 29 May 2011 in the Czech Republic on 12 screens as well as other locations like Denmark, Finland and Italy. It soon will come to theaters in the US. Luckily we live in the time that we do and this movie can be streamed before its US theatrical release. I took advantage of this and greatly enjoyed watching this film from the comfort of my own home.

I loved Antichrist. In my opinion it is Trier's best work. It was a very disturbing film, yet it had a very strong message with hidden meanings and was all around a beautiful poetic piece of work.

Melancholia also is a beautiful film, though I believe I expected more. Antichrist is very deep and constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat because so much is happening and you must decipher the message and meaning of the film. Melancholia is very slow and drawn out. Lars Von Trier did this due to the high anticipation of what will happen, and if it will happen. Trier used the characters anxiety and built upon that and made the viewer feel that anxiety too. Just like Antichrist, Melancholia is a feeling. Your not just watching a movie, eating popcorn and drinking a pop, you are feeling this film.

Just a quick summary for those who don't know, Melancholia is a planet which is seemingly coming closer to Earth. This phenomenon happens when Justine (Kirsten Dunst) has just been married to Michael (Alexander Skarsgrd). Justine's sister, Clair (Charlotte Gainsbourg), her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland), and Justine and Clair's mother Gaby (Charlotte Rampling) greatly put pressure on Justine to have this perfect wedding. Justine is not very interested in the wedding reception and seems to come in and out of reality. She is not the type of person to have such a large wedding because she doesn't care. She is a wild girl who seems to have been roped into marrying Michael and marrying into this new family which she is nothing like. There is a lot of drama in this film and for the first half, Melancholia is a back story which the viewer patiently waits for.

The cast is amazing and works well together. I really enjoyed Kiefer Sutherlands character. Kirsten Dunst did an amazing job, however her performance seems unbalanced at times, though the character she is playing is unbalanced.

After viewing this film I was left speechless due to the raw power of the cast and the images of the film itself. However it made me feel very uneasy, disturbed and very anxious. I immediately thought, ""I never want to watch that again"". Yet I cannot get it out of my mind and I watched it again later that night.

This film makes you think and ponder your own existence in this world and how you would face such a horrid calamity as an Apocalypse. It will either catch you in its grip or make you wish you were somewhere else...there is no middle ground with this film and you will come away with a totally different outlook on many aspects in your life. I give it a 5 star for one, Kirsten Dunst is a superb actress in this film and all the characters add their own bit of balance to her dilemma. If you don't like having to search your own feelings, or deal with apocalyptic scenarios, then this is not a film you'll want to see. But, if you are able to look at it with an open mind and ponder how it would make you feel then you'll want to watch this awesome film. Highly recommended.",1320192000,6,933,4.247191011235955

2951202,4,B000VSDNF0,"I've read some of the reviews here and I think a lot of people are looking at this film in a wrong perspective. The idea for the film originated during a therapy session Lars von Trier attended during treatments for his depression. The therapist told him that depressive people tend to act more calmly than others under heavy pressure, because they already expect bad things to happen. It's not about science fiction and it's not a disaster movie. It's a film that examines the human psyche during a disaster. The film is very subtle and yes slow at times  but as someone whos struggled with severe depression I related to and understood Kirsten Dunst's character so much. We're dealing with such flawed and sad characters so the slow pace made sense. I would say this is more of a psychological drama than anything else. This film is so beautiful and the acting is superb.",1319846400,651,873,4.6688311688311686
2951203,5,B000VSDNF0,"`Melancholia' is a film that is going to be extremely divisive.  Not everyone is going to appreciate this, and yet there are going to be some that laud this as one of the finest films ever made.  I can certainly see its flaws, and yet there is this underlying captivating atmosphere that I can't help but wholly appreciate.

`Melancholia' is a unique and engrossing experience that is less what it seems and more what you'd come to expect from an auteur as controversial as Lars von Trier.

The opening montage of cataclysmic destruction plays out like a Vogue editorial shoot captured in slow motion.  It seems almost anticlimactic to show us the end before the beginning, and while I understand that this cinematic trick (or gimmick) is initially rather off-putting and presumes to fail the overall purpose of the film somewhat by showing us the cause of concern before we truly understand the concern building in the key characters, it works in a way that I can't quite explain.  I personally was rather upset with the sequence upon watching it, but as the film tied itself together I found myself calling it to mind with awe for I saw how the pieces of that puzzle came together in an unexpected way.

And, one cannot forsake its beauty.

And then the actual film starts, which is broken into two sections.

The first part of `Melancholia' focuses on Justine, the bride.  Her lavish wedding begins with promise.  Her `filthy rich' brother-in-law has paid for the spectacle to take place at his gigantic home, complete with a butler, an 18 hole golf course and a slew of guest rooms (with baths, not showers).  The joyous couple show up late, thanks to an oversized limo and some narrowly curved roads, and then all joy seems to evaporate as Justine's intense depression sets in and begins to erode her happiness.  Everyone around her fails to understand her condition, even though most of them try (especially her groom and her sister).  Justine seems bewitched by a red star she seems looming overhead; a star that goes unseen by the others.  This star sets a strange precedent for the remains of the evening as Justine's behavior becomes more reclusive and catatonic almost.

Bridges are burned, relationships are broken all hope is lost.

The second half switches focus to Claire, the elder sister.  While Justine is certainly suffering from depression, Claire begins to delve into paranoia as the impending collision with the mysterious planet Melancholia grows closer and closer.  They don't ever say how much time as elapsed since the wedding, where that `star' first reared its head, but Justine is still sulking in misery and the agitation she caused on that `blessed day' obviously still lingers.

""It tastes like ashes.""

With only five days left before Melancholia is supposed to `pass' Earth, Claire and Justine begin to come to terms with the inevitabilities of their futures.

At the core of `Melancholia' is a sharply constructed look at mental instability and the effect it has on our own personal survival.  Justine's character is of particular interest because her depression, which is initially assumed to stem from the planet traveling towards Earth, is almost eased by the foreknowledge that the end is coming.  She possesses a unique bond with the planet, a connection (as seen by her nude moon-bathing) that helps ease her dissention since she is obviously of the accord that life on Earth is corrupted; infected with an evil that, even in its most unintuitive form is still prevalent and contaminating.

For her, eradication is a way out of a life she cannot support.

From a technical standpoint, `Melancholia' is something special.  The imagery is stunning.  Lars von Trier has a great track record of using a film's cinematography to eclipse the viewer and sustain his themes.  `Antichrist' was a film that suffered in conception and yet it was sustained to a degree thanks to the beautiful and captivating way in which it was shot (not to mention Gainsbourg's phenomenal performance).  Here, the night sky is illuminated by cascading stars and eerily shifted cloud structures.  Even the murky yet polished way in which the close-ups are rendered is astonishing to watch.  I was really taken by the nostalgic score, one that embodied the same sound and atmosphere as the classic apocalyptic and science fiction films.  The drama is there, bolded with each swell in the music.

Performance-wise, the film belongs to Kirsten Dunst.  She is remarkable here.  This is a truly restrained and intimate performance, no real showboating or dramatics involved.  Instead, Dunst takes a far more realistic look at depression by holding it all in.  Sure, she has her crying fits and breakdowns, but she internalizes so much.  I'm so happy for her Cannes win, especially since Oscar will most likely look the other way (they like their actresses to SHOW their pain), but I completely concur with many who say this is quite possibly her finest work.  She has been one of my favorite actresses for years, and I am so thrilled to see her making some intriguing and rewarding film choices (she should have won the Oscar last year for her tremendous work in `All Good Things').  I also was wholly impressed with Kiefer Sutherland, who dwelled in the skin of his character, adding little touches that made him feel complete as opposed to a mere prop (unlike the younger Skarsgard, who just proved uninteresting).  Kiefer portrays an odd warmth, paternal and yet elusively selfish.  You can see his colors changing as the film progresses, and his many shades, while never blatant or wholly exposed, haunt long after he's left the screen.

In the end, `Melancholia' is probably the strangest `apocalyptic' film you'll ever see, and while it contains certain flaws, those flaws are swallowed and digested by the films ravenous pluses.  The pacing is extraordinary (don't listen to the naysayers claiming this film drags, for it most certainly does not) for it allows the impending dread to set it slowly, meticulously, calculated and yet entirely natural so that you feel yourself letting go as you watch Justine and Claire prepare themselves for the afterlife.",1319587200,8,6170,4.94180407371484

2951207,4,B000VSDNF0,"""Melancholia"" may be the most accessible Lars Von Trier film I've ever seen. (However, for a director who often goes out of his way to alienate, repulse, and irritate his audience, that is not saying much.) ""Melancholia"" is beautifully shot and visually lovely to look at; gone is the difficult visual minimalism of films like ""Dogville"". Also gone is the gory brutality that is often part of Von Trier's films (especially his last film, ""Antichrist"".) ""Melancholia"" is a thoughtful, fascinating film told in two distinct, yet overlapping, parts.

The first part, ""Justine"", is a realistic, sad family drama which tells the story of a young bride who implodes on her wedding day. Just married to a handsome man, promoted by her boss, and treated to a lavish party by her rich brother-in-law, Justine has every reason to be happy. Except she's not. Behind her forced smile, she's hiding a dark depression. By the end of the night Justine's depression, along with the selfishness and dysfunction of those around her, cause her to destroy both her brand new marriage and her career, and spiral into a dramatic depressive breakdown. Von Trier seems to have a deep interest in female protagonists who are being crushed by the expectations of those around them. In films like ""Breaking the Waves"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"", the characters were treated to sordid and gruesome abuse, but in the first half of ""Melancholia"", Justine is a more or less ordinary person suffering in a more conventional and relatable way.

The second part of the film, ""Claire"", puts the focus on Justine's older sister. Claire is concerned about the reports in the news that a previously unknown planet, named Melancholia, will be passing close to the Earth's orbit. While most scientists believe that the planet will pass at a safe distance, there are those who also believe that an imminent collision will mean the end of the world. Claire's anxiety about the situation builds as the planet comes closer. Claire is also dealing with her sister's (Justine) post-wedding nervous breakdown. As the planet grows ever closer to Earth, the tension builds, until the characters are left to deal with the very real possibility that the world is going to end.

By splitting the film up into two parts in this way, ""Melancholia"" explores the themes of loss, destruction, impermanence, and loneliness, first on an intimate scale (""Justine"") and then on a global scale (""Claire""). Although the film is provocative and often painful, it's more subtle and nuanced than any of Von Trier's other films I've seen, and perhaps more affective.",1318809600,346,2597,4.993071593533488

It is a beautiful and thought-provoking drama about belief in relationships and the pain that is felt when relationships end.  Or even more deeply, when one's past experiences or beliefs cause one to have no hope that one can find happiness in any kind of relationship.  *** SPOILER ALERT ***  The story is told through the highly unconventional metaphor of colliding planets and the extinction of all life.  Justine's depressive behavior, Claire's search for an emotional connection and the dysfunctional nature of the entire extended family are portrayed via the incredibly powerful symbolism of the blue planet.  But the planet is not the story - planets do not suddenly reverse themselves in their orbits, and horses and electric golf carts do not suddenly stop at a specific bridge.  As Justine says to Claire when the latter is trying to reach the village, ""This has nothing to do with the village"".  She is saying that a person cannot run away from what is in his/her mind.

The imagery, music and acting combine to make this a unique, moody and contemplative film.  If you like to think about films and discuss them with your friends, Lars gives you plenty of material.

2951242,5,B000VSDNF0,"Lars Von Trier's ""Melancholia"" is ambitious, stunning, and revelatory. The performances are all excellent. The use of hand-held cameras gave the movie a grittier, more realistic feel than, say, ""Dogville.""

The early scenes at the dinner reception brought to mind the similar shakily unease of the same wedding-related dinner sequences in Jonathon Demme's excellent ""Rachel Getting Married."" (Although ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is still his greatest picture.)

Von Trier's previous film, ""Antichrist,"" was great in the sense that it came directly from his own disturbed psyche, and without any sugar-coating just to get an R rating. That was what made it fascinating to me.

""Melancholia,"" however, is a truly great film, even a classic one, if I may be so bold (and I'll take that as a ""yes""). It is Von Trier's best picture (""Dogville"" is now in second place). Absorbing and intimate, ""Melancholia"" is a probing examination of what it means to be human, as well as what it means to be a part of humanity.

The bulk of the film, however, consists of the plodding, repetitive, stilted Part 1: Justine (focusing on one sister's escalating depression during the night of her horrific bourgeois wedding reception) and the more interesting Part 2: Claire (which centers on the other sister's escalating panic at the thought of the earth being destroyed).

2951244,5,B000VSDNF0,"Lars von Trier is a master in creating films that jar the audience into a different level of perception.  His films (Dogville, Dancing in the Dark, Europa, AntiChrist, Breaking the Waves) explore the use of stage sets as though we were in the legitimate theater instead of a movie theater, uses the camera in a fashion that makes allows the viewer the feeling that we are overhearing or secretly observing of the characters the actors are portraying, writes stories that seduce us to think vertically instead of horizontally, and paints his films with music that is unexpectedly poignant to his story. Such is the case with MELANCHOLIA, a film that is yet to be released, one that likely will have a small audience in the art film houses, but at the same time for those fortunate enough to see this work of cinematic art it will jolt into the realm of possibilities about the end of life as we know it.

The film opens the way it ends: a planet named Melancholia hidden by our sun circles into the earth's atmosphere and collides with earth.  The extended opening sequence is carried out is gorgeous pictures that reveal a tranquil stage set as the strange collision takes place - all to the Prelude to Wagner's 'Tristan und Isolde' (beautifully played by the Prague Philharmonic with some arranging from music director Kristian Eidnes Andersen).  The two hour film is dived into Part one: Justine and Part two: Claire.  Once the action begins we discover Justine (Kirsten Dunst) - in full bridal regalia - and her husband Michael (Alexander Skarsgrd) attempting to manipulate a wedding limousine to the mansion where Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) and their little son Leo (Cameron Spurr) have been waiting for hours to begin the vastly expensive wedding party. Present at the party are Dexter (John Hurt) this discombobulated father of the sisters, the girl's vitriolic mother Gaby (Charlotte Rampling), Justine's boss Jack (Stellan Skarsgrd), a new speech writer for Jack's company Tim (Brady Corbet), Michael's parents (James Cagnard and Deborah Fronko) and the wedding planner and assistant (Udo Kier and Jesper Christensen).  The party is tense and we slowly realize that Justine is 'distracted': she seems to be suffering from a form of melancholia and spends her time at the party unwisely (a physical encounter in the garden with Tim, napping, and always at odds with Claire and John, and eventually wandering off to be alone, away from Michael.  There is a new star in the sky that the people dismiss but that some say is a planet headed in a collision course with the earth.  In Part two we find Justine being returned to Claire's home, disheveled, and the relationship of the sisters is more fully explored.  There is an air of anxiety - the time of the predicted collision is approaching and the manner in which all observe what follows is at once terrifying and eloquently meaningful.

The entire cast is brilliant. Many viewers may find this film a preposterous apocalyptic vision, many will see it as an overly long and self indulgent artsy piece by von Trier, but the beauty of the film is not only in the visual aspects and the musical aspects of the production but in the intensely realistic view of a truly dysfunctional family - and perhaps that is the driving force of the collision of relationships as we currently view them that merely marry the metaphor of Justine's melancholia with the incipient act of the strange planet Melancholia's collision with earth.

However, the special effects and their integration into the cinematography were flawless and very entertaining.

The actors were gorgeous and I appreciated the choice of very little makeup and tasteful costumes. I wish the wedding part in the beginning was about half as long and feel the movie got more exciting once into Claire's part but still loved all of it very much. Lars Von Trier is amazing.

2951248,3,B000VSDNF0,"""Melancholia"" is part of the six-part V-cinema series called ""Series Kyofu Yawa"" (""Series Horror Night Tale"") that includes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Demon-Hunting/dp/B000QCU9H6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Demon Hunting</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Coffin/dp/B000SSQ7LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Coffin</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legend-of-Ogre/dp/B000VSDNEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legend of Ogre</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Site/dp/B000SSQ7LU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Site</a>.  The series is a try-out for new talent, and director Takaaki Ezura is making his first feature here

The Kyofu Yawa series is extremely low-budget, filmed on digital video and staring mostly amateur cast.  The level of filmmaking and action is about the same as a cheap TV movie, and no one should mistake this for a feature film.  At 90 minutes ""Melancholia"" is a pretty short flick.

The story follows a group of friends who gather one last time at a park that will soon be developed into a housing complex.  One of the girls is moving away, and the friends are saying goodbye.  The girl moves in with her aunt and uncle, and things start to get weird from there.  In her new house, she hears noises coming from a room that she is forbidden to enter.  Meanwhile, her old friends are being visited and murdered by the same girl, who appears to be able to be in two places at once.  Eventually, secrets start coming out and she learns that she is a twin clone, created by a mad scientist who wanted to do a study on human morality and raised two genetically identical people in different circumstances to see how they would come out.

I have seen a few of the Kyofu Yawa series, so I know what to expect and keep my expectations low.  For what it is, ""Melancholia"" isn't horrible.  The cloning story adds some interest to a standard doppelganger plot, and the director and actors do their best in the confines of the budget.  I have seen much, much better low-budget horror flicks, but I have also seen worse.

For the lead actresses, Kyofu Yawa likes to recruit from the world of Japanese bikini models, and making an appearance here is Hikaru Kawamura.  Hikaru looks pretty, but her acting mainly seems to consist of grabbing her head and screaming.  I don't see a long movie career in front of her.

Also, anyone seeing ""bikini model"" should not get the wrong idea.  There is no cheesecake and Hikaru remains fully dressed as does everyone else.  Anyone expecting a gore-fest had better look elsewhere as well, as the killing happens mostly off-frame.",1289347200,,2769,5.790123456790123

IMDB doesn't even have a page for it. I tried searching by director (Takaaki Ezura) and the lead actors (Hikaru Kawamura, Mikio Sato) to no avail.

3181669,4,B000VSDNF0,"This is a notice for all buyers that the film being sold here is a Japanese film, not an American film of the same name. The cover is of the Japanese horror film. The descriptions are mixed up-the cast is listed as all American names but yet the description shows that the film is in Japanese-and the time, date of release and studio all match the Japanese film of the same name.
Here is the description off the back cover:
""Following her father's death, Mirai moves into a house with her uncle and his wife but finds herself lost and confused as she begins to have horrible visions. Mysteriously people around her begin dying one by one and Mirai sets off on a desperate search into her past in an attempt to find the murderer. The past uncovers a mystery that is linked to a startling family secret.""
OK, I watched this film and it starts off like it was a made-for-TV movie, and by that I only mean the lighting is different-it has that television show quality. The story starts off a bit disjointed but picks up when Miria starts having these visions and friends get killed off. As she investigates (with help from a cute friend that has more than a friendly interest in her), she digs deeper and deeper into a mystery that could get her killed trying to solve it. It has some good plot twists and the ending isn't predictable, so it is fresh enough that fans of Asian horror will likely be satisfied.

3181703,5,B000VSDNF0,"The opening scenes were disorienting.  I kept thinking maybe I was watching the snippets of a movie that sometimes loop before you hit the play button.  Then, suddenly a more standard scene began:  A wedding at a manor in the countryside.  The remote setting harkens back to the 1800s except there's a golf course instead of hunting grounds.  Kirsten Dunst is the giddy bride whose behavior keeps going off kilter.  There's brief discussion of an astronomical event related to the planet Melancholia then the bizarre wedding scene continues.  By the end of the first act, Dunst/Justine has become completely uninhibited, violating all norms and decorum.

Act two begins with the longsuffering sister, Claire, coaxing Justine back to the manor as if dealing with a small child.  Justine's recklessness has deteriorated into a deep depression.  It's days after the wedding and the main event is planet Melancholia passing by Earth.  Only the two sisters along with Claire's husband and son reside in the house now.  Claire's mood levels out though she's bleak.  And odd events recurrence indicates some supernatural or symbolic meaning.  By the end the significance is clear enough, a fairly powerful statement.

3181779,4,B000VSDNF0,"Some compare this film to Terence Malick's  Tree of Life.  Here's my comparison - one of these films is overrated tedious pretentious twaddle and the other is a stylish wonder directed by Lars von Trier.

In Part 1 of the Trier one, Melancholia, a handsome couple, Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and Michael (Alexander Skarsgard) arrive at their wedding reception in a weird Maxfield Parrish twilight.  Everything is beautiful in the castle guesthouse, but the newlyweds are two hours late and a whiff of despair accompanies them.  We don't know why. The bride's sister Claire (a careworn Charlotte Gainsbourg) is exasperated but not surprised. Claire's husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) is beyond exasperated and wants to be sure that Justine knows how much this wedding is costing him; Claire and John own and operate the guesthouse. The bride is alternately smiling delightedly and morosely detached.  We learn that she has promised Claire that she will not make a scene on this night. Justine suffers from melancholia, in the medical sense of a deep and persistent soul-eating misery.  The night does not go well.  Justine's rakish father (a spoon-stealing John Hurt) stolidly avoids the heart-to-heart his daughter wants.  Her mother (a sour Charlotte Rampling) loudly deplores marriage and tells Justine to get out while she can.  Kind, unsuspecting Michael is way out of his depth.  Justine's ghastly boss (Stellan Skarsgard) and his newly-employed nephew Tim (Brady Corbet) - well, the less said the better.  In short, the marriage doesn't take.  Justine sleepwalks, alienates and insults her way right out of it, just as mummy suggested.  It's a night that everyone will remember - for the rest of their lives.

Some time later Justine, now virtually catatonic, goes to stay with Claire,  John  and their son Leo (Cameron Spurr) in the same guest house - although there are no guests.  The red star Arcturus, which Justine noted on her wedding night, (one such sighting heart-swellingly coinciding with a crescendo in Wagner's ""Tristan and Isolde"") has disappeared behind a planet called Melancholia, which in its turn has been ""hiding"" behind the sun and is now approaching the Earth.  Scientists are divided - Melancholia will fly by the Earth or it will collide with it. One or the other. But that ""hiding"" suggests motive and malice.  We know from the wonderful opening sequence of slow-motion shots of birds falling, lightning, Justine dragging muddy grey snares and planets colliding, that this will be no fly-by. We later recognise  these Peter Greenaway-like moments of surreal heaviness and profundity as perhaps the experience of those who inhabit the infinitesimal and eternal, liminal space of the final moments when the laws of physics of this planet are blown to pieces.

The three adults and Leo are strangely isolated - no phones ring, there is no television or radio, the internet is rarely used, no helicopters fly over, no ravening hordes of final-dayers or doomsday preppers climb over the fence.  When Justine twice tries to ride her horse across the bridge to the village he baulks and will not cross, nor can Claire cross in the golf buggy.  We are told that a character whom we know to be dead has ""gone into the village"".  Where is this mansion on a bay with an eighteen (sometimes nineteen) hole golf-course and formal garden?  Some of the characters have English accents, some American, some Scandanavian.  But it's the end of days.  We are nowhere.

John, all bluff optimism, reassures Claire that they are in no danger. Justine, reminiscent of another enigmatic, doomed, blonde beauty, Miranda, ""knows things"".  Like the girls on Hanging Rock - Claire, Leo and Justine spend much of their time sleeping.  John watches the skies with his telescope.  Melancholia approaches and recedes. Then approaches. ""There's your fly-by"" Justine says nastily. Justine is a nihilist, certain that life is ""evil"", ""'life is only on earth and not for long"".  She awaits the end with a cold, bitter fury. The last scene - one of the best movie endings of all time - emblematises her incandescent rage, in all its tragic glory.

Certainly Melancholia is not flawless - Trier's symbolism is not subtle (yes, lily of the valley is creepy); the wedding scene is too long; why is John paying for the wedding?; Kirsten takes her clothes off a bit too much; the ""surprise"" death of a major character is not plausible and is flagged with blinking neon lights; we wonder how Justine could ever have succeeded in advertising; Leo is there simply to provide ""a child"" for the end of the world scenario - he's curiously characterless and listless. Critics witter on about whether the two parts of the film (Justine / Claire) represent imagination/reality, or capitalism/religion v science, or internal destruction/external obliteration, or male reason/female feeling, or the fruitlessness of human activity/the magnificent indifference of the cosmos, and I too could witter on about these things.  But to get bogged down in these muddy grey snares is to try to make the film more than it is, or needs to be.",1487203200,5,5107,5.039285714285715

I get no joy from bashing others for anything except who they voted for in the last election, so I will say just that clearly, we all seem to agree that this movie definitely does appeal to a certain demographic, and definitely does not appeal to a certain other demographic.  I come at this from a fairly unique perspective: I'm an astrologer (not by profession because it just does not call me to get paid for it, but I could get paid for it.).  I am also a highly-sensitive person, which is a) a real thing (you'll find books on it right here on Amazon) and b) not a disorder and c) while this type of person is predisposed to depression more than someone who isn't an HSP, depression does not necessarily go hand in hand with it.  So NO, you do not have to have experience with depression to enjoy this movie as some have said  thats RIDICULOUS.  You just have to be a bit on the deep and existential end of the psychological and philosophical continuum.

Anyway, perhaps my astrology knowledge and the spiritual views this has created in me lets me see these scenes differently from most.  This is a movie about how knowing the certain end is ahead of you affects the psyches of the people involved and how they deal with the impending end of everything and everyone.  It does not matter that these characters are rich, and that alone should not exclude treating them like people in your minds (again, reflecting other reviews I read).  I think they're wealthy with everything we value on Earth going for them in order to illustrate that when the ending comes, it comes for all, and at the time of the total destruction of the planet, nobody will be saved by how much money they have.  Yes, Kirsten Dunst's character is deeply depressed, but it's being rather pedestrian to not see the reason.  She is aware because she has heightened sensitivity that causes her to feel this planet -- she has something of a kinship with it -- that it is coming to destroy everything.  The scene in which she basks naked under its glow is meant to reflect her energetic resonance with it.  Shes comfortable, even ecstatic, under its influence.  Think of what you might do under the sun and why if nobody was watching, and that might accurately reflect why she is lying naked on rocks basking in the glow of Melancholia. It's not random and it was not just an excuse to get a nude shot of Dunst into the movie. Because Mel is coming to destroy everything, nothing in her life that she's held as meaningful is meaningful anymore.  She's has episodic, existential depression in the beginning, and by the way, good luck not having any yourselves if this situation were to happen in real life.  She had an important, prestigious job but worked for an appalling man for whom she had no respect, and like so many of us, had to put on a lot of masks to make that work.  She's gotten married to a cute guy whom she cares about but this marriage too was probably a choice made to please others (Alexander Skarsgard plays her fiance/husband of ten seconds.  ""True Blood"" fans will know as ""Eric,"" the Viking vampire). With no future ahead of them, it has no MEANING; she's going through with the party because her brother-in-law (Sutherland) paid for it (he doesn't let anyone forget this for a second) and can't get his money back.  All the masks come off, the wall of illusion crashes, because there simply is no REASON to maintain them anymore. At the wedding reception, which is about to happen as the film opens, everyone is aware that this planet is headed toward Earth, but not everyone is of the same mind as to whether or not it will make impact or pass close by, especially Dunst's wealthy scientist brother-in-law who has his own special brand of denial going happening.  By the end of the movie, everyone has dealt with it in a way that makes sense for who they are.

I can take up more space talking about how beautifully shot this was, but thats been said.  I cant see anyone who thinks deeply and sees life for what it is not appreciating this film, and if thats not you, thats fine, just be a student of life and the world at least enough to not say things like Maybe its for you if you have experience with depression.  Its just an incredibly shallow view of life and other people.  It's not for people with major depressive disorder only because YOU don't get it, you just don't get it.",1480464000,4,4463,4.480246913580247

Or what I THINK is going on. Movie-lovers, you know what I'm taking about when I say it called me back; by that I mean that I could not get it out of my head until I bought it and could watch it again, no joke. I think I was impressed by this movie mostly because it made me think, made me pay attention; nobody holds your hand and spells everything out for you.

3181853,2,B000VSDNF0,"Oh so boring! The intro was the longest, and dullest I've ever seen. Beautiful, yes, but all I could think was, ""Is the movie ever going to actually start?"" Then the first half is all one night- the wedding reception of a woman with depression. It doesn't delve into any character enough for you to get attached or care about them. It goes on for just over an hour before they even mention this planet that is supposed to do a fly-by of earth. There is no explanation of any science (how has no one known about this planet before, etc). The second part is labeled with the bride's sister's name, but it barely tells you anything about her, other than she's scared about the planet and reads webpages that predict doom. And of course, the planet crashes into earth in the final scene, and that's that.
I don't know that I've seen any von Trier movies before. I don't hate the ""artsy"" flicks, but this really couldn't hold my attention.

Part sci-fi, part psychological, the film had me wondering how things would turn out the entire movie until the ending when the conclusion became apparent.

3181859,4,B000VSDNF0,"I can understand why some may talk negatively about this film. This is my first Lars von Trier film but I know most of his work tends to be critical of humanity. Some reviews may point out its incredibly slow pacing and I can see what they mean. However, I believe the pacing was meant to be slow in order to exemplify the feeling of depression gradually creeping up on you. Even if this was Lars's true intention, I do think it could have been trimmed down in a way that it's not too slow.

Second of all, this film gets very abstract at times. While some may call this being self-indulgent or even pretentious, I consider it necessary in order to provide more meaning in its overall theme and message (that's as long as it contributes to it). And I gotta say, a lot of this film was very beautifully shot. However, I will say some of the camera work was really lazy at times with the image going out of focus a little too often. There was one shot where I was sure that I saw the shadow of the camera operator. But overall, the composition of the shots are very well made, especially the opening sequence. The opening sequence was probably one of my favorite parts of the movie.

Overall, I'd say give this film a shot. Despite some of my personal gripes with it, it tells a really interesting story that portrays depression from a unique perspective along with a very impressive performance from Kirsten Dunst.",1477094400,,1413,4.430769230769231

3181984,5,B000VSDNF0,"After a lengthy and beautiful scenic overture filmed to music from Wagner's Tristan and Isolde, the movie itself begins with Kirsten Dunst as newlywed Justine, happy and chipper, in the stretch limo she requested, trying to navigate turns too tight for it. This is the first indication we have that she's going to destroy life and marriage, and her success excites her. The first lengthy story in Melancholia is, in fact, Justine's methodical demolition of the carefully-planned celebration that her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) has crafted and Claire's husband (Kiefer Sutherland) has paid for. As the story develops, Justine travels deeper into her own personal, inescapable melancholia, consuming what should have been one of the great pinnacles of her life. Depression here, the catastrophe of self-destruction, is as difficult to watch as it is to experience.

*** Here be Spoilers ***

If, as one reviewer said, Justine is a play on Artemis, then John Hurt is excellent as her philandering Zeus father, distant and unreachable; while Charlotte Rampling's Hera is bitter and scolding, mocking the celebration (as we do, and the movie itself does) as ludicrous.

Or, Justine is the witch Isolde portended in the Wagner; using craft and potions and wiles to make her way through men. If Claire binds in love, then Justine complements her in death. All we're lacking is Jessye Norman.

The movie's central device is the planet Melancholia, which makes a brief appearance in the first part, then dominates in the second as it appears to be on a collision course with the Earth.

The second half of the movie belongs to Claire, the patient obsessive-compulsive wife-mother-sister who copes with her sister's clinical depression while trying to contain her dread at the coming calamity. Sutherland's dinner toast ""to life"" brings home Justine's Cassandra-like proclamation that, indeed, Earth is life, and of the universe, all the life therein. All of the terror centers in Claire as the planet Melancholia swings past in its near-miss in the middle of the night, while Justine is incapable of bringing herself to care either way. The next morning is bright and cheerful but underscored by the moodiness of her husband, and her renewed terror on discovering that Melancholia is circling back to strike its fatal blow at Earth.

The final scene as the three create a magical cave and sit, holding hands, is a creation of immense beauty.

The acting is superb. Gainsbourg's terror is palpable; Dunst's progressive misery, inescapable. Photography is a bit too shaky for my liking, but it uses that to become intensely intimate. Melancholia itself is awesome.",1475366400,7,2663,5.164733178654292

In the middle of this an impending doom sets on the world and you really get to see the true selves in everyone come out. Bottom line: genius.

Rather than give a synopsis, which every other review does here, I'll tell you the problems I have with the movie.  Please note there are SPOILERS!:......

1.  How did John die?  Was he murdered, kicked by a horse, or did he kill himself knowing about the impending doom?
2.  How was nobody in the wedding party aware of potential appocolyptic even that loomed in just a few short days?  This would be major headline news that people would be aware of before the power went out.
3.  The film's synopsis on Amazon seemed to imply that the planets coming extremely close would induce chaos.  However, aside from Kirsten Dunst's strange behavior, I don't see anything out of place other than a family and associates that do not get along too well.
4.  When a movie is done well, you feel empathy for the other characters, and sometimes you can even imagine yourself in their own shoes and feel fear.  I felt nothing even close to that.
5.  I am not an astronomer, but I know that it's not possible for another planet to intersect with earth's orbit. There are no star systems close enough for this to happen.  Even if we could not see it, it would be detected by the light it blocks from other stars and the gravitational effects of other bodies around it.  Therefore, the entire premise of the film is just absurd.

I believe that the first part of the movie was a look into Kirsten's character's very deluded view of the world brought on by a mental breakdown; possibly caused by her ""knowing"" what was going to happen.  The second half was the real-world view of what was really happening through the eyes of her sister.

3182627,3,B000VSDNF0,"Let's face it!
It's an ART MOVIE!
And art movies are not for everyone, someone's opinion about them is too personal.
I can't tell you ITS THE BEST MOVIE EVER.  I can't tell you ITS A BAD MOVIE, because it's art. We all have different reactions to art. We can stare at the same pairing for the same amount of time and one can be moved to tears and the other sick to their stomach.
It's a personal relationship.
So before you press play know that it is an art movie. You may love it, or you may hate it fiercely. I'm pretty sure both reactions will please the director.

I'm not an art movie buff. I also had no previous knowledge of this director. I only watched it because it kept popping up on my Amazon video app and i just hoped that by watching it it would disappear from there lol

As soon as it starts you realize that it's an art movie. The opening is quite beautifully shot, the music it's intense. If by the first minutes you don't quite get that it is going to be a somewhat different movie from what you are used to, you won't like it.

I personally have mixed feelings about it.
It kept me intrigued to the End but I can't  really say I like it.
There were way too many moments, in my opinion, that made me think ""this makes no sense at all"" and to be completely honest with you it felt like the loooongest 2 hours of my life. I seriously thought it was longer than 2 hours.

I guess art doesn't necessarily need to make sense to everyone. I guess whatever the director's backstory and experiences were that made him make this movie also don't matter much if you are going to call it art.
But for anyone who isn't used to this kind of movie you may not be able to get over the fact that a LOT OF THINGS DONT MAKE SENSE.

There were quite a few scenes that were there just because it was pretty and artsy. For example, showing Kirsten dusts's nipples by the light of a planet on its course to crash into earth....!such a beautifully shot scene. Very artsy indeed. But in the back of my mind I just couldn't get passed the fact that it didn't quite fit in the story and it just seemed like an excuse to put a scene with naked Kirsten in it. .

A lot of other things didn't make sense to me but I can't mention them all without spoiling the whole movie to whomever is reading this

I'm also sure that anyone who has experienced depression directly or indirectly (through family members) can relate to this movie in a deeper level.

Bottom line is I DONT recommend this movie unless you are a fan of the director and of movies like this. Then I am sure you are in for a treat! It is beautiful!

If you have an eclectic movie taste and is curious like me, this is definitely an interesting movie to watch. Liking it or not I'm sure you will be glad you experienced it.
but above all don't listen to reviews that say ""it's an awesome movie"" or ""it's a bad movie"", because this is the kind of movie that will have a different feel for everyone who watches it.",1472774400,12,2964,4.164335664335664

I have to applaud the writer, director and all the fine actors in this film for the excellent light they have shown on our viewpoint of mental illness as perhaps, not an illness at all, but a limited yet valid state of consciousness that the masses have not acknowledged.  There was a time not too long ago that those who suffered from depression, i.e. melancholia, were locked away in institutions.  Now, there is the prison of drugs.  To 'know' things that cannot be seen is a gift, and a burden, and this movie is amazingly creative in depicting the depths of the ignorance of modern society.

If the characters had been likable, then at least one would have a sense of loss at the end.  Instead, the rather unspectacular coup de grace cannot come soon enough.

Even if a metaphor of the two sister planets, not even a glimpse of Kirsten Dunst's bare bosom can compensate for the continual torture that is watching dysfunctional rich people argue about the minutia of their lives.  Perhaps one has to be clinically depressed to identify with any of the characters.  I just don't get it.

Watching this ""movie"" makes one feel as though you are being forced to page through a million spectacular, yet disconnected still pictures.

Trier did not do the camera work as he usually does because he felt unable at the time.  He had gone through a long period of anxiety and depression, a long history of alcohol and different drugs as self medication.  The story he wrote is genius.

A lavish affair that is dampened by 'Justine's' apparent dis-interest in the expensive cellabration put together on her behalf.
Meanwhile the planet 'Melancholia' which has broken away from it's distant orbit is growing larger in the sky.
The second part is 'CLAIR' which tells the tale of the fall out following sister 'Justine's' wedding cellabration and husband's 'John's' fascination with the ever larger planet in the sky assuring his wife that the two planets will not collide.
Must admit this was one of the strangest films i've seen for for a long time, for me it shouldn't have worked, however the truth is i was totally pulled in....................strangely worth a spin.",1440288000,,934,5.3175675675675675
3182855,4,B000VSDNF0,"Dont believe the title. There is no melancholia in this woman on the front page. Dont believe the Ophelia looking front page with Justine floating in water in her wedding dress holding lily-in-the-valley, a whole bunch of them. There is no Ophelia, no suicide by drowning and no flowers floating on top of the water. Justine is not going to go to a nunnery, the nunnery of the dead, at least not what Hamlet and Shakespeare had in mind.

You will discover as soon as you get into the film beyond the title page that we are dealing with the end of the world set in parallel with the end of celibacy for Justine. She cannot accept her personal perspective because of what has been announced and is coming: the planet Melancholia is going to ram into the Earth. There cannot be any enjoyment while it lasts because lasting should mean there is no end decreed even before it starts, and obviously there is an imminent announced foreseen end.

So the little (though super rich, but the richer the more little) people at that wedding reveal how little they can be while they are forgetting it is one of their very last days.

The mother is obnoxious and ridiculously anti-marriage and anti-husband, particularly hostile to her ex-husband that refused to be dominated into silence.

The father is secretive, more than strange and absolutely selfish meaning he is not able to think beyond his own mental limits and they are quite narrow.

The sister Claire is the only sane person and yet she will yield to insanity when the end is coming. Sane people are only behaving like sane people, as sane people, but as soon as conditions get insane they are also getting insane because they are just copying what is normal at any time in their society. And yet at the last minute just before Melancholia crashes into the Earth she will get back to some sane peace and quiet, thanks to her own sister, Aunt Steelbreaker.

Claires husband, John, is entirely preaching what he knows is not true. He knows there is a margin of error in any calculation and that his own calculations that make Melancholia fly by have a fair chance to be wrong especially since everyone else or nearly says it will crash into the Earth. Actually he is a coward who will see before others the imminent ending and will steal his own wifes poison to leave life before the meeting of the two planets.

Justines newly-wed husband Michael is just a non-entity who loves, in fact desires, Justine and leaves her as soon as he understands she is beyond domination. For him love is submission both ways except that the husband only submits for his own pleasure and enjoyment. And he has little more to say.

I won't say anything about Justines boss: he is the biggest business non-imaginative non-entity that I hope you will never have to come across in life and after life.

So we are back with Justine, depressed by what is coming, always depressed because of a domineering and vain mother who hated anyone but herself and deserted her daughters to only come back once in a while to insult them. She is also depressed because of the evanescent and always absent father who cannot even find five minutes to have a personal word with his daughter on her wedding day. And she is the creative one who will be able to invent some fable about a magic cave that will create peace and bring quiet to her nephew Leo, her sister Claire and herself for the last fifteen minutes of their life.

We are back with Claire who is the sound and safe one in life but also the realist in danger and in a crisis, which makes her buy some poison before the end if it has to come to an end. Like all these people who have their feet well anchored in and not on the earth she is not able to face a real existential crisis in her own life but she is the best empathetic help anyone can find in their own existential crises. And when the end comes it is the sound sister that needs the help of the depressive one.

And we have Leo, Claires son and Justines nephew. He is a child, innocent and gullible, afraid of nothing because he has never seen death and suffering and torturing and cruelty face to face, one on one,  in personal confrontation. When such an event comes he is curious to see it and he believes the soft and smoothening tale of his aunt, Aunt Steelbreaker, who makes him build the skeleton of an Indian Tepee and makes him accept this is a magic cave in which no danger can reach him or anyone with him and he closes his eyes and finds the peace necessary to reach the end of the road without the slightest jolt. He is hypnotized in a way, one of Mars von  Triers favorite device.

When I have said that I have said nothing about the meaning of the film. I have simply repeated, summarize, given a gloss of the factual surface of the film, nothing but spoilers. But what is the meaning?

Here we come across Lars von Trier who has forgotten his provocative and absurd dictum and pronunciamento in his Vow of Chastity that was nothing but a dogmatic fundamentalistic Dogma 95. Everything in this film is fake, unreal, artificial, using all sorts of artifices and special effects including the special effects of the story itself that is supposed to blind the audience and make them believe we are dealing with normal though completely berserk people but berserk because the circumstances are exceptional. And what is so exceptional in it?

In 2011 when the world was falling head first in the worst financial crisis since 1929 (that brought Hitler and the Nazis Lars Von Trier loves-hates so much), when the first signs of the debt crisis in Europe were appearing, when the leadership of the USA was at stake everywhere in the world from China to Iraq with the economic defeat in front of the BRICS and with the military defeat in the Middle East, when nothing was improving and everything was getting worse, he came up with the fable of a cosmic end to the Earth and humanity. To make sure we get the message he does not even look at this cosmic destruction from the point of view of more than four people, first by wrapping up some gathering of the super rich in a wedding party that is a total failure but we can always enjoy the wedding cake and forget about the cosmic end coming soon. And then when we cannot avoid that moment we are locked up in a group of four people, cut from the rest of the world with no telephone, no electricity, no means of communication, no servant even, nothing, all alone.

A crisis of that type cannot in our world be experienced like that. It would necessarily be experienced as a collective drama, a collective panic, a collective epiphany, maybe even a collective salvation. But there is no reference to the billions of people on the Earth, no reference to any ideology, be it religious or non-religious, philosophical or secular, artistic even or poetic, with hardly ten seconds on Google or some Bling like that for some opportunistic info given to us the audience about this Melancholia.

We are manipulated in cold blood and we are not even in any way pushed towards some personal empathy for anyone in the tale, except maybe the horses. The medium is the message and the message is the massage. Good morning, Vietnam, straight from MacLuhans Global Village on Epsilon One Billion, or is it Antares in Scorpius?

Then what is left in that waste land of human desolation? The obsession of death that Lars von Trier cultivates with gusto! His obsession about some kind of catastrophe brought by some kind of agent. Since all man-made catastrophes have failed to produce this end of humanity Lars von Trier wishes with all his heart and not the slightest part of his mind, then he has to come to some more drastic means and that is to use the cosmos as God almighty punishing humanity for its vanity, its cruelty, its absurdity, its folly and insanity.

In other words that film is morbid and is supposed to make us think that there is no hope whatsoever as long as humanity exists. Of course he knows that there is no other life like ours in the cosmos and that our end would not be that drastic for the universe: The Earth is evil. We don't need to grieve for it. Nobody will miss it When I say were alone, were alone. Life is only on Earth and not for long, says Justine. Its obvious when humanity is destroyed no human being will feel sorry for it. How could they since they will be reduced to cosmic dust and powder and back to the super black hole of the big Bang. Good riddance!

3182982,5,B000VSDNF0,"One should be very careful when approaching this film. Otherwise, what is unmistakably one of the finest movies of this decade can rapidly become a tedious sci-fi drama about a strange and annoying bride and the end of the world.

The amount of bad reviews this film has received is all too understandable: it touches a nerve that not only upsets people but really hurts them. This movie is ""dangerous"" (a.k.a. powerful) enough to destabilize; it's the event of the Fall turned into cinematic language.

One has to be able to submit him/herself to fragilization; to open oneself to the monstruous radicality of existence before finally understanding the true beauty of this masterpiece. This is why Justine (played by Kirsten Dunst) annoys us so much.

Her relationship with her sister Claire (interpreted by Charlotte Gainsbourg) is really the key feature of this film. Justine is just about to get married, but something is terribly and painfully wrong with her: she's depressed beyond belief.

She's able to see pure despair and hopelessness behind what others spontaneously see life, pleasure and meaningfulness. It is as if she wears the glasses of truth, where every ideological human formulation is unveiled stupid, random, inconsistent and shallow.

One could say that she personifies what psychoanalysis calls ""the Real"", an eternal, monstruous, abyssal inconsistency within reality (and being) itself. It's precisely this unbearable trauma which Justine painfully personifies.

She's the supreme embodiment of this abyss, and once she publicly displays this trauma, only her sister stands behind her. For Justine's presence is just too traumatic for most people to handle; she's the unspeakable foreign body, what Freud called ""death drive"", an eternal impossibility of self-completion, of self-identification, of life experienced as basically an obscene mistake.

This is also why one should also be very careful with the last minutes of the film (spoilers ahead): once Justine enters that ridiculously improvised and impotent tent, that's not a escape, but rather a passport to acceptance; a small transition ritual which enables whoever enters it the possibility of finally giving up hope and fear; of giving up desire, of no longer caring anymore. To put it short: to overcome existence.

Melancholia (the name of the planet to hit the Earth and exterminate us all) is, in this perspective, the ultimate human redeemer; the one which finally brings us peace. There is also a very specific function for the fact that Wagner's prelude to Tristan und Isolde is playing like that in the background: to assign our deep and final reconciliation with death; a final (and sublime) encounter with the negative abyss within all of us, where every truth is finally unveiled and unbearably experienced.

This is, all at once, a lesson in fine arts, philosophy, psychoanalysis and in human existence and its finitude. This is Von Trier (and cinema) at his/its very best.",1434844800,3,2971,5.251054852320675

Set in a fabulously beautiful castle shot on location in Sweden, visually, this is a treat for the eyes. It is, however, so absolute in it's finality. As one looks in on the lavishly doomed wedding of Justine and Michael, Melancholia, a planet that's found it's way into the solar system, is on a collision course with Earth. Somehow, Justine feels the finality of what this means for humanity and falls into a depression that surprised me at how deep the human mind can close itself. Kiefer Sutherland's John tries to be strong for his son Leo, however, he fails miserably as Melancholia approaches, and he commits suicide. Justine and Leo's Magic Cave shelter them, with Claire as Melancholia's nearness to Earth causes their incineration. If only the end of all mankind could be so poetic and beautiful.

3183128,5,B000VSDNF0,"Melancholia is a stunning masterpiece which depicts the various hellish characteristics of a dysfunctional, co-dependent family. The cold, angry  bitter mother, the emotionally crippled alcoholic father, the desperate need for control by the sister who did all of the right things, (marrying the rich man and maintaining the perfect household) and the desperate love starved main character (Kristen Dunst), sets the stage for a  drama that shows the pain of a dysfunction that leaves everyone empty. Everyone wanted a piece of Kristin until she had nothing left to give. Even her bridegroom would not listen to her. He only wanted sex, and to pretend that everything was alright when she was falling apart.

The perfectionistic married sister seems to be the strong one but when her perfectly ordered world falls apart( because of the ironic end of the world) crazy Kristen  shows herself to be the strong one when she cares for the boy and her sister, by building an imaginary cave that will supposedly save them all, while her sister falls apart. It is symbolic of Kristen's role in life. Making up a fantasy that will appease everyone else, but is a lie.

This movie works on many levels. It isn't really a crisis when the world comes to an end because these characters are in reality, already dead. Everything was a pretense for the view of the world, to hide the pain and emptiness of lives that were not being lived. Dunst always knew this and could handle the harsh truth of death. What she couldn't handle was the lie that everything was normal.

  There are beautiful visual effects and so much symbolism. The death planet was beautiful, and the anti-gravity scenes were spectacular, adding a mystical beauty to death and depicting release from the constraints of life. The music is also poignant and beautiful. Anyone who has ever experienced dysfunctional, co-dependent families will appreciate this movie. It's a must see.",1428796800,2,1934,4.96594427244582

""The energies of our system will decay, the glory of the sun will be dimmed, and the earth, tideless and inert, will no longer tolerate the race which has for a moment disturbed its solitude.  Man will go down into the pit, and all his thoughts will perish.  The uneasy consciousness which in this obscure corner has for a brief space broken the contented silence of the universe, will be at rest.  Matter will know itself no longer.  'Imperishable monuments' and 'immortal deeds', death itself, and love stronger than death, will be as if they had not been.  Nor will anything that is, be better or worse for all that the labor, genius, devotion, and suffering of man have striven through countless ages to effect.""

This highly emotional soundtrack evokes a mood of impending passion and tragedy, which is appropriate for the plot that unfolds. A new bride weds under the looming specter of inevitable planetary destruction due to a collision with Melancholia, a newly discovered planet drawing ever closer to Earth. The groom leaves after the wedding, and the bride faces The End with her sister and nephew. Original and shocking. Somewhat depressing, but thought-provoking. Melancholia is the catalyst and the starring role of this film. Kirsten Dunst (the bride) provides calm insight and commentary as it appears that her sister's perfect world is literally about to explode. Some elements don't make sense (the groom leaving after the wedding, the sister's husband selfishly stealing the suicide pills and leaving his wife and son to deal with The End on their own, the golf cart that magically has power when electricity in cars and homes no longer functions, how Kirsten Dunst's hair goes from gorgeous at the wedding to dry and choppy afterwards).

Every scene is meticulously paced and imaged, lingering where they should, even if you don't want them to. It is a very dark and dreary film, but one whose purpose it is to validate an experience. The planet, aptly named Melancholia, is a representation of the looming yet terrifying nothingness that hovers over the heads of those who deal with depression. It is inescapable, powerful, and destructive. The splitting of the film into two chapters allows us to see things from the viewpoint of depressed Justine and her older, anxious sister, Claire.

3183310,5,B000VSDNF0,"This is a qualified 5 - if I could give it 10 for my own tastes, I would.  That said, for some, buyer beware.  And I guess I'm going to end up addressing my review to people who might rate this movie low because I think you can get more out of it than 1-3 stars when you watch it.

If you like Hollywood films and hate art films, obviously, stay away.  If you like living in certainty, stay away.  But before you do, let me make a small suggestion.

Sometimes being unsettled is good.  Sometimes feeling bad is good - we should be grateful as human beings to feel depth of emotion - be it happiness OR melancholy.

Sometimes you should take a walk.  Take a walk when the weather is great.  But get out there and take a walk in a blizzard, on a really hot day, or in the rain... or on a foggy night, put on headphones, go out for a walk at 1am and listen to old spooky blues records.

The whole POINT of going for a walk instead of staying in your living room where you have everything just the way you like it IS that it is unsettling.

The whole, ""ships are safest in harbor, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT SHIPS ARE FOR"" and neither are you.

So that said, what are you buying into with Melancholia?  You aren't getting entertainment, you're getting art.

I don't think it is about depression per se.  It isn't about ""gee, these people are depressed and what should they do about it.""

I got the distinct impression that Kirsten Dunst's character has some sort of foresight.  Not specific knowledge but she feels intrinsically that something is going to go wrong, thus the dumping of the great advertising job that she is brilliant at, the groom, etc.  It turns out she isn't feeling depressed, she's feeling ACCURATELY.

Which begs the question is depression or melancholy ALWAYS a dysfunction or is it healthy when it is an accurate response to what is going on?  Is cheerfulness, teamwork, ambition, confidence, sick in the wrong context?  This isn't a movie about ""oh gee they're DEPRESSED"" which I see in quite a few 5 star reviews as well as 1 stars.  Dunst makes the right decisions about her life, drops the career, etc because something horrible is coming and can feel that in light of that, it doesn't mean all that much to her - that's symbolically valid within the movie with the rogue planet coming, but it's valid in actual real life.

The fact is, something horrible is going to happen to you.

It is coming for you as you read this, waiting somewhere in your future.

Certainly death, the deaths of those you love, absolutely, but not just death.  It's very likely you'll have your heart broken, lose a good friendship, disappoint yourself, act like a jerk in a way you can never take back, experience the whole gamut of suffering, pain, for yourself and those you love - you will lose things or have horrible things happen or do bad things THAT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE.

Ouch, right?  But so, so very true.

Now, if you want to stay in your living room with everything just so, if walking in the fog at 1am listening to blues records or in the rain, lifting your face to feel it instead of rushing inside sounds insane to you, you are missing out.  And besides, your living room won't ultimately save you.

What do you do when depression is PERFECTLY JUSTIFIED, the most sane thing?  Do you withdraw?  Do you rush out to seek other people?  But what if other people can't help?  How do you, how do others, meet what is most definitely coming?  Sorry but this too is part of the human experience.  You will be more alive, more human, more compassionate to other humans, with that awareness - less human, less alive without.

It's one of those roadtrip/cocktail party questions - what is art?  I'll tell you my definition.  When you sleep, you dream and process the events of your life symbolically.  People kept awake to long start too go kind of batty, can't function well - even if you let them sleep but interrupt only when they start dreaming.  Dreaming is the unconscious processing of being alive - of life's experience.  You have to do it or you'll literally lose your mind.

Art is kind of the same way - it's the semi-conscious processing of human experience of life.  Dreaming and art fulfill kind of the same functions - in the months following WW2, in totally bombed-out Germany, while Berlin was still essentially rubble, what did the people there do in the aftermath, as soon as they had their bare, basic needs met?  Put on plays.  Put little orchestras together and play music.  In the RUBBLE.  Because they needed to.  I suspect we're all a little crazy in this day and age because we instinctively reach for art and get entertainment handed to us instead - sleep instead of dreaming.

So anyway, the movie is beautiful.  I was about to say ""well, it isn't entertainment but it is art"" but I remembered, in the 1800's there was a musical subgenre that specifically would be songs about tragically dead children - seriously that was it - people would show up to the concerts in droves, weep, it'd be very cathartic.  If THAT was entertainment, I suppose Melancholia is entertainment - depressing films, horror films that ACTUALLY horrify as opposed to make you jump due to a loud sudden noise, are cathartic and entertaining in their own right.  Idunno, maybe we in America have a religion that trumps all others and that religion is COMFORT.  That makes me feel uncomfortable, which is why I take walks in bad weather and at bad times and watched Melancholia - to take me out of my comfort zone just a little bit.

And ah... have some compassion for the people you run into in your life that aren't all sparky and upbeat - psychological studies prove that slightly depressed people perceive reality more accurately than upbeat people.  Maybe they're onto something.  Non-melancholy is overrated :)",1424304000,23,5817,4.532180595581172

and moody.
  For much of the movie..it seemed to D ....R......A.......G.....and make no sense.  Mainly I thought the two main women characters were nuts,
and since Melancholia means sad....they certainly played their roles well.  I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone depressed or suicidal.  It could get one weepy and sad.  Another film with dark notes, but one I liked so much better was What Dreams May Come, starring Robin Williams. It explores the afterlife in explicit and haunting detail.  This one explores an impending Extinction Level Event with beauty and haunting style.
  I probably missed the main point.  The trailer suggested that this film would leave one feeling ecstatic.  I wonder what they were smoking???
Not my cup of tea.  But in a way...it was.  I'm unlikely to forget it, but I'm also unlikely to watch it again or recommend it.",1422748800,,1292,4.752252252252252

Kirsten Dunst and Lars's muse Charlotte Gainsbourg are both outstanding.  Melancholia is the perfect title for this movie, as you leave with exactly that feeling, yet still feel richer for having seen it.

Her wedding is taking place and she's acting in a very odd manner.  After watching the film a second time, I totally got what was going on with her. The second part of the movie is mostly about the  second sister and her anxiety about the planet that may or may not hit the earth.

Keiffer Sutherland, as usual, does a great job.  Too bad he wasn't the main character instead.

Here's a hint to watching the movie.  Any time you see the groom on the screen, you can fast forward through that part.  He loves her, I get it.  But after a minute or so that is understood.  It doesn't really take another 45 minutes to convince us.  And he doesn't play any other roll in the movie.

It is kind of like watching actors acting like actors who are kind of acting like people.  Yet there is no script, no direction and none of them have creativity enough to come up with anything interesting for their characters to do.

I admit...  I've only made it to the one hour mark before I started to skip forward a little and give up.  So if it gets better and I missed it, I apologize.  But I doubt that is the case.

The first 15 minutes were in slow motion...literally.  The next 90 minutes must have been directed by a snail...and the mood of this film was totally depressing.  If that's what the creators were aiming at, they won.  But it bored me to death.  Sci-fi films of the 50's were so much better.  Remember ""When Worlds Collide""?  One star is being generous.  Here's my literary take...slow moving, solemn, depressing, no one knows how to smile, lots of wasted footage, horrible soundtrack, the audio was so bad I had turn on the subtitles to understand the script,..bizzare...the wedding would make anyone sick...and she fu--s a guy that she never met after she rejects her husband moments after the wedding?  Kirsten Dunst should be ashamed of this appearance.  I'm convinced she did it to go on screen nude...and the nude scene is horrible.  In fact, I don't believe it was her...it must have been a body double.  There's a 10-minute episode at the very end of the film where her sister walks around asking for ""John""...her husband.  10 minutes????  Avoid at all cost.

After the the first time I saw it this movie has stayed with me. I find myself thinking about it weeks after viewing.
The visuals are spectacular, beautiful and moving. The dialog is sparse, letting the lens tell the story and more importantly assuming that the audience is intelligent enough to understand. What should be lovely and perfect is not, it is uncomfortable at the least. What should be horrific becomes beautiful.  There are other reviews that give an out line of the story. I feel you have to come at this movie with the right frame of mind, maybe feeling a little melancholic or simply in a serious kind of mood. I have seen many reviews that imply that only those with some history of mental illness can truly relate. And yes depression as well as anxiety play a big role in the film, however I think that anyone with a serious mind can understand even if they have not experienced these feelings to the degree that some actors do. I may have experience with some of what Kristen Dunst's character goes through, but I don't think that kind of inside torment is necessary to enjoy the film.  10/2014",1414540800,,1387,4.456692913385827

3183619,3,B000VSDNF0,"I'm a Kirsten Dunst fan, so it's difficult for me to give Melancholia a poor mark, despite a pile of misgivings. Lars von Trier did some fine work here, but it wasn't enough to keep me watching for the duration (I'm saving the 2nd half for a day that may never come). As Melancholia is the antithesis of an action flick, it just felt too long. The first ~5 minutes (very slow motion sequences, etc.) had me worried that the whole film would be the same, so I was relieved when an actual story began (OK, I'll admit it, I fast forwarded to the story).

For those who have the patience, Melancholia provides a glimpse into ""the horror of it all,"" a premonition (or perhaps an actualization) of being trapped in a different flavor of hell. This is a horror film of sorts, cleverly disguised as something else.

What a great cast! Melancholia was my first time around the block with Alexander Skarsgrd outside of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Blood/dp/B00N176ZBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Blood</a>&nbsp;(unfortunately it was difficult for me to forget that he is not a vampire). As for Kiefer Sutherland: I never realized he has such a pointy nose! Maybe age makes noses pointier?

The trouble with Melancholia is that I had little or no empathy with or sympathy for the characters; if you think for even just a second about the global blight of poverty, how can you care about misery among the rich? Melancholia is an extreme example of ""First World problems.""
Anyway, I can't recommend this one unless you're into fart house films... although if you are taking the proper mind-altering substances, it may be just the thing. ",1414195200,,1679,5.050541516245487

3183624,3,B000VSDNF0,"In this beautifully filmed, lethargically paced, obsessively self-indulgent half hour short film interminably padded to fill out an eternity, retired CTU agent Jack Bauer has all the money in the world and an empty life.  He's killed everyone, everywhere, to make the world safe from terrorism.  And now he has no one to play with.  So he buys a huge dollhouse, a bunch of lifesize dolls and has a mock wedding.  It doesn't go well.  The dolls are sentient but soulless and, recognizing their own kind, don't like each other.

Jack Bauer's wifedoll is wired a little too tight and her porcelain exterior is about to crack.  He tries to marry off his sister in law, but during the wedding she realizes that she's little more than a tagline for a new line of lifesize dolls.  Her circuits blown, she becomes catatonic and goes to live with Jack Bauer and his wifedoll and their gingerbread boy.  Sisterdoll takes barebreasted moontans, which earns actress Kristen Dunst accolades from European movie fans who love barebreasted moontans and don't care that Dunst's acting covers the gamut from Barbie to Skipper.

Jack Bauer looks through a telescope and discovers he's very depressed because he killed everyone in the entire world to keep us safe from the terrorists.  His depression is looming larger and larger and takes the shape of a giant blue pill which he swallows.  He then falls asleep with the horses.  His wifedoll sensibly covers him with hay.

Wifedoll wants to sit on the veranda drinking wine and singing Beethoven's 9th while waiting for the giant blue sleeping pill to arrive, but Sisterdoll says no that's boring let's build a teepee instead.  So Sisterdoll and Gingerbread Boy build a teepee, except they only build the frame and omit the buffalo hides so they can see the giant blue pill.  And Sisterdoll and Wifedoll and Gingerbread Boy sit in the teepee and wait for the giant blue sleeping pill.

Three stars, because the cinematography is gorgeous. But next time I need a good leisurely paced sleepytime movie, I'll rewatch ""Let The Right One In"", or ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"", which are thoroughly satisfying movies with actual stories rather than a sequence of waking dreamtime events from a writer/director's journal of his bouts with depression.",1413331200,,2306,4.917312661498708

3183672,4,B000VSDNF0,"MELANCHOLIA is the kind of movie that will generate extreme feelings either way: viewers either love it or hate it.  For anyone who has experienced depression or panic, or any form of mental illness, however, Lars von Trier's work will strike an answering chord.  The opening sequence sets the tone, as we see Justine (Kirsten Dunst) in a surreal world, with the music from Wagner's TRISTAN AND ISOLDE striking great aural waves in the background.  The Wagnerian references are significant: we are transported into an elemental world in which the acts of ""knowing"" and ""unknowing"" assume particular significance.

MELANCHOLIA offers some trenchant comments about depression: even though it is perceived as a 'disorder' in most societies, it can confer an incredible calm on sufferers.  This is certainly the case with Justine, whose serene demeanor contrasts starkly with that of her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg).  As the two of them prepare for the inevitable strike by the planet Melancholia (a physical manifestation of a mental state), their behavior significant: Justine builds a makeshift structure which she claims will protect them from the catastrophe to come (even though it doesn't), while Claire tries vainly to escape with her son Leo (Cameron Spurr) but finds no way out.  How can there be?  Even though sufferers are often told to ""snap out"" of their depression, it's obvious that they can't.  They are mentally imprisoned, just like Claire seems to be physically imprisoned.

Lars von Trier's camerawork seems particularly suitable for this type of film.  Mostly shot with a handheld camera that most restlessly around the actors, unable to keep still for any length of time, it suggests a world of uncertainties, one where no one knows what will really happen next.  Claire's wife John (Keifer Sutherland) tries his best to assume an air of quiet authority over the proceedings, as he continually reassures his spouse that nothing will come of them, even if Melancholia does strike; but we know that his efforts are doomed.  This is a harsh, unfeeling world over which human beings have little or no control, despite their attempts to colonize it - through the use of a telescope or a makeshift device made of wire.  The only way to cope with it is to encounter it head-on, whatever the consequences.

In this topsy-turvy, elemental world, Justine comes across as the most capable person, despite the fact that, for everyone else in the film (especially the guests at her wedding-feast), she is perceived as ""ill.""  She is the only person who admits to her state of mind, and alters her behavior to suit that state of mind.  She might seem 'deviant' or 'odd' - especially in one sequence where she lies naked on a rock, her pale torso illuminated by the planet's rays - but she knows how to make sense of her life.  MELANCHOLIA encourages us to question our definitions of 'madness' and 'sanity,' as well as providing a profound insight into the world of the depressive.  A unique experience.",1410912000,,3017,4.998

3183674,3,B000VSDNF0,"I've watched many a movie that I've enjoyed and appreciated more than 'Melancholia...' but why does this film haunt me? It's not particularly likeable and there are sections of it that elicit a 'c'mon, just end this and go on to the next scene,' but it is intriguing and you'll find yourself thinking about it at the strangest times. And when you try to describe it to someone who has not seen it you get the 'uh huh...sounds awful,' reaction more often than not.

But here you have the story of newlyweds Justine and Michael and as 'Melancholia' begins you really like this young couple as they take in stride their humongous limo attempting to navigate a hair-pin turn as it carries them to the venue for their reception, the very lavish estate (owned by the bride's sister and brother-in-law, a couple with issues too numerous to mention...) and they are very, very late. And then you take in that there is no bridal party, no best man and no maid/matron of honor sharing the cavernous limo. Just the bride and groom.

Arriving at the reception things rapidly deteriorate. There are secrets regarding Justine's mental fragility, the bride's parents are present and not at all reluctant to reveal their mutual hatred, and Justine's brother-in-law John (Keifer Sutherland at his least likeable) frequently snorts 'unbelievable' as Justine's frail hold on the situation unravels.

So after the shortest marriage ever, the story moves to the real problem at hand: the wayward planet Melancholia that is on a collision course with Earth. Or is it? So with a bit of foreshadowing and insight, we see that scientist John is convinced that the planet will pass over Earth and the resulting event will be the Best. Thing. Ever. The latter part of the film focuses on how different members of the family embrace the possibility of world's end.

I will say the acting is amazing: Kirsten Dunst is a seriously overlooked actress. There's much more to this young lady than 'Spiderman' movies.

So this will not be my go to movie when I feel like popping something in and putting my mind on hold for 120 minutes. But it's a movie that is just kind of stuck in my brain.",1410480000,,2158,4.7287234042553195

3183709,4,B000VSDNF0,"Kirsten Dunst plays a melancholic girl on her wedding day. She and her groom are in a limo trying to get to their wedding reception, but the path is narrow and curvy and the limo simply can't get through. They arrive 2 hours late. When they arrive, Kirsten looks up and comments on a red star that she says she has never seen before. In response, her sister informs her of how rude her late arrival is. Immediately we get to see how incredibly messed up Kristen's character's family is. Her father appears to be a bit immature and unreliable, drinking a bit much and playing childish pranks on the waiters. Her mother is a bitter, selfish, control-freak who takes over the father's speech in order to blast marriage in general and to tell everyone how much she despises the entire concept of ""till death do us part"" and all that sort of thing. Kirsten's character and her sister simply sit and endure their mother's narcissistic abuse, as they are accustomed to it. Kirsten tries to smile and be nice throughout the reception, but gradually the smiles are less and less and we begin to see a darkness creeping over her.

Kirsten's depression grows deeper, with her repeatedly disappearing from the reception for long periods of time to be by herself. Eventually she and her new husband are in the bedroom. He is clearly ready to enjoy their honeymoon and consummate the marriage. But she is brooding, says she doesn't want to and leaves the room. She wanders outside and climbs into a golf cart which she drives far out into the 18-hole golf course that surrounds the mansion where the reception is being held. It is her sister's husband's house and he repeatedly expresses how rich he is and how much he has spent on the reception. Kirsten's wedding dress hangs on the pedals of the golf cart as she climbs out. So she just rips it loose and walks on, unconcerned.

There is a long series of events showing how depressed Kirsten is, how dysfunctional her parents are, and how hard her sister is trying to hold everything together and make nice. The groom, who had been trying throughout the film to cheer Kirsten up and deal with her depression as best as he could, gives up and leaves her after the bedroom scene.

Kirsten's depression grows severe. Her sister invites her to come and stay at their house so they can help her through it. Her sister's husband, played by Kiefer Sutherland, is openly unsympathetic to Kirsten. His focus is primarily on his money and his love of science. At the moment his passion for science is focused on astronomy and a rogue planet that is supposed to ""fly by"" the Earth in a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Kirsten's sister says she is uncomfortable with this whole thing and Kiefer warns her to stop looking it up on the internet because she keeps upsetting herself after reading posts by doomsday prophets who insist it is going to be the end of the world. About this time the planet is visible in the daylight sky, although it is small.

The story continues with Kirsten's sister trying to cheer her up. They go horseback riding and Kirsten seems happier, at least until her horse refuses to cross a particular bridge. Kirsten had talked early in the film about how no one but she could ride that horse and how much she loved it. But when the horse refuses to cross the bridge Kirsten beats the crap out of it with her riding crop. The horse is so frustrated that it literally sits down on the ground with her still on its back rather than go on. Kirsten's sister has to grab the riding crop out of Kirsten's hand to stop her from beating it more.

Meanwhile, the planet grows larger in the sky. Kiefer Sutherland helps his son make a metal loop that everyone can use to measure when the planet, named ""Melancholia"", is growing closer and when it is moving farther away.  Around this time the planet is close enough to earth that it interferes with some of earth's electrical activity. Kirsten's sister shows increasing fear of the planet despite her husband's assurances that scientists have predicted it will pass harmlessly by the earth. She goes to a computer and looks up a report showing that the planet Melancholia will brush past the earth, loop around the Sun, and then come right back and smack in the earth. As she is printing the diagram of the planet's predicted path, the power cuts out. The planet's nearness to earth has interfered with all electrical activity planet-wide. Kiefer says this was expected and that the power will be out for a few days. He reassures his wife once more that it is all going to work out fine. But later that day Kirsten sees Kiefer unloading survival goods from his truck and hiding them in the barn. He warns Kirsten not to tell her sister because it would only upset her.

I know some of the reviewers here have told you how the film ends, but I'm not going to. I think you should watch it.

Some call Melancholia 'slow' and a 'bore', specifically Part One. This is clearly not the type of movie they would enjoy. As for you, consider a film in which characters who have been completely fleshed out (off screen, mind you) interact with one another. With a few of them comes baggage and unresolved issues. Part One is an exploration of human interaction--the kind that remains behind closed doors--while Part Two is a journey into people's reactions to sudden events as well as their handling of them. Does this sound like something you would enjoy? If not, carry on. Melancholia has enough negative reviews as it is.

I'm glad I didn't know much about it -- the story, the characters -- before I saw it because I love the way it caught me off-guard. And so I would hesitate to spill too many beans in advance. Superficially, the movie is about a wedding reception that goes completely awry, about a clinically depressed woman who is losing the battle for her mind and, lest we forget, the movie may also be about the end of the world. Even if the film confounds you & frustrates you at times, it may sneak into your soul -- and in ways that words alone cannot express. It's the kind of movie you'll love arguing about with friends afterward.  Finally there's the performance of Kirsten Dunst as the battered bride; it is fascinating and beautiful, unrelenting yet full of shadings and subtleties. I usually don't have much patience with "" artsy"" movies but this one -- directed by the brooding Swede Lars Von Trier -- defies any attempt at categorization. The Blu Ray quality is impeccable-- especially the rumbling/soaring musical soundtrack, some of it by R Wagner. Yeah, the German opera guy. ""Melancholia"" is a profound experience and just calling it a great film may understate its power.  I ENJOYEDTHIS MOVIE MORE THE 2ND TIME & EVEN MORE THE 3RD.

Performances by Charlotte Gainsbourg, Kirsten Dunst, and Kiefer Sutherland are outstanding.  Charlotte, in particular, should have received an Oscar nomination for this.

To me, the film is in two distinct parts.  The first half is nearly inscrutable on its own, but you must immerse yourself in it.  It is only when we get to the second half that we may begin to piece together what had already happened, what the characters have come to understand, and what looms ahead.

This film is not an action/adventure.  (You should not be in a ""hurry up and entertain me"" mood while watching.)  It is a film meant to be experienced, a gradual crescendo moving toward a climax that occurs at the very end.  The last moments of the film are cataclysmic, emotionally.  Its conceit has never been realized so well.  You will be thinking about the film all the following day.

3183892,5,B000VSDNF0,"Nine Things about the Movie Melancholia [Denmark, 2011]

1. This extraordinary film is the second in director Lars von Triers Depression Trilogy, after Antichrist. Its not a sequel, it is a companion film. It examines similar themes, although this time in a science fiction genre. This movie is not as extreme as Antichrist, and is easier to understand. But that doesnt mean this movie is a walk in the park. After all, it is Lars von Trier.

2. Von Trier wrote the movie based on a depressive episode he actually had, and the insight that depressed people tend to be more calm in situations of high pressure - because they are already prepared for the worst result.

3. The opening sequence of the film is a breathtakingly beautiful, surreal montage of scenes that represent themes explained during the course of the film. These scenes are juxtaposed with images of the destruction of the Earth as another planet collides into it.

4. The first half of the movie takes place at a wedding reception for Justine and Michael at a secluded country estate. The reception slowly unravels, partly because so many attendees make the evening about themselves. But the main problem is that Justine suffers from a debilitating depression, and is unable to hold herself together.

5. The second half of the movie takes place at the same country estate, shortly after the wedding. Justine is living there with her sister Claire and Claires family. A rogue planet, aptly named Melancholia, is making a near approach to Earth.

6. Claire is terrified that the planet will hit Earth. Her husband tries to convince her that the planet will miss Earth. Justine is calm in her knowledge that Melancholia will actually destroy our planet.

7. Charlotte Gainsbourg, who starred in Antichrist, plays Claire here. Her two roles in these movies make fascinating counterpoints. Kirsten Dunst almost burns a hole through the screen in her portrayal of Justine. It might be her best performance ever.

8. Von Trier wasn't concerned with making the collision of the two planets scientifically realistic - his point was to illustrate the behavior of the human psyche under extreme circumstances.

9. This movie is a gorgeous, intimate apocalypse. Von Trier is telling us that whether its a brain problem or a cosmic one, we are all alone in this universe. Nothing we do ultimately matters, and were all helpless to control our own fate. We are just thrown around by forces greater than us until we die. But its still beautiful.

If thats not a message you want to hear, then you should stay away from this movie.",1402617600,2,2584,4.8522727272727275
3183893,1,B000VSDNF0,"well this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the whole family is heavily emotionaly disturbed the writer and director are as well,  to make a movie like this ... stay away from it it is a unGodly movie promoting depression anxiety hopelessness loneliness and animal abuse she beats up a innocent horse... this is just the type of movie satan loves and would love for you to watch !!!!!!  keep your children far  away from it and just say no !",1402272000,4,451,4.2823529411764705
3183894,4,B000VSDNF0,"Kristin Dunst expresses the self destructive aspect of depression well. She ruined the happiest day of her life. Marriage and a big promotion surrounded by family and friends. Or did she? As the movie unravels, we find out she was suffering from a crushing depression. Why? Depression is the most mysterious and spiritual of illnesses. Terrible but a gift more often than not. Contemp psychology posits many valid theories which contribute to it. They all tell part of the story. This movie suggests another part. A spiritual accumulation of selfishness, emptiness, lack of meaning, lack of value and lack of connection on a global scale. Perhaps suggesting, we all inhale psychically from the spiritual 'air' of the world. Of a collective consciousness. Of the intent behind random interactions. Of other's thoughts directed toward us. Of our thoughts directed toward them. Of slights, accumulated grievances, unresolved fights, etc Perhaps there is a global mood of which we all partake to some degree. When combined with personal 'evils' it resonates and coagulates into something dark, chronic and foreboding. A gray cloud that refuses to go away. Like air pollution. Spiritual energy works similarly. It sounds archaic but many cultures who were more communally and spiritually connected have posited similar narratives along these lines. Depression often does not make entire sense in its context. With the stories we tell in psychologists offices. They always fall short in explaining why. Its only when we expand our view and realize the spiritual matrix we are all ensconced in that it begins to make sense.",1402012800,,1616,5.243243243243243
3183895,1,B000VSDNF0,"I read all the glowing reviews and decided to give it a shot. There is another 1 star review here that currently has 80+ helpful votes. I wish I paid more attention to that one; it is pretty much dead-on.

From the reviews, I understood going in that the director was trying to make the point that depressed people sometimes handle hopeless situations better. That point could've been made faster, better, and more interesting. Most of the characters are entirely one dimensional; and there were none that I really cared for other than the little boy. As a result, when the end came I wasn't sad that everyone died, nor did I feel bad for their predicament. I wanted to kill them myself.

I'm not impressed by lavish imagery without a story; I can buy photographers magazines if I want to see pretty pictures. I'm also not impressed with character studies that don't give me characters to care about. It's just boring.

The best contrast I can think of is the 1980 movie ""Ordinary People"". An amazing movie that studies the effects of depression, but you actually care about it. And it's interesting. Nothing like this.",1401494400,4,1119,4.698979591836735

3183931,4,B000VSDNF0,"AN EXTREMELY complex exploration of two sisters - Justine [Dunst] and Claire [Gainsbourg].  The first section covers Justines wedding day.  It's literally a story book wedding - but slowly we see how everything unravels and 'the myth of togetherness' falls apart leaving Justine isolated - alone.  Part # 2 ""Claire"" shows her slow recovery under her sisters care - concurrent with all of that is the approach of the mega-planet Melancholia ......which may or may not 'spare' earth.

Performances overall are excellent especially Dunst and Gainsbourg [who has wisely shunned commercial, selecting her projects with great care ... she's a fine actress with tremendous potential].  Dunst and Gainsbourg work well together - and a future pairing would be very welcome  [they're naturally starkly different and it's this difference that makes them fascinating to watch on screen].

Dunst has really come along way since her ""Jumanji"" days!  Kiefer Sutherland [as Claire's husband]; the legendary Charlotte Rampling [as the cynical and realistic mother of the girls], John Hurt [as the estranged father] and the rest of the stellar cast give excellent support.  Tech credits are perfect and the Costume, Art Direction/Production Design appropriately compliment this project.

They look for shock value and that's what they expected of  this film. Well this film does not ride on that wave. So does does this mean that this is not a very good Lars von Trier film? Absolutely not instead it has incredible performances by the entire cast. And I find the plot of this film to be one of the most important themes he has ever dealt with in any of his films. Visually just as if not better than his past works. The lovely Charlotte Gainsbourg gives one of her most tender and humanistic performances of her career in this film. And Kiersten Dunst blew me away with her performance as you have never seen her play before. Her very well executed performance relies on very little dialogue and uses very deadpan expressions that carries her throughout the whole film with such complexity. I have been following Lars von Triers career since he worked on television in his native Copenhagen blowing me away on his haunting hospital Epic, The Kingdom, which typically America stole and Stephen King made his own American failure of the version. But this was the beginning of his career and I've vowed that I would always support what he does. Is Melancholia  as good as Antichrist or Nymphomaniac? Well I can say is Melancholia is neither of those films. But just as good if not better. The public is to stop expecting what Lars is supposed to make and appreciate the diversity of his subject matter. He's one of the hardest working film directors in the history of film. watch this film and don't think about his other films and I guarantee you you will grade this film higher than 90% of the films you've seen in the past decade at least.

3183978,5,B000VSDNF0,"Each person is totally entitled to her/his opinion, no one is forced to like some film, music or art. On the contrary, if strong dislike is what one feels or thinks, it's perfectly OK. But reading many one star reviews, just like another reviewer stated, they say more about the reviewer than the movie itself...I was amused by the one who said that the movie's only quality is Kirsten Dunst breasts.

Melancholia presents 2 depressed main characters within a science fiction background. There is no conscious choice from the filmmaker or script for the viewer to like these characters, they are just who they are; likewise, for science fiction fans, there is no explanation about the new planet approaching, it's just approaching.

We have an 8 minute introduction, no narration, no dialogue, only a dreamlike sequence depicting the events that will develop and uses the prelude of Tristan und Isolde; this music is the only one throughout the whole movie, at first it may sound repetitive, but it's so beautiful and its applied in key moments so this does not matter at the end. The first part is dedicated to Justine, a bride who is not sure about her commitment and who suffers severe depression. This first half is basically a drama, the only information about the menacing planet is that there is a new bright star in the constellation Scorpio.
I must mention about the frequently used term ""character development"". For many casual reviewers the main problem of many films is the lack of ""character development""; perhaps they think this 'development' consists that the viewer must know almost everything about the main protagonists, where they come from, what are their motivations or their drive, goals, etc.. I believe this is a misconception. For me, character development is simply that the viewer understands the characters regardless of the knowledge about them. During the first part of Melancholia I knew when I needed that Justine's boss is a pig, her sister Claire is psychorigid and the groom is deeply in love but weak. I didn't need a lot of dialogue and exposition to know that, one just knows as the celebratory events unfold.

The second half is about Claire and now the planet Melancholia is mentioned as a possible menace, there are no TV news clips or people panicking in cities as in a summer blockbuster movie, only apprehension about the situation. What else should one feel about the possibility the world will end in the next few days? Electricity is gone and the only means of information is a telescope and the planet getting bigger in the sky. Justine, who had an emotional breakdown before clears a bit her mind (surely she just wanted to die anyway and planet Melancholia will be just fine for her) and now the role reverses with Claire who begins to fall apart. The final scene is daunting.

Now, being a sci-fi fan I must also comment about the science fiction quality of this film. Of course, this movie is so much closer to hard sci-fi, particularly, Solaris. There's even a painting shown in the introduction that looks so much as one used in a scene in Solaris. Melancholia's two sisters set of mind is practically the same from the main couple in Solaris (both original and the 2002 remake). About the science, the planet just comes quickly from behind of the Sun, I assume for some reason it was not detected before, so it's a surprise; of course, such a planet would alter with anticipation gravitational forces in the Solar System and therefore planets' orbits, but director Lars Von Trier is not concerned about these details, the new planet is just a device for the human drama and his vision to develop.
 The special FX scenes are well done and as I commented before, the final scene is unnerving, majestic and even tragically sad, how Claire and Justine join and share the final instant of not only their lives, but the world's. Just the few seconds before the end of the world (and the movie), the view and sound is quite impressive.

Acting is fine from all involved and Dunst portrays her role convincingly. About the camera movement, I had no problem at all, it's just a style of filmmaking and not taken to the extreme as in movies like Cloverfield or Blair Witch Project.

Amidst too many pointless movies in every genre (even science fiction) that the gargantuan movie giant industry spits each year, Melancholia is like a refreshing but cool breeze, that feels nice if you have the patience to stand in it for a while and contemplate.",1398556800,4,4491,4.779639175257732

I didn't think that a film like this could be convincingly made, but director Lars Von Trier pulled it off in my opinion, with a film ending that was stunning and emotional.  The acting of Kirsten Dunst, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Kiefer Sutherland were first rate and the soundtrack captured the mood perfectly.

I personally didn't feel like the film had any negatives but as a warning the portrayal of the severe depression of the main character may be too intense or discomfiting to some viewers.  The film also has a running time of 2hours 15minutes and is very deliberately paced.",1398038400,3,765,4.953125

3184023,1,B000VSDNF0,"This is the most excruciatingly boring film I have ever seen in my life. I kept waiting for the good part, but they payoff never came. Cheaply made. They shot the whole thing in one house. The scene never changes. But they slapped lots of corny ""vintage"" photoshop-y effects all over it, so it's like, artsy or something I guess? Who cares. Do yourself a favor and watch paint dry instead.

Now, maybe you think I'm some bro'd-out neanderthal who's mad because Kirsten Dunst didn't turn into a Transformer robot and shoot up the place with lasers or something, and that YOU would love it because you're such a sensitive soul with a real eye for the beautiful things in this lonely life. WRONG. WRONG. I love well-wrought artsy films. This is just not one of them. It's a pretentious, self-impressed movie with open disdain for its viewers. ""If you don't appreciate this, you simply haven't any taste at all,"" the palpably heavy hand of the director sneers, as you wander out of the room pretending to need another glass of water for the third time.

To answer a claim made by other reviewers: Kirsten Dunst's character is not some touching, vividly-rendered portrait of depression's horrible effects. She's a two-dimensional caricature, a classic manic pixie dream girl. She drifts around frowning at everything, being sad about everything, and never doing anything. Not only is that a reductive portrayal of depression, it's B-O-R-I-N-G. Her character is completely flat. She never changes. She never learns. She doesn't grow. She's just a mopey lump. I mean, I have struggled with depression but I didn't empathize with her character at all. I wanted to smack her across the face with a dead fish and say ""WAKE UP KIRSTEN DUNST! THE ENTIRE WORLD IS ABOUT TO END. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED. DON'T YOU CARE? DOESN'T ANYBODY CARE? SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING. THIS ISN'T A DREAM."" I mean, doesn't a film have SOME responsibility to entertain its viewers, like, just a little, tiny bit?

Oh, at the end of the movie, a giant planet smashes into Earth and everyone dies, so everything they did was pointless. Except, you don't get to see the collision, because animating the special effects beyond showing a giant disc in the sky would have cost too much money. There, I ruined it for you, okay?

Sign of director and actor being on same page, whoever, or whatever (script), might be most responsible for the performance. And Keiffer Sutherland and Kirsten Dunst are both really good in this film. Dunst has always been a kind of poor woman's Jennifer Jason Leigh, here she establishes her own chops. Charlotte Rampling also lets it out. Gainesburg very good too.

Another thing that wins points for me is an intelligent filmmaker being allowed to riff.

3184106,5,B000VSDNF0,"A lot of the reviews here that are one star are very troubling.  I'm reminded of the people who reportedly walked out of the theaters during Tree of Life, or Twilight fans posting book reviews of Stoker's Dracula or Tess of the d'Urbervilles (that was mentioned so frequently by the author of Twilight).

I get it.  The movie is slow paced.  I get it.  The science fiction is a mere backdrop rather than the focus.

But the movie is meant to explore an emotion, not merely state it.  It explores how severe depression really is.  It explores how those without depression react to tragedy and how those with it become numb to stress and tragedy.  It is slowly paced - but it does so to bring you to an emotional realization.

There's nothing wrong with movies that are action and more highly paced in their drama.  But, for me, Melancholia - along with other incredibly cerebral science fiction like the Her or the UK televsion series, Black Mirror, are these scifi pieces that are really upping the game as far as art goes.  Too often is science fiction just the window dressing for dumb action movies.  Too often do supposedly adult drama mean to do nothing but over stimulate you and sell you a soap opera story.

Very rarely does a piece get so intimate, require you to reflect upon the people and their situation without jarring you to the next situation and the next and the next.  In a world where society must constantly be forced to be over stimulated, this asks you to slow down to explore this one thing.

And frankly - the one star reviews here say more about the reviewers, than they do the movie.

The shooting locations and the capturing of them are just absolutely gorgeous, it's incredibly well acted and  the prelude to Richard Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde set the tone of the film perfectly.  My one petty complaint, is the naming of the planet.  The movie is aptly titled - but there was no real reason to actually name the planet crashing into earth that very thing.

The psychological story being told is fairly riveting. The creator looks at power differentials between individuals during varying situations. How do people behave when they feel secure? How do they behave when they feel threatened? How do they behave when they absolutely know there's no escape from universal disaster? How long does it take for people to admit that a disaster truly is inescapable and universal? How can universal disaster provide anyone with the impetus to sanity and regained personal power? How much pure mayhem does it take to break through the shell of indifference modern people construct to protect themselves from both too much signal and too much noise?

I read reviews when the film was in theaters and knew I was interested, yet after it was released in DVD, I let it sit on my wish list for months; then it sat on our shelf unwatched for as long.  It was worth the wait for the right moment, as it is a film you have to be ready to let in.
  I should also say that Kirsten Dunst's performance is phenomenal.  In this, she reveals deep emotional storms within her character, while keeping her performance fully reined in.  Impressive.

It has obviously been extremely informed by the director's own bouts with major depression, and it is almost a textbook lesson to those who are uninflicted with mental illness of its devastating effect. Those with mental illness live within their heads and their skins, the outside world hardly touches them. A scene  like a marriage where everyone should be happy only reinforces the disfunctionality of a character like Justine. But when outside forces threaten the healthy, the same threat can seem like sweet relief to the depressed.

3184288,4,B000VSDNF0,"This is one of those movies that you will probably love or hate.  Since I routinely come across movies that I love and other people can't stand; or movies that I believe are the worst ever and others genuinely appreciate, I will relay a different type of review that I feel might give you a better perspective on what to expect with Melancholia.

First off, let me say this...I believe that just about everyone would agree that the music and cinematography are exceptional.  However, that obviously is not all that makes a movie.  So here goes. (I won't include any spoilers, btw.)

Melancholia is primarily about two sisters and how they relate to one another and to others in the face of the possible destruction of the planet.  This is not, I repeat NOT a science fiction film.  If you are expecting a wild element of sci-fi excitement there is only a small touch of that, although the effects are more than adequate.  This is a movie that takes its time exploring the relationships the two sisters have while revealing the depths and ever-changing energy of a person suffering from depression.

Kirsten Dunst plays the role of Justine, a young woman suffering from melancholia (a fairly antiquated term for depression).  Her sister Claire, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, takes it upon herself to watch over her and defend her from the repercussions of her actions, as well as those of others in response to her illness.  As in real life, depression often runs in the family and their mother, Gaby, (Charlotte Rampling) obviously suffers issues of her own.  This circumstance results in some of the best acting you will see, as Dunst and Gainsbourg very convincingly behave as though they have lived most of their lives together, dealing with the challenges of life and responding in their own, unique way.

And now comes the hard part.  Is this movie any good?  I'll take it from two different angles.

Have you ever been in an art museum and quietly reflected upon a painting that struck you as sad or dark, yet beautiful?  Did you sit there patiently and let it soak into your soul....absorbing the melancholy the artist must have felt when creating it?  If so, you will probably love this movie.  The title of the movie is appropriate not just because it is a term for Justine's illness or because the rogue planet is named Melancholia, but also because it captures the actual feeling of melancholy.  Just as a quality impressionist painting transmits the mood and feeling of a particular scene rather than how life-like it looks, this movie is a moving work of art that requires you to let your guard down and allow yourself to become part of the beautiful sadness and enjoy it as you did in front of that painting.

Do you typically guess at what is to come at a movie?  Do you try to figure them out as you are watching them and feel uncomfortable with slow scenes that do not appear to be advancing a plot?  If so, there is nothing wrong with that, but you will probably not like this one.

Looking for action?...not your flick.  Looking for romance?...sorry.  How about the good ole ""shaky camera"" trick?  There is a lot of that in here and I hate the shaky camera.  But I have to admit that I really enjoyed it in spite of that.  (way too much shaky camera if you ask me...WAY too much).

The bottom line here is this...if you had a hard week at work and need to see a movie that excites you without much thinking about it, or conversely, you are looking for something that challenges your brain to figure it out and exercise your skills in logic, or anything in between, you may not enjoy this too much.  This movie falls completely outside that linear line.  Melancholia is all about experiencing, and ever so patiently enjoying the under-appreciated feeling of wonder, beauty, and uniquely satisfying sadness...of melancholy.",1387238400,,3842,4.679582712369598

3184330,1,B000VSDNF0,"obviously this film is very polarizing, and i really play right into that. i got it. i really really did. i went into it knowing the Von Trier is a product of an education relying in part on German Expressionism, which is a very polarizing genre. from that respect, i knew i should be expecting a lot of sky shots, and he didn't let me down there! slow motion? BINGO! pretty much giving away the entire end game (not plot, there was none) in the opening sequence? absolutely! and the whole too loud music/ absolutely no music thing? got you covered!

and then the other shoe drops. this film was rife with symbolism, and it made the film really predictable. Tristan and Isolde? well, after reading the story was about two sisters who were both married at the beginning, you knew the husbands were out of the picture and  they were left to wander or get to a nunnery, so there that was. also... can i just say V.T.'s remarks about sympathizing with Hitler? Hitler's favorite composer was Wagner, a notorious anti-Semite. Tristan and Isolde was composed by... mhmm. just saying.

this film was very personal to V.T., who wrote and directed. my biggest issue with it besides the laughable predictability and excruciating slow pacing, was that it was so personal to him. this story was him trying to heal and reconcile the darkness within him through the characters; the different aspects of himself were very present in a Where The Wild Things are kind of way. Justine is the crippling physical toll and the relationship mistakes that we make in our despair. Claire is the loss of control when the spiral begins. Michael was the times when it's easier to let it go and walk away. John was when we want to give up, that selfishness that consumes you and turns the world into a singularity and you're in the middle of it, alone and desolate.  the mother, bitterness. the father, cowardice. every character represents an aspect of himself. so i get it, i do. i live in my own head that way (not quite the same cast... just kidding), so i don't have the energy to delve that deeply into his head with him. it was too deep to follow (as it were), but then presented only on the surface, which was discordant and jarring. There are plates, and there's the molten core, but no mantle present to shape the one or buffer the other.

but where does that leave us? good special effects. very single dimension acting, which was a damn bloody shame with that roster. both Skarsgards, and THAT'S how you use them??? oy. V.T.'s love of yellow and blue, which is just... his thing. shaky cameras? did he use a handheld machine for part of filming? hm.

i dunno. commentaries on how we live now and material possessions mean nothing when we're all worm food (or incinerated)... blah blah blah. it's been done, and better. so you'll love it or you'll hate it, just like you'll love or hate my take on it.",1384646400,6,2883,4.555984555984556

The film is visually beautiful, except for the stuff I mentioned in the first paragraph. The first half of the movie(the wedding party) comes off as pretentious and pompous, but I get the feeling that I'm not supposed to realize that, or I will be unsophisticated. The scenes at the wedding party, which is bankrolled by the husband of the bride's sister Claire (and don't you forget it!) are thick with meanness, deceit, selfishness, depression, etc. The bride, Justine, is very disappointing as a person, but she is mentally ill or something, so she gets a pass. After all, most of the other characters are at least as bad in their own ways. Things move very slowly here. I was trying to move the movie to 1.5 speed, but was unable.

The second half shifts gears, and we concentrate on the planet, Melancholia, which threatens to collide with the Earth. The film explores the role exchanges of the 2 sisters, as the stronger Claire is suddenly in need of the new calmness of the former bride--oh yeah, Justine's new husband had left her at the end of the wedding party because she obviously didn't want to be around him.

SPOILER......

At the horrific end, Claire's seemingly strong and reassuring scientist of a husband has apparently gulped all the suicide pills, so Claire, her son, and Justine are left to face the end of the world inside the teepee skeleton thing that Justine has built with her little nephew (Claire's son).  Claire is crying in the final moments, but strangely, the little boy is calm and emotionless, as if he were a prop. Of course, Justine is calm also, as that is part of what the director said he is trying to illustrate.

Although Christ is my Savor and I don't fear planetary doom, if you are easily discouraged and fearful, you may want to think twice about this one. There is a depressing heaviness about it, and after reading an interview with the director, I really think he wants the viewer to experience his depression.

3184337,2,B000VSDNF0,"This review contains a *spoiler alert for Fellinin's 8 1/2*

I watched the movie Melancholia several months ago, so all the details are not sharp in my mind, even while the essence of it had stayed with me for a long time. Quite frankly, I wasn't happy with the impression it made on me in the way most people are happy for having been impacted by a film. I have to compliment the visuals, which were really stunning, but it isn't worth watching for just that unless you were to fast forward through all the depressing mire of it's storyline.

I was not enriched in any way by watching Melancholia. I did not learn or gain anything of value. It did not make me think, only feel...dreadful. It's pretty, but that's all. There is nothing about any of the characters to like, not even the main character Justine, who I really wanted to feel sympathetic towards due to her struggles with depression. She comes off as harsh, empty, and unlikeable as her depression. I knew before watching the movie that the planet named Melancholia, on a collision course for earth, represented the director Lars Von Trier's struggles with depression, and as someone who struggles with depression can understand dwelling on dark thoughts, but why broaden that and include dark thoughts about destruction for THE WHOLE WORLD? What kind of person would want to impose their subverted homicidal desires in a film and have them played out as a fantasy, under the guise that it's a science fiction flick? I like a horror film to be a horror film, a science fiction film to be a science fiction film, and an abstract type art film to stick with that.

Oddly enough the movie Melancholia came to mind recently when I was watching Fellini's 8 1/2. 8 1/2 was about a director named Guido who can't find inspiration for his next film, so he goes to a spa near Rome to relax and thinks about his relationships. He went to be alone but everyone intrudes on him there, including his mistress and wife who he argues with, and then other people and memories from his past impinge on him. Supposedly the story Guido is working on is a science fiction epic, but in the end all he can think about is his relationships, so he ends up writing almost literal versions of his mistress, wife, and other people from his past into the movie as characters... It's now autobiographical as well as having a science fiction theme with religious overtones, and so it's now a confusing mess. In the end of 8 1/2 a writer character that Guido had been consulting with tells him he is right to decide not to go ahead and make it.

""Forgive men for quoting all the time. But we critics... do what we can. Our true mission is... sweeping away the thousands of miscarriages that everyday... obscenely... try to come to the light. And you would actually dare leave behind you a whole film, like a cripple who leaves behind his crooked footprint. Such a monstrous presumption to think that others could benefit from the squalid catalogue of your mistakes! And how do you benefit from stringing together the tattered pieces of your life? Your vague memories, the faces of people that you were never able to love...""

The character in that movie expresses how I feel about the film Melancholia. Von Trier should have had an abortion at some point, before he could give birth to such an unhappy film. It pretends to be many things it's not. For me it seemed like he was unleashing his inner demons in one large, disturbing homicidal fantasy. I suppose this might be an okay film to see if you lead a life of privilege or haven't experienced many disappointments, since it's mission seems to be to bring you down to the point where you are appalled by all the unlikeable characters, and then entertain thoughts about how it wouldn't be so bad if the world was ending. Hopefully if you don't know what it's like to feel sad and this movie hasn't brought you to where you have never been, a reaction hasn't occurred where you feel even more superior because you are better than all the unlikeable characters. I don't know how anyone can feel anything but mired down by a film like this, which is probably why there were sequences where Justine's favorite horse seemed to be melting into a golf course. I would not recommend this film to anyone who suffers from melancholy, since it is definitely not a cathartic type movie and only exacerbates feelings of sadness and angst.",1384041600,3,4409,4.604325699745547

The movie is terrifying and disturbing, especially when Dunst says, ""I can see things, and we are alone and not for long.""

3184382,5,B000VSDNF0,"""Melancholia"" is a postmodern science fiction film dealing with families grappling with typical familial dysfunction issues in the shadow of the coming apocalypse; a recurring theme since Biblical times with the family unit standing in for general human society. It establishes this from the opening sequences that go from the observations of an approaching giant planet to a young bride who abandons her groom at the altar to go off to have sex with a stranger much to the consternation of her sister who is very prim, proper and orderly. This introduces another theme as the sisters represent the major opposing forces at work in the universe, order and chaos, the alternating between disintegration and integration speaking to some fundamental concerns of the human dilemma; what is the nature of our individual reality within the scope of infinitely larger framework of a shared existence; why are we here; is there a God of order and justice and does this God have a master plan or is it all meaningless? The film goes on to address these concerns and to go into any more detail is to ruin it for others so I won't other than to say that it does so in a manner that simplifies complexity by positing that we are who we are and we do what we do because given our existential circumstances what other recourse have we.
The films mood and tone reflect these concerns to great effect and the writing, characterization, casting and direction are genius especially Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg as the sisters Justine (justice, order) and Claire (clarity, clear) and Charlotte Rampling as their mother, Gaby (Gabriellia as in the heralding angel).

3184385,5,B000VSDNF0,"Five stars. How ironic to rate the splendid Melancholia and to be limited by stars. This film was exquisite and chilling and one of the best I've ever seen. It is not for those who seek giddy scary entertainment or terror in the form of gore. It is not fast-paced. It is dreamlike, and there is SO much to take in. My husband and I just ""discovered"" Melancholia and we, both artists, were awed and moved by it. The music (some of Wagner's most evocative), the visuals, and the characterizations were lush. I loved Kiefer Sutherland's role. Kirsten Dunst, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Charlotte Rampling, John Hurt. What a cast! All terrific. The possibility of the imminent end of life on earth resonated deeply. I'm a conservationist dealing with habitat loss and threats of species extinctions - work that occasionally overwhelms me due to grief over humans' unbelievable capacity for cruelty and for squandering animal life and habitat that took millions of years to evolve. There is sometimes a sense of helplessness that something vastly destructive and unavoidable is hurtling towards us - except it's our increasing human population and consumption that is the force behind the giant wrecking ball.

The film is set in an isolated mansion within a landscape devoid of intrusions and that is a testament to human-cultivated perfection. Pristine green lawns spread to the sea. Perfectly-pruned topiary lines the lawn like sentinels. Metaphors abound in the setting and in the most ordinary or tangential of details. Everyone seems idle and catered to. Justine is a raw wound. Her sister is shrouded in the protective bonds of marriage, motherhood, and wealth. There is no explanation for the source of their wealth except the vague sense that it is based on innovation or science. Did it protect them? I won't spoil it for you.

When the credits ended, I went outside to look at the night sky above a wilderness here in the northeast. Far from cities and light pollution, the night seemed unusually star-filled, with greater contrast between the bright stars and the black sky. The black appeared more vast and deeper than ever, probably because I was still a captive of the film. The thought that we are so alone, so distant, and that life on earth is rare, and possibly so rare that it is singular in the universe, is unfathomable. This film is an apocalyptic trip, a vision both horrifying and beautiful. The menacing, mesmerizing, ineffable sphere of Melancholia keeps drawing closer. Whether we are alone in the universe or not, for now and probably forever, this world is the only one we get.

Its very hard for me to confirm how many times a movie has actually made me force myself to stay awake promising to myself that the Plot will pick up somewhere along the way. In this movie it never does. First off I have to criticize the cameraman. I mean seriously wobbly, just all around terrible. It was one of those movies that reminded me that these were actors on a set. I like a movie that sucks you in and  makes you feel like you are watching something for real, like you are almost their. Peter Jackson for instance does this quit well in his films (Like King Kong, which was a master Piece). Now granted that comparison may not be far as the two movies are completely different. HOWEVER let me use Peter Jacksons' ""King Kong"" as an example of what a good movie NEEDS for it to be worth a damn, Character Development, Back Story, DETAIL, Connection to the story, plot, and characters. I will say this as well. In THIS movie Dunst played her part as well as one could. In fact the acting wasn't at all bad, what was however was the damn script. It was painfully dull. Also the lighting in the movie was bad. Even on max brightness at times you didn't know what you were looking at. Another serious problem was that all the characters did a 360 and swapped places, and you have no back story on any of them. I mean one scratches there head thinking what the hell are they talking about more than half the time because from beginning to end we know nothing about any of the characters aside from there personalities. We don't know why they are the way they are, and every thing starts spinning right at the beginning. Its like the writer wrote a middle and ending and no beginning and poof that was good enough for a movie. Also a 1 hour scene of wedding drama....wow, it was terrible. The  story never progressed either. Its like we have the middle part of the story and the ending is beginning in the last quarter of the movie and then that's it. Total disappointment here. Not happy one bit. Thankfully I rented it before buying so I saved myself the trouble. The actors were the only ones who did their part.

Melancholia is NOT your typical end-of-the-world movie.

The controversial approach of a large asteroid that may or may not hit the earth - and you won't know for sure until the last few minutes of the movie - provides the undercurrents that motivate the characters.

The main theme in the movie, however, is the two sisters, chaotic Justine, played by Kirsten Dunst, and her sensible big sister Claire, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg,  They are like the sun and moon, or like the earth and the asteroid. As the movie progresses, Justine and Claire's adjustment to the approaching crisis gradually shifts the nature of their relationship.

The director guides Kirsten Dunst into an understated presentation of a melancholic. If you've never heard of Charlotte Gainsbourg before, you may be a huge fan by the end of the movie.

Director Lars von Trier uses the drama of Wagner's ""Tristan und Isolda"" to give the movie a brooding, Gothic air.

I can only conclude that the numerous bad reviews derive from popcorn movie enthusiasts expecting an action-packed, Bruce Willis-styled farrago of sweating protagonists, wide-mouthed screaming, and deafening explosions.

3184446,4,B000VSDNF0,"In Melancholia, a rogue planet unhinges from its orbit and destroys Earth.  The people on Earth have no ability to alter their fate and must meet it however they can.

In this movie, the person who can best meet such a disaster is Justine, the depressed sister of the high-strung over-achiever Claire.

The movie starts at a wedding at Claire's posh digs.  Justine is entering into an episode of depression consequently breaks down on her wedding night, thus causing estrangement from those she should be loving towards.  As Justine's depression worsens, she must move in with Clair and her family to be cared for.

The rogue planet-it's headed towards earth.  Initially, it is expected to fly by and head out to deep space but it ends up getting diverted by Earth's gravity and swings around for a collusion.  When this happens, Justine-who has already been to the bottom through her psychological issues rallies her sister's family to meet their fate nobly.

3184489,2,B000VSDNF0,"Melancholia HAS to be one of the biggest disappointments -not to mention most misleading descriptions for a film- of all-time.  It says Melancholia is a science fiction movie.  Um... not a chance.  It's supposed to be about a planet heading for Earth and destroying everyone and everything that makes up our wonderful planet, but... it not only falls short of that, it spends too much time avoiding the *main* *purpose* of the storyline.  That being, the fear, sadness, confusion and eventual ending of planet Earth.  Showing the occasional appearance of a planet passing by in the sky isn't enough to define science fiction (despite how destructively beautiful it may have appeared, which is probably the only reason the film got the name ""science fiction"").

Where to start with this mess...

First of all, the first half is entirely pointless.  ENTIRELY pointless.  If you can find anything worthwhile about it, I guess you either don't care that you're not getting what you've tuned in for (planetary destruction) or you like long-winded weddings.  Oh wait, before I mention the wedding... the first 10 mintues is nothing but a heavily orchestrated, overlong, slow-moving montage of different events related to the collision of two planets.  However this scene is *so* long that you simply end up bored with it eventually.  It misleads viewers into thinking something much bigger and worthwhile is coming with unbelievable cinematography to boot, but sadly that's not the case.  However I will admit the way it's presented is somewhat enchanting and pretty to admire.  I can appreciate it on a much different level, at least.

Anyway, yes, Kirsten Dunst has an hour long wedding for the first half of the movie.  Basically a series of mishaps occur that eventually end up completely ruining the wedding, not to mention the mother and sister not exactly being supportive of Kirsten's wedding so they act like total jerks with bad attitudes while Kirsten is trying to celebrate the most meaningful day of her life.  What the HECK is this?  A planet is heading towards Earth.  But... a wedding is occurring with soap opera-quality drama instead.  Who came up with this crap?

Now the SECOND half of the movie is when some minor improvements occur.  It's now obvious that the planet is coming into Earth's territory and a collision is either inevitable, or that the people will be spared barring a miracle (I won't reveal which one).  Kiefer Sutherland does a remarkable job keeping everyone in his family at ease with his strong firm belief that the planet will veer to the side and miss Earth completely, however there's something really odd about this- nobody is showing believable concern that their lives very well could be over very soon, and quite tragically.  I don't get it.  However Kirsten Dunst going through an episode of depression I *guess* could actually happen, though I'd like to believe a depressed person wouldn't be in such a state given what's about to come.  I could be wrong, though.  It's hard to say how a depressed person would react to such an event.  It might even bring them peace, relief or happiness.

The ending is remarkable at least.  That's when the movie truly deserves 2 stars.  The final 15 minutes of confusion and the several ""What to do/where to go?"" moments are worth sticking with the 1 hour/40 minutes of boredom before this.  But MAN!  Why does a wedding have to dominate the first half?  What purpose does it serve, seriously?  If you think a wedding occurring under such unusual circumstances is abnormal, you're right, it is.  It'd be like a wedding taking place on Pearl Harbor during World War II.  Not the least bit believable.

The film laughably tries splitting up the story into two separate portions with two separate stories involving the two sisters, but the concept honestly fails since the wedding in the first part truthfully doesn't belong in such a film.  I have no idea why the movie writers felt the need to even split the movie into two separate stories.  Unless they didn't have enough writing for the second (more important) story.  They probably wanted to add a fresh twist to the old and familiar ""The world is coming to end!"" plotline, but this is NOT the kind of refreshment that works.

You've been warned with this one, folks.  I can almost gurantee you're NOT getting what you think you are with Melancholia.",1370217600,5,4383,4.874154262516915

3184522,5,B000VSDNF0,"In Melancholia, Trier has again returned to the subject that interests him the most: the end, death and all that involves. This is a strangely moving and beautifully filmed story of two sisters, one undergoing dashed hopes and melancholic depression, the other in control. In many respects, they epitomize the world filled with dreams and wishes for the future. But, now that the world has been taken beyond religious beliefs to scientific knowledge of the universe, we see those dreams about to be obliterated by the arrival of a previously unknown planet named ""Melancholia,"" which is set on a collision course with Earth. This unexpected visitant will, via a gravitational ""dance of death"" destroy the planet and all who reside there. Everything will have been for nothing. And there is no God in whom to seek succor.

Following her superb enactment in Antichrist, Charlotte Gainsbourg makes a major appearance in this movie, proving once again her superb skills as an actress. Although not the lead star, she outshines those around her by being so human. Kirsten Dunst and Kiefer Sutherland also perform beautifully in what is a strangely mesmerizing, almost hypnotic account of the end of life on this planet.

But this is not a sci-fi movie, the dance of death being almost incidental to the emotions and torn feelings being undergone by the characters themselves. Kiefer Sutherland's character cannot face the truth of it and suicides, the depressed Justine,resigns herself to the end, as many of us will, useless to help ourselves or those around us. For Justine, the world will go, not with a bang but with a whimper.

Charlotte's humanity, on the other hand, shines through to the end. For the sake of the child, she helps her sister, Justine, build an invisible protective tent constructed of fallen timbers which will become the last outpost of safety against the arriving cataclysm: ""the secret cave."" As we witness the end of all things arriving, Trier achieves a poignancy I don't think I have ever witnessed before in any movie. I cried. There they sat, the two distraught women and small boy, protected only by a few useless branches formed to make a tepee, awaiting the apocalyptic omega point: the end of all ends.

Here I depart from the opinions of the actors and propose that Justine does not become the stronger of the two sisters. She appears to turn more stoic, but it is a kind of blind stubbornness that overtakes her, a refusal to accept an end. This may well be an aspect of depression, but it is not normality. In Claire's case, however, we witness true humanity, the way we would all react to an inescapable apocalyptic end: we would sob our hearts out at the loss of a future, at childhood's end, and at the final realization that there is no God watching over us.

This is Trier reaching the peak of his performance. Unafraid to face the future.",1368489600,3,2878,4.817813765182186

The people who hated Melancholia clearly know nothing about how fairy tales (i.e., Mrchen) actually end. Disney endings are an American invention, but  Lars von Trier follows the European Mrchen style, in which a ""happy ending"" is only the best possible outcome to an unfortunate situation. If you are looking for Disney's version of the Little Mermaid, forget it, but if you want to see something more like H.C. Andersen's 'Lille Havfrue,' this fits the bill. To some folks this may be a giveaway as to the ending, but it is worth it to see it through. I was a little distracted by the lead characters having different accents, though being related (one American and one British speaking sister?), but in the end decided it suited their personality differences enough to be forgivable, if not exactly the way I would imagine it. If you have ever read a Grimm brothers fairy tale in the original German and hated it, I would not imagine you would enjoy this film, but if you are the type who enjoys the complexities and melancholia of the Mrchen genre, then you should not miss this modern fairytale.",1365465600,4,1174,4.699029126213592

3184567,2,B000VSDNF0,"This Danish movie needed some editing, it starts off with a credits intro that goes for eight minutes where the director seems to think pressing pause and filming the paused image is something clever.  It might be unique in the film world but missed the point that there is an obvious reason why no one else has done it. That reason is it gets old fast, boring and then annoying. I ended up fast-forwarding to the end of the ridiculous intro, it was that hard to sit through. Even though Melancholia is a Danish made movie the actors speak English and not dubbed or anything like this.  I think Kirsten Dunst does a great acting job with her either mentally disabled or possibly simply severely depressed character Justine. We're never told over the two hours what's wrong with her but the film opens with her wedding and it becomes pretty obvious very fast that she's in no condition to consent to marriage and is simply there because her sister, and others want her to marry the guy. It therefore takes on a bit of a creepy vibe, the guy obviously wants to marry her because she is in a beautiful female adult body, but she clearly doesn't have the mind of an adult.  Even Sutherland's character, the husband of her sister has a creepy you remember our deal line after telling her off for the amount of money he's spent on the party (wedding) which she keeps trying to escape and hide away in different parts of the mansion, implying with the our deal line she's still got to fulfil certain bedroom duties for him when her a lot less attractive sister isn't around, even though she's marrying this other guy. So I do think Dunst does do a brilliant job, it's just the movie overall is so slow paced and dragged out and there is no real payoff for Justine that you end up wondering what the point of the 2hrs 16 minutes you spent watching it was.

The movie is divided into two acts the wedding and post wedding.  The later brings the fact from being a minor focus, to the main backdrop focus, that some planet which has been hiding behind the sun unnoticed all this time called Melancholia, is possibly going to crash into Earth. The makers of this film seem to want to turn your typical cartoon image of the moon rising over a lake into a planet rising over the golf course that was in the backyard of the Danish mansion everyone lives in. Even though you can't detect the curvature of the Earth in real life, somehow you can see it in this film.  Both acts 1 and 2 just seemed pointless, there was no payoff at the end of either. This is one of those movies once you've seen it you wish you'd done something else instead. The only thing reason really to watch it is that Dunst goes topless in a very arty pose at the hour and half mark, but you could probably just Google that image rather than buying this.",1364342400,6,2811,4.385796545105566

If you are looking for that type of movie, then seek out ARMAGEDDON, DEEP IMPACT, or WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE. Nope, this is Lars Von Trier's film about the insanity / fickleness of human emotions in the face of tragedy and loss. Yes, the Earth is in the path of a rogue planet named MELANCHOLIA, but this is more of a metaphor for what's happening to the characters on screen, than it is an actual event. The huge, impending doom of our dear planet is actually played down, almost until the very end. Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg are fascinating as the bi-polar Justine and her seemingly level-headed sister, Claire. From the opening, hilarious drive in the stretch-limousine, to the wedding catastrophe, to the ultimate climax, MELANCHOLIA is an uncomfortable story. However, Von Trier, like his (very few) peers, is concerned more w/ true humanity, than w/ anything pretty or cosmetic. With this film, he has outdone himself, even overshadowing his brilliant, ANTICHRIST. Quite a feat indeed! Highly recommended...",1363737600,4,1166,5.015463917525773

3184591,5,B000VSDNF0,"I was a little shocked to see roughly half of the reviews are 1 and 2 star.  Obviously this film is not for everybody.  Lars starts with enough borrowings from Kubrick's 2001, ie, classical music and sensuously crafted planetary images, to warn you that this is not your average science fiction movie.

Spoiler alerts
The apparently artsy f*rtsy sequences at the beginning of the movie are truly mesmerizing and they beat the s*** out of the average Hollywood introduction.  Later you find out they are all precognitions, or foreshadows.  Maybe I am not very sophisticated, but these slow motion sequences floating on top of Wagner are like nothing I have ever seen or heard of before.  They are original, really original, in an age of knockoffs, imitations, and sequels.

As the movie winds down, a person ought to be moved by the fact that only the melancholic Kirsten Dunst is possessed of clearheadedness and courage.  Of course, earlier, she is a train wreck to most of those around her, as any gorgeous melancholic usually is.  But she metes out a great deal of love to many of her relatives as well.  Her only really nasty side is the one that destroys her new husband and marriage - but she has her reasons, as he is needy and smothering, something a melancholic has to run from.  Is it possible he is a melancholic as well?  Her sister, apparently an anchor of reason and support, devolves into a blithering idiot, but not before showing us her own demons - she is haunted by terrors which may be larger than anything faced by anyone else.

The nicest, most rational, most stable, richest, and most charismatic person in the cast, Kiefer Sutherland, commits suicide when his family needs him most.  Is he the biggest melancholic in the story? Or just the least courageous?  Wow, that seems depressing, but it is supposed to!

A Danish film maker might be expected to grab a couple of ""character"" Nordics for seasoning, and Stellan Skarsgard and Udo Kier are wonderfully up to the task. Stellan is his usual porcupiny self, and Kier actually provides understated and still hilarious comic relief.

The writing is great, the production is great, the acting is stellar. I am not sure about the science, but, Jeez, ""The Matrix"" started with absolute crap science and everybody moved on rather quickly.  If you don't like the movie, you probably had an unyielding preconception of what the movie was going to be and you're upset that you were wrong.  For the rest of us, I think this was what every great dramatic work always is - peerless character development couched in an unpredictable plot.

So now I have to do the big finish of my review: The medical condition of melancholia isn't the worst thing in the world, and there are other things that will kill you faster.  In the end, only the melancholics are properly connected to reality.  Even when a gigantic planet enmeshes you and pulls you apart, you can still keep your dignity.

It continues his theme of mental illness which he brought painfully to the screen in Antichrist. In Melancholia it's about depression, which Von Trier has personally fought.
With that put aside, the first part is difficult and can be infuriating or absorbing- you need some patience. As Kirsten Dunst falls into her depression is palpable.

3184618,4,B000VSDNF0,"MELANCHOLIA is a rather slow-moving, very European-flavored drama that is driven more by dialogue and nuance than it is by plot and tension: There is virtually no fast action or violence as we know it here. It does get a little draggy in places, like a long novel that takes its time with meticulous character development. Anyone who finds this description unappealing should probably avoid this one.

Having said that, I found the acting--particularly that of the central ""depressive"" characters played by Dunst, Gainsbourg, and the young Cameron Spurr--quite outstanding. Combined with the painstaking cinematography and slow-burning but solid storyline, the result is a film that is amazing on many levels. MELANCHOLIA is a serious comedy that is different without being deliberately weird.

Part I concerns itself with Justine (Dunst)'s wedding party at the lavish estate of her sister Claire (Gainsbourg). I won't tell you what happens, but some interesting stuff does. There is also finely embedded satire on the corporate world and familiar relations, with special focus on snooty rich people. The characters are all silly in their own special ways, making for a very fine human comedy.

Part II is told from the point of view of Claire. A character who was quite dislikeable in Part I is humanized here. Claire's public rich girl front is believably gone, and the two sisters, apparently complete opposites in Part I, are shown to be very much alike. On this note, the theme in the title becomes evident. Claire's son Leo (Spurr) becomes a kindred spirit with his mother and aunt as the rogue planet Melancholia (to be taken literally, metaphorically, or both) approaches Earth.

(The Antichrist is another stunning work of art.)

I came back to it a few months later and I'm glad I did. I thought this was a movie about a bunch of rich spoiled folks...I was wrong.

The main female character is getting married but there's a problem, she's neurotic and depressed. She hasn't really developed a good defensive lie of character like almost everyone else around her. Her soul is naked and she feels exposed and at the same time she sees through everyone else's lies and it is destroying her. She sees the horror of life in front and behind her and the terror of death before her. She sees it and feels it and can't stop these feelings or this pressure.......Everyone gives up on her except her sister.

When it looks like the whole world is going to be destroyed she handles it better than anyone else because she's lived with this terror all her life and now the suffering may come to an end......Maybe the underlying cause of depression is knowing what life is really about, without illusions and not being able to express it or understand it. Van Tier is definitely on to something here.....

This movie is not just a science fiction drama about the end of the world, it's about death and the lies that we tell ourselves everyday so that we can get to the end ........ It doesn't matter if the world ends with a bang or a whimper, it's coming.......get ready.

At any rate, those negative reviews, upon reading them, all come from a place of ignorance and closed mindedness.  No.  this is not a Hollywood ""Happy Ending"" film.  But you could say that without spoiling the dramatic climax that is the end of the movie.

Critically acclaimed and outstanding cinematography are the stand out points of this film.  Those of you who think it drags, obviously need subtitles because you can't understand the film without mindless ""expositional"" (look it up) dialogue.

If you have suffered from an Affective Disorder such as depression, you will probably relate to this film.  If you have not, there may not be much here for you except the lush cinematography.  The new medium can capture *real* nighttime and starlight, unlike earlier film which used ""Day For Night"" (yes, there is an old movie with that title).

The scenes shot both inside and outside are riveting.  The entire film is like a dream sequence punctuated by moments of ""reality"".  And, to my mind, at least, the entire enterprise reveals much of what it is like to experience life-long depression.  It also shows why it is so difficult for people like us to have any ""faith"" beyond this existence.

  Now, I have to say that, in my opinion, the fact that I've watched, & liked, Lars Von Triers' movies before, may have a good bit to do with my enjoying this style of film-making, but it certainly doesn't account for my coming out at the end of the story feeling that this may be his finest work & a masterpiece, as well.

3184666,5,B000VSDNF0,"This is the most effective and emotionally powerful movie I have ever seen on what it is like to be the Identified Patient in a family.

""Also called the ""symptom-bearer"" or ""presenting problem"" - may display unexplainable emotional or physical symptoms, and is often the first person to seek help, perhaps at the request of the family.""

Even though the family expresses concern for the IP, they subconsciously react to her improving by trying to reinstate the status quo.

She enacts what may be an implicit familial call for help- as with seeing juvenile delinquency as a coded cry for help by a child on his parents' behalf. Subconsciously becoming sick to prevent worse things happening in the family, such as a total family breakdown.

The IP is actually doing pretty well at the beginning of the film, but is going to an extremely elaborate wedding planned by her sister. The family demand that she be 'happy' is another rejection of her self, putting more pressure onto her to be content so that the family can feel okay. Her sister no doubt insisted or shamed her into having this kind of a huge wedding...

By making her 'wellness' the center of the family attention, they focus on HER as the problem, and if she can be fixed all will be well....thus avoiding awareness of the immense pain they all feel and of just how bad things truly are....also it is a way of blaming her for their dysfunctions...a kind of emotional release value, letting off steam when it gets too hot.

Of course this focus on and demand for her 'happiness' only enrages and traps her, and acts pushes her into relapse.

She probably choose her groom because, under it all, he was like her family though not as obviously.

The scene when he wants to have sex, and she asks 'can I have a moment?' Yet he does not understand, he wants what he wants, and his ego is at stake. He abandons and uses her just as the family did...there is NO one there for her as she is disintegrating, the abandonment of both her husband and father are devestating, but not unfamiliar.

No matter what she does, she is trapped. The system is designed like that.

Her sister alternately treats her with tenderness and care, and then berates and bullies her when she can't get into the tub without help, or when she isn't ready to go riding, or when she is late for the wedding, starts to fall apart at the wedding after being in contact with her family again, of course...

That is why she can say, ""You think I'm afraid of a planet?"" For after having lived in the Hell of this family, with the cruelest Mother I have EVER seen in cinema, the impending end to earth seems like almost a blessing.",1359590400,5,2655,4.521920668058455

But in my opinion, the movie does too little with a really fantastic premise, and I don't mean it should have been a ""disaster movie"". The first half of the movie is terribly slow, showing in hundred different ways how ""melancholic"" the character Justine is. Kirsten Dunst's Justine seemed rather schizophrenic than melancholic - considering how she acted during her wedding. It also made the character very unlikeable.
The second part centers on her sister Claire, and the tempo improves (even though there is never any doubt how the movie will end). I liked the second part much more, as there is more interaction among the characters. Charlotte Gainsbrough as Claire is very believable and compelling. She was my favorite character in the movie.

3184694,3,B000VSDNF0,"This opens with a prologue in very, very, very slow motion that seems to last ages. If Zach Snyder (The Watchmen, 300) directed this movie people would immediately troll him on the internet. But this film gets a pass among film critics because Lars Von Trier, who is considered an auteur, directed this.

Its a story of two sisters facing the apocalypse and how they react to it. One gives in to her instinct and accepts the doom albeit in a very depressed fashion. The other sister denies the inevitable and relies on science to soothe her, and panics when faced with the truth.

It has some very nice visuals that seem to be stills (maybe they where), recalling work by Tarsem Singh (The Fall, Immortals). The pacing is slow and deliberate, and picks up speed by the second sisters story.

There are illogical and unrealistic situations in this film. The type of approaching apocalypse should have had killed everyone before it finally happened. The setting is also one of total isolation for the main characters in the film, although privileged and situated in a sprawling estate, there are no looters, rioters, crazies or any other sort of people in their sphere of existence. Im guessing this is supposed to be one of those surreal movies.

Nice but Ill only recommend it to hardcore film buffs. I even had pricey craft beer and cheese with this, still didn't do well with me.",1358121600,2,1381,4.694214876033058

I think the Justine character is magnificently well acted as a realistic victim of major depression who sabotages her life but comes easily to terms with the end, while her sister (who can at some point cross an uncrossable bridge) cannot bring herself to accept the end. This is a film to think about for a good while after seeing it, and then see it again for details that one missed the first time. I'm not a great fan of von Trier's earlier work, but I think he is finally coming a bit down to Earth. Anybody who has dealt with major depression will relate to the Dunst character and find this portrayal quite true to life and intriguing.",1358035200,8,742,4.232394366197183
3184696,5,B000VSDNF0,"A tale of two sisters. If we don't look too closely, Justine and Claire seem totally different, even polar opposites. Yet they have one important thing in common. Both are insulated from ordinary experience, but each in her own extreme. Claire lives a pampered life in a gated mentality. She strives to attain an uninterrupted state of being happy, aided and abetted by obscenely rich husband John who is dedicated to keeping her on a diet of 100% artificial sweetness no matter what ugliness reality would offer.  Anything that might disrupt her fragile version of being happy is summarily vanquished from awareness.  Justine's psychological self-exile is all numbness and pain. Immune from Claire's comical complacency, her reflexive urge to look beneath the surface of everything and everybody has condemned her to the role of an isolated outsider who believes life is evil. Jack the CEO, Michael the dreamer, John the empiricist, everyone is repugnant, ridiculous, and wrong. She suffers an oppressive awareness of life's ubiquitous violence. She knows no niche of warmth and love. Her futile efforts to belong collapse into complete withdrawal. She does not suffer alone for long, however, for Claire crumbles when condemned to a horror she can't escape, the approach of the planet Melancholia. Melancholia is an all-in-one symbol for the accumulated baggage of civilization (mental and environmental), the end of the world, the destruction of Claire's/western values, and Justine's nihilist mentality. Justine welcomes Melancholia as a resolution to her life-is-evil quandary, she even identifies with it (the mystical nude scene). Revitalized, Justine tries to comfort Claire with her spirituality, but neither sister could ever comfort the other.

Wagner presented a similar vision of the world in his opera ""Tristan and Isolde"" and especially ""The Ring"" cycle of operas. We hear the prelude to Tristan and Isolde in the first and last scenes, and at other moments of compassion in between. In Melancholia this music represents the Wagnerian concept of Transcendence through Love, the idea that love lets us peacefully accept inevitable death. This theme is the musical equivalent of Justine's Magic Cave.  In the final scene we see Wagner's music.

This compassionate film about compassion is von Trier at his best.  He is pensive from the heart.  If he can't save the world, then he wants to console it.  As in all great films, each contributor is thoroughly in tune with its messge and devoted to its artful presentation. This is a huge accomplishment, given that the film engages us with unconventional ideas in a mixture of cultural traditions without lecturing or seeming contrived.",1358035200,2,2696,5.268065268065268

Okay, it was very visually artistic.  The beautiful sets, costumes, and scenes with in slow motion that you could dry paint to.  True.
But for me, artistic does not a good movie make.  If Kirsten Dunst is the main character, all I saw, was a couple scenes with her standing there, doing something with her hands.  That doesn't hook me to her as a character.  And she didn't even have to be speaking (though that would have been a plus), but who the gosh-darn-darn is she? What is her life like? Where is the action in the story? Where is the challenge she is presented with, and must overcome as a character (i.e. the whole foundation of a good story).

- there is a scene of Dunst, suffering from depression or melancholia, where she is unable to bathe, walk, or do anything, except to sleep. It is this scene of someone so suffering from depression that she cannot even engage in the living which struck me, that depression, if worse enough, is an illness that creates suffering, and robs one of even the simple acts of living, or engaging in life activities itself. This cost of depression was what struck me afterwards, that depression robs you of time, robs you of even engaging in life, simple or otherwise.

- i dunno about the last half, was it Dunst character, because she suffered so much that she saw the end of the world as being something to free her from her suffering? or was it more that Gainsborough's character had more to live for, son, husband, good life, that she feared losing it all?

- the wedding was annoying, i felt like punching Dunst to get real or to get with it, how could she have gone so far, pretending, and leading other people in thinking otherwise? It was like she was mis-leading other people or acting in bad faith, to those who simply cared about her.

It is impossible to deny that this film is a very impressive piece of film making. Many people might not see a point to it all. It does ""drag,"" but it's not a movie that will spoon feed you the details. Even to those who understand it, it can be painful to watch, but in a good way.

To me, ""Melancholia"" is about depression. The planet is a metaphor for the state of mind that depressed people are in; there is always a feeling of impending doom or a ""what's the point? we're all going to die anyway"" mentality. Once the main character's brother in law, who had been skeptical and frustrated with her state of mind, realized what was really going to happen, he killed himself without thinking twice about it. Once he felt, in a tangible sense, what his sister in law had been feeling, it hit him like a kick in the balls and he didn't even think twice about suicide.

This film is exactly like an art-house version of the video for Radiohead's ""Just,"" or at least that's what it reminds me of.

Some of the scenes from this movie are burned in my brain; I don't think I'll ever forget them.  Extremely intriguing vision of the director.,1354147200,4,377,4.328571428571428
3184739,5,B000VSDNF0,"People seem to think this movie is about depression and who am I to disagree ?  Except that it isn't.  You see Justine knows what's coming and she knows it on her wedding day. She knows it at the deepest, most profound level so she begins to go through the stages of grief starting on what ironically should be the happiest day of her life.

I had to watch the movie twice to get all the details but trust me this is a beautiful, well thought out movie. The actors, production staff, everyone involved with the movie deserve a ton of credit. This movie is not for children or the innocent among us but people should give it a chance.

We're starting to learn from extra solar system research that our system may be abnormal. It seems common to have large gas planets close to their stars ... alot closer than occurs in our solar system. If Neptune were to get perturbed in it's orbit by a passing star or brown dwarf the scenario played out in this movie could come to pass.

In this past, you might have a movie about people working to make sure some people(and therefore the human race) night survive.  Perhaps such a film would be overly optimistic, but such movies reflected the can-do attitude of a couple decades ago.  These times are gone.

OK, if the end of the world is coming and you have decided there is nothing you can do about it, what would you do?  Some might find religion and try to make their peace with God.  Others would take an opposite tact, and have a continuous wild party. Some might take on an incredible adventure.  Why not, you are going to die anyway, so what does it matter?

Of course, some people would simply mope around feeling depressed, having a miserable time and making everyone around them miserable until the end.  That is what the characters in this movie do; they do nothing.  They are boring and pathetic and, frankly, I found myself hoping that the oncoming planet, Melancholia, would hurry up and wipe these losers out.",1352937600,3,1064,4.582010582010582

I had to go and look up the definition of that which would be something along the lines of an independent film that only appeals to a small niche audience in contrast to, say, a broad audience Hollywood big budget film.  Unfortunately a lot of ""art"" films are ghastly and this is one of them.  A slow moving film with shaky cam for ""realism"" and wooden acting may be great for someone who thinks that this style flies in the face of Hollywood excess, but for me this movie was a pretentious slug fest that looked like an amateur effort throughout.  Maybe I'll give it another try later and see if I can become an insider into the heavy world of symbolism and shaky cam realism but I doubt it.  Incidentally shaky cam does just the opposite for me usually as far as getting me deeper into the mix of the film by it being ""realistic"".  I don't view the world with a shaky cam view so how is this realism?

What did I find less than entertaining?

#1 The shaky camera.  Reminded me of home videos and added nothing to the realism.
#2 The slow pace.  This one really dragged.  Not just as a change of tempo, this movie dragged on and on.  The closest thing to action throughout most of this effort at cinema was the constantly shaking camera.
#3 The obsession with clinical depression.  As an element in the movie it might have worked.  It didn't just dominate the movie, it was the movie.  The movie should come with a Surgeon General's warning that it could be dangerous to mental health.
#4 The bad science.  I accept that strict adherence to science isn't always desirable in a motion picture, but no catastrophic effects of a gas-giant planet approaching the earth until the moment of impact is so implausible that it renders everything on the shaky screen  unbelievable.

Kirsten Dunst is superb as the clinically depressed bride who forgoes wedded bliss, nepotism and all the evils of the world for the sanity of Melancholia. Melancholia is the planet that is on a collision course with Earth. As it gets closer she becomes more lucid and emotionally lithe. Her care-taker sister is the one who loses it. The denial of the sister is the very thing that would save the world in the by now banal action-packed film in which Sigourney Weavers and Will Smiths save the day with lasers or some other human ego invention. The last scene of the film makes it quite clear that everybody dies.",1351468800,3,665,4.55
3184771,1,B000VSDNF0,"(There are some spoilers here; but most are expected anyway - and noted on the DVD case's back )

This is a wedding story with all love lost (except for a mother-child tableau, ending in wistfully, lovingly dying together). And too, an elegant celebration of depression, self- indulgence and delusion (actors and director included). Which the title certainly conveys.
No surprises anywhere.

The wedding guests have all lived The Good Life; all that can be bought is theirs. For these ultra-uppers, money is of no consequence.

The pace is turgid,'funeriaile' (yes,'old french),
everyone's insouciant worldly upper-class gentry;
Melancholia seems very European.

Characters are gourmands in everything from foods to aplatinum chain of indulgences. Everyone plays at being gay, but still anesthetized by all they have, do, seen and done to excess; vacuously effete and then some.

They've gathered for the wedding of a manic-depressive (In New Age speak: bipolar) bride who arrives hours late with a smiling, shrugging 'sorry'. Guests barely notice, so into themselves are they. The oblivious groom just coo's endearments and grovels.

Add to the charade the wedding night is just before a planet smashes into a doomed earth (or maybe not); but first, the bride to be gets it on/off with a wage slave mild guy guest from her ad agency (a job she evidently does to simulate purpose)in a sand trap on the mansion grounds; throughout this is an orgy of not-caring.

Is this deadly movie in so many ways, a parody or a slap
at rich folk or rabid self-indulgence/self and audience-loathing of its director?

And this this indulgence got awards at Cannes?
That's a cynical joke or parody in itself.

Some beautiful images but the plot, such as it was, was asinine; the characters were wooden, even though many of them are excellent actors; and von Trier's passion for extended cuts made the film seem to take forever. Oh and then the physics (or lack of it). A rogue planet is approaching the Earth? From where? Perhaps von Trier read an article one day about the risk of an asteroid hitting the Earth and confused ""planet"" with ""asteroid"" but the image is that of a planet. Why is Hollywood so lazy when it comes to getting physics right? Rockets that make right angle turns, guns that go whoosh in a vacuum and now a planet that approaches the Earth without anybody noticing and without any gravitational effects.",1351296000,4,819,4.503355704697986

Melancholia can be exquisitely beautiful if you allow it to be. However, I'm going to start sounding very artsy here: the first time I watched it sober, it was decent. But like everyone else, I'm more easily pulled more toward movies like John Carter.

Watched it quite inebriated with herbs the next time, and the experience was groundbreaking. I'd quite recommend going this route, as this movie is at heart about empathy and pain, and both are incredibly real with the use of substances.",1350518400,3,857,4.8231292517006805

I can stomach the notion of two sisters with completely different accents.  But the bizarre assertion that somebody who correctly guesses the number of beans in a jar has special authority on all the planets orbiting the three hundred sextillion stars in the known universe? Um... no.

That aside, yes the movie is beautifully filmed.  Dunst does a good job in her role and as someone who is very well acquainted with depression, I found her character believable.  Unfortunately, the rest are very stilted, though the fault seems to be in a script that can't decide whether it's the twenty-first or the eighteenth century.

Ultimately, what's frustrating about this movie is that with just a little more common sense and verisimilitude, it could have been fantastic.  As is, it will probably appeal mainly to more pretentious movie-goers who incorrectly surmise that art and believability are mutually exclusive (despite beautiful films like American Beauty and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind proving otherwise).

The cinematography here is outstanding, the ""choreography"", if you will, pure genius, and the acting/direction of the highest quality. Not a film made to please the ""masses"". It's not Spielberg or Howard. This film, like Bergman's, deals with the complexity of feelings and the interaction of its characters. It is by far the best performance ever by Dunst, and where has the brillant Charlotte Gainsbourg been all my life (what a ""face"" packed with character).

No buildings exploding or death defying car chases...just...four people slowly realizing that time has run out, and each dealing with it in his or her own, slightly dumbfounded way.

I was more moved by this movie than any of the big apocalypse blockbusters that have tried to do the same thing.  This is, I think, how the world might end.  Not with a ""bang"" but a whimper, as the poet once wrote.

It took me a full hour after I'd seen it to be able to think straight, and longer to decide what I thought and why.  But I think I've put it into words as best I can.

3184810,4,B000VSDNF0,"Like most Lar von Trier's movies, this one is not easy to watch.  It is a complex film that requires undivided attention.  Great selection of actors delivers set of characters that help define two sister Claire and Justine in all their complexities.  This film is shot at the beautiful chateau and everything about the film is visually pleasing: from the scenes in part 1 where Justine, newly married young woman, has her wedding reception funded and organized by her sister and her brother-in-law; to the scenes in part 2 where some shots of a beautiful planet Melancholia in all its fantasic shine is simply breathtaking.  Many of the scenes from this film remind me of the beautiful scenes from the movie ""Tree of Life"".

At her wedding reception Justine does her best to appear happy: her groom is handsome and attentive, her sister plans her wedding to the smallest detail, the event is catered and organized in a beautiful castle with garden that is zen-like.  But Justine is not herself and she manages in a single night to alienate herself from her family, break up her new marriage and say some things to her employer that very few people would dare to speak out loud - ever.  Justine's emotional meltdown is overtaking her and all around her.

In the second part, Justine's sister Claire decides to take her on after Justine has nervous breakdown.  Justine, a houseguest with indefinite need for rest, joins Claire's family.  Claire's husband John who is an amateur astronomer tells them about planet called Melancholia that is dangerously close to earth.  It is uncertain if this planet will hit earth an cause destruction, or if it will barely miss the collision.  As Claire panicks on how best to manage this impending disaster, Justine calmy observes the world around her.  To her, world is dead already and the only capacity she has left in her is to transition the living into this new stage of being when one is so separated from their surroundings they can only stand on the sideline and help others transition into the new state of existance.

Personally, I enjoyed this film, but I know it is not meant for wide audiences.  It is an art movie that tackles some sensitive emotional, psychological and philosophical questions.  This is also visually pleasing movie with beautiful music that surround this compelling and very personal story.",1347840000,6,2358,4.8575
3184811,4,B000VSDNF0,"Reviewer Sever clues us in on Lars Von Trier suffers from unipolar depression.  So does Sever and so do I.  Thus, this movie was no mystery for us as melancholia is a state of emotional mood.  Kirsten Dunst is Melancholia personified right from the start of the movie, although it may not be apparent to most as she smiles a lot during her wedding reception. After meeting her parents, John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling, her state of emotional health should come as no surprise.

Juxtaposed with this is the planet Melancholia which is on collision course with the earth. Although Keifer Sutherland, her brother-in-law, exudes false euphoria that we will avoid destruction by it, Dunst knows better because she accepts such sad facts more easily. She can see the end of the world easily because she is always perched on her own personal end of the world each day.

Her sister, Charlotte Gainsborough, is initially convinced all will be well but she starts to unravel as the planet looms ever closer. As we move closer to the climax, the three central figures are the two sisters and the young son of the Gainsborough character.

The imagery is exquisite throughout and the beginning of the film is an incredible montage of images which will all be covered by the film.

Lars Von Trier is an acquired taste.  Do I like this as much as the first film of his I ever saw, ZENTROPA? No, but that isn't the point.  These are art films and it requires a different perceptual set to appreciate his work.  If you have no artistic inclination, you will probably hate all of his work. If you are very arty, you will probably want to explore his work.

3184852,5,B000VSDNF0,"Once the credits begain to roll at the end of Melancholia, the only word I could think of was ""Wow!"" Lars von Trier is one of those directors whose films either blow you away or leave you cold, a quick glance at the reviews section will show you that. I found Melancholia to be a beautiful, depressing, involving, and ultimately rewarding experience. The film is divided into three chapters, with the opening prologue leaving me breathless. The other two chapters are entitled ""Justine"" and ""Claire"". ""Justine"" opens with Kirsten Dunst and Alexander Skarsgrd on the way to their wedding reception, were they arrive late. This takes place at her sister Charlotte Gainsbourg's (in a terrific performance) and Kiefer Sutherland's mansion. The second chapter, Claire, is were we find out earth could possibly collide with another planet named, you guessed it, Melancholia. I don't want to give anything away, because the film works so well when you have no idea what could happen. I think this is the best performance Kirsten Dunst has ever given, her character isn't sympathetic per se, but you can't take your eyes off her. I never had the feeling that I was watching actors reading lines on the screen, instead I felt like I was eavesdropping on private conversions. Lars von Trier gives the film a documentary tone in several of these scenes and it works perfectly. As the film unfolded I begin to feel the characters dread right along with them. Melancholia is a dialogue driven film, but it never once becomes boring. It won't appeal to all taste, but I found it to be a masterpiece, both as a piece of storytelling and a master class in acting. I definitely recommend you give the film a chance.

I really tried. I woke up and watched as they all got destroyed as a family. Who wants to watch stuff like that? Perhaps there was something deeper to be conveyed here. I consider myself to be an eclectic viewer when it comes to movies but this was one was a stretch for me.,1347494400,4,443,4.223529411764706
3184854,3,B000VSDNF0,"I think I was expecting a lot more action in this movie because I ended up being rather disappointed during most of it. And a little annoyed by Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and how she behaved. Maybe that's a testament to her acting ability that she was so easily able to irk me. Or I just don't like her, but I've liked her in other movies so it's probably not that.

I hate whispery dialog and this movie is full of it so maybe I missed something important that might have explained some things that didn't make sense. A lot didn't make sense but at least you know going in how it's going to end so there's something to look forward to. In the beginning I was rooting for the big sha-bang at the end, because the first half of movie just drags and it's just unfortunate it takes so long to get there. And if the first half is too slow, too whispery, and too long for you too, getting to the end takes f-o-r-e-v-e-r.

I read another review about this movie that said it helps knowing the character Justine suffers from melancholia, and maybe it would have but I guess we're supposed to know one of them does considering the name of the movie but Melancholia is also the name of the planet coming towards Earth, so on the flip side maybe not. It might have helped to see previews too, though we know previews show only the best parts usually.

About three quarters of the way through I started to feel this anxious feeling. Because until the last few minutes or so you really don't know for sure if the end (that you read in the movie description) will come. It's really easy to believe Claire's (Charlotte Gainsbourg) husband (Kiefer Sutherland, especially if you're a 24 fan!) when he assures her that Melancholia will do a fly by and not hit earth.

Too easy.

But soon you know. And then the end is coming and maybe you feel what they feel, and what seemed like a bad movie initially (for the first hour, really) has an ending that redeems itself somewhat.

Only somewhat.

Visually it was beautiful, no denying that. But too dark --and I don't mean the context, I mean the lighting in the movie in many scenes was so dark you couldn't really see anything. Implications aside, a little light is better than ""hey guess what that is"" in most cases. Especially when combined with the whispery dialog and scenes that don't seem to make sense while you're watching them.

When this movie ended I thought ""ugh stupid movie!"" but, having thought about it some more, whatever the point was supposed to be, (over my head or not) it's still with me. The visuals, the characters, the idea of a planet on a possible collision course with Earth.

So for the less high brow crowd that won't likely dissect and explain every nuance and angle, maybe that was the point. To make a statement. (any statement, like look at me! watch my movie! remember me!!)

OK, point taken.

Just know, for those who haven't seen it, this is not your average movie. It's slow, quiet, dark, and the big sha-bang you read about in the description and reviews --- well you'll have see it --- but you have a long way to go to get there, and, maybe like me, you'll give in a little, get into it some, and feel that slow build of the end coming.",1347235200,3,3204,4.39527027027027
3184855,3,B000VSDNF0,"Melancholia is visually stunning. The cinematogaphy is captivating and beautiful. The acting is also well done. But the storyline is disturbing. The movie actually consists of two parts, or acts similar to a play, focusing on each of the two main female characters. Both characters have individual psychological issues they must face and by the end of the movie they become intertwined in helping each other through their problems. This movie jabs at your psyche in the same manner as Black Swan, compelling you to watch and wanting to turn it off at the same time.

3184859,5,B000VSDNF0,"It's bugging me that I'm only seeing 3 stars beside this masterpiece of a movie, so I decided to write my own review. In a world full of reality tv garbage and blockbuster movies apparently aimed at further lobotomizing today's sheepish society, I found this movie quite refreshing. Anyone who gives it a negative review or describes it as ""slow"" obviously did not ""get it"" (too much reality tv?) and clearly chose it only because Kirsten Dunst is in it (in her best performance, in my opinion). It's definitely aimed more toward we existential types and less toward, say, people who want to see a ""feel good"" Kirsten Dunst movie (which, this is most definitely not). The cinematography was breathtaking (truly, like moving art)--particularly in the beginning and end (I love Lars' slow-mo shots). The acting and directing were brilliant. The story line was incredibly poignant and, I think, quite relevant today. We do seem to be spiraling into the depths of shallowness these days. One might almost welcome an otherwise terrifying cataclysmic event to put an end to it all.

Charlotte Gainsbourg is flipping amazing in this movie--as was Kirsten Dunst. I felt quite sorry for Charlotte's character and how she tried, in spite of her own fear, to guide her sister (Dunst's character) through HER anxiety. Kirsten's character's downward spiral was also brilliantly acted. She almost seemed to adopt a sense of complacency toward the end--her way of dealing with the situation. Kiefer Sutherland's blind optimism was also well portrayed. Von Trier did such a great job of highlighting how different people deal with anxiety in different ways. I understand he suffers from depression himself, so this is not foreign territory for his psyche.

In a nutshell, I loved this movie. I've seen it twice and intend to own it. Lars Von Trier gets alot of flack about the controversial nature of his films, but I think he is a true artist--completely unafraid to bare his tormented soul to the world. This one was his masterpiece. If you want a break from the crap that pollutes our movie and tv screens today and have a creative, philosophical mind, I highly recommend Melancholia. Love it or hate it, you won't forget it.",1346457600,9,2212,4.927613941018767

3184873,3,B000VSDNF0,"Reviewed by Amanda Jane Volovik ""Chava"": The 'co-plot' surrounds two sisters who are 'melancholic' and our snapshots into their rich and dysfunctional lives. Of course, the name of the planet is an analogy for the sad atmosphere of the film, no great revelation there. Kirsten Dunst as the bride with a case of Major Depression did okay with the languid, time-stands-still movie style she was given to work with. Her sister, Charlotte Gainsbourg, just has a way about her in every modern movie she's in that's hard to watch, the only place I saw it fit is when she starred in 'Jane Eyre' and other period pieces. Gainsbourg's almost ghostly presence, ready-to-faint vulnerability, and shock-filled, open-mouthed stares in related scenes is so..very...'DONE'. I'm OVER it. I just didn't feel any compassion for Gainsbourg's grating character here - close-up scenes of her angst went on eternally.

***Possible Spoiler Alert***I gave this three stars  because the concept around a planet coming near the earth and its analogy to a family in crisis was quite well done here. I enjoyed the realistic visuals of the planet and its gradual movement, which added suspense. No continuous rain of fireballs coming towards earth or dramatic atmospheric/environmental changes as other movies depict.",1345766400,,1288,5.247572815533981

You can be depressed without being a jerk.  Kirsten Dunst's character is a jerk, who happens to be depressed.  I just wasn't buying the whole ""I'm depressed, my life is terrible, I make bad choices"" thing.  The plot was painfully slow.  Whatever the movie was trying to achieve, I freely admit that I didn't get it.  Hated this movie.",1345766400,5,496,4.556818181818182
3184875,4,B000VSDNF0,"I really wanted to love this movie..... if only I could have actually watched it. I'm one of those wimps that gets motion sick really easily.

I had forgotten that Lars was the guy that did 'Dancer in the Dark' and 'Breaking the Waves'. Both fantastic films, except for that dated hand-held technique. Had to leave the theater on both occasions.

That old passe hand-held thingy that some directors insist on using gets a bit old real quickly (for me). I'm always left wondering if maybe there wasn't enough money in the budget for a tripod?!?

Anyway, for what I was able to see, this was a wonderful film, but certainly not for everyone.

I wonder if they'll come out with a widescreen-tripod version?

3184876,3,B000VSDNF0,"This was an odd sort of movie. Divided into two part, it seemed very disjointed. It had the feeling of being shot with a hand held camcorder. Alexander Skarsgard is in the 1st part but not the 2nd part.  Poorly timed. Some parts dragged on and on and other parts of the movie ran well. Intense musical score makes this feel like a silent movie. If you are a fan of any of the 3 major players you may enjoy the movie.

This movie isn't supposed to make you feel excited or happy. It's pretty much supposed to do the opposite. Anyways, I found the movie to be amazing. It creates a beautiful portrait of depression and it's filled with small details you won't notice till a second watch.

3184879,2,B000VSDNF0,"I saw trailers for this and I was intrigued.  A friend told me she was going to watch it at a small theater in town that plays independent movies.  As somebody who has personally suffered from depression I can say they captured the lethargy and apathy exquisitely.  Only problem is that is captures the lethargy and apathy of depression exquisitely.

Psychologically (and don't take this as gospel as I'm definitely not an authority here), depressed people are the only ones who can appreciate how well they've captured the languid, apathetic drifting that depressed individuals show.  Depressed people don't need to be reminded of how they are depressed.  People who aren't depressed are going to look at this and most likely get depressed.

My first big problem with the movie isn't that she's so readily accepting of their potential fate.  It's that she says it's going to happen.  She knows absolutely without any shadow of a doubt that it's going to happen.  Fascinating.  A main character being introduced with powers of omniscience halfway through the movie.  Then they simply leave it at that.  They ignore that character development and simply expect us to accept that.  The sister doesn't argue the complete incredulity of a statement such as that and the only reinforcement to this claim is that she guessed the number of jellybeans in a jar.  I'm more than capable of suspending my disbelief for cinema, but this one was just a slap in the face.  It felt entirely too forced.  And for what reason?  What possible relevancy did this scene have to the overall plot that she is omniscient?  It's mind boggling.  That's my opinion.  Take that or leave it.

My second problem is the song.  Don't mistake this for a hit on the song.  The song is beautiful.  It's hauntingly somber and fits the theme of the movie perfectly.  They just played it over, and over, and over, and over, and over.  Another scene about the planet?  Play the same exact song we've been pushing the entire movie.  BRILLIANT!

I have to say the final scene was superb.  I genuinely felt scared.  Seeing it in a theater was an amazing experience.

Only problem is when the credits started rolling people started laughing.  A mixture of actually finding the tripe they just wasted their time and money on funny and complete incredulity.  Please, I urge you:  Do not buy this movie.  If you absolutely must watch it out of curiosity find a different source that doesn't include actually spending money on it.

I'm giving this two stars because the overall feel of the movie is actually depressing and because of the ending.  It's just so unbearably boring...",1345248000,7,2634,4.807606263982103

It is like a slow-moving painting and it is a refreshing change in this age where film is chopped into tiny, constantly active pieces.  This film is meant to be savored.

Going by the description, a movie focused on two non-heroic sisters and their breaking/mending relationship is never going to be action packed, it's going to be cerebral. Watch this if you like observing raw thoughts, behvaior, emotions, attachments and a dark/enchanting visual element. It is not a sci-fi movie, but it uses the element in ways I wish more movies would, it stimulates you. It's like looking at a painting, little details unfold the more you look and care about it. Nothing is given to you, you have to try to understand it. If it strikes you as boring from the get-go you won't get much out of it.

But I found this to be a very well-written and well-acted character study. In a lot of movies today (think ""Battleship"") actors do not play characters, they play character types. This film is different in that it gives the sisters' characters a lot of time to develop--Dunst is portraying a person who suffers from manic-depression rather than a ""manic-depressive"", if that distinction makes sense. Let me put it another way--if that distinction does make sense to you, you will probably think this is a 4 or 5-star film. If not, then you won't like it very much. There's nothing wrong with not liking it, of course, but I can't help but believe that this is one of those films that challenges you to think about the implications of the storyline and become involved with the characters--it rewards an engaged viewer rather than a passive one.",1343433600,4,950,4.798780487804878

Why bother with a wedding if you are the type to take a bath when you should be cutting the cake and then screw a temporary coworker after leaving your intended husband? Wow, guy, you really picked the wrong girl. I am open minded, but gosh, there is just no explanation for that kind of behavior, unless we were to say the planet affected her mind. (Maybe it did.)

The director gives the actors the space and they make the most of it.  This will not be a film for everyone, but it as a good a film as I have seen in the last decade with regard to the performances.

3184956,4,B000VSDNF0,"This movie suffers tremendously from the use of what looks like a digital DSLR camera set on auto exposure auto focus and spot metering to shoot just about every scene, and not a very good camera at that.  The post production process was IMHO not done on the digital footage.  The camera man, most likely the same guy shooting everything, sucked and that's putting in kindly.  I'm a photographer and having to watch the movie was very difficult to do, and so I didn't for the most part.  I closed my eyes and listened to it, and opened them to catch some scenes that sounded important to the story line I was listening to, like the shots of the planet Melancholia, and when the dialog called for a snapshot of a scene to attach to the story line.  Truly the most difficult footage I have every tried to watch.  However, the actors give very good performances and their dialog and delivery is spot on.  In fact the script, music score, and sound are actually very good IMHO.  Even the special effects, although not spectacular, were presented well enough to be considered worthy aspects to the presenting and telling to the story, though basic in nature.

The movie has quite a good cast, and I couldn't help but think that everyone of them had to have reservations about doing a movie where only one guy is shooting with a Canon DSLR for every scene... truly unbelievable to me that someone didn't call the directory out on this one and insist that a camera crew be hired to shoot the ""film.""  As it stands, this movie is better enjoyed by listening to the actors present their lines, catch a glimpse of some key scenes, and that way, the very disturbing and distracting cinematography will not take away from the development of the story and the characters as they take the listener down a path of hope for the future, personal conflict and loss of hope, denial, and in the end acceptance.  I wish the concept of moving on to another life was presented, but in this story, there is no afterlife, it's just the end.  This may be why the planet is called Melancholia and everyone that accepts this concept of finality in the end see this a kind of eternal peace.  To me, it's troubling to think such things, and as such, the movie delivers exactly what it set out to do, and that is Melancholia.  Thank goodness I was over it in about 1 minute though :O)

So, 4 stars for the actors, story line, and music and audio, as these were better then ok.  If I could rate the camera work, I give it an F- and wonder what Super 8 film would have looked like instead?  Or, better yet, 16 superwide, or heck, 35mm film!",1342051200,,2607,4.431865828092243
3184957,3,B000VSDNF0,"I'll start with the negative. The movie was overly long and took me three attempts to get through it as it kept putting me to sleep. I would suggest fast forwarding through the whole first part - the failed wedding.

Now for the positive. The movie was visually striking and once you accept it as a psychological commentary, the symbolism becomes apparent. There is a lot more to it than the basic characters. While I agree with one review which commented upon how depressed people might behave more calmly in the face of disaster, I think that review entirely missed the point of the effects of melancholia upon people other than those who suffer directly. For example, the approaching planet, Melancholia, sucked part of the atmosphere away, causing strain and lethargy in everyone. Then there was a scene in which the depressed person beat a horse in an effort to get it to cross a bridge it would not cross. I thought that the horse beating scene was carried out by the wrong character and would have been more fitting for the frustrated Keifer Sutherland when I first thought about it, but on further thought I see that the scene was meant to symbolize the melancholic's failed attempts to act only to try to please others and not break out of despair.

All in all, the movie was rather interesting, which gets the three stars I gave. It has a lasting effect which might take time to sink in. If I had written the review immediately after watching, I would have given it only two stars, but the haunting effect a few days later has led me to see it in a better light.",1341964800,,1572,4.53169014084507

I actually groaned with amazement over just how bad it was in several areas. I'm disappointed with myself that I sat all the way through thinking somehow, at some point, the movie would redeem itself. Never did, not for one moment.

In fact, the only threads between the two are 4 main characters, the setting, and the approaching planet, Melancholia. The first half of the movie features wholly unlikable characters. No one, with the exception of one little boy and the groom, is likable.  It is beautifully photographed, but horribly boring. There is no point, except to discover the characters we thought might be sympathetic aren't, and the sister, Claire, whom we originally dislike, is not what we thought. It also, in some way, ""justifies"" the impending doom of the approaching planet. Why shouldn't there be potential impending doom. The world sucks, right? Clever, no? Well, actually, no. It just blows.

The second half is Claire's story, and the movie should have started here. It is a story of watching her deal with the impending ""fly by"" of Melancholia, while dealing with her sister's crippling depression. It is still difficult to watch, mainly because every second you will want to drown Justine in the bath. If you skip ""Justine"" and go straight to ""Claire,"" it's worth a viewing.

Listen, the film is slow and methodical; it is at times ""boring"" for the attention deficit disordered American viewer.  The film is shot with an eye to beauty and the psychological.  If you want entertainment, Melancholia is melancholic but if you desire a poignant, philosophical film that asks and answers (perhaps not to your liking nor my worldview) questions like: Is there any point to life? Not really. Is there ""anyone"" out there beyond our world that cares about our planet? No. We are alone and responsible for our own destiny.  In short, this film is not for the Ipoder, Ipader, and IM'ing person, who needs immediate gratification. Rather, it is for thinking, patient, open-minded, and those who appreciate not the run-of-the-mill science fiction/philosophical/psychological films.  By the by, Ms. Dunst puts in a fine performance, showing that when all is failing, depressives might have the ""upper"" hand.  She is very convincing as a person with a serious mental disorder (as defined by Western psychiatry); as the environment approaches the abyss, and the end nears she becomes less and less disturbed, suggesting that there a real strength in a being depressive.",1341273600,6,1276,5.2

Not only was he depressed but I am now depressed for having wasted the time and money (all 1.99 of it at redbox) to tolerate this ""movie"".  Not only is it not entertaining but it doesn't really even have much of a visual value. There are a few decent shots here or there but for the most part the cinematography is quite boring.

She's profoundly depressed.

3184981,1,B000VSDNF0,"This movie in a word: portentous. Unfortunately, the creators seemed see this as a good thing. There is an old guard in art, born from a time when the average man was poorer, and art was less ""high"" art was less refined in the working class. This old guard seems to believe that they see that which others do not. They believe that their tiny revelations are of particular interest or note. The idea that ""depressed people do not react as strongly to bad news because they expect is evidently overly simplistic. They often do not react strongly because depression is the very often the clinical term for an extreme case of ennui--people just stop caring. So in this case, it would not be that they expect it, but rather that they just don't care.

To take such a simple idea and spread it so thin over so little is either an insult to the intelligence of the general public or evidence of the film's creator's our intellectual deficiencies that led them to believe that their ideas were so profound as to justify this tedious tinsel.

3184994,3,B000VSDNF0,"Melancholia is an apocalyptic-drama that focuses on themes like death and depression. The story is split into two parts named after the two sisters, Justine and Claire. It's a story about their relationship and what happens to it as a new planet threatens to destroy Earth. Overall, the film left me with mixed emotions and I was left in the middle.

What did I like about the film? Melancholia is shot beautifully! The first 8 minutes of the film is composed of several shots of the characters in slow motion in beautiful environments. Not only that, but the story is original and deep. Although I personally dislike most of Part 1: Justine, Part 2: Claire is a powerful drama with immersive dialogue between characters leading to a sad but beautiful ending. Also, the acting was fine and the music was amazing!

What didn't I like? Melancholia sadly overstays its welcome. As I previously stated, the first part was too long and almost pointless. It did take time to develop characters and set-up the second part of the film, but I felt like it took way too long to do so. It was okay, but I'm afraid for some moviegoers the first part will cause boredom. It probably could've been cut and half and still be as affective as it was; cutting in half probably would've created a generally more enjoyable experience.

Do I recommend Melancholia? For people who absolutely love all types of film, like me, I definitely recommend checking it out. If you're a casual moviegoer and you want to see what the hype is about, here's what I recommend: Watch the first 8 minutes, watch some of part 1 (or read about it beforehand and skip it completely), and enjoy the magnificent second part.

3185020,1,B000VSDNF0,"There's a big difference between Art and Story. The two do not necessarily preclude each other, but in movies, filmmakers tend to favor the latter over the former. This has resulted in wave upon wave of horrible film, granted. However, favoring the former over the latter hasn't resulted in any great shakes, either. In fact, both extremes often end with bewildered or annoyed audiences. However, when a story-based film fails, detractors have a much better time of it, because you can point to plot holes, inconsistent or incomplete characters, cheesy dialogue, or pure cliche. When an ""artsy"" film fails, however, the explosive force between its fans and haters gains extra force because, bottom line, it comes down to taste. Likewise with this film. It has as many glowing reviews as nasty reviews, and the bottom line isn't about the beauty, artistry, or skill of the film. It's about whether or not you believe depression can be an art form. I do not.

MELANCHOLIA, as a film, is almost exactly what it sounds like. It is a 136-minute-long gaze at depression. And that's it. Seriously. No, seriously.

Do you want a story? Well, fine then. How about this? A sister planet to Earth is discovered. It is named Melancholia (oooh!) and it is headed straight for Earth. If the two planets collide, then the entire human race is doomed. Also, a girl is getting married and she's very sad. The end.

Does it seem like I'm exaggerating? I am absolutely not. Kirsten Dunst plays one of the most annoying characters of her career (and that's saying a lot). She is part of a wealthy family on a wealthy estate that is holding a wealthy wedding between her and some other wealthy people. Inexplicably, she's depressed beyond words. The movie never explains why. ""Why"" is not the film's motif. Instead, it patiently and lovingly follows its tortured heroine as she weeps, falls motionless to the floor, or goes and sleeps with total strangers on her wedding night. Because she's so, so, so sad, you see.

This is art?

I'll admit, Lars Von Trier IS an artist, but if this is what he's going to apply his skill to, then I want none of it. The movie begins with a pastiche of ultra-slow-motion images set to classical music. I didn't time this section, but it seemed to last nearly twenty minutes (I'm almost certainly wrong). I thought every image was gorgeous and stunning, and I immediately knew that I was going to hate the film. Why? Because it announced, at the start, that it was EXCLUSIVELY about the lavishness of the imagery. Even that I could stand if I didn't have to endure another two hours of a pretty and entitled girl crying for absolutely no reason whatsoever. C'mon, Lars! Make it about a short order cook or an oil rig worker or a fifty-year old divorcee with diabetes. Characters with complexity and powerful lives -- these are people I might be able to handle roiling in self-pity for 120 minutes. A disaffected girl who might just be too rich and coddled? Please.

I did some research, desperate to understand why such a dismal wreck would ever be conceived, let alone put to film, and I read that Lars wanted to show multiple facets of depression. In other words, he wanted to show the good and the bad, how depression might be useful or workable under certain circumstances. How could that be? Well, it turns out that it is useful to be skilled at depression when the world is going to end. End of Deep Important Message.

SPOILERS AHEAD!

Yes. The world ends in the film, and part of Lars' message (if the interview is to be believed) is that Dunst's character's familiarity with abiding ennui made her especially suited to enduring the destruction of mankind. This is about the most ridiculous point a film could make, since the utter destruction of mankind renders moot the way any humans deal with it. Who freaking cares if someone deals with Earth's obliteration with suicide, grace and aplomb, selfish weeping, or some kind of drug-fueled orgy? In the end, you're left with one thing: the utter obliteration of mankind. For crying out loud, is this some kind of deep, insightful message?

I'm sorry. I probably sound bitter. I guess I am. I only bought and watched this movie after the endless praise it received from critics and friends, and when I returned to said friends with less-than-glowing remarks, I was told that I lacked patience, cared more about commercialism, or was too easily bored.

Nah. I like my movies to be about things. And if they're going to travel the path of artistic flair, I'd still like that art -- beautiful or not -- to teach me something either a) new, b) interesting, or c) profound. MELANCHOLIA's message is absolutely NONE of those things, and I will gladly debate anyone who says otherwise. You can film sadness as gorgeously as you want, but if the sadness is prompted by nothing, propelled by nothing, and ends in nothing, then the end result is exactly the same: a big, fat, zero.",1339372800,132,4940,4.707175925925926

*A rogue planet, Melancholia, is going to crash into earth. Turns out there are a lot unattached planets roaming the Milky Way. While it is highly unlikely that this would happen, improbable isn't the same as impossible.
*The hyperbolic trajectory that was shown when a character googles the planet is realistic. Even the last sequence where Melancholia turns and reverses itself on its last approach could be consistant with Melancholia's trajectory.
*The planet isn't Earth-sized but Neptune-sized. Interestingly the Solar System may have lost a similar sized planet early in the formation of the system. Luckily the film didn't make this claim, that would be unbelievable, to say the least.
*The planet was blue. Again, being in interstellar space would mean the atmosphere had cooled to a couple degrees above absolute zero. A gas giant would closely resemble Neptune which is deep blue.
*When one of the characters takes a close up look through a telescope, the atmosphere is roiling. The frigid planet had passed close enough to the Sun to heat the atomsphere up causing the atmosphere to literally boil.
The only problem was Melancholia had no moons, planets this size would--however, that might be not be a disqualifier because we don't know anything, yet, about exoplanets and the moon systems. Other than rumbling, a planet around the size of Uranus or Neptune would cause a massive amount of earthquakes and other tidal effects during the first passing.

I also liked how this enormous event played out in the lives of the protagonists. Undoubtedly, people would have only a vague understanding of planetary astronomy. There were no panic because up to the end everyone thought Melancholia would pass them by. When it became understood that Earth and Melancholia would collide did people resign themselves to their impending death. No crusading scientist was going to save humanity. Unlike ""Knowing"", the film maker didn't resort to supernatural/alien intervention to give the movie a ""happy"". American ending. Realistically, there is nothing, given this is set in the present, anyone could do. A cold planet, as opposed to a star, would be difficult to detect. Everyone dies. Period.

3185064,5,B000VSDNF0,"DO NOT bother reading the synopsis for this movie, which talks about a wedding being ruined by the impending approach of a planet.  This is NOT what this movie is about.  Whoever wrote the synopsis did not watch the movie.  This movie is a study into how different individuals handle an impending catastrophe.  If you are interested in the human psyche you will enjoy this movie. If you can relate to or are interested in the study of overwhelming depression, you will like this movie.  This is not a lighthearted ""wedding threatened by impending doom"" sci-fi or girl bonding movie as the synopsis would imply.

The movie is broken into two parts featuring two sisters.  The first sister is profiled at her wedding and we soon see her struggle with overwhelming depression.  She describes at one point how it feels like large heavy cords of gray yarn are wrapped about her feet, making it very difficult for her to keep moving forward.  This is an analogy to how depression makes one feel in that even the simplest act of walking forward feels like you are mired in quicksand.  Throughout the exhaustingly long wedding reception the sister struggles to keep up a front of normalcy.  There are a few things she does that seem atypical of depression, but perhaps they were thrown in for artistic effect, whatever that means.  I have no opinion regarding the complaints of confusing symbolism and overly arty feel of the movie.  These things must have a greater impact on more sophisticated minds than mine, because my focus was the relate-ability of the characters.  I do not want to reveal any spoilers by giving away what ultimately happens at the wedding, but I think I'm safe in saying that it is understandable how someone would not want to inflict their pain on another.

The second part of the movie focuses on the sister who is not suffering from depression, but perhaps has a bit of a problem with anxiety.  It's interesting to note that the sister trying to take care of and help her depressed sibling, is also being protected from the truth regarding the upcoming cosmological event.  It's fascinating to see the calm demeanor of the depressed sibling as disaster looms ahead, because the end of the world is not the end of the world to her.  She is beyond caring about the struggle to continue living.  She impassively watches her sister spiral further out of control and into panic.  It is not uncaring dispassion, she has just become deadened to emotional pain.  And it is the depressed sister who helps her frightened nephew and sister through the final moments of the disaster.

Highly recommend if you are interested in a study of human behavior as described above.  There are a few bits that could be left out of the movie, but overall, I've yet to see a more interesting study of character in a fiction film.  The few bits of weirdness are OK with me as this seems more real to me, because life can be weird, than something that is perfectly made.  I can't think of any other movie that I have been able to relate to like this one.  And that's why I'm giving it 5 stars.

It seems like a group of foreign students were given an assignment of: ""Make a movie using the concept of a new earth-like planet being discovered in our solar system that had been hiding behind the sun."" Both Melancholia and a movie called Another Earth use this premise. Both are independent films. Both use shaky handheld cameras and the zoom feature where the picture temporarily goes out of focus as they zoom in for a close up. (I think only the Blair Witch Project made sense with that type of filming, since it was about students doing a documentary.) Neither Melancholia nor Another Planet were very good as they come across as amateurish.

Melancholia loses clarity in its attempt to be clever. The introduction of Melancholia is artsy, but it simply isn't clear what it's supposed to be (a dream?, a flashback?, a prediction?, a depressed person's thoughts?, the ending of the movie shown first?).

Then the movie breaks down into 2 parts, but it was difficult to understand at first whether part 1 took place before part 2 or part 2 was supposed to take place before part 1, since the movie opened with the dream/flashback/ending part. Some movies like Pulp Fiction (great movie BTW) jump around out of sequence and characters who were killed earlier are alive showing a different part of the story. Again, Melancholia is unclear.

Part 1 involves a wedding reception, which has some interesting character conflict, but then it stops and introduces Part 2. More confusion. It is not apparent as to whether the time is pre-reception or post-reception or both with the reception itself skipped. Part 2 involves how the characters react to circumstances beyond their control, involving the new planet concept, which isn't mentioned in part 1.

Also, Keifer Sutherland's character reaction in Part 2 comes across as unlikely for the character he's playing. His family would have been involved in the choice he made.

Anyway, most people think the ending was the best part, probably because *SPOILER ALERT* everyone is put out of their misery including the audience.",1337817600,11,2095,4.9714285714285715

3185068,1,B000VSDNF0,"There are apocalyptic movies with a philosophical, psychological, or political message; some of them are entertaining, others depressing.  Good SciFi is based on new ideas about the future of humanity, about the role of technology, about the fate of humanity, or sometimes just new stories and new characters that have never been imagined before.  Acceptable SciFi may simply put classical stories into a future context, allowing us to enjoy old stories anew.

Melancholia is none of those things.  The most advanced technology in it is a bent coat hanger.  Its notion about the future of humanity is that of a dysfunctional, depressed family dying pointlessly.  Melancholia is merely a beautifully shot but otherwise uninspired and pointless movie, a reflection of von Trier's own depressed state of mind, his fears and phobias.

But if you're a fictionhead--someone deeply interested in the deceits and values of fiction--Melancholia is a five-star film. In this regard, it's on par with Drugstore Cowboy, High Art, Wings of Desire, Trainspotting and The Virgin Suicides. And within shouting distance of cinema's all-time best rumination on the meaning of fiction, The Third Man.

Why? Because Melancholia is about endings and nothing but. Charlotte Rampling introduces herself with a bridge-burning interruption of an inept toast. There's nowhere for her character to go two minutes after she appears. Ditto for her ex, who's crushed on arrival by her interruption. Stellan Skarsgaard's character is set up as the archvillain, then sent packing along with the other would-be antagonists (the  paramour, the business partners, and  the mother) halfway through what usually amounts to the first act in a feature film.

It matters that the man of finance, order and science (the brother-in-law) miscalculates with a glib, unsatisfying nod to the uncertainty principle, then winds up kicked in the head by a horse. It matters too that the earnest, tender characters--the groom and the sister--are unfailingly inarticulate and/or dead wrong when it counts, because they both want storytelling progressions (gestures that suggest hope for the future, and actions that improve on the present) that the premise of the film won't tolerate.

The constraint of that premise is why Kirsten Dunst swings from confection to wrecking ball in a few implausible filmed minutes--she ruins her world on her wedding night, quickly devolving from picture-perfect high society bride to washed-out bedhead gloomy girl who can't be bothered to wear makeup or flattering clothes. The first suggestion of the film is that she's right to have imploded--when the end is undeniable, that fact crowds out any fiction, regardless of motive.

But the second suggestion of Melancholia matters more, I think, though it arrives only in the last minutes of the film.

When the total resignation of Dunst's Justine has overtaken her sister Clare (and yes, look at those names again, and consider their blood ties), the spell of facts and hopelessness is broken by the fear of Clare's little boy, and the love both women have for him. The three join together to create one last fiction--one that gives them something to do in the final hours. It brings them together across generational, intellectual, and spiritual divides, in spite of their physical circumstances. The child may be assuaged by an illusion of hope, but the women, who have been at odds for the entire film, come to the same place in the end: it was bad fiction (not fiction itself) that led them astray. Their final act of imagination is a meaningful one, because the two women (for once) conjure it for all the right reasons. And the film ends beautifully and tragically, with the idea that fiction matters most when reality holds all the cards. What Clare and Justine give themselves and the child isn't denial, transcendence or control, but a way of putting themselves in accord with the end. Imagination brings them peace.

If you're a fictionhead, the way this film gets where it wants to go demands repeat viewings. Get Melancholia.",1337212800,27,3518,5.136363636363637

3185094,2,B000VSDNF0,"I read a number of reviews which made it sound as though Melancholia presented an interesting and well-written interpretation of how a depressive perspective affects the response to situations that might cause other people to panic.  I'll explain why I was profoundly disappointed.

This is true for the last ten minutes or so of the film.  The rest has very little to do with depression, and although as some reviewers have noted, there is some impressive craftsmanship and the visuals are striking from the standpoint of cinematography, the writing of the characters is, in my opinion, trite and awful.  Based on my own experience of clinical depression, the main character's depression ends up taking a back seat to her being an awful person about halfway through the movie; depression, like any other traumatic experience, does not actually cause people to behave awfully.

The movie obviously wants her to be sympathetic, by surrounding her with awful people and then presenting her in a quasi-mystical role akin to a postmodern version of the Mad Prophet, but she turns out at the most crucial moments to be steeped in unnecessary and pointless cruelty.  Her character seems less like a depressed person, and more like how depressed people are seen by people who don't understand them, lashing out and committing self-destructive acts ""at random.""  Combined with all the rest of the characters, with one or two exceptions, this makes the film seem like it's just one more brick in the wall of the postmodern paradigm: that everyone is awful, despicable, and crazy, and that adults throwing tantrums at one another like small children equals depth.

The two stars are for the cinematography.  There are some beautiful visuals, especially in the beginning, although most of them end up having practically nothing to do with the actual events of the movie; this is a shame, since it probably would have been a better one.  It gets a bit TOO slow in places, but the patient building of atmosphere is expertly accomplished.  If the writing hadn't been yet another offensively awful case of pandering to postmodern anti-humanist sensibilities, it would have been at least four stars.",1337040000,5,2183,5.052924791086351

""Melancholia"" (2011)
--------------------------------
When this film was in theaters, I heard several critics complain about director Lars Von Trier's misanthropy and cruelty towards his characters, and how this end-of-the-world epic was a mega-bummerfest with no sense of redemption and a contempt for the audience and the human race in general... etc., etc.  It's true that this is not the most cheerful of films, but mostly it struck me as being solidly in the Euro art-house tradition of Berman, Fellini, et al. The first third of the film is taken up with an ensemble performance in which a high-society wedding goes horribly wrong, and this sequence in particular seemed studiously set in that art-film tradition -- a dark comedy of errors, packed with character details and observations that are both measured and abrasive. Nothing new here - nor anything particularly explosive. It's depressing, but not earth-shattering. Oh, pardon the pun... The rest of the film deals with the aftermath of the party, going small and closing in on the narrow family dynamics of two sisters at the center of the drama, which we discover is set in the backdrop of a metaphor-laden, moon-sized asteroid headed on a collision course with Earth. Yes, Lars Von Trier destroys the planet, and perhaps he does so with glee, but there is an evocative, imaginative element to this apocalypse, and it is nowhere near as repellant or pointless as the rape scene in his earlier work, ""Breaking The Waves,"" a movie that I actively detest.

Though slow-moving and ponderous, this film is worth watching... It won't scar you for life, and isn't quite as horrifying (or as significant) as you may have been led to believe... It's certainly not the end of the world. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1336953600,4,1811,5.135593220338983

As some other Amazon reviewers have noted, ""Melancholia"" is best experienced on the big screen (""Big & Loud"", to paraphrase one reviewer) especially for the opening & closing sequences.  Despite its imperfections, there is a logical arc of progression contained within this film, that can be summarized as follows: (1) the Prelude / Premonition / Dance of Death between the Planets; (2) the Wedding, The Sisters, The Gradual Disappearance of Everyone besides 3 Principal Characters; & (3) the Simultaneously Horrifying & Moving Ending.  The conclusion of ""Melancholia"" reminded me, once again, that the Cruel Cosmos, as well as Amoral Mother Nature, do not care whether we humans exist or not and will roll over us like a steamroller on a whim.  Other Amazon reviewers have compared this film to ""The Tree of Life"", but frankly, TOL was a Disney-esque experience compared to ""Melancholia"".  Despite its being controversial (controversy coming naturally to Von Trier, the button-pushing provocateur) I also enjoyed LVT's previous outing, ""Antichrist"".  ""Antichrist"" made me realize that Von Trier seems to have entered his masterwork phase.

My theory about the intensely dismissive and negative reactions to ""Melancholia"" by many other Amazon reviewers is this: If one does not want to deal with subject matter that is deep, disturbing, metaphorical, mystifying & symbolic -- One won't like this film.  Apparently all those 1-star reviewers who wanted their money back were angry about having been seduced by a concept, that could have offered them a poetic & visionary representation of a potentially frightening reality.  And so this picture is a love-it-or-hate-it experience, as is to be expected from any great work of art built on a definitive & insightful point of view.  Secondly, a familiarity with / taste for European film is advised before viewing this film, given the differences of sensibility, imagery and pacing between European and American cinema.  For instance, I'm not the biggest fan of Andrei Tarkovsky, but anyone who had seen his pictures before having seen ""Melancholia"" would be better equipped to deal with its slow pace.  In closing, although I have previously heard ""Tristan & Isolde"" & other music by Wagner utilized in the scores of films by various directors (Chabrol, Francis Ford Coppola, Fassbinder, Fellini) -- Von Trier's use of ""Tristan & Isolde"" in both the opening & closing of ""Melancholia"" was genius.  Thus the comparisons made to the equally brilliant opening of Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" are completely justified.

3185115,2,B000VSDNF0,"In spite of my love for (some of) Von Trier's movies, I don't hesitate to call this one plain disappointing. It has some very beautiful shots, but the movie simply fails in all respects where it's supposed to bring something to the table. (1) A strained relationship between two sisters: obvious, but incredibly poor, imitation of one of Bergman's favorite topics (which he so masterfully portrays in Silence and Cries and Whispers). (2) Depression: inconsistent, inaccurate, immature portrayal of bipolar/depression (it's not even clear what he's going for here). (3) Apocalypse and human fear: once again, a lame picture, much better portrayed in many other apocalyptic movies.

Where the movie is supposed to be ""artistic"", it comes across as juvenile and pretentious, which is rather unexpected from an experienced director like Von Trier. The opening slow motions remind you more of a freshman's work of cinematography, and the poor development of characters offers nothing to back it up.

In general, a disappointing movie from a respectable director.",1336521600,2,1057,5.323353293413174

3185120,1,B000VSDNF0,"This movie is stupid. Plain and simple. It followed the silly trend of 2012- the world is coming to an end and everyone is doomed to damnation. When I watched it- I couldn't figure out what point they were trying to get across. The movie seemed to be broken up into several different themes. When it came on, I had to fast forward through the first 5-7 minutes because it was nothing but special effects and graphics. Then the movie progresses into a love story about 2 people who appear to be very much in love getting married. After another 30 minutes or so, the bride appears to be depressed and regretful about her decision to marry her husband. She even goes so far as to make sexual advances and then reject her husband. To carry the nonsense even further, she goes outside and has the weirdest looking sex I have ever seen with some strange dude right outside of the wedding reception.  WTH???!!!Meanwhile there is this big wedding party going on. No one seems to notice. The bride then makes these disappearances from her wedding party several times (she takes a bath, she tucks her nephew in, etc.). Clearly she's depressed. However, the focus on this depressed bride took way too long. Then suddenly the wedding reception that last forever is over, and the bride comes back to her sister's house in a cab- hubby no where in sight. One can only assume that she left him. She comes back to her sister's house to mope. Then they bring up the topic of this magical melancholia. Everyone is super calm about it- there's no news, radio. The closest we can get to this is the bride's sister  and her son looking it up on the internet. Again, no one seems to be terribly panicked. Meanwhile, the sister of bride's husband (Sutherland) is a scientist who keeps the truth from his family. He lies continuously throughout the remainder of the film. As time draws near for this ""melancholia"" to take place he decides to be a punk and eat some type of poisonous pill-leaving his family to find out the truth on their own. Meanwhile-the bride is not so depressed anymore. She becomes psychic, and is a nudist at one point during the film; while her sister begins to unravel and lose their mind. The bride becomes so powerful that she helps everyone become at peace with their destiny. There is no attempt of any kind to make contact with family members or other loved ones. Other than the sister of the bride having a mini spaz- everyone is fine and having a jolly good time. Yes ladies and gentlemen, we are all about to perish - yet you've entered the twilight zone. If they would've spent as much money developing the story as they did wasting it on graphics this would have been a superb film. However they did not- so people like me who wanted to see a good movie, wasted their time and money. The film makes no sense. If the film wanted melancholia- they sure got it. That's what I felt when I turned it off.  It's too bad amazon won't let me give zero or negative stars, because that's what this film deserves.",1336262400,4,3013,4.494525547445256

3185134,2,B000VSDNF0,"1.  The title is fitting as it describes the condition of the two sisters played by Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainesbourgh, but more so Dunst who is suffering from a depression ridden mental disorder and destroys any chance at happiness for her marriage on her wedding day.  You almost feel sorry for her, but can't quite completely do it.  She was far more sympathetic as Lux in the movie Virgin Suicides, which makes me believe that she and Sofia Coppola need to work together again.  They are a winning team when it comes to art films about women.

2.  Melancholia is the name of the planet headed on a collision course for earth.  Though Gainesbourgh's character's husband played by Kieffer Sutherland has assured her that the planet will not hit and go around, we find out he discovers he was wrong in one of the most selfish acts a person could do to his family, which made me really angry with him.

3.  Melancholia is exactly what you will feel as you sit through the entire 2 hours and 15 minutes of this depressing  film that tries hard to be art.  The beginning is beautiful, slow, colorful shots set to the background of classical music that is almost worth watching the movie for at all.  Other than that, this movie is slower than the intro, dreary, dismal, and makes you sad to see how Dunst's character is the stronger one in the end, taking charge of the situation as disaster looms.

This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but I wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to anybody I know.  As much as I like the actors who were cast, this movie is simply not that great.  I think next time Dunst makes an art film, she should reunite with Sofia Coppola, as I've said before.  Their chemistry as actress and director is spot on, so I recommend both Virgin Suicides and Marie Antoinette.  The movies are both depressing as well, but they're what I would call true art.",1336089600,4,1889,4.492668621700879

The movie is SAD because it gives the message that life on this fallen planet is all there is. This is one of the biggest lies humans believe. THe truth is that there is God creator and God is spirit who is personal and created us in his image, male and female. When we die and leave our physical bodies, our souls and spirits don't just rest. Our lives are not meaningless. If they were, there would be no morale. We exist because of something greater than ourselves. We don't exist to exist. That is impossible.

3185137,4,B000VSDNF0,"I've never been a fan of Danish director Lars Von Trier. I think it was due in large part to the cast that ""Melancholia"" kept my interest, but I must admit that I enjoyed the film. It's not possible to spoil it, as we see the ending before anything else. For eight minutes, we watch the Earth collide with the gas giant planet Melancholia, that was somehow set loose from its own solar system and hurtled into ours, to Wagner's Prelude to ""Tristan and Isolde"". Then, we see Part One, in which the neurotic and chronically melancholic advertising copywriter Justine (Kirsten Dunst) attends her wedding reception with new husband Michael (Alexander Skarsgard) at an expansive country estate owned by her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and brother-in-law John (Kiefer Sutherland).

Part Two takes place some months later, as Claire and John, an amateur astronomer, wait for Melancholia to pass by the Earth and give them a spectacular view. Claire is not so sure, though, that Melancholia will pass by safely. Justine, in the meanwhile, has fallen into a severe depression, and Claire has her out to the house in hopes of promoting recovery.

Justine's inability to cope with much of anything makes her insufferably self-absorbed. I didn't think that I was going to have much patience for her. But, between Kirsten Dunst's shining performance and Manuel Alberto Claro's impulsive camera, the audience is pulled into Justine's perspective in Part One. It even makes Claire, who is perfectly reasonable and tolerant, seem like she is imposing on her sister. And I had to like the cocksure John, who refused to put up with his equally self-absorbed and insufferable mother-in-law Gaby (Charlotte Rampling). Part Two is more about Claire's world and the thing that she will find impossible to cope with.

I'm not surprised that Von Trier would ignore simple issues of place and consistency, or flout them deliberately. But I wondered more than once where this film takes place. A mostly American family with some English staff on an apparently European country estate. But all the guests speak English. And why does one sister speak with an English accent while the other speaks with an American accent? ""Melancholia"" was filmed in Sweden, but I don't imagine it was intended to take place there. Von Trier treats time and place like abstractions. I never did discover the significance of the 19th hole on the golf course, among other oddities. It probably doesn't have any. ""Melancholia"" doesn't seem to be about anything in particular, but it is entrancing at times.

The DVD (Magnolia 2012): There are 5 featurettes and 2 theatrical trailers (2 min each). ""About Melancholia"" (12min) interviews the cast, director, and a psychologist about the ideas behind the film, themes, and characters. ""Visual Effects"" (7 min) is about the rogue planet and the collision of planets. ""The Visual Style"" (10 min) interviews Lars Von Trier, director of photography Manuel Alberto Claro about the camera work, and visual effects supervisor Peter Hjoth. ""The Universe"" (4 min) interviews Peter Hjoth and astrophysicist Michael J D Linden-Vrnle about the science behind the film. ""HDNet: A Look at Melancholia"" (5 min) is a publicity spot incorporating interview clips from the bonus features.

3185138,2,B000VSDNF0,"2.5 if you care.

Melancholia is undeniably a gorgeous film, the images of space are beautiful, the scenery is beautiful, Kirsten Dunst's breasts were beautiful, the music was beautiful, and especially the first ten minutes of slow motion was especially breathtaking. The concept was interesting too, a severely depressed character has an opposite reaction compared to the 'happy' and 'balanced' people in her lives when they are thrust into two emotionally contrasting events, a visual aid for the concept would be a yin-yang symbol.

But when it comes to the plot Lars Von Trier again struggles to maintain the audience's interest. Here he splits the film into two chapters, the first half is called Justine and and shows Justine(Kirsten Dunst) is depressed, and it's effecting the people around her during her own wedding dinner to the point where the whole wedding unravels by the end of the night, which was really boring to watch when it shouldn't have been. Who are these people aqain? Why are we supposed to care about Justine's passive aggressive temper tantrum? For someone who's actually depressed, Lars sure doesn't know how to convey it well in film. The whole wedding dinner experience is like being stuck in a distant cousin's wedding where you don't know/care about anyone there and you can't drink.

Another bad decision on Lar's part was the camera work, it looks like the camera-man suddenly became violently ill and started puking while trying to hold the camera on the scene, and it just looks like a disaster. Was this supposed to be a hand-held Cloverfield knock-off? I'm not sure if it was supposed to be 'artsy' or 'cute' but it was just a pointless distraction from the already uninteresting story. After seeing the first ten minutes this part was quite a letdown.

Thankfully the second half picks things up, this time revolving around Justine's sister Claire in the chapter named (you guessed it) Claire. Claire realizes along with the rest of the family that an asteroid aptly named ""Melancholia"" is on course for Earth, and is days away from global annihilation. Each of the characters kind of reacts in their own way, the most peculiar being Justine, knowing that everyone's doom is imminent she becomes strangely calm while Claire is frantically struggling to escape certain doom along with her daughter. The second half is a bit more interesting, but still there wasn't really a sense of dread set up. I couldn't really relate or care about any of these characters, the only really interesting aspect about the story is again seeing how one of the characters with depression cope with marriage and death. At it's best, Melancholia is both beautiful and emotionally devastating (you really have to meet Lars half way to get that out of Melancholia) and at it's worst is bloated and pretentious.

Lars Von Trier has a good visual eye, but his screenwriting and editing are sloppy. Lars could've easily cut down the length or add more to what's going on. But like Antichrist Lars sure loves to have his characters depressed, but he hasn't really found a way to convey it. Unlike Antichrist there is more going on here and there's a real sense of beauty to it all that doesn't have to resort to unnecessary and dumb gore.

It's worth mentioning that the director conceited this film while in therapy for depression, the main actress Kirsten Dunst has openly admitted to suffering from depression, and the whole film revolves around how depression effects everyone, so I'd only recommend this film to people interested in depression.",1335916800,3,3561,4.946488294314381

When I finally got to Part 2, I thought to myself, ""this movie needs to decide what it is."" The long opening seems unrelated to the synopsis of the movie. Parts 1 and 2 are like disjointed ""he said, she said"" stories.

There is much to like about this movie. The performances are top notch, as is the photography, sets, effects, etc. All very professionally produced.

3185159,5,B000VSDNF0,"The problem with rating something like this is that the movie is so unique, so eccentric, and so enigmatic that it will really only appeal to a narrow subset of viewers.  Those who appreciate von Trier's unique style--which serves (among all the movies I've ever seen) as an unparalleled vehicle for both emotional and intellectual impact--will LOVE this movie...those who, perhaps understandably, do not appreciate such a strange style, will either hate it or find it to be somewhat intriguing in a few ways but mostly a waste of time.  The number of stars is misleading--3 stars suggests that it's a pretty good movie, when in reality there are many who love it and many who hate it; most people either gave it a 5 or a 1.

I can try to explain why I love it, but I'm  going to be purposefully vague because I think too many specifics could negatively alter one's attitude going into the movie (if the expectations I've set haven't already)--if nothing else, it's the kind of movie that you want to experience in your own way.  It certainly gets under your skin--I couldn't stop thinking about it for many days after seeing it, and it still comes into my head quite often.  As I suggested above, it is both emotionally intense and intellectually challenging.  The movie is also very strange, but if you're open-minded this can be a wonderful thing.  It operates on several different levels--there is a lot of deep symbolism but there is also a lot of strong emotion right on the surface.  It's the kind of movie that might have a major impact on you...if you let it.

To that end, make sure that you watch it under the right circumstances.  As I said, it's emotionally intense, so make sure you're in the mood for that.  Also, I would recommend watching it ALONE.  Or, if you do watch it with someone, make sure it's someone you're very close to.  Someone else could easily respond negatively or create a kind of tension that would make it harder for you to explore your own thoughts and feelings.  It also wouldn't hurt to turn the lights off and have a drink (but not too much).

I should also mention that the acting and dialogue are fantastic.  I'm not even a fan of Kirsten Dunst, but she does an excellent job in this film.  All of the actresses and actors do.  Another Lars von Trier movie I love (and one that also has truly amazing acting) is Dogville, which is also probably a decent gauge for whether or not you would be turned off by Melancholia.  I'm not suggesting that Dogville and Melancholia are particularly alike (though there are quite interesting similarities), but if you have seen Dogville and appreciated it, then you will probably be able to appreciate Melancholia.

BOTTOM LINE:
-It's one of the best movies I personally have seen, though opinions (unsurprisingly) vary wildly
-It's quite strange and unique (in a very good way), so if that in and of itself is a turn-off, you might not want to watch
-Watch it by yourself (or with someone very close) and when you're in the mood for something quite intense and heavy

3185160,3,B000VSDNF0,"I don't have anything against 'art films', and Von Trier's last outing, ""Anti-Christ"", wasn't all that bad.  As with ""Anti-Christ"", ""Melancholia"" mixes myths and modern psychology.  The idea of a planet behind the sun is actually part of the Mayan myth of the end of the world, where the planet is called Nbiru.  Both of these last Von Trier movies have been strongly compared to Ingmar Bergman, too.  The wedding scenes in ""Melancholia"" do bear comparison to Bergman... revealing very uptight upper crust people who behave like aristocrats.

In Bergman's ""Cries and Whispers"", the filmmaker supposedly styled his movie after the paintings of Edvard Munch.  Von Trier, in ""Melancholia"", seems to be imitating Paul Delvaux, or some postmodernist like P.J Crook.  So, the large nocturnal scenes in the movie are stunning visually, and haunting, and there are other great shots, like an overhead of two women riding through great clouds of morning mist.  Visually then, the movie is a triumph.

But too much of the rest of it is just annoying.  Jerky movements by hand-held cameras.  Swooning Wagner music, over and over.  Annoying ""geiger counter"" noise, for arty effect.  Annoying symbolic impasses at tiny woodland bridge.  Troubled horses.  Characters and situations that seem to be made up out of thin air.  Who are these people?  Does anyone care?

There are good actors completely wasted who just wander through a few scenes-- I'm thinking of John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling.  If you are only interested in style, or if you are a fan of  Matthew Barney's pretensions, then this is a good film for you.  But if you seriously like movies in which the actors aren't just colliding against each other for dubious reasons, look elsewhere.",1335744000,3,1738,5.028070175438597

3185187,5,B000VSDNF0,"Ever since Lars von Trier learned from his mother the truth about his origins, that the father who raised him wasn't his biological father, the Danish director has decided from that day forth to orientate his movies on a quest for honest storytelling and sincere emotions, something that his family always condemned. Starting from the Kingdom, then getting international recognition with Breaking the Waves all the way up to Antichrist, all of Lars' movies have worked on this quest for truth, but also on a mission to move viewers in ways that many would find either pleasant and enriching, or unpleasant and disagreeable.

And this is exactly what happens with Melancholia, as Lars once again confronts the Science-Fiction genre rules and stereotypes, and adds human psychology. Instead of conforting us with the usual end-of-the world story told through the eyes of the scientists, military and space agency who try to do everything they can to stop a fly-by from destroying Earth on the third or fourth of July, Lars has decided to show us this end of the world through two sisters, Claire and Justine, whose story happens in the United States, on the golf property of Claire's husband, John. While we hear excerpts, and see an excellent prologue, using the overture of Wagner's Tristan and Isolde under gorgeous visual effects.

Although Justine, played by Kirsten Dunst, who totally deserved her palm for Best actress, is considered the main star of the story, it is evident that Claire, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, is also the main star of Melancholia. Indeed, though their lives took different turns in terms of professional and social successes, I think the two sisters are both alike because, as we watch the movie, we find out that they are both extremely anxious people who dread an unpredictable future.

To me, the reason why some viewers on Amazon, and on the Web, didn't like Melancholia is probably because Lars doesn't work in the classical sense of storytelling. If Melancholia had been done under a very conventional director and/or scriptwriter, the viewer would have gotten likeable characters, with whom the viewer would identify with; and would have a clear explanation to the characters' lives which would explain all their actions and reactions, especially Justine's as she does things that turn her wedding into another direction. Not only that, Lars never entirely explains the characters' troubled state, though a few hints at the wedding reveal the parents absence to be a major influence. Doing exactly what other controversial directors (i.e: David Lynch, Maurice Pialat, Jonathan Demme, Carl Theodor Dreyer, David Chase, and Michael Haneke) have been doing through their movies, Lars wants us to take a look at the story through an open-mind and to interact with it. Which means that we have to create our own explanations through the subtle details Lars is showing in the movie, which we would then tie up to the missing pieces in this movie that the director has shot like a documentary. Of course this kind of thinking will annoy some viewers who only think of movies as a device to decompress from the week's or job's stress, or to have some quality time with their loved ones. However I think it is much more interesting to watch a movie where the characters act and talk like real individuals; and not like some cardboard stereotypes from the Hollywood Sci-fi and Action genre rules, or get used, just like in the movie Armageddon, as a device to promote some Aerosmith videoclip.

For although I do love to watch a commercial Sci-fi flick once in a while, it is nice to see directors try to follow their own voices and give a finger to what some viewers and Hollywood take for granted when they pay their movie tickets and DVDS. And by that I mean that the movie will give them exactly what they want, will explain everything that they need to know, and that they will come out of the theater or living room uplifted, having learned an important moral lesson for the day, ready to take the stresses of lives with a stronger, but sometimes fake and temporary, sense of hope for humanity.

If you are ready to get your senses shaken and being told that sometimes, life does not work like a Hollywood movie, then get on it and have fun watching Melancholia, which I did. But if you don't and prefer to hide your anger through short one-star bashings, where you don't clearly explain why you didn't like a movie, please do not watch Melancholia.

As Foamy the Squirrel, from the Web cartoon Neurotically Yours, said in the episode ""Germaine for Stupids"" : ""Life is offensive people. It's brutal, annoying, stupid, dirty, and at the end ****ing pointless"". And we need stories to sometimes remember that. So that we can be better prepared when those situations happen. For better or for worse.

And besides, I find it ironic that a movie working under a 13 million budget has better visuals effects, scripts and actors, than movies working with 100 millions of dollars of budget (Spider-Man 3, Van Helsing, Armageddon, The Day after Tomorrow, Transformers). Maybe Hollywood should take a note and remember that it is good scripts and directors that make a good movie, not the stars working on it.",1335657600,3,5235,4.8752808988764045

However, the acting was done very well especially by Charlotte Gainsbourg. Honestly the ridiculous wedding antics shouldn't have happened. It made no sense to me why they would show a girl who could presumably see the future, be so cruel to a man who really loved her.

3185202,2,B000VSDNF0,"I have to say I got pretty excited at the beginning of this flick when the Earth crashed into that other planet. They really psyched me out for a wicked post-apocalypse story about people living by a golf course. Unfortunately what you get instead is fifty minutes of rich people murmuring mean things to each other at the worst wedding ever. The story as far I could tell was that Kirsten Dunst (Mary Jane from Spiderman) was marrying that vampire from True Blood at Keiffer Sutherland's (Jack Bauer) house. They're real happy at first, but then Kirsten Dunst gets all sad for some reason and just messes things up for everyone. People kept taking baths and talking about advertising and I couldn't understand what people were saying half the time because of all the murmuring. So then Kirsten Dunst and the Vampire from True Blood break up. Good riddance.

This is where things get weird. Because all of a sudden Kirsten Dunst is super sad and has moved into Jack Bauer's house so she can be taken care of by her sister. Apparently when you're depressed, you have trouble bathing, because Kirsten Dunst can't muster the strength to get in a bathtub, what is that all about? Then Jack Bauer starts talking about how some planet called Melancholia is coming close to the Earth, but won't hit it. It was hard to tell what exactly he said, because of all the murmuring. Anyway people murmur a lot and then finally Melancholia hits the Earth and everybody dies. Good riddance.

This brings me to my most important point: who names a planet ""Melancholia""? I'll tell you who would: no one. When you name something big and ominous, you're going to go with a happy name, like ""Blue Brother"" or ""Mickey Mouse."" If you give something a name like ""Melancholia"" you might as well call it ""that big thing that's gonna kill us all."" I mean come on. Do you really think anyone in the planet naming community is going to name something after a bad mood? There are plenty of ways to imply melancholy without putting it in the name. How about ""Hamlet""? Great name, alludes to melancholy without beating us over the head. Honestly, I would have been happier if they named the planet ""Sadsville"" so at least they're being honest about talking down to the audience.",1335571200,15,2245,4.652392947103275

Both movies give you the feeling that you are there in real time, and real time is not action-packed every second. There are at least five stories going on all the time. It's complicated and I feel as if I had been dropped into the middle of things and left to sort them out as best I could. The ending was only disappointing when I thought I had already figured it out, but I was pleasantly surprised because I was, in fact surprised. I thought the characters were very believable, neurotic but very everyday. The wedding part was like a sad nightmare and all did not work out ""happily ever after"". I respect that. The cinematography was absolutely brilliant, breathtaking and beyond beautiful. The direction was artful and real at the same time. The acting was very good, very real, very actual.

3185209,4,B000VSDNF0,"Melancholia is Lars von Trier's first feature since 2009's Antichrist, which was one of my earlier reviews. That film had stimulated me both mentally and visually, and also left me wanting more from the director of whose work I had not been too familiar with prior. Melancholia was on point with my expectations, with the end result being a visually stunning and equally mentally engaging picture. Right from the opening montage containing Wagner's Tristan und Isolde Prelude layered over high-speed, slow-motion shots with dark, eerie yet magical visuals, the audience is hinted as to what is in store.

The film follows Justine (Kirsten Dunst) as she and newly wed husband Michael (Alexander Skarsgrd) head to their wedding reception. Upon arrival to the absurdly enormous estate, owned by Justine's brother-in-law John (Kiefer Sutherland), Justine's attention is caught by a mysterious star in the sky. Justine's emotional state, which was previously played off so convincingly as happy and giddy during a humorous scene involving the bride and groom in a limousine on a tight country road, declines rapidly.

The evening slowly proceeds with different interactions mostly involving Justine and various family and co-workers. Each of these situations gives us more insight into who Justine is and set the tone for the rest of the film. Justine's depressive state becomes more and more evident, which starts to become a foreshadowing of much larger events. When the celebration events end, so does Part I (entitled on screen as ""Justine"").

Part II, entitled ""Claire,"" focuses more on Justine's older sister (played by Charlotte Gainsbourg). Claire is a loving yet somewhat controlling older sister to Justine who takes on a motherly like role with an ill Justine. During the second part, the planet known as Melancholia is now known to be approaching Earth and much time is focused on Claire's handling of the situation.

The film is certainly more of an experience, or set of experiences, as seen through the eyes of our characters. Because of this, parts of the film are drawn out, which undoubtedly contributes greatly to character development but almost caused me to lose track of the actual story. We do get to know the main characters a great deal and Melancholia adds a whole different dimension to factor into everything that we're observing.

From the get-go, we know this film is going to be a downer for the most part. Knowing that, how events and characters play out is still involving and mysterious. The performances are so profound in this film that it is near impossible to not have any feelings about each of the characters. The emotive music and usually artful cinematography (I say ""usually"" due to plentiful use of shakycam that I found to be less effective in several areas of the film) makes sure that the film has a lasting impact on the viewer.

This really is a beautiful film. Like Antichrist, it plays on the mental state of its characters as well as the external environment. Melancholia also adds a bit of philosophical flare to make things even more engaging. Dunst also really sold the film for me. While I usually have a fairly neutral response to her, with All Good Things and now this, she's certainly someone to watch. I still just can't help but feel that the ""part"" structure of the film was almost unnecessary. Trier chose to spotlight Justine and Claire, however I feel this was achieved automatically without a need for the extra effort. A few directorial preferences aside, Melancholia stands out from most modern films and is truly a stunning experience.

I hate you so much.""  Justine, not to be bested, tells Claire flatly that the earth is evil and deserves to be destroyed.

Justine is the first person to spot the gaseous blue giant Melancholia as it slowly careens towards the earth.  She is the only one to fully accept the significance of this mysterious apparition.  Are the psychic powers Justine claims to possess just another sign of her deep narcissism?  Or is her insanity the only sane response to the potential annihilation of all life in the universe?

The second half (especially after the random suicide of Claire's husband) suddenly became unbelievably bad. It was obvious that the actors themselves (especially KD) could not even take the plot seriously. Also if the point was to contrast the way that 'depressed people' and 'happy people' react to tragedy, then it doesn't really pull it off because all the main characters (except for the groom, who disappears after the first half) seem depressed.

This movie just tries to capitalize on all the hype about 2012 but is silly and uninspired, as though 10 year old kids were shooting a film. Visually it is really pleasing: the lighting is good, the landscape is beautiful. There was some trouble with visual effects like rain and hail but that wouldn't matter if the script itself were any good.

The movie is less obviously manipulative of viewers' emotions than other Von Trier films like Breaking the Waves or Dancer in the Dark, but it makes up for that by being ridiculous. It's a pity because it has good actors.",1334707200,6,1155,4.828282828282828

What bothered me was that, according to the director, the movie was supposed to relate that depressives deal with disaster in a different way than those without depression.

It was very surprising to me, then, when an hour and a half of this movie did not deal even in the slightest with a sense of impending doom. Even when Melancholia comes to the forefront of the film, it still takes awhile before it is revealed to the characters that the planet will hit Earth. In the end, one gets about 20 minutes of the characters reacting to what will be the end of the world. It makes the wedding, the depression, and the dysfunction all seem unimportant. The whole purpose of the film was contained in the last twenty minutes. It was awfully rushed, and you had the feeling watching it that the director had a vision for the movie, wanted to set up an elaborate backdrop for the real plot, and then realized he had too much background and near none of the meaning the movie was to bring.

I simply cannot understand how this movie was about how people deal with tragedy or disaster. If it really was, I can't understand why the first hour of the movie was necessary.

All in all, this movie was disconnected. I felt like the director was caught in multiple minds about what the film was supposed to be about, and it made for a poor movie.",1334620800,4,1438,4.358208955223881
3185295,5,B000VSDNF0,"After I first watched the journey of Lars von Trier's Antichrist, I was destined to see all of his work. Melancholia easily stands next to Trier's other greats. It is a complex story that revolves around Justine (Kirsten Dunst), a recently engaged and depressed young woman, and the end of the world as Melancholia collides with Earth. What evolves is a deep evaluation of the human psyche, and how different people act in a terrible situation when they are depressed and when they are 'normal'. Justine is calm while death seems imminent, almost happy. Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), Justine's sister, gets more and more panicked as destruction comes closer.

Kirsten Dunst was nominated (and won) quite a few different awards when this was at all the different festivals and it is easy to see why. In this one movie, she plays as many emotions as most actors/actresses do throughout their entire filmography.

I wish that the controversy surrounding Lars von Trier and his ""anti-Semitic statements"" (I could tell it was sarcasm) never happened, because I feel as though this movie would have received a lot more praise than it did, the praise that it deserves.",1334620800,3,1162,4.984536082474227

The reason she was calm in the end was because she had plenty of time to come to terms with it.

Nonetheless, to hail this as a representation of clinical depression would be a disservice to those that suffer. Justine knows why she is ""sad"". What a boon for her.

3185322,4,B000VSDNF0,"I will forgo a synopsis of the movie as others have done it better than I could have. This review is different like the movie is itself.

I have not seen any other ""LVT"" movies but I did read some reviews mentioning his other movies. I also noticed the dichotomy of reviews like a bell curve from 1-5 stars for this movie. I see clearly why that is. This movie is not aimed to please it's viewers. Most movies produced aim to please viewers and make them feel good and triumphant with a relaxed sense of relief and satisfaction, perhaps like a good meal. This movie uses the visual and musical mediums to provoke thought on a topic that most people have considered but have never experienced. Actually that statement is half true. It depends upon which part of the movie is referred to though it is all tied together.

First I had not read any reviews before watching and was unsure if this was a sci-fi or some other type of movie but I saw the cast of actors and thought it's free on amazon with prime so I cannot loose too much by watching it on my computer. (I was wrong. I think I should have (and still will) see it on a better quality video source).

This was the type of movie that you must have a blank slate brain to watch with no preconceptions of the topic. The topic is complex. I did forget my troubles of the day. The flow of the movie may seem confusing in the beginning but having patience I now understand the beauty and meaning of how this movie began. I fortunately had no one commenting about ""why did they...this and why did they that..."" I was able to absorb this artwork like a chef styles a complex meal, one course at a time actually one bite at a time with all senses engaged and with no desire to skip to desert. I almost want to see other movies by ""LVT"" but am a little skittish based on reviews. Perhaps I should have an open mind.

If you have ever pondered the meaning of life or the end of life as we know it this will fascinate you. If you don't mind delving into answers to questions you most probably have refused to ask then watch this movie. If you are looking for a no brainer to escape the troubles of the day and make you feel good then bypass this movie for now. Give it a chance later.

I personally was drawn into this and felt a parallel that is somewhat intimate and scary. I am more than appreciative of this movie in its entirety and will never forget it.",1334361600,6,2404,4.217391304347826

""It has been noted the some top-secret Nazi weaponry development was moved outside Germany, to such places as Blizna, Poland -- the same area where Allied aircrews first encountered the infamous 'foo-fighters,' small glowing balls of light that shadowed Allied bombers.  The 'foo-fighters' soon caught the attention of the American news media.  The 'New York Times,' on December 13, 1944, reported news authorized by the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Exepditionary Force.  'Floating Mystery Ball is New Nazi Air Weapon,' read the headline.  The story stated: 'Airmen of the American Air Force report that they are encountering silver-colored spheres in the air over German territory.  The spheres are encountered either singly or in clusters.  Sometimes they are semi-translucent ... The new device, apparently an air defense weapon, resembles the huge glass balls that adorn Christmas trees.  There was no information available as to what holds them up like stars in the sky, what is  in them or what their purpose is supposed to be.'""

'No.  It's a World War Two story, s'got nothing to do with Tinsel Town.'

'Go for it.'

'It was during the final stages of the war.  Himmler was the head of the Gestapo.  You remember Himmler, right?'

I nodded.

'Sometime in the early part of 1944, he was hosting an awards dinner for his men.  They had just finished a sumptuous meal, had drunk cases of the finest French Bordeaux rouge, when Himmler proudly got up to make a toast, celebrating their effort in the final solution.  Standing in front of a giant swastika, he removed his side pistol and clanged it against his glass, calling for quiet.  ""Gentlemen,"" he went on to say, ""in the future, history will record that one of our greatest accomplishments..."" Himmler took a pause for emphasis.  ""We did the thing we had to do while never losing our innate sense of decency."" '

Jerry then fell silent.  I dug deep trying to respond.  I even opened my mouth a couple of times, but nothing surfaced.

3185324,4,B000VSDNF0,"I realized just from watching this that it would be a difficult movie for many people to understand, but upon reading the numerous one-star reviews on here, I see how truly subtle this film is. Yes, a lot of the science is wrong, but that's really secondary to the nature of the movie. The plot might seem to move slowly if you don't understand the immense importance of each scene in creating and depicting the overall meaning of the movie, but as long as you're willing to work at it, you really will get a lot out of this movie. The film stayed with for precisely that reason -- I like having to think about things and work them out for myself, rather than being told what exactly to think and feel at particular points of the movie. I saw it last night and I'm still working through many of the finer points, and there are pieces that I think aren't ever really explained. However, I really love when a movie can end with an element of mystery and a feeling that it didn't all quite make sense, because that's how life is. We don't understand everything that happens, and if you don't mind being reminded of your true ignorance in an esoteric and subtle way, this movie is for you.",1334275200,5,1185,4.366515837104072
3185325,5,B000VSDNF0,"Despite the fact that it deals with such heady topics as depression, mental illness and the end of the world, ""Melancholia"" may well be the most ""accessible"" movie Lars Von Trier has ever made. Which really isn't saying all that much given that the vast majority of his oeuvre consists of works that are, to put it mildly, cerebral, arty, and non-commercial with a vengeance. In fact, this haunting, visionary masterwork is a bit like what ""2012"" might have been had it been designed as a bleak, metaphysical art-house film instead of as a crowd-pleasing, SGI-driven blockbuster.

Like ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Melancholia"" spends the first third of its running-time at a wedding, introducing us to the main characters and the various problems they face. Labeled ""Justine,"" Part 1 focuses on an attractive young woman (Kirsten Dunst) who obviously suffers from a debilitating form of clinical depression. Though she is clearly trying her best to put on a happy face for the guests who have come to see her tie the knot, Justine can't hide the crushing sadness that resides at her core. In addition, Justine and her sister, Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who is desperately trying to pull off a memorable event for her sister despite all the difficulties, also have to deal with the familial stress caused by a cantankerous father (John Hurt) and a hopelessly embittered mother (Charlotte Rampling).

After this deceptively prosaic opening, ""Melancholia"" throws us for a loop in Part 2, simply titled ""Claire."" For we discover that, in addition to the fact that Justine's depression has become almost crippling in its effect on the young woman, scientists have discovered an unknown planet - dubbed Melancholia - hitherto hiding on the other side of the sun that has recently broken out of its orbit and is now on a possible collision course with Earth. Needless to say, this grimmest of all possibilities hangs like a pall over the lives of the characters, like a death sentence passed on a race that daily denies its inherent fragility in the face of massive, impersonal forces of nature and a universe of crushing vastness.

The rogue planet becomes a symbol for all the unspecified fears and dangers, both real and imaginary, that we face everyday as a species - a species that, while it may be uniquely aware of its own mortality, is, nevertheless, willing to overlook that fact as the only means of making it through the day. Indeed, we make a pact with ourselves and each other that we won't acknowledge our own mortality. It's only at certain rare moments that we are forced as individuals to come face-to-face with the ephemeral nature of our existence - only now, thanks to Melancholia, all of humanity is having to do so at the same time. In many ways, Justine, with her depression that existed long before the threatened extinction of the planet, may be the most ""rational"" of all the characters in her reaction to the world around us - and, by extension, the cosmic end of humanity. And it is indeed she, at the end, who manages to not only cope best with the onrushing doom but to provide the strength the others need to come to terms with their fate.

As an apocalyptic fable, ""Melancholia"" possesses all the stark beauty and intellectual rigor of Ingmar Bergman at his finest. Von Trier also shares the Swedish master's ability to draw profoundly layered performances out of a superb ensemble cast. For, in addition to the actors and actresses already mentioned, there is stunning work here by ""24""'s Kiefer Sutherland and ""True Blood""'s Anthony Skarsgard as well.

No review of ""Melancholia"" could possibly hope to do the movie justice, for no words can come close to conveying the visceral impact the film has on its audience. It is a work of art that burrows deep into the viewer's psyche and forces us to ponder - however unwillingly - issues involving our own lives and how we choose to live them.

Mesmerizing and unforgettable.",1334275200,6,3944,4.852897473997028
3185326,4,B000VSDNF0,"mmh.  All these negatives comments.  Too many I would say.  What am I starting to think that all these negativity about this ""Great film"" is only the result of Lars von Trier's dark humor when he joked about ""understanding Hitler"".  He already said it was a joke.  Now, we all know Hollywood is run Jewish, but, is it Amazon now run by the Jewish too? This movie should have won the Oscar but it was rejected by the Director's bad comments(joking).  Now, the Jewish(who run Hollywood, not all) should be shamed of how bad they had portrait the American-Indians in their films and stop thinking that the world rolls around them.  For God's sake.
  Don't listen what other say about the movie.  Watch it and judge it.  Like the old saying, ""when the river sounds, it's because there is some flowing water""

about the Film.

  Beyond its technical ability with the great special effects and great art, the film unfolds a wonderful story.  A human story.  Don't expect some ""End Of The World"" where at the end of the movie the President have the biggest plane to save himself,,lol.  Go out and watch it without prejudice.

To me: This is one of the movies that will stay in my mind and will live in my heart for a couple of years.  If we don't all die in 2012,,hehe.

3185327,4,B000VSDNF0,"Quite frankly, if it weren't for the apocalyptic theme in this movie I might have never watched it. That being said, it did capture my interest in an odd way. You might be inclined to walk out of this movie during the first hour or so due to its slow nature, however, I think it is worth watching in its entirety. While I don't normally comment on specific actors, Melancholia, which is written and directed by Lars von Trier, warrants some mention of the main cast. Kirstan Dunst plays Justine, a young, pretty, mentally ill woman who gets hopelessly bogged down in depression and is borderline psychotic. Charlotte Gainsbourg does a remarkable job playing Justine's sister, Claire. Kiefer Sutherland, taking a dramatic turn from the role of Jack Bauer, plays Claire's husband, John, a wealthy and uptight amateur astronomer who owns the mansion and surrounding golf course where the story unfolds. Unlike in some other apocalyptic fiction, Von Trier does not rely on the ""emergency alert system"" or media elements to describe the cataclysmic events as they unfold - it is told almost entirely through the characters with minimal reference to any outside description. Melancholia, it turns out, is the name of a newly discovered planet, which scientists believe is going to come very close to earth in its trip through our solar system. It suffices to say that there is a slight ""margin of error"" in the scientist's predictions. Melancholia is more like a work of art than an action movie. It is not blunt. It certainly has some depth and is thought-provoking. While I would not recommend this movie to anyone that has a low tolerance for slow-moving movies, Melancholia does have some unique, indefinable rewards for those that are willing to invest their time and attention.",1333929600,9,1777,4.946488294314381

The movie is set in a timeless future on a wealthy estate during a wedding party just before the Earth is about to collide with the rogue planet called Melancholia. The film opens with a long slow motion sequence that depicts the ""Dance of Death"" of the two planets, and the principle characters in the film. The movie is then divided in two parts based on each of the two sisters: Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), as they deal with their difficulties and realizations about themselves, the people around them, and their bleak future. The film is a memorable and striking commentary about disenchantment with one's life, and facing one's imminent mortality.

3185346,4,B000VSDNF0,"And like a dream, infuriating and surreal, this movie is one to love or hate, and perhaps both. I was committed to stick with it, although it didn't become much more coherent once the symphonic 10 minute slow-mo introduction was over. There were lots of subtly surreal moments, as well as those designed to overtly push our buttons, but in the end it is all clearly a meditation on death (perhaps through the lens of ""clinical depression"", but not limited by it). And the protagonist (Dunst), who was most effected by Melancholia (the approaching rogue planet), was the one most ready for (a good) death. The corollary is that the ones most in denial were the least accepting. Nothing revelatory here, but the fact it was even looked at may be.

This is a slick movie with high production value, great cast, and artful pretensions, but it surely isn't ordinary Hollywood. It is also one whose metaphors will stick with me for years.",1333497600,5,932,4.717791411042945
3185347,5,B000VSDNF0,"Melancholia

Written and Directed by Lars von Trier (Antichrist, Breaking the Waves).

Haunting... ""Tristan and Isolde"" ...will tear your heart out!

In the beginning, of the end, we are introduced to fresh faced bride Justine, played by dimpled cheeked Kirsten Dunst and her gorgeous tall soon to be husband Michael, played by Alexander Skarsgrd. The couple arrives two hours late for their own wedding ceremony! Disapprovingly, impatiently and anxiously, they are greeted by her sister Claire, played by the incomparable Charlotte Gainsbourg and Justine's curmudgeon of a brother in law John played by Kiefer Sutherland.

Rounding out this brilliant cast of wedding celebrants are John Hurt, Charlotte Rampling and Stellan Skarsg&auml;rd.

We instantly become wedding guests ourselves and are lead into the grand ballroom of the manor house for the proceedings. Much later, after the cake has been cut, all the guests are ushered outside onto the lawn to join in a charming tradition of writing congratulatory messages on small hot air balloon skins and sending them floating into the sparkling night sky. It was majickal!

Lars gives us tiny glimpses at a time into this privileged, yet terribly dysfunctional family. An undercurrent of uneasiness and outright spoken hostility casts a dark shadow over the festivities as the bride and groom are toasted by estranged family members.

Later, after all the guests have departed, Michael, soon learns that Justine has been barely holding herself together and is irrevocably damaged by major depression. She is incapable of any true relationship nor intimacy with him. Poor disillusioned Michael eventually packs his bag and leaves a broken man.

As the clock ticks tocks, Justine sinks deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole while Claire tries desperately to save her from the darkness while struggling with her own frailties and demons.

By the time we discover the true meaning of MELANCHOLIA, John is having a crushing epiphany! As he sees the light, he decides to take mortality into his own hands while leaving our two sisters to fend for themselves; holding on tightly to each others hands for dear life!

All i dare divulge without ***spoilers*** is that the ending will blow you away!

I hope that you take MELANCHOLIA to heart and love it as much as i did! It is truly a masterful treasure.",1333324800,2,2349,5.12303664921466
3185348,4,B000VSDNF0,"It really helps to have a background in the films of Lars von Trier. His films are not simple, and his characterizations are rich. The DVD extras are plentiful, including moments with the reclusive von Trier, explaining how he wrote it after a bout with clinical depression. Certainly, these are generally unlikeable characters, but its interesting how Claire (always in control) melts down and Justine (insecure and spoiled) trade characters. Sure, the action involved the privileged rich, whose money means nothing in the end, but there have already been plenty of ""end of the world"" movies about regular everyday people. If I didn't care for the characters involved, I was intrigued by the characterizations given by Kirsten Dunst and, especially, Charlotte Gainsbourg. I had little problem watching their development.

If you're new to the films of von Trier, I might recommend ""Breaking the Waves"", or even the unpleasant but powerful ""Dancer in the Dark"". Von Trier is especially known for creating fascinating female characters (Emily Watson and Bjork, respectively). The experimental ""Dogville"" will also remind you of why Nicole Kidman is an A-List actress of depth and focus.

""Melancholia"" is certainly not for everyone, but it's what I would expect from von Trier and I wasn't disappointed.",1333238400,6,1302,5.285024154589372

I don't normally like Kristen Dunst, but the movie's premise (end of the world with no CGI or action) seemed to fit my mood. I completely agree with some of the reviewers here in that the pace of the movie, especially Kristen's character, was very indicative of depression and introspection. More than anything, I loved the beauty of the joy of sadness - if that makes sense. The feelings that this movie emotes are very raw and present. I thought it was beautifully acted, written and filmed. It is not a movie that I would recommend to many people, but for those that want to see it, I would recommend watching it when you are feeling uneasy about something, or introspective.",1333152000,5,813,4.426666666666667

3185363,2,B000VSDNF0,"I was wary about watching this film, and I should have stuck to my misgivings rather than rent it. I must admit, I didn't watch all of it. The story moved along so slow that I skipped through much of the last half of the wedding scene and the next few days. I'm reasonable certain that I missed nothing because every time I stopped to check the story it was still not moving.

There was nothing redeeming about the main characters. All of them were annoying and mostly uninteresting and let's face it, if I wanted to see rich, dysfunctional people I could always catch up on the Republican Presidential candidates. The only character I had any sympathy for was Leo, who's only crime was to be born into the worst family ever. Fortunately, Leo didn't have to spend the rest of his life putting up with them.

I should stress that the acting in Melancholia was good to great...it's just that the characters and the story were written to be intentionally depressing, so it was like walking into an retirement home or a mental ward where no one was ever going to get well. This is a movie where the happy ending is that they all died.",1333152000,5,1130,4.427884615384615

3185366,2,B000VSDNF0,"Yes the movie is artsy, beautifully shot, with characters seriously flawed, withdrawn, and full of emotional pain. Big deal. I had no sympathy for any of them, nor did I care about their coming fate. Basically the characters paralleled the fate of the planet and both made for one big downer. Did Lars von Trier make a great movie? For me, no. I would have preferred seeing the characters explode in reaction to their coming fate. Sutherland doing Dunst as opposed to killing himself. I mean if its inevitable that you're all going to die, have some fun-get drunk, screw, take an acid trip, love everyone around you-anything but lay down and die like a bunch of whimpering losers.

And the portrayal of Earth's demise was just as weak, very unrealistic, and a huge let down on Trier's part as a director. Has this guy never cracked a science book? A planet that size slamming into Earth, come on. The earthquakes, the tidal waves, the fires and devastation-he barely touched on the atmosphere being sucked off. Like the characters, he sent the planet out like a whimpering baby with no fire or zest. Sadly this movie could have been so much more, but then, when a director writes and directs his own work that's usually what happens.

I was a little confused in the beginning, but then realized it was a vision. A lot of people with anxiety/depressive disorders are more in tune, or sometimes highly psychic, having experienced knowing things myself. It runs in the family the depression along with prophetic dreams. I can't tell you how many times it's happened to me. The only side affect is the depression. This movie was done in excellent taste and I could not take my eyes off the TV. I highly recommend seeing this movie and trying to understand what it's like to be different.

After that, I was just waiting for all the annoying characters to be eliminated (although the Justine character (Kristin Dunst) is somewhat redeemed of her irritating melancholy at the end of the movie).  There are 3 basically 3 parts to the movie - The Wedding, The sister of the Bride and The End.  As, I have said, the 3rd part was eagerly anticipated after sitting for over 2 hours watching this dysfunctional family await the inevitable.

3185382,1,B000VSDNF0,"To begin with there are two sorts of movies that are made. One is a film that entertains the masses, that type of film that you go to and walk out being completely entertained by. The other is the art film, a movie genre that can often times be included in the first category but more often than not is so full of itself that it offers no entertainment at all, just that pseudo intellectual crap that only people who think of themselves as above all others enjoy. I've never believed that they actually enjoy it but have felt that they want to impress those around them so much that they pretend to do so. These are the people who watch a film like Andy Warhol's EMPIRE, a static shot of the Empire State Building from 3AM until the next day, a think it's art. Give me a break.

This brings us to MELANCHOLIA. Directed by Lars von Trier, a director that the art house crowd holds in high esteem, the film is one of the most boring things I've ever witnessed. It begins with Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and her new husband en route to their wedding reception. Nearly 5 minutes time is spent with their stretch limo having problems getting around a winding curve as they try and help the driver and take turns driving themselves. They finally arrive and rather than greet their waiting guests, Justine insist on going to say hello to her favorite horse in the stables.

Over the next hour or so we simply witness the wedding reception, hear from various guests that are their and watch as Justine, hoping to find some sort of happiness in it all, continues to deal with the depression she is prone to. It doesn't work no matter how hard her family tries to help her (except for her mother played by Charlotte Rampling who piles on the reasons why marriage stinks).

As the movie progresses we find out that another planet it hurtling towards are own on a collision course. There is no last minute save here, no heroes trying to launch an atomic bomb at the planet or anything else, just the knowledge that the two will collide and everyone will die. The name they give this planet is Melancholia thus tying it into the whole depression motif witnessed throughout the film.

The second half of the film deals more with Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), the one who seemed under control and composed who took care of Justine's wedding and reception. Claire has no idea how to deal with the imminent demise of the world she knows, of her family and slowly begins to fall apart while Justine seems to accept the end calmly and coolly.

SPOILER ALERT

As these two sisters and Claire's son gather on the golf course her husband owns under a makeshift bunch of sticks they collected, Melancholia crashes into the planet and everyone dies. The end.

I cannot begin to explain how boring this movie was. From scenes of nothing more than people going through the motions of events to the back and forth dialogue that feels like it goes no where all I could think was when will this be over? This is not to say a movie filled with dialogue must be boring. MY DINNER WITH ANDRE was fascinating to watch and listen to. This movie just is...boring.

Not only does this movie bore the viewer to death it does little more than attempt to inspire a feeling of depression in it's viewers as well. Its as if von Trier said hey I feel depressed and I don't want to feel alone like this so let me try and make you feel just as bad. Are there people out there without enough problems in their own lives that they need to add to it by sitting through this sort of thing?

If you know someone who is eternally happy, who is care free without a fret in the world that you'd like to see brought down a bit then by all means recommend this film to them. By the end even they may be searching for a razor. If not then avoid this film at all costs and hope that von Trier either finds something to make himself happy or stops making movies.",1332201600,9,3920,4.403314917127072

Watching paint dry is better entertainment than this movie!  This is the most boring and depressing movie I think I've ever seen - it has absolutely no artistic, entertainment, or even educational value whatsoever.

Kirsten plays a very depressed woman - and she plays it well. Being around depressed people is truly depressing - choosing to watch them for entertainment value is insane and not in the least entertaining or rewarding. Do you really want to spend over 2 hours watching someone be depressed? Through most of this movie she looks horrible as well, as does the woman who plays her sister.

3185385,2,B000VSDNF0,"Positive:
The acting, visuals, effects, location and sound both the silence and the background music were nicely crafted.

Negatives:
Schizoid storyline. For 3/4th (about one hour) we have a fearful and slightly manic-depressive bride whose pragmatic sister (already married into a wealthy family) is footing the bill her aforementioned unstable sister's wedding. The soon to be bride seems to be in the perfect relationship but is testing the resolve of her family with her slightly unpredictable behaviors. Really not that interesting as we watch people eat, drink and congratulate each other for an hour. The only thing that rescues one from falling asleep is the cinematography.
The final 1/4th (about half an hour) is about some planet (called Melancholia) that appears out of nowhere and is heading toward Earth on a collision course. There might be some symbolic metaphorical connection between the potential doom from the planet collision and the bride's mental state but it's really fabricated tenuous and adds nothing to understanding the bride.

The physics, and they had an Astrophysicist advisor, was almost as bad as the movie ""Another Earth"". In both a planet from outside our solar system is heading on a collision course for Earth. In this case we have this alien larger gas planet doing some ridiculous loop-to-loop around the Earth; then heads off but then suddenly reverses course to head back. Pleaseee! With script writers and advisors like this it's no wonder that US citizens are more likely to believe myth/superstition at an 80% greater rate than conflicting science based facts and reason.",1332115200,4,1616,5.235521235521236

3185387,1,B000VSDNF0,"I don't understand the point, unlike the planets colliding at the end, whatever this movie is supposed to be about, it missed me.

At the beginning there is a slo-mo-picture thing - don't know what its about.

Then the movie becomes motion and starts with Kirsten Dunst in a wedding gown, in the back of a limo, riding with the groom, they're on their way somewhere, the limo is to wide for the road, I guess the couple walks to an estate where everyone else is already arrived, her sister is p.o.'d, Kirsten delays longer to go say hello to a horse and keeps everyone waiting all evening. At one point she simply takes a bath. So does her mother. It's all cuckoo.

The second half focuses on the Kirsten's sister. Nothing special. Just life. She buys a bottle of pills to kill herself in case Melancholia hits earth. Her husband the whole time insists nothing will happen, Melancholia will miss earth, but finds out he is wrong, steals his wifes pills and kills himself. Leaving his wife and son behind to deal with catastrophe and Kirsten.

The scenery is beautiful. But I attribute that to the countryside it was filmed in.

I had to fast-forward the last five minutes, I couldn't take it anymore. I really tried. I found the answer I was looking for, Melancholia collided with earth, the end.

I should've read the reviews before renting the movie. Apparently, someone named Lars - who is quite a big deal somewhere - suffered from depression and this is what begat of it. It has been insinuated that Americans especially, only want to see happy movies and that we cannot handle depression or ""bad moods"" or anything realistic because ""it"" makes us uncomfortable. It is my opinion that most of us have relatives as self-absorbed as Kirsten Dunst,that I feel it unfair to pay $3.99 to watch self-absorbed relatives (the characters mother and father) on the screen. There is enough crap in the world, that having to sit through someone's psychotic view of the end of the world, and that somehow the depressed are better equipped to deal with the world ending, is unbelievable. Step outside your door and mingle with the public and you will experience numerous Kirsten-Dunst-characters, there is nothing special about it. If we ignore it in everyday life, yet see it on the screen and call it art or beauty, then perhaps someone is out of touch.",1332028800,3,2346,4.682038834951456

3185389,5,B000VSDNF0,"I knew before watching this film that many people were going to hate it.  Then again, most of the films that I seek out are going to be hated by many people.  The fact is... most people simply want to be entertained by movies.  Anything that makes them uncomfortable, or god forbid ""bored"" is seen simply as a nuisance.  Sadly this kind of thinking isn't just prevalent in the visual arts.  How many people are willing to read literature that aims at being much more than entertainment? Or even anti-entertainment in some cases?

In this sense, society has been on a backward slide for some time now.  People don't want reality in movies.  They want an escape.  Melancholia is a film that shows people... flawed people, (like we all are) in a situation that really isn't too far fetched.  Very little time is spent on what most ""end of the world movies"" focus on.  You see enough to know what's going on, but you don't see a lot of action shots of what people all over the world are doing in reaction to this supposed threat.  This is a film that deals with the inner space of humans as much as it does with the threat from outer space.

What I find the most shocking, is that people don't seem to be nearly as put off by films that are full of violence, as they are by films that focus on difficult emotions.  What does this say about our society?
Depression is a very real issue, and a growing issue in our time.  Yet we don't want to think about it.  I think this might be because we know that the answers are difficult to deal with, and some big changes would have to be made to really deal with the underlying problems in our society.  This would surely cause people to do things they don't want to do...and lets face it... they would probably get bored in the process.

I'm not trying to be mean here... we can't blame individuals 100% for this, when we've all been conditioned to some degree by something larger than ourselves.  But I think it's important to keep all of this in mind when taking in a piece of artwork.  Of course there are times for just being entertained, and movies that are meant for this purpose.  Let's just not forget that there's so much more out there to explore.  Sometimes a film is meant to teach us about things that we don't want to face, and there's merit in this.  To just say ""it's boring"" or ""this movie was just awful"" really isn't a review.  It's just a reaction.  Lets slow down and be mindful of what we're experiencing.",1331942400,11,2465,4.353070175438597

The movie looked gorgeous in Blu-ray.  The performances of the actors was top notch.  You could feel that the movie was well put together.. But I could not raise any sympathy or empathy for any of the main characters from the outset thru to the conclusion.

It is really in the characters that this movie fails me.  I found everything about them unbelievable -- sure I understand that the situation in the movie is supposed exacerbate bad behavioral traits, but I was done with everyone of them before their stories even emerged.

I found the special features informative but I could barely keep my anger in check every time the director talked... And Gainsbourg spoke so slowly that I played her interview at 1.5x speed -- although what she had to say was interesting.

When the movie was over, I was just glad it had ended.  I will have to think twice before ordering another Von Trier movie.  What he had tattooed on his hand in the special feature is what he did to those of us who sat through his story.

3185403,2,B000VSDNF0,"Director Lars Von Trier is clearly a very unhappy person.  His world seems to be populated entirely by disagreeable, self-absorbed, and clinically depressed people who tend to wander aimlessly about in vast empty landscapes.  He also wants us to know up front that this is to be an ""Art"" film, so he begins with a collage of abstract imagery filmed in a hyper-realistic, super slow motion style which is accompanied by some wildly inappropriate Wagnerian music.  Perhaps the music is meant to be ironic.  As if all this weren't enough to prove his Art Film credentials, we soon learn that this world is about to be destroyed by a rogue planet.  Doom and gloom reign.  Along the way, we are treated to the usual shaky hand-held camera work, mysteriously burning paintings, and several symbolic clues - to what?  (One of these is a horse that refuses to cross a bridge, which I gather is a reference to one of the director's previous films - the ultimate film geek reference).  All of this is filmed in the curiously flat and colorless manner of bad digital camerawork, which quite simply drains the life out of every scene.  In 40 years of movie watching, I have never had a more disagreeable experience.

Mr. Von Trier is no doubt a skilled, if not a natural, filmmaker who wants his audience to be just as miserable as he is.  Don't go there.",1331856000,4,1343,4.624472573839663

What I think others and myself appreciate about this film is it's documentary-like commentary on the state of a human condition that no one wants to talk about. Others have wrote that this is a film about loss, destruction, and internal and external implosion. I agree. What I appreciate about this film is its ability to take human emotion and not exploit it and pigeonhole it's multiplicity as this ""look-at-me"" destructo-force. Most loss, destruction, etc. is silent, subtle, and incremental, making it thus the more heartbreaking. It's not a rational movie, it's not a movie about reason- but something more humane- struggle and pain. A thoughtful rendition of such concepts. The absurdity of the movie is the heart of the movie!

3185407,5,B000VSDNF0,"MELANCHOLIA begins with a wordless, operatic eight-minute sequence depicting the end of the world.  You should already be able to tell if you will like this movie or not.  But for you fence-riders out there...

The first part focuses primarily upon Justine (Kirsten Dunst), who is celebrating her new marriage at her brother-in-law's (Keifer Sutherland) luxurious villa.  It starts out as basic wedding fodder--some humorous scenes between Justine and her new beau (Alexander Skarsgard), some strangely touching ones between her and her father (John Hurt)--before slowly disintegrating into the madness that we know to expect from Lars von Trier.  The second part of the film focuses more upon Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), as she copes with the knowledge that a strange planet called Melancholia is slowly approaching Earth.

MELANCHOLIA is, at its heart, a chronicle of desperation (perfectly captured by Dunst, who gives a truly grave, often unsettling, performance).  It's also a film of the fantastic, a film that wears its bleakness on its sleeve.  While not as visually upsetting as Trier's previous film ANTICHRIST (about which I STILL have not made up my mind, except to say that it genuinely affected me), MELANCHOLIA contains some imagery that cuts straight to the core in both its beauty and its subtle horror.  The visuals are enhances by the film's performances, notably from Sutherland, the Skarsgards (Stellan and Alexander), Hurt, and Charlotte Rampling. (Look also for Udo Kier and Jesper Christensen, both underused).  Credit must also go to cinematographer Manuel Alberto Claro, and Trier's minimalist script.

Ultimately, MELANCHOLIA falls into the same category as most of Trier's films: it will touch you or it won't.  I won't say love and hate; that's far too simple for a film of this magnitude.  MELANCHOLIA is a true work of art; whether it succeeds or fails depends entirely upon the individual viewer. One thing you cannot deny, though: it is truly a beautiful piece of filmmaking.",1331683200,10,2028,5.260869565217392
3185408,5,B000VSDNF0,"I thought this at turns absolutely lovely and heart-rendering, (the first several minutes, and the last several), and at other times very slow, and vexing (very slow pace, and the characters are not very likeable). But...I do think the pacing and the characters are as they are for a reason--to contextualize the end of the world no less. We spend so much of our time servicing our futures; I think it truly brilliant the way this movie made me think of a situation where nothing truly mattered anymore, not the past, not the present or the future, a tragically beautiful and frightening contemplation. Justine knows things, so she places Albrect Durers notable contemplation of everyday midaeval life on the shelf, so we can see when it is reduced to ashes by a planet named for one of his works (presumably named for one of his works), along with the world it contemplated. I thought Justines reaction very plausible, and it resonated with me. There have been times when I have been deeply depressed and, while not suicidal, thought that death was a blessing: finally an end to all of this constant struggle and pain. I think she felt something similar, and therefore Melencholia was not such a tragedy for her. You don't often get that kind of depth and scope in a movie...no car chases or ""kick-ass"" chicks here...just the end of everything we know.",1331683200,8,1353,4.761702127659574
3185409,5,B000VSDNF0,"I am an avid fan of Lars Von Trier and collect all of his films but during the first half of Melancholia I was almost prepared to give it only 3 stars (with an extra star just because its Lars), however bored and disinterested the film may have left me feeling during its initial chapter titled 'Justine,' the end of the latter and the whole of the second chapter did manage to enthrall and enchant.  I'm accustomed to being mentally, visually and intellectually stimulated and hypnotized by his films almost immediately and it took longer for that to happen this time around.  The story of Melancholia is a meditation on that subject as symbolized by a young woman who suffers from that condition and a planet also called by that name.  I won't give away too much of the story but can confirm it will not disappoint, its a very romantic film for Trier, with exquisite shots and probably his most accessible storyline to date.  His penchant for offending certain viewers isn't anywhere to be found in this film and its not heavily layered with meaning and contradiction like many of his other projects so the interpretation of the film is quite clear.  The film is a lyrical mediation on sadness, fear, anxiety and acceptance of reality and his characters are psychologically well portrayed.  Ms. Dunst is cast against type as she portrays the depressed main character and the woman pulls it off with remarkable finesse.  A far cry from bouncy smiley debutant type this is strong role for Kirsten and punches through any pre-concieved notions one might have of her as an actress.

3185410,1,B000VSDNF0,"Is Melancholia the worst movie I've seen in the past 10 years? No, I think that award would have to go to Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"". In Spielberg's defense however, WOTW actually has a plot. A stupid plot, but more of a plot than Melancholia. Melancholia begins with slow-motion sequences, and doesn't pick up its pace much from that point on. Basically, throughout the movie, the cast of unlikeable characters waits for the planet ""Melancholia"" to either hit or pass by the Earth. The film ends up being an over-the-top artsy mess, which leaves its viewers hoping the end (of the Earth and the movie) comes sooner, rather than later. Yes, there is some beautiful photography, but the film is filled with so much nonsense and illogical behavior, that many scenes could have been cut, and it wouldn't have made any difference in the film's continuity. The director chose to shoot this movie with video cameras (most of which were hand-held--very artsy) rather than film cameras, and I can only imagine that he felt sub-consciously that it wasn't worth wasting expensive film on this pile of mess.

3185411,4,B000VSDNF0,"My first advice, along with other viewers, is to watch a second time. My thoughts while watching were of Carl von Drier and Ordet.  Where that was about people trying to come to grips with their faith, eventually guided by a Christ imitating figure capable of miraculous ressurection, Melancholia is the perfect inverse of that scenario.  Rather than the mad messianistic brother in Ordet, we have the mad, near-catatonic, hopeless Dunst - the only figure who can guide her sister and nephew into pain and death, in a world that has no g-d or after life: ""No one will miss us.""  The close was weirdly beautiful and I think the film is at least worth one try for everyone, even if you have to break it down into 1/2 hour segments to keep from being bored.

As others have also suggested, check out Another Earth and The Tree of Life, since they have similar plot structures/themes.  All three are really wonderful, striking films.",1331683200,5,929,4.674846625766871
3185432,3,B000VSDNF0,"Danish director Lars von Trier got into a bit of trouble last year when he made some controversial comments at the Cannes Film Festival, where he had previously enjoyed a great deal of success with his films. It's unfortunate, because the film he premiered there, Melancholia, was great, even earning its lead, Kirsten Dunst, the festival's award for Best Actress. The film, split into halves, focuses on two sisters -- Justine, whose wedding reception makes up the first half of the film, and Claire, in whose house the reception is held and where Justine spends the second half of the movie suffering from depression. At the same time, Earth is on a collision course with another planet called Melancholia, guaranteeing the end of human life, and each character finds different ways to cope. Melancholia is bolstered primarily by Dunst's powerhouse performance and by von Trier's distinct and personal vision of depression and destruction. It's not what you would call a ""feelgood"" movie, but it's poignant and beautifully shot, for those who are interested.",1331596800,5,1060,5.132947976878612

3185434,4,B000VSDNF0,"It would be unjust of me to critique Melancholia without first admitting that I didn't finish it with a complete understanding of what I had just seen. I can recite the specifics of the plot and it's not an impenetrable film, but if we were to get into the semantics of subtext, symbolism, and meaning; I would come up short. I think writer/director Lars von Trier would be unsatisfied with his own genius if someone completely understood the film upon first viewing anyway. This admission does not, I feel, make me any less capable of reviewing the film. A review is often a first impression, rarely written with finality. Indeed, there's also the chance that I understood everything there was to understand about the film and am reading too deeply into it. Von Trier has never been a director preoccupied with subtlety.

Melancholia is von Trier's latest film, following his beautiful and brilliant film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Antichrist/dp/B003KGBISO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Antichrist</a>. That film was his first foray into the horror genre, while this latest film has him dipping into science-fiction. Much of the scenario warrants the science-fiction label and the plot, at face value, could serve a mainstream disaster film but this is a von Trier film and Melancholia toys with elements of science-fiction without ever becoming science-fiction. It would be much too linear, too easy and it's an interesting move for von Trier to even skim the surface of the genre as reluctantly as he does. The idea reportedly came to him while he was struggling with depression and a therapist commented that people suffering from depression remain calm in stressful situations. Von Trier responds to this by putting his characters into an end-of-the-world scenario. The plot concerns two sisters and a planet called Melancholia that's expected to collide with Earth. It's not entirely important though as Melancholia is concerned more with expression than exposition.

The title of the film and planet give insight into what von Trier is attempting to accomplish. According to Wikipedia, Melancholia is a mood disorder of non-specific depression, characterized by low levels of both enthusiasm and eagerness for activity. Furthermore, in ancient usage, it encompassed mental disorders that would now be called schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder. After seeing the film, I found this to be a fascinating revelation; one that makes the film seem a bit more heavy-handed in retrospect.

Much like Antichrist, Melancholia begins with an attention-grabbing opening sequence, similarly stylized and equally beautiful although not as easy to follow. There are shots of a lugubrious looking Kirsten Dunst, the Earth, the moon, and the rogue planet that gives the film its title. It concludes with a shot of Melancholia colliding with Earth. Von Trier wouldn't want his audience in suspense for the next couple hours. The film is separated into two parts (entitled ""Justine"" & ""Claire""), each running about an hour long. Part one opens at the lavish wedding reception of Justine (Dunst) and Michael (Alexander Skarsgrd), hosted at the mansion of Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland). As Justin arrives, she notices a red star in the sky. John informs her that it's Antares, the main star in the Scorpio constellation.

The reception is swimming with familiar faces, including John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling (as Justine and Claire's estranged parents, Dexter and Gaby), Stellan Skarsgrd as Justine's boss Jack, Jack's nephew Tim (Brady Corbet), and Udo Kier as the quirky wedding planner who refuses to look at Justine because she's ""ruined"" his wedding. The familiar faces all bring separate kinds of strife to the reception, beginning with a short, but stinging argument between Dexter and Gaby during a toast. Gaby is a cold, confrontational woman and John eventually retaliates by throwing her luggage outside. It becomes clear that Justine suffers from depression and even during her wedding party, she falls into bouts of sadness. Claire and John, who are footing the bill, grow frustrated over Justine's inability to appear happy and that's not even all of it. Emotions of all different kinds run high, but they're understated. Von Trier is not one for subtlety, but he strays far from theatricality too. The wedding party concludes with perhaps the most depressing ending to a wedding party ever put on film. This happens 63 minutes in. This detail could make or break someone's decision to see this film.

Part two is a different animal, with much of the focus turning to Claire. The planet Melancholia has been hiding behind the sun and Claire fears it will collide with Earth in five days, although John is confident that it's merely going to beautifully pass by. With no suspense to keep us guessing, we're allowed to more closely follow and analyze the characters.

The intimate cinematography makes frequent use of handheld cameras and the zoom feature, a technique that will frustrate many. It's an effective approach, which brings the audience closer to the drama. The film alternates between quiet, intimate moments/conversations between characters to moments of cinematic art punctuated by the somber music from Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. This music becomes the film's main theme and greatly complements the beautifully murky atmosphere. It's a beautifully dreary and (yes) melancholy film to behold.

The meaning of the word ""pretentious"" has been unfairly stigmatized by its overuse in regards to challenging films. Oftentimes, pretentious has become a euphemism for ""I didn't understand this film."" Its negative connotations make it difficult to use in serious film discussions. It's unfortunate, because pretentious is not necessarily an insulting term. Von Trier is a pretentious filmmaker whose films aren't challenging due to subject matter alone, but because they're so heavy, so serious, they can be difficult to labor through. Melancholia is as sad as the characters that inhabit it and there's nary a moment of happiness. It's so serious, so consistently downbeat it has a staggering effect since a single viewing can't do complete justice to this film, but it's unlikely you'll want to sit through it more than once.

As heavy and emotional as the material is, it's an emotionally cold film that never evoked a similar emotional response from me. It fascinated me at times, but never rocked me. I never found it tedious, but I can guarantee many viewers will. On the flipside, many viewers think it was one of the best films of last year. I'd agree, but it wouldn't make my shortlist.

When Melancholia premiered at Cannes, more press was given to Lars von Trier's failed attempt at humor than to Kirsten Dunst's Best Actress win. It seems that Dunst has been making a conscious effort to establish herself as a truly serious actress, straying from the mainstream in favor of more challenging independent films. This is certainly the most mature, adult role she's approached. It's a delicate performance, highly emotional and psychologically complex that Dunst doesn't overplay and, perhaps as a result, I'm not floored by her performance. Perhaps I didn't anticipate how quietly emotional it would be. I may have expected less subtlety. She does kind of play second fiddle to Gainsbourg in the latter half anyway. After her performance in Antichrist, Gainsbourg has a tough job trying to impress the audience further but her performance is on par with Dunst's. Sutherland also gives a mature performance that reminds us of what he gifted actor he can be with solid material.

Melancholia is a pretentious (no insult intended), challenging film that both fascinates and perplexes me. Even with a deeper understanding of it, I'd find it hard to love but I respect and admire it greatly on several levels. It's definitely what the average moviegoer would negatively refer to as an ""art film"" though. Those who like von Trier will find things to appreciate, those who don't won't find much to change their minds, and those unfamiliar with his work should approach with caution. I certainly can't help but admire a filmmaker who makes me think about his film, even if he fails to make me enjoy it.

Is it any good?

For me, it always comes with great excitement when a new Lars Von Trier film comes out, as you really do not know what you are going to get. This film in particular is one that you either love or you hate. Personally, I loved it. The film is essentially two halves of polar opposite characters. Kirsten Dunst's performance is brilliant and courageous, as a depressed, but calm bride. A highly stressed, Charlotte Gainsborough carries the second half of the film as their peril becomes clearer. But it's the uneasiness of the end-of-the-world theme and the situation of the inevitable which gives the film a strange foreboding of fear, which for me, actually made me question my own existence and reflect on how I would react in the situation.

3185437,3,B000VSDNF0,"This morning I finally forced myself to finish watching ""Melancholia,"" Lars von Trier's end-of-the-world extravaganza.  It wasn't the film's length that had compelled me, a few weeks ago, to stop halfway through (I'm a sucker for long films), nor was it the subject matter or pacing.  I simply didn't care to find out how it all -- and I mean All -- ends.  You wouldn't think that a film depicting a vast planet hurtling towards Earth could be so lacking in drama, so dull and flaccid.  As the credits rolled, all I could think was...""That's it?""  Not to the end of the world, but the movie itself.  Perhaps that's von Trier's point, that once we're gone there'll be no-one to comment or reflect on the fact that we're gone.  The End will be the end.  But I couldn't help thinking that in the hands of a Bergman or a Bu&ntilde;uel, I'd be left with something to think about, some point of view to consider.  Von Trier does drop a hint now and then; one of the main characters says, ""The human race is evil, no-one will miss it.""  Okay, I guess.  But as she's a narcissistic, self-destructive drudge suffering from crippling depression, the statement doesn't have the impact it might coming from a rational, sensible person who's come to that conclusion after intelligent, soul searching meditation.  ""Melancholia,"" beautiful as it is to watch and professionally performed by its game cast, takes the easy way out.  Life is crap, so are People, boom, it's over and it's no big deal.

Maybe I missed a point or two because I didn't quite understand what was wrong with the central character. The film's pace was a little different yes but it was effective no. A bride is feeling moody, drunk, unwell, happy, unhappy all at once. Her sister's piercing looks are getting the worse of her but she is trying not to care. Minutes into her marriage she commits adultery. There is also an end - of - earth situation which is running parallel to her story of being unhealthy. Amidst all this there is a bad relationship between two sisters which is rather uncomfortable to watch. The climax is finally when things get into motion and what happens is well...justified?

But the whole affair seemed really pointless. It was not even arty or fun to watch. The entire texture or the mood of the film is coarse. This is not the film you will look back in four years for inspiring moments, even the grief didn't transpire or move me as an audience member. Although I didn't hate the film, I feel inclined to mention my opinion cause I'm pretty sure I saw the same film as the others.

2011 was a year where another similar science fiction was made, I suggest you go try that one too. It's called Another Earth and it is much better, more capable and somehow doesn't act like an excuse a bad student makes for failing a class.

3185439,4,B000VSDNF0,"The opening prologue makes us aware of the approaching cataclysm,Melancholia the planet is hurtling towards Earth. The movements of the spirit parallels astronomical events,showing us the relations of humans to the world at large. Time seems to stand still or to slow to adagio. Kirsten Dunst seems to float in the water like Ophelia. Breughel's Hunters in the Snow burns,referencing Tarkovsky's Solaris. The soul and planet Earth stand in for each other. Von Trier has said the film is about his own depression. But expressing it can be a positive.

Two sisters,Justine(Dunst) and Claire(Gainsborough)are polar opposites: Justine, the younger one, is sensitive and prone to depression, while her older sister Claire is rational, protecting of her sister, nurturing and tolerant. We have a family wedding melodrama in Dogme vein(luxurious version).There is emotion and humour,but also suffocation with Justine the outsider. Wagner's Tristan und Isolde gives a romantic tenor to the bleakness. The two sisters could be seen as two sides of the same person.

Claire is rationalistic,controlling,represents normality,caring for her sister in her helpless state of depression, for whom the world is too much. However Claire has something to lose,her illusions,she would panic with catastrophe. While Justine roasts(with the glow of melancholy) in the shadow of death,Claire is numbed motionless inexpectation of the planet's impact. Claire is unable to deal with the reality. There is no place in her world for an instant end to everything, for her son never seeing adulthood, all futures preempted. But for Justine ""the Earth is a cruel place that is nothing to mournfor.""

Justine's vision unclouded by illusions that protect the ego from reality,means she does not fear death. She gets stronger,cold but comforting,catastrophe's enliven her. Melancholy casts its raw light on things,destroying distinctions between life and death. The parallel between Earth and humankind disintegrates. The film's slow pace, its recurring leitmotif-like sentences and images in place of a narrative, offer the viewer a condition rather than a story. Here, Wagner's music, with its characteristic stasis, its unwillingness to develop freely, serves Trier as an appropriate backdrop. There is no other way to put it: this film is the phenomenon of melancholy itself. Call it existentialist: we are ruthlessly thrown into the universe with no chance of escape. Even the Earth itself is vulnerable.

Von Trier creates through female heroines. In Melancholia is a female protagonist who is strong by virtue of her weakness, but who here moves no mountains, and makes no sacrifice of herself or others. Her power lies merely in her understanding the merciless, impartial logic of the heavenless sky. She leads her loved ones, Charon-like, through the cataclysm. The scene playing out around her is already overshadowed by what she is long accustomed to, so for her there is no struggle. For Claire Apocalypse is now.

I mean it. I was pure rage at that moment and I vowed to my boyfriend (extraordinary author Christopher Rankin, [...]) that I would tell everyone I met and post all over Facebook how frustrating and boring this movie was and how no one should see it. Seriously, von Trier is going to just take out planet Earth with a whimper in 30 seconds after forcing me to spend my final 2 hours on the planet with a dysfunctional family at a wedding? I don't even like attending boring weddings with my closest family and friends in toe so I sure as hell don't want to spend my final moments of life suffering through the main character Justine's wedding if there's not going to be a big payoff afterward. I felt cheated and manipulated and was convinced that mind-altering substances must have been running rampant in the screening rooms where reviewers like J. Hoberman of the Village Voice and others decided that this movie about the end of the world made them feel ""light, rejuvenated and unconsciously happy.""

And the reason I liked it is because this movie is really a subtle and suspenseful horror movie, and I love horror movies. That's right, Melancholia is really a movie about the Devil coming back to Earth in the form of a human being to quietly watch in amusement as the planet and all of God's creatures are destroyed. Justine (played by Kirsten Dunst) wasn't simply a woman suffering from depression. She was possessed by the Devil, who came back to Earth to watch the end of days. That's really the only way you can explain her behavior in this movie. She is extremely careless with her new husband's feelings at the wedding and actually cheats on him with a stranger during the reception for God's sake. And there's a scene right before the worst happens where Justine tells her terrified sister that she knows that they are alone in this world and there is no God or Heaven. ""The earth is evil--we don't need to grieve for it,"" she says, following with the observation that ""I know we're alone.""

Religious types (and Kevin Spacey's character Roger ""Verbal"" Kint in the movie The Usual Suspects) will tell you that the best thing the Devil can do is make you think he doesn't exit, and Justine is adamant in her apparent divine knowledge of the fact that there is no life after death. All the while, she couldn't be more content with what is going on around her and the fact that everyone is going to die. She even goes outside for a nude erotic bath in the middle of the night a mere couple of hours before Earth is going to be wiped off the map. With someone sitting so pretty while the world collapses all around her, she would have to be the Devil right?

People say that Lars von Trier pushes boundaries and is controversial in his films. Well, I say the only problem with von Trier's Melancholia is that he didn't take this Devil theme far enough. Although von Trier and others have indicated that this movie is just about depression, there is some additional support for my theory that Justine is really the Devil. The name of the planet that is going to inevitably hit Earth and kill all of humankind is called Melancholia, and the words ""melancholia"" and ""melancholy"" have specifically been used countless times throughout history in literature and discussions about the Devil and demonic possession. ""Melancholy"" is defined as ""sadness or depression of the spirits,"" and ""melancholia"" is a ""mental disorder characterized by severe depression, guilt, hopelessness, and withdrawal."" See [...]. ""[D]emonic possession was often linked with melancholy, itself an illness which covered a vast array of symptoms,"" and ""suicidal impulses [such as those exhibited by Justine] were often seen as evidence of demonic activity."" Almond, Philip C., Demonic possession and exorcism in early modern England: contemporary texts and their cultural contexts (Cambridge University Press, 2004). Indeed, the origin of melancholia in humans was often linked ""with the fall of Adam himself, with the work of the devil's tongue."" Schiesari, Juliana, The Gendering of Melancholia: Feminism, Psychoanalysis and the Symbolics of Loss in Renaissance Literature (Cornell University Press, 1992).

Those who know me will probably say that I try to make every movie into a horror movie. There may be some truth to that, and I know that you readers out there probably won't buy my Devil theory about Melancholia. Instead, you'll just appreciate the film for its score, artistry and beautiful cinematography, and that is just fine. Those things were all top notch. The bottom line for me, though, is regardless of whether or not Justine is really the Devil, I spent an hour discussing this film with my boyfriend after we left the theater and I've always thought a movie must be good if it gets you thinking and talking, even if you don't actually enjoy the movie-going experience itself. (See my forthcoming review of Dogtooth for a great example). With immediately forgettable movies like The Inn Keepers being released right now, it is a nice change of pace to have a movie like Melancholia actually make you feel something and get your blood boiling.

And maybe, just maybe, those reviewers I mentioned before who said this movie made them feel incredibly happy are really just the Devil's minions sent to Earth to gleefully watch God's children suffer through this film.

3185452,5,B000VSDNF0,"""Melancholia"" is one of the most surprising and enjoyable films that I've seen in years. Maybe it was the mood I was in, assisted by a 'chaw' of K-2 incense.

The film's ""story"" is told primarily through absolutely stunning ""visuals"".  Don't miss one second of the film's opening sequence.  Like Stanley Kubrick's ""2001 Space Odyssey"", ""Melancholia"" begins with a sequence of slow motion scenes, each more visually arresting than the previous.  The entire 12 minute sequence is set to the thrilling crescendo of Wagner's opera score for ""Tristan and Isolde"".  [Throughout the entire film the background music is wonderful; come prepared to appreciate it all.]  This opening sequence ends with an amazing space shot of a monster planet crashing into, and completely obliterating a much smaller planet which looks like the planet earth.  Every shot in this opening sequence is a visual treat, and each is directly related to, and foretells the story that unfolds.

Like ""2001 Space Odyssey"", this movie is not for everyone.  An elderly, 70-plus  couple sitting behind us in the theater whispered very loudly (several times) to her hard-of-hearing mate: ""This is a very strange movie!!"". Indeed it is.  And it's wonderful!!

After the stunning opening sequence, the story/plot unfolds with a minimalist, intelligent dialogue that is focused on the film's principle purpose -- an honest but sympathetic depiction of serious, clinical depression (or what used to be called ""melancholy"").

Several immediate family members have had depression, and I can attest that the film's description is fundamentally accurate.  There are the euphoric highs, when the depressed feel falsely empowered to blow off authority figures (such as the 'boss', the career, the husband, the loving/caring family members, etc.)  The  mania is followed shortly by the 'lows' when the depressed become obsessed with death  -- and are sometimes rendered incapable of leaving their beds or even moving their limbs.  In one scene the depressed beauty, Kirsten Dunst, cannot raise her leg high enough to enter a warm bath that her loving sister has drawn.  In another scene Dunst, alone in the woods, literally baths naked in the light of the monster death planet that is fast approaching earth -- and her.

Yet the closer the death planet gets to earth, the calmer and more rational the depressed Dunst becomes.  Because she's been obsessing about death for months -- maybe years -- she's prepared and the only adult family member who is able to accept with some dignity the inevitability of death.

After reading several critics' reviews I was surprised that most missed the film's 'commanding heights' attention to clinical depression, preferring instead to focus on the 'end-of-the-world' dramatics.  For me the end of the world theme is a mere plot device that serves the overarching focus on depression.  (And what a plot device it is!)

To be sure the film has several minor flaws.  A few scenes strained credibility and therefore distracted.  For example, it is extremely unlikely that even a manic depressive bride would ravage a male intern in the middle of a well-lite mansion lawn where she's just taken her wedding vows.  And in two beautifully filmed scenes the gorgeous black horse that Dunst is riding balks and refuses to cross a small wooden bridge.  None of my film buff friends understood how either of these scenes connected to the film's plot or purpose.  Obviously, the Director decided they were important -- perhaps symbolic -- scenes, but we just didn't get it.  These are minor quibbles, however, and in no way did the flaws detract from the overall thrill of watching this film.

The full effect of the visuals and the music are best experienced in a theater -- the larger the better -- rather than via a small laptop/DVD screen.

Bottom line:  Despite very minor flaws, this film is a creative masterpiece that will certainly stand the test of time.  It may not be for everyone -- or even for the average movie goer -- but it is certainly an artistic gem -- visual eye candy.  What movie fan doesn't appreciate film makers who challenge themselves and us with original, creative treatments of serious, adult topics?",1329091200,4,4209,5.040520984081042
3185453,5,B000VSDNF0,"Most films about the apocalypse involve a group of characters, who are trying to run from the disaster at hand, wanting to fix everything, including saving the world. These movies usually include frantic violence and special effects, paper-thin characters, and not even a remote possibility of feeling sympathy for a character, because you know they will win in the end.

However, in Lars Von Trier's ""Melancholia"", none of this is really the case. From the opening sequence, you know essentially what is going to happen. However, I won't accuse this film of being predictable, because it uses absolutely no cliches that are so typical of the disaster film sub-genre. And plus, it has much more to fall back on.

The film centers around two sisters - Justine (Kirsten Dunst), and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Justine is getting married to Michael (Alexander Skarsgard), however Justine has been severely depressed for a very long time. She hasn't been able to cope with a lot of the changes in her life, and she doesn't know why. Claire has a young son, and she's always been the kind of person who looks after others, her sister, her child, and the rest of her family. When there is talk of a new planet called Melancholia, and the likelihood of it colliding with Earth, it forces Claire and Justine to look back on their lives, and ponder the decisions that they have made, and to find the meaning of their own lives before it becomes too late.

If you only need one reason to watch this film, it's Kirsten Dunst. I never quite saw Dunst as a serious actress. I had seen her in mostly comedies, however I thought she gave a wonderful performance in Sofia Coppola's re-imagination of ""Marie Antoinette"", however, I thought that maybe Dunst just got lucky that one time. This film proves that she can act, and she may even be Oscar worthy. Proving herself to be a character actress, her expressive eyes and face tell you so much about her character, even when she is saying nothing at all.

Charlotte Gainsbourg was apparently in a few of Triers' other films, yet this is the first thing I had seen her in. She's fabulous shining just as much as Dunst. The audience might relate or identify with her character more, making her, in a way, the heart of this picture. Her acting style is very poignant, quiet and thoughtful. I can't wait to see what she does next. Keifer Sutherland and Alex Skarsgard have minor roles here, and while they're very good, their characters could have been better-developed, and as thought out as the two female leads.

Lars Von Trier has made quite a few award-winning films. However, none that I can recall are as universal, approachable and ambitious as ""Melancholia"". As someone who attempted to watch ""Dogville"" and never quite got the hang of it, I can say that this is a massive improvement. First of all, ""Dogville"" had a running time about two minutes shy of three hours. It didn't have enough going for it. However, this one has everything going for it.

As the title suggests, a somber, and depressing mood is established early on in the film. However, it displays a lot of fine acting and cinematography, and the way that startling and beautiful images are put together with concertos from Wagner's ""Tristan und Isolde"" make for something beautiful, and uncompromisingly haunting. The theme, or message of this film is about togetherness, and family. However, there are so many metaphors scattered throughout this movie, that you might take something different away from it than I did.

Regardless, you won't forget about this film anytime soon. While the term ""art film"" has been thrown around to disposable and forgettable films, this is a true art film. The imagery and soundtrack, and the reputable lack of special effects, considering this is essentially a disaster film, are undeniably refreshing. While it is very depressing and devastating, it leaves an impression that is unlike anything you've experienced in film before. It's extremely and unrelentingly thought-provoking, and like the best art, it's open to interpretation.

3185454,1,B000VSDNF0,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

'Melancholia' is not only the name of the condition that afflicts Danish Director Lars Von Triers' protagonist, Justine, but it's also the name of the planet that has just come out from hiding behind the sun, and is on a collision course with earth. If you're anticipating watching another sci-fi thriller, this is not the film to go and see. Like this year's other entry in the indie pseudo sci-fi category, 'Another Earth', the focus is not on that annoying other planet up in the sky, but on the conflicts between the afflicted parties down on earth.

Von Triers divides 'Melancholia' into two parts that focus on two very different sisters, Justine and Claire. In Part I, Justine is a mid-level advertising copywriter, who arrives two hours late to her wedding with groom Michael, at brother-in-law John's estate. Just about everyone is speaking American English, so I assume the setting is supposed to be somewhere in the US, but it's not really clear. Justine is suffering from severe depression for unknown reasons and there are some suggestions that she may have psychic powers.

One explanation for Justine's blues is that she comes from a highly unpleasant family. Don't ask for any back story, you'll just have to be content to accept the fact that Von Triers' characters are inherently dysfunctional. There's a method to Von Triers' madness and I will attempt to shed some light on it by the end of this review. Suffice it to say at this juncture that in Von Triers' weltanschauung, all the so-called 'normal' people, are uncaring, and in some cases, plain 'evil', and the 'abnormal', those suffering from so-called mental illnesses, are actually quite sane.

Justine's relatives, friends and business associates are designed to offend our sensibilities as they all come across as self-centered and misanthropic. The worst offender is probably Justine's sarcastic, divorced mother, who tactlessly condemns the institution of marriage in a wedding toast, and expectorates numerous insults in front of the assembled guests, including the bride and groom. The father isn't much better, a card-carrying alcoholic who promises Justine, in the midst of her worst moment of decompensation, that he'll stay the night, but later leaves a note to his daughter, apologizing for leaving, due to a change of mind. There's also Justine's creepy boss, who attempts to humiliate one of his new employees in front of her, only to provoke an enraged Justine to send the boss to an early exit from the festivities. How does the new employee respond to Justine sticking up for him? He promptly has sex with her on the golf course. Passive schlub husband Michael, decides to leave Justine, with nary a protest. Lest I forget, brother-in-law John has no tolerance for the mother's bi-polar-like outbursts and at one point gathers up her luggage and dumps it outside the front entrance of the estate, until passive-aggressively reversing himself, and bringing the luggage back up to her room.

The second half of 'Melanchalia', Part 2, focuses on Justine's sister, Claire, who lives with John and their young son, Leo, at the estate. Claire is seemingly the most 'rational' and 'normal' of anyone who we've met so far, so when Von Triers transforms her into an abject coward, then we began to see what's going on here. It's no secret that Von Triers created 'Melancholia' as a result of his treatment for depression. When his therapist suggested that depressed people are more 'calm' in moments of crisis, that gave Von Triers license to affirm what he knew all along--that he, otherwise known as one of the ""depressed oppressed"", are better than all those nasties, he's been pitted against during his entire life. Of course one must accept Von Triers' supposition that all the antagonists we meet in 'Melancholia', are not caricatures, but multi-dimensional portraits, of living, breathing, human beings.

Evidence of Justine's 'triumph', can be found in Claire's reaction to her impending doom. As 'Melancholia' (the planet that is), is about to take the lives of everyone on earth, past nut-job Justine calmly pulls herself together and miraculously becomes the 'strong one'. When she finds John after he commits suicide, she calmly covers him with hay in the barn and doesn't freak out. She then builds a protective 'magic cave' for Leo, so he won't be afraid at all when earth completely implodes. Meanwhile, once 'normal' Claire, is frantically driving the family golf cart (the cars don't work because of earth's new found, screwed up, gravitational pull) with Leo into town, so she can get ""help"" (of course the implication is that she's 'lost it' because of course, how can you get 'help', when the earth is about to collide with another planet?).

One can view 'Melancholia' as a poor man's, reverse 'Persona', the classic 1966 film by Ingmar Bergman. Von Triers echoes Bergman's preoccupation with the differences between two women from different classes, different walks of life. In Persona, a lower class nurse, cares for an upper class, well known actress who suffers from mental illness. The 'simpler' nurse turns out to be more 'real' than the actress, who feigns mental illness to cover for her narcissism. Here, the seemingly afflicted Justine, proves to be much stronger than her sister, the wife of a millionaire, who, when faced with the fact that earth is about to be destroyed, is unable to muster the courage to face death, bravely.

If there's any saving grace in 'Melancholia', it's the iconic series of magisterial images in slow motion, mainly seen at the beginning of the film. Otherwise, the actors are hemmed in by the pretentious screenplay, which make them all seem like laughable caricatures. Von Triers' use of a bombastic Wagner score only adds to his reputation as a director with adolescent sensibilities, who doesn't even come close to approaching the sensibilities of the world's master filmmakers.",1328918400,17,5969,5.052791878172589
3185455,5,B000VSDNF0,I saw this movie about 6 weeks ago and I can't get it out of my head. The fact that I love the music must have a lot to do with it and I also can't get enough of end of the world films.,1328745600,5,185,3.227272727272727
3185456,5,B000VSDNF0,"This is one of the most mind-bending movies I have ever seen! This movie is absolutely not for everyone. You have to be ready to be taken into the world it creates, which is challenging. Or, you have to be open to a unique film like this.

I am not the most avid von Trier fan! So, I wasn't sure what to expect from the film, but I was anxious to see it. During the final moments of the film, I was literally holding my breath. The final image of the film is in the league of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" You will see why.

The ending itself isn't a surprise at all. von Trier makes sure you know that the world is going to end in the trance-like opening eight minutes. A series of dream-like images unfolds, leading to the final shot of the sequence: Earth smashing head-on into a planet 10 times its size. So, as the film goes forward, you know what lies ahead.

The film is in two parts. The first shows a wedding reception that spirals into disaster. Two sisters, Justine and Claire, are the focus. Justine is the melancholic bride, who sinks into depression during the reception. Claire is left to try to keep her from completely losing it. The second half sees the next morning when everyone has left, except for Justine and Claire with her husband and son. The planet Melancholia has come into view, and is now on a track towards Earth. It's supposed to only pass close by, but will it? And how will the people in the film react?

We, of course, already know the answer, and that is the key. This film is all about how the characters deal with impending, absolutely certain doom. Each of the four characters react in unique ways, and that's what makes the film so fascinating. Every end-of-the-world movie is about crazy visual effects and melodrama. The key here is that there are no TV reports or anything. Just four people on this otherwise empty estate.

There is a lot of von Trier's ""in the moment"" cinema verite shooting style in the opening half. But, it calms down in the second half. And, there are moments of absolutely gorgeous cinematography in the opening and during the second half.

Now imagine you are very rich and having that same wedding in your own mansion with expansive well manicured grounds. Horses in the modern stables. Two or three 4x4s and a butler plus assorted servants to help with the reception. Are the proceedings normal or are they normal plus?

Undercurrents do eventually surface. The two sisters who centre the story are a clash of types. The creative and the stoic. The father is a s...bag. You may disagree. This is a live action story with the drama both extreme AND non-existent. Isn't that how middle-class problems are dealt with? Some other place, not in conversation and never admitted.

Looming doom. I love the magic cave, that would be me. But then I don't drink wine. I savour a film of humans sane. Civility is an art form. Green.",1328572800,4,970,4.761904761904762
3185458,1,B000VSDNF0,"I'll preface my negative review of the movie with this:
- Great acting by Dunst. She perfectly plays an abhorrent character.
- Some really cool visuals and cinematography

Half the movie involves a wedding and how Dunst is too emo and artsy to deal with her family or her spineless new husband. The second half involves panicky characters trying to cope with the potential of the world coming to an end. The movie is disturbingly slow and the characters are such terrible, terrible people. This movie was made by someone with no understanding of physics (if a planet comes anywhere near our planet, especially if that planet is larger, the rise in tides would cause tsunamis that would wipe us all out way before such a planet could hit us); it is a truly artistic endeavor.

I'm actually offended that I was made to believe this would be an ""incredible"" and ""beautiful"" film. I struggled through everything beyond the first 5 minutes.",1327968000,8,935,4.765432098765432

The camera work and cinematography is often exquisite and the performances are first class. The story is relatively straight forward and the script often clunky. There are dutiful homages to Tarkovsky, the slo-mo horse shots, the doom and gloom recalling Tarkovsky's Sacrifice, the use of Breughel's painting(Solaris), to mention a few.

3185460,3,B000VSDNF0,"Inspired in part by Director, Lars von Trier's own battle with depression, Melancholia as part sci-fi , part visual masterpiece and part social drama, challenges the audience to accept an uneven mix of sublime visual imagery and commercially tainted, routine dramatic storytelling.  Ultimately, Melancholia is a sadly frustrating film of three stanzas!

von Trier's opening stanza is a wonderfully mysterious canvas of visual beauty which entrances and affects. With ethereal floating imagery and lush colors, its enigmatic nature captures the imagination.  In typical von Trier style to not follow normal filming conventions, the opening stanza reveals the film's denouement.

The second stanza, captured using von Trier's customary hand-held filming technique (an essential element in his Dogme 95 manifesto), is long, and dare I say it, predictable, pudgy and boring.  Lacking the stunning visual impact of its bookend set pieces  it plays out like a  turgid TV soap opera; offering a by the numbers drama of a dysfunctional and conflicted family.  Occupying more than 90% of the film, the largely prosaic plot of the second stanza completely unbalances and devalues what had the potential to be a cinematic tour-de-force.

von Trier returns to form in the short concluding stanza as sisters Justine and Claire, having realised their promised salvation was false, wait with Claire's young son Leo, as the menacing rogue planet which has controlled their recent lives, looms larger and larger in the sky, until it chillingly occasions their death and the end of the world, enveloping them and the audience in a hauntingly evocative, visually stunning, and unforgettable finale.",1327795200,3,1679,5.426923076923077
3185461,5,B000VSDNF0,"Melancholia totally absorbed me. It had me from the first moment to well after the credits rolled. Every frame was sumptuous and beautiful. Loved the music throughout. The 10 seconds or so of black nothingness at the end.

Amazing contrasts - a wedding and the possible end of the world, depression and beauty. Kirsten Dunst was amazing. Great colorful characters in her folks, boss, brother-in-law Kiefer S, and the dysfunction between them all. Interesting how the entire thing takes place at this castle/estate, which becomes increasingly cut off from the rest of the world, with fewer and fewer characters as the movie goes on.

It seems that every detail in this film was well thought out and quite intentional. I'm sure I'll get more out of it on the second viewing.

You'll see lots of 5-star reviews here but also many 1- or 2-star reviews.  I respect the opinions of people who did not like this film.  It is not for everyone.  It's a film about depression and about the possible end of the world, so many will see this film as a total downer (though, strangely, I felt pretty good after it was over - watching it was cathartic and visceral for me).

Also, the story moves very slowly.  The film is as much about mood and visuals as about plot, and maybe more so.  I really couldn't blame anyone who dislikes films that are so slow.

Yet, there are many folks out there who appreciate a film like this, who will be completely absorbed and blown away by Melancholia.  If you're this kind of viewer, I can't recommend it strongly enough.  Watching it is a very deep, emotional experience.",1327449600,11,1595,4.637010676156583

Acting is superb and the story is multi-layered.  If you are going just for a science fiction disaster film you are in for a treat...if you can be flexible.  If you can appreciate the humor in dysfunctional families and dysfunctional family events you get still another treat.  The wedding will make any quirks in your family seem mild by comparison.  The approach of the big beautiful blue planet is what you are waiting for and it does not disappoint either....but you have to be patient.  On top of all that, the settings are gorgeous....from the lavish estate and wedding to the surrounding countryside in a country you never quite identify...but it could be one of many in the Western world.  No cost was spared to bring you into another world with respect to the filming.  I am just sorry there was not an appropriate marketing campaign to let the world know about this one.  We stumbled across it one evening with nothing better to do and decided to watch it as one more grade B disaster film.  Boy were we surprised! This film deserves to be in the ""hall of Fame"" of great films but alas...not many know about it.

I'd go along with that. she's always been a good actress. really good choice of roles/characters, even small stuff like eternal sunshine (love that movie also). and here this character is so deep and so sad and depressing, with a bad actress, or even mediocre, it would've ruined it completely. but she's terrific. never looked better either. the whole cast I'm sure must feel very proud of themselves. in terms of filmmaking as an art movies like this are in a league of their own",1327104000,5,1882,4.688821752265861

If Tarkovsky's Sacrifice deals with a similar issue, Von Triers employs Wagner's Prelude and Liebestod as dramatic device, to keep in suspense the narative thread and so, to maintain suspense and so weave together like the pieces of this enigmatic and apocalyptic portrait of human misery that are openly or implicitly in all households.

It's a film that speaks of redemption, the fatuous delusion of a beautiful woman incapable of self-realization, let alone give a word of encouragement optimistic even in the day of her wedding, due to acute existential conflict dragged on its very childhood.

A film hard to watch due its multiple complexities. In case this is your first encounter with Von Triers, I really would recommend you to watch Epidermic in order to understand certain aesthetics codes he tends to use in his films.

Dunst is the real surprise. She achieved an enormous expressive performance as well as Charlotte Geinsbourg.

But first, some negativity: during this movie, a guy sat in the front row ostentatiously playing with his cell phone, stretching his arms, etc.  He was broadcasting his boredom & disgust for the whole audience's benefit.

He seemed to symbolize a common American type: the aggressive philistine.  Not only do they not get it, but they're pissed off at you for asserting that YOU get it.  Sometimes I feel like these people are overwhelming the scene, online and otherwise, in America today.  And so I offer a brief, earnest suggestion to those who know quality when they see it:

Ignore them.  Don't argue.  Reach out to the others who saw what you saw, and share your awe and excitement.  Nietzsche said ""Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster.""  There's no repairing another person's judgment---it's too complicated, life's too short, they have to do it themselves.

Her sister and brother-in-law paid for it and while it was a huge wedding no one seems happy.  To make matters worse there are news reports of a huge planet that is heading toward Earth.  This is one of the hardest movies I have ever had to review.  There are some movies that you put in and they are mindless entertainment.  There are some that make you think.  Then there are movies like this.  This movie is very very deep and full of symbolism, and as much as I'd like to I don't understand a lot of it.  Much like ""Tree Of Life"" there was much more going on in this then just the surface stuff.  The acting by Dunst blew me away and this is a good movie, but very hard to grasp (for me at least).  Overall, a good movie but one that you must open your mind for in order to grasp all of it.  I have to say that this is not my kind of movie though in the way that it seemed to try to hard to be smarter then everyone. I give it a B-.",1325980800,7,1090,3.9045454545454548

This is a visually stunning movie.  It will make you feel things and see things.  I have to compare it somewhat to being high on something.....  it puts you in a dream world.

Stunning achievements in all areas, as well as Kirsten Dunst's acting.  She might get an Oscar for this.  Who knew....?

Melancholia is similar to The Tree of Life with Brad Pitt, and even to Another Earth.....though Melancholia is leaps ahead of them.  I would rank them Melancholia #1,  The Tree of Life #2, and Another Earth #3.

But do see all of them!!!!

I think Melancholia will become a cult film that is brought back yearly to the artsy theatres in  some towns.  I want to see it again, but need to let time pass so I can feel the ""awe"" of it again.

3185488,2,B000VSDNF0,"I had high hopes for this film from its reviews. After about twenty minutes in I started asking my friends if we could leave. This movie was painfully slow and tedious. True, the visuals were outstanding, but that can't make up for everything else. Yes the cast was wonderful as well, but the story itself was mediocre at best. All the characters were incredibly difficult to relate to and they all seemed to have mental issues which made them even more difficult to like. I feel like they could have just kept the first and last ten minutes of the movie (these were the best parts/visuals) and ditched the rest of the film. I have no problem with ""indie"" type films, but this one just didn't impress me. I didn't go in looking for an action movie but I went in looking for a movie with a clear direction. For me, this film was just too all over the place.",1325721600,11,856,4.35625
3185489,3,B000VSDNF0,"The way this movie is drawn out, you might not believe it capable of chest-tightening tension and anxiety.  It is, though.  The ending is foreseeable, after a false turn or two, and is a soul-shattering moment.

Let's go back to the film's beginning, and what is called ""Justine: Part I.""  Justine (played by Kirsten Dunst who's lovelier than I've ever seen her before) has just married and is at the wedding reception.  All of Part I (which is longer than Part II) is in or around this reception.  Somehow Justine has snared a man who clearly had little idea he was marrying someone who sorely needs to be hospitalized for the blackest melancholy, or some other mental disorder.  She repeatedly absents herself, disgraces her newly wed husband, makes love to her boss's nephew on the front lawn, and in general carries on to the point of needing a good slapping or a good medication.

Her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is a paragon of patience and good hosting, trying as she does to keep Justine from flying apart.  Unfortunately for me, Part I had a lot of murmured dialogue I couldn't catch, and since the second part was easily audible I blame the movie.  The director might be trying to imitate real life, but he's got to realize that he's filming for an audience, not for the actors in front of the camera.  Claire's husband John (Kieffer Sutherland) is the poor soul who also has to put up with his sister-in-law's irritating behavior while complaining constantly about the cost of the wedding and reception.  He has a secret, but is the person the audience could most identify with.

The second part is titled ""Claire,"" and in fact revolves around her and her struggle to keep a stiff upper lip concerning her sister, and especially her son.  The wandering planet officially named Melancholia comes into its own now, a beautiful, ominous orb in the sky that gets bigger and bigger.  John sloughs off concern; the scientists have it all figured out he tells Claire, and they say it will miss the earth.  He's still buying emergency supplies on the sly, though.

Justine seems to be rejuvenated by the new planet, at one point melancholia-bathing naked in its greenish-blue reflected light.  It's Claire's turn now to suffer from melancholia, this time from a planet that seems to spell doom for the earth--indeed for all living things in the universe, according to Justine.  As the planet nears, she claims to ""know things,"" one of which is that life on earth is alone, all alone.  When it goes, life itself goes.  That kind of deep gloom sets the final stage, in which a strangely vibrant Justine still manages to be a royal pain in Claire's neck.

Is this the despair that the deeply melancholy feel?  Are there two types of melancholy, a personal inborn one for some people and one that can be forced on otherwise perfectly healthy folks through exterior circumstance?  The movie is beautifully shot with rich color and eye-catching shapes.  It's somewhat claustrophobic since there's nowhere to hide, and Claire's anguish is searing.  A remarkable, if not great movie.",1325721600,8,3087,4.810246679316888
3185490,3,B000VSDNF0,"Danish filmmaker Lars Von Trier crafts movies somewhat reflective of his own character, and experiences. In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Antichrist/dp/B005900DQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Antichrist</a>, a psychiatrist, and his wife, take a vacation, in the woods, and he has concerns that his wife's psychotherapy is not working, while both contend with an unthinkable loss. Lars struggles with depression have been well documented, as have his awkward comments about Nazism at the Cannes Film Festival, which have become a youtube phenomenon. Melancholia was crafted from a depressed state.

It's not difficult to see how personal experience emerges as art, in Melancholia, with depression being represented through a feminine lens mostly through the character Justine, played by Kirsten Dunst. The movie opens with a stunning five minute visual sequence with no dialogue, and a Wagnerian music soundtrack. As this happened, immediately I began to compare it to Tree of Life, although it's the antithetical, instead of creation, birth, and optimism we have a mood piece with destructive overtones.

As the movie begins we see snippets of a story unfolding in slow motion, snippets which will be developed later in the story, a woman in a wedding dress, a pretty face leeched of all energy, a horse unable to stand sinking in mud, and two planets about to collide.

When the movie proper begins we see a bride happy on her wedding day, at a castle in the country, with a 19 hole golf course.

As the evening dwindles down, her happy countenance diffuses, with self serving bitter cynical comments by her mother, played by Charlotte Rampling, directed at marriage. As someone prone to depression, she becomes assailed by lethargy and melancholy. Her sister, Claire played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, comforts her. As the facade begins to fall apart, she has sex with a random stranger, and a destructive confrontation with her boss, also the best man. Next morning her husband leaves her, and she has a breakdown. She remains at the castle owned by her sister, and her brother in law played by Kiefer Sutherland.

Meanwhile, a previously unknown planet Melancholia has emerged from the sun, and heads towards earth. We don't know if it will collide, and end the world or pass by. As it gets closer, its oppressive energy effects everyone, and both Claire and husband exhibit anxiety and depression, while Justine strangely becomes calmer. A mysterious scene has Claire searching a locked drawer looking for antidepressants. To whom do they belong? She, her husband or Justine?

If depression is the anticipation of loss then depressed people may be less troubled by a disastrous future, because they already anticipate loss. The prospect of the end of the world may very well be an antidepressant, as it proposes the alleviation of suffering.

The good points of this movie were its visuals, particularly the acting of Kirsten Dunst, who perfectly and convincingly plays the role of a depressed woman. She acknowldeges she would not have produced this performance without Von Trier. She won the Best Actress award at Cannes in 2011. Coupled with Charlotte Gainsbourg's performance, we have two great performances. Charlotte Gainsbourg previously won Best Actress at Cannes for her performance in Antichrist. One point of interest was the parallelsim of how horses who know nothing of the news finds themselves lacking energy, and how the proximity of Melanchol(y)a effects other peoples energy. Carl Jung said 'perception is projection.'

As someone with personal experience of the subject, I can say Von Trier represents depression effectively, and Dunst represents it accurately.

I have mixed feelings about the movie. I think it will get a mixed reaction from people. Some people will love it, and some people will hate it. If you did not like Tree of Life, you probably will not like this movie. If you did like The Tree of Life as I did you still may not like this movie.

Its slow pace while artistic is not necessarily engrossing. Something of the mood of the characters was conveyed to me while watching, and I had the parallel experience of feeling drained of energy at the time, although now I am glad I saw it.

I definitely recommend getting it as a rental before you buy, and watch Tree of Life first. I hope this was helpful.",1325635200,5,4680,5.388508891928865
3185491,2,B000VSDNF0,"I hav never liked the films of Lars von Trier and 'Melancholia is no exception. Beautifully photographed and supported by a very good cast, Melancholia is an exercise in severe depression. Consider the dictionary definition of the word: 'Melancholia - a mental condition and especially a manic-depressive condition characterized by extreme depression, bodily complaints, and often hallucinations and delusions'.

The film is divided into two parts; 'Justine' and 'Claire'. 'Justine' focuses on Justine's wedding, a depressive surrounded by her also depression ridden family and friends. 'Claire' focuses on Justine's sister, also a depressive who ruminates while a planet appropriately named 'Melancholia' approaches on a collision course with planet Earth. Real or delusion? The viewer cannot say. What can be said is that the film acts out the inner turmoil of depression and ends with the inevitable end of all things.

Slow and plodding the film displays very well the inner turmoil of depression. Unfortunately, the film can be depressing within itself. If you weren't depressed before seeing this movie, you might be afterwards. Have your suicide pills ready because after seeing this movie, you might want to end it all.",1325289600,6,1227,5.4526315789473685
3185502,5,B000VSDNF0,"It's probably accurate to say that MELANCHOLIA is a ""love it or hate it"" movie, and if the Amazon customer reviews are any indication, that's almost certainly the case.  Is there a middle ground?  Well, before I found myself assigning it five stars, I thought maybe *I* was at precisely that place.  I liked much of it, while watching it, but did kind of succumb to its longueurs at various places.  I also couldn't HEAR much of the dialogue, which doesn't seem like such a problem at most movies, so I doubt I have a hearing issue (at least I hope not--with my luck I'd just get a decent hearing aid and then some rogue planet would come crashing into the Earth and making it all for naught anyway).

I'm enough of a literalist that I can't sit through a movie that casts a (very) American actress (Kirsten Dunst)and (veddy) Franco-British one (Charlotte Gainsbourg) as sisters and not grumble at least a bit thatWh no one's even BOTHERING to attempt to match accents (let alone their  and overall demeanor).  We see that they have a British mother (Charlotte Rampling--Yay!)and a dad who seems so out of it, it's hard to tell (but the actor--John Hurt--is, of course, British).  I can't imagine that ALL English speakers sound alike to Danish director, Lars von Trier.  No, he knew what a mismatch this was, and he DIDN'T care.  And why should he/we? Not if the world is coming to an end.

Which, ultimately of course, makes ALL the difference.  People who accuse von Trier of meandering are not totally off base, but they are missing a basic point, I think.  We've all seen at least some of those end-of-the-world movies and have witnessed the hysteria that attends anticipated annihilation.  MELANCHOLIA has a different mood, and it is--you guessed it--a melancholy one.  Melancholia is the name of the ""blue planet"" hurtling toward Earth.  It is also the overriding mental state of the film's main character, Justine (Dunst), who seems to be picking up on the destructive vibe well before anyone else is even aware of the impending crisis.

Is she supernaturally sensitive to the cosmic vibe, or has she always been in a precarious mental state anyway?  Her parents are total screw ups, and her relationship with her wealthy sister and brother-in-law seems rather fragmented and would seem to have a long history of major and minor conflicts.  If she's in a bad way, well, she has her reasons.

Unlike the typical All-American, big budget disaster film, MELANCHOLIA is relatively low-key, and all the more ominous for it. If it's a technically a ""disaster film,"" it's the most poetic, most haunting one since, at least, THE LAST WAVE. In Part I, we see that a few of the characters notice something strange in the night sky,  but it's explained away by someone who seems authoritative enough.  The rest of the first part is devoted to the disastrous wedding reception,  a debacle so understandable in human terms that we only later realize that this time out, the fault may indeed lay as much in the stars as in ourselves.

Weddings, new beginnings, none of that can matter much now.  It is only in Part II that we learn that despite some optimistic predictions that the rogue planet (which has been hiding behind the sun lo these many millennia) may only be a ""fly by"" (like it was w/ Mercury and Venus, we're told).  But we know better, the prologue told us as much.

Lucky for us, we don't have to contend with the panic scenes in urban centers or suburban tracts.  In the final scenes, we observe only the two sisters, Justine and Claire, and Claire's young son, isolated on the latter's rural estate.  No marauding hoards have descended, but what of it?  Total destruction faces them--and everyone--no matter what.  Still, we see a different kind of doomsday scenario.  The world ends with a bang AND a whimper.

Released in 2011,  MELANCHOLIA may well be the perfect film to usher in 2012's ""count down.""  But even if that's not your eschatalogical beat or bent, you may find yourself thinking about this film for days or weeks after seeing it.  It's haunting in the way that TREE OF LIFE is haunting.  Not for everyone, of course, but for those whose tastes in cinema lean toward the darkly poetic (and you know who you are), '11 has proven to be something of a banner year.",1325116800,6,4286,4.681818181818182

Kirsten Dunst is fantastic as the deranged bride at the end of the world. Charlotte Gainsbourg also registers strongly as her sister. John Hurt turns up looking like an alcoholic  Baron Munchausen, Charlotte Rampling is the harridan from Hell mother of the bride (makes you pine for Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS) and von Trier perennial Udo Kier provides a comic relief of sorts.

Von Trier seems to be getting worse as a filmmaker and his usual nihilistic attitudes abound. Women are usually whores, loonies or nutbusters (or a combination there of) and the men are aggressive abusers or doormats.

Apparently making movies helps von Trier deal with his depression, this seems like a very elaborate and expensive way of doing it.

3185505,4,B000VSDNF0,"Melancholia is a viscerally brilliant, and deftly plotted character study. It's more symbolic than it is thematic. Before watching, I was unaware of the director's diffculties with depression and it's influence on the movie. But being intimate with the disease's manifestation, I got the symbolism and found it to be particularly clever and poignant. It's important to dig deeper and not take the hatefulness of the main character at face value. If the end of humanity is imminent and inevitable, and we are fully aware of it, is it wrong or selfish to simply behave within our capacity?

There are two parts to this movie. The first part -- a wedding reception featuring the underlying dysfunction of a wealthy family. The bride Justine, (played well by Kirsten Dunst) seemingly happy and in love, quickly becomes aloof, selfish and self-destructive. Meanwhile the witless groom, her sister and ""filthy rich"" brother-in-law try in vain (through threats, reasoning,  guilt trips and kind gestures of last resort) to get the bride to stick to a storybook script -- or maybe just act like a decent human being. (Think Kardashian wedding. Art imitating life--the bride is playing a part; and even though he should know better, the groom dups himself into believing  it's real, not made-up ""reality"".)

The event becomes a failed exercise at damage control. The faade unravels, as everyone kind of expected it to, just hopped it wouldn't. The wedding is an obvious sham, but you are not sure why at first, just that Justine ultimately does not play along and this brands her as a self-absorbed, ungrateful brat.  But there are hints that Justine has depression -- aka melancholia -- that should not be overlooked by the audience. It becomes clear that she's being forced to ""just be happy"" to make others happy.  She tried, she really did. There are also hints that she has some sort of creative brilliance that her boss inappropriately exploits, even during the wedding reception, and she's fed up. (Also worth noting if you want to look back and try to understand the point of the film.)

In part 2 she's spiraled into major depression and is near catatonic. Now completely hopeless to care for herself, her sister and brother-in-law take her in. Melancholia is now a planet that has emerged from behind the sun and is headed towards a collision with Earth. As the planet  Melancholia gets closer to Earth, Justine's heavy depression gets lighter.  She's caught reveling in its glow. Denial and panic set in for everyone except Justine. It seems she thinks of herself as clairvoyant, or she could at least be idiot savant-like smart. She attempts to convince her sister of this. ""I know things"" she says, and she knows the world is about to end and there is nothing anyone can do about it.

Justine is not crazy - just extremely depressed. And it seems that she's not treating the depression - she's just lets it be, and those around her unknowingly enable it. But perhaps it serves her well in that she sustains a disturbingly steady sense of calm and resolve on the brink of the end of humanity.

Critics say that Justine is too awful of a person - unlikeable and cruel.  But true clinical depression steals away compassion and diplomacy. Justine was enabled, not helped, so there was no hope of her acting any other way. And if she truly ""knows things"" then perhaps happy pretenses were not worth the effort if the world was ending soon anyway.

Melancholia as a planet and a condition is symbolic - we can hope it will us pass by, but it will only end up destroying us.  The sister relies on the husband to reassure her they'll live, the planet will simply pass by, based on whatever scientific evidence he's gathered and selectively deems relevant. He wants her to stay off the internet to avoid panicking, but the lack of TV or CNN, as the world enters its last days, was telling. If she wanted the truth, she could have gotten it. The family was too insular, isolated from reality, more comfortable in denial, cowardly. But is there a ""right way"" to deal with the end of the world?

The reason it is 4 stars and not 5 is simple-I hate the stupid hand held ""shaky cam"" crap-it is horrible film-making. In fact,I will not watch a movie that is filmed that way. I consider it junk film making. The main issue with it is that it takes me out of the film. Is the first half of the film,the Wedding scene,really too long? Or is it just the stupid shaky cam taking me out of the film over and over? I can be captivated by a character,and then the camera jerks around and I am out of the moment. I really hate it-just say no young film-makers,just say no. Use real movie making skills please.

So if I hate the shaky cam so much,why did I sit through this? Because the first 8 and a half minutes may be the most amazing opening I have ever seen on film. It is stunning,and just left me with my jaw on the ground. By the time the shaky cam started,I had to watch no matter what.

The first half may drag,but it sets up the second half. As Justine shuts down and Clair cares for her all seems in order(if a bit nuts)but then it all shifts. And there are moments that leave you breathless. When Clair is outside looking at the planet at night,she sees Justine walking out after being almost comatose during this part of the film. As Clair follows her,you expect something awful to be waiting for you. But when what Clair is seeing is revealed,it may be the most beautiful frame of film I have ever seen. Justine naked by the stream,bathing in the light of Melancholia-I have never seen a woman shown in such deep beauty.

As the end comes,as Justine becomes clearer even as Clair falls apart,there are moments. When Justine says ""Earth is evil-there's no need to greive for it"" it left me moved. When she says ""We are alone"",I felt it. And when the end comes,the power of it just won't go away.

Kirsten Dunst puts on the finest acting performance of the year-there is no other competition. And this movie just won't get out of my head.

It is likely that you either really liked those movies, or that you very much disliked them. Now comes his latest movie, about the possible impending end of earth, and how it affects a small group of people.

""Melancholia"" (130 min.) starts with a 10 min. introduction, in extreme slow-motion, of what the end will look like, when a rogue planet collides with earth. The music that plays along with it is from Richard Wagner, and those introductory minutes reminded me of Stanley Kubrick. After the introduction, the movie plays in two parts, focusing on two women, Justine (played magnificantly by Kirsten Durst) and Claire (played by Charlotte Gainsbourg). It took me a while after the amazing 10 min. introduction to get into the movie, as I think the wedding reception takes too long to play out, but once we get past that, we are in for a treat, as we watch how the main characters deal with/prepare for a ""fly-by"" or possible collision with the rogue planet Melancholia.

In my opinion Kirsten Dunst gives by far her best performance yet, but certainly Charlotte Gainsbourg and Kiefer Sutherland (playing the role of Claire's husband) are equally in great form.

3185538,5,B000VSDNF0,"Where to begin and end about this movie is very difficult, but this is a 5-star film.  It is cinematic and artistic genius.  This film seems to be set in the future...but also the past:  It is ageless.  It is like entering a Maxfield Parrish painting while having Wagner perform live in the background and the neo-classical leitmotif is used throughout the picture.  There are so many interpretations to this film, but I loved the duality of the movie, a good girl vs. a bad girl and a good planet vs. a bad planet and how their roles reverse by the end of the movie. The visual artistry of the film is breathtaking.  Every single frame is beautiful neo-classical art.  The scene with Justine (Dunst) illuminated by blue light from a blue planet -- Parrish blue bathed Justine on the bank of a river -- is the most exquisite frame in the film.  There was an element of improvisation on behalf of the actors courtesy of Lars von Trier (director) and this allowed a more realistic portrayal of characters.  This was pure genius also.  I have watched the movie four times during my rental period and will buy it.  I watch it over and over and each time I come away with a different interpretation and understanding.  It is the finest film of the year and Kirsten Dunst deserves the Oscar for Best Actress.",1322611200,7,1302,4.517094017094017

3185540,5,B000VSDNF0,"Visually stunning, depressing, frightening, sad, intense, heart wrenching, sometimes confusing and mesmerizing all describe this movie. The soundtrack which was primarily from Robert Wagner's Wagner: Tristan und Isolde which is so powerful and dramatic in it's own right, adds to the mood of this movie. Shaky camera, particularly in the beginning: annoying, but adds to the mood. Deep bass, thundering sounds and music soundtrack: powerful and effective. Although some reviewers complained it was slow, for me it seemed a lot shorter than it's actual time of 2 hours and 16 minutes. It's definitely a deep ""artsy"" type of movie, so if you don't like that sort of thing you probably won't like this movie. In the first 6 or 7 minute preview, that moves in slow motion, you get a synopsis of the whole film. You know what's going to happen before the actual story begins.

The rest of the movie plays out in two parts. The first part, ""Justine"", who is played by Kirsten Dunst, shows the bride and her new husband played by Alexander Skarsgard, on their way to their lavish wedding reception at the home of her sister, Clair, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg and brother-in-law, played by Kiefer Sutherland. Justine seems to be in a state of very deep depression, which we know is because of the impending crash of the planet Melancholia into Earth. What should be a happy affair begins to deteriorate right away, from the ride there in a stretch limo which has problems navigating the winding road to her sister and brother-in-law's mansion. By the end of the night she's destroyed her marriage and her state of mind has deteriorated even further.

The second part ""Clair"" shows her sister, who after trying to help Justine to get herself together, begins to fall into a depression of her own. The planet is getting closer and everyone seems more aware. Interestingly, no one is glued to the TV, watching the 24 hours news stations. Her husband, John (Kiefer Sutherland) is an amateur astronomer and is convinced that Melancholia is going to bypass the Earth, but come close enough for a splendid view. He is the optimist in this story. As we watch Clair become more fearful and depressed, Justine seems to accept their fate and becomes more calm and reassures her young nephew, Leo, Clair and John's son.

The movie is heavy with symbolism. Several people have commented on the scene where Justine and her new husband are trying to get the stretch limo up the winding road to their reception. I wonder if the read symbolizes life and it's twists and turns and the limo, people using wealth in an attempt to navigate it and finding that it can cause more problems than expected. In another scene the sticks representing a cave seemed more than a little strange. Perhaps that tries to show that there is no way to escape death and something as seemingly safe as a cave is no more so than a bunch of sticks? I guess the whole movie seems to show how different personalities deal with the inevitable and how they are able to live knowing that it will end.",1322352000,,3050,4.740112994350283

3185582,4,B000VSDNF0,"Taxes got you down?  Cat tearing up your couch again?  It could be worse---earth could collide with a planet!  It's a simple message, but one that ultimately works as a movie concept, in the end, for this reviewer.

No question, this movie can try the patience of even the most diehard cinema fans.  ""Melancholia"" is not a movie for the masses; no explosions or transforming robots. The varying responses of reviewers just goes to prove von Trier's point: people have different personalities and will react differently to all situations.  Those of the ""melancholic"" personality will probably enjoy this film.  It is somewhat slow and depressing, but it's a great way to understand HOW people view the same event through a different ""lens.""  It's a perceptive way to experience what a melancholic-type person sees by stepping inside their mind.

Also, it's money worth spending to see on a big screen, and---more significantly---hearing it in big, surround-theater sound.  I think the first and last 15 minutes will mesmerize any viewer.  I often asked myself after leaving the film: ""Could these two 15-minute segments be attached to show a brief, 30-minute movie that would please viewers?  I decided: no.

The middle section is sometimes slow and painfully fixated laser-beam like on the expressions of individual faces throughout the wedding scene.  Yet, this drawn out pace will reward faithful viewers if they endure for the entire 130 minutes.

In ""Part II,"" the main storyline (the demise of the earth by an interplanetary collision) picks up.  The suspense that von Trier creates is extraordinary.  The setting is sparse and simple; the characters few.  Yet, I really wanted to know how the main characters would respond when the inevitable end finally greets them.

I don't think the visceral impact of this film would be quite the same if watched on my small, desktop computer.  I haven't seen it through Amazon's ""instant video"" system, but I recommend that if you have even the slightest interest/curiosity from what you've heard, go see it on the big screen.

3185583,5,B000VSDNF0,"Lars von Trier, controversial and oft-times enigmatic, is one of the greatest film makers ever. You may not like his films, or even understand them, but they stay in the memory, and Melancholia is no exception. Structured into two parts, it is a story of two sisters, Justine and Claire, played by Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg respectively.
Part 1. concerns Justine at her wedding party, a hugely expensive and elaborately planned affair, detailed down to the precise minute....the entire affair is unraveled by night's end as von Trier brilliantly peels off layer by layer of emotional issues, leaving the externally controlled Justine willingly withdrawn from her preplanned life. Obsessed with the star Antares and it's eventual disappearance, she progressively rejects every facet of her life, of which she is mortally afraid.
Part 2. concerns Claire, the main controller in Part 1, and her increasing fear of death as the planet Melancholia approaches the earth.
Together, the two parts form a gorgeously filmed juxtaposition of fears and obsessions with plenty of symbolism scattered throughout. A memorable example is Claire searching in terror for Justine at night, only to find her nude on a river bank, illuminated in a blueish light from Melancholia, longing erotically for death. Objects are also juxtaposed, such as the bottle of beans in Part 1 and the ""Magic Cave"" in Part 2.
Overall, this is a great psychological and meditative film that, like von Trier's films usually are, never give answers, but do compel you to pause and reflect.",1322265600,7,1561,5.173913043478261
3185584,4,B000VSDNF0,"Lars von Trier's new film, ""Melancholia"" explores depression and its consequences -- loneliness, alienation, fear -- on a personal level inside the heart and also on a cosmic level. The movie was featured at the 2011 Cannes film festival where the leading actress, Kirsten Dunst, (Justine) received the best actress award. During the festival, von Trier made some highly inflammatory comments and was banned from further appearances at the event. ""Melancholia"" was my first von Trier film.

The movie is lengthy and divided into two sections, each of which is devoted to one of the two sisters, Justine and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) who are the main characters. The story is set against the backdrop of what appears to be an impending collision between the earth and a newly discovered planet aptly called Melancholia. Astronomers see the danger (Remember, most scientists now believe that many millions of years ago, an asteroid collided with the earth killing the dinosaurs and other large forms of life.) but they believe, mistakenly, that the two planets will eventually just pass each other by.  In the movie, the protagonists play out their own lives and their own melancholia against what, as becomes increasingly apparent, will be a cataclysmic catastrophe.

In the first part of the movie, Justine is to be married to a handsome, propserous young man, Michael, (Alexander Skarsgard).  The wedding festivities, sponsored by Claire's husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) are lavish and expensive and take place in a decadent old castle. John is not a professional astronomer but has a strong interest and apparently considerable education in the subject. He tends to discount the fears of some scientists that the earth and Melancholia will colide. The wedding festival is set aginst a tone of personal foreboding as well as Justine's long separated parents quarrel and make a scene, and Justine's boss interjects business into the celebration. But the main problem is Justine. She does not love John and she does not understand herself. Justine has relations with someone else during the celebration and her husband-to-be leaves her.

The second part of the movie focuses on Claire, and on her relationship with Justine, with her husband John, and with their young son, Leo. As the movie progresses, Justine becomes more able to deal with her depression while Claire's conditions, initially the stronger of the two, becomes worse. The changing position of the sisters is juxtaposed against the approach of Melancholia which becomes increasingly prominent and certain as the movie progresses. When it becomes apparent to all that doom will occur, John kills himself while Justine, although taking a nihilistic cynical approach to life and its end on earth, provides a measure of strength and comfort to Leo. She behaves strongly and with dignity during what she believes will be the end of life in the universe and on earth.

The acting in the film is excellent throughout and tension is developed through even with some slow moments. The movie has the feel of lush, indulgent 19th Century Romanticism with Wagner's music featured throughout.  The photography and special effacts add a great deal to the movie as the approach of Melancholia to the earth is captured erily, both in the sky and in the reactions of animals on earth. A sense of vertigo is introduced in the last portion of the movie with the camera work which offers a sense of the impending collision.  The final apocalyptic scene is convincingly portrayed.

""Melancholia"" is a subtle worthwhile movie with its themes of loss, sadness, and loneliness on both a cosmic scale and a personal scale.

3185585,4,B000VSDNF0,"I love it when a movie doesn't spoon feed you perfect logic. I like to be slightly challenged with various situations that are open to interpretations. ( insert Tree of Life movie as #1 ) I can see why this movie has a ""love it or hate it"" response. I am torn with loving the visuals and the way it creates so many questions. But with that, I also hate that I have... SO MANY QUESTIONS with the events and characters. (not being able to cross the bridge? What was that all about?) Dunst's did an amazing job of acting ( insert Droopy Dog 'I'm Happy'. ) Her character's evolution of gloom, sadness and depraved depression was both disturbing and yet mesmerizing.

You will be flooded with symbolism, beautiful and romantic sadness and a buffet of character responses to different situations with a shaky camera. This movie had some fantastic moments, almost genius... brilliant and astonishing. There are lessons here to be learned in the layers of situations. How we as humans manipulate and have expectations of each other and how we react when those expectations aren't met. We realize that people are only and I mean ONLY being nice to you because they want something from you. ( that's right, honey badger don't give a #$@&! ). But seriously, what was the symbolism of the horse or the golf cart not crossing the bridge? Was there something symbolic of the limo being stuck on the curved road? Was the marriage a symbolism of failed unity and then the planets hitting one another a symbolism of destructive unity? What on earth was the mother wearing to the reception, a tie-dyed dress? How do a bunch of tree branches equate a magic cave? Why did one sister have an English accent and the other didn't? See, LOTS of questions. The song ""When Worlds Collide"" comes to mind. If you like simple movies that spoon feed you, you'll hate this film. This is a psychological roller coaster ride with some awesome visuals. I feel/think it is worth renting with some intellectual friends to chat about after viewing. Also, there are some great reviews on here (far better than mine).",1321920000,4,2078,4.662125340599455

This is a slow, pensive, poetic movie with a sci-fi twist.  You need to be in the mood for something more on the artsy-fartsy side to enjoy this.  I, for one, loved it.  Thank goodness souls like Lars Von Trier and Ray Lamontagne (singer) have found their calling.  The telling of the human story is richer for it.",1321747200,4,592,4.425925925925926
3185587,2,B000VSDNF0,"MELANCHOLIA is lovely to look at and it's visuals are among the most impressive I've seen in a while. However, like THE TREE OF LIFE, the story and script are so unengaging that I was ultimately bored and highly irritated by the characters on screen. While the actors do justice to the material, it's the material that deadens this film to where you don't care about any of the characters as they are so self-absorbed and mopey that I was cheering for the planets to collide twenty minutes into the film. I won't go into the plot points here, but I found the whole set-up here to be too pretentious and a bit foppish. Dunst's character is so illogically constructed--she starts off as this lovely, smiling bride who is in love with her groom. Then in a matter of moments, she's this sullen, brooding harridan and there's no real segue into her dark descent. Her family members are all cinematic steroeotypes (the complaining sister, the bitter divorced mom and the shady daddy) and speak in generic platitutdes. And the groom is perfectly fine, but the bride decides to spurn him for no real reason and then has sex with a man who she (and the audience) barely knows. I know a lot of folks might think this is ""high art,"" but it's simply shoddy storytelling. Finally, the film turns towards the approaching planet and this is where it completely derides itself--focusing on four characters and their own self-loathing. By the end, I wanted the planet to win! It's a gorgeously made film and well acted; it's just dreadful in terms of its script and overall story.",1321747200,5,1563,4.666666666666667

3185589,3,B000VSDNF0,"There may be spoilers.

In the opening scene we see a bride running through a field while vines of some kind are grabbing at her ankles.  There are flowers in hand, a pond and a horse sitting near a footbridge.  All the while, the dynamic symphonic music of Richard Wagner plays over the dream sequence.  Then a loud rumbling of such magnitude that my two large sub-woofers moved the couch and rattled the pictures.  It was amazing.  I was able to see this film on the HDNet channel at the same time it was released in theaters.  The film then segues to the same bride inside a stretch limo along with her new husband (Alexander Skarsgard) enroute to a reception at a castle that would make Queen Elizabeth proud.  The film is divided into two parts, each named for the only characters that really matter.  Justine (Kirsten Dunst) is the bride.  Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is her sister and the wife of the man who owns the estate (complete with an 18 hole golf course) played by Kiefer Sutherland.

There is some mention early on about the unusual star in the sky.  It is a large planet that is making its way toward Earth.  John (Sutherland) insists that the science indicates the planet will come relatively close but in essence do a flyby.  No one seems overly concerned.  There are no radios or TV playing and certainly no panic by anyone.  Are the scientists making an honest prognosis or are they shielding the population?  We don't know.

Justine begins to act strange but we are led to believe she has some history of mental illness.  Both her parents played by John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling are a bit odd to say the least.  Claire seems to be the one holding everything together.  Justine comes and goes to the party.  She takes a bath, she returns to the party for a toast.  She stares at the sky, she returns.  She shuns her new husband's attempt at romance, but goes out to a sand trap on the golf course to have random sex with a stranger.  She returns to the party for some Champaign.  Eventually, Justine goes into a grave state of depression.  Her husband leaves her at the estate the next morning.  With Clair's help, Justine begins to regain control of her emotions.  She becomes stable, clear thinking and accepting of the situation.  All the while the planet named Melancholia looms closer and becomes a bright blue ball in the sky.  Now Claire becomes paranoid and the sister's roles reverse.

This entire section of the film, while perhaps essential is extremely tedious and unnecessarily long.  The final 30 minutes however switch gears and we become increasingly concerned about the potential collision...even when the foreign planet appears to be getting smaller and drifting away.  Controversial Danish director Lars von Trier doesn't spend any time on explosions, rescue missions, falling buildings, running animals, high winds, flooding or any other typical doom related effects.  What we do get is the sound of the huge planet coming toward Earth.  There go the subs again.

This movie is far from perfect.  The middle is muddled.  Von Trier throws metaphors, religion and subtext at us throughout. We get no substance of the science.  While both parents are British only Claire has a British accent.  There is no discounting the convincing performances by Gainsbourg and especially Dunst even with an American accent.  And I have to admit, I kept thinking about this movie long after it was over.",1321660800,53,3433,4.758913412563667

and/or emotionally.  However, this one did neither.  I am puzzled by the rave reviews.  Bright
and deep jewel toned colors and slow motion scenes of horses falling down just can't carry any movie.
Yes, the house is stunning, as is the setting.  And the images of Melancholia as it gets closer to
Earth are truly gorgeous, a planet that rivals ours in beauty as seen from a distance.  But all of
these are just the props around which the cast has to carry the movie, and the problem isn't the
cast or the props--it's the script.  I read that people are blown away by Kirsten Dunst's acting,
but I just see a flat character moping around an elaborate house, ripping her wedding dress as
she gets out of a golf cart, having bland, quick, unemotional sex with a near stranger, and
standing by calmly as her new husband leaves the wedding with his suitcase, kissing her on the
head, saying ""Yeah, I guess you're right.  I shouldn't have expected so much."" She did a much
better job acting in Spotless Mind.  The only stand out acting and fascinating character I
saw was Kiefer Sutherland's, who brought his character to life (listen to what he barks at
the servant who comes to help him with his monster telescope or what he says when Justine
claims that she's the only one who can ride Abraham.  I'm not a stranger to people with
depression--in fact a number of close family members have struggled with it,so I'm not speaking
out of ignorance when I say that there just isn't enough of life in the script for Dunst to
carry out a fully developed depressed character.",1321142400,6,1658,4.5369127516778525

Be prepared to feel everything the characters are feeling.  The pacing is slow, so even though it's PG-13, most teens will probably hate it.  The plot is also vague, yet the film never strays away from it.  In fact, you won't see the characters interact with anyone other than the main characters, with the exception for the butlers and ""the Bettys"".

What if industrialists try to squeeze every bit of spirit we have left like in this movie?
What if loved ones offer no comfort in hour of need like in this movie?

Besides, I love a good popcorn movie as much as anyone. But I kinda feel bad for the bashers of this film in the same way I feel bad for those who don't enjoy Mozart along with their Nirvana.

Action-packed, it is not. Science fiction, it is barely. For those who have either experienced depression or have had family members struggle with it, the film is likely to hit home in one way or another.

Not for all, but this movie certainly called to me despite my misgivings about Kirsten Dunst's ability to fulfill this role. I'm glad I rented it, and if after watching the previews you too feel a compulsion to see what Cannes was raving about, I'd strongly recommend the rental.

3185639,5,B000VSDNF0,"Let me preface my review by quickly stating that this is a Lars von Trier film. If you know what that means, you don't need to read any reviews or previews to know what you're getting yourself into. You either love or you hate the man's style. If you don't, well, you end up like the people who are giving this a 1-star review because they came in expecting something completely different. All reviews, professional and amateur alike, are biased in regards to his films: hell, even Roger Ebert completely missed the point of Antichrist because his judgement on it was clouded. But heed this - if you want to see Kirsten Dunst naked, you came to the right place. However, if you don't want to see over 2 hours of a slow-paced crescendo of depression and madness, you probably wanna skip it.

This movie is about that: depression. Reactions to heartbreaking events, overwhelming guilt and despair, impending doom, how we handle stress, deal with trivial things in the midst of chaos, things like that. It's the feel-bad hit the winter and everything about it screams masterpiece but it's not for everyone. Mind you, it's nowhere near as graphic as Antichrist or, in my opinion, as saddening as Dancer in the Dark but it's still a downer if you're not in the mood to sit down and really watch a film about the physical/metaphorical end of the world. Hopefully you are, though, because it's one of the best movies I've seen in recent memory. The acting for the most part is spot on (save for Alexander Skarsgrd who seems like he's reading his lines from off-screen), the cinematography is really beautiful, and the subtle sound design feels haunting throughout. For a movie that takes its time, you never feel like it's drudging, which is remarkable since the first half of the movie plays a LOT like Festen, a dogme 95 staple, which DID feel that way a lot of the time to me. If you're on the fence about this movie, gauge it against the other art-house movies you've seen or let the fact that it's bound to grab award noms like crazy sway your decision but, please, don't expect a traditional climax and feel ripped off when you didn't get your slow motion explosions or Sigur Ros music on the last freeze frame. Lars von Trier isn't that director.",1320710400,11,2246,4.615

I don't want to say too much because the film works from a tension poised on the unknowable (yet, somehow, certain) future. Dunst carries almost the entire film with the purest presentation of intense depression I've ever seen from an actor. Also, if Sutherland didn't have such a distinct voice (and forehead) I wouldn't have recognized him. That's a good thing, by the way. The visual effects are perfect and that means a lot in a film that isn't effects-heavy. It is all interpersonal tension even though there is the threat of global annihilation.

3185661,4,B000VSDNF0,"Armageddon is given a surrealistic, chaotic and thoroughly avant-garde treatment that only Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breaking-the-Waves/dp/6305899681/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breaking the Waves</a>) can give such a grave subject. This is no Michael Bay-style extravaganza of bombastic special effects but rather a brooding mood piece that is bound to frustrate as much as it impresses, quite often in the same scene due to von Trier's emotionally jarring, uniquely idiosyncratic perspective. At the same time, this 2011 drama is probably his most accessible work for a mass audience, even if it amounts to a study in psychological depression. The narrative splits evenly into two parts revolving around the lives of two sisters, Justine and Claire, on a large estate owned by Claire and her no-nonsense husband John.

The first part, entitled simply ""Justine"", is about her elaborate wedding to Michael on the estate and how their reception deteriorates into emotional chaos and deception. Initially, Justine appears to be a carefree bride, but she turns out to be a rising creative director at an ad agency gradually revealing herself to be a manic-depressive on a path toward self-destruction. This part of the film is filled with von Trier's penchant for shaky hand-held camera shots and awkward confrontation scenes that turn the party into a social apocalypse. The second half, entitled ""Claire"", carries forth the natural consequence of the failed wedding with Justine in a catatonic state and now within the context of the impending collision of a rogue planet called Melancholia. The inevitability of the situation causes the sisters to transform their natures relative to each other - Justine changes from fatalistic to near-spiritual, while Claire moves from protective and insular to uncontrollably fearful.

As with several of his more renowned films, von Trier has assembled an eclectic cast of actors whose differing accents would come across as puzzling if this was not clearly one of his ensemble films. Keeping a relatively low profile of late, Kirsten Dunst delivers a powerful, sometimes unsettling performance as Justine, a near-impossible role that takes advantage of her combination of unforced winsomeness and singular introspection. Looking nothing like Dunst, Charlotte Gainsbourg (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Antichrist/dp/B003KGBISO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Antichrist</a>) is watchful in the more restrained role of Claire even as her character spins out of control toward the end. As her patronizing husband John, Kiefer Sutherland has to play close to the vest exuding contrived optimism in the face of insurmountable odds. Charlotte Rampling and John Hurt make their few moments count as the sisters' emotionally disconnected parents.

Stellan Skarsgrd shows up as Justine's manipulative boss, and his real-life son Alexander plays Justine's smitten betrothed. It's interesting to note that Penlope Cruz was originally slated for Dunst's role, but her delayed schedule on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-On-Stranger-Tides/dp/B005COPWZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides</a>&nbsp;prevented her participation and yet another accent to the hodgepodge already presented. The film feels overlong at 135 minutes, especially with von Trier's often lugubrious pacing, but his cinematic artistry is in full bloom in the hallucinatory introductory sequence of images which initially confound but then reveal all too clearly where the story is going, all to the strains of Wagner's Prelude to ""Tristan and Isolde"". The ending is handled with surprising subtlety and poignancy. This movie will not be everyone's cup of tea (which may explain its appearance on Direct TV prior to its theatrical release), but the more patient and thoughtful among us will be rewarded.",1320537600,4,4013,6.04920913884007

Melancholia is painful to say the least.

How bad was it?

The first ten minutes are ultra-slow mo, beautifully composed shots. They all have a fairy-tale aesthetic to it.

Then we're thrusted into present day world. The blushing bride is probably one of the most depressed characters I've seen portrayed on screen. She can't put on a smile for her own wedding and goes on to do atrocious acts like having sex with a stranger and peeing on the golf course. Obviously we're not fond of our protagonist at this point.

I kept waiting for it to get good but honestly this film is just a pretty portrait of meaninglessness. It's not hard to catch the metaphor and undying theme: A planet named Melancholia is set to collide with earth, destroying all life. Lars Von Trier paints us a picture of how pointless everything is and how we'll all die anyways.

I almost started feeling that way watching the film but thankfully Tree of Life reminded me how worthwhile life is.

Lar Von Trier, I respect you for making a beautiful film like this... but dude lighten up. I know you've got it in you after all those jokes at Cannes. Please make a comedy or a film that actually gives the viewer a good experience rather than an endurance test.",1320451200,7,1266,4.526315789473684

Being a huge fan of Lars Von Trier's work I was highly anticipating this film. It was released in cinemas on 29 May 2011 in the Czech Republic on 12 screens as well as other locations like Denmark, Finland and Italy. It soon will come to theaters in the US. Luckily we live in the time that we do and this movie can be streamed before its US theatrical release. I took advantage of this and greatly enjoyed watching this film from the comfort of my own home.

I loved Antichrist. In my opinion it is Trier's best work. It was a very disturbing film, yet it had a very strong message with hidden meanings and was all around a beautiful poetic piece of work.

Melancholia also is a beautiful film, though I believe I expected more. Antichrist is very deep and constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat because so much is happening and you must decipher the message and meaning of the film. Melancholia is very slow and drawn out. Lars Von Trier did this due to the high anticipation of what will happen, and if it will happen. Trier used the characters anxiety and built upon that and made the viewer feel that anxiety too. Just like Antichrist, Melancholia is a feeling. Your not just watching a movie, eating popcorn and drinking a pop, you are feeling this film.

Just a quick summary for those who don't know, Melancholia is a planet which is seemingly coming closer to Earth. This phenomenon happens when Justine (Kirsten Dunst) has just been married to Michael (Alexander Skarsgrd). Justine's sister, Clair (Charlotte Gainsbourg), her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland), and Justine and Clair's mother Gaby (Charlotte Rampling) greatly put pressure on Justine to have this perfect wedding. Justine is not very interested in the wedding reception and seems to come in and out of reality. She is not the type of person to have such a large wedding because she doesn't care. She is a wild girl who seems to have been roped into marrying Michael and marrying into this new family which she is nothing like. There is a lot of drama in this film and for the first half, Melancholia is a back story which the viewer patiently waits for.

The cast is amazing and works well together. I really enjoyed Kiefer Sutherlands character. Kirsten Dunst did an amazing job, however her performance seems unbalanced at times, though the character she is playing is unbalanced.

After viewing this film I was left speechless due to the raw power of the cast and the images of the film itself. However it made me feel very uneasy, disturbed and very anxious. I immediately thought, ""I never want to watch that again"". Yet I cannot get it out of my mind and I watched it again later that night.

This film makes you think and ponder your own existence in this world and how you would face such a horrid calamity as an Apocalypse. It will either catch you in its grip or make you wish you were somewhere else...there is no middle ground with this film and you will come away with a totally different outlook on many aspects in your life. I give it a 5 star for one, Kirsten Dunst is a superb actress in this film and all the characters add their own bit of balance to her dilemma. If you don't like having to search your own feelings, or deal with apocalyptic scenarios, then this is not a film you'll want to see. But, if you are able to look at it with an open mind and ponder how it would make you feel then you'll want to watch this awesome film. Highly recommended.",1320192000,6,933,4.247191011235955

The idea for the film originated during a therapy session Lars von Trier attended during treatments for his depression. The therapist told him that depressive people tend to act more calmly than others under heavy pressure, because they already expect bad things to happen. It's not about science fiction and it's not a disaster movie. It's a film that examines the human psyche during a disaster. The film is very subtle and yes slow at times  but as someone whos struggled with severe depression I related to and understood Kirsten Dunst's character so much. We're dealing with such flawed and sad characters so the slow pace made sense. I would say this is more of a psychological drama than anything else. This film is so beautiful and the acting is superb.",1319846400,651,873,4.6688311688311686
3185700,5,B000VSDNF0,"`Melancholia' is a film that is going to be extremely divisive.  Not everyone is going to appreciate this, and yet there are going to be some that laud this as one of the finest films ever made.  I can certainly see its flaws, and yet there is this underlying captivating atmosphere that I can't help but wholly appreciate.

`Melancholia' is a unique and engrossing experience that is less what it seems and more what you'd come to expect from an auteur as controversial as Lars von Trier.

The opening montage of cataclysmic destruction plays out like a Vogue editorial shoot captured in slow motion.  It seems almost anticlimactic to show us the end before the beginning, and while I understand that this cinematic trick (or gimmick) is initially rather off-putting and presumes to fail the overall purpose of the film somewhat by showing us the cause of concern before we truly understand the concern building in the key characters, it works in a way that I can't quite explain.  I personally was rather upset with the sequence upon watching it, but as the film tied itself together I found myself calling it to mind with awe for I saw how the pieces of that puzzle came together in an unexpected way.

And, one cannot forsake its beauty.

And then the actual film starts, which is broken into two sections.

The first part of `Melancholia' focuses on Justine, the bride.  Her lavish wedding begins with promise.  Her `filthy rich' brother-in-law has paid for the spectacle to take place at his gigantic home, complete with a butler, an 18 hole golf course and a slew of guest rooms (with baths, not showers).  The joyous couple show up late, thanks to an oversized limo and some narrowly curved roads, and then all joy seems to evaporate as Justine's intense depression sets in and begins to erode her happiness.  Everyone around her fails to understand her condition, even though most of them try (especially her groom and her sister).  Justine seems bewitched by a red star she seems looming overhead; a star that goes unseen by the others.  This star sets a strange precedent for the remains of the evening as Justine's behavior becomes more reclusive and catatonic almost.

Bridges are burned, relationships are broken all hope is lost.

The second half switches focus to Claire, the elder sister.  While Justine is certainly suffering from depression, Claire begins to delve into paranoia as the impending collision with the mysterious planet Melancholia grows closer and closer.  They don't ever say how much time as elapsed since the wedding, where that `star' first reared its head, but Justine is still sulking in misery and the agitation she caused on that `blessed day' obviously still lingers.

""It tastes like ashes.""

With only five days left before Melancholia is supposed to `pass' Earth, Claire and Justine begin to come to terms with the inevitabilities of their futures.

At the core of `Melancholia' is a sharply constructed look at mental instability and the effect it has on our own personal survival.  Justine's character is of particular interest because her depression, which is initially assumed to stem from the planet traveling towards Earth, is almost eased by the foreknowledge that the end is coming.  She possesses a unique bond with the planet, a connection (as seen by her nude moon-bathing) that helps ease her dissention since she is obviously of the accord that life on Earth is corrupted; infected with an evil that, even in its most unintuitive form is still prevalent and contaminating.

For her, eradication is a way out of a life she cannot support.

From a technical standpoint, `Melancholia' is something special.  The imagery is stunning.  Lars von Trier has a great track record of using a film's cinematography to eclipse the viewer and sustain his themes.  `Antichrist' was a film that suffered in conception and yet it was sustained to a degree thanks to the beautiful and captivating way in which it was shot (not to mention Gainsbourg's phenomenal performance).  Here, the night sky is illuminated by cascading stars and eerily shifted cloud structures.  Even the murky yet polished way in which the close-ups are rendered is astonishing to watch.  I was really taken by the nostalgic score, one that embodied the same sound and atmosphere as the classic apocalyptic and science fiction films.  The drama is there, bolded with each swell in the music.

Performance-wise, the film belongs to Kirsten Dunst.  She is remarkable here.  This is a truly restrained and intimate performance, no real showboating or dramatics involved.  Instead, Dunst takes a far more realistic look at depression by holding it all in.  Sure, she has her crying fits and breakdowns, but she internalizes so much.  I'm so happy for her Cannes win, especially since Oscar will most likely look the other way (they like their actresses to SHOW their pain), but I completely concur with many who say this is quite possibly her finest work.  She has been one of my favorite actresses for years, and I am so thrilled to see her making some intriguing and rewarding film choices (she should have won the Oscar last year for her tremendous work in `All Good Things').  I also was wholly impressed with Kiefer Sutherland, who dwelled in the skin of his character, adding little touches that made him feel complete as opposed to a mere prop (unlike the younger Skarsgard, who just proved uninteresting).  Kiefer portrays an odd warmth, paternal and yet elusively selfish.  You can see his colors changing as the film progresses, and his many shades, while never blatant or wholly exposed, haunt long after he's left the screen.

In the end, `Melancholia' is probably the strangest `apocalyptic' film you'll ever see, and while it contains certain flaws, those flaws are swallowed and digested by the films ravenous pluses.  The pacing is extraordinary (don't listen to the naysayers claiming this film drags, for it most certainly does not) for it allows the impending dread to set it slowly, meticulously, calculated and yet entirely natural so that you feel yourself letting go as you watch Justine and Claire prepare themselves for the afterlife.",1319587200,8,6170,4.94180407371484

3185704,4,B000VSDNF0,"""Melancholia"" may be the most accessible Lars Von Trier film I've ever seen. (However, for a director who often goes out of his way to alienate, repulse, and irritate his audience, that is not saying much.) ""Melancholia"" is beautifully shot and visually lovely to look at; gone is the difficult visual minimalism of films like ""Dogville"". Also gone is the gory brutality that is often part of Von Trier's films (especially his last film, ""Antichrist"".) ""Melancholia"" is a thoughtful, fascinating film told in two distinct, yet overlapping, parts.

The first part, ""Justine"", is a realistic, sad family drama which tells the story of a young bride who implodes on her wedding day. Just married to a handsome man, promoted by her boss, and treated to a lavish party by her rich brother-in-law, Justine has every reason to be happy. Except she's not. Behind her forced smile, she's hiding a dark depression. By the end of the night Justine's depression, along with the selfishness and dysfunction of those around her, cause her to destroy both her brand new marriage and her career, and spiral into a dramatic depressive breakdown. Von Trier seems to have a deep interest in female protagonists who are being crushed by the expectations of those around them. In films like ""Breaking the Waves"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"", the characters were treated to sordid and gruesome abuse, but in the first half of ""Melancholia"", Justine is a more or less ordinary person suffering in a more conventional and relatable way.

The second part of the film, ""Claire"", puts the focus on Justine's older sister. Claire is concerned about the reports in the news that a previously unknown planet, named Melancholia, will be passing close to the Earth's orbit. While most scientists believe that the planet will pass at a safe distance, there are those who also believe that an imminent collision will mean the end of the world. Claire's anxiety about the situation builds as the planet comes closer. Claire is also dealing with her sister's (Justine) post-wedding nervous breakdown. As the planet grows ever closer to Earth, the tension builds, until the characters are left to deal with the very real possibility that the world is going to end.

By splitting the film up into two parts in this way, ""Melancholia"" explores the themes of loss, destruction, impermanence, and loneliness, first on an intimate scale (""Justine"") and then on a global scale (""Claire""). Although the film is provocative and often painful, it's more subtle and nuanced than any of Von Trier's other films I've seen, and perhaps more affective.",1318809600,346,2597,4.993071593533488

It is a beautiful and thought-provoking drama about belief in relationships and the pain that is felt when relationships end.  Or even more deeply, when one's past experiences or beliefs cause one to have no hope that one can find happiness in any kind of relationship.  *** SPOILER ALERT ***  The story is told through the highly unconventional metaphor of colliding planets and the extinction of all life.  Justine's depressive behavior, Claire's search for an emotional connection and the dysfunctional nature of the entire extended family are portrayed via the incredibly powerful symbolism of the blue planet.  But the planet is not the story - planets do not suddenly reverse themselves in their orbits, and horses and electric golf carts do not suddenly stop at a specific bridge.  As Justine says to Claire when the latter is trying to reach the village, ""This has nothing to do with the village"".  She is saying that a person cannot run away from what is in his/her mind.

The early scenes at the dinner reception brought to mind the similar shakily unease of the same wedding-related dinner sequences in Jonathon Demme's excellent ""Rachel Getting Married."" (Although ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is still his greatest picture.)

Von Trier's previous film, ""Antichrist,"" was great in the sense that it came directly from his own disturbed psyche, and without any sugar-coating just to get an R rating. That was what made it fascinating to me.

""Melancholia,"" however, is a truly great film, even a classic one, if I may be so bold (and I'll take that as a ""yes""). It is Von Trier's best picture (""Dogville"" is now in second place). Absorbing and intimate, ""Melancholia"" is a probing examination of what it means to be human, as well as what it means to be a part of humanity.

His films (Dogville, Dancing in the Dark, Europa, AntiChrist, Breaking the Waves) explore the use of stage sets as though we were in the legitimate theater instead of a movie theater, uses the camera in a fashion that makes allows the viewer the feeling that we are overhearing or secretly observing of the characters the actors are portraying, writes stories that seduce us to think vertically instead of horizontally, and paints his films with music that is unexpectedly poignant to his story. Such is the case with MELANCHOLIA, a film that is yet to be released, one that likely will have a small audience in the art film houses, but at the same time for those fortunate enough to see this work of cinematic art it will jolt into the realm of possibilities about the end of life as we know it.

The film opens the way it ends: a planet named Melancholia hidden by our sun circles into the earth's atmosphere and collides with earth.  The extended opening sequence is carried out is gorgeous pictures that reveal a tranquil stage set as the strange collision takes place - all to the Prelude to Wagner's 'Tristan und Isolde' (beautifully played by the Prague Philharmonic with some arranging from music director Kristian Eidnes Andersen).  The two hour film is dived into Part one: Justine and Part two: Claire.  Once the action begins we discover Justine (Kirsten Dunst) - in full bridal regalia - and her husband Michael (Alexander Skarsgrd) attempting to manipulate a wedding limousine to the mansion where Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) and their little son Leo (Cameron Spurr) have been waiting for hours to begin the vastly expensive wedding party. Present at the party are Dexter (John Hurt) this discombobulated father of the sisters, the girl's vitriolic mother Gaby (Charlotte Rampling), Justine's boss Jack (Stellan Skarsgrd), a new speech writer for Jack's company Tim (Brady Corbet), Michael's parents (James Cagnard and Deborah Fronko) and the wedding planner and assistant (Udo Kier and Jesper Christensen).  The party is tense and we slowly realize that Justine is 'distracted': she seems to be suffering from a form of melancholia and spends her time at the party unwisely (a physical encounter in the garden with Tim, napping, and always at odds with Claire and John, and eventually wandering off to be alone, away from Michael.  There is a new star in the sky that the people dismiss but that some say is a planet headed in a collision course with the earth.  In Part two we find Justine being returned to Claire's home, disheveled, and the relationship of the sisters is more fully explored.  There is an air of anxiety - the time of the predicted collision is approaching and the manner in which all observe what follows is at once terrifying and eloquently meaningful.

The entire cast is brilliant. Many viewers may find this film a preposterous apocalyptic vision, many will see it as an overly long and self indulgent artsy piece by von Trier, but the beauty of the film is not only in the visual aspects and the musical aspects of the production but in the intensely realistic view of a truly dysfunctional family - and perhaps that is the driving force of the collision of relationships as we currently view them that merely marry the metaphor of Justine's melancholia with the incipient act of the strange planet Melancholia's collision with earth.  Do we care to mend our existence, or do we passively wait for the consequences of now?  Grady Harp, October 11",1318118400,9,3653,4.883683360258481
3185742,4,B000VSDNF0,"The star power on this little film should be a clue that something extraordinary might be  happening here;
and something remarkable is.
No...not just the denouement....a planet really is hitting earth.

It's the conspiracy of creatives to say something very real and honest that the media is suppressing.
Make no mistake: this is a literal metaphor.
The ""dysfunctional family""  are archetypes,  wherein Keifer Southerland's
character  stands in for the """"Elite"" and the rest of us are waiting painfully for the Bride
of Christ to be revealed. There is no rapture in these two hours...but there is truth aplenty.

3185743,5,B000VSDNF0,"This movie is both visually and emotionally stunning. It tells a story about a young woman and her dysfunctional family coping with convention, and then ultimately, the end of the world.

This is a wonderful film for people who appreciate avant-garde cinematography, science fiction, Kirsten Dunst, and apocalyptic stories. As an astronomy student, I had to suspend my disbelief regarding the physics of Melancholia's movement as the movie revealed little scientific detail, often prompting questions.  However, the special effects and their integration into the cinematography were flawless and very entertaining.

The actors were gorgeous and I appreciated the choice of very little makeup and tasteful costumes. I wish the wedding part in the beginning was about half as long and feel the movie got more exciting once into Claire's part but still loved all of it very much. Lars Von Trier is amazing.

 Thank you for such a great movie.",1318032000,4,939,5.233333333333333
3185744,1,B000VSDNF0,"This is another pretentious claptrap that uses CGI for some fancy animation about death (ENTER THE VOID, PAN'S LABYRINTH) for 10 minutes, then it's 2 hours of boring, rich white folk's problems shot on a handheld camera. I'm sure Lars von Trie thought he was satirizing the Bourgeoisie, but he really romanticizes it. I've seen more interesting things come out of my dog's ass.  On top of how dull it was, the Amazon download froze in the middle, so we had to reboot the Roku, which made the film even longer.",1318032000,12,509,4.593406593406593
3185745,3,B000VSDNF0,"""Melancholia"" is part of the six-part V-cinema series called ""Series Kyofu Yawa"" (""Series Horror Night Tale"") that includes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Demon-Hunting/dp/B000QCU9H6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Demon Hunting</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Coffin/dp/B000SSQ7LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Coffin</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legend-of-Ogre/dp/B000VSDNEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legend of Ogre</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Site/dp/B000SSQ7LU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Site</a>.  The series is a try-out for new talent, and director Takaaki Ezura is making his first feature here

The Kyofu Yawa series is extremely low-budget, filmed on digital video and staring mostly amateur cast.  The level of filmmaking and action is about the same as a cheap TV movie, and no one should mistake this for a feature film.  At 90 minutes ""Melancholia"" is a pretty short flick.

The story follows a group of friends who gather one last time at a park that will soon be developed into a housing complex.  One of the girls is moving away, and the friends are saying goodbye.  The girl moves in with her aunt and uncle, and things start to get weird from there.  In her new house, she hears noises coming from a room that she is forbidden to enter.  Meanwhile, her old friends are being visited and murdered by the same girl, who appears to be able to be in two places at once.  Eventually, secrets start coming out and she learns that she is a twin clone, created by a mad scientist who wanted to do a study on human morality and raised two genetically identical people in different circumstances to see how they would come out.

I have seen a few of the Kyofu Yawa series, so I know what to expect and keep my expectations low.  For what it is, ""Melancholia"" isn't horrible.  The cloning story adds some interest to a standard doppelganger plot, and the director and actors do their best in the confines of the budget.  I have seen much, much better low-budget horror flicks, but I have also seen worse.

For the lead actresses, Kyofu Yawa likes to recruit from the world of Japanese bikini models, and making an appearance here is Hikaru Kawamura.  Hikaru looks pretty, but her acting mainly seems to consist of grabbing her head and screaming.  I don't see a long movie career in front of her.

Also, anyone seeing ""bikini model"" should not get the wrong idea.  There is no cheesecake and Hikaru remains fully dressed as does everyone else.  Anyone expecting a gore-fest had better look elsewhere as well, as the killing happens mostly off-frame.",1289347200,,2769,5.790123456790123

8219700,5,B000VSDNF0,"Amazing film. This experience felt like a good piece of literature. The end result of this film is about accepting our eventual end. You literally feel the panic of oncoming death to the point where in my case there is a sort of acceptance of mortality as the end result.
This is an adult movie more designed for philosophy students or any one interested in talking seriously about the big questions in life.
The topic here is material for a round table discussion format philosophy class.
I was surprised by the on point performance of Kirsten Dunst and not surprised by the top notch performances by a whole list of Von Trier regulars.
Gainsbourg ends up stealing the show in the second act taking over the objective esque human perspective in relation to core fears everyone experiences during life.
Von Trier is quoted as saying the film was almost to easy. This is an appropriate remark knowing his mischievous personality.
