8379691,2,B000KGGOFY,"...this DVD is too short and uninformative for the price. I purchased it prior to getting my pug, and it didn't give me any info that I didn't already know from the TV or books. I hope the money at least goes to the TV station, then I can consider it a donation. I recommend purchasing the ANIMAL PLANET book on pugs if you're looking for information and pictures.",1231286400,,364,4.2898550724637685
