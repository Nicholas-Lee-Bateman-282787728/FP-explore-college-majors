7969832,2,B00006IJ07,"This movie is (loosely) based on a movie of the same name, which starred Robert Culp, and which I saw late at night on TV in the mid 1980s. Having seen the original, I can't really recommend this version (although I do think that Rob Lowe gives a very good performance). The problem (as an earlier reviewer remarked) is in the script. Jennifer Grey is given very little to do (or say) and the supporting characters are so under-developed, that you can't even remember their names. (And just when you think that you might actually start to get some character development, the film takes the lazy way out by featuring some rather annoying musical montages.) The movie's setting has also been changed to New York City (as opposed to the unknown, upper-middle class suburban neighborhood of the original version) and, as a result, the violence is a lot less jarring and shocking than it was in the first Outrage. (After all, violence is fairly common-place in any city, but especially so in New York, therefore it's impact was significantly lessened here.) In Robert Culp's Outrage, the violence hits you in the face with a wallop and while, unfortunately, the original version is not available for purchase, you CAN see it on Utube (uploaded in 10 minute increments, by a poster named Instant Vengeance) and I highly recommend for anyone who liked this remake to go immediately over to Utube and watch the original Outrage. You won't be sorry.",1399680000,,1440,4.810483870967742

7969834,5,B00006IJ07,I absolutely love Rob Lowe and I absolutely loved this movie. I definitely give it a two and a half thumbs up!,1382659200,,110,4.045454545454546
7969835,5,B00006IJ07,"This movie is awesome! It stars Rob Lowe and Jennifer Grey, who are a young married couple about to have a child. Without giving the plot away, they become the target of theft, harassment and home invasion. The bad guys in this movie got my blood boiling, because I just wanted to see them get what they had coming to them. They are so cruel. However...this is not a movie about chopping off heads and blood baths. This is about a couple who fall victim, need help, try to get help, and can only hope that they will get justice. Some movies are so predictable that you just know how they will end. This one has you guessing all the way through and you just are not sure if the good guy's will end up 'on top'. All I will say to that is...Guess you'll have to watch to find out! Check it out!",1036454400,20,791,4.142857142857143
