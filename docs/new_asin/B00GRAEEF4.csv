8626365,5,B00GRAEEF4,"I think this is the best entry in ESPN's 30 for 30 series so far.  It is incredible going back in time seeing what every teams picks were for the 1983 draft.  It was amazing to learn that John did not want to go to Baltimore and could have ended up on several different teams.  In the end the Broncos had to give up very little to the Colts to actually get him which was crazy.  Just a few 2nd round picks.  Seeing all the other teams in the league pass on Dan Marino was extraordinary. My own home team the Seattle Seahawks drafted a running back Curt Warner who was decent but nowhere near as good a player as Marino.  At the time Seattle had not had a franchise quarterback do anything other than be mediocre.

The documentary goes pick by pick of what each team was thinking at the time.  Dan's home town team the Steelers wanted him but decided to pick a top defensive player instead to rebuild there team.  Jim Kelly was selected by the Bills and similar to John Elway he didn't want to play for that team and decided to jump ship to the upstart USFL instead.

John would have been a decent to really good baseball player for the Yankees but never a HOF like he was at football.  In the end he made the right decision sticking with football over baseball and I think he was happy in Denver.  I didn't know his wife was from Washington State.  Imagining the Seahawks getting Elway or Marino would have been a nice reality.  It looks like the consensus was that a lot of teams thought Dan was a party boy not serious about winning and that was the furthest thing from the truth.

The documentary makes me feel very sorry for the Jets fans Marino was just sitting there ripe for the pickings in the middle of the first round and they pass on him.  This is a great documentary one that I could watch over and over.  It is pretty fascinating looking back in hindsight which direction each team went and how the picks ended up changing franchises.

If you like football you will love this documentary.  I would highly recommend this documentary and rate it 5 stars.  It is very well done in all aspects with interviews from several coaches and players give it a lot of credibility.  I can't say enough about it, this is a must watch film for any sports fan.  You could tell that when the Dolphins drafted Marino that look on his face was determination.  Dan even says at the end of the show he couldn't wait for that season to start so he could make the rest of the league sorry they didn't draft him.",1462406400,,2501,4.285714285714286
