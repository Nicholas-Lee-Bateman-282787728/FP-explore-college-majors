4517908,3,B0050QNO84,"I'm not a huge fan of this DVD, but I really like the Rodney Yee abs yoga section, so I guess that evens it out. It's a very calming and relaxing abs yoga routine. The rest of the DVD is not my style.",1366848000,,200,3.6744186046511627
4517909,5,B0050QNO84,Whether I'm feeling energetic and strong or tired and weak I can find the perfect sequence for me in this series of ab workouts.,1365638400,2,128,4.375
4517910,4,B0050QNO84,"I actually purchased this because I had Rodney Yee's Ab for Beginners on VHS and wanted a dvd version.  I was not disappointed to find that it had 5 valuable AB workouts from Yoga, Pilates and Cardio for pennies... paid under $7 and well worth it!!!",1350950400,4,249,4.413043478260869
4517911,5,B0050QNO84,"Love it!!  Great variety.  I am hooked on Patricia Moreno.  She is excellent, what a motivator!! This CD has become one of my top 5 favorite workouts for the week.",1348272000,3,163,4.366666666666666
4517912,3,B0050QNO84,disappointed that DVD only had one workout that was by Rodney Yee. When the discription said by Rodney Yee I assumed the whole DVD was by him. The workouts are not all yoga which is what I thought I was buying.,1346198400,4,210,4.146341463414634
4517913,2,B0050QNO84,I am not sure why anyone is giving this easy dvd anything more than 2 stars. The yoga section is very good and the 10 minute cardio core sculpt. that's it. The pilates ones are so so easy and quite frankly a joke. either i'm mega advanced or the pilates sections are made for true true beginners....overall I wasted my money yet again. I haven't found a better ab workout than Cindy Whitmarsh or exhale core fusion dvds........,1326499200,4,427,4.487179487179487
8451684,5,B0050QNO84,I especially like the yoga for abs and the core energizer. I like to do both on most days. Ive lost inches off my waist and improved core strength and energy level. Today I started adding some more strength training.,1526688000,,216,4.425
8451685,4,B0050QNO84,I like the short workouts in here. I tried doing the short morning workout with the cardio segment but consistency has been nice to failure. Anna Caban is not the only instructor on this video. I have enjoyed Ana Cabab Pilate moms videos since I used to go to equilibrium Pilates here in my hometown a few years ago. I guess could relate her style of teaching to the style of teaching that I am familiar with from the studio.,1521676800,,425,4.325
8451686,2,B0050QNO84,I didn't really like this DVD because it took a long time to actually get into the routines.,1461628800,,92,4.166666666666667
8451687,3,B0050QNO84,Hi I'm not in good enough condition to do some of them but I'm working on it. at 76 it takes a little longer,1432598400,2,108,3.5416666666666665
8451688,5,B0050QNO84,Great product and fast delivery.,1417132800,,32,5.6
8451689,5,B0050QNO84,This DVD has multiple videos by other instructors on tilkc,1406160000,,58,4.9
8451690,4,B0050QNO84,"Something different every day to keep different portions of the abs from getting bored. Tone, shape, sore, abs and then one gets to work another part the next day.",1402876800,2,163,4.655172413793103
8451691,4,B0050QNO84,"The routines are fine but please ""shut up!"" It is an exercise tape that will be used with some frequency. There is no reason to waste 3 minutes of that time with desert vistas and exercise philosophy. Just get to the routines",1390262400,3,225,4.380952380952381
8451692,3,B0050QNO84,"She wanted it, watched it once and now it collects dust!!!!
Just like most the exercise things I buy !!!!",1388188800,2,105,4.3
8451693,5,B0050QNO84,Lots of compliments everyone loves to talk about my case it is unique and differ and most of all fashionable,1367971200,,108,4.45
