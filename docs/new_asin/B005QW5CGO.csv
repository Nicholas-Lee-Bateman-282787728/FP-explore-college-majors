8483899,4,B005QW5CGO,"This isn't really about the Aswang, though you learn something about the legend, it's really about the cultures and the nature of myths.  A good documentary, not a must-see, but worth seeing when you've got the time.",1493683200,,216,4.837837837837838
8483900,5,B005QW5CGO,Informative and fun. My husband has talked about Aswang for a long time and this helped me understand the things he was told as a kid in the Philippines.,1453766400,,153,4.310344827586207
8483901,3,B005QW5CGO,"I a looking for a different movie for this evening because Its like food; sometimes you crave of something you haven't tried for a long time. However, I am not here to write bad comments about this documentary. I believed in few of their story like KAPRE or TIKBALANG (a dark colored horse with horse face and body but its hand is like a man. They mostly lived in a huge tree), small shadow people also lived in the tree, witch and voodoo were also practice by some people esp. those who live in rural and uncivilized place, white lady/ghost and 666 cult ( although, I never encountered these group). When I was a kid; the 666 cult were already popular. They take children and killed them (for their blood sacrifice and organs are being been sold) and my mother never let me walk by myself to go to school (I always walk with neighbors or my brother). The victims were thrown into garbage: blood dried out and without organs. I experience some of them so I believed in them. But the aswang, manananggal, tiktik are all folklore (you won't see any proof) except those people from ""baryo"" or lived in a mountain area thought they were haunted by these creatures and they were only used as a character for filipino horror movie. I have a neighbor before that lost her 3months baby (miscarriage). When she born the fetus, its dried out. She and her family believed that ""Tiktik"" was responsible for her miscarriage. Theres no picture of evidence (none for all these century) of these creatures unlike here in US, they have few footage like the UFO, Big foot, sasquatch, Dracula, lake monster but haven't confront them to see them closely nor touch them if they are real and not just a costume (remain a mystery). I respect filipino beliefs because I am still a filipino and I lived in the philippines for 28 years (I was born there) so I know most of it.",1424736000,,1850,4.508928571428571
8483902,4,B005QW5CGO,"I liked the documentary approach to the myth of the Aswang -- a very strange Filipino version of vampire/witch/whatever.  The author showed how the myth had developed in different parts of the Philippines and looked for the source of the myth.

I think it may have had more of an impact if it had been produced in conjunction with an actual Filipino scholar of Filipino culture such as the late and greatly missed Enrique (Ike) Escalante.  But it was still informative and gave good insight into how Filipinos interact with the myth.",1405382400,,533,4.771739130434782
8483903,4,B005QW5CGO,"I almost became an anthropologist, so this was particularly interesting to me. If you are just looking for a fast paced paranormal romp, this isn't for you.",1376352000,,156,4.814814814814815
8483904,5,B005QW5CGO,This documentary is the best documentary on the origins of the Filipino aswang. Not only does it try to get to the origins of the Aswang but it also explores how it has affected Philippine history and the Filipino psyche.,1365638400,,221,4.55
