6014402,4,B00FM4S7P4,"Although not quite as funny as the third season (the loss of Abe Vigoda and the absence of Jack Soo in the last few episodes contributed; the loss of the live audience half-way through the season and the introduction of a laugh track didn't help), this season was still quite funny and should show current trash like Brooklyn Nine-Nine how to properly do a cop comedy.  It is odd, however, that Abe Vigoda is featured on the DVD set cover when he only appeared in two episodes (one as a guest star) and co-stars Steve Landesberg and Ron Carey who appeared throughout the season AND in the opening credits are not.  Some buyers may be disappointed that Abe Vigoda is not featured more in this set.",1381190400,15,696,4.515873015873016

6014434,5,B00FM4S7P4,"One of my favorite shows from the 70's. Had the first three seasons, wanted the rest, started with this one.

The show's cast did change over the 7 or 8 years it was aired, but, in my opinion, it was always a quality show, from the first to the last episode. If you knew the show then and you feel the same way, you'll love this DVD.",1423958400,,333,3.970149253731343

6014456,5,B00FM4S7P4,"I thought this was one of the best shows to come out of that era. The show was funny, well written and done in good taste, I don't know whether I would say all the episodes are for the whole family, some of them might lead to embarrassing discussions with very young children, but there was no nudity or sex scenes. Its a shame TV is no longer as good as this.",1395792000,5,360,4.013888888888889

6014458,3,B00FM4S7P4,"I remember my dad laughing himself into a coughing fit at this show. I gobbled up the first three seasons, which were great classic 70s comedy.
Season four brought changes however that hurt the show. The loss of Abe Vigoda to an ill-advised spinoff and the addition of Steve Landesberg and Ron Carey as pale replacements. I never got what was so great about Landesberg, his charater was dry and annoying. There was much less of Jack Soo, I assume because of health problems.
There were also more 'ripped from the headlines' stories which date the show and make the comedy look forced and preachy.
Then there was the inexplicable beginning of Barney's divorce. Which made no sense since Barbara Barrie was no longer a regular on the show.
I suppose Danny Arnold was trying to be more 'relevant' like other preachy 70s sitcoms. Real shame.
I will be stopping at season four.",1395187200,,872,4.705882352941177
6014459,5,B00FM4S7P4,"Barney Miller was one of the all-time great police comedies. It took a season and a half to get the format down and by the third season, the formula was set for a successful further 6 years. In this fourth season we see Sergeant Fish reluctantly retire from the force and Detective Dietrich, a strange but funny intellectual with facts on just about any topic that arises, join the squad full-time, along with Officer Levitt who constantly badgers Barney to make him a detective.

Low points in this season are few: Sergeant Yemana's frequent absences toward the end of the season are pretty much it, along with the loss of Fish as a character, though he pops up later on.",1390435200,11,672,4.6
