2415473,4,B000BF0CMA,"When talking about South Dakota, Mount Rushmore bumps into my mind as the first impression. Having been there in 2005, I'd like to know more about it. One thing I have to admit is that I chose THC for its better looking cover than that of PBS.

This film details the history of Mount Rushmore. Doane Robinson is the first to come out the idea of Mount Rushmore for attracting tourists. He invited Gutzon Borglum, artist and sculptor, to the Black Hills and persuaded him to accomplish this idea. The work started from 1927 and ended in 1941.

The background and personality of Gutzon Borglum are well covered. Although the reasons to choose the four presidents on Mount Rushmore are explained, it is not detailed enough. For me, this is the biggest disappointment. The technology to carve the solid stone is petty inclusive. They built a 1:12 miniature model and then carve according to it for maintaining the precision. In addition to the dynamite, the honeycomb structure is also employed. Some dreams, however, are not finished even though the whole project is called completed due to insufficient funding.

Another disappointment is that the controversy among Native Americans, especially the Lakota tribe, is not mentioned. That's why the Crazy Horse Memorial was also constructed in the Black Hills.

Despite the two flaws, I think this film should be good enough for most people.",1174780800,6,1386,4.961206896551724

8085907,5,B000BF0CMA,"Excellent biography and photography.  I knew each head was very large, but did not realize how much they had to haul away.  Also how large their noses were, and why Thomas Jefferson's head was looking upward - because of the crack.  I thought Abraham Lincoln was looking down because he was deep in thought. It is also nice to know the word that describes them.  - George Washington - Fortitude, Thomas Jefferson - Vision - Theodore Roosevelt - Vigor - Abraham Lincoln - Faith.",1401062400,2,477,4.642857142857143
