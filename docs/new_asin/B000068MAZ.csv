1725187,2,B000068MAZ,"- The plot is typical of any fantasy movies.
- The fighting scenes are laughable.
- The special effects look like those of a TV show with a shoestring budget.
- The acting is below average.

It's more like a TV show than a movie. I regret renting it.",1251504000,,250,4.1020408163265305
1725188,4,B000068MAZ,"(I noticed a lot of people have submitted reviews here for the older Horror flick ""Wolfhound"". I hope people don't skip on this title because they read a review for the wrong movie.)
Wolfhound was a slave as a child, but won his freedom. He is now hired as the personal protector of a princess on a perilous journey. There are some great battles, creepy environments, goofy tribal encounters, and a bit of sexual tension between the two leads. Nothing strikingly original, but a well made and acted movie with beautiful scenery.
I really enjoyed this movie. It's a great addition to anyone's fantasy collection. I wasn't impressed with the English voice over, but it is great watching it it in Russian with subtitles.",1249948800,9,717,4.790322580645161
1725189,3,B000068MAZ,"Based on the novel by Mariya Semyonova and directed by Nikolav Lebedev, ""Wolfhound"" is a Russian-produced swordplay fantasy that follows the usual formulas set by the 80's movies of sword and sorcery such as ""Conan the Barbarian"", ""The Beastmaster"", ""Deathstalker"" and ""the Sword and the Sorcerer"". The film may be the most production-extravagant outing by Russia, boasting of elaborate special effects, great set designs and costumes.

In the period of magic, druids and curses, a young boy was left to die in the darkness of the mines. He is the last survivor of a clan called the Grey Hounds; the young boy rose up in slave mines to become a mighty warrior called Wolfhound (Aleksandr Bukharov). Consumed by a lust for vengeance, he sets out on a quest with his companion, a bat who can't fly. He seeks out the ones responsible for his pain, a warrior called the man-eater and a warrior-druid called Zhodoba. Things become a bit complicated for Wolfhound as there are other things that may prove to be much more important. Apparently, the followers of Zhodoba is bent on unleashing an ancient evil called Morana, buried by the ancestors of Princess Elin (Oksana Akinshina) through the power of the God of Thunder. Wolfhound must protect the princess and defend the people of Galirad. The fulfillment of his destiny is at hand...

The film's plot is pretty textbook as with other films of sword and sorcery; a brooding warrior, a princess that needs protection, a mage (played by Andrei Rudensky), a slave boy (Artyom Semakin), a barmaid (played by Eugenia Sviridova), a kindly vision (Natalya Varley) and ancient evil to be awakened by an evil sorcerer. Destiny, love, and honor play a large part in the film's screenplay. There may be nothing wrong in following other successful formulas established (since blockbusters often come from such) but the problems with the film is that the film is a little too brooding and moody. The screenplay introduces all these characters and the narrative appears to be broken into other mini-stories, while the characters may play a part in the film's plot, it feels too episodic and it kind of feels as if the film could've been edited a little better. It spends a lot of time trying to establish Wolfhound's character that he is a good guy, (his background is even told in a song) through the introduction of some characters he rescues. It dilly-dallies too much in unneeded plot devices, that the viewer may become a bit confused.

The action in the film is decent on occasion, but I have to be honest, I have seen a lot better. The swordplay is your usual `hack and slash' with our hero cutting down the bad guys. There is a lot of action, but it is nothing too impressive to the action junkie. It does also get a little repetitive after awhile, Wolfhound swings and the bad guy goes down. The final fight between the hero and Zhodoba is also a little too underwhelming. I do believe that the camera work could have been done a lot better. There seemed to be too much going on the screen that the viewer may become a little lost. The camera work in the action scenes would have done well if it hanged back in a perspective view, so that we can see the action. The fights aren't really as bloody as I would've wished, just an occasional severed arm and bloody stabs. For a sword and sorcery flick to succeed, it has to be more intense, the fight scenes are just a little weak.

The film's strength does lie in the top notch cinematography and art direction. I have to say Marat Kim's photography is movie magic. The film does look nifty, the set designs and costumes are pretty good. The scenes do have the aura of fantasy about them, but not too fantastic that it lacks realism. The camera work consists of birds-eye views, sweeping pan and scans, and awesome scenery. I have no knowledge of Russian history so I can't really say if the costumes are traditional or not. They do look authentic, and even the costumed swords look very real and shiny. I liked this approach because it balances out its fantasy elements with a charm that one can relate to, and keeps the otherworldly fantasy from becoming too elaborate and over-the-top.

The performances are decent for the most part; I thought the main lead played a very good Wolfhound. He does have a brooding personality and fits his role. Oksana Akinshina is definitely charming as the princess Elin, she is beautiful and you could just believe that she is a strong willed princess. The supporting cast is ok, but the ""cute"" earthbound bat just steals the show. I guess one can blame the convoluted storytelling that the supporting characters aren't as well written as the two leads.

While ""Wolfhound"" failed miserably in the action scenes, the CGI effects were decent and comparable to the swordplay adventures we've seen through the years. The final act is just a grand display of visual effects; it may look pretty but hardly enough to save the film. I guess I still have this idea that sword and sorcery flicks should have great action scenes and it is just a sin for one to have such weak action. ""Wolfhound"" will never be a significant entry in the swordplay genre because it dropped the ball with the shoddy action. To its credit, the film is nicely shot and the plot is acceptable but a hero just can't be a convincing hero without him being heroic. He just looks like a big ""meanie"" with a huge sword...

Rent It! [2  Stars]
Video/Audio: 2.35 ratio anamorphic widescreen. The picture is good with some muted colors to convey mood. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Russian Language track is powerful and very clear that you can hear the clanging of swords. There is an English dubbed track. No extra features, the dvd is bare bones.",1249862400,13,5726,4.684890656063618
1725190,3,B000068MAZ,"The main reason I ordered this for the store was the amount of heated debates centering on what movies it copied and actual filming location comparisons (Russian landscape). For an estimated 20 million dollar budget, they gave it a heck of a try.

Per Weinstein protocol, they managed to do the usual bare bones DVD and no distribution. But for what this is, it manages to convey an interesting story with some epic CGI and a great deal of beautiful Russian countryside. The cover art states ""Conan meets LOTR"", and that is relatively fair. There is plenty of corn and cheese to go around like Conan (tons of extra blood and bad fighting), and way too much storytelling (almost 2.5 hours worth) for a non fan (that water village with the Hawaiian-looking queen was schmaltz central).

The film quality is promising and competent throughout, but the sound is a killer at times. I tried watching the English dub and that was an absolute mess. They remove the credit sequence and dub the bad guys with weak voice work instead of the overdone Russian monster mash. Watching the Russian version almost felt like they either mixed it wrong in the editing room, or they never recorded sound during the exteriors (dubbed in later). The CGI looks great during some sequences and average in others, but the winner goes to that bat. You read about this main guy's sidekick everywhere, and I have to admit he felt like he flew right out of being the owl in Clash of the Titans, but he entertains in his own little way.

Probably worth the watch for those fans wanting a fantasy epic that never completely delivers, but definitely has a high production look to it. I have read the story changed quite a bit from the books, but it might be watchable. No special features (there should be tons), Russian and English 5.1, rated R for violence, brief nudity and cheese. Enjoy.",1249084800,3,1859,4.661585365853658
1725191,5,B000068MAZ,"While the cover may promise CONAN and LORD OF THE RINGS, fantasy fans will find a lot of unique elements in Wolfhound beyond those two seminal series. What keeps bringing me back to this film is the imaginative look at early Russian Mythology, particularly the benign gods and how Volkodav (Wolfhound) uses the elements of Good and the Light to defeat the darkness.

Playing Wolfhound is Russian actor Aleksandr Bukharov who invests his brooding protagonist with some very primal realism. The fact his sidekick is a pet bat doesn't hurt.

While the story is something we've seen before, the unique way its told makes it fresh and new.

It takes a lot for me engage in a double dip purchase, but Wolfhound is one of those I am glad to buy again.

If you're into High Fantasy and appreciate unique twists on good vs. evil, you'll enjoy Wolfhound.",1245542400,36,844,4.6824324324324325
1725192,4,B000068MAZ,"A man and his family returns to the land he grew up in to help settle his inherited estate and to do some writing in an environment with few distractions.  But there is more to the sleepy town and countryside than meets the eye.  Irish wolfhounds seem to run free (a local legend helps explain why this is so).  The man's parents seem to have liked chains.  A local tough seems to be able to be in charge.  And the people just seen unusual.

While the man has flashes of his early childhood he delves into the secret of his family.  A beautiful and naked woman haunts his dreams and possible his waking hours.  As his interest grows to obsession, his family life begins to crumble.  But slowly he begins to see who he is and what is going on.  The innocent eyes of his children may see more than he does.  Finally he must prove himself to himself and the town, especially the mysterious motorcycle-riding tough.

A very interesting film that pays close attention to atmosphere and feeling.  The viewer is slipped details and not hit over the head with them.  The story builds subtly but steadily all the way to the very final scene.  Entertaining and moody.  A very good film that deals with an interesting legend without getting hung up in effects and sensationalism.

1725193,5,B000068MAZ,"Let's hypothetically fantasize that we can leave this rat race environment, shuffle off to Ireland, and confine ourselves in an ancient home in the depths of an isolated land beyond reality.  We move there, with our wife and two young children, to write a book...a book about our heritage and our roots.  But what happens when you discover your roots are a little rotten...and that the quaint village is filled with horror...fear... animality...and decadence beyond belief?  That's what ""Wolfhound"" is all about...a film about the bizzarre world of non-belief...wild dogs...""cool dogs"" as the young daughter states.  This one, based in Ireland, is a pure Stephen King look-a-like.  It is a cross between ""Sleepwalkers"", ""Cujo"" and ""Pet Sematary"".  It is a one-of-a-kind European horror classic that is strictly for adults.  The innocent bride of the novel writer says it all when she tries to get her husband to make love in the confines of the isolated surroundings.  ""Just because we are in the woods, it doesn't mean you have to act like an animal,"" she says.  He has no choice.  This wicked envrionment, and film, is a masterpiece in its own right.  It is a hauntingly original classic.  If you like Stephen King flicks...you'll love ""Wolfhound"".  On a scale of 1-10 (10 being the highest in the King scale), ""Wolfhound"" gets a solid 10.  Remember...it's borderline NC-17 rated film...in other words...a very tasteful adult horror film...for your eyes only.  Haunting...erotic...and a film you probably want to cuddle with your lover.  Stephen King could learn a lesson from this classic.  As with all movie reviews henceforward...I've also attached a picture of the letterbox.  ENJOY!  PAUL",1071014400,11,1695,5.142857142857143

Special effects are oddly better than most big budget US made films. Perhaps it's the lack of overdone CGI.

It is nothing more than a re-do of the same old

It is nothing but a badly pieced together film with chopped
up fight scenes that have no cohesive breadth in any part of
the film. There is not one fight scene that does not use multiple
cut-a-ways to make you think that someone is actually fighting someone
else.
In many of the scenes, you can actually see the group of people waiting
just before action is called; GIVE ME A BREAK!
How anyone could give this piece of junk anymore than one star is
beyond me.
Did you watch the same film as I did???????????
From chopped up scene, to chopped up scene, there is no way to figure
out an actual plot (you other reviewers know what a plot is don't you?).
You flip through scene after scene and if you are lucky, two or three scenes in
a row make some sense.

Hopefully this is the first and last Russian film I try to sit through!

1725204,3,B000068MAZ,Aleksandr Bukharov - as - Wolfhound - does not show the physicality required to play the role of a warrior.  Russel Crowe or Arnold would have demolished the opposition - both in physicality and acting skills.  Yes - Arnold would have demolished Bukharov in acting alone.  In spite of these short-comings - this Russian Fantasy Film was enjoyable to watch - but - did not have anywhere the depth of LOTR - although the potential to have made this a much more mature and meaningful film was certainly there.  And - yes - per previous reviewer comments - the bat definitely does steal each and every scene that it is in.  A more physical lead - and - a director who would have let the actors show their capabilities would have made this a truly outstanding film. As one final note - a dark film does not have to be so dark that you can't see anything.  Look at the truly wonderful job Peter Jackson did with LOTR - dark and darker - as the film progressed - but - you could see and feel everything that was happening around you.

The begining of the movie is a total Conan rip-off, and alot of the story and characters are similar to lord of the rings. Having said that, i did enjoy watching it, the dubing and cheesey acting made this a pretty entertaining movie.

The boy ""WOLFHOUND"" , is later shown as a man, after avenging his dead people, he becomes the protector of a blind man and a young woman, they meet a caravan who are attacked by the last person he needs to kill for the death of his parents, and a quest to uncurse a princess and her kingdom begins. It's not a bad movie for a direct to dvd, the special fx are ok, wolfhound has a pet bat that can't fly thats pretty kool, and i think if you liked some of the bad fantasy movies from the 80's, like deathstalker and barbarian queen, you'd probably enjoy this (no nudity in this though).",1296864000,,1108,4.383495145631068

All in all I do not think Wolfhound was bad, there are some good characters and it is a bit different take on the whole wereanimal/shapeshifter theme. The problem with this movie however is that it is bland, the town it all takes place in are bland, the inside of the protagonist home are bland, the drama between the protagonist, his wife and the lovely weredog woman who becomes his lover are bland, to put it plainly, this movie get boring at times.

Wolfhound have allot going for it, however it moves to slowly and the filmmakers seams to forget they are working with a visual media. There are scenes which are great, but there is also so much which is just mediocre. Also I did not like the ending, I am not going to spoil things here, but it leaves so many questions unanswered.

This movie only got a 5.8 rating on the IMDB website, which I think was far too generous (probably rated by Dungeon & Dragon heads). This one is definitely a rotten tomato.

The next minute, he's an adult with scars on his face, he has a sword, and carries a bat which cannot fly. So what happened during those missing years? If he was a slave, how did he get free? What's the significance of carrying a bat that can't fly? Where did he get the bat? I had to back the movie up to make sure I didn't accidentally fast forward thru a part of it.

While obviously owing much to LOTR, Conan, and a number of other fantasy epics, Wolfhound has its own charms, and flaws. The production is pretty good, with plenty of good sets and thrilling chases/battles/swordfights, though the makeup can be very laughable at times. The English dubbing is quite well done, and the acting is about what you'd expect: primitive, but likeable enough for the most part. My favorite performance was actually by the CGI bat, sort of a very old school parrot for old Wolfie, perching on his shoulder, dropping rocks on his enemies, and generally being a very useful pet. If this movie can help bring more awareness to the possibility of bats as fine friends and brave personal bodyguards, it was not made in vain.

While not one of the great sword and sorcery films, Wolfhound has a certain Russian/Northern European flavor that distinguishes it from its Hollywood brethren and makes it worth watching if you enjoy this kind of film. Plenty of action and pleasantly goofy adventure guarantee a good time for your inner teenage boy. Plus that bat is awesome.",1274745600,,1097,4.89247311827957

Poor direction, cliche' from beginning to end, and the voice overdubbing is horrible. I watched this one all the way through then tossed the dvd in the trash.",1271808000,,372,4.567164179104478
1725217,4,B000068MAZ,"Wolfhound was one of four low budget fantasy movies I rented one cold, rainy weekend this past Autumn. I rented four DVDs, knowing from past experience that among four unknowns I might get only one, or at the most two, good movies in the batch. The Russian film Wolfhound was that one good movie. The others looked like they were directed by kids just out of film school and told to make a fantasy movie because ""that's what's hot right now."" You can tell when a movie is made by someone who is a fan of that genre as opposed to someone just there for the paycheck. Even though Wolfhound borrowed some elements from Conan the Barbarian and The Lord of the Rings, you could tell that the writer and director were  well versed in Russian fairy tales and folklore-and more importantly-that they enjoyed these stories. Yes, the acting is overly broad sometimes and the special effects are not going to compete with Hollywood CGI, but Wolfhound has respect for the genre, something missing in most low budget Hollywood fantasy films.

Have you noticed that the big budget fantasy movies made in the last few years all got their stories from outside the Hollywood system. Why can't Hollywood get fantasy movies right these days without outside help? It used to know how to write a good fantasy story. Think of all the great fantasy movies made in the 40's, 50's and 60's: The Thief of Baghdad, Ulysses, Jason and the Argonauts, the Sinbad movies. There were a few bright spots in the 80's (Excalibur, The Princess Bride), but things petered out in Hollywood until The Lord of the Rings made Hollywood realize that money could be made again in fantasy movies.

To take things back to Wolfhound, watch this movie and I think you'll find it compares favorably to the kind of fantasy movies Hollywood made way back when. See if you don't agree with me that the directors of all the best fantasy movies believed in their stories and had respect for their genre. Now compare these movies to most of the low budget fantasy movies that go direct to DVD today. What went wrong? Hollywood seems capable of making great home-grown scifi movies these days (accept for the dreck made for the SyFy channel), so why not fantasy?

On a related note: I would argue that the best fantasy movies Hollywood ever made were the biblical epics of the 40's and 50's (just because a story is true doesn't mean that it can't have elements that fit well in the rules of fantasy stories; in fact I would argue the opposite, that most Western fantasy stories take their rules and structures from the Bible. Tolkien called the Gospel ""a fantasy story that happens to be true""). If Cecil B. DeMille and the crew who made The Ten Commandments were alive today Hollywood could once again make great fantasy movies without having to leave the studio lot.

1725221,1,B000068MAZ,"This movie was unwatchable to me. I actually stopped it some two thirds in and just couldn't take it anymore. The plotline is a complete ripoff of Conan the barbarian. The whole movie is cliche, cheap, pretentious, over-acted. Just plain awful, think Beastmaster 2, well, this would be worse than that..  Lord of the Rings? are you kidding me??

1725222,4,B000068MAZ,"Yes, it has an opening almost copied from Conan the Barbarian and Peter Jacksonesque sweeping shots (I don't mind them at all). Yes, there are some missteps in editing and the villain has the most unoriginal,boring helmet/mask ever (Come on creative guys-a skull with beastly fangs and horns?!) But!
The movie succeeds on many other levels that make it a great, epic fantasy adventure. The director has done a great job in composing the whole thing the right way-by building up tension, enriching the storyline with new characters that all contribute in one way or another to the grand finale, revealing the mystery surrounding the hero and the plot itself step by step and delivering a great message at the end. Camera work, costumes, makeup (excluding a few bad wigs and the mask of the villain)all look amazing.
It's a very good movie that a director can be proud of and a fine fantasy adventure!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wolfhound/dp/B001F0TM44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wolfhound</a>",1253059200,2,1033,5.544303797468355
1725223,4,B000068MAZ,"First, the potential viewer must understand that there is nothing new here, just typical fantasy-type stuff: our hero is out to avenge the massacre of his peaceful villagers, a princess must be sacrificed to the forces of darkness, the portal to the other side must be opened so that the ultimate evil can rule the world, etcetera.  Once you understand this, you can relax and enjoy the film.

I found the directorial pace a little on the different side, as the story unfolds very quickly from the get-go, establishing background, characters, and situations.  When it gets into the 2nd act and slows to a more conventional pace, it felt almost like a breather.  As the film approaches its climax, it picks up again, but this aspect made the movie seem longer than it was, I feel.  The fight scenes were similiarly economical, and, though suitably spectacular, were nothing to write home about in this day and age of FX extravaganzas.  In fact, since there were so many of them, it would have been nice to have some Hong Kong fight choreographer direct them, though I suppose this would have tainted the ""russian-ness"" of it all.  Yegads!  I've become a hollywood-ized philistine!  Yet, one gets the impression that the director was aiming for the U.S. summer blockbuster atmosphere.

The scenery is breathtakingly beautiful, evoking Peter Jackson's ""the Lord of the Rings"".  Indeed, the hazardous mountain crossing scene leading towards the finale is reminiscent of LOTR's Mordor landscapes, with forbidding rocky crags and angry gray skies, while the forest and plains scenes make excellent use of Russia's stunning vistas.  This should make it palatable for those who enjoyed LOTR, unless they are jealous fanboys enraged at the lack of dwarves.

But it is the cast and the spell-binding way they breath life into their obligatory characters that make this film shine.  The hero looks like the embodiment of the russian spirit, the women are beautiful in a wholesome way that is diametrically opposed to the cheap, transitory tinsel of the latet hollywood babe, and they play out their roles in a way that makes the viewer forget that what he is watching is conventional and predictable, making us care about the characters in the process.  This makes watching the movie a delight, and raises it to a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.  Surprisingly, though I watched the dubbed version, the voice acting was mostly good, the main noticeable goofiness being the hero's boyhood self in the beginning being dubbed by an obvious adult speaking in a higher tone  (why do they always do that?  I'm reminded of an old kung fu movie where THEY DUBBED A BARKING DOG!  I guess we wouldn't understand a chinese dog bark.)

Fantasy fans owe it to themselves to catch this one as long as they aren't expecting anything revolutionary.  Lovers of good cinema will enjoy it also, if they are just looking for good characters, acting and cinematography.  In fact, I think it's worth watching a second time.",1251590400,2,3006,4.887573964497041
1725224,5,B000068MAZ,"IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS! THEY ARE MOSTLY FOR THE WRONG MOVIE WITH THE SAME TITLE (some werewolf movie) - I am telling you this 'WOLFHOUND' movie is simply INCREDIBLE!!! There are so many people who would LOVE this movie IF they just watched it! I'm a big fantasy movie fan (Lord of The Rings are my favorite movies of all time) and I have to say that the same powerful feeling of being swept away both imaginatively and emotionally while watching LOTR can be found in this epic fantasy masterpiece as well! It's that powerful! This was such an astounding movie experience that I just HAD to get on here and set the record straight! Fantasy movie fans (AND FANS OF 'GREAT MOVIES' IN GENERAL) cannot afford to miss this movie! Negative comments about the special effects are completely UNFOUNDED! I don't even like most of the CGI that is used in modern movies but the special effects in 'Wolfhound' are right up there with LORD OF THE RINGS! That may sound like a stretch but this movie had a huge budget and employed the greatest craftsmen in Russia and beyond. The CGI work is absolutely flawless and the epic battle at the end is full of great effects that perfectly compliment ONE OF THE BEST FANTASY MOVIE ENDINGS EVER! There are a few melodramatic 'Beastmaster' moments (not that that's necessarily a bad thing) in the first 30 minutes but don't let that fool you. This movie matures very quickly and becomes an engrossing fantasy adventure filled with very likeable characters, sweeping vistas that will make you want to visit Russia ASAP, and imaginative scenes of sorcery that will totally amaze you! The haunted swamp scene will go down in history as one of the all time greatest fantasy battles ever! (DON'T WATCH WITH THE GOOFY ENGLISH AUDIO TRACK- THAT MAY BE INFLUENCING NEGATIVE REVIEWS - WATCH WITH SUBTITLES FOR A MORE SERIOUS & POWERFUL EFFECT THE WAY THE MOVIE WAS INTENDED TO BE VIEWED) And yes, I'm man enough to admit I actually shed some tears at the end! That hasn't happened since the LOTR movies. This movie deserves SERIOUS ATTENTION! (I envy those who were able to experience it in the theater!)
