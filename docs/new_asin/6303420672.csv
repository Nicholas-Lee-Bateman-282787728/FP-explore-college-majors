7846001,5,6303420672,"This video not only shows the engineering and construction aspects of the building of the Golden Gate Bridge, which was very interesting, but also how all of the citizens of SF pulled risked their homes to back up the project, durning the Great Depression Era. They had a vision of creating something great, came up with a plan to accomplish it, and were willing to take a great risk to carry it out. Anyone who has actually been to the Golden Gate Bridge would appreciate that it was a worthy venture. So, it was very inspirational to see this video.  My kids also enjoyed see it.",1226361600,,581,4.481132075471698
7846002,4,6303420672,"The Golden Gate Bridge is the icon of San Francisco. Although it is not the longest suspension bridge any more, its beauty and fame still top all.

The necessity, design, construction, and impact are stated. Computer animation is used for some explanations. The maintenance and security after 9/11 are also addressed. Compared to the counterpart by PBS, this film tries to stay at the balance on many aspects while the PBS version focuses on the people constructing the bridge. In addition, this film has more modern and beautiful footages of the magnificent Golden Gate Bridge while the PBS version has almost its documentary before 1930's.

So if you are just interested in getting a general picture of the Golden Gate Bridge, this one is for you.",1171065600,13,749,4.936507936507937
7846003,4,6303420672,"The Modern Marvels series pays due diligence to the real history and mystique attached to our physical culture.  Without getting bogged down this documentary deals appropriately with the engineering, the people and the bridge itself.  An enjoyable Sunday afternoon view that hints that not all of our history is as transitory as todays Internet age can make you feel.",975801600,3,367,5.203389830508475
