8588824,5,B000JLTSFI,"I was reading ""No Beast So Fierce"" by Edward Bunker when I watched the film. So I easily plunged into Trules's uncle adventures. I liked the con but that's Eric who caught me.

The movie is much more about him : his face, his family, his work, his soul, his desires, his achievements, his faults, his inclinations, his creative impulses, his reasons why... HIM.

I even felt a little ashamed watching it : I had the feeling to be stealing a piece of his life, a piece of himself... or rather to be a Peeping Tom. But it was because of my own conflicts. Trules's introspection is certainly intense but never obscene.

Eric Trules caught me and touched me.

He says he doesn't want to romanticize his uncle. He doesn't want his uncle to romanticize him. What about his audience? After watching ""The poet and the con"", I guess none can help it. The tittle itself leads us in this direction.

Let him catch you. Do not let slip the opportunity!",1168819200,,940,4.473684210526316
8588825,5,B000JLTSFI,I saw this documentary at a screening a few years ago and it blew me away.  The intensity of introspection pried through his relationship with his convict uncle forces the viewer to question his or her own composition.  I'm thrilled this film has made it to the pubic eyes.  View it and be oddly entertained and enlightened.  - sj,1165363200,2,330,4.5423728813559325
8588826,5,B000JLTSFI,"Eric Trules's ""The Poet and the Con"" unearths interesting connections between two disparate life choices and sheds light on the creative forces within us all. What is to be determined by the viewer is where the lines in life are to be drawn, and whether a new school of thought may be silently evolving... a new level, new ideas. GREAT FILM",1165363200,,340,4.590163934426229
