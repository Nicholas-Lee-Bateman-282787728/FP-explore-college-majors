I thought it would be more of a documentary with some music clips thrown in, but it's just interview after interview.  No disrespect for the folks interviewed, but there was nothing really new or enlightening here.  Would not watch again.  Rent it from Amazon videos.  No need to own the DVD.",1521158400,,436,4.538461538461538
8612192,5,B00F429ZYG,"This is an amazing DVD! I loved hearing from Lorrie, as she told of her ups and downs in a way that has never been presented before to my knowledge. I am a huge, huge HUGE fan...so enjoyed hearing from her kids and family, too. Plus the respect she has within the music community shines through here - if you love Lorrie, you need to see this DVD!!",1409184000,3,348,4.132352941176471
8612193,3,B00F429ZYG,"A good DVD. I am a huge Lorrie Morgan fan and have followed her journey with great interest. I really wanted to hear more from the lady herself and was a wee bit disappointed to find there were more interviews from the people surrounding her , I respect the need for privacy but even so, I found it to be quite superficial.",1398556800,4,323,4.225806451612903
