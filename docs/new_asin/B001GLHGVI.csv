8305886,4,B001GLHGVI,"This is a very good and informative dvd that teaches about culture, and language. where this dvd fell short for me is i thought it would appeal to children between 4-10 years old but it is mainly designed to appeal to ages 4-6. Otherwise this was a good purchase.",1384905600,,263,4.387755102040816

8305888,5,B001GLHGVI,"This new line of children's videos is fantastic!  We have a pretty large video library in our home and my kids repeatedly ask to watch their new Global Wonders DVDs, sometimes even two or three times in a row.  The concept of introducing children to different, and perhaps unfamiliar, cultures is novel and well executed.  The music is catchy (I often find myself humming the theme song) but not in an annoying way.  The content is interesting and covers a wide variety of topics including food, music, cultural events, historical figures and places of interest.  Overall I would definitely recommend this series to anyone looking to enhance their child's understanding of the world they live in.",1226534400,4,696,4.9655172413793105
8305889,5,B001GLHGVI,"My four year old daughter loves this series. Like most four year old girls, she can be very picky (about everything!) and this is her hands down favorite things to watch. While being very entertaining (some of the Baby and Little Einstein people are the creative forces behind this), this is also a great educational experience. Our daughter has asked us to learn more about some of the themes touched on in this series. Overall, this is very highly recommended.",1224460800,2,462,4.7875
8305890,5,B001GLHGVI,"This is a great video for introducing Mexican culture to children. I was able to screen a copy with my five year old daughter. She was fascinated with the entire video. She loved the characters, the music, and ""real life"" footage. It moves along at a great pace able to cover Mexican music, food, ""Dia de los Muertos"", a Quinceanera, Aztec & Mayan history ....and more. My daughter also enjoyed playing along with the interactive component and learning some Spanish vocabulary along with the characters. This is a great educational video but so much fun. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",1224201600,2,575,4.877551020408164
