8430136,3,B004I698K0,"Filmed at the height of the Vietnam War and concurrently with the radical political upheaval of 1968 France, Mr. Freedom is a political farce, clearly sympathizing with national liberation and left wing movements. The title character, a stand-in for U.S. political and economic might, is a crude, cruel buffoon in the service of corporations. His rhetoric of freedom stands in cold relief to his actions, which are anything but democratic. The politics get a bit muddled with the characters of Mujick Man, Red China Man, and the FAF, but they would seem to be stand-ins for the Soviet Union, communist China, and the radical milieu of the 1968 uprisings, respectively. Mr. Freedom makes numerous left wing statements on the Cold War, and more specifically, the Vietnam War. Because of these views the film was seen as anti-American on its release but that mood is somewhat softened today.

Under the command of Dr. Freedom, crass superhero Mr. Freedom (John Abbey) goes to France to stave off the advances of the mysterious French Anti-Freedom (FAF) organization. He joins forces with the femme fatale Marie-Madeleine (Delphine Seyrig) to lead his own anti-communist Freedom organization. The Freedom mission is complicated by the machinations of communist foes -- the Stalinist Moujik Man  (Phillipe Noiret) and the ferocious Maoist Red China Man (portrayed as a giant inflatable dragon). France, refusing to see the FAF as a threat, rebuffs Freedom, leading to an escalation of Cold War tactics. In the end, betrayed, Mr. Freedom destroys himself trying to save the ""unappreciative"" nation.

Mr. Freedom features absurd characters, comical costuming, and exaggeration. The title character's uniform is an odd assemblage of discarded football gear, face paint, and hockey gloves. The United States Embassy is a department store run by skipping models in spandex, proffering right-wing mercenaries and ""Freedom Kits"" of high-tech weaponry. Freedom training sessions are Dantian visions of hell. Every scene aims for the absurd, reaching both for comedic effect and political statement.

Mr. Freedom is an interesting but obscure film that seems to run out of steam at about the halfway point. It is interesting to watch because of its garish costumes but its political message becomes somewaht quickly dated. As I've mentioned before Klein is not always to my taste but he is an innovator who deserves to have his films seen and they hold up well in today's world as they did in the late 1960's.

See this one as a rarely seen piece of film history. It's a well made if somewhat disappointing satire that takes some patience to get into. There are worse ways to spend ninety minutes of your time.",1339459200,,2696,5.132118451025057
