8100151,5,B000CPKQXY,"Although this true depiction ends tragically, it seemed to be well researched and documented and is certainly a true representation of some of the atocities which took place during World War II. Very much worth watching.",1400716800,5,220,5.138888888888889

8100153,5,B000CPKQXY,"Compelling story that has come to life after 70 years through the research of one man.  Great story, I would have my teenagers watch it.  I liked it but I can handle documentaries.",1382659200,6,180,4.424242424242424
8100154,2,B000CPKQXY,"There was much resistance against Hitler that we may never know.  While I am a huge fan and researcher of WWII, I found that this DVD should have been labeled to reflect that it was an LDS or Morman production.  If it had been correctly labeled I would not have purchased it.  The archeological facts, DNA facts and Historical facts do not support the fables of Mormanism so therefore any story by Mormans is just another unfortunate lie that comes through it's adherents.  The label should be; ""LDS Truth & Conviction"", then those who want to hear Morman doctrine would purchase it. This DVD is proof of the need for truth in advertising for the product being sold.",1382572800,4,666,4.61864406779661
