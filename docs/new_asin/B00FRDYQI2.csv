8618237,5,B00FRDYQI2,"This DVD set has it all. A lot of racing action. The podium interviews are void of sponsorship ramblings. They go back and forth between 450 Moto1, 250 Moto 1, 450 Moto 2 and 250 Moto 2. They give points per race and championship standings. Good replays. I'll keep buying these.",1400112000,,278,4.470588235294118
8618238,5,B00FRDYQI2,From beginning to end it showed the best highlights throughout the year it's about eight hours long and it was a lot more detailed than I expected it's very well done and will be buying 2014's at the end of the season.  Great to watch before the new season begins as a refresher!,1389052800,,279,4.264150943396227
