8270669,5,B0018QJ53I,Purchased this for my 4 year old granddaughter.  She loved it and was enthralled watching it.  Good values are taught.  I would recommend it and did order more of this series.,1362009600,,175,4.580645161290323
8270670,4,B0018QJ53I,"We own a number of the Pocoyo DVDs and we were looking forward to watching episodes with Super Pocoyo but instead this DVD only has one episode with Super Pocoyo and the rest were a stretch in regard to the meaning of ""super""; most of the episodes include Pocoyo helping his friends-which is a great lesson, just not what we were expecting. So they are cute, as always, Pocoyo episodes, just not Super Pocoyo episodes.",1347062400,,418,4.586666666666667
8270671,5,B0018QJ53I,"Like all other videos of Pocoyo, he and his friends find themselves in different and complicated situations and they get out of them throught laughter and helping each other.
Kids learn about patience and other things that are important when growing up, like mutual help and respect.",1258329600,,283,5.042553191489362
8270672,5,B0018QJ53I,"The kids (1 and 3 yr old) love Pocoyo. Added bonus for us, we speak French at home and there is a French sound track.",1236988800,2,117,3.72
