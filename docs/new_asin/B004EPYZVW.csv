4364232,3,B004EPYZVW,"This movie is the kind of melodrama that one doesn't see in feature films anymore. It is about a woman with dissociative personality disorder (see 1957's The Three Faces of Eve). Through hokey flashbacks the main character, Frankie's traumatic past is revealed with the help of a psychiatrist via hypnotherapy. Movies typically trigger a character's flashback to the past using some sort of object that was present in the past or is reminiscent of an object in the memory, but few movies are unimaginative enough to use light as this trigger. A flashlight triggers Frankie's memories because during her past traumas there were a car's front lights or even sunlight. We would all have some form of mental illness if light triggered vivid recollections of the past.

If you pay attention you will see this movie's plot points developing a mile away. One side character has a subplot shoehorned in that seems as if most of it was cut from the movie. What is left of his ""character development"" comes across as bizarre and alienating. Almost every scene of Frankie and Alice is cliche and yet it is still watchable.

This movie currently has a 14% on Rottentomatoes. Why did no one hear about this movie, and why do those that did disparage it? It is not because americans don't like melodrama. Many of the best picture winners in recent years are melodramas, only they add some twist to the formula to make viewers feel like their seeing something new and important. The Artist is a melodrama in black and white with no sound. Slumdog Millionaire is a melodrama with Ballywood trappings. Million Dollar Baby is a melodrama with a weepy piano and violin soundtrack and laconic philosophical musings. Frankie and Alice is a melodrama completely composed of elements all movie watchers have seen many times over.

There is one good aspect to the movie but it is not the direction. There is one scene in which Frankie (Halle Berry) is experiencing multiple personality transitions and the camera stays pretty much fixed in one position for several minutes. Despite the editing and direction, which occasionally turns this melodrama into unintentional comedy, Halle Berry's very competent performance holds this film together. She shows acting chops that may have been luminous in a better film, but in this one only come across as well done acting exercises.

Watch this movie if you are in the mood for racial melodrama, or if you are a Halle Berry fan. It does not disappoint if you just want a comfortable retread of story arcs and plot points you have already seen before.",1348099200,5,2569,4.871853546910756
4364233,5,B004EPYZVW,"First of all don't be swayed by the 1 star one of the reviewers gave this movie.  The rating has nothing to do with the quality of the acting or storyline.  It has to do with why it has not hit the theaters or commercial DVD.  I agree it is such a disservice to those involved in the movie and to the public.  I reiterate what one of the other reviewers said. It is the best piece of acting I have seen Halle Berry in.  THIS is the movie she SHOULD have won an OSCAR for!!  Her acting is raw, human, controversal and grabs and holds you from the first moment the movie starts, until the credits begin to roll.  She plays a young women with multiple personalities, with those personalities being as different from each other as the North Pole is from the South Pole; and she plays those personalities completely believable. Phylicia Rashad, plays her mother, and Chandra Wilson (Grey's Anatomy) plays the role of her sister.  Just say that the whole family has issues. This film was made a few years ago(2010), and I wonder if it is ever going to be released in ,theaters.  Halle was interviewed about it's release a couple of years ago, and she didn't know when or if it would be released. If it doesn't get released the public would have missed an opportunity to witness the actress at her FINEST! This is a body of work she should be most proud of.",1340236800,111,1350,4.346613545816733
4364234,5,B004EPYZVW,i saw this movie about 2 months ago and i was moonstruck! halle is untouched in this movie about a female with a split personality ala 'sybil'!.she was amazing at transforming from 1 person 2 the next with such ease.its as if your seeing magic! no lye people this girl can act.she swims in the role like no other and make u believe what u don't want 2 believe.i won't spoil it and tell u the story.all i will say is don't sleep on this film its her best and possibly the best film of 2011.by the way i saw it on an advanced copy 4 studio playing only! 'DON'T SLEEP'!,1311638400,46,566,4.108108108108108

4364282,3,B004EPYZVW,"Let me say that Halle Berry is an exceptional actor and she can make any movie good. I think she acted well in the movie, the movie is thought out with a plot but it just was not dynamic. Without giving anyway the movie for those of you that actually want to be surprised and hate spoiler alerts I will say the movie does come together well. That is not the problem. When we watch movies we are looking to be entertained. Either we walk away with a moral lesson or a psychological satisfaction of having our minds challenged. We need to come away with something from the movie. I get they were trying to show that something was wrong but where is the hope at in the movie. Every movie needs hope. Although the ending was a good ending it didn't leave you with hope at the end. The movie almost just seemed like a tragedy that was being told and left at being a tragedy that was told. I get there are some bad and sad things that happen to people in life. I am prepared to hear those stories but when the movie doesn't leave me with any hope and something that I can walk away from the movie with, I almost think why waste production. We have enough movies that have been done that tell this kind of story. If the producers are not going to tell this story in such a way that a movie is the only way to tell it why spend needless money. This is not a bad movie and you will not be bored but I've seen this same story done too many times. Wish the movie would have given the audience more and told the story in such as way that you could watch this movie again and again and it would not get old.",1486684800,,1594,4.063492063492063

4365273,2,B004EPYZVW,"While wonderfully acted, the writing is weak. Much time is spent focusing on the strange behavior in the present, but too little on the traumatic back story to explain her disassociations and her transitions into them. It left me wondering, is there a genotype that is prone to such a strange disorder? More time of her life as a child and young adult might have added some depth. What we mostly see are the striking different internal characters playing against each other. Also, there is too little time spent on the character's resolution. Did treatment help? What is it like with her personalities reintegrated, or did that ever happen? This is just so much empty calories sensational psychodrama that provides little insight into the human mind and what it is capable of. A final, positive personal preference note: it is always great to see Halle Berry in something other than her trademark short pixie butch cut hair style.

4365353,2,B004EPYZVW,"Here's the thing: Halle Berry can act and is compelling onscreen.
This movie, however, was terribly written (an unstructured plot, for sure) and poorly edited.
I can suspend disbelief with many films but this is not the genre in which one, as the viewer, is supposed to do so.  In addition, her character(s?) was never fully fleshed out.  The reason for having the dissociative identity disorder was really quite tame and occurred at a late age compared to childhood systematic abuse that is generally the cause of DID, formerly known as multiple-personality disorder.
It gets two stars instead of one because of Berry's charisma and screen presence.
If you are a Berry fan, watch it.  Otherwise, it is a frustrating waste of time knowing that she can do so much more with a good script.",1446940800,,787,4.814814814814815

4365809,5,B004EPYZVW,"The movie Frankie & Alice was (in my opinion), one of Halle Berry's best performances ever.  I say that because acting as one personality can't really be that difficult to do since working in Hollywood is not really about quality anymore...it's just about who you are. But, acting as multiple personalities require some research, acting ability, and time to evolve into the personalities you have to portray.  Halle Berry did just that.  Without revealing all the details (plot, climax, etc.) of the movie, I just want to say that she and the doctor lived up to the portrayal that would be expected of a real life situation.  No glitz and glimmer filled the big screen in this movie...but the depiction of the evolving of a person finding out who she really is and discovering how to deal with her truth.
By-the-way, not all movies are full of ""energy"" but some are just full of substance.  This was a movie full of substance.",1440028800,,926,4.691358024691358

For some reason I feel I have seen this before on lifetime because I remember it, the scenes of the car accident and more. Halle Berry gives a superb performance as Frankie a young woman with MDD, as does Stellan Skarsgard as her doctor. This is such a sad story of loss, but in the end she triumphs over the trauma which caused her to develop multiple personalities and to live a marginal life.

4366026,2,B004EPYZVW,"The premise was good. It hit very close to home (my family) in many ways.
That actually made the concept somewhat plausible for me (even for a true story).
The storyline was decent. The acting was pretty good. The ending was horrible.
Even though the ending attempted to resolve the movie and bring things full circle
in her life, and in the overall treatment. It felt very abrupt (two minutes spent on it,
-utterly ridiculous) and was a huge let down. It left the viewers hanging. That is what
killed the movie for me. Overall I thought it was pretty good, -maybe a 3 star film,
reflective of the IMDB rating (or close to it). But the ending was way to short and
felt rushed. It felt contrived. The doctor tried to gloss over and explain away an
apparent serious crime. He did this in the best interest of the patient perhaps,
who was in a fragile state, but it made for a poor resolution to the plot/script,
that they tried to fix at the very end without actually filming a scene where the audience
would learn the truth about what happened. I think a much better ending would have
been to film the scene where both the viewers and the patient learned the truth about
what happened to Alice (even though it is inferred or implied and we think we know)
where the patient (primary character) would address the potential criminal perpetrator
(a family member) and find the truth out about what that person did. If they had done
that scene and done it well, it could have been the best scene in the entire movie and
in fact could have made the entire movie. In this movie, they even could have ran
with that idea and done an alternate ending also. If they had done either and done it well,
it would be a 4 star movie.
At this point I'm sounding like I need to be checked into a 72 hour hold; however as always,
I hate to give the storyline away and so I beat around the bush without doing so (in a non-eloquent
and quick fashion). - I would say go ahead and watch it. It's decent, - 2.75 stars overall.",1438732800,,2000,4.321808510638298

4366029,5,B004EPYZVW,Great movie! Its awesome because it's reality that most of us don't know exist. There are many people around with these problems that should be getting more attention from their family and friends but everyone is so worried about money that they don't care. We have to learn that Love and kindness is more important than money so we can build our on wealth between each other. Money has no value without each other.,1438300800,,415,4.621621621621622

4367183,2,B004EPYZVW,"***This contains spoilers****

My problem with this movie is that it perpetuates myths about DID. Dissociative Identity Disorder, formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder, is typically a response to severe and prolonged childhood abuse. The idea of a single incident causing Frankie's personality to split is hard to swallow. While the premise is interesting, this movie seems disrespectful to people who actually have DID, and to those who struggle with mental illness in general. Mental illness is already stigmatized enough. Granted, this is a movie, but if art is an imitation of life, we should adhere to the basic facts. Even if Game of Thrones, a sword is still a sword, even if they also have direwolves.",1432857600,2,719,5.145299145299146

I really can't figure out how a movie that the general public probably has not seen be available free on amazon. Only a really bad movie would go that route, right?  Well it was really a decent movie after the opening few minutes.  A very good B movie.  If you have a few hours I would definitely give this one a shot.",1432857600,,525,4.178217821782178

4367199,5,B004EPYZVW,"Halle gave the kind of quality performance that only SHE'S capable of, in playing a young woman who in real life, suffered from Multiple Personality Disorder and didn't initially know it.  The storyline is well-written, with all the plots and mystery you'd expect a psych movie to have.  But like peeling an onion, you gradually get to see what traumas Frankie sadly suffered---ultimately the final one being the worst (no thanks to her Mother, played by Phylicia Rashad) which pushed Frankie over the edge into her full-blown MPD.

Halle was very convincing in all her characters; and her Psychiatrist Dr. Oz was such a wonderful man who dedicated himself to her case & selflessly took the time to genuinely help her so much, that I'm sure when he died in 2001, God had a special Blessing just waiting for him in Heaven!

The only disappointment I had, was that I would've liked to see a scene of Frankie confronting her Mother about what she did with her newborn baby when it went into some kind of distress immediately upon its birth.  I feel that absence left a hole in the storyline and I feel that the audience should have had the privilege in seeing Frankie's Mom take accountability for her improper actions---as Frankie had the legal & moral right to have closure if the baby died naturally, and IF her Mom did kill that baby, she needed to 'fess-up to it right then & there.

Other than that, I loved the movie and it's going into my favorites to watch again in the near future.  Hat's off to Halle & her great performance!!

4367543,5,B004EPYZVW,"Excellent flick.  Halle & Stellan are great together for one thing.  For another, the story of Frankie's journey along with her ""alters"" is handled as well as any story about a person with multiple personalities can be.  Starting with the challenges caused by the switching of personalities being not under her control, touched off by events in the moment linked to events from her past and the emotional shields she created to protect herself, Frankie finds that the protective interventions of the alters on the present mean she's responsible for behaviors that weigh on her conscience as wrong, besides having consequences of giving her a really bad reputation.  In other words, Frankie finds she has her hands full and when the Doctor (Stellan) begins to make inroads in explaining it all to her, she gets interested.  But the alters aren't going down easy: the original traumatic events were crushingly complex and, at least emotionally, massively perilous.  Frankie proves an elusive patient for the Doctor, who must also struggle for support from his cohorts, but Frankie eventually rises to the occasion in a touching scene.  Most interesting to me is the notion that, at least in this case, multiple personality disorder is essentially an extreme form of Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  Finally, Halle deserves an Oscar for the depth and believability of her acting the roles of the alters and of Frankie herself.  Fantastic!",1429228800,2,1443,5.132478632478633

This movie allows you to see the character, Frankie, as a person.  The fact that the film is a true story makes it all the more fascinating a story, and it is remarkable how Frankie ultimately finds resolution within her life.  Great story for anyone familiar with mental illness and the effects it can have on individuals without treatment and caring practitioners.

My only issue with the film, which really isn't that significant, is that it truly speeds through her recovery process.  This makes some of the timeline unbelievable, but does not detract from the overall story.",1429142400,,712,4.9411764705882355

4367685,5,B004EPYZVW,"Wow. This movie was amazing.  I would watch it over and over. It was suspenseful without showing anything gory or really scary, more like a psychological mystery thriller.  Halle Berry was amazing.  She never ages.  The soundtrack was great, too, if you love old R&B.  If you want another movie to watch on multiple personalities, which is a lot more upsetting, actually, watch the old Sybil movie with Sally Fields.  Or for more intense understanding, read the book Sybil.  That movie and book is much more disturbing.  What happened to Halle Berry's character was not so severe, but still bad enough to cause her to dissociate.  At any rate, it is not too disturbing, not too depressing, and completely engaging.  A must-see if the subject matter interests you at all.",1428278400,2,770,4.8538461538461535

4367700,5,B004EPYZVW,"This genre of movie isn't for everyone. It's a psychological case study presented in drama form so it's very ""talky""... Much of it is conversations between psychologist and patient. I majored in Psych/Sociology with graduate training and many years of work in a residential treatment center so, naturally, the subject matter of multiple personalities engendered by traumatic events interests me greatly. It's hard to pack such a story into an hour and a half but this movie succeeds pretty well. Berry and Skarsgard make it worth a watch on acting chops alone. If you enjoy Halle in this one, be SURE to see her Academy Best Actress Award performance in ""Monsters' Ball"" (one of the best low-budget films ever made).",1428192000,2,716,4.975

4367784,3,B004EPYZVW,"Halle Berry's acting is top notch, and this movie is entertaining, but there are problems with it.  Either they left out a lot of the backstory that would enable the viewer to understand it, especially the ending, in perspective, or she doesn't have MPD.  MPD results from repetitive and severe childhood trauma. There is no evidence in this movie that the Frankie character ever had any.  In the beginning she freaks out when someone who appears to be a boyfriend with whom she has a relationship touches her, yet there is no evidence in the entire movie about why she would get upset about being touched by a man, and in fact there is evidence that she doesn't have any problem with men or with sexual contact.  Much of the movie is senseless. For example, she has a baby after her boyfriend is killed in an accident, and it appears from the movie that although the baby cries once it dies in her mother's arms. Then she alleges her mother killed it but she doesn't know why. This remains totally confusing to the viewer and unresolved.  There is nothing in this movie that would give the viewer any comprehension of why her mother would do that. Her relationship with her mother is not developed. It is clear her sister is jealous of her and doesn't approve of her lifestyle, but nobody knows why.  The doctors in the hospital are made to look like idiots, and maybe they were, because they appear to have misdiagnosed her.  She also has a personality who has the name that she and her boyfriend were going to give the baby, Alice, and that too makes no sense.  She apparently also has some serious issues with a woman she knew back in her teens but why is never explored. My guess is she had some kind of mental illness or, more likely, she was having problems caused by a history of drug use that is not revealed, not MPD, and was misdiagnosed.  Great acting, but a very confusing and poorly developed story line.",1421971200,5,1918,4.504322766570605

4367793,3,B004EPYZVW,"I loved the movie ""Sybil"", even though the book ""Sybil Exposed"" proved that all of it was fake. (""Sybil Exposed"" was a great book.)  I also loved the multiple personality storyline of Vicky and Nikki on ""One Life to Live"".

I enjoyed this movie. Halle Berry's acting was very good, she really made it look like she had three very different personalities (Frankie, Alice, Genius).

I wanted to see more backstory, of why her personality split. From what I have heard about multiple personalities, the person splits at a very young age (usually younger than 5) and it is caused by constant trauma, usually sexual abuse.

SPOILER ALERT... Frankie's trauma was that, as a teenager, she gave birth (shortly after the baby's father died in a car accident), and her mother delivered the baby in the house, and then the mother immediately ran out of the house with the baby and killed it. Of course, this is horrible, but I don't think that it could cause multiple personality disorder because it was not a continuing trauma that happened at a very early age. I see that this is a true story, and I do believe that the woman had some kind of a serious mental illness, but I do not think that she had multiple personality disorder. This story takes place in 1973, so I wonder what the diagnosis might have been today. The mother ran out of the house, into the rain at night, with the newborn in her arms and nothing else, but we don't see what happened next. Frankie says that her mother killed the baby, but she does not say how or give any details at all. Where was the sister when this happened? No one saw anything? The murder was never discovered? Did Frankie just block out the whole experience?",1419984000,4,1692,4.537704918032787

I hope to hear about this at Oscar time.",1412121600,,163,4.09375
4367909,5,B004EPYZVW,Loved this movie! Halle Berry is the best. Probably her best role ever! A must see for anyone who loves movies based on true events.,1412121600,,132,4.32

Well acted and directed with solid performances all around. A fascinating story. So glad I picked it up!",1412121600,,282,4.1454545454545455

4367916,5,B004EPYZVW,"I admit it!  I love Halle Berry!  While I haven't seen ALL of her films, I have never seen her in one where her performance wasn't remarkable or even extraordinary (Monster's Ball, to name one).  Halle dazzles, again, in Frankie & Alice.  Her ability to believably handle a multiple personality role is mesmerizing.  In truth, I would have given this 4 1/2 stars, not 5...as I reserve 5 for those rare perfect films.  That being said, I find little fault with this film, unlike some if its harsher critics.  I was left going 'wow...she did it again'.  Halle never fails me, never disappoints me.  She is an extraordinary beauty and an extraordinary talent.  Technically, the direction, the screenplay, worked for me as well.  Intellectually, it's a look at mental illness, its potential root causes, and, most importantly, the masks it wears, often by people we may experience in our everyday lives.",1411862400,,899,4.887417218543046

4367920,5,B004EPYZVW,Excellent movie.,1411862400,,16,7.5
4367921,4,B004EPYZVW,"Years ago Mary and I watched Sybil that was also based on true events and were both spellbound, agreeing wholeheartedly with the multiple awards it received. Frankie and Alice, also based on a true person's saga, while riveting with an excellent performance by Halle Berry, did not live up to our remembrance of Sybil. However, we can't complain since the movie cost us only $5.99 to view via our Roku. Much less expensive than going to the movies.",1411862400,,448,4.756410256410256
4367922,2,B004EPYZVW,The movie could have been a lot better. The audience should have seen much more of the personalities of the main character.,1411603200,,123,4.636363636363637
4367923,4,B004EPYZVW,"I am a huge fan of both Halle Berry and Stellan Skarsgard.  Add a very intelligent, knowledgable screenplay based on a true story you are in for a real treat.  If you have any knowledge at all of multiple personality disorder you will be stunned at how well it is depicted in this film.  A must see for those interested in psychology and just plain good film making. Why it didn't receive wider exposure is a real puzzle.",1411516800,6,421,4.371794871794871

4367934,3,B004EPYZVW,I liked the movie. I just did not like the ending. It was too quick and they did not explain if frankie mother killed the baby of gave it up for adoption.,1411257600,,154,3.84375
4367935,5,B004EPYZVW,"I love this move , I love anything  Halle beery is in.",1411257600,,54,3.5
4367936,4,B004EPYZVW,This film was very graphic in parts - that's why I only gave it 4 stars - but it tells an important and intense story. It is about a woman who has undergone trauma and her mind invents 2 other personalities. The reason for the trauma is not clear until the end of the movie and it was a lot better than I thought. Other reviewers are right: Halle Berry should have won an award for THIS movie as her acting is far more complicated and intense than it was in Monster's Ball. She is in almost every scene and does a phenomenal job.,1411171200,,529,4.096153846153846
4367937,5,B004EPYZVW,Great film! I work in mental health and screened this at my job to people who also live with mental health issues. They loved it. I think this was Halle Berry's best acting. She deserved an Oscar for this performance.,1411171200,,217,4.45
4367938,2,B004EPYZVW,Meh! Tough one for Halle Barry to pull off.  I like the period feel though (1970's)Although the psychiatrist -- I forget his name -- was very good.  It seems like he plays a psychologist in every movie.,1411171200,2,202,4.4324324324324325
4367939,3,B004EPYZVW,"Too long, great performance by Haley Berry but just not my cup of tea, a bit stilted at times. It all comes down to writing and this challenge was a bridge too far.",1411171200,,164,4.0

4367943,5,B004EPYZVW,The acting in the movie was fabulous. I think it did a good job of depicting mental illness and showing that with time at least some mental illness can be controlled.,1410998400,,166,4.387096774193548
4367944,5,B004EPYZVW,All I can say is Wow! Halley Berry did it again. I just wonder why this was released this year in the US but 4 years ago in Canada. This is a truly amazing look into human behavior. Every time I watched I realized something I missed before.,1410998400,,240,4.020833333333333

4367948,4,B004EPYZVW,"I am standing as I write this review! An awesome performance by Halle Berry! So disturbingly good, but sad to see anyone having to go though this type of illness. And being based off true events as it was made the presentation even more worthy to be seen as it brings more attention to this type of illness. Than to write this off as being and please forgive the word ""crazy"" I love it but was cut to the quick by it as it was being unfolded on the screen. Great job! Halle Berry, an to the cast as a whole. Straight to the Side Bar Review: Halle Berry deliveries a staller performance in this bringing each personality alive.",1410825600,,626,4.26890756302521
