1781614,5,B00006JJLL,Mermaid in a manhole is totally gruesome and in your face. I found the story higly revolting and hte effects are just gross. He never dies is an awesome gore comedy. Not as funny as Bad Taste but it has it's moments. Menu design rules. Hail Guinea Pig!,1031702400,3,252,4.270833333333333
1781615,5,B00006JJLL,"The 2nd installment from the guys at Unearthed Films is a drastic difference from the first DVD(Devils/Android). This is freaking awesome all the gore was not left out of this one, Meramid in a manhole was totally digusting and He never dies had me wincing at a few parts then laughing...at others. The menu design and added trailers to this DVD are top notch. Can't wait for Flower of Flesh and Blood to come out (after i saw the trailer). Overall this DVD is bad to the bone.",1031529600,6,477,4.431818181818182
7970486,5,B00006JJLL,"Mermaid in a Manhole is undoubtedly the best film of the Japanese Guinea Pig series of films. A painter whose wife has recently died literally finds a mermaid in a manhole, and he had previously met this mermaid before during his childhood. He paints pictures of her as her body is ravished with festering boils, and eventually he dismembers her. While the other films in the series are depthless and merely a showcase of special effects, this film actually feels plot and character driven with the gore that comes with the territory. The effects are incredible, and we truly see the protagonist descend into madness. If you're going to watch any film of this series, this should be the one.",1507248000,,691,4.766666666666667
7970487,5,B00006JJLL,"Mermaid in a manhole is the grossest movie I've ever seen.
The FX are ok but it's the concept that just get under my skin. This is exactly what I want from horror.

He never Dies is hilarious and wonderful.
Still gory as hell, but a completely different tone from the other film",1463616000,,278,4.245283018867925

7970489,4,B00006JJLL,"Guinea Pig IV: Mermaid in a Sewer (Hideshi Hino, 1988)
[originally posted 7Jul2000]

Mermaid in a Sewer, one of the four Guinea Pig films directed by Hino, is the only one that rivals The Flower of Flesh and Blood in notoriety and popularity. Unlike its more graphic and brutal cousin, Mermaid in a Sewer (often translated as Mermaid in a Manhole, Mermaid in the Bathtub, or any other number of similar titles) actually has a plot to it. An artist, obviously modeled on Hino himself (Hino's style is unmistakable), draws his inspiration from things he sees and finds in his local sewer system. One day, what he finds among the muck and stench is... a mermaid . Yes, a mermaid. A very attractive one at that (and one is forced to wonder what, exactly, would motivate an actress to play a part like this...). We find out, after the two have conversed a bit and he's done a preliminary sketch, that she is wounded. He takes her home (how he gets her there without anyone noticing is beyond me) and installs her in his bathtub in order to take care of her.

You can see where this is going, I'm sure. Wound + sewer = bad, bad things.

I'd comment on the acting, dialogue, etc. if I actually understood Japanese. Sometimes watching films in foreign languages with no subtitles is good for the soul, I guess (though anyone who happens to have a script from either 2 or 3 in English who'd be willing to send a copy my way would be remembered in my will, and not with a debt). The couple who lives downstairs form the artist pop up every now and then to give what would seem a comic turn to the film, which only adds to the disgust and horror. If you get nightmares easily, this is not a film you ever want to see. As Joaquin Phoenix said in what was one of only a handful of lines in 8mm that's actually worth remembering, ""there are some things you can't un-see."" I could never pop this tape into the cassette player again, and certain images would remain as fresh in my mind as they are right now. It's that bad. *** ",1388707200,,2012,4.343085106382978
7970490,4,B00006JJLL,"Guinea Pig films aren't horror movies. They are exploitation films. People who buy Guinea Pig films shouldn't expect scariness. In fact, they shouldn't expect anything more than blood, gore, and various guts.
The oddball in the Guinea Pig series is Mermaid in a Manhole. Instead of gratuitous blood and gore (like the double feature ""He Never Dies""), this movie focuses more on story and themes. And instead of blood and gore, you get puss and worms. A truly nice film.
I showed this film (MiaM) recently to a small crowd of about 10-20 people and it was a hit. Lots of people enjoyed it and it turned into a ""midnight movie"" type deal where people just genuinely had a fun time and didn't take anything too seriously. It was a blast. Would I recommend just buying it to watch on your own? Not exactly, but it is a nice collectors piece.

He Never Dies, however, isn't as good. The ending is somewhat humorous do to the gruesome irony of the story, but if you want gore and blood you should check out some other Guinea Pig film.

Again, these aren't horror films. These are the cheesy exploitation movies you laugh at with other exploitation loving people.",1347408000,,1156,4.606796116504855
7970491,2,B00006JJLL,"As these movies have a bit of a cult following I might make some people angry by this review, and I am sorry about that but I can not do anything but say what I really mean about them. This DVD set gives you two movies, Mermaid in a Manhole and He Never Dies, of the two Mermaid in a Manhole is the strongest. I will however point out that none of these movies are over an hour long they are short films not feature length. Mermaid in a Manhole is a few minutes short of an hour if I do not remember it wrong, and He Never Dies is about 45 minutes long.

Mermaid in a Manhole is about a struggling artist who is trying to deal with the loss of his wife by going down in the sewers and making surrealistic paintings of garbage. One day when he is down looking for new motives for his paintings he find a mermaid, the painter remembers that he had met this mermaid when he was a boy and the sewers where a river. It turns out the mermaid is very ill, having been poisoned from living in the sewer to long, so our hero takes her home and starts to make a portrait of her.

He Never Dies is about a young man who is socially awkward, hates his job, get picked on by his boss and generally thinks his life suck. One day the protagonist decides to take his own life only to discover that he is immortal, he literary can not die no matter how much damage he takes. This movie have no story what so ever, it is just the protagonist cutting himself to pieces trying to find a way to kill himself and after a while trying to scare his friends by continuing the self mutilation in front of them.

Now here is the problem with these movies, there are no story it is just gore. For both movies  could literary sum up the story in one sentence and all the rest is just blood and body parts flying. Now if you are a gore hound then I am sure you might enjoy this DVD set, after all Guinna Pig is the movie series that where called in to prove that their actors where still alive as the gore at times look so realistic, and especially for the time it was made that many though they where real snuff movies. Now however if you like me value a horror movie more for it's story than for gore then this movie set will not satisfy you. The gore effects are brilliant for it's time, but that is all these two movies are, gore, gore, gore. I found the movies boring after a while, they did not shock me and I found myself just waiting for some semblance of a plot to start, but it never did.

Now, if you are a gore fan or a horror movie collector I do recommend this set because it is obscure and make a nice addition to a collection. I think also that if you are interested in special effects you might enjoy this as the creators of these movies have put allot of thought into making it realistic. If you however is looking for a scary story then this movie is not for you. The acting is bad, the story is non existence and in fact everything but the gore is awful, I do not care if this have a cult following, these movies are just not good.",1320019200,2,3021,4.045150501672241
7970492,5,B00006JJLL,"I bought this movie at chapters (well, my friend's dad did) and so I watched it, and It was sooooo blood splatterin' fun. I couldn't have seen a gorier movie.

I haaven't seen MIAM so I'll tell you what I think about HND.

He Never Dies is about a man who is invincible, all the gouges and cuts on his body have not gone away. He lives in a world of hate and anyone who has tried to kill him has never achieved. Then, one day, people tell him ""You should Die NOW!!!!"" and so he tries to kill himself!

Everyone hates this movie cuz it is really screwed up (In a way). Screw 'em. Buy this blood spattering masterpiece today!",1128470400,2,623,4.132231404958677
7970493,1,B00006JJLL,"Mermaid in a Manhole isn't even an hour long.  Both movies add up to be about 113 minutes.  The gore is substandard and the plot is as good as what I see when I wipe my behind.  Let me sum this movie up: artist finds mermaid in sewer (that's the first five minutes), puts mermaid in tub, mermaid pops multi-colored pustules, artist paints her as she flops around, and artist cuts her up into pieces (very lame effects), and he gets thrown in prison.  The end and I'm out of toilet paper.
He Never Dies keeps the lackadazical torch burning.  I'll sum this one up for you: sad man cuts wrists, stares at the wound, keeps cutting himself up, brother comes to see and faints, then the man who never dies is a talking head on a table.  That's it.  Is it worth thirty bucks?  Hell no, my friend.  Listen to a long time horror fan, don't buy this please.
They call these the ""Guinea Pig Films"" because only guinea pigs could enjoy something as irrelevant and drab.  Please avoid at all costs.  Don't let the curiousity bug attack you like it did me.  Just don't buy it, swallow nails instead because it'll make you feel much better than watching this piece of ....",1047513600,19,1157,4.355140186915888
7970494,1,B00006JJLL,"It's amateur VHS camcorder made and the effects are sometimes not bad sometimes look like a pizza. Bad actors. Looks like a film student job but I've seen worst with violent [...] (aka zombie doom aka infantry of doom).
Not deserve the name of movie but a good HOME VIDEO. Go on with Braindead, texas chainsaw or nekromantik and if you looking for japeneese, ringu or kairo are much better and they're a 16mm film instead a video.",1044316800,3,430,4.5256410256410255
7970495,2,B00006JJLL,"Frankly because of the other reviews of this DVD I'm struggling to not use sarcasm. But this is the best i can give it to ou straight. Dull. I know this wasn't ever going to be about plot, but Mermaids incredibly obvious surprise ending was insulting. The gore (a lot of worms in blood and some pus oozing tumours) was boring and not particularly nasty. Get Braindead or Dead Alive however you know it best and leave this alone. A Gojira size let down.",1043193600,3,452,4.392857142857143
