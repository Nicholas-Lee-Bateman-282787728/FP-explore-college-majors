5457128,5,B00AMU8K8C,"Living in UK we only got to see the odd episodes on TV, both my wife and I loved them, so when the complete collection became available on DVD we just simply had to have them.  Although they're a sort of amateur detective, they also have a mild religious flavour (not over-powering with religion or forcing it on anyone), although not necessarily similar to 'Touched by an Angel or Highway To Heaven' they are equally entertaining.
One bit of advice I can offer people...If you're considering buying these or any other DVD's, DO get them from Amazon, there are some companies out there like Teague DVD's, who take your money and close down business WITHOUT you getting any goods, and no chance of getting your money back.
Have fun...Enjoy them, we certainly will.

Late addition...
Have now watched all the dvd's, and yes it's still a brilliant series, but be advised...It's NOT the complete series.
Have seen 3 episodes on UK TV this week that are NOT included in the boxsets, thus they aren't complete. but still very enjoyable.",1372032000,76,1030,4.748603351955308
5457129,5,B00AMU8K8C,"I ordered the whole set (3 seasons) and am in the midst of watching Season 2. I loved Season 1. The little plastic holder for the first DVD in Season 2 case is broken, but I got it fixed back, and it's not a big enough deal to send it back. It was a great series, and I'm glad it's now on DVD.",1363737600,7,293,3.6666666666666665

5457158,5,B00AMU8K8C,"What is not to love about this series?  It has mystery, comedy and some life;'s lessons to be taught along the way. It also teaches respect for the law and for ""religion"" which seems to be pretty lacking in this world today.  The actors are all superb in their respective parts. It is well plotted and even though the series was on a few years ago (where DOES the time go) the stories are timeless.  Having lived in the Chicago area this is also a trip down nostalgia lane.",1518652800,3,473,4.292134831460674

5457379,3,B00AMU8K8C,"This series reminded me of the Snoop Sisters made during the 1970s. In the pilot episode Father Dowling had a nephew detective, just like the Snoop Sisters did.  Whilst a lapsed Catholic myself the show does seem to be able to sensitively combine the notions of faith and propensity to solve murders in the guise of Father Dowling and his sidekick gungho nun.  So far I have only watched the first season, but eventually will get through the rest.",1474502400,,447,4.6455696202531644

5457425,4,B00AMU8K8C,"A two hour movie pilot began this Mystery series which was aired by NBC for the first season.  It was subsequently cancelled after eight episodes.  ABC picked up the show for two more seasons.  In the third and final season ABC apparently began to feel the heat from the more religious side of the audience when the scripts began to bring in iconic characters like Lucifer and angels and began to stray from the original mystery concept.  Thus the furor and drop in audience combined to force cancellation of the series.

The premise:  Father Frank Dowling is an amateur detective who is a working priest in Chicago.  He is assisted by Sister Stephanie (Steve) who seems to spend more time helping the good father and hanging around the rectory than she does at the convent.  The good sister has a somewhat checkered past, being streetwise and much to Father Dowling's dubious concern, takes on roles outside the church in helping solve crimes.

Together they stumble across crimes, criminals and people who are in need of help and in turn investigate the situations often helping the police solve crimes and capture the criminals.  A light, fun type of tongue in cheek look at murder and mayhem.  Good family series with the comeuppance endings for the bad guys, it may help youngsters understand the consequences of bad behavior.",1452211200,32,1331,4.845132743362832

5457499,5,B00AMU8K8C,"As someone who thoroughly enjoys watching older tv shows, this series is terrific.  There was the occasional episode that I felt was boring or I would fast forward through, but overall I really liked this show.  I love Tom Bosley as an actor and he is very easy to get attached to in this show.  I enjoyed him in this role much better than his role in Murder, She Wrote.  Although terrific in both roles, I think his character in this show was much easier to like!

I did not have any problems with these DVDs unlike most of the other older shows available to buy now.  If you don't have any of the seasons then you should hold out for all three at once and make sure it is a good price.  The prices fluctuate here on Amazon but I think the seasons by themselves run around $15 to $18 per season normally.  So if you can get all of these for $25 to $35 then you can save some money!

As with most of the older tv shows, there didn't seem to be a final episode because they probably didn't know they were getting cancelled.  Oh, I should also mention that you should be watching this for pure entertainment instead of information on any religion.  Although there is obviously going to be religious talk in these shows, I didn't really feel like it was trying to push the Catholic religion onto anyone.  That is purely based on personal perception, though.  I was only watching the show with the intentions of entertainment!",1414454400,23,1422,4.361216730038023

5457512,5,B00AMU8K8C,"After another year of personal difficulty and family tragedies, it is such a simple relief to sit down and watch these ""cozy-type"" mysteries at the end of a care-worn week..  Simple, yes indeed; mindless, at times quite so; familiar and comforting, absolutely.

True, the visuals are not always as crisp as we have grown used to, but when played on a Blue Ray player, the discs seem to clean-up a bit, and a slightly soft focus never seems to detract from the storyline. Some of those plot lines occasionally might seem overwrought and perhaps a little hackneyed to contemporary jaded eyes after years of far wilder TV series.......but, truly,  these episodes bring me back to a happier, gentler time when my family was happy and healthy and together.

I am also enjoying seeing some well-known TV personalities in their younger years., although it can make a person feel her age!

This was available at a special price on Amazon, and I was just in the mood for some nostalgia, so I bought the complete series.  So glad I did!  I am also sharing these with some elderly friends at a local senior center who are having yet even more fun with them!

So....the discs work well (especially on a Blu-Ray DVD), the sound is just fine, the color is good, the focus is a little fuzzy at times, and the storylines are still charming!  Thanks, Amazon!",1409788800,42,1341,4.648305084745763

One of my dvds were off the spindle so it has scratches on it.  If I had known that this wasn't an actual ""Box Set"" I probably wouldn't have bought it.  The three separate dvds they picture aren't even the ones you receive so that's deceptive too.  I'm not as disappointed as I am annoyed.

I really like that a priest goes about solving crimes that the police arrest the wrong person for the crime and he finds the clues to solve the mystery.  He also has help from one of his sisters at the church who is streetwise and knowledgeable about many things.  I especially like the episode ""The Consulting Detective Mystery"" where Sherlock Holmes has to give him the confidence to go on solving crime when the wrong person gets arrested for a crime committed by someone else.

5457537,1,B00AMU8K8C,"I don't see how anyone who has read Ralph McInerny's Father Dowling books could stand this awful series.  The novel's Father Dowling is not the kind of man who needs a wisecracking young nun as a sidekick to advise a somewhat bumbling and other-worldly priest on the way things really work.  He has in fact retired to parish ministry because he is spiritually exhausted by his involvement with the marital problems of modern Catholics, the world all too much with him.  Unlike his TV version, he is wise, deep, and very much in control.  Sometimes one can get over a case of butchery by clueless producers and actors and take a production on its own merits.  I couldn't on this one.  It's either these or the cutsie TV series, but not both.  I'd advise the books.

If you want to find out what kind of nun McInerny has doing detective work, read the Sister Mary Teresa books by Monica Quill, a Mcinerny pseudonym.",1395360000,7,913,4.558282208588957

5457546,5,B00AMU8K8C,When this TV series had first aired from 1989 until 1991 I had really enjoyed it. When it went off I was bummed out because it wasn't able to continue further than it did. It was in the spirit of Murder She Wrote. BothTom Bosley (of blessed memory) and Tracy Nelson along with Mary Wickes (of blessed memory) and James Stephens had all done a wonderful job in portraying their characters on the show. It wasn't until 22 years after it was on TV that it became available on DVD. I'm truly enjoying it. I didn't even know that it was on Amazon.com until I happened to see it on there. The viewing and picture quality had far exceeded my expectations on it.

Finally, Father Dowling is released to DVD.  Definitely a must-have for the fan of light-hearted murder-mysteries. No gory death scenes, mostly fun, and always entertaining storylines in each episode.

The video quality on the discs are fine for the age of the original show. No complaints here. They don't look like they're re-mastered, but even playing on my HD television, the quality and clarity was quite good, especially considering that they're recorded in standard definition.

This is a good purchase (or gift) for anyone who enjoys similar shows like: Matlock, Monk, Poirot, Columbo, Psych, and Murder She Wrote (Cabot Cove episodes), etc.",1383955200,40,682,5.40566037735849
