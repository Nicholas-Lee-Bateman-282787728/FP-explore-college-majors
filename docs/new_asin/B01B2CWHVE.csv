8749102,5,B01B2CWHVE,"As a Gran of a 2-year old, I had to spend considerable time searching for and viewing toddler entertainment, looking for that blend of quality that makes it worth watching, This was an immediate hit with me AND my granddaughter, who is now age 3 and still considers it a favorite. There are several short, wholesome, and entertaining stories that are age appropriate for toddlers (as young as 2s and 3s), and depict positive life lessons, while cleverly folding in fairy tale characters outside the Goldilocks & the Three Bears yarn. Further, the production values (audio and video) are excellent. I couldn't ask for more.",1533772800,,622,4.933333333333334
