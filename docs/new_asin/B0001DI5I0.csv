8010596,3,B0001DI5I0,"Although nominally identified as part of the Battlefield series with the same opening graphics and similar format, this program belongs to the second generation which followed the two initial series (France, Britain, Midway, Stalingrad, Normandy, and Berlin for Series 1  North Africa, Russia, Italy, Atlantic, Leyte Gulf, and Rhine for Series 2) and is significantly inferior to them. Not only are the programs in this second generation shorter (100 minutes as compared to 120 minutes), they are much less focused, far more repetitive, and overall considerably less informative.  In addition, graphic illustrations (such as for weapons) and maps are of lower quality and the action footage is often poorly related to the narrative. More specifically, this program completely ignores the technical aspects of the bombing campaigns.  There is no mention of the radar evolution and countermeasures (Windows) or of the British (Oboe, Gee, H2S) and German (Knickbein) target location devices.  There is also no mention of the American Norden bomb sight.  Finally, a somewhat strange and (probably) unintended consequence of this much inferior quality is to make Tim Pigott-Smith who narrates all Battlefield programs suddenly sound much less intelligent and well-informed than he did during the initial two series.",1362355200,,1310,5.562814070351759
