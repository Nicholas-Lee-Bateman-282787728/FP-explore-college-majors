8259766,5,B0015S2P0E,"I first saw this film on the Sundance Channel. If you haven't seen it, It is worth the view.  Storyline: Simon is a street retailer, his shop a corner on the lower east side in New York, his stock bootleg cassette tapes,the ambiance a boom box. He scrounges food from restaurants, exists on vodka and beans, sleeps on the floor, and cares for an unloved cat. Marty, who may be an old girlfriend, visits.
