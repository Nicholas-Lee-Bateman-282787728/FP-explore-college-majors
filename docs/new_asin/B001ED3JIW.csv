8297835,4,B001ED3JIW,"This edited for TV version of Paradise Express is apparently the only version available for streaming. The opening scene, set in a diner, is not in this version of the movie.  There is a DVD which may be unedited but it has a claimed running time of 90 minutes which is longer than the movie should be.

This is a movie with a very simple and direct plot.  Otherwise it is a pretty good 1937 railroading/modern western movie with clear cut good guys and bad guys.  Grant Withers and Dorothy Appleby are fine in the lead roles.  I didn't know much about Appleby so looked her up online.  I noticed that this movie is not shown on most of her limited filmographies.  Curious, I checked Grant Withers and Harrry Davenport and found that it isn't listed on theirs either.  The supporting cast is full of recognizable faces including Harry Davenport as the shortline railroad founder, Arthur Hoyt as his employee, Arthur Loft as a lawman and Donald Kirke as a villain.  I recognized the locomotive engineer but don't know his name.  The only real jarring note in the plot for me was near the end when one of the villains ran to hide in the refrigerator car. There was no good reason for him to go into that car.  But it all works out in the end.  The good guys win.  The bad guys lose.",1483920000,2,1280,4.395744680851064
8297836,5,B001ED3JIW,Great early little gem from Republic Studios. Enjoyed it more than I imagined. Stock footage from this film was used extensively on the serial Zorro Rides Again,1473465600,,160,4.962962962962963
8297837,5,B001ED3JIW,"Paradise Express is one of the best films I've ever seen. It's an adventure filled ride, with a lot of fun along the way.",1409961600,,121,4.083333333333333
8297838,1,B001ED3JIW,"This is not Grant Withers' best work.  He was a very good actor, but this story (and dialog) will not please his fans. (It didn't please this one!)  His best movie, in my opinion, is ""Other Men's Women,"" with Mary Astor, James Cagney and Joan Blondell, all young and new to films.",1274486400,4,280,4.365384615384615
