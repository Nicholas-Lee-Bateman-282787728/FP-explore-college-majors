8162525,3,B000LP5CXO,"This movie is about a boutique owner named Holly who is trying desperately the boutique she has owned for ten years open. She has one weekend to make a huge amount of money and puts on a huge mother's day sale as an attempt to do this.

You can tell right away this movie is low budget, but that adds to its charm. It is filmed in away that it seems like we are there with the characters. Most the the actors and actresses and the setting seems like just another boutique in LA, one that I have gone into a thousand times, and actors and actresses look like the normal people I see around this town. None of them are well known, which adds more of a realness to the production. The story  is good, a little choppy, leaving a little to be desired,  but good.

The thing that kind of irked me about this movie was the camera work, the camera is very shakey and tends to spin around, making me feel seasick. This was only a couple times in the movie, but I could have done with out it.",1201478400,3,982,4.098958333333333
8162526,4,B000LP5CXO,"Jaglom and his oft-times writing partner and starlet, Victoria Foyt, have crafted a thoughtful look at the appeal of clothes shopping for women and the emotional holes they're often trying to fill with the right dress and the right pair of shoes.

Co-writer Foyt stars as Holly G., dressmaker and owner of a Southern California clothing boutique. Amidst occasional breaks for the many actresses and extras to share poignantly and humorously their relationship with shopping, Holly herself winds up in a horrible Mother's Day weekend that no amount of customer purchases seem to fix. Her irresponsible boyfriend (Davison) has squandered her past few months' rent, and now Foyt and her daughter could be out of a shop and out of a home. Holly even tries the Mafia to get her rent money together by Monday, when her landlady's set to boot her.

It's not true to life, but it's true to a good Hollywood comedy.

As a male, I completely missed that this low-budget, charming little comedy's biggest draw could be the grandmother-mother-daughter story, which grows from a small part of the plot to a big one. I found myself wrapped up in listening to women talk about how shopping for clothes makes them feel. I think maybe I understood a little bit of what the ladies are getting out of just the right look for just the right day.

Morrow shows up as a good-hearted 3-o'clock-shadow-sporting love interest for Holly G. My wife was reminded how cute he was.",1169251200,3,1451,4.792
