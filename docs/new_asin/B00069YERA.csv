8040768,1,B00069YERA,"I wad so excited to get this movie after reading the classic
So disappointing.  To say the least.
Details didn't match book or some storyline
The female love interest looks nothing like the character described in book.
This girl was homey looking. Not attractive.
Spare yourself the disappointment.  Keep the beautiful story in the book in your mind",1482624000,,349,5.0
8040769,4,B00069YERA,"This is the classic love story of older guy falls in love with a young babe, who of course falls in love with him.  The story is interesting enough and sufficiently plausible to make it enjoyable to watch, particularly since Adriana Fonseca is not bashfull at all about showing off her beautiful body.  Any movie showing that much of Adriana gets three stars right off the bat from me.  The only part of the movie I did not like is the ending.  She dies suddenly for no apparent reason except to make the title of the movie make sense.",1316822400,,535,4.373737373737374

8040771,4,B00069YERA,"I like this picture. This is not the best mexican picture, is a barely a good one, but I enjoy it. Ariana Fonseca have a very beautiful face and can kill you with her beautiful eyes. The history of Mario Benedetti is dramatic. And the actors and the history in general terms are not very good directed. But the picture never boring me.",1245196800,,335,4.333333333333333
8040772,4,B00069YERA,"Santome (Gonzalez Vega) is a widower on the verge of retirement from his rather dull job at a customs office. He has two sons who keep snapping at each other and one melancholy daughter (Blanca) who is valiantly tries to bind the family together, but suffers from self-inflicted depression.
Santome is rather dispirited and this affects all his family members as well. But, change is around the corner. Laura (Adriana Fonseca) joins as a junior accountant in his office and wins Santome over with her dedication towards work, intelligence and innocent beauty. Slowly, but surely, Santome starts falling in love with Laura. He gets back a spring in his walk, some purpose in life and contemplates world travel with Laura. His feelings are reciprocated respectfully by Laura and they move in together.
Santome doesn't hide his relationship with Laura and lands up acknowledging his relationship with Laura to his understanding daughter and rebellious son. Suddenly, life for Santome assumes rightful shape again and he starts contemplating marriage, even though Laura never demands it. Laura is proud of the fact that Santome was brave enough to fall in love with a much younger woman and respectfully acknowledge it in front of his family.
But, things take a sudden U-turn and Laura passes away. Santome plunges into cavernous darkness and admits to his daughter that the short-lived good & heavenly time was only a truce with god and with his destiny. However, Laura's short relationship does change Santome and makes him a better person. He gets closer to his daughter and forgives (and brings home) his gay son.

This is a (yet another) good movie from Mexico. The story is very simple, but very close to life. No special-effects, no fancy costumes and no haunting music. The movie rides on solid acting and a warm story line.",1202515200,,1828,4.99344262295082
8040773,5,B00069YERA,"I think this is a wonderfully adapted movie from the book ""La Tregua"" (The truce) by Mario Benedetti, filmed in Veracruz, a mexican port. Unlike other movie adaptations,I would recommend reading the book first, so you can have a better appreciation of how the story is told in the film. Still, it's a very romantic story with a tragic end, and the music just puts you in the mood.",1192233600,,380,4.521739130434782
8040774,3,B00069YERA,"Apparently Uruguayan writer Mario Benedetti produced a fine novel by the name of LA TREGUA and the story was so popular that Alfonso Rosas Priego adapted it, rather weakly, into this Mexican film, TREGUA (""The Truce"").  Despite many exasperatingly poor aspects (not the least of which is the overpowering ever-present tawdry musical score by Amparo Rubin, a soupy mix of piano, voices and innumerable electronic keyboards) there are some redeeming factors that make watching this little film worthwhile.

The story? Martin Santome (Gonzalo Vega) is a widower turning 60, approaching retirement with some dread as his home life is fraught with discontent: he is bored, has no interest in socializing, and lives with his three children - plain-Jane Blanca (Maite Embil), haughty and obnoxious Esteban (Arath de la Torre, and closeted gay Jaime (Rodrigo Vidal).  Just when his life is at its lowest point Martin encounters Laura (Adriana Fonseca), a beautiful 24-year-old woman with secrets of her own, who has just started to work in his office.  Despite all the social attitudes against it, Martin softens and falls in love with the incandescent Laura, making a truce with his feeling that love has abandoned him in favor of old age.  The reaction of his family is mixed but eventually each of his children make their own transformations and Martin and Laura plan to marry.  A tragedy ensues and the promises of Martin's truce are altered and it is the way this change affects Martin's life and family that draws this story to a close.

The work of Gonzalo Vega and Adriana Fonseca and Maite Embil make this disjointed, raggle taggle jumble of a movie worth watching.  They make us believe in the unbelievable.  The director tells his tale through fragmentary scenes poorly held together by bad editing, and with excessively drawn out lovemaking scenes between Martin and Laura that move this story into the 'novella' category of TV soap opera.  The movie is in Spanish with poorly translated English subtitles. The underlying story about May-December romances is worth telling and the actors try to make it work with dignity.  The trappings get in their way.  Grady Harp, January 2005",1106870400,,2184,5.052924791086351
