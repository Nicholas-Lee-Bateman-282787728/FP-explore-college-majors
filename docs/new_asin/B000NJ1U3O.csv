8325478,5,B000NJ1U3O,These are very interesting films form the COld War era dealing with Civil Defense.  They are great examples of how the governement was trying to deal with the concerns  with the Cold War and what the (official) thinking was at the time.  They are also great period pieces showing some of the ideas and attitudes of the day.  These are very interesting historical films.,1370390400,,369,4.71875
