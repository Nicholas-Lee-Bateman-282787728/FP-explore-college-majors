8216153,5,B000V12PFG,"""Pole to Pole"" takes viewers on a trip around the world - not East to West or vice-versa (the usual), but from the North to the South Poles.  The dominant factor throughout is the sun and its varying effects.

We begin with a polar bear mother and cubs emerging from their den as Winter fades, then watch part of a caribou migration (up to 2,000 miles) in northern Canada.  Trees begin growing 500 miles South of the North Pole - the taiga area contains one-third of the world's trees.  Viewers also see rare Amur leopards in Eastern Russia.

Down at the Equator we learn that the rain-forest has no season, covers only 3% of the earth, but contains half its plant and animal life.  Less than 2% of the sunlight reaches the floor.  Viewers also see scenes of birds of paradise and their mating dances.

Then its onto the Atlantic Ocean off South Africa.  Fur seals find the feeding great; unfortunately for them, so do great white sharks.  Moving on, its the birth of a hurricane, sand storms, and the monsoon.

Deserts cover one/third of the Earth's land, and are growing.  Viewers see thousands of elephants and buffalo trek up to hundreds of miles to get to water as the seasons change.  Then its elephants playing in and diving under the refreshing water.  Baboons are pictured walking upright through the water - not a normal thing for them.  Wild hunting dogs use teamwork against a herd of impala.

""Pole to Pole"" closes with emperor penguins huddling in the bitter Antarctica cold - protecting each other (they rotate the outside and inside positions) and their eggs and new chicks.

My only criticism of this product is seeing the bad side of wildlife - wolves running down a baby caribou, a white shark chasing down a fur seal, a lost baby elephant looking for its mother - following her scent in the wrong direction, etc.  Then again, that's part of planet earth.",1194825600,6,1874,4.627272727272727
