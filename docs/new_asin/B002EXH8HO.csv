3920559,5,B002EXH8HO,Hard to believe that Hollywood actually made a movie and inserted major parts of the Gospel! This was made in the days when our Judeo-Christian beliefs were commonplace. Highly recommend the movie. Wish there were more line this today.,1410480000,4,235,5.051282051282051

3920561,4,B002EXH8HO,"Let me start by saying that if you like Westerns, this is as good as most -- not a classic, but worth watching.  Because it uses real names, however, it is sort of like the screen writer took all the facts and mixed them up and then took them out nearly at random to create a story.  Therefore, to those who might appreciate a better understanding of the truth of the story, I'll make some observations.

Chief Kamiakin was a real chief, the son of a Palouse father and a Yakima mother; he grew up with his mother and lived on Ahtanum Creek, which was the center of the Yakima area (now the north boundary of the Yakama reservation).  Without question, he was the most powerful chief, uniting most of the Washington Territory tribes in 1855 to try to stop the white settler invasion of their territory.  By 1868 -- the supposed time of the movie -- after having escaped to Canada, then went going to Montana Blackfeet country -- he was living peacefully a few miles south of the location of the movie's story, on Rock Lake, where he farmed for the rest of his life.  [Before 1855, he was using irrigation on his farm on Ahtanum Creek, having learned about it from Father Charles Pandosy, the missionary priest there.]  The mission is still there, and I have attended Mass with several of the great chief's descendants, and had pleasant conversations with them.

This brings up another goofy scene in the movie, where they claim he was baptized ""Andrew"" but returned to his ""savage"" ways.  In fact, seeing the good the priests were doing in his wife's uncle's area, he asked for a mission for his people.  He was the first to have his children baptized.  Chief Kamiakin, however refused to be baptized because he would have to give up four of his five wives.  To his honor, he could not see turning them out to fend for themselves, with such a shortage of warriors due to wars and hunting mishaps, just so he could be baptized.  Two days before he died, now with only one wife still living, he sent to the mission for a priest, and he was baptized, taking the name of Matthew.

Timothy, a Nez Perc, was a real person, as well.  He was one of only two seemingly genuine converts of the Protestant missionary Henry Spalding.  [It was Spalding who had the printing press at Lapwai, fifty miles to the south of the location of the story.]  It is true that he interpreted and guided the U.S. Army troops.  But this brings up a question.  The story revolves around the ""Stedlo"" expedition; the real officer was Col. Steptoe.  They were going to Fort Colville from Fort Walla Walla in 1858 to investigate Indian harassment of miners who were trespassing on Indian lands.  A direct route would be nearly straight north, yet they were about a hundred miles east -- right through the camas root grounds, where all the Plateau tribes had gathered to store up the camas for winter.  Was Timothy and his Nez Perc guides misleading the Colonel, hoping to get a fight started, knowing that all those warriors gathered in one place, upon see the army complete with a cannon, would become alarmed?  Also, it was the real Timothy who showed the colonel the only way of escape from being trapped on the hill, not the white ""renegade"" soldier.

The mad-dash ride of the missionary was also based on fact, but totally distorted.  The real ride was made by Father Joseph Joset, S.J., who rode ninety miles in one day (and night) to try to keep the Coeur d'Alene warriors from joining in any battle.  He talked to Colonel Steptoe, and while they were talking, it was one of the Nez Perc who attacked Coeur d'Alene Chief Vincent, almost knocking him off his horse, challenging them to fight.  As the priest and colonel were talking, a rider came in and told the priest the Palouse were ready to attack, to get out of the way.  He immediately told Colonel Steptoe and raced back to his Coeur d'Alenes and managed for the most part to keep them out of the fight.  In no way was Chief Kamiakin in the conference.

During the battle that ensued, Chief Kamiakin was injured by a falling tree branch, shot off by the cannon.  He was far enough from the thick of the fighting that he was with one of his wives when his shoulder was broken.  After his defeat three years earlier he was not very enthusiastic about fighting the Army.  The real instigator of the attack on Col. Steptoe's group was a Palouse named Chief Tilcoax.

There are many other goofy ""facts"" in the movie, but I'll add only one more true fact.  Of all the chiefs most active in the WT Indian Wars, Chief Kamiakin was the most important, the most wanted by the Army and settlers, and the only one who was not murdered by Col. Wright's terror campaign against the Indians.  Even the Walla Walla chief Peu-peu-mox-mox -- who had fought with Fremont to free California from the Mexicans -- was murdered under some phoney pretext.  A year after the Steptoe disaster, Chief Kamiakin told Fr. J.P. De Smet, the greatest Jesuit missionary to the American Indians that he had never murdered anyone.  And, he was telling the truth unless one would say that any Brit who killed a German in WWII was a murderer.

Enjoy the movie - just don't take if for fact because they use real names and tribes.",1355270400,22,5224,4.522896698615549

8368446,5,B002EXH8HO,"According to some information, I learned John Wayne was going to make this movie but passed on it. Jeff Chandler got the part and did a great job. The plot, story line, and references from the bible were used. Acting was pretty darn good too. Ward Bond, Lee Marvin and Dorothy Malone were in this movie. All are very good actors.",1501804800,2,329,4.409836065573771
8368447,4,B002EXH8HO,"a previous poster did a very long and thorough treatise on the actual people portrayed in this movie.  Okay, so Hollywood has always ""bent"" the facts and rewrote according to their whims.

Without any of this previous knowledge, I was able to completely enjoy this movie, one of the best westerns that I have seen in quite some time.

This movie is a joy to behold, and in this case, I reiterate the title of my post:  where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise...

better to just watch this without ANY previous knowledge of the ""facts"" and take it for what it is:  a darn good movie, with some solid acting, and beautiful cinematography.",1491177600,,644,4.508620689655173
