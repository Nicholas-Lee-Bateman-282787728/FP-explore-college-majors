8079506,5,B000ASDFTK,"""Cartas Marcadas"" 1948

In this reworking of Taming of the Shrew, Pedro Infante and Marga Lopez shine as two people who love to hate each other, then hate to love each other, while pride and stubbornness keep their heads from admitting what their hearts both know. The plot is about Victoria (Lopez) and Manuel (Infante), who to comply with a will, must marry each other. Director Rene Cardona co-stars as  Don Manuel, who is Victoria's father and Manuel's godfather, and he finally has to manipulate circumstances to get the squabbling pair together. A great cast surrounds them, with the ever funny ""El Chicote"" Armando Soto as Manuel's sidekick Tepalcate, and Alejandro Cangherotti as Ernesto, the town doctor (for both human and animal patients) who is madly in love with Victoria.

Chucho Monge wrote the score, and there are six wonderful songs, some of them with Infante's marvelous ""Mariachi Shout,"" and one of them a female serenata with the Hermanas Julian backing Marga Lopez. The lovely cinematography by Jack Draper still looks good considering the age of the film, however the audio has deteriorated a little, but is helped by raising the volume. There are many hilarious scenes as the antagonists play dastardly tricks on each other, like gift-wrapping a great big live rat, and this is another of Infante's romantic comedies that is a 100% winner.

""Los Hijos de Maria Morales"" 1952

Life is one big party for los hermanos Morales, and Jose (Pedro Infante) and Luis (Antonio Badu) get a reputation as ""un par de escandalosos"" as they go from town to town, and from fiesta to fiesta, seducing the girls, and getting  the male population very upset. They get tripped up, when they come to the town where Don Carlos Salvatierra is Mayor, and Don Carlos tricks them into thinking they're visiting celebrities, meeting them with a band, and deftly escorts them into a comfy prison cell, decorated with a large and threatening portrait of their mother; what follows is a hilarious romantic romp, with fast pacing and a sharp, witty script, that will keep you entertained from start to finish.

The cast is superb, with Infante and Badu once again making a great team (they made ""El Gavilan Pollero"" the previous year), and Andres Soler marvelous as Don Carlos. Irma Dorantes and Carmelita Gonzalez are funny and sassy as Don Carlos' daughter Maria and and her friend Gloria (""las dos Rositas""), and Emma Roldan is the much feared Maria Morales (""quien manda, manda!""). Directed by Fernando de Fuentes, and with music by Manuel Esperon, there are lots of songs, and it's hard not to get misty eyed while listening to Infante's superb version of Jose Alfredo Jimenez' beautiful and melodic ""Corazon, Corazon."" This is one of the funniest of Infante's romantic comedies, and will delight his fans. El Idolo de Guamuchil lives forever in his many heartwarming films, that are filled with love and laughter.",1176940800,,2912,4.954918032786885
