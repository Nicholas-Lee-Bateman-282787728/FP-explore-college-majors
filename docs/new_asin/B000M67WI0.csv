I had seen it before, one time,was played on TV. Now you can understand, from the begining. Its just GREAT!!A fabulous of cast, good acting!",1317859200,3,281,4.423076923076923
8166718,5,B000M67WI0,"This is actually a very good, quality film telling the story of what happened before Dallas.  It is really quite well done and enjoyable.  Unfortunately, if you're a big fan of the show there's a chance you might feel something is missing-without the actual cast of Dallas the show, it just doesn't really feel like something you want to watch more than once,as a history lesson.  However, a true fan won't miss it.",1194739200,14,415,4.657534246575342
