1425386,5,B00005CC8R,My son is a huge fan of Richard Harrison. He has this movie Ninja Terminator on VHS tape and it began playing badly. I found this movie on DVD. The order came quickly and in excellent condition I will order from this company again. Thank you !,1357430400,,243,4.191489361702128
1425387,5,B00005CC8R,"I have no idea what just happened. This movie seems like it was written by an eight year old, and the majority of the voice-overs don't fit the ethnicities of the characters, but everything they did wrong just ends up making the movie even funnier.  Everyone who enjoys bad movies should watch this.",1345248000,,299,4.6415094339622645
1425388,1,B00005CC8R,"This movie is made by Godfrey Ho, a master of making a number of Z-grade movies with a ""cut-and-paste"" technique. He would shoot footage for one movie, often using Caucasian actors for exportation, then edit the scenes into several other movies, mixing them with footage from old, unfinished or unreleased Asian movies (using Thai as well as Chinese or Filipino footage), then trying to make the story somewhat coherent through dubbing and voice-overs. He would then have four or five movies (of rock-bottom quality, of course) while having spent the budget of one.

And this is why I'm not satisfied with this movie. It's too obvious that scenes aren't belonging to the same movie. First we have Richard Harrison playing a ninja of three martial-arts students search for the Golden Ninja Warrior, a statue reputed to have magic powers, and then we have another guy having a fight against a gang with their blond hair leader.

What do these two heroes have in common?  None even though they try with voice dubbing like talking to each other on phone about the golden statue, but still it doesn't help.

I expected full 1 hour 30 min long ninja movie. Instead I see 30 min long ninja movie mixed with 1 hour Bruce Lee copycat movies

A better ninja movie?  Any of the American Ninja movies",1336003200,,1288,4.727678571428571
1425389,3,B00005CC8R,"Ninja Terminator is a good movie, but Harry has the uglyest ninja costume I have ever seen, and I think any one of us can go and chop up a watermelon. The fight seens were great, but Jaguar Wong( Harry's henceman) had more fight seens then the star himself. Not to mention the master ninja had the most dumbest, unnessicary laugh I have ever heard. The last time I watched this movie I was barely 4, but know that I got to see it again, i give it a 3 out of 5.",1130371200,2,460,3.956989247311828
1425390,5,B00005CC8R,"IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME OR A PLACE YOU SAW SOMETHING CALLED TO YOU,I MUST SAY THAT THIS PARTICULAR (EX RENTAL)""THE NINJA TERMINATOR"" CERTAINTLY WANTED ME TO GIVE THIS ONE A WATCH.
I WOULD SAY LATE 70S FOR THIS MARTIAL ARTS FLICK.AND THATS WHAT IT IS NOTHING BUT THE BEST FIGHTING SCENES.AND STUNTS ACHEVIED FOR A VERY LOW BUDGET AND I MUST SAY LOW BUDGET BUT VERY WELL MAID HONG KONG MOVIE.
ONLY THE MOVIE WAS SHOOT IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD RATHER THAN THE CHINA CITY.HAWAII WAS AMOT ATTRACTIV SPOT FOR THE NINJA TERMINATOR.
I AM VEY MUCH IN LOVE WITH THIS MOVIE DUE TO THE LACK OF RESOURCES THAT THE COULD WRK WITH.THE DIDNT HAVE THE BEST DIRECTOR BUT I MUST SAY THE ACTORS WHERE FAIRLY WELL KNOWN FOR THERE TIME EG RICHARD HARRISON AND WONG CHENG LI GOT THE ROLE IN NINJA TERMINAOR.
I ACTUALLY FOUND WONG CHENG LI WHO PLAYED JAGUAR ( A DETECTIVE) TO BE AN EXCELLENT FIGHTER TRULLY AN ARTFORM. THE NINJA ECHNIQUE BY RICHARD HARRISON WAS VERY MUCH ALIVE THROUGHT HIS ROLE.
BRUCE LEE MAY OF BEEN APPROACHED FOR JAGUARS ROLE.BUT LIKE I SAID THE PEOPLE IN THE MOVIE DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB FILLING IN ASWELL.
THE NINJA TERMINATOR IS A NO NAME TITLE.ALTHOUGH MY VIDEO IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION THE ARTWORK ON THE COVER MAY VERY FROM AMERICAN VIDEO. NOW IT MAY BE AN IDEA TO SEE ONE OR TO IF AVLIABLE TO A SELLER.
SIMPLE MOVIE FACT..
*ONE GOLDEN NINJA WARRIOR
*3 NINJAS
*ONLY 1 CAN HOLD POSSECTION OF SUPREME NINJA POWER.MAINTANING THE FULL PEACE OF THE  GOLDEN STATUE.
AND NOW THE STORY.
THE INCREDIBLE SECREETIVE AND MYSTERIOUS NINJA TECHNIQUE IS ALIVE.THE DIVINE POWER OF THE NINJA EMPIRE IS EMBODIED BY A GOLDEN STATUE KNOWN AS THE AS THE ""GOLDEN NINJA WARRIOR"" WHICHIS DIVIDED INTO THREE(3) PARTS-IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE FABULOUS AND ULTIMATE SUPER HUMAN STRENGTH OF TE NINJA SORCERY.ONE MUST.MUST BE IN POSSESSION OF ALL-3PARTS....(123)
HARRY BARON AND TOMASHI ARE THE 3 MAIN NINJAS IN THE MOVIE ALSO THE 3 TOP STUDENTS IN THE NINJA EMPIRE.AND EACH OF THEM HAS ACCESS TO THE GOLDEN NINJA WARRIOR.BUT THEY BREA THE RULES AND EACH BIT OF THE GOLDEN NINJA WARRIOR IS STOLEN AND DIVIDED AMONGEST THE 3 NINJAS.
2 YEARS LATER IN HONG KONG.1 OF THE NINJAS IS FOUND MURDERD A SERARCH NOW FOR ITS WEAR ABOUTS OF THE 3RD PART OF THE GOLDEN NIJA WARRIOR IS A MYSTERORY.HARRY AND BARON BOTH SUSPECT THAT TOMASHI(NINJA WHO DIED) HAS LEFT HIS SISTER AND BROTHER.MICHIKO AND EEKAZA.BARON SENDS HIS HENCHMAN TIGER CHAN TO HARASS THE TWO,WITH THE RESULT THAT EEKAZA IS BRUTALLY KILLED (AND I MEAN VERY BUSTED UP IN THIS SCENE) AND MICHIKO(SISTER) KIDNAPPED.
HARRY(THE OTHER GOD NINJA)MY HERO ASKS HIS GOOD FREIND JAQUAR WONG.AN INTERPOL AGENT,TO SEEK OUT THE GOLDEN NIJA WARRIR PIECE* BY RESCUING MICHIKO.I MUST SAY THE STORY LINE IS SOLID AND WELL PRESERVED.!!
BUT JAQUAR HAS PLANS OF HIS OWN.TO NAILBARONS GANG AS POSING AS A # HERION SMUGGLER #
THE PLOT THAN BUILDS TO AN EXCITING CLIMAX AS YAMATO FROM THE NINJA EMPIRE EMERGES AS TOMAHI'S .MURDERER.&.PURSUER...OF THE GOLDEN NINJA WARRIOR. WOW!!

ID GIVE IT ***** STARS.",1033689600,,3387,4.598347107438016
1425391,5,B00005CC8R,"This movie rules, sure its tacky and very badly dubbed but who cares.
the story of the golden ninja warrior has nothing to do with the jaguar wong subplot but they are both awesome. jaguar wong has the phattest moves and the best lines of any bad martial arts movie hero, tell me anyone who can top the line (this is after being captured by some hoods) ""can i have a cigarette"" the hood gives him one ""i don't usually smoke this brand..........but i will........for you"" pure class. and the absurd ninja plot where 3 ninjas are after the statue of the golden ninja warrior to make them invincible is excellent with some of the best eye make up and huge eyebrows ever seen.
i reccomend this movie to anyone who loves bad karate flicks its wicked",1005696000,2,744,4.437956204379562
1425392,2,B00005CC8R,This video is overall okay! But...the theme of this movie is boring. I don't recomend someone 100% sure to buy this video...but i would!,990748800,,136,4.708333333333333
7938028,1,B00005CC8R,"The movie pictured from New Pacific Pictures is not the 1985 film Ninja Terminator with Richard Harrison, it's a 1972 flick called Ninja Blacklist and retitled for late-eighties/early-nineties vhs releases. The info on this entry is contradictory and caused me to order the wrong tape.",1506384000,,285,5.355555555555555
7938029,5,B00005CC8R,"Well, this is it, folks - the pinnacle of human artistic achievement. It begins with lines like ""Today is the 20th anniversary of our ninja empire"" and somehow gets even better from there. One of the heroes has a glorious mustache and a Garfield phone.

Might as well not watch this, because all other movies will forever pale in comparison to this masterstroke of sheer genius.",1504224000,,378,4.7272727272727275
7938030,1,B00005CC8R,"Terrible transfer.  The YouTube version is better, with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and no shaky pan-and-scan action.  This movie was filmed with a much steadier hand than this version gives it credit for.  ALSO THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME.",1497916800,4,228,4.947368421052632
7938031,5,B00005CC8R,"Honestly an amazing movie. Everyone shouldn't just watch it, but experience it.",1464998400,,79,5.666666666666667
7938032,4,B00005CC8R,Not bad. Better than most other movies in the sense that I got a good laugh out of it.,1418860800,,86,3.5789473684210527
7938033,5,B00005CC8R,"LOL corny as heck, but hey it's a ninja movie from the 70's, what do you expect? Great ""sitting at home on a cold night with popcorn"" movie!",1415750400,,140,4.035714285714286
7938034,5,B00005CC8R,"This is a film beyond anything Hollywood can do today or in the last twenty years. You can go and see Tom Cruise or Will Smith and feel you've been cheated but Godfrey Ho is obviously a genius and makes bizarre films that make no sense but make you feel satisfied inside and leave you with a warm feelings of joy. Yeah, it's rubbish but it's brilliant rubbish. Beyond reality. In another realm of filmmaking. If you have an open mind and a good sense of humour you will enjoy this film to a great extent. If you can understand it and more especially the ending then you too are on a genius level. You could be on the level of Godfrey Ho. I have ordered the four film two disc set and I'm looking forward to wallowing in more Ninja classics. Don't terminate your chance of owning Ninja Terminator, you will regret it!!",1400284800,2,817,4.311688311688312
7938035,4,B00005CC8R,Reminds me of my glory days.  Oh the days when my blade rained red.  They'll never have my golden ninja warrior.,1388793600,2,112,4.285714285714286
7938036,5,B00005CC8R,"If you like movies that are so bad, they're good, then Godfrey Ho is probably a familiar name to you, and in my opinion Ninja Terminator is his master work. Kind of Starring Richard Harrison as Ninja Master Harry who fights two other ninjas for posession of the Golden Ninja Warrior which will grant ultimate ninja power. THis film is actually two films jammed together, the A movie involves Richard Harrison in a camoflage ninja outfit fighting ninjas. The B film which comprises the majority of the movie is from an unreleased asian martial arts film and follows the badly dubbed adventures of Jaguar as he fights a series of people with his feet for Harry in a search for a piece of the Golden Ninja warrior.
The shoddy Editing, dubbing and cropping of this 4:3 film (at one point two people have a conversation with only their knees on screen) and bad story make this film hilariously great fun. Watch it with some friends and riff it to shreds.",1368316800,2,949,4.588235294117647
7938037,4,B00005CC8R,"This is the best movie I have seen all year, every Ninja movie buff should add this Instant classic to their collections. the action seen are Phenomenal, and the acting is the best, i've seen since Double Team.",1358985600,2,210,4.552631578947368
