8049472,5,B0007OC7AU,"Having very recently been ""turned on"" (to borrow a once popular phrase from the 1960s) to this TV series from an earlier amazon review, I felt compelled to write something about it for a number of reasons. 1) I have been a fan of all things Hammer for many years and though I was aware of this series, I had never seen a single episode until now. 2) Having now seen most of the episodes courtesy of You Tube, I can concur with the earlier review that this is a quality offering, much better produced than the earlier HAMMER HOUSE OF HORROR series which looked like the low budget TV show that it was. 3) It turns out that I had seen at least one of the episodes when it aired on ABC back in 1984 but had forgotten all about it.

I find it interesting and somewhat ironic that the old Hammer Films which rose to prominence after WW II by making B movies with lower tier American stars for distribution in the United States (see my HAMMER FILM NOIR reviews) before hitting it big with Gothic horror films should wind up producing 70 minute movies with U.S. stars for the American market once again. That gives a sense of the company having come full circle. These would be the last movies produced by the old Hammer which would lie moribund for over two decades before starting up again under new management and having a ""monster"" hit with the first WOMAN IN BLACK. It would also be the swan song of many long time Hammer collaborators like directors Val Guest, Peter Sasdy and Cyril Frankel as well as music director Phillip Martell who had been with the company longer than anyone else.

There were 13 episodes (how appropriate) of which I have managed to see most but not all (my You Tube is not as good as the other reviewer's) and even the ones I wasn't impressed with like BLACK CARRION (pretty good until the payoff) kept me engaged and entertained. CHILD'S PLAY, which reworks an old TWILIGHT ZONE episode, was quite effective with echoes of director Val Guest's classic sci-fi film, THE DAY THE EARTH CAUGHT FIRE. As the earlier review gives a brief summation of each episode I'll refrain from doing the same but will go on record as saying that MARK OF THE DEVIL (shades of THE ILLUSTRATED MAN), IN POSSESSION, THE SWEET SCENT OF DEATH and THE CORVINI INHERITANCE were among my favorites. From the beginning, 20th Century Fox has owned the rights to these films so it is up to Fox to release them on Region 1 DVD. Since HAMMER HOUSE OF HORROR has been newly released, maybe these will soon follow but I won't hold my breath.",1421625600,,2532,4.454741379310345
8049473,5,B0007OC7AU,"The five stars here is for the show, not the product because the product as it stands, is only available via third party sellers here on Amazon, and that too at an exorbitant price. On Amazon UK there is a complete collection DVD set of Hammer House of Mystery and Suspense, but it too is only available via third party sellers. I hope at some point this product will be made available and reissued for the US market.

Hammer House of Mystery and Suspense was an anthology series made by Hammer Studios. It was known in the States as Fox Mystery Theater. Unlike Hammer's other anthology series, the episodes in this series ran as full-length feature films, clocking in at an average 70 minutes per episode. Like many anthology collections, this collection too is a mixed bag. I am fond of this series since it brings back memories of watching the episodes with my family members. I love how I can revisit some of the TV stars of the 70s and 80s here. Here are the episodes:

Mark of the Devil - Dirk Benedict is being harassed by loansharks and out of desperation robs and kills an Asian tattoo artist. But he learns crime doesn't pay when he notices a bizarre and self-incriminating tattoo is beginning to take shape on his chest. His beautiful new wife, an heiress (played by Jenny Seagrove) doesn't know what to make of her new husband's strange behavior, until the true horror reveals itself.
Last Video and Testament - Deborah Raffin stars in this concerning a couple who plot to kill an eccentric rich man. Of course, the victim, portrayed by David Langton exacts his vengeance from beyond the grave.
Child's Play - Mary Crosby stars in this chiller with a classic ending. A family awakens one morning to find they have been bricked in with no way out of their home. Soon they begin to lose their memories and have no memory of life outside their home. Oh, there's also a green blob in this one!
The Corvini Inheritance - Frank Lane (David McCallum) is a surveillance expert and when he finds out his neighbor (Jan Francis) is being stalked, he offers his help. Frank's surveillance uncovers a strange revelation, so what will he do with his evidence?
In Possession - This is a chiller indeed. Frank and Sylvia Daly are celebrating their move overseas by having some drinks one night at their apartment. However, the night turns into a long nightmare for both as they discover the apartment is haunted by the restless spirit of a couple. Great ending here.
Paint Me a Murder - This was a ho-hum one and not a favorite of mine. A painter's widow begins selling his paintings in great quantities and the paintings sell like hot cakes. How is it that there seems to be an endless supply of these paintings? The storyline is quite generic and predictable and this lackluster production is saved by some credible acting.
A Distant Scream - Two excellent actors, David Carradine and Stephanie Beacham play the leads in this worthwhile episode that focuses on justice wrongly served.
Black Carrion - another dud for me: a freelance journalist and his girlfriend track down an elusive pop duo to their country manor and find themselves caught in a time warp.
The Late Nancy Irving - Cristina Raines (who acted in one of my favorite horror films of the 80s, ""The Sentinel"") plays a woman trapped in a hospital after being in an accident. She seems to be getting weaker by the day and discovers to her horror that she is being held prisoner in the hospital for a sinister reason.
Czech Mate - An unsuspecting woman is lured to Czechoslovakia by her ex-husband on the promise of mending fences, but discovers that she is a pawn in something sinister. This is one of the best episodes in this set.
The Sweet Scent of Death - the new US ambassador to England installs his wife in a beautiful English home in the countryside but this turns out to be a terror-filled experience for his wife.
And the Wall Came Tumbling Down - This was a bit too slow but I loved the premise and all in all, it proved to be a worthwhile watch: the plot involves a present-day preservationist who wishes to preserve an old church which in the process of being torn down has resulted in a spate of ""accidents"". The church, it is discovered, contains some evil forces that should not be unleashed.
The Tennis Court - features a haunted tennis court...enough said.

Fortunately for viewers who would like to watch these episodes, they are available on Youtube. I would love to own the DVD collection and hope it is reissued soon for the US market (the last time it was reissued was in 2006 for the UK market). It is certainly a worthwhile collection for horror and Hammer enthusiasts.",1419897600,,4653,4.610373944511459
