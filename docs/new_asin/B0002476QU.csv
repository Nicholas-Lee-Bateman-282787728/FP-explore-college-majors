For those who aren't familiar with the show, Seven Little Monsters is about--what else?--seven not-so-little monsters and their many adventures! They live at 1234567 Chestnut Street with their mom (who is significantly smaller than them) and pet cow Belinda. The monster characters often help each other solve their problems and can frequently be seen playing with the neighborhood children.

The episodes included are:
Good Morning!  -- The monsters are sent to the grocery store to buy milk for their pancake breakfast.
Good Night!  -- It's bedtime but the monsters won't go to sleep!
The Mystery of the Missing Five  -- Four learns an important lesson when he wishes Five were never born.
Seven Monsters and a Baby  -- Just as the title suggests, the monsters babysit.

The episodes run around 22 minutes each which is standard for the first two seasons of the show.

Since this is a UK DVD it will only play on Region 2 DVD players OR on a computer through the help of a media player like VLC. It's very easy and you don't have to switch your region back and forth like on Windows Media Player. Once you're able to watch the DVD the quality is phenomenal and gets high praise from me.

It's too bad the USA wasn't as lucky when it came to DVD releases of this show because it's a very good kids show and hey, if Maurice Sendak created this it has to be good, right? I highly recommend this to any parents who want to show their kids a good educational show which isn't obnoxious like the kids' programming of today.",1362355200,,1763,4.450310559006211
8021927,1,B0002476QU,"I called Amazon to make sure this would play on my up to date computer, knowing it would not necessarily play on our DVD player.  I was told that computers are different and would play all DVDs.  Well, the DVD did not play on my computer and for the same reason it would not have played on my DVD player; because it was created for Region 2 players (Australia).  Amazon should know this and not sell this product in the US.  Furthermore, the DVD manufacturer should standardize their products so as not to cause such problems.  Does anyone know where I can buy a Seven Little Monsters DVD for US viewing?",1197244800,6,604,4.405405405405405
