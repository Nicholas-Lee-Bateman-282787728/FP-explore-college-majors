1661153,5,B00005TNFV,"The DVD is fairly bare boones with just the 85 minute live performance but it's worth it.  The picture and sound are outstanding, probably the best I've seen on a concert DVD.  I recently bougth Incubus's DVD and thought it was fanstastic but this even tops that for quality.  The band's performance is kick ... also.  I saw the band this past summer and they were amazing.  I was hoping they would release a DVD of the tour and here it is.  If your into Godsmack at all buy this DVD.",1010016000,,484,4.263736263736264

1661177,4,B00005TNFV,"I enjoyed this concert very much.  A lot of energy and an overall rockin' performance by Godsmack.  The sound seemed fine to me despite what a lot of other reviewers say, but I'm not a sound ""critic"" by any means.  My only complaints was that it's a pretty short DVD.  There aren't really any special features and the navigation between the songs on the menu is pretty strangely laid out.  So my only complaint is that there should have been some bonus footage or interviews or something but I guess for 15 bucks it's not too bad.",1193356800,,530,4.422680412371134

1661180,5,B00005TNFV,"This DVD is perfect for any Godsmack fan. Nothing beats seeing your favorite band perform live. It's even better when the sound quality is top notch. The video/sound quality is superb and I have no complaints about it. There are no special features and it would've been a great addition to the DVD, but it doesnt ruin it in anyway. So if you, or someone you know likes Godsmack, than this is the DVD for you.",1163030400,,408,4.381578947368421
1661181,3,B00005TNFV,"If you already have the Changes DVD, you can pretty much skip this unless you are a big time Godsmack fan or want to see them performing more songs from Awake other than the title track.  People say the audio is horrible.  That is the major complaint from most reviewers and I have to agree, to an extent.  The worst part of it is Sully's vocals.  In this concert, his audio levels are way down.  You really have to turn up your TV in order to hear him.  However I noticed that his voice seems to become clearer and louder as you progressed through the concert or maybe that was my ears adjusting to the low volume.  To simply put it, the worst part is the beginning and I swear I also hear a slight background ping in the beginning as well from the snare drum.  Other then that problem, this is a pretty decent DVD and show from 2001.  The largest problem however isn't even the fault of the DVD.  If you have seen the Changes DVD, you will be spoiled by how flawless it is and will view this one as being a lame imitation.  If you want to get Live and don't have changes yet, I advise you to buy this one first so you won't be so negative to it the first time you see it.  Last comment: $23?  I wouldn't pay that price unless my life depended on it.  Go to a Best Buy, they have it for a shockingly low 6.29!  Is that an unbelievable price difference or what?  Well like I said if you are a big Godsmack fan check this out, otherwise you can skip it.",1140739200,2,1452,4.059859154929577
1661182,5,B00005TNFV,"I defintley recommend to all rock/metal fans who love to see a good live rock show.  Everything about this concert was superb.  Nothing bad to say about it.

1661183,3,B00005TNFV,"I feel the sound quality is very good, except for one thing.  The vocals are too low.  When Sully talks to the crowd you can hardly hear him over the cheering crowd.  If the vocals were louder this would be one of the best live concerts ever shot.  However, because of the low vocals Its just above average and this is coming from a huge godsmack fan, by the way the new DVD called changes, kicks this dvd ass.  Except that the live songs are broken up with interviews in between.  I would highly recommend changes over this dvd, only because the low vocals.",1101513600,2,558,4.3173076923076925
1661184,3,B00005TNFV,"Without a doubt, Godsmack puts on an incredible concert. It's very high energy. The band members are excellent performers; however, you can't hear the vocals. Even when Sully addresses the crowd, his words are distorted and virtually inaudible. It's quite unfortunate because, if the vocals were clearer, I would rate this DVD a lot higher.

The DVD is enjoyable only as a result of the overall energy that comes blasting through the speakers.

For superior sound, listen to their Changes DVD. That is incredible. And, I do mean incredible. Unfortunatley, even that DVD has a flaw, the concert footage is broken up by interviews, and the song Voodoo is trampled on by interviews.

If this Live DVD had the sound quality of the Changes DVD, it would be one of the best concert films ever. But, it doesn't.

It's a shame...",1100908800,6,821,4.801418439716312
1661195,2,B00005TNFV,"I recently got my hands on a copy of this DVD and I am extremely disappointed after acquiring it. I have an extensive music DVD collection and this is by far the worst sounding DVD I have. The sound is too low, particularly the vocals.  I have music DVD's where the footage was taken in the 60's, 70's, 80's, or the early 90's and each of these DVD's have a much better sound than this DVD. I feel there is absolutely no excuse for this considering it was made when all this technology was available to them.

The band seems to be putting on a good show, but I found it impossible to  enjoy it because of the sound.",1098489600,4,615,4.151260504201681

1661197,5,B00005TNFV,"I saw Godsmack a few years ago, probably mid-2001, and I enjoyed myself at the concert, and while nothing's ever as good as the real thing, a DVD comex close. It's got all their hits (""Awake"", ""Greed"", ""Voodoo"", ""Keep Away"", ""Whatever"") as well as some of my favorites (""Trippin'"", Sick of Life"", ""Bad Religion"") to keep me (and more than likely YOU) entertained. They always give a good performance and Sully does a good taking with the crowd during and in between songs.
The concert is 80 minutes, so it's well worth the price. I didn't even think about this until I read the other reviews, but a lot of people complain about the sound quality. As I said, I wouldn't have even thought about the sound quality because it sounded good to me, but then again, I was listening to it on headphones on the computer. But my only complaint is that there are absolutely no extras. But hey, the concert's the main point, and you get one hell of a main point.",1076371200,2,949,4.459770114942529
1661198,4,B00005TNFV,"...Like it's a big shock to hear that a live Godsmack concert video rocks the proverbial house. Opening up with the head-banging ""Awake,"" heavy-hitting Godsmack and their legion of hometown fans, give you a glimpse of what's in store; a cool concert that showcases the band's gimmick free sound and Sully Erna's infectious charisma and growling. Given their reputation as a ""caveman band,"" it's a mild surprise this show is not at all boring and contains many sections that require multiple viewing; see Erna's mock drum battle during ""Get Up, Get Out."" Of course, Erna is the main attraction and has no problem holding the camera's and listener's attention; whether it's on the subdued ""Voodoo"" or the double-crossing rant ""Greed."" The hometown audience's enthusiasm comes in handy on the participation bits in ""Keep Away"" and ""Whatever,"" where Erna incites the crowd to curse at him in unison...which if course they do at deafening volume. No tricks, no B.S., just hardcore riffs and attitude. A summarization the band would no doubt find flattering.",1064448000,,1052,5.122093023255814

1661200,4,B00005TNFV,"Rather than repeat what other reviewers have already written, I felt compelled to address the concern others have made regarding the sound and vocal quality. This DVD sounds like the audio was recorded off an open digital microphone rather than straight from the soundboard. It has a bit of an echo to it, and at times the vocals can get a little bit too low in the mix. Overall it is a great DVD, but not the highly produced and polished ""platinum quality"" sound that some people have maybe come to expect. I attended a Godsmack show on this tour, and this DVD is what it sounded like to be there. If you like the band you will love this DVD.",1044748800,3,643,4.322314049586777

1661202,4,B00005TNFV,"I'm giving this DVD 4 stars because the audio quality isn't sharp enough for me to get a true sense of how they sounded at that concert however, the intensity and stage presence that Sully showed here made up for that. I really loved all the songs they played here, even the less known ones which by the way sounded better then their radio hits. This band gets classified as having a similiar style to Alison & chains but, I think Godsmacks music is more catchy and powerfull. One thing I noticed when watching this DVD is their stage setting suggests an ancient mystical environment which made me realize that this is what their sound is inspired by. This is probably why thier sound is not as cheezy as most of the so called hard rock and metal acts we see these days. Thats why I dig it",1041811200,,789,4.337837837837838
1661203,5,B00005TNFV,"This is one of the best live Godsmack show's
I have ever seen. I won the roadie for a day contest
from the radio station Waaf,I also got to watch this
show from the sound board and it was awesome. I didn't
even have to be a roadie. After the show I had passes to
meet and greet Godsmack and I got their autographs. I
didn't stay for the after party because you had to be
30 years old and over to drink so I left after I met
Godsmack. I didn't get the chance to meet Staind,Cold
or Systamatic but I was basically there for Godsmack anyway.
This concert is a must own for every Godsmack fan.
They played all their hit's and it's the entire show
on the video and DVD.Trust me I was there and I saw the
set list from the sounboard and all the songs on here are
all the songs they played that night. The Awake tour
was one of their best tour's and I can't wait for the new
album which will be called ""Faceless"" and it should be
out in stores in  April 2003 with their new drummer.
Godsmack rules!!",1040256000,7,992,4.01010101010101
1661204,3,B00005TNFV,"Godsmack is overall a hybrid hard rock band. Why do I use the word hybrid? Because it is obvious they are disciples of Alice In Chains, that is too obvious, but they also are heavily influenced by other bands and that we will discuss later. Overall this is an entertaining concert on video. Entertaining because the set looks medieval and artistic, the camera work isn't that bad, it has good panning, epic shots and excellent close-ups. However, I can't say the same praise for the music. A lot of Godsmack's music sounds repetitive and just like loud guitar riffs with some yelling. They copy Alice In Chains to perfection in some areas. But yet they are still good performers. Singer Sully Erna shows he is a good guitar-player and pulls off one excellent drum solo that shows he is an excellent percussionist. In his leather pants and shamanistic ways I seriously wonder if he is not so much a disciple of Alice In Chains as he might be of Jim Morrison and The Doors. Some of the songs are really good like the Eastern, hypnotic ""Spiral"" and the equally evocative ""Voodoo."" These are the two best songs here. Others like ""Vampires"" seem like sonic time killers. But they put on a good show above all. Erna never seems boring, the editing is good and artistic. Nothing important is ever missed on the screen (including a few flashing fans). Godsmack is not one of the great bands of our time, they are however, a good hard rock band that can pump-up the house and keep us entertained, at least for a while.",1022976000,,1509,4.571955719557195
1661215,1,B00005TNFV,"The sound is terrible! I love the music and I've worn out both of their CDs but the poor sound on this DVD has no power at all. Sully is almost inaudible. Godsmack ought to be embarrassed by this release. I can't even watch the whole thing because the poor sound is such a distraction. For those that say that this is true concert sound, I submit that a concert DVD out to sound like the first row not the last row. Save your money...it's not worth half the price.",1018656000,3,464,4.166666666666667
1661216,2,B00005TNFV,"The band should demand a refund from the company they hired to make this DVD.
Sound:  For about half the concert I was wondering what was up with the sound. Then the camera panned way back, and I saw the mic hanging from the ceiling.  Yup, it appears that they just put a mic in the audience and recorded the sound that way.  Certainly sounds like it.  Yes, this disc ""features"" DTS, but for the first time that I've encountered, DTS sounds significantly WORSE than Dolby 5.1.  To top it off, the 5.1 is mostly name only - it doesn't seem that much effort was actually made separating sounds that should be on the left from those on the right, or in the back, etc.
 Why did they not go through the mixing board for the sound?  I can't even begin to imagine. For those that wrote that there is nothing wrong with the sound, it is just the way a live show sounds, compare the sound of this disc to an excellent live DVD, such as Metallica's S&M, or U2's all that you can't leave behind.  You can capture sound from a live concert, and not have the end product a muddy mess.
 Worse than the sound, however, was the complete lack of care that the producers took to capture the feeling of the concert.  I highly doubt they had even been to a show before they filmed.  It looked like they were trying to make a music video, a bunch of sweeping shots, weird angles, etc.  Except that they managed to universally miss the points of interest.  You would hardly know that there were pyrotechnics, video displays or anything else in the concert.  Looking at the other music stuff Image Entertainment has done (Tribute to Brian Wilson, Doors VH1 special, the Who live) is it really any surprise that they had no idea how to capture this concert?
 And special features?  What?  Interviews, road videos, behind the scenes, interviews with the director of the concert, music videos, etc.  Don't waste your time looking for them.  They ain't here.
 Worst of all, this disc completely failed to capture the essence of the concert.  NIN's ""and all that could have been"" practically bleeds emotion (perhaps this is an unfair standard for other DVD's to live up to) but Godsmack's bleeds blas.  There is no emotion, there is no attempt made to tailor this concert to Godsmack.  Had any other band been up there, I get the sense it would have been filmed and edited exactly the same.
 I like the band, but this DVD is not worth the money.",1017532800,20,2417,4.453302961275626
1661217,3,B00005TNFV,"Godsmack is one of the best bands of all time. I was really excited when I received this DVD. My partner and I loved the concert; but we were disappointed that there were no special features. Wha' happened? I thought we'd see some interview segments, music videos, and maybe some shopping opportunities...but all we got was the concert. It's enough and it's excellent...but it could have been more.",1015027200,,398,4.867647058823529
1661218,4,B00005TNFV,I know this DVD is a live one but since it is there only offical DVD I think it should have had all there Music videos on the DVD.

This live DVD by Godsmack is ubelievable, it is just like being at one of their concerts without the mosh.  As for the people who been giving this DVD lower ratings then what it is worth because of sound, you have to think that is LIVE.  Even if you like Godsmack only a litte this DVD will rock your world and make you want to go see them in concert.  There is only one thing to say about this DVD; The best concert DVD/video ever.  I especially love the ""whatever"" version they have on here.

Most of the problems are with the vocals... the center channel mix should have been a lot louder.  I tried both the Dolby Digital and DTS tracks and had the same problem.  I turned up the center channel +8db and that seemed to help some, but still not totally satisfactory for a DVD these days.  I have TV shows on my TiVo that have GodSmack playing live on them and they sound way better than this DVD.

That's all fine and good if the disc is good. For the most part, this new Godsmack DVD is very good. It's got an anamorphic widescreen transfer that is very good, and the performance just kicks A$$. The audio, on the other hand, is somewhat lacking IMO. Previous to putting the disc in, my thoughts were along the line of, ""God...this is going to be incredible!"" I'm a big Godsmack fan. My initial thought after the first minute of the concert was, ""What the hell is wrong here?!"" I mean, the thing is in DTS as well as DD, but it was just weak as all hell. Very little to nothing came out of the center channel, and my sub damn near drowned everything else out. I turned the sub down and checked to see if my center channel was connected. It was. I just wasn't getting a significant amount of volume at all. I switched between DTS and DD several times to see if there was any difference between the two. I prefered the DD mostly because it was louder than the DTS track. In the end, though, I just forced the audio to go through the analog outputs into my Denon 2801 and played it in 5 channel stereo. It sounded better to me than the other two, plus it was significantly louder. I guess my main qualm with this disc was that it just wasn't loud. I got little volume from my HT system, which, again IMHO, is very respectable (U2, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Metallica, Elton John, the Eagles...all their live DVDs sound incredible on it), and I mean...THIS IS GODSMACK!!! It's supposed to be loud. I'm not trying to persuade anyone not to get the disc because believe me, the performance is awesome, and any Godsmack fan will enjoy it. I just wanted to post my thoughts on the audio for people who haven't bought the disc yet.  Sorry to ramble on so long.",1010534400,3,1931,4.319559228650138
