1562212,5,B00005JNA7,"This show is nothing like the first commercials would lead one to believe.  I was expecting a smut filled trudge through the zoo but instead found it a delightful romp.  The animation is first rate.  The lions are a loving family and the animated Siegfried and Roy are just perfectly over the top.  They were, in my opinion, the funniest part of the show. The humor is gentle and the ""smut"" is not constant nor is it of the ""in your face"" variety.  It will very easily go over a lot of childrens heads.

  Personally I find it refreshing to be able to watch a show (animated or otherwise) that is not wall to wall violence and who's main aim is to just make everyone happy.

  I was pleased with the show and am looking forward to many, many more episodes!!!",1093996800,21,758,4.304964539007092

1562285,5,B00005JNA7,"An awesome show! Definately a must have for fans of Dreamworks and Siegfried and Roy. It's quirky, funny, and very adult. Don't buy this for children there are a lot of adult jokes in it. I remember this airing and missed it. I caught the last couple episodes and had to get this to find out what I missed. Has some good bonus features. I miss it, but I know it'll never come back and I'm okay with that.

1562289,5,B00005JNA7,"This all-too-short lived series was downright hilarious.  The humor ranged from subtle to slap-you-in-the face, and it was never cliche or run of the mill.  The characters were fun, even the bit parts.  I recommend it highly.",1385942400,,225,5.027027027027027
1562290,5,B00005JNA7,"An interesting attempt by DreamWorks Animation at making an animated comedy Aimed At Adults. Father of the Pride is a decidedly unexpected take on what one would expect from. a comedy about a family of White Lions. The Series has has a type of humor that at time makes you wonder how they got away with some of the jokes and situations that they did on network television. Father of The Pride Features a great voice cast, and the fictitious take on Real Life magicians Siegfried and Roy is a highlight of every episode. Of particular interest to collectors are the Un-aired pilot episodes. The series will appeal to adults that like the type of Humor found in the animated segments on Saturday Night Live's T.V. Fun House, or to adults that would like to see what an animated series about anthropomorphic Animals is like when IT IS NOT INTENDED for children.",1380672000,,858,4.651315789473684

My first purchase was a used copy and even though I bought it at ""like new"" condition, I couldn't view the entire 1st side of the disc and the second side was so scratched I couldn't watch a full episode.

1562366,5,B00005JNA7,"Father of the Pride was one of the funniest shows ever made. I recorded this show and watched it later on whenever I needed a laugh. I wasn't able to catch the last episode till the pussies (NBC) decided to take it off the air.
They couldn't find another network, like ABC, or Fox. You know, the awesome networks?
Anyway, I have their complete series now and I watch it just whenever... It never gets old!",1294617600,,405,4.342105263157895

1562369,5,B00005JNA7,"Much to my delight, I found this on DVD in the week after the Leno/Conan debacle, and only that programming disaster can make sense of this show's cancellation and put it into perspective.  If Fox had run this show, it would now be in its fifth season as one of the most highly rated shows on the air.  Unfortunately, though, its fate was left to the ""wizards"" at NBC.

This is easily the funniest animated show since the debut of the Simpsons, and the concept makes it even more clever.  It's not only brilliantly done, every episode is hilarious from start to finish.  The cancellation of this show should go down as one of the great losses/tragedies in the history of television.

Sadly, with only one incomplete season made, there is not much to collect here.  But the sparsity of episodes makes this lone cd even more essential to any TV comedy collection.  If you are a fan of The Simpsons or Family Guy, you should definitely have this in your library.",1264809600,,959,4.534883720930233

1562373,4,B00005JNA7,"My only complaint about this series is that the company obviously did not care enough to put in two DVD's insttead of just a really cheap double-sided DVD.  Overall, I think the series is quite good; who doesn't love animated, talking animals.  While I do know that there is the issue of censorship of the series, I do think that the implied is much more effective than the explicit in this case.  In much the same way arrested development was censored in order to make fun of censorship, so was Father of the Pride.  I would highly recommend this series if you love the cartoon medium but are tired of not having anything more ""adult"" to watch.",1238976000,,645,4.487179487179487
1562424,5,B00005JNA7,great short lived show...the humor is not for kids despite it being from dreamworks and a cgi show...shame it couldn't last...kudos to nbc for giving it an initial run to begin with....a must have for anyone who has an actual funny bone or 2....and the heavy weights they have as voice over talent is amazing....,1236902400,,312,4.6909090909090905

1562426,4,B00005JNA7,"It's a shame the series didn't last long, I found it amusing and entertaining. The CG is good and stories are somewhat of a luney toons nature which caters to children with adult inuendos.

1562427,3,B00005JNA7,"My husband and I watched this show when it was on NBC years ago and found it very funny.  So when I found it on Amazon, I thought it would be great to watch it with our children, who are fans of CGI animation and movies like Toy Story and Monsters Inc.  Unfortunately I had forgotten that the show was meant for adults.  We watched the first and 2nd episodes before we realized we couldn't keep up with hitting the mute button to silence the foul language.  The use of the bad language is completely unnecessary...the Lion father-in-law uses ""bastard"" way too many times for me to count.  It's a shame because this could be fun for the whole family, if the language could be cleaned up a bit.",1221350400,,692,4.333333333333333
1562428,5,B00005JNA7,"Created by Dreamworks SKG's Jeffrey Katzenberg and produced by Dreamworks Animation, NBC's ""Father of the Pride,"" at a cost of 1.6 million per episode was the first prime-time television show to feature film-quality CGI animation.

A smart and witty adult show disguised as typical family sitcom fare, Father of the Pride centered on a family of white lions owned by zany, CGI versions of ""Masters of the Impossible"" Siegfried & Roy (voiced by Julian Holloway and Dave Herman respectively).

In this hilarious spoof of the legendary duo, Siegfried & Roy are a pair of madcap performers who love their craft and their animals. So much so they've housed them in a community compound complete with modern conveniences fit for humans, which the animals behave like when Siegfried & Roy aren't present.

Sharp and edgy writing propel the episodes in this set which provide a humorous behind-the-scenes look at the off-stage antics of Siegfried & Roy (who typically make the scene to their own theme song, Michael Jackson's ""Mind is the Magic"") and the suburban life of performing white lions Larry (""Roseanne's"" John Goodman), Sarmoti (""The Dick Van Dyke Show's"" Carl Reiner), Kate (""Curb Your Enthusiasm's"" Cheryl Hines) and the other animals of the compound including Larry's best friend Snack the gopher (voice of ""Drumline's"" Orlando Jones).

Father of the Pride - The Complete Series features all 14 episodes from the series; 3 never-before-seen episodes including the original pilot; The Lost Tale; Commentaries; Anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) video; Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2.0 English audio; Spanish, French subtitles; and is closed captioned for the hearing impaired. Not to mention immaculate picture and sound.

Guest stars include: Christina Applegate, Danny DeVito, Kelsey Grammer, Lisa Kudrow, Wendie Malick, Garry Marshall, Eddie Murphy, Andy Richter and David Spade.",1216252800,,1875,5.385665529010239
1562429,5,B00005JNA7,"I was sitting at my home getting ready to watch a movie from DreamWorks when all of a sudden the ""Father of the Pride"" commercial comes up and it looked so funny I had to check it out. Soon, I order it on Netflix, I watched all of the episodes, and one word...obsesivness. I can't get over this show it is the best animated tv show I have seen when it came out in 2004. It is so funny my family can't stand it, its too funny, but not for the little kiddies. Every episode has a point and a moral and has a very funny conclusion at the end. You won't be dissapointed by it. I showed it to my friends and they love it themselves and they also couldn't get enough of it afterwards. The only things about it is it is very average and it is awkwardly animated and the voices in the show make the story feel kind of strange and more awkward without some key moments of music in it. Like John Goodman, check it out for yourselfs, but I love the gest voices in the show like Eddie Murphy, David Spade, and Lisa Kudrow very funny people. My all time favorite character is the oragotang named Roger who has self esteem issues and gets angered easily watch out for him in the episodes. Good stories and nice jokes that fit perfectlly, what more could you ask for. Buy this DVD if you are over thirteen and you are a fan of the Shrek movies and you love a good twisted and adult sense of humor. I couldn't get rid of this thing for weeks, when I finally had to give it up I immediatley wished for it for Christams and I am expecting it soon. DEFINATELLY buy this DVD you will not regret it. Trust me",1196121600,,1587,4.089743589743589
1562430,5,B00005JNA7,"This is a great parody or comedic portrayal of Siegfried and Roy. They did a wonderful job on this show, and good to see they can make fun of themselves. Too bad it only lasted a short time.",1189987200,,190,4.026315789473684
1562431,5,B00005JNA7,"This series is seriously funny.  I loved it when I had seen it on TV and was sad to hear when it was canceled in its first year.  With the exception of the original pilot, which is a bit mediocre as comedy goes, every episode delivers hilarity from start to finish.  The two problems with the DVD are:  1) there is no ""play all"" option, meaning you go back to the menu and have to hit play between every episode; and 2) This is the complete series.  After watching this disc, you will want more, sadly, those are all the episodes that were ever made.",1168300800,,550,4.2
1562432,4,B00005JNA7,"The product is excellent.  If you were a Father of the Pride fan when it was on for it's 2 seasons, you will like this dual sided DVD.  That would be the only part I don't like about it--Dual Sided.  I would rather have it on 2 DVDs.  Otherwise it is a great product.",1167264000,3,267,3.888888888888889
1562433,3,B00005JNA7,"I have to say that I fall between both camps on this one.

On one hand, the show isn't as funny or clever as it thinks it is and some of the gags and situations are just plain unfunny.

On the other (larger) hand, after initially saying 'ho-hum' after the first episode, I watched the next. And the next. Until I reached the end of the second disc. It has a 'more-ish' quality that is difficult to place.

By far the best thing in it are the characters of Seigfreid and Roy. Their strands are always the highlight of the show. This is not to say that the rest of the characters aren't great although like Family Guy before it, the show overly relies on the title character and some of the more minor characters, notably the children in the family, are under-developed. The voice cast are brilliant and the animation is very good for TV but obviously doesn't compare to Dreamworks' theatrical outings such as Shrek and Madagascar.

Ironically, the weakest episode is the one to feature a guest appearance by Donkey from 'Shrek' - a good example of high-concept, poor execution.

I suggest making up your own mind on this one which you will either love or loath. Whether it will stand the test of time as a classic example of one of the many adult animated shows that followed The Simpsons, we will have to wait and see. Only Family Guy seems to have got anywhere near that so far.",1148947200,2,1379,4.434782608695652
1562471,4,B00005JNA7,"At the cost of $1mil per episode, I suppose the series was an expensive exercise. I thought every episode was very funny, well executed and thoroughly entertaining. What a pity we won't be able to visit this crazy family again in the future. Once or twice a joke came across as forced, or somewhat crude in comparison to the general tone of the series, but these are minor problems. Well worth watching more than once.",1137628800,2,418,4.586666666666667
1562472,5,B00005JNA7,"This is probably the best modern animation series I have seen. I was a dedicated fan until the series was temporarily replaced with the ""Greatest Loser;"" SHAME! The characters and dialogues are hilarious, intelligently designed and organized! It beats the Simpson, Family Guy and many of today's TV sitcoms! Hopefully, DreamWorks will make more episodes, perphaps ones without the commercial break edits (episodes not designed for TV viewers).",1137283200,,443,5.529411764705882
1562473,5,B00005JNA7,"This is the best DVD I own so far. Not only is it my favorite show Father Of The Pride (which of course is my favorite A. because I love big cats, and this has the top 4 of them, leopards, jaguars, tigers and of course lions. B. because it is funny and well designed. And C. Because nearly all the characters are beautiful, especially the ones that are female)but it is also on a great DVD with every episode ever made and all kinds of cool stuff throughout all of them. It follows a family of lions with Siegfreid & Roy in Las Vegas, who when off the show have a lot of fun, err, misadventures! They do a lot of funny and enjyable stuff, but often get into a lot of arguments, with one another or with their two married tiger neighbors, who Sarmoti is constantly making fun of and therefore putting the lion family on the tiger's permanent list. Also, there is all sorts of voicework made well and this is just plain a work of gold. I should add a lot more happens in these episodes than just the stuff mentioned up there, but if I told you it would ruin the surprise of this 5 star DVD. Anyway, if you're an animal and/or computer animation lover, this is the DVD of the century for you. I recommend it to all. Rated TV-14 for language, some violence & suggestive content. I completed my review. I'm gonna enjoy this treasure DVD forever.",1136332800,4,1340,4.258823529411765

But overall, I would seriously recomened this show. Watchning Sigfried & Roy take a piss out of themselves is priceless; although the action centres around the animals Sigfried & Roy steel the show with their momentary interludes. Without a doubt this show is one of the funniest shows I have seen in a long time, I laughed more watching the 13 episodes than I have for other shows in their entire run. Not a lot of extras for this package but the shows themselves are more than enough with over 3 hours of episode viewing",1126224000,,690,4.440944881889764

1562479,1,B00005JNA7,"Like many of the reviewers of this product, I loved the show when I saw it on its brief network run. Very funny writing, great voicing, and terrific HD animation. (Although it should be noted that it is most definitely a program for adults, despite the ""cartoon"" format.) I liked it so well, that I couldn't wait for the series to be released on DVD. I am, however, disappointed with the DVD product.

When I popped open the case I was disappointed to see that there were no liner notes of any kind inside. The DVD itself is a two-sided disc, so it doesn't have any graphics or obvious identifying marks to tell you what it is. (If you have good eyes, you may be able to read the title of the DVD, written as it is in tiny font around the center hole.) And the DVD content itself has very few extras.

It's a great TV series that's very funny the first time, and will likely still be funny on repeated viewings. But given the low level of attention given to the packaging, it seems rather richly priced at current levels, and I have some buyer's remorse about value.",1123632000,14,1066,4.325

1562565,3,B00005JNA7,"This DVD is indeed edited.  In the episode ""What's Black and White and Depressed All Over?"" there's a quick fade right before the cat licks Larry.  This joke originally ran uncut on TV.  However, it's the only edit that I can find.  If there are other edits then they must be very small or non-existant.  It really wasn't a great joke anyway, so it's only a very minor complaint.

On the quality of the show:  The first few episodes are very hit-or-miss.  For every one joke that succeeds, two don't.  The later half of the season is much better, with the best episode being one that never even aired.

The DVD also contains an unfinished episode done in storyboards.  It's fairly good and makes me wish the show had gotten a second season which certainly would have been better than the first.  There are a few commentary tracks but it's just mainly the writers laughing at the jokes.  Not very informative, but entertaining.  There was a featurette about the making of the show on the official website, but it's nowhere to be found here.  The video and audio quality is excellent.  Three stars.

Excellent for children who watch television with their parents' guidance. Dodgy humor isn't dodgy when it's explained and understood that it's farcical. Children can learn the difference between fantasy and reality. Honest.

2) Victim of horrible timing (Roy's accident).

3) This is, at heart, a traditional sitcom. Dad-in-law moves in. Parents find drugs and assume they belong to teenager. PTA episode. Anniversary episode. They got most of the basics done in their first season.

4) The animation is astounding and the timing is pretty good. The off-the-wall stuff that wasn't on television before South Park broke ground is pretty damned funny. Again, though, refer to #1.

1562569,1,B00005JNA7,"How bad was Father of the Pride? NBC tried to distance itself from the show by telling these jokes at a recent press gathering:

""The programmer responsible for putting Father of the Pride on NBC last year has now completed rehab.""

""Roy Horn calls Father of the Pride the most painful experience of his life.""

While FotP was still polluting the airwaves, Cartoon Network offered this suggestion to FotP's writers: ""Try using comedy from 2004 instead of 1962.""

And they added that there was no way they'd consider giving the show a second chance (like they did with Family Guy).

In fact, the only laugh the show was good for can be found here:

[...]

I know a lot of people decided to check out this show because the characters were lions and other animals--but the sad fact is that they're really just typical network sitcom people disguised as animals. Emphasis on ""typical"". VERY typical. Oy, I was sick of characters like these years ago. Every aspect of this show is very tired, trite, and completely without any sense of humor or comic timing.

NBC at one time hyped the show for its computer-generated animation. Oh, boy, we should watch it for the technology. Sheesh. That's not a sufficient basis for a series, unless you are going to go all-out and dazzle people with what can be done on a computer. And they didn't.

At it's heart, good animation is about communication. In classic animation, you can tell a character's emotions, motives, and thoughts in an instant by the visuals: flying to pieces in excitement, turning beet red in embarrassment, or whatever. Have a look at master animator Bruno Bozzetto's online cartoons ([...] is one example)--some of these feature simple circles and rectangles as the characters, but they are still very funny, because Bozzetto still knows how to create characterizations and his writing and timing are top notch.

The people who made Father of the Pride don't understand any of that. They might as well have been moving rubber dolls around the screen. There is no humor, no characterization in any of the visuals. Each image seems to be about, ""Look! We can map hair all over their bodies!"" The characters of Siegfried and Roy were downright scary looking, I guess because they didn't have any hair to keep the designers interested. From an animation point of view, the show was painful.

I did not find the content of the show as repulsive as some newspaper reviews had reported it--maybe the prevalence of puerile sex humor on TV has jaded me. But I didn't see one thing good in it, either. I was frankly bored by the whole thing. I could name a half-dozen web comics whose creators can draw a more interesting anthro-animal character than any in Father of the Pride (and I was far more impressed with the pencil sketches shown during the ""making of"" short [after the premiere show on NBC] than in the computer-generated final results).

It's just a sad, sad show. In terms of comedy, the writing and timing are never better than third-rate, on the rare occasions that it gets that good.

And in terms of the point they kept harping on in the promos (""IT'S THE FIRST PRIME-TIME COMPUTER ANIMATED SERIES"") it fails to rise above amateurish. Dreck like this just adds to the pile of bandwagon-jumping product being thrown at us that makes me sick to death of anything bearing the label ""computer generated"".",1118620800,10,3364,4.759450171821306
1562570,5,B00005JNA7,"This show, mishandled badly by NBC and the victim of poor timing (a.k.a Roy Horn's near-fatal accident), was one of the most clever shows on network television in a long time.  I'm no big fan of DreamWorks Animation.  Their feature films, CG or traditional, don't have the repeat viewing appeal that the Disney and Pixar films do.  But on the small screen, they produced a highly entertaining and imaginative product.  The catnip episode is my personal favorite.  Buy or rent this DVD and enjoy.",1118275200,4,495,4.845238095238095

When it aired on Sky One I stumbled upon it by chance and was hooked immediately. The writing is spot and the nuances so subtle at times that I guess it just went over the heads of your typical Friends viewers, who have been force fed so called comedy so long that they don't ""get it"" when they have to think about the joke. The show is beautifully animated and the vocal talents on display are superb.

1562622,5,B00005JNA7,"Father of the pride is definately one of the greatest sitcoms invented. The show is set around the family of Segfried and Roy's lead lion. We see him (Larry) put into many situations we could only see in a sitcom. It shows much of the humor that make Dreamworks shows and films so popular, however often with more adult overtones. To quote Larry, ""Big Daddy's home and ready for lovin'. It might be 9 O'clock in New York, but here, it's mountin' time!""

The animation has to be some of the best ever to this day, and the writing is definately reccomended to anyone who wants a show with subtle satirical criticisms of society. A must have for anyone who loves sitcoms.",1118102400,8,668,4.475409836065574

And a bad review, especially one filled with cunning, witty, and snide remarks, can truly be more cliche than its subject.  Like The Simpsons and Family Guy, Father of the Pride was intelligent, adult comedy wrapped in the amusing facade of animation.  The cancellation of this series, though not unexpected, was truly the only sad thing about the series. The voices of Carl Reiner and John Goodman were animated beautifully, and even the Siegfried and Roy characters added more often than they detracted from the light hearted proceedings and situations.",1117929600,24,718,5.059322033898305

1562626,2,B00005JNA7,"I watched this show when it was on the air.  I don't honestly remember being highly impressed with it, just interested enough in it to keep watching every week.

Some have compared this to 'Family Guy' and 'Firefly' but to me there really is no comparison.  'Family Guy' i liked instantly, it was a can't miss after the first episode!  Honestly, 'Firefly' took me a bit longer to get into and I really only did right before it got cancelled.  But I was SURE after both of those series that I loved them.  This one I'm just not as enthused about it.

That's why I plan on giving this show another chance.  I missed some of the last episodes so I didn't see it all.  I plan on renting this when it comes out and reeducate myself on it.

Hey, if a show about nothing can run for four seasons and the Simpson's are now going for I think 15 or so, then masterpeices like Father of the Pride could run at least a few years.  I'm still hoping for a repeat of Family guy.  They took the show off the air and then made so much more money on the DVDs then they were expecting and brought it back.  We can only hope.

I loved the show and so did most of the folks who watched it. The show was very expensive to produce (1.5 million) per episode and the only reason it was canceled was because it was costing the network more then they had to spend on the show. Ratings weren't a factor.,1112140800,12,397,4.378378378378378
1562702,1,B00005JNA7,"I loved the review Cartoon Network gave this series, because it showed that other people also felt that the writing was at least 40 years behind the times. Their last words: You can forget about us giving you a second chance!

Everybody's jumping on the CG animation bandwagon without stopping to realize that it's the WRITING that makes Pixar's films so good, not the mere fact that they're CG. CG for CG's sake is not art--it's boring, ugly, and mind-numbing.

For all the money and time that was poured into Father of the Pride, the animation is still clunky. And the Siegfried and Roy characters are hideous. The writing is insanely bad, with stupid smutty lines thrown in to make it ""adult"". What a waste. This show deserves to go down in history right next to the widely-hated ""Joey"".

Instead of wasting plastic by putting this thing on DVD, they should release something comparatively good, like ""My Mother the Car"" or ""Turn-On"". (That's a joke, son.)

Is it me, or do most of the ""5-star"" reviews here read like they were written by people involved with making this show?",1111536000,8,1080,4.698412698412699

Thankfully I was proven that indeed it could!  I actually found myself really enjoying each new episode that was released week after week.  The comedy, while more adult in nature for the station, often had me rolling with laughter.  Some of the lines are definitely quotable for a laugh among friends and fans.  The guest voices that would appear were fun and fitting, as well as the random and strangeness of Seigfried and Roy.  Father of the Pride probably wasn't as perfect as some other OH so wonderful Reality TV shows that're out there these days, but it's definitely worth checking out now that it'll be on DVD.

Even though the ratings were low in its terrible time slot, rather than cancel FotP, why not try another night & time? It seems that unless it's so-called ""reality"" or violence, there's no place for clever, adult television. I still love ""The Simpsons"", but there were way more laughs in FotP then Simpsons have shown in a long time.  So another entertaining show goes the way of Family Guy, Futurama, Firefly, Enterprise...while pandering dreck is allowed to remain. (How many people really found the highly promoted ""Joey"" funny?

1562707,5,B00005JNA7,"""Father of the Pride"" is the latest victim of superb shows which have fallen to the evils of poor advertising and management, a la ""Family Guy"", ""Firefly"" and others.

People really didn't know what to expect with FOTP, and unfortunately the reviews showed that. The original fan base was not enough to pull the show out of the quagmire of politics it had found itself in, after having had some rather dubious advertising, a switch of the show's episode list (the TRUE first episode didn't run until sometime in December), and was placed at a very hard to keep 8pm slot, against favorites such as ""Fear Factor"", ""CSI"", and more. Then the show was put ""on hold"" after five episodes during November, which was a crucial ratings month, and three more episodes were aired one after the other on December 28th, and that was the last of the show.

There are some rumors that a DVD of the show is being created and is slotted for a November 2005 release, which I am eagerly awaiting. FOTP had too much going for it and was really one of the most overlooked shows of last year. I highly encourage anyone who is even remotely curious to support the DVD release for ""Father of the Pride"" and treat yourself to this unique and hilarious show.",1105920000,11,1231,4.54054054054054
