After an idiotic opening where some old family members butcher horse bandits in a prolonged scene, using rifles and cannon, we are introduced to the pathetic, ""MacGregors clan"".  Seems they need to take their horses to get sold, thus they go on their way but trouble finds them.

The horse bandits' chief, called ""Santiago"", plans revenge against them.  He's in cahoots with the local sheriff and he has a large army of bandits, whom I may say can't seem to shoot straight at all.

The seven MacGregor brothers invent a plan for their older brother to join the horse bandit group.  What follows is more inane scenes where none of the MacGregors get shot and yet they inflict great amount of damage to the horse bandits.

The film has the familiar air of Spain and her arid deserts, but not much in the way to recommend it.

Seven Guns for the MacGregors is a below average 1966 Italian spaghetti western that seems like it was made in 1974.",1449446400,,961,4.578947368421052
