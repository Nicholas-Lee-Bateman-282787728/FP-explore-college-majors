8625586,2,B00GOITWWO,"My son really liked The Perfect Game and when he wore out that movie, I thought this looked like a great purchase. The second movie, Home Run Showdown was NOT liked. My son did not like all the swearing, he was 7 at the time. The Perfect Game and The Home Run Showdown should not be put together because they are not the same rating. The second was actually not rated. I was disappointed that they were put together in a pack. The Perfect Game is a favorite movie in our house.",1469145600,3,477,4.195652173913044
