5735195,2,B00CQZVZYC,This movie needs help,1477180800,,21,4.5
5735196,3,B00CQZVZYC,not a bad movie,1476921600,,15,3.0
5735197,2,B00CQZVZYC,"Sorry, but, not good enough acting to actually watch the whole thing.",1476921600,,69,4.833333333333333
5735198,2,B00CQZVZYC,"Kind of a boring movie. The actors, none recognized, just sort of walked thru their parts. I didn't finish the movie because it really didn't flow smoothly.",1476662400,,156,4.814814814814815
5735199,3,B00CQZVZYC,Pretty cool movie,1475884800,,17,5.0
5735200,2,B00CQZVZYC,"More of a ""B"" Movie. The rating is the movie being identified as a ""B"" Movie",1475798400,,76,3.8125
5735201,1,B00CQZVZYC,truly awful,1475712000,,11,5.0
5735202,3,B00CQZVZYC,It was okay,1475712000,,11,3.0
5735203,3,B00CQZVZYC,"I watch all kinds of films. Good or bad. As someone interested in film I get a ""take away"" from every film I watch. There is a lot to learn here if you are an indie film maker. The two keys that will turn off the audience is the acting and the sound. Without those elements people will turn it off. I did watch it all the way through because I do that with any film. I believe casting was good for the most part however, there needed to be more time with these actors to light up these characters. Like the CI in the car... Great actor, but man he could have been a little more animated with proper direction and that would have sparked that scene. I love crime and drama. I have written a few. I gave this film a 3 star because God bless them. They got it done and out. There is so much involved in film making... You know what they say... everyone can shoot a film... not everyone can finish it. Cheers!",1475280000,,905,4.06145251396648
5735204,2,B00CQZVZYC,I did not like this movie. I felt the acting was forced and not believable. The movie appeared amateurish with actors sounding like they were reading their lines. The plot was predictable and the main character looked like he was smiling throughout. He did not have that tough guy persona which detracted from the movie being believable. There was much action and a few surprises but it was just a bad looking and sounding movie.,1475107200,,429,4.733333333333333
5735205,1,B00CQZVZYC,10 minutes is all I could take.,1474675200,,31,3.5714285714285716
5735206,3,B00CQZVZYC,I didn't watch all of it ,1474588800,,25,3.1666666666666665
5735207,1,B00CQZVZYC,Rolling stand to watch about 10 minutes of this one. Terrible acting would even give it a B rating,1474416000,,98,4.2105263157894735
5735208,1,B00CQZVZYC,"Bad acting , lousy script, crappy directing doesn't even rate as a horrible b- movie
And I can't get back the time I wasted watching this movie",1474243200,,143,4.333333333333333
5735209,5,B00CQZVZYC,loved it!,1473552000,,9,4.0
5735210,3,B00CQZVZYC,"A bit predictable, but still a decent story line.",1473033600,,49,4.555555555555555
5735211,1,B00CQZVZYC,Too much of a drag.,1473033600,,19,3.0
5735212,4,B00CQZVZYC,Enjoyed watching,1469923200,,16,7.5
5735213,1,B00CQZVZYC,only watched a little of it,1469491200,,27,3.6666666666666665
5735214,1,B00CQZVZYC,Very poorly made movie. I honestly turned it off maybe 15 minutes in as I couldn't bare to watch the rest of this silly movie.,1469491200,,126,4.08
5735215,1,B00CQZVZYC,Poor production,1469318400,,15,7.0
5735216,4,B00CQZVZYC,"This story has some serious action and some wicked twists I never saw coming. An eye for an eye can get you healed the quickest and its on display here, big time. The police work looks authentic and the acting is good. Production values are high. I would like to see a sequel which they set up at the end. Interesting dialogue and situations. Good flick. The rape scene (which always bothers me a lot) was not graphic and I could handle it, barely. Recommended.",1468972800,3,461,4.435294117647059
5735217,2,B00CQZVZYC,"A pretty decent, if not tired, story of revenge.  However, what really mars this movie is the crappy sound and mediocre acting.

Given a better cast, this would be pretty good.  The producer, writer and actor as well as executive producer and actor have a lot to learn about acting.  Just because one has the money to put together a film doesn't mean they need to be in it.",1468627200,,373,4.36231884057971

5735219,1,B00CQZVZYC,"I was unable to watch this movie without enabling DRM, which isn't happening.",1467763200,,77,5.0
5735220,1,B00CQZVZYC,"No, no, no, no, no. These 5 star reviews, seriously? OK, so this is a low budget independent, and there have been some absolutely great low budget independent films, but this is not one of them.

Acting: for the most part, stilted and wooden, I've seen better acting on the stage at local amateur dramatics productions, far better. Storyline: yes, nice twist at the end, but - talking of am-dram - played remarkably similarly to a stage play, with people standing around waving their arms and explaining, for our benefit in case we weren't keeping up, just what was going down. Editing: incredibly varied, at times quite acceptable, at others so slack you could drive a bus through the most un-lifelike pregnant pauses (yes, Mr Jimz, in real life people interrupt each other, all the time, just like in the movies. But not this one.) Music: some really, really strange choices. According to the credits, editing and score were down to the same person; maybe choose just one next time?

Please, Amazon, take this away, it's wasting precious lives.",1467590400,,1046,4.837988826815643
5735221,3,B00CQZVZYC,"Just when I believe it is getting better the screen is like an i-phone. The near ending twist was real good. It's a real shame the rest of the movie imagery was inconsistent, it had selfie video like on an i-phone.",1466553600,,214,4.2439024390243905
5735222,5,B00CQZVZYC,Great indie film. A lot better than the big budget Hollywood films!,1433376000,,67,4.666666666666667
5735223,5,B00CQZVZYC,Great independent film. A lot better than the big budget tired Hollywood films of today!,1433376000,,88,4.933333333333334

8585216,4,B00CQZVZYC,B movie. Too much loud music. Good plot with a great twisted ending! Recommended if you love cop movies.,1507507200,,104,4.526315789473684

Sucks!!!",1502409600,,25,5.5
8585218,1,B00CQZVZYC,"almost every failed actor and actress is in this movie, together with failed lieutenant, psychiatrist, bartender, bouncer, narco, computer geek, script writer, director, cinematographer,  etc. The only actress is the stripper.",1498608000,,226,6.290322580645161
8585219,1,B00CQZVZYC,"Bad sound, bad editing, worse graphics.  Right to left and left to right scene progressions gave me a headache, and the music amplified the mess.  It is unacceptable to produce something of this quality, when even modest improvements would have raised it to at least watchable.",1497657600,,277,5.0
8585220,3,B00CQZVZYC,"it seemed like it was made by cops ....it had a sort of authenticity... I think the lead was probably a cop at some time...
