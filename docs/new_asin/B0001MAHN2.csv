8014501,3,B0001MAHN2,"""Visions"" (a.k.a. ""Blind Sight"") is a hammy film starring Erik Estrada and Robert Vaughn that dares you to count all the subplots. A small smattering of said subplots (or in some cases mere plot distractions) include: FBI versus NSA versus LAPD jurisdictional disputes; quasi-electrocution (think of a hokier version of ""Frankenstein,"" though with much worse effects;) a divorced neurologist; a genius Vietnam veteran who lives in a highly specialized trailer; a secret electronic box; ESP assisted target practice at the pistol range; flashbacks to disparate images including an Apollo moon launch and a nuclear bomb blast (neither of which are in any way involved in the film, and are not linked to any character in any reasonably conceived storyline;) some truly stunning wallpaper that is evidently so ugly that it helps Estrada regain his vision; psychic landmine detection in Bosnia; and an amazing ability to decipher encrypted computer code without training. These are but some of the diverse plot elements I can recall off the top of my head.

The film opens with Los Angeles cop Franc Moreno (Erik Estrada) on a stakeout that quickly turns to gunplay. There's hilarious exposition, fisticuffs, and an amusing moment when Franc rolls across a car hood. Franc is paired up with a new cop, Chris Walters (James Romanovich, who proves to be the best actor present,) on a homicide investigation when Agent Silvestri (Robert Vaughn) shows up from the FBI (or possibly the NSA, it's all so terribly confusing, and I really didn't want to watch it again to resolve any lingering questions) for some jurisdictional brinksmanship that is tremendously boring. After bringing his old Vietnam buddy Murray Leever (Harvey Shain) in the fray for a quick consult, Franc gets zapped with 4,000 volts during a gunfight after an extremely unconventional piece of police work. I urge you to savor the hilarity of these digital effects.

Silvestri is clearly the antagonist here and is seen at NSA headquarters trying to engineer a grand government cover-up of some sort to make a project gone horribly awry go away. Franc meanwhile recovers from his near-electrocution in the hospital. There is much dialogue devoted to how Franc has ""trauma to the face"" and how he looks ""awful."" They should have clued the makeup artist in, as he looks fine, but when they remove the utterly ridiculous bandage he can't see, though he does get ESP. Apparently this requires numerous flashbacks to places Franc never was, filmed from vantage points that no human could possibly have. While Estrada makes Shatner at his most scenery-chewing look positively understated, he finds he is able to shoot people with his gun even behind closed doors. It's a useful skill as it turns out.

There is a terrible romantic/psychological element with Dr. Griffin (Laura McKenzie) who is divorced and invites Franc over to spend the night. Bonus icky-flirting points for the line ""You do have a nice voice"" which seems highly inappropriate in context (you'll just have to watch it if you want to know more.) Meanwhile, Franc envisions mysterious Dr. Vernikov (Yevgeny Janusz) on fire, and next thing you know the incendiary show is on exhibition. Turns out Vernikov helped psychics find landmines in Bosnia (don't ask) and the CIA is implicated for a whole array of Artificial Intelligence tawdriness. The film concludes as you would expect, with violence, ridiculous psychic destruction, a bad romantic tidbit you knew was ultimately unavoidable, and a stab at a twist ending courtesy of the NSA. Just trying to keep the government agencies straight is exhausting!

In all honesty ""Visions"" isn't unenjoyable to watch as a guilty pleasure. It has lots of scattershot plotpoint all over the place, yet sticks to an obvious formula. The acting is largely phoned in (McKenzie is particularly wooden in her role) and the script is neither particularly lucid nor believable. Estrada and Vaughn have both done better work before, while Romanovich does the best job overall here. While I spent a lot of time explaining faults with the film, let me explain why I gave the film three stars. As an artistic work or as a serious project, the movie wouldn't fare that well, but for people who like B-movies and watch them with the right mindset, it's a treasure trove of disjointed storytelling and silly plot developments. If you enjoy watching obscure movies that, well, just aren't that good, this has much to recommend it and can be a lot of fun when approached from the right direction.",1346630400,2,4540,5.041278295605859
8014502,5,B0001MAHN2,"I found this one day a few yrs. ago at my near by Walgreen's. I believe both the other reviewers did too. But unlike them I am very happy I did. I just watched it again today. Erik Estrada was wonderful in this forgotten tv polit. The rest of the supporting cast were also very good. I especially enjoyed seeing Robert Vaughn, best non to us baby boomers as Agent for UNCLE Napoleon Solo. he did a good job considering he was the badie.

I would have loved to have seen this polit made it to a full TV series.

If you haven't seen this little treasure. I say IGNORE the others above. This is a real find and a very entertaining DVD.

Buy this DVD. You will not be sorry.",1173830400,,670,4.099236641221374
8014503,1,B0001MAHN2,"So I am sitting here and thought went through my head. What is the worst commersial movie I've ever seen? And I think of this movie, I don't remember what it was called. But now I've found it! And it is this one, Visions.. This is the kind of movie you just can't not finnish, it is truly awful. So if you wan't to see everything a movie should not be then you can't spend two bucks more wisely!",1155081600,,395,4.012658227848101
8014504,1,B0001MAHN2,"A COP [ERIK ESTRADA] GOES BLIND SHORTLY AFTER GETTING ELECTRICUTED. BUT, THROUGH HIS MIND, HE CAN SEE VISIONS OF CERTAIN THINGS FROM THE PAST AND THINGS THAT'RE ABOUT TO HAPPEN. LOW-BUDGET PIECE OF CRAP BEST SUMS UP THIS MOVIE. HAS JUST ABOUT NOTHING TO HOLD ON TO THE VIEWER'S INTEREST. EVEN THE FEW SPECIAL EFFECTS THAT'RE SEEN IN THIS MOVIE AIN'T EVEN GOOD! LIKE THE OTHER REVIEWER, I FOUND THIS AT WALGREEN'S FOR A VERY LOW PRICE. THIS IS MY ADVICE TO EVERYBODY WHO'S THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS DVD BECAUSE OF ITS LOW PRICE: IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET A GOOD MOVIE FOR A BARGAIN PRICE, YOU'VE SERIOUSLY THOUGHT WRONG!!!!",1095638400,2,627,4.657657657657658
8014505,5,B0001MAHN2,"I bought this DVD at Wallgreens for like $2.00. What a deal! Lots of hillarious scenes with Estrada running around with his goofy partner. This movie is like a super low budget X-Files episode. Here are some of the highlights :
-Estrada tells his partner to eat a burrito.
-Estrada holds up an invisible police badge.
-Estrada has laser beams shoot out of his eyes.
-Estrada goes blind and beats the heck out of a tv dinner.
Oh yeah, this DVD has no audio. I had to hook up my computer speakers to my DVD player to hear it.",1084233600,2,523,4.292929292929293
