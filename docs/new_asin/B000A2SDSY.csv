The story begins with a herd of white-faced cattle in a valley in 1870. A thousand miles of cattle trails stretched from Texas ranges to the railroad yards of Abilene Kansas. The cowboys would get paid, they celebrated like sailors who came off a long voyage. One side of town had the saloons and places that catered to young men who wanted a good time. Shots are fired. The town has two rules for visiting cowboys: check your guns with the bartender, and don't cross Texas Street (the decent part of town). The saloons attract trail-hands, their cash makes the town prosperous. Settlers arrive in town. Homesteaders are not wanted by the cattlemen. A cowboy argues with a gambler, and loses again. The Town Supervisor appoints the Town Marshal to keep things peaceful as the dollars roll in.

Sheriff Bravo Tremble has a different attitude from the Marshal. Someone robbed the train? What can the Sheriff do? The Homesteaders are mostly from Ohio, they came for the government land. They will work the land and produce crops. [No comment on the economy and depression of that era.] The Sheriff visits a saloon, its owner worried about his future economy. A man shoots at the Marshal, then hides in the theater. We hear another song and see dancing girls. Rats in the basement? A long dull evening? The Marshal visits a rooming house for young women. Rita loves her life. Outside of town riders burn out a settler, and shoot a man. Then they attack the settler's camp. [Economic warfare?] Who wants to drive the settlers away? One of the riders was recognized: Jeff Younger. The Marshal visits the saloon, and is offered a job by Charlie.

Sheriff Bravo forms a posse to search for the killer. Three deputies left in the night; their heart wasn't in it. Marshal Mitchell has a clue, but the Sheriff is in command. ""We do it for the exercise."" Sheriff Bravo plays cards with a sod buster. ""Let's deal again."" The Town Marshal captures Jeff alive to bring him back to town. The Sheriff looks for votes! The people cheer his return. There is another song. Mitchell visits Rita. But Jeff escaped from jail with a gun. What will the Sheriff do? Marshall Dan ends it. Will Abilene ever change? [The construction of a railroad into Texas ended the long trail drives.] Shelly says Dan loves his job too much. [Power?] The homesteaders must organize to fight for their rights by fencing their lands with barbed wire.

Is it a crime to work hard for yourself? [No receipt?] The cattle stampede past the fences, and destroy what is in their way. Who sold the wire? Mr. Boulder does the math: 500 families will generate more sales than from cowboys. Marshal Dan closes the saloons. Charlie hesitates. Riker's gang arrives to break into the saloons. Shelly can handle a gun. ""I'm proud of you."" Sheriff Tremble will lead the men, who sing as they march. A wide open town? Marshal Dan tries to arrest Riker. The cowboys are told to ride out of town peaceably. The fight is over, the townspeople won.

This was adapted from the novel ""Trail Town"" by Ernest Haycox. It has songs, romance, action, comedy, and economic conflict. It is slightly less than first rate.",1394755200,,3173,4.689407540394973
