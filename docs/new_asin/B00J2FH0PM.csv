6315612,5,B00J2FH0PM,"They need to bring shows like this back to network television like they used to have! This is one of my favorite shows in the True Crime genre. Peter Thomas has to be one of the most excellent narrators I've ever heard. He, like Paul Winfield and Bill Kurtis, is an excellent storyteller. I also love this show because it is interesting how authorities catch these people. Forget dramatizations based on fiction like Criminal Minds, and NCIS! That's all Hollywood Bull! We need to bring shows like Forensic Files, American Justice, City Confidential, and others like these back to network television that tell true stories of crimes and how they were solved.",1480723200,2,658,4.883928571428571

6315683,5,B00J2FH0PM,"Well what else can you say but it's the best! I absolutely love the field of forensic science, and prefer actual cases with the real people involved instead of actors. I read books on forensics in my spare time just to gain more knowledge.
I've seen all the seasons and re-watch them again and again. Peter Thomas (R.I.P.) is definitely the ""voice"" of Forensic Files, and his narration is classic!

6315686,5,B00J2FH0PM,"Excellent show- Period!
There's a reason it's been on the air so long, err..many reasons actually, but two big ones: Peter Thomas (RIP) had such a calm & soothing voice, so it's a pleasure listening to him, even with the dark subject matter.  And the second reason, Paul Dowling insisted on sticking as close as possible, to the truth in his recreations.  Meaning, he found vehicles of the same make, model and color as the killers drove, and found actors who had an uncanny resemblance to the actual victims & killers.  There it is, imho, two short examples of why this show rules, and deff. set the bar.",1473984000,,605,4.583333333333333

6315712,5,B00J2FH0PM,"I realize this is sick, but I find Peter Thomas' voice very soothing even though he's talking about horrible things. The subject matter is very sad but it's presented in a way that while invoking empathy, I can put it on the tv anytime and binge watch it. Call me weird but it's my favorite program to put on while I'm cooking because the tone helps me concentrate. I know, I know! I've probably seen over 100 episodes but I wanted to see it from the beginning when I noticed it was on Amazon. I'm watching episode one, hey, that building looks familiar... A flight attendant? A woodchipper? I know this one because I live in the very next town! So that was shocking! Now I'm interested to see how many more took place around here.

Sooner or later, as science improves, as the persistent law enforcers move forward we will see resolutions for the victims and their families.  This is real.  These are actual crimes, that amaze me...someone would kill.  I have seen maybe fifty so far and there is no justification for what these criminals do.  However, they all think they have the right to take another's life.  This is an inside look that you can follow, step by step, how dedicated, talented, smart scientists, and investigators uncover the victim's story.  Also, what you need to do to protect yourself from the bad guys.  Some of them, you may already know...it's motive, means and opportunity.  The ""opportunity"" part you can stop.

6316034,4,B00J2FH0PM,"I've been enjoying watching some of these shows.  The recreation of the crime with stand ins is ok but the better part is the actual evidence which nails the killers. This type of evidence has a tremendous range but, as you'd expect, the big gun is a DNA match. I particularly like how some of these cases have laid dormant and only now the science is making it possible to prove who did it and convict that person. There are also cuts to detectives and pathologists to get their views on the case. If you are worried about a gruesome factor, there really is no blood and guts as part of the show. You are never shown the real crime scene or body. Although, I suppose that it is softened down to this extent, might hamper someone who is really trying to increase their skills. I'm a lawyer and I wouldn't mind being taken through some real life crime scenes, with blood spatter and everything. I doubt that will happen though. This has been made as palatable as possible to pull in the widest range of viewers.",1438905600,,1010,4.401069518716578

6316086,5,B00J2FH0PM,"""Forensic Fridays"" was the ad on the CourtTV network, when this series aired then. Mom and I both watched this series together, and I did so for my interests with police forensics (my dad was a CiD chief early in this field).

The field has really changed a lot since the early 80s, and what was the staple of a crime lab then (FISH TANKS!), now resembles more of a hospital lab these days. Hollyweird does hype certain aspects in the field for drama, as it's a job that really isn't glamor filled, it can be downright disgusting at times (e.g., all the odors, and I'm not talking about dead things either).

But the series is great to watch because it shows that crimes will be solved, sooner or later. If the tech doesn't exist now, samples saved will, in time, answer the unknown. Murderers will find justice, and families find peace in knowing. That is the ""feel good"" side of this line of work, the closure it brings to families, and knowing you are part of the process. Someone interested in seeking justice and answering the unknown, can be drawn into this field easily.

It's a great series to watch. It's not how it really unfolds (either for CiD nor medical forensics), but it's a gist of the process and how it's done.",1426032000,,1229,4.477678571428571

Forensic Files, for those that don't know, is probably one of the best shows on the market like this, and also one of the most well known and aired. I just wish the seasons on Amazon included more than just ""the best of"" because I could watch this show all day and only seven episodes in a season is really cutting it short.

8647383,5,B00J2FH0PM,Some of these types of shows are ALL reenactments but these aren't! In season 6 episode 19 the doctor who testified in court to help convict the suspect is really my hand surgeon! Dr. John Mcdonough has preformed 3 of the 6 hand surgeries I have had due to severe Rheumatoid Arthritis. He would have done the other 3 if he had not retired. These surgeries made it possible for me to keep working as an Oncology nurse until I was almost 70 years old when I retired. The Cincinnati Hand Surgery Specialists are the best and if not for them I would have to be on disability in my mid 40's.,1528243200,,586,4.241071428571429
8647384,4,B00J2FH0PM,"I love this show. I love forensics, especially when they bring in forensic anthropogists (at one point in time, that's what I wanted to do with my life). The show has some excellent science, and the narrator has a distinctive voice that makes it fun to guess what linguistic style he's actually using. The reenactments are clear without being ridiculous, and I enjoy seeing the scientists behind the scenes -they deserve just as much credit as the police, sometimes more due to the years of work experience they go through just to be able to attain that tiny clue that breaks the case open.

But I do have a couple of complaints. I know that this is an older show, but hair matching samples is no longer viable. Unless you're checking the chemical composition of a dye. It's frustrating to hear the use of a test that's been proven to be inaccurate. And there's one thing that made my blood boil; the repeated reference to Dungeons and Dragons being played by suspects. Seriously?! THAT'S what you're basing some of your psychological profile on? In particular, collection seven, episode 18, during which the police questioned two underage teenagers, get them to implicate one another, and then realize that they have the wrong people. The very next scene has someone saying that the teenagers wasted police time. That is inaccurate. The police were stupid enough to scare kids into confessing (probably telling them that they had violent tendencies due to the game) and didn't look for any more suspects. It's the cops that wasted time. I hate to burst your bubble, but the crimes where Dungeons and Dragons was a significant part of the psychological profile were more due to the person being unstable to begin with than them sitting at a table with their friends, rolling dice and imagining themselves as heroes. Because most Dungeons and Dragons players are the heroes in the story, saving people, solving puzzles, finding ways to work together, and defeating non-human foes. And it's a way for them to come together in a comfortable setting. To tell the truth, Dungeons and Dragons sessions are closer to getting together for a football game than any sort of violence-encouraging behaviors. Out of my old Dungeons and Dragons group, I'm a manager that works as a contractor for the U.S. government's civilian side. I make sure that my team helps elderly and disabled get all the help they need (within the law). Two more do similar work in the private sector. Another is an inspector for nuclear sites (yes, really). Another is a stay at home Dad, one is an Air Force officer, one was permanently disabled by an accident, another works as a preschool teacher, and the last that I've maintained contact with has his own pizza franchise. I don't see any murderous tendencies there.

My apologies for the rant, but I hope that if the show is resurrected in the future, there will be less bias based on a nerdy activity. It basically makes a group of millions of people look like they're evil or mental cases because they don't watch sports or go out to drink, people that would rather spend time with a smaller group and use their imaginations (and to be honest, half the time is spent goofing off and catching up with each other's lives). I note that there are no references to a suspect being a member of a gun club, or playing football on the weekend - both of which are far more violent activities. I have nothing against gun clubs (I'm actually a member of one, despite playing that nerdy game while I was growing up), or football, I'm just making a point.

Despite the unneccesary bias, I really do enjoy this show.",1527465600,,3623,4.720379146919432
