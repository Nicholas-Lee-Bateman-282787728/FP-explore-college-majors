8157122,3,B000FPDW5U,"This is an assortment of shorts created by the Southern California Stereo Club.  The quality of the 3-D ranges from terrible to quite good, depending on which clip you are viewing.  I am glad that I purchased it, but the title is misleading.  I was expecting a retrospecitve (clips) of known 3-D movies.  If you are a serious 3-D buff, go ahead and buy it.  It is, at the very least, really 3-D (not some bogus 2-D to 3-D conversion)",1176249600,,433,4.3625
