7026261,4,B00TZF2N60,"The miniseries was produced by the Korean Educational Broadcasting System (EBS) in 2014.  It was distributed by the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) in 2015.  The language track and subtitles are in English, mostly.  The miniseries seems similar to the most recent ""Cosmos"" TV series.  There are differences though, more live reenactments, more on location scenes, less virtual CGI sets, and it does not stray too far from physics.  As an educational resource it would be best used in secondary level science classes.",1430438400,8,517,5.2560975609756095
7026262,3,B00TZF2N60,"I watched the first episode about Einstein's special theory of relativity on Netflix. The episode had interesting information, but it dragged on and on and had too much empty footage. About 20 minutes of interesting footage was dragged out into 51 minutes of video. If you watch this on DVD I recommend increasing the play speed.",1455408000,,329,4.892857142857143
7026263,4,B00TZF2N60,"I'm very far from being knowledgeable about physics, and this video helped introduce to me some big ideas with some helpful visuals.  In addition, it taught me a great deal about history.  My problem was simply this:  I was distracted by the weirdness of the presentation - too slow at times, disjunctive sequences on topics, just plainly odd tempo (kinda like Elvis trying to be cool in modern day - oh, that's because it was made by Koreans, and that is exactly what this video set was trying to be).  I'd rather have it told to me in a straight fashion, than by someone trying to be all ""cool"" about it ... i.e. each session ends with a hard rock musical interlude (without even censoring the four-letter words of the lyrics).  Did I like it? It was entertaining for sure!",1453507200,3,775,4.507142857142857
7026264,2,B00TZF2N60,"This is a Korean production and surely a great deal is lost in the translation because a lot of this TV show makes no sense at all. While the subject matter and intentions appear excellent, there is just so much left unexplained, or incomprehensible, that there's almost nothing that can be learned. For instance: the leitmotif of a bizarre, other-world hotel seems totally out of place and inexplicable; a bunch of munchkins trying to buy their way out of a hut with different amounts of change; various insurmountable problems that are suddenly solved with no explanation. And a l,ot more. It's all very bizarre. And finally, there's this guy who's our host. He is never identified and he wears black plastic glasses frames with (very obviously) no lenses in them. But he looks good in clothing. This show is just too hard to decipher. I am certain more can be learned about quantum physics in waaayyyy less time by hitting Wikipedia.",1450483200,4,936,4.819875776397516
7026265,3,B00TZF2N60,"Production is good, excellent special effects. The science is helpfully presented in clear, simple terms. But in a few places there are some gross errors, e.g., S1E3 at 47:08 the English language narrator and subtitles report the speed of light as 310 kilometers per second -- shy to the tune of ten to the third.",1449532800,4,313,4.709090909090909
7026266,4,B00TZF2N60,"This is a good documentary.  The graphics and illustrative examples are well done and informative.  I also liked its focus on the process of scientific  discovery.  It could probably be a little more entertaining.

There is one amusing cultural gaffe in the beginning of episode 3.  They show a scene of Venice, complete with Mariachi music playing in the soundtrack.  That was hilarious.",1448841600,4,388,5.063492063492063
7026267,5,B00TZF2N60,"Excellent video explaining the process of replacing Aristotle with Einstein. Shows that science is done by men who gradually solve questions of their world. Uses reinactments of the scientists that dramatizes their work. Presents the puzzle that each one faced at that time. This creates human interest, not just dry physics. Easy to follow even for the more profound modern concepts.

Divided into six programs. The first is special relativity. Aristotle's earth centered system is explained. No feeling of movement. Therefore, we are not moving. Common sense. Galileo's development of relativity from the idea of a moving ship is very well done. This breakthrough in physics was required before the astronomical data for a moving earth could be processed. Many visual aids in grasping and explaining the ideas.

Next general relativity is covered. Starts with Newton and his work. Shows the original manuscript of the principa at the Royal Society. Says it is the most valuable scientific book ever written. Reinactment of Newton working out his idea of gravity. Facinating.

Explains that Maxwell's work on light contradicted Newton's theory of gravity. Now what? Scientific world stuck. Einstein suffers through nine years of misery fighting for the answer. Program travels to Bern where Einstein worked. Shows his house and office. Actor presents Einstein as a young man. Explains his conclusion that Gravity and acceleration are equal. Demonstrates why time slows down at high speeds. Easy to grasp. Best demonstration I have seen.

Third part starts with Galileo's telescope. Shows Galileo's effort to measure the speed of light.  Reinacts Newton's work on optics. He experiments using prisms, mirrors, etc. Shows the telescope, now at the Royal Society, that he invented. Writes famous book, ""Optics"" and begins science of light. Maxwell s shown at fourteen outdoing Decarte. Connects Faraday's work on magnets to Maxwell's work on light.

The section on quantum physics is difficult, but then, who says quantum physics is easy! Uses the ""thought experiment"" of the infinite hotel, Hilbert's famous example. Excellent presentation. I don't think I have seen any better.

This video is really intellectual history, not science class. (Similar to the video: ""Mystery of Matter: The Search for the Elements"")

I hope this company makes another video. Recommended.",1447286400,15,2368,5.3983739837398375
7026268,5,B00TZF2N60,Very enjoyable! I've watched it twice and will watch again. Especially the episode on the general theory of relativity. Some do not like the pace of the delivery. I thought the pace was right for the amount of information you need to absorb and relate to your current understanding of the subject matter. The only way you would not enjoy this is if you are already a theoretical physicist. There's a lot to think about here!,1444953600,10,424,4.592105263157895
7026269,1,B00TZF2N60,"Oh my god does this series make me want to stick a needle in my eye! The narrator is so monotone and the show is soooo slow moving! I just watched a section introducing Einstein's old office, which today has no connection to him. The show takes nearly a full minute of silence before pondering ""What would Einstein think today upon gazing into a mirror?""!

This series is mind numbingly slow!!!!",1444608000,13,395,4.563380281690141
7026270,5,B00TZF2N60,"This is a good enough documentary about a very tricky subject of light atomic and subatomic particles.

The fact is that atomic physics subject when limited to lectures and mathematical equations in a blackboard can be boring to death. Yet this five part series are well organized and interesting enough and although originally in Korean the English narration comes out load and clear, not to mention the special effects to illustrate a point which effectively hit the target.

Obviously there is a lot of work and money behind this documentary with live reenactments, on location scenes  and brief interviews with actual physicists.

You create your own reality says Seth. The subject of sub-atomic physics is actually, in my opinion, much ado about nothing. Quantum Physics has discovered particles are not actually tangible objects but tendencies and that they can also seem to appear as waves.

A few scientists in Austria claim to have performed an experiment that rules out a broad class of hidden-variables theories that focus on realism; proving that material reality does not exist when we are not observing it, either.",1443916800,3,1128,5.14207650273224
7026271,2,B00TZF2N60,"I got this DVD from the library. I wanted to like it. I liked the enigmatic brooding narrator who rarely spoke, the cool graphics, the good music, and the special effects. I especially liked the oft-repeated scene of the narrator winding up and throwing a glowing object, like some kind of ball lightning. The special effects are mostly to be commended.

The first really jarring note was when it said, in episode 3, that the speed of light is 300 km / sec. I listened twice. I'm sorry, it's 300,000 km / sec. Light is INCREDIBLY FAST. I don't think the DVD emphasized that enough.

I was ready to forgive that. But things got worse. I did not buy the portrayal of the leading scientists - Newton, Einstein, Heisenberg, etc. In each case, the famous scientist is mostly shown gazing into nothing for long periods, deep thoughts supposedly swirling through their heads. It seems pretty weak acting. In reality, Einstein and the others were frantic in their efforts, furtively working many hours.

Next, the DVD asserted that an accelerating rocket ship is the same as gravity. To the observer inside the rocket ship, it is not possible to distinguish the two. In both cases, the astronaut feels pushed down to the floor. But it is NOT the same. Gravity is an effect of mass. Mass is not causing the effect when the rocket ship accelerates.

For me, the worst part was the almost inevitable image of gravity as the sun, earth, and moon on a trampoline, indenting the surface. That's ridiculous. Even if space is curved by matter, it looks NOTHING like that. And the curving of space does not explain gravity, because it does not explain why the object would move. If I let go of a rock, it falls, something is ""pushing"" it or ""pulling"" it. The documentary acts like scientists understand gravity. They do not understand. What is actually going on is still a mystery.

The more I watched, the weaker the DVD seemed. There was a section about atomic electron energy levels that tried to put in some matrix math. It did not work, and the DVD even admitted that this was all way beyond the viewer, so why do it? I stopped watching at that point, I think in episode 5 of 6, because it seemed so pitiful.

The documentary seemed to mostly miss out on the controversy as to whether light is a particle or a wave. There was little or nothing about how the speed of light was measured, other than Galileo's attempt with lamps on two hills. I had not heard discussion of the red shift. There are many other interesting topics concerning light that were not covered, diffraction, lasers, more about how lenses work, more about colors. I doubt all that was cramming into the remaining parts I skipped, given the overall slow pace of the DVD.

Yes, the DVD has some good entertainment value, but eventually the superficial treatment overwhelmed that for me.",1443571200,16,2842,4.638170974155069
