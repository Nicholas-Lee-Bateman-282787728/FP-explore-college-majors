3920976,5,B002F80SWA,I love all the Morse mysteries. This is one of my favorite series. Love John Thaw in anything he does.,1355270400,,102,4.15
3920977,5,B002F80SWA,"I came to the Inspector Morse series by way of Inspector Lewis, and discovered that Kevin Whately (who is amazing as DI Lewis) also used to play DS Lewis in Inspector Morse. He is one of my favorite actors, and of course, John Thaw is one of my all-time favorite actors in investigative dramas. Thaw's Morse is compelling to watch - he loves listening to operatic music, enjoys his quality pint of ale, is easily smitten by a pretty face and intelligence, and is meticulous and astute in his deductive reasoning. All in all, Morse exemplifies the consummate detective, and most of the Morse episodes are of superior quality in terms of writing and acting.

Set Three contains three episodes:
Last Bus to Woodstock
In Last Bus to Woodstock, DCI Morse (John Thaw) and DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) investigate the mysterious death of a young girl, Sylvia Cain, who was working as a secretary at an insurance company. The investigation gets more complicated when Morse discovers that the deceased hitchhiked the night of her death; that her body was found by a young man who was actually waiting for her at a nearby pub that very night; and that an envelope addressed to another woman was found in Sylvia's possession, containing a letter written in code.

This is a well-plotted story with many fascinating clues and details that enable viewers to puzzle out the mystery alongside Morse and Lewis. With the help of an astute old woman who happened to be one of the last people to see Sylvia alive that night, Morse and Lewis piece together what happened to Sylvia Cain, with an incredibly amazing conclusion that is also altogether plausible. I am an ardent fan of the Insp. Morse series, where the stories convincingly portray the baser emotions that propel people to commit unimaginable acts against others.

Ghost in the Machine
Well, this episode really had me riveted. Some valuable erotic paintings belonging to the Hanbury family has gone missing from their stately home, presumably stolen. Then the discovery is made that Sir Julius Hanbury himself is missing, turning up dead in the family crypt. Morse and Lewis find themselves stumped by the case, as it appears Sir Julius may have killed himself, or is this really the case? Morse digs deeper, finding out some startling revelations about the lady of the manor who may be hiding some secrets.

The storyline was very intriguing and kept me engaged from beginning till end. There are many suspects, including a well-educated gardener/ chauffeur, a cute French au pair, and several others. The story also has an interesting development in terms of a new character in the form of Dr. Grayling Russell, the attractive new pathologist. All in all, a superior Morse episode.

Last Enemy
In Last Enemy, Insp. Morse (John Thaw) and DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) investigate the identity of a decapitated body found in a canal. Meanwhile, Morse gets called in to investigate the apparent disappearance of an Oxford don. The man who calls him in is an old college rival of Morse's who is now a Master at Oxford, and it becomes very apparent that Morse can barely stomach the man who is full of airs and graces and extremely arrogant.

As the story progresses, Morse and Lewis unravel a web of intrigue involving an attractive young graduate student; rivalry amongst the Oxford dons (a recurring theme in many Morse episodes); and even body parts on a kitchen chopping block! As customary in the Morse episodes, viewers get treated to a story centering on human compulsions, notably greed and ambition that lead to homicide. Highly recommended for fans of superior British crime procedurals.",1350777600,,3630,4.894308943089431
3920978,5,B002F80SWA,I'm working on acquiring the entire set eventually. I love the good working relationship between the inspector and his sergeant. John Thaw and Kevin Whately made a great team.,1348444800,,175,5.068965517241379
3920979,1,B002F80SWA,"There are no subtitles in sets 1,2 and 3. Who knows if later on they are included. The least they could do is to have them as every other English detective story provides them. My advice is you are having difficulty understanding some of the language or are hard of hearing skip these",1344124800,8,284,4.377358490566038
3920980,5,B002F80SWA,"I purchased all the Inspector Morse DVDs and have watched the episodes over and over again. I've never found a series I like better. Perhaps it's because the classically beautiful city of Oxford is not only the physical location for most of the stories. It's also an ideal intellectual setting for plots featuring characters engaged in the life of the mind.

The first time I heard Morse repeating the last verses of Tennyson's poem ""Ulysses"" to Chief Superintendent Strange--

""Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'
 We are not now that strength which in old days
 Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are....""

--I knew I was hooked on Morse for life.

In The Last Enemy, viewers see an example of intellectual jealousies as a motive for murder, rather than the sexual or financial jealousies more frequently portrayed in literature and film.

I'm glad PBS decided to produce the Inspector Lewis series with some of the same characters and aesthetics as Morse. While I've been happy to see Kevin Whately return in his role as Lewis, it's Detective Sergeant Hathaway who reminds me most of their predecessor, the intriguingly intelligent and brooding Morse.

If you enjoy Morse, Lewis, and Hathaway as I do, you might also be interested in a recently published novel by John Rather titled Arius, available at Amazon. It's an intelligent thriller that begins at the University of Oxford with a murder resulting from the response people have to a philosophical viewpoint that has remained controversial for centuries.",1338595200,17,1529,4.968627450980392
3920981,5,B002F80SWA,"This is Set Three of eleven ""Inspector Morse"" Sets. Each Set has three episodes/discs. Don't confuse these eleven ""Sets"" with the previously issued (but still available) ""Collection Sets"". Each of the six ""Collection Sets"" cost more, as each has more episodes/discs than these Sets.

This set has 3 episodes, in the same order as originally shown on TV. However, the 1st episode in this set was part of the original Series 2 (the English call them ""series"" instead of ""seasons""), airing in March 1988. The other two episodes were the beginning, in the same order, of Series 3, airing in January 1989. Not that it makes a difference to us now.
Episodes:
Last Bus to Woodstock
Ghost in the Machine
The Last Enemy

LAST BUS TO WOODSTOCK:
It's raining cats and dogs, late at night and dark. Sylvie Kane and a friend approach a bus stop. Sylvie asks an old woman, Mrs. Jarmon (played with zest by Fabia Drake), also waiting, ""Excuse me, when's the next bus to Woodstock?"" Sylvie decides to hitch, and gets into a red car. Her friend gets on the bus with Mrs. Jarmon.

When Morse meets Sylvie, later that night, she's dead in a pub parking lot. According to Max de Bryn, the pathologist, she has a broken neck, scratches on her face, and then, in a bit of overkill, she was run over. Not only that, she has a very odd letter in her purse. The next morning, a cheerful Morse brings Lewis up to speed: ""Coded messages. Murder. Right up my street. It's not a bad way to start the day!""

Trivia: This episode is written by Michael Wilcox, based on Colin Dexter's very first Inspector Morse novel, of the same name, published in 1975. Dexter's walk-on is when he's the man seated behind Morse at a university lecture by Dr. Crowther.

Morse's car in the original books was a classic Lancia. In the TV show, it's a 1960 Burgundy Jaguar MK III 2.4. The Jaguar proved so popular, that Dexter went back and revised new editions of his books to change the car to the Jaguar. In 2001, after the last Morse episode, the car was given away in a competition. In April, 2002, it sold at auction for 53,000 British pounds sterling, much more than similar cars had gone for. In November, 2005, it sold again for more than 100,000 pounds sterling.

GHOST IN THE MACHINE:
Deliberations ensue at an Oxford College to select a new Headmaster. It's down to two candidates. One, Sir Julius Hanbury, goes missing the next day, and his library was burgled, too. Lady Hanbury isn't worried about the burglary. All that was taken were some paintings she considers low-brow soft porn. Morse and Lewis are called in, however, because, as Morse grumbles to Lewis, ""The Chief Constable dines here once a month, which is why you and I are wasting a fine summer morning on a footling art theft. ... People like them, they think people like us are only here to keep the servants in order.""

For that matter, Lady Hanbury doesn't appear too worried about her missing husband. Throw in a French au pair and her boyfriend up-to-no-good, and the missing Lord turning up dead and battered in the family mausoleum, and Morse has plenty to sink his teeth into. Morse is, however, put off his stride when the pathologist who arrives for the body is a young lovely woman. It's Dr. Grayling Russell, and she doesn't appreciate condescension due to her sex.

Trivia: This episode was written by Julian Mitchell based on an idea by Colin Dexter. Dexter's walk-on is where he's drinking a pint in the Parker Pub. In ""The Story of Morse"", a 50 minute documentary special, Dexter said, ""I've had several very satisfactory roles, the most important of which have been sitting in a pub and drinking a beer!""

Also in ""The Story of Morse"", Patricia Hodge, who plays Lady Hanbury, says, ""I think my abiding memory was of trying to read this man who was very busy trying to read me.""

THE LAST ENEMY:
Morse and Lewis are called out to a canal, where a young couple found a body. Dr. Russell, the pathologist, tells Morse she can't tell him much about the victim, which disgusts him until he realizes it's because the body is missing its head, arms below the elbows, and legs below the knees.

On a supposedly totally different tack, Morse visits Sir Alex Reece, headmaster at Beaumont College, Oxford. Sir Alex (played with sinister smarminess by Barry Foster) is presuming on an old acquaintance with Morse. He wants to go on vacation, and no one can find Dr. David Kerridge, Vice-Headmaster, who was supposed to fill in for him. Morse isn't fond of the arrogant Sir Alex, and neither are we. Is Kerridge headless, laying in Dr. Russell's morgue? Could a Morse episode be that simple? And speaking of Dr. Russell, in this episode, Morse starts to warm up to her, even asking her out for a pint.

1 Corinthians 15: 20-28.  Death is the last enemy.

Trivia: This episode was written by Peter Buckman, loosely based on Colin Dexter's 6th Morse novel, titled ""The Riddle of the Third Mile"". Published in 1984, significant changes were made in the book's plot for the TV episode. Dexter's walk-on is where he is a man walking along the canal bank in the opening scene.",1337126400,9,5104,4.613009922822492
3920982,4,B002F80SWA,"The episodes in Set Three are an improvement after Set Two's leery, pretentious camera-work (filmed viewed through mirrors/reflections, or slanted, narrow hallways); Two lacked Oxford locales and camaraderie between Morse and Lewis. Set Three is better, with fine picture quality/resolution. The third mystery is by far the best, from here on, the series progresses in quality. Importantly, we are introduced to the fact that Morse (the fine actor John Thaw) is an Oxford man, who dropped out, for reasons hinted at in later episodes. Despite leaving college, he is highly respected by his ex-classmates. This complex aspect of Morse's character continues to deepen, explored in Set Four. Should you wish to immerse yourself more deeply in the Inspector Morse experience, I've found that his favorite ales (by Samuel Smith) add to the experience, fermented in ""stone Yorkshire squares."" Although Morse imbibes a great deal of Nut Brown Ale, Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is exceptional. If you're really fortunate, Samuel Smith's Yorkshire Stingo, aged for a year in oak barrels and matured in the bottle, is perfection.

Last Bus to Woodstock: Rain! What a shock to some of us living in the desert. Rain is as much a character in this series as Oxford University and Morse's luscious red Jaguar. People get lost in the rain, bribery and skulduggery ensue; Morse has a web to untangle. The path is strewn with young and old who lack wisdom, lurching towards goals they think they want.

Ghost in the Machine: Erotic paintings are described by one erudite associate of Morse's as lurid ""Victorian calendar art for eunuchs."" Great estates and marital woes, cast and class, are poked at by a temperamental Morse. The dialogue between Morse and Lewis explores the differences between their personal tastes and educations.

The Last Enemy: The best of the lot, with wide views of Oxford. Poor Morse has a toothache, while gruesome murder ensues, English-style. Is this due to a particular affinity for bizarre violence, or strict gun-laws? Legions of grateful fans don't object, they just want more. In this episode, intense rivalry for a prestigious university post brings out the worst ambitions. Meanwhile, Morse continues to resist pub-fare in favor of liquid refreshment, to the chagrin of Dr. Grayling Russell, a woman whom the lonely Morse is quite drawn to.",1323734400,26,2360,5.1566579634464755

I am not returning the tape because it played o.k. but I do resent the packaging and the many, and I mean, many scratches.
