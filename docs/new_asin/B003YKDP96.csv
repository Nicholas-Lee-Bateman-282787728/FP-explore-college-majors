8409507,4,B003YKDP96,"What's worth four stars with regard to this video are a number of deeply valuable sequences - scenes of the art school in Seville where Velazquez was educated, details of paintings photographed so closely that you see how intuitively he painted, an astonishing cameo of Francis Bacon, maybe worth buying it for the two minutes or so you see him, and museum views of the paintings where they really live, at the Prado. And odder stuff, the fact that his father-in-law, Francisco Pacheco, was the subject of ""The Water-Seller,""  as only one example.  ""Artsy-fartsy?""  Dead wrong, and the previous reviewer was definitely no artist.  Yes, maybe it's too short, with one probable historical inaccuracy I saw, but whatever  This is worth watching, and worth owning if you care about the artist.",1382918400,5,789,4.99236641221374
8409508,1,B003YKDP96,"This is a piece of pretentious junk. Badly written, very badly executed. Some of the paintings are not shown in their entirety, so you can get a total impression. In the end, you have no real idea of what--for instance--Las Meninas, Velazquez' most famour picture looks like. There is no real information about the painter. It's all very artsy-fartsy, ""how do we feeel about the paintings."" You'd do a lot better to throw your money out the window than to buy this DVD. Per Schelde",1291334400,6,481,4.670588235294118
