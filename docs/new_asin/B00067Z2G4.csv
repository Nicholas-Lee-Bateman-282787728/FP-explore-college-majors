8039917,3,B00067Z2G4,"This is a set of Scarecrow 1 & Scarecrow 2 tbat is why it gets only 3 stars. The first movie i saw when i was about 13 and i thought it was a bit corny but in it's own way it was unique. The story is simple,a kid who is a shadow nobody in town who's classmates and teachers mess with all the time & his mother is always drunk with another man. Well 1 night he snaps and teies to take on a drunken lover of his moms,he strangles him to death in a cornfield. So the kid comes back as a scarecrow who is on a killing spree taking out all who tormented him and the kills are tacky and fake but that is what you would expect for a straight to dvd release. The scarecrow gets somebody with a corncob to the head,the gore is nice but it is fake blood(obviously) and the girl he was sweet on eventually takes him out. Part 2 picks up with a story about the scarecrow and a bunch of college kids who claim to be marines(but are in training) and the scarecrow gets released by some power and is being hunted by these ""marines"" who think they got it under control til' they find out they can't kill something that is not alive nor dead. The acting is even worse in this movie than the first,the gore is worse and the only decent actor is Tony Todd(Candyman,Hatchet) who still isn't that amazing but he uses this power to turn into a scarecrow and there is a scarecrow showdown. The movie i cannot really remember because it does not really leave any memory of anything in youe head,it is easy to forget. I give it 3 stars because part 1 is 2 stars and part 2 comes with it so it's worth a star. No special features and just bare bones movies. The films are okay.",1427414400,,1651,4.067484662576687
8039918,5,B00067Z2G4,"You have to see it to believe it. This movie is on par with Troll 2, but with more action and more corn cob stabbings. I laughed so hard at the mother's boyfriends wig and fake mustache. Right now it's almost impossible to find anything relating to this film, but I'm sure it will become a cult classic in time.",1350000000,,311,4.2
8039919,3,B00067Z2G4,"Wow. I can honestly say, these are two movies... about killer scarecrows. Both are kinda bad, but both are worth watching. Why? High entertainment value and two very cute girls (though in the first film, it's the snotty best friend of the lead girl whom I found cute). But before I go into further detail, let me explain how I came by this double-sided, fullscreen(gag) double feature. Basically, I was in a drugstore one night and walked by their DVD bargain bin. Within it, I discovered a Leprechaun double feature, a Wishmaster double feature, and this Scarecrow double feature. Well, I knew I really liked the first two Lep films and the first two WishMaster films, so I had to get those. And since this was in there with them, it must be a fair bet that the Scarecrow films are good too, right? Of course, they were nothing like those other two pairings.

The first ""Scarecrow"" film, from 2002 (hard to believe that was nearly 10 years ago) and directed by Frenchman Emmanuel Itier, is nearly as low budget as a film gets. Okay, I've actually seen worse acting, but no one here is going to win any Oscars any time soon. At least, as I mentioned before, the snooty, blonde best friend of the lead female was very cute. The lead wasn't my type at all, but I'm sure others would really go for her. But I digress. In this case, it's how cheesy and cheapo the film is that makes it worth watching. The story is consistently interesting too, even though it's not overly complicated. There's this dorky highschooler who is always picked on by the other kids and gets a crush on the one girl who sticks up for him. After he sees his crush kissing another guy, he is more distraught than ever, and he happens to get murdered that same night under the glare of an old scarecrow. Spirit enters scarecrow, and you can figure the rest. Murderous, vengeful rampage. Unfortunately, the excitable director decided to make his killer funnier than Freddy Krueger, or to try anyway. He also does flips and stuff. It's pretty weird. A fair warning, some folks involved with this film are Troma veterans, so... that should give you an idea what to expect, and maybe that's a good thing for you or maybe not. Like I said, this one is entertaining if you can be entertained by cheesy B horror movies of the 21st century.

Scarecrow 2, from 2003 and directed by David Michael Latt, is actually called ""Scarecrow Slayer"" and is on the flipside of the disc. It's appropriate that the title is different, because this is a completely unrelated story apparently in the same world where if you get murdered under an unusually realistic looking scarecrow, your spirit goes into it and starts killing. This time, it's a frat initiation gone wrong. Less time is spent on a slow build-up to the death and transformation, so there isn't really enough character development for the guy who goes scarecrow. This one is more of a standard slasher sequel style film that focuses on the intended victims trying to avoid getting killed while simultaneously trying to stop the killer. It turns out to be the better film due to having Tony Todd in it for a while, a less talky scarecrow, and one of the most gorgeous females I've ever seen in the lead (Nicole Kingston). It's hard to say I find the second one more entertaining than the first, aside from the hotness of the lead, I probably don't. But, yeah, it's the better film. Still very B movie stuff though.

These two direct-to-video films each have a surprisingly good (and hot) behind the scenes featurette, and the first also has a very unentertaining outtakes reel. The trailers are included too. Not bad bonus features for films of this type. So, can I recommend picking up this double feature DVD set? If you like bad/cheap horror movies, you'll enjoy the first. If you like okay cheap horror movies and girls who look like The Little Mermaid if she had a cheerleader physique, you should definitely enjoy the second. I don't really regret picking it up. Then again, I got it REALLY cheap.",1294617600,,4015,4.620448179271708

8039921,2,B00067Z2G4,"There are B-grade horror movie fans who love mindless flicks about some kind of supernatural killer who won't stay dead. However, there is B-grade in the plus(+), and B-grade in the Minus(-) category. And all 3 of these Scarecrow movies are in the B Minus, Minus (B--) grading.

Part 1: Trying to kick off as a TEEN tale of a couple of kids sitting around the bong-fire telling ghost stories. One kid tells the tale of Lester Dwervick who is a high school student who is not well liked; just about all the kids pick on him except for one girl. He's a loner-geek type who's mommas a white-trash ho who brings home a drunken red-neck boyfriend one night who ends up killing Lester out in a corn field underneath a Scarecrow. The town is apparently ""EVIL"" and Lester finds his soul has been transformed into the Scarecrow and he can for fill his fantasies about getting revenge on all the people who hurt him. He ends up a cool looking Scarecrow killer, however, the flipping around like a ninja is a bit stupid, but not as stupid as the stupid comments he makes after every kill he does. It might be funny when Arnie does things like that ONCE a movie, but this one was over the top after a while and goes from humorous to just stupidly annoying. The end of the movie really is stupid, and the acting of walking away acting so cool about it is just ######.

1 and a half stars. Seen worse: ya might get a laugh out of how corny it is, but don't expect much more out of it.

Part 2: Scarecrow Slayer; fans of the CANDYMAN will be appalled by Ton Todd's performance as a nut ball who's parents we're killed 25 years ago by the Scarecrow. He wrote numbers of laughed at books about it and is in an interview that gets cut short 'cause he hears noises outside. He ends up accidentally killing a kid who was sent by his frat party to steal the Scarecrow as part of the initiation. He ends up putting that kids soul into the Scarecrow and he ends up mindlessly killing people. The plot continues on as his girlfriend escapes hospital after the Scarecrow kills off the guy who killed him, then they run around trying to escape, and having to go back and forth, blah blah blah, marine-trainees, blah blah blah, scarecrow vs scarecrow, blah blah blah..... ba zzzzzzzzzzzz.

2-stars: bad CGI effects, useless scenes, plots carrying on like it MEANS something to someone, over drawn, over acted. ""Slayer"" Huh? That would require someone hunting the scarecrow wouldn't it?

Part 3: Scarecrow gone wild; ya'd probably thing it meant the Scarecrows gone on vacation to the Mardi-gra or something, but nope; Again, as a fraternity pledge prank, they leave the diabetic kid in the field tied to a scarecrow. They don't know he's diabetic and acting like he wants to hit them cause of it, his soul ends up in the Scarecrow, but he's not dead. His best friend seeks out to help him. It does have a bit of an unsuspected ending, but doesn't mean it's any good. It rips off JASON: Goes to hell (Friday the 13th 9). Fans of ex-WWF wrestler Ken Shamrock might enjoy seeing him in this film as the coach... but he aint going to be making an acting name for himself anytime soon. (BTW: This is also one of those mindless movies where if they can throw in a woman wearing no top for no reason, they do it: So you kids under 14 who giggle and feel funny at the bra section of catologs will love it, but everyone else will roll there eyes)

OVERALL: Don't pay to see any of them unless you wanna watch it to purposely see how bad they are and have a laugh AT it. The scarecrow looks really cool in the first 2, however the 3rd looks like a bad rubber mask. But the whole thing they put him into is just stupid, first he talks, then he doesn't, then he's a demon and a person in one, then its a demon who copies there personalities...EUHH, make up your minds. These look more like student films then anything else. It's kinda hard to get into a horror movie when it looks like the midday movie, made for TV. Expect a 4th sequel sometime soon, if there not worth making, there guaranteed to go on. But I won't have any interest in watching it; if I'd not grabbed all 3 at the same time, I wouldn't have bothered to see the rest after part 1.",1146009600,3,4210,4.3430749682337995
8039922,3,B00067Z2G4,"These movies are kinda lame but when you're watching a couple movies called SCARECROW and SCARECROW SLAYER what do you expect...

but the first one was my favorite.. it had Danny Elfman's brother (who I forget his name) playing two different parts.. a cop and a redneck.. and has some amazing quotes.. that I've actually sampled and used in some music of mine!

The second one has TONY TODD and I'm ashamed for him... cause he was in one of the worst special effects death scenes in history.. I'd rather it been NO BUDGET FAKED HOME VIDEO DEATH  than what they did with his death.. damn..

but yeah SCARECROW is worth the money.. and I have yet to see part three but I'm sure it's just as bad!",1145577600,2,693,4.390625
8039923,5,B00067Z2G4,"Scarecrow and Scarecrow Slayer are both incredible movies for anyone who would be reading the review for a movie called scarecrow slayer. Not only are they both a gem they are both on the same disc, what else could you ask for??... maybe battling possesed scarecrow fighting in a lighting storm for the love of a moderately attractive farm girl.

The only thing better then Scarecrow 1 and 2 is scarecrow 3! Scarecrow Gone Wild, staring Ken Shamrock. If you see one of em you gotta see em all.
