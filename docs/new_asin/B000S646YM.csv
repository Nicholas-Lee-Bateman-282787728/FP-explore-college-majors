8204370,2,B000S646YM,Old and outdated and over priced. Recorded in 1993. Wish I had known before I ordered.,1452470400,,86,4.4375
8204371,1,B000S646YM,"This apparently was made back in the late 80's. It is so horribly outdated. They talk about demo's being sent on 1/4"" reel to reel tape, and that your better off going professional & modern by using cassette tape! LMAO!!!
I bet half the people on this thing are dead by now, its so dated....
One guy talks about keeping current and not listening to guys who are offering advice 20 years ago! Yet, they continue to sell this on DVD!
Really, this video may have been slightly relevant 20 years ago before the internet, and if you lived in New York at the time. They do insert a couple of audio overdubs that are about 5 minutes long trying to give some more current info, but it is so basic, you would get the same advice from watching a few free videos on You Tube....
No need to go on talking about how horribly outdated this is.
Even the video quality of this DVD is HORRENDOUS!  The sound is not even in sync with the video!! It's like watching a bad foreign movie with English dubbed in afterwards.
Even the cover picture of the DVD has nothing to do with whats on the DVD.

The one thing they try to get across on the WHOLE thing is make a demo tape and get an agent. That's pretty much it.
If I could give you one overall word to describe this production it would be: PAINFUL.....
Save your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1335398400,,1314,4.2730923694779115
8204372,1,B000S646YM,"I bought the digital version of this for sale on Amazon and had it sent to my Tivo to watch last night. This is about fifteen years old! They keep talking about making a demo TAPE. The format is TERRIBLE. Very boring. Too much time spent saying what they are going to tell you about instead of just going ahead and doing it. Too much time introducing the people who will be commenting. I'm new to learning about this field, but the information was clearly VASTLY out-of-date. After about twenty minutes of this madness, I just deleted it! It wasn't worth my time to watch the entire hour and thirty-three minutes. Save your money. Buy something else!",1239148800,5,650,4.564102564102564
8204373,1,B000S646YM,"My husband did TV commercials as a kid in the 1950s.  Since then he has sung for TV, radio, stage, etc., and has done narration, stage and film acting, commercials and other voice work.  He wants to get into voice overs full time, so we ordered this DVD.  It was a mistake.

The speakers stress quality in your demos and packaging, and professionalism in your behavior, yet the DVD itself is extremely poor quality, the speakers constantly stutter and say ""uh,"" and don't present the most professional images themselves.

Throughout this (brief) DVD, you hear about making your demo TAPE.  Every single speaker on the disc talks about demo TAPES.  Only at the end is there an ""update"" where someone mentions your demo DISC.  All of the speakers also refer only to New York City, leaving those of us in Los Angeles and other places out of the loop.

Yes, there is sound information on this DVD.  But it's so outdated, New York exclusive, and poorly made, neither my husband nor I trust it.  Don't bother -- there is plenty of other voice over information available!",1194480000,7,1064,4.666666666666667
