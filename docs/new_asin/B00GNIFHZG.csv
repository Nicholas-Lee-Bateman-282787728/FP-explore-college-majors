8625087,5,B00GNIFHZG,"The Laplace Transform is a mathematical tool that comes up all over the place in higher level math and engineering classes.  It is one of those things where if you do not get a good introduction in how to use it and what it is for, it is very hard to get a good grasp of.  Most of the time you see it as a part of a differential equations class.  However if you take the basic/introductory differential equations class you usually get one or two lectures (at most) on it, then are given a table of functions and their transforms.  Depending on how well your teacher explains it or how well you can follow the book you are left to figure it out.

Jason starts out with a very good introduction just explaining what it is, and what it is used for.  Then he begins by deriving some of the more basic transforms by actually doing the full blown integration.  After that he basically goes through how to use it and the inverse transforms to solve a bunch of problems.  He spends most of the DVD set going through solving differential equations using the transform.  He did that because they are problems that require using all the techniques are are not really specific to any one class or discipline.  Then he goes through how to apply it to things like piecewise functions and showing other uses besides solving differential equations.

Even though the set is not tied to any one particular class, it gives you a very good overview, and a much better explanation that you get in a lot of books.  When you get into higher level classes it will be something you are expected to be familiar with, and will a lot of times get glossed over in the chapter you need to use it in, or the details covered in an appendix in the back of the book which may or may not be easy to follow.

I own many of Jason's math, science and engineering DVD sets and I can tell you they have helped me immensely.  This is another one that is well worth the investment.",1388620800,9,1939,4.320441988950276
