8272995,4,B00199PP8I,"Movie is good, just don't expect an academy award movie. Some nudity. A couple women are completely nude and the other three or four are topless.",1431129600,,145,4.615384615384615
8272996,3,B00199PP8I,"Although this film is low budget, it is not too bad!  The story is decent, but not anything unique.  The sets and scenery are better than expected, the acting is decent.  Those sensitive to heavy amounts of gore or adult situations would be best to avoid this one.  But, if adult situations and heavy amounts of gore do not bother you, or if that is what you are indeed looking for; then, this one might be worth checking out.",1400976000,2,426,4.3544303797468356
8272997,1,B00199PP8I,"This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen, boring, stupid, no real plot and as my husband would say no ""good"" seens",1376956800,,122,3.92
8272998,3,B00199PP8I,"the insert in the dvd case has an essay written by the director of the film.  He talks about the making of the movie and other details.  He made this film for $3,000.  I liked the location shoot and the lighting of the film.

Given the budget, this was an effective horror movie.  It has several colorful characters.  The plot concerns a couple who go to a couples retreat cabin resort in a remote wooded area.  They plan to relax and reignite the romance in their relationship.  Instead, they stumble upon a haunted area whose spirit has come back from the dead to get revenge upon the inhabitants of the area.

* recommended for horror fans.",1289174400,6,643,4.474137931034483
8272999,4,B00199PP8I,I liked it enough. It's an independent film with some good moments. The title basically sums up the whole movie plot. Sex and murder at a pleasure based camp. The main girl i think had the best acting skills though everyone did a pleasent job. There's a lot of female nudity like always but i can't complain.,1280016000,8,308,4.421052631578948
8273000,3,B00199PP8I,"You can tell what they were trying to do in Blood and Sex Nightmare. It's a cheap looking film that tries hard but doesn't quite succeed. I believe the film was made while the director was in film school or had just graduated. Kudos to him for making the thing, but in the genre of modern extreme horror, it didn't quite do it for me. More like a renter than a buyer in my opinion.... sadly, it was not available on Netflix.",1242172800,3,424,4.182926829268292
8273001,5,B00199PP8I,This is a great indie film! For anyone who enjoys the exploitation genre! Don't listen to the naysayers!  See for yourself!!!,1236038400,4,125,4.9523809523809526
8273002,3,B00199PP8I,"Although this is a low, low budget effort with a lot of flaws, I'm giving it three stars for three reasons:  1) Truth-in-advertising - you get blood (lots) sex (some) and nightmares (the main character dreams about a serial killer on the loose); 2) the female lead (Julia Morizawa) does a pretty good job; 3) it shows what you can do with a paltry budget if you give it a good effort.  When a couple go to do an ""adult retreat"" (otherwise called a sex camp) to rekindle their relationship, they find that the creepy groundskeeper is going around murdering everyone.  Sure, it's a typical slasher-in-the-woods flick but at least they're adults getting slashed for having sex, not teenagers-as-usual. It also includes some oriental mysticism and a few surprises. So if you haven't seen every camp killer film, or you can't get enough of them, you may want to check this out.",1233100800,21,872,4.723684210526316
8273003,2,B00199PP8I,"This is the kind of movie you expect from a direct to video dvd. The characters are 1 dimensional and the plot has been done zillions of times before. There is enough nudity which can be expected as per the title. I actually bought this dvd because i am a tina kraus fan and she has a good 10 minute episode in the dvd but the plot and characters are stick figures to get slaughtered and that sums up the dvd,boring",1230422400,2,415,4.135802469135802
8273004,2,B00199PP8I,"I must admit that when I buy a movie like Blood and Sex Nightmare, I am mostly looking for some small time fun, maybe even a little tilltilation (the sex part, you know). This, for lack of a better term, movie, fail to offer either.
It is suposed to be an horror / mistery but the plot is so confouse and full of holes, that I doubt someone can find anything of interest there.
As a sexy/gore movie is extremely bland for modern standards.
The female protagonist is rather cute, but gives the impresion than she does not get the thin plot either, and more than frigten and confouse, she looks more anoyed and confouse. For example, she is informed by her husband than they will spare their free time in and ADULT  resort (heavily implicated to be a swinging resort), but is devastated when he spends a night when other woman. The male protagonist and the male antagonist are well caracterized but stiff in their acting.
The suposed resort looks extremely uninviting, not atmospheric,just old and dirty, too old and dirty for the represented midlee class couple.
There is a brief comic relief sketch (ending in the murder of the three comic caracters) that is amusing and have a very nice looking nude woman, but is to short to justified the rest of the movie.
My recomendation, do not buy this and try to avoid rent it, life is too short and there are a lot of better movies of the same style.",1229385600,6,1393,4.484251968503937
