8483353,4,B005QI4U70,"If you cant read Italian like me you will be disappointed to order this if you are looking for a cheaper Substitute to display for the USA over Priced OOP  ""Scooby Doo Where Are You Mystery Machine The complete Series"". THIS IS NOT THE SAME PRODUCT otherwise from Italy with an option for an English audio track.

What you really get is 8 individual Scooby MOVIES  in a scaled down mystery machine. The Mystery Machine you get is plastic with a flip up lid to store the 8 region 2 movies in a cardboard flipper book. The dvds really don't have much protection inside their own flipper book because its cardboard and they can get scratched simply taking them out to watch and putting them back But the plastic flip up lid is pretty sturdy.

Keep in mind this Van out of the box is smaller then the Newer release USA Complete series of Scooby Doo Who Are You that's an ArtBox  with a handle to slide out an other wise empty container that houses an Aymara case inside.

SO yes i was disappointed. Yes its only region 2 (but i knew this). I'm not letting that affect my rating because having 8 movies in a scaled down Mystery Machine is still pretty cool.

Movies included:
SCOOBY-DOO AND PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN
SCOOBY-DOO AND MYSTERIES OF THE EAST
SCOOBY-DOO AND THE Loch Ness monster
SCOOBY-DOO AND THE SCHOOL OF BRRRIVIDO
SCOOBY-DOO AND THE WEREWOLF
SCOOBY-DOO! ABRACADABRA-DOO
SCOOBY-DOO! FEAR THE SUMMER CAMP

It says SCOOBY-DOO AND THE LEGEND OF THE VAMPIRE is included but Amazon Italy is full of reviews that say its not. and my set has a bonus disk so since i have to wait for a viewing at my friends with his region 2 player i cant confirm.",1383523200,,1649,4.473333333333334
