7932956,5,B000057NX0,"I am big fan of Children of the Damned and Village of the Damned movies! how these aren't bigger cult films I don't know.
Even the remake in the 80's was pretty damn good. But I don't want to see a remake today with the crap Hollyweird makes!
I had heard of this but never saw it for sale until I found a copy on dvd by a collector. Macdonald Carey one of my favorite
actors is in it [check him out in episode of thriller 'devil's ticket] one of the best tv shows ever made! That one episode is better
than most horror devil type movies ever made. This movie is as good as the other Damned movies and just as scary. While on extended vacation Carey gets attacked by a gang and
while on the run discovers an isolated research lab with strange experiments going on.
If your a fan of british mysteries horror and the Damned movies you will like this movie.",1404604800,,853,4.175757575757576
7932957,4,B000057NX0,"Based on an original story by H.L. Lawrence, ""These Are the Damned"" is unique to sci-fi cult films in that it seems to have enjoyed a pretty good budget. Of course, Hammer Films are typically of superior quality for the period and genre as is this one.

This 1963 film is shot in letterbox, black-and-white, and runs for 95 minutes. It was directed by Joesph Losey who eventually became a target of the U.S. House Committee on Unamerican Activities (HUAC) which conducted an early 50s witch-hunt by ferreting out prospective Communists in the Hollywood Movie Industry. Losey thus subsequently changed his name to Joseph Walton for the purposes of film-making. The big star of the movie is MacDonald Carey whom you'll remember from his long-running role on the popular soap opera, ""Days of Our Lives"".

The story is about an American tourist (retired insurance executive) who comes to England where he is immediately beaten up and robbed by a gang of motorcycle thugs, the leader of which has an attractive sister. The tourist entices the girl to ""escape"" her life of shilling dupes for her brother and the gang follows him (he has a small yacht that runs the shoreline), seeking a violent revenge.

Meanwhile, there is a very bizarre experiment going on nearby with ""atomic children"" who have been kept underground in a secret government laboratory since birth and they have developed strange powers which begin to cause troubles for their tenders. The tourist gets involved in trying to help them escape but he doesn't really know what this secret government project is all about or what he's getting into. I cannot go beyond that point without generating a major spoiler.

The low point of the film is at the very beginning which launches with a cheesey saxaphone song called ""Black Leather,"" apparently a favorite tune of the gang because certain members sing it in whispery voices and they whistle it too! Other than that dubious nuance, this is yet another great old film from Hammer.

This one is worth watching if you enjoy Hammer Films, older sci-fi, or horror flicks.",1217289600,5,2076,4.886363636363637
7932958,5,B000057NX0,"We saw this the other night on Turner, which was presenting the full length version and in widescreen.  The film takes place in the 1960s, a society disrupted by deeply felt social changes that have mutated into an ""era of senseless violence,"" as Alexander Knox comments in reel one, shortly after visiting American yachtsman Macdonald Carey gets his butt stomped and kicked by a roving gang of ""teddy boys"" led by the young, scowling Oliver Reed.  Carey's wounds look absolutely real, striping across his face like the scourges left on Christ's body after his trial.

Into this grim scene Viveca Lindfors arrives like a breath of fresh camp, kittenish and channeling Simone Signoret as Frida Nielsen, a sculptor with an intense, ponderous vision.  (Indeed the film is the next best thing we have to a documentary of the work of the UK stone artists Elisabeth Frink who provided all the work we see in Nielsen's studio.  She's amazing, though not as pretty, perhaps, or exotic, as Viveca Lindfors and her fantastic 60s haircut, a modified bouffant teased up and out like a sprung dandelion pod.)  Frida is oddly enough the girlfriend of the man Alexander Knox is playing--a top secret scientist who's hiding something Frida's determined to get to the bottom of.  Or is she?  The way Lindfors plays her, she's languorous and nonchalant as the olive in a martini, except for the dramatic sequence in which one of the teddy boys tries to destroy one of her sculptures, a particularly riveting one that looks like a larva with wings and legs.  Then she goes ape, tossing herself on him and screaming how could he be so cruel.

In the meantime playboy Macdonald Carey has taken up with Joan, the sexy sister of Oliver Reed, played by Shirley Anne Field to perfection.  She's young, but in many ways she seems more mature than the middle-aged Lindfors, and at 20 she seems ready to settle down with 60 year old Macdonald Carey, who falls in love with her head over heels and, after a night of lovemaking in a deserted seaside cottage (actually unbeknownst to either of them the studio of Frink--I mean Lindfors) he offers to make an honest woman of her.  But both of them know it won't be easy due to Oliver Reed's incestuous attachment to Joan.  He can't let her go since she represents family and security to him, an unchanging ornament in a postwar world of continual change and degradation.

I can't even start in on the real plot of the movie, which involves Knox's secret project and a gang of small children who parallel Oliver Reed's gang of teenage louts.  My review would be miles too long.  All I can say right now is that, from the very first moments of the film, in which Reed's gang sings James Bernard's Elvis-style rock tune, ""Black Leather, Black Leather, Kill Kill Kill,"" I was hooked.  This is a movie for the ages, and so much more sophisticated than anything else I've ever seen by Losey.",1183766400,15,2903,4.683070866141732
