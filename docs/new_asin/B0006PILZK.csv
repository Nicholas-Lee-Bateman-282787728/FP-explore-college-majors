8042169,2,B0006PILZK,"At first I thought this was an okay collection of cartoons.  However, after I looked at the individual shorts, I am not so sure.  None of the shorts have the title sequence.  The menu does not have the titles of any of the shorts.  I think this is a big deficiency as you never really know what you are watching unless you have some background in Felix the Cat cartoons.  This is too bad as the films themselves look better than usually for an inexpensive collection.  It could have been better.",1328140800,,495,4.384615384615385
8042170,5,B0006PILZK,"The episodes in this collection segue with no titles or credits given, which is rather disconcerting, but the DVD makes up for it in the brilliance of some of the cartoons. There are episodes that show the art of animation at its most imaginative and finely drawn, and if you appreciate early cartooning, it's a worthy collection to get. Total running time is 60 minutes, and the prints are in fine condition considering their age.

Episode list:

1: ""Bold King Cole"" (1936). Directed by Burt Gillett for the Van Beuren Studios, with music by Winston Sharples.

An extremely odd and brilliantly drawn cartoon featuring Felix the Cat and Old King Cole. Felix is first seen in a tree singing with the birds, when the mood changes and in a big storm, he is struck by lightening, He finds refuge in the castle of Old King Cole, who to cover his fear of the night, starts to brag. The ghosts of the king's ancestors place old Cole in a diabolical wind machine, and is finally saved by Felix, who has new powers thanks to the lightening bolt.

2: ""Fright to the Finish"" (1954). Directed by Seymour Kneitel, animated by Al Eugster and William Pattengill for Famous Studios, with music by Winston Sharples.

It's Halloween, and Olive Oyl is reading ghost stories, when Popeye and Bluto decide to try to scare each other to see who wins Olive's affections.

3: ""Ants in the Plants"" (1940). Directed by Dave Fleischer, animated by Myron Waldman and George Moreno, for the Fleischer Stusios, with music by Sammy Timberg.

Exquisite artwork highlights this cartoon about warfare between a big anteater and an ant colony, and it also includes some nifty music, as the ants sing ""he's a menace, he's a brute, he will scoop you with his snoot.""

4: ""King for a Day"" (1940). Directed by Dave Fleischer, animated by Willard Bowsky and James Davis for the Fleischer Studios, music by Sammy Timberg.

Features Gaby in his first cartoon, having previously been the town crier in ""Gulliver's Travels"" (1939), and King Little.

Gaby delivers a letter to King Little, with some unexpected and dire results. As animation, this one is the least interesting of the collection.

5: ""Small Fry"" (1939). Directed by Dave Fleischer, animated by Willard Bowsky and Orestes Calpini for the Fleischer Studios, music by Sammy Timberg.

Features Tommy Cod in this deep-sea tale of a little fish trying to mix with the big boys. It has some magnificent animation in glowing colors, and the Hoagy Carmichael song ""Small Fry.""

6: ""I Don't Scare"" (1956). Directed by Isadore Sparber, animated by Tom Johnson and Frank Enders for Famous Studios, with music by Winston Sharples.

Popeye and Bluto vie for Olive Oyl's attention using Friday the 13th and other superstitions on each other. This one is starkly and very effectively drawn, with bright, flat colors.

7: ""Popeye the Sailor meets Ali Baba's Forty Thieves"" (1937). Directed by Dave Fleischer, animated by Willard Bowsky, George Germanetti, and Orestes Calpini for Fleischer Studios, with music by Sammy Timberg.

This classic two-reeler (17.25 minutes in length) was once thought to be ruined, but has been restored, and this is the best print I've seen of it, with crisp, bright colors. It is a terrific tale of Popeye, Olive Oyl and J. Wellington Wimpy getting stranded in the desert, finding their way to a town, and then meeting up with Abu Hassan (an Arabic version of Bluto) who captures Olive, and the chase/rescue follow. This has the voices of Jack Mercer as Popeye, and Mae Questal, who was also the main voice for Betty Boop, as Olive Oyl,",1120780800,5,3570,4.83743842364532
