3802704,5,B001UJUGZO,I have been a fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar since Buffy.  This movie is another great performance.  It is also strange to see the pie maker from Pushing Daisies as a bad person.  It was a thoroughly enjoyable movie.,1269388800,2,214,4.435897435897436

3802707,3,B001UJUGZO,"Aside from all of the negative press around this film for years, I was hoping SMG could pull off a nice separation from her previous similar work (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Return-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000M2E3H2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Return (Widescreen Edition)</a>, and coupled with the screen presence of Lee Pace (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fall-BD-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B001BPJJ82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fall (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>) - what could go wrong? Everything.

The story takes place in San Francisco as the perfect couple (SMG, Michael Landes) live in bliss, they are accompanied by his felon brother (Lee Pace) while life plods along. To add ""suspense"" the camera flashed violent images with overamped music at you during various scenes. Finally, the bad event happens on one of the worst CGI Golden Gate Bridges you will ever see, and the brothers' bodies, lives and souls are changed/switched. From there, the storytelling falls apart even worse. The performances are fine, so I feel one will not be disappointed if they are big fans of Pace or Gellar, but the whole production looks confused and unprofessional (if you are going to pretend to film on the GG, check to see how many lanes it is - it is 6 not 3; if you are going to try and show time passage by dates on cell phones - check the actual date as they goofed that; the significant writing gaps once the last 1/2 of the film gets re-shot; Vancouver does not look like San Francisco, etc.)

The BD quality is quite clear, except for the stock aerial footage of SF (looked 30 years old), the alternate camera in several sequences (a grid looking grain) and one or two interior shots. The DTS was overmixed in all of the sequences that tried to provoke a reaction, but it still sounded clear and the channels get a fair usage. The supplements showcase the confusion that ensued in filmmaking and the editing attempt:

* Featurette, 3:30 minutes. A long trailer of brief interviews and footage. Forgettable.
* Deleted and Alternate scenes, alternate ending, 35 minutes. The actual deleted scenes only total a few minutes, the remaining thirty minutes would actually be the last 1/3 of the film. Once they made the ridiculous choice of filming the ending they put in the movie, all of the footage pertaining to the ENTIRELY different outcome for every character originally, had to be removed. Personally, for all of the problems they had with this production and distribution they should have left the other ending in place as an alternate/selectable version (like they did with the Law Abiding Citizen BD set). Cannot explain any of it as it would give away too much either way, but this ending was better written and more ""shocking"".

English, Spanish subs, Region coded A only. Not to keep harping on this, but the cover art has nothing to do with the film - there are no ghosts, horror or other stuff like that. One star for the film, one for the BD specs and one for the supplements.",1267833600,7,3067,5.152610441767068

3802724,4,B001UJUGZO,"I originally purchased this movie because I am a fan of complex characters and plots, and I was intrigued by the topic of possession. I loved the way the story unfolded, and all of the actors are doing a brilliant job. The ending, however, seemed action-driven, painting a picture of the main characters that is purely black and white with no intermediate grays whatsoever, making this film ""okay"", but nothing really special.

The DVD's extras include an alternate ending which, much to my surprise, featured all the wonderful psychological twists and turns that, in my opinion, would've turned this movie into something really great. Here's the reason why (spoiler alert!):

As the story develops, Ryan, the romantic, loving husband, points out repeatedly that his previously convicted brother Roman had always been given ""a raw deal"", and deserved to be granted a chance. Roman's girlfriend points out more than once that ""change is choice"", and that everyone could change for the better, if they wanted to. Jess, Ryan's wife, resolves to be a ""better person"" if only she could have a second chance and get her husband back.
All of these statements are loose ends that get tied up in the alternate ending, but are completely ignored in the ending the directors and producers chose for this film. This movie is all about seizing second chances, the ability to change, and the readiness to accept the efforts made, but apparently the makers of this picture failed to see that.

My suggestion therefore is: Watch ""as is"" to see a halfway decent film. But switch to the alternate ending in order to see a great one.

My rating: 3 stars for the unchanged version, but 5 stars for the alternate ending.",1432425600,3,1699,4.868512110726644
3802725,5,B001UJUGZO,"I'm not a fan of South Korean dramas, they are usually based on ridiculous premises and overly melodramatic. I'm not a fan of romantic movies, they set up unrealistic standard for love. I'm not a fan of Buffy, no hard feelings there, just never watch it. However, I found myself enjoyed watching this movie tremendously. I'm indeed ""possessed"" by this movie, which compelled me to write this review.

The question of choice: I never watched the original so no comparisons there. But when I watched the two endings, I could understand why these two versions are so different. The original is about compromise, about living a lie is better than having nothing at all. The American remake is about living a lie is not true love, acknowledging the truth is much more important than losing it all. Jess has a choice, she chooses to confront the truth and face the music. It reminds me of ""Matrix"". Do you want to live in a fake fantasy or in the harsh reality? I am very intrigued by this question of choice and think that because of my Asian upbringing I might've chosen to compromise if I were in her position. If a man loves you so much that he turns away from his own self, how can you say that it's not true love? It's like getting your husband in a Lee Pace's body, who wouldn't want that???

Of course, from the movie making point of view, if there wasn't a big climatic fight scene at the end, American audience might've thought it was boring through and through. After all, the movie is more romantic than thrilling.

The Acting: Lee Pace was superb in the second half of the movie. Especially when he was confronted by Casey, the devilish smirk on his face when he uttered the sentence that he knew would confirm Casey's suspicion. Also in the alternative ending, when Roman no doubt knew Jess had found out, the conversation they had was obviously not about the crib that he was making, but about how to continue to live their lives. His eyes were so expressively begging and he had let out a relieved sigh, showing that he was truly changed and was afraid to lose his redemption if Jess rejected him. This now becomes much harder to continue to live like this because both of them knew the truth and knew the other one knew too. I also saw the director's brilliant arrangement by placing Lee on a stool so he had to look up to SMG, instead of the other way around which is usually the case because Lee is so tall. The angle changes their interaction, giving Jess the upper hand. Lee's acting in the death scene was truly great too. He earned my utmost sympathy when he ""dies"".

The cons: Lee wasn't too convincing as the bad boy Roman, he just seemed like a grumpy teenager that's lacking in character dimension. The movie also didn't spend too much time to explain how the brothers loved each other. They seemed to be too extremely. Well, I won't continue to pick apart the story since we all know it's silly. Too bad the movie studio went bankrupt before releasing this movie to the wider audience. Truly a gem.",1430697600,,3020,4.495446265938069
3802726,5,B001UJUGZO,"Great movie starring Sara Michelle, I swear she's never made a bad movie.  Don't be fooled, while this is one of the most suspenseful movies I have ever seen, it's not horror.

3802728,3,B001UJUGZO,"More a slow paced drama trying to be a thriller.  Acting was okay, Lee Pace did a pretty good threatening character Roman, but story felt stretched and lost any intensity as they tried to get it in thriller mode.  Not busy enough to maintain that mode.  The storylike has Jess (Sarah Michelle Geller) and Ryan (Michael Landes) at their first anniversary of a perfect marriage.  Ryan's evil brother Roman is on probation and uncomfortably staying with them.  In a freak car crash Ryan and Roman crash head on and both go to the hospital in a coma.  Eventually creepy Roman comes out of his coma and tells her he is actually Ryan trapped in Roman's body.  Is he really Ryan or is this just another of Roman's evil plans?  Not a bad storyline but it could have been done better and kept more intense.  Interesting escapism movie to fill time with.",1429315200,,844,4.5364238410596025

There is an alternate version on the DVD that is so much better than the one the studio went with. Lee Pace is so stunning in the role of bad boy/possessed individual Roman that I've forgotten the name of the actor who plays Geller's husband. Not the best movie, but it's a real shame when you see where it could have gone to become a great movie.",1392336000,3,480,4.285714285714286
3802738,3,B001UJUGZO,"First of all, say that this is not a film of terror, suspense thriller, or anything like that.
Do not be fooled by the cover.
It is a romantic drama and an identity crisis.
History is not especially original and is fairly predictable in its development,
but you can still be an enjoyable and entertaining history if you don't have too high expectations.
Very good sequences on the Golden Gate Bridge with that thick fog.
It is not a great film, but can be seen.",1389225600,,461,4.435294117647059
3802739,5,B001UJUGZO,"I've become something of a Sarah Michelle Gellar fan after discovering Buffy and I'm always looking for more of her movies. This one kind of reminds me of The Return which I also reviewed. The one thing I learned from watching this movie is that every time you think you know what is going on they throw a curve and twist in it. Briefly Sarah plays Jess and early in the movie Jess's husband and his brother are in a head on collision with each other. They both wind up in a coma and eventually one of them wakes up and that's when the fun begins, all is not as it seems. If you're in to movies that make you think and pay attention then you will like this one and I recommend it. One of the cool special features is an alternate ending that is worth a look too.",1377734400,9,762,4.086666666666667
3802740,2,B001UJUGZO,"First of all, the cover of the movie has nothing to do with the plot whatsoever.  Secondly, the movie was not as thrilling as I thought it would be.  The plot was not as strong as I hoped, and everything happened so fast which made the plot seemed even weaker.  It is really unfortunate because the movie has such a great cast but the story was disappointing. :(

In case you found this movie because you are a fan of Lee Pace, his performance in this movie was excellent; it is worth watching the movie just to see him perform a different kind of role.",1377129600,2,553,4.238095238095238
3802741,2,B001UJUGZO,"Take this movie back.  RePossess it.  I like Sara Michelle Gellar.  That's all.  Not that the movie is THAT bad.  but this storyline has been done and redone many times and it's not that frightening to begin with.  It was just plain dull.  But the real problem I have with it is the totally misleading DVD artwork.  You think you are getting a scary movie with some kind of entity or demon to be reckoned with when you see the ghostly face on the cover.  And it alludes to being like THE GRUDGE or THE RING saying that it's from the executive producer of these fright flicks.

But what you get is a little weak story of brothers, one good and one bad, who seem to swap spirits after a tragic accident that puts both into a coma.  The bad brother then takes the place of the good one who remains in his coma.  That's it.  You could write the story from there yourself.  While playing pinochle . . . Playing a banjo . . .

3802747,3,B001UJUGZO,"'Possession' was really diappointing because the movie is too short. They could have done so much with this to really keep you on the edge of your seat, keep you guessing, and could've made many twists and turns. It doesn't and it fails and falls short of what it could have been.

  The movie itself is about 2 brothers.. 1 good, 1 bad. The good one is Gellar's husband. One night there's a car accident and ironically, the accident is between the 2 brothers. They're both in the hospital, both in a coma. One comes out of the coma.. yes u guessed it, the bad one. However, he talks, acts and remembers things that only her husband would know. Is the brother actually her husband? Did their souls switch bodies? Or is it something more? That's the basic plot.

  Sounds good enough, but the problem is that the movie is so short that they cram all the answers in there way too quickly, leaving no time to try and fit puzzle pieces together or be surprised. They give everything away in a very short time. The movie itself is only a little over 80 minutes long. By the time the car accident happens and the one brother comes out of the coma.. they leave very little time left for all they could have put in there to really make this a really good suspensful movie.

3802754,4,B001UJUGZO,"There is so much right with Possession: Sarah Michelle Gellar is beautiful and affecting as Jess; Lee Pace is (psychologically) dark and sexy as Roman who might be Ryan, and Michael Landes is pitch-perfect as Jess's artistic, sensitive and loving husband, Ryan.  The premise of a woman confronted with the possibility that the spirit of her beloved, comatose husband might now be residing in the body of her dangerous brother-in-law is outright fascinating and could have been mined for so much more than it is, here.  I agree with those who said the alternate ending was better, but even there, Possession suffers from the fact that the directors couldn't decide if they were making a psychological horror film, a supernatural horror film, or a woman-in-danger thriller.  They got that they were making a romance, but apparently became confused as to whether Pace or Landes should be the true object of Gellar's affections.  Ignore the image on the DVD case which has more to do with the direction that the film should have taken than anything remotely related to the film as it was actually made (including deleted scenes and alternate endings). If you are a fan of any of the three actors, you'll want to see this film in which case you should definitely buy the DVD for the more emotionally satisfying alternate ending as the official ending manages to reassert the supernatural theme at the same time it leaves us in a logical and emotional limbo. If you are a fan of the original Korean film, Addicted, you will likely be disappointed in the westernization of a film with a very neat and unexpected twist at the end.  I give this a rating of four primarily for the three leads and the atmosphere and the potential.  Sadly, potential that is not quite realized.",1277424000,28,1766,4.792763157894737
3802755,5,B001UJUGZO,"Jess and her husband, Ryan, have it all.  A great marriage, a beautiful home, and she is a successful lawyer.  Life is good - until Ryan's prodigal brother, Roman, is jailed for assault and is now out on parole.  He has to stay with his brother and his wife during his probation period, but he and Ryan are like night and day.  Ryan loves his brother and wants to support him despite his violent background and bad attitude.  Roman is not beyond redemption, he just had a bad past relationship with his father and doesn't know how to deal with his anger and resentment.  Jess does not like Roman, he frightens her, and she wants him out of the house.  Ryan cannot throw his own brother out after all he's been through.  Roman overhears their argument one day regarding this and leaves on his own, his belongings in trash bags slung over his shoulder as Jess looks on.  She calls Ryan and tells him Roman has left the house.  Roman is not supposed to leave the state.  Ryan says he is going to return home immediately and as he is crossing the Golden Gate bridge, he is trying to call his brother Roman, unaware that Roman is on that very same bridge heading right toward him from the opposite direction.  The fog is thick, Roman is driving recklessly and as he passes a car, his own brother is in his path and they collide.  Moments later they are both laying on the road, unconcious and badly injured.  They are taken to the hospital and put in the same room together, still unconcious, their faces badly bruised, so much so that Jess cannot tell which man is her husband.

And therein lies the rub, as they say, in this suspenseful thriller starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Lee Pace, and Michael Landes.  It is a story about love, loss, loyalty, redemption, deception, second chances, and forgiveness.  This film goes a lot deeper into the human psyche than most thrillers normally do.  It asks, `Can love heal all past hurts?'  It also confronts the viewer with the question - `Can one become so lonely and wracked with grief over the loss of a loved one that your morality and all that you believe in can be disregarded in order to have the comfort of love once again?'

Lee Pace is heartbreakingly wonderful in the role of Roman and Sarah Michelle is very believable as the wife who is caught in the middle of the emotional relationship between the two brothers.  My only wish is that the directors and producers had the guts enough to use the alternative ending shown in the special features instead of the ending used in the actual film.  But I guess I can applaud them for even considering such a thought provoking alternative ending to this movie, because it certainly deserved it.  It leaves you wondering what you would do in Jess' place.  I recommend this mainly for Lee Pace's heartfelt performance.  Without his acting ability, it would have been a mediocre movie at best.  I highly recommend ""Possession"".",1276128000,33,2919,4.5761078998073215
3802756,4,B001UJUGZO,"First and foremost, the cover of the dvd does not tally at all with this film's theme. This is not a horror tale like ""The Grudge"" but rather, a psychological thriller with a romantic twist. It is nice to see Lee Pace in a different light, away from the ""Pushing Daisies"" persona. Sarah Michelle Gellar also did a tremendous job in this little known flick.
 The plot is good and it is rare to find a film which deals with this kind of story. Buy!",1275350400,18,446,4.247058823529412
3802757,3,B001UJUGZO,"Possession starring Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Michael Landes (Final Destination 2) and Lee Pace (Pushing Daisies) is the American remake of Korean director Young-hoon Park's 2007 movie ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Addicted-Special-Edition/dp/B000B6TT64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Addicted (Special Edition)</a>"".  And like most American remakes of Asian films, something got lost in the translation.

Originally I had no idea that this was built off of Addicted, I was more interested in the fact that SMG, Michael Landes and Lee Pace were all in a movie together--separately I love them, I couldn't see a problem with seeing them altogether.  Objectively speaking Possession isn't a horrible film.  The storyline is a good one, the acting is fair and atmosphere was there aplenty.  It falls apart with the narrative structure and pacing.

After the accident, when Roman(Pace) is convincing Jess(SMG) that he's her husband Ryan(Landes) Jess begins incredulous (and highly offended), but pretty quickly it seems as if Roman's superficial evidence is breaking down her defenses.  Grief certainly plays a part, but common sense seems to have fled completely.

Much is made of the difference between the ending that is attached to the movie and the alternate ending in the deleted scenes.  Was it a better ending?  I guess it depends on what you thought Jess believed.  The two endings are very different for all 3 characters, but neither really fit in my opinion.  In neither ending does it detail if what Roman/Ryan said was true (in regards to how she felt about Roman).  One is highly ambiguous and the other teases at the possibility that what he said was true and she was hiding it.  Also in one ending its more of a 'supernatural' twist then the other.

The movie as a whole isn't very supernatural, its definitely more of a psychological thriller, but there would be odd little flashes where it almost seems like they wanted to hint at there being something supernatural at work, but didn't take the time to properly expand upon it.

I wouldn't suggest seeing this movie if you enjoyed Addicted.  All the problems that Ring-u fans and Ju-on fans had in regards to the American remakes stands very true for this movie as well.  However if you are a fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar or Lee Pace, I'd encourage you to rent this movie.  Lee Pace is wonderful and Sarah is enjoyable to watch as well.",1273795200,6,2461,5.16919191919192
3802758,5,B001UJUGZO,"It is mysterious and intriguing. Jess' husband, Ryan and his ex-con brother, Roman are in a car accident. Roman wakes from his coma and claims to be Jess' husband, Ryan. It takes a lot of convincing on Roman's part, but Ryan's personality quirks are showing through and other hints of memory set up prior seem to indicate that Roman is now Ryan. When Jess begins to trust him and becomes pregnant, though, she starts having doubts. Roman had always liked Jess, and now his ex-girlfriend has gone missing. Does Roman have something to do with her disappearance? Then, Jess finds the broken chain of her necklace that Roman said he had repaired and a box of mementos that Roman could be passing off as Ryan's memories. The ending is okay, nothing spectacular. I like the alternate ending better.",1272153600,4,793,4.753623188405797

We both agreed that the alternate ending was far better than the ending on the final version.  The actors in this movie have done wonderful jobs in much better movies, so buy those and just rent this one.",1271894400,,365,4.041666666666667
