8749855,3,B01BCWGYHC,"Chasing Tyson should be a fascinating documentary about Evander Holyfield finally getting Mike Tyson in the ring in 1996.  A fight that should have taken place 5 years earlier in 1991 or 1992 but because of Mike Tysons rape conviction it delayed the mega fight for several years.  The fans wanted to see this when both fighters were undefeated.  Evander Holyfield is a great boxer but like Rocky Marciano, suffers from not having an abundance of great challengers during his career.  No one wants to see a boxer in his prime fight a bunch of has beens and never will bes.  Ali had Frazier, Foreman, Norton and all kinds of great challengers that is why so many people view him as the greatest, which is debatable.  Joe Louis had all kinds of classy legitimate contenders as well.  Evander really needed to fight Tyson to legitimize his own legacy.

Was Tyson scared or running from Evander who knows.  Did he really have a rib injury or was he just preoccupied with the rape conviction trial.  I always view the Tyson Holyfield fight as a missed opportunity of something we should have seen years earlier.  Like Pacquiao Mayweather a window of opportunity is only open for so long at the height of the publics imagination.  That fight was an eventual dud as well and should have happened 4 years earlier.

Looking back at some of the the big megafights such as Sugar Ray Leonard vs Marvin Hagler.  (Which I think Hagler threw that fight to be honest).  Leonard vs Duran 1 was a great fight and lived up to all the billing.  Ali Fraiser 1 incredible fight lived up to the billing.  Joe Louis vs Max Schmeling 1 biggest upset , Jack Johnson vs Jim Jeffries, and Dempsey vs Tunney.  Tyson vs Holyfield should have been one of the biggest mega fights of all time but comes off as just average.  This wasn't the same Mike Tyson feared and revered back in 1988.  Buster Douglas took off a bunch of the shine off Tyson by beating him in Japan also one of the biggest upsets in sports history.  Where is the Delorian with the flux capacitor when you need one, I would have bet the farm on that one.

But sadly this documentary just doesnt seem that special or interesting.  It should have had a lot more appeal.  Maybe because the fight itself turned out not to be as exciting or spectacular like everyone was expecting.  Tyson the brawler vs Holyfield the boxer obviously history tells us that the boxer usually wins if he can keep his distance and not go toe to toe like Billy Conn did with Joe Louis.  Holyfield for all his accomplishments will never get the notoriety or respect that Tyson received even after beating Tyson twice.  I would rate this a 3 star documentary.",1462406400,5,2667,4.536687631027253
