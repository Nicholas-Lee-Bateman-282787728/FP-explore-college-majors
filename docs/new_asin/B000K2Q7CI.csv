2681800,5,B000K2Q7CI,"Upon viewing Quinceaera, I can see why this small, made in three weeks, low budgeted ($250,000) film has garnered so many rave reviews.  It is a truly heart warming film that has a marvelous and realistic bi-lingual script (Spanish and English with subtitles for ths parts in Spanish) it is wonderfully directed and MOST OF ALL, it has a GREAT bunch of actors giving GREAT performances.  More importantly, for me, the movie gave me a cozy and warm feeling like one gets when one gets a comforting hug from a well thought of relative.

 Emily Rios, as Magdalena is so very good!  She at one moment is a very brash and sassy 15 year old Los Angeles teen eagerly awaiting the celebration--the Quinceaera.  The next minute she is strong and resilient when faced with some nasty realities that life can dish out to us all.  I fully expect Emily Rios to go on to be one of this country's greatest actresses.  She is really that good.  I adored Jesse Garcia, as her cousin Carlos--on the outside a heavily tattooed, willing to use his fists, pot-smoking thug but possessing a big heart that is capable of deep love for his elderly Uncle Tomas, capable of falling deeply in love and also capable of showing fierce family loyalties and willing to take on extreme responsibilities for his cousin after they all end up living under ""one roof"". I too expect great things in the acting department from Jesse. Chalo Gonzlez, as Uncle Tomas is also great as the person that loves his family members no matter what they are doing or have done.  In fact, everyone that appears in this film gives an outstanding performance.

I must add that the photography is great and the sound tract is fabulous ranging from Verdi's Aida to ""Hip Hop"" with loads of wonderful ""Salsa"" thrown in.

If you want to get a warm feeling from a film, buy this movie.",1172448000,14,1826,4.584615384615384
2681801,5,B000K2Q7CI,"A beautiful film with many layers that take awhile to see. I first saw the film on the big screen at a film festival, then saw the DVD on my home screen. There were so many nuances I missed the first time. I was reminded of the movie Real Women Have Curves, which I also enjoyed.

After living in New Mexico, with a strong Hispanic culture, I thought the film was realistic, capturing poignant moments as well as humor.

Don't miss the commentaries here -- one of the best Special Features I've heard in awhile. They actually talk about the film and its meaning, not just a bunch of in jokes nobody cares about. I love the part where they explain how they filmed the middle-aged women at the first party.

The dogs are great, too.",1172275200,6,730,4.352941176470588

2681803,5,B000K2Q7CI,"*Quinceanera* is a gem...at least, for me.  Like *Real Women Have Curves*, this film captured the true interactions and dialogues among Hispanic families.  It just made me miss home even more.

Magdalena is up next for her quinceanera.  She wants hers to be just like her cousin's who just recently had hers.  She wants a new dress and a rented Hummer limo.  The problem is her family's financial limitations and her preaching father.  She may just have to stick with her cousin's hand-me-down gown.

When she's being fitted for the gown, suspicion arises that Magdalena is pregnant.  When confirmed, her family is upset, especially her father.  Magdalena claims she's a virgin.  Her father believes that this is an impossibility and kicks her out of the house.

She only has one place to go...her Tio Tomas' house.  Tio Tomas is also housing another black sheep, her cousin Carlos.  Carlos has been banished from his family because he is gay.  Tio Tomas is that one person that everyone in the families and in the communities love.

From there, the film focuses on Magdalena and Carlos' personal coming-of-age journeys.  Magdalena addresses the whole pregnancy issue with her boyfriend.  Her boyfriend proclaims to love her but feels pressured by his family to succeed academically.  Carlos explores his sexuality with a gay couple who lives next to Tio Tomas.  Carlos falls for one of them, even though he puts on a tough act that he really doesn't care about anything.

Just when things seem like it'll be alright, something bad happens.  Well, not just one thing but several things.  However, Magdalena and Carlos come out alright.  The bond between them becomes stronger.

I just simply love *Quinceanera* for showing the interactions between family members.  I just love how one aunt turned to her sisters and hissed ""fourteen years old!"" when Magdalena is suspected to be pregnant.  I was like...my mother and my aunts would so do that and have done that as well.

There are many aspects of the film that I loved.  The pressure and encouragment for Hispanic children to succeed academically to pursue and live that American dream.  The dialogues between adults and children, alternating in Spanish and English.  The assimilation of American things in Hispanic rituals.  The diversity of religious beliefs instead of just showing that everyone is Catholic.

Lastly, it was wonderful to include a gay Hispanic character.  It is very rare to see like this.  I love that fact that the directors didn't pick one that is stereotypically effeminate and is into dragging.  They picked someone thuggish and macho.  It was just...perfect!

The photography and sceneries here are just authentic.  Just sit back, relax and enjoy the film.  You are seeing the real thing of the Hispanic world.

Simply, it was a gem of a film.",1170201600,5,2820,4.965665236051502
2681804,5,B000K2Q7CI,"'Quincea&ntilde;era' is a little miracle of a film.  Written and directed by the sensitive team of Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland ('The Fluffer', 'Grief') this independent film garnered many awards at the Sundance Festival and rightly so. For the first time a film about the Latino community in Los Angeles is presented without the usual onerous stereotypes  but instead with all the idiosyncrasies of a culture within a culture that respects place, time, extended family, the individual choices that demand courage, and the wondrously warm festivities and traditions that make this part of Los Angeles milieu so unique and special.

Made on a budget of around $250,000. with the money being raised by producers who solely believed in an idea (no script was ready at the time of solicitation of support) presented Glatzer and Westmoreland who lived in the Echo Park area of downtown LA and had witnessed the traditional coming of age at 15 with the special presentation to society of girls becoming women called Quincea&ntilde;era: they felt a story was there. Gathering a cast of both known and unknown actors who felt as committed to the concept as the production team, Glatzer and Westmoreland wrote the script as the film progressed, using extemporaneous lines from the cast on set as part of the atmosphere.  The end product is a loving, unpretentious, realistic story rendered without the slightest trace of treacle or overindulgence in histrionics or false sentimentality.

Magdalena (a strong Emily Rios) is 14, awaiting her quincea&ntilde;era, knowing that her family cannot afford the extravagance of the event in which she has just been a participant.  Her father is a preacher and will not consider spending money for a new dress or a limo for her party and while her mother supports Magdalena's wants, she succumbs to the realities of the finances of the family.  Magdalena has a young boyfriend Herman (J.R. Cruz) and though they are careful with intimacy, Magdalena becomes pregnant without penetration.  When her family discovers her pregnancy, no one will believe she is still in fact a virgin and she is castigated by her father (Jesus Castanos) and thrown from her home.  Herman loves her but obeys his mother's wishes that he complete school and he leaves Echo Park, deserting Magdalena.  Magdalena finds solace with her great granduncle Tio Tomas Alvarez (a brilliant Chalo Gonz&aacute;lez) who lives in back of a property in a home filled with love, memories, kindness, and tradition.  He has also taken in the young pseudo-gansta Carlos (an impressively strong and hunky Jesse Garcia) who discovers he is gay when he comes out with the gay couple (David Ross and Jason L. Wood) who own the property in front of Tio's little place.

Gradually Magdalena and Carlos bond under the influence of their Tio Tomas, learning the important life lessons of family and self respect, healing from the injuries that are similar to the disappointments of Tio Tomas' past.  It is the manner in which these three become a strong extended family, mutually supportive, that is the strength of the story, and when Tio Tomas suffers yet another disappointment in his life, he at age 81 dies quietly, leaving Magdalena and Carlos the richer for their time with him.

The supporting cast, drawn from professional actors, local theater and from the people of Echo Park, is uniformly strong and presents an unfettered sense of realism to the film.  There are many exemplary moments: Magdalena and her father argue over her pregnancy in a bilingual fashion - the father screams in Spanish and Magdalena screams back in English, a finely integrated demonstration of the crossing of language and culture so well presented in the film; Carlos' eulogy at Tio Tomas' funeral is one of the more powerful monologues on film and is superbly delivered by the very talented Jesse Garcia; finally a look at the gay Spanish population so taboo in other films, again due to the fine acting of Garcia with Ross and Wood; and the preparations and executions of the actual quincea&ntilde;eras are true to life.  This is a film of love on the part of  everyone involved and it is powerful in its simple realism.  Highly recommended for everyone.  Grady Harp, January 07",1168732800,23,4257,5.012765957446809
2681805,5,B000K2Q7CI,"I Found out about this movie, Then waited and waited, and then some more waiting. it never came out anywhere near me. So I was left to wait.. For the dvd release. yesterday at long last I rented it, sat myself down and got ready to love it. I did. Quinceanera was everything I hoped for and more.

Believable,genuine and full to the top with heart.

Emily Rios as spirited determined Magdalena is refreshing and real.

Jesse Garcia is intense and amazing as Carlos, I mean it, you can't take  your eyes off this guy.

Chalo Gonzalez is endearing perfection as Tio Tomas, You want him in your family.

For the most part the rest of the cast is great, and the few exceptions,and little problems within the movie don't hurt the film as a whole.

one like this is rare, see this movie.",1168473600,5,781,4.381944444444445
2681806,4,B000K2Q7CI,"At the end of my review of Director/Writers Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland's first nationally distributed film, I wondered aloud as to what these talented, quirky guys would do after the fun, I only steal from the very best movies take on the Gay Porn Industry and the hangers-on that populate it,""The Fluffer."" Well now I know: it's the very human, thoughtful and real ""Quinceanera.""

Shot in a section of Los Angeles just 10 minutes from where I live yet on many levels worlds apart socially and ethnically, and reeling and rocking from the mixture of Mexican-Americans, who have lived there for many years and the Upscale Interlopers in the form of Non/Mexican Americans who go to Echo Park looking for homes that they can afford now that the Westside of Los Angeles is way beyond most peoples means. Glazer/Westmoreland's take on this Cultural and Monetary disparity is to step back, aim the camera and refuse to take sides: both the Inhabitants and the Interlopers are examined carefully and without judgment.

The central story involves the impending Quinceanera (a sort of Bat Mitzvah) of Magdalena (a strong, fiery Emily Rios), her ""miracle"" pregnancy and Carlos (an angry, intelligent Jesse Garcia) who happens to be Gay which does not sit well with his father who promptly ejects Carlos from his home: both Mag and Carlos find acceptance and Love with their Great Uncle Tomas...the emotional center of his family and of this film, Chalo Gonzalez.

""Quinceanera"" is not a perfect film: the flaccid editing hurts the last third of the film but despite this, few  film scenes have as much emotional power and pack such a wallop as Carlos's ( and therefore, of course, Jesse Garcia's) eulogy at Tomas' grave-site, in front of a family that mostly despises him because he is Gay: it is on the one hand brave and on the other as heartbreaking and emotionally open and naked a scene as any committed to film in a long, long time.",1155600000,17,1939,4.831325301204819
2681807,4,B000K2Q7CI,"Magdalena (Emily Rios), a young girl living with her family in Echo Park, a predominantly Hispanic area of Los Angeles, attends her cousin's fifteenth birthday, her Quinceanera, and she dreams of having an equally elaborate affair to celebrate her birthday in a few months. Flirting with her boyfriend, Herman, she kisses and hugs him, but doesn't go all the way. Her aunt offers to let her wear her cousin's dress because her family really can't afford an elaborate affair. She also offers to alter the dress for Magdalena. During the fitting, the fourteen year old realizes she is gaining weight. Soon, it becomes apparent she is pregnant. But her father, a preacher and part time security guard, doesn't believe she has never had sex and she leaves the home. Her great uncle Tomas (Chalo Gonzalez) takes her in and she becomes a part of the extended household which already includes her other cousin, Carlos (Jesse Garcia), a drift less young man who works at the local car wash, spends afternoons smoking pot, and was thrown out of his house for being gay.

""Quinceanera"", written and directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland, is a very good, very moving independent film which won the Grand Jury prize and the Audience award at the last Sundance Film Festival. You have never heard of Glatzer and Westmoreleand? They got their start in gay porn. Based on the quality of work shown in this film, I eagerly look forward to their next work. Errr... their next Independent film.

The key to the success of this film is the performances, particularly Emily Rios' portrayal of Magdalena. The character seems entirely natural and believable and I have to wonder if this is Rios' first film. I strongly suspect she came to this role an unknown. Magdalena is a 14 year old who has to deal with some problems in her life. Rios is very good showing this character's emotions, making us believe she is a real human being and not a fictional character created for a film. Because of her performance, we often feel like we are watching a documentary.

When she gets together with her friends, they are all wearing similar belts and variations on the same clothes. They talk about boys, what other girls were wearing today at school, etc. The refreshing thing is these kids are portrayed as normal. Perhaps struggling a bit in school, but they are living a normal life many people can relate to. Simply because they are Latina and living in a poorer part of town, they aren't involved with gangs, or get into fights, or any of the many other stereotypes we would be subjected to if this film were produced by a studio.

Magdalena's prized possession is her cell phone. The one piece of electronics she was able to save for, it keeps her connected to her friends and her family, but it also has a camera, so she records memories of her time with Herman, her boyfriend. When their relationship starts to deteriorate, she spends some time deleting his pictures from the phone, essentially deleting him from her life. It is a nice touch illustrating her ability to deal with problems in her life.

Jesse Garcia is also good as Carlos, Magdalena's gay cousin. Carlos is really a guy who would probably end up in a gang; he doesn't have a lot of prospects, he works in a dead end job, smokes pot, gets into trouble. But one day, he realizes he is gay and his world becomes very different, his perspective changes. His dad throws him out of the house and he goes to live with his Uncle Tomas. Yes, he still smokes pot, occasionally steals, but living with his Uncle rubs off on him. His Uncle's acceptance changes him. When Magdalena arrives, he suddenly has companionship, but isn't above treating her like his sister, arguing with her and trading insults. But he also feels like he has to help her.

Magdalena moves in with her uncle and cousin who live in a two bedroom guest house on a larger property. Soon, the new owners of the property move into the main house, a gay couple, and Carlos soon begins making frequent trips to ""visit"" his new friends. Later, he tells Magdalena he never had sex before he met them. All of this detail adds a lot of layers to his character, making him a memorable creation.

Chalo Gonzalez, much like Emily Rios, adds a lot of depth to the film, simply because he seems like a real person. As Uncle Tomas, he plays a wise elder, providing guidance when necessary. Considering his age and experience, he is well qualified. Even more important, he doesn't look down on anyone, let alone his fourteen year old pregnant niece of his gay nephew. He welcomes them with open arms as he is welcome within the community.

Later, as events transpire, Magdalena begins looking for a new place for them to live and finds a really nice, newly remodeled guest house owned by a Lesbian couple. One of the owners is very willing to let Magdalena's extended family move in, with her uncle's dogs, but the rent proves to be too high. Later, Magdalena returns and tries to work out a deal with the owner. As soon as the owner learns who her uncle is, he walks the neighborhood selling a traditional hot Mexican beverage from his large thermoses and once gave her a free cup of the drink; she agrees to let them move in at a very reduced rent.

Magdalena appears to have become pregnant without sexual intercourse, something her father doesn't believe but a clinic worker later confirms. How this happened isn't entirely clear, but I am sure thousands of teenage girls will be horrified to learn you can get pregnant simply by kissing a boy. This is a bit far fetched, but because the family is so religious (Dad has started his own church, her name is Magdalena) it is an acceptable stretch of the imagination.

Strangely, given the background of the filmmakers, the least interesting and convincing characters in the film are the gay couple who own the property where Magdalena lives with her uncle and cousin. They are a necessary part of the story, as they help Carlos experience his first sexual encounter, but they are portrayed as just a bit too stereotypical. Gary (David Ross), a Brit, has been in his relationship with James (Jason Wood) for six years with six months ""off for good behavior"". After they move in, they meet Carlos and share him during a sexual encounter. Later, Carlos starts to see Gary on a more regular basis. Throughout, these scenes are necessary to develop Carlos' story and character, but the couple is portrayed in a way that doesn't ring true.

""Quinceanera"" is a very good film, filled with good performances and an occasional misstep. But in a way, this only makes the film seem all the more real and interesting; life is filled with missteps. Despite the age of the main character, I would advise people pay attention to the `R' rating. This film is good for adults and for their children, provided they are able to prepare them for the adult material, or help them understand it after watching the film.",1154995200,15,6951,4.666122448979592

The girl who played Magdalena was very good, but that's the only good thing I can think of to say about this movie. I was bored through most of it and annoyed during the whole birthday party thing.

It starts out with a Quinceaera and then leads in to the main character's quinceaera and how it will not be as fancy as her cousin Eileen's.  The film is more about the family dynamics than the quinceaera festivities (which is fine, but if you want to use this for teaching your Spanish class, it is not the best for that purpose).  The film also deals with sexuality issues which are not too graphic but again if you are a HS teacher, you probably can't show this film in class.  Most high school are pretty tricky with what one can show in the classroom.  On the whole I liked the movie, although it was a bit slow in the beginning but it ends very well and covers many interesting issues that affect Latin Americans, especially in LA.  I think it would be a better film to show university students where you could discuss a variety of issues from immigration, living in between two cultures and the gentrification of immigrant neighborhoods.",1417910400,5,1017,4.530054644808743

2681865,5,B000K2Q7CI,"This story takes place within a working-class Hispanic community in Los Angeles where the traditional Quinceanera celebration marks a young girl's rite of passage at age 15 into womanhood.  Opening with a Quinceanera, the movie takes off and focuses first for quite awhile upon the romance and sexual awakenings of the two main characters.  They are Magdalena, a 14-year-old plain-spoken daughter of a minister, and her cousin, Carlos, an ostracized black sheep of the family who's into petty crime and pot-smoking.

I almost didn't stick with this movie because I felt bored and/or uncomfortable with the teen ""scene.""  I wished I'd never seen one of their contemporary dances that grossly imitated some gross sex.  Also I felt uncomfortable watching the predatory gay landlords.  Staying with the movie until the end, however, turned out to be very rewarding.  Gentle, caring love triumphed.  There was depth and grace to the story, after all.  And, finally, a felicitous Quinceanera for Magdalena.

It turns out that under the surface of the story one finds a deliberate but subtle allusion to the plight of the Virgin Mary and her protector, Joseph.  There is an implicit awareness in the story of Christian values.

The highlight and best pleasure of the movie lies in meeting a real life saint, albeit one who is very ordinary and whose life is obscure.  He very sweetly bears on his shoulders, as a gentle yoke, the troubles of Magdalena and Carlos.

If you can't stand to look at life the way it sometimes really happens instead of the way you think it ought to be, don't see this movie.  It's realistic, and you may find it too offensive.

There is some minimal rather non-explicit sex, no nudity, and some offensive language.  I wonder if the movie is aimed at a teen audience.  It would probably be less shocking to teens than to some grown-ups, but I'd classify it as an adult movie, not for kids under 15.

Ultimately, it's a loving story.  I experienced it as a blessing, a beneficence that really warmed my heart.",1308355200,,2028,4.840116279069767
2681866,5,B000K2Q7CI,"`Quinceanera` is a delightful independent film full of charm and pathos.  With its refreshing lack of pretension and sincere, heartfelt performances, it stands out as one of the best films in recent years.

The film`s premise is simple enough:  the passage to womanhood that marks a Latina`s fifteenth birthday, her `Quinceanera.`  Yet, the story of Magdalena`s `Quinceanera` is anything but straightforward.  Magdalena (Emily Rios in a bravo debut performance) is getting ready for her big day, but things aren`t falling into place.  Her boyfriend abandons her after learning she is pregnant.  Yet, she`s still a virgin.  And things just get weirder. Exiled from home by her fanatical preacher father, Magdalena moves in with her gangbanger wanna-be cousin (Jesse Garcia in another amazing performance) who is cautiously coming-out, and with their avuncular, loving Uncle Thomas `Tio` (Chalo Gonzalez).

`Quinceanera` examines how these three highly divergent characters come together and face the challenges of life in a neighborhood that is radically changing.  The black sheep of his family, Carlos must navigate a community that disapproves of his homosexuality.  When a gay couple moves in upstairs, they take Carlos in as a third partner.  As his attraction to one of the pair increases, Carlos is caught in a dilemma.  His presence threatens to break up the pair and he is soon left with a broken heart.  Moreover, the couple has Carlos, Magdalena, and Tio evicted. Throughout these crises, Tio provides the calming faith that keeps Carlos and Magdalena going.

Garcia, Rios, and Gonzalez are what make this film so charming.  As Magdalena, Rios is pitch perfect as a good girl caught in a very unsatisfactory situation.  Tough and cynical on the outside, Magdalena is still very much a vulnerable girl not ready to become a woman.  In addition, Garcia`s portrayal of the conflicted Carlos is amazing.  Carlos uses his sexy bravado to hide a deep insecurity as he struggles to straddle two very disparate worlds.  As the film progresses, Carlos evolves from a dope-smoking freeloader to a young man who steps up to the responsibilities of adulthood.

Alongside these touching performances, Chalo Gonzalez gives a powerful and understated performance as `Tio.`  With his shuffling stride and battered shopping cart, Tio has been keeping Echo Park supplied with his tasty champurrado.  Behind his grandfatherly smile and halting English, Tio sees more and knows more than he lets on.  Rather than confront, he would rather listen and comfort.  When Carlos talks about visiting his` friend,` Tio remarks that he is glad Carlos has a `special friend.`  It remains unstated, but Carlos knows that he is accepted and loved.

`Quinceanera` can be appreciated on yet another level as well: as a parable about dying and being reborn.  With Tio`s passing, so passes a way of life.  Carlos and Magdalena must learn to survive in an Echo Park that is no longer the comfortable nest of their childhoods.  With her pregnancy, Magdalena must face an adulthood far more imposing than any ceremony could be.  And despite his wounded pride and new responsibilities, Carlos faces the world with the confidence and power that comes from self-knowledge.  The film ends with Magdalena and Carlos stepping out of the limo into a world that is no longer Tio`s.  Yet, somehow you know everything`s going to be alright.",1299801600,4,3401,5.159049360146252

2681868,4,B000K2Q7CI,"I just finished watching this movie (with commercials) on a ""geared to Latinos"" station on cable.  One interesting thing about this movie is that much of the dialogue is in Spanish (with English subtitles) but the characters switch back and forth from English to Spanish with ease (as is often the case with ""real"" Latinos).

It's a hard look at life in Echo Park, which really appears (at least in the movie) to be a beautiful part of L.A. - with great views.  At first, one thing I didn't like was that the two gay (white) males turned out to be ""bad guys"", but then I realized that Herman, the boyfriend, was Hispanic and ""straight"" and the girl's father was also Hispanic and ""straight"" (AND very stait-laced!) and they weren't so nice either, so I suppose it was an equal opportunity for all as far as good and bad characters - and like real life, each character had its noble and not so noble aspects.

It did seem very real, and very entertaining, and very tear-causing in parts.  I loved the ""Tio"" in the movie who, as Carlos put it at his funeral, was a saint (or the closet human counterpart there can be) - a nonjudgmental, generous soul, who was a friend to everyone he met.

Very good movie.  I recommend it.  In fact, I just now bought the DVD from Amazon and am looking forward to watching it without commercials and also seeing the ""extras"" (the making of the movie, etc.)  Bravo, film makers and actors in this movie.",1230336000,,1434,4.46360153256705
2681869,5,B000K2Q7CI,"What holds this movie together and most independent films is the big heart behind it.  The biggest ones ofcourse goes to the three leads, Jesse Garcia(Carlos), Emily Rios(Magdalena) and Chalo Gonzalez(Tio Tomas). These three made the movie. Their interpretation of their characters is so on the mark.  And the Title?  I think it's no use explaining what Quinceanera is all about but let me give it a try.  It's a celebration to mark the transition of a girl to womanhood.  It's real big, sometimes parents spend more on this than the wedding.  Why 15, some sociological anthropologist surmise that it was an ancient mayan ritual melded into Christianity. Anyway, Magdalena's Quinceanera is really just a backdrop.  It's just that so many life altering events happens as she looks forward to her big day.  One being a virginal pregnancy which might puzzle some viewers, but I think this is an atempt to pay homage to the the style of literature that is Latin American; Magical Thinking made popular by novelist/nobel laurette- Gabriel Garcia-Marquez.  I think it's a nice touch.  And for some of us who has lived and is familiar with the setting, Echo Park, this movie will make you homesick.  You can see that some of the same shops and streets haven't change much and it's real cool that the filmakers used real people who lived there and shot the film almost entirely on location.  My hats off to the actors and the filmakers, what a lobor of love and it shows.  Please watch the DVD extras.  It is just as interesting like the fact the Emily Rios grew up in a Jehovah Witnesses' family(the religious sect that don't beleive in celebrating birthdays, holloween, christmas, anything-PartyPoopers!  but I hear that it's okay for couples to celebrate their Wedding Anniversaries.) so Rios never had a Quinceanera or anything like it and Jesse Garcia grew up in the midWest, no exposures to Chicano culture or gang life.  Chalo Gonzales who lovingly portrays Tio Tomas is an old western, Sam Pekinpah actor, expresses his aprreciation for being in the movie with such joy that's its palpable and you cry along with him.  I highly recommend this movie.  It's a real treat.",1217894400,,2169,4.8478260869565215

2681892,5,B000K2Q7CI,"Quinceaera is one of those very few indie films that truly score a huge goal. The convincing acting had me riveted to my seat throughout the picture; and I actually shed a few tears when I watched Carlos, the black sheep of the family, give a eulogy for his deceased Uncle Tomas near the end of the film. Quinceaera sends a big message about life in general, what growing up is really all about, and how tough things can be when an ethnic neighborhood becomes gentrified.

The action begins at a Quinceaera ritual and party (a coming of age ceremony in Spanish culture similar to a young Jewish girl's Bat Mitzvah). We see the young people dancing on the floor and the older members of the family with socializing at their tables with their friends. A fourteen year old girl named Magdalena (Emily Rios) dreams of her upcoming Quinceaera ceremony while her thick headed father simply dreads the high cost of the ceremony. In addition, we quickly see that all will not be the way Magdalena wants for her party. She will have to wear a dress already worn by another member of the family and she will not be able to arrive at her Quinceaera in a Hummer limousine.

Magdalena and her boyfriend Herman (J.R. Cruz) are fumbling through a relationship as girlfriend and boyfriend when a shocking event occurs--Magdalena is pregnant. Nobody can figure out how or why, especially since the one time she was intimate with Herman they did not go ""all the way."" Nevertheless, pregnant she is--and her father rewards her by throwing her out of their home.

Magdalena soon winds up living with her gentle, kind Uncle Tomas (Chalo Gonzlez) and the black sheep of the family, her cousin Carlos (Jesse Garcia) who, with the exception of Uncle Tomas, they all hate because he likes men. However, unexpected events occur which challenge Magdalena to grow up fast in a meaningful way that a mere ceremonial Quinceaera never could have.

What will happen to Magdalena and Carlos after their Uncle Tomas dies unexpectedly? Will Magdalena's parents ever reconcile with her? How did Magdalena actually become pregnant in the first place? How does gentrification change the lives of the Spanish people in their neighborhood? No spoilers here, folks, you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!

Look for some very moving scenes near the end of this movie, especially, as I wrote above, when Carlos speaks at his Uncle's funeral. I also like the way the film takes its time to develop Carlos's relationship with the two gay men who live next door to them. The choreography was quite good for the Quinceaera party scenes and the cinematography was great. You'd never know this was a low budget movie; it says so much that is so meaningful you won't notice too many flaws when you watch this one.

The DVD comes with a few extras which include a commentary with both the filmmakers and the cast; and there is a noteworthy ""making of"" the movie featurette.

Overall, I highly recommend Quinceaera for fans of independent films and for anyone who enjoys films that entertain but make you think and move you with their heartfelt message. Quinceaera exposes the great talents of many of the actors; but Emily Rios as Magdalena and Jesse Garcia as Carlos are the ones who truly steal the show.

Bravo!",1197504000,2,3273,4.739894551845342
2681893,3,B000K2Q7CI,"quinceanera is a lot on the real side. an old tradition with lots of drama that really happens. i liked it because it does relate to the realities of life in a not so well to do family, a broken family, and a teenage mother. all things that happen, and are for real. they do it so well, but the only thing that i didn't like is that there isn't any real feelings there. maybe just in jesse garcia's case (carlos). he brought it. the outsider of the familia, because he's down and he brings that ese vibe to the screen very well. on the other hand, every one else is just sort of there to say the lines. i would have liked to see more emotions that's the only way you really feel what's going on. you understand if you've been there and lived it, so you've felt that emotion, but for those who haven't need to see the realities as they really are. overall the movie was good. the way the baile goes, the way things are when there's no money, when you finally find the real you, and how to deal with being pregnant at 15. how the boys can make it but vatos can't take care of it. pretty sad, but that's life. the beauty of growing up the best you can with what you have. growing a life inside you when you're just growing up yourself. everything is there, and well done. this is a good one. just another glimpse in the life of the latinos. the struggles, the so called shame, and that you don't need much to be happy.",1190073600,2,1415,4.130434782608695

2681895,4,B000K2Q7CI,"Half in English, half in Spanish `Quincinera' is a coming-of-age story brimming with warmth and gentle humor.  Significantly named, Magdalena (Emily Rios) is approaching her fifteenth birthday worthy of a debutante celebration.  She is intimately dating Herman (J.R. Cruz) who is gentle and has aspirations for worldliness and the trappings a higher education can garner.  Living with her is her cousin Carlos (Jesse Garcia) who is gay.  Both treat each other alternately with scathing hostility and gentle regard.  Polarizing the household are strict religious household head Ernesto (Jesus Castanos) and gentle great grand-uncle Tio Toma's (Chalo Gonzalez).  In the meantime, Carlos, regarded as the black sheep of the family, has an affair with the nearby landlord, and both Magdalena and Carlos have to face conflicts involving betrayal and trust.

Much of the characterization and acting take away some of the soap-opera feel to the movie, especially with some solid writing and directing from Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland.  'Quincinera' is good for giving us a fine cross-section of Mexican-American life and a drama that wins our affection.",1181520000,2,1156,5.491525423728813
2681896,4,B000K2Q7CI,"As a native-born Los Angeleno, I found this appealing film existed in a sort of fairy tale land. It somehow makes LA seem green and lush, with old school charm. The movie is populated with young Latino men who belie few signs of machismo. Instead, they are interested in soft words, art, and, well, each other. Go figure.

But the souce of Quinceaera's real charm is its teen protagonist, Emily Rios as Magdalena. She is a marvel as her character finds her tightlipped way through this film. Ms. Rios's portrayal is unexpectedly subtle and layered, which is interesting in that the DVD extras reveal that her approach to acting is extremely simplistic. Brava!

The DVD extras also show that the writer/director team and production staff for Quinceaera are overwhelming Anglo (and mostly gay). This outsider viewpoint is not a weakness for filmwatchers, but I would argue that it does detract from its verisimilitude. That said, kudos to the filmmakers for introducing the issue of neighborhood gentrification into their film, though it is not really resolved in any fashion.

Directed and written by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland.

A 14 year old Mexican-American girl, Magdalena (Emily Rios), wants to have her Quinceanera ceremony to celebrate her upcoming 15th birthday, a big step in her spiritual life. Upon trying on her dress, it has gotten tighter and the dressmaker had her exact measurements. The dressmaker talks with her mother about a possibility.  As it turns out, Magdalena is pregnant from her boyfriend, Herman (J.R. Cruz), but her hymen has not been removed, according to the doctor. It is a miracle conception.  Magdalena's parents throw her out of the house and she goes to live with her great granduncle, Tio (Chalo Gonzalez) and her cousin, Carlos (Jesse Garcia), whom just had his first adult gay sex experience.

Also in the cast: Alicia Sixtos, Araceli Guzman-Rico, Jesus Castanos, Jorge Ortiz, Danny Vasquez, Johnny Chavez,, Carmen Aguirre, David W. Ross, Jason L. Wood.

Because many members of the cast were non-professional actors and were not members of the Screen Actors Guild, Chalo Gonzalez had to hand in his SAG card before he could play the role of ""Tio"".

My only reason for seeing this movie is because Jesse Garcia is in it. He was 22 or 23 at the time of filming. He starred in From Dusk 'Till Dawn tv series (El Rey, 2014-16).

Filmed in Echo Park, Los Angeles, California.

In-film advertising: Canon, Tecate, Budweiser. Target gets a mention.

Option of language: English/Spanish mix, Portuguese, Spanish.
Option of subtitles: English, French, Portuguese, Spanish.

Special Features: Commentary with the filmmakers and cast. On the Red Carpet with... The Making of ... Mis Quince Anos.
