3628060,4,B001HB1K32,"""Ancient Egypt Unearthed"" by the Discovery Channel will appeal the most to viewers who have already had the opportunity to view other well-made productions about Ancient Egypt.  Think for example about ""Egypt Beyond the Pyramids"" and ""Engineering an Empire"" by The History Channel and ""Secrets of Archaeology"" by Koch Vision.  Most episodes shed a penetrating light on less well-known aspects of this prestigious civilization.  Episodes such as ""Secrets of Egypt's Lost Queen,"" ""Women Pharaohs,"" and ""Why Ancient Egypt Fell"" come to mind.  In summary, the DVD set under review reveals once more, how much is still unknown, about a civilization that was a lightening tower for over three millennia.",1270425600,,697,5.36697247706422
3628061,4,B001HB1K32,"This is a typical well done Discovery Channel presentation. There are some inaccuracies in the text, but they are very minor. In all it is a beautiful presentation and very well done. People who are interested in a very accuirate and comprehensive history of ancient Egypt might want to consider the Teaching Companies series ""The History Of Ancient Egypt"" presented by professor Robert Bryer a well known egyptologist. His grasp of the subject is outstanding.

3628062,5,B001HB1K32,Searched for good information on Egypt for years and this is by far the best I've come across. Was at first just going to buy Egypt Uncovered until I came across this Dvd set and was pleasently surprised to find it contained all of Egypt Uncovered as well as much more. And at only a fraction of the price!! Over eight hours of information on two Dvd's. Highly recommend this set to anyone interested in Ancient Egypt.,1254096000,59,418,4.441558441558442
3628063,4,B001HB1K32,"To dismiss Ancient Egypt Unearthed as simply an educational video for kids would be foolish and shortsighted. Not only is it extremely well produced, it's also incredibly interesting and brilliantly edited, making it nearly impossible to stop watching it once you begin. When it comes to programs and information on Egypt, this history of the pyramids, tombs, and pharaohs, it would be hard to find a title that does it better than this one.

Experts at this sort of production, this series of documentaries from the Discovery Channel features famed archaeologist Dr. Zahi Hawass as he ""digs deep to uncover new clues regarding some of ancient Egypt's greatest mysteries."" Of course they cover the basics- pyramids, pharaohs, and the famed Cleopatra, Nefertiti, etc.- but they also take it a step further, exploring things like Egypt's extraordinary military strength, the reason for their fast decline as a society, and the role that powerful women played in the country's rule.

The footage is stunning, and includes looks into tombs that have never before been explored, as well as detailed examinations of pyramids and other archeological and architectural wonders. The series comprises five complete Discovery programs: Egypt Uncovered, Egypt's Ten Greatest Discoveries, Secret's of Egypt's Lost Queen, Why Ancient Egypt Fell, and Women Pharaohs. This is truly a thorough look at the rise and fall of this incredible civilization.

Each episode features an in-depth look at one aspect of ancient Egyptian culture, exploring it in a way that's both fascinating and educational. On their own, each episode is interesting; together the series is incredible.

Although children and young adults will surely love this series, it's most certainly not just for kids; anyone with an interest in history, ancient civilizations, world politics, archeology, architecture, or world societies would certainly enjoy this series.",1253232000,76,1919,5.429530201342282

3628065,5,B001HB1K32,"Produced by Discovery channel, it is over 8 1/2 hours of a mind-blowing documentary on the pharoahs of Egypt.  You are shown the discoveries of the Kings and Queens and the painstaking trouble they take to identify the mummies.  They show the out-of-the-way inscriptions that spell out a detailed look at everyday life, as well as the secret personal lives of these pharoahs.  From the Egyptian museum, and the Giza pyramids, to Luxor and the Valley of the Kings, and on to the Aswan quarries, they cover everything in exquisite detail, and with the best professionals in their fields to support their findings.  You could watch it 5 times and see something new each time.  On the 1-5 scale, I would have to rate this video a 7.  In a word -- FANTASTIC!!!",1251331200,85,755,4.639097744360902

3628084,4,B001HB1K32,I love History and Egypt has always been fascinating to me. It has a lot of cool information about the subject but it was more concerning the beginning of Egypt. It didn't really go into their rituals or anything.,1416960000,,213,4.487179487179487

3628087,2,B001HB1K32,"""Ancient Egypt Unearthed"" includes 5 episodes of ""Egypt Uncovered"" on Disc 1 and 4 miscellaneous episodes on Disc 2.

According to the Amazon.com Review, this book was published ""to coincide with a five-part series on the Discovery Channel ...  Written for general readers ..."".  In other words, the book is a TV documentary tie-in.

The narrator is Philip Madoc (1934-2012), a Welsh born RADA trained actor and linguist.

All episodes - except the last - have an aspect ratio of 16 x 9.
Women Pharaohs has an aspect ratio of 14 x 9.

I bought ""Ancient Egypt Unearthed"" from Amazon US in October 2014.

These DVDs are just light entertainment with the usual pictures, computer generated images and awful re-enactments typical of the genre with some cock-and-bull stories retold for the gullible.

The narrator of ""Mummies: Into The Afterlife"" (Disc 1) says, in all seriousness, that Mark Twain actually saw a train fireman in Egypt using mummies as fuel whereas Mark Twain himself, in ""The Innocents Abroad"", made no such claim and, in a footnote, wrote: ""Stated to me as a fact.  I only tell it as I got it.  I am willing to believe it.  I can believe any thing.""  Another spurious story - that mummy wrappings were used in the US to make butcher's paper - is also given credence.

The sun sets slowly in the west more often in these DVDs than in a host of James A. FitzPatrick TravelTalks.",1413849600,6,3008,4.775628626692456
3628088,5,B001HB1K32,AWESOME!!! That's all I got to say about this DVD set! So much info in all these DVDs! You get to see dr. Zahi Hawass and his team go in search to find some mummies and the stories behind!! Love it!!,1411257600,2,199,3.8780487804878048

3628091,3,B001HB1K32,A very good documentary series until Hawass enters the scene.  He's fake and forces his opinions on the events.,1404432000,11,111,4.842105263157895

3628105,5,B001HB1K32,"This DVD provides a concise history of ancient Egypt.  I personally found it informative although the coverage for each indidual dynasty is brief.  However, considering the long ancient history of Egypt, it is virtually impossible to have detailed coverage for individual dynasty and yet be able to cover the entire period of over three thousand years.  The identification of Queen Hatsheptsut using modern scientific forensic technique is very interesting.  At last, the remains of Egypt's most powerful queen who had been lost for thousands of years have been located, identified and documented in this DVD.",1391558400,,609,5.378947368421053

3628108,5,B001HB1K32,I am still viewing this series for the first time.  It is very interesting.  They have arranged the shows to trace the development of Ancient Egypt as it grew from a camp of nomads into a thriving super-power.  I am very pleased with it.  It offers the world views of this early culture as well as details that were new to me.  The collection contains nine programs ranging in length from 47 minutes to one which is ninety minutes long.  This is a very enjoyable set.,1376006400,,467,4.372093023255814
3628109,4,B001HB1K32,I chose this DVD because I wanted a broader background than some of the Egypt DVD's have.  This one is it.

It also includes their neighbors and how they influenced Egypt's development.

There is nothing published within the last 5-8 years out there yet.

All discoveries are covered in detail. Lineages are explained. 'Lost' pharaohs are found. Women pharaohs are covered as well. It also covers mummification, tomb choices, why Egypt fell, when this culture and government by pharaohs actually began, when monuments began and who built them, ancient makeup explanations, etc.
