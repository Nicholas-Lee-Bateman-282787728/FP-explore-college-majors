8362357,5,B00005AFM2,"The good news: Lionsgate has put out the European theatrical version of Emmanuelle 5, Borowcyzk's penultimate feature film, in it's original English dialogue and uncut (despite what some uninformed sources may report). The bad news: it's in fullscreen, so you end up losing some visual information in the crop. However, if you can't find the rare Greek pal letterboxed (but non-anamorphic) disc, this is better than nothing. It's a clean, decent presentation at any rate.

E5 finds Borowcyzk in a relaxed, lighter mood, poking fun at the Cannes Film Festival, censorship and Western perception of the Middle East. In fact, most of Boro's recurring themes are present here, as well as his classic visual motifs and peculiar editing style. If seen with the right eye, alongside his other work, it's clear that the film does fit neatly alongside the director's other work. It's a satire, a black comedy, a spoof of Emmanuelle and a mocking of tropes of ""erotic"" films in general. It also references some of his past experiences at Cannes with The Beast in the early 70s.

Did Boro phone this one in for the paycheck? You decide, but while clearly not his best film, it's amusing and interesting - with some beautiful imagery and an incredible Pierre Bachelet score. There is a rough, choppy feel to the pacing - an abruptness due to Borowczyk's last-minute removal of several scenes of dialogue and opting for pure visual with voice-over to propel the plot forward (indeed, these out-takes ended up on the US home-video release, along with newly shot scenes). Use of stock footage, models and the usual Borowczyk drawings and handwritten notes just further increases the bizarre, dream-like feel of the film.

Loopy and surreal, this odd little film is an interesting example of what can happen when you give an outrageous art-house director a genre film franchise installment to direct.",1432080000,,1884,5.012779552715655
8362358,1,B00005AFM2,"The movie about nothing. Yeah, supposedly spoiled white chick has nothing better to do and running around and recall her previous affairs while trying new one--sure, whatever rocks your boat. I've seen better ones about nothing. The problem, however, is a producer who has zero imagination and  budget to waste. In addition being boring the movie is about rich's people life and how bad or good they are which kinda useless to show or discuss. The main part--sexual--really lousy  and I see  much better pieces on internet, mostly from Japan, and free too.",1387152000,,556,4.956989247311828
8362359,2,B00005AFM2,"See that name?  Pretty much the only reason to watch this movie.  If you loved this Pet, then this is another excuse to see her, naked of course.
Starts in Cannes where she is stripped naked by her fans & runs thru the town to the marina where she catches a boat to safety.  Her savior is a multi-millionaire who tries to save her from herself.  She rebels & ends up in the Middle East? with some sheik who kills anyone who talks to her & tries to make her part of his really ugly harem.  She escapes with the help of some guy who turns out to be hired by the millionaire.  Story is incredibly stupid.  Several of the locales seem to be ""umm, I'm tired, can we just shoot here?"" while the rest are to show the extravagance of Emmanuelle's good fortune.  The editors got lazy (or maybe they were doing the best with what they had) and re-used one scene several times.
Overall, not very good.  If you just want to remember your youthful crush, then buy it.",1304467200,,954,4.226519337016574
8362360,4,B00005AFM2,"Emmanuelle 5 is Polish surrealist Walerian Borowczyk's penultimate theatrical feature, a film who's merits are hotly debated among cult and artfilm lovers. Some see the movie as nothing more than a commercial sell-out, others as an interesting addition to his body of work. It's also the last quality entry of the official Emmanuelle franchise.
Adding to the confusion is the fact that there are at least three versions: the theatrical European version, the heavily edited US version (including new scenes produced by Roger Corman!), and a European home video version including extra hard-core scenes that feature none of the principal cast.

This time round Emmanuelle is portrayed by Monique Gabrielle, who is, in a jarring change, a bleach blonde American actress. Never mind that the character is supposed to be French, it kind of works, mainly because Ms. Gabrielle has the sense to play the role with just the right nod and wink. And while no actress came close to Sylvia Kristel's beauty, charm and class, Monique makes the role her own. Since the film dispenses with any previous character back story, here she portrays Emmanuelle as a single, free-spirited woman who makes erotic art-films and runs a dance studio out of her beloved loft in Paris.

The movie opens with a ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"" style montage of Cannes, with a documentary-like narration giving us an overview of the famous film festival held there every year. It seems Emmanuelle is premiering her latest film, Love Express, in Cannes... causing a scandal in the process. In fact, we first see her in this film within a film, in a beautifully shot sequence on a set of craggy rocks overlooking the roaring ocean. At a press conference later, she must defend her film to close-minded reporters who accuse her of creating pornography. It's all obviously a reference to Borowczyk's own experiences at the very same festival.
After the Q&A, Emmanuelle's producer, a smarmy French type, introduces her to Prince Rajid, a wealthy sheik who own's the fictional Arab country of Benglagistan. He's apparently obsessed with Emmanuelle and wants to premiere the film in his homeland.

Outside, an adoring throng of male fans awaits Emmanuelle, all desperate for a touch of the famed beauty. Things quickly escalate and soon the mob is stripping her of every last article of clothing, sending her jumping onto a stranger's departing boat for safety. Her unwitting saviour is Charles D. Foster, a nerdy, but handsome young millionaire who disapproves of Emmanuelle's erotic films. Sparks fly, and before you know it, love is in the air. Is a happy ending in the works? Perhaps, but not before a journey back onto the Love Express and Prince Rajid kidnaps Emmanuelle, putting her in his harem.

The version most people know is the English language American edit (which in addition to the new Corman scenes also utilizes Borowczyk's outtakes), perhaps the reason Emmanuelle 5 is dismissed by some. The new scenes, while amusing, just don't gel with the traditional European style that people expect from Emmanuelle films. While the original release of Emmanuelle 5 certainly doesn't lack a sense of humor, Corman's New Horizon version goes over the top with campy 80s comedy, seeming more like a companion to Bachelor Party (also starring Ms. Gabrielle) and other films of that ilk. It's also clumsily edited - the transition between film quality is jarring. What they attempt is admirable (give the story more cohesion, tighten the pacing), but apparently they didn't even bother doing a final film print edit, it was all put together on 3/4 video with a series of bad fade-ins and bleeds. Apparently they opted for a quick home video release and couldn't be bothered to finish it off right. This version is also only available in a terrible full-screen DVD transfer.

If you can track down a copy of Borowczyk's original theatrical edit of Emmanuelle 5, do so. It's a smart, interesting film well worth owning, and has a lot more going for it than Monique Gabrielle's bare [...].",1150416000,5,4055,5.001481481481481
