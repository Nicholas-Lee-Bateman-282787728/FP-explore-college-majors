8663589,5,B00L3NS8FW,I really enjoyed watching the top performers of this organization when the IWA was active. I really shocked to find out that Bulldog Brower was a veteran of the Armed Forces. To see fan favorites like Victor Rivera and Dino Bravo was really a thrill I will always treasure. We really need more products like this for real die hard wrestling fans.,1444608000,,346,4.596774193548387
