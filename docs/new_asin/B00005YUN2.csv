7957061,5,B00005YUN2,Once again the beautiful angels kei and yuri are in more trouble all of it caused mostly by them and are once again getting themselves nice and dirty doing it. I like this dvd because it is a nice anime though it does have a few brief nude seens it isn't in a sexual context the show isn't what the name implies for those who are expecting it to be well dirty. Of course if that is why you are giving this anime a look then you don't need to be watching it you perverts know who you are. All that aside this anime is a very light hearted one even in the most action packed seens you still get a good laugh. mission 3 basically starts when kei is in a plane crash in the mountains after rescuing a baby that stands to inherit billions and ends with the angels defending 3wa leader poporo from a terrorist who would be more than happy to nix their beloved leader from the equation. With a rather poppy begining theme sung by the japanese voice for kei and a rather interesting end theme aswell as the trailers for other dvds and the trailer for the dvd it's self and character bios of the characters. So whether it's kei's die hard tomboy attitude or yuri's incesent search for a man and getting rich while doing it sceams or you just like to see how much kei-os(forgive the pun)they can cause in one episode The Dirty Pair don't dissapoint with good humor for those 12+.,1094342400,2,1369,4.24904214559387
7957062,3,B00005YUN2,"For me a 3-star ratng is an honest rating and means it's a decent entertaining flick in a general way, not something everyone has to have and perhaps a good buy for fans of the Dirty Pair, but otherwise just a movie aimed at a broad audience who likes watching movies in general. I have the original Dirty Angels: Girls With Guns (old but watchable) and Dirty Pair Flash: Angels at Worlds End and these are all prime-time series anime specializing in a new-situation-each-episode themes. They aren't fabulous but not terrible either.
In Random Angels (for example) Kei rescues a rich hier-to-a-fortune baby in snowy mountain terrain (and being female has a natural pacifier when it's bottle runs dry), Yuri and Kei are targets of a teenage assassin who uses toys (Yuri's top is popped when Kei grabs her to keep her from falling in a swimming pool of acid - and their cutey-girl assassin transforms ala ""Sailor Moon"" into a cutey-vixen there is a hint of nipples), the girls show lots of slinky skin when they train for a beach ball competition to nab a criminal, a criminal bent on vengence wreaks havock with the 3WA building and they save their boss (robotic armor and chaos and dang-nab the paperwork), and the episode I haven't watched has Kei falling for a guy who actually obsessed with her to the point of making a robot of her. (Saving it for later.)
The girls sometimes cause more destruction than they avert; fans who have never tried Hyper Dolls should give that a whirl, too. Since mayhem flashes to being when the girls get going.
There is a slight amount of nudity (real R-rated nudity: you get glimpses of both girls nipples once each, but only once), there is profanity and there is violence: but overall, this is aimed at a more mature young-adult evening audience, with slight humor and tame theme mainly concentrating on suspenseful action. It isn't chocked full of sex, nudity, blood gushing violence (although there is real killing going on), etc., it's just another sci-fi anime of trouble-shooters for a quasi-police organization. For example, the assassin girl drives a mono-bike (a true monbike where the rider sits in the center and the wheel runs around them) and has robotic dive-bombing birds, and yet retreats to a castle to engage the girls. Old and new mix. I'd rate it PG-13 or such mainly because it is not a show for pre-schoolers. (Less your pre-schoolers are quiet mature).
Technically, while a casual fan I find the voices of the girls a little annoying; maybe the sound quality isn't that great, but they sound like they suffer a severe case of smokers-throat. And thus, I like the shows but I'm not blind to their faults. Overall, the art is pretty decent but not dazzling.
Extras include the general set of scene selection, character BIOs, trailers, and things I never bother with because in the end they just never add any value to the DVD for me. I watch movies for the movie, not extras (Oh wow, stills from the movie! Gee, what wonderful extras! Blah!).
When I am bored of cutey movies and too-solemn blood gushers and silly laugh-aholic flicks, I pop the girls in for a change of pace, having as I do a wide selection of DVDs of varying tastes for varying moods.",1019779200,7,3209,4.691489361702128
