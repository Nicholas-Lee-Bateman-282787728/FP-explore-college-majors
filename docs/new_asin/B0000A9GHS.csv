1904390,4,B0000A9GHS,"A feel good movie about Lawn Bowling ?, yes, and its done as only the British can do it. A light hearted romp through the fabric of society and the underdog trying to come out on top. The casting is well done and makes the characters  believable, including Vince Vaughn as the high powered Ad Man/ Agent. A good family movie and satisfying time waster. It may even make you want to try out the game of Lawn Bowling, a sport that is not as easy as you might think.",1072656000,,463,4.144444444444445
1904391,1,B0000A9GHS,"I'm torn as to whether to label this as the most unfunniest comedy ever, for I have ""Disorderlies"" with the Fat Boys and ""Private Resort"" with Johnny Depp and Rob Morrow to contend with.  Regardless, as lame as most of the recent National Lampoon titles have been as of late, this one certainly takes the cake of being the most unwatchable.  Mel Smith (the co-writer/director) apparently has a few good friends, for I can't imagine any other reason as to why James Cromwell and Vince Vaughn would even think to sign on to something this ridiculously bad (although they, to their credit are only featured in supporting roles).  To sum it up briefly, this movie takes a predictable and watered-down ""Dodgeball"" approach, punishes you with creating the most annoying main character in history (and yes, he is more annoying than Pauly Shore, Yahoo Serious, Jerry Lewis and Pee-Wee Herman have done on their worst day), wastes your time by featuring an incredibly dull sport and fails to muster one single laugh out of the proceedings.  Being a Vince Vaughn fan, I was expecting this to be one of those ""under-the-radar"" flicks that I would be happy to uncover.  Instead, I'm left wishing that I didn't waste my time watching it----and I only sat through the whole thing because I had a morbid curiousity to see if it was possible for the film to fail on all accounts.  Well, that's the one factor in which this movie succeeded.  Zero stars for this one.  Avoid it.",1174694400,3,1460,4.7204724409448815
1904392,5,B0000A9GHS,Over the years National Lampoon has put out it's share of horrible films ie Pledge This being the latest.  This movie was funny and engaging.  It had a good story and a descent plot ulike many of the other movies.  Don't miss out.  This is one of the better movies out of the National Lampoon archive.,1173744000,,301,4.321428571428571
1904393,1,B0000A9GHS,"this movie sucked.  i wish i didn't watch it.  it takes place in england, so right there you know its gonna suck.  i didn't realize that or i wouldnt have bought it.  vince vaughn was ok in this movie, but it was about some ugly loser who played an old peoples game.  bocci ball is way cooler than the stupid game they played in this movie.  is is a slow, stupid movie.  no action story or anything.  just about some loser who looks like he smells like crusty butthole.",1140912000,3,469,4.191011235955056
1904394,4,B0000A9GHS,"This movie was originally released in Britain in 2003, probably before Dodgeball was even filmed. I say that because there exists the sentiment that this was somehow a spin-off.

Anyways, the concept of a movie about bowls drew my roommate and I to the theater when in London.  We had no idea what to expect and wer pleasently suprised to see Vince Vaughn. His character was entertaining as were all the others.  In the British context it was pretty funny... very very bizarre though.",1138665600,3,484,4.738095238095238
1904395,4,B0000A9GHS,"Totally watchable and enjoyable film, both for it's comic and dramatic aspects. A nice change to see a film that doesn't feature a car chase or a bullet-proof leading man. Also worth mentioning is the soundtrack, with features a nice selection of classic rock tunes. The ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" segment alone warrants seeing this film!",1137369600,6,336,5.017857142857143
1904396,2,B0000A9GHS,"I watched this movie with my girlfriend during what I was trying to call our 'National Lampoon' phase, which was really only my 'Discovering that National Lampoon is a Salable License that Has no Connection to Pre-Existing National Lampoon Films or Media'.

...

Whether or not you can enjoy this film depends on whether or not (1) you have seen Dodgeball and whether or not (2) you think that the premise of lawn bowling being treated as a dramatic subject is funny after having seen Dodgeball.

...

Vince Vaughn's comic charisma almost saves the movie, but he doesn't show up until you're already a half hour in and asking your girlfriend if you shouldn't trade it for National Lampoon's Dorm Daze.",1120348800,,701,4.768595041322314
1904397,5,B0000A9GHS,"Loved it! Funny like ""Men with Brooms"". Vince Vaughn is awesome in it!

1904398,4,B0000A9GHS,"This movie, based on a true story, was enjoyable to watch.  Unfortunately, it is not closed-captioned so many hearing-impaired people will not be able to watch it.",1108857600,2,163,5.037037037037037
1904399,1,B0000A9GHS,"This movie has been out for awhile. The only thing new is  National Lampoons Logo. The plot was trying to make fun of dodgeball, but in the end the laughter was really Weak.  Watch dodgeball instead!",1108771200,2,199,4.5
1904400,1,B0000A9GHS,"I ordered this DVD thinking that it was the British comedy about lawn bowling like the above reviewer thought.  This is NOT that movie!  This is a very dark movie about a racist character, etc. according to the back.  The comedy is only available through Amazon UK that I've found if your player can play that region.  I've already returned this one and ordered the British one.",1092960000,6,378,4.597014925373134

7996400,5,B0000A9GHS,This movie is a surprise. Much funnier than you would expect with great characters. I really liked this movie a lot.,1387929600,,116,4.571428571428571
7996401,5,B0000A9GHS,THis is a very good movie. National Lampoon movies are very funny movies. I bought this movie for cheap and it was worth what I paid.,1334620800,,133,4.153846153846154
7996402,5,B0000A9GHS,This was a bargain buy for me so I would have something to watch. It turned out to be a movie I grab 3-4 times a year to watch. Well worth the money. big surprise for a movie about boccie ball.,1295222400,,193,3.731707317073171

7996404,4,B0000A9GHS,"If you enjoy Lawn Bowls, this is a fun movie.  The American accents were also fun... being they were British bowlers -- but being American, we could forgive them, LOL.",1283990400,,167,4.566666666666666
7996405,5,B0000A9GHS,"When I see National Lampoon in the title I don't expect too much , but I was pleasantly surprised at how good this film was. I think most of the negative reviews of this movie come from those who like the usual junk that National Lampoon puts out, and since  this movie is well written, acted and directed it puts them off. If you're someone who enjoys a well written character study over bathroom humor, I think you'll enjoy this film.",1283904000,,436,4.382716049382716
7996406,5,B0000A9GHS,"I simply don't get it.  Given a second thought, perhaps I do.  If you've ever found yourself tantalized by the local paper's movie reviews, only to find, upon seeing a particular movie, that your opinion actually differed from the  voice upon high (blasphemy!), you may consider yourself baptized.

Paul Kaye acts his behind off, while it's nice to see James Cromwell (Babe, Clear and Present Danger) in majestic motion.  Vince Vaughn adds a nice touch of extra comedy and you can't go wrong with Mr. Double Down.

This movie might not be funny if: you need a laugh-track to cue the humorous parts, story and character development take a backseat to explosions and gratuitous T/A, or this movie was not featured in the Men's Health Entertainment Section, and if you're reading that, I can only pray for your conversion in the least anyways.

The National Lampoon moniker threw me at first, but don't let it deter you.  Even the worst tennis player scores a point now and then.  Bring on the soundtrack featuring Queen, The Who, and U2.  The only thing missing from this movie is a Stone Roses song.  I waited to write this review until I had two copies in my library, so now drink deep from the well and be satisfied at last.",1177459200,,1225,4.625
