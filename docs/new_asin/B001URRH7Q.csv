8365113,5,B001URRH7Q,"HELL IS FOR HEROES so we are told. Was there ever a man more misunderstood? Steve McQueen plays a soldier who lives only for the thrill of combat. His character is cold and frightening and borders on the psychotic. He's a sociopath who carves up German soldiers with a butcher knife. After the war there is no going back for him. I saw this when I was a kid. I saw a lot of war movies in the theatre back then but this was the first one that really scared me. It gave me a sick feeling inside of how real war must be like. The scene with the bayonets and landmines left an impact on me for a long time after. Everyone in this film gave realistic performances but I remember how Steve McQueen's character seemed really demented. Yet despite the obvious psychological makeup of McQueen is there still a human being hidden deep within him. What is a hero? Don Siegel directed this tough and mean film and asks this profound question. Cinematographer Harold Lipstein's photography brings stark realism to this film. Composer Leonard Rosenman's score is very reminiscent of his brilliant work for the very popular W.W.II television series ""Combat!"" which ran for 5 years. This film also boasted a brilliant cast. Bobby Darin, James Coburn, Fess Parker, L.Q. Jones, Nick Adams, Harry Guardino, Mike Kellin and Bob Newhart are all featured. This is an underrated classic. HELL IS FOR HEROES is brutal heroism.",1414800000,,1402,4.680161943319838
