8201695,1,B000RO9Q7C,"One of the actors told me during the filming of this, ""Its not very good."" Man, he wasn't kidding. Seems like a random group of people with no feature film experience could do better work. Not sure why this company does so poorly. Its almost like they are trying to fail. Don't understand how a company who's made so many films can produce something so utterly dreadful and amateurish.",1433721600,,385,4.594202898550725
8201696,2,B000RO9Q7C,"This has no affilation with the Lundgren-Van Damme films at all, its a clear rip off. The story rivals that of Predator, where a group of Marines are stuck on an island where these super soldiers with super human abilities stalk and kill them. The effects are bad, which is expected from the Asylum, but the film itself is so boring. You barely see the soldiers! Its nothing like the original series its ripping off. So I give it 2 stars.",1421020800,,438,4.419753086419753
8201697,1,B000RO9Q7C,"The cast hits the ground running, and the movie is effectively one long chase scene.  Naturally, the ensemble cast dies off one-by-one.  The actors look good, they all act convincingly, and the some of the scenes do ""work"".  However, the movie is too flimsy and empty of meaning to rate any more than one star.  This movie needs more of a budget, more of a plot, more of a script, more interaction between characters, *everything* more.

The sound is also badly distorted for most of the movie.  I don't know if post-production money ran out, but the sound really should have been fixed.

The movie commentary is bare-bones, with only the director speaking.  The commentary has long, silent spaces which make the commentary a bit boring.  The director's cell phone rings three times during the commentary.

This is a one-star Asylum film.",1278201600,,838,4.838028169014085
8201698,1,B000RO9Q7C,"This is the third in the Universal Soldier series, but has little to do with the first two Van Damme movies.  It has TERRIBLE sound half the time.  I'm pretty sure they did the effect on purpose, but it sounds too much like they had their microphones turned way up.  My ears bled.  Special effects were horrid, and the story was jerky.  The acting.  AWKWARD!  Gosh, I can't write anymore.  Please make the memories go away by not watching this movie.",1200960000,,450,4.469135802469136
8201699,1,B000RO9Q7C,"Yet another bad Asylum movie, look at the negative reviews, and notice that the only positive reviewer is the same guy who writes positive reviews for all Asylum releases. Don't be fooled and buy any of their horrible products that glut the market and attempt to cash in on impulse buyers.",1198972800,2,289,4.686274509803922
8201700,1,B000RO9Q7C,I have seen a lot of low budget features which try to do too much with their limited budget. Universal Soldiers is an atrocity. It features one-dimensional totally unbelievable characters who are forced to play out an alomost incomprehensible plot and premise. It also has bad effects (even for a low budget film)and an extremely tenuous link to the Universal Soldier franchise (if there is such a thing). The makers of this film are exploiters of other films' success and this is certainly Asylum at the top (or bottom) of their craft.,1193961600,2,536,4.836956521739131

Theasylum.cc
Starring: Kristen Quintrall, Dario Deak & Noel Thurman.
Directed by Griff Furst.

Probably the best Sci-Fi done by Theasylum in monthes.
You know, We could argue naming what it is,But let's move on.
The Soldiers are somewhat SHOCK WAVES and shades of Dolph & Ahnuld.
Really liked their individual skills and lack of weapon knowledge,
Kind of evened the playing field.
A lot of chracters that die telling us why they created an ultimate combat tool that's evolving somehow,OMG !
Costumes were Classic Android meets Predator.
Kristin Quintrall was drinking Way Too Much Coffee or something, Truly an energized performance.
Dario Deak needs to be seen again, Great on screen prescence.
Noel Thurman delivers another thankless role,That viewer needs to further plot.
 We see a sequel, Or a prequel would be nice seemed we picked up in the middle of goings on.",1188604800,3,887,5.110344827586207
