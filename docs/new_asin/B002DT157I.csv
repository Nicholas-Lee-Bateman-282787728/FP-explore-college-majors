8365995,1,B002DT157I,Inaccurate seller description. Advertised as Bunny Wailer. Really a DVD documentary about Sexually Vulgar and Gun Violence influenced lyrics with half naked strippers. Tried to contact seller for a trade or refund but was refused. Very limited footage and music of Bunny Wailer. Disappointed and poor customer service from the seller. This is not a roots reggae DVD. Low Class unbearable dancehall rap with strippers. Do not purchase any products from africandiasporadvd-com,1485907200,,474,5.597222222222222

8365999,5,B002DT157I,"ive been sick of reggae + reggae-related films for years that all have bad style, bad sound, bad production value, etc....  im not even talking about the ""vintage"" bad look that looks cool.  im just talking crappy all around.  anyways, this film finally changes all of that.  thank god.  i am actually a documentary filmmaker as well as a touring funk & reggae DJ ( = ready to be a tough sell), and i LOVE this film on every level.  im so thankful someone managed to film this incredible footage and these performances before this time gone and these living legends are lost forever to us because noone had enough insight to actually make a quality film.  the film covers different generations and styles of reggae artists.  the images and sound are extraordinary.  if the filmmakers are reading this, THANK YOU.",1322611200,4,812,4.702127659574468
