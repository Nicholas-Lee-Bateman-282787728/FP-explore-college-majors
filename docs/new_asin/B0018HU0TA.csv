8269774,1,B0018HU0TA,"There are evidently 4 movies in this series; ROLLER BLADE WARRIORS TAKEN BY FORCE, THE ROLLER BLADE 7, THE LEGEND OF, and this piece of amazing, sometimes amusing celluloidal piece of ridiculous rubbish.  If you can find a copy of TAKEN BY FORCE, by all means watch it, as that one is a bad movie laugh riot.  This is the antecedant to TAKEN BY FORCE and is much harder to bear with, however for  those searching for the  very nadir of filmic entertainment, this one would be hard to  beat.

In some sort of post apocalyptic  Los Angeles, hot babes in mini-skirts on roller skates do battle with  the  evil  forces of  Dr.  Saticoy (just who the hell he is we are never to be privy to)and after much pointless coasting around and a Mr. Ranger type good guy and a midget hyena laughing his head off the movie finally winds up---I don't remember where it finally winds up, this movie is so near-marvelously bad that I just can't remember where it goes or how  it winds up, but I don't think any ideas like these are of any salience to the matter at all.

Watch it if you can find it and  don't say I didn't warn you.  For fans of bad  movies only.",1250640000,2,1145,4.251162790697674
