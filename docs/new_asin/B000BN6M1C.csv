8190522,3,B000BN6M1C,"I just received the video Basic Waltz.  The dance couples explained the steps okay.  That is why I gave it three stars.  However, it was boring.  They played the exact same music as they explained the different steps.  There was no variety in the music which helped make it boring.  In addition, they did not appear to me to be very excited or interested in what they were teaching.  As a result, I got bored.  Would I buy another DVD from them.  Probably not.",1291766400,,460,4.380952380952381
