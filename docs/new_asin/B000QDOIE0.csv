8196088,5,B000QDOIE0,"Finley travel videos are great.  Any time I travel someplace and want a video remembrance, they cover everything I've seen in the same way as I remember and have the facts covered in detail.  This California video even covers places I'd like to see there when next I return.  After 25 years of buying Finley travel videos, I'm glad to see they're still being produced.",1357430400,,368,4.630769230769231
8196089,5,B000QDOIE0,"This DVD was very helpful to my family in planning a recent trip to California.  It discusses many regions of the state and is actually pretty current, rather than the old-fashioned production you might have seen with other travel videos.",1212019200,,238,4.95
