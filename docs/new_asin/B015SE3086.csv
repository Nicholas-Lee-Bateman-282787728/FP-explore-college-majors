7452056,5,B015SE3086,It has got to be one of the best instructional targeted toning videos on the market at the present time. From the first minute to the end her passion along with her ultimate professionalisim comes through quite strong. I would recommend it as you won't be dissapointed. To round it off and it's a steal for me is the fact that one of the best Kennedys in the family is starring in it. What could be better!.,1450137600,,407,4.298701298701299
7452057,5,B015SE3086,"Targeted Toning Yoga with Meaghan is exactly what I need! I do not always have the time for a 60/90+ minute class and find her 20 minute segments wonderful. They are challenging enough for long time practitioners and insturcted so well that beginners can get the most benefit. Even on my busiest days I can now get the daily yoga I want and always feel relaxed, calm and focused. A wonderful addition to anyone's practice.",1450051200,2,422,4.64
7452058,5,B015SE3086,i borrowed ths dvd from the library and after viewing it i knew i wanted it so i ordered it.  it has three different workouts that target different areas of the body.,1472083200,,166,4.1875
7452059,5,B015SE3086,I'm so glad I ordered this! Fantastic!,1471219200,2,38,4.571428571428571

7452061,5,B015SE3086,"I have a few Element Yoga discs that I absolutely love! Never thought I'd even give Yoga the time or day because I wouldn't have the patience to put in the time for it but I did! I'm glad I did because this disc I absolutely love! It's broken down into Abs, Arms and Legs. You get to choose how many times you want to do a certain part of the body in whatever order you choose. My favorite always seems to be the Abs! After each workout, there's always a feeling of accomplishment at the end because I feel l put the work into what I've done. Even if it's only 20 minutes, you will still have that job well done going on in your head! Definitely will look into other ones I don't have but this has become my favourite!",1467244800,4,718,4.063380281690141
7452062,5,B015SE3086,I truly enjoy this yoga DVD. 20 minute work outs are perfect for me and I am very sore afterwards.,1465862400,,98,3.95
7452063,3,B015SE3086,Love the beautiful setting of all Elements videos. This videos was set up into three 20 minutes sections which is what I prefer for a home workout. I checked out the abs & core as well as the glutes and thights sections of this video but couldn't watch it till the end because this instructors nonstop instructional talking was very annoying to me.,1465776000,,348,4.5396825396825395
7452064,3,B015SE3086,"I rented this to see if it would be worth buying. I have had over a year of injuries and a mystery fatigue problem. I'm trying to build myself back up, but I think this is too much for me at this time.",1462406400,,201,3.697674418604651
7452065,3,B015SE3086,"I like the way the DVD is set up, how you can pick any combination of practices and it plays them in the order in which you chose them. Very cool. I like that each practice is 20 mins each so you can sneak in a 20 min practice or, 40 or 60 if you want more.
Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of the instructor's teaching style. The transitions between the poses are clunky and her instructions can be confusing, so it interrupts the relaxing flowof the practice. Also, she never shuts the f#%@ up the whole time so it's difficult to relax and clear your mind. Like, ok lady, we get the point, either zip it and let me focus or let's move onto something else. It ends up being a lot of talk and not a lot of substance.
It IS nice to be able to focus on certain areas while giving others a break if you're sore or you want to hone in on a certain muscle group. This will stay in my rotation. Hopefully I can learn it step by step soon so I can just put the volume down, lol.",1462060800,2,967,3.938775510204082
7452066,3,B015SE3086,It is okay.  The exercises seemed more like yoga-lates than yoga.  I prefer yoga.,1461801600,,81,4.714285714285714
7452067,3,B015SE3086,It's just ok...Would be better if the episodes were separated. The workouts are ok. Not the best yoga I have ever done. More for beginners.,1459209600,,139,4.6

7452070,5,B015SE3086,"This yoga video is excellent! I only wish it was not broken into three sections, that being said, the breaks are not overly disruptive. The arms section felt a bit weak compared to the legs and abs, but maybe that shows where I need work.",1452816000,2,238,4.311111111111111
7452071,5,B015SE3086,Excellent and motivating video especially for post baby work out or getting back into shape quick!!! Highly recommend trying this workout.,1451952000,,138,5.619047619047619
7452072,5,B015SE3086,Great DVD,1451088000,,9,4.0
7452073,5,B015SE3086,Outstanding yoga DVD! I am a beginner/intermediate yoga practitioner. This DVD was great for me but also challenging enough for advanced yogis. Lately I haven't had time for longer yoga classes and prefer shorter bursts to maximize my workouts. This video has shorter segments so you can get a lot in 20 minutes or you can watch multiple segments to get an even more intense workout. It's perfect for what I wanted. I have had the pleasure of taking a class from Meaghan Townsend a few years ago and this DVD was just as good as in person. She is an excellent teacher with terrific energy and spirit. Highly recommended.,1450396800,4,620,4.6454545454545455
7452074,5,B015SE3086,"I had the privledge of attending UpDog Meagan's studio in LA for years. I've taken classes all over the world and her 90 min weekend classes are still the best I've ever taken. The whole room which was always packed mat to mat was on a huge high after each class. She is AWESOME. She knows poses, transitions, her sequencing is amazing, she puts safety first and her playlists are the BEST.
Now I'm not in LA I am THRILLED that she has a DVD out. More DVD's please Meagan!!! I HIGHLY recommend this to beginners and advanced students alike!",1450310400,2,540,4.41
7452075,5,B015SE3086,"I was not a yoga person. I tried so hard to lose myself in class instruction, and it was hopeless. I am athletic, intense and it's hard for me to quietly focus my energy... I have had my yoga epiphany. This format makes it easy, far less intimidating and quite relaxing -- and I had no idea that I could get a serious workout via DVD, no less via yoga! Naysayer enlightened -- highly recommend for expertise of instructor, ease with which she transitions between poses, and broader physical and mental benefits. Bring us a sequel, Meaghan -- thanks for a great experience!",1450224000,6,572,4.563106796116505

7452077,5,B015SE3086,I'm an 18 year practitioner and yoga teacher and can say that Meaghan has an amazing advanced physical practice. I've had the pleasure of watching her flow in class and of her coaching of my own practice. She has compete command of her own body and consequently can offer detailed instruction to others. Meaghan has spent meaningful time in education and developing her expertise and now that we live in opposite coasts I'm thrilled she is sharing her craft via video.,1450137600,3,468,4.790123456790123

8734546,5,B015SE3086,I've bought a lot of yoga dvds but this one is by far my favorite one,1491350400,2,69,3.375
8734547,1,B015SE3086,"I am not new at yoga and I have another Element DVD that is decent. So, I expected better from this company. This instructor talks way too much about random stuff. I don't mind instruction, but ramble is annoying. You also don't hold poses long enough to get any benefit, nor is it coherent. There is no flow at all. I've tried several times to use this DVD, and I just can't get through a workout. It isn't hard, it is just frustrating. I end up doing different workouts to tone my body and build strength, that actually work.",1491264000,,527,4.333333333333333
8734548,5,B015SE3086,"This is one of my favorite yoga DVD's, it is easy to follow and as challenging as you want to make it, highly recommend!!",1489881600,2,121,4.083333333333333
8734549,5,B015SE3086,"This is a great DVD for targeting specific areas.  She gives suggestions for making poses more or less challenging.  One thing that I thought was rather unique was that when you are at the menu screen, you select which sessions you want to do, and it puts a routine together for you. For example, if I want to do thighs and abs, I would select those two and press play.  It will start with a very quick breathing intro then it will go through my two selected routines before it ends with savasana. I love the customization!  I also like the fact that she holds the poses for a bit longer than other DVDs.  She gives you enough time to move from pose to pose and get a good stretch. Her voice is very pleasant and calming.  I'm still a beginner, so I'm struggling a little to be able to do everything,  but I am confident that I'll be able to soon. I think this will be one of my favorite DVDs.",1486252800,,893,4.156976744186046
8734550,5,B015SE3086,Very easy to follow and definitely works to help tone!,1478390400,,54,4.5
8734551,5,B015SE3086,"I own a few other Element Yoga videos and I love them all. This one is one of my favorites.  It's a great supplement to my daily workout.  With this video, I can decide if I want to work on my upper body, core, or lower body to coincide with my workout of the day.  Also takes you less than half an hour to have a workout session at home. Being a full time student, this is an essential component. As far as the actual video itself, the intro and cool down are great and the instruction eases beginners into yoga!",1475452800,3,513,4.0594059405940595
