8459777,3,B0056N4S7C,"This video was in our ""Snakes and Crocs"" pack, so it was a double purchase, not something I can really afford to do.  That disappointed me.  The guy in this video is crazy!!!  You could not pay me enough to do what he is doing.",1431129600,,227,4.0
8459778,3,B0056N4S7C,"The Exotic name and picture looks exciting on the box title, and it comes with 2 disks crammed onto the one holder. The movies are quite boring and have mostly BOA encounters after long searching in the weeds ..of other countries. You can learn some things about snakes, but if your looking for something exciting, this was over rated.",1430179200,,335,4.694915254237288
8459779,5,B0056N4S7C,"Classic Documentaries on Snakes, and a bit Dated, but still fun to watch. Especially when the commentator mentions ""For the First time in High Definition Video we explore the world of Snakes"" Sounds rather trite and pretentious, but since this was a show made in the late 1990's, i'll give them a pass on that. Still I reccomend this set for any one who loves and enjoys watching shows about Snakes. The ""Big Squeeze"" is a bit Sensationalistic, but still enjoyable to watch as well.",1420761600,,482,4.682352941176471
