7914484,5,B00001MXWR,I found this video very interesting and think that everyone should watch it. Imagine us not being told this sort of thing I just got taught from the evolutionary perspective at school and that is very biased.,1128643200,,208,4.648648648648648
7914485,5,B00001MXWR,"I have several creationist films, and many are good but very poor from a production standpoint. This one is a very good (modern, excellent graphics) production, and has good information content. Though not as scientifically detailed as some creationists videos (contrary to the evolutionist's mantra, creation can be as scientifically defended (more in my opinion) as evolution, with as much detail as you want to indulge in!) this one is easy for the layman to follow. Very good overview of the creation/evolution debate, without too much ""preaching"". Excellent for a Sunday School class for Jr. High through adult.",1004745600,12,616,5.295918367346939
7914486,5,B00001MXWR,Good comparisin between the two and goes from hand to hand. Shows each side of the story and goes in to great detail. Great one to get for an imformational video.,980208000,3,162,4.258064516129032
