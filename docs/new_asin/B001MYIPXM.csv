3703164,5,B001MYIPXM,"Miraculously, filmmakers Arnie Reisman and Ann Carol Grossman have dodged all the pitfalls of what passes for most documentaries today and have made ""The Powder and the Glory"" a witty, informative, and highly credible look at two remarkable, eccentric, and insanely influential women. Not only do they tell a complex story about the birth of an industry and the driven divas who were its midwives, but they do so through clever animation, passionate witnesses, and well-chosen clips, stills, and music that provide subtlety as well as narrative. Plus -- unlike the real cosmetics industry -- not a single rabbit or other animal was killed, injured, or even involved in the making of this highly entertaining film.",1240272000,4,713,5.155172413793103
3703165,5,B001MYIPXM,"""The Powder and The Glory"" is one of the most entertaining documentaries ever! It is informative without being dry, as all of the featured experts are animated speakers, clearly interested in their subject. And speaking of animation, Grossman and Reisman cleverly use animated sequences to illustrate some of their story. Most importanly, the stories of Helena Rubinstein and Elizabeth Arden are compelling, as well as instructive for anyone considering becoming a marketing genius. This film is definitely worth watching more than once. Buy it!",1240272000,,545,5.5
3703166,5,B001MYIPXM,"I saw this documentary in the middle of the night on a road trip, and it kept me wide awake through the end because the topic fascinated me and it is well-researched. It has more of a true documentary feel than the entertainment-like brand of documentaries often produced today, but the content is well worth it.",1395878400,2,312,4.589285714285714
3703167,5,B001MYIPXM,"If you're interested in the history of cosmetics, this excellent little documentary is for you, whether your interest is casual or more intense.  The information is in depth, but presented in a fun and easy to follow format with lots of interviews with people directly connected to Arden and Rubenstien and scholars familiar with their lives (including the author of Hope in A Jar, one of the best books concerning the history of cosmetics ever written) as someone who makes a hobby of the study of this area of history (often going back to primary sources) I can also assure you that it is impeccably researched and very accurate.

My husband (who is not quite as fascinated with the subject as I am) also found the documentary entertaining and found the tidbit about Helena's manufacturing the camo paint for American GIs in WWII particularly interesting (his favorite area of history is WWII)

I think it could even be an enjoyable watch for a whole family if the children were interested in history.",1391817600,3,1003,4.819767441860465
3703168,5,B001MYIPXM,"I can watch this over and over.  Amusing, informative, and inspirational.  A documentary that should be required viewing for girls who want to be entrepreneurs, queens of their own destiny.",1386633600,,189,5.266666666666667
3703169,5,B001MYIPXM,"One of my favorite dvd's.  I have shared this story with so many people.  Inspirational film of an American success story.  This is why people come to our great country for the business opportunities that free enterprise supplies.  Well done, very enjoyable!",1383696000,,258,5.071428571428571

3703171,5,B001MYIPXM,I saw this on PBS years ago and loved it. I forgot the name of the show and discovered it on Amazon by accident.,1378339200,,112,3.7083333333333335
3703172,4,B001MYIPXM,"Interesting DVD with history of two of the most famous pioneers of the multi billion dollar beauty industry.  This is great to have available, as these two ladies with modest beginnings became household names and cultural icons.  Where there is a will, there is a way.",1368316800,,268,4.804347826086956
3703173,5,B001MYIPXM,Very good documentary displaying the rivalry between the two most important ladies of the make up industry. The two ladies who started all this in america.....,1360108800,2,159,5.153846153846154
3703174,5,B001MYIPXM,Very well done documentary that tells the story of rivalry between Elizabeth Arden and Helena Rubenstein.  Lots of great old footage and very insightful commentary.,1328745600,2,164,5.56
3703175,5,B001MYIPXM,FIRST SAW THIS DOCUMENTARY ON PBS.  LOVED IT.  WANTED TO PURCHASE IT BACK THEN BUT NEVER GOT AROUND TO IT.  THIS DVD CAME WAY AHEAD OF TIME AND IT WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION.,1277769600,2,172,4.151515151515151
3703176,5,B001MYIPXM,"Not only a story of female cosmetic moguls, but a story of women and history.  These ladies gained autonomy as woen gained theirs.",1257120000,4,130,4.6521739130434785
3703177,5,B001MYIPXM,"I recently flew to Europe for an extended stay; I made it intact, my suitcase made it as well, but my makeup bag, which had been in the suitcase, wasn't there then I opened it. I was devestated. Never mind that I had just spent $200 on new lipstick, mascara and face cream (a pittance in this product category), I was shocked that I would have a bare unmade up face to show the world, at least until I replaced all everything. But nothing looked right. I never did replace the lost makeup. For the first time in my adult life I didn't ware mascara or blush. Some Chapstick from the botton of my purse was all I had, more medicine than makekup. My point: Those 2 women, so aptly depicted in the Powder and the Glory, both of them long dead, had manufactured my feelings of horror of a naked face, and the shame of not dressing my cheeks and eyes. I didn't realize I had been taught. I didn't realize by whom until The Powder and The Glory.",1240963200,5,938,4.216666666666667
3703178,5,B001MYIPXM,"I'm a no-makeup kind of gal, so I was a little skeptical about hearing the story of two women who revolutionized makeup for the modern woman.  But the story of two women who built rival business empires and lived their quirky lives just a few blocks from each other (without ever  meeting face to face) was irresistable.  We all need to know more about women who have ""made it"" in a man's world.  And this video was so masterfully done that by the end I felt I actually knew Helena Rubinstein and Elizabeth Arden.  I loved the transitional visual, showing a gorgeous face as a blank canvas that changed over the decades as makeup styles changed.  The occasional animated sequences were witty and amusing - like little ""Betty Boop"" interludes. And I learned a lot - a whole lot - about makeup and the whole mystique surrounding it. Hats off to Ann Carol Grossman and Arnie Reisman for putting this fascinating production together.",1240790400,11,929,4.668711656441718
3703179,5,B001MYIPXM,"If they had only added Max Factor, the filmmakers would have hit the Trifecta with this one. But believe me, I was more than satisfied with just this ""Daily Double"" - Helena Rubinstein and Elizabeth Arden. I felt flooded with memories of that ""MadMen"" era and beyond, with my mother choosing between her two faves - Elizabeth and Helena. Great attention to detail in the visuals, editing and narrative chosen made watching this an extremely entertaining evening. And, for those of us who enjoyed ""Dynasty"" in the eighties, what could be more enjoyable than watching two women go at it with each other - if just professionally. I highly recommend.",1240704000,8,646,4.881818181818182
3703180,5,B001MYIPXM,"The Powder and the Glory first aired in Boston as part of the Jewish Film Festival at the Museum of Fine Arts and a few other venues almost a year ago.  I saw it then and anxiously awaited an opportunity for a second viewing.  This came when it recently aired on PBS.  It was even more interesting than before.  As with a good book, it holds up well to a second viewing.  Many details became apparent that were missed the first time around.  Not only does the film address the primary theme of the birth of the cosmetic industry as well as the conflict between Arden and Rubenstein on many levels (some implied) but it puts them into an historical context reminding many of us of events (both politcal and popular culture in nature) experienced by the previous generation or even ourselves.
  I found this film to be funny, informative and highly recommend it. I consider it to be an important addition to one's collection.  Buy it!!",1240617600,12,933,4.538922155688622
3703181,5,B001MYIPXM,"I first saw this doc on PBS.  It told the history of the two woman, Elisabeth Arden and Helena Rubenstien, who were pretty much the creators of the modern cosmetic industry. As a guy I didn't think I'd be much interested in the subject but my wife was and she had control of the channel changer at the time so we watched.  What I found was a documentary surprising in its humor, unique in it's use of animated sequences illustrating the rivalry of these businesswomen, and a clever use of a very pretty model in make-up style changes bridging the decades these two moguls battled each other throughout their existence.  The interviews were substantive and the interviewees fascinating.  Most compelling to watch were two women creating corporate empires during a time when empire building was an exclusive ""men's club"".  Got a copy for my DVD library.",1240531200,4,851,4.801369863013699
3703182,5,B001MYIPXM,"My beautiful mother wore no makeup. She did not, therefore, introduce me into the world portrayed by Ann Carol Grossman and Arnie Reisman in this entertaining and illuminating film. By the time I was interested in cosmetics. Revlon had overtaken these pioneering women. I learned their fascinating history in this film. I loved how the filmmakers contrasted their histories, ethnicities, and backgrounds as both Elizabeth Arden, upper class Protestant, and Helena Rubenstein, immigrant Jewish, shaped the 20th Century American Woman.

My mother did, however, go to a local beauty parlor every week to get her hair and nails done. As an adult I tried to understand this (Phyllis Ewen's photo essay, BEAUTY PARLOR) and found that this space and time was a place for nurturing as well as for beautifying. Perhaps Helena Rubenstein and Elizabeth Arden understood this in the early part of the 20th century and tapped into deeply felt needs. The Powder and the Glory is wonderful and should be seen by every feminist, beautician, and businesswoman.",1240444800,5,1043,5.171597633136095
3703183,5,B001MYIPXM,"A surprisingly intimate, fun and informative look at the two powerhouse women who created the cosmetics industry as we know it, there's nothing made up here.  Filmmakers Arnie Reisman and Ann Carol Grossman manage to get beneath the surface and show the warts-and-all rise from rags to riches of the world's first two leviathans of lipstick.  Using knowledgeable and witty interviews, clever animation and historical footage, the film doesn't just cover cosmetics, but gives you a glimpse into an entire era, touching on class, religion, feminism and society at large.  Interspersed with the experts, it's fun to see Twiggy all grown up, and Kitty Carlyle Hart (in what must have been her last appearance on film) as enchanting as ever.  It's a charming film and it would be a shame to miss it.",1240358400,3,794,4.947368421052632
3703184,5,B001MYIPXM,"I was happily surprised to find myself hugely entertained by this movie. Very empowering for women to see these two visionaries support women and themselves so grandly! The filmaking was superb, it brought me in to a world I didn;t realize I would find at all interesting. I have often flashed on it as I go through my daily life. I strongly suggest all gendered people would be enriched by this film.",1240358400,4,401,4.583333333333333

8322548,5,B001MYIPXM,"I absolutely had to purchase this film since my recorded copy (done in 2007) did not measure up with my new flat screen TV. If you are interested in cosmetology history,immigration of the early 20th century, nostalgic film footage of New York City, fascinating biographical tales that could never be made up, this film is for you. It covers the lives of these two pioneering icons of cosmetology and the businesses they created and ran from youth to old age. The film relates a fascinating account of the development of the cosmetics industry from the late 1800's to the sixties. You will see Kitty Carlisle Hart, Twiggy, and Lucille Ball, among the many celebrities and historical cosmetologists (like Harriet Hubbard Ayer, Madame C.J.Walker)) mentioned and/or shown in the film It's a shame E.A. and H.R. had a perpetual 'cold war going on between them. Their lives had an uncanny parallel; they had so much in common, yet they refused to ever meet! After she had heard that Arden's racehorse bit her finger, Rubinstein quipped, ""Oh how horrible,I do hope the horse is Ok!"".They referred to each other as ""the lady down the street"" or ""that woman"".
 I do believe what Helena Rubinstein said to be true that if they could had collaborated, ""With her packaging and my products, we could have ruled the world!"".",1441324800,3,1310,4.848214285714286

8322550,4,B001MYIPXM,"Too bad this real life story is only in documentary form .  This material should inspire a  few docudrama writers to write a movie script.  The drama, celebrity and success from rags to riches leaves any fictional story like ""The Devil Wears Prada""  in the dust.  Especially, the bio on Helena Rubinstein whose a self made business woman who ventured alone from the safety of her family's humble small business in downtown Warsaw Poland to the sheep herding ranges of Australia to concoct her lanolin face creams and topping it with as a reigning  legend  of Cosmetic empires in New York City and Paris.",1405814400,2,603,4.740384615384615
