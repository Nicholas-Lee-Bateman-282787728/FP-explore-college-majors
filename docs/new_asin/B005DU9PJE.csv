Whoever was the sound engineer on this should be ashamed of his or herself.  Really, in parts, it is awful and un-listenable. It is too bad because I really would like to hear what is going on as I am sure it would be informative.

In all fairness there is a disclaimer on the back of the DVD itself warning that the audio could get louder or softer during the footage, but what they should say is at times you can hear the audio just fine and at other times it sounds like someone is speaking from inside of a Storm Troopers Helmet.  Inside of the Death Star.  You are back on Earth.  Good luck hearing it, even with the volume cranked all the way up.

Overall I think the material is good...just wish I could hear all of it.",1391731200,4,895,4.138728323699422
