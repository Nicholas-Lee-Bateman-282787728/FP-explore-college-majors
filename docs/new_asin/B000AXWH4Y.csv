8080280,5,B000AXWH4Y,"The second volume of the animation series based on Alexandre Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo contains episodes 5 to 8. This animation series change the setting to future world about three thousands years from now. This blending of sci-fi setting and classical French literature works splendidly. Another major differences with other adaptations of the Duma masterpiece work is the story is viewed from the children of those the count is going to avenge. So the youngster characters such as Albert, Franz, Maximilien, Eugenie, Valentine, Robert Beauchamp are friends to each other at the early stage of the drama. Particularly the roles of Albert and Franz are stressed. These young characters are either swayed, hurt, used by the count's revenge plan. From this volume Count shows his darker side, is creepy as a vampire, yet is mysterious and enigmatic winning trust from major characters including, Baron Julian Danglers one of the targets for the Count's revenge plan. Aside from minor setting differences, the basic plot in this volume is close to the original novel. One of the highlights of this volume is 17-year-old Heydee. Its goddess-like presence and the way she was shocked to find the man who caused her to become a slave is a must-see. From episode 8 the count's plan begins to unfold. I can't wait to see the next volume.

If you live in U.S. or Canada it is therefore recommended to buy Fumination box collection.

8080281,5,B000AXWH4Y,"I really enjoyed this volume, especially Episode 8. The animation in the series is amazing and I'm always impressed at how the costumes are animated to look like actual clothing. I can't wait to get my hands on Volume 3.",1301097600,,220,4.525

8080283,5,B000AXWH4Y,"This has to be the most original, non genre specific anime to date.

Although I wouldn't consider this the best anime of all time, it's certainly in my top 10 list, and I'd go as far as to say that it's in my top 5.

Mahiro Maeda has managed to recreate a classic tale, using a medium never tried before, and pull it off seamlessly. The style of animation is nothing short of breathtaking; there are times when you're so engrossed in the grandeur of it all that you're able to reach that Zen like level that all cinematography strives for, and you find that you've become completely lost in the film. There's even a small feeling of loss when each episode ends, leaving you slightly short of breath.

One caveat: I didn't watch the English version, so I can't really comment on how well it was dubbed. Because this series was so dialogue heavy, the subtitles were distracting at times, but if the dubbing is up to par, I won't hesitate to watch it all over again, because I'm sure that I missed out on a quite a bit by having to read my way through.

The Bottom Line: Not to be missed, even if you're not an anime fan. This is truly deserving of all 5 stars.",1175299200,2,1158,4.273972602739726
8080284,5,B000AXWH4Y,"I absolutely love this series. Out of all the anime I have seen, this is the best of a whole new animation. I saw the previous movies of the 1970's ""Count of Monte Cristo"" starring Richard Chamberlain and the new version of the movie as well. Haidee's godess themed outfit looks beautiful. It moves as if it were alive! This series of course contains mature themes and nudity, NOT FOR THE KIDDIES! This volume gets deeper into the count's plot of revenge. Even the people get too close for comfort get ruined unaware of what he intentionally has on his mind.

Don't miss out on the next series!",1141516800,,594,4.5
8080285,5,B000AXWH4Y,"In the second volume of Gankutsuou, Mahiro Maeda's (Blue Submarine #6) dark twist to the literary classic ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" the story continues to slowly unfold as the Count begins to pinpoint all those responsible for his past. Though this volume contains no action, this series continually gets better and deeper as the intrigue plays out around all of the characters. This series is carried by excellent plotting and it's risk-taking style of animation.

In this volume, the characters face what it truly means to love, as two characters, Albert and Franz, must deal with arranged marriages, while another, Maximilliam, a commoner, finds himself in love with the woman arranged to be married to Franz. During all of this, the Count's wicked games continue, as he spurs friends on to duel, hands over a ring capable of injecting poison, and unites two past lovers in an attempt to bring back terrible memories. This volume reveals a lot of the characters' emotions, enlightening us on two minor characters, Maximilliam and Valentine, who served a brief part in volume one, as well as introducing a couple new characters to the mix of deception.

This series, despite having almost no action to speak of, is one of the best I've seen in a long time. The rich animation and the fact that Mahiro Maeda is willing to institute plot elements such as homosexuality that may alienate those uninterested in such things makes this series more alluring than other blandly plotted anime. Though the reference for this series is considered one of the greatest novels ever written, it takes a great deal of skill to be able to translate that for an anime format. Mahiro Maeda did an excellent job at doing just that. If you haven't already began collecting this, then start now and get both volumes one and two. If you have began collecting this series, then don't miss out on this volume.",1138752000,5,1889,4.845201238390093
