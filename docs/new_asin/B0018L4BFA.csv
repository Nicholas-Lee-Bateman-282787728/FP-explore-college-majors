Clearly she knew nothing about it beyond that, and neither she nor I have heard of the website [...] its creators SyF the Giver and Peter Whatanitch.

It is vital that you understand that this DVD is a collection of videos about these two individuals, not about gaming, or World of Warcraft. They'll talk about World of Warcraft, but that's really not what this is about. As far as I can tell, the DVD is manufactured with the intention that fans of the website can watch a bunch of their videos. That said, if you've never been to the website before or heard of these guys like me, you will find nothing enjoyable in the DVD's contents. I can only assume that since they bothered to release a DVD they have enough fans willing to buy one to make it worthwhile, but honestly, this shouldn't see circulation beyond the group of people with the website bookmarked.

As for the DVD itself, the case and disc are very nicely decorated. The DVD menu on the other hand is annoying in how long it takes to start a video view additional videos. Its a 3D futuristic city where the camera flys around the buildings before anything ever happens, and is probably one of the ""default"" options in whatever DVD authoring software was used to make the disc. The videos themselves are in a poor and confusing order. There is no ""start"" or ""end,"" and no introduction to the website or the culture so you have any idea what the heck you're looking at. It starts with a recorded phone call from some random guy talking about the website, then the next video is a dude talking at the camera and ranting about newbs. From there most of the other videos that I watched (and I really only got a random sampling since I couldn't bear to watch the whole thing) feature either one guy poking fun at the other guy for being too much of a gamer, the ""hilarious"" reaction of one guy breaking gaming news to the other, or sometimes, actual recorded video from the games they talk about. Maybe I was unlucky and only saw the bad ones, but I have zero motivation to look through the rest to see if there's anything watchable.

In short, you had better already know exactly what you're buying before you buy this DVD.",1276473600,2,2325,4.453051643192488
