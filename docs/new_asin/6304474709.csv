886907,4,6304474709,"In a very remote village, the most extraordinary man is made.  A musician of unusual talent and psychic ability.  He is not concerned about fame or fitting into the ""norms"" of his day.  He only knows what he loves  more than life itself, music and Elsbeth.  Very real and moving.  The movie  shows the depths of his suffering as he searches for an unfulfilled  longing.  Not a hollywood happy ending, but leaves one with the intense  feeling of his divinity.  Sometimes violent, but not gruesome, and not  without purpose.  Very emotionally provocative.  A must see!",916099200,3,566,4.821052631578947

This film has also been difficult to find on DVD. If you're looking for it on DVD, please refer to this product and my review there for details:

(Since the product page for that DVD is kind of confusing and bare, I wanted to write here about it being available since this is really the main page for Brother of Sleep...)",1484956800,,562,5.6
7872587,5,6304474709,"I'm really writing this review so that there's no confusion about what this product is. If you're looking for Brother of Sleep on DVD (and maybe there's like two more people out there in the world that are obsessed with this movie as much as I am...), then you know it's 1) impossible to find and 2) expensive as heck if you do find it. There IS a Hong Kong DVD out there but it's really hard to find/get. I had one and it somehow got lost in the void and I was heartbroken. I generally watch Brother of Sleep at least once a year if not more and after losing my DVD I was relegated to watching it on the Youtubes.

So, if you're searching for Brother of Sleep and you come across this product and you think, wait, maybe this is actually a book and it's listed wrong, because it's so cheap and because the cover looks strange, rest assured - this IS a DVD and it IS Brother of Sleep.

There are some caveats before you hurry up and order it though.

1 - It's a Region 2/PAL DVD. That used to be more of a problem for those of us in the US than it is now but it can still be a problem. This is how I worked around it: I had taken a DVD drive out of an old MacBook because I replaced the drive with a SSD hard drive. The DVD drive was converted into an external drive. When you put a DVD of a different region into a Mac, it will let you change the region of the drive a couple times (I'm not sure how many so be careful). But, once you reach that limit, you CAN'T change it again. This wasn't a problem for me since I never really use the drive and especially don't use it for DVDs.

2 - There are NO English subtitles. However, if you google ""Brother of Sleep english subtitles"" you will find a set titled ""5rFF-schlbr"" or something similar. If you download those subtitles and rip your DVD (I used handbrake) with 25FPS (that's the FPS of the subtitles), they will match up perfectly. The only problem with the subtitles is somehow all the letter Ls got replaced with capital letter Is, but that's easily fixable if you're that detail oriented (I am).

After all is said and done I now have a great resolution copy of Brother of Sleep with English subtitles stored on my hard drive that I can stream through Plex and play any time. If that's what you're looking for and you're willing to do a little work, order this here DVD as soon as you can.",1484956800,,2346,4.12472647702407
7872588,5,6304474709,"As Jes said, I too think this may be the most beautiful motion picture I've ever seen.  Wiki says the Germans submitted it to the Academy for consideration as Best Foreign Film, but it didn't get a single nomination.  I am surprised that even those in the arts communities & those members of the Academy, while being more likely to recognize great art which is inaccessible to the Great Bell Curve of the USA for obvious reasons, that even they did not nominate this stunning film.  Only Sophie's Choice and Brokeback Mountain evoked such intense feelings as this movie. The film is about a boy born in the 19th century in a most remote and primitive village high up in the Alps. His newborn hearing of sound does something to him, hearing frightening noise from all sources until (still an infant) hears one note from the tiny church organ in the village.
The love stories in the film (two, one gay, one straight) are really not the central point, however interesting, but the loves and  other cruel dramas depicted serve as mechanisms to propel an organ prodigy to a competition in a large cathedral.  The central character has a Calling to the music of the organ. If you appreciate that kind of music is perhaps the most important consideration for watching this film. But even if you cannot relate  to the organ itself, the opening scene of a
woman and boy climbing up the steep slope of the Alps to the very highest places imaginable as a Bach chorale is sung, reaching it's crescendo as the cinematographer films the highest jagged rocky peaks above and beyond the clouds from
a plane.  Bach is not the only music you will hear, there were at least three other composers including whomever did big improvisation the boy plays in the cathedral, blowing people away, and blowing candles out, literally, the wind from the massive instrument and huge dramatic chords only a large organ can make.  All the intensity of his life, his wife's infidelity, his own experience as an 'outlier' come through an improvisation on ""Schlaff, du Todes Bruder"", the hymn assigned him, ""Death, thou Brother of Sleep"".  One of the most beautiful films ever made... and ignored.  It is deeply 'spiritual' (I hate that word), but it is also implicitly anti-clerical. It is NOT a religious film.  It is not for the vast ignorant masses, it is certainly esoteric, but is so excellent, and so deep on so many many levels. If you have never been moved to tears by classical music, don't watch the film. you have  & if classical works for the Organ especially resonate with you, this is the film for YOU.",1474416000,,2582,4.675496688741722
7872589,5,6304474709,"I enjoyed this movie a lot, then again I think most foreign films kick ass over Hollywood stuff, they just tend to seem more real, down-to-earth. It had awesome scenery and the subtitles don't take away for the film at all. This movie has no makeup, glitz or glamor, just raw human emotion in a raw world.",1076544000,2,305,4.368421052631579
7872590,5,6304474709,"I liked the movie. I do not know about the novel, but I think every piece deserves a consideration in its own right. To me, the film is about how people in solitude, estranged from human society in one way or the other, try to cope with their lives and eventually fail. The movie shows two different instances, Michel and Elias. The former is alienated by his thoughts, the latter by his musical ability. But for all we learn about both protagonists they live outside the village society of Eschberg and have always done so.
The point I see in this movie is rather general. Human society develops a rigid idea of what to embrace and what to ignore, and outsiders and strangers belong very much to the second category. Despite his love and desire, plus that of Elsbeth and Peter, Elias is shown to be unable to enter society, even in its most basic form of a partnership. The only direct communication between Elias and Michel right at this point is a logical consequence to the observer. Do they both feel they are doomed, that it goes downhill from there?
It is left to the spectator to believe that the film portrays the middle ages and similarities to the global village of today are faint. I myself, however, was left disturbed and scared. I think the movie addresses a problem that we face much more today than in the past.
Despite that I am wondering about two questions: (i) Is the point of the movie similar to Albert Camus' The Stranger, and (ii), is the relationship between Elias and Michel modeled after that between Jesus and John.",985824000,5,1544,4.557553956834532
7872591,5,6304474709,"The atmosphere and beauty of this film is exquisite, it is off set brilliantly by the bleakness and violence of the peoples' lives in this lonely Alpine village, and Elias struggle between his love of his music and the love of Elsbeth, I know I am waxing poetic a bit, but it is worth it.",975283200,3,288,4.254545454545455
7872592,5,6304474709,"The last time I saw a movie with an indelibly magnificent photography was in 1965. The film was ""The Sound Of Music"". This one raises the bar on the same level. The love story depicted on this beautiful film is unique...a tale of spoken and unspoken love and its effect. All the actors, including the ""extras"", are doing their parts realistically. The musical score fits like a glove to the stunning imagery. I was magically transported to this place(Echeberg) when I watched the movie !",967852800,3,487,4.741176470588235
7872593,5,6304474709,"Though lambasted by critics in its time, I personally think that this film is destined to be a classic. The ordinary viewer will be appalled by the  pervasive ugliness and filth in the characters and surroundings but the  overall atmosphere is stunningly beautiful. In fact, it is not the visual  quality (ugly or otherwise) that makes this film stand out from the rest  but the involvement it extracts from its viewer not on an emotional hostage  basis but from a longing for a soul mate one acquires which was thought  before to be non-existent. The viewer while watching it is distanced from  the film but it leaves a lingering effect that somehow connects them later  on. I hope this comes out on a DVD transfer very soon.",966729600,2,726,4.661417322834645
7872594,5,6304474709,"I think this is the most beautiful movie i have ever seen. Andre Eisermann does a wonderful job playing Elias Alder..I laughed, I cried..and i cannot get this film out of my mind..stop reading my review and go and watch it!",942105600,5,223,4.463414634146342
