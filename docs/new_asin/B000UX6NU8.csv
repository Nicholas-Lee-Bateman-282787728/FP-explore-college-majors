2926368,1,B000UX6NU8,"This movie started out mediocre, but it did get better over the course of the 99 minutes. The lead role of Bobby Riley was miscast, and really should have gone to a more experienced actor.

Let me start with the negatives. For starters, parts of the movie seemed, confusingly, to be aimed at immature preteen straight boys. We are supposed to find it funny when a married father (of girls) sexually violates a woman? And we're supposed to be okay that the gay brother goes along just to fit in? Voyeurism may not be a physical assault, but it definitely is a deep violation. This film makes light of that, and tries to minimize the offense by saying ""she wanted it."" Classic blame-the-victim mentality. Most disgusting was when all the brothers, even the supposedly responsible oldest brother, burst into laughter during the apology. The joke was lost on me.

If I put that horrifying moment out of my head, there's still lots wrong with this movie. There are too many random extra elements. The movie is told in the form a man narrating his life as if it were a movie. That works okay, but it was distracting when Bobby broke the fourth wall too much at certain points.

The chemistry between the character of Bobby Riley and his boyfriend Andy, is simply not there. It's not believable that Bobby has real feelings for Andy through most of their scenes together. When you hear the commentary, Pete Jones talks about the difficulty of playing romantic scenes as a gay character, which is more proof that he was miscast. Also, to make that relationship stronger, it would have worked much better if Andy had been the catalyst that drove Bobby to come out, and generally been more central to the storyline.

What's good about the movie is the chemistry between the brothers. That truly is believable. They really capture the dynamic of guys who grew up (or grew older, anyway) together since childhood. Nathan Fillion stands out among the cast. He shines as Luke, the inappropriate yet loving older brother who really wants to understand and remain close to Bobby. You can really feel his hurt at being lied to for years, even when he expresses it in an immature way. The scene where Luke and Andy meet works really well. That's where you get the sense that beneath all his confusion, Luke really loves his brother. Mike McDonald, who plays Andy, also gets a chance to show what a really good actor he is.

My overall view of the movie is that it has a few good moments, but is mostly uninteresting. I feel bad criticizing, because I appreciate the fact that a straight mand would write and star in a gay themed movie. I just wish it was a better movie.",1254960000,3,2652,4.610169491525424
2926369,2,B000UX6NU8,"As common place as ""coming out"" plots are in Queer Cinema, the beauty of them is that no two tales of coming out are ever exactly alike. Just out on DVD this month comes a film that tackles the, often, trite theme in Outing Riley. Set in Chicago filled with beautiful shots of the windy city, Bobby Riley (Pete Jones) is an architect who appears to be your average Chicagoan guy who loves his beer, sports and his family --- a close nit bunch that includes 3 older brothers and his little sister.

The little sister, Maggie (Julie R. Pearl), is the principal piece that keeps the Riley family together now that both of their parents are deceased. Maggie stands alone in the family as the sole Riley family member who knows about Bobby's true sexual orientation and because of her unassuming yet pivotal role among the 5 siblings it was the most logical writing choice as the one who knows Bobby's ""secret."" Perhaps because of the choosing of a female character to harbor such surreptitious information, it was also a stereotypical writing choice. Far from originality, at one point Maggie even tells Bobby that she loved him like the sister she never had.

Stereotypes are abundant in Outing Riley, however and thankfully, Bobby's character  was not...his brothers were! Talk about your typical misogynistic wanna be macho homophobic straight men. In addition to their womanizing ways Bobby's brothers were so juvenile you'd swear that these 3 very adult men (at least in age) were the modern day 3 Stooges. The brothers quickly grew tiresome but were crucial to understanding Bobby's predicament.

Such generalization of the brothers was clearly the impetus for Bobby's
extreme masquerade with his family, despite the fact that Bobby shares an apartment with his partner Andy (Michael McDonald) and as a result it is Maggie who eggs on and orchestrates Bobby's revelation. His faade included a beard and even participates in the silly ""boys will be boys"" antics of checking out chicks with his brothers. Predictably, Bobby's ""straight"" appearance and actions are not only deceiving; to his brothers it is down right deplorable when they learn that he is not straight.

Excluding the extreme, yet expected, response from the three brothers Outing Riley overall is neither heavy nor even close to a tear jerker. Instead Pete Jones, who stars as Bobby Riley, wrote and directed the movie, attempts to be comical and quirky while keeping the heart felt moments subtle and short. Even with a few fairly good laughs in Outing Riley, still missing was a genuine nuance of a gay sensibility. Such as when Bobby tells us that he knew he was gay when he ""liked the sweet contrast of soft lips and bearded cheeks the first time I kissed my aunt rose!"" Funny, indeed, but not something that a gay man would mark as a moment of sexual realization. Bobby's narrating went beyond the usual foretelling. Here, his unconventional complete character breakaway shots were partly peculiar, a little documentarish but mostly perplexing and interrupted the slightly interesting flow that the film had going for itself.

As a way to separate Riley as something of an anomaly amongst similar themed films Bobby tells us that his tale is a gay Chicago Irish Catholic story. In film, Bobby's story stands out, somewhat, only because of the context, a 30 something coming out as opposed to the usual late teen/early twenty something coming of age bracket that coming out plots is usually associated with. In reality, Outing Riley is anything but unique for most gays and lesbians are personally very familiar with the cultural war between the religious right vs gay and lesbian civil rights. However, with Bobby being gay and his eldest brother being a Catholic priest Outing Riley's clashing of two worlds within the same family gave the film a bit of an edge. Outing Riley may have fared a bit better if it had spent more time exploring this relationship between the polar opposites. Will blood trump the dichotomy within the Riley family? One of the few good writing choices in this film is that you will have to decide that question for yourself.

Riley is far from the worst or best gay movie you'll ever see but tepidly scores because it isn't a cookie cutter of a saturated narrative. Not to bad for a sophomore effort for Pete Jones (winner of the Project Greenlight competition sponsored by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck). Next time it might be wise to surround oneself with and /or consult with some actual GLBT folk before pen is put to paper.",1203206400,9,4525,4.853626943005182
2926370,2,B000UX6NU8,"I have to give credit to Pete Jones, who wrote, directed and starred in this low-budget 2004 indie, for having the temerity to make a coming-out film when he is apparently straight. And therein lies the rub since Jones doesn't really lend an informed perspective to his protagonist's trying situation. He plays Bobby Riley, a Chicago advertising account executive who happens to be gay and happily partnered. He also happens to come from a traditional Irish-Catholic family, a sister who knows he's gay and three brothers who don't. The movie is primarily about Bobby's struggle to come out to his brothers now that their father has just passed away and the time has come for their annual fishing trip together. While one can envision how Bobby's admission would lead to liberation and tolerance, Jones also superficially belabors Bobby's angst to the aggravating point of making me indifferent to his fate.

A lot of the problem I had with the movie is the predictable and often forced humor Jones employs to ingratiate the character to the viewer. In what strikes me as filmmaking laziness, he goes as far as breaking the fourth wall, speaking to the camera, and using freeze-frames to either provide thumbnail sketches of the principal characters or comment on the action. The set-up with the brothers is also pretty generic as they represent variations on the beer-guzzling stereotypes one would expect from a movie at least forty years older. Two are married - Luke is a pothead with twin daughters, and Connor is a John Sununu look-alike who surfs the Web for porn. Oldest brother Jack is a Catholic priest, which sets him up for the most challenging road toward acceptance. Once the key revelation occurs, the inevitable ramifications at least allow for the film's few honest moments, the most effective being Luke's angry voicemail message in response to what he sees as Bobby's betrayal.

In his acting debut, the cherubic Jones makes little impression as the bedeviled Bobby.

Julie Pearl is forced to play Bobby's sister Maggie as the nagging voice of conscience in order to facilitate the contrived plot conceit that proves disappointing toward the end.

I appreciate how Jones does not wrap everything up nicely at the end, although he sadly uses a stereotypical fantasy swimming number to get his point across. The much-delayed 2007 DVD features a commentary track from Jones, interviews and deleted scenes.",1201996800,9,3385,6.064718162839249
2926371,4,B000UX6NU8,"OUTING RILEY may feel a bit self serving, as though Bobby Riley, the main character of the film, is sitting in a Confessional Booth revealing his secret, and in fact that is certainly the case as the film was conceived, lived, written, directed and stars Pete Jones as Bobby. This may account for some of the awkward sense of some of the dialog: it is difficult to be up front about an issue with a history as embedded as the theme of this film.  But despite these minor flaws, this little film has a heart of gold and a cast of actors who bring it to life in a good way.

Bobby Riley (Pete Jones) is an Irish Catholic closeted gay man living in Chicago with his partner Andy (Michael McDonald). Bobby is being pressured by Andy and by his informed sister Maggie (Julie Pearl) to come out to his family - a good Irish Catholic family of four brothers, a sister, and a dying father (Bob Riley). His facade with his brothers is a mime of voyeurism of 'chicks' and a beer drinking butch life. Each family member has a secret: Maggie can't hold a relationship and is unable to keep secrets; Connor (Stoney Westmoreland) is addicted to internet porn; Jack (Dev Kennedy) is a priest who has problems with the conflicts the church places on his own beliefs; Luke (the always outstanding Nathan Fillion) is a pothead.  Once Maggie decides she must out Bobby, the brothers are conflicted: homophobia raises its ugly head despite the bonds of close family ties. How the family comes to grips with Bobby's being gay, individually and as a family, is the crux of the tale.

This is a fine cast (especially Fillion and Pearl) and the story rolls along at a fine pace.  At times it feels 'dishonest' but that is in the script, not the acting.  This is not a major film, but it just may be a helpful one to families and friends who are curious about the lifestyle of someone who has surprised them with a similar secret!

2926372,4,B000UX6NU8,"Being the avid Nathan Fillion fan I found this on TV and Tivo'd it, not knowing what it was about or what to expect.  It was a little racier than I expected in the language department and I was only going to watch it for Nathan, but I got hooked and enjoyed the movie  quite a bit.  It surely isn't a wholesome and educational film for the children to see, but probably a pretty realistic  view of what coming  out is like in some families.  Well acted all around, and Amazon needs to put Nathans name in a more prominent position for this one, he is the one star going somewhere in this and the only actor I recognized. He is some kind of big darn hero.",1196380800,18,654,4.110236220472441

2926374,4,B000UX6NU8,"I really liked this movie. I thought the movie was refreshingly funny and a very, very accurate take on a Chicago Irish Catholic family. For better or worse, Midwestern values permeate this movie -- the competitiveness, the family secrets, the practical jokes and the assigned family roles from which the siblings have a difficult time breaking free - all ring very, very true. Right from the opening scene, we are introduced to these beliefs: ""People here, they don't stray from the blueprint. You're born, you go to school, you get a job, you meet a girl..."" So much is left unsaid and that's typical among ethnic families. And often they're bound by tradition; ""That's the way we've always done it, fercryinoutloud, why change it now?"" I suspect that some of the low ratings are from reviewers on either coast who `don't get' this important point. (Often, I scratched my head and wondered if I was watching the same movie.) Bobby just wants acceptance and love from his brothers, which seems to be a very powerful motivator for him. There were some laugh-out-loud funny lines.  Maggie: ""So how did you tell your family?"" Andy: (Shrugs) ""Actually, I didn't have to. I did musical theater in high school."" I thought it was a clever double entendre that Luke and Connor chose to meet his boyfriend at Weiner's Circle (one of the best places to get a Chicago-style hot dog). At the end of the scene Andy tosses out the funniest line of the film. But what our esteemed coastal viewers might have missed (because it went unsaid) was that by arranging a meeting with their brother's lover, Luke and Connor were ""checking out"" Andy. They're looking out for their little brother. Totally realistic and endearing. No, it's not a perfect movie by any means. The acting was OK; neither better or worse than other independent films.  There was a bit more T & A for my liking, but hey, they had to get the straight boyfriends in the seats somehow. Some humor was frat boy-ish and therefore not my taste. But any movie that features the city Chicago as this one does and has Steve Dahl playing a lawyer (in a suit and tie!) gets four stars from me.",1194566400,6,2136,4.663129973474801
2926375,1,B000UX6NU8,"Skip this movie. It has no heart, no soul and is homophobic at its core.  If you must see it be sure to listen to the commentary by the producers and the director (all straight). They talk about how they mistreated Michael McDonald (the only good thing in the film) during filming and how uncomfortable everyone was during the male on male kissing scenes. Including how everyone in the editing room dry heaved during post production after seeing two guys kiss.",1194480000,21,460,4.679012345679013
2926376,4,B000UX6NU8,"Bobby Riley is the youngest of four siblings in a Chicago Irish-Catholic family.  With both parents deceased, Bobby retains strong emotional and physical ties to his sister and three boisterous older brothers, one of whom is a priest. His lover, Andy (""Mad TV""'s Michael McDonald) and his ""convenience female date"" (who is actually a lesbian friend), as well as his sister (who already knows he is gay) push him to come out to his brothers, but he has been procrastinating for many years, making the revelation tougher as time goes on.  When he finally reveals himself as gay, they first assume it is one of many practical jokes the brothers have played on each other over the years, and they don't believe him.  Finding out it is true causes different reactions from each brother, ranging from prayerful sympathy from his oldest brother (the priest) to near-rage from his youngest brother.  In an especially humorous sequence, Andy (the lover) accepts an invitation to have lunch with two of the brothers, and has some fun pointing out their prejudices born out of ignorance rather than any actual hate.

Though I'm an only child, I've seen the dynamic in many close-knit Irish or Italian Catholic families, and the characterizations ring very true to me, as does the initial and subequent reactions to Bobby's outing of himself.  After all, if it has taken you 20-30 years to accept yourself as a gay man, you have to give others some time to make the same adjustment.  Original, nicely-done premise, presented in a well-paced, cohesive indie film that looks much better than its budget suggests it should be.  The lead character is played by Pete Jones, who also wrote and directed the screenplay, the second he has filmed since winning an HBO ""Project Greenlight"" competition for amateur filmmakers.

- There is no chemistry between those two gays. P. Jones remains straight during the whole film.
- The coming out moment is so fake. Slides? Who came with such lame idea in plot?
- Instead of fighting with stereotypes, this film confirms 'em.
- Some of the scenes are way too long or out of place
- The type of jokes used in the plot is quite simple (farts? playing with dirty language? maybe good for teen comedy, but not for ""mature"" film)
