190145,5,157252765X,"Many things have been written about Ella Fitzgerald. She is my darling. I have been enjoying Ella's voice and swings for many years now and I just cannot get enough. This video has brought Ella much closer to me. It is  extremely well done and most enjoyable. My only wish is to have seen her  singing ""Love for Sale"" live (I wish that was on the video too).  Anybody will be moved by this Grand Lady's story and voice. Ella is  eternal.",952387200,11,437,4.2926829268292686
190146,5,157252765X,"It's way past time that something like this was released about Ella.  This video contains lots of performance footage from various TV appearances and live concerts.  I was very pleased to find that the emphasis is on live  footage rather than simply on narration with various still shots and  otherwise available, already well-known commercial recordings playing in  the background.  Of course there is quite a bit of narration, but the  emphasis is still on Ella performing.  We even get to see  ""alternative"" performances of some commercially available live  recordings that will be well-known to Ella fans.  For example, there is a  clip of her performing at Ronnie Scott's in London doing her parody of  country music and ""Soul Train"" music.  (It is a different version  from the one on her ""Ella in London"" recording, and very funny.)  There is also a video clip from her performance with Count Basie's  orchestra at Montreux in '79, singing part of ""Basella"" and  trading fours with Eric Dixon and Mitchell ""Bootie"" Woods.  (In  this case, it is the same performance as the commercial audio recording,  but the video gives additional insight into Ella's performing style for  Ella fans.)  I enjoyed the video very much and can highly recommend it to  both casual and hardcore fans (who might already have most of her  commercial recordings) of Ella Fitzgerald.  You will find several new  things here.",947030400,29,1407,5.004347826086956
190147,5,157252765X,"The name alone ... Ella ... represents class. Her magic voice was often breath-taking in quality.  As several of her peers have said: ""She was the best!"" This video tribute to the great lady-of-song is, as it  should be, a moving experience. Miss Fitzgerald's personal life was another  story which included some tremendous sadness.  That is also presented in a  very informative manner. Always the expert, Tony Bennett's guiding  commentary makes this video an outstanding work of art which all followers  of the great lady will fully appreciate and truly enjoy.",947030400,9,563,5.1208791208791204
190158,5,157252765X,"I've seen many different documentaries about Ella Fitzgerald, but this film is the most thoroughly researched, thoughtful and fascinating of all of them. The live performance clips are often very rare and they show the ENTIRE performance clip and not just 20 seconds of it. I would HIGHLY recommend this film for anyone with an interest in the life and music of Ella Fitzgerald, or with even a remote interest in jazz music. This was part of the PBS American Masters series, and you just can't go wrong with it.",1248048000,,511,4.688888888888889
190159,5,157252765X,"""She could swing.  She was a natural""  She was the queen of swing.  She liked lyrics because they could tell a story.

In her lifetime she won 13 Grammy awards, and sold over 40 million records.  Her off-stage life was as interesting as her life as an artist singer.  She loved her adopted son, and supported her extended family with what they needed.  One secret about Ella was her deep concern for children, because of her difficult early years.  She would give grants to children, without any publicity.

Ella Fitzgerald has been my introduction into the wonderful world of Jazz.  The queen of swing, was so talented she could sing many times of genres (big band, bipbop) but she was primarily a vocalist, and a very talented one.

This documentary has some extraordinary footage from different international concerts, and also from different times in her career.  At the beginning of the movie, I really did not know who Ella Fitzgerald was or that she was even known only by her first name (can't really blame me, an engineer), but now I want to hear more music sung by Ella.  I found this American Master's series DVD at my local library",1173571200,3,1143,4.655
190160,5,157252765X,"This DVD is a magnificent review of the life and career of the incomparable jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald!  Essentially a bio flick spliced with spell-binding footage of Fitzgerald in concert at the peak of her prowess as the consummate song stylist, ""Something to Live For"" is a superb showcase of her octave-defying ability to elevate scat-singing to a fine art.  Except for Sarah Vaughan--Fitzgerald's only real rival--no one could touch Fitzgerald's smoothness, her uncanny musical ear and improvisationary skills. Blessed with perfect pitch--it was said that her backing musicians used her voice to tune their instruments--Fitzgerald set a near-unmatchable course, coursing through the swing and bebop eras through stripped-down post-modernist combos and retro.

""Something to Live For"" charts her rise from Harlem beginnings to world-famous jazz diva.  Her musical development is juxtaposed with her often unhappy personal life, which included the early death of her mother (before Fitzgerald was a pre-teen), two failed marriages, her inability to have children, the eventual toll of near-constant touring, along with her willful ignorance of the diabetes which eventually killed her.  At times, you feel as if music was the only thing that kept her afloat--indeed something she truly lived for.  Narrated by the great Tony Bennett, this DVD features a considerable number of wry, funny and insightful interviews with peers, friends and fellow artist admirers (Johnny Mathis, the late great pianist Oscar Peterson)

Ella Fitzgerald has been slammed by some who have found her cool perfection boring, but this DVD makes it clear that she was anything but.  She may have been a letter-perfect recording artist, but her live performances are revelations!  Many of her televised and filmed performances (alone and with other artists) are filled with humor and exceptional warmth.  On the flip side, her stunning versions of ""Lover Man where can You be"" and ""Something to Live For"" prick the heart:  you can actually see and FEEL her pain and pathos.  As filmographies go, ""Something to Live For"" is as good it gets.  Highly recommended!",1163116800,,2137,5.362275449101796
190161,5,157252765X,"This exciting, 86-minute video of Ella Fitzgerald's life and career, directed by Charlotte Zwerin, highlights aspects of her private life and combines that personal story with extensive footage of some of her early performances.  Narrated by Tony Bennett, and containing excerpts from her long interview with Andre Previn, the bio ranges widely in time and place, filling in important biographical information, at the same time that it focuses on her development as a singer.

From her earliest days when she was an aspiring dancer, we learn of her difficulties at home, and following the death of her mother, her possible abuse by her stepfather.  After escaping from a girls' reformatory, she goes on the road with Chick Webb, who mentors her, and following his death she gets the ""greatest education I've ever had""--singing bebop.  Playing the role of a horn (vocally), she learns to imitate its sound exactly, with her perfect pitch, and it is through this imitation of the trumpet that she creates and becomes an expert on scat.

Norman Granz, who became her manager from 1953 through her death in 1997, makes jazz ""classy,"" refusing to allow racial discrimination in the halls where Ella performs, arranging performances of jazz at the Philharmonic, and making his musicians feel important.  Through the Great American Songbook series which he arranges for her, Ella gains many new fans, and her numerous TV performances make her name a household word.

Wonderful clips of Ella singing with Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong (who cracks her up), Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Durante, a Mel Torme so young his voice is still almost soprano, and even in a trio with Joan Sutherland and Dinah Shore, show Ella as a trouper, having fun, enjoying the company of these other famous stars, and always hitting every note.

Though she had a difficult personal life, Ella, as seen here, is often playful, singing wild country and western and a ""soul"" piece at a London concert, a terrific medley of children's songs with Bing Crosby, in which she sings scat while he whistles, and even an amazing tune in which she sings virtually every instrument in the band.

Many of her most famous songs are featured: ""Sweet Georgia Brown,"" ""Misty,"" 1968's ""Summertime,"" ""Lady is a Tramp"" with Frank Sinatra, and ""Azure (In An Azure Mood).""  Showing Ella on the road during her entire 58-year career, this video brings her to life once again and inspires our even greater appreciation.  Mary Whipple",1130025600,13,2472,5.004878048780488
190162,5,157252765X,"Luckily I was able to see Ella In Concert numerous times throughout the 70's and 80's and was honored to have her autograph two L.P.'s by her limousine after a concert she gave at the Junior College I attended at the time in 1972...Ella was kind and gracious and that quailty plus her brilliant artistry really come through and shine in this stunning documentary of her life and incomparable career.  Tony Bennett is the perfect choice to narrate this magnificent ""American Masters"" production and his love of Ella comes through and adds alot of soul to the special.  Performance footage is ultimately what becomes breathtaking to experience and when Ella sings the classic ""Something To Live For"" it is breathtakingly beautiful and completely haunting. The use of concert footage from the various stages of her career show that Ella found joy in sharing her gift with her audience and songs like ""For Once In My Life"" become life experiences that are emotionally engrossing and technically brilliant. This ""American Masters"" special is a keeper so for anyone who loves the legendary Ella get this historical work fast while it is available as this is the definitive work about the life and career of this wonderous and gifted talent...BRAVO ELLA and thank you are all the wonderful years of sublime singing and you are truly missed!!!",1085184000,17,1335,4.955357142857143
190163,5,157252765X,can't ever say enough about Ella Fitzgerald She is truly one of the Greatest Voices that I have ever heard.this DVD Captures so many elements of Her&you can't ever get enough once you are listening too Her Range&the way She handles the material. Highly Enjoyable. Classy like the Lady Herself.,1043193600,6,293,4.88
190164,4,157252765X,"I grew up watching Ms. Fitzgerald in the glass-shattering ""Memorex"" commercials which are included in this DVD. Even at that age her voice was something to behold. The quintessential Ella moment comes three minutes into the DVD- after the credits- as she flawlessly renders the torch song ""Lover Man"" dressed in basic black. This documentary captures Ella's golden era- before the various medical problems. As was mentioned earlier the documentary itself has gaps, as certain years and decades are skimmed over and not all scenes are identified or captioned. But music and singer are stunning, showing a buoyant, incredibly shy woman, beautifully full of figure, whose silky voice positively resonates. There are also clips of a 1979 interview from Andre Previn and marvelous recollections from her bandmates- including one who remembers her being able to break into song on the tour bus and silence all of her fellow musicians. (The song heard is Duke Ellington's ""Azure Mood""). The TV show clips are what you really want to see: performances with Nat ""King"" Cole, Bing Crosby, Mel Torme', Dinah Shore and Joan Sutherland, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and most memorable a parry-and-thrust duet with Frank Sinatra on ""The Lady Is A Tramp"" from his 1967 special. A platinum time capsule of a timeless perfomer.",1036108800,11,1310,5.154929577464789

190167,4,157252765X,"The glory of this documentary is that most of it is Ella Fitzgerald herself, singing and entertaining.  Though it is reverent, it avoids gushing, relying instead on Ella's singing (spectacular, of course) to make the point.  There are bits of interviews with some of Ella's intimates, which shed some light on the person behind the scat singing.
But there are enormous gaps, and I found myself wanting a bit more rigorous history:  what, for example, was Ella up to during World War II?  The documentary skips over this, going from 1937 to 1947 in a single bound.  What was Ella's last public appearance?  The documentary doesn't tell us, and for a baffling moment we're left to wonder how a double amputation could possibly be kept a secret.
That said, the technical quality of the film is superb:  both sound and image are wonderful.  And when all is said and done, a 90-minute retrospective of the greatest singer of the 20th century, with not too much talk and lots of music, is a fine thing.",1003708800,10,996,4.683908045977011

7797912,5,157252765X,"As the greatest singer ever is ignored by Hollywood, this documentary is more that a substitute for the missing ""Ella Fitzgerald Story"". It is mainly based on interviews or people who worked with her or who were close to her and a lot of footage of her performances and appearances in TV shows and news. The documentation is at the same time journalistic in it's best sense and personal. It covers not only her professional live from the very beginning to the very end, but also the private aspects, her disappointments with relationships she substituted by great relationship to her audience, her health problems and the almost secret foundation for children, which the author of the documentary used as a title theme for this production, ""something to live for"".
For all Ella Fitzgerald fans and for those, who want to get an idea of this great personality in music, this DVD is a ""must have"".
I have watched this in disappointing bad quality in you tube and I was very happy that Amazon made it possible to easily ship a DVD in perfect conditions in a very short time from the United States to Germany.",1417824000,,1105,4.671794871794872
7797913,3,157252765X,"That Ella Fitzgerald is a musical treasure is beyond dispute. And the footage is here to prove it-- I can at least say that. However, I am shocked that this was not produced with more sophistication. The biographical information was choppy, there were NO DATES listed on performances, and it is beyond me why they chose to give screen time to some inarticulate sources. This profile is in serious need of editing and/or updating. Those interviews I would have loved to hear more from-- Tommy Flanagan, for example--were not given enough space to be satisfying. It may be that original footage is hard to come by, but the production and narrative of what does exist is flawed. To its credit, while this biographical picture of Ella Fitzgerald mentions political and personal matters--encountering racism during touring in the South, the history of Ella's managers, coverage of her romantic life--a fuller treatment could have added depth. It gives a rosy-tinted view of the singer's life that ultimately feels shallow and makes it seem like her huge popularity was a foregone conclusion. It's important that Ella was a big backer of children's causes, but did this DVD really have to sentimentalize it with a misty-eyed video montage of random children? I would have been happier with more Chick Webb and Dizzy Gillespie and less Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra. However, it's also clear that Ella loved to ham it up, and her sense of fun comes across. ""Ella Fitzgerald: Something to Live For"" is biased towards Songbook and scatting Ella as the most dominant era of her career--disputable--and at any rate this view doesn't give as well-rounded a picture as it could.
  I've done a lot of complaining, but I am grateful for some of the footage I had never seen: if you are considering this DVD, it is worth it for so many stellar live performances and to hear Ella and Nat King Cole and Ella and Mel Torme duet together.",1405900800,2,1918,4.826747720364741

7797915,5,157252765X,"A friend recorded this video from PBS many years ago.  I've watched it so many times that the magnetic tape was beginning to wear and affect the quality of the image.  I teach music in school and have shared the video with them.  They always enjoy it and learn a lot about the development of jazz over the years.  I was so thrilled to find that the video was on DVD! Now I and students will continue to enjoy Ella, the best singer of the American Songbook that ever was!",1377043200,,470,4.188888888888889
7797916,5,157252765X,"When I watch video documentaries, so often I am disappointed.  Especially about musicians.  I have actually seen entire bios on musicians where you don't hear one bar of their music.  This is the exception.  But I didn't realize when I ordered it, that it was an American Masters, and they tend to be very good.

It is not only an excellent documentary, detailing her life with interviews of friends and other musicians, but it is chockful of excellent performances.  As a devoted follower of Ella, I was especially happy to see them well document the evolution of her style and voice.

The video starts with the childlike ""A Tisket, A Tasket"", progresses to some nice swing and ballads, and they explain where and how she starts bebop and scatting.  You watch as her skill level grows, where she changes from simply singing the song with a few flourishes, and see when she gets to the place where she exhibits her rare skill of strong yet simple interpretation.  I remember an famous sculptor saying, you imagine what you want, and pare away everything that isn't it.  That is how Ella sings - she constructs her music so carefully, so perfectly, and with such thought.  Finally you are left with singing that has the purity of water, the sound of an instrument, the soul of a woman that's lived life, and the beauty of great art.  She finds the heart of a song.

But the main reason to buy this are the classic performances here - Summertime, Misty, her German concerts, singing with Nat King Cole and Teddy Wilson's piano.  A lot showing her humor, such as the one in London where she sang a variety of styles and the one with Joan Sutherland.  And even a rare one showing her dancing, which she does pretty well.

I should say I cried throughout this video.  I freely admit, I always cry when I sit and listen to Ella.  Partly because her voice is so beautiful, and partly because it's sad to think that it's gone now.  Fortunately we have works like this to enjoy and bring back her back to us, if just for an hour and a half.

I highly recommend this video.",1309824000,2,2063,4.494623655913978
