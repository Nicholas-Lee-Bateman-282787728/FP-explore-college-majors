8533192,5,B000FZETWU,I purchased this item not for the DVD but for the yoga gloves and footies.  I find they work really well and are comfortable to wear.  I am a size 6 and the one size of the gloves and footies is good for me but if you had large feet you might find the elastic strap at the back a little tight.  I loved this product so much I bought 2 extra sets as it used to be sold direct from Giaam and now they no longer do it and it is difficult to find.  I have recommended it to friends in my yoga class.  The srvice from the seller was good and fast.,1316649600,2,542,3.719298245614035
