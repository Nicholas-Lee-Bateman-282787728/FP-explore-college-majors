3742813,5,B001P8M9FK,"The Steinway company is the only piano manufacturer to be responsible for virtually every important innovation in the history of the instrument, to continue to build their instruments by hand, and to command a lion's share of concert houses in the world.  Their instruments are capable of being passed down through generations of family, and then rebuilt, to continue their incredible lifespan.  With all due respect to the few other well-known pianos, some venerable, there is no other instrument maker in history to challenge the above statement.

Considering economics, and the natural tendency to find cheaper and faster ways to produce pianos, it is not surprising that today's Steinway finds itself a relatively high-priced and outnumbered item on the floor of even Steinway stores, who have scrambled to display their own lesser-priced brands, as well as the competition's instruments.  ""Note by Note"" is a relatively non-technical, layman's appraisal of the building of a model D Concert Grand, and it is narrated by classical and jazz Steinway artists.  However, the greatest appeal, in my opinion, is revealed in how this piano continues to be sought after by families, students, and elder statesmen of varying nationalities.  This video is a clear and enjoyable indication of what goes into the making of a superb instrument, and a strong reminder of how much our culture needs icons of surpassing excellence and timeless value, unthreatened by modern demands of greater volume and lower price.  Its statement to this effect is enjoyable to non-musicians as well as those who play the piano.",1255737600,11,1602,5.234375
3742814,5,B001P8M9FK,"Anyone with an interset in piano music needs to have this. Wonderful. This DVD gives an insight into the people, their philosophy and their dedication to building a work of art--the Steinway Grand.

3742815,5,B001P8M9FK,"The title may be a little misleading, read as an 80-minute informercial, but it's not (disclaimer -- I prefer Kawai to Steinway).  Instead, the movie is a touching and educational flick about the making of pianos in the heart of NYC.  It celebrates the soul inherent in the handmade object.  Personal stories are interspersed throughout, keeping us emotionally attached to the tradesmen who are part of the piano making process and the accomplished pianists, both young and old, who act as consumers.  My favorite part is when one of the pianists explains how he first became enamored by the piano through watching Tom and Jerry cartoons and he plays a flamboyant rendition of a Liszt piece that will give you a good chuckle.",1253923200,22,725,4.869918699186992

And to see and hear from these multi-generation craftsmen, creating such a unique and magnificent instrument - every one is different. Extraordinary expose of how the Steinway concert grand is made... For a mere $120,000, you can have one, too... Have watched it a number of times - still amazed...",1463616000,,399,4.882352941176471
3742886,5,B001P8M9FK,"Even the title of this documentary makes the musician/musical enthusiast feel very special. I returned to my original upright piano after a 30 year break with great longing, but this documentary makes you feel extremely special to play any type of piano. More importantly, this underscores the importance of tradition, craftsmanship (European influence) into American enterprise. You are so proud to be an American when you watch this because the skills have been handed down successfully for more than a century to create the most desired piano in the world. It also points out that when you may feel threatened by foreign competition with the proper leadership, with a nod to nepotism (unbroken pride), and staying the course of detailed manual craftsmanship you will succeed. It certainly makes companies that move abroad appear short-sighted,selfish and stupid. The motivation behind this enduring enterprise gets revealed time and again: determined excellence over profit, manual precision over mass production. When you love what you do and you put that love back into your work, like the guest pianists (Connick, Lang Lang et al) in brief performances, you succeed magnificently. I think the makers of this documentary which follows the L-1037 Steinway from birth to completion make it clear how each craftsman, each Steinway employee hits the right note of excellence to contribute to the Steinway legend.",1461196800,,1413,5.3408071748878925

It does follow the making of a Steinway piano but the sections on piano building are disrupted by vignettes of discussions about piano playing and selection.

3742986,5,B001P8M9FK,"Some reviewers have given negative reviews of this video because in this 80-minute video they did not learn how to make their own piano.  This is not a ""how to make a Steinway Piano"" video; this is a a video about how Steinway pianos are made.  That difference should be clear.  As this video points out, it takes perhaps a thousand man-hours of labor to make a Steinway.  Many of the skills involved take years of apprenticeship and experience to master.  Do not expect to learn those skills and techniques in an 80-minute video.  What you will learn from this video is a sense of the quality and craftsmanship that go into a Steinway.

This video is mostly a series of interviews, of short vignettes, with many of the craftsmen at Steinway and many of the pianists who play Steinway pianos.

There's a wonderful short interview with a man whose job it is to install the cast-iron plate into the piano.  He tells of how he once got to go to a concert at Carnegie Hall.  After the concert, he said, ""That is MY piano.""  Of course, he didn't mean that he owned the piano; it doubtlessly belonged to the hall or the artist or maybe to Steinway.  He went on to assert that he helped build that piano.  How could he tell without examining the instrument?  ""I know the sound of MY pianos,"" he explained.  He used the word ""my"" in the sense not of ownership but in the sense that a parent may use it to refer to a child who has long-since grown up, left home, and made a success for himself, ""That's my son.""  Clearly, he saw the piano as almost a child of his.  And, as any parent would be, he was so proud to see his child on stage at Carnegie Hall.

I was delighted to watch this video and get such a tour inside of such an amazing factory.  I really felt that I got a sense of the feeling, the energy of the place and of the people who make that energy happen.

If you're interested in Steinway, if you're interested in pianos, if you're interested in music... or if you're interested in factories and would like to see one extreme example of a very successful one, I'm sure that you will also find this a five-star pick.

If, on the other hand, you want to try and make your own piano?... not so much.  Oh, and, ah... good luck with that.

One of the people interviewed in this video is Franz Mohr, now-retired former Chief Concert Technician for Steinway.

Instead the film is a series of vignettes about the craftsmen who make the pianos and the artists who come to Steinway Hall in NYC to select pianos for concert performances.  There was endless waxing rhapsodic about old-world craftsmanship and about how each hand-made piano has its own individual character. And there was great footage of pianos being built. But explanation of what the craftsmen were doing in that footage was seriously lacking.  I came away having learned nothing new.  The documentary is pleasant to watch, but ultimately it's a waste of time. I agree with the reviewer who described it as a Steinway infomercial.",1376438400,3,682,4.913043478260869

In between are segments showing the hundreds of operations and checkpoints of its construction process. Along the way, the craftsmen who build and tweak the piano's components are interviewed. The performers who will play such an instrument tell us what they look for and how their playing style affects their choices. All share a passion for what they do and meticulous care in how they do it. The scenes of the historic Steinway factory are interesting for its sheer size, and for the depiction of old-fashioned, hands-on craftsmanship that builds pianos with individual personalities.",1364947200,,761,5.0476190476190474

3743063,3,B001P8M9FK,"The film certainly did what it set out to do ... documenting the making of a Steinway piano. There are numerous scenes depicting the various steps involved, and we get to hear the various workers talk about the pride they take in their work. We also get to watch a few notable pianists choosing their special Steinway for their special concerts. However, none of it drew me in emotionally, or really got me engaged in the documentary or story. Maybe if I were a pianist I would have enjoyed it more. Oddly, I didn't even find the music in the film to be particularly memorable. The only scene that was somewhat memorable was the scene of the family purchasing a Steinway so that the elderly grandfather, a pianist, could enjoy hearing his grandson playing. That was a lovely scene. Otherwise, the film somehow did not draw me in. It wasn't bad, just not particularly interesting or memorable.",1348272000,,892,4.687898089171974
3743064,3,B001P8M9FK,"Very interesting and worthwhile film.  It's amazing to see how a Steinway is made.  I have to be honest. . .  I found it a bit ""slow"" in several parts. . . . but. . . nonetheless. . . .still very much worth watching.  Part of the film shows different pianists selecting the ""right"" piano for them.  This is where it really ""slows"" for me.  FYI, it shows that this film is ""starring"" Harry Connick Jr.  That's really not true.  He's in it, but only for a few minutes.  Personally, I think it might have worked a little better if he had been the ""guide"" all the way through.  But the film follows one piano from beginning to end, so it probably wouldn't have been possible to have someone like Harry Connick Jr. do it, as it takes months and months.  But they could have filmed it showing the process without using the same piano all the way through.  In the end. . . I really wanted to see the piano find a great home and live ""happily ever after"". . . . and >spoiler alert< . . .  That doesn't happen. It just ends.",1345334400,2,1015,4.143589743589744
3743065,4,B001P8M9FK,"I've seen this excellent documentary twice and really was delighted and touched by it. I think the real beauty in the film is how it shows how this amazing and diverse group of New York craftsmen proudly labor, for over a year, to make these instruments. You realize that a Steinway, for that reason alone, is an almost sacred thing. I don't think I'll ever take the instrument for granted after this. Also fascinating is that every instrument is made with painstaking adherence to extremely precise standards and measurements, and yet, somehow, they all end up with different characteristics, enough that a good pianist will quickly reject a $100,000 piano and then favor the one next to it. Beautifully shot and paced, it's a mesmerizing film.",1328140800,,745,4.920634920634921

The Making of Steinway L1037 is one of those experiences that give back what you bring to it.  Having grown up taking piano for more than a decade, it rekindled memories of all that joy one feels with the vibration of thunderous sound echoing from the wood frame while playing something good.  The movie is both a documentary about the human process infused in the production of the Steinway concert piano and also the human connection to the spirit of the piano itself.

This movie is not to be missed.",1323561600,,652,4.355371900826446
3743068,4,B001P8M9FK,"Addendum to Description

I enjoyed watching ""Note by Note: The Making of a Steinway.""  I always have admired and respected the Steinway name; however, the description of the manufacturing process of the piano is rather misleading.  Yes, the piano uses better quality materials and relies upon more handcrafted construction than many brands, but they certainly are not ""The most thoroughly handcrafted instruments in the world.""

For one example, Bsendorfer pianos (made in Austria) take several years from beginning to end, not just one year, to build.  The quality of the materials and the very careful, long process of creating this superlative instrument account greatly for its much higher price than the Steinway.  From my experience having played upon both Steinway and Bsendorfer, I hear a discernable difference in quality.

Incidentally, I have played on L1037; and while better than cheaper pianos, I was not particularly impressed with the sound or touch.  My Bsendorfer, in contrast, has such a responsive touch and wondrous tone that it is though the piano is asking me, ""I have responded superlatively to everything that you have asked me to do.  Can you do more?""

Returning to the film and the DVD, however, it is well worth watching for any person interested seeing the too rapidly dying art of hand-crafting fine instruments (or any other material product, for that matter.)",1318291200,,1392,5.174107142857143
3743069,5,B001P8M9FK,"I do not play the piano. I know nothing about it. Yet this documentary fascinated me because it presented individuals on a daily quest for beauty and perfection. I admired the piano technician's dedication to his craft and his patience in dealing with various artistic temperaments. Even though he wasn't himself a concert pianist, he was a primary collaborator in the creation of spectacular music. I was mesmerized by the diligence he and the featured pianists possessed in fine tuning every single detail of a piano in order to create everlasting art. If there is anything that this documentary showed it's that art is hard, hard work. Art isn't created out of a void. Neither is it a miracle. Art is the product of human sweat and tears.",1313020800,,741,4.796875
3743070,5,B001P8M9FK,"NOTE BY NOTE is a documentary that is not a documentary: it is a love story the begins with the initial choice of wood form Sitka, Alaska, through the multiple aspects of creating the case, the soundboard, stringing and creating the hammers and pads, and finally the tuning of the piano before placing it before the public wither for sale or for storage in the Steinway Headquarters in New York for pianists to select for performances in the New York area.  Each step of the process introduces the craftsman responsible for particular aspects of the building of this near sacred musical instrument: it takes a year to handcraft a Steinway piano.

Each step of the process of creating the piano, here the selected piano is numbered L1037, is explained and demonstrated but that is where this film is so very unlike other films that attempt to achieve the same 'this is how it is done' process: this is a story of a 'lover' passed from person to person until the wooden and metal and pad-filled 'box' is presented to the hands of a variety  of musicians for the acid test.  Throughout the film we are in conversation with such pianists as H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Grimaud, Pierre-Laurent Aimard, Lang Lang, Harry Connick, Jr.  and Hank Jones. But the real radiance of this film directed by Ben Niles is the series of tender tributes each of the workers adds when attempting to describe how working to build a Steinway is as rewarding an occupation as possible.  This little film is a quiet love story and very awe inspiring.  Grady Harp, July 11",1311811200,5,1539,4.720149253731344

3743072,5,B001P8M9FK,"This documentary chronicles the manufacture of a single Steinway grand piano. Of course it isn't, and does not pretend to be, a comprehensive technical manual on the materials and techniques required to produce a complex musical instrument costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. Rather, it is an overview of several of the processes involved in the extremely time-consuming manufacture, adjustment, tuning and testing of the instrument. The people who work at the Steinway plant are racially and nationally diverse, and what they do there, year after year, decade after decade, is so obviously a labor of love. They are patient, perfectionistic craftsmen and women. Steinway makes 2,000 pianos a year to the 100 per day made by other companies. The techniques at Steinway haven't changed much in the last century. And the old-world philosophy produces instruments that musicians of the highest caliber love to play. Steinway still tunes their pianos aurally as opposed to electronically. It's a multistep process requiring multiple tuners, and it requires hours to accomplish. That kind of devotion to quality applies to every aspect of piano creation at this company. And finally, when the piano is rolled into the concert hall, that quality is audible, and the perfectionism can be heard.

Steinway went through a period some years ago where an old-fashioned woolen-felt bearing (one required for every key) was replaced by a Teflon bearing. That caused squeaking when the note was struck. Fortunately they saw the error of the ways and returned to the traditional material.

This documentary should appeal to almost everyone, children included. It's about art, and craft, and care--and, really about the creation of art through its physical tools, i.e., its instruments; and through the soul of the artist.

Unfortunately, creating by hand seems to be a dying breed - make way for technology...This emphasizes the need to preserve classical music and an appreciation for this marvel, the piano.

I am in awe of the dedication and craftsmanship of all the people involved. I also loved the snippets of conversation with such pianistic luminaries as Hlne Grimaud and Pierre-Laurent Aimard, as well as jazzmen Marcus Roberts and Harry Connick Jr. But mostly I was fascinated by the craftsmen.

3743109,2,B001P8M9FK,"I enjoyed this documentary thoroughly, and watched a few of the special features.

But this is a movie for people who are Steinway fans, not necessarily for critical listeners. By ""critical"" here I mean those, for example, who realize there is a difference between European and American Steinways. I mean people who understand that Beethoven never played on anything like a modern piano.

The American Steinway manufacturer is making a virtue out of a necessity: If they stay with ancient manufacturing techniques, have a factory where a number of the workers can't communicate with other workers because they don't have a common language, then the quality is bound to vary between instruments. Hence the need for a huge basement in NY where professionals reject piano after piano, looking for one they want to play. A piano being distinctive doesn't necessarily mean it's good, and that's what the film (and Steinway) imply.

I own a very good piano and work on it. I have considered buying a new piano, but never a Steinway. Its ""safe"" sound is dull and powerful (for performances in orchestras on huge stages) compared to the original instruments Mozart, Beethoven and Chopin played on -- and compared to other (more expensive) modern pianos.

(I suspect none of my negative reviewers here have played, for example, a harpsichord. Or a clavichord. Mozart and Beethoven certainly did.)",1280620800,3,1387,5.0701754385964914

However, if your expectation of this video is thatyou will know: 1) how a piano is made from start-to-finish, and; 2) what differentiates a Steinway PIANO from other piano-shaped instruments, I think you may not be 100% satisfied.  Owning a Steinway and having been to both the factory and Steinway Hall, there is a lot that this film is NOT.  If you want to know about the heritage of the Steinway, if you want to see the generations of ethnic workers carrying on a tradition, you will probably like ""the story"".  It is also a bit of an ""infomercial"" for Steinway, but I'd hope they wouldn't use it as a primary sales tool!  So - if you are passionate about the piano or music and you want to add something to your library --- go ahead and it's probably worth what you'll spend for a USED copy (getting one in the library or renting it would be a better aproach).

The process was completed at speed, because the wood for the iconic curve was about ten layers thick- still loose- the glue still wet.

This film starts with that process and spends a lot of time with the men and women that build pianos. That's all you need to know.

Especially noteworthy was the explanation of how the stringing and tonation happens.  At the end of the video, we see several musicians who come in to choose their piano. What's even better - they play a few bars for us.  Who knew there was so much variation?

It gives contributions from many perspectives: some technical stuff and history, some personal stories from the workers, statements from the Steinway bosses and various artists. But everything halfheartedly mingled together, without any deeper interest for anything.

Obviously supported by Universal Music, it features some sounding names like Lang Lang or Helene Grimaud. But after the film you think by yourself: is this the creme de la creme of the current classical pianist scene? And you think with nostalgy about charismatic figures like Horowitz, Rubinstein or even Glenn Gould.

It also could have been a fascinating film with the focus on the pure technical sides if it would have followed this path with curiosity and interest, or with the focus on the staff which also would have provided enough material for an interesting portrait.
