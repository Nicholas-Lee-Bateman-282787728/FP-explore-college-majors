2352175,5,B000A2X0LE,"Though this DVD has not been released yet, I am 100% positive that it will be an awesome collection of matches. The Undertaker has had an amazing career and I am extremely looking forward to this. If you are an Undertaker fan, this is a must have. For those new to wrestling, I highly recommend it, if you want to see part of the very long history of the Undertaker. It may not have all his matches, for that would truely be a 10+ DVD set, but I'm sure this will be great none-the-less. I'll give a full review on the DVD once I receive it.",1121644800,,540,4.10377358490566
2352176,3,B000A2X0LE,"A good supply of matches, unfortunately most ""old school"" Undertaker fans (like myself) may find this disappointing. Most of the matches are from the late-90's through 2000s. In other words, when every other match was against the same wrestlers (Kane, Mankind, Rock, Stone Cold).

Frankly, I mostly stopped watching wrestling after the early 90's, and most matches from a supposed ""history"" of The Undertaker have been left out, at least from the main part of his career. I think a full disc of ""black & grey"" era would have been nice, but unfortunately, his entire Halloween era is put down to one disc, leaving the rest of the set as the Satanic/Biker angles.

I can however recommend the ""Buried Alive"" match, and the Wrestlemania XX-Kane match as at least ""trying"" to regain some of the magic of the good stuff.

In short, I probably won't buy it, but feel free to, if you haven't seen these matches. Recommended for newbies.",1121472000,,929,4.79375

2352179,5,B000A2X0LE,"I am really digging the DVD Sets that have come out lately with WWE Superstars. However, the Undertaker's DVD Set is a prime example of what the WWE should NOT be doing. You see, the third disc of the Undertaker collection is ENTIRELY matches that people can find on other DVDs, such as No Mercy 2002, Vengeance 2003, Survivor Series 2003, etc. While not everyone will collect every WWE DVD, many diehard wrestling fans do own DVDs that have many of these matches already on them. For example, I have the 2 disk vault set of Shawn Michaels, where the first Hell in the Cell match took place. Granted, there's going to be some great matches on this set, especially the early stuff. However, I personally wish they could've done some extra matches on Smackdown, or other rare matches like Taker vs. Hart from One Night Only (probably Taker's best match ever). They should also include the Survivor Series Debut from 1990, and instead of the abomination that is Yoko/Taker from RR 94, they should have the rematch from Survivor Series 94. Also, where is the Undertaker's finest moment when he faced and defeated Sid at Wrestlemania 13? What about his Four Star Match with Vader at Canadian Stampede? How about some 1991 Matches vs. the Ultimate Warrior? What about his rebirth at Judgment Day 2000 during the Ironman match with Rock/HHH? Couldn't that be an Extra? Shoot, why not throw in the 6 man Hell in the Cell from Armaggedon 2000 when he tossed Rikishi off the Cell?  See, this will be great, and I will buy it for the older stuff. But they could totally throw in some great stuff if they really wanted to, and drop some of the dead weight that's ALREADY on DVD. The only way these matches could be redeemable is if Calloway himself does commentary with JR or something like that. Otherwise, the last disc of the collection could be disappointing. We'll see, I suppose.",1120435200,2,1873,4.641566265060241

I do hope to see  some pre-Undertaker stuff such as his matches when he worked for Jerry ""the King"" Lawler in Memphis as Mean Mark Calaway and the Old WCW days. His First Match in the WWF with the Million Dollar Team at Survivor Series 90, his First WWF Championship Title win over Hulk Hogan at Survivor Series 91, and all of his other WWF/WWE Title wins. His Casket Match History, His Hell in the Cell History, and his 13-0 Wrestle Mania Record. We should get to see some of his biggest rivalries such as Hogan, Yoko, HBK, Mandkind, Kane, and The Only Big Thing Brock Lesnar.

2352265,5,B000A2X0LE,"A most comprehensive look at the Undertaker's legendary career--originally released back in 2005, ""Tombstone"" covers many of the highlights and the most important matches; i.e. the first complete match from Disc 1 is Taker's battle with Hogan and at the time, what must have been considered a huge upset as the Dead Man captured his first World Title--albeit his reign was short lived, as--if my memory is correct--Hogan recaptured the gold a mere 6 days later.

Of course, the very earliest parts of Taker's career were spent feuding with stiffs who would hardly bring out the best of the Dead Man--names like Giant Gonzalez, Kamala and King Kong Bundy come to mind. So, many of those early programs Taker had get skipped over until the introduction of perhaps the Dead Man's greatest opponent, Mankind--better known as Mick Foley.

I'm sure whenever great Undertaker/Mankind matches are mentioned, most will go to the famous or maybe ""infamous"" Hell in a Cell Match--although my personal favorite has always been ""Buried Alive '96.""

There's also great matches with the likes of HBK, Triple H, Kane and many more. Overall--if you're a Taker fan--this DVD set is sure to please.",1438041600,,1179,5.035897435897436

2352337,5,B000A2X0LE,"This is probably the best Undertaker DVD released so far that takes you through the history of the Lord of Darkness himself. With it being released in 2005, the DVD begins with a recap of Undertaker's debut at the 1990 Survivor Series and ends at Wrestlemania XX

Disc 1 focuses on the early part of Undertaker's career, from 1990-1996 as the eerie Funeral Parlor/Deadman. Feuds focused on in Disc 1 are Taker's feuds with Hulk Hogan, Yokozuna, Diesel, and Mankind, and Bret Hart. Taker's matches with Hogan, Mankind, and Bret Hart are the best featured on this disc. His match with Yokozuna became more one-sided and his match with Diesel was slow and somewhat boring. Extras feature segments and promos leading up to his matches with superstars covered on the first disc. There's also a bonus match with him fighting Bret Hart at the UK, One Night Only PPV

Disc 2 focuses on the latter part of Undertaker's career in the late 90s from 1997-1999 as the Lord of Darkness to his transition in 1999 as the Satanic Ministry of Darkness leader. His feuds with Shawn Michaels, Kane, and The Rockare covered in the second disc. After costing him the WWF Championship against Bret Hart at SummerSlam on the last disc, we open with a match between Undertaker and Shawn Michaels at In Your House: Ground Zero, that would eventually lead to the first Hell In A Cell match as well as the debut of Kane. We later see Undertaker as WWF Champion defend the title against The Rock

The final disc of this 3 disc set sees Undertaker metamorphosis into the bike riding American Badass/Big Evil. On this disc from 1999-2004, Undertaker's feuds with Stone Cold Steve Austin, Triple H, Hulk Hogan, Brock Lesnar, John Cena, Vince McMahon, and his return as the Deadman at Wrestlemania XX to fight Kane are featured. Every match offered on this disc is great. My favorites are his matches with Steve Austin, Triple H, and Brock Lesnar. Those were the top best of the 7 offered on this one!

Overall: This is an amazing Undertaker DVD set that features some of Undertaker's most prominent matches from his career under each of his gimmicks. They do the best to put only Undertaker's greatest matches on here and they don't fail, although I feel there were a few missing that should've been included such as his WWF Championship bout with Stone Cold Steve Austin from the 1998 SummerSlam. Nonetheless it's a great DVD and whether you're a general wrestling fan or fan of The Undertaker, there's no reason you should not have this DVD set in your collection",1398384000,,2533,4.711060948081264

The Undertaker has always been in the rotation of my favorite wrestlers. He is a spectacular performer and probably the best in-ring storyteller in the business today. Watching these matches reminded me of just how great wrestling once was and how much I miss the old days.

You're going to get a ton of killer matches, including the match that truly began the attitude era (Bret Hart vs Undertaker for the WWE Championship, with Shawn Michaels as the special referee, Summerslam '97). You also get to witness the first Hell in a Cell match, the first Inferno Match, etc. Historic moments that are impossible to forget.

My only dislikes about this Undertaker DVD set is: 1) I wish they had more of his early WWF matches. Maybe even some back wen he went by Mean Mark prior to Undertaker. The match w/ Papa Shango,maybe Ultimate Warrior,ect...would rock! Also, I don't like how they tried to cover up some of the old WWF logos on the turnbuckles and stuff.  I understand why, but thought they got rights for the logo? Some of the other DVD's of WWE don't cover it & others do. Some even mix it up...Covering it on some of the matches.

Disc 1

-We get a voice-over guy who talks about Undertaker from his debut, to his Wrestlemania VII match against ""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka and his alliance with Jake Roberts that lead to his match for the WWE title against Hulk Hogan one year after his debut. We also hear from him before every match as he hits the bullet points leading into the next contest.

-11/27/91, Survivor Series, WWE Championship Match, vs. Hulk Hogan (Champion): Good match here that saw the Hulkster throw everything at the deadman, but he kept getting nailed with power moves and was choked out on a few occasions. Hogan did get some good shots in and even slammed the big man, Ric Flair came down who slips a chair into the ring, Hulk gets tombstoned and Taker makes the cover to win the title. 7/10.

-1/22/94, Casket Match for the WWE Championship, vs. Yokozuna (Champion): It wasn't too bad of a match, Yoko had a bunch of guys from the back come help him destroy the Undertaker, who just wouldn't stay down and kept fighting back but he finally fell victim to the beating and was thrown into the casket and Yoko retained the title. 6/10.

-3/31/96, Wrestlemania XII, vs. Diesel: Very good big man/big man match, that saw lots of power moves and the momentum changed a few times, but Diesel actually had Taker beat after hitting two Jacknife powerbombs but he didn't go for the cover. It came back to bite him as Taker rose up from the mat and soon after hit the Tombstone, makes the cover and defeats Big Daddy Cool. 8/10.

-10/20/96, In Your House: Buried Alive, Buried Alive Match, vs. Mankind: These two always had great matches here and this was right up there as both were very physical from the very start and Taker hits a great dive to the outside and they battle towards the gravesite. They also fight back to the ring, out in the crowd and just beat each other up, Mankind smashes a chair over Taker's head and the chair and steel steps are used. Taker comes back chokeslamming Mankind into the grave, then shovels dirt on him to bury him and win the match. 8/10. We get a post match beatdown on Taker that sees the deadman take a dirt nap, but he rises from the grave as only he can.

-4/20/97, In Your House: Revenge of the Taker, WWE Championship Match, vs. Mankind: Good one here as Taker was out for revenge after getting a fireball in the face from Mankind a few days prior. Like the previous match it starts out very physical with Taker beating down Mankind, who comes back targeting the bandage over Taker's right eye. Nice spot where Taker sends Mankind into the guardrail twice hitting the back of his head and we're back in the ring. Mankind brings some weapons into the ring including the steel steps which Taker dropkicks back into his face, then hits Mankind with as he goes from the ring headfirst into the announce table. Taker hits the tombstone and makes the cover to retain his title. 9/10.

-8/3/97, Summerslam, WWE Championship Match, vs. Bret Hart, w/Special Guest Referee: Shawn Michaels: Good pre-match promo from Bret that shows how much of a hated villain he was in the U.S. at this time. Great one here as we see Bret try to chop down Taker, hitting the knee and setting it up for the sharpshooter. The phenom just wears his down with power moves, working on the back with a backbreaker and a bearhug. Shawn actually remains impartial as if he didn't he would be fired and this is a very physical match-up. There's controversy at the end as Michaels accidentaly hits Taker with a chair and is forced to make the three count and we have a new champ. 9/10.

Bonus Match: 9/20/97, One Night Only, WWE Championship Match, vs. Bret Hart (Champion): It just as good as the previous match with the action starting off right away and the momentum changed quite often in the early minutes. The match goes to the outside and into the entrance way, but back in the ring Bret hits a snap DDT to a chorus of boos, however Bret gets whipped into the corner chest first colliding with an exposed turnbuckle. Taker then worked over Bret's ribs and back, Hart however starts attacking the knee locking an a couple of figure four leg locks and even the sharpshooter. More action as both target the other's injured body parts and when Bret's head was caught in the ropes Taker kept hitting Hart and the ref called for the bell as Taker loses by DQ. 8/10, cause the finish was cheap.

Extras on Disc 1

-11/16/91, Undertaker Attacks Hulk Hogan At The Funeral Parlor: Hogan cuts a promo on how he will beat the Undertaker, Ric Flair comes down and says he's waited for years to come face to face with Hulk. Taker of course attacks Hogan from behind, choking him out, good segment actually.

-12/18/93, Undertaker Builds A Casket For Yokozuna: We get another creepy promo from Taker and Paul Bearer as he says Yokozuna will ""Rest In Peace"".

-3/23/96, Undertaker in the Graveyard Talking About Diesel: The Deadman says Diesel's demise will not be quick after he put his hands on Paul Bearer.

-9/23/96, Undertaker in the Graveyard Talking About Mankind: Another good promo by the Phenom.

-4/6/97, Undertaker Interrupts Mankind's Interview: Yet another good and creepy promo, where Taker talks about what he will do to Mankind and Paul Bearer at their upcoming PPV match.

Disc 2

-9/7/97, In Your House: Ground Zero, vs. Shawn Michaels: When Taker came to the ring, Shawn used the ref as a sheild, but Taker quickly knocked the official out and threw the ref over the top rope and onto Michaels. This is a very good contest here as this was the first time they'd ever faced off in a singles match. Its really just a brawl for the most part as there's no referee, Taker chokes out Shawn with a cable cord then just beats him up in and out of the ring and now Earl Hebner is in the match. Michaels finally takes over using his speed to combat Taker's size, but he quickly gets sent over to the floor. Chyna and HHH interfere, Taker tries fighting them off but gets caught by Shawn, later Taker chokeslams the ref and ends up getting DQ'd. 8/10. Nice post match where Michaels and HHH beat up Taker, who comesback hitting a Tombstone on HHH. Loved how numerous superstars came out to break up the fight, but Taker hits a huge dive over the top onto some more superstars on the outside.

-10/5/97, Bad Blood, Hell In A Cell Match, vs. Shawn Michaels: The very first Hell in a Cell match is a very brutal one. Undertaker basically beats Michaels down for most of the early going, using lots of power maneuvers to keep Shawn down. But Shawn does come back with some nice moves even pile-driving the Undertaker onto the steel steps. The action spills outside of the cage, where Undertaker hotshots Michaels into the cell wall, which bloodies him up good, then Shawn climbs to the top and Undertaker follows and then Michaels gets knocked off the top through the announce table. Back in the ring Undertaker hits Michaels with a sick sounding chair shot then goes for the tombstone, but then Kane (in his debut) comes out, confronts the Undertaker then hits a horrible looking tombstone of his own on the Dead Man and then leaves. Shawn crawls over and covers the Undertaker to win in about 30 minutes. 11/10.

-3/29/98, Wrestlemania XIV, vs. Kane: After he swore he would never fight his brother, Taker was pushed to far and said he would send his brother to hell. This is one of the few Wrestlemania matches where Taker had to fight from underneath as Kane just seemed to have his number, as he countered his brother's moves, while nothing that Taker did seemed to keep Kane down. It took three Tombstones for Taker to finally defeat Kane and win the match. 8/10.

-4/26/98, Unforgiven, Inferno Match, vs. Kane: Very cool match here as its your standard big man match but the gimmick adds a nice element to it. Kane beats down his brother and even brings a chair into the ring and both men try there best to avoid the flames around the ring. Kane does get out of the ring, but Vader comes down and they battle back to the ring where Taker hits the trademark dive to the outside. Taker uses a chair to knock his brother out, then beats up Paul Bearer, goes back to the ring, kicks Kane into the flames and Kane's arm catches fire, Taker is declared the winner. 8/10.

-6/28/98, King of the Ring, vs. Mankind: Without question the most famous cell match in history. Mankind takes a huge fall from the top through the announce table in the first couple of minutes, after some time he comes back up the aisle and climbs the cage, takes a chokeslam through the ceiling of the cage and almost blacks out from the fall and a chair smashing him in the face. Pretty brutal action as there's thumbtacks, blood and a tombstone that puts Mankind down for the 3 count. 10/10. I do like that the post match ovation was included as the crowd cheered big for Foley.

-6/27/99, King of the Ring, WWE Championship Match, vs The Rock: Quite a good one here as these two always worked well together, the ref gets punched out by Taker in the beginning of the match, Rock hits the Rock Bottom but the second ref gets dragged out of the ring. The action goes to the outside and into the entrance way, where they trade momentum and Rock gets whipped hard into the guardrail. Back in the ring Taker beats up Rock some more, working on the arm and after more action, Taker tries using an ether soaked rag on Rock, but Taker gets the rag to the face. Triple H runs down hits the pedigree, then Taker hits the tombstone and makes the cover to retain his title. 8/10.

Extras on Disc 2

-8/4/97, Undertaker's Interview About Shawn Michaels: The Deadman talks about the events at the previous night's Summerslam and how Shawn will pay for what he did. Paul Bearer appears on the Titantron and says his brother Kane is coming.

-3/23/98, Undertaker Talking to His Parent's Tombstones: Pretty different side of the Phenom here as we hear him ask for forgiveness from his parents for what he must do to his brother.

-4/6/98, Undertaker Interview: While in the ring we see Kane on the titantron as he burns his parents tombstones.

-6/22/98, Undertaker Breaks Into Paul Bearer's House and Mauls Him: While Kane looks on, the deadman breaks into Paul's house and just beats the living you know what out of him.

Disc 3

-7/25/99, Fully Loaded, First Blood Match for the WWE Championship vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin: In the weeks prior Vince McMahon said if Austin loses he'll never be able to get the title again but also said if Taker doesn't win he'll leave the WWE. This like their other matches was quite physical, it starts out in the entrance way as both targeted the other's head trying to draw first blood. Lots of weapons are used including a steel chair which Austin uses to hit Shane McMahon when he comes to the ring, X-Pac comes down and kicks a chair into Taker's face and Austin hits the Deadman with a TV camera, the ref sees this and calls for the bell as Austin wins. 8/10. The post match sees Austin stun Taker and Vince, then Triple H and The Rock come out and brawl to the back. Austin and Taker brawl some more as both are busted open at this point, then Vince gets another stunner as a send-off.

-4/1/01, Wrestlemania X-Seven, vs. Triple H: This was an amazing fight that was much better than the one they had at Wrestlemania 27 and it was a straight up brawl. These two actually spent more time outside the ring as they brawled into the crowd and Taker chokeslammed Triple H off of a staging area. Later back in the ring, Taker goes for the Last Ride but Trips finds the sledgehammer and hits him with it, but can't keep Taker down. While up in the corner Trips is beating up Taker then gets caught in the Last Ride, the deadman makes the cover and wins the match. 10/10.

-5/19/02, Judgement Day, WWE Undisputed Championship Match, vs. Hulk Hogan (Champion): Almost 11 years ago these two faced off for the title, that match was way better than this one, as both guys tried but it just wasn't happening on this night. It was sluggish, slow and even when they brawled it didn't really get the pace of the match out of first gear. Taker did work on Hogan's braced knee, slamming it into the ring post and locking on a boston crab. Hulk does of course make his comeback and hits his usual moves including the leg drop, but Taker kicks out and hits a DDT which Hulk kicks out of. Vince comes down to the ring, distracts the ref but gets brought into the ring by Hulk and hit with the leg drop. Taker ends up hitting Hogan with chair, then a chokeslam and we have a new Undisputed Champion. 5/10.

-10/20/02, No Mercy, WWE Championship Match, vs. Brock Lesnar (Champion): Brutal, bloody and fantastic HIAC match. Undertaker does a great job making Lesnar look good and Lesnar holds his own inside the demonic cell. Some good brawling throughout, Taker gets the upperhand on Lesnar on a few occasions, but Lesnar ends up using the steel steps to the head of Taker, which really, I mean really busts him open. Taker gushes blood for the rest of the match, but fights back and almost beats Lesnar, then goes the for Tombstone, but Lesnar reverses it into a Tombstone and then hoists Taker onto his shoulders and hits the F-5 for the win to retain the WWE title. 11/10.

-7/27/03, Vengeance, vs. John Cena: Pretty good one here that saw Taker dominate early on and had Cena beat a few times but didn't go for the cover, which cost him as John hit a DDT and took over on the deadman working on his shoulder. This was a match where Cena really started to prove himself as a main eventer, where he hit the FU but Taker kicked out and soon after hit the the Last Ride and made the cover to win. 7/10.

-11/16/03, Survivor Series, Buried Alive Match, vs. Vince McMahon: Almost a squash match here as Taker busts open Vince after one punch and he starts just gushing blood. Taker just beats down Vince who doesn't get in a lot of offense, Taker beats on him around the ring, grabs a shovel and smashes Vince's head in. At the gravesite, Vince hits a lowblow and uses the shovel to knock Taker into the grave but Vince gets dragged in. As Taker goes to the payloader an explosion happens and Kane appears and he knocks his brother into the grave, Vince goes into the payloader and drops dirt on grave burying Taker and winning the match. 6/10.

-3/14/04, Wrestlemania XX, vs. Kane: If I could rate this on build-up alone it would be a 10/10, as the promos and everything leading up to this match was top notch. The entrances were both good especially Takers as the crowd was on its feet from the opening gong. The match however was typical big man vs. big man, not bad but not great. Taker ends up hitting the Tombstone to win. 6/10.

Bonus Match: 9/3/03, Smackdown, WWE Championship Match, vs. Kurt Angle (Champion): Their different styles always worked well and this match showed that on many occasions as both countered each others moves. Angle tried to lock on the ankle lock while Taker kept looking to land the big strike and the tombstone to win the title. Taker even pulled out some good submission wrestling of his own and Angle hit some good suplexes like only he can. As Taker hits Angle with the Last Ride, Brock Lesnar comes in, hits Taker with a chair causing a DQ. 9/10. Then Brock targets the ankle of the Phenom and hits Kurt with the title belt.

Extras on Disc 3

-3/26/01, Undertaker Interview About Triple H: Basically he just hypes up their match at Wrestlemania.

-4/29/02, Undertaker Promo On Hulk Hogan: Here he recaps the history he and Hogan have and talks about how he will kill Hulk-a-Mania.

-10/20/02, Undertaker Talks About Hell In A Cell: He says the pain he's gone through to this point won't compare to what Brock Lesnar feels inside the cell.

-11/13/03, Undertaker In The Graveyard Promo On Vince McMahon: Another creepy promo where Taker says he'll burying the chairman alive.

Whats different about this collection as opposed to his more recent one is this set actually acknowledges his biker years and some of the good matches he had while in that gimmick. Its a good collection that shows a lot of Taker's best matches, with the exception of the Judgement Day match against Hogan.",1316476800,,16432,4.516997643890946
2352391,5,B000A2X0LE,"The Undertaker is one of the best in ring competitors even today despite his condition. This is his first DVD (unless you count The Phenom & He Buries Them Alive which were re-releases of vhs tapes). He is my favorite wrestler. This 3 disc set (should've been 4 if you ask me) features some of his best bouts & a 6 hour story by an unknown narrator, who judging by hi voice was the great candidate to narrate a DVD like this.

Disc 1

Undertaker Vs. Hulk Hogan (WWE Championship) - Hogan was known most for his charisma as he was not the greatest wrestler. This is Taker's first WWE Title match & his first Title win. It occured at the event he debuted in just a year before & he beat Hogan, a guy who was pretty much the John Cena of the 90s, virtually unbeatable....well most of the time anyway so this was really special. As Taker himself says in his My Yard documentary, the strangest thing about this night is how as the match went on & by the time it was over, Taker was billed as the hell was cheered. It's a testament to Taker & his portrayal of his character that people took to this dark, mysterious character in the early part of his career.

Undertaker Vs. Yokozuna (RIP)(WWE Championship Casket Match) - The match itself was short. What seemed to me like the entire roster of heels aided Yokozuna in putting Taker in the casket. But Taker held his own for quite a while. Most remembered for the resurrection of the future Phenom.

Undertaker Vs. Diesel - From WM12. One of Diesel's best matches & one of Taker's most physical & best matches. Before this, he was facing Bundy, Gonzales and 2 legends who were Snuka & Jake Roberts although 2 of them were squash matches for the most part. WM12 was the first match in which Taker looked like he could lose at WM. But I'm glad he didn't seeing as how he was screwed out of the Title by Diesel twice.

Undertaker Vs. Mankind (Buried Alive Match) - A first for the WWE. This is Taker's match despite him losing most of these matches. However, he won this one & since he was buried after getting the win. Just an absolute brawl that's worth multiple viewings especially for those who love a good hardcore bout. This is 96 & for that time, the UT/Mankind feud was hardcore. Wish they also added the Boiler Room Brawl from SSlam 96 because that was a significant part of UT's career & would fit the story of this DVD well as it ended what was thought to be an everlasting relationship between Paul Bearer & Taker.

Undertaker Vs. Mankind (WWE Championship Match) - Taker won his second Title a month earlier at WM13. Taker was burned shortly before this match. But after tombstoning Mankind to retain the Title, he burned Paul Bearer. A great match as all of them are. But IMO, not their best.

Undertaker Vs. Bret Hart (WWE Championship Match) - SSlam 97. HBK as as inexperienced special guest ref. Taker really showed his threshold for pain here as he took quite an abuse. The only thing that rivals the abuse he took here (at that particular time) was the abuse he took at the hands of Mankind a year earlier. A GREAT GREAT match that set up the UT/HBK feud. Taker fought with a bad leg, even broke the Sharpshooter twice (the second time with Bret locking it around the ring post, took care of Paul Bearer & Owen and Pillman and at times, referring that I thought was questionable by HBK. This was the first time that had Taker pull off a rare Chokeslam from the apron to the center of the ring. He really showed his brute power as JR said as the beginning of the match.

BONUS MATCH: Undertaker Vs. Bret Hart - One Night Only 97 (an England only PPV, took place Sept. 20, my Bday!!) - This was also for the Championship. A lot of people say this is better than their SSlam match. Don't know about that. This was definitely a great match though. I wish they added the entrances & UT's pre-match interview.

EXTRAS ON DISC 1

Undertaker attacks Hogan in the Funeral Parlor - A memorable moment. Appearance by Ric Flair. He & Hogan have 2 different Title belts around their waist. UT nails Hogan with the Urn from behind & chokes him. A chairshot doesn't affect him.
Undertaker builds a casket for Yokozuna - I remember this strictly for Taker's hair flip, eyes rolling & in his true, old school Deadman voice saying ""Rest In Peace""
Undertaker talks about Diesel in the graveyard - A promo from Superstars in 96 before their WM12 match
Undertaker talks about Mankind in the graveyard - Here, UT talks about Paul's betrayal & how his wounds from SSlam are just beginning to heal
Undertaker interrupts Mankind's interview - Took place on RAW before their Championship match that's in this disc.

Wish they added the memorable Funeral Parlour segment where Jake locked Taker's hand in the coffin & despite being hit with repeated chair shots, Taker staling Jake while dragging the casket.

DISC 2

Undertaker Vs. Shawn Michaels (In Your House: Ground Zero) - Their very first match together. A greta set up for their HIAC match. HHH gets involved. The entire roster comes out & UT does a memorable suicide dive (the one he does these days only at WM) talking down about 10 people including HBK.

Undertaker Vs. Shawn Michaels (Hell In The Cell) - Glad this was here because history was made right here & it's UT's favorite match as he stated many times. UT lost thanks to Kane, who debuted & hit a Tombstone on Taker. But man, did HBK take a beating.

Undertaker Vs. Kane (WrestleMania 14) - In the My Yard documentary, UT said this was one of his favorite matches with Kane as it was an all out physical war. Taker took a hell of a beating. I think even more than Mankind gave him in 96. UT won. But it took 3 tombstones as Kane kicked out of the first 2. But Kane really dominated.

Undertaker Vs. Kane (Inferno Match) - I LOVED this match. Kane did dominate here. But I don't think he dominated as much as he did at WM14. UT does a most memorable dive, sticks a drum on Paul's head & sets Kane's arm on fire. UT celebration here was a memorable one. Great camera work for that!

Undertaker Vs. Mankind (Hell In The Cell) - THE BEST HIAC MATCH TO DATE IMO! Foley took what was probably the WORST beating in his career & his life (well in WWE at least). He give him credit because despite being thrown off the Cell through the Spanish table & being chokeslammed through the Cell, he continued. He took 1 or 2 shots to an already injured shoulder with steel steps, an electric chair & a chokeslam onto thumbtacks! Taker wrestled here with a broken ankle. This match set new standards. The true main event & headliner on this KOTR 98 card if you ask me.

Undertaker Vs. The Rock (WWE Championship Match) - UT was the Champion here. This started off weird as UT punched the ref from behind right after the the bell rung to begin the match. But it helped because he ref was knocked out so he couldn't count Rock's pinfall following the Rock Bottom (which was formerly known as Duane Reade, a pharmacy store lol!) Taker retains with the Tombstone following Rock taking a Pedigree from HHH.

EXTRAS ON DISC 2

Undetaker interview right after SummerSlam '97 concerning Shawn Michaels - Not a bad interview. A more suitable interview though would have been the one where he says he took the blood & signed HBK's death warrant with it.

Undertaker talking to her parents' tombstones - Can't say this was anywhere near as memorable as UT's return on RAW & the promo where he spoke on top of the titantron & set fire via a lighting bolt on a Kane dummy

Undertaker interview where Kane burns their parents' tombstones - Great & memorable interview/segment.

Undertaker breaks into Paul Bearer's house and mauls him! - Memorable segment. First time I ever saw Taker in different clothes....well besides the color lol.

DISC 3

Undertaker Vs. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin (WWE Championship/First Blood Match) - I don't know why. But I didn't like this match much. They should have put their SSlam and.or their match from A Cold Day in Hell here. I liked both of those better. However, the First Blood match was still good.

Undertaker Vs. HHH (WrestleMania X-7) - One of the best bouts on both men's career & in WM.

Undertaker Vs. Hulk Hogan (WWE Championship Match) - Pretty much a rematch that took place like 10-11 years later. Both men were different here than they were then in terms of experience, legendary status, age & in Taker's case, his persona. But the result is the same as SSeries.

Undertaker Vs. Brock Lesner (WWE Championship Match/Hell In The Cell) - I don't know how Taker worked this match with a broken hand & because of the amount of blood he lost. He whole face was blood red & he still went through the match like a true Champion. His effort alone really made me feel like he deserved to win here.

Undertaker Vs. John Cena - The legendary Undertaker vs the rookie, John Cena. This was Cena's best persona to date. For a rookie, he did pretty good. But in the end, he got a little too carried away & lost via The Last Ride.

Undertaker Vs. Mr. McMahon (Buried Alive Match) - For all the years of mistreatment, Vince really paid for it here courtesy of a HUGE @$$ KICKIN! He was busted open real early by a right hand punch. Just goes to show that Taker really is the best pure striker in WWE history. However, thanks to Kane, Taker lost & his biker gimmick was buried alive.

Undertaker Vs. Kane (WrestleMania 20) - Not really the physical war from their WM14 match. But the entrances, especially Taker's was worth multiple viewings. The match was really about Taker's revenge & he got it so I suppose it did what it needed to. But for such a long build & a lot of hype, it wasn't given the time I feel it should've been given.

EXTRAS ON DISC 3

Undertaker talks about HHH - Interview about their WM17 match. Took place on RAW before Taker & Kane fought Rock & Austin just 6 days before WM. One of my favorite Taker interviews from his biker days.

Undertaker promo on Hulk Hogan - Not a bad promo. But Taker's has better ones. The true highlight for me here was when Taker spoke of his early days where kids would hide behind their father's legs on fear of Taker. It just brought back memories.

Undertaker talks about Hell In The Cell - Aired on Heat the night of No Mercy. This is coming from the man who's the master of HIAC & who's been in more of these matches than anyone even to this very day. His words truly explain what HIAC is all about & it's consequences.

Undertaker in the graveyard promo on Mr. McMahon - While I do wish they added the Handicap match which Taker won & where he chose the Buried Alive match along with the other 2 promos on Vince, I'm glad they out this one because Taker returns to what has been his home for years (aside from the ring). Great promo by Taker.

BONUS MATCH: Undertaker Vs. Kurt Angle (WWE Title) - THis includes & pre & post match comments from Kurt. Just shows a little glimpse of the amount of respect Taker's earned. The match was one of the best in SD history. It wad that good till the interference from Lesnar.

This is a wonderful set. If you're a fan of Taker, get this. Sure, there's things that could've been added. But aside from that, there's barely any flaws IMO & that's coming from someone who even now watches this all the time, more than The Deadliest Matches set which was also good.

Marvelous matches like, Undertaker vs Mankind Hell in a Cell match, Undertaker vs Yokozuna casket match, Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels (Shawn Michael's very first match against the Undertaker),  is also in the dvd set.

I'm reviewing this on 25th March 2010 (in Sri Lanka). On 28th March 2010, Wrestlemania XXVI is on, and I am looking forward to watch Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels - Streak (17/0) vs Career of Shawn Michaels match, the rematch of Wrestlemania XXV. even though almost all other matches at WWE is predictable, I have no idea what is going to happen with this match, so I am so anticipated to watch it on 28th.

The packing was so great. Only downside is, Amazon.com does not indicate, the returning policy on outside the package.

Covering nearly 6 hours of footage on the Undertaker, I was very pleased with the overall presentation on this legendary icon. Here is what you will get from the three discs:

DISC 1
Survivor Series '91
WWE Championship
Vs. Hulk Hogan - Not a classic by any means. But the match displays how dominant and powerful the Undertaker was at the time. Taker captures his first championship gold with help from Ric Flair & a steel chair. 4/5

Royal Rumble '94
Casket Match/WWE Championship
Vs. Yokozuna - Taker and Yoko puts on a good fight for about the first 6 or 7 minutes of the match until everybody comes out to help Yoko. The match certainly displays the awesome fighting spirit of the deadman. 3.5/5

Wrestlemania XII
Vs. Diesel - A pretty good big man contest. Taker & Diesel had a good brawling match here. 4/5

In Your House '96
Buried Alive Match
Vs. Mankind - Just a vicious beating to Mankind from Taker. Chairs and steel steps all come into play in this one. 4.5/5

In Your House '97
WWE Championship
Vs. Mankind - Mankind takes another brutal beating from Taker here. Even taking a head first dive into the announce table! Still a pretty good bout for the WWE title from these two. 4.5/5

Summerslam '97
WWE Championship
Vs. Bret Hart - Awesome championship match right here. ""HBK"" Shawn Michaels is the special referee and his role definitely played a huge part in this match. Possibably the best WWE title match in Summerslam history. 5/5

BONUS MATCH: Vs. Bret Hart from One Night Only (WWE Championship) - This was Taker's rematch for the WWE title that took place in England. Possibably just as good as their Summerslam bout or even better but I think the ending is what really killed the match. 4.75/5 [Match also available on Bret Hart: The Best There Is, The Best There Was, The Best There Ever Will Be]

Extra's on DISC 1:
Undertaker Attacks Hulk Hogan at the Funeral Parlor
Undertaker building the casket for Yokozuna
Undertaker talking about Diesel from a graveyard
Undertaker talking about Mankind from a graveyard
Undertaker interrupting Mankind's interview

DISC 2
Ground Zero '97
Vs. Shawn Michaels - The very first meeting between these two and from the start this match was just chaotic. And I think chaotic is the perfect word for this match. This match right here is the reason why these two men entered Hell in a Cell a month later. 4.5/5

Bad Blood '97
Hell in a Cell
Vs. Shawn Michaels - In this debut match, Michaels and Taker sets the bar for future HIAC matches to come. HBK just takes a bloody beating from the deadman. 5/5 [Match also available on Shawn Michaels: From the Vault & Hell In A Cell]

Wrestlemania XIV
Vs. Kane - Just an all out war here. Kane throughout the entire match dominates and overpowers the Undertaker like nobody has ever before. Taker also takes a dive into the announce table. A very awesome match. 5/5

Unforgiven '98
Inferno Match
Vs. Kane - Certainly not the same classic bout we saw from these two at Wrestlemania 14. Taker diving over the top rope and clear over the fire onto Vader and Kane on the outside is indeed something to see. 3.5/5

King of the Ring '98
Hell in a Cell
Vs. Mankind - Probably the most brutal and sedistic beating Mick Foley has ever taken. Chairs, steel steps, & thumb tacks all come into play in this one. Probably Mankind's and Taker's most famous match together. 5/5 [Match also available on Mick Foley: Greatest Hits & Misses & Hell In A Cell]

King of the Ring '99
WWE Championship
Vs. The Rock - Another good championship bout. Taker & Rock both looked to be in good shape. This fight got taken everywhere. With help from Triple H, Taker retains the WWE title. 4.5/5

Extra's on DISC 2:
Undertaker's interview about Shawn Michaels
Undertaker at his parent's tombstone
Undertaker's interview and Kane buring their parent's tombstone
Undertaker breaking into Paul Bearer's house

DISC 3
Fully Loaded '99
First Blood Match/WWE Championship
Vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin - Just your basic brawl from these two. A very physical match but not as good as their Summerslam bout from a year earlier. Special appearences from the Rock, Triple H, Shane, & Vince McMahon. 4.5/5

Wrestlemania X-Seven
Vs. Triple H - Another big time brawl. These two fought all over the arena. Triple H even taking a chokeslam off the camera crew deck and into the crowd. Awesome fight between the Game & the Deadman. 4.75/5

Judgment Day '02
Undisputed Championship
Vs. Hulk Hogan - A match that took 12 years to happen again for the same championship. This too isn't a classic but it is the last time you will ever see these two in the same ring together. 4/5

No Mercy '02
Hell in a Cell/WWE Championship
Vs. Brock Lesnar - Taker bleeds buckets in this match. A very brutal and bloody match. This match is certainly not for the weak stomached. [Also available on Hell In A Cell] 5/5

Vengeance '03
Vs. John Cena - This match is actually one of Cena's best matches. And the reason is because he was in there with a true legend in the Undertaker. A very good match. 5/5

Survivor Series '03
Buried Alive Match
Vs. Vince McMahon - McMahon takes probably his worst beating of his life. He also becomes very bloody here. This match is 100 percent Undertaker. 3.5/5

Wrestlemania XX
Vs. Kane - This match isn't on the same level as their first meeting but Taker's return and his entrance is the reason to check this match out. 3.5/5

BONUS MATCH: Vs. Kurt Angle from Smackdown '03 (WWE Championship) - Awesome match for the WWE title but isn't quit as good as their No Way Out match from 2006. But still a great battle from these two great athletes. 4.5/5

Extra's on DISC 3
Undertaker's interview about Triple H
Undertaker's promo on Hulk Hogan
Undertaker talking about his Hell in a Cell Match against Brock Lesnar
Undertaker's graveyard promo on Mr. McMahon

Overall I was very happy with the set. This set covers nearly every square inch of the Undertaker's career from 1990 until 2004. Awesome set and I defiantely recommend this to anyone.",1233360000,,6187,4.623175182481752
2352452,5,B000A2X0LE,"Undertaker is one of those superstars that you have known and loved for many, many years. He's given us some of the most memorable moments in wrestling history, from throwing Mankind off the top of the cell at King of the Ring 1998 to setting his brother Kane alight in the Inferno match. He's one of the WWE's best creations and another prime example of how WCW dropped the ball in letting him go. At 6 ft 10 he's known as the most agile big guy the business has ever seen, and that is no joke as seeing a men his size gracefully jump over the top rope, perform a flying lariat or indeed even walk on the top rope of the ring is something impressive, and something to truly be witnessed first hand. After just a year in the business Undertaker won his first WWE title after beating the biggest name the wrestling industry has ever seen in Hulk Hogan. That in itself is an impressive mark on a persons resum, adding onto it the current 16-0 winning streak at Wrestlemania and being the true patriarch of the Buried Alive match and the Hell In A Cell Match. There's no denying that Undertaker is an impressive character and something that we're unlikely to see ever again, so this is the right kind of set to give us which shows us the impressive career of the dead man the Undertaker.

This is an incredible set and although missing some matches that I would have loved to see, the 6-Man Hell In A Cell match for example and although Taker lost, it still would have been interesting for that match to be in the set. Overall though, the set is a great one and is something that must be owned by almost every WWE fan around the world.",1213833600,,2617,4.763796909492274

2352491,5,B000A2X0LE,"I think all the matches on the dvd were good ones I mean of course there are some missing there are to many great matches there are.

vs hulk hogan: the match isn't that great but better than the one on disc 3 it is slowish and a little boring but it is decent and I give it 6/10

vs yokozuna casket match: this match was ok and then a whole bunch of heels come out and try to put taker into the casket and then finally do it is good the first time but then it gets boring the other times you watch it 5/10

vs diesel: this is when the set picks up as the big men do a couple things they haven't done before it is a very good match but is not great but that is later in the set 8/10

vs mankind buried alive match: wow this is the first buried alive and the best these two had a great main event that night but outdid thereselfs a few times 9/10

vs mankind: this match is crazy and great they fight all over the outside and just about destory the rest of foley's ear in this match his mask gets ripped off and then he goes HEAD FIRST INTO A TABLE it is crazy 10/10

vs bret hart (summerslam) ref HBK: this is a bret match mostly and taker breaks the shapshooter nothing great expect its one of the matches you can watch over and over because it is great 9/10

vs bret hart (one night only): this is diffrent because it has taker and bret doing there moves and is better than summerslam 10/10

vs shawn michaels: it is a big brawl that is pretty good and long and is great to watch a few times but is overlooked due to the hitc match at badd blood 8/10

vs shawn michaels hitc: this match is the first hitc and it is great as one of the best north american matches in history it is just that good 10/10

vs kane: this is there best match ever and is really good because kane looks unstoppable unlike in the next match 9/10

vs kane inferno match: this is a down step from the wrestlemania match they had 7/10

vs mankind hitc: what can you say other than that this is the best and worst match mixed into one but i love it and so does most everyone else 10/10

vs the rock: normal match so that is all i can say 7/10

vs stone cold first blood: this match is great and seems shorter than it is because it is so good, one of steves best matches and it is a great storyline too 10/10

vs hhh: it is pretty good just it isn't believable that the ref was down all that time but still good match 8/10

vs hogan: poor i get bored watching this i never liked hogan and to not put taker over him cleanly sucks 3/10

vs brock lesnar hitc: maybe the best hitc it is so in your face and physical that it is just plain great, classic, and brutal i have to give this a 11/10

vs john cena: when cena was like this persona that it was a great match i love to watch this match it is great 9/10

vs Mr. mcmahon buried alive: poor and boring match that is not good at all and seems to drag on 5/10

vs kane: good but short and it is pretty much just taker destorying the kane to become like a monster face 6/10

vs kurt angle: great, great, great this is the way to cap it off great wrestling and it is one of takers best and at least we end it on a high note 9/10",1210291200,,3146,3.8996865203761755

BEST FEATURES
- It's doesn't show just the matches, but also a little documentary in-between the fights, explaing what happened before and after each featured match.
- There are a couple of Extras that live up to their hype, like the match vs Bret Hart, or when Undertaker atacks Hulk Hogan in the funeral parlor.
- This DVD shows, by far, the most savage Hell-in-a-Cell match I've ever seen. That Undertaker vs Mankind, the sound bout, where the latter literrally flies from the top of the cell into the anouncers table.

WORST FEATURES
- The Undertaker as a Bike-Rider storyline was pretty dumb, but I thing the worst was the Undertaker, in his dead parents graveyard, talking about his fight with Kaine and how he will accept his ""eternal damnation"".",1198368000,,850,4.697986577181208
2352493,4,B000A2X0LE,"The packaging is pretty dumb, with all three discs stacked atop each other, with the center bar long enough for all three.

Because of the Undertaker's gimmick, and the strict kayfabe-ness of this DVD, you'll get great drama and emotion, and full-length matches, but you won't get any insight into Mark Calaway, or his time in the WWF/WWE.

The documentary?  It may as well not be there.  It features Mean Gene Oakerlund with a disguised voice narrating the Undertaker, moving so fast through the early years that they skip his debut match, and seem to display him as having ADD, as he jackknifes from one opponent to another without any coherence.  One part of the DVD, he's facing off against Ric Flair and Hulk Hogan, then a few seconds later, he's wrestling Yokozuna, then after that match, he's feuding with Bret Hart, and seconds later Mankind arrives and attacks him.

The mood and tone of the DVD collection is great, and the discs feature full-length matches in the ""documentary"", so it will take a very long time to watch through the entire collection.

The part where the DVD fumbles and bumbles is where the Undertaker changes his gimmick to the more down-to-earth biker guy.  At that point, Oakerlund shuts up most of the time, and there's no more documentary... just promos playing leading up to matches, and followed by Oakerlund (acting as if the Undertaker were still the lord of darkness) narrating of how the Undertaker goes on to attack someone else random, all up until his Wrestlemania XX redebut as the true Undertaker, but by that time, the DVD collection is nearly over.

Bonus features are sparse, including some promos and such, and plenty of full-length matches, but expect no insight into Mark Calaway, or even into the Undertaker's kayfabe past.  If it weren't as long and detailed and full of matches and such as it was, I would have given this a much lower rating.",1197072000,2,1896,4.770642201834862

2352495,4,B000A2X0LE,"I enjoyed this dvd but the usual documentry styles of interviews with the superstar and others was missing. Instead you are taken Chronologically through his carrer stopping for his most important matches with a narrorators deleviering the story.

Some matches I skipped because I had already had them or seen them before like the first hell in a cell with hbk. I was suprised with the inclusion of the Lesnar vs taker HIAC encounter with how wwe and lesnar's relationship fell apart. I wasn't a fan of his at all during his biker stage but still enjoyed the matches nevertheless.

Even if you are not a taker fan there are a lot of defining matches with a wide assortment of superstars to enjoy. Mick Foley HIAC is something to witness at least once. early Hogan match is classic good vs evil matchup. No commentaries are included but skits and viginettes are.",1189987200,,861,4.695364238410596

Some of the great matches on this set are taker vs. hbk in the first hell in a cell, taker vs. bret hart, taker vs. hogan from survivor series, vs. kane in the inferno match, and all the way up to his rematch with kane at wrestlemania 20. Most of you already have this disc set. But I would say to those who aren't a big fan of the undertaker (i cant imagine why you wouldn't be) that they should buy this disc set.

2352533,5,B000A2X0LE,"This is the collection that all others should be judged against. I have gollowed 'Taker's career since his earliest days in the old WCCW regional promotion. I watched him become a Skyscraper and then his introduction by Ted DiBiase as ""Kane"" the Undertaker. Yes, Taker was the original KANE. :) This 3 disc set is fantastic. The timeline presentation is different from most collections. I love the way the documentary slips in match after match in order. Most discs give you a long, and usually boring, documentary (see McMahon and Road Warriors). After that, you find the action. In this one, the action is right in the documentary itself.

The matches are fantastic too. A few changes I would have made were to show the Undertaker vs Undertaker match, and show the entire match of Taker's debut. But that is just me being picky. I do enjoy some of the lesser seen matches that are included. I really enjoy the match where just about everyone in the locker room hits the ring to beat down Taker and put him in the coffin. I mean they even had Kabuki there (my all-time favorite wrestler).

I CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS COLLECTION HIGHLY ENOUGH! This one holds a place of honor on my DVD shelf. If you are a true wrestling fan, this is a must have. The Hell in a Cell match against Mick Foley is alone worth the price. Throw in Hogan, Austin, Rock, Triple H, and Kane and you have the most fantastic career highlight reel ever made.",1158278400,,1428,4.5310077519379846
2352534,5,B000A2X0LE,"I was looking on Wikipedia the other day cause i was bored, and happened to find the page for this DVD. On the page there was a section entitled SEQUEL. It said that the sequel would feature matches not included in the first DVD set. The only specific the website gave was that Takers's match against Jake Roberts(presumably at Wrestlemania VIII) was being considered. I was wondering if anybody else has heard about this second DVD, and if they have, i would be delighted to know what matches are scheduled to be included in it. I am the biggest Undertaker fan, and I cannot wait for the second DVD set. If someone knows any of the matches that are going to be included, please respond, or if you have guesses or suggestions, that be great too.

2352535,4,B000A2X0LE,"This set is the complete opposite of the Bret Hart set.  While the Hitman's set was stronger on the documentary side than the wrestling side, the Undertaker set has no biographical content at all.  There is nothing on Mark Calloway, the real man behing the Undertaker character, which is a shame.  Being that he has done such a good job with this character, the least the WWE could have done was give him some air time on his own DVD. With that said, if you want pure wrestling, this is a good set, especially at the sale price (19.95). I am told that ""This is My Yard"" (2001) is better if you want to learn more about Mark Calloway, though I cannot vouch for it personally.  Overall, this set was worth the price I paid, but I will be happier when a more complete set is released.",1156377600,2,781,4.292517006802721
2352536,5,B000A2X0LE,"First i wanna thank the WWE for putting this DVD out, it is not a DVD with a story of the Undertakers life this is merely a collection of all his greatest matches from the start to finish of his career (although it isn't finished yet).

My favourite Undertaker matches i will talk about here one by one so here goes.

Undertaker vs Mankind Hell In A Cell Match King Of The Ring 1998: Who doesn't know about this match? wether you were a wrestling fan or not around this time you will of heard about it because it was just crazy. This match not only overshadowed Micks past career as his most death defying moment but it set in stone the character of the Undertaker as a cold hearted evil man who will go to any lengths to hurt somebody.

The first throw off the cell is unbelievable and i genuinly thought mankind might of been killed at that moment, luckily he wasn't and he was actually still able to go through the top of the cell down to the ring via a chokeslam. This match is very slow, mainly because of the huge falls Mankind takes but it is also the most entertaining match in the set.

Kane s Undertaker Inferno Match Unforgiven 1998: This year was Takers best year because not only did he have the most memorable match in history with Mankind and had people believe he would kill his opponents if he had to but now the WWE decided that if the Undertaker was this dangerous in a cell, let's stick fire around the ring, remove the cell and put him against his brother.

This = Excellence as it is again one of Undertakers best matches, him and Kane fail to put on a bad match in my opinion now considering the size of the pair of them you would think this wouldn't be a very quick paced match, but you would be wrong. The entire ring is used well and when it comes to Underakers classic dive over the top rope and that brings the end of the match which is so cool you wouldn't believe.

Well they are the 2 of my favourite matches but trust me there are alot more of Takers classic matches, the only bad part of this collection is that there is a serious lack of his matches as the biker Undertaker but none the less buy this collection as it provides hours and hours of entertainment.",1149897600,,2194,4.2368421052631575
2352537,5,B000A2X0LE,"Finally, a DVD collection of some of the Undertaker's greatest moments. Even if the Ministry of Darkness and a few other great matches are omitted, this dvd set is remarkable. Starting back when the Undertaker first entered the WWE, this journey will show you his changes, his growth, his journey from bad to good and back again, his establishing his name as the WWE Phenom, and many great matches that only the UNDERTAKER can do.

If you are a Taker fan, this is a MUST HAVE.",1149379200,,476,4.534883720930233
2352538,2,B000A2X0LE,"If you want to watch a bunch of the Undertakers best matches then this is a good DVD.  If you want to learn anything of the history of the Undertaker, either the man or the character you won't get any of that here.  This is bascially a bunch of matches with a little voice over in between, similar to the Ric Flair DVD (but without the great promos as Taker isn't exactly one of wrestlings great speakers, nor is Paul Bearer for that mater lol).  This DVD has no vignette with interviews with the wrestler or history of the character from McMahon and company whatsover (unlike the Bret Hart, Hogan and Warrior DVD's).  Furthermore the cover art is horrible and all of the discs are all stuffed into one side of the box (as opposed to it opening up to several DVD flaps with picture art (e.g. Flair and Hart DVD's).  If you are a wrestling purist then it is okay, else wait for the inevitable second 5 or 6 disc DVD WWE will release when he retires in a year or two.",1149206400,2,965,4.251366120218579

The matches are complete and include the all important entrance. No 'Taker match can be appreciated without the Dead Man's spine tingling entrance. Especially at Wrestlemania XX where he faces his own sibling. This entrance has to rate as one of the best in the history of wrestling.

The Undertaker and Mankind's matches are the most brutal ever witnessed and it's all in this set. The majority of the Dead Man's best matches are found on the three discs.

This DVD set will not disappoint. R.I.P.",1148688000,,737,4.653846153846154

2352631,5,B000A2X0LE,"When names like Hogan, Savage, Warrior, Piper, Hart who have come & gone through the WWE...one man has always remained a face in the company & that is Undertaker. Here is a career anthology filled with matches from his career.

vs. WWE Champion Hulk Hogan - A year after his debut & being undefeated, Undertaker challenged for the WWE Championship in what was known as the ""Gravest Challenge"" for Hulk Hogan as Taker was dominate from the start as he focused on Hogan's throat with uppercuts & a death grip while also using the ropes with Paul Bearer choking Hogan whenever the referee was distracted.  Hogan was able to gain an advantage after a miscalculated move but was unable to knock Taker off his feet as Taker eventually got control back continuing to work over Hogan's throat at a slow & methodical pace but Hogan was eventually able to make his comeback & knock Taker down to one knee as another man who Hogan had his issues with made his presence known.  This match was your typical Hogan performance against a man of Taker's size where he was dominated before making his comeback but definitely told a good story of Taker constantly focusing on Hogan's neck & throat area which played huge in the end.
Survivor Series 91

Casket Match vs. WWE Champion Yokozuna - This was one of those matches to setup a storyline more than anything else as it seemed like all the mid-card heels came out during this match to attack & gang up on Undertaker, who kept fighting them off for as long as he could, helping Yokozuna lock him in his casket. The aftermath was probably more memorable than the match itself.
Royal Rumble 93

vs. Diesel - During Undertaker's career (specifically during the mid 90's), he had the reputation for being able to bring out the best performance out of bigger men who were very limited in what they could do in the ring & Kevin ""Diesel"" Nash was one of those men here. This was a match that can be described by Vince McMahon as ""these two monsters are clobbering each other."" They used heavy impact power moves while Taker resorted some some moves we hadn't seen from him at that time like a crossbody block. This was a real hard fought victory for the winner.
WrestleMania XII
[Undertaker: The Streak]

Buried Alive Match vs. Mankind - As usual when it came to whenever these two men fighting each other, this was a brawl that was hardcore before the word ""hardcore"" was ever used in WWE as they went all over the place from the ring to ringside & through the crowd down to the actual grave. They used everything they could get their hands on from microphone cords to a sharp object that Paul Bearer brought into the match. Other objects were used like Mankind giving Undertaker a chairshot before Taker would later use the chair to give a legdrop onto Mankind's face along with the steel steps being driven into Mankind's back & face. Just like Undertaker's later encounters like the Hell In A Cell vs. Shawn Michaels & the Inferno Match vs. Kane, this was a first for it's kind and something to watch from beginning to end and even after the match.
""In Your House: Buried Alive"" Oct. 96
[Best Of In Your House]

WWE Championship Match vs. Mankind - After fighting in ""first ever"" encounters like the Boiler Room Brawl & Buried Alive match, they meet here in another first for both men...their first championship encounter. This wasn't a No Disqualification match but the referee sure threw the rulebook out the window here as was just an all out brawl with both men beating on each other with anything in sight like Mankind breaking a pitcher of water over Taker's head, both men exchanging chairshots, and Taker even dropkicking the steel steps into Mankind's face. Mankind targeted Taker's eye that was heavily burned from weeks prior and even at one point used the mandible claw on the referee. The ""Oh My God"" memorable moment from this match was Mankind going through the announce table in a way that was never seen before & hasn't been seen since. These two put another hardcore performance that was completely different than their previous ones along with an aftermath that finally saw Undertaker get the revenge that he's been after for months.
""In Your House: Revenge Of The Taker"" Apr. 97

WWE Championship Match w/Shawn Michaels as the special referee vs. Bret Hart - This is one of those rare matches where Undertaker was actually the least important factor going into the match as the real story here was Bret Hart making the promise that if he didn't win the WWE Championship (not just the match but the championship) that he would never again wrestle in the United States. However the ""X factor"" here was that Shawn Michaels was made the special guest referee for this match (the first time he's been referee for the record) with the stipulation on Shawn that if he showed any bias towards Undertaker that he wouldn't be allowed to wrestle in the United States as well...plus it was no secret of the issues & hate between Bret & Shawn for over a year at that time. Bret started off attacking Undertaker before the match got started & targeted Taker's knee throughout the match including using the ringpost to apply more pressure to his various submission moves like the figure four & even the sharpshooter at different points in the match. They had a real competitive match as it went back & forth between both men with Shawn keeping control of the match & showcasing his authority whenever someone came to ringside like the Hart Foundation or Paul Bearer. Taker delivered some impact moves of his own like the chokeslam from the apron into the middle of the ring along with even being able to power out of the sharpshooter. In the end, Bret did something to Shawn (ironically the same thing he's remembered for doing to Vince only a few months later) that caused Shawn to react with a result that nobody, not even Shawn, saw coming.
SummerSlam 97

vs. Shawn Michaels - Although these two are most remembered for their later encounters like Hell In A Cell & Casket Matches, this was the rare forgotten first one-on-one match they ever had against each other. This was one of those crazy encounters that just started off wild & never stopped as Shawn was heavily trying to avoid & running away from Undertaker at all cost to the point where Taker got heavily impatient & threw the referee over the top rope onto Shawn. To steal a line from Steve Austin, Taker ""opened up a can of whoop-ass"" on Shawn Michaels from that point forward by beating him up the ramp, on the stage (including a press slam that you just knew had to hurt), down the ramp to the point where Shawn was begging for the referee to stop the match but there was one problem...the match didn't even start yet. This match was just crazy from start to finish with Shawn heavily trying to rely on his partnerships with Triple H, Chyna, and Rick Rude while the referees kept getting abused & wrestlers had to come out from the back to try to separate these two before Taker delivered a ""highlight reel"" moment just to get more of Shawn.
""In Your House: Ground Zero"" Sept. 97
[Best Of In Your House]

Hell In A Cell Match vs. Shawn Michaels - Due to how out of hand their previous match got, Undertaker once again made history by being the first participant in a new innovative match...Hell In A Cell. This set the standard for future Cell matches & for being the first one, this was really something to watch. They dished out heavy punishment like never before & used everything they could get their hands on such as the steel steps & chairs to the point where Shawn was bleeding so much that his face would be what Gordon Solie called a ""crimson mask."" Shawn's fall towards the end would later be heavily overshadowed by Mankind's fall less than a year later but still one of the biggest highlights in Cell history along with the debut of Undertaker's brother, Kane. This was something to see for that time...and still is something to see to this day.
""In Your House: Badd Blood"" Oct. 97
[Shawn Michaels: From The Vault; Hell In A Cell]

vs. Kane - This was Undertaker's return since he was set on fire inside of the casket by Kane at the Royal Rumble months earlier with Taker going on the offense with strikes only for them to have no effect as Kane just kept beating on Taker who was covering up in the corner before Taker was able to maneuver himself onto Kane's shoulders attempting to punch him out from there.  Paul Bearer got his shots in as Kane continued to dominate over Taker using the guardrail & steps in the process to the point where he had Taker beat only to pull him up to deliver more punishment including one moment where Taker was about to hit a over the top rope suicide dive onto Kane on the outside only for Kane to use his momentum against him putting Taker straight through the spanish table.  It would eventually be revealed that Taker had a strategy against Kane the entire time that boxing fans would be familiar with which did eventually take it's effect but the damage Kane did during & after the match was perfectly stated by Jim Ross in that Taker ""has never ever been physically dominated as he's been here.""
WrestleMania XIV
[Twisted & Disturbed Life Of Kane]

Inferno Match vs. Kane - For those who've never seen this type of match (currently, there have only been 4 of these types of matches), the ringside is surrounded by fire with the only way to win being to set your opponent on fire.  With the fire being around the ring & occasionally shooting up as high as the top rope, both men were very limited in what they were able to do during the match but still dished out physical punishment towards each other from trading strikes & chokeslams & even a double big boot at one time along while also taking big risk near the fire like Taker's ""old school"" & a top rope superplex.  Kane was able to be tossed over the flames to the outside before meeting up with someone who also wanted his revenge on Kane followed by Taker himself flying over the flames to not only meet Kane on the outside but also finally get his hands on Paul Bearer.  This match was a first of it's kind & knowing the limitations surrounding the match which they were able to surpass, this still stands the test of time to this day.
Unforgiven 98
[Kane: Journey To Hell; Twisted & Disturbed Life Of Kane; Bonus Match On ""Armageddon '06""]

Hell In A Cell Match vs. Mankind - You knew this match was going to be special the moment both men started at the top of the cage where they brawled & almost fell through at one point before Mankind was thrown off the top with Jim Ross yelling his now infamous line ""GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY, THAT KILLED HIM! AS GOD AS MY WITNESS, HE'S BROKEN IN HALF!"" The match looked like it was over with Mankind being put on a stretcher with a dislocated shoulder before he decided to go back up only to be chokeslammed through the cage with the chair on top hitting him in the face on the way down. Taker ended up twisting his ankle coming down from the top as one person who came into the ring to check up on Foley ended up getting chokeslammed out of his shoes before they continued the match with Taker ramming the steps into Mankind's arm multiple times but missed a suicide dive that busted him open allowing Mankind to take advantage using the chair before bringing out a back full of thumbtacks. This was probably the most famous Hell In The Cell match & the match that launched Mick Foley into wrestling immortality for the beating he took from start to finish.

WWE Championship Match vs. The Rock - This match started off with a bang as two referees were knocked out within the first minute of the match followed by both men hitting their signature moves having the other beat but no referee before continuing to brawl to the stage area & into the crowd.  They made their way back to ringside with both men going into the ringside steps at one point as they used whatever they could get their hands on to beat on the other including one moment where Taker blocked Rock's chairshot with the ringbell causing the chair to bounce back into Rock's face with even Paul Bearer getting his shot in with his shoe.  Both men eventually made it back into the ring with Taker grounding Rock before Rock made his comeback with a spike DDT before the referee once again got knocked out, desperate tactics were used to knock out one of the contestants, and another man who made it clear he wanted in the WWE Title picture made his presence known.  This was definitely one of the most out of control matches in both men's careers just based off the what happened in the first minute along with the fact that they spend more time on the outside of the ring than in it.
King Of The Ring 99
[Best Of The King Of The Ring]

First Blood Match vs. WWE Champion Steve Austin - This match had a bunch of stipulations surrounding it in that if Vince McMahon would leave WWE if Austin won & Austin could no longer challenge for the WWE Championship if he lost. Both had fresh wounds from bleeding earlier in the night. As expected, this started out as a brawl in the entrance way & went through the crowd. With the object of the match to have your opposition bleed, the head was heavily focused on by both men with various moments like Taker swinging a chair at Austin like a madman while Austin bounced Taker's head off the steel steps. Karma played a big role in the end with Taker getting his receipt for getting involved in another match earlier in the night while Shane McMahon tried to get involved & took the most hellacious chairshot I've ever seen in my life. The fight after the match was just as crazy as the fight before the match with Triple H & The Rock getting involved & continuing their brawl from earlier in the night before Vince McMahon went out swinging.
Fully Loaded 99

vs. Triple H - This was the first major meeting between these two superstars & it got real personal with Triple H busting Taker open requiring a high amount of stitches in his forehead (which you can see up close in the DVD extra interview). This started off wild with the spanish table being broken early before it settled in the ring & Taker got so focused on revenge that he attacked & knocked out the referee in the ring. They took the fight through the crowd into one of the camera towers. Both men did whatever they could to inflict punishment such as Triple H beating the hell out of Taker with a chair & Taker responding with chokeslamming Triple H off the tower & delivering an elbow drop himself. They settled back into the ring where the sledgehammer came into play before Taker extended ""the streak.""
WrestleMania X-7
[Undertaker: The Streak]

vs. WWE Champion Hulk Hogan - Hulk came to the ring riding a motorcycle after destroying Taker's weeks earlier while Taker came to the ring with the weight belt he took from Hogan weeks earlier & used right away as Hogan entered the ring whipping Hogan before the match started only for Hogan to give his receipts with the same belt.  Hogan took control early on using the steps on the outside & various punches while Taker focused on Hogan's leg using the ringpost & submissions like the leglock & half crab before Hogan ""hulked up"" to make his comeback only for Taker to still kick out causing Hogan to resort to using the chair for extra impact which backfired due to a distraction from someone else who had their issues with Hogan.  This was very similar to their previous matches over a decade earlier where Taker was on the offense for most of the match while Hogan fought back but this wasn't anything special quality wise past the result & aftermath of the match.
Judgment Day 02

Hell In A Cell Match vs. WWE Champion Brock Lesnar - Undertaker came into this match with a cast on his hand & wrist due to an injury Brock caused weeks earlier by Brock & used it as a weapon right away against Lesnar to the point that Lesnar was bleeding but Taker also hurt himself in the process. Taker used whatever he could get his hands on against Brock such as being thrown into it various times while his face was grinding against it along with throwing Brock against the steel steps while Heyman tried to get involved on the outside only for him to pay the price to the point where he was busted open as well. Brock came back in a vicious manner using the ringpost & cell to ram Taker before busting him open while also using a chair to eventually break the cast over which effected Taker as we saw later when he tried to lift the steel steps. Both men kept trading momentum beating each other into exhaustion while still being able to counter each others signature moves throughout the match as this overall was a physical war to say the least to the point where everyone involved (including Heyman on the outside of cell) paying the price.
No Mercy 02
[Brock Lesnar: The Next Big Thing; Hell In A Cell]

vs. John Cena - This was a ""rookie vs. veteran"" battle of respect to the point where Undertaker left his bike at the top of the ramp & walked down to the ring before Cena slapped his face resulting in both men started trading fist in the corner. Taker focused on Cena's ribs with bodyshots while using whatever was around him from the barricade & to the apron then focused in Cena's shoulder with moves like the keylock & old school while showing that he was more focused on punishing Cena than winning.  Cena was able to gain an advantage working over the midsection with a spinebuster & shoulderblocks in the corner while using an exposed turnbuckle & barricade to the point where Taker was coughing up blood as Cena continued to punish using his chain & the F.U.  This was Cena's best performance since his debut a year earlier as he showed he was able to stand up & bring the fight while Taker didn't lose a step working with a younger talent.
Vengeance 03

Buried Alive Match vs. Mr. McMahon - Vince came into this match praying to his ""higher power"" before he was busted open & heavily bleeding all over his face...after the first punch as Taker continued to pound on that wound to the point where Vince was wearing the ""crimson mask.""  Taker continued to punish Vince non-stop from repeatedly ramming his crotch into the post, attacking his head with whatever he could get his hands on from the monitor to a steel shovel, choking with the cable cords, and using the steel steps on his ankle before Vince's ""saving grace"" made their presence known but the match itself was just a beat down from the first punch in the ring to the fight on the grave.
Survivor Series 03
[McMahon]

vs. Kane - Kane attacked & helped bury his brother alive at Survivor Series months earlier only for Taker to keep sending various messages to Kane for months teasing the return of Undertaker under his original persona of ""The Deadman"" but we ended up getting more than that as we also saw the return of Paul Bearer. This match was pretty short & sweet with Kane not believing that Taker was really there before Taker not only showed him that he was back & dominated his way to victory over his brother in a way that showed that the ""Deadman"" is back.

[Undertaker: 15-0; Undertaker: The Streak]

(Bonus Match) vs. WWE Champion Bret Hart - This is a rare match between the two due to the fact that it was never shown/released in the United States due to this happening on the WWE's first ever ""European only"" PPV and the match was edited out of the VHS tape released in the U.S. Undertaker got his rematch from SummerSlam months earlier here and Taker was more intense than he usually is by taking the fight right to Bret & brawling down the rampway. Bret while tried to use heel tactics such as exposing the metal under the turnbuckle (only for it to come back to haunt him later), he did his usual offense of working over Taker's legs to take away the height & power advantage by using moves like the Sharpshooter & the figure four. Taker did an unusual strategy by focusing on Bret's chest with stomps & stretches & even punches to the heart. As I said earlier, Taker was very intense in this match & look for revenge against Bret which ultimately cost him in the end because he couldn't control his emotions. It was great match that finally got some exposure past the limited audience that have seen it for years.

(Bonus Match) vs. WWE Champion Kurt Angle - As a side note, you get comments from Angle himself before & after the match about Undertaker in regards to how important this match was in terms of respect.  Undertaker came into this match with a dislocated wrist as both men started feeling each other out early as Angle gained the advantage with takedowns before Taker took control working over the arm with the short arm scissors & Old School followed by Angle making a comeback with back to back suplexes.  They continued to trade momentum with Taker delivering a knockout punch before Angle grounded him with a rear naked choke & back to back suplexes followed by the anklelock & AngleSlam but Taker retaliated with a chokeslam & Last Ride attempt which Angle countered into a fujiara armbar & anklelock that Taker reversed into the triangle choke with Angle later countering another Last Ride attempt into an anklelock.  This was a ""lost classic"" encounter that saw both men continue to beat each other into exhaustion to the point where Angle was cut around his eye and both men recieved a standing ovation at the end of the match.

DVD extras include various vignettes/promos regarding the matches on this set along with two hidden extras of Taker talking about the death of his parents and Paul Bearer revealing to Jerry Lawler what happened the night he conceived Kane.  In the end, this was a great match anthology on Undertaker's career up to this point where you saw a mix of everything: important moments, classic/memorable matches, and rare/lost encounters.  Bottom line, get this...no questions asked.",1140307200,3,22222,4.52728631946175
2352632,3,B000A2X0LE,"This is a pretty good smorgasboard of the Undertakers matches, but I was hoping for more of a documentary angle, to get behind the story of the Phenom. Instead they maintained the storyline of the undertaker really being from the darkside and his feud with ""his brother"" Kane. Bottom line, this DVD is a story on the character of the Undertaker, not the story of Mark Calloway. Still a good DVD. It's amazing to see how mobile he was when he first started out!!",1139529600,,461,4.5
2352633,4,B000A2X0LE,"Wow. What a run it's been for the Undertaker. From 1990 until the present, the Undertaker has been a mainstay in the WWE for quite some time, along with Shawn Michaels, and in some cases HHH. Even though he may be criticized for some things nowadays, no one can deny the impact the Undertaker has had on the industry of wrestling and the WWE overall. What started as a regular gimmick turned into one of those legendary characters in WWE history, and this 3 DVD set explains why. Here's my review of the matches:
Disk 1

Survivor Series 1991 vs. Hulk Hogan, * (Most people give this match a DUD with good reason. But in my case, it's worth a look to see the Undertaker score what was @ that time a shocking pin over Hogan. Terrible match though.)

Royal Rumble 1994 vs. Yokozuna, *1/2 (This match continues to get a tremendously bad rep to this day, simply because of the post match activities, and I'll have to agree. This Casket Match is nothing to write home about @ any rate.)

WrestleMania XII 1996 vs. Diesel, ***1/2 (A pretty good match, as Diesel was pretty much on his way to WCW around this time. This was Diesel's 4th or 5th best match ever by the way.)

In Your House Buried Alive vs. Mankind, ** (An average match between these two long time rivals. Here, they skipped over the history @ the King Of The Ring 96 and Summerslam 96. Undertaker and Mankind took some good bumps, but nothing overly exciting.)

In Your House Revenge of Taker vs. Mankind, ***1/2 (In what has to be the best match in their series, this match for the WWF title was pretty good as well. Also, they skipped over the Survivor Series 96 match as well.)

SummerSlam 1997 vs. Bret Hart, *** (A decent match, with Shawn Michaels as the guest referee. Nothing real special here though.)

Disk 2

In Your House Ground Zero vs. Shawn Michaels, **** (An excellent match for the first meeting between these two. It ended with the ref throwing match out, justifying the AWESOME rematch.)

In Your House Badd Blood - Hell in a Cell Match vs. Shawn Michaels, ****3/4 (And here is that rematch, still a CLASSIC to this day and Undertaker's best match ever. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the finish with Kane.)

WrestleMania XIV vs. Kane, **1/2 (The first meeting between these two, but not the last. This was actually the best match in their series, although that's not saying much.)

Unforgiven 1998 - Inferno Match vs. Kane, *1/2 (This match was even worse than the WM XIV match. Give it a look if you never seen it before, but be prepared to be bored.)

King of the Ring 1998 - Hell in a Cell Match vs. Mankind, *1/2 (Wow. What can I say about this match that hasn't been said already? Foley took two of the most legendary bumps in the history of the WWE. Even though it won match of the year in 98, it was anything but. But it is worth a look @ any rate.)

King of the Ring 1999 vs. The Rock, ** (Could've been better, but it was *a little* on the slow side on this one.)

WrestleMania XVII vs. Triple H, **1/2 (Another decent match. This was the first PPV meeting between these two. WORLDS better than their King Of The Ring 2002 match if any of you have ever seen that match.

Judgment Day 2002 vs. Hulk Hogan, DUD (NO redeeming qualities about this match. They stunk up the joint in this one. Next.)

No Mercy 2002 - Hell in a Cell Match vs. Brock Lesnar, *** (Another pretty good Hell In A Cell involving the Undertaker. He sold for Lesnar HUGE in this match. Several amounts of blood for those that care about that sort of thing.)

Vengeance 2003 vs. John Cena, **(Hindsight being 20/20, they should've given Cena the big win in this match. Undertaker dominated this one in a way.)

Survivor Series 2003 - Buried Alive Match vs. Mr. McMahon, * (Not much to say about this, except that Undertaker beat McMahon to a bloody pulp until Kane ran in.)

WrestleMania XX vs. Kane, *1/2 (After using the American Bad A** persona, Undertaker made his long awaited return to the DeadMan gimmick on this night. The entrance was incredible.)

2352634,3,B000A2X0LE,"The Undertaker is one of the all time greats to ever in the wrestling world wether you like it or not. The Phenom has stood tall for over 10 years in the WWF/WWE and is now parts of his great career have been put into this 3-disc collection.

As you'd expect it kicks off with the dead mans debut at survivor series back in 1990. But, you would expect that his first match would be shown in its entirety, but it's not. Just 5 seconds of highlights from it then skips to a year later when he took on Hulk Hogan at a Wrestlemania 1991. I'm annoyed that they have only snippets and highlights of only few of the matches he made in his debut year. And I'm also surprised at how they didn't even bother to show his first one on one match or the reason people feared him was because he was taking away his beaten up opponents in body bags.

But it skips to his bout with Hogan, and then doesn't even mention that he suffered his first ever loss to Hogan in the Tuesday In Texas rematch. Then it completely skips everything between 1992 and goes to the end of 1993 when he took on Yokozuna in the first ever casket match. That S###s me because at Wrestlemania 13 he had a short but memorable match against a guy who is 7 foot 6 who called himself The Giant Gonzales. Then they had a small bout going on where the Undertaker eventually ended his career. To see someone actually make Mark Calloway look small deserves to be shown on this set, but it isn't. And neither are his days with and against the Ultimate Warrior. Or how he was we born when Ted Dibiase brought the Undertaker back and Paul Bearer said ""thats not my undertaker"" and so a match at Summerslam 94 was held of the Undertaker VS Undertaker... but it shows 2 seconds of that match... the lead up to it was great, the match was a bit boring, but still deserved to be shown in its entirety...but its not :(

Everything is forgotten once again as it skips to Wrestlemania 12 in the match against Diesel (better known today as Kevin Nash) then it moves ahead some time to when Mankind joined the WWF in 1996. And follows the steady coarse from there. But so much more is still missing in between things here and there. And tho I hated the song, the Limp Bizket theme he had (Rollin, Rollin, Rollin) has been edited out and you only hear the intro before the actually song of American Badass by Kid Rock. If they cut out stuff because of copyrights to songs, then why didn't they just skip to the match in progress?

Also, like so many other WWE releases that contain WWF footage, they keep blurring out the old WWF logo, wether it be on shirts, the ring, banners etc... WHY? Are they ashamed of it, or pretend it doesn't exist? If the World Wildlife Foundation tried to sue the WWE over showing there old logo that spelt WF then they'd have no case and be wasting there time. Why the hell do they do that?

The bonus features aren't much, there's a couple of decent matches, but most of its interviews and promos. It would be nice to actually have had some interviews with the Undertaker and even maybe some audio commentary, but I guess they want everyone to believe the Undertaker really is what he is for 20 mins every Thursday night.

Overall, it's good to see the early days when the Undertaker was a slow moving phenom that scared the kids and made the adults laugh with his scary face. Then moving onto the late 90's when he took a darker side of a different kind, then into the later years when he was a normal guy who felt pain, sweated, talked trash and changed his theme song every month... which completely was the opposite of what the Undertaker started out as, but I did find some of the things he did funny, but they don't even show him being escorted away by police and being a smartarse to them and saying, ""mind if we stop off and get some donuts on the way down town"" or something like that.

Then the whole thing ends with when he was buried alive by Vince Mac Mahon and his so called brother Kane who used to be Isaacs Yankem and the fake Diesel but the WWE would dare not show the Undertakers great matches against them (that's sarcasm, they made a big mistake in those early vs Ted Turner days) then it wraps up with the Kane Speech about how the Undertaker wasn't a monster anymore blah blah blah then shows there match at Wrestlemania 20,000 when the Undertaker supposedly returned to the dark side, but hasn't quite gotten there. Then that's it, says he dominated for over 10 years and is still a force to be recon with unlike this DVD which I'm sure will be outdone in a few years time when they release another version when he retires and make it a 5 disc one and still leave all the stuff you remember out of it.

Overall: It's Ok if you rent it or something. But unless you're a die hard Taker fan, don't pay full price.",1138752000,,4804,4.283039647577093

Matches from Wrestlemania where the Dead-Man is Undefeated, WWE title matches, a inferno match, a First Blood Match, a Casket match, 2 Buried-Alive matches, great grudge matches and 3 historic Hell in the Cell matches! The Undertaker would be proud of this DVD. It is definitely a MUST-HAVE!",1137715200,,365,4.903225806451613
2352636,5,B000A2X0LE,"Out of all the great legends that have come & go throughout the WWE, one man has remained in the WWE & that man is The Undertaker. And finally, he gets a DVD set dedicated to him but one thing to mention is that this is a set that just focuses on the matches instead of it being a biography, however most of the matches are definitely DVD worthy quality.

Matches Include:
vs WWE Champion Hulk Hogan. This was during the time that Taker was put over as the unstoppable monster while Hogan played the hero (as always). They told a good story with Taker dominating the action till Hogan made a comeback that was eventually interrupted by Ric Flair & Paul Bearer that lead to Taker winning his first World Title a year after his debut.
(Survivor Series '91)

Casket Match vs WWE Champion Yokozuna. They went back & forth using weapons like a chair & a salt bucket but this ended up being a gang mugging with all of the WWE heels attacking Taker for Yoko to get the victory.
(Royal Rumble '94)

vs Diesel. This was one of Kevin Nash's best matches throughout his career as he actually held his own against Taker in what was a great ""big man vs big man"" match. As an added fact, I always felt that this was Taker's first great WrestleMania match.
(WrestleMania XII)

Buried Alive Match vs Mankind. The best feud of 1996 continued here & just like their previous encounters, this was really something to see as they brawled all over the arena including various times at the grave site along with steel steps & chairs coming into effect to make moves more impactful. One thing to look out for would be Taker's ability as he does a couple of high-risks moves. In the end, Taker wins the match but ends up getting buried alive by the WWE heels.
(In Your House: Buried Alive)

WWE Championship vs Mankind. They picked up right where they left off from the previous match as they just went at it at the opening bell & kept up the aggression throughout. It would get hardcore at times with steel steps, the urn, a chair & water pitcher being used with the highlight being Taker hitting Mankind with the steel steps that sent him flying through the wooden announce table headfirst. Taker wins & gets his revenge on Paul Bearer by throwing a fireball in his face.
(In Your House: Revenge Of The Taker)

WWE Championship vs Bret Hart w/Special Referee Shawn Michaels. This match had many stipulations with Bret not being able to wrestle in the U.S. if he didn't win the title along with HBK not being able to wrestle in the U.S. if he shows favoritism towards Undertaker. Taker & Bret worked well together & put on a wrestling clinic with HBK not becoming a factor until the end of the match that lead to the brief but brutal HBK/Taker feud.
(SummerSlam '97)

vs WWE Champion Bret Hart. This was the SummerSlam rematch from the rare One Night Only PPV in England & quite frankly this match topped their SummerSlam match with the crowd actually choosing sides at one point in the match. This was their best match together as Taker worked on Bret's chest & back to the point that he used a different technical offense that he had not shown before with Bret attacking Taker's leg including a figure four leglock around the ringpost. The ending was kinda of a jip but it didn't take away from a match that I consider to be a ""lost classic"".
(One Night Only '97, In The Bonus Section)

vs Shawn Michaels. Due to HBK's actions at SummerSlam, this was their first match that is heavily forgotten about. Taker showed that he was out for revenge more than trying to get a victory as he showed at the opening moments by knocking out the referee. HBK takes a beating in this one while at the same time plays the heel perfectly with Triple H & Chyna getting involved along with more referees getting taken out along the way. The ending was something to see as the WWE locker room tried to stop the match that lead to Taker doing a dive over the top rope onto everyone.
(In Your House: Ground Zero)

Hell In A Cell vs Shawn Michaels. This was the first Hell In A Cell match in WWE history & to this day, I consider this to be the best one that they have done. Both men dished out the punishment like never before with steel chairs & steel steps getting involved including one sick spot where HBK piledrives Taker head first onto the ring steps. HBK is a bloody mess & takes a fall off the top of the Cell that gets overshadowed by Foley's dive a year later & an unexpected debut of Kane to round off this classic match.
(In Your House: Bad Blood)

vs Kane. Their first match in their series of matches & once again, this was their best match together as this was not only a great match but the story of Taker taking more of a beating than he has in the past to the point where it seemed like he was fighting himself at times adding to it before he was able to overcome the challenge after an unprecedented three tombstone piledrivers.
(WrestleMania XIV)

Inferno Match vs Kane. This was quite the site to see as the ring is surrounded by fire which lead to some nice visual effects when ever they did an impactful move. This didn't top their WM match but again it was something to see with Vader having a cameo at one point along with Taker doing another dive over the flames that was really something that you have to see to believe.
(In Your House: Unforgiven)

Hell In A Cell vs Mankind. This was perhaps the most famous match in both men's careers as Mick Foley takes the beating of his life as he was thrown off the Cell at the opening moment of the match before returning to get thrown through the Cell & eventually getting slammed on thumbtacks twice while Taker got busted open after a missed dive through the ropes at one point.
(King Of The Ring '98)

WWE Championship vs The Rock. For those that don't know, this was actually the best match of the night at this PPV in what was a really entertaining match with Taker taking out the referee at the opening bell before attempting to use every dirty heel tactic until Rock was able to return the favor back on Taker with Triple H having a cameo at the end & costing Rock the title.
(King Of The Ring '99)

First Blood Match/End Of An Era vs WWE Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin. The end of the Austin/McMahon feud here as the stipulations here would be Austin never getting a title shot if he loses along with McMahon leaving the WWE if Taker loses. One of their best encounters as it was just an intense brawl with both men selling their injuries & Shane McMahon taking one of the sickest chairshots that I have ever seen in wrestling.
(Fully Loaded '99)

vs Triple H. This was one of both men's best matches in their careers & one of the top WrestleMania matches that still stands to this day. This was a brawl from the start before Taker took out the referee that lead to both men fighting in the crowd up to the electrical equipment with the highlight of Taker chokeslamming HHH from the top stage to the floor. Once both men returned to the ring, they went back & forth that lead to Triple H busting Taker open with the sledgehammer & came within a fraction of ending the streak before Undertaker sent Triple H on his ""Last Ride"" to get his 9th WM victory.
(WrestleMania XVII)

vs WWE Undisputed Champion Hollywood Hulk Hogan. For the first time in 11 years, they battle for the gold again but this match is only memorable for that historical factor & Taker once again winning the WWE Championship.
(Judgment Day '02)

Hell In A Cell vs WWE Champion Brock Lesnar. Taker put Lesnar over as a monster here as he bleed like crazy & sold his hand injury in what was a great match that even had Paul Heyman getting involved at times that even lead to him being a bloody mess at one point. Check out the steel steps impact on Taker's face as it really was sick to hear.
(No Mercy '02)

vs John Cena. This was one of Cena's best matches throughout his career as he actually kept up with Taker in a competitive match that even had Taker bleeding from the mouth at one point before being able to win the match.
(Vengeance '03)

Buried Alive Match vs Vince McMahon. Taker just gives McMahon a non-stop beating to the point where Vince gets busted open after the first punch in less than a minute. It continues from there before Kane made the save to bury Taker alive.
(Survivor Series '03)

vs Kane. The return of the ""Deadman"" character here along with the return of Paul Bearer. Overall, this was just memorable for the entrances as the match itself was more of a squash than anything else.
(WrestleMania XX)

vs WWE Champion Kurt Angle. Kurt mentions before the match is shown that this was one of the greatest matches of his whole career & he was not lying as this was just an awesome wrestling match that really hooked the crowd & had them on the edge of their seats throughout the match. Not much for me to say other than what I just said: One of the greatest matches in SmackDown history.
(SmackDown '03)

Overall, this DVD is worth getting for the matches alone but this set also comes with a couple of promos so this is worth going out of your way to see.",1137196800,,9089,4.375222288085359
2352637,4,B000A2X0LE,"Tribute DVDs from the WWE are hit-or-miss these days.  Jake Roberts received a fair treatment, but the DVD extras weren't that interesting to me.  The Ultimate Warrior basically got bashed and trashed to death, also with poor extras.  Bret Hart and Chris Benoit are the only wrestlers to get a superb DVD.  Add The Undertaker to the last category.  His best matches are all here.  Okay, maybe a few are missing, but how many clashes with Mankind could we stand in a row, or was his run as the American Bad-Ass really his best work?

I feel it's very important to stress that this isn't just a long compilation of matches.  The story and the history of The Undertaker are revealed in this presentation.  The matches are all given enough background and depth in order to help new viewers to appreciate why these matches belong in a 3-Disc set.  Or, for the nostalgic fans like me, these flashbacks bring back great memories.

I won't give a rundown of the matches, because there are plenty of other reviewers who've given a fantastic breakdown on all 3 Discs!  I also give credit to the WWE for giving us the highlights, and cleverly glossing over some weak spots in The Undertaker's career.  For example, his injuries aren't even mentioned, and a couple of years don't even get attention (1995 wasn't a good year for any WWF Superstar).

I have very few gripes against this DVD set are two-fold.  The first is that a couple of the matches aren't that spectacular.  None of them are bad, but several have lost their effect.  The confrontations against Diesel and Kane (WrestleMania 12 and 14) aren't as thrilling as I remember them, plus his 1999 matches (one against The Rock, the other against Stone Cold Steve Austin) aren't his best, and show the more vulnerable side of The Undertaker.

Another downside is one that any fan of the WWE will share.  Frankly, a couple of my favorites are missing.  I miss the Boiler Room Brawl against Mankind (SummerSlam 1996), or the matches against Kurt Angle from 2000.  The Undertaker's 2002 feud with Ric Flair led to their awesome battle at WrestleMania 18, which led to The Undertaker's eventual title win over Hulk Hogan at Judgment Day 2002 (which did make the disc).  Then The Undertaker's title reign ended in a strong Triple Threat match against Kurt Angle and The Rock.  I would gladly liked to have revisited any of those.

My last complaint is that the DVD Extras are fine, but there's too few of them.  The first Disc features the patience-testing ""One Night Only"" rematch against Bret Hart, but is redeemed by some nice spots.  The same goes for Discs Two and Three - both have some nice promo footage, but too little of it.  I think that if the DVD Extras were placed on a 4th Disc, than you'd have more room to appreciate the different eras of The Undertaker (Phenom/Ministry/American Bad Ass/Dead Man).  Again, what's here is good enough, but there's so much more to The Undertaker than what's here.

Nevertheless, if you're a fan of The Undertaker, then this 9-hour compilation is defintely worth your time.  In fact, this tribute is one that any WWE fan should check out.  Watching The Undertaker brought me a sense of awe and inspiration.  His unfailing determination, mysterious mind games, and intimidating physical presence.  The Undertaker is an iconic figue in wrestling that all fans should check out!",1136937600,2,3365,4.736660929432014
2352638,5,B000A2X0LE,"1/ Teddy Long and SmackDown! suck

-What did Teddy Long do to deserve being Smackdown GM? If you guys still remember the night he was announced as GM, everybody hated him. He hasn't done one good thing for SmackDown. Now the upcoming pay per view is No way out, sm has no good talents so they have to take Kane to be the main eventer with that stupid champ Batista. This batista is not the batista we had seen in Evolution. The changed, not an animal anymore. And hes got a back injury, he cant carry smackdown. If Vince is a little more smart, bring HHH to Smackdown, instead of creating feud with the Big Show. THE ONLY LEGEND ON SMACKDOWN NOW IS THE UNDERTAKER !!!!

2/John Cena sucks

-in the taboo tuesday main event, HBK kicked out of a angle slam from the top rope. AND HE CAN'T KICK OUT OF A STUPID F.U.

-JOhn cena is still champ because he's making money for Vince McManhon.-

-the stupid McManhon family is turning WWE into a joke. This is wrestling, not a rapping competition

-John Cena can't wrestle, his moves suck

Those are the reasons why you stupid people should stop cheering for John Cena and start booing his @$$.

2352639,5,B000A2X0LE,"This is a great DVD set. I was under the impression that it was going to be a full documentary set of the undertaker. But instead it was just the matches. I was fine about hearing that but I expected it to be like the Ric Flair DVD where the Undertaker would say something about the match before it started. But there's nothing. The only interview in this DVD is with Kurt Angle. And by the way the match with Undertaker and Kurt Angle match proves that Undertaker is a great wrestler. But then again some people are under the impression that Undertaker needs somebody good to have a great match. Either way I wished that Undertaker did have a match with Kurt Angle at Wrestle Mania or Summerslam as Kurt said in the interview. That match is great and I'm glad that it's on here. But the ending sucked with Brock Lesner coming in. It was just like the ""Mindgames"" ending with Mandkind and Shawn Michaels. Great match, bad ending.

The matches are good but I can still say there are some matches missing. The boiler room braw match with Mandkind at Summerslam '96 I think was better than the first 2 matches here with Mankind combine. Also I don't see why the match with Sid Vicious at Wrestle Mania 13 isn't in here. There is also a mistake here saying that, that match was on April 5 1992 and that it was Wrestle Mania 7. But I think the match with Jack the Snake Roberts at Wrestle Mania 8 should've been on here. Also they should've put the Royal Rumble '98 match with Shawn Michaels instead of the Ground Zero match. I think the only highlight of that match was when Undertaker flew over the top rope on to all these superstars. Also I never really liked the matches with Kane but whatever. At least it has both Bret Hart matches at Summerslam and One Night Only. Like maybe other Undertaker fans I didn't really like the American Badass Undertaker. I don't see why the match with Vince is on here. Undertaker throws one punch and Vince starts bleeding like crazy.

The extras are ok, but I just wished they were a little bit longer than there were. There's also easter eggs here. On disk 2 Go to the Chapters section. Highlight the Wrestlemania 14 chapter. Click right twice. A Raw interview featuring Paul Bearer discussing sex with the Undertaker's mother will begin to play and on disk 3 Go to the Chapters section, highlight the Wrestlemania XX chapter. Click left twice. A promo from RAW where the Undertaker explains how his parents died will begin to play.

I hate how there is no documantery but showing bits and pieces of Undertakers carrer between matches are pretty cool. But still I wish Undertaker had something to say. And I'm sure he didn't pick these matches. I'm sure if he did it would've been a lot more balanced.

You might notice the ""This is My Yard"" DVD skips over the darkside era, which disappointed me. There are a few things missing from this DVD. It needed to be structured a little better. All the great matches should have been grouped together in their entirety. His victories over Giant Gonzales, The Big Bossman, and Randy Orton are not included here. Also his 1994 Summerslam match against ""The Fake"" Undertaker should have been shown too. Also some retrospective from the man himself was needed.

2352682,3,B000A2X0LE,"The Undertaker is one of the more memorable WWE figures of recent time.  He's one of the few superstars to survive the changes in style from the cartoonish WWF to the New Generation to the Attitude Era to today's WWE.  Paying tribute to his career with a multi-DVD set is a given.

Unfortunately, while somewhat entertaining, this set falls short in so many different ways.  The first of which is the presentation of the box set design.  The outer box design is fine; it's the inner packaging that annoys me.  The DVDs are stored one on top of the other.  Who in their right mind chose to make it so you'd have to remove practically all of the other DVDs in order to get to the other?

Taker's WWE career has spanned well over a decade, so I expected a great archive of match-ups.  In theory, this set has a lot of matches.  However, the majority of these matches are cut up, which lessens the enjoyment, in my opinion.  Ric Flair has had a longer career with far more matches to choose from, yet the WWE still presented a great deal of full-length matches from every period of the man's career in the Flair boxed set a few years back.  Why couldn't they have done that here?

And then, of course, there's the order of the matches and promos.  It doesn't make a lick of sense.  The material jumps all over the place.  I got a case of whiplash watching this set.

One final nitpick I need to make... and maybe some of you will agree with me.  Part of Taker's gimmick is that he's undefeated at WrestleMania, 14-0 at last count.  Wouldn't it have been a nice feature to have all those matches in full-length form somewhere within this set?  Some of Taker's WrestleMania bouts are here, but not all of them and not in their entirety, either.

This set is entertaining.  It's always nice to look back at classics like the Taker/Foley HITC match and Taker's first HITC with Shawn Michaels (which features the debut of ""brother"" Kane), but there are far too many negatives to make this boxed set a must have.",1130198400,3,2002,4.427397260273972

To stack 3 discs on top of each other is crazy, expecially when the WWE has made several other impressive 2/3 disc collections. This packaging was a little insulting to The Undertaker as well as his fans.

As for the material on the DVD's, many fans have objected to not including his very early work, and while the occasional Squash match from SuperStars is cool, I didn't really miss it. I did however feel that these collections lose steam when they just put PPV matches on them. If you are buying a 3 disc collection for anything (not just wrestling) you are a fan. Fans generally have or have seen the high profile, ""popular"" matches. I really wish they would have put more RAW and rare matches on this collection. I do have to say the Bret Hart match from One Night Only was worth the price for me. It's a very good match and was nice to see in DVD quality.

While the rest of the discs delve into the Undertaker's 13+ career in the WWE, the one thing that was really missing is insight to THE MAN. I really enjoy DVD's where the guy would talk about where they were at that point in their careers, how they feel matches go, and basically their take on the match. Plus it's always fun to hear what current Superstars say about guys they work with and what they thought of the matches before they got into the business.  The WWE produced this DVD without consulting the Undertaker. So it's narrated like everything is Kayfabe. You don't get to hear from anyone about the Undertaker. I think that while this is indeed a great collection of matches to have, I feel that the previous Undertaker release ""It's My Yard"" is a better pleaser for hardcore fans.

There were two things that bothered me about this DVD set. It was the fact that they didn't add any real biography on how his character was developed and how he grew up. They other thing was that they didn't show any matches from his mid and late 1998 year. I would of loved to see his battle with Stone Cold at Summerslam 1998.

Overall, this is just really enjoyable, the DVD extras are really cool to watch. All of his scenes done in the cemetary are awesome, just some wonderful acting by the Undertaker.

You won't see any footage or hear any cute stories of his childhood, pre-wrestling days, or even his tenure in WCW as ""Mean Mark"".  This collection is a summation of the Undertaker's character, told through his 21 most prolific matches, as well as interviews and promotion vignettes (""promos"" for those versed in wrestle-speak).  This nicely-forged 3-DVD set spans the Undertaker's career, from the time he entered WWE in 1991 to his bone-chilling return to glory at Wrestlemania XX in 2004.

Disc 1 begins with the Undertaker's beginning, when he made his debut with WWE, and reveals his first 6 years of domination.  It does a good job of showing the ""supernatural"" persona of the Undertaker; how he was completely unstoppable by any man, machine, or even death itself (after all, he's the ""Dead Man""; how can you kill him?)  Highlights on this disc include the first ever ""Casket Match"" (to win, you have to put your opponent in a coffin and shut the lid) and ""Buried Alive Match"" (to win, you have to...well, you get the idea) and his tainted victory over the aforementioned Hogan for the WWF Heavyweight Championship.

Moving on to Disc 2, we see the Undertaker mature from a mumbling, mysterious behemoth into a truly frightening spectre who took hold of his audience and made them believe with all their hearts that he was evil incarnate.  The ""atrocities"" he and his ""Ministry of Darkness"" committed on television (ritual sacrifices, kidnappings, crucifixions, etc.) are thankfully omitted in the interest of the Taker's younger fans, but there's plenty of other gut-churning stuff here; most notably the now-historic ""Hell in a Cell"" matches with Shawn Michaels and Mankind (Mick Foley), his most tenacious rival.  Wrestling fans know this match all too well, and it still makes us all cringe to see the punishment Foley goes through and see him come back for more.  There's also the debut of Taker's unholy brother, Kane, and their feud, which culminated in the first-ever ""Inferno Match"" (where you must set your opponent literally ablaze).

Disc 3 takes us through the last part of the Undertaker's ""ultra-evil"" phase, his mysterious disappearance for several months, and subsequent repackaging as a Harley-riding street fighter.  This incarnation proved to be very popular with the fans, and ended up lasting almost four years before he was ""buried alive"" for the second time by Kane.  For the Undertaker, though, death is only a temporary setback, and at the end of the story we see him return as the Dead Man we all know and love, soundly defeating his brother.  Other highlights include another vicious ""Hell in a Cell"" (vs. Brock Lesnar) and a classic tango with Triple H, both for the coveted Heavyweight Title, which the Taker has won 4 times during his career.

There's not much else to speak of in this set, other than a short narrative before and after each match to give it that ""documentary"" feel.  As a whole, the way this collection is put together is pretty impressive.  All of the matches are found on the main menu of each disc, and the interviews/promos (along with a couple of outstanding bonus matches) are conveniently stored in the extras menus, which is a nice feature. Undertaker fans will positively drool over it, as they will get all of their favorite matches in one gathering, many of which washed in the cleansing flood of DVD quality.

I did notice a few omissions, though; no mention is made of the controversial ""Fake Undertaker"" or manager Paul Bearer's betrayal.  I really think they should have included Taker's Wrestlemania 21 match with Randy Orton as well.  Disc space was probably the main factor in this, as the comp already clocks in at just over 10 hours total.  I'm not a big fan of the packaging, either; to save shelf space, the discs are stacked atop each other inside a standard DVD case, forcing me to dig through it if I want to watch a particular one.

Aside from those small detractors, though, I really enjoyed sitting through this collection, and it brought back some memories of my younger days as a wrestling fan.  It's definitely worth the price, whether you're a Taker fan or a fan of pro wrestling in general.  A very nice addition to the old collection.",1126828800,4,4742,4.851116625310174
2352714,5,B000A2X0LE,"...enoughs been said about the matches on the DVD already, if you like UT you'll buy this, if ya don't ya won't, it's worth the entry price for the Foley matches alone. However people have been bitching about the packaging, I've got the Region 2 version (being in the UK and all) and it's packaged the same as the Flair disc and the last two Manias with the fold old packaging, which leaves more room for pictures behind the plastic the dvds are located on. If you want to be the envy of your friends get the region 2 edition. I'm tempted to say something like Watch In Peace, but that would be horrific.",1126051200,,604,4.307017543859649
2352715,5,B000A2X0LE,"Hi, I really don't want to annoy you but I am from England and recieved the Undertakers DVD set this morning. I have read reviews on how the packaging in the US is three discs stacked on top of each other. This is not the case with the european version, as it is set out like the Ric Flair DVD. Just thought I would let all those know who were interested in complaining about the packaging to whoever the hell makes it in the US. I know this is not a review of the product but I have seen all the matches here before and believe me this is well worth the five stars and the purchase price.",1125964800,,589,4.0
2352716,4,B000A2X0LE,well i would like to say i really like this dvd. it has all of the greatest matches from the undertaker. im not gonna write a review on all the matches because i would just be saying what evryone else has said. but i would like to say that all of the matches were worth warching. the hell in a cell mayches were the best. the only thing that sucked was the packaging of this dvd. those a**holes packaged the dvd by putting all three dvds on top of eachother. what the hell were they thinking. they shouldve packaged this dvd the way they packaged the wrestlemania dvd. other than the packaging this dvd was very good and enjoyable. it was well worth the money. so if your a fan of the undertaker or just got into wrestling and u like him then buy this dvd.,1125878400,,756,4.184931506849315
2352727,5,B000A2X0LE,"All I can say about this DVD set is that I hope its sales register enough to start a trend!! This is one of the most comprehensive YET affordable WWE DVDs I've seen in a long time. Most of the other reviewers have made remarks about the poor packaging (basically they put 3 DVD's in a case made for 1) but if cheap packaging is the difference between a $22 and $35 price tag I applaud the WWE for taking the more cost effective option. Besides it's what is ON the DVDs that really counts anyway. I won't list all of the matches but there are 21 (most with entrances and pre-match remarks at least from Taker if not both wrestlers; gives a good idea of the context of the match). The only thing I would have added would be interviews with Taker regarding the different points in his career. This set is a must have for even casual wrestling fans!! Bring on the Stone Cold, Rock and Bret Hart sets!!!",1125878400,2,898,4.257309941520468
2352728,5,B000A2X0LE,"The History of the Undertaker takes a look back at some of the most famous matches in history as the Dead Man goes through the Phenom stages up to his American Badass stage and now presently back to the Dead Man era...

With Matches against: HBK, Bret Hart, Mankind, HHH, Hulk Hogan, John Cena, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and others, this is one DVD set you NEED to own!!!!

Disk One Matches:

WWE Championship Match vs. Hulk Hogan: Good match and very legendry as the Dead Man wins his first championship match. Some outside interferance by Ric Flair and Undertaker wins. 8.5/10

Casket Match vs. Yokozuna: Okay, about 10 different guys including Bam Bam Bigelow and Diesel interfere and UT basically fights back but gets overwhelmed. Some weapons were used in the beginning and this was the famous moment after the match when the Undertaker ""Rose Up"" from the dead. 8/10

Wrestlemania vs. Diesel: Basically big man moves, not the best WM match of the UT's. Undertaker wins. 7/10

Buried Alive Match vs. Mankind: This was a great match. Steel steps and chairs made appearances. Both men get knocked around and Mankinds head hits the barricade especially hard. Some guys interfere, including HHH and Goldust, to bury the UT alive after Taker wins the match. 9/10 [For the match itself]

WWE Championship vs. Mankind: Best match of the first disk. I thought this match was brutal. It wasn't No DQ, but both men used weapons and Mankind even gets knocked off the ringside area and went HEADFIRST through an announce table, best spot of the match. Undertaker wins with the tombstone and then lights a fireball into Paul Bearers face. 9.5/10

WWE Championship Match vs. Bret Hart: Great match, I'm a fan of any Bret Heart match. Some technical wrestling by Bret, and even some fast moves by the UT. 9/10

Disk 2 Matches:

WWE Championship Match vs. Shawn Michales: Okay match and this led up to their epic match inside the Hell in a Cell. Shawn was great as the crowd both booed and cheered him. A great match for the second disk. 8.5/10

Hell in a Cell Match vs. HBK: One of the top three Hell in a Cell matches. Steel Steps, chairs, the cage itself, and some interference by Kane caused this match to give it a perfect score. Watch UT give a HUGE chairshot to Michales near the end of the match. Great match. 10/10

Wrestlemania match vs. Kane: Best time these two faced each other. Undertaker leaps off the ring ropes and goes crashing into an announce table after missing Kane. Awsome ending with three tombstones!!! UT wins and continues his streak. 9/10

Inferno Match vs. Kane: Great match, the first of its kind! Vader interferes and UT gives a huge leap out of the flames onto both Vader and Kane. A chair and even a drum set were used on both Kane and Paul Bearer. Kane losses when his arm catches fire. 8.5/10

Hell in a Cell match vs. Mankind: One of the most famous moments in history when Taker threw Mankind off the cage. Chairs, steps, and tacks were used in this epic match. 9/10

WWE Championship vs. The Rock: Alwright match, don't really see the significance of it though. Both men fight all over the arena and Rock actually takes some punishment being thrown against the barricades. HHH interferes and UT wins with the tombstone. 8/10

Disk Three Matches:

First Blood Match vs. Stone Cold: The best match in Disk Three and my personal favorite. The atmosphere and the excitment were off the charts. Shane McMahon and X-Pac, plus Mr. McMahon make an appearance in this match. Stone Cold wins after busting the UT wide open. 10/10

Wrestlemania Match vs. HHH: One of Takers best WM matches, if not THE best. They fight all over the place with chairs and even the sledgehammer makes an appearance. Taker even chokeslams HHH off the side of a monitor tower. The UT wins despite getting hit over the head with the hammer and continues his undefeated streak at WM. 9/10

WWE Championship Match vs. Hulk Hogan: Okay match, just shown to show when Taker won his fourth title. Mr. McMahon makes a brief appearance, gets the crap kicked out of him, and then Taker levels Hogan with a chair and wins the title. 8/10

Hell in a Cell Match vs. Brock Lesnar: Would have been better if not for Heyman's moaning, it was really annoying. Taker bleeds heavily, and Brock wins his undeserving Hell in a Cell victory. Steel Steps and a chair make an appearance in this match. 8.5/10

Vengeance Match vs. John Cena: Pretty good for the rookie at that time. The Vengeance crowd that night was great, so it helped this match. Taker hurt his ribs and bleed from the mouth, but fought back and won with the last ride. 8/10

Buried Alive Match vs. Mr. McMahon: On paper this sounds like a must see match, but all Taker does in beat the crap out of McMahon with a shovel and steel steps and McMahon bleeds heavily. Kane interferes and buries the UT alive. 8/10

Wrestlemania Match vs. Kane: One of the best ring entrances in quite some time. But I think the entrance by Ut was even longer than the match itself! Nothing special, and Ut wins to continue his streak. 7/10

Well, there you have it. The one thing I see wrong is that all three disks are packed on top of each other instead of a different holder for each of them in the DVD case. Would have been a lot professional looking if they weren't stacked on top of each other. Other than that this is a great DVD collectible.",1125187200,29,5368,4.556133056133056
2352729,4,B000A2X0LE,"I have been a fan of Mark's since he was part of The Skyscrapers in WCW and I have a huge collection of Undertakers stuff and will remain a fan forever. I purchased the Ric Flair set and was impressed. Taker's set was bad packaging, no one on one interviews with superstars and NOT even ONE personal interview with Mark or his wife Sara. I felt the matches picked were excellent BUT this set lacked the power that Flair's did. The way the discs are stacked on top of each other is CHEAP and the artwork is just plain. BOY WWE especially Vince....this is the way you show respect to THE MAN who never left your company and fought thru pain and other things to make your company money....two words to you Vince...""YOU'RE FIRED!""",1125187200,5,726,4.425373134328358
2352730,5,B000A2X0LE,"Tombstone: The History Of The Undertaker tells a roughly 6 hour story about this WWE Superstar's rise to main event status from 1991 until 2004. Aside from the bad packaging, I was very pleased with this DVD. Now, here is what you'll find on here:

Disc 1

Undertaker Vs. Hulk Hogan (WWE Championship) - The Undertaker wins his first WWE title after being in the organization for only a year! Guest appearance from ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair.

Undertaker Vs. Yokozuna (RIP)(WWE Championship Casket Match) - This ends up being more of a gang mugging as several WWE stars help out Yoko! Still significant as it shows the fighting spirit of UT in a losing effort.

Undertaker Vs. Diesel - This was from WrestleMania 12 and one of Kevin Nash's better bouts!

Undertaker Vs. Mankind (Buried Alive Match) - Foley, as usual, takes a beating from UT! UT wins the match but ends up getting buried alive by Mankind, The Executioner (Terry Gordy in a mask/RIP) and several other heels!

Undertaker Vs. Mankind (WWE Championship Match) - Undertaker had just won his second WWE title a month earlier. Foley takes another beating including a head first dive into a table!

Undertaker Vs. Bret Hart (WWE Championship Match) - ""HBK"" Shawn Michaels is the special referee in this one as this was otherwise a classic bout! Guest appearances from Paul Bearer, Owen Hart (RIP) and Brian Pillman (RIP). The ending leads up to the brief but brutal Michales/Undertaker feud!

BONUS MATCH: Undertaker Vs. Bret Hart from One Night Only in England! Awesome bout! Perhaps better than their Summerslam encounter.

EXTRAS ON DISC 1

Undertaker attacks Hogan in the Funeral Parlor

Undertaker builds a casket for Yokozuna

Undertaker talks about Diesel in the graveyard

Undertaker talks about Mankind in the graveyard

Undertaker interrupts Mankind's interview

DISC 2

Undertaker Vs. Shawn Michaels (In Your House: Ground Zero) - This was the first bout and it is a wild affair with guest stars HHH and Chyna!

Undertaker Vs. Shawn Michaels (Hell In The Cell) - The first ever Hell In The Cell! Set the bar for future HITC bouts!

Undertaker Vs. Kane (WrestleMania 14) - This bout was the first ever meeting between these two and probably the best between these two!

Undertaker Vs. Kane (Inferno Match) - Not a great bout BUT does have an awesome dive by 'Taker over the fire onto Kane and Vader!

Undertaker Vs. Mankind (Hell In The Cell) - The worst beating of Mick Foley's life. People can talk about HHH ending Foley's career in this same type of match but, in my eyes, it was UT that shortened Foley's career as the beating he gave Mick was far worse than what HHH did to him!

Undertaker Vs. The Rock (WWE Championship Match) - Very entertaining in that The Rock is his usual defiant self against UT! Guest appearance from HHH in this one!

EXTRAS ON DISC 2

Undetaker interview right after SummerSlam '97 concerning Shawn Michaels

Undertaker talking to her parents' tombstones

Undertaker interview where Kane burns their parents' tombstones

Undertaker breaks into Paul Bearer's house and mauls him!

DISC 3

Undertaker Vs. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin (WWE Championship/First Blood Match) - Your basic brawl! Interference from HHH, The Rock, Shane McMahon and Vince McMahon.

Undertaker Vs. HHH (WrestleMania X-7) - Probably one of the best WM bouts ever!

Undertaker Vs. Hulk Hogan (WWE Championship Match) - This is a rematch 12 years later for the same championship!

Undertaker Vs. Brock Lesner (WWE Championship Match/Hell In The Cell) - One of the top 5 HITC bouts ever! Taker bleeds like a stuck pig! Not for the squemish!

Undertaker Vs. John Cena - Interesting to see John in heel mode here! Actually does a good job staying with 'Taker.

Undertaker Vs. Mr. McMahon (Buried Alive Match) - Not much of a bout but McMahon takes a HUGE A** WHIPPIN' HERE! 'Taker loses when Kane interferes.

Undertaker Vs. Kane (WrestleMania 20) - Nowhere near as good as their original encounter BUT the entrances make it worth viewing.

EXTRAS ON DISC 3

BONUS MATCH: Undertaker Vs. Kurt Angle from Smackdown in 2003!

This a good set even if the packaging was not up to par! I would also recommend getting Undertaker: This Is My Yard as well as it goes more into UT's career BEFORE WWE! Between those two DVD's, you'll have his whole career up until 2004! Recommended set!",1125187200,117,4491,4.833551769331586
2352731,4,B000A2X0LE,"This is a 3 disc set compiling the WWF/WWE career of Mark Callaway (The Undertaker) from 1991 - 2003. The chapters are narrated by an unknown presenter. All of the matches are shown in their entirety, and are given a pre-match history with video clips.

The following are my ratings of the matches based out of 5 *****:

Disc 1:

WWF Championship Match vs. Hulk Hogan(C) 11/27/91 - This is your usual Hogan match in which Hogan gets beat up and then ""Hulks Up"" and plants the big boot and leg drop. The only difference is Ric Flair gets involved, and Hulk gets ""Tombstoned"" on a chair.  But it is historically significant as it is The Undertaker's first Championship match.  Rating  - **1/2  (13min)

WWF Championship Match vs. Yokozuna(C) 1/22/94 - This is notable for actually getting to witness a match with Yokozuna as WWF Champion.  The match is the basic big man slug-fest until Yokozuna thows salt in the Undertaker's eyes and then spike-slams The Deadman on a chair and then lands a belly-to-belly suplex on him! The match gets interrupted when the entire Royale Rumble crew comes into the ring and assaults The Undertaker.  It's cool getting to see Jeff Jarrett and Kabuki attack the Undertaker. Cool ending.  Rating - **1/2 (20min)

vs. Diesel (Wrestlemania XII) - This is a pretty good match.  Big Daddy Cool (Kevin Nash) actually looks decent here.  He beats The Phenom up real bad.  Diesel lands a body-splash guillotine and back-to-back jackknife slams on The Undertaker! But The Evil One rises up only to be sidewalked slamed! Diesel was soon to jump to greener pastures with WCW after this match. Not bad Kevin. Rating  - ***1/2 (16min)

Buried Alive Match vs. Mankind 10/20/96 - Maknkind (Mick Foley) takes a pounding from The Undertaker. The Deadman picks up one of the steel steps and slams it onto Mankind's head, ""Tombstones"" Mankind and then puts a chair over Mick's face and proceeds to land a huge leg-drop on his face! Undertaker choke-slams Mankind into the grave but interference from Pallbearer's henchmen (HHH,Goldust,Crush) help to save Mankind.  Check the ending! Rating - ***1/2 (18min)

WWF Championship Match vs Mankind 4/20/97 - The Undertaker is the reigning Champion. Once again poor Mick gets a beating. This time The Undertaker takes a steel step and rams it into Mankind's face knocking Mankind over the top rope and landing on the announcer's table breaking it to pieces! A alot of hard ""bumps"". Check the ending! Rating - **** (17min)

WWF Championship Match vs. Bret Hart 8/3/97 - A FANTASTIC match with HBK as guest referee! Watch this and witness Bret Hart putting a figure 4 and sharpshooter on The Phenom using the ring post for leverage! You also get to see a cameo of Brian Pillman(RIP) and Owen Hart(RIP)! Great match! Rating - ***** (28min)

Extra match: WWF Championship Match vs Bret Hart(C) 9/20/97 - This match was performed in England on PPV and is unavailable except on this DVD. Another awesome performance by both men. Classic is all that needs to be said! Rating - ***** (29min)

Disc 2:

vs. Shawn Michaels 9/7/97 - This match came about as a result of the Bret Hart match. There is 6 minute brawl between the two before the match even starts! The referees take a beating! HHH and Chyna get speared as The Undertaker makes a running leap over the top rope onto both of them! A decent match. Rating - **** (30min)

Hell In A Cell vs. Shawn Michaels 10/5/97 - Great match. The first Hell In A Cell match and it sets the bar high! Awesome and bloody! The 1st appearance of Kane. Rating - ****1/2 (30min)

vs. Kane Wrestlemania XIV - The Undertaker leaps over the top rope and lands on the announcer's table smashing it apart! Kane reverses The Undertakers ""Tombstone"" and lands it on The Undertaker! Check the ending. A very good match. Rating - ***1/2 (16min)

Inferno Match vs Kane 4/26/98 - The ring is surrounded by fire. Undertaker does a top rope suplex on Kane! Vader attacks Kane on the outside and The Undertaker leaps out of the ring, over the surrounding flames and spears both men! Rating - ***1/2 (16min)

Hell In A Cell Match vs Mankind 6/28/98 - Best known for Mankind getting tossed off the top of the cage onto the announcer's table and then being ""last ride"" slamed onto thumbtaks! Rating ****1/2 (for the sick ""bumps"" Foley endures). (20min)

WWF Championship Match vs the Rock 6/27/99 - Undertaker is current Champion. The Rock always entertains! The Rock gets beat up by The Undertaker and then gets ""pedigreed"" by HHH! The Brahma Bull fights hard. Rating  - **** (25min)

Disc 3:

WWF Championship First Blood Match vs Steve Austin(C)7/25/99 - The first one to bleed loses. An all out brawl. Vince McMahon is in a wheelchair but still tries ti interfere along with Shane McMahon and XPac. Rating - **** (21min)

VS HHH Wrestlemania XVII - ""The American Badass"" is the new nom de plum for Mark Callaway. HHH gets choke-slamed off the top of the mixer's platform onto the floor! It looks crazy but the replay shows the floor is padded which takes away the initial shock and awe. The fight slpiis outside the ring into the audience and back. HHH does well! Rating - **** (20min)

WWE Championship Match vs Hulk Hogan(C) - Thier first match together since 1991. Hogan is hurt and on his way out.  Hulk out up a valiant battle with his injured knee noticeably slowing the Hulkster down. Good effort Hulkster! Check the ending. Rating - ***1/2 (13min)

WWE Championship Hell In A Cell Match vs Brock Lesnar(C) 10/20/02 - AWESOME! Brock's best match! Undertaker bleeds rivers! This is absolutely violent and friggen' nonstop action! I loved this match! Rating - ***** (27min)

vs John Cena 7/27/03 - Cena disrespected and now it's payback time! Cena actually looks pretty good. Not bad Prototype. Rating - ***1/2 (16min)

Buried Alive Match vs Vince McMahon 11/16/03 - Vince bleeds like a stuck pig! Very bloody! Vince takes a beating you have to see! Rating - ***(just for seeing Vince get pummeled) (12min)

vs Kane Wrestlemania XX - Nothing special. Rating - **1/2 (8min)

Extra:

WWE Championship Match vs Kurt Angle - The best match on the disc and its clipped because it was shown on Smackdown. Kurt Angle brings out the best in everyone. I can't wait for his own DVD becaue he is the BEST! Awesome match. The best Undertaker match ever! Rating - ***** (16min clipped)

The drawbacks are no interviews with Mark about his career or his thoughts about the matches. And the disc doesn't mention his formative years in WCW before joining WWF. The packaging is lame. Overall, I would get this just for the Bret Hart, Brock Lesnar and Kurt Angle matches.",1125100800,4,6628,4.7237185056472635
2352732,5,B000A2X0LE,"Ok, I gotta give my 2cents about this 3dvd history of the undertaker set. Many people are knocking the packaging..Think about this, the cost for this 3dvd set was $16.99, most 1dvd sets cost this. If this dvd would have been packed like Flair or Mania21, it would have cost $29.99..If you don't like the discs stacked on top of one another, put them in separate dvd cases(you can buy them 3 for a $1!). Just scan the cover and print it out for each case..NOT THAT HARD TO DO....

Now, on to the content. I for one thought the match selection was great. I didn't have any of these matches and I had not even seen the Hart matches..(TOTALLY AMAZING and worth the $16.99)..

Fact of the the matter is that everyone always wants more. I think we are lucky to get what we are getting! Yeah, it would be nice to get the wcw stuff, but face it, Mean Mark sucked in WCW.....I have some of his WCW matches on VHS and never watch them.

Anyways, I recommend this DVD set to any wrestling fan...",1125014400,4,984,4.251336898395722
2352733,4,B000A2X0LE,"I don't know what to say about this DVD that hasn't been said on other reviews. But, to sum it up, if you're looking for stuff on Mark Callaway's career, check out ""This Is My Yard"", which shows some brief footage of Mark in his WCW, pre-Undertaker days, and is more behind the scenes (& features 4 of the matches also shown in this DVD). This DVD looks at, simply, the Undertaker. No WCW, no at-home stuff. Yes, some of the matches have been shown on other collaboration DVD's, but it is nice to see some of the Undertaker's best all in one spot. Others are very nice to see for the first time on DVD, like his SummerSlam & One Night Only matches against Bret Hart, & his first Heavyweight Title victory. The matches featured are in their entirety (yes...with blurs on some logos for copyright reasons), & with the except of the 'One Night Only' match vs Bret Hart, include the entire entrances.

2352754,5,B000A2X0LE,"This DVD presents itself as a straight-forward presentation of matches, but when I started watching it, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is actually a full fledged documentary on The Undertaker's 15 year WWE career, as well as featuring unedited matches (including entrances!).

However, while the segment before the '91 Hogan match is very detailed, after that the documentary features just sort of skim over what happened in between each match or reuse promo footage, even forgetting to mention certain highlights of UT's career (like the '96 Phantom mask or his Hardcore Championship reign). But at least it does have more than just the matches.

And as for the matches selected, no complaints here. While not every single bout is a classic, they are all essential in that they either show important moments or document eras in The Phenom's career (except that John Cena match, what's that doing there?) The pixalation over the 'WWF' can be an eyesore, but there's nothing that can be done about that.

The extras are, except for a couple of pretty good matches, inadequate. Instead of interviews, which mostly feature the incredibly irratating Paul Bearer, it would have been better to have the promo films for all of the matches instead, kind of like HHH's 'That Damn Good' DVD. Then maybe the documentary could have been a little more focused.

The only thing that's truly disappointing about this set is the lack of involvement from The Undertaker himself. I can only assume the WWE is trying to maintain the integrity of The Undertaker's silent Deadman character; as the real Mark Calaway has seemingly always taken great pride in his career and accomplishment.

As has been mentioned, the DVD case is ridiculous with the single box, stack-the-DVDs-on-each-other set up. And the cover is really dumb looking, it looks like he's walking under the sea.

The crux of the biscuit is that even though this is a rushed and somewhat badly produced tribute, it's still by a mile the greatest Undertaker compilation ever and, as he is one of the WWE's immortals, one of the all time best wrestling DVDs. I greatly enjoyed it.

This DVD has 2 EASTER EGGS and they are accessible through the following means:

Disk 2: Go to chapters, highlight UT/Kane Wrestlemania 14 and click the 'right' directional arrow twice. This will take you to an 'off the air' RAW interview with Paul Bearer where he explains to Jerry Lawler how Kane came to be conceived.

Disk 3: Go to chapters, highlight UT/Kane WM XX and click the 'left' directional arrow twice. This will show you an interview off RAW where Undertaker admits to causing the fire death of his parents.

Wow, this DVD is a wet dream for anyone who loved the Undertaker/Kane soap opera angle. A real shame since there's so many more interesting things in UT's career to highlight.",1124841600,,2834,4.873180873180873

Phenom, American Bad A@@, Deadman

However you know him, the Undertaker's been a four-time WWE Champion, six-time Tag-Team Champion, and a main event level Superstar. Legends,Champions, and even the owner of the WWE, have bowed to his dominance, culminating in the perfect 13-0 record at WrestleMania.

The 3-disc Dvd set provides 21 of Undertaker's best matches wiht additional footage and history of his many opponents...proving what legions of fans already know: The Deadman lives!

2352756,5,B000A2X0LE,"This dvd is great the matches are good except for a few. I only wish that they added 2 more matches Undertaker vs shawn michaels casket match and the boiler room brawl match vs mankind.

VS-Hulk Hogan *** okay match kind of slow.

VS-Yokuzuno ***1/2 Pretty good match except for when every one runs in and interfears.

VS-Diesel *** This match is okay it gets a little boring after a while but what do u expect from diesel?

VS-Mankind buried alive match **** good match a little slow at some points a lot of brawling and big bumps.

VS-Mankind ***1/2 pretty good match a lot of brawling again though.

VS-Brett hart **1/2 okay not as good as the other bret match.

VS-HBK ****1/2 great match huge bumps.

VS-Mankind hell in a cell **** good hell in a cell match its unbelivable how mankind can fall that far down twice and the get chokeslammed on thumbtacks wow!

VS-Kane ** not very good match kind of slow.

VS-Kane inferno match *** they didn't even do any good stunts with the fire basicly a regular match but just with fire around the ring, good dive by undertaker though.

VS-HBK ****1/2 great hell in a cell good brawling and action inside the cell and out, cool to see kane iterfere to.

VS-Brett ***** great match one of the best matches on the dvd

VS-Rock **1/2 okay match could of been much better.

VS-Stone Cold first blood match **** good match

VS-Triple H ***1/2 pretty good match some good brawling and a crazy but fake bump by triple h,Triple h gets chokeslammed of a camera tower at first i was like whoa thats crazy but then when the camera man zooms in u see that he landed on a big mat really fake.

VS-Brock Lesner Hell in a cell ***1/2 good match not to many bumps or cool moves they don't leave the cell at al either.

Vs-Vince buried alive match **1/2 not that good of a buried alive match undertaker dominates the whole match.

VS-john Cena *** pretty good match not to many crazy moves or big bumps just a regular match.

VS-Kane ** bad match the only good thing about this match is that its when undertaker returned.

VS-Kurt Angle ****1/2 great match one of the best on here.

This dvd is also filled with a lot of great extras. This is a great dvd for any undertaker fan. I only wish they had the casket match vs michaels and the boiler room brawl vs foley then it would be a even better dvd.",1124841600,2,2325,4.348027842227379
2352757,4,B000A2X0LE,"The Undertaker has had a long and storied career, mostly good, some, well... not so good performances. If you're an Undertaker fan, you'll love this set regardless. If you're a wrestling fan in general and not necessarily a fan of The Undertaker, then you should pick this set up exclusively for the Bret ""Hitman"" Hart vs. Undertaker match from One Night Only.

Simply put, gimmick matches like the Hell In A Cell aside, this is unquestionably Undertakers best (WRESTLING) match. One Night Only was a UK PPV, and a rare find all together; there were very few copies distributed. The Bret vs. Taker match in particular was especially hard to find... until now. It was deleted from the US release of ONO, because Vince McMahon didn't want this match to be shown, because after the Montreal Screwjob, he didn't want to give Bret any more credibility since he was WCW. (Bret wanted to stay loyal to the company, signing a long term deal for far less money than what he was offered from WCW, but Vince wanted out if it because he couldn't afford it. Anyway... that's a story for another day, back to the review...) He wanted to bury this magnificent match because Bret looked so darn impressive, but thankfully, it's right here on this set.

Tombstone is a solid piece of production from top to bottom, but there are two major flaws that I have a problem with. One, is that The Undertaker isn't interviewed on the DVD to give his input on his matches. Secondly, the packaging is very poor. It looks to me like they knew this DVD would sell big regardless, and they wanted to save money by cramming 3 disks in a cheap standard DVD case.

Oh... and his matches with Hogan are an embarrassment.

Overall, I would give Tombstone: The History of the Undertaker a 4- star rating, but unfortunately, that option is not available, so I'll give it a ****.",1124841600,3,1841,4.603658536585366
2352758,5,B000A2X0LE,"I have most of the matches on this dvd set on various other dvd sets.  I bought this dvd set for basically 2 great matches, that I don't already have, both happen to be extras.  The first is Taker vs Bret (One Night Only).  This match is their best encounter and a rare treat, you won't care about their Summerslam match after seeing this.  The second match is Taker vs Angle from Smackdown Sept 03.  This match in my opinion is even better than the One Night Only match, and maybe Taker's best wrestling match.  Many discredit it because of its finish, and one anklelock that Angle did on UT's wrong leg.  I don't find the ending to be a different category than the One Night Only ending, I don't hold non-finishes against a great match ever, and the wrong-leg anklelock makes sense when you see that Angle was supposed to be groggy after just missing a big boot and quickly grabbed any Taker leg before Taker could pull both legs away from Angle.  Anywho...get this dvd set mainly for these two matches.",1124841600,2,1005,4.453551912568306
2352759,4,B000A2X0LE,"I purchased the Undertaker ""Tombstone- History Of The Undertaker"" dvd yesterday expecting to get 10 hours of a few complete matches and a bunch of career highlights.  I'm not a HUGE Undertaker fan (Shawn Michaels is my favorite), but he is probably the most entertaining and interesting character in WWE history.  When I got the DVD, the first thing I noticed, just like everyone else on here, is the extremely poor packaging of the dvds.  If anyone has seen how Ric Flair's beautifully put together 3 disc (and excellent) set is, then you will definitely be very disappointed by the lack of care for the Undertaker (a big time WWE legend).  They do a good job narrating his history and the matches, though some are not great, are very entertaining and bring back alot of memories.  I bought mine at Best Buy on sale for $16.99 and it was definitely worth the money. 10 hours of entertaining Undertaker. I could tell that this was a hurry up job because on the second disc The old WWF logo is not replaced by the current WWE logo, which could cause some problems and end up having the DVD recalled or so (making this DVD a major collectors item).  The best time of the Undertaker's legendary career was the creepy ""Ministry Of Darkness"" period and they definitely should've shown more of that. Overall, despite its hurry up job of putting it together, its a solid DVD and a good purchase for any wrestling fan.  I'm waiting on a Kurt Angle DVD and hopefully, they deliver and put more time into it than the Undertaker DVD.",1124841600,2,1522,4.573529411764706
2352760,5,B000A2X0LE,"Despite being poorly packaged, this DVD collection of The Undertaker is a must have for Taker fans. Great historical matches like the Bret Hart confrontation at Summerslam bring back delightful memories. All the matches are memorable and are well put together. It lacks a true biography but it makes up for timeline battles against the very best. I had several of these matches taped on VHS but I can trash them now because I have a gem of a collection now. A lot of other great matches were left out, but you can't fit all of his matches unless you put it on 10 DVD's. All in all this is a great collection for all Undertaker fans. Go buy it, now!!!",1124841600,2,650,4.380165289256198
2352761,4,B000A2X0LE,"As an Undertaker fan for almost 15 years, I was anxiously awaiting this DVD set from the moment the match listings were announced on the internet. Compared to the list, there are some surprises...both good and bad.

First off, as some people have mentioned - the packaging is quite lousy. It is a typical snaplock DVD case with the three discs just stacked on top of each other. As well as potentially damaging the discs over time, it also makes the set seem a little cheap. Call me a DVD nerd if you like, but I was hoping for one of the fold-out packs (like WrestleMania, Ric Flair, etc) with the discs all laid out...I guess Taker isn't good enough for the royal treatment?!

One thing that always made me cringe about WWE DVDs were the cheap-ass menu screens. When you compare the menus on wrestling discs to those on movies, they are very inferior - usually just a frozen image with a generic rock theme playing over and over. There is a little more to enjoy with Taker's disc...lightning bolts, moving mist, entrance videos playing on tombstones and even a rare version of his 1998 entrance music plays on Disc 2.

From the the way the disc contents were announced, I thought we were just going to get a run down of 21 great matches...which is good, but nothing too exciting. Well, WWE has actually exceeded expectations here by weaving the full matches (complete with entrances and post match celebrations) into a 10hr long montage that also features the buildups to each match, together with highlights of key matches such as his 1990 Survivor Series debut, title victory with Sid in 1997 and his return at JD 2000. Vintage footage of Gene Okerlund hyping the 'Gravest Challenge' together with classic interviews of Taker and Paul Bearer (old school style with the screen behind them showing Taker's casket logo, with the purple screen, etc) and various promos and clips all brought back some great memories.

'Tombstone' runs the length and breadth of his entire career. Naturally, you can't please everyone - each person has his/her own favorite era...favorite interviews and matches. You can't please them all. What WWE has done is choose the key 21 matches in his career (which I'm sure any true Taker fan will agree are the defining matches in his career) and supplemented them with montage footage of everything else - the black wedding, teaching Big Show, returning to the Dark side...the lot.

The extras are awesome...some classic moments that I havn't seen for a while such as attacking Hogan on the funeral parlor (Hogan, Savage, Flair, Piper and Taker all together in one place? Man!), talking to his parents tombstones, and his awesome promo for Mr McMahon.

In addition, Taker fans will be happy to hear that there are a couple of extra matches thrown in that weren't listed on the net..his awesome match with Kurt Angle from Smackdown, and his One Night Only match against the Hitman. Great stuff.

In conclusion, it's every Taker fans dream...all the best matches in full and a great selection of clips, moments and memories. It's a shame we didn't get a Road Warriors documentary style disc...but nobody ever said this was the final Taker DVD. Also a shame WWE were cheap-ass on the packaging, but oh well.

Grab some snacks and beer, dim the lights (I used the lightswitch, but if you have the ability to raise and lower lights with your hands, then go ahead), sit back and enjoy TEN HOURS of the Dead Man.

[EDIT: There are a couple of Easter Eggs on the disc that I have found...both from 1997. The first is when Taker admits to the fire, but tells his version of events. He is bathed in blue light the whole time and it's pretty cool. The other is the infamous clip from 1998 when Bearer (thinking the cameras were off) confided to Jerry Lawler that he ""nailed"" Taker's mom. Great memories.]",1124841600,4,3820,4.698056801195815

2352763,1,B000A2X0LE,"Ive watched wrestling since 1992, and always liked the Undertaker. The packaging is horrible, considering its just 3 dvds stacked on one anther. Is this the new trend? Dont they think the dvds will get scratched easily? Is this what the Undertaker gets for all his years in the WWE? A cheap, 3 disc set of matches that we've seen over and over again? I thought they'd have a nice documentary on his career, but they skimp on that and just have a new guy narrate the matches. They skip his feud with Warrior, would have loved to see a match on that instead of Hogan, and about three years of his career just vanish and they have major gaps in between years of feuds he has had. I don't know who put this out, but they did a poor job. I cant understand why they didn't make a nice biography like on Life and Death of ECW, and then unseen gems like fighting The Warrior, Papa Shango, Crush, Bam Bam Bigelow. Yea those wrestlers might have sucked, but the Undertaker always brought out the best in who he faced.
