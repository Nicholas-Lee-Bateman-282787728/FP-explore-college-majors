ABC Tuesday at 10/9 central

 Detroit 1-8-7 is a show I picked up this year in its debut season.  Starring Michael Imperioli (The Sopranos) as Detective Louis Fitch who works in Detroit's leading homicide unit.  The Homicide unit is lead by Lt Maureen Mason with six detectives in her command, each episode features 2 cases.
 The most recent episode, episode 12 ""Key to the City"" is one of the finest pieces of television that there is.  It is a very compelling and fast paced episode from beginning to end.  If you have never watched this show, and even if you are not a fan of police procedural drama's this episode will make you love this show.
 You can watch this complete episode by clicking the link below at ABC or HULU

4195393,5,B003UD7J3K,"Detroit 1-8-7 - Season One [Television crime drama - 0641 - 09-18-2015 - DVD]
Note: This television series had only 1 season.

Summary:
  ""Detroit 1-8-7"" is a police procedural TV series that features three teams of detectives assigned to solve murders. Each episode features two crimes to be resolved usually involving all three teams some alone and some teams collaborating. The city of Detroit with all it's past splendor and current urban decay is highlighted in each episode and is a significant contributor to this shows success.
  According to Wikipedia The 1-8-7 of the title is a specific reference to the California Penal Code designation for homicide, which has become a slang term for murder.

Content & Packaging:
4 disks - 18 episodes - first broadcast on ABC September 21, 2010 to March 20, 2011. The season 1 set comes in a solid, standard, snap case - no booklet with cast photos and episode summaries are included - and no extras or interviews - disappointing. Note there was no season 2 of this show.

Positive Comments:
 The six detectives and their superior play noteworthy roles in each show. The fact is they are all excellent actors and each brings a distinctive perspective to solving murders in a city shrouded with hopelessness and urban decay.
 The creative talent behind the cameras and the writers have make the city of Detroit with all its warts an important center of attention of this show - I would say an indispensable focus.
 The back-story and interactions of the detectives are engaging and believable - contributing to the likeability of the series.

The Cast:
 As mentioned the cast is uniformly excellent. I will single out two actors for special mention: Michael Imperioli as Det. Louis Fitch and Jon Michael Hill as Det. Damon Washington. The caustic and joking interactions between these two detectives are real hidden treasures on the shows.

Negative Comments:
 A real big thumbs down to the suits that pulled this series after one short season of 18 episodes.
 There were no deleted scenes of extras on the released DVD set.

Recommendations:
This is an extraordinary police drama that kept my interest during each episode - a uncommon occurrence for this viewer. If the material interests I highly recommend it.",1442707200,,2259,4.952254641909814

4195427,5,B003UD7J3K,"Detroit 1-8-7 is probably the best cop show never to have made it past one year. With an all-star cast headed by Michael Imperioli (The Sopranos) and supported by noteworthy actors like James McDaniel (NYPD Blue), Natalie Martinez (Under the Dome) and Jon Michael Hill (Elementary), in addition to rave reviews from USA Today, it's hard to understand why the series didn't take off.

In this little-known gem of a series, Imperioli plays an intelligent, introverted detective.  He is so aware and focused, he's able to get under the skin of murder suspects during interrogations, yet he is so socially withdrawn, he sometimes communicates with his frustrated rookie partner (Hill) by cell phone even while in the same room.  McDaniel plays an old-timer planning for his retirement in Italy. Martinez plays a sharp, yet feminine detective who shows that she has the grit and intelligence to work alongside her male cohorts.

In addition to superior acting, the writing is excellent.  Each episode highlights a different aspect of Detroit, its people and its suburbs. This drama could easily have exploited all that's wrong with the city, but it focuses more on what's right with it.  We see scenes of The Eastern Market, Greek Town, and Belle Isle.  We meet characters who are passionate about Detroit as well as murderers and thieves.

Perhaps the time slot wasn't right, but more likely the series was cancelled because Michigan's new governor drastically cut back a program which offered some of the most generous film tax credits in the nation. When that happened, many movies and television dramas packed up and left.  More's the pity because Detroiters and the people of Michigan could have used that small spark of Hollywood glitter to enrich their lives.",1408838400,,1761,5.044827586206897

4195445,5,B003UD7J3K,"I remember watching a few episodes of this show when ABC was bouncing it around, but I never followed it because I couldn't get their schedule correct.  Because I liked what I saw, when I noticed the DVD I bought it, quite on a lark actually.  I am so glad I did.
Three episodes in, I realized this show was too good for television.  I also must say that unlike most other reviewers, I'm quite glad it only lasted 18 episodes, because any more than that would have jeapordized the story line, the chemistry, the whole feel of the series.
I have been a fan of television ""cop"" dramas forever.  I must say this is probably the best I've even seen.
There is no question that Michael Imperioli and James McDaniel are the ""stars"" of this series, but the entire ensemble cast is just brilliant.  This is a well written, well acted, technically proficient and endlessly fascinating series.  In my opinion, the character development and the show peaks at episode 16.  But don't ruin it by starting with that one!
If you decide to buy this, I humbly suggest that you wait until you can schedule the time and watch the entire series, beginning to end, over a one week period.  That's what I did, and you will find that it truly plays like a motion picture.  Really, it does. And I must say it was wrapped up brilliantly.  I'm not sure when the producers found out during the season that the show would not be renewed, but the last episode is a wonderful, bow wrapped conclusion to a gritty, exciting, well done police drama.  My compliments to all of the actors, and the writers, and producers, and directors who put this together.

The acting was well above average for a network TV series, the character development was exceptional and the plots of each episode were engaging and entertaining.  I was disappointed that ABC didn't pick it up for a second season, while keeping garbage like Cougartown, however the fact that they have labeled this DVD set ""The Complete First Season"" instead of the ""The Complete Series"" gives me some hope that it has been picked up for a second season, either on ABC or another network for the spring season.",1317081600,,566,4.65

Fitch was an outstanding character played brilliantly by Imperioli and I was just left wanting MORE, which is not common in any of the news shows anymore.  As someone else mentioned, even ""The Good Wife"" was up for chopping when everyone I know loves this show, not to mention the Emmys its won.  C'mon network television.

4195503,4,B003UD7J3K,"I have always enjoyed the performances of Michael Imperioli. I was, therefore, very pleased to place an order for ""Detroit 1-8-7"". The DVD arrived and I have started to watch it (only 2 episodes so far). Imperioli, as always, proves himself to be a consummate actor. My enjoyment of the show, however, has been marred by some priggish censorship. Not only has, what I imagine to be, some fairly earthy language been ""bleeped-out"" but also, it would appear, in an effort to not offend the undoubtedly numerous lip readers among the viewing public, the lips of those delivering the earthy language have been pixelated. What arrant nonsense!

Censorship of TV series in the USA was featured in a ""Special Features"" section of one of the ""Californication"" series. The script-writers explained the hoops which had to be jumped through to sanitize the earthy language of that series to spare the acute sensibilities of non-cable viewers.

Given that D187 was aired on ABC & not cable then, I daresay, the overweening protocols governing what can or cannot be heard issuing from the box had to be honored. However, surely, when the series was made available on DVD there was no compulsion to be bound by those strictures.

Unfortunately, this censorship mars what is shaping-up to be a great series.",1316736000,,1292,4.944700460829493

4195506,5,B003UD7J3K,"In Detroit we have been accustomed to being a national joke, a version of ""kick the can"" where the city is viewed as a pathetic spot on the Detroit River mired in despair, scandal, and a freakishly-high homicide rate. We were worried that this show on ABC would kick us again. But instead, based on the strength of 18 episodes now pulled together on the DVD, it is evident that the writers, producers, directors, actors, and crew were less interested in knocking Detroit and more interested in beautifully illustrating the complex, multi-layered American urban landscape that many of us actually love. The stories were personal and true (the episode on the 1967 Detroit riots a case in point) and fictionalized to keep us watching a human drama from the first opening moments to the closing seconds (usually heightened by a choice of local music that became one of the best TV series soundtracks in recent years). The cast of actors was remarkable in that it was a true-to-form mix of ethnicities and genders. Though the talent level was uneven, the lead actors -- Michael Imperioli and James McDaniel -- were thoroughbreds in that stable. The thing is, ABC botched the way this show should have been promoted. They jerked it around from week to week, cut their losses early, and left the fans hanging. Okay. It's a business. But here's where it left us, the fans: Wanting more. The writing & acting were so good, particularly with these 2 characters, that viewers still ask, ""What's next for Fitch and Longford? Is Fitch really interested in Arianna? Will Longford's experience end up being a problem for him as technology and the younger detectives try to leave him in the dust? Will these 2 ever connect as lead horses or will they find themselves fighting over something we can only imagine? And who comes into their lives that will shake it all up?"" I wonder how characters this rich & interesting could suddenly disappear. But they have, and we are left only with our imaginations as to what would have come next. That, and a DVD collection of the first & only season. So thanks Detroit 1-8-7 for showing our town a little R-E-S-P-E-C-T. It mattered. It really did.",1314748800,13,2171,4.7612732095490715

4195510,5,B003UD7J3K,"""Detroit 1-8-7"" was the best crime drama to come along in a good while on TV. Set and filmed on location in Detroit, the show follows the working and personal lives of a squad of homicide detectives. The characters are interesting and realistic, not the typical gun-brandishing overblown egos we see on many other cop shows. Michael Imperioli shines in the lead role as Detective Louis Fitch, a wily and ""fascinatingly odd man"" who is well-respected by his peers and who has the highest case closure rate in his division. The show carries itself on engaging story lines that focus on more than just solving homicide cases, without resorting to unrealistic stunts, car chases, flashy hot rods, bikini-clad women or high-tech gadgets.  The show is really more about the characters, their lives as law enforcement officers, and the difficult choices their job often forces them to make. As Season One unfolds, their personal stories become quite compelling. If you want to see a cop show that finally comes close to showing us what a real-life detective's life might be like, this is the one to watch. Too bad ABC executives didn't have the good judgment to keep it around longer. We only got 18 episodes for Season One. If another channel picks up ""Detroit 1-8-7"" with its excellent cast, I will surely continue to support this well-written, well-acted show.",1307491200,11,1356,4.921397379912664

This was a pretty good show in the beginning and by the time it ended it was great.  Great writing, great acting, great look, great use of music.

It's over now.  I will miss it and I doubt that ABC will come up with anything better.  If this ever becomes available on DVD buy it, I will.  If it ever shows up on a cable channel support it and watch it. You will not be sorry.  It deserves another shot although I doubt it will get one.",1305849600,18,671,4.03030303030303

The stark backdrop of the skeleton of the once-great buildings of Detriot shocked me at first but afterall the city is but a shell of its former self.  The acting is solid and the characters are interesting.

ABCs ""Detroit 1-8-7"" is new to our primetime schedule here in Australia - currently being aired on Seven/Prime, and the pilot episode was enough to get me hooked.  With David Zabel, of ""ER"" fame involved in its production, I am not surprised by its exceptional creative visual and sound quality.  The show's documentary style of filmmaking and soundtrack captures the perfect tone of Detroit - similar to how ""Law & Order"" and ""NYPD Blue"" captured the tone of New York City; ""Homicide: Life On The Street"" captured the tone of Baltimore; and ""SouthLAnd"" captured the tone of south-central Los Angeles, ""Detroit 1-8-7"" is another new show in the line, including CBSs ""Blue Bloods"" and NBCs ""Harry's Law"" giving me such great viewing pleasure.

The ratings are so low, I don't see how it can survive to season #2. It was also up against Southland. Another excellent police show. I will miss this show if it doesn't make it.
