8110862,5,B000ELJB82,Love all the super speeders dvds. Matt and Rob are great. I know it takes alot to put these videos together.,1398211200,,108,4.190476190476191
8110863,5,B000ELJB82,"While this may be a ""self promotion"" Ferretti and his crew live the kind of life that most of us can only dream about. Until my monthly automotive budget allows me to buy more then just a tire for one of these cars I will continue to watch these movies with a smile.",1340323200,,266,4.037735849056604
8110864,2,B000ELJB82,"This was mostly self promotion at the viewers expense (both in time and payment). I was expecting to see a showcase of drivers and their machines. I thought there would be plenty of exotics, e.g. the Ferrari line up - 348s, the famous 355s, 360s on up as well as Lams and Maseratis and whatever else. But no this is mostly about the Ferretti Productions owner and ""his"" Lamborghini. Of course, there is a sprinkling of everyone else's vehicle here and there but not enough to make it other than self promotion.",1339113600,,510,4.554347826086956
