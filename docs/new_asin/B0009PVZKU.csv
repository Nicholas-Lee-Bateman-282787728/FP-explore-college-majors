2311234,3,B0009PVZKU,"This disc came with the BBC Dickens set. It is probably the weakest entry. Alan Bates is good as always, but some of the other actors are rather weak. But they don't have much of a script to work with, as the adaptation is poor. It is difficult to make Dickens work with such a short length; the characters and situations never seem to get fleshed out. The production values were poor as well. It makes you realize how much money and effort has gone into other Dickens adaptations.

This story is prime for a remake -- much more than the version of Bleak House that came in the same set (which was quite good).",1139443200,30,610,4.304347826086956

2311263,3,B0009PVZKU,"This is a 1994 BBC adaptation of a Charles Dickens novel Hard Times. While the films story (which I will not summarize here because I think you already know it) is faithful to that of the original book, the entire film has only about 100 minutes. This means that everything goes on too quickly, to the point of being incoherent. Old Stephen/Rachel story arc suffers most terribly, being badly truncated.

Set in a fictitious city called Coketown, the story of Hard Times follows the life of the Gradgrinds and other characters living in this drab industrial town. Unfortunately, being a low-budget made-for-TV mini-series, Hard Times does not show us this dreary and monotonous Coketown very much, which is one of the original novels important features.

So this adaptation of Hard Times goes a little bit like a stage production, with characters talking to each other in a dimly lit, confined space. With stars like Alan Bates (as Bounderby), Bob Peck (as Gradgrind) and Richard E. Grant (as Harthouse), acting is perfect. Unfortunately, writing leaves much to be desired. Where was Andrew Davies when we needed him?

Hard Times is not exactly the most popular one among the Dickens works. This adaptation is not likely to change that.",1400112000,3,1236,4.961352657004831

2311268,4,B0009PVZKU,"Charles Dickens was almost always ""on the money"" for me, in his writings, and this is no exception. A glimpse into the lifestyles, trials and tribulations, of his times. I felt this was more than adequate in terms of acting and costumes. I would say that sets at times left something to be desired, which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. If you like other Dickens period pieces, you will most likely like this as well.",1323734400,2,424,4.3125
2311269,5,B0009PVZKU,"I bought this to use in my classroom. My students read the book, then, after a reasonably good discussion, watched the dramatization and this in its turn generates a great deal of discussion. Once I get them past the cheesie cinematography they really tune in to this video and gain greatly from the display. Good stuff here.",1318118400,2,325,4.719298245614035
2311270,5,B0009PVZKU,"This adaptation of the novel was done by the BBC for schools. What you get is essentially something like a filmed version of a stage play. The cast is excellent. The production made incredibly creative use of a very mimimal budget. But if your expecting a first-class production with a huge budget, look elsewhere.

Given the length of the work, the writers had to be very creative as far as how to fit the story together. The work has an almost dreamlike quality to it. Traditionalists will hate it but on every watching after the first I came to appreciate more what the people behind the production were trying to do.

There are low budget productions were people don't try. And then there are low budget productions where those involved go all out and surpass what they should have been able to deliver. This is definately in the second catagory.

Its not for everyone, but some will appreciate it.",1194652800,22,902,4.660377358490566
8065073,5,B0009PVZKU,"Prime has two versions of ""Hard Times."" Both stick to the same storyline right down to some of the script. I found this one a bit less brutal and dark as the series. All in all Dickens' stories are usually in this Victorian era and dark, about drudgery, death, and the lives of poor--struggling to survive. He created some pretty despicable characters in this one. Harsh of character, cold and without feeling, yet there's always one or two who are kind and victims.",1526774400,,466,4.626506024096385

Bill Paterson is fine as Stephen Blackpool, but Alan Bates nearly consumes the fine Victorian furniture as Josiah Bounderby.
