8639230,5,B00I4DCCC4,"I wanted to see this film for a number reasons-I am a fan of Sir Patrick Stewart, I like foreign cinema and the story seemed highly original. I therefore watched it with a keen interest  as this was going to be something I would savour. I thought it a must see and hopefully it will get the audience it so richly deserves. There is a whole range of emotions and the cast although never stretched bring a freshness to the film and although most audiences will watch because of Patrick Stewart the others  in the cast also deserve credit.
I will watch this film again as I want to see again the building up of a good film that deserves to be out there. Finally, do not be put off by the subtitles as they do not take anything away.

The plot is an interesting one and it is one to see rather than describe my advice is watch the film.",1446422400,,832,4.15527950310559
