5054873,5,B0074JOCTU,"I'm not a big western fan by any means, but after watching Goodnight for Justic- the Measure of A Man staring Luke Perry best known from the original 90210 and Cameron Bright best known for Alec from the Twlight Saga. I would have to say it was really good and heart warming and I think and I think both fans of Perry and Bright would love this for there collection and for other who just want something good to view this film would be it.",1353024000,,439,4.176470588235294
5054874,4,B0074JOCTU,good movie alittle slowbut a good movie sit down and relaxto my son watche it with me. must watch the second one,1344297600,,112,4.136363636363637
5054875,4,B0074JOCTU,"In a long interview, Luke Perry (the creator and executive producer of the ""Goodnight"" films) says he doesn't want to make Westerns that overwhelm the viewer with action. He's more interested in drama, and (particularly) where he can take the character. (We see at the beginning that Goodnight still drinks to excess, but nothing much is made of this in the rest of the film.)

""The Measure of a Man"" is arguably better than the first film, as it focuses on one story, and does so efficiently and without unneeded padding. It is similarly low-key and reserved, and likewise has a Really Nasty villain. Not surprisingly, Goodnight tosses his guns aside and defeats the villain in a fistfight, rather than gunning him down.

I cannot praise the cinematography enough. ""The Measure of a Man"" is one of the best-photographed color films I have ever seen, including any theatrical film. It's gorgeous, and perhaps worth seeing for that reason alone. The photography justifies a Blu-ray transfer, though I doubt we'll ever see one.

If Mr Perry wants to keep making these films, I'm game to keep watching them. They're not ""high art"", but they're a not-stupid way to while away 88 minutes.",1340409600,5,1183,4.875621890547263
5054876,4,B0074JOCTU,"John Goodnight (Luke Perry) is a traveling circuit judge. We get the idea he is a womanizer who likes his drink, but as a Hallmark film, it doesn't dwell on the topic. He runs an unusual court and doesn't like it when people have legal representation. He tries the cases himself. He runs into an old girlfriend Callie(Baroness Stephanie von Pfetten), who was a stage actress he knew in Chicago.

When the bad guys come to town to rob the bank, a man is killed. One of the bank robbers is captured...who happens to be Will, the son of Callie. The town wants to hang Will (Cameron Bright, Alec-Twilight saga). John, in spite of his past relationship to Callie does not recluse himself, but finds a way to save the boy and his mother from an angry vigilante mob who demands a hanging.

The film is hokey and cheesy as any Hallmark. People can't seem to shoot and hit anything, even at close range. Many movie cliches. I will say in spite of all the shortcomings it somewhat held my interest. Film appears to be aimed at one parent youngster who stray due to the lack of the proper role model.

Parental Guide: Some shooting deaths and a fist fight. Talk about out of wedlock pregnancy and doing the right thing.",1340150400,,1208,4.457013574660634
5054877,5,B0074JOCTU,"The Goodnight For Justice movies are excellent in that they do portray a more close account of the way things were in the old west.  Luke Perry is an excellent actor and the supporting actors do a great job.  If you lovve the old west and western movies, this is a must have.",1339372800,,275,4.169811320754717
5054878,5,B0074JOCTU,"I like this and the prequel... they are sincere, entertaining, period correct, and just all around good quality.  This is a must see for every western fan... good love story too, for the ladys.",1338336000,,193,4.676470588235294
5054879,5,B0074JOCTU,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT HALLMARK WESTERN, THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CONTENT WHEN LETTING YOUR CHILDREN WATCH. THERE IS GOOD ACTION AND AN REALLY GOOD STORY LINE.",1337212800,2,167,4.793103448275862
5054880,3,B0074JOCTU,"""The difference is justice, you'll know it when you feel it squeezing around your neck."" Judge John Goodnight (Perry) rides into a town to dispense his own brand of justice. When the town is attacked Goodnight captures a young bandit who turns out to be the the son of a local woman. When Goodnight uses the boy to find the head of the gang more secrets are revealed. After watching the first movie and actually thinking it wasn't that cheesy I went in expecting the same from this one. I was wrong. I realize that this one was also on the Hallmark Channel and I should have expected it but this was way cheesier then the first movie. The main plot and reveal actually made me hang my head and shake it at the ridiculousness of it. I will say though that when compared to the newer westerns that have come out this is still better then most. Which is kinda sad. Overall, not as good as first one but watchable. I give it a C+.",1331164800,4,926,4.267045454545454

It's interesting how justice found it's way to the wild west to settle grievances of so many different and usually petty complaints.  Luke Perry is so good with all the ways he deals with people who bring their cases into his courtroom.",1424304000,,321,4.517241379310345
