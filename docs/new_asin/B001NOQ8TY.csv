3719893,4,B001NOQ8TY,"This documentary did a fantastic job of covering the history of 20th Century commercial illustration, and how influential Frank Frazetta has been to a generation of artists, authors, and sci-fi/fantasy fans alike.  Tons of interviews with the subject, his family, friends, and contemporaries reveal a pretty vivid picture of the man, his art, and how the widespread reach that it has had.

The one negative takeaway I had upon finishing was that there just wasn't enough focus on how Frazetta conjures up his beautiful, striking imagery.  There are a handful of quotes and accounts from him and his family about what it would be like in the Frazetta household when a piece was being completed (interesting stories there, for sure) but I felt like the documentary would have been that much better had they been able to tease out just a little bit more of the imagination behind those ridiculously skilled hands.

Still, all in all a very solid documentary that any fan of fantasy art and illustration should not miss.",1343260800,5,1016,4.923976608187134
3719894,5,B001NOQ8TY,"There's little else I can add to the already many 5-star comments here. It is a great, and at times nostalgic look at the life and times of this great artist. Enjoyed it from start to finish.

Only a few criticisms (things that could be easily fixed in a future edition, I hope): (1) The video quality might've been better, especially in this age of HD screens; (2) a single, over-arching narrator to tie everything in would've been a nice touch; and (3) Frazetta's biographer should've delivered his lines more organically instead of sounding so dramatically over the top... but none is a deal breaker to me. The good overweighs the bad by a lot. It is a vignette: a work of love by fans, artists, friends, and family, pure and simple, not an aseptic History channel ""documentary,"" and as such it works very well.",1333065600,,814,4.613793103448276
3719895,2,B001NOQ8TY,Interesting profile of the artist and his life.  This is NOT an instructional video.  If you are interested in this great fantasy artist it may be for you.,1332028800,,155,4.5

3719897,4,B001NOQ8TY,"It may not be the most artfully made doc, especially in an age where we've come to expect 'cinematic values' from a documentary, but as a Frazetta fan, I found it very satisfying. It tells the story of an artist's life and seemed very comprehensive.",1459209600,,249,4.555555555555555

3719899,1,B001NOQ8TY,Thought it was a movie and wasted $2.99 plus tax to listen to a lot of bragging and kudos.  Should have read the description completely so that I wouldn't have spent my hard earned dollars listening to braggadocio along with pictures of over muscled men and naked ladies.  Would have been a first class rip off except that sifting through all the gobble goop would have saved me money that a poor old pensioner can't afford.  Wish Amazon had listed it as an BIO so those of us who aren't too smart wouldn't waste our time watching the first few minutes before discovering our error and turning away in disgust.,1448150400,,610,4.527272727272727

3719902,5,B001NOQ8TY,"OUTSTANDING documentary on the life and work of an American original. There will NEVER be another Frank Frazetta. For hardcore fans, and ESPECIALLY for someone semi-familiar that would like some insight into what kind of LIFE shapes this kind of MAN to so express this kind of IMAGINATION?

3719904,3,B001NOQ8TY,"Disappointing, had hoped you'd get to talk technique, see some stuff being done.  Don't know if this thing was put together with clips and posthumously or what, but lacked in that respect.

Frazetta however was a master of his craft and though slow at points, the historical points that are explained (work conditions, how he got his job, who he worked with, that sort of thing) was still interesting.",1415923200,,401,4.797101449275362

3719906,3,B001NOQ8TY,"This was pretty cool.  I didn't know much about Mr. Frazetta and it was cool to learn about him.  He is so influential in modern art that, as an aspiring artist, I felt obligated to watch this documentary.  I am glad that I watched it, but I probably should have rented it instead of buying it.  I thought that it may give some insight into how he made his artwork, but it basically says he was a genius and the work just appeared out of thin air, but there is more to it than that.  He was a pro, but he had training and a process that he used to make the masterpieces shown in this film.  I wish they covered that information more.  However, there is a lot of his work displayed in here and I am glad to have it as a resource.",1410825600,,728,3.9793103448275864

3719909,5,B001NOQ8TY,"There is an old argument... Frazetta or Boris?

Boris Vallejo is a painter of soulless ""kitsch"". His work is on a par with Thomas Kincaid. Frazetta's peer might be Norman Rockwell or Andrew Wyeth. Frazetta paints an entire dark universe, inhabited by mythic demons and heroes, Vallejo paints models with airbrushed tans and photoshopped torsos. The only reason these comparisons exist is Vallejo copped Frazetta's style and has been living off it for 45 years.

This documentary features interviews with many illustrators, artists, authors and film makers who explain why Frazetta was great and describes his enormous influence over the genre of fantasy paperbacks and comics.

If the intent of commercial art is to communicate an idea, and the intent of the fine artist is to express oneself, then Frank managed to straddle both worlds with ease. Elements of color, line, design, atmosphere, draftsmanship, and a unique dynamic power and feeling of place and person so permeates Frazetta's work that very few other painters or artists come close.

The snobbery and elitism of New York art critics (read ""The Painted Word"" by Tom Wolfe), has the world convinced that Abstract Expressionism and other 20th ""fine art"" are ""important"", and ""illustrators"" like Frazetta's create disposable, lowbrow, work that is lesser than than the great masters and 20th century artists like Kline, De Kooning, Pollock, Motherwell, Picasso. I could not disagree more. The achievement of Frazetta, Rockwell and Wyeth is every bit as great as those hanging in MOMA, the Guggenheim, or the Metropolitan Museum of Art (although Wyeth probably is in MMA but you take my point).

Frazetta's greatness is fully explained in this film and I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in art.",1398643200,8,1772,5.160278745644599

3719911,5,B001NOQ8TY,"If you're a fan of Frazetta, at all, this is a must see.  Very few artists have had a more profound impact on American culture and entertainment as Frazetta... Spielberg, Lucas, Bashki, all deeply admire the man.  What most don't realize is how gifted he was and how it manifested at such a young age.  He began working professionally with other comic legends by the time he was 16.  He had perfected his artistic skills and reached the point that he could illustrate anything he imaged as he truly saw it.  His focus was always on composition, design, and the expression of emotion.  The most valued works were created in a single night...  And like most artists, he struggled against greed, corporate stupidity, and his own personal challenges.  What you could learn from is where he found his strength.",1385942400,2,805,4.741007194244604

3719914,5,B001NOQ8TY,".... that came before and the Ages that have yet to pass.

This is a very well designed and executed documentary about a man that defined ""Legend"" itself. The person in question, is Frank Frazetta, the artist... the man.

Throughout the length of this film, it is evident that this will not be your regular biographical portrait, but rather an attempt to shine light into the multifaceted world and psyche of Frank Frazetta. Unknown personal struggles & triumphs in his personal life and art, but also a well constructed body of information which expand over 2-DVD Disks.

All of this come in a metal case with a holographic cover and other than the film itself, this edition provides some behind the scenes filming, commentaries, art galleries, sketches, interviews and best of all... a chance to see Frank draw a panther! ( The way he does this is also admirable and exciting to watch )

The galleries, while rich in content, are very hard to appreciate on TV, as you might imagine. Since this is a 2004 production, there is also a lack of quality in the presentation and picture fidelity is not the best, but the main thing here is Frank and his art. The portrayal is accurate & very informative and although he is not with us anymore, you get the feeling that Frank's legacy and personality, has brought you one step closer to him.

As a creative person myself, it is my belief that there are no true ""geniuses"" in Art. Everything comes with hard work and dedication. Talent may help, but it is not a prerequisite or the definition of success.... And yet, there is an artist, that re-defined the fantasy genre and a whole generation of other artists, using only his imagination. And made it all look so effortless.

I will not spoil the story any further. I will just say that this, is a worthy addition to any DVD collection and every Frazetta fan.

Thank you Frank, you will be missed.",1359676800,,1891,4.6101190476190474

UN arguably the GREATEST artist of ALL time-
