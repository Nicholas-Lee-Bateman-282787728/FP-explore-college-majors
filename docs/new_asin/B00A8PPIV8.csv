5400669,5,B00A8PPIV8,"Too often Mickey Rooney is remembered as a comic, the cut-up guaranteed to evoke plenty of laughs from the audience. And too often Kevin McCarthy is only remembered for his manic performance as the one who knows too much in Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
But both actors' dramatic talents are on display in this tale of a foursome out for riches and love the easiest way possible.",1396310400,4,381,4.617647058823529

8548388,4,B00A8PPIV8,"1st off, I don't often give 5 stars. I remember seeing this movie as a boy in the 50's on our black & white tv.  maybe 60 years have gone by but I remembered how this lonely mechanic was duped into souping up an old car and driving like the wind as a getaway man. After watching this gem (ok a bit sappy but hey it was 1952) I can see where I picked up early ideas about cars, girls, racing, sandy beaches etc. as well as a love for the Mick. Wow people sure did smoke a lot back then. The actress in the lead role is a livin' doll but by today's standards you can see the effects of too much smoking and not enough exercise on her little body.",1473206400,,644,3.878787878787879
8548389,5,B00A8PPIV8,"Modest budgeted film from Columbia with a fine, subdued performance from Mickey Rooney.  Kevin McCarthy is most effective as an opportunistic
thief, Jack Kelly a sinister and wise-cracking cohort in crime and Diane Foster a capable Rita Hayworth ""look-a-like"" who seduces Rooney into participatinmg in a bank robbery.  Excellent musical soundtrack, film nopir night scenes and a taut script from lenegd Blake Edwards.  The film
works very, very well.  A minor gem that should not be overlooked.",1425772800,2,494,5.376623376623376
8548390,4,B00A8PPIV8,"I know that the mere mention of Mickey Rooney's name is cringe-worthy in some circles and undeservedly so.  This is probably true in 1954 because in most of the publicity for this film read boldy: 'A NEW- AND GREAT - MICKEY ROONEY'.  Mr. Rooney gives here a solid, low-key and moody performance as Eddie: a lonely and timid mechanic who falls under the spell of the could-be-femme-fatale, Dianne Foster.  I say could-be, because unlike other fabulous double-dealing women of Film Noir, Ms. Foster is oddly sympathetic and sad herself.  Kevin McCarthy gives a fun performance, too as the baddie.  But a lot of the credit here goes to Blake Edwards script, which hits the right tone of suspense much like his other work in 'Experiment in Terror'.  This is Film Noir film that is the real deal.",1421107200,,791,4.737226277372263

8548392,5,B00A8PPIV8,A different part for Mickey Rooney AND  he played it well.  A picture full of heart which showed real  standards we all can use more of instead of blood and most 4 letter words + too much nudiety.  It was WONDERFUL,1412294400,,214,4.146341463414634
8548393,4,B00A8PPIV8,"This is a really neat little film. First, one has to accept the world of crime noir is often created on a small budget with actors who never made the name above the title, or actors on the way down, no longer big attractions. Lots of location shooting to save on sets and set-ups, and minimal effects-- with lots of rear projection rather than impressive stunts.
  Mickey Rooney plays an auto mechanic, living in a rooming house (even the dog isn't his) who is invisible to women--until the femme fatale (Dianne Foster) comes into his life. Mickey underplays his role, and is quite touching in slowly coming to believe a beautiful woman could care for him--as she is slowly manipulating him into a plan to rob a bank, as he is needed to modify a sedan in order to make the getaway down a dangerous road. Kevin McCarthy (before the Body Snatchers) is the ruthless gang leader, who will not allow Foster's slow change of heart.
  Accept all this and you have a film that is sensitive and smart, if not always delivering the big thrills like the Hollywood A-teams did. And you get to see the real cars, clothes and the Malibu of the 1950's too, in a nice-looking print.

Well worth a look...and maybe a teardrop.",1409702400,4,1209,4.527522935779817
