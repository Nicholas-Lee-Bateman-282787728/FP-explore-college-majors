7786521,4,B01HH20HH4,"When it's time for the latest Thomas & Friends fall season DVD, that means another occasion to look forward to with the grandkids over a shared bowl of popcorn during a group sleepover in our home!  Most of them are @ an hour long (including this one), which seems to be the perfect length for both our grandsons' attention span AND our adult endurance level ;-)... I'll list the fall DVDs at the end of the review in case you're interested.  Occasionally, they've contained some scary scenes (especially for the intended age bracket... I recall our oldest grandson being very frightened of any scenes with Diesel 10 - he would NOT play with his train model of him, and - in fact - kept him up on a shelf in a state of ""permanent time out""!)  But what you've always been able to rely on are solid lessons in friendship, loyalty, teamwork, ""sticking up for your buddies""... when something goes awry, there's always a moral to the story.

Just one thing that's always nagged at the back of my mind... the casts had always been predominantly white and male, while we've been trying to present a more diverse depiction of the world to their young and impressionable minds. That's why we were especially anticipating ""The Great Race"", introducing a dozen brand new friends for Thomas from different countries, along with a neat old character originating in the Railway Series (""Enterprising Engines""), The Flying Scotsman (who's Gordon's brother and a cousin to Spencer), all centered around the Great Railway Show, where engines compete in categories of speed, strength, skill (shunting) and elaborate decoration!  (How appropriate for this movie to come out during an Olympics year, huh?)  With our first granddaughter arriving near Halloween - whom we're sure will equally enjoy the vast number of train characters in our toy collection! - another plus we see in this movie is a few more strong female characters in Ashima (from southern India), Gina (from Italy), and Frieda (from Germany)  This is the first Thomas & Friends musical special to be produced, including seven catchy songs.

Giving you a general feel for the movie, the Sodor engines compete with each other for the chance to represent Sodor in the race - Thomas comes up with all sorts of ideas of how to change himself to earn a spot, with Ashima being central to showing Thomas the importance of just being yourself, and Thomas learning about the possibility of being able to do anything if you're willing to put your mind to it when he's sent to fetch a part ""Shooting Star"" Gordon needs for safety issues.  Diesel (of course!) is up to his usual devious tricks, and (**SPOILER ALERT**... won't tell you the winners of the events, but providing info for parents/grandparents who might be giving the DVD for Christmas and wondering which toys you might want on your shopping list!), we get to see the Shooting Star along with Spencer and the Flying Scotsman from the Mainland competing against Axel of Belgium and Etienne of France in ""The Great Race"" speed event, Henry and Hiro competing against Frieda, Shane of Australia and Vinnie of North America in the strength competition, Thomas (originally supposed to be Percy) competing against Ashima, Gina, Raul of Brazil, and Ivan of Russia in the shunting event, while Emily and James go up against Yong Bao of China, Rajiv of east India, and Carlos of Mexico in the ""Decorated"" event.  New character Philip from Sodor acts as Sodor's mascot and flag carrier, and we'll see all of the other familiar Sodor faces as well.

Very happy the movie didn't stick with tired old stereotypes for the international characters, which is certainly not what we're looking to teach our grandkids!  We'd pre-ordered our copy elsewhere at a lower price (though I see they've come down now, but you might want to shop around to make sure you're getting the best current price), and were happy it arrived in time for our next planned sleepover.  As I probably should've expected, our oldest grandson (8-1/2 now) took off with his grandpa about 10 minutes into the movie in favor of shooting hoops since he's pretty much grown out of his Thomas phase, but our 4-1/2 year old was completely entranced (by the way, that's a 4-1/2 year old who usually can't sit still for more than 5 minutes!), while our 2 year old enjoyed dancing around to the music - personally, have to say I enjoyed it more than the last couple of fall DVDs.  So the verdict's in from the two grandsons who are in the age group the movie was intended for (which are really the only ones that count) - 4 little thumbs up!

At @ 2-1/2 is when our oldest grandson became aware of Thomas the Train (gosh, where did THOSE years go?), 2010's ""Misty Island Rescue"" DVD had just come out and my husband and I dove head first into his first ""infatuation"" right along with him.  It's amazing the phenomenon a little blue tank engine named Thomas has become since British clergyman, Rev. W. Awdry began telling stories of talking engines to his son Christopher, to keep him entertained as he battled measles back in 1943.  The 26 ""Railway Series"" books he penned between 1945-72, with Christopher himself writing an additional 16 between 1983-2011, are the basis for the television series that began in 1984 and continues today, spawning its first feature film in 2000 (""Thomas & the Magic Railroad""), and a new one each Fall since 2008's ""The Great Discovery"":  2010's Misty Island Rescue, 2011's Day of the Diesels, 2012's Blue Mountain Mystery, 2013's King of the Railway, 2014's Tale of the Brave, 2015's Sodor's Legend of the Lost Treasure, and this year's The Great Race.  (There've been a bunch of other Thomas & Friends DVDs as well.)  As an interesting tidbit, we heard that Andrew Lloyd Webber had originally wanted to do a series-based musical, but Rev. Awdry turned him down!",1471219200,2,5842,4.782522343594836

7786538,3,B01HH20HH4,"our family enjoyed seeing the engines painted and streamlined for the Great Race, as well as the story and songs.  The new engines from all over the world were a great parallel into how things are different outside ""home"", and the message for being yourself was positive and didn't fall prey to some of the more androgynous messages that tend to be conveyed this day and age. It would be rated higher as a 4 if the content rating for the movie was actually rated, even if it was set to ""Family NR"". This messes up parental controls for Amazon Kindle Fire for Kids, and prevents it from being downloaded (unless you cranking up to regular NR).",1509235200,,642,4.487179487179487

7786542,4,B01HH20HH4,"This is a good movie, however Thomas' story (the main story) is not interesting. This movie should have been about Gordon because his subplot with the Flying Scotsman is more interesting than Thomas' story. Ashima is a good character but I think she not interesting. She's like Gator only not as interesting. Also this movie reuses plots like Thomas getting upset that someone else is pulling his coaches. Also this movie has unneeded subplots like Diesel's crate subplot and Vinnie and Phillip subplot. (Even though the Vinnie and Phillip subplot is funny.) The Bridge Jump is over the top and stupid and adds nothing to the story and the international engines (other than Ashima and Vinnie) don't get any screen time and Shooting Star Gordon looks ridiculous. The songs are good. (My favorite was I'm full of surprises.) Overall the movie is good although I wish Gordon was the main character because his story is more interesting and at the 35 minute mark we finally get to the railway show but it's not bad.",1505606400,,1011,4.816091954022989

7786553,5,B01HH20HH4,This is a wonderful musical with your favorite Thomas & Friends characters. We really enjoy watching this movie as a family and sing along to all the songs. My kids watch it every day and I can say that this is their favorite out of all the Thomas & Friends collection. I can tell there are new voices for most of the trains and Sir Topham Hat. The theme of this movie is to love yourself and self-acceptance. You also get to meet one of Gordon's family members who seems to be more self-absorbed than Gordon lol. It's pretty funny to see them interact. I highly recommend that you see this movie. I don't think you will be disappointed.,1496880000,,637,4.361344537815126

I love the new character Ashima and some of the songs are catchy and have a great message. The one about being yourself is my favorite.

It's good to know there are many differences between American English and British English. I'm just enjoying the differences.
In this movie, there are many musicals. The engines are singing more than in other series. For English learners like me, sometimes it's hard to understand their English when they sing, but this can also be a good study.",1490140800,,446,4.96

7786603,5,B01HH20HH4,"I bought this using our Amazon Fire Stick and my son loves it! He loves all things Thomas so this was a clear winner. It's the modern computer animation Thomas stories, which I personally find the most entertaining... because we all know the parents have to endure the kids shows too :) It's a nice storyline about friendly competition, not always getting what you want, and how to be a good winner/loser.

I love how easy it is to buy videos on my Amazon Fire Stick! We have it passcoded so my son can't buy anything, but all we have to do is type a few numbers and its downloaded in seconds. Its definitely helpful when we ""have to watch Thomas RIGHT NOW!"" and there is no time for mommy to pull out her credit card.",1478563200,2,718,4.279411764705882

7786618,5,B01HH20HH4,This is my son's absolute favorite Thomas movie.  We have dozens of other Thomas ones (ranging from very old still ones to the newest) and I think the thing that stands out the most is how this one is a musical.  It really catches his attention and the engines are all very vibrant.  We have watched it three times in a row he loves it so much.  They storyline is basic and good for a young child.  I like how it incorporates engines from other countries.,1475712000,,455,4.244186046511628

7786625,3,B01HH20HH4,"I thought this movie was kind of lame. We liked all  other Thomas movies more. There was a lot of singing in this movie, and it's marketed to seem like the other foreign engines play a much bigger role than they do. Only Ashima gets a starting role. I also think Thomas acts like a sore loser when he isn't chosen to be in the great train races,  but naturally, he ends up being in them anyways through luck and other circumstances. Overall, the plot seemed weak. My boys didn't mind it, but I doubt it will be a favorite one. Pretty disappointed since we were looking forward to a great new Thomas movie.",1474934400,,605,4.298245614035087
7786626,5,B01HH20HH4,My son loved it. I should give it zero stars because they introduced several new characters and revamped some old ones which means I'll be buying more toys for my kid.... gee thanks guys :),1474934400,,189,4.428571428571429
7786627,5,B01HH20HH4,"I started hearing about this movie a couple of months ago when he discovered it on YouTube. He learned all the songs and was counting down the days,  and this did not disappoint!! He loved the whole thing (he can be picky about his Thomas shows)  and I liked it too!!  The whole premise is that there is a big race on the mainland and some engines think they are better than others. And Thomas want to be streamlined and be in the big race!  Much to his disappointment he doesn't even get to go!  But in the end he learns that he is enough just as he is!  He sings I don't need to be faster, bigger,  stronger, etc.  in a catchy song that teaches kids a good lesson,  like back in the days where Mr.  Tanner, Uncle Jesse, and Joey taught us what we could learn at the end. I actually enjoyed most of the movie and liked the good moral lesson.",1474848000,,842,4.079268292682927
7786628,5,B01HH20HH4,My 2 year old Grandson loves everything Thomas.  However Ashima made this his new all time favorite Thomas Movie!!,1474848000,,114,5.0
7786629,5,B01HH20HH4,"My daughter is an on-again-off-again Thomas fanatic, and the release of ""The Great Race"" has definitely moved us into the ""on-again"" camp.  She loves this movie, and the new engine, Ashima, in particular.  The Thomas brand has been criticized for not doing enough to emphasize female characters and appeal to female fans.  But we've been to train shows and Thomas events and there are plenty of girls interested in this show.  While there are other female trains, Ashima is the first one that my daughter (2 years old) asks for by name and that I think she can identify as female.  Maybe that matters, maybe it doesn't, but I definitely don't think it hurts.

The movie is about an hour long, and having been subjected to probably hundreds of hours of Thomas shows and movie features, this is one of the better releases.  It definitely has a more ""musical"" feel than some of the other movies.  I won't say the quality of the musical numbers is ""good"" by an adult standard, but they all have a very positive message and definitely become catchy over time.  I worried ""The Great Race"" was just going to be a huge character dump as a way to sell a dozen new trains, but it's legitimately entertaining, and makes me wish that Ashima became a series regular much like they did when Hiro was introduced.",1474848000,3,1297,4.604347826086957

7786637,5,B01HH20HH4,"This is definitley one of the better Thomas movies.  It is like a musical and has very cute and catchy songs that any child would love.  There is some humor in this movie as well.  It is a bright, light and happy Thomas movie.  There is only one scene my 4 year old son did not like and that involved a train called Vinnie trying to push Phillip off the tracks.  Although my son did not like the mean engine, it was actually a good talking point and started a conversations about Bullies.  Thomas, of course, saves the day and pulls Vinnie away with the help of Ashima.  This is also a good lesson about standing up for someone that is being bullied.  The rest of the lessons are about being yourself and knowing your strengths.  Also, good sportsmanship is shown through Thomas switching tracks with Ashima because her track was blocked.  He let her win because it would not have been fair.  Overall, my son loves it because of all the fun and catchy songs, and I love it because of the good morals and lessons.  But parents beware...your child will be asking for a Ashima engine!",1473724800,12,1081,4.404040404040404
