1971170,5,B00014NE76,"I cannot say enough good about Glyndebourne's 1996 production of Berg's

opera recently (and finally) released on video here in the States.

Initially I believed I'd be disappointed in this unit set.  Wrong.  A tall,

brick semi-circular wall of red brick with offset white bricks that extend

as necessary into beams, creating an angular stage wide staircase joining

otherwise impossible to use doorways, etc.  A bare floor with 3 or 4

concentric circles revolves (sometimes in opposite directions) as necessary

denoting scene changes etc.  At its direct center is a vast round hole.

This circular concept is fascinatingly explored bookending Lulu's going

full circle - beginning and ending in the gutter.  Interesting too watching

her rise from this hole (a really great visual) in her first scene to

sinking permanently into it in the final.  Once again the team of Graham

Vick and Paul Brown shed new light on one of opera's best bad girl

stories.  That said light is brilliant is a cause for celebration!

Andrew Davis leads the London Philharmonic in a reading of the score that

may well be the most heavily romantic I've encountered.  Berg's exquisite

melodies have never sounded more obvious (and sometimes drawn out -

wondrously so) as here.  The jazz elements never sound foreign or archly

intrusive as they sometimes can, but rather all of a piece.  The audience -

already berserk at final curtain goes berserker still at Maestro Davis's

bow.

If ever a singer was made for a role it is Christine Schaefer.  Ms.

Schaefer's incarnation of this notoriously and fiendishly difficult role

comes off, both in voice and body, as an almost ""victoire trop facile"" for

she is, quite simply, Lulu.  Schaefer exudes a raw, otherwordly femininity

and sensuality - the first notable gal to play by her own rules, facing

odds and consequences with an aplomb most men either find shocking or

forget completely the scruples they once possessed.  Brilliantly

costumed Schaefer looks amazing whether she's in leather, lace or latex.

Heck, this Lulu even makes a bath towel look like evening wear.  (And

the ""painting"" with her in almost painted on pants is hot stuff.)

Wolfgang Schoene paints Schoen in broad strokes on a huge emotional canvas

and the payoff is huge!  Wonderful throughout, he is particularly

mesmerizing watching this ""giant"" of a human reduced to putty in the letter

writing scene.  He is a helpless bear and he gets his just desserts, alright!

While not vocally - physically, in Kathryn Harries's portrayal of Geschwitz

looks like Frederica von Stade.  Her countess is particularly pitiable, a

frightened bird - her act of heroism in the escape comes off with

incredible passion.  Also a little creepy since I found it impossible to

decide whether the act was purely selfless or selfish.  Her grizzly, filthy

demise following Lulu's horrifying screams were particularly chilling and

heartbreaking.

Stephan Drakulic offers a tremendous portrayal of the Painter.  Here we see

Lulu's first victim (not, of course, sequentially) trapped in a fatal

obsession where he's so hot for her he can't keep his hands off her (or his pants on).  His Act II with Schoen is really played out bigger than I recall in any other Lulu and it is shattering to watch both ego and love fly out the

window as Schoen repeatedly suggests his sole success was having ""married a

half a million"" - reducing the artist to nothing in a matter of minutes.

His return as a post punk, metal white trash Negro was initially a

humorous, then chilling turn.

Wonderful to see Norman Bailey as a more human than usual Schigolch, yet

retaining a wonderful bum-like craziness.

There is a wonderful black and white film during Act II's great intermezzo -

 showing the action we ""miss"", Lulu's trial, the Countess's panty exchange,

all in a silent ""film noire"" style.  The film ends back at Glyndebourne in

an empty house with Maestro Davis conducting.  Amazing!

I could go on for pages more - but will spare you by saying:  if you love

Lulu - you won't want to be without this most exciting DVD.  It really is

remarkable and Schaefer gives a performance that simply cannot be missed!",1106870400,51,4205,4.915351506456241
1971171,5,B00014NE76,"It might be said that the 20th Century brought along opera's entry into the adult age. Little by little, operas started treating ""delicate"" subjects in a more serious way, one the largely victorian 19th century never dreamt of. Perhaps the trend was started by Richard Strauss, first with Salome and later on with Elektra. And others followed gladly suit, Schnberg with his Moses & Aron, depicting on stage a savage orgy that even today, almost three quarters of a century later, stage directors have a hard time devising tastefully (and perhaps tactfully). Berg was no exception: the 20's saw his Wozzeck and its tormented characters, the 30's this, his unfinished crown jewel with its decadent world of wealth, lust and manipulation that is given here, as is now customary, in the Cerha completion of the last act that Berg's untimely death prevented the composer from finishing.

At last, this production allows for a credible stage Lulu; the Graham Vick production, filmed here almost ten years ago at Glyndebourne's then new theatre does away with the usual overaged singer attempting a rle that is inextricably linked like few others to the visual image of its portrayer and has for us the excellent Christine Schfer, not just looking the part (her young, attractive looks undoubtedly helped) but also despatching its fiendishly difficulty with ease and applomb.

The other parts are also effectively cast, rendering this a winning all-round team effort. Katryn Harries is a superior Geschwitz, David Kuebler an intriguing Alwa. The veteran Norman Bailey appears as Schigolch.

The London Philharmonic, not an ensemble one usually associates with 20th century music, play stupendously and are very well conducted by an Andrew Davis that shows an absolute understanding of the score. Vicks's staging encompasses all three acts with minimum changes (more to do with objects on stage rather than actual scenery modifications) and I've read some critics in UK periodicals whose authors at the time (summer of 1996) did not seem to like it much. Granted, there's no actual displaying of the painter's atlier in Act 1 or Paris saloon, London street, etc. in other parts of the work, but to me it flows well; the work is so well directed you don't actually need scenery changes.

This video (in its VHS incarnation, back in 1997) deservedly won the prestigious Award for Best Video granted by the well-known Gramophone magazine in the UK, and may we say very much so especially in this new, DVD edition.",1097539200,20,2502,5.0508474576271185
1971172,5,B00014NE76,"This modern reinterpretaion of the timeless opera shows the eternal character of the story.  The minimal set that exudes the old adage, ""simple is best"" and removes distractions and brings the audience to the soul.

Christine Schfer is terribly seductive while the male characters are utterly convincing, with the impeccable singing technique and wildly expressive acts.

How wonderful it is to have it available on a recorded medium, as the richness and the density of the material allows the viewer to take it in a little by little.",1095120000,4,534,5.045454545454546
1971173,5,B00014NE76,"This is one of the best operas of 20th century and the opera is realist and story is narrated with a heavy language, very effective...
And this performance is really excellent. Decor is minimalist and very good. The cast has no weak link and Andrew Davis with his London Philharmonic bring dramatic and powerful interpretation.
The silent film (in 2 Act) is terrific and they followed all instructions of Berg. This music has a different form: music starts with film, continues and arrives to centre of music, and then music runs backward! (with whole orchestra takes mutes in instruments).
This is a story about the rise and fall in society of a ""femme fatale"", from life as a society hostess in a casino in Paris to prostitution in London's dirty streets. She makes three wedding, which ends all her three husbands deaths and she be indifferent in all of them (from the Proffesor to Alwa). She eventually descends into prostitution and eventual bloody death at the hands of Jack the Ripper! And he kills Countess Geschwitz, too, who is the in love to Lulu!
Lulu's three husbands:
The Professor Goll -  deaths with a suddenheart disease
The Painter - who painted Lulu's portrait
Dr. Schn - Alwa's father
These three man first appears in 1st and 2nd Acts, are appears once more in 3rd Act (2nd Scene in London) with these characters:
The Professor - the first client of Lulu
The Negro (actually the Painter)- 2nd client and kills Alwa (the last husband of Lulu), because of The Negro attacks Lulu and Alwa wants to save Lulu but the Negro kills him...
Jack the Ripper (actually Dr. Schn)
And this situation is not an economy in singer's cast. This  means that, Lulu's dead husbands to take vengeance.
Highly recommended for any Alban Berg and opera admirers.",1082246400,4,1758,4.741830065359477
1971174,5,B00014NE76,"Berg's LULU is a stunning work.  Possibly the best opera of the twentieth century - certainly in the top five.  This Glyndebourne production is musically, dramatically and technically impeccable, although the minimalist staging probably worked better in the theater than it does on video.  Nevetheless, this is definitely one to own for anyone who has a taste for modern opera, or who is open to developing one.  (Now I hope someone will release the Teresa Stratas video from the eighties which is out on DVD only in Japan, and not playable in the US).",1079654400,8,552,4.840425531914893
1971175,5,B00014NE76,"Lulu is a very complex work. This DVD makes justice to all of the complexness of the work: musical and dramatic. First of all: Christine Schfer. Since Teresa Stratas she is the most impressive singer to play this difficult role. As she is a genuine coloratura , Schfer can handle with all these crazy cadenzas with naturality. And her personification of Lulu is as ambigous as Wedekind( the play ' s writer) has though. But it isn' t only Schfer that is fantastic in this DVD. Wolfgang Schne is a convincent Schon and Jack the riper. Stephan Drakulich as The Painter and the Neger is very sexy and exciting . The old wagnerian bass-baritone Norman Bailey is a moving and repulsive Schigolch (and yet in a very good voice).Alwa, one of the most demanding tenor roles in all lyric repertoire, is very well sung by David Kuebler, and his naive looking is very moving during all the performance. Kathryn Harries as Geschwitz is fantastic too. Her final singing is a golden key for this performance. Far from one analytical aproach, Andrew Davies made a romantic and effective reading of the score. The London Philharmonic is in a special day, sounding realy as a great orchestra. The violin  and piano solos, at the first scene of act three are very well played.
The staging, transposed for a modern time ( Lulu is atemporal) is fantastic by the simplicitiy of the sets and the coherence (the steps marking Lulu's ascension and fall !!!). Sexuality flows over all the singers. But always with naturality. And I would like to remark also that this  mise en scene has a fine movie during the intermezzo of the second act, folowing all the instructions of Berg.
  For this ( low) price you will have one of the best readings of the score , only comparable with that of Boulez (1978), and one very special staging of one of the most important opera of the history, maybe .....the last great opera.",1077753600,61,1889,4.6467065868263475
1971176,5,B00014NE76,"Lulu is not an easy opera to get to know. It is written in a twelve tone style (serial) invented by Arnold Schoenberg. But Berg's serial music is easier to listen to than Schoenberg and many parts of Lulu are beautiful in their own way.
This DVD is a perfect way to get acquainted with the score. It is a perfect performance and Christine Schafer has both the vocal resources for this difficult part as well as the looks and acting ability for this femme fatale. The rest of the cast are fully up to her.
The production is pretty bare: a brick wall with a stairway up to two doors, a wooden floor and chairs. But don't let that steer you off. The important thing in Lulu is passion, and it is here in spades.",1075075200,29,708,4.213235294117647
1971197,5,B00014NE76,"While so many classic operas are about sex and death, this tradition is taken to a whole new level of sordidness in Alban Berg's two operas, of which ""Lulu"" is the second. The title character of ""Lulu"" is an antiheroine who destroys every man in her path, starting a fling with anything with a penis (and even a lesbian countess) but really desperate to hold on to her sugar daddy Dr. Schn. Eventually her crimes catch up with her. At the intermission, a silent film is projected depicting her imprisonment and escape. In the second half of this symmetrical opera, Lulu herself is destroyed. ""Lulu"" has gunplay, pimps and a prison break. Who wouldn't love it?

Berg's music for this drama is twelve-tone serialism, but of the very Viennese flavour typical for this composer. If you are unsure whether you are up for a couple of hours of such music, try the ""Lulu Suite"" that Berg compiled from music for the opera (best heard under Boulez and the NY Philharmonic on a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-disc/dp/B000002702/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony disc</a>). But I think that the lushness of the orchestration and the prevalence of waltz rhythms will prove accessible to any listener who enjoys Mahler's symphonies. The music is like a rich piece of cake. I especially admire ""Lulu"" for keeping the roles so musically delineated a la Wagner. Lulu, the Countess, Dr. Schn and his son Alwa each have distinct vocal parts and orchestral accompaniment, far from the greyness typically associated with modernism.

Berg worked on the opera from 1929 until his untimely death in 1935, but the orchestration of some of the third act was incomplete. While Berg's widow kept an iron grip on the rights, after her death the Austrian composer Friedrich Cerha was able to complete the third act. It is this completed version that is found here on this DVD, recorded at the Glyndebourne Festival in 1996. Andrew Davis conducts the London Philharmonic, with Christine Schaefer in the title role.

It's a fine production. The setting is early 20th-century Germany and Switzerland as Berg intended, and the only innovation is somewhat contemporary costumes (which helps a bit to solve the problem of the role of the African in Act III, a faithful portrayal of which would be intolerable today). I find Schaefer to be a convincing Lulu -- she doesn't exhibit over-the-top sexuality, but rather is cutesy, coy. Her performance reminds one that the sort of people that destroy their lovers in succession tend to be initially disarming.

While the classic audio-only recording of this opera is the world premiere of the completed version under Boulez and the Orchestre de l'Opera de Paris&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/on-Deutsche-Grammophon/dp/B00004R7X8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">on Deutsche Grammophon</a>, and that is an essential purchase for any 20th-century music fan, I'd encourage anyone interested in ""Lulu"" to experience it on this DVD first. In order to ""crack"" an opera, one really needs the visual element, especially in a work with an important silent film screened halfway through (yes, this production made a new film with the singers involved, following Berg's highly detailed instructions). I'm so grateful to the Glyndebourne Festival for filming this in a very professional -- if stereo-only -- fashion.",1353369600,2,3400,5.397363465160075
1971198,4,B00014NE76,"The opera was well sung and well staged, however, it was in German, fine, that's what I expected, but given the minimalist staging and no English translation sub titles, the action and words being sung were very hard to follow.  I do wish Amazon would always specify when there is or is not a sub-title translation.  Was I pleased with my purchase . . . YES!",1345248000,3,358,4.409090909090909
1971199,5,B00014NE76,"Note for Berg (or opera) lovers: this was the only DVD performance of Berg's LuLu that I could find a few months ago. Since then several more have appeared at Amazon. I'm glad I saw this performance first, though: the perfection of the performance and the production combined with the (sometimes distracting) realization of the ultimate in trendy of the (2006) time should make it a classic. I'm glad I saw it before I was tempted by the other releases.

The DVD presentation is done as if live at Glyndebourne -- I suspect it's a combination of theatre takes and for-camera scenes. One thing is certain: the whole production is brilliantly conceived and very nearly completely realized. Christine Schafer's acting talent is exploited to the utmost and her voice is not only spectacular in range and purity but co-ordinates with her actions and expressions to give a chillingly consistent picture of LuLu, perfectly and passionlessly amoral -- or is she in some strange way perfectly innocent? The singers are all pretty amazing. Fine rich voices, mostly good acting, and Berg's vocal lines soar from the the singers as if spontaneously evoked rather than laboriously learned.

The setting is a visual treat: one very spare (but also very fancy) stage setting and almost no furnishings or props beyond a set of chairs and an occasionally appearing table or vase. The long undulating staircase of cantilevered boards with no apparent support and no outside rail gives an entirely appropriate sense of unease and even danger as actor/singers ascend and descend to doors high above the stage, and what appears to be an open well shaft in the middle of the action is downright scary -- also entirely appropriately. Slowly revolving wide concentric rings in the floor make an eerie dumbshow (an ancient theatrical tradition, a sort of group mime) of scene shifts as furniture and characters pass and mingle. The production is worth studying for the set alone; admirers of Gordon Craig's stage designs (Craig was developing his ideas as Berg developed his) will recognise it immediately.

That said, I thought the production a bit too trendy in places -- writhing about on the floor in simulated sex is already a dated idea, and the contortions muffle the singing, too, as you'll find if you try closing your eyes to spare yourself Schafer's embarrassment. The cell phones some characters whip out are clunky and already dated and used perfunctorily, as a wall phone with rotary dial and handpiece, more or less period already, wouldn't have been. But what to one person is a flawed scene or idea may be another's idea of genius.

The performance includes a short silent film as an entracte, as Berg intended. Berg's subtle homage to the pantomime that inspired the plays that inspired the opera? It seemed also the production's homage to the Louise Brooks ""Pandora's Box"" (it's not certain that Berg ever saw that film). The silent film is often left out, partly because it's thought to require a new version for every cast, so its inclusion is anothe tribute to Berg and to the completeness of the production.

There seemed to me to be many subtle references to the Georg Pabst silent movie, Pandora's Box (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pandora-s-Box-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000HT3QBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pandora's Box (The Criterion Collection)</a>), and the Criterion Collection DVD set would make a good companion to the opera.

As always, the ""real"" DVD package has much more to offer than a Netflix disk or a TV showing.",1317686400,4,3573,5.1411359724612735
1971200,4,B00014NE76,"Just a word for other folks who watch opera as they do operetta or Broadway musicals, for the gratification of the thing in itself. Deeper meanings, musical technicalities, the place of this opera in the history of opera, are all significant attributes...but not for us.
Having just finished watching this version of Lulu, I would say that the story is hackneyed, the setting design at best doesn't help the production, there was some weakness in the initial singing of the lead, but, when all is said and done, it was a gripping production marked by excellent performances which, as I suggested, seemed to suffer little from the ambiance of the set.
I would not argue for or against the musical commitments of Berg, by now you will know whether you accept or reject them. I would say that after the initial adjustment period to the music (as opposed to that in the  most recent opera I had heard written in an earlier time period)I found little difficulty in staying attuned to the style.",1217462400,4,989,4.716763005780347
1971201,3,B00014NE76,"Alban Berg's two operas, Wozzeck and Lulu, are the epitome of German Expressionism, like a canvas by Max Beckmann or Otto Dix set to music and staged. Whether you choose to interpret them as powerful sermons against depravity or as paeans to the allure of decadence, you may find them hard to watch - exalted ugliness, glittering gloom.

Lulu portrays the 'career' of a sexually overpowering beauty - femme fatale, black widow, Eve - as she degenerates from pampered mistress to opportunistic seductress to prostitute to victim of a sadist's knife. Her essential vulgarity and narcissism nonetheless prove attractive to artists, composers, men of wealth and influence, and a lesbian countess just as much as to thugs and low-lifes. None of them are capable of touching Lulu's inner being. It's almost impossible not to see Lulu as a portrayal, intended as such or not, of the perversity of German culture in the decades before World War II.

So why watch and hear such a depressing opera? Well, of course, ugliness is as much a valid subject for art as beauty, and Berg succeeds in making this ugliness musically awesome. Berg's use of ""twelve-tone"" structuralism in his music is extremely strict and intellectual, yet the lush orchestral textures that result are anything but academic. Sometimes his music becomes so intense that it's scary. For a composer who wrote only two operas, his understanding of the human voice as an instrument amazes me. Lulu will stand as the iconic musical expression of 20th C modernism as far into the future as opera survives.

But now the bad news. This is a flawed production, and the flaw is in Christine Schaefer's performance as Lulu. She has neither the physical presence nor the vocal magnificence to carry the role. She sounds whiny and thin when she needs to sound scornful and defiant. She pipes her highest passages like a tin whistle when she needs to blare her physicality over the raging orchestra. Too bad! Every other singer on the stage has more depth of voice; every other portrayal seems utterly 'right' both dramatically and vocally. Without a compelling Lulu, however, this production stalls again and again.",1216598400,12,2163,4.969613259668508
1971202,4,B00014NE76,"This is the only commercial DVD release of Berg's Lulu in complete 3 acts at the time of writing. I like the performance here. Christine Schfer is a great champion of modern music. Her outstanding performance betrays the affinity with Berg's idioms, both vocally and theatrically. Other singers are also quite good. Andrew Davis leads London Philharmonic in a performance which does Berg's masterwork justice by bringing the intricate texture of the music to life. The orchestra's playing is clear enough to follow Berg's scores easily, but the tone is warm enough to sense links to the last romantic masters, like Mahler. Graham Vick's stage direction is, for the most part, commendable and following the scripts. (There are a few regrettable departures, though.) A deserving winner of the 1997 Gramophone Award for Best Video. The only shortcoming is the lackluster audio in heavily compressed Dolby Digital 2.0 format. This is an opera DVD and music must come first. Dolby Digital is not the format for a music DVD! (Fortunately, the sound here is not nearly as bad as some of Kultur's other opera DVDs.)

A short comment on the 3rd act. I personally strongly recommend 3-act performance over the 2-act truncation. Berg passed away before completing the 3rd act, but he left sufficient material, including almost complete short score of the 3rd act, to his widow. The 3rd act was later completed by Cerha, essentially following Berg's material. Therefore, it is fair to consider the music in the third act ""essentially due to Berg himself."" (I personally find the music flow between the first 2 acts and the last one to be completely seamless.) The interested reader may find detailed account of this matter in George Perle's (a Berg super-specialist) book ""The Operas of Alban Berg, Volume II: Lulu"".

------------------
It might be instructive to compare this video with the only other video with complete 3 acts: Pierre Boulez's 1979 l'Opra de Paris film, which unfortunately is only available as Japanese or Chinese edition, or as bootleg version. I personally prefer the Boulez's. With Stratas as Lulu and Patrice Chereau as director, it really shines! Boulez's conducting is predictably leaner and cooler, and the references to 12 tone music is decidedly emphasized, and romantic elements suppressed.

The sets are minimal and the costumes are essentially modern. However, the acting, singing and pacing of this opera is as close to perfect as one could ever hope for. I have the Teresa Stratas / Pierre Boulez recording on CD on DG. Boulez' Lulu is very ""in your face"" and he revels in the atonality of the work. However, this Glyndebourne production actually makes the work sound more lyrical and natural.

I highly recommend this recording - along with Christine Schfer's 'One Nigh. One Life' DVD.

Lulu isn't an easy work and it isn't meant to be easy listening. However, as a human drama, it is in a league of its own. Some have said that Christine Schfer was too young for this part - she sings in a clear, vibrato-free voice (she has a voice perfect for 18th century music) - how her youth and ""earthy sexiness"" are great assets here, we can easily believe that men will do foolish and criminal things to possess her.",1136073600,10,951,4.485549132947977

8006535,5,B00014NE76,"While the Metropolitan Opera's LULU on DVD has the advantages of bargain price, stylish design and a production that is scrupulously faithful to Alban Berg's stage directions (not necessarily in that order of priority), Glyndebourne's Graham Vick production makes its own, equally persuasive case for the Friedrich Cerha completion of the score, thanks to Sir Andrew Davis' post-Romantic interpretation. The third act sounds all of a piece, whereas other readings have shown it as lacking compared to the powerful concision of Berg's completed Acts I & II. (Only Davis convinces me that Cerha hasn't been monkeying around to make Act 3 sound more Serialist.) Vick's production is the essence of simplicity: a half-circular playing arena, with a brick wall and staircase at the back, and a pit in the center of the stage into which characters occasionally descend -- or get dumped. The action is set in the present, which is fine because Berg's libretto isn't clearly wedded to any particular time period, now seemingly Art Deco but reaching back into the Victorian era to conjure up Jack the Ripper.

Christine Schaefer is an ""earth spirit"" to the life, singing the music -- especially the coloratura -- in bel canto style. She's a sexual, self-aware but not overly knowing Lulu, somewhere between Evelyn Lear's kittenish siren and Laura Aikin's corrupted innocent. And although the men in the opera try to cast Lulu in their own image of her, Schaefer's is always firmly her own creature. Too pity she's paired with the mostly pitchless ranting of Wolfgang Schoene (Dr. Schoen), who is well below the standard set by the Met's Franz Mazura. For instance, Jack the Ripper's transfixiation by the moon goes for nothing here. David Kuebler is a near-ideal Alwa, plangent in tone, and the unfamiliar tenor who plays the Painter does his job creditably. To this honor roll can be added Norman Bailey, the most powerful (and asthmatic) of Schigolches, Kathryn Harries' imposing Countess Geschwitz, Donald Maxwell's winning Animal Trainer/Acrobat double-dip, and a multi-role triumph by Neil Jenkins, including an especially decadent Marquis. In short, Glyndebourne has -- with one exception -- fielded the first team and, under Vick's insightful direction, three hours pass quickly indeed.

For the two-act torso, I think the Zurich performance can be quickly disposed of (compare Franz Welser-Most's limp rendering of the fourfold ""doom"" chords that conclude Acts I & II with Davis' overwhelming rendition). The Vienna premiere, on ArtHaus, with Lear as Lulu and Karl Bohm conducting, is decisively to be preferred. As for the Cerha completion, Mazura gives the Met a slight edge, but I really cannot choose between it and Glyndebourne. Each has its own form of greatness.",1471478400,2,2768,5.190156599552573
8006536,1,B00014NE76,This product is a shame and a disappointing product of a beautiful opera. I'm returning this disk to Amazon.  First of all this disk is not what you would expect from a Blu-ray.  The  sound is like it came out of a 1940s recording.  The grainy picture is no better.,1468195200,,265,4.24
8006537,1,B00014NE76,"I was very disappointed by the quality of the bluray. Sound is stereo, and average recording. More surprising the picture, a 4:3 square in high definition . I tought first my player had a problem. The picture really look like HD quality, but 4:3 only. Maybe a mistake from recording. Some DVD have better quality (16:9 and 5.1).
Beside that, the direction is not very impressive. Minimal set on stage. Mix of stage performance and video clips is not great.",1432598400,,456,4.7125
8006538,5,B00014NE76,"Christine Schfer's performance is outstanding. Although the disk format is blu-ray, the video quality is no better than that of a standard DVD. Presumably the performance was not recorded with high definition equipment.",1430179200,,219,5.666666666666667

8006542,5,B00014NE76,"I accidentally bought this version of Lulu instead of the 2010 Salzburg Festival one starring Patricia Petibon (which I bought anyway after I learned my error).  This opera is rather wrenching and haunting, musically and story-wise.  Of the two versions I now own, I must say I much prefer this 1996 Glyndebourne production.  I suppose the director of the Salzburg production thought the phrase ""less is more"" was bull and painted this already dark piece black with it's ultra surreal sets and staging.  Petibon seemed mentally disturbed with the ultra-giant eyes she seemed to make at every development.  (And what was the deal with the Mink Stole red hair?)  I will say though, as much as I didn't really appreciate many of the acting and staging choices, the music was played and sung beautifully all around.

I appreciated that the Glyndebourne production didn't add any unnecessary darkness, and wasn't quite so over the top.  Schafer played the lead beautifully with grace and subtlety.  What a stunning voice!  Ordering this production was a fine mistake on my part; I would suggest if one is torn between the two, pick the Schafer Glyndebourne production.",1397347200,4,1163,5.010416666666667
8006543,5,B00014NE76,"Great cast, great musicianship, great production. Schafer was born for this role & brings the (highly complex, difficult) music to life! Highly recommend this modern production.",1389657600,,177,5.846153846153846
