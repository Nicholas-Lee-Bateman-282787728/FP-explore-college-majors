8492715,5,B0064NLREA,"The film has not only the history of Fenway (including the good, the bad AND the ugly), it also has a brief and fascinating history of baseball itself. Since there are so few real ballparks left and Fenway is the best of all AND my ""home park"", this documentary covers all the bases for me.

The one glaring problem is that, while the idea behind the 100th anniversary ""ball players' parade"" was great, the application stunk; the organizers really fell down on the job identifying the ball players as they walked out onto the field and to their appropriate positions. All we saw, after the first few players, was an enormous group of men, wearing Red Sox jerseys appropriate to their playing era (many with no names on the back) walking out into left field. While you can recognize a lot of them, many you can't. Bad implementation of a great idea. At the end of the day, though, I can live with that because the dvd is a treasure for any Sox fan and I STILL love it.",1386806400,3,967,4.402234636871508
