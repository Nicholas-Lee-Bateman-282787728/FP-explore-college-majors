Although this video was originally recorded in VHS Format, it has transferred to DVD Format quite well. John Farnham is truly one of the best live performers that I have ever seen, such a great voice and everything he does live has always better than the Studio recordings. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who appreciates a good singer and truly live performances- rare nowadays.",1323216000,,391,4.835820895522388
8169428,5,B000CIXDAO,"I recorded this concert about 1995 years ago on a VHS tape (it was broadcasted in polish TV) and since this time I was watching it periodically, always with great pleasure. Now I'm very, very luky watching it on the DVD. In spite of the video is 4:3 format (but it is perfect, of course), the audio is digitally enhanced to DTS/Dolby Digital 5.1 !!! Audio was always most important for me in the music, so this is now a great pleasure watching John Farnam's show and feeling like really sitting with the audience.
The show in my opinion is beautiful either now, when I'm 45, or was beautiful 15 years ago, when I watched it for the first time. John Farnam is not my favourite singer, I rather prefere heavy/hard rock music, but I like all songs on this DVD. I don' t want to analyse and describe the DVD show, but I can tell you, what is most important: Farnam sings beautifull songs and makes some kind of magic - his music charmes either the audience at the show, or the person, who watch it on TV. I was overcomed with emotions several times watching the show and listening his voice, the music and the orchestra.
If you want to be charmed with the music and emotions - you must watch this show in one piece, in silence and concentration. I guarantee - you will remember this concert forever.",1283040000,5,1295,4.377593360995851
8169429,1,B000CIXDAO,I also received a PAL version that I am unable to play.  I'll be returning for one that I CAN enjoy!,1200268800,,100,3.761904761904762
8169430,5,B000CIXDAO,"Attention Amazon! You sent me a PAL disc,which is not playable in region 1 players. You have the video format as NTSC (American)but you sent me a PAL (European) region 0 disc! Please correct your error on the technical specs of this disc. With that said, John Farnham took over as lead voice for the Australian group Little River Band. He replaced Glen Sharrock(spelling?)as lead voice in 1983 or so. I saw an HBO special in 1983 featuring LRB with John out in front. ABLOLUTELY AMAZING!!John has been(arguably)the best voice in Australia for more than thirty years. It is sad that Americans have not found John to listen to. If there is such a thing as vocal perfection,you will find it on this disc. There is a range of note and voice that raises the hair on your arms and the back of your neck. Please listen and be amazed. I will let ""The Voice"" convince you of that. Amazon, please fix your ad.",1200268800,,899,4.487804878048781
