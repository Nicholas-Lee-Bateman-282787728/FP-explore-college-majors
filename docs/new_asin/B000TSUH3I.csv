8210841,4,B000TSUH3I,"Judge John Deed is a character that you cannot but help admire. On the one hand, he is (predictably) unafraid of authority and is quite happy to get into a fight. On the other hand, his affairs are rather contrary to the stuffy image that we have of English judges in their powdered wigs. Deed's perpetual conflict with Sir Ian Richardson and the Lord Chancellor's Department makes for adequate intrigue and politics in a typically old-world British setting. The stories in each of these episodes (I own the whole set including ones that I purchased off Amazon UK) are very well devloped and each episode leaves you feeling ""good"" that justice has been done. Do not expect unexpected twists and turns. Most of the plots are quite predictable... it is the characters, the settings, and the overall interplay that makes this series interesting.",1194998400,8,842,4.895104895104895
