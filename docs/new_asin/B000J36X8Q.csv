8148812,1,B000J36X8Q,First I was very disappointed the case that was advertised had no car had a very blah DVD took a long time to get here but did come on it's last day.  think the video had a lot less than what was advertised. Using Ford name thought there'd be more to the video. My opinion this video is not worth the money I paid for it sorry.  Thanks Stan Old Timer,1377734400,,350,3.915492957746479
8148813,5,B000J36X8Q,"I gave this to my dad for Christmas and he watched it over and over again. These cars were a part of his personal history, which made it all the more special.",1358812800,,158,3.96875
8148814,4,B000J36X8Q,"Lots of good film in this flick, but there is one part that is silent and really has no meaning, no explanation so you know what's going on.  There should have been sound on all of it.  But... it's still very interesting.  Also, the first part about the '49 Ford build end with no real great ending.

8148815,4,B000J36X8Q,I haven't seen this yet. I gave to my dad as a gift. He likes it.,1275264000,,65,3.125
8148816,5,B000J36X8Q,I got this for my 7yo son because he is obsessed with classic cars and he loved learning all about the old cars and the way they made them.  It isn't a kids DVD but I think any older kid obsessed with cars like mine would enjoy it.  I thought it was pretty interesting too.,1264809600,5,273,3.9454545454545453
