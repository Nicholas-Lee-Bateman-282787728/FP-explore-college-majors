8095479,4,B000C3L2OS,"I was happy to finally get this. It includes 2 decent pre-code films by Joel McCrea and a couple of other flicks. My interest was aroused by the inclusion of Bird of Paradise, a rare old film which was remastered & rereleased in B&W by Kino Classics as part of the David O. Selznick Collection. At $20 plus it's fairly expensive. The PD version of the print used here for this DVD is quite sharp & of very good quality (it's shown in sepia). It appears to be uncut, including the risque swimming scene. My version does show some wear, BUT I have absolutely no quality issue complaints considering the money I've spent. (It appears some fans of the film aren't to happy with Kino's reissue). Bird of Paradise is about 80 years old - it's pre-code racy, somewhat interesting, politically incorrect, dated & a little bit creaky, too. Not being a hardcore fan of Bird of Paradise, I was simply curious & I'm more than happy I ordered it. I also enjoyed McCrea's other film, Silverhorde, plus the 2 others included are a bonus. I do wish that Platinum Disc would stop putting their logo in the bottom corner of the screen. Overall, ""Thumbs Up"".
