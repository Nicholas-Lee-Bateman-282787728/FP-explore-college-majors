6958600,5,B00S4YGW8I,"I really loved watching the documentary film ""Pelican Dreams.""  I live near the coast and see pelicans almost every day but I didn't really know much about them until I watched this film.

""Pelican Dreams"" is not a big budget documentary like they type the BBC puts out but it has some amazing footage of pelicans in their breeding areas.  Most of the film is about the rescue and release facilities that rehabilitates sick and injured birds.  I came away with a lot of admiration for what these people do to save the pelicans.

""Pelican Dreams"" is highly recommended for anyone who loves these amazing animals.",1430352000,,611,4.726415094339623

In fact, it was informative and sweet to learn about these birds.  Hard to watch the part where they are getting hurt by manmade hazards like oil spills.  Looking forward to more films like this by this producer.",1439424000,,343,4.573770491803279

8697291,5,B00S4YGW8I,"As a former wildlife rehabber, I really appreciated both viewpoints on the non releasable pelican.  It revealed the gray area that we sometimes overlook in this field.  I especially enjoyed the descriptive narration by rehabber Monte Merrick, both scientific and personal, made me appreciate a bird that I only had the opportunity to work with once.",1430697600,,349,5.214285714285714
