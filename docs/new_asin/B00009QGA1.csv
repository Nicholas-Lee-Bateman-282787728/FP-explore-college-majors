7992717,4,B00009QGA1,Possibly their largest budget ever. Definitely their most epic. This is silliness and fun at it's best. Possibly one of their top 5 movies made.,1365033600,,144,4.8
7992718,5,B00009QGA1,"Where do I start? The stunning visuals, the top-notch acting, or the unique and original take on the fantasy genre? I don't want to ruin this movie for you, so just watch it and fall in love like I have.",1358467200,,203,4.1
7992719,1,B00009QGA1,"This may well be the most un-entertaining film I have ever seen, and it is certainly among the very worst. Low budget does not even begin to describe this project; it makes the early Mogadore, Ohio films featured in the ""Bad Movie Police"" series seem Oscar-worthy in comparison.

The plot is intended as a parody of fantasy movies, which could easily be a vein of pure satirical gold, but here is more akin to plutonium in that it is cinematically radioactive, and has a half-life of 24,100 years before it may be safe to view. Even then, I wouldn't risk it.

The plot pits orcs and goblins against elves and the protagonists in a melange wherein the Goblin King threatens to cover all of central earth with egg salad. This seemed in part rather derivative of Woody Allen's ""What's Up, Tiger Lily?"", while the narration device hearkened back to ""The Princess Bride"", a movie demonstrating that farcical fantasy films can be wondrous, unlike ""Quest for the Egg Salad"". The acting, dialogue, and direction are terrible, the script is stupid, not satirical, and the characters are grossly unlikable. If you are almost to the end of the film and you think it can't get any worse, stand by for the forest goblin dance, which reminded me of  ""Can't Stop the Music"", only not nearly as good. The best moment really is a line about John Stamos. I only wish that John Stamos had been here, as his presence alone would have improved the quality of this project by several orders of magnitude. Really.

The DVD has some bonus features including cast and fan commentaries (ponder that), and the lamest ""making of"" and blooper reels ever. How lame you ask? At one point there are actually subtitles advising the audience that the filmmakers are aware how boring the footage is, and telling the hapless viewer that it gets better. It doesn't. Here's a little film school tip: if it's boring and irrelevant, edit it.

I have rarely had a more disagreeable viewing experience that watching ""Quest for the Egg Salad"". Far from being entertaining satire, it was just plain awful.",1208304000,5,2061,4.745810055865922
7992720,4,B00009QGA1,"ok so this movie was a slight disapointment for me..

I'm a huge fan of LBP movies and CHRIS SEAVER is awesome.. but this one just didn't have the same flair of his other films..

THOUGH at least it's not three hours long with no ending.. SO that makes it better than that big name movie they are making fun of with this..

I still recommend this as I do all LBP films..

so go get it freaks!

but first get MULVA ZOMBIE ASS KICKER, MULVA II KILL TEEN APE, FILTHY MCNASTY, FILTHY MCNASTIER and FILTHY MCNASTIEST!

also just so ya know AMAZON.COM doesnt' know what they are talking about... LLOYD KAUFMAN was supposed to be GANDOLFINI but instead due to schedule issues CHRIS SEAVER replaced Loyd with his character BONEJACK

and DOUG SACKMAN isn't in the movie either TIM EKKIBUS plays the GOBLIN KING!",1145318400,2,802,4.489655172413793
7992721,1,B00009QGA1,"It's rare to find a movie with no redeeming qualities on any level, but this one fits the bill. Imagine some guys from the local community college, who spend a little too much time playing role-playing games, borrowing someone's dad's camcorder and making a movie in the local park during their days off from Wal-Mart. That should give you an idea of what you're in for here. These boys obviously have dirty minds worthy of any 13 year-old boy, but they couldn't even find any girls willing to take their tops off and provide a little prurient interest. The best thing about ""Quest for the Egg Salad"" is its running time: 60 minutes. Just remember, you've been warned.",1071964800,11,668,4.669491525423729
