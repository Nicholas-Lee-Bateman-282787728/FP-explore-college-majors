2630200,5,B000H6SXMO,"I bought this DVD for my brother-in-law, a Swede who LOVES hockey. He suggested I watch it and I must confess, I didn't think I'd like it (I'm a casual hockey fan). I loved it! I learned a lot and I was entertained, too. It's great. You'll love it.",1171929600,6,248,4.081632653061225
2630201,5,B000H6SXMO,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend and although it didn't arrive by the time he came home from Christmas vacation with his family in Florida, when he finally got to open it he was floored!  It scored me huge brownie points.  Even his boys were like ""Dude, your girl is the best!""  So all-in-all, it was a great product, although it would have been nice had it gotten here sooner.",1169942400,3,398,4.351351351351352
2630202,5,B000H6SXMO,I cried when Gretzky retired!  I love this tape!  I cherish it and watch it from time to time and try to show it to other hockey enthusiast. The product was in excellent condition and made my day when I got it.  Sorry I didn't put my review in much quicker!,1369872000,,257,4.0
2630203,4,B000H6SXMO,came in right on time and has a decent amount of moments in NHL history. Decent price for what is on there,1359244800,,106,3.8636363636363638
2630204,5,B000H6SXMO,"I really liked that it wasn't coaches and announcers talking about the players and the sport, but many actual players did the talking, especially Wayne Gretsky.  I guess if ""The Great One"" asks you to participate in a dvd of hockey action, you probably don't turn him down.",1358294400,,273,4.6875

2630208,5,B000H6SXMO,"I got this as a gift for my nephews when the younger one (5 years old) got a hat trick. They keep this in the car and play it frequently as they travel around going to practices and games. They both love it, have learned from it, and been inspired by it. It's something they can watch repeatedly without being bored.

I told my nephews I was looking forward to wearing their jersey's when they are on a NHL team! Go Hockey Players!",1299196800,,431,4.192771084337349
2630209,4,B000H6SXMO,"This DVD is similar to the NFL version. It's great to see past and present heroes but I feel the DVD lacks content. There's just so much more that could of been part of this DVD. Who knows, maybe there's a plan to make a volume 2. Alot of stars and their moments could of been added. Nevertheless, it's a great DVD to have. I'm a big Mario Lemieux fan, and to see him fight his illness and regain the MVP was awesome. They've even added a little on Sidney Crosby's moments on draft day. I would of just liked to see more stars in this DVD.",1270771200,3,539,4.046728971962617

8137228,5,B000H6SXMO,"There are a large number of great moments in the sport on this DVD, from the earliest days of the NHL until the present.  It doesn't skip any particular set of years in favor of others, and contains a good mix of different moments. Particular note is the ONLY record not held by Wayne Gretzky: Most total points in a game.  Of the 62 possible records for non-goalies, the Great One holds 61. Kudos to the makers for noting this, as it was an impressive performance by the player who holds the record.  This is a good hockey fan collection of sweet plays. One item missing: The penalty against goalie Patrick Roy for going past the red line. This was most notable precisely because Roy actually out-deked Wayne Gretzky while skating toward center ice- no mean feat for anyone, let alone a guy in ful goalie pads!  Great DVD for any hockey fan- or as a break-in intro for novices.",1374537600,,878,4.46875
8137229,5,B000H6SXMO,"I gave this to my friend as a birthday present as he just turned 22!  The look on his face when he opened the gift bag, was all I needed to know that I'd picked out the right present for him! He couldn't wait to watch it, and was ecstatic! To me there was no better reward then seeing the biggest smile I'd ever  seen in my young life! It wasn't about money on this fine occasion. Because making a friend smile is priceless!  All in all, one of the greatest gifts I've ever purchased!",1374537600,3,484,4.073684210526316
