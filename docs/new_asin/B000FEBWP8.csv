8290092,3,B000FEBWP8,"HI film friends! I recently viewed this movie despite how bad reviews were, hey you cant trust anyone! I really feel that kids would like this movie alot. It is an adventure movie, sprinkled with special effects and some badly edited kung fu. Kids would enjoy this movie , with their imagination they could make the bad kung fu seem awesome ! Really just a goofy movie to watch when you are completely bored, and it is only good for one viewing, barf! I gave it three stars cause the story was strong plus it had kung fu hustle stars in it ! woo hoo!",1173225600,,550,4.247619047619048
