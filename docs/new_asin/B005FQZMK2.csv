4684745,4,B005FQZMK2,"A fun explanation of many traditions surrounding Christmas.  However factual it might be good to save the viewing for a child who still believes in ""Santa Claus"".  I liked it.",1325808000,,175,4.8
4684746,5,B005FQZMK2,"We are very pleased with this DVD purchase.

I have recommended this DVD to several friends.

We love it and have learned a lot about Christmas!",1324684800,,144,4.5
4684747,5,B005FQZMK2,"This movie was really good.  I am a senior citizen, but there were actually things I learned from it.  I recommend this cartoon DVD to children AND PARENTS everywhere.",1324080000,4,167,4.724137931034483
4684748,4,B005FQZMK2,"Phil and the people at Jellyfish Labs want to help us with these questions.  In a fun, musical, puppet-filled DVD, he covers everything from Santa to stockings, Christmas trees and Hanukkah.  He has old carols, new carols, Popsicle-stick theater and my favorite, Missile Toe.  (You'll have to see it to understand.) He doesn't rid us of our North Pole Santa, but does connect him with Saint Nicholas, the historical guy who started it all.

As a seminary trained pastor, I can tell you this stuff is a whole lot more fun and easy to understand than the giant books I went through to get my degree.  It may be light hearted, but it isn't light weight.

If you've wondered about these topics or struggled with how to answer your kids questions, it's a great new Christmas video to check out.",1323993600,39,789,4.6
4684749,5,B005FQZMK2,"This video wasn't just great for the kids...it was great for Mommy!  I knew some of the info from this video but I learned a few things, too.  While my 5 year old watched the whole thing, this video is geared more for elementary age and further.  I plan on showing this to my elementary kids church.  It will add so much more meaning to Christmas traditions and help them to understand the spiritual application behind them.  This video explains the rich Christian heritage that we have incorporated into our Christmas traditions.  Love it!",1323820800,,540,4.691489361702128
4684750,5,B005FQZMK2,"The kids (preschool aged) love it, the parents love it, the research is solid (we were expecting little tidbits that were off-base, but we were wrong) and our family has a new Christmas favorite!  Highly recommend.",1323475200,13,214,4.944444444444445
4684751,5,B005FQZMK2,"I ordered this for my kids thinking it would give them some good background on the Christmas holiday. Not only are they enjoying the information, but they LOVE the DVD and the songs. They quote lines and ask for the movie all the time! I've never been a fan of puppets, or anything resembling them, but this series is really cute! And you can't beat the message.",1323302400,5,362,4.417910447761194
4684752,5,B005FQZMK2,"Joyful and educational addition to this wonderful biblical series. This dvd was so interesting. It shows where many Christmas traditions came from. I especially like the poem by Buck Denver, it is warm and fun at the same time. I highly recommend it!",1321488000,,250,4.837209302325581
4684753,5,B005FQZMK2,"Kids, parents & grandparents will love this.  Great way to start your holiday movie watching tradition...You'll learn why it's called christmas, where the traditional things associated with christmas come in, starting with the name christmas; the tree, St Nick & Santa Clause and much more...",1321315200,17,292,5.488888888888889
4684754,5,B005FQZMK2,"I just received this today and already put it in to watch with my kids. The format is a little different from the ""What's in the Bible?"" series, and the storytelling isn't quite as vivid. My 5- (just shy of 5 year old) son could only watch about half of it, so it might be geared for a slightly older school-aged kid.

Instead of the set of the Buck Denver news show, the video cuts to the different characters as they either prepare for a Christmas party at Buck Denver's cabin in the woods or travel to the party. It's fun to see the characters actually interact with each other a little bit. Basically, as they travel, bake cookies, and decorate, the characters ask questions like, ""Why is it called Christmas?"" or ""Who is Santa Claus anyway?"" Then through stories via the flannelgraph and the popsicle-stick puppet theater, explanations are given.

The video is quite talky, even for this series, hence I think my son will appreciate it more when he is a little older. Part of the issue is, he isn't even that versed in Christmas traditions like Santa Claus, the Christmas tree, etc. We opted to play those things down...but perhaps now that we're better armed with the video and explanations for the traditions, we'll start incorporating them more.

One tidbit that was fun to chew on: Jesus celebrated Hanukkah.",1318896000,46,1317,4.668103448275862

4684765,3,B005FQZMK2,"While the content is excellent and well worth sitting through the entire video, the forced puppet voices are irritating and off-putting.  For that reason my 6- and 10-year-old grandchildren would not watch it.",1481155200,,209,5.333333333333333

In addition to a succinct yet thorough overview of what's in the Bible, it gives kids (and adults!) a context for why and when the books were put together.

The videos do a great job of giving an overview of salvation history and where the different Bible stories fit into it. The songs are catchy. My kids ask to watch the videos (we have 1-6 & 10) so much that my 5 year old can recite the entire 1st video along with the show. I love it because they reference the video in other conversations showing that they are paying attention and learning.

My 3-year-old son was mesmerized by it, cackled at the jokes, and did not want to leave the store before it was over.  I had never heard of the Buck Denver videos, but I purchased it for him and my 5-year-old daughter as a pre-Christmas treat.  They both enjoy it, and my son laughs out loud every single time.  :-) My husband and I actually learned some interesting facts about why we celebrate Christmas and Hanukkah the way we do.

4684812,4,B005FQZMK2,"Over the last year and a half, I've become a fan of Phil Vischer's DVD series What's in the Bible?  Each edition uses puppets to give a broad overview of a section of the Bible.  But for a Christmas special, Phil does something slightly different.  Why Do We Call It Christmas? breaks the formula but is still plenty fun.

This 45 minute video still stars all the same characters.  But instead of the newsroom and their various normal environments, this episode finds newsman Buck Denver in his cabin in Indiana.  He decides to invite all his friends for a Christmas party.  While he, Marci, and Sunday School Lady bake cookies and wait, the others find various modes of transportation to get to the cabin.  Along the way, they start discussing various questions about Christmas like why we call it that, why we bring an evergreen tree into the house and decorate it, why we celebrate on December 25th, and just how Santa Claus fits into the whole thing.  They even discuss Hanukkah and the true story behind it.

The biggest break from the formula is Phil Vischer himself, who only appears at the beginning and end.  Instead, all the time is spent with the various puppets on their various adventures.  I would say this one has more of a ""plot"" than the others, although the heart is still imparting information.  I wouldn't say there was anything here that truly surprised me.  Still, it was interesting to remember where our traditions come from.  Since the audience is mostly American kids and families, those are the traditions discussed, although other countries are mentioned when discussing the origins of some of our traditions.

While this video isn't just a retelling of the Biblical Christmas story, it does include that in the final third.  But it goes beyond Christmas to connect it to Easter and what the birth of Jesus ultimately means for us - forgiveness of sins.  It's a powerful ending to a fun DVD.

And make no mistake about it, this video is filled with the usual fun banter between characters and silliness we've come to expect from the series.  As usual, the songs are hit or miss.  All this and some informative content as well.

Those looking for a way to explain our American Christmas traditions to their kids will be very interested in Why Do We Call It Christmas?  It's an entertaining yet informative way to do just that.",1432425600,,2353,4.699266503667482

4684868,2,B005FQZMK2,"There is interesting information in this video, but it is SO boring.  I was looking forward to this video after seeing it recommended online.  I opened it up right away when it arrived and showed it to my kids.  The first time I tried to watch it with my 4 y/o, we were both excited, but it was so boring, I lost interest quickly and went to do other things, and he gave up watching shortly after.

Later, I decided to try again (maybe I just wasn't in the right mood the first time).  My sister, myself, my mom, and my kids (4 y/o and 16 y/o) all tried to watch it one early evening during a Christmas visit.  We ALL fell asleep.  As soon as I woke up enough to go set my 4 y/o down on the bed, they turned off the video.  No one wanted to watch any more of it.

All the voices sound the same, so it's sometimes hard to tell who is speaking, and there's some odd storyline about a purple monkey from India taking people to a Christmas party or something.  I'm guessing there is supposed to be humor in the video somewhere, but I didn't see it.  I LOVE Veggie Tales, but this video was a big flop for us.

On the plus side, there was some good information about Saint Nicolas, different holiday traditions, and how Christmas got all mashed up with other holidays.  I think the information is interesting.  It just wasn't presented in a memorable or entertaining way.",1419811200,3,1366,4.223938223938224

4684920,5,B005FQZMK2,"I thought this was a cute, fun DVD about the origins of many of the Christmas traditions. It's a well-made and fun romp through the centuries of Christmases past with puppets made for children as well as the child in all of us!

Buck Denver decides to have a party and invites his friends (invitations delivered by flying squirrel) to come to his house for said party. Along the way, each invited guest has question about a Christmas tradition which is answered as the story moves along. Frankly, I learned a lot about the Christian origins of traditions I have always taken for granted.

This is a fun DVD that will obviously play well at Christmas time and obviously be enjoyed most by children. Having said that, I think a lot of older ""children"" will enjoy it as well. This is a fun video, well deserving of five stars.",1418688000,,823,4.516778523489933

The grandchildren have watched these videos over and over, and we have watched the videos along with them.  They remember almost all of the information, plus the the gospel is presented on every DVD.  The videos are very entertaining to children, but as they watch, they're absorbing eternal truths.  The videos are true to the Bible.  I cannot recommend these too highly.",1418688000,,447,4.753246753246753
4684922,5,B005FQZMK2,We love this series. My kids are 9 and they still love it and get a lot out of it. The age is old enough to really understand. I'd say this is the best kid video for middle elementary age for understanding the bible not just stories or morals.,1418688000,,243,3.979591836734694

DVDs from our local library but they did not carry this one.  It's just as well because I see it being one that we watch several times a season for many years to come, especially as our children get older.  I learned some things I did not know from this DVD but it is also presented in a humourous way (without being at all disrespectful) and it is a joy to watch.

(As an aside, this DVD also comes with a coloring sheet of its cover inside, which may not seem like a big deal, but since we have been getting the other DVDs from the library my five year old has never been allowed to use the coloring sheets before (and before you say we could make a copy, the other library coloring sheets have always already been colored in by a previous child) so my son was thrilled to be able to have one to color in himself, despite not really being into coloring books or anything like that anymore.

SPOILER ALERT! Your kids will learn how Santa evolved from a historical figure. They won't learn about the plump guy who goes up and down chimneys.

My bride and I love the video! It's appropriately historically accurate about the history of Christmas, St Nicholas, many of the holiday traditions, as well as the real reason we celebrate...Jesus Christ our savior.

The kids all love it because it's entertaining and interesting too. The puppets are a lot of fun, the singing is a blend of old holiday faves and new, and it weaves a great story together perfectly.

We highly recommend this Phil Vischer creation!",1416787200,,653,4.803571428571429

This is another great DVD for children! This is a fun musical puppet filled DVD!

This DVD is geared more towards slightly older children, however, my youngest loved the music.
I recommend this DVD for your favorite little!  Its a great way to introduce to them the meaning of Christmas.

4684937,5,B005FQZMK2,"I received a copy of the Why Do We Call It Christmas DVD at no cost to me to facilitate my honestreview. Once the DVD started up, I was worried I'd made a horrible mistake by agreeing to watch it, because the little boy puppet character at the beginning of the movie is done with an inanely annoying, squeaky voice. Once the intro is over, the rest of the voices are quite well done and stay well out of the squeaky range. Just get through the first few minutes, and you're home safe.

The inserts inside the DVD case have two copies of the Why Do We Call It Christmas coloring sheet, and you can visit their website to download additional coloring sheets and activities.

The action moves along quite nicely. The volume and pace of the action felt comfortable- it wasn't over stimulating, it wasn't loud, and it didn't drag. The kids loved it. The DVD makes use of a story line to carry the transitions from one segment to the next, and eventually gives the historical context of most of our Christmas traditions. The DVD combines puppetry and animation seamlessly, and the story line is just enough to keep things light and entertaining for the kids. My 3.5 and 7 year olds both enjoyed it.",1416182400,,1192,4.488479262672811

4684940,5,B005FQZMK2,"Yay, Christmas is coming! You have no idea how much I love this season! The lights, the carols, the tree, the time with family, it's all a lot of fun. However, with all of the traditional fun, as my littles gets older, she starts asking a lot more questions as to why we do certain things. And they are all good questions. Some I knew the general idea, but others, I had to go look it up.

I've been eying the Buck Denver series for sometime, so when the chance to review this DVD came up, I thought I would give it ago. I have to say, I'm glad I did. My littles loved this video. There was a good mix of jokes (for adults and kids) with good facts of the origins of the Christmas traditions. I also enjoyed the fact that everything wasn't all puppets. There were some cartoon sections put in for a couple of parts and it help break up the show into smaller sections for kids to understand. The segments offered some good insight into the history of the traditions and showed how everything was morphed into one giant celebration of Christmas from many smaller areas.

The littles and I also watched the extra features. There were some fun sing-a-long songs, a poem of Christmas from Buck Denver that had me crack up a couple of times, and a blooper reel. Some kids can get a glimpse into the making of puppet show that way, which is great.

This was a fun video and the littles has requested to watch again, so it is one I would recommend to anyone.

4684942,5,B005FQZMK2,"From the makers of What's in the Bible and Veggie Tales, Phil Vischer created a unique one of a kind DVD for children that specifically addresses Christmas and its traditions. Buck Denver is sitting alone in his cabin in the woods and wants to know what all those things we do at Christmas mean to signify the celebration of Jesus' birth. He decides he will invite a few friends over to explore what it all means.

Instead of bouncing our kids between ""Jesus Christmas"" and ""Santa Christmas,"" wouldn't it be great if they understood how all these traditions fit together? How they ALL point us to Jesus? We think THAT would be a holiday worth celebrating. Topics of cutting down trees, hanging stockings, Santa Claus, are all discussed from their points of origins to show how each of them points to Jesus Christ and His birthday. You might know the Christmas story, but do you know the story of Christmas? Don't miss he whimsical, educational, Christmical party to end all Christmas parties as Buck Denver Asks...Why Do We Call It Christmas?

Viewers will understand the significance of why we celebrate Christmas on December 25th, the meaning behind the Christmas Tree, St. Nicholas day celebrations, the meaning behind Santa's red suit, where did we get the word Christmas from, what is Hanukkah, and the story of the Upside Down Kingdom. As Buck learns more from his friends as they make their way to his cabin for a Christmas celebration, he begins to understand just how wonderful our Christmas traditions mean and how we can explain them to our friends and family as we celebrate the real meaning behind the season in terms that are easy for kids to understand.

I received Buck Denver Asks...Why Do We Call It Christmas? compliments of JellyTelly and Propeller LLC for my honest review of this DVD. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions contained here are strictly my own. If you love the What's in the Bible Series, then you will want to pick up this special Christmas addition, just in time for the holidays. The DVD is loaded with all kinds of fun extras from a coloring page, a note from Phil, a special question and answer section to help parents further discuss what they learned from the DVD as well as some incredible bonus features on this 60 minute DVD. There was even information I didn't know until I watched this and it is specifically geared to entertain and teach children about all the stuff we celebrate at Christmas time!

It was also ""ADD"" in its script.  Bounced from ridiculous character interaction to another.  It really made me sad to hear the old Veggie Tales voices plugged into these puppets.  I was previewing this with my wife and although she was not tired, made the conscious decision to try and sleep during it.  It pains me to say so but this is so very bad.

This is by no means an evangelical doctrine). His claims to facts are just one of many traditions and stories that can't be proven as the real and only explanation.

The older elementary children enjoyed it a lot but it kind of lost the preschooler--lots of talking, not a lot of action.  I felt like the information presented was very good--lots of facts about the origins of the holiday and celebration of it.  However, we found the portrayal of some of the characters to be somewhat negative and stereotypical--the Italian stick puppeteer, the Indian Monkey, the black man with a white guy doing a ""Fat Albert"" kind of voice.  Some of the weird puppet voices were funny--the man doing the Sunday School Lady's voice and the tedious Pastor Paul and his 1,001 Christmas songs, pirate who sounds like he's from New Jersey.  But with some of the depictions, I thought, ""How did they get away with making this DVD?""  I'm a little embarrassed to recommend it to friends or to let anyone borrow it.  We enjoyed the information, but we'll probably keep it to ourselves.",1355356800,,983,4.747058823529412

There were a few things that left me puzzled and a little disappointed.
1. While the information is excellent, the storytelling and ""acting"" are subpar (compared to VeggieTales).
2. Why was the Indian a monkey?
3. Why did Brother Louie (a black man) get voiced by Phil Vischer (a white man)?
In the end it was a great tool to teach my children.",1355097600,,578,4.611650485436893

4685014,4,B005FQZMK2,"About the DVD

With humor and tact Buck Denver and his puppet pals cover everything from cutting down trees, hanging stockings, Santa Claus and what these have to do with Jesus' birthday.

Plus(es):

Funny - The silly characters appeal to most every child. The silly things the characters say appeal to the child within the parents. This is a children's DVD that even the parents can enjoy.

Informative - I wasn't even aware of the origins of some of our most cherished Christmas traditions. It was fascinating to hear the story behind Christmas as we know it.

Focused - While much ground is covered in the 50+ minute video the host, Phil Vischer, wraps it all up by saying that many of the traditions we hold dear point back to Jesus. They may seem silly when you think about it (hanging socks on a fireplace, putting a giant tree in your living room, etc.) but in some way each tradition tells a part of the Christmas story.

Wish(es):

Maybe more songs- I don't think my 4 year old son enjoyed this Buck Denver video as much as What's in the Bible?: Part 1. It didn't seem to have as many songs, which is what appeals to him the most.

OVERALL:
In the end I recommend this DVD for every family. It will balance out your Christmas DVD collection by doing an excellent job of putting the focus back on Jesus.
