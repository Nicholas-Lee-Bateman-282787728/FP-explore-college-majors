8106921,1,B000E7PLI0,"This company appears to make the worst ""budget"" DVDS (ie: sold in dollar stores) on the market.  I've been burned before but I took a chance since I'm a fan of Richard Greene's and had never seen CAPTAIN SCARLETT.  Well guess what - CAPTAIN SCARLETT is not on this DVD!!! In it's place we have the 1933 version of THE SCARLETT LETTER - with the opening and closing credits missing!!

I flipped it over to check out MUTINY and it is there at least but the print is pretty bad, washed out colors, scratchy, lines, etc.  I will do my best to avoid this company's product in the future - although I don't see the actual company name anywhere on the covers!!  Unless it is ""Family Value Collections"" which is written in a small box on the box.  The DVD covers are similar though for their various titles so they are easy to spot.  I realize you can't expect perfection for a buck but at least you do have a right to expect the movie that is supposed to be on the DVD!!",1142726400,5,963,4.229508196721311
