5577484,5,B00BC75HTE,"""How are you enjoying South By Southwest?""
""It's great. I've seen some great films.""
""What's the best thing you've seen?""
""Upstream Color.""
""Oh. What's that about?""
""...""

I try to tell them that it can't really be explained. I could tell them that the discernible plot centers on a woman taken advantage of by a thief using a hypnotic plant as his weapon of choice, but that barely encapsulates a quarter of the half of the film I actually did understand. And I know most of us hate math.

What I can say with clarity and certainty is that if you enjoyed Primer, you should almost positively love this movie. If you haven't seen Primer, go watch it now and share your experience with the world. If you like the work of Gondry, Kaufman, Malick, Herzog, Cronenberg, Lynch, or Aronofsky then I'd be surprised if you didn't love this one.

At the end of my screening a man stood up and said, ""Loved the film, but I'll be out in the lobby if anyone wants to try to explain it to me."" It's really not that confusing. Don't be scared.",1363996800,43,1028,4.4
5577485,5,B00BC75HTE,"I also saw this premiere at Sundance this year and it struck me as brilliant and confusing and gorgeous and it still is rattling around in my head. The first 30 minutes are breathtaking -- I don't think I blinked once. Can it be described? Not fully. It should be experienced. Let your subconscious and your intuition go with it. I think Carruth did while making it. What I found rather surprising is that the closing credits to the film were only about two screens of names! This is a ""tiny"" film with a big impact.",1362528000,5,516,4.385416666666667
5577486,5,B00BC75HTE,"I had the opportunity to see Upstream Color at the Sundance Film Festival and have become obsessed with seeing it again. Just with his first movie Primer, you get to the end and you immediately want to watch it again.  I highly suggest you watch it without reading anything about it and discover the story on your own. Too many of the critics give plot summaries and insight into the creative direction in their reviews.  This movie is an experience with the cinematography, musical score and acting  I am so happy to know I don't have to wait until the end of the year to see it again, May won't get her fast enough!",1361145600,11,617,4.394736842105263

5577488,5,B00BC75HTE,"This is the most complete story that I have witnessed in film. Shane Carruth understands the minute aspects of life that go unnoticed by many and sees the interconnectedness of everything living and I think that he has a strong grasp of  what goes on behind the veil of human construct. I have seen this movie several times now and am excited to see it again several more. I believe this is the best movie that I have ever seen and ever will see in my lifetime. The reviews declaring that this is not Primer are correct. Where Primer was an entirely different film that appeals to the physicist in us, Upstream Color resonates for the naturalist, the artist, and the human in us all.",1489968000,,683,4.464

5577490,2,B00BC75HTE,"It is not that I did not get it. I did. It is not that I couldn't follow. I could. No one here seems to mention the fact that the farmer was connected to the victims AND the pigs. Also, these events are not directly his fault. I can enjoy a movie written entirely in metaphor. I like poetry where you have to work to find the meaning. One reason I did not like this movie is that the female actor seems stupid. Someone else suggested that the characters were not capable of thought, only reaction. I think that was not the intent and that they were trying to explain away the stupidity of the actors, especially the female. Some people put more into this than there is, such as the commenter who said the cult must be throwing pigs in the stream regularly. Or the commenter who thinks the whole thing is a metaphor for advertisements. Or the commenter who thought the man had an important job. Another reason I did not like this is because it was poorly acted. ESPECIALLY the female lead. The black woman at the end had 10 times the acting ability and she did not have any lines....One last thing....If you do not like abstract metaphorical poetry that uses imagery such as killing baby pigs, you will probably not like this movie, forget the message and the way they deliver it.",1482019200,,1279,4.40084388185654

5577502,3,B00BC75HTE,Very short and to the point this might be the worst movie of all time from an execution standpoint.  Great visually. Lost me completely with a very unconnected story. Maybe my 20 year old self would have liked this movie more.  I've watched Primer 200 times and was not expecting Primer part II however this just did not have any flow.,1454198400,,335,4.475409836065574
5577503,1,B00BC75HTE,"Browsing through Netflix and came across this gem with 4 stars rating. Now I want to be clear that I don't consider myself to be the most intellectual/artistic individual. However, I am definitely a long time cinemaphile. I actually studied film history as an undergraduate, and even took an European Film as English Literature class. I've watched enough movies over such a long time that I actually have a few favorite directors and can definitely recognize their skills and signatures in their work...And have also enjoyed a few more obscure features every so often (Dr. Caligari of the late 80s, Enter the Void...etc.)  After watching the movie in its entirety, I've concluded that it's actually a social irresponsibility to allow such a product to exist. Imagine going through your collection of home videos. Now import about 6 months worth of the clips into your video editor of choice; then randomly cut the video clips into any segments of whatever length...reassemble the clips with carefree abandon...And voila! you have just made yourself a film of similar quality as Upstream Color. Now, the cinematography/imagery is often quite pretty in this movie...Close-ups of various random objects, plants, animals, people's faces, and some clips of the circulatory system a la high school biology videos demonstrating blood flow through a frog's heart...etc....some in slow motion make up the bulk of this movie. It does kind of have a beginning that lasts about 10 minutes or so; and there is also an ending of sorts which is even briefer than the beginning. But the remaining hour or so of the movie, I can assure you, can be reedited by anyone capable of pushing a ""Random"" button, reverse the sequence of shots/scenes, or delete every other shot/scene and the resulting film would essentially be the same...achieving the same effects, eliciting the same moods. Now I can understand and accept that art doesn't necessarily need a purpose. And I can also appreciate that some artists' artistry is presenting common objects viewed from a different perspective that I may not have discovered on my own. However, I do feel that films have a little less leniency on those spectrum. What is also interesting is that this movie doesn't look cheaply made. I mean it's clear that it was made on a small budget; however, someone had to finance the making of the movie. I wonder how he feels about spending his/her money on this endeavor. I'm curious if all of those involved in making of this movie are proud of the finishing product? When family and friends come to the house on holidays or weekends, does Ms. Seimetz say, ""Hey guys, let's watch this movie 'Upstream Color' I made with Carruth..."" Does Mr. Carruth's mom tell her friends, "" Y'all (or you guys) have to see my son's latest movie! You  will LOVE it!"" Does the editor of the movie tell his friends, ""My editing is incredible in this film...""  Socially irresponsible,not  because it's a personal vision, but because it takes away an hour and half of your life that you can never get back. Then again, I've had some fun writing this review. Perhaps this film can inspire many others, to write, whom may have long given up on putting words to their feelings. In that regard, I'm tempted to give this movie a 1.5 stars. But in the end, I suspect many viewers would likely turn off the TV after about 30 or 40 minutes of watching.",1453852800,4,3386,4.832758620689655
5577504,5,B00BC75HTE,"I can't tell you about the philosophical beliefs underpinning this film, or a linear understanding of the plot, but I can tell you that this is a visually stunning movie with great, if underplayed, performances.  Your mind will be challenged, your sensibilities tortured and your sense of place disoriented.  I'm not saying its a mess by any means, you just have to use different ways of interpreting than you would use viewing most movies.  Upstream Colors is unique- it compels you to pay attention, like Memento, and to stretch your definition of reality, like, say, the ending of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  The title of the film is explained, by your brain, not by a character, towards the last scenes. I'd recommend watching it for its strange beauty and psychological challenges. You just might discern some great existential truth.",1452729600,,835,4.985611510791367

this is not primer.  this is not even science fiction.

this is an allegory for substance abuse and the only people who might get into it will be recovering addicts or their loved ones.

as a film, this looks like a college project carruth finally got to finish, so he did.

there is no way to disentangle this effort from his well-known effort, primer, and the immense disappointment when you finally figure out this is a glorified D.A.R.E. propaganda ad will only be amplified if you actually paid money to see this.

we who have been expecting great things from carruth will have to wait.  maybe next time.  maybe not.",1452297600,3,628,4.594594594594595

5577512,4,B00BC75HTE,"Shane Carruth is a technician of film with a vision of telling a story without plot or character. Everything is done through a multi-layered process,where imagery,sound effects, language,nature,biology are the elements that guide the film, not to forget the shaman-like presence of the Thief,who implants a parasitic worm in his victims, so he can groom them to withdraw all their savings while they perform useless tasks; and the Sampler, the priest figure who casts their demons into swine. They provide the motor- mechanism to navigate through the free-associative forms of the two leading players. Kris(Amy Seizmitz) and Jeff(Shane Carruth,writer,actor, director, producer and creator of the soundtrack) are like two elements, damaged by similar experiences of traumatic wounds,coming together into a relationship far from any rom-com. For reasons we can only creatively guess at, Thoreaus Walden, read and transcribed and memorised,is an integral factor in this organic scheme. Theres a memorable sequence where Kris dives in to a swimming pool picking up pieces of rock, and when she surfaces quotes one of the many gnomic lines of philosophical transcendentalism.

The thing you have to accept with the film is that everything, pigs, worms and flowers, as well as normal dialogue is woven into the mesh of the films conceit. Everything, the surface story, is pure metaphor. Consciousness picks its way through the pebbles on the beach, the fragments of sea-wrack scattered on the shore. The players are elements placed into an experiment,seeking answers, exploring the possible future of narrative film. This is American art-house, learning from Cronenburg and Hal Hartley, images are in a stream-of-consciousness format, stealing your money and creeping into your soul, planting existential doubts through lyrical imagery,tactile metaphysics, burning throughout with the characters quest for wholeness. The only criticism is that the connecting scenes are not fully explained or characterisation fully articulated, their dialogue is often muffled beneath the soundtrack, sometimes the editing leaves you perplexed. Amazing that Carruth did cinematography and distribution too. Hollywood give this man a break and a little more money for his next project.",1438819200,,2262,5.633431085043989
5577513,5,B00BC75HTE,Excellent,1430611200,,9,9.0
5577514,5,B00BC75HTE,"The first time I watched this film I just let it wash over me, making no attempt whatsoever to connect any of the dots. I just finished watching the film the second time through and was surprised how quickly an interpretation arose. It definitely draws on other interpretations Ive heard, but also has some ideas which I came to independently.

The first thing to tell you is that, regrettably I think, Ive not yet read all of Thoreaus Walden. But in a course on the history of civil disobedience I took in PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL (I know, right? I went to this sweet Alaska hippie alternative school formed in the 70s before the state was totally overrun by oil industry Repubicans) I did read a lot of the political parts of the work. Basically, Thoreau, back in the dawn of the United States, retreated to the wilderness, led a simple life inspired by his study of various philosophies including Eastern ones such as Confuscianism and (Im guessing) Taoism. He wrote a book about his own philosophy, which had a very Taoist dynamic, mixing passive abstention from modern societal life with an active involvement in civic life. While not a proponent of violence, he did advocate civil disobedience, the intentional violation of the law in order to improve society, thus making himself an essential influence to the three greatest reformers of the 20th century, Gandhi, King & Mandela.

My interpretation is that there is a cult who has taken Thoreaus Walden as a Bible. They engage in all sorts of rituals that, although they have a certain sci-fi quality, rely very little on any technology that wouldnt have been available to Thoreau himself, which is what makes me suspect that the cult is very old and founded by Thoreau himself, who might have discovered the flower and is attendant worm that stand at the heart of the cult.

The ritual is this: at a certain time of year, people dressed as recreational hikers go out and gather a flowering plan whose petals have been imbued with a special color. The chemicals in the color are absorbed into the worms that feed at the plants roots. There is a man whose job it is to harvest the worms, and it is him we see at the beginning and end of the movie. Two worms are put into an alcohol, which is then consumed by two young men who engage in hand-to-hand combat of a sort, but then the rest is administered to unsuspecting strangers.

We see this happen to Krissy (Amy Semitz) who basically falls into a date rape situation, only the rape is spiritual rather than sexual.  She is put into a highly suggestive state and deceived into performing a ritual. I won't describe the fascinating sequence of events that occurs (other critics have provided great interpretations of it) except to say that it involves transcribing Thoreaus Walden, making paper chains, drinking sips of water which she has been made to believe are addictively refreshing, and doing various activities involving alternating the colors red and white or red and black, including poker chips, checkerboard squares and yarn.  She then gives all of salable assets to the cult.

Days later, perhaps when the drug has worn off, she finds herself in dire straits, coming to in the median isle of a busy road.

Without knowing why, she arrives at a trailer and asks a sweater wearing pigherd for help. To the accompaniment of a strange sound played on amplifiers, Pigherd performs a ritual in which, by my assumption, he transfers her sense of herself into a pig. After that she comes to and appears to realize that something strange is happening to her, although she has no memory of her induction into the cults ritual.

The next part of the film has been described as fragmented, and it definitely is in many ways. A lot happens off screen, although not as much as you think, Id argue. The basic plot involves Krissy meeting a man named Jeff (directorwriter Shane Carruth), who, it seems likely, has undergone the exact same ritual at the hands of the cult.

What particularly interests me here is the acting. Theres an odd quality to the two characters dialogues. There is a sense of disconnection, as though the characters are skipping steps in the normal thought process. And this is strengthened by the frequent non-sequiturs that characterize their talk. While its impossible for us viewers to be certain, as we only witness the two characters normal selves briefly at the beginning of the movieit felt to me like both characters never really get out of the altered state the drug put them into.

The sense of fragmentation comes also from the choppy editing. On first viewing, I remembered thinking that the dialogue looked quite extemporaneous, that probably the two actors were mostly improvising their dialog, and that afterward Carruth cut it to just keep the weirdest, quirkiest moments. Now I suspect it was far more scripted than it appears. The thing is, I was making the normal assumption that the more boring, functional parts of conversation were being edited out, as they usually are in well-written movies, in favor of the good-stuff; but actually I think Carruth is trying to show us that the normal, functional stuff never happens between these two. I think that through the whole film they're basically in a unthinking state, speaking without ever formulating words in advance. In a similar way, I think that the nascently established interpretation, that at the end of the movie they realize whats going  and are and decide to take action on it, needs to be fine tuned to the fact that the two characters may not be able to realize or decide anything. They seem to live in a state of Thoreau-like openness to nature that causes them to sense everything things differently, as in what is probably the movies most arresting sequence, in which we focus on the things that the pair of young victims and the Pigherd, who is out in the nature with a microphone, gathering all sorts of simple sounds using simple natural and elemental materials in a way reminiscent of real-life sculptor Andy Goldworthy and also, no to belabor the point to much, of Thoreaus naturalism.

I believe the Pigherds position in the cult is to farm the besould pigs and, at a specified point in the year kill them and drop them into a slow-running stream. The byproducts of their physical decay, including the human soul essence within them, soaks into the roots of the flowering plants to create the color that fed the worms that drugged the victims that paid for the house the cult built.

The entire process seems to have been running cyclically for a long time, but theres a very interesting moment when the pig associated with Krissy, breaks the fence. In a brief dialogue with a man )who seems to be a neighboring farmer and also one of the only characters in the movie not directly effected by the Upstream Color cult) the Pigherd says that this is the first time one of his pigs has ever done something like that.

The crowning jewel in my theory is that the color in the plants is the combined essence of all the souls that have been harvested since Thoreaus time. And I suspect that the first soul to have been harvested was Thoreaus own, that it is his soul that allows the amazing connection with nature the drug and ritual produce, and that it is also his spirit of civil disobedience that, when he realizes through Krissys eyes the cruelty of his legacy, causes her to take the audacious stand she does in the films eminently satisfying and hauntingly beautiful conclusion.",1428969600,,7491,4.733895705521473

I think the hallucinogenic approach to the goings-on left me quite flat, though Amy Seimetz' unflinching performance was nothing short of brilliant.

The Blu-Ray I watched offered no extras or commentary that may have shed light on Shane Carruth's vision or purpose. That was disappointing. Maybe I'm jaded in my old age (65), but I had no end of enjoyment and admiration for ""Cloud Atlas"".

If you're a fan of highly visual (what dialogue there was was mostly inaudible) indie art films that go out of their way to try to make you feel stupid this might be just the ticket for you; otherwise, well, under 5 bucks is not that great a sacrifice just to be able to say you've seen it, I suppose.

Like all Art can be subjective whether the Artist is Crazy, Genius or both. Its all way interesting to ponder the direct meaning of the piece of work, some times A Movie seems less coherent than others, but that's the beauty of the journey, like an interesting puzzle.

Some articulate reviewer said Upstream Colors is about love, not exactly what I took from this Movie. The pigs were kind of distracting for me, just to say visually looking at dirty pigs a lot took me out of Upstream Colors, other interesting visual elements I enjoyed, some may say there is beauty in pigs, I agree, ""when I'm eating bacon in the morning"". So this Movie is a lot more black and white than some may think, whether the unfortunate people who were subject to these parasites develop Synesthesia or Hyperacusis, ""the later seem more likely to me"", bonds every one with that shared experience in Upstream Colors .

This movie seems clear as day to me now, but it was the mental journey to get to this point that was the fun part of Upstream Colors,' like a great puzzle that it is"", just not the best Puzzle I've solved, but a really good one. ""See Upstream Colors if you like a good cerebral experience"".

5577539,1,B00BC75HTE,"Art is so subjective.  I know there are some out there that will swear by this film.  But I can't join them.

There have been some fairly abstract films that I have loved.  I am a huge Kubrick fan.  I love Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of my all time favorite films.  It is difficult to put into words what it is that makes those films great but makes something like Upstream Color nothing more than pretentious drivel.

There are no ""rules"" in art.  You don't have to spoon feed your audience.  You don't have to come out and make your point clearly.  You don't even have to have a point.  A film can just be an experiment in mood or emotion.

Kubrick's abstract films had something to say.  And even though the ideas in those films weren't spelled out for the audience the point was still clear or at least attainable.  You just had to organize your thoughts about it afterwards.

Was this film trying to say that ""stuff is cyclical""?  For me the abstract approach to film making works best when you are trying to express ideas that cannot be expressed in words.  Big ideas.  And then offer some new or interesting insight into those big ideas.  Just observing that ""stuff is cyclical"" and making that point with an hour and a half of weird imagery is not enough (for me at least) to justify the endeavor.  If the filmmaker was trying to make some other point or convey some other idea... well, I am a reasonably intelligent guy but it was just lost on me and others.

Maybe the filmmaker was just making an experiment in mood and just trying to convey a feeling.  If that's the case and you don't have enough melancholy in your life than this is the film for you.

I suspect that the filmmaker probably enjoys that people would spend some of their limited time on this earth talking about his boring, pretentious film.  I don't want to indulge him any further.",1406937600,8,1883,4.406976744186046

-I have observed that people who enjoy the movie understand more about it and those that do not enjoy it feel it wasn't coherent/comprehensible.

-The movie has intense/graphic moments that may be too much for some viewers.

-It is so real.

-It mimics life. It is hard, confusing, painful, and yet full of mundaneness, honesty, and heart.

-Should it be compared to Primer, the first film from this director/writer/actor? Not really. They are different movies and should be appreciated for what each is individually.

-The movie in several words? Brilliant, gripping, captivating. That said, you may have to find your own resolution to the film.

-It will put you in its world. It's believable.

-Replay value? Your mileage may vary. Some movies I love, I can watch over and over. Others I have to be in the proper mood and therefore don't watch them much, even though I feel they are amazing. Upstream Color is in the latter group.

-It is not a movie ""to get"" or ""not get."" Just enjoy it for what it is. Let it speak to you. If it connects, that's cool. If you don't like it, that's cool too.

-While some have said the movie is hard to describe, I would say it's ultimately a love story. Two people who have been through similar traumatic experiences find each other and do life together. Are there other elements? Sure, but they fuel this love story aspect of the film in my opinion.

-The camera, music, and acting all have a part in telling the story.

5577547,5,B00BC75HTE,"Upstream Color is one of those special movies that rarely come along that traverse new territory. Writer/director/actor/producer/cinematographer/composer/camera operator Shane Carruth does an amazing job with this strange, complicated story that conveys a familiar but often not discussed feeling. Its when you sense you're part of a cycle, but you don't know what that cycle is or your role within it. You don't know if you're damaging others or helping them. Carruth shows this feeling through the story, images, and sounds to amazing effect. I cant remember the last time a movie took me to a feeling no other film had touched, at least not as truthfully or deeply.

Additionally, Upstream Color goes somewhere magnificent exploring the idea of power. There are a lot of business movies that cover why American business is the way it is, like Margin Call, Wall Street or The Wolf of Wall Street, but I find that Upstream Color is much more apt in an indirect way. It highlights the way an ecosystem exists, that leads to a highly unusual overarching structure created by singular acts.

This is NOT a film for everyone.

Whole sections of it are without any really intelligible conversation--check that: without conversation that makes sense AT THE TIME. And a lot of it is absent ANY conversation...but it is a movie in which sound plays an active role. It is a movie that takes hold of you like a dream that you remember fully upon awakening, but cannot comprehend. It is a movie that might engrip you, or puzzle you, or even enrage you. But it is a movie truly like no other.

If you have seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primer/dp/B00AR06KN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primer</a>, the debut film of the multi-talented Shane Carruth, that will be a good indication of whether or not you'll like this film. Or if you saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ink/dp/B009DBB8TE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ink</a>, which is by another multi-talented genius named Jamin Winans. Both are further evidence that great works with minimal budgets exist out there--you just have to find them, as you're doing here.

[A NOTE: I personally rankle at the suggestion that this film is suggestive of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tree-Of-Life/dp/B005UKJX4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tree Of Life</a>, which I disliked. And I l LOVED this movie.]

Carruth, who wrote, directed, produced, edited, composed and starred in UPSTREAM COLOR (this title will mean something to you at the end), is an auteur who gives movies like this a great name because, after a little work, his films are understandable. It may take a couple of viewings, but you WILL get his movie, and it WILL make sense. And though you may be totally puzzled by it as you first watch it, when you go over this film with someone else (which makes this a great ""date"" movie) you may find that you really did understand it all along; it was just--as the saying goes--you couldn't see the forest for the trees.

A clue that gives nothing specific away: Carruth himself characterizes the movie as a film about ""cycles,"" about the circular nature of things that happen to us, or the world in general.

Without giving anything important away (and believe me, you'll be glad I'm telling you this much), the movie begins with the machinations of a devious plot to take the life savings from decent people through a drug secreted by, well, worms. As the movie goes on, you'll witness the human toll that plot takes, and the frustration and helplessness it causes. As to what happens when the pigs come in, and the flowers, and the sound effects, and the strange people who meander in and out of the storyline--well, I'll leave that for you to determine. But it WILL be worth it.

The whole thing is up to YOU: do you feel like hanging in there and watching a movie that seems dream-like, where plot is told by through lazily drifting images that meander from point to point while you work to piece together the pieces of a puzzle? It's a wonderfully ingenious movie, and it will leave you with a greater effect than if the movie were more, say, spoon-fed, but isn't that the point of great art films? Believe me, I love those kinds of movies, but it's refreshing to give your brain a workout once in a while.

If you like this movie, see the two movies I've already mentioned: PRIMER, Shane Carruth's earlier masterpiece that is a dizzying, mind-bending tale about the accidental discovery of time travel and the ethical toll it takes; and INK, by Jamin Winans--another creative genius who writes, directs, et al--who delivers a wonderful minimalist parable adventure that is both challenging as well as a lot more ""accessible."" They're both proof that one can create works of genius with small budgets--terrifically watchable stories with real inventiveness and clever cinematography.

This film completely blew me away, and made me reconsider how I think about film. This is perhaps the closest I've seen to a narrative film feeling like a poem. As a followup to Carruth's debut, Primer, Upstream Color continues his focus on the characters' experience of the story, rather than disforming the narrative to lay out the mechanics of the plot in a more traditional manner. At least for me, this results in a wholly immersive experience, very different from most of my other favorite films. The two protagonists have little idea what is going on, and initially we have little more understanding than them; while we glimpse more pieces of the puzzle than they do, we share their experience of epistemological stumbling, constantly recontextualizing past misunderstood experiences.

After watching 'Upstream Color', you might imagine that the film's creator, Mr. Shane Carruth, who was responsible for almost every aspect of the film, is a wide-eyed, creepy guy who resembles an unpleasant, demented version of Doc Brown from 'Back to the Future'. Carruth is far from that as you can get. Watching him on Youtube, during his interview by the Film Society of Lincoln Center, he appears more like a low-key, fraternity pledge at a local college. Carruth recognizes that some of us might regard his second bizarre feature, 'Upstream Color', as both banal and pretentious, but he doesn't care. Publicly he takes the stance of 'to each his own', but beneath the surface, I sensed something a tad bit more arrogant: 'hey, you guys don't really get it!' It would have been nice if a one or two brave, hardy souls had decided to call Carruth out and explicitly criticize him for his self-indulgence, but I can assure you, there were none of those courageous individuals on hand, at the staid Lincoln Center theater.

After polling a number of people who were at the viewing I was at, there seemed to be a consensus that most audience members simply did not understand what was going on. I rushed home and thank God that Wikipedia contained a pretty good synopsis of the Upstream Color plot. I also read a few reviews (mostly positive believe it or not) that painted a clearer picture of Carruth's narrative. Perhaps the best explanation of what the film is about is by one Mach Kobayashi, a young man, who has posted a Youtube video entitled ""Upstream Color Explained (With Stick Puppets!).

Once one finally ends up having an inkling as to what this film is about, then one doesn't simply have to get upset with Carruth and blurt out an uninformed pejorative comment, such as 'this is garbage'. Rather, one can be slightly more circumspect, and point to the overall ludicrousness of Carruth's 'vision' (am I allowed to use such a word in describing Carruth's project here?--I think not!).

Carruth's protagonist is Kris, who falls victim to a narcotics producer (referred to in the credits as 'The Thief). We never see this shady character but do see him preparing a blue liquid, which contains a worm from the larvae found inside the leaves of blue orchid flowers he's been cultivating. He administers this concoction to Kris, who falls into this drug-induced stupor. The Thief distracts Kris by having her transcribe a copy of Thoreau's 'On Walden Pond""; while that's going on, The Thief cleans out her home equity account as well as a rare coin collection. When Kris finally wakes up, she can see a worm crawling inside her stomach and tries to remove it by cutting herself with a knife.

The Thief appears to be working for his boss, 'The Sampler', who, according to Wikipedia, uses low intensity sound (Ifrasonics), to lure Kris and the worm (which is drawn to the sound), to him. According to the erudite Mr. Kobayashi, Kris is 'psychically linked' to 'The Sampler' through her connection to the worm. And after The Sampler removes the worm from Kris, he places the worm inside a pig and all those pigs are psychically linked to the humans, who had the same worm in them, from before.

Jeff, a former stockbroker who was a victim of 'The Sampler' (and spent time in jail for embezzlement through no fault of his own), finds Kris and they immediately bond. Kris and Jeff fall in love but are both troubled by memories of their childhood, undoubtedly connected to their bad experiences, while in the drug-induced stupor as a result of their encounter with the 'The Sampler'.

Carruth's villain appears to have the ability to discern what humans are doing through observing his pigs and when he sees that one of the pigs has given birth, he concludes that Kris will too. So that's why he kills the pig by placing it in a burlap bag and throws it in the river. The trauma to the pig somehow affects Kris as well; a checkup at the hospital reveals she wasn't pregnant, but did have Endometrial cancer, which will probably prevent her from giving birth in the future.

Eventually more bad memories creep into Kris' consciousness (she's extremely disturbed, picking up rocks from the bottom of a pool and reciting lines from Thoreau). But fortunately Kris's references to Thoreau leads Jeff to start writing down his own recollections and before you know it, both Jeff and Kris become more conscious of what happened to them vis--vis The Sampler. Kris in effect beats The Sampler to the punch--she sees who he is but The Sampler is left trying to figure things out from what his pigs are doing. Since Kris figures out who and where he is, she goes and kills The Sampler.

Not quite the end of the story: once The Sampler is dead, Kris and Jeff can liberate the pig farm, send copies of Walden to other victims, who eventually recover their own memories, join Kris and Jeff at the pig farm, celebrate with a pig fest, no longer grow blue orchids with worms in them, thus depriving The Thief of the key ingredient in his blue orchid liquid narcotic.

In the end, what does it all mean? Carruth's Sampler villain is a weak antagonist because we never know what motivates him to do all these evil things. For Carruth, the symbolism is enough: The Sample represents evil in the world and Kris, with the aid of Jeff, eventually liberates herself from being confined against her will. There's also the ludicrous psychic connection between worms, pigs and humans which destroys any semblance of verisimilitude in the film's narrative. Kudos to Carruth for creating this gobbledygook on a shoe-string budget. But again critics be forewarned: more often than not, the emperor has no clothes!",1392076800,10,5732,4.757545271629779

The soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous and is a masterpiece all its own. If I could take my eyes off of the screen for one second I would close them and drown in the music. Even so, the sound of this film is much more than mere music. The sounds of all manner of objects [natural as well as man-made] play a vital role in shaping the film's atmosphere. I don't believe I have ever before beheld the setting of a film giving rise to its own soundtrack right before my eyes! Upstream Color is undoubtedly a work of art, and should be approached that way: pay close attention, but do not expect the underlying significance of everything to be obvious because you have been attentive. The first time you watch it you may not understand it at all. There is nothing wrong with that.

5577569,3,B00BC75HTE,"I don't think I've ever stared at a screen as intently as I did while watching `Upstream Color', and I don't think I've ever felt the need to watch and rewatch a film so quickly as I did with `Upstream Color'.  In fact, I watched the film twice on Saturday and then again last night.  I know that this sounds like the beginning of some hefty praise (look, he loved it so much he watched it three times in two days) and yet after each viewing I was left even more unsure of what I saw, scratching my head at just how empty everything seemed to me despite sporting a premise and an atmosphere that screamed ""I'M DEEP!""

Is it really?

I'm honestly at a loss as to how to go about reviewing a film that I cannot wrap my head around.  It all feels so trivial too, since in retrospect the film seems so simple and so vapid and maybe that's why I cannot fathom how absolutely mundane the whole thing really feels.  It may very well be the most pretentious film I've seen this year.

But that isn't to say that the film is a complete bust, for it isn't.  From a visual standpoint, the film is intoxicating (some of the best cinematography I've seen in any film this year or in the past decade even) and the mix of score and sounds has an alluring intensity that keeps you waiting with baited breath for the answers to be revealed.  I'm just so perplexed as to how those answers are exposed.  There are fewer films that make as little sense as this one, and yet I'm left dumbfounded at the idea that it is all supposed to make sense in the end.

The film's opening, revolving around a hypnosis, injection and complete soul raping is rather entrancing to watch and completely enthralling.  I was hooked and I wanted more.  Sadly, once the abduction is over, the drugs ware off and our protagonist is left to pick up the shattered pieces of her life and memory, the film becomes overwhelmingly underwhelming, if that makes sense.  With that fading memory lodged in the back of her mind, Kris tries to find some sort of closure or at least some sort of normalcy, but when she meets and falls for Jeff she begins to find that an unknown bond is driving them together, and that it is that bond that may completely unravel her.

This should have worked, but Shane Carruth doesn't seem to know how to string his ideas in a logical and coherent order.  He has too many ideas that culminate into one sloppy film that feels like it doesn't have any ideas at all.  The dreamlike presentation mixed with the fragmented vignettes mixed with the intersecting storylines mixed with the flashback scenarios mixed with the multiple dimensions (?) leave everything completely up in the air and deliver a startling finale that fails to make a real impact because it feels almost lazy, as if Carruth came to the end of his screenplay and realized that he didn't tie any of the loose ends together and just decided to put three specific people in the same room and call it a day.

But things like that rarely pay off (they do at times) and here it just adds to the confusion.

I wanted to love this.  Visually, it is striking, but it does NOT deliver on the promise.  In fact, more often than not the film seems more intent on providing us with pretty pictures than a coherent story.  Art house films have the capacity of being something profound and moving, but there are times when the construction of your ideas is so haphazard and so jumbled that they lose all desired impact.  I have not seen `Primer' (although the praise has me intrigued), but this film has me wondering if I should avoid it altogether.

Then I watched Upstream Color and was proven dead wrong.

Essentially at the heart of this film is a great love story; two people brought together in pretty sinister circumstances who fight to rebuild their lives whilst solving a mystery. The concept is brilliant, the dialogue is lean and fits right into the rhythm of the film whilst the music (composed by the director) was fantastic. The first 30 mins-I believe-are deliberately unnerving and totally arrest your emotions as you watch someone have their whole life essentially stolen from them.

While they may have vague recollections regarding anal probes and such, these folks are generally a bit fuzzy on details. In ""Upstream Color"", writer-director-actor Shane Carruth may be offering an explanation. At least that's one explanation that I can offer for this fuzzy cypher of a film.

To say this film is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma is understatement. To say that it redefines the meaning of ""Huh?!"" may be more apt. A woman (Amy Seimitz) is jumped in an alley, tasered and then forced to ingest a creepy-crawly whatsit (all I know is that it appears to be in its larval stage) that puts her into a docile and suggestible state. Her kidnapper however turns out to be not so much Buffalo Bill, but more Terence McKenna (I believe the original working title of this film was ""When Ethnobotanists Attack""!) As he methodically cleans out her financial assets over a period of several days (with her ""willing"" cooperation) while encamped at her house, he next directs her to commit passages of Thoreau's writings to memory (it was either that or waterboarding).

What happens next is...well, what happens next is, erm...OK we'll just say it's the creepy, fuzzily recollected part involving anal probes and such. All I know is that it takes place at a pig farm and fuzzily reminded me of that really creepy part of ""O Lucky Man!"" wherein Malcolm McDowell inadvertently stumbles into a top secret government medical research lab, where he's tortured and then the next thing he knows he's coming to on a gurney next to some poor wretched creature that appears to be half man and half sheep.  Anyhoo, the next thing the woman knows, she's back behind the wheel of her car, parked alongside some cornfield off the interstate, and spends the rest of the movie slowly retrieving memories of her bizarre experience in bits and pieces. Oh, and along the way she meets and falls in love with this sullen dude (played by Carruth) who may have had the same exact experience! Wild and wooly metaphysical/transcendentalist hijinks ensue.

While I will give Carruth some points for originality (the closest I can come to a tagline for this one is ""A Man and a Woman"" meets ""Eraserhead"") and find it admirable that he is making such an earnest effort to be compared to Andrei Tartovsky, unfortunately he's falling short, just this side of a glorified Twilight Zone episode. This seems to be the latest entry in a burgeoning subgenre that I have dubbed ""emo sci-fi"" (alongside the likes of ""Another Earth"" and ""Safety Not Guaranteed"").

 Stanley Kubrick
Upstream uses people, pigs and plants as a struggle to find the logic of a fragmented world. The movie maintains the framework of a story purely as a vessel to explore transcendental ideas. In a larger sense, it effectively conveys the gap between inexpressible emotions and root causes. While the closing moments imply the outline of a conspiracy that explains everything, the revelations only hold together in the moment. This isn't a cerebral film as many describe it. The prospect of nailing down a singular meaning that could resolve each thread in a neat package is a lost cause. It's more of a carefully considered and personal combination of images and sounds. The movie just makes it easy to get swept up in a largely wordless progression of visuals that symbolize its characters coming to understand the world beyond the tunnel vision of everyday problems forced upon them.",1373932800,2,1087,4.875675675675676

""Primer"", the director's first movie was great, so after reading a bunch of Upstream Color reviews I wasn't so sure if I even wanted to. Wired Mag had an interview with the writer/director, so I just had to give it a go. And I am so glad, as the movie surprised me in many ways. I read many reviews (including the hyped review from Wired after the Sundance premier), showing audiences puzzled and asking: what the heck did we just watch? Rumors started on-line that this picture required multiple viewings to find out what the director/writer/producer meant by this movie.

I think y'all are going in way too deep. Shane is a fine writer with a good vision or two on how great movies used to be made. And if I am not mistaken is a David Lynch fan, down to the music, the eeriness, spookiness and general weirdness of the characters, and the sounds are a lot like ""Blue Velvet"" but better. This is, for all its intricacies and esoteric topics basically a very, very simple movie. It is actually a testament to Shane's vision that he can convey simplicity and straight forwardness that eludes most third or fourth time directors. He is a master of Showing, not Telling.

In that context, it is an eloquent ode to love, and trying to make sense of a stolen past. This really is an endearing movie, and not just an exercise in atmosphere or an artsy fartsy indie flick. Again, it is about love, including love of nature. The main characters have both undergone a zombie-like experience in which they were robbed of their identities and lives. Now, they have developed synesthesia, a neurological condition usually present at birth. On top of that, somewhere on a field nearby, pigs roam, pigs that are now hosts to the worm that previously inhabited their own bodies and brains. And they have become hypersensitized to each others' and the baby pigs' suffering.

I see nothing abnormal in the movie; even the long worm in the film is akin to Dracunculus medinensis and is prevalent in at least 20 African countries, aka Guinea Worm Disease. I had just watched The Bay (don't, it's awful, but it did have scientists and others suffering from isopods) while this movie featured similar, smaller insects when the baddies are still larvae. Further, the Walden references did not bother me that much, for this movie it was appropriate to have a coherent glue that kept this story going forward. This was an engaging movie, and eerily creepy, with enough suspense and good dialogue to keep me fully engaged for the entire duration.

A couple of things fell short of my expectations; I did not understand the African American boy/character with the 1970's glasses except to have a kind of innocent introduction into the evils of the worm as a powder, or perhaps a voodoo reference. I also am not a 100% convinced that the Writer/Director should also be the lead actor, although the woman lead was fabulous, and I hope to see her in more movie roles. Lastly, the Photography and Sound was fabulous, which is an art and not easy to come by these days. My overall theory on the general body of work from this Writer/Director/Actor is that he may have  Aspergers, and I actually appreciate that. The result is an extremely well researched and well done movie including a plausible neurological and biological angle.

So for all the professional reviewers who did not get it and ""have to watch it a bunch of times"", why didn't you? This is, although extremely well done, not exactly Calc Based Physics Two, or Intro to Probability, or even Molecular Biology!

5577597,5,B00BC75HTE,"Nine years after his mind-bending debut feature Primer, Shane Carruth has put out his magnificent sophomore venture, the curiously titled Upstream Color. Featuring sparse dialogue and a beautifully exotic score, Carruth's latest film is at times confusing, metaphorical, and ultimately magnificent. Despite its 93-minute running time the film feels like an epic, and has qualities not unlike that of Terrence Malick's own sprawling metaphorical epic Tree of Life from 2011. Unlike Tree of Life, this film feels more concise, more calculated. Carruth showed us with Primer that he has the wits to make us scratch our heads, though here his motive seems to be not to confuse the audience but rather to explain partly what's going on in the plot and also what's going on in the minds of its central characters, portrayed by Amy Seimetz and Carruth himself.
Other than the format of the film that Shane Carruth has crafted, the best things about this movie are the sound design and the picture. Written and performed by Carruth, the film's score is possibly the most creative use of music I've seen in films in the past decade, and the sound design matches it so well you have to wonder if Carruth won't receive a few Oscar nods. The cinematography is much clearer and colorful than Primer, and may make the film one of the best looking to this point. Also, it's a bit less confusing than Primer, though it still may take you a few viewings to totally understand what's going on.
Overall, Upstream Color is an emotional and technical masterpiece, with its director focusing not merely on the mechanics of the ""drug"" shown in the film, but its effects on the characters that are under its influence.

I recommend Upstream to anyone wishing to see a film that does not seek to explain everything and trusts it's audience to form its own understanding.  Its appreciation grows with revisiting.

DVD/BLU:  My only detraction of the DVD/RAY is that there is only trailers as supplement/special features.  That being said, Carruth has said that he did not wish to have special features because he felt it to be a marketing ploy.

If you enjoy this film, Amy Seimetz has created a film of her own ""Sun Don't Shine"" (without a distributor currently) that Carruth said impressed him into deciding Seimetz for the role of Chris in Upstream.

5577601,4,B00BC75HTE,"Ever wonder why you've done inexplicable, out of character, things that you don't remember very well? It's because someone fed you a worm with telepathic effects, and these effects allowed you to be hypnotized, and that bad person made you give him all your money. Afterwards, you eat and drink which forces the worm to start trying to escape. That it does with the aid of a pig farmer/new age techno music dude (solo magnate of Quinoa Record Company) who hooks you up to a pig into which the worm transfers, while a psychic connection remains between you and pig, so the farmer/musician can tap into your life by visiting with the pig and make music with sounds inspired by your life (that the pig is privy to). The pigs give birth and the farmer kills the piglets by dumping them into a stream into which the worm is released and enters back into the orchids from which the bad people harvest the worm to give to you/us. Certainly is a reasonable alternative to karma, the unconsciousness, messed-up parents, bad genes, and so forth. While the premise is absolutely ridiculous, I can see the allure of taking such a stance, since it may, in Carruth's mind, make as much sense as any other alternative. Think you're pregnant but you're not? It's because your pig is with child. Why are you attracted to someone and not someone else? Your pigs have a thing for each other. Carruth's script and characters are oddly convincing and endearing. Once the story line becomes clear and you realize the absolutely outlandish, arbitrary, and para-cynical nature of the plot, you can either enjoy the aesthetics and continue empathizing with these unfortunate characters' lives or stay confused and hope for the best.",1372118400,2,1707,4.7898305084745765

Artsy yes, but the story is one that requires full attention to understand correctly. I had to view it a second time to understand the full story correctly. I compare Mr. Carruth to Darron Aronofsky in a way. Especially with his and Aronofsky's first feature films. I will not tell about the story but that it is astounding in many ways.

5577606,2,B00BC75HTE,"Upstream Color....how do I explain it?  Well, I can't.  The first 20 minutes I was hooked!  I really enjoyed ""Primer"", and was really excited about this movie.  And like I said, the first 20 minutes was fantastic.  Then...this extremely interesting movie...climbed to the top of the ""artistic film"" tree, jumped, and hit every branch on the way down.  It was painful to watch.  I found myself  watching it at 2x speed just to get through it.

Now, I like to consider myself well educated, open minded, and smarter than the average bear.  But, for the life of me, I can not understand all the high praise of this movie.  It is my opinion, that these positive reviews are from people who want to seem enlightened, artistic, or just want you to think that they are brighter than you, because they ""got it"" and you didn't.  Aspiring film critics, who want to prove their opinions on movies have merrit.

Well, there was really nothing to get.  It's not like I didn't ""get"" what the movie was about, it's just that I didn't care.  Pigs, invisible men with sound equptment, swimming pools with rocks?  It was like watching ""Memento"" ( an outstanding movie btw) but watching it in a language you don't understand, and every 10 minutes, someone runs in and kicks you in the balls until it ends.

I guess the main bullet point of this review/rant is this....the baby pig is the woman's baby she never had...Last scene of the movie.  There, I spoiled it.  Now you don't have to watch it...you will thank me for it!  Or did I spoil it?  Was the pig her baby?  Was she dead, and now she is the pig?

5577607,4,B00BC75HTE,"This is a real mind-bender of a flick. I liked it a lot but I can't say I understood what was happening here. I got some of it but I have a lot of questions.

Here's the scoop. Kris (Amy Seimetz) is being conned through a combination of hypnosis and chemical (otherworldly?) infestation. She's wiped out financially and the time taken to pull this off has cost her her job. She meets a guy, Jeff (director Shane Carruth) who lost his job because he's a trader who's embezzled from his employer. Did he do this wittingly or was he under the same con as Kris? They hook up and try to make sense of what has happened to them while another man, ""The Sampler"" records sounds and does experiments on pigs.

As others have said, the first 30 minutes of this is brilliant. Watching the con take shape and seeing Kris, in disbelief, trying to figure out how she lost all her money, is as good as anything of this type that has ever been done. After that it's a slippery road. I really watched this, because of what other viewers said, and tried to gather all the clues. There were many but they were subtle and I just couldn't connect the dots. The water imagery, the hand gestures, the pigs, Walden, Kris and Jeff not knowing which memories are actually their own or maybe transferred one from the other. Is this, as it appears, an alien plant invasion? There seemed to be some references to ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" These bits and pieces all hang together in a very loose fashion.

I saw writer/director Shane Carruth's first effort ""Primer"" and it was an amazing exercise in how much can be done with a meager budget. Here he has a few more dollars and they're used well. Though not flashy direction the camera movement and framing is excellent. He also did the sound design and I loved it. It floats over everything and lends great mood to the proceedings. He is on a different plane than the typical film maker and I hope he is able to keep at it. I also might need to see this one again to see if things get any clearer on a second viewing, but, for the adventurous film watcher this is a real feast.",1371081600,,2106,4.36734693877551

5577611,2,B00BC75HTE,"So I only had about 23 minutes left to the end of this movie when I turned it off, went online, and started reading what it was about. And the more I read, the lower my opinion of the movie became.

I didn't know anything about ""Primer"" before I watched it the first time, and yeah, I did go and read about it afterwards to figure out more of what happened in it. Yet the thing that ""Primer"" has that ""Upstream Color"" is really lacking is dramatic tension. Tension in ""Primer"" is surprisingly vibrant, from the two guys trying to figure out the project, to them lying to their associate, to them lying to their family, to them eventually lying not only to each other, but to themselves. And in ""Primer"", their motivations were always there: they wanted to build a machine; they accidentally built something else and wanted to put it to monetary use; they became greedy, and wanted to manipulate each other.

""Upstream Color"" has none of this. ""Upstream Color"" is Carruth taking what he got the most praise for in ""Primer"", and turning it up several notches. Too much of anything though is poisonous, and Carruth's newest movie suffers from a healthy dose of toxin.

In comment reviews, people have attempted to explain what the movie is about, and that's cool. But to say ""Upstream Color"" isn't for everyone is an understatement. This movie is for a very small slice of the population who likes arthouse movies. To portray it as anything else is a flat out lie, and that's what I think is most depressing about it. ""Primer"" was a very unique, original movie that also managed to be inclusive, something I think Carruth didn't intend. ""Upstream Color"" is exclusive. Not only is Carruth not interested in people liking his movie, but I think, for him, the more people who don't ""get it"", the better he feels the movie is. And those types of artists are pretty annoying.",1370736000,5,1867,4.617469879518072

5577618,5,B00BC75HTE,"Because he is writer, producer, director, editor and composer for both this film and his previous film, Primer, Shane Carruth clearly allows nothing to influence his singular vision for his work. The creative input, as is obvious from the amazingly small production crew (many with the last name Carruth), is focused distinctly on the film Shane Carruth wants the viewer to experience.

After success with Primer, Carruth could have easily moved into the rarefied air of Hollywood directors with low budget early film masterpieces like David Lynch and Terry Gilliam. These directors are able to ""mostly"" realize their visions on film but need to do so within the constraints of somebody else's budget and priorities. One only need to see production notes on Lynch's Dune for the perfect example of how Lynch had to alter his story to the realities of studio practices and expectations. Gilliam's battles during the production of Brazil are the stuff of cinema legend.

Instead, along comes a film like Upstream Color. Only Carruth's second film in almost 10 years, it presents another complex, deliberately paced, beautifully shot and precisely crafted puzzle for the viewer to unravel. The film is a meditation on the connectedness of living things. It is both terrifying and heartbreaking. It is the cinematic version of Edward Hopper's ""Nighthawks"" if it had been painted by the insane Dr. Caligari.

Like Primer it is mostly a film experience, designed to arouse emotion and curiosity but stubbornly defying explanation after a first viewing. His films demand at least a second (or more) viewing, but unlike many filmmakers to whom Carruth is compared he will not cheat the careful viewer of any secrets or introduce ""Deus Ex Machina"" devices or happy endings just to satisfy the majority of viewers.

Most will not give either of his films the time they deserve, but for those who do, Carruth supplies all the answers. Nothing is left out; a bold promise for a filmmaker. It is up to the viewer using the visual, auditory and emotional cues provided to work out the puzzle Carruth lays before them (or at least check out the internet for what others think they have figured out).

Upstream Color is not as intricately woven or as multi-layered as Primer. This film is far more linear with many of the major plot points easily followed but not necessarily understood. However, the film unrolls in so many unexpected ways that a second viewing and a little imagination will catch most of the film's plot intricacies.

The puzzle this time is not in solving the complexity of a non-linear story (like Primer) but in what the film is trying to communicate about the nature of life itself. Most people assemble a jigsaw puzzle by first identifying the outside frame pieces. Good, evil, wealth, poverty, love, hate, despair, loneliness and fear are a few of the pieces which must be assembled to form the frame of this puzzle. It is the human relationships which must be put into place in the center to begin to fully appreciate this film.

But where has Carruth been for all these years? Why has he not pumped out more films in his unique and mind-bending style? Surely after a big splash at Sundance with Primer, Hollywood would come calling to make ""Primer 2"" or have him direct the next Batman movie. What is happening with this guy?

Who cares? It might be interesting knowledge but it's not relevant to the film.

We can only judge Carruth on his film output and clearly, from the lack of much biographical information about him, that is exactly what he expects of us. This is a harsh and dangerous thing for a filmmaker to do because if we don't like his film, we can't balance it against who he is dating, his advocacy to save baby rainforests or the fact Tarantino loves him. I believe Carruth is one of an extremely rare few of notable filmmakers who will not allow the process, limitations, and all the related nonsense applied to nearly every film made for mass distribution to affect the unfiltered story he wants to tell.

Why does it take Carruth nearly 10 years to produce a second film? I prefer to think he was deliberate in crafting the intricate script, preparing it for efficient production and securing no-strings-attached funding allowing him to control every single aspect of it before a single frame is shot. The small production team he has surrounded himself with completely buys into his vision. Even his individual locations are credited demonstrating their willingness to comply.

It is clear from his spartan style there is little of the film Carruth wanted to make left on the cutting room floor. This controlled, cost effective production method along with a masterful sense of both the use and importance of the tools available to a filmmaker in the first and second decade of the 21st century grants him complete freedom to tell exactly the story he wants to tell without anybody telling him it won't play unless he adds a few more jokes.

With Upstream Color Shane Carruth establishes himself as an auteur in every conceivable sense of the word as it applies to filmmakers, and in many ways, he is redefining it for the new millennium. Truly wonderful technology may make this a new Golden Age for visionary filmmakers to break out of the oppressive shackles of the Hollywood glop factory just as the stranglehold record companies had on what we listened to has been completely destroyed.

What if we have to wait 10 more years for another Carruth film? I'm OK with it as long as the film is as honest and clever as his first two have been. Carruth has been compared to David Lynch, by myself and others, but I think a more accurate comparison is to visionaries like Jaques Tati, Orson Welles, Tom Waits. These artists refuse to compromise their work to the limited expectations of an uncaring audience. They are an anathema to those who create art only for profit or produce films for the dumbest common denominator.",1370131200,,5952,4.823529411764706

5577642,5,B00BC75HTE,"Its hard to write a review for movies like this because, unlike most films, it does not force feed you the story or treat you like you are need to have your hand held to ""get it"". Shane Carruth's second released film, after the excellent Primer, is a love story, a tragedy, a beautiful audio and visual experience, and it asks questions instead of telling you your own answers up front. I will have to watch this movie a few times more (which I rarely do with films as so few are worth more than a first or second glance) before I can fully conclude how my viewer empathy and interaction (or reaction) to this masterpiece is. I will say to anyone reading this... if you like movies as an art form then this movie is for you. If you liked Shane Carruth's first film Primer then you should definitely watch this film. It will make you think and you will walk away wanting to see it again.

The Blu Ray pack I bought on Amazon came with the usual Amazon speed and quality packing. The disks inside were secure and the Blu Ray packaging was in no way damaged or flawed.

The Blu Ray version of the film had no issues. First playing was done in a Playstation 3 Blu Ray drive. There were no audio issues that I experienced. The video and soundscape quality are top of the line and better than some blu ray disks that have come out. Crisp clear picture, blacks were black, colors vibrant (as is the intention), and the audio on my Onkyo 7.2 surround system was atmospheric. Basically on the blu ray, enjoy the show. If you did have issues you may be able to replace your disk if there were fabrication issues. I would think amazon would trade in for a new copy or even Shane Carruth possibly.

I hope this review helped a little bit if some of you are on the fence with this. I will be watching this again a few more times and its time to watch Primer again.",1368489600,6,1851,4.252840909090909

5577645,4,B00BC75HTE,"NOTE:  The Blu ray/DVD combo package I bought (Best Buy) has voice synchronization issues on the Blu ray version I watched.  I will be returning for a new copy.  So be cautious.  Here is a review of the film:

After watching Shane Carruth's first film ""Primer"" (2004), I noted in my review, ""I'm not exactly sure what I just watched...""  Well that's pretty much my feeling here as well.  Once again Carruth upends the filmmaking applecart by controlling everything in the movie as director, writer, producer, editor, actor, photography, distribution and he even scored the movie.  For someone new to Carruth, my advice is to push the button that turns off your rational thought.  If you think you have Carruth figured out here, you are either fooling yourself or live in the same weird creative planet that he does.

The first act, actually makes some sense.  A young business woman, Kris (Amy Seimetz) is kidnapped by a man known as Thief (Thiago Martins).  He has forced her to ingest a single grub/mealworm that lives near streams and somehow manages to turn certain flowers blue.  The flowers are transplanted and sold, worms intact.  After Kris swallows the worm she becomes hypnotized and is under the control of Thief.  She spends her time memorizing Thoreau's ""Walden"" by handwriting the book word for word and creating chain-links made of the pages.  She cleans out her bank accounts, takes advances on her home's equity and turns over a valuable coin collection to Thief.

Once Thief is gone, Kris is really screwed up.  The worm has grown and moves throughout her body.  She tries to remove it by cutting her arms and legs.  Unsuccessful, she is drawn to a remote farm where a man known as The Sampler (Andrew Sensenig) manages to extricate the worm by coaxing it to an anesthetized pig.  The Sampler is a pig farmer in addition to his other job of recording various sounds coming from nature.  Still with me?

Kris, despondent and broke meets Jeff (Carruth) on a commuter train.  They have coffee, they see each other more often and eventually fall for each other.  But something isn't right.  Jeff himself has issues but tries to coax Kris out of her depression.  The film continues to flow, often with the characters in a dream-like state.  You're never quite sure if you are in real time or a dream.  You're never quite sure if you are seeing Kris' vision or Jeff's or both.  Or are you seeing The Sampler or hell, even the swine?  What is the connection to Thoreau?  Is that just a red herring or a Mcguffin as Hitchcock used to call it?

Shane Carruth is without question a talented filmmaker.  His technical abilities seem to be without question.  The movie is shot beautifully, has great color with first rate editing, all on a miniscule budget.  Amy Seimetz is excellent in her role as poor Kris.  But this isn't a movie for everyone and I suspect Carruth likes it that way.  I'll keep watching him.  Maybe I'll start to put the puzzle pieces together over time.  I just hope I don't have to wait 8 years between films.

I wonder if Carruth is responsible for the audio transfer issues.  If so, maybe that should be left to others.",1368489600,,3151,4.664845173041894

Doing anything to animals in a movie except loving them--simulated or not--is completely unacceptable.

5577661,5,B00BC75HTE,"I've changed my review, because I think this is a great film, not a good one, nor a weird one (even though its surface is undeniably strange).

I'd like you to know why I think that's so, in the hope that you'll take it seriously while you watch, then watch it again, then tell others to do so.

The way into this film is to think of what you're seeing in terms of metaphor. If you start with that--the idea that the objects, actors, and scenes all represent something beyond themselves--the film isn't hard to follow.

If you start with plot--as you have been taught to do in American film since Jaws--you're lost. The progression is jarring, sometimes even disjointed, there's very little dialogue, and no character is going to suddenly appear and spell out everything for you.

But that's why you're reading this, so I'll play that character...

In a wild, impossible premise, the identities of the two protagonists, a man and woman, are removed from their bodies and surgically transferred to pigs.

This doesn't happen, however, until a botanist subdues and brainwashes both. We see only the woman's case, but can infer the other has gone through the same process, because both show a familiarity not only with the same memories, but also with phrases from Thoreau's Walden, as well as a propensity to repeat the mindless, repetitive gestures of taking pieces of paper and manipulating them into shapes.

The woman makes a paper chain out of folded sheets on which she has transcribed pages of Walden without thinking about them, and the man works with the paper casings of thousands of straws.

So that's the surface of the premise.

Let's look at a few other surfaces.

We first see the woman in a cubicle job, overseeing the editing of a brief sequence of a film that features lots of CGI work: a bleak landscape through which a scifi robot walks on four artificial limbs, like a quadripedal animal, except the environment is so artificial that none of it exists or has any link to reality. There's an error in the sequence: a trace of a human foot or hand, maybe from a gaffer, that ruins the illusion. The woman says something to the effect that if she can see it, someone else will. She then goes about the process of hiring the second choice for editor, lying casually over the phone (we love your work...sorry we've taken so long getting back to you).

During her brainwashing, she is told that water will stand in for food, and she will be satisfied with small doses of it while craving more--a nonsensical bit of reasoning borrowed from junkiedom.

She is told that she cannot directly behold the face of the individual telling her what to do, because he is made of the same material as the sun. A nonsensical bit of reasoning that smacks of religious insistence on the acceptance of non-facts. Or perhaps advertising; you see and hear actors, not the writers of the pitch nor the clients. The larger point is that he's lying. He's just a person, manipulating a situation.

To earn a few chips from a checker board, which allow her to ""buy"" sips of water, she is instructed to transcribe Walden word for word on blank sheets of paper which she must then fold, glue and form into a chain, which is later discarded by the brainwashing botanist.

Paperwork.

Literally.

A paper trail that soon vanishes; the brainwasher cleans up after cleaning her out, leaving with the (strange) evidence, and ending her trance with the phrase ""the wall has crumbled...fallen down.""

She loses her job, her savings, and likely her credit as well. All as a result of losing her identity.

Okay...another way of looking at this:

What was her identity to begin with?

Her job? Not editing, not filming, not color timing, but rather supervising the editing of someone else's film, which depicts a scene so artificial it can't exist. Nothing direct, three-dimensional, tactile or real.

She's supervising--a signal of higher pay in cubicle world. With the implication that it takes all her time. Her identity likely IS her job. A couple of lines to dash off after naming the company at a cocktail party.

What was her credibility? Her success, her credit rating, the credibility of her company.

All gone. Quickly.

Like being told water is a substitute for food, and being made to believe that transcribing someone else's information and reshaping it on paper is essential, time-consuming, all-encompassing work.

What's her next job?

Working at a signage company, this time as labor. Making signs she doesn't care about or understand.

Once again, perfectly in line with the messages and tactics of her brainwashing. It's more meaningless work, this time for subsistence. At best.

And now we meet the man. Already brainwashed. What was he before? A financier. Another manipulator of information several levels removed from making or doing anything tactile, three-dimensional or real.

Where is he now? Like her, vaguely in the same field, now lower down. He's discredited, off the books, unacknowledged and removed.

They're drawn to each other and don't know why. Like so many attractions.

They discover their memories are identical.

An exaggeration in the film drawn from the premise, but how different is that from people whose identities are essentially their jobs? How many dates are happening right now where both parties say something is amazing that isn't, shortly before discussing their like of all kinds of music, movies, and travel?

How does the film turn around?

The woman suffers a psychological break from the horror of being utterly lost, and finally tries something desperate, strange and (most important) unique: she creates a physical association with the words that were brainwashed into her by diving for stones she drops in a pool, then retrieving them one at a time, assigning each a phrase from Walden that suddenly means something to her.

Actions tied to words tied to ideas. Something tactile, three-dimensional. Real.

And she's literally beneath the surface finding these revelations, slowly bringing them to light. And the man recognizes the words as well, and their power; the implication is he was brainwashed with the same book. A guess that's reinforced by an early scene, with the brainwasher working on his plants while a record plays. An album of Walden being read aloud.

What is Walden about? Going one's own way. Finding one's own identity. Reconsidering and frequently rejecting what you've been told to accept by the social order, for the purpose of discovering the self.

How does the film end? The couple pieces together what happened to them, and the man and woman devote their lives to tending to the pigs--pack animals--who possess their true identities. A literal way of showing them taking care of themselves, taking themselves seriously simply as beings for the first time.

They inform other victims, who join them in this activity. As Thoreau has been asking you to join him by repeating his exploration of self discovery.

Because there's color upstream, waiting to be reclaimed and brought down to where you are.

Ask yourself now who the botanist/brainwasher is. Perhaps a stand-in for the goods you've been sold. The social messages you take as facts of life.

Ask yourself who the farmer is. And why he's killed. Perhaps a stand-in for a flawed god. Look how downscale his equipment is. Despite some startling successes--the ability to transfer consciousness between beings, and the stunning sympatico between strangers exposed to the same experiments, even he recognizes that his attempts have limits, and ultimately don't work the way he'd intended.

Then again, the botanist and farmer are both scientists; you can make a genetic argument here as well. Advertising, religion, bioengineering, social conventions, pharmacology, chemical changes through botany--in 2013, we're tinkering not only with psychology, but also physiology, brain chemistry, even DNA.

The larger point remains: conmen, gods or scientists, they take us far from who we really are.

In the end, how do they fail? There's an error in the sequence. A trace of humanity remains, ruining the illusion. If you notice, someone else will too. A man on a train noticing a woman. A person watching a film.

Great movie. Watch it again.",1367107200,36,8260,4.948587979724837
5577662,5,B00BC75HTE,"This is at the same time a mindbending science-fiction puzzle movie like Donnie Darko, The Prestige, or Carruth's first film, Primer, and a ravishing extreme arthouse movie full of evocative images and juxtapositions, and set to a mesmerizing score (by Carruth himself, who composed as he wrote the screenplay). In other words, Carruth has taken the genre of film that is most plot-driven (all of these movies need to be seen several times to be fully understood) and done it in the style of the genre that is usually closest to plotless! What he's divined is that the arthouse style is the most effective way of delivering the clues to the story. While other puzzle movies need to be solved before they deliver their emotional payoff, this one connects at a deep level on the first viewing, while you're only getting perhaps 70% of what's going on (easily pushed to 80% after you leave the theater and think and talk a bit about it) -- it helps that this is essentially a romance that will remind some viewers of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and/or The Fountain. After seeing it twice, I've pushed my comprehension up to (I think) 90%, but I'm convinced that it's laden with clues that point to relatively unambiguous answers to my remaining questions. And I expect those answers will further deepen the story emotionally.

Thematically, this is a meditation on a whole raft of important issues including the nature of identity, our relationship to the natural world, and (my take) the tension between free will and communal behavior. Unlike its predecessors in the mindbending sf genre, it will invite reams of discussion as to its ultimate meaning (in the philosophical sense). It is, very simply, a work of art.

Any fan of the movies I've mentioned will like this unless they have a real aversion to the arthouse style -- e.g., they hated The Tree of Life. And anyone who liked or loved The Tree of Life will like this, even if they find themselves indifferent to solving all of its mysteries. If, like me, you adore mindbending sf movies and love the arthouse style, you may well find this to be one of the ten best movies ever made. Easily.

There, it's clear that some logic, consistent within itself but inscrutable from outside, drives events. There's something of the same sense here, but the presence of that unreadable logic comes through less strongly.

Then, there are the visual icons: maggots, pigs, the sound collector, again with some obvious but illegible relationships between them. And Thoreau, and ... well, a lot. And don't forget Amy Seimetz - an incredibly lovely woman, in a role that projects vulnerability bordering on despair, but clinging to that last bit of strength.

There's no easy way to sum this movie up. In fact, I haven't wrapped my mind around all the parts yet, and am not sure I could - at least, not the same way twice. Thoughtful, surreal, and tantalizing but, in my reading, lacking that something that would have given the plot the sense of a coherent core.

I loved all the avante guard films like bracghage and mekas. this is crap. neither art nor poetry. neither something to lift you up or to provide something transcendant or meaningful. read the other reviews when I stopped watching to see what it is I got myself into. I don't want to watch this 3 times to figure out what obscure meaning the director of this meant to communicate. If you want to think about futility go see waiting for godot. how many times do you need to be hit over the head with nothingness. leave me out. I am going to go contemplate the Mona Lisa.",1518912000,,661,4.253968253968254

8565867,4,B00BC75HTE,"Upstream Color, Shane Carruths sophomore movie, is more coherent than Primer, and bolstered by a captivating performance by Amy Seimetz in the lead role. Carruth is a talented visual storyteller with a gifted imagination, but both his movies have ended unsatisfyingly, in my opinion. Upstream Colors fantastical plot doesnt have the payoff I would like, but Id willingly watch the movie again to be immersed in its visuals and sound design. The power of the movie is how it flows on the emotions of its lead characters, inextricably linked to a parasite that is used to take advantage of them financially. This emotion is conveyed by immersive images and sounds. The editing is super tight, daring you to look away or let your mind wander for even a second. At barely 90 minutes long, a lingering camera eye could have pushed this feature well over 2 hours.",1514246400,,857,4.836734693877551

If you want to watch some empty, post-modern drivel with terrible acting, this is the movie for you.",1513036800,,165,4.689655172413793
8565869,1,B00BC75HTE,I had to watch this for class and am now considering changing my major to accounting because nothing can be as boring as this movie.,1507766400,,132,4.32
8565870,1,B00BC75HTE,"I watched this last night and am now in a bad mood that will only be assuaged by writing my one-star review of this pretentious, self-indulgent ripoff of a film. I did enjoy Carruth's other film, ""Primer,"" although it was more of an interesting movie than a great one. However, compared to ""Upstream Color,"" which was alternately soporific, disgusting and mystifying, ""Primer"" is a masterpiece. I'll spend just enough time on this review to hopefully convince you, the curious customer who might be inclined to click ""buy,"" that ""Upstream Color"" really is that bad. Think twice before you put its repulsive images into your eyeballs, because you will have a hard time erasing them ever.

I'm not a fan of music in movies in general, because I'm a musician and I resent the obvious manipulation of my emotions that a soundtrack induces. Maybe on non-musicians, soundtracks work subliminally and hence effectively, but for me it's as if someone is holding up a sign that says ""FEEL SAD NOW"" or ""GET READY, SCARY STUFF COMING"" or ""THE AWE-INSPIRING GOLDEN MOMENT IS UPON US."" In ""Upstream Color,"" there is so little in the way of dialog, energy, momentum, feeling or plot, that the obnoxious, relentless soundtrack has to take on the jobs that we usually expect the script and the actors to handle. If we were forced to watch this film in silence, we'd have no idea how to feel, as the actors wander around like zombies. In terms of production values, I had the volume cranked up as loud as it would go and still the dialog, what there was of it, was muffled. Well, in fairness, it was competing most of the time with the bloated soundtrack, so what did I expect?

Mr. Carruth, who wrote, directed, starred and even composed the score, is obviously a savant, or at least a very ambitious person with a great work ethic and a talent for getting things done. This makes me admire him, in a way, because I believe that any creative person who goes out on a limb can be forgiven for failing in an honest attempt to do something original and profound. This may be the case with Mr. Carruth, but it didn't make the experience of sitting through his slow-motion whole lotta nuthin any easier to bear. I also dislike Carruth as an actor. He's got a wimpy demeanor that works no better on screen than off.  His co-star, Amy Seimetz, is beautiful and talented. I'd like to see her in a good movie.

I stuck with ""Upstream Color"" to the bitter end, because it was so well-reviewed that I idealistically figured it just had to get better -- clarity had to come eventually.  I wanted my AWE-INSPIRING GOLDEN MOMENT!  But alas, the credits rolled without awe.",1493856000,,2642,4.634615384615385
