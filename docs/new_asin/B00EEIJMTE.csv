8604755,5,B00EEIJMTE,"I remember I enjoyed this movie when I saw it at Universe Multicultural Film Festival a year ago.  I liked the historical perspective of how the star of the film was determined to push a cart filled with a heavy projector long distances through open fields in order to let villagers view movies.  Through loyalty to her audiences and determination, she rose to high levels in the film company even though she was a woman.  The music resembles Chinese opera without all the body and hand motions you see on stage.  If you like that style of music you will enjoy this.  The antagonist was her mother-in-law who wanted her to stay home, but she persisted in her dream and succeeded.  The film was in Chinese and the subtitles were sometimes difficult to finish, but you got the gist of the story.  The star gave a good performance.",1433030400,,828,4.554054054054054
