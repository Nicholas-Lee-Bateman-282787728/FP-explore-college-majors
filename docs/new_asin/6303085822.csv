 VERY ENJOYABLE",1214092800,4,76,5.7272727272727275
559083,5,6303085822,I show this movie to my 8th grade social studies students.  It gives a nice flavor of the 1920's lifestyle and the paradox of prohibition.  Gleason and Carney are great.,1173571200,2,169,4.6
559084,4,6303085822,"This came on on late-night tv-- local station only gave it two stars, but my video guide gives it four, and the guide is right!  This is a little gem of a made-for-tv-movie (video quality isn't so good, unfortunately)-- directed by Jackie Cooper, this film stars Jackie Gleason and Art Carney as two vaudevillians who become prohibition federal agents.  They use their vaudeville skills to sneak into many ""speaks"" and shut them down-- including a stint with Moe (Carney) in a dress!

The two oldsters are funny and charming as ever in this 1985 film.  The period feel is fun and there's a breezy quality keeping it all light and pleasant; it never bogs down.

And if you think it's too implausible?  Go look up ""Izzy and Moe"" and see what you find!  These are based on two real cops and the wildest shenanigans depicted are based on true incidents-- including the dress!  Terrific fun.  My 80-something dad stayed up to watch it, too, smiling at the performers-- and at the terrific old cars going by.",1167609600,5,1002,4.6477272727272725
559085,5,6303085822,Simpley Great from the return of GLEASON & Carney & a good diction by Cooper.,1122076800,,77,4.2
559086,5,6303085822,"Many of the exterior shots in ""Izzy and Moe"" were actually shot on the corner of Bleeker Street, and the Bowery in N.Y.C. right across the avenue from the cul-de-sac that is CBGBS.

I know because I was actually there to witness this rare event. I was also a high school student down the block from CBGBS.  What was remarkable about the experience was witnessing  JACKIE GLEASON & ART CARNEY in the flesh (in 1920's clothes) and ACTUALLY ACTING for a ""one-camera shoot"" complete with JACKIE COOPER DIRECTING under a white umbrela. GLEASON & CARNEY stepped out of two different trailers.  JACKIE TOOK A VERY GRACIOUS BOW when we first saw him appear and applauded. It was OLD SCHOOL! Old-timers were coming out of the wood work to gawk at ART CARNEY (hiding hearing aids behind a wig and cap, and make-up). Even the junkies at the flop houses came out to see this. I ran around the set and managed to get COOPER'S autograph! He signed a piece of paper I thrusted at him, and then he told his techies like an old-time movie actor: ""All right get these kids outta here so we can shoot this thing.""  Wrestling legend BIG JOHN STUD suddenly appeared, and me and my school friends are standing behind a police line watching JACKIE COOPER DIRECT JACKIE GLEASON & ART CARNEY in a ""stake-out"" scene.  Watching the TWO HONEYMOONERS (very tall, commanding men),  was like looking at a couple of vintage monuments on that gritty old street corner.  The street was painted up in WATERCOLORS to hide the modern graffiti, and give the street corner a vintage aura, complete with a Model T Ford parked near the entrance of the old ""YIPPIE"" buiding. LOW BUDGET THE OLD FASHION WAY. It was very simple set up, small film crew,  with 3 legends on the same street corner across the street from CBGBS, plus BIG JOHN STUD. And: then AMAZINGLY: I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP: A Black Lincoln Town car pulls up, and all 3 rappers RUN DMC step out to watch the movie being made!! They were like us, just watching,  and they said their hellos to the very small crowd of fans alike that had just assembled on the street between the film's shooting.  JACKIE and ART never spoke any lines. They just stalked a building entrance and entered. Cut. A couple of autographs, and back into the trailers they went.

This was a time when you made movies the old-fashion way. And if that wasn't enough: When the shot was over, and it was time for me to head home and take the subway, FRED GWYNNE was on subway platform of BLEEKER STREET, like me, waiting to take the uptown 6 train. He was a serious writer and illustrator of children's books during his ""post-Herman Munster"" days, and was appearing in movies like ""Cotton Club"".  People on the train just stared at him and smiled. He never smiled back.",1121558400,20,2759,4.527162977867203
559194,5,6303085822,These two are pure classic greats. Fun version of prohibition stories. They could do most anything and still be entertaining.,1439596800,,125,5.3
559195,5,6303085822,Love this movie!,1438560000,,16,4.666666666666667
559196,4,6303085822,"Not until I came here did I know that the ""Izzy And Moe"" story was based on real people. Of course at the time I viewed this, I assumed the story was just fiction, and as fiction it worked out great. As history, it probably was no good-but the entertainment industry rarely depicts history accurately anyway.

Based on two real people, though the story is fictionalized.  The stars play two vaudevillians in the 1920's whose entertainment careers are done for, and one (Carney) has a bar, but thanks to Prohibition, he doesn't do well in that. The other (Gleason) convinces his former showbiz partner to become a Prohibition agent with him, and despite the partner's initial hostility, he agrees. At first, the police don't take them seriously, until their acting abilities turn out to make their alcohol raids far more successful. Of course, one mobster known as ""Dutch"" finds these new agents make him too uncomfortable, and the story's light tone turns darker as Dutch fights back violently.

The movie may not be good history, but as a story it's entertaining, and Gleason and Carney shine to the end.",1438473600,,1105,4.835978835978836
559197,5,6303085822,"Gleason and Carney, what a team they made.  I wouldn't mind seeing this one remade by say Clooney and one of his pals.",1432598400,,118,4.130434782608695

559200,4,6303085822,"It's good.  Starts off in sepia not in color & shows what's going on at the time as far as boxing, baseball, etc.  It's the roaring 20s.  Then the story takes off in color.  Izzy & Moe are their usual funny selves.  Two old gizzers /boozers looking for work.  The only thing available is as prohibition agents.  They get the job.  The women involved are a lot younger & good looking than the old gizzers but that does not take away from the story.

Very entertaining.",1423180800,,467,4.337209302325581

560079,5,6303085822,"The Editorial Review refers to Gleason and Carney as ""television performers.""  That's akin to saying that Baryshnikov is known for looking good in tights.  The accomplishments of Jackie Gleason and Art Carney must not be boxed in, including other reviewers statements about ""The Honeymooners.""  The movie is perfect, including the musical score composed by Gleason.  The acting of Carney and Gleason is impeccable, as is that of the supporting cast.  Costuming, set design and dressing are top-notch.  Cooper's directing is without a fault.  It's a great, (true, but fictionalized), story that is easily watched and fully enjoyed no matter how many viewings.

I'm lucky.  I have the VHS.  This allows for full enjoyment without DVD-washing, endless add-ons that deprive the viewer of enjoying a movie as a movie.  Backstory, you can always get later.",1416096000,,850,5.268656716417911

560161,4,6303085822,"Big success on all fronts - as a Gleason-Carney reunion - as a Made for TV movie.

Made at the time of the amazing ""Honeymooners"" TV resurgence - after decades of speculation, the Museum of Broadcasting brought out some Honeymooners sketches from the '50s, never rerun, and suddenly local TV began showing uncut syndicated episodes...then, the same year as this movie release, the kinescope sketches were shown on Cable TV - then finally added to the filmed programs (""the Classic 39"").

With that enthusiasm and upbeat mood this movie was put together and it's a good one. Jackie Cooper breezily directed a very good script...he managed to keep things light while telling a ""dark"" story. Gleason at age 69 probably should have played ""Grand Dad"", not ""Dad"", but no fans will complain.

The acting is fine...apparently Cooper let the two stars take it as big or small as they wanted...they play ex-vaudevillians who cannot help infusing their new ""regular"" job with broad flashes of the past. the soundtrack produced by Gleason, works perfectly - watch on PC and listen on headphones with Media Player on ""Enhancement/Cave""! :)

Art Carney should have gotten an Emmy for his role as ""Moe""...yes, in the '50s he was the only member of the ""team"" get such an honor...and I'm sure Jackie, taking things a little slower, cigarette akimbo, would not have minded...again.

Nice that the movie appears to have been shot in New York City...and
Particularly strong contribution by Jesse Doran, as ""The Dutchman"".

Look for Mrs. Gleason, as ""sophisticated lady""!",1371945600,,1552,5.019455252918288

560163,5,6303085822,If you have not seen this movie than you have missed out on one of the Funniest Classics ever.  Art Carney and Jackie Gleason are perfect for the telling of this true story.

560164,5,6303085822,"Loosely based on 2 real life prohibition agents, Izzy & Moe is great fun to watch. You do learn a little about the prohibition era and the way it made criminals of pretty much everyone who liked their ""spirits.""

It is great to see them together for their final performance and if you're a Honeymooners fan you simply want to add this to your collection. It's pretty much Ralph and Norton pretending to be cops arresting the bootleggers. I enjoyed this film and I was very glad that it was released on DVD.",1255392000,,435,4.45

560170,5,6303085822,It's been over 50 years since Jackie Gleason and Art Carney teamed up in their immortal characters of Ralph Kramden and Ed Norton in the Honeymooners. Today the show is very much alive through DVD discs. In 1985 Gleason and Carney teamed up for an entertaining movie about two men fighting against illegal booze joints in the early 1920s. This was a fun filled movie with some serious moments. What a fine finish for these two legendary entertainers. Good stuff!,1250899200,14,462,4.7875

7837340,5,6303085822,i bought this movie at amazon and watched it this rainey afternoon.izzy -jackie gleason-wants to become a prohibion agent but when he comes to get the job the main guy thinks he is an old geezer prohibion agents are suppose to be slim and tough but there are no other choices and he must find a partner. So he gets moe -art carney- even thoe he is mad at him for borrowing to much money he decides to do it. They are shockinly good izzy has a perfect shooting on the target and then they catch the 1st crooks by dressing up as baseball players izzy the coach. Then they bust the next batch of crooks by dressing up in sailor suits. The door says keep out and you must know the pass word but moe fakes a heart attack and they ask for booze and they caught them too. Then they dress up as ok cowboys and bust more booze only this time they made an error and they wernt crooks. The 4th time they bust a woman she tells them busting her would hurt them just as bad as it would hurt her and she flirts with moe. The main agent is real mad at izzy and moe for doing things there way so when he tells them to bust a boozing sherif he wants them to do it his way they don't listen moe dresses up as izzy's wife yes a woman with curly blonde hair a blue dress and glasses.they pretend to get remarried then they burt the sherrif.
