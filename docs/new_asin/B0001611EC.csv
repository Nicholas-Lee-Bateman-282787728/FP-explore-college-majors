8007177,4,B0001611EC,"Everything comes to a boil on this DVD.  In a grand confrontation with Shinrei, one of the Mibu clan, Muramasa the swordmaster is badly weakened.  In order to help Kyo face the incredible powers of the clan, and stop their drive toward world conquest, Muramasa teaches Kyo the last of the great swordfighting techniques - the ultimate Satsujin.
Now the companions head for the Mibu castle at Sekigahara, each with their own agenda.  As they progress, all will meet opponents both human and kenyou.  This is always the occasion for a lot of verbal abuse, balletics,  and shouting the names of the various moves they are going to make.  I'm not sure I will ever understand the Japanese habit of exclaiming what you are going to do just before doing it, but this only seems to bother me.
With one surprising exception the characters stay in the path already set for them.  Kyo destroys everything in his way, Yuya renews her commitment to see Kyo through his struggles (something Kyo doesn't seem to appreciate), and Benitora continues to make passes at Yuya, etc.
Studio DEEN seems to do just enough work to keep the series at a good artistic level, but not enough to create true excellence.  The backgrounds aren't as fluid as they could be, and there is a bit too much repetition.  While hardly a fatal flaw, it limits the effectiveness of what really is a great story full of interesting twists and complexities.",1084838400,2,1413,4.711382113821138
8007178,5,B0001611EC,"Overall i have never come across an anime that i have liked more. I find the characters a source of inspiration. The plot is wonderful to me and i found it to be very exciting. The fight scenes were also something that i found well done. Even the music seemed to flow into the different parts of the story, appearing and dissapearing when needed.",1083196800,3,346,4.421875
