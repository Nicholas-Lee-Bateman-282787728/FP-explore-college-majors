7930485,4,B0000541U8,"This movie really is about two gay ""brothers."" Not biological brothers of course. The Chinese use the term brother to mean a good friend in a lot of movies. The movie starts with Chow Yun-fat's character stealing rice and then a girl in the orphange catches him and tells him never to steal again. Well, the girl leaves and little chow turns into a criminal. Chow yun's ""brother"" get's into trouble when he kills a rival gang bosses brother. the boss sends him on a mission and then doesn' want to pay up when he completes it. in the meantime both of the ""brothers"" find love. yun-fat finds the girl of his child hood and alan tang's character falls in love with a singer. when they return chow yun-fat wants to go straight and moves to hong kong to run a convenience store. when their good friend's son is killed, yun-fat must return to help his ""brother"" fight the rival boss. I couldn't really tell if this movie was a parody on John Woo's use of homosexual undertones or if it was a genuine movie about two men who loved each other more than their respective female parteners. you make the call. this movie is really violent and interesting. worth watching.",995587200,2,1161,4.507109004739337
7930486,3,B0000541U8,"A basic story of two gangster brothers is a springboard for some good action sequences/gun fights. Chow Yun-Fat plays the younger brother who seeks to get out of the life of crime. Alan Tang is his older brother who wants nothing more than to remain a Triad boss. Turf Wars erupt into violence. Chow leaves the Triad, only to return to save his brother. A lesser known Chow Yun-Fat film, with a good, simple story and a great action finale. Worth a look.",984700800,,454,4.481927710843373
