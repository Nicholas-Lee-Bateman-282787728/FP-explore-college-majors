8101960,5,B000CSUNCA,"""The Rulers of the Empire"" CD & DVD material is yet another reminder how very unique, outstandingly relevant, and consistent Michael Parenti's work remains. This package contains more than 180 minutes of ""the best of Michael Parenti:"" speeches, a Q & A session, and an absolute jewel ""How I Became an Activist for Social Justice,"" a personal, humorous, and inspiring talk given in Berkeley in 2003.

Many of us agree with Cornell West's assessment and believe that we now need Parenti more than ever. He is internationally known, award winning author and lecturer, one of the nation's leading intellectuals and progressive political analysts. But this realization about the impact of his thought and activism is even more a result of Parenti's extraordinary consciousness and abilities to guide us through the labyrinths of countless U.S. foreign interventions in such entertaining ways. Maintaining a historical perspective, he is masterfully painting a consistent picture of the U.S. quest for world domination showing viewers that the same set of goals and methods are used in many different wars and occupations, masked by the efficient ideology of the ruling class that wants ""to have it all."" This audio and video material shows again that Parenti manages to do so much with every public appearance. He takes the time to remind us that even well-known progressive thinkers and activists are at risk to be swayed by the dominant ideology (examples of Yugoslavia, Libya, Cuba, etc.), while patiently repeating important details that connect many U.S. wars. Above all, he points to the reasons behind perpetual wars and planetary destruction with unparalleled clarity. Listeners and readers of Parenti's books will not get discouraged and depressed: he shows us the great importance of humor; the power of clear thinking and consistent class analysis, so that we can debunk myths and get inspired learning from his own life as an activist. You can hear and see that these talks were given in a standing room only settings when the audience laughed wholeheartedly and gave Mr. Parenti standing ovations.
This material should be used in schools, colleges, universities, and definitely in training of new generations of social justice activists.",1336435200,,2245,5.270949720670391
8101961,4,B000CSUNCA,"First, the title is somewhat misleading.  Parenti doesn't go into the kind of David Icke/Jim Marrs overarching Illuminati type conspiracy that the title suggests.  It is much more the ""radical"" socialist academic's take on US foreign policy with props given to his own working-class hero background. [Yawn.]

Second, lecture 2 is seriously flawed. There are a handful of times when the editing is snafu and Parenti and the soundtrack have nothing to do with each other.  Which is fairly annoying.

Third, While Parenti's lectures are vaulable commentary on the current state of affairs, his castigation of Chomsky and Zinn left me a tad dismayed.  He clearly sees himself as morally and intellectually superior to these original thinkers because, apparently, they have been duped by the Establishment.

Fourth, it doesn't help that once in each lecture he looses his place and forgets what his point was.  Given the power of his thoughts, this is just lame.",1161388800,2,957,5.129032258064516
