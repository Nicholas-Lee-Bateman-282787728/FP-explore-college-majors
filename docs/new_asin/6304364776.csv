852622,2,6304364776,"I was very sorely disappointed that these are only short little clips of the classic episodes.  I wouldn't recommend this DVD for anyone, really.  If you're a newcomer, then this is barely able to give you a taste of Rowan's ingenious brand of comedy that I love, and if you're an avid fan, you'll simply be as disappointed as myself.",997401600,12,334,4.55
852623,2,6304364776,"I've been a huge Bean fan for years, and it was an easy decision to buy this DVD based on the description. I did my best to put on his homeroom sketch for my high school talent show, and almost got it approved, but anyway, that's another story.
 Mr. Bean is indeed an instant classic, and even if you think you hate British comedy, this will probably win you over anyway.
 However, beware that you are NOT purchasing 11 full ""episodes"".  You are purchasing a single flashback episode that flashes back to 11 short selections from Bean episodes.
 If you don't believe me, note that the total running time is 77 minutes.  Subtract the movie trailers, the credits, the intro, and what you have is about an hour of footage, about half of which is the filler between flashbacks. Now, it is quite hysterical filler about Mr Bean rummaging through his attic and playing with his teddy, but it's still filler, and it's still a flashback episode. If you hate flashback episodes then don't bother.
 To paint by numbers, the episode ""Mr Bean Helps a Street Performer"" is about 1 minute and 5 seconds long. Most of the episodes are around 2-5 minutes long. Now, multiply that by 11 episodes, and you have about 40 minutes or less of old Mr Bean highlights for the price of a full DVD.  If you ask me, you're money is better spent on Monty Python episodes, or for that matter, the Rowan Atkinson Live tape!",973123200,131,1393,4.503968253968254

852903,5,6304364776,"Greetings;

Nothing new mind you, Rowan Atkinson felt that he was being typecasted with acting in parts much like Bean. But he had a good run, several movies, several seasons in BBC terms as well as the animated series and a Wii video game based on the animated episodes. The physical aspects that would often go into his playing the part was probably also getting to be a bit too much, especially when expected to act like a child. But enough about that.

Been a big fan since I was much much younger. Used to have a couple of the episodes on VHS, the movie, the best bits of bean-which is what this review is really about mind you-as well as several tapes to the Thin Blue Line show which when I was much much younger, I couldn't understand what they had to do with Mr. Bean-which is to say they have nothing to do with each other, just a few actors here and there. I upgraded to dvd over the years and for some time had the 'complete' series which included the tv show and nothing else. I also bought the best of Mr. Bean Vol. 1 which I thought was what this was supposed to be but in fact, it isn't. My main point in all this is that while the Best bits of Mr. Bean is a flashback episode as many have been quick to point out, it is still an episode. I don't care for the snippets so much since there is a lot left out of some of them-the crushed car scene-he falls to his knees and the scene ends, as though he were more upset by the whole thing but the scene would contine in the show to reveal him pulling the deadbolt off his driver side door and acting as though everything were fine. Makes the scene more dramatic but still. I wanted it for the element that strung it all together. Him digging around his attic as it gives you even more of a glimpse into his flat. How he lives not that much else is revealed but still-all of the other things he has stored away in there, so many other unaddressed stories.

They did return to the attic a bit in the animated series but still. Just fun to see something more of Bean. Even if some of his bits are things he had done before apart from bean, elements from his stand-up and sketches. But it is all in good fun. Oh, but do see his one man show. Loved him as the headmaster and as the Devil-Toby.

Thank you and take care...",1373328000,,2278,4.123873873873874
852904,5,6304364776,"It's Mr. Bean, what more can be said? Other than Monty Python, what British comedy is funnier? O.K. yes and Tracy Ullman. But believe me Mr. Bean rakes up there, yes I love BENNY HILL. He is and always will be a legend, But while Mr. Hill is hands down funny, there is something about Rowan Atkinson's humor that is more accessible to me and while I have seen everything MR. Bean has done, this DVD really is the BEST. I do recommend though you get the complete Bean because like Monty Python or Tracy you have to know everything they've done to truly appreciate them/him.",1373241600,,572,4.40566037735849

I had never even heard of him, but I researched it on the internet and even watched some of it on youtube.  What a fantastic teaching resource.  There are even lesson plans on the internet which I used to get the gist of how to use the clips in class.  My Ss love it!  They are very entertained and the fact that there is little to no talking in the clips makes it more or less universal in understanding.  I usually make up 10 or so questions about the video (pre-typed and use as handouts), which gives me materials for vocabulary to pre-teach before watching the clip.  I put the vocabulary list at the top of the questionnaire handout.  The clips are all fairly short, so it doesn't take up too much class time with just watching.

853063,4,6304364776,"I just recently got into Mr. Bean after seeing ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" in theaters. I loved the humor, and I quickly looked for something on Amazon to get to see more. I devoured every episode and skit on this DVD, and began to watch the extra features, with my children who up to this point had been loving Mr. Bean as well.

The documentary on Mr. Bean includes footage of the ""Not the 9:00 News"" show he was on, and the opening credits of that show include nudity in the form of dancing topless women, not cartoon or Monty Python type. Needless to say I was surprised by that.

I had been so glad to find some good, clean British humor that was safe for my family to watch too, but we're not keeping this one :(.

The episodes themselves are great. I understand that ""The Turkey"" skit in  ""Merry Christmas Mr. Bean"" and the ""Armchair"" skit in ""Do It Yourself Mr. Bean"" have excluded some scenes that were originally aired, but the character of Mr. Bean is hilarious, and the precarious situations he continually finds himself in will keep you rolling. Just be careful if you have small children.",1191196800,19,1095,4.46
853064,5,6304364776,The best of Mr. Bean's episodes. Many of the scenes were not edited so there is some brief nudity. Mr. Bean continues to tickle the funny bone.,1190592000,4,143,4.333333333333333
853065,4,6304364776,"""The Best of Mr. Bean"" contains short vignettes about the happenings in Mr. Bean's life, whether it is a trip to Harrod's at Christmas time, or his birthday, New Year's Eve, after holiday sales, the horror film, church, a trip to the beach or park, a visit from Royalty, and more.

Some of the quirkiness you come to associate with Mr. Bean is just that; it's what makes him tick.

The humor is sometimes pratfall but also intelligent as well.  On the other hand, there is a darker side to Mr. Bean that you may not recognize until you see it, so be forewarned, it could be misconstrued.  Personally, I felt a bit saddened by some of this darker side, but usually Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) adds just a bit extra that doesn't leave you feeling put out.

There is some adult humor but children will recognize this; for example, the thumb caught in the fly of the pants; there are few if any other double-entendres that would cause parents to be concerned.

I would rate this humor as PG or PG-13, because there is one scene of rear nudity that discerning parents may want their children to miss.

All in all, a funny DVD that has its best moments interspersed with slower parts; sometimes predictable, but classic bits just the same.",1189814400,29,1231,4.518018018018018

In this DVD, it is a rainy day, and Mr. Bean thinks it is good weather for feeding the ducks. First, he has to find umbrellas for him and his teddy. He finds his teddy's umbrella with no problems, but when his umbrella breaks, now he has to find a new one. Along the way, he comes across reminders of many of his past experiences.

To make a long review short, Mr. Bean does some silly stuff (getting dressed in his car, sliding down an elephant slide at the pool, fitting everything into a small suitcase, etc) in these episodes:

Mr. Bean at the dentist (5 Stars)

Mr. Bean helps a street performer (3.5 Stars)

Mr. Bean's Christmas (5 Stars)

Mr. Bean on the high dive (5 Stars)

Mr. Bean in a parking garage (5 Stars)

True fans will save their money for the complete series on DVD.  Well, we have Blackadder, now where is Mr. Bean and ""The Thin Blue Line"" on DVD?  Bean is completely opposite of Blackadder and Thin Blue Line in that as Bean, Rowan is all but mute and completely relies on physical comedy, where as in Blackadder (as Edmund) and Thin Blue line (as Inspector Fowler) Rowan talks his head off and the main source of comedy is in the dialogue, although physical comedy is not absent by any means.  Those who only know Rowan for being Bean may be shocked when they see Blackadder or Blue line for the first time because of the drastic character change, but trust me he's just as funny with words as he is with physical action.  ""The Best Bits of Mr. Bean"" is fine for a rental or for an extremely casual fan, but bigger fans of Rowan and Bean are still waiting for the complete series on DVD.  I can highly recommend the Blackadder 5 disc DVD set, which contains all 4 series (24 episodes), a reunion special, and other goodies (read my review of that item for much more detail) but I recommend saving your money for the complete ""Mr. Bean"" series.  The BBC series' ""Mr. Bean"" and ""The Thin Blue Line"" are essential comedy and I can't wait until they are represented as well as the brilliantly hilarious ""Blackadder"" series.",1021075200,42,1501,4.476190476190476
