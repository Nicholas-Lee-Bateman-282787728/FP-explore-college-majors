My child loves this at four months.  It seems to be the one and only item that calms him down. He laughs and giggles at London Bridges song.  I like the fact that the music is true lullaby's and there is NOT a voice singing them.  The graphics are a little out dated at 2D Design.  I really could careless as long as he is happy.  I would purchase the DVD tomorrow if netflix quit offering it.  That is how much he loves it.",1257984000,,593,4.043103448275862
