There's a lovely selection of aquariums that you can rotate through or just pick one. You also have the options of playing all with natural sounds or with music. Great way to create a sense of serenity and beauty in your home.",1395792000,6,332,4.55
1172967,5,9089707409,"First of all, this is a really good deal: three DVDs for the price of one!

I watched the Fireplace DVD first, and saw its value as a fireplace substitute at a dinner party. My guests all gathered around the big screen and stared into the fire. But I also watched it by myself, later, and ended up mesmerized, gazing into the flames like a caveman (after all, the fire pit was their television). Id never thought about it, but fireplaces have their own individual charm. Youll see what I mean when you warm your hands in front of the Classic Fireplace, the Christmas Fireplace, and the Forest Cabin Fireplace. You can either listen to the rush of the flames and the snapping and popping of the logs, or you can choose one of three soundtracks. Very, very, relaxing.

The Aquariums of the World DVD was great, because you have a large choice of aquariums to visit. All the aquarium communities are peaceful, populated by breeds of fish that get along, so you don't see the big fish eating the smaller fish. The breeds of fish placed in the tank complement each other by swimming and feeding at different depths. So you have top-feeders, bottom-feeders, and fish that float in the middle depth, making for a very interesting community. Theres plenty of variety: colorful aquarium fish, but also ocean fish that are very big, indeed. The actions of the jellyfish will blow your mind.

And, finally, the Nature Scene DVD. Imagine meditating upon a landscape painting framed on your office or living room wall. As beautiful as it is, it is one dimensional. But suppose the river on the canvas started to flow, and the birds to fly, and the Sun to rise; and suppose the sounds of the rushing water and the song birds began to emanate from the canvas? Well, thats what you get with this video. You are totally drawn into the each experience (there are 24 separate scenes). Because each scene is framed, so to speak, your natural craving to look right and left is checked: you are gently directed by the photographer to look at the scene before you, and to look deeplyand thats when you begin to discover all the natural rhythms of Nature you might have overlooked.

And, lastly, the music from all three DVDs. It is soothing and it is haunting. Youll want to hear it again and again. I wouldnt be surprised if the music was especially scored for these presentations.

These three DVDs are a great introduction to the creative genius of producer, director and chief photographer, Tony Helsloot.

1172968,5,9089707409,"This set is truly incredible with the highest quality films on (let's face it) the three main topics of ambient movies. From nature films to fish life and terrific fireplaces we use this set all the time. The quality is as always spot on with anything from this film maker and if this is the first time you are venturing in ambient movies you won't find any better. As for us, we have lots of DVD's on those themes but this set is really convenient and its quality speaks for itself.... Love it!",1393200000,4,495,4.333333333333333
1172969,5,9089707409,"This boxed set is a compilation of stunning scenery, fireplaces and wonderful aquariums.  I love the fact that you have a choice of listening with music or just with natural sounds.  Found the color to be superb on my HDTV.  The scenes are absolutely peaceful and provide a calming and pleasant atmosphere in my home.  Definitely recommend this set to anyone!  I will be purchasing more of Tony Helsloot's work in the future.",1424131200,2,425,4.767123287671233

The box has HD in the right bottom corner, but the picture quality is clearly not HD. I do not recommend this item at all.",1420156800,2,219,3.888888888888889
1172971,5,9089707409,"We went to a Christmas party and prior to arriving at the door - we saw this beautiful blazing fireplace through the window. We knew our hosts didn't have a fireplace and then realized it was on their television.  We had to have it as our new home doesn't have a fireplace either.

We ""played"" our fireplace during two dinner parties and it was such a hit. Our kids loved looking at the aquariums and beautiful scenery!  It is perfect!",1419984000,5,435,4.4125

1172973,3,9089707409,"Well,
Had ordered the set to use for Christmas, had borrowed one from a friend that was great, fireplace and Christmas music together, wonderful, did not have to put a Cd for the music. The one I received does have music but not conducive to The Holidays. Disappointed, You bet. The fireplace with it's crackling fire was nice but I was waiting for more upbeat sound.",1419724800,,367,4.575757575757576

1172975,3,9089707409,Resolution is not good enough for my 60 inch new Samsung TV and my new dvd Samsung player. Music keeps repeating in different sceneries in each dvd. A great pity as the pictures are fantastically beautiful.,1415232000,3,206,4.75

1172978,3,9089707409,"I purchased this product to aid in insomnia issues.  The first DVD I watched was Nature's Windows. The product contains excellent photos/videos and music plays which I begin to really enjoy and relax....... then abruptly the music/sound ends and the screen goes to black.  A few seconds later the next segment in the series begins.  Seems like the comfort received is lost with the hard transitions.  I would prefer something similar to dissolving or other mild transition to advance thru the video and audio.  Also, some of the audio really doesn't seem to match the scene being displayed.  The beautiful winter scene of snow falling and a little creek gently flowing has audio of a quick running river and feels distracting.  For my intended purpose, of insomnia support, I prefer the softer colors rather that the bright red and orange colors that seem to encourage increased energy.  The Aquariums of the World is the next dvd that I watched.  I viewed it and became quite distracted at hearing what appeared to be jungle sounds while viewing an aquarium.  It is quite possible that the product was not designed for the purpose that I intended when I purchased it.  I am still trying to decide it I should return it.",1398470400,13,1220,4.7894736842105265

7901558,5,9089707409,Bought these for gifts. Feedback has been great. My friend says he especially likes the repeat playback and aquarium scenes. My other friend says he plans on repeating the Christmas fireplace on his TV during his annual Christmas party. Nice variety and clear HD display. Very pleased.,1443916800,,285,5.085106382978723
7901559,4,9089707409,"I love these! I was actually over on their website www.worldnaturevideo.com browsing all the virtual cycle rides and walks previews but I wandered into the aquarium section and found this gem!

Aquariums- Why, I do believe one of the fish in Track 3 is shamelessly flirting with me! Sure, a few of the smaller fish are a bit blurry at times but it doesn't bother me. I'm not loving the bird sounds though, I'd rather have the bubbling sounds like those of an actual aquarium but still, not a deal-breaker. I agree with other reviewers that listening to beach waves and the like doesn't really match the scenes. The music tracks are lovely and calming though, which is nice because I'll probably just be using those or mute while enjoying my 12 new aquariums. I wanted this one for when I have the tv on while I'm doing other things or when company comes over but I honestly don't get much done because I end up just staring at the fish!

Fireplaces- I wanted this DVD for reading, sleeping with the tv on (I have a space heater to complete the experience), and to set an ambiance when company comes over. I love the crackling fires! They all pretty-much look the same to me, big roaring fires, so I'm glad I didn't buy this separately but I know I'll use it often. I'm kinda disappointed the gas fire wasn't on there but I guess it doesn't really matter.

Nature Scenery- I wanted this one for meditation and maybe sleeping with the tv on. Some of the scenes are so beautiful and life-like I feel like I'm there! There are 24 different scenes to choose from so I can take my mini vacations in different places, nice!",1443571200,4,1616,4.452702702702703
