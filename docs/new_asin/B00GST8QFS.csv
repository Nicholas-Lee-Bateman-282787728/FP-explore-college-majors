6108955,5,B00GST8QFS,"Great movie! This movie has a great message and great actors. Wish we had more Christian movies like  this. God loves us so much that no matter what we've done, He will forgive us. He just wants us to walk with Him and stay true to His Word. He will always put people in our paths to provide support and encouragement whenever it's needed. Loved the movie!",1421193600,10,356,4.313432835820896
6108956,5,B00GST8QFS,This movie was very relevant for the times we live in.  Really make one think about what we allow ourselves to think.  The most devastating enemy is the one inside our own head.  The heart is deceitful above all else.,1420588800,14,217,4.375
6108957,5,B00GST8QFS,"Very good movie,one more time David excels as a producer,is a must have !",1414800000,6,73,4.285714285714286
6108958,2,B00GST8QFS,Boring with bad acting.  Just a real loser of a film in every way.,1414454400,2,66,3.7142857142857144
6108959,5,B00GST8QFS,"I would have to say that this movie ranks right alongside ""Fireproof"", with a first rate, well thought out story line.  For those who are already involved in, or on the verge of an emotional affair, this movie cuts like a knife.  This film is not afraid to address the very real struggles that many - including Christians - face when it comes to this particular temptation.  Veteran actor Ted McGinley puts in a solid performance, as does Ana Ayora.  I highly recommend this film.",1414022400,22,480,4.6117647058823525
6108960,2,B00GST8QFS,"didn't think it was that good. I was surprised because this was directed by David A.R. White who we think
is a good actor/director but he failed at this one. Ouch.

Hopefully that doesn't happen again on his next movie if he does direct another Christian flick.

I've seen many of his movies, those have been the good ones that are interesting and strange
but this one sure was not of them. Ah well. Best of luck next time, mate!",1413417600,3,429,4.35

6109063,4,B00GST8QFS,"Good movie, shows real struggles some of us may face in a very real way.  It displayed the way the world handles things and then showed the right way, the way God would have us handle things.  I thought the story was well told and well displayed, the man's struggles were well told and well displayed, every thing was well done except the wife's WAY overboard make up that made her just obnoxious to look at.  Beyond that I like how it was able to show his lust but not overdo the sexuality of the woman he was looking at.  It seems so many Christian films are so anxious to show the women all scantily dressed.  In this movie there was one woman who they could easily have done that with but they didn't, it was far more tactfully handled.  The one thing I would have added would be a full Gospel presentation, but this definitely did deal with sin as sin and that was well told.",1472515200,5,880,4.2395209580838324

6109103,4,B00GST8QFS,I enjoyed the movie.  To me whst transpired in the movie is something that happens every day. It starts out innocently then gets out of control.  Doing God's Will is so different than doing what I believe is right.  It inspired me not to make these devasting choices and keep my focuds on God's Will in my life.,1441497600,4,311,4.327586206896552

8627052,3,B00GST8QFS,"I purchased the film to see Ted McGinley. (Don't laugh). Though a bit preachy, the film raised questions as to how to deal with moral dilemmas. Hacking scenes were most powerful, though its' resolution was somewhat trite.

Born again Christians should appreciate this more.",1527552000,,273,5.204545454545454

8627056,1,B00GST8QFS,"Rare faith film by this producer I could not stand.  Almost painfully contrived, predictable and lacking a soul.  It comes across as a sincere and well meaning attempt to highlight redemption from the course of adultery of the heart and mind as well as other competing life temptations and distractions in a liberal world - yet for myself felt flat.  Some of the acting unbearable and perhaps poorly cast yet not all which made it difficult.  Could not get into it..  Nothing to even talk or think about after. First film my closest Christian friend and I had nothing to say about after I was the one who purchased and  except breathe sigh of relief and embarrassment when it ended.  Recommend sticking to Fireproof and War Room which are stellar films regarding marriage infidelity and redemption.",1519689600,,798,4.823529411764706
