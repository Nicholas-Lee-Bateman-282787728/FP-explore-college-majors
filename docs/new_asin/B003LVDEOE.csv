The print on that box set is quite poor -- but watchable -- and seems to use public domain or copyright free music for its soundtrack.  (Occasionally you can even hear the hiss and crackle of the old records they're using.)  That still makes it more enjoyable than this release.  On this DVD it sounds like someone's nephew was hired to play the soundtrack -- on an old Casio keyboard purchased at a garage sale.  The music, what I could bear to listen to, doesn't fit the mood either.  It's somber and foreboding during moments of poignancy, like when the farmer of the title watches his newly married daughter leave home for the last time.  Then moments later when the movie's mood shifts to the comedic the soundtrack remains somber and foreboding.  Silent movies weren't really silent, features like this one would always have been accompanied by live music.  So the soundtracks here badly mar an otherwise solid release.

For the movies themselves: neither qualifies as necessary viewing for the casual fan of Hitchcock.  Downhill has some interesting visuals but lacks any of the suspense the director is famous for.  Yet even with the soundtrack off it still works as a silent era drama.  The Farmer's Wife is at times quite silly and features both the overacting silent films are notorious for and a more naturalistic and affecting acting style.  (From the same actor, the lead, no less.)  But as a comedy of its time it works, it actually had me laughing (out loud!) on a few occasions.

If you are interested in Hitchcock's silent movies, but aren't a completist, I would suggest The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1927).  This is perhaps the most important title of Hitchcock's silent era.  (The best version I've found is on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alfred-Hitchcock-Premiere-Collection/dp/B001D8W7EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alfred Hitchcock Premiere Collection</a>.)  Or perhaps the last silent movie Hitchcock made, the melodrama The Manxman (1929).  While not a thriller it does feature some genuine suspenseful moments, and more than a few Hitchcockian touches. (The best version of that seems to be on Lions Gate's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Alfred-Hitchcock-Box-Set/dp/B000KJU12S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Alfred Hitchcock Box Set</a>.)

I'm giving this DVD three stars simply because it's contain the only region 1 release of Downhill that I can find, not to mention the high quality of the print.  However, if there's ever another release of this movie with even a mediocre soundtrack and a lesser quality print my rating of this current release would fall to a single star.",1354579200,,3177,5.829004329004329
8399863,3,B003LVDEOE,"The last three minutes of Downhill froze, and I could not see the ending. The Farmers Wife, cannot be seen AT ALL. very frustrating to be sent a defective disc. I think a replcement would be in order! The quality of the movie was very good, if only I could have seen the end, and I did like the movie very much.

8399865,5,B003LVDEOE,"These are a couple of great movies, beautifully filmed and told at the hand of the master, Sir Alfred Hitchcock. Instead of the usual piano music, these silent movies sport a hip techno soundtrack that gives the movies a modern feel. Downhill is about a college boy who is innocently accused of getting a woman in trouble and so he's expelled. What's interesting about this plot point is you really have to fill in the gaps yourself. I guess this was very racy subject matter back in the 1920s, so they tip toe around the seduction and pregnancy in the film that if you blink, you could miss it. There are a lot of artsy shots and interesting camera angles showing the brilliant work of Hitchcock. For example, the movie is caled Downhill, so there are scenes of our hero descending a staircase, the descending an long escalator, then going down on an elevator, as each new humiliation in his life brings him to a new lowly state. Another scene that I'm fond of is when our hero, Roddy, it at one of his lowest points, he becomes a dime a dance boy in Paris, I guess implying he's a paid gigilo. After a nightlong party at the hall, the sunlight is let in, and all around our hero is a sea of twisted, broken forms of used up and over partied men and women, the most disturbing woman being the one Roddy has had to entertain all night. She truly has a face that could stop a clock.
  The Farmer's Wife is a lighthearted romantic comedy. Farmer Sweetland loses his wife to sickness, and only being middle aged, he soon becomes lonely and thinks of remarrying. He makes a list of the avalable women on nearby farms and methodically sets out to propose to them. Much to his surprise, the women reject him for one reason or another. Sweetland does not take these rejections well and tells the women off, driving one of his would-be brides into a crying fit, a really over the top crying fit! But he is scene through these difficult times with the hepl of his housekeeper Minta and his comic relief farmhand, Ash.",1273708800,6,2008,4.439024390243903
