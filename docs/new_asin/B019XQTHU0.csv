After 10 1/2 minutes of character introduction our couple appear to be the only two humans alive, as everything is burnt to a crisp. They happened to be underwater at the time. As Ddac (Ibrahim Man) becomes an adult, he impresses the 10 year senior Alba (Rachel Hurd-Wood) by getting the tractor working as they ride 128 km to Barcelona. Here the story changes, but really doesn't pick up.

The movie had bland characters and seemed to have lacked a theme. While it was not unpleasing or difficult to watch, it wasn't overly entertaining either. Listed as a ""horror"" film, I failed to see the horror in the movie. More like a sci-fi drama. Based on a novel by Manuel de Pedrolo ""Mecanoscrit del Segon Origen"", the most famous science-fiction novel in Catalan literature.

Guide: Brief sex and nudity. Large English subtitles.

Note to sci-fi writers and fans: Gasoline and diesel fuel have short shelf lives (gas about a month, diesel 3-6 months) unless fuel stabilizers are added to them. Just saying.",1462665600,,1076,4.805405405405406
