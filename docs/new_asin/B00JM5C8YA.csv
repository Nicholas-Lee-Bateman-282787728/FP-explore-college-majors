6381556,4,B00JM5C8YA,"United States Champion Sheamus vs. Cesaro - J.B.L. predicted on commentary that this match was going to get physical right from the start & it did as soon as the bell rang with both men giving & receiving strong strikes such as Cesaro's various european uppercuts while Sheamus beat on his chest more times in the ropes than he usually does as both men traded momentum showing their strengths such as a superplex from the top rope after dead lifting his opponent off the apron or catching their opponent in mid-air or countering their signature moves with one of their own.  This was a really good opening match that was exactly what Michael Cole said in the beginning, ""this is going to be a physical match.""

Goldust & Cody Rhodes vs. RybAxel - Goldust was able to gain the early control for his team only to RybAxel to regain it back when Cody was tagged in with various double team offense while isolating one man in their corner of the ring heavily working him over keeping him away from his partner while the Rhodes kept having issues such as Ryback catching Cody at one point & sending him into Goldust.  This match was solid but did it's job in continuing the storyline between Cody & Goldust but also showcasing what J.B.L. brought up in commentary in how RybAxel were no longer wrestling as individuals & more as a team.

Big E vs. Rusev - Both men came out with flags representing their countries as the match started out with a full body collision between both men that ended in a stalemate before both men delivered some blows that backed the other into a corner followed by some hard hitting moves of their own from a spear through the ropes to the opponent running with all his momentum into a big kick in the face.  The match was short but worked very physical for the time they had.

Kofi Kingston vs. Bo Dallas - Kofi was originally on the PPV panel for the show but was told last minute that he would have a match against Bo on the PPV which was nothing more than a setup for Kane to destroy him possibly in response to his negative opinions on The Authority on Twitter.  This was just a segment with Bo Dallas having the reaction afterwords that only a ""BO-liever"" would.

Intercontinental Champion Bad News Barrett vs. Rob Van Dam - RVD came out of the box using his educated feet with various kicks & his vintage offense such as the corkscrew guillotine legdrop onto the barricade but Barrett ended up delievering some impactful kicks of his to RVD including one that sent him off the apron onto the barricade while attempting to ground him on the mat before RVD continued to use his educated feet as both men traded momentum attempting to use their signature maneuvers with some connection & others either missing completely or blocked allowing their opponent to take advantage of the situation.  This was a good match from beginning to end & Barrett's best performance in sometime dating back to before the ""Bad News"" gimmick months ago.

Last Man Standing: John Cena vs. Bray Wyatt - Bray had his followers Luke Harper & Erick Rowan at ringside with him as usual only for Cena to counter that with Jimmy & Jey Uso in his corner as well as Cena was able to get a shot in himself only for Bray to either counter or shrug it off & stay in control in the opening moments hitting big moves of his own such as the big splash in corner or one arm chokeslam before both men were able to execute big vintage moves with each man delievering as much as they were receiving such as chairshots & using the steel steps including one shot to the face to Wyatt that you had to see to believe as both men continued to fight both in & around the ringside area hitting their signature moves on the floor with the brawl continuing all the way to the production area with more than just the two ""legal"" participants having their bodies thrown through objects all around the arena.  This is one of those matches where if you can get past the end result then this was a really big back & forth brawl with great spots between all six men involved.

Divas Champion Paige vs. Alicia Fox - Paige began working over Fox's back right away with knees to the spine off what looked like a botched sunset flip followed by suplex from the apron into the ring & going back first into the barricade only for Fox to start showing her recent attitude change with fans & Paige giving a receipt with the barricade & trying to force her to submit with submissions moves.  Average match that was nothing special once it was over but I'll give them credit in trying to tell a story through wrestling & personality.

No Holds Barred/Elimination Match: The Shield vs. Evolution - Before I get started, apparently ""Bluetista"" didn't get the memo on what to wear for this match as he stuck out like a bodybuilding smurf leading to the funniest WWE related trend I've ever seen on Twitter.  This started right off the bat as a war with all six men fighting throughout the crowd & ringside area all the way to the stage before the action finally settled into the ring with each team having the same strategy of working over a member of the other team in their half of the ring either individually or through double & triple teaming with frequent tags with the action eventually breaking down once again into a huge brawl going all over the building with one man getting knocked out with what looked like a metal sheet while another body went through the spanish announce table to bodies were flying out of what seemed like nowhere including the top of the titantron along with bodies being punished with various weapons from chairs to kendo sticks.  While the other matches on the card I described as physical or a brawl, this was both of those descriptions as both teams were evenly matched throughout the contest making this match & entire feud up to this point come off as an all-out war between both teams with the factor of when the eliminations happened along with who was & wasn't eliminated I didn't expect.

(Pre-Show) Mask vs. Hair Match: El Torito vs. Hornswoggle - Long time NBA fans will get a chuckle out of the number reference on El Torito's jersey (they are in Chicago & he is a bull) as this match was just like the previous months' ""WeeLC"" match were it was here strictly for comedy with some funny spots involving not just the participants but everyone else involved in the match either at ringside or in the ring such as the referee's different reactions when Torito & Hornswoggle kicked out of a pin along with the commentators trying to get in every ""little"" joke they could.  It wasn't as good as last months due to the lack of ""plunder"" they could use but it served it's purpose.

Also on this show was the segment between Stephanie McMahon & Daniel Bryan threatening him to surrender the WWE Championship due to injury or have his wife Bree fired for shoving Stephanie weeks earlier.

This was one of those shows where I didn't expect much around half the card but overall this was a pretty enjoyable PPV as there wasn't a bad unwatchable match on here & not everything on here I would consider memorable but with the action from bell to bell very enjoyable so it's definitely an event I would check out.",1402272000,2,7206,4.503062787136294
6381557,5,B00JM5C8YA,"Full review at Metal Arcade. Net

Ive gotta say, I wasn't expecting WWE Payback 2014 to be anywhere near as exciting and well-produced as it ended up being. At a glance, half of the matches on the card bored me  I would never have ordered this event if I didn't have the WWE Network  but practically every match on the card ended up surprising me greatly. In short, WWE Payback 2014 was an incredibly strong pay per view.

Cesaro Vs Sheamus  US Title

Before Cesaro came out to battle Sheamus, Paul Heyman came out to fire up the Chicago crowd, making mention of Brock Lesnar, the Blackhawks and of course CM Punk (who would also be mentioned again later by Stephanie McMahon). This was a fast-paced, brutal fight that Cesaro had in the bag, before Sheamus surprised everyone with a small package roll-up for the win. My only grudge with this match is that Sheamus essentially no-selled Cesaros swing before rolling him up.

The Brotherhood Vs Rybaxel

I wasn't even aware that Goldust and Cody Rhodes were being referred to as The Brotherhood until this PPV, but admittedly I haven't had much time to pay attention to RAW and SmackDown these past few weeks. This match was fine enough, but didn't really hold my attention as much as the others did. Maybe because weve seen this match-up countless times before. Cody grabbed the mic after he was pinned for the loss, and told Goldust that he deserved a better tag team partner than him.

Rusev Vs Big E

Man, WWE loves changing things for no real reason. Do they really thing fans couldn't remember Big E Langston or Alexander Rusev? Now we have the oversimplified Rusev Vs Big E. Beyond that, Rusev debuted not very long ago as the Bulgarian brute, before they gave him Lana as a manager and now he resides in Moscow, and came to the ring waving a Russian flag. The Russia Vs USA angle is lame, though I certainly don't mind watching Lana talk. The match was largely forgettable, as most big man matches are, aside from an awesome spear off the apron from Big E to Rusev.

Bo Dallas Vs Kofi Kingston

This was a complete non-match, as Bo Dallas debut was cut short before it even began. The Demon Kane came out before the bell could even ring and chokeslammed and tombstoned Kofi into oblivion. No reasoning at all was given for this, making me question what the purpose of this taking up time on the card was. Bo Dallas gives a motivational speech to a completely unconscious Kofi, which was admittedly funny.

Rob Van Dam Vs Bad News Barrett  Intercontinental Title

Not a bad match at all, there was a bit of drama after Barrett hit his elbow on the ringpost making me think that hed lose this one. He sebsequently ate a DDT through the ropes and RVD got the near-fall, but Barrett kicked out and eventually nailed the Bad News Bullhammer elbow for the win.

Daniel Bryans Decision

Daniel Bryan has been recovering from neck surgery, and Stephanie McMahon had given him an ultimatum  if he didn't surrender the WWE World Heavyweight Championship so that the WWE Universe could have a fighting champion, she would fire his new wife Brie Bella. Brie told Stephanie that she quits, and then slapped Stephanie with the fury of 1000 woodland creatures.

Bray Wyatt Vs John Cena  Last Man Standing Match

WHOA. This match blew me away, which was completely unexpected. Both of this matchs participants nowmally put me to sleep, but somehow they captured lightning in a bottle here, with some impressive spots to create a truly memorable, awesome match  possibly the greatest Last Man Standing match of all time. Cena THREW THE DAMN STEEL STEPS at Bray from inside the ring at full force, and Cena eventually threw Bray through some sort of case near the entrance ramp, then essentially buried him with another giant case so that he couldn't escape the ten count. Great, great match.

Alicia Fox Vs Paige  Divas Championship

This was a pretty okay match, nothing really special but a decent showing for both participants. It was especially rough for a Divas match  in fact now that I think about it, this entire pay pre view was very rough. Im sure everyone has plenty of bruises and scrapes from WWE Payback 2014.

Evolution Vs The Shield  No Holds Barred Elimination Match

Next to the John Cena Vs Bray Wyatt Last Man Standing match, this was the best match of the night. In an incredible near-30 minute war, The Shield beat every single member of Evolution without losing a single pinfall. Just as epic as their previous match-up at Extreme Rules, this was a strong showing for both teams and a great send-off for the current line-up of The Shield. In case you missed Raw, Seth Rollins shockingly betrayed The Shield, beating both Reigns and Ambrose with a chair and siding with Triple H and Randy Orton after Batista quit, seemingly on hiatus to promote Guardians of the Galaxy.

Overall, WWE Payback 2014 was a hell of a show  memorable, surprising and completely brutal. It was easily one of the best PPVs that the company has put on in some time.",1401753600,,5003,4.638321995464852
6381558,4,B00JM5C8YA,"The United States title match between Sheamus & Cesaro was good even with the dumb finish. The Cody Rhodes/Goldust-Ryback/Curtis Axel tag team match was solid to say the least. The Rusev-Big E match was weak and short(not for the better this time). No Comment on the Bo Dllas-Kofi Kingston match because said bout never started when Kane interfered and beat the tar out of Kofi. The Intercontinental title match between Bad News Barrett & Rob Van Dam was a pretty solid back-and-forth bout. The Last Man Standing match between John Cena & Bray Wyatt was a hardcore,smash-mouth brawl even with the TNA-style inference. The Divas title match between Paige & Alicia Fox was so-so at best. The No Holds Barred Elimination match between The Shield & Evolution was slow at first but really kicked off when the ref stopped caring about the tags. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1401753600,,869,4.723684210526316
6381559,3,B00JM5C8YA,"Pre-Show match Hornswoggle vs El Torrito: proof that the booking was lazy at this ppv is that we had to sit through this match for the second time during a preshow. And the commentators tried to put this match as over as greatness as they do John Cena. El Torrito won and Hornswoggle got his head shaved.
  Now I truly believe they're trying to make Hornswoggle midget CM Punk.

  Predictable match 2: Sheamus vs Cesaro: Since Sheamus just won the U.S., it was too obvious he wasn't going to lose it already. And he won as expected but with a rollup pin.

  Predictable match 3: The Rhodes Brothers vs RybAxel: Cody hasn't been winning much at all. So was obvious they were going to continue that angle tonight. Cody got pinned by Ryback. Then got on the mic and told Goldust he deserves a better partner.

  Predictable match 4: Rusev vs Big E.: Big E. knocked him down a couple of times but it was obvious he wouldn't win. Rusev of course won with his camel clutch. After Cena is done killing Bray's momentum, he'll make his way to Rusev.

  Kofi putting over Bo never happened when for no reason at all Kane came out and attacked Kofi.

  Predictable match 5: Wade Barrett vs RVD: just like Sheamus it was too obvious Barrett wouldn't lose the belt already. Still this was one of the better matches of the night. Barrett won with a running Bull Hammer.

  Stephanie then came out wanting to strip Bryan of the belt or she'd fire Brie. Brie said she quit and slapped Stephanie. But am sure we'll still have to sit through Bryan stripped of the belt for the second time eventually.

  Predictable match 6: Bray Wyatt with Harper and Rowan vs Cena with the Usos in a Last Man Standing match: Both men tried hard to put on a great match and it wasn't bad. But you think the WWE would learn by now that putting an up and coming star against Cena breaks careers, doesn't make them.
  Just ask Ryback who has been on a road to nowhere after facing Cena last year at Payback. The Cena character is stale and played out. But sadly he announced he is the measuring stick of the WWE. So all new talent has to go through him.
  So keep Bolieving Bo but he'll kill your momentum before it starts. Cena beat Ryback last year by putting him through an ambulance. This year he beat Bray by AAing him through something as well. Then the commentators acted all happy and did their usual played out Cena praising.

  Predictable match 7: Alicia Fox vs Paige: people act like Paige doesn't deserve to be champ. Watch older NXT on Hulu. That was her earning it since NXT is the WWE as well. And she busted her butt there for awhile. So despite being predictable this is one match where I didn't mind. Paige won by submission.

  Evolution vs the Shield: the Shield won last time, so I figured Evolution would definitely win. But wow, one match out of 8 didn't have a predictable outcome. I was bored in the beginning with a one sided beat down by Evolution on the Shield that dragged on and on.
  Rollins made the match entertaining again when he jumped off the titan torn on to all 3 Evolution members. The match then turned around for the Shield. Batista hit the Batista bomb on Rollins and almost got eliminated. Reigns hit a spear on Batista and Rollins got the pin. Orton then hit the RKO on Rollins but then Orton was eliminated by Ambrose with his finisher on a chair.
  Triple H with a sledge hammer in hand was ready to fight alone but then got speared by Reigns who then got the win. If Evolution could put over Shield 2 shows in a row, why couldn't stuper Cena put over Bray ?

  In closing the show was only good due to the matches being good. But I wish they'd finally move away from all the sickening Cena pushing and brainwashing. It's like a slap in the face, having someone win they know we don't want to win. Then they have the commentators rub in our faces happily. Same ole crap and I am turned off.",1401667200,,3901,4.349030470914127
6381560,2,B00JM5C8YA,"1.) United States Championship Match: Sheamus (c) vs Cesaro w/Paul Heyman

We get a pre-match promo from Paul Heyman who immediately crushes Chicago's hopes of seeing CM Punk before bashing the Blackhawks and reminding us that Brock Lesnar conquered The Undertaker's undefeated streak at Wrestlemania. The match is amazing for an opening match! Sheamus gets the surprise win with a small package on Cesaro. Cesaro and Sheamus definitely match up well together in the ring and I look forward to seeing more matches between the 2 down the line

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) The Brotherhood vs Rybaxel

This was nothing more than a filler match to tease the split between Cody and Goldust. Ryback gets the win with the Shell Shock on Cody

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Rusev w/Lana vs Big E

Predictable match that sees Rusev get the win, making Big E tap to his camel clutch finisher. Rather than this be a match, perhaps this should've been a contest between the 2 to see who can look the silliest waving a flag. Seriously, Big E and Rusev wave the flags like they have mental problems or like the flags weigh 10 tons

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Kofi Kingston vs Bo Dallas

Another filler that never happened due to Kane coming out and obliterating Kofi after Kingston supposedly made some comments about Stephanie McMahon on Twitter.....according to Michael Cole

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Intercontinental Championship Match: RVD vs Bad News Barrett (c)

A decently solid bout between Van Dam and Barrett with Chicago being split down the middle between the 2. Barrett manages to retain with the Bullhammer on Van Dam

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Stephanie McMahon came to the ring and called out Daniel Bryan to make his decision. Would he relinquish the titles or would he get Brie fired. One noteworthy thing about this was Stephanie taking a shot at CM Punk---in Chicago nonetheless, telling Bryan that the crowd wanted him to quit just like CM Punk did. After a bunch of back and forth rambling, Stephanie prepares to fire Brie, but before she can, Brie quits and gives Stephanie the long awaited slap we've all been waiting to see since October. Stephanie runs off to the back, while Bryan and Brie celebrate in the ring

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Last Man Standing Match: Bray Wyatt vs John Cena

At Wrestlemania, Bray Wyatt tried to extinguish John Cena's legacy. Now he was trying to bring out Cena's dark side that he knew Cena had deep within him. After an attack on JBL and Jerry Lawler on Raw, this Last Man Standing match became more heated and more intense. Cena and Bray really take it to each other in this match and once The Usos and Harper & Rowan get involved, the extremity increased, dramatically. It almost baffles me as to why they didn't have this match at Extreme Rules instead. Steel steps being thrown and suplexes off the turnbuckle into a table at ringside are just a portion of what this match offers. John Cena obviously wins the match after slamming Bray into a box and pushing a crate on top of him to ensure he doesn't get up

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.)  Diva's Championship Match: Alicia Fox vs Paige (c)

After suffering her first loss to Alicia Fox, weeks prior in her hometown, Paige walked into Payback having to defend the title against the insane, Alicia Fox. The build-up for this match focused more on Alicia's new meltdown gimmick, rather than focusing on the feud itself, ultimately making this Paige's second PPV match that lacked proper build-up. Payback was obviously on Paige's mind to avenge her loss and that's what she got after making Alicia submit to the Scorpion Crosslock
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) No Holds Barred 6 Man Tag Team Elimination Match: Evolution vs The Shield

I really don't even think I can describe just how amazing this bout was. It started off slow but midway through it picked up and become a treat to watch. This match spills into the crowd and up to the entrance way, all while introducing several weapons into the match as well. There's a point in the match, where Roman's singlet is torn down and he's whipped across the back with kendo sticks that produce some red welts on his back. This match may have very well outdid their Extreme Rules match. Seth Rollins once again steals the show, with his Jeff Hardy like dive, this time from almost 30 feet in the air off the titantron. The Shield manage to stay together and take out Evolution one at a time, until they finish off Triple H to win the match. The most ridiculous thing about this match was probably Batista, who looked like a hideous blueberry, standing out with his Nikki Bella blue attire.

Overall: This year's Payback really wasn't all that special. It was better than last year's but not by much. Cesaro vs Sheamus was great, while Cena vs Bray and Evolution vs The Shield stole the show. Other than that, this PPV felt like an ordinary episode of Raw. Filler matches and lots of poorly booked feuds. In a way, this kind of reminds me of a lot of In Your House PPVs from the 90s that would suffer from the same thing. It's when PPVs like these happen that I wish the King of the Ring PPV was still around. That used to be a PPV that everyone used to look forward to. Maybe WWE needs to consider swapping out Payback and bringing back KOTR in 2015 because this is the second year that Payback has failed to deliver to a T. I give this year's Payback a 3/5 stars. If I could I'd give a 3 1/2, as I feel this PPV isn't deserving of a full 3 stars",1401580800,,6114,5.350364963503649
6381561,5,B00JM5C8YA,"First off, watched this event on the WWE Network.

Payback is once again live in Chicago. Is Payback going to be a Chicago exclusive event?

Pre-Show Match: El Torito vs. Hornswoggle (Mask vs. Hair Match)
  The fact that these two got to be on a ppv two times in a row while The Wyatt Family and The Usos haven't since Elimination Chamber and Wrestlemania respectively is mind boggling. The match itself was obviously not as good as their wee-LC match at Extreme Rules. Quick match and some nice high flying moves.
  Winner: El Torito  Grade: 2.5/5

1. U.S Championship: Sheamus (c) vs. Cesaro (w/ Paul Heyman)
  A great opener. These two beat the crap out of each other. Counters upon counters and nice CM Punk reference by Paul before the match. Very surprised with how the match ended.
  Winner: Sheamus  Grade: 4/5

2.  Rybaxel vs. The Brotherhood
  A nice impromptu tag match. Rybaxel looks better and better with each tag match. All 4 men were able to showcase their talent and nice tag team psychology from Rybaxel. After the match, could we see the end of a great tag team?
  Winner: Rybaxel  Grade: 3.5/5

3. Rusev (w/ Lana) vs. Big E.
  Lana looked gorgeous as always. Hands down Rusev's biggest challenge to date. Big E hit one hell of a spear on Rusev out to the ring. Overall, a quick match, but shows how dominant Rusev can be even with someone his size.
  Winner: Rusev  Grade: 3/5

4. Bo Dallas vs. Kofi Kingston
  All I can say is that this match never happened. Watch and you'll see what I mean. Can someone whip that smile off Bo Dalla's face? His song is so annoying.

5. Intercontinental Championship: Bad News Barrett (c) vs. Rob Van Dam
  The fans were into this match from the very beginning which made the match even better. This was another great title match and Van Dam did his usual dives while Barrett fought him down. Back and forth match and a nice finish.
  Winner: Bad News Barrett.  Grade: 4/5

6. The next part of the ppv was a segment between Daniel Bryan, Brie Bella and Stephanie McMahon. Stephanie calls out Daniel to surrender the titles or else she would fire Brie. Stephanie actually responds to the CM Punk chants and tells Bryan ""why don't you just quit like CM Punk quit."" A great segment. The end of the segment was sweet.

7. Last Man Standing: John Cena (w/ The Usos) vs. Bray Wyatt (w/ Wyatt Family)
  Hands down the best match out of the 3 they've had. This was an extreme, brutal and physical match. Some very nice spots involving everyone and I think 5-6 tables were smashed.  A great match that went over 25 plus minutes. A match of the year contender right here. Wish the other man had won though, but nice smart finish.
  Winner: John Cena  Grade: 5/5

8.  Divas Championship: Paige (c) vs. Alicia Fox
  Considering the amazing divas match between Charlotte and Natayla at NXT Takeover and the Last Man Standing previously, it was obvious these two were going to have to try real hard to get the fans into the match. This match was actually given almost 10 minutes which is surprising for WWE to give divas at a PPV. This was their best match out of all the ones they had since Paige debuted. A physical match and back and forth. Always good to see the Scorpion Crosslock (or the PTO -Paige's Tap Out) , but it'd be nice to see Paige win with another move.
  Winner: Paige  Grade: 4/5

9.  No Holds Barred Elimination 6-Man Tag Team Match: The Shield vs. Evolution
  This had to somehow overcome the amazing Last Man Standing match, but man, this match was even better then the one they had at Extreme Rules (and that match was a normal 6-man tag). This match quickly from the beginning went to the crowd and this match was just chaos. Everything from Kendo sticks, tables, a flat screen monitor, chairs to steel steps were all on display here. Some nice 6 man tag wrestling as well. #Blutista. ha. Anyways, great match and Roman took some serious punishment and another nice moment featuring Seth Rollins near the end of the match, although we didn't get any eliminations until the last couple minutes in the match. Very brutal match and again surpasses the match they had at Extreme Rules.
  Winner: The Shield  Grade: 5/5.

Overall, a great ppv that looked like it wasn't going to impress based on the overall card. Payback seems to be one of WWE's best B shows along with Extreme Rules and Money in the Bank. I highly recommend you guys check out this event.

PAYBACK 2014

1. US TITLE]SHEAMUS VS CESARO-the first match of the PPV stated out quick with both men going right at it. Like the commentary team points out this is a physical match with both men displaying power moves and brawling. Cesaro looks like he has this match won but after a big swing he gets rolled up and defeated being to dizzy. This was a great opening match between these two guys.

2. RYBAXEL VS GOLDUST & CODY RHODES-I am a huge fan of tag team wrestling and love both of these teams. I know most hate on Rybaxel but I think they are a great team for two guys who were not going anywhere solo after pretty good pushes. Anyway these two teams always have good matches in my opinion, maybe not classics but good. Although this match was basically to push the Cody questioning himself after the Rhodes boys lose the match it was still very entertaining.

3. RUSEV VS BIG E-now this was a physical match right here with two big boys butting heads. Of course this was played as a Country versus Country thing since Rusev is in the match. But both men looked to overwhelm the other with power. But the big moment of the match came when Big E speared Rusev through the ropes and onto the outside. Still even with that moment a kick to the face leads to a Rusev win.

Following that match we were scheduled to have a match between Kofi Kingston and Bo Dallas. But as things sometimes turn out in the WWE it did not go as planned. Right before the match starts Kane comes out and lays waste to Kofi, Bo is funny as always though.

4.[I-C TITLE]BAD NEWS BARRETT VS RVD-we are treated to another good match between two guys I really like. These two work well together as the action is fast paced and goes back and forth. The crowd was into this match chanting for both competitors. RVD looked like he was on the way to victory but it was not to be as BNB retains the title.

5.[LAST MAN STANDING MATCH]BRAY WYATT VS JOHN CENA-this match was excellent and full of spots. Talk about a fun brawl as not only do these two men go at it but the Wyatt family and the Usos go at it. All six destroy each other all over the place from the ring to the outside. This is a fight and felt like an epic match. There were finishers and weapons used throughout the match. I was going for Bray but I like Cena as well. The ending is good with Cena over coming Bray, I still feel that the wrong guy won this match but it was great.

6.[DIVAS TITLE]PAIGE VS ALICIA FOX-this was a pretty good and enjoyable Divas match. Good action but it was obvious that Paige was going to retain here, and she did. Still the ladies did their thing here.

7.[NO HOLDS BARRED ELIMINATION MATCH]THE SHIELD VS EVOLUTION-this is probably the best match on the card, this or the Wyatt/Cena match. These six guys go at it and just tear the house down battling all over the place. There are moments for each guy and for a while Evolution is just dominating. There are plenty of high spots from each guy especially Rollins. This is a crazy war that is never boring with The Shield eventually making a clean sweep of Evolution. Also I thought Batistas blue gear was fine.

BONUS

1.[MASK VS HAIR MATCH]EL TORITO VS HORNSWOGGLE-this was the match on the pre show and basically it was just a fun one. The reactions from all involved here throughout the match and after are great. Torito wind this one so Hornswoggle loses his hair.

You get some interviews as well for special features. Over all this was a really good event. In fact I would say great to be honest.",1409875200,3,3529,4.32375189107413
8652375,4,B00JM5C8YA,"With WWE Champion Daniel Bryan unable to compete due to a legit injury, the WWE had to improvise their card for Payback, which turned its focus to their other top feuds, Cena/Bray Wyatt and Evolution/Shield. This is first PPV in years that a World Title has not been defended and the first since TLC 2012 that the WWE Title hasn't been defended.

Not Worth Watching: Bo Dallas and Kofi Kingston didn't have a match when Kane attacked Kofi, Rusev and Big E had an aggressive match that was too short and featured the same three spots every Big E match uses, the Diva's Title match was nothing special.

Worth Watching: Sheamus defended the US Title in a bruising encounter with Cesaro, Barrett similarly defended his title against RVD in a hard-hitting encounter, and the Shield sweeped Evolution in a Six-man Elimination Match main event that was slower than the match at Extreme Rules but also seemed more violent and dramatic.

Match of the Night: in hindsight, Cena's feud with Bray Wyatt hurt Bray's character, leaving all the momentum he had from earlier in the year to diffuse. Still, these two got it right at Payback in a great Last Man Standing Match that featured cameos by the Wyatt Family and the Usos. Cena thrives in these sorts of matches and Bray proved he could hang with the best of them here.

Overall, Payback was a very good show with two excellent matches and two very good undercard bouts. Even the filler wasn't too bad; the on-going Daniel Bryan/Authority war turned into a solid segment here.",1408579200,,1518,4.716981132075472
