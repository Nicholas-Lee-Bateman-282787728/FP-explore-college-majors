4131107,5,B003JMJ5V6,"Having been a fan of Golgo 13 for many years, I've wondered why he's never gotten an animated series--yes, there have been two live action films, two animated movies, and video games--but you would think that for a manga series that's been running for over forty years would have had an animated series already.

Well, the wait is over.  GOLGO 13 is a hard-edged, mature animated series that hits the mark--no pun intended.  The stories are adapted from the original manga--including the first G13 story I ever read, ""Room 909""--and the animation is quite good for television.  Sentai Filmworks has also done a very good job with the dub, since most of the stories take place in the United States.  The series pulls no punches--Duke Togo, aka Golgo 13, is the best assassin in the world, taking out his targets with his modified M16.  Any contract he takes is ALWAYS honored.  He picks no side, he is the ultimate, amoral freelancer.  If anyone tries to betray him, he will kill them--no ifs, ands or buts.  Strangely enough, the best G13 stories are not so much about Golgo, but focus on his targets and those around him.

Golgo is a truly unique character, and those who want to indulge themselves in a hard-boiled, slow burn show should look no further.

I enjoyed these first thirteen episodes a lot, and I'm looking forward to the rest of this series that, honestly, is long overdue for one of manga's greatest characters.  Highly recommended!",1278028800,15,1448,4.748
4131108,5,B003JMJ5V6,"I've been a huge fan of the Golgo 13 series ever since I saw the subs online.  I've been craving to hear the english Dub and finally Sentai Filmworks brings it to America.  The series is filled with non stop action, no one can mess with Duke Togo.  The best sniper assassin to ever hold an M16 rifle. Can't wait for Volume 2!",1275955200,9,325,4.126984126984127

8398312,5,B003JMJ5V6,I have been a fan of the original movie and manga for years and years. I think that this series captures Duke Togo in a very traditional and faithful way. Just wish there were more of them.,1382572800,,189,4.135135135135135
8398313,4,B003JMJ5V6,"It's pretty good.  If it has a flaw, it's how high they crank up his sexual magnetism in some of the episodes despite possibly overdoing his coldness.  I realize he's mysterious, dangerous and in terrific shape and the best there is at what he does (shooting people in the head), but in many cases it's laughably bad.  He makes James Bond look like the homeliest assassin that ever lived.

SPOILERS

Prior to seeing these, my favorite Golgo-13 cartoon was ""the Professional"", which I rate at about 3-1/2 stars because (a) somehow Golgo-13 missed the special forces guy with his M-16 for no good reason (b) sometimes the weird camera angles get on your nerves (c) they tried to use CGI in 1983 for the helicopter sequence and have yet to update it so it looks worse than an old Playstation game (d) people routinely discharge firearms in public places and no one seems to care... somehow Golgo-13 shoots someone in a busy airport and casually strolls away and the same happens when someone tries to shoot Golgo-13 at the end of the movie.  But enough about the Professional.

There are 50 total episodes in the whole series (I own all 4 collections - first 2 collections have 13 episodes apiece, second 2 collections have 12 episodes apiece) and while half of them basically have some person telling the eponymous character ""I hate X, please shoot him in the face"", they're all somehow pretty good and keep your interest.  Some of them involve him pulling off shots that are ludicrously difficult.  Others involve him taking on another professional, and in some cases, someone is taking the fight to him.  In rare cases, the target is not even a person: my personal favorite was when the target was a single string on a violin during a concert.

One thing that I don't like about these cartoons is that he's cold... perhaps TOO cold to be likeable even as an anti-hero.  I can accept that he's not very social or cheerful because of his business, but I wish they had dialed it back a little.  In the 1983 cartoon's English dub (Greg Snegoff IIRC), he was clearly all about business and tough, but came across as more even-tempered and easy-going - especially when he was dealing with Rita.  In this one, Duke Togo is ALWAYS in full-blown creepy mortician mode.  That'll rub some people the wrong way.
Also, nationalism can be rampant in some episodes.  I don't think there's much overt racism, but occasionally you'll hear dialogue like ""at this rate, I'll have to call a professional, probably someone from Japan"" or something equally silly.",1373673600,,2541,4.714932126696833
8398314,5,B003JMJ5V6,I happened to come across this character originating in Japan named Golgo 13.  The idea behind this character is different from most and the stories are interesting. Who would have known that Japanese Manga turned animated series would be this interesting.,1365206400,,256,5.2439024390243905
8398315,3,B003JMJ5V6,I really like Golgo 13 so I'm not upset with the product at all. The disc plays but the packaging is damaged. There is a minor surface scratch . Could have been damaged in shipping or just sold damaged. I don't know why but I am Duke Togo this review. 2's.,1358899200,,256,4.03921568627451
8398316,5,B003JMJ5V6,"Although I do not own the DVD set (though I am planning on buying itfrom Amazon soon), my review is based on seeing the series online and downloading my favorite episodes on my MP3.

For the uninitiated, the series is based upon the classic, long-running Japanese Magna Comics and Anime films (""Golgo 13: The Professional"" and ""Golgo 13: The Queen Bee""). Often described by critics as a ""Japanese version of James Bond"", that's only a basic idea of who and what the character is.

GOLGO 13 is a professional hitman/assassin whose specialty is as a sniper and whose weapon of choice is a modified M16 Assault Rifle with a telescopic sight. Deadly, cold-blooded, and appearing to lack any morals, GOLGO 13 will kill anyone, any time, any place... for any price. Sometimes he works for the ""good guys"" (He's worked for the CIA, FBI, Homeland Security, the Police, INTERPOL, and MI6) sometimes for the ""bad guys"" (The Mafia, Drug Lords, Shady Businessmen). It doesn't matter to him. If the job is intriguing or challenging, he doesn't choose sides... If the price is right, he'll take the job.

Each episode (running between 25 to 30 minutes apiece) runs along two basic plot set ups. 1: How will GOLGO 13 pull off a job when the target and/or the shot itself appears impossible? 2: GOLGO will be placed into a situation where he may be captured or killed by the law or other criminals. The question is how will he pull off the job and escape? Only a few episodes stray from these set ups. What's most intriguing about the character of GOLGO 13 himself is because he's the epitome of the ""strong and silent type"" whose ""actions speak louder than words"", the viewer is often left to form their own opinions of GOLGO's thoughts and motives. It makes for a nice surprise when you learn what his intentions are.

The series is very much in the strain of ""Adult Anime"" in that each epsiode is like watching a R-rated (sometimes X-rated) movie. Episodes contain swearing, nudity and sex, and (of course) copious amounts of casual and gory bloodshed. Also, since it is a Japanese series, it is voiced in that language though the series does have English over-dubbing (The English voice of GOLGO may remind viewers of Kevin Conroy's dark voicing of Batman in the Animated Series and DVD movies) and English subtitles.

All in all, if you are not accustomed to Japanese Anime violence, the series may be shocking at first, but once you get past that, you will be left in jaw-dropping awe at the stories and the endings which can and will leave you going WHOA!!!!!",1332633600,,2550,4.683035714285714
8398317,5,B003JMJ5V6,"This is the best translation of the Golgo 13 manga into video form by far. Original stories from the past 40+ years of this epic series have been reproduced with great accuracy and attention to detail, down to the individual illustrations and storyboarding of the original series. The cinematic vision of Takao Saito is well-expressed and the animation is true to form.

Each episode is a nugget of awesomeness, putting a different twist on the same ultimate outcome: the victim is surely assassinated. Even though we all must die, it's the way we got there that makes things interesting. Well, Golgo is the grim reaper in human form. Don't stand behind him if you value your life.",1278979200,6,681,4.82051282051282
8398318,5,B003JMJ5V6,"I'll be echoing what the other posted reviews had to say, but if my chiming is helps to get more people to check this out I'm happy to do it.

I first heard of Golgo 13 a little over thirty years ago and have devoured what little of it that has been available in translated form, specifically collections of story arcs, the awful live action movie starring Sonny Chiba (I blame the script and direction, not him) and the two animated films, the fist of which is exceptional, so when I heard about this TV series around a year ago, I was dying to see it. A friend who runs an anime-themed import store in Manhattan recently hooked me up with some episodes that featured superb subtitles and I have awaited more ever since. The series itself is a flawless translation of Golgo 13 to television and the episodes I watched widely avoided long-form serialized stories and instead keeps things moving with briskly-paced half-hour stand alone stories starring the world's greatest assassin. This is great stuff that fans of espionage, suspense and sheer badassery will love, so please take the word of these reviews and give this a look.",1278288000,,1130,4.678391959798995
