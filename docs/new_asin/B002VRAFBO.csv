8382386,5,B002VRAFBO,I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone as it really helps to separate the reality of childbirth from the portrayals we see in the media.,1419638400,,144,4.576923076923077
8382387,5,B002VRAFBO,"I teach childbirth education classes at the county health department,  this video is the catalyst to class participating, invited thought provoking interaction and questions from both the prenatal and coaching students. Having requested the video several times as a line item purchase only to be turned down due to lack of funding, I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon and purchased it myself for the class. It has been everything I had anticipated and more.",1397606400,,469,5.090909090909091
8382388,4,B002VRAFBO,"I am a Natural Childbirth Educator and wanted a video to give to my students that would gently ease them into the REAL world of labor. The media is constantly depicting screaming woman out of control who act as if suddenly an alien possesed them and left them a strange life form trying to get out. Who then sadly, but loudly request the epidural after initially declaring they ""wanted to go natural"". Trust me I know all birth desires don't go as planned but what I am seeing today makes me want to scream. This video addressed the stupidity of mass media while making us laugh at ourselves for falling for it :) A wonderful first class video. Lots of discussion afterwards!",1336608000,,675,4.540983606557377
8382389,4,B002VRAFBO,"I facilitate Lamaze classes. Don't have time to show entire video during classes, have it playing during breaks. I show the last 15 minutes as wrap-up on final night. Monty Python portion is hilarious & precedes two great birth scenes.",1328313600,,235,4.9
8382390,5,B002VRAFBO,"I am a professor at Duke, a nurse-midwife and I am responsible this semester for teaching the undergraduate maternity nursing course. I used this video in my opening on day 1 to inform students about how today's childbearing woman and their families are influenced by the popular media. A discussion then followed about where the student's ideas about birth come from.... It is well done....and well worth the $$...it was a quick mail from the author to make it to my class in time. It will be a standard part on the opening day of the course. It is a great way to ease the students into the new content...and it showed birth....which was great for the first day. They can never seem to get enough opportunity to see birth. I liked that this video facilitated me beginning on the first class meeting. It replaces another one that I will move to week 5.",1285459200,7,852,4.538961038961039
8382391,5,B002VRAFBO,This film is 50 minutes of information and entertainment entwined.  It features many moments great for comedy if not for reassuring a pregnant woman and alternates them with scenes of peaceful and even ecstatic birthing.  A must for a childbirth educator and insightful and eye-opening for all!,1265500800,9,294,5.23404255319149
8382392,5,B002VRAFBO,"Interesting video essay about how various film images and TV shows have warped our perception of birth. In many cases, the images that we see in mass media are so ingrained in our culture, they have become our new reality. Vicki Elson also shows the natural childbirth videos and the other extreme that they present. In all, an excellent, must-view movie. I will be watching this one again and plan to include it in our Ottawa Baby Film Festival in 2010!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laboring-Under-An-Illusion-Mass-Media-Childbirth-vs-The-Real-Thing-DVD/dp/B002VRAFBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laboring Under An Illusion: Mass Media Childbirth vs. The Real Thing DVD</a>",1261526400,8,712,6.505263157894737
