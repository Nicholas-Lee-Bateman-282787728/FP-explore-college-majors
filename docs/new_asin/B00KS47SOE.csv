8661102,5,B00KS47SOE,The most amazing concert I've ever heard. An orchestra made up of 14 and under aged kids playing Maler's First Symphony and other sophisticated music as if they were the New York Philharmonic. They are great artists! The degree of concentration and the obvious enjoyment shown in thier playing was marvelous!! Cudos to El Sistema and may it continue to spread around the world!,1424476800,,377,4.90625
8661103,5,B00KS47SOE,"The National Children's Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela are an amazingly talented group of young musicians.  The youthful exuberance they bring to the five works in the concert make their performance a joy to watch.  Before the concert begins, we see in the audience Plcido Domingo, and Jos Antonio Abreu (the founder of El Sistema, also known as the Foundation for the National Network of Youth and Children Orchestras of Venezuela.  The orchestra begins with George Gershwin's ""Cuban Overture"", conducted by Sir Simon Rattle.  The musicians begin to bring choreography into their performance; the double-basses twirl their instruments, and the tempo is lively.

The second piece, Alberto Ginastera's Danzas de Estancia, Opus 8a, sees the violins and violas swell back and forth like lapping waves.  The clarinettists hold their instruments up high, the bassoonists alternate moving forward and back, and the oboists sway left and right.  The conductor for this work, Jess Parra (performing the day before his 19th birthday) skillfully keeps the young players together, helping them all bring electric energy to the music.  The little percussionist here is especially talented!

The Salzburg Festival was featuring the symphonies of Mahler, so it seemed fitting that the children's orchestra tackle the Symphony No. 1 ""Titan"".  Rattle returns to the podium, and you can see that he takes great joy in performing with these kids.  I couldn't tell you which is the best recording of the 1st symphony out there, but this one was done very well.  Yes, there were more instruments than usual present, but the intensity and focus of the work remained intact, especially in the final movement.

Rattle then has a little fun with the audience, asking them (in German) to chime in with the exclamation ""MAMBO!"" at the right moment for Bernstein's symphonic dance from West Side Story. (My only criticism for this entire disc would be that there are no English subtitles available for the concert; fortunately, they're available for the German-narrated documentary).  Once again, the children turn the work into a celebration, rising up and down and certain moments of the piece.  The encore, Johann Strauss Sr.'s ""Radetzky March"", is cheekily introduced by Rattle as ""a little bit of ethnic South American music..."", as he hands conducting duties back over to Parra.

The documentary and performance featuring Venezuela's White Hands Choir was, for me, the biggest joy to watch.  The left side of the stage (directed by Naybeth Garcia) consists of choristers with limited vision, learning difficulties, impaired mobility, mental disabilities, and Down syndrome.  They portray the emotion and beauty of the music through hand gestures, all while wearing white cotton gloves.  The right side of the stage features the ""actual chorus"", and they are expertly directed by Johnny Gmez.  At one point, on a break during rehearsals, an a capella group consisting of five of the vocalists breaks out into a piece called ""Vida Loca"".  The soloist of this group soared.

The concert performance by White Hands Choir consists of Latin-American folk songs, and choral works by Astor Piazzolla, John Rutter, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Ave Verum Corpus, K 618).  I was so moved by this performance and, once again, Plcido Domingo and Jos Antonio Abreu are on-hand to experience this incredible group of artists.  Highly recommended.",1410912000,3,3411,5.250922509225092
8661104,5,B00KS47SOE,"I have only had time to watch part of the Mahler 1.  How in the world can a Children's Orchestra play Mahler that well?  If you were to do a blind listening test I bet most professional orchestral players would think it is an adult professional group.  It is so incredibly moving.  To see middle aged Austrian males wiping away tears at the conclusion of the piece is a testament to just how touched they were by the power of the music performed by little kids.  If more children were involved in programs like El Sistema throughout the world one would think there would be few terror groups such as ISIS.  (Interestingly enough, a defector from ISIS said the group prohibits music and sports.)  This is an absolute must buy for anyone.",1410220800,,736,4.53030303030303
