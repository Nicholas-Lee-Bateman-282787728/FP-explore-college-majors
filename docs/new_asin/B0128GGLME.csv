7343652,3,B0128GGLME,"DVD Version.
Seems a rushed product. The songs are good, but they are too short, it is only the first verse and chorus in most of them. There is no Petra on the DVD!!!.
Also there is no intro on the DVD, it starts when a song (I would think was the introduction on the concert) is already finishing, with no fade in or anything, it just starts right there, and then the song ends and someone says something and Amy Grant starts singing.
Also seems rushed because the credits are wrong, I didn't check them all, but God's not dead doesn't list Daniel Bashta as writer, it says another name.
If it was something celebrating 40 years, it should reflect that.",1497052800,2,655,4.377049180327869
7343656,5,B0128GGLME,"have enjoyed watching.  I previously saw some of it on TV.  I enjoy  watching when there is nothing worthwhile on TV.  Russ Taft is one of my favorite gospel singer and the ""We Will Stand""  very uplifting. Many good artist on video, including Sandi Patty, Steve Green, Michael W. Smith, Steven Curtis Chapman, Evie and others.",1482796800,,326,4.75

7343664,1,B0128GGLME,"I bought this expecting the actual full show, but there are quite a few performances that were added, in replacement of a few others that were removed, based on both the iTunes version of this same show and youtube videos of the same show.

7343680,5,B0128GGLME,"If you saw the LIVE ""We Will Stand"", 40 year anniversary concert of CCM (Christian Contemporary Music) early in 2015, you will know what a FANTASTIC night it was combining a lot of history along with seeing some of those original artists (Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, Petra, Stephen Curtis Chapman, Love Song, Sandi Patti etc.) still performing. It was truly a night to remember and this is a MUST HAVE DVD for all lovers of CCM. Even our younger kids love this.

Important to note that this DVD does not contain all the footage of that night. If memory serves me correctly I think the original concert was 3 hours long! HOWEVER you do get a great selection and a real feel of that night. Experience Sandi Patti and Larnelle Harris performing together. See Petra who are no longer touring, performing! Don Francisco can still sing ""He's Alive"" as well now as he could back then! Stephen Curtis Chapman is on full form as is Amy Grant who is the first singer of the evening. Michael English sings Mark Lowry's 'Mary Did You Know' and there is SO much more.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND this DVD. Pssst.... If you want to read more of the history of CCM make sure you get Stan Moser's book, We Will Stand -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/We-Will-Stand-The-Real-Story-Behind-the-Songs-Artists-Executives-that-Built-The-Contemporary-Christian-Music-Industry/dp/1890236454/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">We Will Stand: The Real Story Behind the Songs, Artists & Executives that Built The Contemporary Christian Music Industry</a>

At the time of writing this review Richard and I are a Top 500 Reviewer which means that we receive a lot of product in exchange for reviews. This DVD was NOT one of them! We purchased this with our own funds. Irregardless, all reviews we write are our honest opinion. Thanks, Liz",1448755200,8,1835,5.277397260273973
