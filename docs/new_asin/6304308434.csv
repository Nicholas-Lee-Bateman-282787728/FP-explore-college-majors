840235,5,6304308434,"Review of A Patch of Blue
Hot Toasty Rag, November 14, 2017

A Patch of Blue is one of my favorite classic movies. There are so many wonderful elements to the film: a tragic script, fantastic acting, family tensions, a beautiful romance, suspense, humor, social commentary, fitting music, and above all, heart. Theres so much heart in this film itll be impossible for you to remain dry-eyed. But, although it is a heavy drama, its not so upsetting you won't want to watch it over and over. Ive seen it over a dozen times and I still haven't had my fill.

Twenty-two-year-old Elizabeth Hartman made her film debut as the lead in A Patch of Blue, and she was nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars in 1966. It was a terribly competitive year, with Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music and Julie Christie in Darling as her main competition. Ill leave it to you to pick the most deserving performance of the three, but its a very tough decision.

Elizabeth plays a young blind girl, and to make her eyes look sufficiently damaged to the audience, she wore special contactsbut they actually interfered with her ability to see clearly! She lives with her crass and cruel mother Shelley Winters, and Shelleys alcoholic father Wallace Ford. Elizabeth is constantly verbally abused, and she believes the insults her mother flings at her, so she sees no problem with acting as the housekeeper, cook, and laundress, even though shes unappreciated. She also strings beads, which bring in a meager side income for the household, and on sunny days, Wallace Ford takes her to the park so she can enjoy the fresh air while working. One day, she meets a kind man, and a slow friendship builds.

Sidney Poitier plays the nice man in the park. Elizabeth is extremely ignorant, and as she and Sidney become friends, he helps educate her, from correcting her grammar to helping her survive better in her blind world. If you don't fall in love with Sidney Poitier after watching A Patch of Blue, you must have lousy taste. Hes so incredibly sweet and kind, but hes also reserved because he suspects if Elizabeth knew the color of his skin, she wouldnt want to associate with him anymore.

Shelley Winters, in her own unique brashness that makes her utterly unlikable yet fascinating to watch, plays an ignorant, racist woman so convincingly, itll be tough to believe her in any other role if youve never seen her before. You might want to try A Place in the Sun or Night of the Hunter to see her in a softer role first before this harsh character becomes etched in your mind. She won an Oscar for her performance, but Sidney Poitier wasn't even nominated. Maybe the Academy wasn't ready to honor an interracial romance; in some Southern states, some of the scenes were cut from the theatrical screenings.

I cant stress enough how wonderful this film is. If youve ever felt alone in the world and ached for just a small gesture of kindness, youll love it. If you're a hopeless romantic, youll love it. If you appreciate movies with fantastic acting, or are a Sidney Poitier fan, or are looking for a new celebrity boyfriend, youll love it. Just watch it. Youll love it.",1510617600,,3148,4.652877697841727

840607,5,6304308434,"A Patch of Blue stars Sidney Poitier as Gordon (an implied reporter who is intelligent and black) who shows compassion to Elizabeth Hartman's Selina (a blind white woman from a dysfunctional family). The movie is based on an Australian book, but the more hopeful, empowering feel of the movie adaptation is preferred.

The 60's-made A PATCH OF BLUE is not so much admirable for its ""love is colorblind"" message, but because in an era that focused heavily upon African American victimization from and civil disobedience against segregation--and rightly so--this movie reversed the trend. That is, for a brief cinematic moment the white person is the helpless victim and the compassionate savior is black. The script goes out of its way to also show that Gordon is not doing this at the behest of a white superior, but first out of decency and always of his own free will.

The movie gradually develops into a touching love story between Gordon and Selina that (against contemporary cinematic and real life racial struggles) dares to even have both kiss. The romance is then realistically tested by racism on both sides. Shelley Winters's Oscar-winning role as Selina's reckless prostitute mother portrays the more stereoypical white racist view, while Ivan Dixon (as Gordon's brother) provides an interesting black racist view that warns helping anyone but blacks is an endangerment. In the book, Gordon's brother's fears turn true, resulting in a more typical segregated 60's ending. But, in another positive twist, A Patch of Blue's resolution is refreshingly more hopeful.

Since A Patch of Blue, there are any number of movies that feature minorities in authority helping or saving destitute members of the majority. But before, such diversity of characterization and plot were relatively scarce in mainstream movies; instead, they were more prevalent in literature (with the likes of ""Strange Fruit"" which was adapted to the stage). Movies like One Potato, Two Potato may have premiered before Patch of Blue. But its plot dynamic differs, as it deals with the complexities of interracial marriage. It also didn't feature an actor of Poitier's Oscar-winning caliber and clout to catapult it into mainstream consciousness.

So, A Patch of Blue is truly a groundbreaking mainstream moment that helped topple some age old Hollywood barriers to and concepts of race and onscreen empowerment. From then on, not only would Sidney Poitier find himself in similar atypical African American roles (ones that exhibited thoughtfulness and courage), but so would a greater number of blacks actors and actresses in Hollywood.",1454112000,,2615,5.248803827751196

Riveting, heart-wrenching, touching....I was drawn in from the opening scenes and didn't budge during this entire film, something that doesn't often happen. The acting of the entire cast was so good.

At times, this is a very difficult film to watch, especially the abusive nature of Shelly Winter's relationship to her now-blind daughter and the bigotry. But it was also a story of love, hope and redemption.

The relationship between Sidney Poitier and Elizabeth Hartman was warm, believable and touching throughout. I think they both should have received Oscars for their roles in this film too, in addition to Shelly Winters.

841122,5,6304308434,"I just saw this film on Turner Classic Movies.  What an impressive film!  What I would like to address here is the ending of the film.  I read the reviews, both of the film and the book, and some reviewers referred to the ending as bittersweet or that Gordon and Selina did not end up with each other.  So please, allow just a little indulgence from an eternally optimistic person who always sees the glass as ""half full - never half empty"" and a person whose favorite slogan is ""Forever Christmas Eve"".

In my mind, I do see a reunion of Gordon and Selena - even if it is only as the best of friends. Here is the basis for this opinion.  Selina cherished the little music box from Gordon, yet she did not take it with her when she left for the Blind School.  This was such a precious gift from her wonderful friend that she buried it in the park grounds for safe keeping - and I think - to keep the gift ""untouched"" and away from her miserable excuse of a home. And even when she dropped her gift while running away from her mother, she still went back to get the music box - it meant everything to her. If one leaves a valuable gift behind; then it makes sense that there is intent to return someday and reclaim the gift.  In the analogous sense, their friendship was just as precious and priceless.  So what person would not return?

Selina also knew Gordon's skin color.  Her friendship and love were unwavering.  She was going to go away for a year, which she thought was forever. I do imagine that she will return, a poised and intelligent young lady.  And yes, I am mindful of racial tensions that existed during that time period.  True friendship and love are without borders or boundaries.  And lastly, only a shallow person would not recapture the friendship (and the music box).  Selina was not shallow - her soul was beautiful and intact.",1361145600,,1850,4.381231671554252
841123,5,6304308434,"A Patch of Blue(1965) is a solid melodrama. The music score by Jerry Goldsmith is very good. Director Guy Green did a good job on the film. He used black and white filmstock to preserve the down to earth story. The late Elizabeth Hartman played Selena D'Arcy, a blind girl raised by a vulgar, abusive mother(Shelley Winters). Her only friend is Gordon, a black guy played by Sidney Poitier. The acting in the film is very good. A Patch of Blue was remade in Hong Kong as The Price of Love(1970) starring Chin Ping. That film swaped a black guy with a Chinese dwarf played by Teddy Robin Kwan. Some TV stations colorized A Patch of Blue to appeal to a ""broad audience"". The film does have some humor to take the edge off the story. A Patch of Blue is one of my favorite movies.",1360800000,,776,4.321917808219178

this is a 'must-see' for anyone who appreciates a director with such a deft hand on the subjects of 1960's racism and relationships that he pulls off the rare feat of story-telling without preaching. how was this possible for director guy green?  he also wrote the screen-play!

P-of-B is filled with poignant truth, gentle but hard won humor, and that Patch of Blue--HOPE.

Whatever your issue or relation may be, a genuine person will appreciate a genuine film.  Poitier played a simple role, but gave it so much justice.

  The end of the movie hits; with suspense, and you want to know the final decision?  Is Gordon's definition of love the same as Selina's?  Will Selina stay or go; will Gordon chase or follow through?  Either way, the movie plays itself out straightforwardly leaving the audience pondering what they would have done.

Back then, ushers actually ushered people to their seats and then we made sure our peers didn't trash the place or put their feet up on the furniture. While carrying out these duties, we watched the movies. Well, I saw A Patch of Blue 36 times while it ran at our theater, the Nora Theater in Indianapolis. I loved the movie each time I saw it. I was in awe of Sidney Poitier and sympathized with Elizabeth Hartman's character. Of course, I hated Shelley Winters, one of Hollywood's all time best actresses. And ""Old Pa"" was so pathetic. This movie is hardly ever run on TV. I'm not sure why that is the case because it truly is one of the best movies ever made. I once showed it to a high school film studies class, and when it started they were disappointed to see that it was in black and white. By the end of the movie, they knew what I would have told them if they hadn't gotten it: this movie, like To Kill a Mockingbird a few years before it, could only have been made in black and white.

It is the alternately touching and triumphant story of a 18 year old girl, Selina, blinded accidentally by her mother at the age of five.  Her daily existence consists of life in a dreary, run-down apartment with her over-bearing, abusive mother and maternal grandfather.  While both parental figures are anything but an upstanding example of people of character, her grandfather does possess a degree of compassion towards her.  Selina has managed without benefit of any formal education to emerge as a character of warmth, who like all of us really longs simply to love and be loved.  One day she meets an older, professional man Gordon who opens Selina's eyes (figuratively speaking) to an existence beyond the one that she has known all of her life.  There are complications (it's the 60s) because she is white and he is black.  I don't want to spoil it for you.  Truly an amazing, heart-wrenching movie that will leave you rooting for them both.

841253,5,6304308434,"It is February, Black History Month, which means tons of Sidney Poitier films on TMC!  I love this movie.  Selena is a blind girl, raised by her trashy mother and alcoholic grandfather, who lives a sequestered life in their tiny apartment.  She strings beads for a kindly man who occasionally walks her to the park, where she sits  under a tree until her grandfather remembers to pick her up at the end of the day.  Watching her struggles is heartbreaking.  She so longs to be outside that she doesn't drink anything all day so she won't be stuck having to go to the bathroom. Completely disoriented in any setting outside of her apartment, she is tethered to her tree. One evening, her grandfather leaves her in the park late into the evening while he is off drinking and she gets caught in a terrible rainstorm.  Still, she persists on going to the park whenever she gets a chance.  Her first day in the park, an insect falls down the back of her shirt.  She screams and the strikingly handsome Sidney Poitier arrives to help her.  An unlikely relationship follows. He is an educated black man doing very well for himself in the mid 1960's while she is a naive, uneducated low-class blind white girl.  He keeps his ethnicity a secret, and she frets he will find out what kind of family she comes from. Even though their affection for each other is ""blind,""  the question is: can that blindness overcome the realities of their day to day existences?  This is a wonderful film, with a sweet, heartwrenching soundtrack, superb acting, and a bittersweet ending.  Highly highly recommended.",1234310400,,1587,4.682310469314079

Yes.  I just think this film and even perhaps the story the film was based off on was trying too hard.  There's no real character arches for the characters.

Selina D'Arcy (Elizabeth Hartman) is a blind young woman starving for affection and the experiences life brings. She lives in a one room apartment with her Old Pa and verbally and physically abusive mother, Rose-Ann (Shelley Winters).

When Selina was five years old her father came home to find Rose-Ann with another man. They began fighting and in the battle Rose-Ann threw a bottle at him. It missed. And hit Selina in the face, blinding her. She's been sheltered all her life both from the outside world and people. She was never taught Braille or self reliance of any kind.

Her hunger for experience, of being able to run free through the park, enjoying the grass, trees, birds and open fields overwhelms and depresses her at the same time. One day she encourages Mr. Faber, a man she strings beads into necklaces for, to take her to the park so she can work there. Her mother is against any form of happiness for Selina and even beats her because she went out. This doesn't deter Selina. Especially since she met a special friend named Gordon (Sidney Poitier) there.

Gordon and Selina develop a special friendship, meeting under the same tree every day. Gordon is intrigue by her blindness and innocence. He becomes quite protective of her and begins looking into ways to help her leave her current situation and become self sufficient. Selina is warmed by his kindness and willingness to share the world with her.

One of the best scenes in the movie is when they are sitting in the park talking and she tells him about her first and only friend she had when she was a child and how she still misses her deeply. Her mother forbade her to have any association with the girl because she was black. This is a pivotal moment because Gordon hasn't yet told Selina that he is black.

Shelley Winters delivers an amazing performance as a royal... wicked woman who is determined to keep her daughter a sheltered slave. Winters won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for this role. Elizabeth Hartman was nominated for best actress and actually won a Golden Globe for ""Most Promising Female Newcomer"" for her performance of Selina. She made an amazing effort and I found her to be believable.

A Patch of Blue is based on a novel by Australian author Elizabeth Kata. Beyond the racial taboos its deepest theme is about one person doing something good for another with no expectations in return. This 1965 film was made in black and white which adds to the character of the film and the limitations and boundaries of the actors. The ending is left open to interpretation, I assume because of the turbulent racial times it was filmed in. I really enjoyed and highly recommend it. Reviewed by M. E.

841285,5,6304308434,"For those who may not ""get"" my title-""Broken Blossoms"" was a 1919 silent classic about a miserable poor white girl from an abusive family who finds friendship and understanding from a Chinese man amidst heavy bigotry against the Chinese.

Fast forward to 1965. Elizabeth Hartman is the white girl (whose absue is compounded with her blindness), Shelly Winters is the drunk abusive parent, and Sir Sid (Poitier that is) is the caring nonwhite man who beforends her. This film is actually based on another novel, but the similarities to ""Broken Blossoms"" are interesting.

It says a lot about what childhood abuse does to people. The film does a good job in explaining Miss Hartman's blindness, the roots of her insecurity around people, Sir Sid's ambivalence about his friendship with the white girl, etc. A good study in character motivation.

The scenes where Shelly Winters, her drunk pappy, an her ignorant partner in prostitution abuse Miss Hartman are heart wrenching without blood and gore and only minor profanity, which may have shocked 1960s audiences. The film also subtly shows the dirty looks that Poitner and Miss Hartman receives as he guides her to through the town.

Overall, some morals to this story could be-

1) Be kind to children.

2) Ignorant and drunken sluts should not have kids

3) Friendship and kindness can and does transcend racial and cultural barriers.

Probably shocking when it was first released, I would strongly recommend showing this to a high school social studies class and talking about it afterward (sorry, that's the teacher in me). It's a great conversation starter.",1156550400,9,1611,5.052830188679246
841286,5,6304308434,"This is a wonderful low-budget, black and white film starring a great cast of actors: Sidney Poitier, Shelley Winters, Wallace Ford, and then newcomer, Elizabeth Hartman. It was filmed in 1965, at the height of the civil rights movement, and was then notable for its budding inter-racial romance. While this aspect may seem rather tame today, at the time the movie was filmed, this was still a somewhat controversial theme in many parts of America.

Elizabeth Hartman, in an exquisitely poignant performance for which she was nominated for an Academy Award, plays the part of Selina D'Arcy, an eighteen year old blind girl who lives an isolated and impoverished, almost Dickensian, existence. She lives with her abusive mother, Rose-Ann (Shelley Winters), who moonlights as a prostitute, and her drunken, though somewhat well-meaning, grandfather, whom she calls Ole Pa (Wallace Ford). Uneducated, having never gone to school, Selina spends her time stringing beads to earn some money for the family, cleaning up after her mother and grandfather, and being at the receiving end of constant physical abuse and verbal invectives heaped upon her by her mother. Hers is, indeed, a draconian existence.

One day, she prevails upon her grandfather to drop her off in the park, where she proceeds to sit under a tree, stringing her beads. There, she meets a kindly, well-educated business man, Gordon Ralphe (Sidney Poitier), who takes an interest in her and her quick appreciation for any kindness done to her. She responds to Gordon's kindness as if she were a flower turning its face to the sun for continued warmth. He, in turn, is touched by her eager interest in even the most mundane of matters. They continue to meet under that tree as often as possible, and a relationship develops.

Under Gordon's tutelage, Selina begins to blossom. Some of her disclosures to him about her life fill him with horror and a determination to do something constructive about it. While he goes about trying to improve her quality of life, their relationship deepens, despite the warnings of Gordon's brother. After all, Selina is white, uneducated, and comes from a trashy, dysfunctional family, while Gordon is black, well-educated, and from a good family.

Selina, sure that what she feels is love, is less restrained than Gordon about her feelings, though their budding romance culminates in nothing more than a chaste kiss. When Rose-Ann finds out whom Selina has been meeting, however, matters come to a head, and Gordon comes to the rescue. A modern day knight in shining armor, however, Gordon does the selfless thing in the end.

This is a wonderful movie in which the two main protagonists, Gordon and Selina, judge each other by the content of their respective character and not by the color of their skin. Though controversial at the time, this film may seem a little dated by today's standards. Yet, some of its themes are as fresh today as when it was filmed. The notion of selflessness and putting the needs of another before one's own remains timeless. This is a concept, however, rarely seen in today's films.

Although this was Ms. Hartman's debut film, she deservedly received an Academy Award nomination for her sensitive portrayal of Selina. Unfortunately, her career never really took off after this film the way one would have expected after a performance of this caliber. She appeared only in a few notable films, such as, ""The Group"", ""You're a Big Boy Now"", and ""Beguiled"", before descending into virtual obscurity. I was saddened to hear that she committed suicide in the late nineteen eighties at the age of forty-five, a tragic figure in the end, leaving behind this beautiful performance for posterity.",1149379200,3,3714,5.021103896103896
841319,5,6304308434,"I never saw ""A Patch of Blue"" when it came out but I knew at the time that it was about an inter-racial romance.  Those topics were news back then.  I finally watched it last night and I was impressed with the way it handled the delicacy of its' controversy.  To be sure, the script writer gave the plot all the necessary help to be persuasive to the sceptics that came to watch.  The white blind girl came from a family that defined ""dysfunctional"" to an extreme.  The concept of the female lead being blind was not only convenient to the plot, it was great allegory.  Sidney Poitier was exceptional in a role that required strength and compassion.  It would take a cold heart and/or a numb brain to avoid being drawn into the compassion of the film.  Yet this is not some giddy ""Love Story"" but, rather, a serious look at what can happen when love breaks open a vacuum.  The director took a great script and amplified its' meaning in a close-up of two people from different environments who find each other.  Sexuality is subdued.  Indeed, its' periodic presence is in a negative perspective.  We are not looking at a climax but at a beginning.  By focussing just on the beginning, we are spared making judgement on whatever direction or misdirection may have followed.  No doubt that was a brilliant move for its' time but it also resulted in a brilliant movie for anytime.  In truth, the most impressive realization that I got from ""A Patch of Blue"" was how the movie's excellence allowed it to transcend the era it was created in.

841326,4,6304308434,"Astoundingly enough, director Guy Green is still with us and at age 92 his memories of making A PATCH OF BLUE are still crisp, almost visionary.  Usually I skip DVD commentary by directors and crew, preferring just to experience the picture without someone yakking off screen, but here it is worth a second viewing to understand the frustrations and finally the rewards Green (and producer Pandro Berman) faced in filming the novel, BE READY WITH BELLS AND DRUMS by Elizabeth Kata.  Though set in the deep South, BE READY was written by an Australian author who had never set foot in the USA!

She did a great job, but Green and Berman shelved the depressing vigilance ending of the novel and tried to tailor it for Sidney Poitier's personality.  At the time that screen image was of the perfect man who just happened to be black.  Kindly, radiantly handsome, strong, athletic, musical, a genius, Poitier's image was carved in stone at this point.  His interest in little Selena is painted as the gesture of a great human being for one of the poor unfortunate ones.  In return Elizabeth Hartman gives it all she's got.  I was reminded often of the scenes in Chaplin's City Lights, where the Little Tramp falls in love with a blind girl and hustles like mad to earn enough money to finance an operation that will cure her but which will inevitably destroy her love for him once she sees what he actually looks like!

Green also directed three US movies in the following years, none of which have arrived yet on DVD, and barely even on video, but all of them worthy of DVD treatment (hopefully with his memories attached): PRETTY POLLY with Hayley Mills, ONCE IS NOT ENOUGH with Melina Mercouri, David Janssen and Alexis Smith, and the incredible THE MAGUS, which is like BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS taken straight.

841327,5,6304308434,"They did an outstanding job of transferring this film to DVD and the 2.35x1 aspect ratio is how you want to see this; especially for the scenes in the apartment.  They must have found an almost perfect print (or the original MGM negative) because the DVD is as crisp and clean as any I have ever seen.  Because B&W relies so much on contrast and shadows there is often a problem with the old prints, but this well shot feature looks as good as it did in 1965.
It took me almost 40 years to finally see ""A Patch of Blue"". It was promoted as the kind of trendy, raise your social consciousness movie that I avoid like the plague. The mid-sixties was full of this kind of moralizing political stuff, as the country finally began to wake up to the embarrassing social inequities and the hypocrisy that hung over everything like a cloud of poison gas. The older half of the baby boomer generation was beginning to question the fear and hate of their parents, and Hollywood was beginning to discover that this had exploitation potential. Most of these things were moronic at the time and have not improved with age.

Ironically, what led to my finally viewing this film was watching Catherine Deneuve in another film from 1965; Polanski's ""Repulsion"". Writing a review of that film I lamented the failure of the Academy to nominate Deneuve for Best Actress and Polanski for Best Director. Whatever was thought then about the films and performances actually nominated, in retrospect they pale in comparison to ""Repulsion"". No one even gives a thought anymore to ""Darling"" or ""Ship of Fools"", ""Doctor Zhivago"" is more big that it is good, and Julie Andrews was great in a very weak movie (but decent musical). While ""A Thousand Clowns"" and ""The Collector""-with Samantha Eggar, are good cult films, they are easy to dismiss.

But when I got to Elizabeth Hartman's nomination for ""A Patch of Blue"" I realized that I knew very little about her or the performance, having dismissed it as just a reprise of Patty Duke's performance in ""The Miracle Worker"". I became more intrigued when I discovered that Hartman was the actress who blew me away in ""The Beguiled"", so I picked up a copy of the 2.35x1 aspect ratio DVD of ""Patch of Blue"". I was surprised to find that a film with the name of a color in its title had been shot in black and white.

After seeing ""Patch of Blue"" I still made my case for ""Repulsion"", but qualified it by saying only Hartman's performance was in the same class as that of Deneuve. Which was quite a concession for me but both performances are truly wonderful.

As for ""Patch of Blue"", I found it absolutely amazing-close to perfection. There were so many places where Guy Green could have screwed it up and he neatly avoided them all.

The director is presented with a real problem when deciding how to film an actor playing a blind person. Tight shots on the eyes are what makes acting for the camera so special. Unfortunately the unfocused eyes of a blind person cannot convey much emotion, in fact anything but a blank stare betrays the blind illusion. So Guy Green had to get a verbal and body language performance out Hartman that compensated for not being able to use tight shots, and Hartman had to work at not just playing a complex character but also at maintaining the illusion that she was blind. All her scenes are excellent but she has three that are especially memorable.

The first is at the kitchen table where she casually discusses being raped with Gordon. Her matter-of-fact narration plays perfectly with Poitier's horrified reaction.

The second is after a stranger has helped her back to the apartment from her terrifying failed attempt to find the park by herself. In a few minutes she ranges from despair so deep it verges on madness, to extreme gratitude toward the boy who brings her a message, to giddy joy at the realization that Gordon cares enough about her to send someone to see what has happened to her. Hartman plays all parts of the scene convincingly-I wonder if they shot it all the same day or if Green shot each sequence separately.

The third scene (and my personal favorite) is when she is alone in the park and it starts to rain. If someone told me of the challenges posed by this scene, I would not have given it much chance of success, yet Green pulls it off and Hartman is absolutely believable. The is the scene where you first really connect to Selena's fear and isolation, because by this time you know and identify with the character. Absolutely amazing.

Here is a little Elizabeth Hartman trivia. After Patty Duke turned down the role because of type-casting concerns and Hayley Mills for financial reasons (what a disaster that would have been), they tested 150 unknowns and choose the 22 year old Hartman. ""I believe I was lacking the things they wanted an actress to lack,"" Hartman told Sidney Skolsky when he made her the subject of one of his ""Tintypes"" profiles. After meeting her Slolsky said: ""She is shy, timid. She sleeps in a normal-size bed in sleeveless nightgowns. She always takes her Raggedy-Ann doll to bed with her."" Prior to Oscar night Hartman, who still lived in Youngstown with her mother, commented ""I'm just waiting for someone to offer me a part in a picture or a play. I'm climbing the walls, as a matter of fact"". MGM did not use her picture in their Oscar ads for her but used a sight gag, a pair of sunglasses in a Price Waterhouse envelope.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1111363200,31,5484,4.60655737704918

Gordon arranges for Selena to go to school, but she breaks off her friendship with him when she finds out she is black.

The shattering, tearful cliff-hanger of the novel was replaced by a simply, almost predictable, feel-good ending that makes the film flop miserably for someone who knows the original intent of the author.

I have been ""in-love"" with Sidney ever since .... he has such skill as an actor and has broadened my horizons so immensely with his portrayal of Gordon
Thank GOD for this medium which gives me an opportunity to say to SIDNEY FANS what I have wanted to say to him for  35 years....

""THANK YOU AND I LOVE YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME .....esp. in this film""
one very devouted fan from MELBOURNE AUSTRALIA",1061078400,11,1012,4.668539325842697
841380,4,6304308434,"Warner Brothers produced A Patch of Blue in 1965, which was a black and white dramatic film set in California, starring such greats as Sidney Poitier, Shelley Winters, Elizabeth Hartman, and Wallace Ford.  This film was quite racy for its time, as the movie's plot was centered on a budding relationship between a black man and a white teenage woman, which in those days was unheard of.
 Selina D'Arcy (Hartman), an 18-year old blind white girl, lives an isolated, Cinderella-like existence with her foul-mouthed mother Roseanne (Winters) and drunken grandfather, ""Ol' Pa"" (Ford).  Selina wants nothing more than to listen to the radio and occasionally string beads in the park.  It is there that she meets handsome black businessman Gordon Ralfe (Poitier) who sizes up her plight.  As Gordon conveniently continues to run into Selina at the park and their relationship grows.  He is delighted that he can teach Selina such everyday things as relying on her sense of smell, calling the pay phone operator, and pushing ""Walk"" just to listen to the traffic stop.
 It is easy to see why Shelly Winters won an Oscar for her portrayal of Selina's drunken and abusive prostitute mother.  As a viewer, I cringed with Selina every time her mother went on one of her tirades.  I still wonder why Elizabeth Hartman only received an Oscar nomination for her performance, because she truly portrayed the essence of her character.
 I give this film a four-star rating because I felt that the film accurately portrayed a 1965 interracial romance and addressed the subject of significant age differences between two people clearly drawn romantically to one another.  The film could be disturbing at times because it showed just how bleak life can be for a blind girl living in poverty with a truly dysfunctional family.",1060041600,10,1804,4.98
841381,3,6304308434,"A blind girl lives a life of squalor and abuse at the hands of her racist family.  When she meets the cool collected newspaper reporter she falls madly in love.
Sadly, he knows it can never be because she is blind and underage and he is black.  A fact he never mentions to her
As a book, told from the girls perspective, this idea works but when presented as a movie it instead comes of like the audience and the other characters are playing a mean trick on some poor woman.  While Gordon repeatedly bemoans the fact that she has been kept in darkness all her life and never taught to read or sent to school, he does nothing to provide her with the facts of the situation she is in.  Instead he dances around the subject while preaching tolerance.  Even in reguards to her own education she is never given the chance to make a choice or help direct her own life.
A classic in its day that just looks dated now.",1054080000,3,910,4.236994219653179
841382,5,6304308434,"Who cant help but fall in love with Selina D'Arcey?...This is a moving, bittersweet tale of forbidden love. A blind girl, who has nothing going for her, and lives such a bland, ...existence in the most dysfunctional of homes that you want to rescue her. And you'll want to throttle her abusive, rude witch of a mother, played by Shelly Winters in her finest hour.....but along comes her knight in shining armor, and shows her, well, just basic courtesy, which she's never known, and theres just something about the little blind girl at the park that keeps Sydney Pointier's character coming back. When he shows her compassion, and offers her companionship, she falls madly in love, and the poor dear is starved for affection, for all she knows is rudeness, and violence....The story draws in the viewer, and you start really caring about Selina, and want her to win in the end.....and the end will haunt you for the rest of your days.",1051574400,6,934,4.736196319018405
841383,3,6304308434,"Guy Green's tale of the love between a blind girl and a ""coloured"" man is no masterpiece, but it is sustained by two touching performances by Sidney Poitier and Elizabeth Hartman. Other characters tend to be flatly sketched and poorly acted (so Shelley Winters), existing mainly to propel the merely adequate narrative. Nevertheless, in its own way this tale is affecting, and there are a few evidences here and there of some directorial flair. The film is scored by Jerry Goldsmith, whose music is enchantingly simple.",1049760000,,519,5.046511627906977
841384,5,6304308434,"An amazing Sidney Poitier makes the most of his role as Gordon, a gentle spirit who comes to the aid of Selina (played by Elizabeth Hartman), a young blind woman who spends her days sitting in the park stringing beads onto cheap imitation pearl necklaces for a meager living.
As the story develops, Gordon comes to the realization that, as much as it may feel right, he cannot be with Selina, while the blind girl continues to be drawn closer and closer to this man who has introduced her to the world outside ... one vastly different from the one-room flat she shares with her abusive mother (Shelley Winters) and her drunken grandfather.
The film intelligently deals with the prospect of not only an interracial romance but also dabbles with the subject of significant age differences between two people clearly drawn romantically to one another.  There's is a romance much like ROMEO & JULIET ... two souls coming from vastly different worlds, wanting to be together, but forced apart by circumstances beyond control.
A wonderful journey of discovery for those willing to take the trip ...",1047859200,20,1092,4.870967741935484
841385,5,6304308434,"At last a favourite film of mine issued on DVD. What a brilliant release it is. A surperb print, as they say, and the wonderful suprise bonus of Mr. Green the director telling us how this film was made. What a good idea and how informative. Should be the standard for all DVD's.
The sad part of this film however, is the sad loss of Miss Hartman. What a fantastic debut she made in this film. One just cannot help but wonder what she could have achieved had she not died so young. Mr Poitier, a favourite of mine in ""In the Heat of the Night"", is just perfect. Miss Winters and Wallace Ford are a brilliant match as mother and elderly father.
All in all a fantastic little gem. Well done to all concerned.",1045008000,10,705,4.229629629629629

841436,5,6304308434,"For any Poitier fan this is a must see movie. A Patch of Blue portrays, I believe,  some of Poitier's finest work. The story is about a blind girl who has never experienced true and unconditional love and about a man who has been hardened by the intolerance of society. Together they find the beauty in this mixed up world, the protection and freedom that only genuine love could ever offer.",1018396800,,391,4.507042253521127

841439,5,6304308434,"I only saw this film a few weeks ago, and I still get teary-eyed just thinking about it. It's a movie that could never have been pulled off today and still evoke such depth of emotion. I felt every ounce of Selena's neglect, fear, bewilderment at the wider world, frustration with her very real captivity, and love for the only person that really loved her back. From the very first utterance of ""S'Lena,"" I could not help but get choked up for a girl who had never heard own name said but through a drunken slur. I only wish I knew what became of Selena and Gordon. And I think it's a testament to the power of A PATCH OF BLUE that I even care. This is a 5-star PLUS movie.

This is one of the best films you will undoubtedly see in your lifetime.  I read the book when I was 11 years old and didn't see the movie until I was roughly 16.  Let me tell you, this is one movie that does the book justice!
Disabilities, alcoholism, racism, abuse and neglect.  This movie has it all!  It touches on some very intense issues that our society was and STILL IS dealing with today.
Definitely a movie for the entire family.  Take my advice, watch it!  (repeatedly) (smile)",995846400,5,609,4.441441441441442
841442,4,6304308434,"My year Ten class had to read and study this book, and I just loved it.  When I found the movie starred the gorgeous Sidney Poitier, I was very  excited.
It is a great, great movie.  It is quite slow-moving, but that  only means it captures the emotions and intensity of the book brilliantly.  (Not to mention the actors had some part in pulling this off!) Poitier and  the young blind girl have fantastic chemistry.  Though the two lead totally  different lifestyles, they both know what it's like to live in a lonely,  heartless world.
This story really illustrates what real love is about -  loving someone for their soul, and doing what is best for that person no  matter how difficult it may be for both of you.  It is cute but terribly  sad when she noncholantly tells him that she's ""been done  over.""

This is a touching look at the societal mores that affect various factions of our culture:  the poor, drinking family that uses pain  to show affection;  the disabled girl who is innocent of so much of the  world;  the upwardly mobile black man who could lose everything in the  blink of an eye.
