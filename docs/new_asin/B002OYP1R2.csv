8376581,5,B002OYP1R2,"North Shore Nuggets has a cool soundtrack, it's a little long but the ""bonus nuggets"" and end credits make up for it! I especially like Kelly Slater and Chris Ward's parts. It was cool to see a few clips featuring the women surfers as well. Waiting for the sequel to come out!",1356480000,,276,4.326923076923077
