What I really like is that invisibility wasn't the equivalent of invincible in the film. The lead characters were smart, and responded in the way that you'd hope the police would do in a similar situation in real life. Of course, at the time it was a real combination of sci-fi and horror. Now it's still a good movie, but made all the more relevant because the US and Japan have scientists who've invented a real invisibility cloak. There's more work to be done on it, but it's only a matter of time. All in all, a nice little film.",1495929600,,645,4.47457627118644
