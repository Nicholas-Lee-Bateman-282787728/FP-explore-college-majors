Very funny and uplifting film, and the talk was it wouldn't make it to full distribution because it could be interpreted as making fun of religion.  I hope it gets released on DVD someday.",1223337600,6,310,4.421052631578948
222898,4,6300183165,"UFORIA is one of those movies that begs the question, ""Why didn't this film make it?"" I hope they track down the principal cast and crew members so they can release a Special Edition DVD of this fine, forgotten film. It's full of colorful performances and vivid local flavor, all wrapped up in a tidy comedic plot. Fred Ward is wonderful as the scruffy redneck Waylon Jennings wannabe and Cindy Williams is actually kind of endearing as his love interest. I recommend UFORIA highly.",1056672000,11,482,4.75

7804753,5,6300183165,"I was just thinking about this movie the other day for some reason (I saw it only once, back in the mid-eighties) so I thought I'd go looking for it -- maybe it's on YouTube, or Amazon Prime -- I was amazed this move is so hard to get!  I looked up the reviews -- Roger Ebert gave it 4 stars and the New York Times also gave it a very good review.  Unbelievable.  This movie is really a hoot, I hope that someone takes notice and releases it to cable or makes it more generally easy to see.  That's all I have to say!  It really made an impression on me at the time.",1450310400,2,566,3.8869565217391306

7804757,3,6300183165,Great little movie.  Cindy Williams is a scream as a would-be religious fanatic who falls far short of her goals.  Fred Ward and Harry Dean Stanton are also very funny.,1284422400,2,168,4.566666666666666
