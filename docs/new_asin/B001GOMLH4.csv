8306389,3,B001GOMLH4,"Soul Food was a great movie on a quality disc. I have yet to see Waiting to Exhale. The DVD is a piece crap--not because the person who sold it to me scratched it, but because the company that makes the CDs made the cheapest junk they could. The DVD player can't read it, and when you hold the disc up to the light, you can see through it, which is not supposed to happen. Thanks a lot, chintzy DVD production company. I even bought a brand-new copy from a store because I was worried the seller gave me a bad disc. Nope; it was a good seller.",1410912000,,543,4.037037037037037
