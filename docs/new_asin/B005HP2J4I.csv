8473364,3,B005HP2J4I,"This collection contains five TV western episodes from four different series, the only common link being the appearance of Robert Redford in each of them, all dating back to the years before BAREFOOT IN THE PARK and BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID made him a movie star. One of the episodes (""The Virginian"") is in color and is 75 minutes long. The others (""The Deputy,"" ""Whispering Smith"" and two from ""Tate"") are half-hour shows in black-and-white. Redford has small parts in two of them. He's a bad guy in three of them, a good guy in one of them and an angry young convict given a chance to make good in another. The prints and transfers are all quite good, thanks to being licensed directly from the copyright owner, NBC Universal. This isn't one of those TV western box sets from Mill Creek.

Redford is quite good in each of them, but it's only The Virginian episode, ""The Evil That Men Do,"" that gives him a central role, that of Matthew Cordell, a convict paroled into the custody of Judge Garth (Lee J. Cobb). The good judge, now a full-time rancher, has taken pity on the young man after learning he was raised in an orphanage and imprisoned since he was a teenager, and hopes that by giving him an opportunity to work and be productive in a nurturing environment, he can be properly socialized. The emphasis on prisoner rehabilitation was a liberal concept that was in vogue at the time the show was written (1963), but might have been frowned on seventy to a hundred years earlier when criminals like Cordell would have been dealt with a bit more harshly by the judges of the time. The situation might have been a little more challenging if the character of Cordell had been a little less handsome and charismatic, but Redford, who had a troubled past himself, manages to effectively convey the character's social awkwardness and distrust of other people. The story is reasonably laid out with just enough suspense as to whether the experiment will work or not to keep us engaged throughout. This is the best episode in the set.

In ""The Last Gunfight"" (The Deputy, 1960), Redford plays one of two hotshot young gunslingers who challenge an old gunfighter who's hung up his gun and refuses to fight. The two young guys spar over who will get the honor of outdrawing Johnny Dean (Charles McGraw), who travels from town to town under assumed names to avoid exactly such challenges. Henry Fonda starred in this series but makes only nominal appearances here, at beginning and end, while his deputy, played by Allen Case, tries to mediate between all the hotheads. There's a gimmicky but unsatisfying resolution that glosses over the death of a good man in a way I found somewhat heartless.

In ""The Grudge"" (Whispering Smith, 1961), Redford plays a young man groomed as a fast draw and expert shot by his angry mother who wishes to get revenge on Whispering Smith, a Denver lawman, for gunning down her husband, Redford's father. Smith even sits down to try to reason with Redford and explain his late father's outlaw ways, but the family, which includes a fiery sister (Gloria Talbott) who lures Smith into her room for a frame-up, is dead set on challenging Smith, so the whole thing is destined to end badly. Smith is played by western star (and war hero) Audie Murphy, in his only TV series. The inclusion of this episode is the reason I bought this set since I'm a big fan of Murphy and had never seen an episode of this series, which was based on an Alan Ladd movie from 1948.

""Tate"" (1960) was a short-lived show about a gunslinger with one arm and one shotgun. In ""The Bounty Hunter,"" Redford plays a foolhardy young man who accuses Tate (David McLean) of killing his father and provokes him into a showdown in the first five minutes. You can guess the outcome because that's the last we see of Redford in the show. A bounty hunter then pursues Tate and holds him hostage for the rest of the episode. In ""Comanche Scalps,"" Tate accompanies a friend, Amos Dundee (Frank Overton), back to Texas where, we eventually learn, Amos's younger brother, played by Redford, has married Amos's girl, leading to conflict between the two brothers. (This echoes, in a clever way, the plot of John Ford's THE SEARCHERS.) Both episodes are slow and talky, with very little action, but at least they have interesting guest casts. In ""The Bounty Hunter,"" venerable character actor Robert Warwick shows up as a way station manager. He was 81 at the time while his wife is played by Louise Fletcher, who was all of 25! Fletcher, of course, went on to win the Best Actress Oscar for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST (1975). Robert Culp, in his pre-""I Spy"" days, plays the bounty hunter. In ""Comanche Scalps,"" the Comanche warrior who leads an attack on the brothers' ranch is none other than the future Mr. Spock himself, Leonard Nimoy.",1341014400,5,4836,4.659250585480094
