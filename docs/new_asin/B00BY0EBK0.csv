5681545,5,B00BY0EBK0,"Again Universal did an awesome job on these movies and putting them in a wonderful collection. These are great movies, but don't expect too much War action. There isn't any special features and there is only English audio and no other language and subtitles. There are three disks with four on the first and three each on the last two disks. Two of these films were also released as DVD-R and now you can get them as straight DVD with no MOD. There are also two films that have never been released on DVD and now you can have them. All quality of the movies are quite good and I can't tell any difference from past releases. ""The Eagle and the Hawk"" and ""The Last Outpost"" were part of a TCM Vault box sets.

Here are the movies included:
The Eagle and the Hawk (1933/B&W/Full frame/68mins)
-Fredric March, Cary Grant, Jack Oakie, Carole Lombard; Directed by Stuart Walker

To Hell and Back (1955/color/Widescreen/106mins)
-Audie Murphy,  Marshall Thompson, Charles Drake, Jack Kelly, Gregg Palmer, Paul Picerni, David Janssen ; Directed by Jesse Hibbs

I have and will continue to collect and play back over the future weeks and months as MANY of these oldie sets as possible.  Just like the TV stations use to do one night a week, I set up a ""Fri or Sat night movie night"" for the family.  If we go out one night we stay home the other.  That night we show two or three oldies selected from our different collections.  This set is one of the collections and fits in nicely.  The kids complain about this or that movie, but that's all they get!  No regular TV (satellite dish)!  They almost always sit and watch!  I complained as a kid but what the heck, I got popcorn and a soda and Dad quietly explained the parts I did not understand.
These movies are (as a whole) just fine in their reproduced state!  MY purchase was as advertised and each movie was good at first playing.
IF you like the older movies & IF you want to add to your collection(s) this will fit in perfectly.  I plan to make a wood chest for all these collections instead of just having them ""on the shelf"".  Enjoy.",1419897600,,1106,4.184834123222749

You can purchase many of these movies separately (also from Universal), but at a much higher price. Several years ago I purchased ""Jet Pilot"" from another internet source and was very disappointed with the quality -- it was almost unwatchable. It looked like a transfer from a VHS tape.

Not so with these. They are very high quality. ""To Hell And Back"" is in wide screen and ""Jet Pilot"" is in full screen. Definitely recommended for any WWII film buff. By the way, if you like ""To Hell And Back"", you can also buy Audie Murphy's autobiography by the same name from Amazon.",1414800000,3,732,4.587786259541985

""Wake Island"" was one I saw 50 times on TV in the 50's, but it is as enjoyable as ever with Brian Donlevy as the Devereaux character ( changed in the movie) and William Bendix. It doesn't matter that the Marines finally surrendered at Wake, this one probably packed the recruiting stations in 1942. Rock Hudson as a British officer, The Duke flying high in ""Jet Pilot,"" Cary Grant in ""The Last Outpost"" and the ""Eagle and the Hawk.""

5681696,4,B00BY0EBK0,"Today I bought a terrific three DVD 10 movie set at Walmart for only a fiver.
This isn't some ECHO BRIDGE or MILL CREEK throwaway with a bunch of unrestored public domain films.
It's from UNIVERSAL, has crisp unflawed widescreen dubs (if the movies were originally)
and is called 10 MOVIES WAR COLLECTION.

Currently I'm watching a classic directed by Jo Stern, better known by his Hollywood name, Josef von Sternberg.
JET PILOT (1957) in widescreen Technicolor, was completed in 1950 and not released for seven years!
Perhaps that's how bad UNIVERSAL felt this story is.
Janet Leigh is a Russian defector who's actually a Soviet spy. With permission, she flies a Russian jet to the US where this secret agent who speaks perfect American English meets John Wayne and does something she never thought would happen: she marries him!

Meanwhile there's lots of aerial sequences with two fighter jets, supposedly flown by Duke and Janet. Chuck Yeager is really one of the pilots. It's a silly Cold War comedy and it surprises me to say I'm enjoying it!
(Cast includes Jay C. Flippen, Paul Fix and Hans Conried.)

(7.2) The Eagle and the Hawk (1933) - Fredric March, Cary Grant, Jack Oakie, Carole Lombard

""To Hell and Back"" is a must see despite never getting Audie Murphy dirty during the whole war.  ""Ulzana's Raid"" is a better than average western.  My favorite is ""Jet Pilot"" only because I served only about 2 yr after the perod of the film.  The flying footage is very good, and showed some aircraft now forgotten.

5681720,3,B00BY0EBK0,"To be fair, this is advertised as a ""10-Movie War Collection"". And it is that. These are not ""classics"", by any means, at least most of them. But they aren't advertised as such. They're advertised as a collection.

So let's evaluate them as a collection. The first is a real downer, much like Errol Flynn's Dawn Patrol. Don't watch this first thing in the morning. Or before you go to bed. Frederick March is outstanding, and Cary Grant's not bad either. But there is no humor in it whatsoever, unlike Wake Island, whose ending is that much more powerful because of the humor that had permeated the movie beforehand, primarily in the characters of William Bendix and Robert Preston. Even The Last Outpost makes for good watching, largely due to Claude Rains.

But then we have Rock Hudson as an English (?) officer battling Indians in India. We then have a biography of Audie Murphy, To Hell and Back, starring Audie Murphy, and while I admire Audie Murphy for his bravery, acting was, let's say, a challenge, and the movie is pretty much a yawn. Then we're treated to Rock Hudson again as a pilot in Korea. Not one of Rock's best. After that comes a romantic comedy, for god's sake, perhaps inspired by Ninotchka, but one of the silliest movies John Wayne ever became involved in.

Then the third disc begins with a movie I'd never even heard of: In Enemy Country. I actually googled this because it looked and sounded so much like a TV movie, the kind that Universal did in the 60s. But, no, it was released in theatres. Another yawn. This is followed by Raid on Rommel, which, while not Patton, sure beats the hell out of In Enemy Country. But at least it's directed by Henry Hathaway. Last but hardly least is Ulzana's Raid, perhaps the best of the bunch.

For a war collection, there's not a whole lot of war here. And lots of color. This is my own prejudice, but war movies ought to be in black and white. The war was black and white, metaphorically. And while I loved Patton, I suspect it would have been better in black and white. Can you imagine The Longest Day in color? *shudder*

So you've got four, maybe five, out of the ten that you may watch twice or more. Even so, three bucks a movie is a good deal, and the quality of the prints is excellent. Not Blu-Ray, but excellent.",1381622400,12,2289,4.466507177033493

5681722,5,B00BY0EBK0,If you like the old war movies you will appreciate that these movies are some of the lesser shown films mixed with the classics.  The recordings are in great shape and in my opinion well worth the price.,1376870400,,203,4.342105263157895
5681723,4,B00BY0EBK0,"Amazon did their usual great job of getting this collection out to me as I waited with baited breath! I already had a number of the movies included on these discs, but there were a few that may never see light of day again, so I decided to get this collection despite redundant topics already in my library. I can thin the herd a bit with this collection and pass on or sell the single copies now. The subjects cover war films mostly, WWII dominates, but there are WWI, post WWII offerings as well as British colonial (Bengal lancers) stories and a western covering the Apache uprisings of the1890s. The two films ideally wanted were both Universal offerings from the 60s and 70s. Richard Burton in the 1971 ""Raid on Rommel"" co-starred with out takes from the movie Tobruk..Burton has blond dyed hair to better match scenes where shots of George Pepard carry he action from the earlier film. Not original, but I liked the story anyhow. The movie I particularly wanted for years, and my main motivation to buy the set is ""In EnemyCountry"" from 1968. Agents and espionage and a team behind German lines to get info on a top secret Jerry acoustic torpedo is the plot here. Filmed on location in Southern California to stand in for the Baltic States in Europe...well, they used S. Calif. to represent N. Africa in the Rommel film....it works...that's whynHollywood is where it is!  Anyhow, the agents trying to get torpedo info wind up with a whole torpedo and decide to carry it to an isolated airfield (helped by Polish resistance fighters) where it's picked up by an Army Air Force B-25J and flown out as the film concludes....the B-25 is one I happened to work on for a little while in 1973 as a NASA engineer here in Ohio tried to get it up and airborne again. It was unique o see all the ""work"" the Universal Studio guys did to make the plane a movie star...the aircraft was sold to a museum to better fund and accomplish he work, and today the warbird flies as ""Briefing Time"", and I now have the film it appeared in. But, I have digressed too far...hey, get this DVD set if any of this appeals to you...you can't miss on it as long as you remember, it's all just movies.",1375228800,34,2174,4.476070528967254
