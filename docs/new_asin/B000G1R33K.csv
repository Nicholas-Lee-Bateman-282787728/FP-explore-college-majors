8128506,2,B000G1R33K,"I have been looking for this video/documentary for some time; I grew up in Queens, during the reign of the 7-Crowns. I ordered this video thinking I finally got lucky; the shipper instead sent ""Triple-H: The king of Kings"". I have contacted the shipper, who refunded my money, am presently preparing to return the DVD I received.
On a side note: It is my opinion, the shipper/seller should REMOVE the picture, and narrator, of the DVD: ""KING OF KINGS""; because it is misleading. Thank you.",1377475200,,489,4.764705882352941
8128507,5,B000G1R33K,"Well, I ordered this movie with relatively little knowledge about it, just the background story etc.

Which is, if you don't know by now: The 7 Crowns were, with the 5% Nation a gang that sold drugs during the Crack boom and at the head of the 7 Crowns were the Feurtado Brothers. At their height they would get 15 million a week and would have 1500 members. Times changed the Brothers went to jail and the crowns became legends. Now one of the Brothers made this movie to help work against drugs (seems like jail turned him around eh?) and inform about the drug laws.

Well, what you get is damn genius, interviews with celebrities, influential peoples, everything. The stories, the characters and the inside scoop. If you are interested in the real life Scarface, then this is the movie you want to get. They were living the lives of Scarface while the movie came out.",1127952000,3,870,4.535031847133758
