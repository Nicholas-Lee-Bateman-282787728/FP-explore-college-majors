568957,3,6303128610,"True fans of Horror who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s love this show. Even Stephen King, in his book DANSE MACABRE (p. 216 of the oversized paperback), calls this ""the best horror series ever put on TV.""
The show's host, Boris Karloff, is obviously no stranger to the horror  genre, and he co-stars in this particular episode, ""The Incredible  Doktor Markesan.""  The story is somewhat cliche--it basically revolves  around a mysterious, defrocked professor of the medical arts and his  vindictive postmortem experiments--and modern horror fans will probably be  disappointed in the predictable and anticlimactic ending.  Nonetheless, the  episode is notable and worth watching because of the wonderfully moody and  eerie performance by Karloff (as the professor) and a pre-BEWITCHED  performance by Dick York (as the professor's visiting nephew).",940636800,4,847,5.446153846153846

Even Stephen King, in his book DANSE MACABRE (p. 216 of the oversized paperback), calls this ""the best horror series ever put on TV.""  The show's host, Boris Karloff, was obviously no stranger to the genre, and  he even starred in several notable episodes.
This episode, ""The  Terror in Teakwood,"" tells the story of a pianist and composer who is  obsessed with proving to the public that he can best his late rival.  He is  eventually able to perform his rival's most difficult pieces,  but only  when wearing the severed hands of the deceased rival like a pair of gloves.  Of course, such gruesome acts ultimately lead to the jealous pianist's  demise....
This is a particularly eerie and morbid episode, so fans of  the genre should definitly find here those chills they seek.  Also worth  noting is that the episode was directed by Paul Henreid, who is well known  to fans of classic cinema as the actor who played Victor Laszlo in 1942's  CASABLANCA.",940464000,8,1026,4.653631284916201

He has brought back these people who were on the  staff of the University at which  Dr. Markesan  was employed. He is angry because he was thrown  off the  board of this school and wishes to hold his own private courtcase with the  people that were responsable for his being thrown out. The story is  interesting and spooky but is  predictable as to outcome.,926294400,,497,4.373626373626373
569061,5,6303128610,"45 Years later and I still shiver from the episode that I recall, again I believe with William Shatner, titled The Hungry Glass. A Haunted Story if there ever was one! I never looked at mirrors and wineglasses and windows the same!",1194998400,11,231,4.523809523809524
569062,5,6303128610,"One of the scarier episodes concerning a witch's curse, and one of the many that kept me awake nights listening to sounds I never would have noticed otherwise. I also loved The Grim Reaper starring William Shatner and Natalie Shafer (Mrs Thurston J Howell III) which revealed the horrific consequences of owning an old painting of Death with a curse attached, and The Incredible Dr Markesan which scared the living daylights out of me. This one went way beyond the usual horror of TV or movies and took the viewer right into a nightmare. Wow; even now, thinking about it, makes the hair on my neck stand up. One other, starring Brandon De Wilde, showed two young men driving in an out of the way place and needing shelter to spend the night...they picked the wrong house! This, like other series of the time, was beautifully done, with top quality actors and no skimping anywhere; each one is a little gem and stands on its own. When this becomes available, don't even think about it, buy it! You won't be sorry but invest in extra nightlights...you'll be needing them!",1183766400,21,1069,4.661375661375661
569063,5,6303128610,"I hope this will be available in typical DVD seasonal releases, because it, along with Twilight Zone, Outer Limits and Night Gallery is one of the best horror/suspense/fantasy series ever made. The stories morphed between horror-supernatural and crime-suspense, but many of them were among the best ever done on TV.  For example, the Robert Howard story ""Pidgeons from Hell.""  It is absolutely terrifying and probably gave untold thousands, if not more, nightmares over the years!  A great series that needs to be available far more than most of the DVD TV Season releases out there right now...",1175990400,19,595,5.11340206185567
569064,5,6303128610,"Actually, unlike the previous reviewer's discussion of the time slot for the original airing of this incredible and stylish weekly series, it was actually shown on NBC from 1960 to 1962 (2 seasons) and aired in prime time, 10pm, I believe. The early episodes were more suspense than horror because of a writer's strike in Hollywood, but after that all ""hell"" broke loose. In fact, The Night Watcher, a great episode, was the inspiration for Stephem King's long career. When this is finally available...order it without hesitation.",1171497600,16,530,5.103448275862069
569065,5,6303128610,"In the early sixties, along with ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Outer Limits"", there was this weird hour long anthology series hosted by Boris Karloff. While some of the stories were just suspenseful and some were tongue-in-cheek, many were outright grisly horror tales and some of them were pretty strong stuff for the era. In my area, ""Thriller"" was shown only late at night around 11:00 or 11:30 pm. Two of the strongest ones I remember were ""Pigeons from Hell"" and ""A Wig for Miss DeVore"", the latter starring Patricia Barry in a wonderful performance as an aging actress who acquires a most unusual wig. Karloff himself appeared in some of the stories along with Mary Tyler Moore (in a creepy one about a guy who collects mannequins), Elizabeth Montgomery (who did two I think) and a young Marlo Thomas who played the victim of a strangler in another one. Some of these were available on VHS but am looking forward to seeing a complete set on DVD. This series deserves new attention and preservation. It is responsible for many (I'm sure) wonderful nightmares.",1170460800,19,1055,4.802197802197802
569066,5,6303128610,"The Incredible Dr. Markesan is one of the finest episodes of a remarkable TV series (Thriller), and stylistically harks back to the days of classic horror movies of the thirties. Indeed, it was directed by Robert Florey, who was slated to direct the original Frankenstein (1931), till replaced by James Whale, who was ultimately responsible for casting Boris Karloff as the monster. Ironically, thirty years afterwards, Karloff and Florey at last got a chance to work together, and the result is a small masterpiece of horror.

The story concerns a couple who take refuge in the house of an elderly scientist who is related to the husband (an uncle maybe,--can't recall), who permits them to stay in his house, which is in fact a creepy, cobwebbed old mansion, provided that they never leave! As things develop, the couple does leave, and worse, they discover the diabolical nature of Dr. Markesan's experiments, which have to do with literally raising the dead. It's a strange, simple story, brilliantly told, featuring a small cast, with fine performances all-round, especially Karloff's as the eponymous doctor.

Technically it's on a par with most feature films, as it feels more like a movie than a TV show. The atmosphere is palpably oppressive, and the ""undead"" the doctor gathers in his library  each night are gruesome to behold. This is a grand, almost painfully suspenseful old-fashioned blood-and-thunder horror yarn, gothic in the extreme, and filmed in glorious black and white. For fans of such things it's a must-see. In my opinion it's an as yet unheralded classic that deserves wider recognition.",1114905600,2,1614,5.106060606060606
569067,5,6303128610,"I recently ordered three of these tapes from Amazon.com and I'm not disappointed. This one has great atmosphere, Boris steals the show of course. Dick York is great too. Nice shock ending. The subject matter was very uncommon for early 60s television, a rare living dead story. Ooops, don't want to give away the ending! Classic TV horror, one of the best. Pleasant screams!",1047254400,4,374,4.859375
569068,4,6303128610,"This episode is not as much fun or nearly as creepy as other Thrillers,but the acting is superb. This was more of an adult presentation~~no thunder & lightening & old,dark mansions in this one! Worth owning,tho'!",986601600,2,212,4.916666666666667
569069,5,6303128610,"Others may give this episode a ""so~so"" review,but I liken it to being trapped in a nightmare while wanting to run for help!

569070,4,6303128610,"""The Terror in Teakwood"" is a typical horror installment of ""Thriller"" in every regard.  The horrific and supernatural elements are presented in a matter-of-fact, Jacques-Tourneur fashion, with the primary emphasis placed on telling a good story.  Such an approach renders the frightening moments all the more frightening.  Whatever happened to this approach?
The story is an imaginative variation on ""The Hands of Orlac,"" with a dangerously obsessed pianist stealing the hands of his dead rival from the graveyard.  The pianist is played by none other than Guy Rolfe of William Castle's 1961 ""Mr. Sardonicus.""  Not the scariest ""Thriller"" episode, by any means, but scary enough.",980726400,2,680,5.438095238095238

7838664,5,6303128610,"THRILLER hosted by Boris Karloff has a new release date of August 31, 2010! I just contacted Image Entertainment and found out they are packaging the 2 season COMPLETE series on 14 discs- all 67 episodes for a price of $149.98. I'm hoping Amazon will have a better price! The series which ran from 1960 to 1962, will have bonus materials including series promos and still galleries, and I heard rumours that several people were interviewed for the series as well! I've posted the cover of the boxed set, so all of you can see how great it looks! Now, all we have to do is watch for Amazon's posting of it when it goes up for pre-order! This was the only television show that gave me and everyone I knew back in the sixties the worst nightmares we ever had!! It will be a Thrill to experience those nightmares again on August 31st!",1273017600,5,830,4.396103896103896
7838665,5,6303128610,"It is indeed good news that THRILLER will finally be coming to dvd.  Previously all that was available were lousy bootleg copies and that gorgeous laserdisc which featured half-a-dozen good episodes.

We could certainly do without all the silly and totally uninteresting commentaries by contemporary film people which are what is at present holding up the release.  Why the dvd people imagine we are the slightest bit interested in what a gaggle of modern hacks thinks about this classic show is something nobody can guess (does anybody ever watch these things?).  So we must patiently wait while they plod along recording their boring interviews with these nonentities and hope that the process will be speeded up so that the release will not have to wait a full year.

The 35mm negatives to the show are in fine, near-pristine condition so the transfers should look excellent, at least as good as the laserdisc, which used the same negatives.  The soundtracks, too, are in good condition.

This is a show where writing, directing, acting, music and photography all worked beautifully together.  Many of the episodes are blood-curdling and still every bit as effective today as they were when first released.  Many interesting directors worked on the series, including the great Robert Florey, Ida Lupino and ""One Step Beyond"" mastermind John Newland (it was Newland, in fact, who directed one of the very best episodes of all, the fabled ""Pigeons from Hell"").

This will be a treasured addition to any dvd collection.  Let's hope that the distributors accelerate the release.",1257552000,9,1577,5.097276264591439
7838666,5,6303128610,"Finally!!! Looks like it'll be released as a Halloween treat in 2010, complete with heaps of commentaries. Yeah, like everyone else, I recall this as the scariest TV series I ever saw. Hackles rising on the back of the neck stuff! Can't wait! But I'm so glad I didn't order one of the many bootleg copies. Universal has sublicensed the rights to Image Entertainment. Tim Lucas recently recorded audio commentaries for the episodes ""The Grim Reaper"" and ""The Premature Burial"" with screenwriter and film historian David J. Schow and director/cinematographer Ernest
Dickerson. Schow has been playing host on most of the commentaries while Larry Blamire is also getting in on the act! Word is that the set will include isolated music tracks for every episode!  Oh, joy... oh, Bliss!",1256774400,11,779,5.038759689922481
7838667,5,6303128610,"Like a lot of the others reviewing Thriller, I was 9 years old when I first saw it in 1960. I would sneak back down the stairs and peek around the stairwell wall to watch since it was well past my bedtime when Thriller came on. I was prone to nightmares anyway and my parents would have had a fit if they knew I was watching the show, then again they had to know since they caught me just about every week, usually early on when I got too scared and gave myself away. It helped because I can recall that they both sat there transfixed through the entire show, never talking while it was on and commercials were short and sweet in those days. But I frequently gave myself away with yelps of terror and fear, so I can only remember seeing one or two entire episodes, or nearly entire episodes.

One episode was the delightfully though morbidly funny episode called Masquerade starring Elizabeth Montgomery and Tom Poston. I recall having seen that one in total and loving every bit of it. Since another one stars Dick York (The Incredible Dr. Markesan, season 2), it is sort of a happy coincidence that Samantha and Darrin Stephens appeared on Thriller a few years before the great program Bewitched joined them as man and (witch) wife.

I recall the episode Doktor Markesan with extreme clarity. I made it through that program until the final scene when I blew my chance to see the ending by reacting like the scared little kid i was. Last night I saw that ending for the first time ever after about 49 years of waiting, thanks to YouTube. It was so creepy that I really felt the kind of fear that I felt at 9 years old.

SPOILER ALERT!!!

When Dick York, playing Boris' nephew (Boris played Dr. Markesan, the Uncle) goes back to the house only to learn that his wife had broken her promise to him to stay in the room until he returned, he races down to confront his Uncle ""Boris."" His Uncle informs him that now she must remain in the house forever, while he tends to 3 living corpses in his basement. When one of the corpses rises up and rips his life giving tubes out of his body and those of his comrades and brings the chandelier down on Uncle ""Boris"" apparently sending him back to where he belonged, dead. I lost it at that point and was sent to bed. I don't remember any nightmares probably because I stared at the dark ceiling all night. Anyway, last night I saw the very last scene which was Dick York's character's lovely wife closing her coffin lid on herself. With a very pallid complexion and dead eyes glaring at her husband as the lid closes and he screams. It was a masterpiece of horror, there is nothing today that can compare with this program. Not in movies or television, I think they are too timid to produce anything so frightening today. Please release this classic program on DVD soon! Maybe someone will be inspired to write/produce some truly hair raising, frightening programs like this show once again. It didn't last long, it was too scarey even for the Mom's and Dad's of the era. They probably had trouble sleeping with the lights off after Uncle ""Boris"" got finished with them too....

Oh yeah, I haven't even mentioned ""Pigeons From Hell"", oooooh, get me out of here fast!",1245456000,6,3206,4.464163822525597
7838668,5,6303128610,"ATTENTION: Spoiler Alert!!

I was 9 years old in 1960 and prone to nightmares so this show was off limits and actually past my bedtime. But I was fascinated by spooky shows and snuck down to the bottom of the stairs and peeked around the wall to watch this episode. My parents were rapt by the show and that helped me make it to the very end before they caught me. I remember every little bit of the program with the exception of Molly closing her coffin lid while Fred screamed. That was left to my interrupted imagination all these years.

Thank you Monster4josh (YouTube) for letting me see the entire episode. It was fun and you know, I don't remember any nightmares. I probably stared at the dark ceiling all night.

I recall seeing part of the ""Well Of Doom"" episode way back then as well but I think I was caught watching very early on. I recall thinking that the older gentleman (Henry Daniell) looked like George Washington. I didn't know who Richard Kiel (the murderous giant) was until a few years later when he played Jaws in a couple of James Bond movies.

There was one episode I saw part of that I would still like to see, though. I think it was called Pigeons From Hell or something like that. I got far enough in that episode to see one of the guys who were staying in the spooky old mansion come tripping back down the staircase with an axe in his head and gave myself away early on in the show by yelping out loud in fright.

I don't recall ever seeing any of these shows in reruns then or in all of the years since. Thank you for helping a 58 year old ""kid"" put some of his old demons to rest.",1245369600,,1613,4.224025974025974
7838669,5,6303128610,"Like others here, I, too, recall this marvelous horror anthology series, originally titled ""Chiller"" and later ""Thriller"". Though I was too young to see the original broadcasts, I do remember the reruns of several years later. Every Saturday afternoon, my mother and I, would sit, transfixed, before our black-and-white portable television as the eloquent and dapper Mr. Karloff would offer his eager viewers the week's chills/thrills. Although it's been more than forty years since I last saw ANY of these terrifying gems, I must confess that even now, gooseflesh is crawling up my arms in memory of ""The Reaper"" with his menacing scythe, and the irresistible lure of ""The Mirror"" -- both of which DISTURB me to this day! As a horror movie fan, I've always enjoyed the classic shows of this genre, including ""The Twilight Zone"", ""Night Gallery"", and ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"", all of which have finally made it to DVD! I can only FERVENTLY HOPE that ""Thriller"" will do so as well, and soon! Haven't we true horror fans waited long enough!",1234742400,7,1042,4.96

oh excuse me, i'm getting horror and horrible mixed up.
'thriller' was, for the most part, a tv series filled with horror but was definitely not horrible! that it hasn't found it's way on to dvd at this point is a disgrace when so many lesser shows have.
this show only ran two years, from 1960-62 with a total of 67 episodes; there was a strong backlash from parents who considered this series too extreme for their kids to be watching. they were right; i was extremely scared after watching most of the episodes. no other drama on tv at the time pushed the fear envelope farther than did 'thriller.'
my personal favorite was an episode called ""the cheaters"" which starred jack weston. about a pair of eye glasses that caused the wearer to see into peoples' minds and to hear their thoughts. warning: do not look in the mirror when wearing these spectacles.

Actually, any fan of Boris Karloff, the Thriller series, or fans of the Twilight Zone, or other supernatural/sci-fi series from this television era, would want to have Thriller on DVD! Please pay attention, Universal Studios!! There are already several sets of bootleg copies of the entire series (67 episodes) available. What does it take for a studio, or whomever owns the rights, to realize that the public wants and demands such a series to be made available on DVD??  I sucumbed to buying a bootleg DVD set of the complete series. The quality isn't real great, but acceptable. But by watching these episodes, which otherwise can't legitimately be purchased, makes me even more deterimned to voice my opinion in favor of a DVD release! (The bootleg copies seem to be made from broardcasts on the Sci-fi and Scream cable channels.) Wake up, Universal Studios!!  After releasing two seasons of Leave It To Beaver, you must realize that other than Alfred Hichcock Presents (which you've done a good job on for the first three seasons), Thriller with Boris Karloff should be your next priority for home DVD release!!",1199232000,10,1193,4.989949748743719
