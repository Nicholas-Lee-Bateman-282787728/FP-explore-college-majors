THIS IS ONE OF MY AUTISTIC SONS MOST FAVORITE VIDIOS.
HE HAS LITTLE SPEACH, BUT HE CAN QUOTE LINES FROM THIS VIDEO.
IT IS ROUTINELY WATCHE 20 OR MORE TIMES PER WEEK",1389052800,,210,4.410256410256411
2637935,4,B00000JQ8L,"It's got some cheesy stuff for the kids but heck, it IS a kid show.  Great for animal loving adults too!  Very funny.  HIGHLY Recommend!",1387238400,,136,4.36
2637936,5,B00000JQ8L,"My kids loved this, and I was glad to see it available. My six year old watches it over and over!",1368144000,3,97,3.6666666666666665
2637937,5,B00000JQ8L,"My 9 year old son has been watching this for the past 2 years and loves it, as well as does the entire family and friends who have seen it. The ""conversations"" between the animals are absolutely hilarious, yet this video is a wonderful learning tool for children of all ages.  Since I found this video, I'm odering 5 more of Marty Stouffer's vidoes.  Stay tuned for the reviews!",1003104000,2,378,4.463768115942029
2637938,5,B00000JQ8L,I love this movie and really enjoy watching it. It cheers me up very much and let see how the sweet little babies live their life in the nature and not only in the zoo.  Thanks to guys who did this funny movie!,971913600,2,210,3.883720930232558
2637939,5,B00000JQ8L,Great video for the kids!,1406764800,,25,4.2
2637940,1,B00000JQ8L,My grand daughter liked some. But the rest she lost interest completely. When I mean some it was the fox scene which was a 5 minute funny other than that it bored her. I don't recommend the dvd.,1406678400,,194,4.131578947368421
2637941,4,B00000JQ8L,My students enjoyed this movie. It would be nice for the company to do an updated version of this movie.,1402531200,,104,4.25
2637942,5,B00000JQ8L,Nice video to watch with children... no worries about anything that is not appropriate.. and children want to watch it over and over,1401667200,,132,4.782608695652174
2637943,5,B00000JQ8L,"My boys, who are now grown, grew up with this in VHS.  They always LOVED it.  My nephews who are much younger always requested to view this whenever they were in town.  I was so excited to see it in DVD, since I was worried about the tape breaking.  I ordered one for them and one for us.  Last time the boys were in town we all ate dinner in front of the movie and it was funny to see my adult kids and my nephews cracking up through out the movie.",1401321600,,449,3.8369565217391304
2637944,4,B00000JQ8L,"This is a great show for kids and the family to watch together. It's narrated so that the animals have a 'script'. They talk to each other, and do goofy baby things. A sure winner for kids, and even adults that love cute stuff like that.
The only thing that keeps me from 5 stars, is the playback is jerky. I know I have an older modem, but all other prime streaming seems fine--but this one program freezes a frame every few seconds, and then plays. freeze play. freeze play. The audio is fine, and the image catches up with it, but it's just really annoying.
My kid didn't seem too phased by it, because the show itself is funny--if the streaming issue is fixed, this would be the best!",1400371200,,688,4.3
2637945,5,B00000JQ8L,"As I have come to expect from Marty Stouffer, this was a truly amazing and entertaining feature. The photography is spectacular and the narrative was especially enjoyable. The video and audio streaming was seamless. A thoroughly enjoyable experience.",1400198400,,250,5.605263157894737
2637946,5,B00000JQ8L,Wonderful ....great for the whole fam..our kids loved every minute of it....the talking animals were very entertaining...it kept their attention the whole time,1398729600,,159,5.956521739130435
2637947,5,B00000JQ8L,"I will recommend this to my friends. I always enjoy Wild America, I will like Marty to do a new show.",1397606400,,101,3.857142857142857
2637948,4,B00000JQ8L,I liked it and would have loved it more if the commentary wouldn't have been so lame. But it is still a good show.,1390262400,,114,3.7916666666666665
8139735,5,B00000JQ8L,We love baby animals and enjoyed this video very much.  So funny we laughed out loud.  The voice overs were excellent!,1525478400,,118,4.571428571428571
8139736,4,B00000JQ8L,"Excellent, lovable video and voice over -- for kids. Read all the reviews, and you'll realize this. Wish it had been obvious on the cover, or in the description, or somewhere - that this is for kids. Marty wouldn't have suffered so many less-than-enthusiastic reviews.",1517702400,,268,4.977777777777778
8139737,3,B00000JQ8L,"This is not a regular Wild America like I remember from my childhood.  It is a bunch of cute footage of animal babies with a ridiculous voice over.  It supposed to be funny, like a cartoon, but it really isn't!  Go for the real show instead!",1433808000,,241,4.195652173913044
8139738,3,B00000JQ8L,Cute but narrating is annoying,1433721600,,30,5.2
8139739,3,B00000JQ8L,Was ok. The narrating got a bit too corny. Some cute scenes though.,1427155200,,67,4.230769230769231
8139740,3,B00000JQ8L,"Wild America is always good but I wasn't expecting the baby animals to have human dialogue. Great for kids, less so for
an animal loving adult with dementia for whom I bought it.",1419120000,,178,4.424242424242424
8139741,3,B00000JQ8L,"I remembered loving this show when I was a little kid, and it is definitely geared for children, but still very cute.",1413158400,,117,4.363636363636363
8139742,5,B00000JQ8L,My 7 year old daughter loves animals and really enjoyed this video. She said it was really funny (they do voice-overs for the animals ) and cute. I used to watch this series as a child myself and always loved it. So glad she can enjoy it too!,1412985600,,242,4.0625
8139743,5,B00000JQ8L,"Had gotten this as a VHS, replacing with DVD since we still love this movie",1410825600,,75,4.066666666666666
8139744,3,B00000JQ8L,"The babies are cute, but kids became disinterested.  There's a scene where animals are rubbing their bums on the ground trying to de-worm.  Really inappropriate for a toddler video.",1407974400,,181,5.206896551724138
