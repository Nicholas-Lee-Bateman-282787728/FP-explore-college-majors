8152122,5,B000JLTSIU,"After watching and falling hard for the Tamar Halpern documentary, ""Lyn Foulkes One Man Band,"" I decided to look for some of her other, earlier work and luckily came upon this little gem of a movie. The story is simple and small: it pits an uptight librarian, Elisa Bocanegra, against a rebellious new 'shelver' played by the always brilliant Betsy Brandt. But Halpern's wonderfully offbeat sense of humor, her willingness to embrace and confront the absurd, and her dogged desire to get deep inside what makes people tick is just a pure delight. Her rare, raw voice is not to be missed--in the Foulkes documentary, or in this.",1429142400,,627,4.814814814814815
8152123,4,B000JLTSIU,This is a haunting film and also quite funny. I was drawn into the subject matter and then wound up really getting involved in the story and original characters. The director has a keen sense of story and visuals. I think this is a great indie film and I wish Ms. Halpern would make more quirky films like this!,1395705600,,311,4.288135593220339

You should watch it and see for yourself!",1395273600,,107,4.4
8152125,5,B000JLTSIU,"This film totally captures my experience as a self-styled teen with a critical eye towards the establishment, dead set on defining what it meant to be a good person according to my own criteria. And it was great seeing Betsy Brandt from Breaking Bad in one of her earlier roles!",1395187200,,278,4.58
8152126,4,B000JLTSIU,"it was a very quirky, indie movie...funny in many spots...some was predictable...but the ending was a total surprise!...I liked it...it held my interest better than many blockbusters. Admittedly it doesn't have the same production qualities and ""look"" as most bigger budgeted movies-even other independent movies. However I give it credit for what it is. I bought it used...I may've been disappointed at a full 20 dollar price, but it is worth the 4 stars at what I'd paid.",1385856000,,473,5.076923076923077
8152127,5,B000JLTSIU,"If you like indie films with a little quirk, a lot of heart and a bunch of fun then Shelf Life might just be your thing.  I spent my summers at the local library's reading club as a kid and this movie reminded me how much I loved being amidst all those books...who knew what drama lurked behind the scenes!  Step over the head librarian and focus on Nikki (Betsy Brandt of Breaking Bad!) and Ronald (Joe Smith, the Cheez-its guy!) they draw you in and keep you there.  The director throws in some other great off-beat characters as well and plays everything with a big wink and a smile.  If you haven't seen it...you are way overdue.",1337472000,,633,4.338983050847458
8152128,5,B000JLTSIU,"A really smart, fun, and kind movie. Affirms that just because you're smart, doesn't mean you have to be a nerd.  And just because you're a rebel, doesn't mean you're not a compassionate person.",1295395200,,194,4.705882352941177
8152129,3,B000JLTSIU,"Shelf Life is one of those quirky, low budget independent films that succeeds some of the time. It's a comedy that ranges from silly to dark and there are some genuinely funny moments, though some of it is a bit like a sitcom. It involves a war of wills between uptight head librarian Betty (Elisa Bocanegra) and the rebellious new book shelver, Nikki (Betsy Brandt). Betty is a control freak who notices when one paper clip is missing, while Nikki dresses like a rocker and is fresh out of a drug rehab program. Joe Smith co-stars as the ultra-nerdy library assistant.

The plot is basically a series of mishaps between the two conflicting personalities. It is told in flashbacks, as the two recount their versions of events to an unseen mediator. This is a lightweight, not very deep movie whose characters are fairly simplistic, but I still enjoyed it. I prefer the rough edges of this kind of film to the more polished but thoroughly predictable typical mainstream movie. Though apparently filmed in the Los Angeles area, the feeling is more like a small town library. Shelf Life combines a kind of 1950s Main Street atmosphere with an underlying spirit of rebellion. The elements do not always gel perfectly, but the result is still interesting and mostly entertaining.

The listing for this film has the date 1992, while the information I looked up says it was released on DVD in 2006 and won some awards at Sundance in 2005, so I'm not sure if that earlier date is an error or in reference to a prior release. I'd recommend Shelf Life to fans of offbeat comedies.",1201392000,,1570,4.684782608695652
