8470111,5,B001N0MTUU,This is my favorite skate video. All the skaters are BADASS.,1505088000,,60,4.545454545454546
8470112,2,B001N0MTUU,"Straight up, this video was a huge let down for me. Don Nyugen's part was sick and he has the opener. After that though, each part is unbelievably forgettable with the exception of Corey Duffel. The skating is decent but there really isn't anything ground breaking in this video.",1470009600,,279,4.714285714285714
