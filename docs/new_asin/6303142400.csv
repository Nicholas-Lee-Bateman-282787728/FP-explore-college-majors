569923,1,6303142400,"Just another boring slasher film about a crazy man who looks eerily like George Lucas stalking people in a Cali forest. Music is beyond bad and the script paired with the acting is just awful, boring and been done better in countless other films.

569925,3,6303142400,"Two couples are planning camping trips, the wives planning one together, and the husbands one together. (Odd marriages, I see.)  Earlier, we see another couple on a hike, and after the husband is killed, the wife is chased around for a bit and killed off as well. (Evidently, someone's out there, killing--as if we didn't figure that out already).  Anyhow, the couples plan to meet up that night after the hike starts. But, as figured, someone is out there. Sharon and Teddie, the wives, are plagued by specters of some sort, until Teddie is killed, and Sharon is sent running. Then the husbands (whose names I forgot) meet up with someone in a cave, hoping to escape the rain, and they are offered some meat cooking over the fire. (Take a wild guess at what--or rather, who--it is) The man tells them a story about himself and his wife, and their children (which pretty much explains the ghosts) and soon the men are plagued by terror. Things go on as expected from there, as Sharon fights to survive in the woods, and the evil surviving man searches for her and Teddie, until the it's-been-done-before climax.

Not a terrible movie. The music is absolutely awful, and the acting is nothing to rave about, but it's still an okay film.  A couple of good chase scenes, but the first one of the evil surviving man going after Sharon after he kills Teddie was just too dark.  I couldn't see a thing. Now, maybe it was my TV but I don't know, it was still pretty dark. I preferred the day scenes. There were a couple of mild scares, but in the end, this is just another dull slasher with a few new twists. But, if you find it anywhere, check it out. It's barely entertaining, at best.",1211155200,4,1680,4.495081967213115

Besides the eerie feeling of this movie, and the plot, the movie really didn't offer much. I did like the back story on the man and the children and thought the way that sub-plot was worked in was good. The scene where the guys were (unknowing) eating their friend was pretty classic itself. Since it was a typical 1980's in the woods slasher I really enjoyed it. The opening scene was the best, it's too bad that it was also the bloodiest. Otherwise, the directing and the acting was pretty good. Some of the chasing scenes were very well done, and prett intense-- some of the better parts of the movie.

[the bad]

The movie had some really dull moments, and the cast (aside from ) weren't very likable, and I thought the ghosts of the kids didn't really fit into the movie. That addition didn't really hurt the movie per se, but it simply made the movie into more of a supernatural movie than a maniac in the woods movie. I also did not care for the ending, as it was not carried out very well and very close to being lame, to say the least.

[final thoughts]

One of the lost slashers of the 1980's, yet to be released on DVD. I really think with geat attention this movie could be put onto DVD with remastering, cut scenes, featurettes, and commentary and be a gem. It's not the prototypical slasher classic like Black Sunday and never will be, but it is a solid slasher with everything we love-- blood, cannibalism, really bad characters and really ditty girls. When I got this movie and popped it in, I was instantly drawn to the television, even during the slowest parts I never blinked an eye in fear of missing a beat.",1138665600,4,1643,4.409240924092409
569927,5,6303142400,"Being a Wildlife Artist involved in a Rain Forest series of paintings, I needed excellent reference. Without going back to the Rain Forests again, this video refreshed my memory of the beauty of the Tropical Forests. The Video footage was the finest quality that I have seen on any other video on this subject. The images were clear and breathtaking!
The intention of this video is for a relaxing journey into the Rain Forests of Costa Rica. The images of the dappled lighting through the canopy combined with the soft pleasing background music accomplishes its theme, to relax and take a visually beautiful journey. Wonderful footage of the flora and fauna , especially the Toucans,Macaws,and Hummingbirds, some of my favorite subjects. When you are painting a complex theme such as the Birds of the Rain Forest, you have to have the feeling for the subject. This video accomplishes that. I play this video often while I am painting. It makes me feel as if I were there.
Accompanying the video is a very informative booklet, that helps guide you through this awesome journey. It identifies all the flora and fauna you are veiwing along the way. The video is formatted like a day trip in the Rain Forest, not just random pictures. I know I will be ordering another copy, from wearing the one I have out!",992563200,3,1303,4.744493392070485
7838805,5,6303142400,"Look, all I know is that I put this video on (yes, I still own a functioning VCR - this title has yet to be released in the digital format) and my 3- and 4-year old (boy and girl) will sit and watch this obscure, half-animated, half-live action, vaguely European, badly dubbed, incomprehensibly plotted and overall WEIRD featur(ette - it runs just under an hour, minus the previews), and they are quiet, entranced and well-behaved during that time, and thank God for that (and thank you, Just for Kids! Video), which is a blessed relief for this overworked, sleep-deprived parent, believe you me.

Is it possible that this video is warping their widdle bwains? I don't know. Probably not any worse than the Yokai Monsters trilogy, those violent, racist old b&w Popeye cartoons, or ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die,"" all of which they are also big fans of, too. Yes, I will probably pay for my lack of foresight later in life in the form of psychotherapy bills, or attorneys' fees when the two of them go on a cross country crime spree.

7838806,3,6303142400,"This 1982 horror film features 2 couples who go camping in the wilderness and become
hunted by a cannibalistic hermit dwelling there. This isn't your typical horror/slasher
flick like ""Friday the 13th,"" which the beginning misleads. It's weird and amusing,
but it has sort of a unique yet eerie quality with nice settings and atmospheric score.
DVD picture quality is decent, but there's moments of speckles and print damage
considering the film is pretty old and shot on a shoestring budget, audio is clear
and extras include a trailer, commentary, short interviews and photo gallery.
I'd give this a try at least once if you're into horror.",1465430400,,642,5.009345794392523
7838807,3,6303142400,"I like the films of director Don Jones (SCHOOLGIRLS IN CHAINS; THE LOVE BUTCHER) and this one is no different, yet it is a slight step down from his earlier films. The confusing plot is about a crazed cannibal killer in the titled place who kills campers and cooks their bodies and eats them (don't look for any cannibal feasts, because there are none). His latest two camper victims prove difficult for the cannibal man (played by stuntman/actor Gary Kent [who uses the pseudonym ""Michael Brody"" here], who just released a fantastic autobiography SHADOWS & LIGHT), as the girl gets away and teams up with the cannibal's two ghost children (I know. I know.) to defeat and kill him. Like I said, the plot doesn't make much sense, but the film has atmosphere to spare and a few effective scenes. Not perfect, but an entertaining 85 minutes. Good luck finding the Code Red DVD at a decent price, though, because it has been OOP for some time (even the double feature that teams it up with DON'T GO IN THE WOODS, which was also released as a single Code Red DVD and is also OOP and demands big bucks). I paid $50.00 for this new, unopened DVD only because I am a Code Red completist.",1415404800,,1179,4.488372093023256
7838808,4,6303142400,"If you're just a casual fan of horror movies then i'd say don't bother with this movie. First it's pretty expensive and secondly by today's standards it's pretty tame and not really what modern horror movies are dishing out now. I personally don't care much for modern horror movies, I love the horror of the golden era which is when this was filmed.

If you're a great fan of horror movies and you find that you have more 1980s horror movies than any other decade than you need this flick. It's an under rated slasher film, which is possibly my favorite sub-genre of horror. I like the low production value and the acting is best as can expected. The story to me is where this film stands out. Maybe not so much the ""story"" but the added supernatural element. I'm not going to go in great detail and ruin anything but simply put if you collect horror films you need this.

Unfortunately this film tends to be priced very high. I have both code red releases of this movie and i found them for 2.95 each at a used DVd store. At that price it's a no brainer but, at 50 dollars or more then it's a more difficult decision.

7838811,5,6303142400,"I first saw this film on VHS way back in the day, my parents had picked it up at a yard-sale and my sisters and I gathered around our old TV, ready to enter a magical land...

What we experienced was: The Magical Forest. Humor. Danger. Terror. Bad Acting. Bad voice-overs. Dumb animation. And some serious ""WTF"" moments. In other words: we loved it.

We couldn't stop watching it. It was so bad it was actually good. I swear we watched it once a week.

Since those magic days of my youth, The Magical Forest has become a cult classic in my heart. I wish it was on blu-ray, but alas...its only on VHS.

Its the type of film you'd find an actual cult worshipping. You might find it in college dorm rooms. You might even find it at your grandma's house.

I wish this film would come to theaters in IMAX 3D. That would be amazing.

Until then, this VHS will have to do.

The story: 2 little girls join a cartoon frog, bug, and butterfly on an epic adventure. The gritty details of that adventure must be seen to be believed.

You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll pee your pants. You'll gag. You'll pretty much sh! t yourself, its THAT good.

Yep, its one of the greatest film epics of our time...so what are you waiting for?? Get yourself a copy, dust off that old VHS player, pour yourself a thick one and let the journey begin!",1351555200,4,1321,4.294354838709677
7838812,2,6303142400,"THE FOREST is a stupid and confused Slasher-turned-ghost-story about two couples who are stalked through the woods by a cannibalistic killer. The awful score is the best THE FOREST has to offer over its uneventful storytelling, bloodless murders, and idiotic characters. It is simply a bore to watch, and the supernatural elements plot elements make absolutely no sense. The ghosts of the killer's family come and go at various points, interacting with the characters who seem entirely unfazed by their existence. Thankfully, a few of the poorly scripted lines make for some unintentional humor and milk entertainment, but other than that, this is a bottom of the barrel Horror with no redeeming qualities. It is clearly the work of a talentless director looking to exploit the ""Slasher in the woods"" theme.
