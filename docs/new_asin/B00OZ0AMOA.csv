8685601,2,B00OZ0AMOA,"You won't mistake this for an episode of ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" or an hour with Charlie Rose. The host here is orchestrating a love fest with an audience of starstruck fans who contributed to the Kickstarter campaign that funded the feature film sequel to the cancelled series. A large part of the hour is consumed by the doozy musing of series creator, Rob Thomas. Thomas is a skillful story-teller when he has the time to formulate his plot and dialogue, but unlike Veronica Mars, he is not very quick on his feet. The host should have given Thomas his questions in advance, sparing the audience the rambling equivocation of Thomas' answers.  One of the challenges of film noir (or mysteries in general) is that the story advances largely by exposition, not action. In a medium that inherently relies on images and action to tell the story, film noir audiences learn most of the plot by being told what happened. Thomas skillfully makes Veronica such a charming rogue, watching her search for answers is, well...fun. Kristin Bell, whose appearances on Craig Ferguson's show were always fun to watch, has a disappointing air of noblesse oblige here, sitting apart from her fellow cast members, seemingly disengaged from the proceedings. If you like leafing through People Magazine, you will enjoy this. But don't expect David Mamet discussing ""Heresy and Common Sense for the Actor.""",1464652800,,1389,4.987068965517241
8685602,5,B00OZ0AMOA,Fun to watch; sad that series is over. Loved the movie! Creator spoke more than cast; really wanted to hear more from them.,1459468800,,123,4.391304347826087
8685603,3,B00OZ0AMOA,"It was great to see all the cast members interacting in a casual, candid situation, though I don't think the moderator asked enough questions or moved the talk along to cover as much ground as possible. While the discussion was a good length, as a fan of VM I wished it could have been at least an hour longer. Despite this, I truly enjoyed it, and am glad to have it part of my VM collection.",1453593600,,393,4.184210526315789
8685604,4,B00OZ0AMOA,"If you're a fan, this will give you insight into some of the relationships between the actors. It was fun and went by quickly, but mainly focused on the making of the reunion movie, so if you want to know more about characters (and the actors who played them) that were in the original show but not in the movie, you will be disappointed. I was left wanting more in that regard.
However, I loved hearing about how well they treated the fans who helped to fund the movie, and learning about the fact that if it weren't for the fans, the movie probably wouldn't have been made. The actors and writers/creator are all acutely aware of this and are still extremely grateful, which leaves you happy that you loved these people and this show from the very beginning. A great show to watch after binge-watching all the episodes, then the reunion movie.",1446681600,,845,4.529411764705882

8685607,4,B00OZ0AMOA,"It was fun to see the cast of Veronica Mars being interviewed.  I never watched Veronica Mars on the CW (though at that point maybe it was UPN).  I was so happy to see the series offered on Prime.  I binged watched it and than couldn't wait to see the movie.  I'm glad they made the movie to resolve the story line since the show never got a Season 4, but at the same time the movie was missing something.  I can't put my finger on what is missing though.

Don't let me dissuade you - do watch the Paleyfest interview and the movie - see if you think differently.",1431648000,2,563,4.072727272727272
