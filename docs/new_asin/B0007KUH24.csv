8047817,5,B0007KUH24,"This tape is one of my favorites - I didn't subscribe to the entire Columbia House VHS series back in the 90s.  This was the last tape I got.  ""In HIs Image"", the first of the 18 one-hour episodes, was probably the best of the 18.  Virtuosic writing, directing, acting, and production.  In the leads, Gail Kobe and George Grizzard are outstanding.  Absolutely stunning performances.  The episode reminds me of ""The After Hours"" by Serling, done 3 years earlier, in the sense that the set-up and tension are built layer by layer and then shockingly resolved at the conclusion.  With 30 additional minutes, there was a lot more time for the storyline to develop - and more story to develop - and this is the one of the few of the 18 episodes that succeeds on a great level.  Despite all of this, it is rarely discussed.  It's not anywhere near superclassic status, but should be.  The plot, in a nutshell, is about a man named Walter Ryder who constructs a duplicate of himself.  His duplicate, Alan Talbot, goes out into the world, and meets a girl and falls in love. Unfortunately, he realizes that he is seriously flawed and has no inhibitions - he is a murderer!  Charles Beaumont wrote the episode in 1962 based on his short story of the same title.  Beaumont was always my favorite TZ writer.  Perry Lafferty was the director and turned out a flawless product - undoubtedly one of the best of TZ episodes.  The other two episodes on this tape were lesser.  ""The Mirror"", starring Peter Falk, was a Rod Serling commentary about Fidel Castro.  The object of interest was a mirror.  It is a dark story with not much to recommend it.  ""Nightmare as a Child"" is an excellent episode from the first season by Serling.  Janice Rule and Shepperd Strudwick got star billing, but Terry Burnham was in fact the star.  The story involves schoolteacher Helen Foley (Rule) who comes home from school one day to find a cute 10 year old girl (Burnham) sitting on the steps outside her apartment.  Helen invites the girl in and moment by moment, Helen realizes that this child is someone she knew very well much earlier in life...the child is her. But how could it be?!  A question only to be answered in The Twilight Zone...and it got a very good answer.  Terry Burnham turns in an unforgettable performance that, lo these 55 years later, is still cherished by TZ fans.  Like the other two episodes on this tape, ""Nightmare as a Child"" isn't talked of much and has been endlessly criticized for being a pedestrian, ordinary situation that could take place at any time.  Indeed, the conclusion is weak, but as a whole, it is one of Rod's better episodes.  It's probably in my top 30, or 'short' favorite episode list.",1392854400,,2704,4.590814196242171
8047818,5,B0007KUH24,"IN HIS IMAGE is one of the best hour-long episodes from the 4th season starring George Grizzard. Good acting. The statement on humanity or more correctly the human experience is what is important here. The fantasy element catapults the human element and it is absolutely effective. IN HIS IMAGE demonstrates how the Twilight Zone one-hour episodes had their advantage where good writing and well defined characters helped pushed the narative.

THE MIRROR is a classic episode.

NIGHTMARE AS A CHILD is one of my favorites. I like ""Nightnmare As a Child"" and always did. In fact there is indeed a nightmarish quality about it. I thought Janice Rule was excellent as the schoolteacher Helen Foley who is haunted by the recurring image of herself as a child. These things actually happen and as we get older we often think back to things back in our childhood half forgotten and sometimes half remembered. I thought this was one of Rod Serling's better scripts.",1379980800,,958,4.907407407407407
