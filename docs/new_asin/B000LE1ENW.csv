8161642,5,B000LE1ENW,"Country music was not an interest during my ""swing"" days, but once I discovered ""Hi, I'm Johnny Cash have purchased most books and videos.  This particular DVD:  Johnny Cash:  Music in Review is highly recommended.",1231286400,,214,5.057142857142857
8161643,1,B000LE1ENW,"While I enjoyed the content of this DVD, it ultimately turned out be defective.  The disc froze and skipped in several places.  It did this on both of my DVD players and in my computer.  I returned it to Amazon.com and received a replacement.  Unfortunately, the replacement did the same thing and in the same places.  Maybe, when new stock arrives at Amazon, it will not contain these defects.",1223596800,,394,4.6521739130434785
8161644,3,B000LE1ENW,"I noted that the same reviewer gave this release a 5 star review and posted the same review on the 2007 release of this DVD. He lauded it for the 30-page booklet included, among other things. BE AWARE that the 2008 release is not the same packaging. There is no booklet. And no additional features other than a ""photo gallery"". That said, I'll now comment on the 2008 DVD issue.

The positives - The producers used important folks in Cash's career - members of his band in most cases - and got some great stories. Unlike many of these ""Review"" documentaries (all coming from the UK), there are less ""music critics"" as talking heads. And the footage included is stuff that's rarely seen. Taken from Danish TV, German TV, the BBC and even Polish TV! The quality of the prints is only passable but I've never seen much of this before (though no complete performances are shown).

""Cowboy"" Jack Clement, who was producer of ""Ring of Fire"" and played on many of Cash's records as well as other Sun records, is really funny. (There's a great DVD doc on Clement out there as well - on Shout Factory).

The negatives - Besides no booklet - which I didn't really need anyway - the MAJOR defect is that the DVD is not ""indexed"" and is one long hour-long track so you can't go back to find your place without fast forwarding through it. The copyright notices for each excerpt of performance are prominently shows at the top of the screen that I'm sure will annoy many viewers.

The 3 stars I gave were for the interview content and chance to at least see some of these non-US performances - though brief. Without this, I'd probably cut another star off the rating. True Cash fans will want to see this at least once. But don't base you purchase on the first 5 star review. It's a different package (and much less expensive).

8161645,5,B000LE1ENW,"Whether you are new to Johnny Cash or own every record he ever made, this contribution to the British series ""Music in Review"" is well worth having. The DVD is exceptionally well produced, chronicling with accuracy the many phases of Cash's career, from its Sun-rise with Sam Phillips to sunset with Rick Rubin's American label. Performances of many Cash classics are intercut with informative, sometimes hilariously risqu interviews with such important figures as W. S. ""Fluke"" Holland, Bob Wooton, and ""Cowboy"" Jack Clement. (The latter's encore performance of ""Hernando's Hideaway"" has nothing to do with the proceedings but is a madcap bonus suggesting why Cash loved having Clement around.) The delightful surprise, however, is the well-illustrated, 72-page booklet that accompanies the disc. More than mere liner notes, it fleshes out in some detail (and only a few errors) the artist's life and work without repeating what can be seen and heard on the disc.",1190073600,20,964,5.266233766233766
