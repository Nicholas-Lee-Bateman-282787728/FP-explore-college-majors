Although the product is advertised as a DVD one might make the assumption (as I did) that you fire up Maya on your computer and pop the training DVD it into your television's DVD player and go. Although that would have been ideal, the reality is you have to play this disc on your computer and so have to juggle screens in order to work along with the training sessions.

Strictly speaking it is a DVD, but it is a data DVD with a Shockwave shell that plays Quicktime movies. If you put the disc in your (PC) computer autoplay will bring up a screen that serves as menu. I have watched a bit of the instructional content and it seems to deliver what it promises, though the sound quality is a little noisy and there is a bit of an accent to get used to in order to absorb the content fully (and sometimes the sound quality complicates understanding).

In all fairness, the product is only $7 and it appears to provide some very good instructor-led content, something much-needed in this area of study, so my intent isn't to warn prospective buyers off of purchasing the product. I just think the vendor should be clearer about what is actually being sold so that there isn't disappointment and confusion.

Frankly the amount of effort it took to write a Shockwave shell to run this content was as much or more than it would have taken to pop all of the movie content into Nero or Roxio or Adobe Premier Elements or any number of accessible DVD creation applications and burned a proper media DVD with proper DVD menu. I'll be doing that for myself so that I can run the training on my TV next to my computer.",1200960000,,1806,4.3982035928143715

I then downloaded Quicktime hoping for success only to find none!

Once again, I own a dvd from some low budget studio that doesn't take the time for decent QC!

It's such a mystery why I really hate people :(",1196035200,,300,4.228070175438597
