8108363,3,B000ECX0BA,"It the typical ""how to"" DVD. It was good enough but learning in person is much easier than with a DVD.",1360108800,,102,3.9047619047619047
8108364,3,B000ECX0BA,A lot of extra chatter before getting to the nitty gritty and not as much instruction as I was expecting. Very basic.,1358035200,,117,4.363636363636363

8108366,3,B000ECX0BA,"Not really what I was looking for as I'm an advanced danccer, but it's great for a beginner.  Works on the basics pretty well",1353888000,,125,4.208333333333333
8108367,5,B000ECX0BA,"This DVD has easy to follow instructions for learning the Waltz, Quick Step, Tango, Cha Cha, and Jive. At first, I was hesitant to buy it because no one else had reviewed it and I have bought some dance instructional DVDs that weren't very good. But, my worries on this one were not justified! It is excellent! The two instructors show you the dance steps slowly at first (both men's and women's) and then take it up to tempo. They also show additional steps and embellishments you can add to make it fancier. I also like that while they do explain the steps, they don't just stand there talking while you're waiting to get started! They get started right away on each segment teaching you the steps. You can do this DVD with or without a partner. They are very good about specifying ""right foot"" and ""left foot"" and the men's and ladies' steps AND they show full body shots and feet shots (not close-ups of the faces like some dance DVDs...really we need to see the feet and bodies).
The DVD also has a brief written history of each dance and a short written biography of each instructor.
Just a note...the couple dancing on the cover of the DVD aren't in the DVD, neither is that dip pose.",1343088000,3,1191,4.442922374429224
