7569809,3,B019C6X40K,"While it's great to have this PBS special on disc, there's something about the mastering of the audio on this Blu-ray that gives it a bit of an echo as compared to the version broadcast on PBS.

The good thing is the effect only seems to affect the narration, not the musical sequences (the audio of the PBS broadcast did NOT have this issue, so it happened somewhere in the disc mastering process.)

I was, however, quite disappointed that the disc does NOT include the full, unedited acoustic video of ""(You Make Me Feel Like a) Natural Woman"" that PBS posted to their web site, so on-disc you're left only with the interrupted by narration clip that is part of the show itself.

Still, if you haven't seen it, it's well worth your time; personally I would not have purchased the disc if I had known the version of the above song included as an extra was not the unedited clip from the documentary as seen on the PBS website.",1461196800,6,927,4.4411764705882355
7569810,5,B019C6X40K,"Even if you think, as I did, that you know a lot about King & Stoller and about Carol King in the Tapestry era, you will learn much. James and Carly singing backing harmonies. Her live performance at the Troubadour interrupted by a bomb threat, etc, etc. Her daughter made some great comments, including that mom singing So Far Away while on the road was heard as being just for her alone. Several people describing her singing as being heard by the listeners as being just for them. I saw it 2 weeks before seeing the touring version of  Beautiful. Can't seem to stop the tunes In my head, but I've mostly stopped humming.",1459209600,5,623,4.464912280701754
7569811,5,B019C6X40K,"VERY interesting life story. LOVED every minute of this.  If you love music, and the songwriters that were game changers...you will LOVE this!!",1459209600,2,143,5.217391304347826
7569812,5,B019C6X40K,Have always loved the Carole King music and grew up with it.  The show was awesome!!,1457308800,2,84,4.25
7569813,5,B019C6X40K,"This 53-minute bio-documentary on singer-songwriter (whose career started in the 1950s BEFORE the designation singer/songwriter became fashionable) aired on PBS in February 2016. The home DVD adds (as a bonus) performances of four complete songs from her blockbuster album Tapestry that are only excerpted in the film.

Carole narrates part of the film and there are lot of interview with fellow songwriters Barry Man n and Cynthia Weil as well as her daughter (also a singer) Louise Goffin  who describes being left home when mom and dad were not there.

The film is obviously tied in to the recent Tony Award win for the Broadway musical Beautiful, but it stands on its own as a reminder of the long career that King has had.

If you missed it on PBS  or are a fan and want to see the four extra songs (that add about 10 minutes to the content)  I think youll enjoy this.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
