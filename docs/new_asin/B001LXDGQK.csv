3691706,4,B001LXDGQK,"The first Afro Samurai was a surprisingly fun and entertaining hip-hop-laced anime blast, and its sequel, Afro Samurai: Resurrection, is no different.  The story picks up with Afro (once again voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) living a life of peaceful solitude after getting his revenge, that is until Kuma returns with his seductive and deadly sister (voiced by Lucy Liu) to take the Number One headband, along with the corpse of Afro's father.  Needless to say, it isn't long before Afro wreaks another bloody trail of vengeance, with Ninja Ninja (also voiced by Jackson) in tow of course.  While not quite as compelling as its first installment, Afro Samurai: Resurrection offers more gorgeous and bloody animation along with a wonderful soundtrack from RZA, and its concluding moments are worth the price of admission alone.  The DVD set itself includes some great extras as well, including various behind-the-scenes segments and a look at the recently released video game, which in itself is also worth checking out.  All in all, if you enjoyed the first Afro Samurai, chances are you'll dig Afro Samurai: Resurrection just as much.  And oh yeah, make sure you wait until the credits are over, as it seems that Afro's journey will still be going strong in the near future.",1234483200,,1273,4.981132075471698
3691707,3,B001LXDGQK,"If you could compare the original Afro Samurai to a innovative new game, Resurrection is more of an expansion pack than a sequel. It opens up with a cliched depowering of the hero Afro and rehashes the original's plot with some twists. The quality of the animation is superb as well as the art. The music is good, but doesn't seem to be as good of an effort as the first one. Afro really doesn't go through any significant character development and by the end of the movie is right back where he was at the end of the last movie. Its fun for a rental but I regret buying it. Make sure you watch till the end of the credits for a teaser scene.",1233964800,10,642,4.144

The story of Afro Samurai, I must admit was very interesting; A Ronin samurai drifting to avenge the death of his father, somewhat clich but its still able to stand on its own merits. The biggest problem I have with the sequel is the existence of filler that is not necessary to the story line. The random act of sex, sex, and more sex, was almost like beating a dead horse with a stick. The border line porn was a huge distraction from the main focus of the plot, even with the trendy beats from the RZA, stylish animation, and the great voice acting. That being said, Afro Samurai Resurrection has its strong points; the soundtrack, the stylish animation, and the very commendable voice acting by Samuel L. Jackson and Lucy Lu; which all add to the overall experiences instead of taking away from it.  Buying the film on Blue Ray is the way to go to really appreciate all aspects of the production value. As far as the plot the goes, this direction of the story turns Afro into the villain by murdering a young boys father for the # 2 head band, similar to what Justice committed to Afros father. Which ends up creating a circular story that will never really end, which begs the question? ""What's the point?""",1233792000,2,1430,5.186147186147186
3691709,5,B001LXDGQK,"Afro returns and slices up the opposition again in this sequel. The animation is like nothing I have ever seen. An absolute must own for any fan of anime. Much more colorful and bloodier than the first, I was totally transfixed by the story and visual onslaught. Do yourself a favor....",1233792000,3,286,4.627450980392157
3691710,4,B001LXDGQK,"Afro Samurai has found vengeance, and has sworn off fighting. You didn't think that would last, did you?

Nope, it didn't. And the past catches up to the silent afroed warrior in a big way in ""Afro Samurai: Resurrection"" -- a wildly stylized, bloodsoaked, wildly anachronistic tale of what will happen after you get your gory revenge. And Samuel L. Jackson fits into the quiet, butt-kicking titular character like a hand in a fine leather glove.

Afro now lives in a temple where he meditates, carves little statues of Buddha, and thinks on his bloodsoaked past (cue wild flashback scene involving crazy ninjas and a river of blood).

That would make for a boring movie, so suddenly Kumo and the sexy, sadistic Sio appear, and steal both Afro's No. 1 headband and his father's remains. With his sword reforged, Afro sets out to reclaim the No. 2 headband so he can challenge Sio, and stop her from resurrecting his father (just so she can torture him).

But regaining the headband leads to a terrible cost -- a kindly man with a little son, haunted by the headband's bloody legacy. And the path to Sio's lair is riddled with grotesque henchmen who are very interested in seeing Afro dead -- and Sio herself plans to use a terrible weapon to destroy the man she hates above all else.

Like ""Samurai Champloo,"" ""Afro Samurai"" is a stylized story that wears its hip-hop trappings and period Japanese flavour like badges of honor. Or headbands. Whichever. The actual story is rather thin, but it carries a heavy message about revenge -- one you get it, it will haunt you like a bloody ghost forever and corrupt others along the way. Ninja Ninja provides a little humor (""I'm gonna die, man! Or at least have a stroke... I HATE HEIGHTS!"") but it can't lighten the storyline.

""Afro Samurai: Resurrection"" doesn't hold itself back on the fights -- neatly sliced bodies, fountains and rivers of blood, savage beatings and some really creepy cybernetic/masked baddies who are unafraid to get dirty. The highlight is a balletic nighttime duel between Afro and Shichigoro, surrounded by deadly chains and glowing lanterns, and framed by fireworks reflected in the water.

And it leaves the way paved for a third ""Afro Samurai"" story. I'm waiting.

Most regular actors are terrible at voice-acting, but Samuel L Jackson could easily make a living at it if he wanted to -- both the deep, gravelly voice (""Watch... your damn... MOUTH"") and the annoying jabber of Ninja Ninja. And Afro serves as an excellent anti-hero, who does some truly terrible things but is willing to pay for them.

Lucy Liu does a solid job as well, giving Sio both sensual viciousness and tenderness, and even a sort of moral core (""History will mourn the atrocities you now commit""), while Yuri Lowenthal and Mark Hamill have good small roles. And Liam O'Brian's gravelly/soft voice gives poignancy to his small but memorable role as Shichigoro.

The two-disc edition has a cluster of extras, mostly in featurette form -- a two-part making-of documentary, an interview with the creator, music composition, video game, commentary, and assorted other stuff. Mainly interesting if you really love the movie.

""Afro Samurai: Resurrection"" is a solid sequel that shows what happens when revenge is swung back at you. A good, bloodsoaked anime that opens the way for more.",1233705600,16,3328,4.872566371681416

3691712,5,B001LXDGQK,"It's afro samurai, of course it got 5 stars. They start with the action within 5 minutes of the start of the movie. If you thought you saw all the ways afro could kill somebody in the series, then you were wrong. I won't spoil it for you, but he has some new techniques.

I am surprised at how long the movie was, maybe it was the commercials. What i mean is, the plot of the movie involves afro's number one headband get taken, and he has to find the number 2 to challenge the woman who stole it. The quest to finding the number 2 wasn't too long, thats why i'm surprised.

Many of you will also be pleased that Ninja Ninja returns. Sadly there is no explanation to how he came back. He just says it was cold in his grave. He is still as funny as ever which helps make up for Afros lack of speaking, just like in the show.

There are over 4 ""bosses"" so you won't get bored.
The soundtrack was also very good, RZA is creative and pulls it off.

I had my cousin watch this movie before he watched the show and he loved it as well. Definitely worth the buy",1233273600,2,1054,4.028708133971292

3691714,5,B001LXDGQK,"Afro Samurai Resurrection is the follow-up to the mini-series Afro Samurai that aired on Spike in 2007 and in my opinion it is better then the original in about every way. First off the story revolves around Sio the new number 1 who steals Afro's dads jaw so she can resurrect him. Of course Afro is not happy about this and sets out on a quest to find the number 2 headband and defeat Sio so he can get his father's jaw. Along his journey he is rejoined by Ninja Ninja and also has to battle with others from his past. When he finally finds Sio he must also defeat his former friend Jinno and his newly resurrected father. The soundtrack by the RZA is imo better then the originals as is the animation which features more colorful backgrounds then the original. You also get more background on Sio then you did for Justice in the original. The only weak part is the ending which I thought was alot worse then the originals ending. Also look for the reference to the beginning of the original. Overall, this is a must see for fans of the original and even if your not a fan you still should check this movie out.",1232928000,,1112,4.3

3691747,5,B001LXDGQK,"Samuel L Jackson in his finest anime movie ever!! here is my review!!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers) The story takes place after the Afro Samurai TV series, Afro is dreaming of getting attacked by two samurai who want his number 1 head band, when he defeats the two he wakes up. Then he is attacked in the real world, where the attackers defeat Afro Samurai, take his #1 headband and leave him the #2 headband then they dig up Afro's fathers Rokutaro's grave and steal his body. The the leader of the attackers tells Afro they will resurrect Rokutaro from the dead to punish Afro even more. So Afro goes on the adventure with his inner self Ninja Ninja (voiced by Samuel L Jackson!) to defeat the stealer of his headband and defeat the evil version of his father then recalim the #1 headband to show he is the most badass fighter ever!

Pros: The story is first rate again! good as always! If you loved the music from the TV show then rejoice! RZA does the music to make it feel even better. Because this is the Directors Cut version of the show, this version shows the Japanese version which is 10 minuets longer than the edited American version. Also because this is Directors Cut this version is UNCUT and UNCENSORED so you hear all the swearing, the action, the blood and everything else regular tv would censor! yeah uncensored!!! :D . This version also comes with an art book to show sketches from the creator of the show which is nice.

Cons: None, this is one hell of a great series!!

Over all: Buy this series!! I love you and if you loved the Afro Samurai 5 episode TV series then this is the perfect combo for the both of them!!",1428796800,,1648,4.411184210526316

The nice thing about this DVD is that it isn't broken up into episodes like part 1.  If you haven't seen part 1 it does a decent job of filling in the back story.  I would recommend watching the original first, however.

If you enjoy hip-hop and anime this is a great stylistic blend and the story is great.  Highly recommend.",1270512000,,446,4.5
3691782,5,B001LXDGQK,This movie is pretty damn good because it explains how Afro Samurai's life was after he defeated Justice. He has to find the number 2 headband in order to challenge the number one which is lady Sio in order to see his father in which they resurrected from the dead.,1269561600,,265,4.32
3691783,3,B001LXDGQK,"Afro is on the loose once again trying his best to not be the same killer that got him back his father's number 1 headband, but this doesn't last long. He lives in a temple in quite seclusion spending his time carving wooden figures from his past. Crashing in the temple are Jinno from the first movie Afro's ex-best friend, and a newcommer his sister Sio played by Lucy Liu. Sio's past life was also destroyed by Afro. They beat him harshly and steal his number 1 headband. They also take his father's skull and tell Afro they will ressurect his father to fight against him. 4 cyborgs that were part of Sio's childhood life help her to exact revenge on Afro. This starts Afro back on his violent path once again.

Accompanying Afro is his imaginary friend Ninja Ninja which Samuel Jackson plays both of these characters well. He annoys and yet keeps Afro sane. I've heard some people don't like him in this version, but I really didn't see any major changes to that character. This one part Afro is at a festival searching seriously for the headband and all Ninja cares about is the music and drink. Afro in this sequel has to get the number 2 headband first before getting back the number 1 just like he did before.

Afro doesn't know who has the headband yet so he questions different people to find out who has it. Sio tracks his progress with a few minions and cameras. When he finds out who has the number 2 headband it really ends up being the best battle in the movie. Reseurrection has good action sequences but they are fewer than the first movie. Which is unfortunate that they don't have more. The 4 cyborg battle was very fast, and intense; giving Afro lot's of trouble fighting them teaming up on him.

Counting down the clock is Afro's father being remade and programmed to go against Afro unless Afro can get there in time to stop it. Professor Dharman is back and is the one working on Afro's father as well as being in love with Sio. It's not a pretty thought with Sio being very sexy looking and the doc being a sphere. He's also behind making her 4 friends being made into cyborgs. When Afro gets there your expecting a fantastic last battle. It really is disappointing that it is not. It's very brief and unsatisfying. Jinno who was popular in the first movie remains a puppet throughout almost all the movie, and they didnt' do him justice at the end either.

Resurrection is not a bad sequel to the first. The sequel doesn't do well with a few of the characters. With the few battle sequences, they do good on 2 of them that last long. There are some other brief action sequences that don't have to do much with Afro's main story. The story ends very strangely without Afro being shown right at the end. I only have guesses as do alot of people on this. There might even be a possible sequel by the ending I'm not sure.",1268438400,,2842,4.407619047619048

3691794,4,B001LXDGQK,"Afro Samurai was a worthy follow up, delving more into the internal struggles of Afro, and the reprucisions of his actions as outlined in the first season are dealt with as well.  Afro's quest, almost his obsession, to obtain the No. 1 headband resulted in his loss of everyone he cared about, and in some cases his humanity.  But this season shows us that his revenge will not be the only one sought, bringing some very dire consequences.  I will not spoil the story, or any of the twists as they flow, but I note Afro's need to obtain the No. 1 headband this time goes beyond the mere need to avenge his father, but moves into a need to find a purpose for himself.  All Afro has known is death and need to obtain the cloth with a number attached, and when the revenge has been obtained, but the headband no longer in his possession, he is unable to do anything but do what he knows.

Though the Second season may not be as well rounded as the first, its choice of delving into the deeper issues of the protaginist, and the harder morally ambigous decisions he must make make this season a definite watch.  If you liked the first season, then you will find much to like in the second.  Recomended.",1262563200,2,1198,4.345291479820628

The fight scenes were fantastic and reminded me of another great anime movie, ""Ninja Scroll"", although Ninja Scroll was slightly better.  The recreation of father afro was done with great results, they made him look especially menacing.  I don't know what it was, but Afro seemed a bit more sinister in this one, which is why I think a lot of reviewers here didn't give it 5 stars(though they won't admit it).  This was made clearer in the scene where he killed the Samarai he had a drink with in order to get the number 2 headband.  By the end however, I realized, that Afro is just a competitor by nature, a pity the sport he plays in demands that he kill in order to win.",1262044800,2,846,4.3164556962025316

--------------------------------------
Story
--------------------------------------

In the second part of Afro Samurai's saga, we're brought back to the violent world of samurai sword fighting. The theme here is still revenge. This time round, we have Lady Sio, voiced by Lucy Liu, looking to kill Afro for destroying her life, and her brother's.

The trail of violence starts with Lady Sio and her brother stealing the number 1 headband, as well as the remains of Afro's father. A semi-retired Afro isn't match for them, surprising. Her plan is to resurrect Afro's father to fight Afro.

In this movie, we have several fight scenes, all animated very stylishly. What really saves the movie is the animation and art. The occasional flashbacks doesn't add much depth to the characters.

There's one part where I really cringed and it's not a fight scene. It's when Afro is asking one of the Brothers on the whereabouts of the Number 1 headband. So the Brother challenged Afro to a dice game, which if he wins, he will get the information. Afro did play the game and lost. But seriously? Why won't Afro hold his sword and threaten for information in the first place? It just makes no sense. This movie is not about making sense and because of that, it suffers from lack of depth.

So did we get the Afro vs Afro fight in the end? There is, sort of. Well, I was very disappointed at the ending but I won't spoil it for you. Let's just say that it's not epic enough.

--------------------------------------
Video & audio quality
--------------------------------------

The HD version is visually beautiful. The line art is crisp, colours are strong.

The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 quality is great too. The soundtrack complements the movie well. Note that this is an English speaking movie, not a Jap movie dubbed with English subtitles.

--------------------------------------
Extras
--------------------------------------

Afro Samurai comes with the normal frills and thrills in the extra features.

  * Afro Samurai: The Game.
  This part showcases some of the aspects of the Afro Samurai game. Interesting to note is the physics of the game. Unlike most hack and slash games, Afro the game actually allows you to slick and dice - for lack of a better word - realistically. The game physics allow you to slice off parts of an opponent's body, ""if you so choose, you can slice the nose of an enemy"". Most other games show the enemies falling apart the same way no matter if you're slicing them lengthwise or breadth, not Afro the game.
  * Enter the RZA.
  This section features the RZA of the Wu-Tang clan talking about his part if producing the soundtracks and beats in the movie. I would have like it to be longer, but this part is pretty short and you do not get to hear a lot of the different beats in the movie.
  * Afro In-depth
  This section features the creator of Takashi ""Bob"" Okazaki telling viewers about the story of Afro. He explains his inspiration for the headbands, why Afro is designed the way he is and the Afro universe.
  * Afro Samurai: East meets West. Part 1
  The development of the movie from the Japanese side. Some interesting stuffs here, you can see how they actually plan out the movie and develop it.
  * Afro Samurai: East meets West. Part 2
  The production of the movie on the American side. Samuel L. Jackson and Lucy Liu talk about voice acting for Afro and Sio and some parts on how the movie was tweaked for the American audience. Note that the movie is spoken in English, not Japanese dubbed with English subtitles.
  * Afro Samurai at San Diego Comic-Con 2008.
  The scene at Comic Con 2008, featuring the interviews of Samuel L. Jackson, Takashi ""Bob"" Okazaki and the RZA. Also some candid frames of the attendees at Comic Con.
  * Part A video commentary
  Nothing much here but the commentary by director Kizaki, creator Takashi and the chief animators. The funny bit here is how they gave tribute to creator Takashi ""Bob"" Okazaki in the movie by having a movie version of him in it, along with 2 half naked girls.

--------------------------------------
Conclusion
--------------------------------------

If you're a fan of the Season One, then you'll probably like this one as well. It's also great for audience who just want some action not minding the story.

I didn't like this as much as as Afro Samurai Season One, which I've given 4-stars. So I've to rate this 3-stars. Nevertheless, it's still enjoyable.",1246147200,3,4491,4.830930537352556
3691804,4,B001LXDGQK,"The top samurai with the afro is back for another round of slicing and dicing galore.  Okazaki's ""AFRO SAMURAI"" returns with the animated film ""AFRO SAMURAI: RESURRECTION"" that is action-packed and poetically violent.

The popular anime and manga series is created by mangaka Takashi ""Bob"" Okazaki and produced by world renown Japanese animation company STUDIO GONZO (""Full Metal Panic"", ""Vandread"", ""Gantz"", ""Samurai 7' and many other anime) that brought us the popular five-episode series (aired on SPIKE TV back in 2007) made its return returned with a film in 2009.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""AFRO SAMURAI: RESURRECTION"" is an anime that looks absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray. One thing is clear, the film just looks so much better than the TV series and the film showcases its vibrant colors during daylight scenes, its darkness during the night and most of all, impressive detail in the backgrounds courtesy of its 1080p High Definition (169) transfer.  The film just looks great!

It's also important to note that ""AFRO SAMURAI: RESURRECTION"" has quite a bit of talent involved with the look of the film such as character designer and animation director, Hiroya Iijima (""Gantz"", ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"" and ""Black Cat"").  Also, art direction from Shigemi Ikeda (""Gantz"", ""Gasaraki"", ""Inuyasha"", Infinite Ryvius, ""Black Cat"" and many of the ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" TV series and films).

The picture quality really brings out the detail of the surroundings, including the rocky cliffs to the disembowelment of several characters.  And color from the lush green painted backgrounds, blue skies and huge clouds, villages and buildings to the action sequences which showcases a lot of blood.

""AFRO SAMURAI: RESURRECTION"" is just far superior to the look of the ""AFRO SAMURAI"" television series in picture quality and animation detail.

As for the audio, there is a known issue with this Blu-ray disc.  It appears there have been bad discs that were shipped earlier on.  On the back of the case, ""AFRO SAMURAI: RESURRECTION"" is listed as Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  But upon playing it on my system, it only came up as Dolby Digital 5.1.  Upon further investigation, I have learned that FUNimation Entertainment has been giving a replacement Blu-ray disc with the correct Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack to those who can provide an original receipt (and fax it to the company) and an e-mail of the purchaser's address.

With that being said, I am unable to review the audio based on its lossless soundtrack.  As for the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack, the audio sounds good and dialogue is clear and understandable.  Music comes quite clear as well and utilizes the bass quite well.  You do hear the swords clanging and cutting quite well on the DD5.1 soundtrack.  But primarily, audio is front channel driven and I don't recall LFE being used.

""AFRO SAMURAI: RESURRECTION"" is featured only in English, there is no Japanese soundtrack.  Voice acting is well done by actors Samuel L. Jackson, Lucy Liu and Yuri Lowenthal.  Samuel L. Jackson definitely brings out the believability of both Afro and Ninja Ninja.

Subtitles are featured only in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""AFRO SAMURAI: RESURRECTION"" comes with the following special features in 1080p High Definition (169) and Dolby Digital English 2.0 audio:

JUDGMENT CALL:

""AFRO SAMURAI: RESURRECTION"" is definitely going to appeal to the fans of the show.  It was pretty unique to see the collaboration between the East and the West for this series and I can only hope that GONZO continues to further production of more episodes (note: Okazaki says that what we have seen so far on the TV series and film is such a small part of what he has already written/planned for the characters).

As far as samurai anime goes, ""AFRO SAMURAI: RESURRECTION"" is a violent anime.  Part of Afro's unique fighting style is his ability to slice and dice people with multiple hits with his sword.  There are a lot of decapitations, loss of limb and blood featured throughout the series, so for the parents wondering if this film is child-safe, the answer is that this film is definitely not child-safe.

There is a lot of Western appeal and as seen at San Diego Comic-Con back in 2008, this series has its large fandom who love this series.  For those who enjoy samurai violence and a samurai anime that is just full of action, there are many positives of ""AFRO SAMURAI: RESURRECTION"" from its beautiful animation, magnificent art and of course, the music by RZA just adds another positive reason why people the series but also the film.

Also, another major plus is that this Blu-ray goes beyond what many anime Blu-ray tend to have in terms of special features.  You get several featurettes and the Blu-ray definitely explores the Japan and American side of their working collaboration.  So, there are a good number of special features include on this Blu-ray disc.  Picture quality again is gorgeous but with audio, I'm unable to comment because I am reviewing the disc that doesn't have the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless soundtrack.

But overall, ""AFRO SAMURAI: RESURRECTION"" is an anime film that features a ton of action, humor and violence.  If you dig samurai anime and a lot of fighting and violence, definitely check this film out!",1246060800,7,7399,5.032894736842105
3691805,4,B001LXDGQK,"In sum, I enjoyed this movie.  I guess I expected something a little more enthralling but it was overall an enjoyable movie.  The story line was simple, the art was fantastic, but watching it was almost like watching a really long version of the TV series on Spike.  I don't feel like I saw a new chapter of Afro.  Just another adaptation of the old one.  But again, the art is amazing, and the soundtrack by Rza is perfect, making this a decent anime.  I think for fans and non-fans alike, this is a decent anime to add to the collection.  Doesn't do anything different from the series but is a fun watch.",1239667200,,606,4.3097345132743365
3691806,5,B001LXDGQK,Movie keeps to original format and delivers as a further tale in to the Afro Samurai legend.,1238976000,,92,4.470588235294118
3691807,4,B001LXDGQK,"Dynomite! After about a 2 year absence from the original 5-episode mini-series premiering on Spike TV, Samuel L. Jackson brings back his bad mutherplucker samurai. Taking place a few years after the first series(although they seem to have forgotten the scene at the end where Jinno had gotten all the other headbands to challenge Afro), Jinno returns in his full Darth Teddy getup and pulls Afro kicking and screaming to his father's grave. There, Jinno's then revealed long-lost sister, the voluptuous Sio robs Afro's father's grave, and takes his skull away, along with the #1 Headband, which Afro spent the entire original anime trying to get. She challenges him to come and get the headband back along with his father's remains. Afro then sets out to find the #2 Headband, with a rematerialized Ninja Ninja(who may or may not really exist outside Afro's head).

After an encounter with the last remants of the Empty Seven Clan, Afro tracks down the current holder of the #2 Headband. A killer battle ensues between him and the other samurai during a parade, but Afro defeats him. Then he tangles with some of Sio's adopted family who have been remade into cyborgs by the maniacal Prof. Dharman, who turned Jinno into a bear-droid in the first series. Afro then arrives where Sio told him to challenge her, only to find out that she has had his father brought back as an insane clone who fights Afro, and does in fact kill him. Jinno realizes that his feelings were misplaced about Afro's betrayal, and fights the clone, only to have himself and Sio be killed in the process. The only fortunate part for them is that a spark of Jinno's circuitry shocks Afro's body and brings him back to life, so that he can KILL his father's clone. This follows with Afro handing the #2 Headband over to a child who was in the care of the previous headband's owner that he killed, prompting him to duel him just like Justice did in the original. Speaking of Justice, it looks like they had him in mind for another sequal because the movie ends with him in Hell meeting up with some demon.

Afro Samurai: Resurrection was decent follow-up to the previous anime, although this works better as a full-length movie as apposed to the 4-episode run Spike is rerunning it as. The animation by Gonzo Studio is amazing, with some of the best anime fight sequences in a long time. Gonzo is responsible for working on titles like Hellsing, Blue Sub No. 6, Full Metal Panic, Final Fantasy, GI Joe, and Transformers. The storyline is a little sub-par, and the dialogue is a little too stereotypical in the way Hollywood would expect an ""ethnic"" themed action movie would be. But if you like the first series, and other samurai/ninja anime like Ninja Scroll and Samurai 7, then the DVD director's cut release of this is right up your alley.",1238112000,,2814,4.694331983805668

3691825,5,B001LXDGQK,"This feature length animation is a mesmerizing collision of cultures. Those who enjoyed the first one should be very pleased with Resurrection. The colors are more vibrant, the story is more cohesive, the post-apocalyptic vision of ancient meets modern has evolved...oh...and...the score is off the chain!!!

  Once again the voice actors are fantastic. Lucy Liu's work in Resurrection is masterful. You feel the violence and insane rage in her voice... and if that's not enough for you, her elegant delivery, divine tone, passionate performance and searing sex appeal combine in Sio with E.D. busting character design and kinematics, to grace us with what even run on sentences will agree, is not only the best villain of the series, but the sexiest animated character ever. EVER!!!

  Rza drops truth. The sound design top to bottom, front to back and start to finish is so well done you feel ""in"" the scenes. The artistic merit, merits praise. The Blu-ray quality is stunning and well worth twice this price.

This one picks up after the 1st one. The animation in the movie is amazing and the music that goes along with it is just as good.",1236729600,,294,4.051724137931035
3691827,5,B001LXDGQK,"The sequel to one of my personal favorites of recent anime's. It has action, amazing art and animation, cool music by the Rza(way to resurrect your music career, if partially) and great voicework from the great Samuel L. Jackson, what more do you need, GET IT.",1236729600,,260,4.673913043478261
3691828,4,B001LXDGQK,"It's hard to find a sequel that is just as good as its predecessor, but Afro Samurai has that achievement under its belt.",1236556800,,121,4.304347826086956
3691829,5,B001LXDGQK,"This is a true Masterpiece. Rare is it that a sequel can be better than the previous movie.

Definitely worth it.",1236124800,,113,4.380952380952381
3691830,5,B001LXDGQK,"First, don't buy the ""Spiked"" version, if you are an adult, edited versions of original films are extremely lame. This version is the one to buy. Also, if you haven't seen the first movie, check it out before you see this one.

I love the visuals in this movie, and the mixture of samurai action and hip-hop music combined with Samuel Jackason's voice really works here. This time around, Afro has to come out of retirement to contend with his past deeds and old friends who are now enemies. Along the way, he fights off thugs and rocket propelled, super-powered cyborgs. The sidekick is back as well, which is a good gimmick.

Be aware that this version is filled with graphic violence and has some sexual content as well, but this version is much more satisfying than the edited movie. Dsik 2 of the two disk set contains a bunch of extras that are worth checking out. If you like anime such as Samurai Champloo, Rurni Kenshin  or Samurai 7, then buy this film.",1235865600,,963,4.522988505747127
