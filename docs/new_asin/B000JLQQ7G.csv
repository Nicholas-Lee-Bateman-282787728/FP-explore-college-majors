2675474,3,B000JLQQ7G,"No, this movie won't win any awards, but for a Sunday afternoon it wasn't a bad watch.  I actually enjoyed the movie.  Janeane was her usual angst ridden self.  Tamala Jones was hilarious (""booty doo"" cracked me up).  I actually came to see if it was on DVD, and to my delight it is!",1186358400,5,283,4.185185185185185
2675475,1,B000JLQQ7G,"This is a really bad, made for TV movie for the Oxygen network.  Made for TV movies are generally below par, but this one is 400 notches below that.  I couldn't even make it through the whole thing.  It's extremely depressing to watch, because it's so badly written and directed.  Seeing Janeane Garofalo in this tripe makes it especially painful as well.  Knowing how articulate and intelligent she can be, it hurts to see her in this ""film"".  Maybe she had bills to pay.  She deserve better material, a lot better.  She has a cult fan base, and perhaps they're willing to see her in any type of setting.  I'm not, but I would love to see her in something brilliant.  Despite all this, Janeane is still worth watching, no matter what she does.  Me watching this garbage shows how much I like her as an actress.

The fact that this is out on DVD proves that they will put just about anything on DVD.",1169337600,4,899,4.381818181818182
8151663,5,B000JLQQ7G,"A formula movie, you know most what's going to happen but it is fun to watch. Janeane Garofalo is always entertaining",1438214400,,117,4.619047619047619
8151664,5,B000JLQQ7G,everything went great,1430438400,,21,6.333333333333333
8151665,2,B000JLQQ7G,So far what I have seen of this movie I don't like it much and like The Matchmaker which is so much better. Thank goodness it didn't cost very much. And reality bites is better than this movie.  Not my kind of movie. I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this movie. Which weren't good at all.,1420675200,,307,4.116666666666666
8151666,4,B000JLQQ7G,"It was a bit of a strange movie, but I loved it only because I love Janeane Garofalo. I can't see to many people liking this movie unless you are a Janeane Garofalo fan.",1363305600,,169,4.0
8151667,3,B000JLQQ7G,"A production of the Oxygen Network, this rom-com suffers from low budget production values and anonymous casting. The film was written and directed by a newcomer.

More importantly, it requires Janeane to perform physical comedy which is not her schtick. Her talent is the use of sardonic wit, with a delicious deadpan delivery. You won't find that in this film.

Given the scarcity of Garofalo perfomances, it is still a must-see for her fans, for she remains a compelling personality.",1349308800,,486,5.0625
8151668,2,B000JLQQ7G,This is from the start to finish a Chick Flick.  Not much here for guys.,1287360000,,72,3.8
8151669,1,B000JLQQ7G,"I was disappointed in this movie. The delightfully sarcastic and grumpy Janeane Garofalo that I expected would entertain me was replaced by a weak and nervous character that made predictably embarrassing choices. It did not live up to ""The Match Maker,"" which I thoroughly enjoyed.",1247875200,,281,5.266666666666667
8151670,5,B000JLQQ7G,"I really enjoyed this movie even though I rarely watch U.S. movies. The casting, the acting, the writing, the directing and the editing are terrific in my opinion.  One small quibble:  the credits in the edition I have are pretty embarassingly bad -- but they only last for a minute.
Highly recommended by my friends and me!",1234569600,,324,4.666666666666667
8151671,5,B000JLQQ7G,"I usually won't watch movies directed by anyone but Mizoguchi (Kenji), (Michelangelo) Antonioni,(Ingmar)Bergman and lots of undeservedly obscure Japanese, African, Eastern European, etc. directors (I should own stock in the Criterion Collection) -- and I LOVED this movie.  I bought copies in bulk and sent them to all my friends and THEY REALLY LIKED IT THIS FILM, TOO.  (The title and the credits are, indeed, unfortunate, to put it tactfully.) However, I thought the casting, acting, writing, direction and editing were all terrific.  As you can deduce, I highly recommend this film!",1234483200,4,586,5.3478260869565215
8151672,4,B000JLQQ7G,I found this movie hilarious and quite enjoyable.  The music is great and any Janeane Garofalo fans will be pleased.  Sure you have to suspend some belief sometimes and the main plot setup is a bit far-fetched but for me the laugh out loud moments far outweighed any other considerations.  Give this one a try.,1195084800,5,310,4.6
