It's all good  and my point is that i got all the operations and the soundtracks . It has the episode that has Duo, Quatre, Trowa and Noin in a battle in between space fortress Barge.
Zechs and his Epyon going afther it too. You'ill have to see it for your self. and this goes to gundam fans and non gundam fans.
It was worth every penny  for this DVD",1024704000,2,424,3.839080459770115
1609658,4,B00005JXXZ,"Operation 9: Episodes 41-45: This set of shows sets up the series for it's big finale.  You will see the Gundam boys reunite with each other. You will see a character thought dead still alive...and you will also see the Gundams kicking a lot of mobile suit's butts!  With Zechs now in command of White Fang, and Treize assuming control of Earth's forces, the stage is set for war with the Gundams stuck in the middle and Relena trying desperately to stop her brother from waging all out war with the earth.  Some high points in this disc include seeing Quatre struggling to use the Zero system, the return of the Mercurius and Vayete(with Heero's and Trowa's data imbedded in them), and the Libra fully operational.
  With this disc, we see the revised opening animation set to Rythym Emotion which is welcome and on a side note, the audio for the opening track seems a lot cleaner than the older Just Communication...a treat for those with high end audio systems or Dolby Digital/Pro Logic theater set ups.  A small goof on the DVD...the credits which feature over the openings of the show still list the opening theme as Just Communication even though Rythym Emotion is blaring through your speakers...I suppose that one slipped through...I know it's nit-picking, but the credits should be accurate.  As we get closer to the end, these episodes are getting much better...don't miss it.",995414400,5,1387,4.802521008403361
1609659,5,B00005JXXZ,"Lots of great stuff for Gundam fans here! Did anyone else realize that episode 42 (Battleship Libra) has the ONLY TIME in the entire series that Wufei pilots a Gundam other than Shenlong or Altron? That episode 43 (Target: Earth) is the first time in the series all five G-Boys gather together? That episode 44 (Go Forth, G-Team) has a really, REALLY awesome name?! I would never consider myself a GUNDAM fan, but I'm flat obsessed with Gundam W. The characters are really well developed, the storyline is interesting and full of that wonderful thing called PLOT, and... I just like the show. Plus, starting with Operation 7, new ANIMATED menus are used on the DVDs that I just can't get over! There's cool stuff on this DVD for fans of just about everyone except Heero (sorry!!), too- Wufei's stint on the Zero system, Trowa recovers his memories, Quatre's return to the Zero system, and Duo's battle against the mobile doll versions of Mercurius and Vayaete are all worth seeing! And finally, episode 41 has the FULL LENGTH version of Rhythm Emotion playing... so... watch it. Watch!! That is all.",994032000,4,1099,4.7894736842105265
1609660,5,B00005JXXZ,"To make this very brief, this DVD contains episodes 41 - 45. A quick summary of the episodes.
Episode 41 - The Battle Over Baruji: The battle over Baruji, which will decide supremacy in space, begins. Treize takes the place of the agonizing Relena, and takes into his hands the real power of the Foundation. In space, Zechs, without giving Noin a satisfying answer, attacks and takes down Baruji.
Episode 42 - Libra Set in Motion: The unconscious Lady Une is returned to Treize, who is preparing for war. Meanwhile, Wufei, seeking a decisive battle, is shown the path he should take by the Zero System. Zechs orders the Libra in the direction of the Earth.
Episode 43 - The Aurora Bombarding the Ground: While Heero and the others come together on the Peacemillion, remnants of OZ occupy the colony where Catherine is. Trowa sets off alone in the Zero to rescue her. Due to the influence of the Zero System and the efforts of Quatre, his memory is fully restored.
Episode 44 - The Gundam Team Launches its Attack: Relena boards the Libra, seeking to ascertain her brother's true intentions, but their views will never meet. Meanwhile, Quatre is made to operate the Zero System for the good of space.
Episode 45 - Premonition of Battle: Hilde steals data from the Libra and escapes. After her come the Mobile Dolls with Heero and Trowa's fighting data imprinted in their systems. Duo sets off in the midst of battle to rescue her, and destroys the two Mobile Dolls. She gives him the data.
This is a crucial DVD! This sets all the character's up for the final battle that happens in the last 4 episodes! These DVD's have always been a good deal because you get the dual languages and more episodes (5) then on the VHS tapes (3) which only have one language.",991353600,17,1756,4.595541401273885
1609661,5,B00005JXXZ,"In this Dvd you'll see Quatre having a hard time mastering the ZERO system, and Heero sneaks into Libra to see Relena. It is action packed and you'll see for the first time (I think)that the gundam team (including Wufei) work as a team, though with Quatre as the leader. Quatre and the others had to battle the mobile dolls controlled by Dorothy, and you figure the gundam boys are better than that. It's actually funny that when they call out each other's name, you must see it! This is a great Dvd to buy even you are not that violent, personally, I assure you it's a ""must not miss"" part of the series. Gundam 4 ever!!",991353600,,621,4.316239316239316

7942557,4,B00005JXXZ,"Relena and Heero have come aboard the Libra to convince Zechs to stop his insanity, but he's not hearing it. Treize and his army have come asking for a one on one duel, but Zechs declines. The Libra and Peacemillion are about to collide, and the collision will destroy Earth. The Gundam pilots have to stop the catastrophe.

Many of the Gunadam series have a very similar plot. What distinguishes them from each other is the character development. Gundam Wing has a lot of potential, but falls short of greatness. There are some awesome battles and plot twists, but the characters are very boring and one dimensional. The voice acting is bad too, which doesn't help. This is a really good anime despite these things. I like the plot and the action can get pretty intense. If you like Gundam, then you will probably enjoy this, even though it's one of the weakest Gundam's ever made.",1355356800,,882,4.653846153846154
7942558,5,B00005JXXZ,I remembered the series when it was on cartoon network during the toonami time slot. I thought the series was very well written and enjoyed it thoroughly. It turned me on to other anime series as well as the genre itself. It has a great storyline and is very creative. I recommend highly.,1348358400,,288,4.452830188679245
