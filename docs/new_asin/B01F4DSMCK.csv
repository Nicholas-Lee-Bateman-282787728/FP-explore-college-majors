8760056,5,B01F4DSMCK,"this is surely one of the more strange movies one will see..  father-son bounty hunters in 1860 Romania??.. very profane and at times, very funny.",1525824000,,146,4.84
8760057,4,B01F4DSMCK,This is a fascinating film.  The black and white is amazing.  The locations are evocative.  The language is very coarse.  The treatment of and attitudes toward women subhuman as is the acceptance of slavery and how they treat slaves.  The ending is grotesque and very hard to watch -- my wife ran out of the room.  The subtitles are fine.,1510790400,,338,4.55
8760058,5,B01F4DSMCK,"This is the sort of story I truly admire and appreciate. The social realism, the interpersonal verisimilitude, the honesty, is something that is so rare in American cinema as to be non-existent. Also, the impact of Sergio Leone on films outside of the USA is striking to me. I saw something very similar in 'Once Upon a Time in Anatolia', where, not only the presentation style, but the underlying social context, seems to resonate.

The story occurs in a part of what is now Romania, in a time frame around the period when Charles Dickens was writing Oliver Twist, and there is a brilliant moment when a stuffy Englishman intrudes upon an Inn and it's communal revelry and is rudely ejected. If, as I was, you are unfamiliar with the details, both social, cultural, and technological of daily life in this place and time, you will be given much to imagine and think about. So much of this World's history, and life, is unknown to us. Oh, we know the broad strokes of history, but the nitty-gritty details, the daily burdens, the ethical conundrums, the haunting questions, and ultimately, the immovable constraints of social and political reality, simply escape us. They are unknown unknowns. We don't even know that we don't know. For that reason, this film is an incredible gift. Radu Jude is showing us something that I believe few of us could have imagined, and now, my sense of the world, and it's timeless patterns of guilt, recriminations, justice and injustice interwoven in this place and that, in this time and that, like the fiddles around a Gypsy campfire. Crime and Punishment, Romanian style. In all times and places, character prevails. In spite of this, you win some, and you lose some. He who messes with the Bull, gets the horns.",1496620800,,1748,4.768976897689769

8760062,5,B01F4DSMCK,"Read a series of reviews that rated this movie pretty high.  After seeing it, I think it met the good reviews.

Shot in b&w, which had a way of making me concentrate more on the dialogue.  And speaking of which - if you are the easily offended type, you may want to skip this movie.  If it were an American film, it would be rated R for a good reason.  The language is a bit salty in areas - but not gratuitous - it fits in well with the story.  And I looked on this as a series of vignettes with a central theme.

Totally worth the purchase - has a lot of humor and personal interactions but there are some serious, dramatic parts too.  Overall, a definite 5-star.",1481673600,,665,4.10077519379845

8760064,5,B01F4DSMCK,"This is a superb film, with a very subtle, coherent presentation. One of the best films of the Romanian ""new wave"" and that says a lot (look also for Child's Pose, 12:08 East of Bucharest, or Nemescu's California Dreamin'). It describes a nihilistic universe where anything good, including God, is just an empty word. A primitive society built on illusions, prejudice, injustice, suffering without end, a world stagnating in the absence of any ideal. Everything is permeated with hypocrisy, and mercy is a fleeting shadow. The only traces of humanity are found in the gypsy slaves; they try to flee, they suffer, etc., in a chaotic and hopeless manner - but their hopelessness is due to outside circumstances. All this sounds horrible overall, but it is done in such a humorous, immersive manner through excellent cinematography, wonderful acting and fascinating, stylish dialogue -- when it ends you will find yourself speaking in archaic proverbs and wondering if we are not, in some way, just as blind or hopeless as the characters in this amazing production.",1467244800,3,1062,5.074285714285714
8760065,5,B01F4DSMCK,"A grand film from Romania, directed with surety by Radu Jude, is even stronger because it is dealing with age old bigotry against gypsies, offered in contemporary language (many F bombs here  at least in the translation) that suits the theme well, and since we are dealing with prejudices on every level, the choice to make the film in Black and White makes it all the more pungent.

AFERIM! Is not only an interesting historical statement, but it is also a parody of the religious practices of the 19th century  Christian monasteries and encountered priests on the road speak of why gypsies are inferior descendants of Noahs son Ham and there for are to be reviled. But gypsies are not the only people who are mocked by the father/son travelers in this quest for capturing a renegade gypsy: the father speaks about the nasty traits of the Turks, the Greeks, the English, the French, etc etc etc leaving no one in the world (which by the way is not round but ends in a precipice!).

But on to the story  and there is one worth seeing: Set in early 19th century Wallachia, when a local policeman, Costandin, is hired by Iordache, a boyar (local noble), to find Carfin, a Gypsy slave who had run away from the boyar's estate after having an affair with his wife, Sultana. Costandin sets out to find the fugitive, beginning a journey full of adventures. Gypsy slavery lasted from the 14th century up until the middle of the 19th century, a situation which is very little known and almost nonexistent in the public debate today, although its impact continues to influence Romania's social life.

This little film slipped by viewers and it is hopeful that under the auspices of BIG WORLD PICTURES it will garner enough attention that audiences today will witness the very profound lessons it tells with such a gift of comedic dialogue. We all have much to learn from this film. Grady Harp, June 16",1466726400,3,1892,4.666666666666667
