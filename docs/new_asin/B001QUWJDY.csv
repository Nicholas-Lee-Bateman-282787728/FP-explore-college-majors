8336460,1,B001QUWJDY,"While these movies and books appeal to contain good Christian moral values the fact of the matter is they are made to support the leaders of the cult formerly known as the Children of God, that changed their name to The Family International. Just like you wouldn't buy clothes you knew were made by child slaves, you won't want to buy these videos knowing that the people who made them are well known pedophiles. And ultimately the people most befitting from the sale of them are the Cult leaders themselves. All this information is well documented and easy to find with a quick google search",1456704000,,592,4.647619047619048
8336461,1,B001QUWJDY,"These products are made by the group formerly known as the Children of God and later The Family international. Due to a lot of bad press they have separated their branding from the cult but it is still run by members who funnel this money straight to their leader Karen Zerby's pockets. The children from TFI have suffered terrible abuse in their childhood including sexual, physical and mental abuse all which is well documented. Some survivors of  the cult are well known: River Phoenix, Joaquin Phoenix, Rose McGowen. Julianna Buhring (Guiness world record holder as the first woman to circumnavigate the work on a bicycle), Taylor Stevens. Some great books you can read about them are Not without my Sister, and The Innocent.
I recommend that you do not buy this product it supports well documented pedophiles.",1456704000,2,814,4.9416058394160585

8336465,5,B001QUWJDY,I love listening to these with my Grandson.  We have been watching/listening to the whole Cherub Wings series for the last 7 years.  We are still not bored with them and they keep coming out with more (up to 15 that I know of) -which is way cool.  This particular DVD is a compilation of some of their greatest songs with scripture support in-between.  This series brings the Guidance from God's Word come alive.,1324857600,,412,4.527027027027027
