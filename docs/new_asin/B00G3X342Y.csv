8620510,3,B00G3X342Y,"Phata Poster Nikhla Hero (roughly translates to: ""the poster rips open and out comes the hero"") is an unapologetic masala flick, a throwback to the silly 1980's Bollywood. I noticed the pre-movie acknowledgment - ""We are greatful to Akshay Kumar"" - and I don't think it's fair to implicate Akshay Kumar in this mess. He's already got enough to answer for, for his recent batch of ""comedies.""

All his life Vishwas Rao (Shahid Kapoor) had wanted to be a huge Bollywood star, never mind that his civic-minded mother, Savitri (Padmini Kolhapure), dreams of his becoming an honest policeman. So far Vishwas has been able to stymie his mom's wish by sabotaging each of his police entrance exams. And when Vishwas leaves his sleepy village for Mumbai on yet another police service interview, he leaps at the opportunity to break into the film industry. So this and that happens, a chain of events that lands him in a studio posing for glamourous head shots while in a police inspector's uniform. And, later, when he can't find his real clothes, he ends up stepping out still in the police inspector's uniform. Of course, you savvy where this is going.

It's one of those movies in which the lawmen of the local precinct are all inept and unmotivated and on the take. Sweet social activist Kajal (Ileana D'Cruz) is one of them busy-body sorts who inundates the police with complaints. Of course, she gets the run-around. Cut to a frantic Kajal now scouring the streets for a righteous policeman and, hey, there's Vishwas in his police uniform motoring along on his moped. Kajal corrals Vishwas and reports the kidnapping she'd just witnessed. Well, this and that happens - including an amusing cameo of Salman Khan (playing himself) - and, somehow, Vishwas and Kajal inadvertently foil the kidnapping. The local crime boss (Saurabh Shukla) isn't too keen about this.

The next few days prove to be unkind to the crime boss, for the unwitting Vishwas proceeds to get in the way of his other criminal enterprises. Take pity - or snicker at - that crooked police inspector in charge (Zakir Hussain) who now keeps getting grilled by the enraged crime boss as to the identity of this mysterious hero policeman, this ""bulldozer without brakes.""

As for Vishwas Rao, guy's got his hands full, what with juggling a fledgling film career and now forced to keep up appearances as a cop to appease the lovely Kajal and also his mother (who's come to Mumbai to visit). It's like an episode of Three's Company. Y'know, the one where there's a misunderstanding.

Shahid Kapoor has built up cachet based on Vivah (2006) and Jab We Met (2007), enough cachet that I sat all the way thru this one, tight grip on nostalgia. Shahid, limited versatility and all, makes this movie enjoyable up to a point. He sure hams it up. I rate Phata Poster Nikhla Hero 2.5 out of 5 stars. The first half is the better half, even though there are bizarre moments such as Vishwas' charade expanding to deceiving the Joint Commissioner of Police Khare (Darshan Jariwala) who has moved into the ground floor of the building that Vishwas and his mother are staying in. Post-interval, the film loses steam as it sinks into clunky melodrama and introduces a tired subplot about a shadowy bad guy who means to employ biochemical bombs to blow up the city.

In the film's best gag, Salman Khan shows up as himself in a brief scene that plays up his real-life run-ins with the law. But genuinely funny moments like that cameo are few and far between. I guess I couldn't get into this one. Ultimately, the characters felt empty, the silly plot too vapid and exhausting, the humor too broad and clumsy. I'm a little disappointed in Ileana D'Cruz who had raised a personal bar in Barfi! Here, she's pretty much just eye candy, despite that, okay, her character's proactive attitude does prod the laid back Vishwas to action for most of the film.

Oh, what the hell, I think I'll blame Akshay Kumar for this after all.",1391731200,4,3964,4.736231884057971
