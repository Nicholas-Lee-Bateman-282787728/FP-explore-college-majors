3682850,5,B001LERYOE,"TNA wrestling is in an interesting place for being a larger name in its industry. Though nothing compared to the titan, WWE, TNA has shown and is showing a willingness to be aggressive and an industrious amount of thought and care into its creative machinations in and out of the production of its programming. Slammiversary, is one of the largest ppv TNA productions of the calender year, just behind Bound for Glory. 2012's was definitely one that shown no shortage of self-congratulation to its ability to be competitive with the WWE, and ride on its own momentum from interesting story lines and developing talent. It is perfect for anyones collection of PPVs budding or extensive.",1376870400,,685,4.965217391304348
3682851,4,B001LERYOE,My son and I attended this PPV and we loves rewatching it and looking for ourselves in the crowd.  I think this is TNA's best PPV EVER.  Every match from top to bottom is excellent.,1358899200,,181,4.142857142857143
3682852,5,B001LERYOE,"The X Division title match between Austin Aries & Samoa Joe was high-flying masterpiece. The Hernandez-Kid Kash match was solid and good.  The Devon/Garett Bischoff-Robbie E/Robbie T tag team match was not great but fine. The Mr. Anderson-RVD-Jeff Hardy 3 way match was a 10 minute action packed thrill ride. The James Storm-Crimson match was short but...Kevin Nash:""Just Too SWEEEEET!"". The Women's title match between Miss Tessmacher-Gail Kim was entertaining and pretty good. The Joseph Park-Bully Park hardcore match was not great but pretty good. The Kurt Angle/AJ Styles-Christopher Daniels/Kazarian tag team title match was a nail-biting,back-and-forth,hard-hitting,heart-pounding,high-flying showstealer. The World title match between Bobby Roode & Sting was a pretty nice brawl even with the empty-feeling ending. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1353801600,,853,5.76984126984127
3682853,4,B001LERYOE,"This event celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Total Nonstop Action wrestling promotion and with that came a couple of surprises throughout the night such as Sting being announced as the first man to be inducted into the TNA Hall Of Fame, TNA counting down the top 3 moments in the company's history with ex-TNA & current WWE talent in Christian Cage making an appearance to announce the #1 TNA moment, and...

X Division Champion Austin Aries vs. Samoa Joe - ...Hulk Hogan announcing before this match that they were going ""old school"" & lifted the weight limit for the X Division for Joe to get a title match here.  Both men exchanged kicks early before Aries eventually took him over & outside with head scissors with Joe making a quick recovery by kicking Aries right in the face when he went for a suicide dive onto the outside.  Joe dominated here by constantly having a counter to whatever Aries did before he was finally caught with the suicide dive for control only for Joe to catch Aries again with a series of holds from the powerbomb into submissions like the crab & crossface.  Aries continued to bring the fight to Joe by going aerial, countering Joe's attempt at the muscle buster, and even getting Joe up in the brainbuster.  This was truly a throwback to the old school days of the division as this was a match that featured some fast paced intense wrestling.

Hernandez vs. Kid Kash - This marked both men's returns to TNA after being absent for a number of months as Hernandez showed his power advantage early shoulderblocking Kash out of the ring early before Kash was able to get control & worked over his arm with various holds like the crossarm breaker & hammerlock in the ropes.  Both men traded momentum from here as Kash executed a top rope head scissors that drove Hernandez face first followed by a tornado swinging DDT that landed him on top of his head while Hernandez from here went aerial with his Air Mexico onto the outside & a top rope splash in the ring.  Neither man came into this match with an issue or story putting them against each other but still put on a good performance against each other.

Devon & Garrett Bischoff vs. Robbie E & Robbie T - This was just your basic tag match where the Robbie's worked over the rookie Garrett with double teaming before making the eventual hot tag to Devon to clean out.  Outside of Madison Rayne all dolled up at the top of the ramp paying attention to her ""crush,"" this was your basic tag match.

Mr. Anderson vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Rob Van Dam - With all three men chasing after the TNA Championship, this was to determine who go the title shot later in the week on Impact.  All 3 men started out fighting each other not singling one man out leading to some interesting situations like Anderson hitting a superplex on Hardy only with RVD trying frog splashing both afterwords, Anderson with a backslide on RVD only for Hardy to do the splits on RVD resulting in both Anderson & Hardy in a position to be pinned, and Jeff Hardy with a top rope post to post distance dive to the outside onto both men before one man finally picked up the victory using the divide & conquer strategy.  This was a fun three way dance.

James Storm vs. Crimson - Crimson's undefeated streak was on the line here in this open challenge that saw the return of James Storm for the first time since LockDown in a short dominated victory to end Crimson's streak.

Knockouts Champion Gail Kim vs. Brooke Tessmacher - Brooke got her rematch in her home state here & was in control with her clothesline off the top followed by a head scissors while Gail regained it back focusing on the neck & arm with moves like the shoulder breaker, hammerlock, and head scissors.  Both ladies traded momentum & even attempted at each others signature moves at one time leading to another match in the most competitive knockout feud in months.

No Disqualification Match: Joseph Parks vs. Bully Ray - Ray bullied Park early before Joseph got a slap in that even surprised himself but Bully brought the offense using weapons like the a chair but Joseph was able to got some shots in with a kendo stick before Abyss made his promised appearance becoming the deciding factor here.  This was more of a segment more than a match as it was designed for Park to not come off as a wrestler while further push the issues between both men & Abyss.

Tag Team Champions Christopher Daniels & Kazarian vs. Kurt Angle & A.J. Styles - With Styles issues with Kaz & Daniels over the accusations of the affair with Dixie Carter, he ran straight to the ring & was more focused on just beating them with moves like his sliding underneath the guardrail only to deliver a springboard forearm off the rail before Kaz & Daniels resorted to double teaming Styles & keeping him in their corner to move things in their advantage.  Angle came into the match hot as he delivered a heavy amount of suplexes including both of them at once while A.J. also got into the action with a reverse & standard DDT on both men at the same time.  This was one of those matches that went back & forth non-stop with one move after another after another.

TNA Champion Bobby Roode vs. Sting - Roode kept stalling going to the outside causing Sting to bring the fight on the floor throwing Roode into the guardrails & steps before Roode was able to regain control & work over Sting with moves like the sleeper only for Sting to keep coming & counter his offense.  Sting took the fight back to the outside going to the the stage, ramp, and even a Scorpion Deathlock on the broadcast table before dominating in the ring.  This was a very strong performance from Sting while Roode played his role well as a heel here but keep watching after the match as we saw the biggest Scorpion Deathdrop of all time.

This was another strong show from TNA as there wasn't a bad match on here with some talents putting on their best performances in recent times making this come off as an important anniversary show instead of a filler like it's come off as in recent years.",1352160000,2,6051,4.499087591240876
3682854,3,B001LERYOE,"Debuting in June of 2002 TNA Wrestling fought through many obstacles and now at their three year anniversary we get to see one of their biggest PPV's of the year in Slammiversary.

-Pre-Show (As an extra on the DVD)

-Larry Zbyszko is in the ring, saying former Director of Authority Dusty Rhodes has been fired, then Jeff Jarrett comes out he talks about wanting to be in the main event tonight. Raven comes out running down both men, especially Jarrett then Raven demands being put in the King of the Mountain Match. They have a brawl, security gets involved then on the outside Jeff attacks a fan at ringside so Jarrett gets suspended.

-Apollo & Sonny Siaki vs. Trytan and Simon Diamond: Two big guys vs. Simon and a big, goofy jobber who looks like a mixture of Snitsky and Sting, its standard warm-up fare Siaki & Apollo hit some big power moves. Diamond and Trytan kinda get knocked around however they do end up with the win after Simon hits a kick on Siaki then Trytan hits an F-5 and covers to win. 2/10.

-Now were are back with Jeff Jarrett being arrested and taken out of the arena, while Raven and Larry are bantering and he puts Raven in the main event tonight.

Live Show

-Great opening video package showing how TNA has really grown as a company in just 3 years, before showing clips of what we can expect tonight at the 3 year anniversary PPV.

-6-Way X-Division Match, Zach Gowan vs. Delirious vs. The Amazing Red vs. Jerrelle Clark vs. ""Primetime"" Elix Skipper vs. Shark Boy: Nice way to open the show though it was just kind of a filler match, some good spots involved though. There's the usual series of moves with each man getting some shots in, it ends with Shark Boy hitting the Dead Sea Drop off the top rope on Delirious and covers to win. 5/10.

-Shocker vs. Alex Shelley: After a few months off Alex returns to TNA, against the unique style of the mexican wrestler Shocker. This is a fairly good match which features some good mat wrestling especially from Shelley who really hits some good submission style offense to ground Shocker. However Shocker does hit some good offense of his own to throw Alex off his game, including a nice suicide dive to the outside where both their heads collide. Shocker hits some head scissors into a pin for three, much to Shelley's shock. 7/10.

-Kip James vs. Ron ""The Truth"" Killings: There had been some questionable things happening in the past few months due to the former New Age Outlaws, here Kip and B.G. James having run-ins where Truth and Konnan had questioned B.G.'s loyalty to them. Its a blah match, Kip displays good strength wearing down Killings who hits his own set of kicks and makes his comeback, counters a cobra clutch throw and gets the pin for three. 3/10, then Kip beats Truth up and brings a chair out, but B.G. comes out to stop him, but won't hit him with a chair.

-NWA World Tag Team Championship Match, The Naturals (Champions) vs. Team Canada (Eric Young & Petey Williams) w/Scott D'Amore: This is a good tag match where there was an underlying story of The Naturals having a new advisor but whomever it was didn't come out with them. These 4 men did well, displaying good tag team wrestling like cutting the ring off and working a guy over, which Williams and Young did well and used dirty tactics to try to steal the titles from Douglas and Stevens. Once Douglas is tagged in the pace picks up with a good amount of big moves and nearfalls, after a hockey stick shot Petey goes for the Canadian Destroyer but Jimmy Hart comes down, throws his megaphone in to Stevens who uses it on Williams and after a 3 count the Naturals retain. 7/10.

-Sonjay Dutt vs. Samoa Joe: Its the TNA debut of Joe who just dominates and destroys the high flying Dutt, who only gets in a few moves. Joe hits some big moves including catching Dutt in the corner and slamming him down on his head. A bit later he hits a Muscle Buster then locks on a rear naked choke and Sonjay taps out. 5/10.

-Lance Hoyt vs. Robert Roode w/Scott D'Amore: Its power for power here with Lance hitting some high impact moves, while Roode does some grinding weardown offense and D'Amore gets in a few cheap shots on the outside behind the referees back. Hoyt does comeback with a chokeslam and goes for a moonsault but Scott hold his leg allowing a powerbomb by Roode but only for two. After the ref tries getting Scott off the ring apron, Robert hits the Northern Lariat on Hoyt and covers to win. 5/10. Lance gets beat up by Roode while Scott trash talks on the mic slapping him some. However Lance gets some revenge hitting a chokeslam and a moonsault on D'Amore.

-America's Most Wanted vs. Konnan and B.G. James: This was about could Konnan trust B.G. given what happened earlier in the show, its not a great match all the guys get some good moves in but the tension between the teams didn't make for a great story. AMW works over Konnan, keeping him in their corner but don't get the three count, B.G. gets the tag and Kip James comes down and brawls with Konnan. Meanwhile AMW hits the Hart Attack (Hart Foundation) finisher and covers James to win. 5/10.

-Triple Threat Elimination Match for the X-Division Championship, ""The Fallen Angel"" Christopher Daniels (Champion) vs. Chris Sabin w/Trinity vs. Matt Bentley w/Tracy: Given the rivalry Bentley and Sabin had coming into this it seemed like Daniels was kinda the afterthought for a few, even getting beat up by both men before coming back with his own good moves. Its stays at a good pace as all three of these guys are good workers and gel together well in this contest. It gets very good with lots of nearfalls as the crowd kept cheering all three men on, the women do get involved with Trinity getting the Angels Wings after Sabin hit the Cradle Shock to eliminate Matt. Sabin is energized trying to beat the champ but never keeping him down for the count, he goes for a springboard but gets kicked off then the Angels Wings and Daniels pins to retain his title. 8/10.

-King of the Mountain Match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, ""The Phenomenal"" AJ Styles (Champion) vs. Raven vs. Abyss vs. ""The Alpha Male"" Monty Brown vs. Sean Waltman: To become eligible you must pin someone, then you can climb the ladder and hang up the title to win, but if you're pinned you must be put in the penalty box for two minutes. Its sounds confusing but does play out better once the match goes on thankfully. Starts off good with Waltman hitting a splash from the top of the penalty box, then Monty hits the Pounce on Raven and covers to become eligible to hang the title. AJ hits a great dive over the top onto Abyss on the outside, Brown works over Sean then hits a powerbomb and send him to the box.

-Raven pulls AJ to the outside and pins him, then brings in a trash can slamming it into Monty and Abyss's heads, later Abyss hits the Black Hole Slam on Brown and covers him for three. Loved the spot where Styles hits the Spiral Tap off the top through a table on Abyss, the whole match is an out of control brawl with each man going for the win but some take come brutal falls. Raven brings out a staple gun and uses it on Waltman, but he comes back using it on Raven and Abyss in a very uncomfortable spot to say the least.  AJ and Abyss both fall off the ladder through respective tables, Raven hits the DDT on Monty then climbs the ladder and hangs the belt to win the match and the title. 9/10, cause it was nice to see Raven get his moment to shine in TNA.

For being an alleged big time TNA PPV this was fairly mundane, outside of the 2 main events that is. So if you're a TNA fan especially of the older days of TNA wrestling then get it but its nothing too special honestly.",1343692800,2,7706,4.433922261484099

The price is too high",1519948800,,36,3.625
8317862,5,B001LERYOE,excellent  dvd,1421712000,,14,6.0
8317863,4,B001LERYOE,"TNA really turned a negative into a positive. With MVP coming down with his injury they changed 2 of the singles matches and made them No. 1 Contender's matches and changed the main event into a triple threat steel cage match. This was actually a very good event. The X-Division Championship 6-Way Ladder match and the TNA Championship 3-Way Cage match were the best matches on the show. The others were not bad. The only dud was the Knockouts Championship Match.

This is a 2-disc DVD that also has the 30 minute Before the Bell special and 22 minutes of bonus interviews. However one odd thing is that the bonus disc is 82 minutes in length. TNA took a couple highlight videos from the ppv and put them together (about 6 minutes in length) and replays those videos over and over again for 30 minutes. I don't know why. Possibly a major error in putting the DVD together. The DVD also has a couple of video and audio glitches during the show but nothing major.",1416441600,,961,4.491428571428571
8317864,4,B001LERYOE,"The 6 way ladder match for the X-Divison (Tigre Undo vs Sanada vs Eddie Edwardsvs Davey Richard vs Manik vs Crazy Steve) was high-flying,entertaing spot-fest. The Samoa Joe-Lashley match was not great but solid and the same goes for the Magnus-Williow match. The Austin Aries-Kenny King match was a pretty good bout with some good heat to boot. The Von Erichs(Marshall & Ross)-Bromans(Jesse G & DJZ) was decent even with the DQ finish. The Angelina Love-Gail Kim-Women's title match was so-so at best. The Bully Ray-EC3-Texas Death Match was a hardcore,smash-mouth ECW-ish brawl even with the ending. The Mr Anderson-James Storm while not bad,it might be more remembered for the football players getting involved then the match itself. The 3 way Steel Cage for the Worlds title (Eric Young vs Lashley vs Austin Aries) was a hard-hitting,smash-mouth fight. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1416355200,,886,5.034013605442177
8317865,4,B001LERYOE,"Ladder Match: X Division Champion Sanada vs. Manik vs. Tigre Uno vs. Davey Richards vs. Eddie Edwards vs. Crazy Steve - This was a more important X Division Championship match than normal with Destination X & the opportunity to cash in the title for a World Title match coming up in the next month as this match started off with a bang having multiple dives to the outside from the competitors in the opening minute followed by various highlights such as a release german suplex into the ladder, the Terry Funk airplane spin with ladder, a backstabber off the top rope, one man suplexing himself & his opponent over the top rope to the floor, a sunset flip powerbomb onto a scaffold ladder, and two sets of individuals deciding to work together as a team until it was time for only one man to win the match.  This was the spotfest expected with everyone involved either giving or taking some hard hits.

Samoa Joe vs. Lashley - This was one of two qualifying matches for the TNA Championship match later in the night due to M.V.P.'s injury.  Both men started out with power strikes that knocked their opponent down before Joe was able to take control with Lashey attempting to go to the outside to break the momentum but Joe followed with a suicide dive only for Lashley to send him into the steps & focus on the neck & throat area with nerve holds & neckbreaker while also bending the rules to his advantage as both men hit some big moves against each other to the point where it came down to just one man being able to catch the other.

Willow vs. Magnus - For those who don't already know, Willow was the alter-ego of Jeff Hardy who also had Abyss in his corner while Magnus was managed by Bram.  This was a rematch of the TNA Championship tournament finals months earlier as we saw a new side Magnus from his appearance to the opening moments of the match where he was more aggressive & being able to take advantage of distractions & catching Jeff in positions that worked in his favor as Willow used his trademark diverse daredevil offense to move control in his favor while the managers kept getting into a fight on the outside to the point where they each pulled out out their favorite weapon of choice with the legal competitors involved in it as well.  This was an average match that was more about continuing the storyline between all four men as there was just as much focus on what was going out outside the ring as there was inside.

It was right around here that last year's TNA Hall Of Fame inductee Kurt Angle introduced the newest members in Team 3D with Devon returning & reuniting with Bully Ray.

Austin Aries vs. Kenny King - This was the second qualifying match to determine who moves on to the TNA Championship match later in the night as King showed disrespect towards Aries right away only to receive a series of offensive in & outside of the ring in response only for King to use the ringside environment to his advantage as both men went aerial with their offense  from suicide dives to slingshot twisting dives to the outside along with hard hitting moves from a reverse neckbreaker on the ringropes to spinebuster to a springboard buff blockbuster to one of the most impactful brainbusters seen in a really good back & forth encounter.

Marshall & Ross Von Erich vs. Jesse & DJ Zema Ion - Jesse & DJ attacked from behind working them over with double teaming before the Von Erichs came back with Marshall showing his power & Ross with the agility while both men delivering dropkicks their family is known for before things started to get out of control causing Kevin Von Erich to get ""hands on"" with the situation.  The match was pretty short & sweet only serving the purpose of popping the live crowd seeing the legendary Von Erich family back in the ring in Texas.

Knockouts Champion Angelina Love vs. Gail Kim - Gail started out in control being able to trip Love with her own body & deliver a low running forearm while Love was able to counter Gail's offense into an impactful powerbomb allowing her to heavily work over the back area with the match briefly taken to the outside before one woman heavily gained a series of offense in a match that was good for what it was but was more about the story involving the ""other"" legal participants in the match that worked for & against both women at different times in the match.

Texas Death Match: Bully Ray vs. Ethan Carter III - It should be noted that this match was held under ""Last Man Standing"" rules meaning that unlike traditional ""Texas Death Match"" rules, there wasn't a pinfall needed before the 10 count to end the match.  Bully came out with a bull rope using it heavily to his advantage while stacking tables in the ring & all around ringside as both men began to implement weapons into the match using them in various ways chairs being used on various parts of the body such as the back & face, a cheese grader raked across the skin but not in the way as expected, the ring boards underneath the mat exposed, kendo stick shots, and broken glass in a match that was definitely a hardcore weaponsfest.

Mr. Anderson vs. James Storm - Storm made a point to have some choice words with the Dallas Cowboys at ringside before the match before both men started brawling on the outside with one man being able to get an advantage heavily working over the leg to the point where it heavily effected him throughout the match as the match continued with Storm deciding to definitely cross the line when it came to the special guest at ringside only for it to definitely come back to haunt him in a match that only served the purpose of getting the Dallas Cowboys involved to again pop the Texas crowd.

Steel Cage Match: TNA Champion Eric Young vs. Austin Aries vs. Lashley - This match could only be won by pinfall or submission as this match started out as ""every man for himself"" only for one man to be so dominate with his power tossing each man into the cage that it caused his other two opponents to become unlikely allies to work him over sending him into the cage as well attempting to take him out of action so they could focus on each other with each man implementing various offense such as coming off the top rope & even off the top of the cage, taking out both opponents with one move, and one man doing a move with such impact that a part of the cage gave away on impact in what was a great triple threat match that was definitely better than what was originally scheduled as each man played to their strengths & left looking strong.

This PPV did have some faults as some matches where only here by designed to pop the live crowd (Anderson/Storm & the Von Erich's appearance) while others were more about pushing the storyline that effected the action (Knockouts & Willow/Magnus) but overall played to the strengths which is the in-ring action making this PPV a big rebound from the previous disappointing Sacrifice PPV so it's an event from TNA I would check out.",1415836800,,6964,4.488151658767772
8317866,4,B001LERYOE,Not a bad show I haven't bought a tna dvd in a while and when I bought this I was impressed by the whole thing,1407024000,,110,3.44
8317867,3,B001LERYOE,"I bought this dvd cheap at my local bookstore for a couple of bucks. I bought this for one match really. Raven is my favorite wrestler and I feel like in his career he never got a fair opportunity to shine in WWE and WCW. In WCW he won the US Belt to lose it in one day to Goldberg. He could have been used better in WCW. They never allowed to wrestle Hogan, Macho Man, Hall, Nash, Sting or Hart. He could have had great feuds with any of those guys. When he returned to WWE he was mostly midcard but was in an awesome Wrestlemania hardcore match with Show and Kane.

  Raven left WWE early to go to TNA to make an impact. He had the greatest match in TNA History with Jeff Jarrett. He also had great matches with Sabu and AJ Styles. Raven helped build TNA from the ground up. He had a big impact and it was great to see him finally get rewarded for his hard work by winning the title in this ppv. He truly deserved it and I think all Raven fans should purchase the dvd for its significance.

  The ppv was the debut of Samoa Joe. It was a squash match. The X division match was the only other great match on the card. The rest of the card is just average or below average. I felt like this ppv was missing Jarrett. He should have wrestled on the ppv. He could have added another good match to the card that mostly felt like tv matches. Ron the Truth put on an okay match with Kip James. I think this for being a special TNA event lacked big time matches. It was disappointing.

  I recommend this to fans of Raven and fans of the history of wrestling. This ppv was not the best but it was an important ppv in the history of the company and Raven's career. It's too bad Raven's title run was brief. Cheers!",1399420800,,1706,4.053571428571429
