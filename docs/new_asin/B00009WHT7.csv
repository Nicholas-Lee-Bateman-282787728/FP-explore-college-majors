1895258,5,B00009WHT7,"This stars one of my favorite actors,Liu Chia Jen. He has starred in such epics as Thundering Mantis and Warriors Two.
This film is on par with these films.
Great action throughout,and a good story.
The DVD is hosted by Shaw Star Philip Ko Fei,who has a great interview and demonstration. The behind the scenes info is terrific.
Topping things off is a great documentary on the Shaw Studios hosted by David Chiang. See this at all costs!
A definite addition to the collection.

7993903,4,B00009WHT7,"This film is among the best non-Shaw Bros classic, old-school martial arts head-bangers I've ever seen.  It rates high up there with other non-Shaw films like Hapkido, Cantonen Iron Kung Fu, Snake And Crane Arts of Shaolin, and Dragon Fist. The only reason I didn't give the product itself five stars was that this copy, although clear enough, was not as crystal-clear as, say, the Celestial Video remasters of the Shaw Bros collection, or even some of the RED SUN video releases. I'm not saying the film quality was horrible; it was quite good. But it just was not as crystal clear as a fresh remaster from the original film would be. I don't know that such a remastered version of this film currently exists in the U.S. But anyway, this was a great film. If you buy it, you will not be sorry.  ""Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting! Hi-Yahh!""",1383696000,,838,4.58
7993904,4,B00009WHT7,"Sixty Second Assassin is a forgotten shapes film. The films stars Man Lee Pang,Leung Kar Yan,Lung Fei, Wong Chi Sang,Kong Ching Ha,Su Chen Ping,Dean Shek. This is one of Leung Kar Yans very good villian performances. he is the employer of Minute Fong(Wan Lee Pang),who is an Assassin that kills his enemies in under 60 seconds. Minute Fong wants to give the killing up to retire and live in a farm. But Leung Kar Yan has got a couple assignments before he can walk away. This Assassin story has been in many movies but what makes this one special is the fights. Good choreography from kicking and punching.

  Wan Lee Pang is a Taiwanese martial artist,and has only appeared in very few movies. He is also a villian in Kung Fu On Sale. The fight between him and Leung Kar Yan is indeed worth watching.

The Videoasia version is an extremely bad fullscreen copy. There is a widescreen version available. Get that version instead.",1330473600,,928,4.640243902439025
7993905,2,B00009WHT7,"One dimensional kungfu flick, with no out of the ordinary scenes that will impress. It is no different from the cheap fighting flicks that you would randomly select at your local video rental. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1200787200,,225,4.947368421052632
