8297459,2,B001EAWMR4,"The ultra-cheap production values of Seduction Cinema's early comedies such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gladiator-Eroticus/dp/B000056B0J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gladiator Eroticus</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mistress-Frankenstein/dp/B00004W5TQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mistress Frankenstein</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Erotic-Witch-Project-Collector-s-Edition-DVD/dp/B00003TKEJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Erotic Witch Project Collector's Edition DVD</a>&nbsp;are reflected in this spoof of `Iron Man'. The low-brow comedy is there and writer/director John Bacchus's liking for zany-looking incidental characters is also prevalent. There's even a cameo from grindhouse expert,  42nd Street Pete, in one of the crowd scenes. Unfortunately, some of Seduction's more recent comedies such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kinky-Kong/dp/B000FUTV5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kinky Kong</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloak-and-Shag-Her/dp/B000XSKDO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloak and Shag Her</a>', and now `Ironbabe', have all lacked the vital ingredients that those early comedies could boast: girl-girl only sex scenes that, although strictly softcore, at least tried to look as though something other than mere screen decoration might be taking place. Group scenes were also regularly included in the earlier films. In `Ironbabe', these ingredients are lacking.

Jackie Stevens takes the lead role of Horny Fark, purveyor of sex toys and owner of Fark Industries. Kidnapped by a band of ruthless politically correct terrorists, Horny is ordered to manufacture an atomic sex doll. The film nicely sends up `Iron Man' with a succession of cheap laughs, but it falls flat with its less than spicy erotic content. Jackie dons a number of sexy outfits throughout the movie and there are plenty of topless views as well as some striking glimpses of her delightful derriere. However, Horny's intimate interactions with reporter, Chesty Everhard (Sativa Verte), fellow captive, Titsen (Kerri Taylor), and her inept business partner, OBGYN Stain (Darian Caine), are pretty dire. To make things worse, there are a couple of so-called sex scenes with a man. This isn't the first time that Seduction has dallied with men in their sex scenes, but this studio's comedies work much better when these scenes are exclusively female.

With hardcore easily available, there are some who question the role that softcore has in supposedly erotic films such as `Ironbabe'. In my opinion, there is certainly a place for softcore material in films like this, but it needs to have at least a hint of realism. I cannot see the reasoning behind attempting to show heterosexual sex given the  restrictions that the filmmakers on this movie seem to have imposed on themselves. And as far as the lesbian sex scenes are concerned, Seduction seem to be almost apologetic about having to include them at all. They look more like stuttered attempts at dance routines as the actresses run their hands over each other but do not indulge in any other intimate contact, or even bother to appear to be doing so.

If you're hoping for something as good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spiderbabe/dp/B0000AOV6X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spiderbabe</a>, I think you'll be slightly disappointed. The enhanced production values on that movie compensated for the weaker sex scenes, whereas the bargain-basement values on `Ironbabe' should, in my view, have been counteracted by better and more imaginative sex scenes such as those in `Naughty Novelist' (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NAUGHTY-NOVELIST-EXCO-NAUGHTY-NOVELIST-EXCO/dp/B001D5F36W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NAUGHTY NOVELIST / (EXCO) - NAUGHTY NOVELIST / (EXCO)</a>) - a movie played as a straight-ahead sex film, but with a comedy slant.

The bonus material on `Ironbabe' is a little thin. There's an interview with Jackie Stevens and Alexia Moore which acts as a prelude to the short movie `Hot Property' in which they both feature. The interview segment is 17 minutes long and `Hot Property' is 16 minutes. However, both these items have already been issued on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lust-in-Space/dp/B000AM6P2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lust in Space</a>&nbsp;DVD. A couple of very short, very dull scenes  with Jackie Stevens and Sabrina Faire are also included in the bonus material, as are the usual array of trailers that Seduction tend to include. There's no behind-the-scenes featurette either - another thing that Seduction seem to have stopped doing of late.",1233878400,19,4894,6.8208
