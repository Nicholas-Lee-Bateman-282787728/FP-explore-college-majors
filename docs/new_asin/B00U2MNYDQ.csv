7027813,1,B00U2MNYDQ,"A movie of false teachers deceiving people, without presenting the true gospel. Chanting Jesus on a megaphone to people who don't speak your language is not representing Jesus or the good news very well. These guys are all counterfeit revivalists (I know, because I used to run in these circles). Todd White uses the leg growing trick that hucksters have been using for centuries.

7027834,3,B00U2MNYDQ,"This was a fun concept, and I understand that the Holy Spirit was most likely involved.  There were a few times that it felt ""forced"" which is disappointing because for a non-believer this would be enough to discount the entire film.  If you are someone who watched this and felt the same way, I recommend viewing ""Furious Love"" by the same people.

It was blessed. I don't 100% agree with some of their tactics but, it's still very blessed. :) I think the wisdom here is, we're waiting on God's spirit to move, and God's spirit is waiting on us to move.

7027889,5,B00U2MNYDQ,"I'm not sure if I like this better than the original Holy Ghost. I can't say. They are two different movies with different perspectives. I think I enjoyed Holy Ghost a little better because it was my first exposure to any of WP films so the element of surprise added much to my introduction to this producer's work.

I bought this movie after a mini film festival where I was able to watch for free, a previous film each day, that finished with a showing of Holy Ghost and an offer to buy Holy Ghost Reborn. I could not pass up buying Reborn after being so blessed with WP films approach to promoting their product. Amazingly well done! These guys are masters of media in more ways than is obvious. They have created a subgenre of spiritual documentary that is Holy Ghost led.

I believe they have pulled it off very well. I learned much about evangelism that I had no idea was so effective. I can't say enough about where WP films is leading us.",1456099200,18,946,4.369318181818182

Its all for the glory of God not only do I know my money is well invested in a Godly place, I know God wanted me to see this! Be blessed and open up your eyes an hearts! You can NOT keep God in your own little box. Jesus is coming back soon. Not crazy the world is ending stuff, but hey this is all about love and saving your neighbor stuff!! Time is running out! Everyday we waster not saving souls for the kingdom of God is another day we will regret when we come face to face with Jesus and review our life!!!",1455667200,5,618,3.9126984126984126

7027913,5,B00U2MNYDQ,"This is such a great contrast to the modern world that is full of rationalism and politics and distraction, but uttering missing something important. This isn't likely to convince someone who isn't open to the possibility of God, but wow, if you are open, better yet, if your ready to say yes to a God that loves us, that loves you, and want to get to know God, this might be just the right thing for you now.

Darren and crew, thank you for saying yes.  I've been drawn to your work like it was water in a desert.  Still reeling from the reality you've documented, not sure how to fit it in to my worldview.  I honestly was thinking that somehow, God wanted me to somehow become more like Todd in my following but it really hit me the second time I watched it.  It's to be more like you Darren! :)  You said yes and God used you, leads you, from your world, in your life. It's the ""yes"" that's the most important step, not the how.  It's the yes.  Yes, yes, yes, yes!!",1449014400,6,969,4.172043010752688

8704048,1,B00U2MNYDQ,"The film is worthless. It's 2 to 3 different men that go around the World, touching people and saying they've just received the Holy Spirit. Then jumping up and down with glee when the person receiving the HS? says there is 'something' they're feeling.
I live in 'Vegas. On many street corners, esp. along the north Strip and Boulder Highway you can watch similar 'shows' by people claiming the same results.",1512691200,,408,4.76056338028169
