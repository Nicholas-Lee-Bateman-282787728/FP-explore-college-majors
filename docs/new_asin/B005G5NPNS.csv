4688964,2,B005G5NPNS,"I bought this for my husband because he loves Warren Miller. However, we were so disappointed because there was NO Warren Miller. Skiing was fine but it didn't have the Warren Miller humor, narration, etc. Even the filming was not ""Warren Milleresque."" Disappointing.",1358640000,,267,5.232558139534884

4688968,3,B005G5NPNS,"First off I am a huge Warren Miller fan.  It is normally the best way to kick start your winter with the annual Warren Miller Movie.  However Wintervention left me wanting more.  The film had a cheesy (more then usual) feel, sloppy production, interesting soundtrack selection, poor sound...etc.  The footage is still good, and the locations are great. Overall it was a bit disappointing.",1351728000,,388,5.015625

8471161,5,B005G5NPNS,I've seen probably 15 Warren Miller movies all recently and within the last decade. This and Dynasty are my favorites. Be careful opening this (I guess with all DVDs). I pried too hard to open and cracked the disk and got to buy it twice. I know its exciting but be gentle.,1392163200,,273,4.269230769230769
