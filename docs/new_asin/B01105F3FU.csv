8723239,5,B01105F3FU,"This film made in 1939 employs his vaudeville formula based on his prior career as a vaudeville entertainer.  As usual, Fields is the owner or manager of a traveling circus and just one step ahead of the law which is pursuing him for unpaid debts.  As usual, he is the single father of an attractive adult daughter who provides the main female role.

Ventriloquism was apparently popular at this time as much of the film involves a ventriloquist from the circus with his dummy.  An interesting part has an animal trainer handling real lions and alligators with his hands.  The rest is Fields in his typical vaudeville role trying to con everyone.  A standard subplot has his daughter engaged to a high society young man with Fields managing to torpedo the marriage just by his presence.

Near the end, Fields again manages to do something memorable to make this film different from his other films based on the same formula.  He engages in a hilarious ping pong match after presenting himself as a ping pong champion.",1441584000,,1017,4.738636363636363
