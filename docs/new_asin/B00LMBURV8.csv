6491514,4,B00LMBURV8,"Following up on last years impressive release, Scream Factory unleashes another seven tales of classic terror with The Vincent Price Collection II. Treasures found on this volume include The Raven, The Comedy of Terrors, The Tomb of Ligeia, The Last Man On Earth, Dr. Phibes Rises Again!, The Return of the Fly, and House on Haunted Hill. None of these films have ever been given a Blu-ray upgrade until now.

The Vincent Price Collection II is an interesting mix of different movies from the icons long career. We get two more of his Edgar Allan Poe entries both directed by Roger Corman. The sequels Dr. Phibes Rises Again! and The Return of the Fly are found as well. There must be some sort of issue with the licensing for The Fly since it hasn't been released yet on one of the sets.

It also brings together two of the actors most over-used movies in his illustrious career. Both The Last Man On Earth and House on Haunted Hill have shown up on virtually every classic horror film collection you can find in a bargain bin at Wal-Mart, Target, or the likes. Theyre finally given a proper restoration and the attention they truly deserve.

The Comedy of Terrors is the follow-up to The Raven. Although it wasn't based on Edgar Allan Poe stories, screenwriter Richard Matheson brings together an all-star cast of genre greats in an attempt to upstage its predecessor. Price is joined by Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre again. This time they're accompanied by Basil Rathbone. Funnyman Joe E. Brown brings the comedy to the four terrors just like the title of the film proclaims.

Each of the movies packaged in The Vincent Price Collection II is presented in 1080p High-Definition with Dolby Digital 2.0 audio. Common sense dictates that none of these movies have ever looked or sounded as good as they do here. Audiences will be pleased with the overall production of the set.

Scream Factory loads up every disc of The Vincent Price Collection II with great special features. Introductions and parting words are delivered by Price for the Poe films and The Comedy of Terrors. Audio commentary is provided by several people including Roger Corman, Actor Elizabeth Shepherd, and Authors David Del Valle and Derek Botelho. They also contain featurettes, sill galleries, trailers, TV spots, and a promotional record. A 32-page booklet with an essay by Author David Del Valle includes rare photos.

The Vincent Price Collection II is a must-have set for every collector of classic horror or the actors work. Its a great mix of the Master of Terrors finest moments working with legendary filmmakers like Roger Corman and William Castle. No home entertainment library filled with tales of the macabre is complete without this second batch of thrilling movies.",1414022400,17,2754,4.886509635974304

6491516,5,B00LMBURV8,I am absolutly in love with vol 1 and can't wait for vol 2. Yes.  I think the choices of films are a bit sub par from vol 1 but scream does great job and I'm sure they will deliver for vol 2.  I think when they introduce vol 3. That will be the real home run.  I think the 2 nd vol Is a bit disapointing because they want to knock it out of the park with vol  3.  Theatre of blood.  The raven.  Madhouse. Scream and scream again. Tower of London. Diary of a mad man. Twice told tales.  Cry of the banshee  just saying. :). Please,1407801600,5,529,3.779816513761468
6491517,2,B00LMBURV8,"Am I the only one who find this selection of films kinda ""Mehhhh""?? - While Volume 1 had a mouth-watering selection of classic VP horror flicks - this volume seems to be a lot of subpar choices and comedic filler even though many of the great offerings previously available on the ""Midnite Movies"" DVD series are still unreleased on BR and others like ""Diary Of A Madman"" have only been released on DVD-R.",1407456000,10,405,4.561643835616438
6491518,1,B00LMBURV8,"I am very reticent to purchase Set 2 of the Vincent Price Collection.  Why?  Shout! Factory has degenerated into a company that simply puts movies and television shows on dvd without any endeavor for quality.  Case in point: ""Nosferatu The Vampyre"" (1979).  Placed on Blu-ray; and one of the worst picture quality dvd's I have ever seen on Blu-ray.  They simply have transfered a very bad copy of this movie onto a Blu-ray format.  And they are coming out with the Werner Herzog Collection--and they state the same movie of Nosferatu is the one that is included in the set.  Very bad.  They also are releasing Newhart: The Series.  Not Blu-ray, but very poor picture quality; and some of the episodes are edited.  At least one I have found.
No; the Shout! Factory that released The Vincent Price Collection Volume 1 (Which I do own and recommend), is not the same company releasing material today.  They cannot be trusted; and I am not going through the hassle to find out if they have done a truly excellent job, at least for this collection.  Not after ""Nosferatu The Vampyre"".

6491519,5,B00LMBURV8,"THE VINCENT PRICE COLLECTION 2, though not quite as stellar as the first installment, is still well worth owning. HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL has Vincent staging a contest to see who will remain after a night spent in the title abode. William Castle lets the cheddar flow, as Vincent basically gives a guided tour through a zany funhouse. THE RETURN OF THE FLY (sequel to THE FLY) features Vincent in a supporting role, aiding the son of Phillipe, the scientist from the original, far superior film. This one's pretty good, just don't expect a classic! THE COMEDY OF TERRORS includes the dream line-up of Price, Peter Lorre, Basil Rathbone, and Boris Karloff! As the title implies, it's hilarious. The chemistry between the stars is wonderful! Directed by Jacques Tourneur. THE RAVEN is another Corman take on a Poe story. The result is pure magic, especially the Price / Karloff face-off during the ""duel of the wizards"" segment! My personal favorite of this collection. THE LAST MAN ON EARTH is the grim, dark film, based on Matheson's I AM LEGEND. Vincent is brilliant as the title character, going about his nightly struggle for survival against marauding vampires! He's never been better or more serious! TOMB OF LIGIEA is about a newly married man (Price) and his obsession w/ his departed wife. Obviously, this puts strain on his marriage, some of it possibly supernatural! DR. PHIBES RISES AGAIN is, of course, the sequel to THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES. The maniacal Dr. is back, still trying to resurrect his well-preserved wife. Vulnavia returns, though played by someone else, to assist him in his quest. The scene shifts to Egypt, w/ Robert Quarry (COUNT YORGA VAMPIRE, THE RETURN OF COUNT YORGA, DEATHMASTER, MADHOUSE) on hand as Phibes' nemesis. Great stuff!

At around $8 a film the price is good too. The films may be second tier b movies but with Vincent in them the movies are entertaining and keep your interest. Vincent Price was the last american horror icon and watching him in these films reminds me of what a great artist he was. He was the high point of all of his movies he displayed great range in depth as an actor whether villan or victim you loved watching Price.

the commentary was recorded few months before he passed away and Robert had lots of Difficulty
 recalling scenes he shot for the film i heard another commentator asking him questions about scenes in the film

He is my Uncle Vincent rest his soul as he always even while acting reached out to you to join him in his escapades without saying as much. The quality is quite good and the commentaries are very interesting, filling in and answering questions you might have about location or co-stars.

Vincent was the last of a rare breed of actor. Horror was not his only forte and the comedic moments such as in ""The Raven"" prove that. I miss him terribly but at least I can have a marathon of his films vol 1+2 whenever I wish.",1419638400,,642,4.169354838709677

6491563,5,B00LMBURV8,"Having purchased the first Vincent Price Collection a year ago I had high expectations for this second dose and was not disappointed.  In fact I think I prefer the films on this second set to the first one.

Although opinions on the films themselves will differ from person to person, Dr. Phibes Rises Again, The Comedy of Terrors, The Last Man on Earth and The House on Haunted Hill are all classics.  The Raven and The Tomb of Ligeia are perhaps a notch below and the less said about Return of The Fly the better.

The transfers are all fine, perhaps not spectacular in all cases, but all the films look better than they ever have.  These prints have not been cleaned up the way Criterion treats their films but they all shine for 40 and 50 year old movies.  I didn't see any banding, digital manipulation or any other artifacts.  These films all look quite good.

Extras are plentiful and diverse (except on Dr. Phibes Rises Again which is a disappointment) and the booklet is well put together and informative.

Scream Factory should be applauded for bringing these films back to the public in a great edition and perhaps in doing so introducing (or re-introducing) the late, great Vincent Price to audiences all over again.  He was an incredibly talented actor and I find his performances fascinating in film after film.  My appreciation of him as a performer grows with each new film of his I see.

Please don't hesitate to pick up this fun set and hopefully in a year Scream Factory will be putting out a third volume as there's many more classic Vincent Price films yet to be collected.",1414454400,20,1594,4.593639575971731
6491564,3,B00LMBURV8,"All the films are sharp, but if the films were run through a wash, they could've used a couple more runs. The Last Man on Earth is especially dirty, which is annoying to pay this much money to watch crud. The Raven looks fantastic! But the movie's dumb and way overrated--the acting is far too hammy and a 20-something Jack Nicholson proves he's not yet ready to turn in any Oscar-worthy performance.

I like the commentary tracks. Too bad there's not one on Comedy of Terrors, a truly humorous movie; Price & Co. are not over the top or mugging for the camera as they are in Raven.

The back of the packaging states: ""Also Includes 32-Page Book With An Essay By Author David Del Valle And Rare Photos""

Not there.

The omission doesn't surprise me; SHOUT! Factory is a third-rate distributor out to make a quick buck on old movies and B fare studios don't want to devote time to marketing themselves. It's not the only mistake on the packaging; they didn't list the commentary track on The Raven, either. I'm glad it's there, but its omission on the packaging is a sign of incompetence.

Also, if you don't speak or read English, you're out of luck--only English 2.0 audio tracks and English captions. No Spanish, French or Portuguese language options is is the case with most US Region A blu-ray releases.",1414281600,4,1307,4.592274678111588

Special Features

Each film has a slideshow and theatrical trailer
Most come with commentaries. Ligea has 3 but the Phibes sequel has none.
There are several documentaries on the films, Price, and AIP Poe/Corman films.

It is too bad that the 2 Phibes films can't get released together. Also, the 7 Poe/Corman films should all be released together in a mega collection.

Return of the Fly is an excellent film and should be paired with the other films. It seems out of place here.

As does House on Haunted Hill. It should be paired with The Tingler and other William Castle films.

It is so nice to see these movies on a Blu Ray because these movies came out before my time, so I never saw them in a theatre. Seeing a movie on TV, on standard definition broadcast TV, or from a DVD, is never like really seeing the movie. Watching HD video on a big screen is great.",1460073600,,434,4.117647058823529
8666629,4,B00LMBURV8,"A second set of Price's thrillers and horror movies from Shout (under their Scream Factory imprint), the second edition is pretty much the equal of the first (not so the third which, while including some terrific movies, is missing classics like ""Theatre of Blood"" which Shout could not get the rights to at the time of release).

As with the previous set, these are loaded with some terrific special features including commentary tracks, etc. and the transfers here, largely, look very good to exceptional although keep in mind there was little to no restoration done for these titles.

""The Raven"" and ""The Comedy of Terrors"" are two horror/comedies that some terrific performances and humorous stories (although I don't think that the latter is quite as funny, it features a terrific performance from Karloff). Richard Matheson wrote the script for both films. Both feature Karloff and Lorre while the later includes Basil Rathebone as well. All of the performers do a terrific job with Matheson's witty scripts.

""The Tomb of Ligeia"" is certainly a highlight of this set and  one of the best written of the Corman pictures. Scripted by Robert Towne (Oscar winner and writer of ""Chinatown"", ""The Two Jakes"", ""Tequilla Sunrise"" and ""Personal Best"" as well as writer on various television programs including ""The Outer Limits""), Corman's direction is well paced and the approach to the material also benefits from being shot on location in the UK. The transfer here is exceptionally good.

""The Last Man on Earth"" should also be noted as it was based on the novel by Richard Matheson (who also wrote the screenplay under a pseudonym of Logan Swann when he wasn't happy with the changes they made when it was shot). It's, largely, themost faithful adaptation of Matheson's novel I Am Legend (which spawned three other films--""I Am Legend"", ""The Omega Man"" and--indirectly--""Night of The Living Dead"" which George Romero had in mind when he co-scripted that film).

The transfer looks OK but there is occasional dirt, grit and some print damage noticeable. Still, it does improve on the previous DVD giving improved depth and a nice smattering of grain. Since this film fell into the public domain (as I recall), I doubt that there will be much in the way of a restoration done and MGM just provides the same transfer (albeit a high def one) as they did for the DVD release from six years ago.

The bulk of the rest of the times including ""The Raven"", ""The Comedy of Terrors"", ""Dr. Phibes Rises Again!"", ""The Return of The Fly"" look from very good to exceptional. All of them have a bit of white speckles that show up from time to time.  ""House on Haunted Hill"" looks, surprisingly, the most robust for a film of its age.

We get an Introduction and Parting Words  for three of the films here (""The Raven"", ""The Comedy of Terrors"" and ""The Tomb of Liegeia"") as well as portions of the documentary ""Richard Matheson: Storyteller"" for the three films in this set that he wrote. Sadly, ""Phibes"" gets only the theatrical trailer and still gallery for the film. I would have loved to hear a commentary on the second film which was a rushed sequel to the first and didn't really allow enough time for gestating a solid story that didn't follow the formula of the first films.

""Ligeia"", ""Earth"", ""Fly"" and ""Hill"" all have commentary tracks provided by actors and film historians discussing the work. We also get a featurette for ""Hill"" that is entitled ""Vincent Price: Renaissance Man"" and ""The Art of Fear"" as well as ""Working With Vincent Price"". All three featurettes are very good.

While the quality may dip a bit for some of these films (and without the ability to license ""Twice Told Tales"" and ""Theatre of Blood"" which should have been included in this set or the third), the featurettes, documentaries and commentary tracks all make this an essential purchase.

As with the first set, Scream provides us with a booklet with an excellent essay on Price by David Del Valle (I do wish that Shout/Scream had asked someone to do a essay on the best film in the last collction as well as that set only has a booklet with behind-the-scenes pictures).

All of this makes this set recommended.

The film features a portion of a documentary on Matheson's career as a writer as a special feature.",1459123200,4,4287,4.789972899728998
