8653300,4,B00JQHOI6U,"I saw this dvd movie, and what I like was the sharpness of the film.  However, what I did not like, was the fact that many scenes were edited
and the accompanying music score was cut short.  All the moving scenes have a music detailing the moves, but they were cut short.  I also saw
Lightning Guns and this was a little better.  Columbia must make sure the edition of a particular part is complete, and when the cowboys are
riding horses, the music should be left as it was originally intended.  When I was a kid, I saw these Durango Kid movies even 3 times during
the showing and I memorized the music that I was always whistling it, until I memorize it.  Congratulations to Columbia/Sony for bringing them
out to the public.  Oh, by the way, if the future releases are not edited in the original format, the price should not be more than $12.95 each.",1467158400,,853,4.360759493670886

8653303,4,B00JQHOI6U,"There is little that needs to be said. You either love/like the ""Durango Kid"" westerns or you aren't bothered. I love em tho I'm not always sure why. In ""HAWK"" we have a typical actioner directed by the reliable Fred F. Sears with plenty of action, including the obligatory mysterious appearences as if by magic of Durango with different clothes and horse to what he had 1 minute before. Who cares? A good fight with Eddie Parker and plenty of gunfire and chases, with a bonus of a good performence by Clay Moore as The Hawk. A bigger part than he usually got between his Lone Ranger work. Jack Mahoney and John Cason are also around. As I said above, I'm not always sure why I like these Durangos when there is so much Smiley Burnette. This is obviously just a personal dislike, but I feel like warning others who may feel the same that Smiley (and Sid Saylor) have almost 20 minutes of screen time made up of silly outdated comedy ""Schtick"". But if that doesn't put you off you have a great quality transfer of a good long unseen Western. Regardless of Smiley (he is my problem) I will continue to get these Sony Collection DVDs. Recomended",1409270400,,1142,4.4688995215311005

8653305,5,B00JQHOI6U,"Sony Entertainment houses the Columbia Pictures archive and there are a couple dozen Durango Kid/Charles Starrett Westerns that have never seen the light of day in decades. Fans of the cowboy Westerns have their checklists and while Sony appears to be randomly selecting Durango Kid Westerns from the vault, with no care as to which films should be the priority, this was one of them. Until this movie was released on DVD, the only print we had to contend with was a Portugese print. Not joking here. The picture and sound for this print transfer is superb. Keep up the good work Sony!",1402876800,,585,4.689320388349515
8653306,5,B00JQHOI6U,"Slowly Sony Pictures is releasing on DVD-R discs many of the classic ""Durango Kid""  B-Westerns once put out by Columbia in the 1940s and early 1950s. I grew up with some of these charmers, along with Hopalong Cassidy (on TV), Wild Bill Elliott, Johnny Mack Brown, and Gene Autry...but I've always loved Durango. For me actor Charles Starrett WAS Durango, and even if I knew that it was make-believe, I really wanted it to be true, I wanted justice to triumph, and good to triumph over evil.

Here's is one more in Sony's continuing releasing, and it's a good one. Smiley Burnette is here, plus the usual cast of fine co-stars, including those ""baddies"" we loved to hate. The plot is simple, but the action is fierce and highly enjoyable. And the good guys win.

By my count now, Sony has now released around eleven ""Durangos"" on DVD, so there are many more presumably in the vaults. Here's hoping they will continue to make them available to us old cowpoke-wannabes!

Recommended to all of you interested in a classic and very unique genre of American cinema, and those who just enjoy a great ""shoot'em up.""",1402790400,,1107,4.661538461538462
8653307,5,B00JQHOI6U,"As tough as it was to finally see this (among many lost Charles Starrett westerns) it seemed a carrier (in training) finally locating my address made it seem even more difficult to get this masterpiece. In any case, it was well worth the wait. Without giving away any of the plot, I have to say I have never seen Clayton (The Lone Ranger) Moore in a more ruthless and deadlier role. I saw Clayton Moore in person (with sunglasses replacing his mask) at New York's Commodore Hotel. This was back in the 1980s. I stood about eight feet away from Moore as he did a gun-twirling demonstration for a little kid. Buster Crabbe was there as well. Johnny Weissmuller was scheduled to appear, but had to cancel, reportedly due to a stroke. It would have been my first time ever seeing him in person...and a chance to film him with my 8mm movie camera. I am in total agreement with Herschel (as well as another reviewer elsewhere) re: the inappropriate photograph on the DVD's packaging. Why would Sony omit a photo of the main star, Charles Starrett/The Durango Kid on the DVD's cover, and substitute it with sidekick, Smiley Burnette and Syd Saylor?? Not to mention Charles Starrett's name being listed near the bottom of the credits within an ad for the pending DVD release?? Was that done for some kind of legal reason...or was the person(s) in charge of the packaging totally unfamiliar with the main star, Charles Starrett? Prior to the release of this rare Starrett title (with hopefully, more soon to come)  the talk in some (not all) fan circles was, if released for sale, the Starretts would not sell very well. Nothing could be farther from the truth!! There is indeed a huge western fan base out there (including yours truly) anxiously awaiting DVD releases on those lost Charles Starrett western titles. In the meantime Sony, if you are really serious about selling the Charles Starrett western titles, placing his photo (and name) first on the DVDs covers would certainly enhance the chances on huge sales! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this western movie!",1400284800,3,2049,4.75561797752809
8653308,5,B00JQHOI6U,"This review is being written before receiving the item. Sony does it again by bringing a rare Durango Kid movie to fans of the masked western avenger. Having not received the DVD, I can still give this 5 stars because Sony has released excellent quality in the past and there is no reason to think that this one won't be the same. As for the movie, I give it 5 stars because I viewed the movie in Portugese in order to provide an accurate summary in my 2012 book entitled Durango. In this one, the Durango Kid (Charles Starrett) is pitted against Clayton ""Lone Ranger"" Moore. Moore is excellent in whatever he does but I like him as a bad guy. He portrays the Hawk, an arrow shooting, law-breaking, not to be trusted, bad son-of-a-gun. The movie moves at a fast clip and Smiley Burnette is not a hindrance. Smiley, garbed in Indian attire, gets hypnotized by Syd Saylor, and rides off before being brought out of it, resulting in quite a few laughs. Hope Sony comes out with Ridin the Outlaw Trail, Fort Savage Raiders, Horsemen of the Sierras, Outcast of Black Mesa, etc. but please, put Durango on the DVD cover and not Rory Mallinson, and other supporting stars. That masked guy on the cover might even net a few more sales. The supporting characters are very good but they belong on the back. The cover should be reserved for Charles Starrett as The Durango Kid or himself.",1398643200,5,1377,4.512
