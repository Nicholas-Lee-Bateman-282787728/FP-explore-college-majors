5890039,5,B00E4GT66A,"This is the latest from uber talented twenty three year old French Canadian actor/director/writer, Xavier Dolan (check out the wonderful `Hearbeats'). This tells the tale of Lawrence Alia played by Melvil Poupaud. He in in a slightly unorthodox relationship with his girlfriend Fred Belair (Suzanne Clement `I Killed My Mother'). He is also a lecturer and is as challenging, provocative and sensationalist in his teaching as he is in his domestic life. Then he drops the bombshell that he was born in the wrong body and wants to live the rest of his life as a woman, and he means to go all the way.

The full story is told by going back to the time they were first together and tracking the ups and downs of their relationship from the beginning. So we start ten years earlier and the soundtrack reflects the time, so we have the likes of Depeche Mode, the Cure and Duran Duran to spice things up. The use of `The Funeral Party' to juxtapose the atmosphere of the disco was really powerful. Melvil Poupaud is a very attractive man and his first attempts at sartorial femininity would make `Mr. Garrison' of `South Park fame quite proud. But as he develops he makes a really convincing woman so a pretty good effort for all concerned.

If you have seen any of Dolan's previous work then you will expect there to be great and challenging camera angles and on screen shenanigans that are anything but trying to be realistic. Instead the great use of colour and symbolism as well as imagery all make for a sumptuous cinematic feast. He also knows when to let the camera tell the story with no dialogue, lots of meaningful shots of people just looking or staring.

This is also challenging the `heterosexual orthodoxy', so Bruce LaBruce would be proud, but it does so by contextualising the story of Lawrence and not by grandstanding. This is also full of moments of Grand Theatre and is visually stunning. The acting is superb and one could almost say dynamic. For such a simple plot line, Dolan has managed to dig so deep to explore all of the depths that make someone who they actually are, not just what they think they are supposed to be.

This is in French with some English and really, very good sub titles as the translation was partly done by Xavier Dolan too and has a run time of 168 minutes, which may be an issue for some, but I thought every second was used brilliantly, I can not recommend highly enough.",1391212800,2,2414,4.568129330254042

You are led to believe that the film is about someone transitioning, yet it isn't. It's all about the girlfriend and what she wants. This movie was painful to watch. The ending was very upsetting to me. It showed that if someone screamed at you enough and humiliated you enough, you'd become what they wanted.

5890042,4,B00E4GT66A,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Laurence Anyways""

1. This is a bittersweet, whimsical romantic drama about a high school teacher, Laurence, and his girlfriend. When Laurence tells her that he is a woman trapped in a man's body, the couple struggle to figure out what their relationship means.

2. The movie handles the subject of being transgender with an even hand, without getting hysterical or exploitative.

3. It does a good job of explaining that being transgender isn't the same as being gay.

4. Given the struggles of transgender people for understanding and acceptance, there are scenes of discrimination and pain. We see the fallout with his girlfriend, his family, and his job.

5. But this isn't a pity party movie. It's strong and sensitive and even joyous, sometimes. And it's a realistic look at the pressures on a relationship when someone switches genders.

6. The movies shows the fluid nature of love and sexuality - and makes you think about what it means when you fall in love with somebody.

7. Visually, the movie sometimes leaves reality and reaches into the fantastic, and becomes a sort of visual poetry.

8. The movie is three hours long, which is a little too long. It drags some things out longer than necessary.

8. Despite the length of the film, this is a charming tragedy about difficult life circumstances.",1388361600,2,1339,4.863436123348017
5890043,5,B00E4GT66A,"The hype surrounding `Lawrence Anyways' had me anxious from the very start.  Having seen and loved what Xavier Dolan did with `Heartbeats', I was really excited for the next step of his career.  With a clear knack for style, I was truly happy to hear all the talk about the substance found within `Laurence Anyways'.  I have not seen `I Killed My Mother', Dolan's debut (but I plan to shortly), but I did note that as beautiful and soulful as `Heartbeats' was, it was very much like `Jules et Jim' without substance.  If Dolan could mesh his undeniable sense of visual with a richly developed core, he could create a true masterpiece.

`Laurence Anyways' is a masterpiece.

To say that Xavier Dolan may be the best thing to happen to queer cinema is an understatement, although it really does bear repeating.  It goes deeper than that though.  Dolan is one of the freshest, most excited faces in modern cinema, period.  With voices such as Dolan and McQueen and Zeitlin (let's see what he does with film #2), things are looking really good for the future of film.

`Laurence Anyways' is one of those films that are hard to shake once you see it.  I watched this last night and I'm still shaken from the experience.  I have seen very few films that have affected me in the same way, possibly none to be honest.  With `Laurence Anyways', Dolan has created one of the finest films ever composed, every crafted and ever completed.  The reason for this is hard to put into words because quite frankly the reason isn't so simple.  In fact, finding a way to shape my thoughts here into a review is proving to be extremely difficult because it find that I have so much to say and yet no idea of where to start or how to coherently express them.  I have been touched so deeply by this film and I fear I'll never be able to do these feelings justice.

But I'll try.

The film's plot follows a thirty-five year old teacher named Laurence who has been in a relationship with Fred (short for Frederique) for four years.  They are a perfect match, and the first twenty minutes or so of the film do a beautiful job of exposing their fit to us.  We see them laugh and play and connect on a level that goes beyond average relationships.  Then the waters of their relationship are stirred deeply when Laurence exposes his deepest, darkest secret.  Laurence has been struggling with an internal contradiction.  His body is clearly male and yet his mind tells him that he is female.  He hates his reflection and finds his appearance repulsive.  He wants to finally live the life he was meant to live.  This is obviously a shock to Fred, who takes a moment to collect her thoughts before diving headfirst into her new relationship with Laurence, one that isn't so clearly defined and yet more honest and genuine.  Determined to make things work, the hard times are only beginning, and the remainder of the film tackles this beautiful relationship as it grows, shatters, mends and then ultimately comes to terms over the course of ten years.

The beautiful thing about `Laurence Anyways' is that it has such natural light.  It feels so blatantly honest and sincere, never falling into clich&eacute;d plot-holes or fashioning itself on a familiar `Hollywood' course.  There were so many opportunities for Dolan to milk his character's situation or produce scenes of obvious manipulation (that bar scene could have gone a completely different direction, as could the board meeting scene) and yet Dolan knows where his focus needs to be and so he delivers a film that feels very invested in truth and a natural progression and presentation of character.  It would have been so easy to purely sympathize with Laurence and make everyone in his way out to be a villain or sorts, but Dolan gives us a complete story without prejudice.  The film felt so pure and non-judgmental.  We come to understand, not only Laurence and Fred but everyone, from Laurence's mother to Fred's sister thanks to the layers of detail that Dolan gives each character.

I also applaud how un-sexualized this film is.  When you think of transsexual storylines, it would have been so easy to exploit the sexuality of Laurence, maybe making that a plot point in itself, but Dolan refuses such lazy plotting.  Instead he really made this a character piece that spoke to the inner person and not the sexual side of things, which I found to be so effective and refreshing.  Even the idea that Laurence was not gay made the focus of this film not on his sexuality but on the inner struggle of identity itself.  Really, Dolan kept the focus of this film in the right place every step of the way, and I truly applaud him for that.

But Dolan is not the only person who made this film work.  The performances he coaxes out of his two leads (as well as a few of his supporting players) is astonishing.  As the title character, Melvil Poupaud has a very heavy task.  He has to convincingly portray an attractive masculine man who desires to be, and then completely transforms into, a woman.  He does this with fearless abandon.  The inner turmoil is heartbreaking, but even more than that, the confidence he imbues his character towards the films end is remarkable.  Suzanne Clement is a true revelation here though.  She owns this movie.  As the jilted Fred, her cycle of emotions is so hard to watch, it is that real and exposed.

And still, the film's merits don't end there.  Dolan is a true showman, and he knows how to frame his films in a way that tug at all of our senses.  Visually, `Laurence Anyways' is haunting.  The natural light used seeps into every frame to highlight the actors, their faces, their clothes (Clement is dressed to the hilt every time) and the use of music here is crushing.  Not only is Nioa's score perfectly placed within the fabric of the film, but Dolan's understanding of music in general and his composition of the film's soundtrack is stellar.  The final scene is already a doozy (I was bawling like a baby) but the use of Craig Armstrong's `Let's Go Out Tonight' was genius.  The only other director I can think of that understands the importance of music within a film is Sophia Coppola.

In the end, `Laurence Anyways' is a film about self-discovery and loving one's self, but it is also a sharp and brutally honest look at truly loving another person and the lasting stain they will leave on your soul no matter where their life's journey takes them.",1383264000,10,6430,4.627537511032656

5890045,5,B00E4GT66A,"This is a strong, disconcerting, highly unconventional movie that is not easy to review, or to watch. Although it is the story of a transgender experience and how it affects existing relationships, it is much more than that.

The movie is so strong and so complex--and so long--that I'm reluctant to say much more about it, partly because I don't know much else to say about it now. I'll need to watch it at least one more time before I'm ready even to think about doing that. I can say, though, that anyone expecting a love story about attractive and sympathetic characters will be severely disappointed and probably angry.

Anyone expecting a positive account of what it's like to change gender identity will probably be disappointed too. Anyone who needs the orderly development of a story and the relatable characters that are essential in Hollywood movies will be furious after having sat through these nearly three hours of VERY unconventional and challenging movie-making.

Finally, anyone who enjoys picking a movie apart and saying what he or she would do to make it better--eliminate peripheral characters, cut an hour off the movie's length, etc--will have a field day with this one. Unfortunately for them (and for anyone who takes what they say seriously), they will have denied themselves most of what this remarkable movie offers them.

The only way to receive what a movie (or any other work of art) offers is to accept it AS IT IS, on its own terms, WITHOUT trying to analyze it or change it to fit some outside notion (""outside"" meaning in YOUR mind, as opposed to the author's) of what it OUGHT to be.

Instead of trying to make this (or any other) movie ""better"", either make your own movie or let go of your compulsion to control what happens to you as you watch this one. If you don't like the experience, that's fine, but if you really believe you could have done it better, you're a fool. You're impressing (and cheating) nobody but yourself and anybody else who takes you seriously.

But anyone who wants to see the latest work of an extraordinarily gifted and original young artist (Xavier Dolan, who is not yet 25 years old), whose genius is exploding into the world with such power and such speed that even he probably can't explain everything he does--and is willing to let go, to give up control of the experience and see what DOLAN is showing you instead of what you want to see--will be changed by this astonishing movie.",1366156800,,2453,4.706293706293707

Could have been a great love story, instead it was on and off and and off of the same thing. The first two movies of the director were a good balance between the sensual and the intellectual, the poetic and the prosaic. But it seems like that in his last three movies he just stuck with gimmicky and eye candy visuals, and a lot of melodramatic episodes. I got sick at some point.

5890053,5,B00E4GT66A,"A selection of the opening lines of Laurence Anyways reads like this:

What are you looking for, Laurence Alia?

Im looking for a person who understands my language and speaks it. A person who, without being a pariah, will question not only the rights and the value of the marginalized, but also those of the people who claim to be normal.

Dolans ambitious third feature stumbles, like its main character, through Laurence's transformation from man to woman. Its messy and overlong but much more brave and worthwhile than most films youll see this year.

In French Canada during the late 1980s, Laurence and Frederique (Fred) fall for one another. However after a period of dating, Laurence tells her that he wants to become woman. Their decade long struggle ensues.

When Laurence tells her of his ambivalence towards his gender, she says, Everything I love about you, you hate. They are each faced with the deep pain of this predicament. He, after being vulnerable about his identity, is rejected by the woman he loves. She is humiliated by his violation of her vulnerable love for him. Its easier to sympathize with Laurence, but it should be noted that Fred is being told by the person she loves, that he does not love that part of himself that she is deeply attached to. I feel both of their immense pain.

I could never tell exactly what Fred is thinking. She either loves Laurence, male or female, and isn't brave enough to face society's rejection of him, or she doesnt love Laurence but cant face herself for rejecting him based on his new gender preference.

Picture

Early on, Fred tells her sister: Our generation can take this. Were ready for it

Later in the film, we discover how unready she was. She flips out and screams at the waitress in a crowded restaurant, upset by the waitress prying questions about Laurence. Afterwards, she says to Laurence while running away from him, Between you and me, who really needs to be fixed? The answer to this question is clear, despite Freds assertion. Laurence knows her own identity, but Fred is lost.

Laurence Anyways won Best Actress in the Un Certain Regard competition at the Cannes Film Festival in 2012, as well as Best Canadian Feature at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival. Aspects of it will frustrate you, like the overwhelming length and prevalence of artsy shots that sometimes feel forced. That may matter to you during the film and right after, but not next week. Next week youll remember the humanity, the struggle we all face between the aspects of us that make us normal and those that push us into the margins, and thats what really matters.

5890054,5,B00E4GT66A,"If you don't mind a little reading with your movie watching, than this movie will be worth the effort! I kept hitting pause and checking the packaging because I could NOT believe that this was filmed recently versus 2 decades ago! It is such a true depiction of life in the 90's and furthermore on a topic most of us didn't even hear of back then. It is artfully filmed with moments of surealism, but generally realistic and to the point. It's not a movie for everyone, although I'd recommend it to everyone as a way to broaden their views on the world we live in because it is the REAL world we live in. The emotions are REAL and for someone who lived through the 90's, it hits a visual chord. It's a movie that makes you wonder perhaps even think, ""Did I know that person?"" and then NOT really KNOW them at all. Hmmmmm???",1399161600,,823,4.282051282051282

The actors and actresses are easy on the eyes There are some artistic things sprinkled throughout the movie.  For example, there's a scene where the characters are at a restaurant, and their shirts match different walls.  The storyline is good.  It has some twists in it.  It's sad because you know that Lawrence and his girlfriend are soul mates, but the sex change (his real identity all along) is causing so much emotional distress.

It's funny because all throughout the movie, Lawrence's girlfriend's sister doesn't like him because he's a tranny, but she looks like a transsexual male who turned into a woman.",1391385600,,862,4.8561643835616435

8600955,5,B00E4GT66A,"For some reason I put this film aside and then totally forgot about it. Last night, not knowing what to watch, I picked it up unaware of the treat ahead of me. Because I'd washed it out of my head I had no preconceptions and had no idea what the film would be about, even forgetting the director had done Heartbeats (which I will soon re-watch because of this).

It's a fantastic film directed with pure, artistic freedom; very individual and personable. Following the theme of the film, elsewhere described, you watch the two characters over a ten-year period as they live with the decisions they make and how those decisions affect their lives. The length of the film is critical to this - you get the feeling that ordinary life is worthy of this film length, and yes, I agree, it is worthy. It gives their lives an epic feel and you get a deeper appreciation of the characters.

The film questions whether you should be true to your self and how to be true to your self, that you can still be strong and be there for others who (oh well . . .) may disagree with your choices. Laurence's own mother is quite a hardened character, frustrated with caring for her TV-watching husband, her repressed role plays a good counter point to Laurence.

There comes a point where we need to decide that people should be accepted for what they are, rather than shaping 'misfits' into the narrow role of what we think they should be. Difference shouldn't be regarded with so much fear / hate in society. Example: there is a scene in the film where Laurence is being confronted by a panel of 'authorities', teachers, the Head . . . some of whom are his friends - he is being fired because of being a transexual (a mental illness in the US as cited in some tome) (are they implying that people with mental illnesses don't teach?) (clearly there is a hierarchy of mental illnesses, some worse than others, or maybe some are more visible than others, we should make more effort to conceal our ills).

After a bit of a grandiose speech Laurence has to leave his job because this small group of people has decided him unworthy. This kind of decision happens and shapes the world, where only a certain type of person is fit to teach. Surely it is better to have a wide spectrum of people to teach from a wide spectrum of experiences, to provoke ideas, some of which may not be my / your way, but yes, there is no fear in considering these ideas. Then the students can decide for themselves what to accept, and also know what possibilities there are. Change cannot happen without a bit of stress, the students may have taken a while to get used to the idea, but perhaps they could have resolved the issues themselves, no surely not, dumb students, we need to lecture them.

Thought provoking aside, it's a warm film, showing the central couples undenied love as being strong throughout the film, but not quite strong enough (how can you continually fight off the world?), indeed society's outward reaction is very often the central part of Fred's inability to accept. The soundtrack is great, one dance scene in a kind of ballroom reminded me of, I think, a vodka commercial (?). And there are some beautiful scenes of weather / the elements that punctuate the film.

The aspect ratio prevents distraction from the intimacy of the faces of a wider view that includes background -- here, the faces literally and figuratively tell the story.  When the camera does pull back, its viewing angles seem to turn waves of emotion into refined and conscious points of view.  Music of Beethoven and Prokofieff highlight the score.
