Any of the Holly Hobbie movies are great in my opinion, and yeah im fairly sure we have them all :)",1260835200,,268,4.2745098039215685
2699881,5,B000L43PEI,I love this one  Holly Hobbie is so good in this one and I will give this one five.,1214438400,,83,3.3684210526315788
2699882,4,B000L43PEI,"Overall my family loves the Holly Hobbie DVD's and I would give them 5 stars.  I appreciate the solid family values and the examples of kids using their time to unselfishly help and bless others.  I also love that in the Christmas DVD there is whole-hearted emphasis on celebrating the birth of Jesus.  My 4 year-old daughter especially loves to sing along with the songs and even my 6 1/2 year-old son loves to watch along.  I like the fact that even though they are very girly overall, the brothers are included in the stories which makes it fun for my son to watch.  In this DVD however, there is a scene where Holly tries to hypnotize her friend to help her not be afraid of the dark anymore.  While I love the wholesome, family oriented nature of these stories this scene is not only unnecessary, but inappropriate considering the young target age.  My kids haven't asked any questions and seem to skim right past this scene, but it is disappointing to me that it's in there at all.  We'll keep watching the others but I'll probably put this one away.",1199664000,6,1056,4.492146596858639
2699883,5,B000L43PEI,Great movie for kids.  My three year old loves them.  Teaches a moral lesson.,1192752000,,77,4.428571428571429
2699884,4,B000L43PEI,"I have two little girls, one is three and the other is two. I copied this movie from tv onto a DVD for them, and they love it! Some of the ""little"" things about the story I have to clarify for them as these were made for slightly older girls, but it's all good. Some of the little things include: 1) One of the first scenes with Holly running away from her mom and chasing her dog into the street. 2) The way that she talks to her friends.

 I don't think this would be a problem with older girls, as they should already know these things. All in all it is a very entertaining plot and girls love it.",1179100800,2,600,3.9916666666666667
2699885,5,B000L43PEI,"Another super video with Holly Hobbie and her friends.  I love the relationship of love that is exhibited between the family members.  They are realistic, with the siblings not always getting along.  Yet, they work out their problems.  I liked way the movie showed that even having a good plan that is meant to help can go wrong, and we need to admit when we have made a mistake.  It's okay to ask for help.  Also, they show a family that forgives each other and tries to learn from mistakes.",1178409600,,492,4.411111111111111
2699886,5,B000L43PEI,"JUST WONDERFUL,MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS SERIES.  THE SECRET ADVENTURE WAS A PERFECT ADDITION TO OUR HOLLY HOBBIE SET.  SHE HAS WATCHED THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  I AM THRILLED THEY REVIVED HOLLY HOBBIE.  SUCH A WELCOMED CHANGE. SO POSITIVE AND SUCH A SMART SERIES FOR YOUNG GIRLS.  STRESSES FAMILY VALUES,THE IMPORTANCE OF FRIENDSHIPS, AND DOING THE RIGHT THING.  OF COURSE, ALONG WITH HAVING A LITTLE FUN ALONG THE WAY.  THANK YOU.",1174176000,6,430,4.971830985915493
2699887,3,B000L43PEI,"I was so excited to purchase this DVD for my girls, ages 6 & 8, who loved Christmas Wishes.  We sat down to watch it this evening and were a little disappointed.  Most of the movie is great.  However, there is a scene where Holly tries to hypnotize Carrie so she will no longer be scared of the dark.  What bothered me is that the hypnotizing actually worked - even though it was for the wrong friend.  Amy was hypnotized and is now afraid of the dark, while it did nothing for Carrie. I was just disappointed that a scene like that had to be in the movie at all.  I certainly don't want my girls attempting anything like that.  I am thankful that I watched it with my kids and was able to talk with them about how hypnotizing or trying to hypnotize people is not something they should be doing.",1173657600,17,795,4.190789473684211

8160111,5,B000L43PEI,"My almost eight-year-old daughter adores the Holly Hobbie series. She has only ever watched the new ones given her age but I have found them for the most part (with some exceptions) to be well-written. These Hollie Hobbie episodes promote cooperation, the spirit of friendship and community, and the value of hard work, all desirable qualities and traits our young can definitely benefit from. I also think Holly and her friends who form the Hey Girls Club are much better role models than some of the current animated characters such as Monster High characters, the Bratz dolls, etc.

In ""Secret Adventures"", Holly and her friends help Holly's mom and Aunt Jesse collect sap for the family's popular maple syrup recipe. When there is an accident, the girls are afraid to tell the truth and conceal it, but end up in more trouble. I think this episode is excellent for explaining to young children about secrets and how they should not keep anything important from the responsible adults in their lives.",1357430400,,1003,4.9
