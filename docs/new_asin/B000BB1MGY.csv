8084230,5,B000BB1MGY,"Hoagy Carmichael did not write the song ""Thanks for the Memory.""  That song was written by Ralph Rainger (1901-1942) and Leo Robin (1900-1984) and was introduced in the film ""The Big Broadcast of 1938"" by Bob Hope (in his film debut) and Shirley Ross.  Bob Hope used it as a theme song throughout his career. It won the Academy Award as best song.

Awf'ly glad I met you, cheerio, and toodle-oo...

Hoagy did write ""Two Sleepy People"" for a film called ""Thanks for the Memory.""  But even that film did not include the song ""Thanks for the Memory.""
