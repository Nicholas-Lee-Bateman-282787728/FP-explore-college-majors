6472237,5,B00L5YJLN2,"The movei tells the true story of Kasztners assassination. It is not just as a documentary, it is a series of interviews with the killer, the daughter, and the Kasztner family. It includes people involved on the legal proceedings afterwards, and people that were saved by Kasztners famous train to Switzerland during WWII. As a daughter of one of his survivors, the stories in the movie coincide with what my father used to tell. Worth every minute of it; Gaylen Ross is a great director, well deserving of all the film festival accolades and prizes.",1405900800,2,550,4.8
6472238,5,B00L5YJLN2,"I saw Killing Kasztner when it came out in theaters and was hoping it would make it to a DVD so I could give it to my kids. It reaffirms that even just one person can make a huge difference in the lives of thousands! Engaging and informative, this film is not to be missed! Looking forward to all of the special features as well.",1404259200,7,329,4.076923076923077
6472239,5,B00L5YJLN2,"Anyone interested in fine film, in Holocaust history, and the ways one man can save thousands of others from certain death must buy the updated version of film maker Gaylen Ross'sd masterpiece on the tragic killing of Reszo Katzner.",1404086400,6,232,4.9743589743589745
6472240,5,B00L5YJLN2,"The truth hurts. And this film contains as much truth as can be found about why the man who rescued my mother and approximately 20,000 Jews was shot to death in front of his home in Tel Aviv. Prof. Yehuda Bauer, who was the lead historian for Yad Vashem said that Reszo Kasztner, a Zionist leader in Budapest, and the Vaada, the Jewish Rescue Committee, with their idea of Goods and Trucks for Blood,saved more Jews than anyone near war's end. When he got to Israel in the early 50s, he was libeled and slandered, while the government he was working for filed the suit against a defendant in court, allowed him to be railroaded, and  left him to swing in the wind. And then he was murdered. This film goes into the mind of the murderer, who explains how and why what happened happened, and in the new material in this 2-disc edition, we learn how youth can be turned into killers for a cause they don't fully understand and how the forces of power can be totally corrupted. The film is riveting, especially in the scenes bet. the murderer and Kasztner's family members. It also makes it crystal clear that Kasztner was a bona fide hero. I highly recommend this film be seen by all descendants of Kasztner survivors and by all those descendants of those who slandered and libeled him for more than 70 years.",1404000000,10,1306,4.487394957983193
6472241,5,B00L5YJLN2,"KILLING KASZTNER -- finally available on DVD! -- is based on events in the 40s & 50s, but addresses two urgent issues of vital significance in our own era. The first is the paradox of negotiationhow do we know if someone crosses the line from negotiation to appeasement? Is this just a debate for historians after the fact? Can someone acting in the role of a negotiator, ever be considered heroic, or a role model for others? The second is the scourge of terrorism. The film is called KILLING KASZTNER, and the man who pulled the trigger was Zeev Eckstein. In KILLING KASZTNER, Eckstein, now in his 70s, reflects on his actions as a young man of 24. Here is a case study of what happens when bitterness, ideology, and fanaticism are in the air.

KILLING KASZTNER is a Highly Recommended/Must See Film!",1403654400,6,802,4.608391608391608
6472242,5,B00L5YJLN2,"After all the spiders who created the humongous web vie for their piece of flesh caught in the netting, it becomes apparent that not all of them will become satiated---so they start eating each other----all Kasztner received for his heroic undertaking was being eaten by other spiders.",1510790400,,285,5.085106382978723
6472243,2,B00L5YJLN2,"If you want to get a glimpse into the Jewish culture in Israel that portrays an assassin, ungrateful survivors of WWII who had no regard for a fellow Jew, by all means, watch this film. There is a very wealthy woman whose money was the only reason that she survived yet gives no credit to a man who organized the escape, and the bitterness and hatred that these people have towards the survivors and those who died in the Holocaust, then you have a home run. It shows the vindictive, callous side of a culture that I had never seen before. Ugly people who are lucky to be alive.",1510790400,,578,4.3119266055045875
6472244,4,B00L5YJLN2,"Very important historical event in Israel is treated with sensitivity and intelligence. The personal pain of the Kaszner family is well captured, and very moving in this film. The fact that the Mapai and the Right Wing parties ruined the reputation and killed a man for their own political posturing and power grabs could have been explained more thoroughly, as could Israel's ambivalent and truly neglectful response to Holocaust survivors. Still an excellent Doc.",1510444800,2,465,5.297297297297297

6472254,5,B00L5YJLN2,"Gaylen Ross is simply impressive as a film-maker. I first saw the documentary at a film festival in Seattle and wanted another look in the midst of all the current troubles in Israel and here, because she focused on the issue of negotiation under life and death circumstances. Kasztner negotiated for the lives of Hungarian Jews and got them out of Hungary to Switzerland. After the war he moved to Israel and there he was killed by a man who believed he had done the wrong thing. The film is rich with interviews with relatives, friends, the murderer, quite complex and compelling. What probably disturbed me the most about the history she brought to light was how the survivors of Kasztner's train rescue were not honored by the Israelis (though this has since been corrected at various official places). Ross puts the question out there: do we ever have honorable reason to negotiate with killers for the lives of others? Even if your instinct is to say no, this film will make you think. It is well worth purchasing and seeing.",1417910400,,1031,4.701657458563536
6472255,5,B00L5YJLN2,"I saw Kastzner at a Jewish film festival. I had not heard of him before, nor had most of the other people in the audience. So, to start out, we all learned something. And then we heard a very complicates story. The film was well put together, and it raised serious questions about right and wrong and about judgment. There is not normally much gray area in talking about Nazis. It is immediately clear who the bad guys are. But is it evil to work with evil people to accomplish noble ends? And who has the right to be judge and jury for another?",1417910400,2,545,4.25

6472257,5,B00L5YJLN2,"Such an important film. This film is a serious addition to the canon on the Holocaust. Thought provoking, fair, deep-delving and dramatic.

6472261,5,B00L5YJLN2,"This documentary expertly and poignantly tells the tale of Hungarian Jewish figure who was a rescuer and controversial figure of The Holocaust era too long ignored by the public. The film is well worth purchasing as part of your historic collection. With interviews from family, from those he rescued and with those who sought his demise, this doc is a well researched and moving story that must be seen. The interviews with the self proclaimed assassin and his tense and moving meeting with members of the Kasztner family are amazing. Buy it. Share it with history teachers and scholars.

8663977,5,B00L5YJLN2,Wow what a film! I have studied WW2 for over 50 years and had never heard this story before. Gaylen Ross is teased and pulled info that was so powerful and human. History is never what it seems and this wonderful film proves that in spades. I have to admit it brought tears to my eyes many times.,1528070400,2,296,4.120689655172414
8663978,5,B00L5YJLN2,"This film documents a complicated and complex issue. I understand less about post Holocaust survival than I did before. I need to watch this film several more times just to grapple with the top layers.

The intensity is palpable when you watch the interaction of the dead man's family and his assassin.",1518998400,2,302,4.8076923076923075
8663979,4,B00L5YJLN2,"I liked this documentary, and it was nice to see Tommy Lapid in it and learn a few interesting tidbits about his friendship with Kasztner. I'm giving it four stars because I thought the film was a bit too long, and I found that too much time was dedicated Eckstein, Kasztner's killer.  I also think the film lacked the necessary background about the situation of Jews in Hungary in March 1944 and on. But overall a good documentary for those who are interested in the Kasztner affair.",1515542400,,484,4.563218390804598
8663980,5,B00L5YJLN2,"From one of the most brilliant independent film makers, a hauntingly stunning film, a film which poses a vital historical hypothesis: was the killing of Kasztner warranted, and was the greatness of his work saving Jews in Hungary, to be challenged by his alleged behind the scenes arrangement with the Nazis. Ross leaves much of the answer up to the viewer, and certainly makes his own assassination as fascinating as his otherwise seemingly courageous work years before. A must see, and an historical treasure.",1512259200,,511,5.095238095238095

8663984,5,B00L5YJLN2,"Very well made.  Fascinating technique of blending history with live interviews of today. No one can understand the pain of survivors guilt -- the movie did well to provide a broad picture of a variety of opinions and emotions.  That said, this documentary suffers from incompleteness, resulting in bias, due to totally overlooking an important action by Kasztner -- his role in the deliberate suppression of the Vrba-Wetzler report of April 1944, prior to Kasztner's negotiations with Eichmann, prior to the 1944 Hungarian Jew deportations to Auschwitz (May 15 - July 9 -- 145 trains with about 450,000 Hungarian Jews), and prior to the Kasztner train of June 30, 1944.  A total of about 600,000 Hungarian Jews died in the Holocaust in 1944-1945.  The question is, if they had had knowledge of the truth of the death camps, might they have made other choices instead of quietly complying?  And even if they would have made the same choices, should they have had all the information anyway that would affect that choice?  The disproportionate number of friends and family on the Kastner trains, the suppression of the facts about Auschwitz, and the intercessions on the behalf of the Nazis at Nuremberg are troubling.  It is heroic to talk to Eichmann personally, and save 1684.  It is not heroic to withhold information that was intended by Vrba and Wetzler to be dessiminated, that impacted the lives of 800,000 and the deaths of 600,000.  Is it traitorous?  Is it self-serving?  It is impossible to adjudicate what is moral in such an immoral time.  However, that said, this movie did a disservice to this highly complex situation by ignoring this major action by Kasztner.  Despite this, it is a compelling and informative documentary, very well made, not as hard to view as many other Holocaust movies, and a fascinating insight into early Israel history.",1512172800,4,1860,4.961290322580645
