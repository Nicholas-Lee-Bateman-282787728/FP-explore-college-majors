8295393,5,B001DXUHEM,"I'm a huge fan of Russian culture and history. At first this set seemed juvenile to me but after watching much of it I can't stop. Perhaps the sound and visual effects could be called distracting but sometimes they are quite humorous as intended. For one who does not speak Russian fluently I find reading the closed captions challenging because the texts sometimes go by very quickly. Then again, when one owns such a set the joy comes in revisiting the same program many times. Always something new and un-noticed in earlier viewing becomes clear.

I very much encourage people who want to learn about the history of the Russian Empire from the time of Peter the Great through the last Tsar to purchase this set.",1250726400,2,714,4.666666666666667
