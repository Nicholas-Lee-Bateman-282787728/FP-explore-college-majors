7920336,5,B00004DS1R,"I just returned from a visit with my two grandchildren (ages 4 and 15 months) and the highlight of my trip was having them ""teach"" me to sing along with the songs on this wonderful tape. At first I thought their enthusiasm for this video came from the fact that it was a present from grandpa, but that was definitely not the case. My daughter called several days after I returned home from my visit and told me that it has now become the most often-played video in their collection. And, I admit, it was fun for me to hear songs I hadn't heard since my own children were small ... brought back many memories. I was also impressed by the high production quality of this tape ... first class all the way. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1038182400,,722,4.355555555555555
7920337,5,B00004DS1R,"""Mommy Songs"" is a wonderful compliation of all the songs you remember singing as a child but had trouble remembering how they went now that you've grown up.  Now my children are having a blast singing ""Three little monkeys jumping on the bed,"" and all the others, joining in on all the hand movements and actions that go with them.  More than simply proving the songs themselves, this video's simple one-on-one presentation connects directly with the children just as with their own parents -- it is not dressed up in bright colors or fast action or giant sponge rubber animals.  For parents (Daddies as well as Mommies), it a training video, helping you to recall all the gestures and actions so you can sing the songs with your children at bedtime, in the car, etc.
This is a required video!",1030060800,,794,4.6571428571428575
7920338,5,B00004DS1R,Our 1 year old daughter loves this video!  When we put it on she gets very excited (claps and dances)!  It has lots of songs we kenw and a few new ones.,964569600,,152,3.71875
7920339,5,B00004DS1R,My sixteen month old daughter had no interest in videos or television. When I introduced her to  Mommy Songs I was amazed that it stopped her in her tracks. She watched Beth Klarreich Corwin intently. When she heard a  song she knew she started to dance! My six and four year old boys loved  singing along to some of their old favorites as well. I think this video is  so appealing because of Ms. Corwin's natural approach to singing and  storytelling. This is a video that invites movement and participation which  can be enjoyed on many levels.,948326400,5,546,4.577319587628866
