If you wonder at the ""whys"" of todays headline events, this documentary makes it all quite understandable. The quality of the filmed lecture is only average, but the message is high impact. The lecture takes just over 2 hours, but the analysis is prfoundly critical. The lecture is based on the book by the same title and author, which is out of print and has become nearly impossible to find at any price.

In a world where money talks, he outlines how powerful and influential financial institutions have colluded to impose centrally controlled global banking. The availability of money and credit to governments, industries, and populations, is controlled by powerful privately-run ""Central Banks."" These enormous European banks have spread their financial tentacles into other nations' banking systems to exert control of wealth, industry, legislation, media, education, and ultimately personal freedoms. Money supplies and financial crises can be created at will. The object is the infliction of large national debts. The US Federal Reserve is such a bank, with European roots that persist today. The author provides a concise history of the European and US banking systems back to pre-Revolutionary times. From 1863 to 1910, the average American understood the need to keep our banks domestic (a National Bank), and not European (a ""Central Bank"").

America's clash between the domestic ""National Bank"" of Jefferson and Jackson, and the private foreign-influenced ""Central Bank"" embodied by the mis-named Federal Reserve, was lost in 1913 when Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act (creating the central bank) and the Internal Revenue Act (creating the IRS). These two acts would forever allow the government to borrow more money than it collected, and saddled the American taxpayer with the obligation to pay this Public Debt. After he left office, Wilson lamented that he regretted having destroyed the American financial system.  Such a scenario clarifies the enormous bailouts and Stimulus packages seen today.

 Europe's Central Banks have financed both sides of every major global war since 1789. Since war generates incalculable debt upon the national populations, it is one of the swiftest vehicles to unbridled public borrowing and spending. More insidiously, the video reveals that even the War on Drugs is such a battle. National Borders and sovereignties become progressively diluted and fuzzy in such a world. Eventually, corporations and governments fall into the hands of fewer and fewer powerful financial puppeteers. The decisions made in the political arena will then always reflect the interests of the controllers. Gobal Bankers pride themselves in that they pay tax to no government. (Answering the doubt about why US cabinet members of today have have not paid their IRS bills).

The influence has extended into every vein of financial life-blood: Insurance, Real Estate, Mortgage lending, Investment Banking, Venture Capital, Capital development, etc. American Industry itself is rifled with the names of these uberlords: JP Morgan, Henry Ford, Guggenheim, Warburg, and many others. It would be one thing if this panorama were mere conjecture, but the dot-connections are too compelling to be ignored.

If you are ready for a real eye-opener about money, politics, and scandal, this videotape documentary will alter all your perceptions and preconceptions.",1249776000,2,3514,5.460405156537753
