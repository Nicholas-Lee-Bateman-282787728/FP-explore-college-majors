7626443,5,B01BCNJ856,"A beautiful and amazing film showing the life of an extraordinary woman who was clearly very talented as an artist, but left the potential to become famous to become unknown for Christ. As a 40 year missionary not much was known about her until recently, thanks primarily to the efforts of one woman. It is a beautiful gift from God that he moved Miriam Rockness to tell us of her faithfulness to Christ, and the people she served in His name.",1458172800,5,443,4.481481481481482
7626444,5,B01BCNJ856,"Beautifully done. The film is a documentary, covering two stories: the life of Lilias Trotter (voiced by Michelle Dockery), and how one woman with a passion rescued her memory from obscurity.

Lilias kept journals all her life, filling them with sketches and paintings, many of which appear in the film. Much of the dialog comes from these journals and from letters between Lilias and her mentor (and would-be suitor?), John Ruskin (voiced by John Rhys-Davies). Lilias's paintings are deceptively simple, perfect little gems, and her text that accompanies them is deeply profound and ultimately uplifting.

The story told here is ultimately of one woman's great stength through her humility, faith, and an unquenchable love for God in the ""least"" of His creatures. One of the best things I've seen in a long time.",1457913600,9,813,5.105263157894737
7626445,3,B01BCNJ856,"I really wanted to rate this higher
Because Lillias had such a wonderful story - sorry I was not very interested in how it was researched
I think less commentary and more reading from her own words. Sometimes it's better to let the viewer draw their own conclusions than to repeat and repeat what you want us to know.
Music:excellent
Photography:excellent
Her art work: breathtaking
but they only repeated about 27 times that she could have married and been a famous artist. At first it's boring, then it's just annoying. Get a cup of code or tea to watch this slow paced documentary. There are gems in here, so I recommend watching it,but it needs some serious editing",1457481600,3,669,4.677966101694915
7626446,5,B01BCNJ856,When I first learned about this documentary I was immediately intrigued. It did not disappoint. I have seen it five times now and every time I watch it tears fill my eyes cry and I am moved in a profound way. Lilias Trotter lived a beautiful and inspiring life and Many Beautiful Things is equally as beautiful and inspiring. I highly reccomend this film!,1457395200,7,355,4.5625
7626447,5,B01BCNJ856,"Lilias Trotter is the kind of bold and inspiring woman that wipes away any misconceptions about women in the 19th century. Wow! She was a stellar visual artist and a compassionate woman who reached out to help women oppressed by poverty, prostitution, and cultural norms that devalued women. She was definitely ahead of her time. And this film brings her to life! The filmmaker made a gorgeous film -- it really does justice to Lilias's art. Lovely filming, inspiring music, an intriguing storyline -- and Lady Mary Crawley from Downton Abbey to be the voice of Lilias! Just perfect! Highly recommended.",1457395200,10,603,4.98019801980198

7626449,5,B01BCNJ856,"Beautiful cinematography combines with the inspiring story of the life of Lilias Trotter who rejected society's norms for women--she chose to give up a promising career as an artist in order to answer God's call on her life to serve others in North Africa.  Her unfailing love for people in need was her motivation to serve.  More than a fascinating documentary, the film is an ""experience"" in and of itself--the story, the visuals, art and music combined in a powerful way to bring me to a place of examining my own willingness to do what is right and good even when it is uncomfortable and difficult.",1457308800,9,602,4.669811320754717

7626486,5,B01BCNJ856,"Years ago, I had read a powerful book which helped me through a difficult time with my chronic illness; it was called ""A Path Through Suffering"" (Elisabeth Elliot), themed on Lilias Trotter's writing.  It focused on surrendering to the Lord and delighting in Him.  I loved those quotes.  Fast-forward many years, and a few weeks ago I come across a book about Lilias Trotter.  ""Hey, I've heard of her.  Oh, yes, those mesmerizing quotes I'd read.""  So, I bought ""A Passion for the Impossible: the Life of Lilias Trotter"" and am still reading it. I am deeply touched in my soul by this 19th-century woman's deep desire to serve others for the Lord...even though it meant obscurity rather than artistic fame.  I also bought a book by Lilias Trotter, because I love how she weaved via writing and painting her observations of the natural world with her observations of spiritual life.  Then, yesterday I discovered this documentary, which is quite well done and captures the depth of the call on Lilias Trotter's heart which was a desire God put in her soul.  I want to be like her...faithful to my true calling from the Lord.",1468886400,18,1123,4.717948717948718

7626488,5,B01BCNJ856,"We first saw this movie when it was screened at our church. It was beautifully done and completely inspiring, giving us a glimpse of a rare spirit- an extraordinarily gifted woman who worked hard perfecting her artistic talents under the tutelage of the renowned John Ruskin, but found an even greater joy in leaving behind the highest social and artistic circles of Victorian England for the rugged life of a female missionary to Muslim North Africa in the late 1800s. The message of Christian love through service shines through her story, and the historic details of nineteenth century art and culture will appeal to lovers of the Pre-Raphaelite and Arts & Crafts movements as well as all things Victorian. From a personal standpoint, I was awed by the level of self-sacrifice exhibited by Trotter, and, in light of her example, found myself examining my own life and goals for lasting value.

I don't remember where I first heard of the documentary but I promptly went to the site manybeautifulthings.com and watched the trailer. I knew I had to see this film but sadly the screening closest to me was already sold out. So in the mean time I've perused the site, visited the biographers blog and shared many of the deep, edifying quotes with my other Sisters In Christ. I purchased the facsimile edition of Parables of The Cross for a friend as a gift, and must admit selfishly wanted to flip through it before mailing it off :) I can't decide which book about Lilias I'll buy first! I want them all. I hope to buy the picture book for my daughter to tuck away for her as she grows older. I hope I can encourage any mother who has laid aside her gifts that the world might have deemed worthy of praise in order to raise her children under the calling of God, to please invest a few dollars to watch this documentary through Amazon Video. You will undoubtedly find many inspiring images and ideas to meditate upon when the days are hard, you feel spent and as if you have nothing left to give. Also, as someone who struggles with poor health, I felt an immediate kinship with Lilias. This is this amazing thing about a true Christian testimony: it lives on for years and years to bless an encourage others. What a gift Mrs. Rockness has given to Christian women who are daily living out their individual callings and doing their work as unto the Lord!",1462579200,12,1625,4.438127090301004

Kind of amazing too if you think of a woman Christian missionary going into Arab territory and culture in the Victorian early 1900s. She did not get beheaded or assaulted, but lived in peace with her Arab neighbors. Pretty nice story overall of JESUS' guidance to love thy neighbor as thyself. Oh, and Lillias Trotter also did gorgeous water colors too of her missionary time in North Africa. Oh, and Michele Dockery's voice of Lillias Trotter is perfect and lovely as well!",1461888000,,528,4.877777777777778

7626532,5,B01BCNJ856,"Beautifully paced filmmaking, carries the viewer into a different time and place, exquisite artwork of animated montages, carefully crafted music adds to the immersive quality of the film. One reviewer called it ""slow and repetitive."" I suggest that the film maker was deliberate in their pacing and recurring thematic elements. I can see where some would want faster pacing, but for me the film was meditative and even mystical and achieved a sense of cultural and period immersion. I didn't feel like I was being entertained, but rather like I was with Lilias on her journey, feeling her tensions, her struggles, her light and transcendent bliss. Kudos to Kurosawa, Waters, and the entire filmmaking crew. A brilliant effort.",1461542400,10,727,5.169491525423729

7626540,5,B01BCNJ856,"Beautifully filmed, the life and art of Lilias Trotter is perfectly voiced by the ever elegant Michelle Dockery. It is hard to convey the serenity and the exquisiteness of her work except to say it truly touches the soul in the most gentle of ways.  How fitting was her painting of dandelions. Like the breath that transports its seeds onto their whistful journey is the desire you have to go outside and partake in the nature Lilias painted and adored. To see like that is truly a blessing to aspire to. Kudos to Miriam Rockness for her decades of dedication to bring her story to us.",1460592000,5,585,4.518867924528302

7626543,5,B01BCNJ856,"LOVE THIS FILM. It is a deep, thought-provoking encounter into a world of a rather unknown woman from the 19th century. Her name is Lilias Trotter and her life faith, life and art are beautiful to behold. The film does an excellent job diving into the story of this woman through the eyes of a lay historian, through Lilias' journals, and through Lilias' paintings. It is short but powerful and will leave you with days and days of pondering...asking life's biggest questions---Why am I here? What am I to do with the gifts that I have? What is God asking me to do to be faithful? How can I be loved by God and love Him and others in a more genuine way? Would recommend to anyone who desires to be encourage and challenged in their life and in their pursuit of God.",1460505600,10,765,4.356643356643357

Lilias was an exceptionally wise, giving, and talented woman, who was unafraid to strike out upon unknown waters, in order to serve God.",1460073600,3,338,4.947368421052632

7626549,3,B01BCNJ856,"I ordered this immediately, as I have long been a Lilias Trotter fan.  Her books are inspiring and beautiful!  Her love of the Lord is strong and deep.  While I loved the beauty of this film, I was disappointed that so much of the film was about those who researched her life!  There is so much that could have been focused on about Lilias and her 40 years in a harsh land sharing the gospel in ways that would fit in and have an impact in that culture.  I came away wanting so much more about her and much less about her researchers. Lilias' own words are as beautiful and inspiring as her art.  I would encourage anyone who wants to know more to read her books ""Parables of The Christ-Life"" and ""Parables of the Cross.""",1458259200,10,721,4.264705882352941
8749803,4,B01BCNJ856,"Inspiring, especially her artwork and her character, but a bit plodding, redundant, and anti-climactic in the telling. It was interesting to learn how archives were collated to piece together the would-be lost chapters of her life, and the narration, her works, and the music were lovely. The story will mainly appeal to those of an evangelical Christian bent. I wouldn't have been sorry if I'd only rented it.",1531785600,,410,5.044117647058823
8749804,3,B01BCNJ856,"Lilias Trotter has been one of my guiding lights, so of course I was dying to see this video.  However, I found it too immersed in her relationship with John Ruskin.  In fact, a good bit of the video is as much about him as about her.  If, like me, you have read Lilias' books and biographies, you will not find anything new in this video, and you might miss, as I did, more stories about Lilias' ministry and personal struggles, apart from the decision involving Ruskin and her art.  Granted, that was a turning point, but it was also very early on, and many wonderful stories followed which have made her commitment to Jesus such an inspiration.",1530835200,,647,4.4576271186440675

I imagine almost no one has, and certainly I had not, except for Michelle Dockery's providing this lovely DVD about an English woman leaving privilege and promise as one of Europe's most renown painters, in order to serve women in Algiers in the late 1800's. Trotter's extant art work beautifully illustrates the biography.",1522540800,,357,5.067796610169491

8749811,5,B01BCNJ856,"This is a response to any who balk at the re-use of images to illustrate this beautiful documentary.  Llilias' art and life rested on the principle of beauty in simplicity, obscurity, and giving life away, of ""seeing"".  If one considers her art (as well as her life), you will see vast elusive scapes with very ordinary, yet striking and unique perspectives, focusing on small things amidst the grand scheme of their surroundings.  Repetition in seeds, flowers, clouds, stone, grass....nothing escaped her notice.  In order to see, one needed to rest the mind of too much clutter.  I believe that the filmmakers rendered this concept beautifully by holding us and making us ""see"" these re-used images and film clips.  We are then focused more on the narration and the deeper meanings of what we are hearing and seeing.  The creators sensitively narrated this story of a once-in-a-lifetime servant of God very fittingly.  Indeed, it must have cut costs to reuse photographs and enactment clips, but there is no loss of vibrant color and movement.  The narration, along with the amazing animations of her crisply rendered artwork and the weight of her life's story, completely hold the attention of the viewer.  For so long, Llilias' artwork was kept from our view due to the tremendous cost of truly recreating the vivid color and crispness of detail in publication.  Here in this film, the viewer is treated to a full portfolio her art in a way that the giftbooks cannot quite bring across as well (though I recommend those highly!).

Of course, there are many other elements that will say whether or not the topic of this film will hold one's attention; but this film is a visual wonder, a delightful pause for all of us to consider the importance of not only her own life poured out for so many, but of our own as well.",1520121600,,1821,4.764331210191083
