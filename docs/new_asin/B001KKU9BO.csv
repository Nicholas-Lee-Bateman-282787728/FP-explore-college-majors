8315304,3,B001KKU9BO,"The ""Tagged Classic"" series are old WWE PPV events that they package together & release as a set together for those who didn't catch them back when they originally were released. And to answer the big question surrounding every release of a PPV since July of last year is that Chris Benoit has not been edited out of the events. These are just re-releases of the original PPV DVD events.

SmackDown's No Mercy:
Undertaker made it clear that he wanted to once again become the WWE Champion but he had to take the title off the man he has yet to be able to defeat in Brock Lensar in a Biker Chain Match where the person who grab the chain off the pole can use it anyway they wish with both men delivering the physical match that you saw in their series a year earlier but also saw Taker fight off so many other people who had a personal issue against as well. Kurt Angle faced off against John Cena in a battle of respect with Cena continuing to deliver quality wrestling matches that not only gained this reputation as one of the best matches of his career up to this point but also started to gain the support of the fans as well. The McMahon family once again exploded as WWE Chairman Vince faced off against SmackDown General Manager Stephanie in a ""I Quit"" match where Stephanie was also allowed to win by pinfall with the loser having to resign from their position in a match that wasn't much considering who's involved but more relevant for the backstage story involving this match as Vince promised Stephanie wouldn't have a scratch on her as her & Triple H were set to be married only days later. Other matches include United States Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Big Show, A.P.A. vs. Basham Brothers, Zach Gowen vs. Matt Hardy, Chris Benoit vs. A-Train, and Crusierweight Champion Tajiri vs. Rey Mysterio.

Survivor Series:
After two months of people trying to collect a $100,000 bounty along with being injured, Goldberg defended the World Championship against Triple H in a bout where he tried to do everything possible to defeat Goldberg from targeting the injured wrapped leg to the influence of Evolution to even his sledgehammer only for Goldberg to keep coming. Undertaker's 13th WWE anniversary saw him compete against Mr. McMahon in Buried Alive match that saw a violent beating from Taker to McMahon the first punch that busted him open to destroying his ankle with steel steps & knocking him out with a shovel only for someone from Taker's past being a difference maker. A traditional Survivor Series elimination match would turn out to be the most important match in Steve Austin's career that he never wrestled in where either his WWE career was over or he could be free to physically touch anyone he wants to without provocation as his team (Shawn Michaels, Rob Van Dam, Booker T, Dudley Boyz) against Eric Bischoff's Team (Chris Jericho, Christian, Randy Orton, Scott Steiner, Mark Henry) in a match that turned out to be bloody with Shawn Michaels fighting from behind while Randy Orton was looking to continue his legacy of being a ""Legend Killer."" The final encounter between Kane & Shane McMahon happened here in the first ever Ambulance Match in WWE history that was a physical affair with both men beating the hell out of each other with weapons & the ambulance itself taking the match not only in the ring but also out of the ring to the backstage packing lot. Other matches include another traditional Survivor Series match with Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, John Cena, Hardcore Holly, Bradshaw) vs. Team Lesnar (Brock Lesnar, Big Show, Matt Morgan, Nathan Jones, A-Train), Womens Champion Molly Holly vs. Lita, and WWE Tag Team Champions Basham Brothers vs. Los Guerreros.

In the end, No Mercy was a two match PPV that really isn't worth going out of your way to see while Survivor Series did it's job in ending & planting seeds for future storylines along with giving up an entertaining card from top to bottom so I would only recommend this set if you can't find a cheaper copy of Survivor Series.",1233878400,2,4037,4.691114245416079
8315305,2,B001KKU9BO,"Alright, so the WWE is once again releasing some older PPVs in the hopes of making a quick buck.  They've put out a few commendable pairs from the 2003 catalog, but I'm not falling for this one.  In short, both PPVs have two good matches, while the rest is poor.

*****NO MERCY 2003*****
---There are a few good matches on here, but nothing that you need to pay money for.  The opener features Rey Mysterio challenging Tajiri for the Cruiserweight Title, a match that is pretty exciting, but a tad short.  For the second year in a row, Brock Lesnar defended the WWE Championship against The Undertaker at a NO MERCY PPV.  The main event was a Biker Chain Match, and while not as brutal as their Hell-In-A-Cell Match, it's a still a decent match.  However, it's clear from the getgo that a screwjob finish was on the brink.  Perhaps the biggest highlight for most fans will be the grudge match between John Cena & Kurt Angle.  I still think their best match together was Cena's TV debut on SMACKDOWN, but this particular encounter is a solid one.  Other than that, the rest of the card ranges between ""Acceptable"" and ""Boring"".  You'll get to see future champions Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero in ""David/Goliath"" matches against A-Train and Big Show (respectively); both are watchable, but not very good.  The other semi-main event is the ""I Quit"" Match between Stephanie McMahon and Vince McMahon.  If it weren't for the McMahons revealing the true story behind the contest, it would be criticized even more than it already is.

All in all, NO MERCY 2003 isn't bad, but for completists only.

*****SURVIVOR SERIES 2003*****
---I already have a longer review of this event somewhere in My Profile, but I'll give a short recap.  Basically, the two Survivor Series Elimination Matches are very good, especially the RAW Match, which will go down as one of the PPV series' finest moments.  And...the buck stops there.  Kane & Shane McMahon followed up their heavily-praised Last Man Standing Match at UNFORGIVEN with a poorly-executed Ambulance Match.  There's a WWE Tag Titles Match between The Basham Brothers & challengers Los Guerreros, which is solid, but not a must-see contest.  The two main events are where this PPV falls very flat.  SMACKDOWN's main event pits Vince McMahon against The Undertaker in a Buried Alive Match; this was a bloody beatdown for Vince, but the finish was beyond predictable weeks before the PPV took place.  RAW's main event rematches Triple H against World Heavyweight champion Goldberg.  I kinda like the HHH/Goldberg UNFORGIVEN encounter, but this one forced HHH to carry his opponent even more than before.

SURVIVOR SERIES 2003 does have two PPV-quality matches, but that's it.

OVERALL
---NO MERCY 2003 is a good example of why brand-only PPVs weren't going to work.  And SURVIVOR SERIES has two great Elimination Matches, and the rest is flatout miserable.  There's some minor interest in this Tagged Classics combo because the SMACKDOWN storylines complement each other pretty well (i.e. the Taker/Vince rivalry, and witnessing Cena's babyface turn).  I always suggest going on YouTube to find good matches one poor 3-hour events.  But if that's not an option for you, then only buy this set at a very cheap price, like 5 dollars.",1229212800,,3398,5.116152450090744
