3511798,4,B001CEK0MG,"My daughter loves this show on the baby developmental channel.  The only issue that I have is that there is only 3 shows on the DVD.  I'm also not sure if they separate this show into seasons, but it would be nice as well.",1387238400,2,222,4.0227272727272725

3511801,2,B001CEK0MG,I purchased this DVD since my baby love this show and I really enjoy watching her smiling and doing funny moves.  What I did not expect is that the DVD only comes with TWO Chapters only.  I was totally dissapointed when it happened.  The reason why I purchased this it was because there was no video on this show online.,1370044800,11,320,4.3

3511803,5,B001CEK0MG,my son has loved everything baby first since he was about 4 months old.  This is a great video for road trips- i turn it on and he doesnt take his eyes off it! I wish the videos were a bit longer since its only about 35 min,1325030400,,223,3.6458333333333335
3511804,3,B001CEK0MG,It would be ranked higher if the DVD had more episodes on there.  I had really hoped for more than the 3 that are there.,1294099200,,120,3.8
3511805,5,B001CEK0MG,"Perfect! Just Perfect! Brings me a lot of peace!!! When my baby is full of energy, bored, noisy, whatever, when she is driving me crazy and I have a lot of things to do or just wanna rest a minute, all I have to do is play Baby's First TV DVD to her. We were travelling by car and she got very stressed after a while so we played the DVD and she were ok for the rest of the travel, it was a bless!",1286928000,,397,3.6823529411764704

3511819,5,B001CEK0MG,"Yes, it's disheartening that there are only 2 episodes on this DVD. (I'm not sure why some people say there are 3, maybe they got a different DVD than I did.)

HOWEVER, my 16 month old loves this show, for reasons that we don't understand. His favorite part is ""Once upon a time-time"". It's important to know which stories are being read, because that was the reason we bought the DVD (We literally fast forward through most of it). Luckily for us, his very favorite story was on the first episode. The stories in the DVD are:

The story about the little bird (Peter) who failed his flying test and risked being left behind for the winter. After the flying instructor and his mom flew away after the test, a little frog told him that if he gathered 150 leaves from the Magic Tree he would help him make magic leaf tea and upon drinking it the bird would be able to fly. I won't spoil the ending for you, but it is pretty amazing. (As far as Squeak stories go)

The second story is about a jerk seagull that laughs at everyone who falls or has any kind of misfortune. A dog and cat form a plan to teach him a lesson. (Again, no spoilers in this review!) Not as awesome as the first story, but much better then say, the story about the guy who owned a wheat mill on Windy Hill and one day the wind stop blowing. -No offense to wheat milling folks who live on windy hills.

All in all, a great buy, and if you're like me and the stories are important in making your decision, I hope I've helped. :)",1432857600,5,1495,4.198606271777003
