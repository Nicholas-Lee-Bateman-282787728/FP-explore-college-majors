8125899,2,B000FS6MMC,This series just seemed to be half though out. The story doesn't seem to flow from one episode to another. Bought it thinking it'd be similar to Red vs Blue but was very disappointed.,1378166400,,183,4.411764705882353
8125900,5,B000FS6MMC,"The Sims 2 is one of my favorite games. That is part of the reason I like this. It is a very creative series. I like all the characters, the plot, the different settings ect. This is definatly worth the money in my opinion. It also comes with some extras which is pretty cool. Overall, 5/5.",1321747200,3,290,4.196428571428571
8125901,3,B000FS6MMC,"My wife and I are huge Red vs. Blue fans.  I wanted to try out Rooster Teeth's ""other"" machinima franchise.  I have only watched about half an hour of this disc so far, but it is disappointing.  The cleverness and originality of Red vs. Blue is almost completely absent.  It does have a few funny moments, but on the whole is a dud.

I think the central problems are a lack of conflict and a lack of interesting characters.  RVB had a built-in conflict (there was a war going on, after all).  Conflict is central to plot, and The Strangerhood lacks much of a compelling conflict.  The central problem for the characters is that they don't know who or where they are and find their lives being controlled by a faceless voice and forces they cannot comprehend.  It is perhaps a metaphor for our real lives, but rates pretty high on the yawn meter.  The characters spend most of their time bickering and pursuing pointless pastimes instead of figuring out what's happened to them (another metaphor?).

The characters themselves are the other big problem.  Most of the characters in RVB were pretty complex.  We can just pigeonhole Caboose as an idiot, Grif as a slob, Simmons as a sycophant, etc. but there was a good deal more complexity than that in most of them.  Grif's character really showed some other interesting facets from time to time, especially when his sister showed up.  Church and his love/hate affair with Tex defied stereotypes, as did his relationship with the other Blood-Gultchers.  Even Caboose would surprise us on occassion, as when he revealed his hatred of babies (I don't think anybody saw that one coming).  The Strangerhood characters are very flat though.  They are all just two-dimensional stereotypes, and for many of the early episodes they didn't even have names.  Maybe that's the point, but again it doesn't make for an entertaining experience.

If you love machinima, or just Rooster Teeth, this can be worth a look, but I doubt you'll find yourself watching it over and over.",1303689600,,2010,4.771014492753623
8125902,2,B000FS6MMC,"Well... it starts intresting with people who don't know each other and suddenly wake up in the same neighborhood without remembering how they got there, but then it got to fictional, stupid, and not very funny. Being used, it didn't work in my laptop or in any of the good dvd players I have, only worked in the cheap one. As a huge Sims 2 fan it was very, very dissapointing!",1231027200,,376,4.309859154929577
8125903,5,B000FS6MMC,"It is a great purchase for people getting into the machinama section of videos. Using computer generated characters for the story this creates a wide new eye to the movie making industry. Rooster Teeth is one of the Best and funniest leading Machinama producers, but be careful because some of there creations(not this one so much) is not good for the youngsters to see under 14(estimate). But otherwise this Machinama uses the game ""The Sims 2"" for the videos. So funny is all I can say, a very smart purchase.",1224979200,,511,4.688888888888889
8125904,3,B000FS6MMC,"You don't know who you are.  You don't know where you are.  You just wake up one morning, sleeping next to a weird guy who thinks his name is Dart.  But his name tag says Wade.  Welcome to the Strangerhood.  An internet parody of television shows using Sims 2.  Lost, CSI, American Idol, all are targets of this wild ride of an internet show.  Including music videos and commentary.  The only problem is that, while there is some humor, the lack of a plot, which is part of the plot, means that after watching it you don't feel like you've gained something.  Like eating a four course meal and feeling hungry.
True the characters are funny but soon become kind of boring.  Maybe because they are, also, parodies.  Walking and talking jokes.
Get it used.  Otherwise you may wish to pass it by.",1221436800,2,792,4.461538461538462
