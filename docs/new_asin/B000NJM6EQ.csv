8178494,4,B000NJM6EQ,"I've seen a fair chunk of VCI's ""Forgotten Noir"" series thus far, and a couple of brief general comments are in order:  first, many of these films wouldn't really qualify as ""true"" noir to a lot of aficionados, and aren't recognized as such by most of the authorities on the subject; and second, most of them are a decent amount of fun, regardless of how ""noir"" they really are.  This release is no exception.

First up, FBI GIRL (1951, directed by William Berke)

This Lippert Pictures low-budget police procedural with noirish undertones is certainly one of the better films from this cheap studio that I've seen.  The paint-by-numbers story (by three credited writers) certainly isn't the reason - unscrupulous Governor Owen Grisby (Raymond Greenleaf) hires even more unscrupulous Blake (Raymond Burr) to try to get back fingerprints from the FBI that prove that Grisby is actually wanted murderer John Williams.  Their first attempt proves futile; though Blake has the ""FBI Girl"" murdered, for some reason she doesn't have the prints.  But the girl, Natalie Craig (Margia Dean) made a mistake while lifting the prints, and another FBI employee noticed something wrong, which leads to investigators Stedman and Donley (Cesar Romero and George Brent) getting involved, and eventually another fingerprint clerk, Shirley Wayne (Audrey Totter) serving as their mole.

It's all pretty predictable stuff, you know the bad guys are going to get it in the end and the FBI will come out triumphant, but what saves the film is some pretty nice nighttime photography by Jack Greenhalgh, decent set-ups and camera movement from director Berke, and a really impressive cast for such a low-budget production.  In addition to those named - and it should be noted that Romero and Brent are rather wasted in pretty dull ""just the facts ma'am"" cop roles"" - we have the incredibly gorgeous Joi (here spelled Joy) Lansing as one of Shirley's roommates and Tom Drake giving probably the best performance in the film as her ambitious boyfriend Carl, who is also connected to the governor though not aware of his secret.  Alexander Pope, who's an even larger man than Burr, does a nice turn as a henchman who takes a quite literal dive that keeps the FBI from finding out too much for a while, and Marie Blake plays a rather creepy and odd landlady that our FBI heroes get to interview.  Burr is his usual brutal and cold self; Totter is looking a bit worn and tired here - only 33, but with most of her best work behind her - but she's perfectly fine.

All in all, nothing special but a nice enough example of how little studios like this used to be able to make a 75-minute film that was full of incident, colorful faces and personalities (even in black-and-white) and enough fun that you could forget just how generic it is.

Second, TOUGH ASSIGNMENT (1949, directed by William Beaudine)
Donald ""Red"" Barry is probably just barely recognizable to serious 40s and 50s western buffs today; he produces and stars in another Lippert cheapie directed by William ""One-Shot"" Beaudine"" - nicknamed thus not for his liquor capacity but for his speedy shooting ability which allowed him to direct (approximately) 350 films and 100 TV episodes in 53 years.  This is likely one of his better efforts - and it's just OK.  Producer-star Barry has sort of a slowed-down James Cagney look and voice and that's rather appealing, but he was only a borderline name for a few years, never really hitting it big; he mostly did b-westerns, and this is sort of a modern-dress western with some slight noirish elements.

Barry here plays Dan Reilly, a newspaper reporter just returned to LA with his wife, photographer Margie (Marjorie Steele).  Margie insists on taking pictures of everywhere they go, and so as she's walking into a butcher shop she poses for Dan - while at the same time three thugs make their way quickly out after beating up the proprietors.  Soon Margie and Dan are involved in investigating an illegal meat operation that rustles cattle and forces butchers to buy it.  Dan gets beaten up a couple of times, but is undaunted in pursuing the great story - hey, he's only got 64 minutes to do so, he'd best get cracking!

Like I said, this is awfully low budget, and you won't see any particularly famous - or even just sort-of-famous - names in the cast, except perhaps for Steve Brodie who plays the lead heavy, Morgan.  Brodie had significant roles in OUT OF THE PAST and THE STELL HELMET among other films; he usually played bad guys and though he was occasionally the chief villain it doesn't look like he ever got the lead despite good looks and a reasonably commanding presence.  He's fine here, as are the menacing Marc Lawrence and the brutish Steve Richards as a couple of his henchmen, and the leads are fine, but the film is pretty routine and undistinguished overall with no real drama or excitement to speak of, particularly in the last half.

Both films have commentaries, which I haven't listened to yet; there's a nice short video-bio of Barry and several trailers.  The image and sound quality here is really pretty solid; VCI can be rather variable but they've been doing a better job all the time and this series in particular has always been nicely presented.  Definitely worth a look for us serious fans of the lower-budget side of the noir and crime film.",1267142400,7,5357,4.7841648590021695
8178495,4,B000NJM6EQ,"FBI Girl/Tough Assignment (1951/1949) These two similar crime flicks have been paired up on one DVD as a volume of ""Forgotten Noir."" I'm not sure they both qualify as true noir, but that's a discussion for another time. More importantly, are they fun to watch? I'm happy to report that they are. FBI Girl pairs Cesar Romero and George Brent as two special agents for the Bureau up against smooth villain Raymond Burr who has criminal ties all the way up to the governor of the unnamed state the agents work in. This one is pretty good, with some early police procedural work mixed in with some actual action setpieces (a boat vs helicopter chase!) all tied up in a bow by the star trio. Tough Assignment is also fun, punching in for a fast hour and two minutes. A reporter (Don ""Red"" Barry) and his new bride (the curiously fetching Marjorie Steele) run afoul of beef smuggling bad guys (including 2 time Bond villain Marc Lawrence; perennial Superman baddie Ben Welden; and the ever energetic Sid Melton of TV's Green Acres), then go undercover to bust the ring. While shot on a noticeably lower budget than FBI Girl, Assignment is still pretty fun, with a couple of quick fist fights and gun battles to keep things moving. Basically, if you like old movies at all, there are enough familiar faces here to warrant a recommendation, and move that up a notch if you're a buff of this kind of crime movie.",1230854400,3,1403,4.571428571428571
