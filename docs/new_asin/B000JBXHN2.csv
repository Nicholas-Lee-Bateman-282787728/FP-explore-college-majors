Ambulances- Doing the same stuff as doctors, but at 60MPH!!",1299283200,,274,4.956521739130435
8149537,3,B000JBXHN2,"This is a fairly good historical overview of 'the ambulance' especially from the military perspective. The title implies an emphasis on the vehicles but it is really about the organization of patient transport services. I found it a little short on covering the civilian side of ambulance history.
