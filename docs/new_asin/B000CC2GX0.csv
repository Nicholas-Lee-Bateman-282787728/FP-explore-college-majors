2455531,5,B000CC2GX0,"This DVD is great for an afternoon on the couch reading or resting, or play it whenever you need something calming to help you relax.  I enjoyed the sounds that go along with the scenes.  Much better than just a regular relaxation CD.",1169683200,,234,4.4186046511627906
2455532,5,B000CC2GX0,"This is an awesome collection of relaxing scenes with choices in scenes, music--classical, jazz, natural sound effects or a combination.  You can develop your personal playlist of scenes and music.  Each scene is on a continous loop so you can let it run without constantly enforcing the play setting. Skip the reality shows and bad TV and let your mind and thoughts breathe.",1155254400,4,375,4.936507936507937
2455533,2,B000CC2GX0,"I bought this item to be played in a nursing home's dementia unit's dayroom. Some of the scenery was good because it involved some kind of visual stimulation (things moving) but the ones that were still did not serve their purpose. The music was also ok, but needed a little bit more variety. It was alright, but not awesome.",1142812800,17,325,4.52542372881356
8096790,5,B000CC2GX0,"So many beautiful scenes, so many choices! I have migraines, a dark room, cool air and this beautiful dvd is just the ticket. Lovely, soft classical music, serene views, so nice. The dvd cover belies what is inside. The dvd cover is garish and harsh, but what's inside is what counts. Such a nice choice, for serenity and so many different choices of scenery and music, I LOVE this dvd,",1502668800,,386,4.5285714285714285

8096792,5,B000CC2GX0,We like this because sometimes it is nice to sit and read and then glance up at the TV and see the pictures and listen to the music,1389312000,,131,3.7142857142857144
8096793,5,B000CC2GX0,"This DVD is awesome. There's about 15+ scenes you can choose and for each each scene, you can customize the music or sound effects you want. You can also mix the sound effects with the music. It's really relaxing and perfect for background noise while you read.",1330992000,,261,4.574468085106383
8096794,4,B000CC2GX0,Very Beautiful scenes. Only reason it didn't get a 5 star rating is only because there are two pointless scenes that are computerized.,1279843200,,134,4.869565217391305
8096795,4,B000CC2GX0,"you will need to know how to set your wide screen TV and DVD to get wide screen, which I have not yet been able to do even following the directions. So I am not sure about where the fault is. I was not impressed with their help site and I see no number for a help line.",1234828800,,269,3.6551724137931036
8096796,2,B000CC2GX0,"I didn't enjoy this DVD because the front cover suggest a beach with palm trees. There was one scene with a palm tree lined beach at sunset and that was it. There are a lot of other nature scenes that don't appeal to me and if I could have seen the back of the DVD, I would not have purchased it.",1233446400,,296,3.8688524590163933
8096797,5,B000CC2GX0,"I am very happy with this DVD. There is a great variety of gorgeous scenes to watch. The picture quality is very nice. Its so relaxing that the first time I watched it I fell asleep. The colors are vibrant, picture clear and sharp. I love having the ability to customize the viewing experience, being allowed to order which scenes you would like to see. The sound options are great as well, and quite the variety! Great to customize the sound to your moods. The nature sound effects are very real and life like. This is my all time favorite DVD, and I look forward to watching it over and over!!",1230940800,3,595,4.36936936936937
8096798,3,B000CC2GX0,"14 Serene Scenes of Relaxation, Wellness, and Stress Relief DVD.  I work from home and play this in the background.  You can select the scenes you want to play the type of music/sound or play all.  I like the Ambient water best.",1226793600,,228,4.380952380952381
8096799,2,B000CC2GX0,"Some of the scenes are OK.  Three are computer generated with one being Lava Lamp meets Ghostbuster slime.  Too many of the butterflies are ragged and the stream is artificial.

What I most dislike is unless I play each scene seperately, the play is continuous and totally random.  Some scenes played 5 or 6 times before a new scene appeared and maybe a dozen times by the time the last scene played.

One review said there was an option for natural sounds, but my disc only plays contemporary, classical, or random music.

Less than half the scenes are interesting to me for even one play.  There are so many better relaxing DVDs in my collection I will probably toss this one.",1180310400,7,678,4.553719008264463
