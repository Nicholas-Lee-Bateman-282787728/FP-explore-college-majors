8386571,3,B003154610,"A man who's fishing finds a dead woman's body in the creek bed (his fish hook's stuck in her), pulls her lifeless form ashore, and finds out she's pregnant with a baby that's still alive inside her. He delivers the baby and brings the male infant to a temple, where the child is raised as a monk.

Later, when he's in his late teens/early 20's (much of the plot details are vague), he rescues the daughter of a yakuza boss who was being abused by local thugs, and he's enamored with her immediately, stepping out of his shell and suddenly changing from within, becoming assertive, aggressive and lustful. The two become lovers, and the yakuza are impressed with his sense of duality and petition him to perform a hit for them. In a not-so-shocking twist, he finds out he might be related to the woman he's in love with, and now his life spirals into a dark abyss of criminality, desperation and sin.

OK, that's the plot in a nutshell, and here's what I have a problem with. I find it almost impossible to believe that someone who spent every day of his life in a monastery capable of an overnight transformation into an amoral, incestuous killer. The doomed-from-the-start relationship wasn't fleshed out so that you cared about the characters, it's just thrust upon you and you're supposed to buy into it without even a limp sales pitch offered within the plot.

Here's something else all of you will have a difficult time with - this flick, along with its sister film by director Tatsumi Kumashiro, 'Twisted Path Of Love', are touted as exploitation/sexploitation, yet in each and every nude/sex scene, there are huge black boxes over the juiciest bits, and that's why more than half the people who purchase these flicks got them in the first place! WTF indeed, my friends.

So what we're left with after the censorship travesty is a half-baked story, weak and uninteresting characters, half-assed direction and a seen-it-coming ending. Trust me, on my honor, there isn't much justice here... or anything erotic.",1286582400,3,2015,4.781609195402299
