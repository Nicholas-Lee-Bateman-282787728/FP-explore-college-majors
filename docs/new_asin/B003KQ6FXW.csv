E.g, why do they arm themselves with just pistols when they expect to face criminals armed with machine guns and rockets? Why does a detective go alone to confront a mafioso in his den? Shouldn't the public protectors be required to have at least an IQ of 100?",1330214400,,358,4.609375

4133990,5,B003KQ6FXW,"I've just finished watching all six episodes of Series 1 of The Octopus (La Piovra in Italian).  The plot, in brief, is that one evening Chief Inspector Marineo, the head policeman of a small Sicilian town in 1983, is found dead with gunshot wounds in an abandoned car.  Corrado Cattani (Michele Placido) is appointed to take up the post of the murdered chief inspector, and moves from Milan to Sicily with his wife Else and their 12 year old daughter Paola.  Full of energy and with an overriding awareness of the need to see that justice is done, Cattani sets about investigating who was behind Marineo's murder and but quickly realises there are powerful forces in the town that don't want him to find out - and it's at this point that the dreaded word ""Mafia"" is uttered.  The investigation takes a number of unexpected turns, and Cattani soon becomes embroiled in the Mafia's sinister world of organised crime, drug trafficking and brutality, with appalling professional and personal costs.  The series illustrates how deeply embedded the Mafia were in Italy's political and business elites - hence the title of the series, evoking the way the Mafia's tentacles reach into every corner of the country's life.

This series is absolutely wonderful in every respect, and I thoroughly enjoyed all six episodes.  The quality of the performances is so exceptional, and the story lines, set and production so impressive that I'm surprised the series isn't better known outside Italy and Italian-speaking communities.  Michele Placido is just perfect in the leading role - he beautifully conveys the character of the tortured, unpredictable Cattani - and there are some truly heart-warming scenes.  Also worth watching for those with an interest in Italian fashion (Cattani's stylish wardrobe is one of the pleasures of the series) and European cars of the 1980s (plenty of Alfa Romeos and Mercedes Benzes to spot).

Highly recommended.",1312070400,6,1933,5.069400630914826
4133991,5,B003KQ6FXW,These saga was broadcasted in the 90ies in my home country and it's one of the best films about the reality in Italy and the Mafia activity there! Everybody was 'in love' with Michele Placido (including me :) and it is a very powerful story. The Godfather looks weak and insignificant compared with The Octopus believe me! Absolutely amazing!,1288310400,17,342,4.813559322033898
4133992,5,B003KQ6FXW,"I've only seen a few sporadic episodes but I watched Series 10, Part 1, and was totally gripped by it so I'm getting Series 1 and work my way up until I have the entire series.  This series has been running on a Virginia television channel.  The acting is first rate and so is the script.  You can pick it up at the end and still know what happened.  It's better than The Godfather movies, which is not to put down those two great movies.  But it covers more over a longer period of time and you can see how the actors/characters age.

I know the dvds are pricey but are definitely worth the price.  Very, very strong and powerful, not to mention addictive.",1283472000,16,657,4.25

8398877,5,B003KQ6FXW,"I bought all 10 series some years ago and enjoyed immensely. I recently lent them to a friend who experienced similar enjoyment. When he returned them I decided to watch the series again. I'm halfway through and I'm surprised how much I had forgotten from my previous viewings.  I have watched other miniseries (Sopranos, Breaking Bad etc) and enjoyed but rate The Octopus above them all. If anyone knows of a better series, please let me know.",1453852800,,444,4.766233766233766

8398879,1,B003KQ6FXW,Glad I only bought season 1. The overly dramatic music became a running joke in our household. Overly melodramatic with characters that just didn't hit the mark with me.,1422230400,,169,4.862068965517241

8398881,2,B003KQ6FXW,"This saga, first broadcast in 1984, is showing its whiskers.  Handsome Chief Inspector Corrado Cattani arrives in Sicily to investigate the murder of the Chief Inspector he is replacing, along with the murder of a Countess. Will Chief Inspector Cattani and his wife ever stop bickering? Who killed both the previous Chief Inspector and the Countess?  Was it the Mafia?  Will Chief Inspector Cattani and his wife ever stop bickering? Who murdered the Chief Inspector's new partner? Was it the Mafia?  Will Chief Inspector Cattani and his wife ever stop bickering? Cattani's wife jumps into bed with a TV anchorman and confesses to him. Cattani jumps into bed with the Countess's drug addicted daughter and confesses to his wife.  Will Cattani and his wife ever stop bickering? She moves back to Milan.  He captures the guys who killed the previous Chief Inspector, his partner and the Countess and vows to stamp out the Mafia.  If you want to find out if he succeeds in wiping out the Mafia and if he ever stops bickering with his wife, then waste your money on this series where the only thing missing are the Ivory Soap commercials.

If you want to view a couple of truly great Italian crime series, spend your money on Donna Leon, getting fantastic scenes of Venice in the bargain and Inspector Montalbano, filmed in Sicily.  You won't be sorry with buying either or both!",1365206400,,1374,4.788135593220339
8398882,5,B003KQ6FXW,"This series is an interesting look at the tension between ordinary people and the dark side of life!  The ending of the first episode has left us anticiating the next one, immediately!",1361059200,,184,4.75
8398883,4,B003KQ6FXW,"The Octopus or La Piovra as it was called in Italy delivers a true picture of the corrupt and decadent force of organized crime. Because I have many friends and relatives in Italy, I believe La Piovra shows a true picture of how far Organized crime and The Mafia are willing to go to thwart opposition, whether it comes from political figures, the police, the judiciery or private citizens. The drama and tension in this series at times is unbearably intense. I found myself more than once fast forwarding to learn the outcome of an episode and then going back to watch it unfold naturally. Having said this and in deferance to a previous review perhaps there is a deficiency when it comes to the portrayal of the attitude of some of the police and how they fight the lower elements of the criminals. However the show is afterall fictional, namely a mystery-crime/drama series, created for the purpose of entertaining the public. While it may enlighten in some respects it may fall short in in others. What the stories definitly do have is engaging characters, good plots and sub plots and plenty of action. What else do we want in TV?
  Of course its all delivered (at least in early episodes)in a 90's retro sort of way which one minds less or more depending upon age. The quality of the image is a bit grainy and the color a bit splotchy but tolerable certainly. Sub titles are a problem but worth the trouble for those of us hungry for more entertaiment spoken in Italian. Fortunately my Italian is pretty good so I pick up alot although I still read the subtitles thoroughly as I worry about missing something. It's true that The Octopus is not in the same class as the ""Montalbano"" series or the new series entitled ""Nebbia e' Delitti"" but at the very least it is good solid entertainment and worth the low price of admission. We have completed viewing series 1 though 4 and have just recieved series 5 and 6.",1350432000,3,1915,4.563953488372093
8398884,5,B003KQ6FXW,"It's not easy to review something as sprawling as THE OCTOPUS. Weighing in at 392 minutes and spread over six episodes, it's got so many characters, so many sub-plots and intrigues, that finishing it gives the viewer a sense of having come out the other side of a long, dark, dangerous tunnel - a tunnel where nobody was safe, including the watcher's emotions. This show is one rough ride, but damn, is it work taking.

THE OCTOPUS follows Corrado Cattani (Michele Placido), a hard-charging but highly moralistic Italian policeman who, at the show's opening, has just been offered the post of Chief Inspector of Palermo, Sicily. The ambitious Cattani is ambivalent about the post, considering Palermo a backwater, that his predecessor was murdered, and that his marriage to wife Else (Nicole Jamet) is already on the rocks. He agrees to let the young deputy chief Leo De Maria (Massimo Bonetti) show him around the town, however, and is quickly intrigued by a gorgeous young aristocrat with a heroin problem named ""Teeti"" Scialoa (Barbara de Rossi). Teeti's boyfriend is a street mobster named Sante Cirinn (Angelo Infante), and following Cirinn's slime-trail into the world of law, elite society and high finance, he soon begins to get his first glimpse of just how many tentacles ""la piovra"" (the octopus - what Italians call the Mafia) really has, and just how strong their grip on Sicilian society is. Ensnared by Teeti's beauty and vulnerability, and drawn further into the mystery of just how and why his predecessor was knocked off, Corrado hardly notices that a snarky journalist named Nanni Santamaria (Pino Colozzi) is putting the moves on his wife, or that his beloved daughter Paola is falling into depression. He's even clueless about the hidden agendas of his boss Cannito (Jacques Daquimine) and his chief deputy, the enigmatic Altero (Renato Mori). Cattani's navete, however, proves to be something of an asset; not understanding the nature of the power he's up against, he confronts it without fear, rattling the Mafia's cage and rapidly turning a routine investigation into a brutal personal struggle in which no one is safe - not even Cattani's family.

OCTOPUS is absolutely fascinating television. Once you get past the difference in cinematic style, the portentious music (dum-dum-DUM! - Ennio Morricone, all up in your face), and the fact that the Italians speak their language at the rate of 200 words per minute, you find yourself sucked into a dramatic black hole from which there is no escape. The series cranks the tension slowly but remorselessly, adopting a ""no one is safe"" policy with even its main characters, so that you literally have no idea who is going to make it out of the episode alive. Eschewing the slam-bang style of American television, it sets up the drama with intelligence and crackling dialogue, developing each of its characters, good and bad, rather than handing us simple good-and-evil stereotypes. But when the violence comes, it comes brutally and realistically, without any attempt to stylize or glamorize it. Indeed, there has seldom been a more scrupulous and damning attack on the Mafia than this series. The Italians are fond of saying that ""the Mafia is a bureacracy"", and they are right; the American-style street soldiers like Cirinn, for all their brutality and viciousness (and Cirinn really is a scumbag), are merely flunkies. The really big fish are bankers, lawyers, financiers, government officials and even policemen who don't merely work with the Octopus but occupy its uppermost rungs. These smiling scum are the sorts who give the orders and reap the benefits but are always somewhere else when the trigger is pulled, and notwithstanding his increasingly bitter blood-feud with Cirinn, it is against them that Cattani's real vendetta is ultimately waged.

As for the actors, it's impossible to give all the credit that's due. Michele Placido's performance is great - his angry eyes, expressionless face and monotone voice mask both frustrated romantic longings and a burning desire to see justice done. Barbara de la Rossi is not only breathtakingly gorgeous, she plays Teeti's drug-addled poor-little-rich-girl to perfection. Angelo Infante turns in an excellent performance as a mob street soldier so totally evil you pray for a lightning bolt to strike him dead. So too is Franois Prier as Terrasini, a bigshot lawyer who also happens to be the biggest Mafia shot-caller in Palermo. Laudeo (Paul Guers) is smoothly villainous as the head of Itala, a political syndicate on the Italian mainland that works in tandem with the Mafia (for now). Renato Mori is also excellent as the troubled and mysterious Altero, a big man nursing a very big secret.

I could go on, but you get the point - this is one patient and pitiless tale, well calculated to keep you in suspense. If it has elements of the soap opera to it, and if occasionally you wonder why the hell some of these people don't look over their shoulders a bit more often, these are flaws easily forgiven. If you are the type of person who likes their drama with some intelligence, their characters in three dimensions, and their stories complex and deep, OCTOPUS is for you. Arrevaderci!",1348531200,2,5216,5.0265895953757225
