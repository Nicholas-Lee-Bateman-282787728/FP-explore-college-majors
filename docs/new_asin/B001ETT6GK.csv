8299506,3,B001ETT6GK,"I just received the product in the mail, I decided to go for this set because it was the only set without the movies listed.  So I figured I could help other people decide by telling you what the back says.  I have not seen any of these movies or the quality, maybe I will write a second review for that one day, but for now, I will write a list of the 100 movies on the 8 DVDs.

Editing this in: I haven't watched much of it yet, but a lot of these aren't movies, and just episodes from TV shows. I watched Frankenstein, not really clicking that it wasn't credited to Boris Karloff and thought it was the orignal movie, it was a really poor 20 minute episode from the 30's. I didn't think it was done well at all. I also watched White Zombie, which was alright, the quality wasn't the greatest, but this is a movie from the 30's.

I was looking at some of the other titles listed on the back on IMDB, they're hard to find because 50% of the titles on the back come from either ""Tales of the Unexpected"", a TV series that lasted through most of the 80's or all the William Boyd parts are from a 12 episode series from the 30's. (end edit)
