7938023,5,B00005CBSU,"this series was great work by Lumet A&E should wake up and put out the complete series on dvd. Being a former cop, I think most police officers would buy it.

7938026,5,B00005CBSU,I still for the life of me can't understand why this show is not on Dvd as yet. What is A&E doing with this show?  Is it collecting dust.  Something needs to be done.  There's too much crap being shoveled onto DvD for this great and interesting show to not get its due.,1263600000,9,269,4.037735849056604
