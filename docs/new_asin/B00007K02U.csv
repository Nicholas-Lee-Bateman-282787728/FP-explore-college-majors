Bodyguard they made new subtitles but they cheated by blacking the bottom part of the picture where the old subs and just put the new subs on top of that. Translation is good though. Nevertheless this was a good deal to get these 3 movies so I can complete my collection.",1519862400,,489,4.258064516129032
