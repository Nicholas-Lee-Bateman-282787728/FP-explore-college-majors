1779420,3,B00006JDS9,"this movie is not as bad as the other reviewers say it is.yes its slow not gory and there is plenty of flaws but all and all the movie is still pretty good.there isn't alot of murder scenes though the murder scenes that are in the movie are pretty good in that cheesey b horror way.not the greatest directing but not the worst in the world by no means at all. the story isn't to original but the ending is for its time,though it does have a little pinch of hitchcock,it still is an original ending for its time.real horror fans stick it out and wait for the ending, im sure you won't be as discruntled as the other reviewers are.the problem with this movie is the pace,its really slow and there should have been another murder or two.other than that it was a good corney but spooky,forcefully suspenseful(as in the pace of the movie)budget flick. IT DESERVES MORE THAN 1 STAR and i liked it.hurry up and get it before you cant find it anymore.even if its just for the spooky,twisted,make u feel dirty ending,its worth it, despite the nay sayers. so get the dvd,flaws and all.flaws hmmmmmmm! doesn't that define b style horror movies??

There is plenty of dead time between scenes, the story line is ridiculous, the acting is the worst I've ever seen, and the pace of the film is so slow that I dare you to try to stay awake through the whole thing.

1779424,2,B00006JDS9,"Three young pretty girls go on a road trip to a concert. All of a sudden they meet into an accident due to a storm which drives them off the road. They are taken in by a kindly couple & an old lady in a wheelchair in a Gothic-style Victorian mansion where everything & everyone seems a little odd...
I bought this DVD from Best Buy with the lurid titles that said that this low budget American film contains ""NUDITY, VIOLENCE, LANGUAGE, DISTURBING THEMES"", & it was ""BANNED IN ENGLAND IN 1985 & WAS PULLED FROM DISTRIBUTION"". Wow! What clever marketing by the producers of this DVD to disguise the fact that this is nothing more than an average slasher, teen-aged girls in peril film. Needless to say, I was very disappointed when I saw this independent;y produced low budget American horror film. As a film by itself, it was not bad. It was filmed in grainy film stock which conveyed good use of lighting which gives a very atmospheric look to the film. At times, the film looked very muddy which is a big disappointment as well. The nudity was there, but not as lurid as the film suggested. The gore was minimal, only bloody moments & the actual killing were done off-screen.
Very disappointed in this film. Good for a rental...maybe. Just your run-of-the-mill slasher film. Nothing more. You can probably find more disturbing & creepy moments if you bought LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT in which this film tries to emulate, but failed. Watch LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT instead.
And the audio commentary by ""The Detractors"" was very annoying & not comical at all.
I give this film 2 stars out of 5.",1044144000,3,1589,4.54006968641115

1779426,2,B00006JDS9,"Now we all know during the golden age of slasher films, slasher films were coming out left and right. This film is no different. Horrible acting (more so than usual) with gore added in. Now the gore in this film is not as nasty as one would think. I would assume that is was considered a video nasty not with seeing the gore, but the implied effects of the machete slicing these women up. The end, oh yes, is very different from the typical slasher based films of the early 80s. Is this considered original? NO, Not to give away the ending, but this has been done before so was not as shocking to me.  This is what I call a perfect movie to watch with a group of friends. You will laugh till you cry! The ending made me laugh so hard, I swear I thought it was a comedy. If you find this movie cheap, and I mean VERY cheap, buy it, if you have to spend more than $5 dollars, its a waste. I myself love low budget films of the 80s, I own quite a few, but common people this acting reminds me of ""Don't Go in the Woods"", or ""The Prey"".

1779427,1,B00006JDS9,"Unhinged where do I begin,why this movie was on the video nasties list is beyond me than again most of the movies on the list had no business being on there in the first place, plus there were a big mess of movies that should have been on there that had no mention. They say the movie was banned for graphic violence and gratutious nudity, as for the grapic violence 4 deaths total and the acutual death is implied, and than the camera pans to the victims face, as for the nudity one scene and you get to see everything nothing gratutious here. I guess the movie had little budget due to the fact they spent most of the budget trying to secure the mansion it was filmed in (could be wrong read about it on the internet)  My biggest qualm with this movie was not enough gore, yeah the 4 murders were pretty grim, but I would have liked to see the acutual act instead of having it be implied that it happened, the story was  so so and it was a very slow paced movie, Unhinged could have been a good movie had a little more effort been put into it, I went into this movie with an open mind, but the movie just fell apart and I lost intrest rather quick.  If your into low budget schlock and don't care for over the top gore than I guess this movie is for you.",1337472000,,1256,4.097560975609756
1779428,4,B00006JDS9,"If you take a look at plenty of reviews for the film you'll notice it seems that a good portion seemed to rather dislike Unhinged. I disagree completly with the negative reviews of this one. I find Unhinged despite being flawed in various ways to be an interesting and often creepy slasher film. Now let's get the flaws out of the way. First off Unhinged is extremely poorly acted by pretty much everyone in the film aside from the actress who plays Marion. They spit out silly dialogue left and right and seem as if they are sleepwalking or just flat out bored by acting in this film. If only the film had better actors we'd  have a possible perfect film but in some ways the bad actors do give a certain bad movie charm to the film. Another problem is the pacing of the film. Though I thought the film was highly enjoyable many others think it's talky and slow. Some scenes do linger on a bit too long but that's an amateur filmmaker for you. They never know where to edit and Unhinged does suffer a bit from this but like mentioned I didn't mind a bit. The conversations were interesting at least to me. Plus they were usually odd enough to keep you interested. Now those are pretty much the 2 major flaws the film has. Other then that Unhinged is a creepy unnerving film with a terrific atmosphere and oddly enough an original enough storyline. It's very easy to see where the director was going and he really for the most part accomplished his goal. He clearly wanted to make a slasher film that focused on the suspense rather then a bodycount. If only he fixed a few flaws.
Now Unhinged does have a shocking final twist and it's a real good one that truly does make the film 100 percent more effective. One film, a year later did the same twist in a slightly different way. That film went on to be far more known then Unhinged ever became but in it's own right Unhinged did this twist as well as that film did.
Unhinged overall is a creepy film with a knockout final twist. It suffers from poor acting and some pretty awful editing but it is quite an effective film.
Well worth a watch for slasher fans.",1335052800,3,2109,4.352791878172589
1779429,5,B00006JDS9,"I loved unhinged. It started off slow and alot of the movie focuses more on the intense drama of the situation in which 3 friends Nancy, Gloria and Terry are caught when their car goes off the road on the way to a jazz fastival. Enter Marion Penrose- a slightly awkward, quiet and delicate woman who lives alone in a grand mansion-like home with her sexest, bitter, wheel-chair bound mother, Mrs. Penrose. Nancy and Terry are fine from the collision but Gloria will have to stay off her legs and rest for a while. In the attempt to contact their parents, Marion informs them that there is no phone. To get to a phone one of them will have to walk through the woods to town- where several young females have gone missing lately. In the following nights- Terry begins hearing heavy breathing; male heavy breathing and suggests this to Marion. Marion insists it is nothing. Until Nancy starts her trek to the woods and is violently slashed by a hooded apparition with a long scythe. Will Terry survive the horror that awaits? I won't spoil the rest as it has a 'killer' twist- and although slow at times don't let that stop you from buying it! Its a great film and I highly recommend!",1275091200,5,1181,4.497674418604651
1779430,5,B00006JDS9,"No point in lying in this review, I'm just going to tell the truth. Unhinged is a slow, boring, badly acted, badly written, cliche slasher film with only four death scenes. Yes of course these are all true, but there are so many things that are cool about this movie that people don't pay attention to.

The movie is about three cute college girls going to a concert (through a backwoods road of course!) and getting their car stuck in a ravine. They end up sheltered in a secluded mansion with a spinster in her 40s and her sexist mother. If things weren't strange enough for the girls they start to realize they are being watched by somebody and eventually they get killed off one by one.

I think there is a reason this movie is so slow with a very long build up, and this is because there are only four deaths. It's not like it's stab-slit-slash-hack the end, there wouldn't be a movie if it was just that. This movie is slow so you can look forward to the murders or at least the twist ending because both the murders and the ending come out of NOWHERE! The murders actually caught me off guard because each of them come up at random, which makes you wonder who is going to die next. Along with the unexpectedness of the murders, the murders are actually pretty disturbing especially the final murder which is gory and downbeat. The final murder reveals who the killer is and why they're killing which consists of the murderer hacking at one of the girls while rambling insanely as they soak in the girl's blood.

There are some cliche elements in this movie like the presence of peepholes in some of the walls, a character stumbling into a pile of dead bodies, the entire fact that people need to drive on a highway instead of a back road so they won't be killed, and many other aspects of this movie are originally from movies such as Psycho, Last House on the Left, Three on a Meathook, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and then there are some elements in this movie that were later used in other movies such as Sleepaway Camp and even The Dorm that Dripped Blood.

There are also some unsettling moments in the movie (not including the murders) such as a character finding a tooth under one of the beds in the mansion, a scene where the final girl finds a guy peeking at her through her bedroom window, the previously mentioned pile of dead bodies scene, a cool and suspenseful chase scene, and finally the twist ending which just blew my mind because right when you think the movie is over the twist comes out of nowhere. The music is nice too, it adds to the rather depressing and downbeat atmosphere. The acting is pretty damn bad but to be fair the spinster (played by Janet Penner) was actually pretty good and the main character (played by Laurel Munson) seemed truly terrified towards the end of the movie.

Overall it's not a movie for everyone. I loved it like crazy but I've read so reviews dumping on the movie that it makes me wonder if we're not watching the same movie. Anyways, if your want a gory fast paced splatter film with great acting then forget it. If you are VERY patient about movies and want to watch a movie with not a lot of gore but great nudity and creepy atmosphere then it's a must see.",1262217600,5,3223,4.41919191919192
1779431,5,B00006JDS9,"I feel inlove with this low-budget horror when I first saw it,Unhinged is actually a very dark and chilling horror film. I won't say it's the best horror film ever made but it's in a class of it's own. Now I work in the music industry and I must say the film score is absolutely chilling and one of the best horror film scores using analog keyboards at that. I will admit that the whole BANNED FILM info about it doesn't help sell the film,watching it you'll say 'okay this movie isn't gory why was it banned?'I highly recommend seeing the film,if you like low budget horror films that were surprisingly good and your'e not a stickler on the storylines in movies...you'll enjoy this movie:)",1255824000,2,690,4.528

1779436,4,B00006JDS9,"I just finished watching Unhinged and found it to be an entertaining 80 minutes of low budget horror. Though there's less blood than most '80s slasher films, it's well-made and features a good cast. There's a few genuinely creepy breathing-in-the-darkness moments, a somewhat shocking, find-the-bodies scene that utilizes some unique camera work, and an atmospheric quality that actually works. Of course, being a low budget film, there are some problems. Don't expect groundbreaking, high art, and, if you like the older slashers such as The Dorm That Dripped Blood and Sleepaway Camp, you probably won't be disappointed.

However, if you do appreciate low budget horror, you'll probably be annoyed and disgusted by the ""comedy narration"" special feature. This commentary by ""The Detractors"" was by the far the most obnoxious, hackneyed, insulting, and unnecessary feature I've ever experienced on any DVD.  A group of writers and would-be gadflies who had nothing to do with the film strives to be MST3K, but ends up sounding like an inarticulate group of drunken frat kids with no understanding of the horror genre. It's the sort of reaction you'd get from a 5 year old who has just been exposed to surrealism for the first time. ""That is SO stupid! Stupid! I don't get it!"" They make fun of one actress's teeth. Nudity gets overreactions of ""whoa, yeah!"" They attempt to skewer overhead camera angles by making bird sounds. They see the name of the director and joke about how he hasn't achieved a high level of success. Great satire, really great. Way to stick it to Don Gronquist. How brave. Basically, it's really, really embarrassing. The fact that these people, with no knowledge or comprehension of low budget filmmaking, were hired by the distributor to childishly insult everyone involved in the making of the film is offensive to the viewer, as well as the cast and crew. Seriously, when you're the creator of ""Too Much Coffee Man,"" you really shouldn't be throwing big, banal stones around your little glass Portland-area apartment. Why this desperate and mean-spirited attempt at comedy was included in the official release is inexplicable. If there's any poetic justice in this world, everyone involved in this Detractors debacle will have their artistic work showcased 25 years after its creation, only to learn that it is being done so for ironic purposes and that a group of children who know nothing about comics or journalism is waiting in the lobby to point out Brian Vandiver's bad teeth and Shannon Wheeler's receding hairline. Well, that's my rant. It's obviously sad and disproportionate, but if you've experienced this commentary and have any respect for the people who make cheap, independent horror movies, you probably understand.",1156204800,24,2760,5.117516629711751
1779437,3,B00006JDS9,"It's almost always the case when you speak of an early 80's horror film, that you'll speak of bad acting, trite dialogue, cheesy effects and that grainy look. all of the above are represented in this below average early 80's horror flick.

This is one of those movies that was banned from video during the video nasties campaign in the U.K during the 1980's

I would say this movie is pretty tame to get that label but some films, I believe may have been banned due mostly to the title or artwork on the cover of the film (""Driller Killer"" (1979) comes to mind)

Anyway, while the film does have it's moments, ""Unhinged"" drags along at an almost painfully slow pace, with very little action until the last 30 minutes or so. While the body count is low, the styles and gore of the killings would be pleasing to fans of the genre. The ending is well worth the wait, which has an unexpected, nice twist.

1779438,3,B00006JDS9,"It's tough watching a horror flick from 1982 with our 2006 sensabilites. What at the time was considered shocking or daring is now dated or cliched. Keep that in mind when watching flicks like ""Unhinged"". The pace of the movie may be slow compared to flicks of today like ""Venom"" or ""Saw"", and sure the big finale has been seen before in a couple of more mainstream or better known films, but it still packs a nice little punch. I know ""Unhinged"" gained some noteriety by being placed on the Video Nasties List, and unfortunately for ""Unhinged"", because it was placed on that infamous list, people's expectations are raised. It's almost impossible for anyone watching the flick not to be a little disappointed when there are very few death scenes, limited gore....in short you are going to be bound to ask ""why"" was this movie banned?

I enjoyed the movie, I thought it was a cool little B-Movie, with a different enough story to carry it along without getting boring. The acting is awful, especially the three female leads, but it's passable for a slasher flick, and will give you a couple of chuckles. The effects are fine, and the death scenes aren't bad. Maybe I am little more forgiving of ""Unhinged"" since sitting through the grand-daddy of bad slasher flicks ""The Last Slumber Party"" recently, but you could do worse than dropping $10 to see this forgotten flick.

1779439,3,B00006JDS9,"[good things]

Realistically the movie itself was more of a whodunit mystery with a great twist than a bloody slasher-- although there is blood and the deaths are violent. The story itself is a typical story, put 3 teenage girls in a secluded environment, then add the typical horror cliches, and there you go. I thought the story was still average, but without the blood and t n' a, the movie would have not been watchable andbe more reminiscent of a late night movie on Bravo. While the ending was predictable, it was pretty good and was pretty redeeming for sitting through the slow parts.

[the bad]

I personally felt like the movie didn't have enough deaths, mainly because of all of the very slow paced plot development. There were some points where I was very tempted to hit FFWD. The deaths were just too few and far between. I have read many reviews on this movie that stated there was a lot of blood, and alot of nudity--- not at all true.

[final thoughts]

When I first bought this movie I expected so much more. I read alot of reviews on this film, and many of them called it ""Violent and bloody"", which there was a bit of both, but not nearly enough. I can't say I wasn't entertained, I was. The story was a little too slow paced to really make me want to watch this movie again, although once the good, fast parts came the movie was very entertaining. The whole concept of the movie, in general, was good and creepy. Some aspects of this movie really reminded me of Black Christmas.",1136246400,2,1498,4.432727272727273
1779440,2,B00006JDS9,"In the wake of the legendary controversy over Tobe Hooper's THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (1974), John Carpenter and his then-partner Debra Hill created a modest but well-made little independent horror film called HALLOWEEN (1978). Wildly successful--much to the surprise and delight of its creators and distributors--HALLOWEEN was a trailblazer in the horror sub-genre known alternately as ""splatter"" or ""slasher"" cinema and thus became the inspiration for countless imitations of varying quality that were released throughout the 1980s (and even beyond).

1982's UNHINGED is one of those HALLOWEEN wannabes.  Like Tobe Hooper's film before it, UNHINGED was shot outside of Hollywood (in this case, Oregon) using mostly local (and unknown) actors.  And as with both Hooper's and Carpenter's films, it was made on a shoestring budget.  Unfortunately, the cast and crew of UNHINGED didn't have the one underlying thing that both of those other films had going for them--talent!

It would be impossible to enumerate all of the copious flaws in this film, so let's just tick off the obvious ones.  First, the smoke-thin plot of UNHINGED is highly derivative: Three young girls on their way to a rock festival lose their way and wind up in the clutches of a family of loonies.  Genre fans will recognize this basic outline from the plots of countless earlier films, not the least of which are genre greats like Hitchcock's PSYCHO (1960) and Wes Craven's LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1972) and THE HILLS HAVE EYES (1977).  Secondly, the acting is atrocious.  Especially lacking in thespian abilities are the girls portraying  the three young concertgoers, who most of the time come off as simply stoic cardboard cutouts that talk.  Thirdly, the cinematography is marginal, and the night scenes, especially the outdoor ones, are murky, often making it difficult to see what's taking place.  And finally, the film's runtime is often padded out with unnecessarily long fades between scenes and lingering shots of trees and other exteriors.  This quickly becomes an irritation to the viewer.

Though they are few and do not outweigh the bad, UNHINGED is not without its good points.  These include a couple of delicious nude scenes, one of which has two of the pretty female leads showering together.  Also, the atmosphere is perfect for a horror flick.  The film is set primarily in an old, isolated Victorian mansion, and most of the time the weather at this locale is either rain or a dreary overcast sky. A delightfully eerie ambiance.  The requisite kills offered--death by scythe, an axe through the head, and repeated stabbing with a machete--are also pretty good, although the actual dirty deeds take place just outside the frame and are therefore implied.  Lots of realistic-looking blood in the aftermath, though, makes up for the off-screen action.

Much has been said by other critics about the film's ""surprise"" ending.  Though there are a few hints to the ending elsewhere in the film, it is true that the revelation at the film's climax will surprise many viewers.  However, the same sort of surprise ending was carried off to better effect in the following year's SLEEPAWAY CAMP (1983), and the later film also had much more talent both behind and in front of the camera.

There's also a lot of talk about the fact that UNHINGED is a ""banned"" film.  Yes, it was on the notorious ""video nasties"" list in the UK.  But after screening UNHINGED, modern viewers will scratch their heads and wonder what all the hubbub was about.  By today's standards, the gore and violence are minimal, and residents of Great Britain see just as much nudity, if not more, on the telly each day.

The DVD release of UNHINGED from Brentwood is inexpensive enough, but even so, serious film buffs will balk at the quality of the disc.  The digital transfer is at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1, and while this appears to be the original aspect ratio of the film, the fuzzy image quality and occasional appearances of translucent rainbow swirls makes one wonder if the disc was mastered from a VHS tape.  And the extras are sparse.  The only bonus feature worth viewing is a segment from an Oregon-based TV talk show in which the film's director, Don Gronquist, and actress J.E. Penner are interviewed.  If there are any doubts about the filmmakers' lack of talent and showmanship, this interview will clear things up.  The only other extra, a comedic commentary, is a waste of precious time.

In short, UNHINGED is truly a minor footnote in the history of horror films.  Ardent fans of the slasher sub-genre might want to view it once for ""academic"" purposes, but the average viewer will want to avoid this flick like they would the Plague.",1131148800,9,4712,4.945362134688692
1779441,2,B00006JDS9,"Unhinged has a decent storyline going, though it's not entirely put together just right. The ending is cool, but by that time the slow pacing and poor acting make it so that you don't really care.

The DVD case talks about the movie containing violence, nudity, sexual repression, and how it was banned in the UK. I guess one muff shot was enough for a ban, because besides that and some cheap gore and chicken bones at the end, there's nothing exciting here.

I picked it up for cheap, so I'm not too upset. There's also a comedy commentary track. I started listening to it, and it's hilarious. Ultimately, it helps me to not feel pained over buying this.

One star for the movie itself, another star for the hilarious commentary track.",1130803200,,737,4.568181818181818
1779442,2,B00006JDS9,"Don't believe the hype! In the UK, ""Unhinged"" was once banned - incredibly - as a ""video nasty"" film, which awarded legendary status to every film that came under the catchy term...but there's absolutely no reason for any other country to pay this movie the slightest attention! The story involves 3 girls who run into car trouble on a long trip and find themselves seeking help at a large country house occupied by some very strange inhabitants. However, any possible tension that could arise from the girl's predicament is drained by the totally inept direction which drags the whole film down into terminal boredom territory. In nearly all the scenes, the camera is simply planted in front of the main characters in various rooms and we watch them talk to each other with no changes of angle or close-ups for several minutes at a time...most notably an excruciatingly boring dinner scene which will have you desperately reaching for the fast-forward button. As for shocking moments, there are very few, and there's nothing here that should have ever provided any cause for concern. I will say in support of the film that the outdoor murder involving a scythe is one that provides a minor thrill....but that and the ""twist"" ending, which is quite a hoot, put together, provide only 10 minutes of entertainment out of the entire running time.

For a UK resident, the film was only ever worth watching in the good old VHS pre-certification days, due to it's rarity. Now that it's freely available, it shows how dismal it really is compared to all the better known slasher films on the market. For curious ""nasty"" completists only.",1117756800,,1630,4.863309352517986
1779443,3,B00006JDS9,"Brian Vandiver's ""UNHINGED"" is a very slow paced movie but it also has its up moments & in my opinion the very creepy ending saves it from being a DUD! Its about a few girls who get stranded at a spooky old mansion with a couple of spooky/wacky host's & things VERY SLOWLY start to get weird,creepy & deadly. like i said in my opinion the very creepy ending makes the movie worth it.",1112572800,,383,4.1891891891891895
1779444,1,B00006JDS9,"I have seen hundreds of horror films in my time, and I would put this one in the top five worst I've ever seen. It's not even that charming so-bad-it's-good kind of flick. It's just plain bad. I found myself checking my watch throughout the movie and hoping that something--anything--would happen on screen. There are three bloody murders, but the rest of the movie is terribly slow and dull. The lighting is too dark, the editing looks like it was done by high school students, and the acting could have been better performed by robots. If you are forced by gunpoint to watch this movie, check out the special features. They contain an interview with the director and co-writer. Try to make some sense out of what he's talking about--or even if he's capable of speech--and you'll see why this movie is such a disaster.",1109116800,3,819,4.655172413793103
1779445,4,B00006JDS9,"OK, let me be honest, this in no classic horror film. But for bonafide 80s slasher film fans, it's a must have, or at least a must-see. Why? Some good murders, a great cheesy synth score, and the sleazy shock ending.
Three cute chicks get stuck at an old mansion after their car crashes, put up by a spinster and her batty old mother for the night. Of course, there is a mad killer on the loose...
Outrageously over the top acting, goofy dialogue and bad 80s make-up and hair had me laughing out loud.
Don't get me wrong, the film has it's flaws....not enough killings (although the few we get are top-notch), a tad too slow paced....but it's an important part of the 80s slasher craze, and is a must for completists.",1084147200,3,717,4.398496240601504

7969987,2,B00006JDS9,"Big fan of 1980s slasher movies, but this is not a movie I'd watch twice.

As has been stated in previous reviews, the acting is fairly weak. Which you can sometimes get away with in slasher movies, but this one didn't have much else going for it.

The kills/bloody scenes are far less frequent then it's label as a Video Nasty would imply. *Mild Spoiler""*  Also, I wasn't as surprised by the ending as some reviewers here seemed to be.

Okay if you're a collector, but I wouldn't go out of your way or spend too much money to watch this.

For those interested in the DVD Extras, there was a commentary included. I didn't bother watching it, as I wasn't sufficiently interested in the movie to do so.",1517961600,,700,4.395348837209302

7969994,2,B00006JDS9,"Don't believe the hype. This is an obscure film, and rightfully so. Few deaths, with very little gore -- most of it offscreen. The kind of low budget horror film where we see the knife or ax come down, then cut to bedsheets or a face splattered with blood. But no actual cutting is seen.

Hey, that's okay. I don't need gore. But there's very little of anything else worth seeing.

UNHINGED is what's been called ""Southern Gothic,"" expect that it's set in California (though filmed in Oregon), so I suppose it's an example of ""California Gothic."" By which I mean, a once rich family, scandalized by a dark secret, now decaying away in a dark, brooding mansion.

In the story, three young women, on their way to a rock concert, experience car trouble. They end up at this mansion. And of course, the body count mounts. (Not a very large body count.)

Much of this film is endless talking, and talking, and talking. Long speeches by a senile matriarch, about how grand the family was at one time. Oh how they entertained! All the interesting writers and artists that would stay with them, in the good old days. The conversations they'd have out on the veranda ... blah, blah, blah.

The matriarch has a dried-up spinster of a daughter, whom the matriarch constantly bullies. The spinster daughter later contributes her own speeches, about the family's dark secrets, her father's scandal, and why her mother hates all men ... blah, blah, blah.

Understand, there are multiple speeches in this film, not just two.

Terry, the lead young woman stranded at the mansion, is mind-bogglingly stupid, even by slasher film standards. She suspects nothing, even when her friend goes missing for an entire day. The friend had gone through the woods into town, to find a phone, because the mansion has no phone. Says Terry of her missing friend, ""Oh, she knows how to take care of herself. I'm sure she's all right."" Dum-dee-dum. Dum-dee-dee.

There's a brief shot of two young women having a conversation in the shower. One is showering while the other's drying herself. Evidently, they had to have their conversation in the shower, together, with both of them nude. They couldn't wait until they'd finished their showers, though their conversation is not especially urgent. Of course, it's just a way for the filmmaker to insert a brief nudie shot into the film. There's one other brief nudie shot of Terry showering by herself at the film's start. That's it for the nudies.

I mention this, because the film's promo material suggests there's much graphic nudity and violence. There's not much of either. Just a LOT of speeches given by two older women to two stupid women.

Although the film's just under 80 minutes, it felt much longer. Yes, there was atmosphere. But the story was so slight, the speeches so long and boring, the victims so Barbie doll mindless, and any violence or horror so brief, I was bored.

UNHINGED is no classic of the slasher subgenre. Not historically important, not envelop-pushing, and not very entertaining. Slasher completists may want to take a look, and American Gothic fans might even like it, but don't overpay or expect too much.",1384560000,,3155,4.802583025830258
7969995,1,B00006JDS9,I heard a lot about this movie thinking it was going to be very good. I read a lot online and it seemed interesting but the movie sucked. When I watched the ending I was angry with myself for buying the dvd. It was not scary. It was boring and not much action. The ending sucks. I recommend you don't see this film but everyone is different. If you want to give it a try I would reccomend renting it first then buying it. Cheers!,1362355200,,429,4.0588235294117645
