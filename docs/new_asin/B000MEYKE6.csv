2729692,3,B000MEYKE6,"""Penny Dreadful"" is one of the 8 After Dark Horrorfest films that saw theatrical release over the course of one weekend in 2006. I considered going to the movies to see a few of the films but figured the DVD's would probably cost me less than the fare of a movie ticket (I was right based on the sale price the week they were released). Besides, I can deal with disappointment watching a bad movie on disc than seeing one in the movies.

I'm a big fan of horror movies and can be pretty lenient in my opinion of them as long as they aren't a complete disaster. (See my review of ""The Beast of Bray Road""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beast-Of-Bray-Road/dp/B000AM4PCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beast Of Bray Road</a>for an example of complete disaster. ""Penny Dreadful"" falls somewhere in the half way point.

The film focuses on Penny Deerborn (Rachel Miner) who is terrified of automobiles after a tragic accident when she was young took the lives of her parents. Penny is embarking upon a road trip with Dr. Orianna Volkes (Mimi Rogers), a psychiatrist trying to help rid Penny of her amaxophobia. During the trip, the two cross paths with a hitchhiker. This, of course, is the point in all horror films when everything goes to hell.

I'll start by saying that the hitchhiker is a very creepy character and there are scenes of great tension in the movie. I enjoyed the idea of the car, a source of terror for the character, having to serve as a refuge. The biggest flaw with the film is it's too long (92 minutes). Instead of being released as a feature film it should have been part of Showtime's ""Masters of Horror"" series. There are a few side characters introduced in the film who serve no real function but to be potential victims. They could have been cut from the film without even being missed.

I also thought the movie ended a bit suddenly. I don't need movies to be wrapped up nicely in a little bow but a person wants some sense of closure. There may be a possibility the director wants to do a sequel in the future but I wish film makers didn't approach every topic to be serialized. The director captures some great moments of tension and Rachel Miner is believable depicting her character's phobia.

All in all, I wasn't sorry picking up the DVD but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. The film would probably work better as a rental and I suggest viewing it alone late at night to heighten the mood.",1175904000,44,2466,4.7122969837587005
2729693,2,B000MEYKE6,"I was really excited when I first heard of the After Dark Horror Fest.

I saw the commercials and I immediately thought ""Wow!"" The movies were marketed as ""Too Frightening for General Audiences."" So, naturally I thought, that they were going to be Horror/Scary movies that were full of frights and edge of your seat the whole time, type films. Sadly ... Most of them were anything but. I decided not to go when Horror Fest was in town because I heard it was going to be a mad house. I'm glad I didn't pay $9 to go see every movie at the theater. Out of the five I have seen, they all remind me the B type horror movies that you see at the Rental place.

I was most disappointed in ""Penny Dreadful"" Because, it showed the most potential. The trailer looked great and I had high hopes in the film. But, it turned out to be one of the worst of the Horror Fest.

SPOILERS

First, there are a lot of stupid moments that are very impractical. I personally wouldn't have picked up the hitchhiker after I had hit him. Have they ever heard of calling for help? Like 911 perhaps. Later, on when they were in the park her cell phone didn't have service. But, surely out on the highway she could have called for help.

Also, if it were me, when Penny was having a fit after the tire was going flat. I would have gotten out of the car, thrown her butt into the passenger seat and drove as fast as I could back to the highway. Her tire could have handled that much.

Up until the last part of the movie, it wasn't actually that bad. I mean I was starting to get into it. But, then that horrendous ending. UGH. It looked like they had run out of money during the making of the film and just decided to end it out of nowhere. All that buildup and for what? ... Nothing. I mean at least do something with the ending. I won't go into further detail about the ending, so you can see for yourself.

Overall, it wasn't good, but it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen. ""Penny Dreadful"" ... has a ""Dreadful Ending""",1175817600,2,1994,4.190600522193211
2729694,4,B000MEYKE6,"Though this film is not as scary as the original ""Blair Witch Project,"" it is somewhat similar in terms of the premise. It is set exclusively in the deep woods, thus sparking the comparisons. Basically the story is about a young woman haunted by a tragic car accident from her youth, who winds up trapped in a car by a deranged psychopath. The young woman must overcome her fears and fight against the killer's ""games"" in order to survive. Rachel Miner is an underrated actress, and her skills are utilized well here; she carries the film for the most part. This is her second notable performance in a very dramatic and demanding role (""Bully"" was her best performance), so by casting a quality lead actress it adds to the film greatly. The plot and suspense is not quite on par with, say, Steven King's work, nor is it as tense throughout as ""Blair Witch."" Nevertheless, Miner's performance provides a dynamic that most horror flicks lack - a female lead with strength and survival instincts that can actually be taken seriously. I rented this based on Rachel Miner's performance in ""Bully,"" and I was not disappointed.",1175644800,22,1120,4.748717948717949
2729695,2,B000MEYKE6,"I have thoroughly enjoyed other films with limeted sets: Marcus, Lifeboat, but this one entertained at the border of nausea. Way too much time was spent with the crying, whining, mucous dripping girl in the car, withougt enough time beind spent on the killer or the other murders or victims. I know the crux of the movie raveled around the girls fear of cars, but this just only held my interest because this was the first, and likely the last time I saw this movie. I got tired of looking at Mimi Rogers dead body. Once a victim in a slasher flick has entered  the happy or unhappy hereafter, they should only enjoy a minute or so more of screentime. Every movie must carry the audiance from scene to scene, right up to the end. This one did not. When the audiance of a slasher flick starts rooting for the killer, instead of the victim, somehting is wrong with the movie. My sympathy for the victim wained slowly. This was a decent ""Movie of the Week"" for television, but when I buy a dvd, I am looking for something better.",1175385600,2,1026,4.4
2729696,4,B000MEYKE6,"Actually, I thought ""Penny Dreadful"" was the most innovative film from the After Dark Horrorfest and certainly not the worst (that would be ""The Hamiltons,"" hands down).  I went the whole route with the ""8 Films 2 Die 4,"" catching all eight films at their first showings each day, buying my tickets in advance to get the free t-shirt, and then waiting for the monster it depicted to show up in one of the films (it never happened).  In between the films while we got our free pop refills (I recommend just getting your large drink filled up halfway so you can make it all the way through the movie), we would sit around and dissect each film and make recommendations (""Audition"" was the film most mentioned).  At the end the festival my impromptu straw poll found that ""Penny Dreadful"" had as much support as any other film for the ""best of show"" title that would earn one of the eight a general release.  We thought they would go with ""Dark Ride"" as the most commercially viable of the bunch, but they ended up picking ""The Abandoned,"" which had its own uniqueness in that the heroine is a mature woman twice the age of the title character in this film.

This was the third movie on the second day and I should explain that we had a running gag going regarding the connection between women and cars established in these films.  The first day ended with ""Dark Ride,"" which involved the heroine driving a mini-van through a wall at the right time and at the right place to save the day.  The second day started with ""The Gravedancers,"" in which the same thing happened (I think it was an SUV that time).  That was followed by ""The Abandoned,"" which begins and ends with a woman driving a giant farm truck.  So by the time ""Penny Dreadful"" started we were all chuckling at the fact the characters were in such a small vehicle because it was just a standard car.

The car in question is being driven by Orianna Volker (Mimi Rogers of ""Ginger Snaps""), a psychologist who is trying to get Penny Dearborn (Rachel Miner of ""The Guiding Light"") over her phobia of cars.  We will find out via flashbacks that she was in a car accident that claimed the lives of her parents, so she has good reason to be traumatized by the experience and want to avoid driving around in a car again.  But Orianna is taking Penny on a road trip to help her get over her phobia.  Penny has to stop at every gas station along the way so she can puke up her guts and then things get worse.  When Orianna clips a pedestrian on a lonely stretch of mountain road she figures the least she can do is give the guy a ride.  The fact that his face is obscured by a hood and that he has a skewer of meat with him does not set off the alarm bells for Orianna that are telling the rest of us that this was a big mistake (have you seen the commercial where the guy picks up the hitchhiker with the ax because the guy is carrying Bud Light and claims it is just a can opener?).

Now you know full well that given this setup that Orianna is going to be dead and Penny is going to have to face the hitchhiker.  What you do not expect is that most of the film is going to take place IN that little car (do not ask how the maniac set up this scenario, just go with it).  At that point you will be thinking that there is not that much you can do given this scenario, but I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  Director Richard Brandes (""Out for Blood"") co-wrote the screenplay with Diane Doniol-Valcroze (""Kill by Inches"").  There are not a lot of horror films that come up with such a simple scenario and then stick to it (I always think of Stephen King's short story ""Survivor Type"" and novel ""Gerald's Game"" as examples of the one note take to extreme approach).  Yes, the initial requisite bad decision is compounded by a series of other fatal errors (I believe I actually said ""Drive on the rims"" out loud in the theater), but fortunately this 2006 horror film relies more on Penny's phobia and the specific situation to play out the story.

Given Penny's phobia I bet you think you know exactly how this movie has got to end, but the ending for this movie does not go for the obvious.  Again, this speaks to the determination of Brandes to go against expectations and to come up with something different.  I certainly appreciated the audacity of doing a slasher film where most of the action is set in and around a car stuck in the woods.  The net result is not a great horror film, and if your taste runs to the extreme gore of films like ""Saw III,"" ""Wolf Creek,"" ""Hostel,"" et al., then this one is going to seem dreadfully tame.  But I was pleasantly surprised and hopefully most of you who decide to check out ""Penny Dreadful"" on DVD will feel the same.",1173916800,4,4718,4.326901248581158
2729697,1,B000MEYKE6,"I saw this movie at Horrorfest and absolutely hated it. It started off boring, and just got worse. There was nothing scary about it, and the ""girl scared of cars trapped in a car"" was annoying as hell. As the other reviewer said, basically all she did was cry and not do much to help herself get out. I wondered why it took her until the end of the movie to realize, she could escape through the back window, if she only broke it. Which I don't even think she broke. If I remember correctly (because I was half out of it during the movie due to boredom) the ""angel"" of the dead chick driving the car magically took the glass out so she could get out of the car. Stupid ending. Stupid movie. I wouldn't watch it again if I was paid.",1173744000,8,731,4.118881118881119
2729698,1,B000MEYKE6,"i saw this at horrorfest. i can't tell you how bad this was from start to finish. The entire film is a ""what not to do"" for horror. Every character explicitly exercised stupid judgment. then the director decides to center the majority of the movie on a really annoying lead character who does nothing but cry for 90 minutes on camera. every kill in this film came from sheer stupidity. most just waltzed in ready for death (oh yeah, really boring death at that). by 10 minutes into this film, you care about no one and prefer everyone die fast so you can move on with your life and forget this event.

save your money kids, this one's worst than the dumbest b movie ever made.

2729708,1,B000MEYKE6,"I must say I did not exactly hate it, in terms of the one star I am giving. I thought it was one of the stupidest films I've ever watched.  If this is someone's idea of horror, it falls so far short of the line, it was almost amusing.  To explain, first off the story makes absolutely no sense at all.  Even if you accept the premise of a ""therapist"" who, in order to help her client breakthrough her fear of being in a car (?) after she's suffered a traumatic accident in which her parents are killed, is ludicrous.  NO therapist worth their professional license is going to take a client on a growth journey, unless her offset goal is to spend some quality time in a state correctional facility, for abuse of power.  Logic there is because the therapist would be demonstrating poor judgement by exposing the client to unknown risks.  It isn't done.  To think that it would be a rational treatment is beyond stupid. Actually, it is only something an inexperienced screenwriter would think of as a story. Duh.  This story is so lame, I think its been done to death over the years of cinema.  It used to be told around campfires, the mysterious hitchhiker with murder on his mind...ooooh, I'm scared.  Along with that obvious ploy comes the other plot fail, that of being trapped somewhere off the grid, no cell phones, no help, and being stalked by same hitchhiker who manages to surprise, overwhelm and then kill all sorts of add on victims, all done in a murderous rage by (X).  Cannot say, that would be a spoiler alert.  Essentially, folks get killed, the primary victim, Penney, practically screams herself to death, after trying to break a car windshield with, of all tools, an umbrella.  Now to me, that play takes all the spice out of this story.  You just know it's going to end badly......but WAIT!  At the last minute, help arrives suddenly and Penney begins to feel safe,  having escaped and killed her stalker. Until, the very worst thing that could happen, does.....just for a second-and the film ends. Supposedly in a suspenseful and horrific manner.  No way.  From the cover, it would appear that Penny Dreadful is a morality tale from the 19th Century for showing a prim stiffly collared man and woman, dressed in clothes of the era. There were actually short stories written on cheap paper, which sold for (you guessed it) a penny.  People would buy these news sheets for entertainment, and for shock value. Remember, no TV, no cable, no movies.  A ""penny dreadful"" allowed people some shocking and titillating reading material, not the prudish and norm for the times.  Stories like this one have been around forever. The only things that would change is in the details, such as place, type of death, perp: prisoner who escaped, a mental patient, a pirate, a dashing knave, etc.  People are always going to seek out villians in all walks of society.  Mostly, the penny dreadful type of material was just past the norm of polite society. These things used to be called risque. Now, today-little has changed in the horror genre, except maybe the tales would have examples of modern society, for instance, a cell phone without service, a car tire without a jack or spare. Any method to move the victim and perp towards, rather than away, from any help or escape.  I just couldn't forget that when I first heard this story of the hooded stranger who was stalking his/her victims, I was 12 years old and sitting around a campfire, telling ghost and spook stories.  These types of stories are supposed to make us afraid of the dark.  But IMO, they've all been used so often, there isn't any thrill left to write about.
This film is no different than those old spooky stories about finding a hook outside a car parked on lovers lane. Or the ghost who walks at night, rattling chains so the living cannot find rest until the spirit is laid to rest. Hogwash.
I like a good horror or spook story just like others, they give us the sensation of fear without the risk of actual harm.  We can scare ourselves silly, it seems.
But this time?  Oh hell-0, no!  Didn't even come close. Parts were actually funny, if they weren't so desperate to continue the horror.  This is a horror series without the horror.  Glad it's streaming on showtime, with a free trial.  Otherwise, I can get more horrified cleaning out my refrigerator!  NOW, that's some serious s***e which is to be feared.  This stuff? Child's play. Save yourself the time. There are better horror stories out there.",1454716800,2,4480,4.629113924050633

Okay, folks, let's talk horror movies on Amazon Prime. Generally not too good, am I right? Can I get a witness? But you know what? You stick with it because of movies like Penny Dreadful.
The movie starts in a spooky gas station in the middle of nowhere. There's a small and noble lineage of great horror movies that begin this way, but there's a vast rung in cinema hell for the many crappy ones that do as well. But the attendant at this gas station is...wait for it...Michael Berryman of The Hills Have Eyes, the pinnacle of Spooky Gas Station movies. This suggests that director Richard Brandes and his writing team are conscious of what makes a great horror film, and the rest of the film bears that out. The situation of a horror movie that mostly takes place in a stationary car actually seems quite fresh to me, but the movie isn't trying to impress you with clever gimmicks, but really use all the expressionistic tools of horror movies to dig into the mind of its main character, Penny Deerborn (Rachel Miner from Tooth and Nail), who passes through an intense emotional spectrum as her spirit evolves from bare panic (the film begins with her hyperventilating) to a determined will to survive. Miner is an excellent actor and basically carries the film, but with great assists from Mimi Rogers (!) as unorthodox therapist Orianna Volkes (!!) and a great set piece about backwoods adultery. The only thing that disappointed me was the very ending, which I thought hit a bit of a flat note. But this movie deserves to be seen a lot!",1422662400,,1558,4.628158844765343

First off the opening credits usally set the tone for horrors so the unnecessary CGI credits kind of threw me off a bit as they where a little cartoonish. The actress that plays Penny is totally out matched by the other actors and actresses in the movie, making a bad performance more apparent. Throughout the film there are many scenes that are gainy for no other reason than the director's choice not to reshoot and it is a distraction while viewing. Unfortunately I watched the film to the end; or lack of an end rather, and it was a real disappointment as there was no resolution.

2729771,1,B000MEYKE6,"Rarely have I come across a movie whose title is so apt.  Had I not watched this via Amazon Prime, I would have been returning the movie immediately.
  PD follows the story of young girl who took a joy ride in Christine with her mom and dad, and now suffers from crippling trauma because she watched her parents die in front of her eyes.  Years on, she's making the journey again - because the first go-round was so jolly - driven by the world's worst therapist.  You know how the stereotypical Horror movie has you calling out advice to the characters (like, ""stop being such morons!"")?  Well, in this movie, you'll be yelling advice at the therapist if you're anything like me; probably telling her to stop being such rubbish.  At any rate, the travelling duo manage to hit and pick up Hannibal Lecter (not really)  who's hungry and eats the therapist (I wish), and decides to do what any rational serial killer would do: find four conveniently placed trees, and trap  Ms. Damaged-Goods between them in the car.  What follows is an emotionally draining experience, as you lose all sense of connection with the ineffective twit.
  I know that the whole point of this exercise is to trap the girl in her worst nightmare and watch what happens; but honestly, the magnifier-to-an-anthill method of plot development only works if you feel some sort of vestment in the ants' survival - and you won't.  Perhaps it's the inept script; or maybe the simple fact that this girl seems to have the self-preservation instincts of a lemming; but any sympathies you may have had going in will swiftly vanish.
  There are more characters introdced - they're even worse than the first, if you can believe that - but I don't know much about their intended roles because I stopped watching due to something else coming up - for which I was ever so thankful.  And I think that tells you everything you need to know in that one sentiment: I was pleased to be pulled away fron a movie.

Ah the After Dark Horrorfest what a great idea for horror fans and filmmakers. It gives us all a chance to see some new films. Also helps filmmakers get their movies released so it is a great idea. When the first batch was released this was one of the films included in that first eight. When this first was released I was interested in this one because of the story laid out on the back of the box.

Penny Deerborn [Rachel Miner] is a young woman that is terrified of cars, why one would ask? Well that is because when she was a little girl she was involved in a car accident that took both of her parents lives. She has sense tried to get help and help has come in the form of Dr. Orianna Volkes [Mimi Rogers]. They are taking a road trip together in the hopes that she will overcome her fear.

While on the road they come across a hitchhiker whom they hit, in doing so after seeing that the person is alright they offer said person a ride. The hitchhiker is a very quite one and after being dropped off ruins their tire. After realizing this the good Doctor goes off to try and find phone reception some where. Things get worse as she does not return and Penny must hide inside the thing she is terrified off as the hitchhiker torments her from the outside.

This film is actually a pretty enjoyable little tale and it is cool she must hide out in the car. The film is a tense one but not overly scary although the idea sure is. The performances here are good and believable. The hitchhiker is scary enough and the situation makes for an entertaining film. The best thing about this film is that it is more of a psychological horror film. Penny is terrorized while trapped in the car, hence what she feared now is keeping her safe, some therapy.

The writers and director did a good job here with this film. I wouldn't say it is a classic but that depends on taste. It is definitely a good horror flick for a nice dark night at home on the coach. While not my favorite form the first string of the ""8 films to die for"" it is one of the better ones. I say give it a shot because it just might be for you.",1322265600,2,2122,4.178484107579462
2729792,3,B000MEYKE6,"Putting the word ""dreadful"" in your title is really just asking for trouble, while this film's title as a whole carries with it the connotation of cheap, dragged out thrills.  Fortunately, this film rises above those potential handicaps and - notwithstanding an overreliance on clich&eacute; and a truly disappointing ending - strings several good scenes together into a somewhat effective dark thriller.  It's still far too predictable in parts to truly impress, but it's not a bad way to spend ninety minutes if you're the kind of person who enjoys watching someone put through the physical and emotional ringer - and, yes, I am that type of person.  I didn't hold out a lot of hope early on, as the main character was as annoying as she was sympathetic, but Rachel Miner's performance got better and better as the story progressed - under conditions that were by no means easy.

The success or failure of this film depended solely on Miner's performance, as the plot is pretty straightforward.  Our young Penny is trying to conquer her terrible fear of automobiles.  It sounds silly on the face of it, but Penny's fear was borne in the wake of an automobile accident that injured her and killed her parents when she was only a child.  Her therapist, Orianna Volkes (Mimi Rogers), puts her ""Full Circle"" technique to work by driving the terrified young lady back to the spot where the tragic accident occurred - in the densely wooded mountains, at night, with a snowstorm on the way.  It doesn't sound like a good idea to me to begin with, but things go from bad to worse when Orianna hits a hitchhiker in the middle of the road.  Nothing good could possibly come from that.

The majority of the film takes place inside of the car, where Penny finds herself trapped alongside a most uncommunicative companion and mentally - and, in time physically - tortured by a homicidal maniac.  With the car wedged in between several trees, Penny is pretty much helpless - not to mention terrified.  Frankly, I can't blame her as she keeps popping the sedatives she brought along on this little adventure.  Those pills are really a key ingredient to the plot, making the viewer question how much of the story is real.  It opens up all kinds of possibilities, few of which, I'm sad to say, the filmmaker chose to exploit.  In fact, the decision to include several outside characters works directly against the true potential of the otherwise tense storyline.  Had director Richard Brandes focused exclusively on Penny and her predicament, I think this would have been a much stronger film.",1301184000,,2578,4.785553047404063

2729795,3,B000MEYKE6,"Like one review said, the movie's biggest fault is that it's too long & there's some characters that could have been cut (pun intended) from the movie.

The premise of the movie is an interesting one- you have the main character Penny who is traveling into the mountains with her psychiatrist Orianna as part of a therapy session. You see, Penny's parents died in a horrible car accident & as a result she's incapable of getting into a car without having a panic attack with fits of nausea. Unfortunately for them they ran into a hitchhiker who has his/her (never quite clear on the gender) own idea of a good time. As in cutting people open for fun.

This really wasn't my type of horror movie but I decided to give it a try based on the premise & the title. (I've always loved the term 'Penny Dreadful'.) While the movie is overly long & could have been better served as an hour long production, it's still a pretty good slasher flick. There's some interesting imagery in the film for those who are looking for a little hidden depth to their horror films. (You can equate Penny's climb out of the car as akin to her climbing out of a womb, showing that she's not afraid of cars anymore. Before that point she was only going to hide in the car.)

(Caution, some spoilers ahead!)

I couldn't help but feel a little bit disappointed overall, though. There was the potential for a twist in the movie, a twist that never really came.  At one point I almost thought that the hitchhiker was actually Penny herself & that she had killed everyone in a state of delirium after having snapped from revisiting the mountains where her parents died. (The hitchhiker representing her autophobia.) I also imagined that there could be a possibility that there was someone else in the car with Penny & her parents before the crash & that the hitchhiker was actually her long lost brother that she'd suppressed memories of. (Like for instance he could have been ejected from the car where no one found him & he grew up living in the wild. Then he chose to take revenge on Penny when he read her dossier in the car b/c he viewed her as forgetting him.) None of these twists ever came however & the film ends with the stereotypical ""bad guy might get up to kill again"" finale.

Still, for fans of the slasher genre this will be a nice flick. Worth owning? Dunno- it was interesting to watch once, but that really seemed to be enough for me. There really wasn't anything extraordinary about the film that seemed to stand out. The main actress was amazing in this role, especially considering that she literally carried the bulk of the film. Then again, I'm not the target audience so it may appeal to slasher fans. I'd recommend renting it before you buy, though.",1234137600,2,2743,4.509054325955734

2729797,4,B000MEYKE6,"At a time like today when all horror films go special effects OR extreme violence, it is good to see one film that reminds us of the good old days when horror and thriller used to be the genres for the most creative people.

So here it is: a girl who lost her parents in a freak accident (and developed a phobia of cars as a result) is riding with her psychiatrist to the place where the accident happened. On their way, they encounter a killer who locks the girl inside the car with the body of the dead psychiatrist. The killer has blocked all doors and will kill anyone who comes near the car.

Nearly all the action takes place inside the car while the girl struggles to stay alive and not go crazy. And this is interesting because this is the kind of film that reminds us of similar (and successful) other the challenge of writing and shooting for closed sets. Some examples come to my mind:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rope/dp/B000ECX0O2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rope</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lifeboat-Special-Edition/dp/B000A9QK7I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lifeboat (Special Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cujo-25th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B000T5O48U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cujo (25th Anniversary Edition)</a>&nbsp;(also set inside a car) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fail-safe-Special-Edition/dp/B00004XPPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fail-safe (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;are just a few examples of the best films who took on the challenge.

Of course this film is a much more modest entry. But successful in its own way. The acting is good, the cinematography and camera work are fine... but the only weaker part is the screenplay that does not deliver all the possibilities of the premise. And there are one or two plot holes
here and there... well... if the girl really wants to leave the car  (that's what it seems for quite some time) but the doors are blocked, why not break the windshield? It's glass, not bricks.

Instead of concentrating on the drama, it is clear that the film makers had to compromise and go for the slasher genre the audience loves. It's understandable.

Still it's a very good film. some people found it boring because, really, this is not the type of film we see today. There are no heads exploding, no cheap scares nor people being being sawed with weird appliances or other cutting paraphernalia: it's just a girl in a car with a killer outside.

Each movie has a trailer of the other seven.  I liked Unrest and the trailers for the other 7 looked good as well, though I decided not to buy Reincarnation because I don't like Japanese horror and I didn't buy The Hamiltons because the trailer just didn't 'grab' me.

When I got Penny Dreadful in I knew I'd like it, the trailer made it look very good.  I just watched it for the 3rd time last night, as a matter of fact.

The storyline was nicely tied together, and though it was pretty formula, you know, escaped mental patient slicing people up in a wooded area, the fact they filmed the most of this movie from the perspective of a girl trapped in a car was pretty cool.  I mean, what could they make happen if she's trapped in the car?  LOTS, and for the first time in a long time, I was creeped out by a movie I was watching, it's just that good.  They used the usual gratuitous buckets of blood along the way, lots of slice and dice, but overall it was better done and a heck of a lot creepier than most that have come down the pipe lately.

2729815,1,B000MEYKE6,"Penny Dreadful (Richard Brandes, 2006)

Another of those movies that someone seems to have messed up when distributing; I caught this on the Sci-Fi Channel, but it really seems to have a future on the Lifetime Movie Network. Consider: a higher-quality cast than the usual Sci-Fi Channel shocker (the two main characters are played by Californication's Rachel Miner and Lifetime Movie stalwart Mimi Rogers [Stone Cold, The Stranger Game, et al.]), a woman-in-danger-working-out-a-phobia plot, and, really, not much in the way of shocks at all.

The story: Penny, a woman who's scared of cars (Miner), and her therapist Orianna (Rogers) are on a trip to the mountains so Penny can confront her fear of cars. Along the way, while Orianna is distracted, she hits a hitchhiker on the road. (While we never actually see the person hitchhiking, Penny refers to the person as ""the hitchhiker"" thereafter, so I'm assuming.) To atone for this, Orianna gives said hitchhiker a ride out to a desolate mountain camp. On their way back to the highway, Penny has an episode and has to get out of the car; when she does, she discovers the hitchhiker has pierced one of the back tores with a meat skewer. Thus begins a cat-and-mouse game between the women and the hitchhiker, whom, we soon find out, is not averse to a bit of the old ultra-violence on anyone who gets in the way of the fun little game being played with Penny's psyche.

Brandes, writer of such direct-to-video fare as Martial Law (and its sequel) and Devil in the Flesh (and its sequel), makes the usual mistake one makes with movies such as this: there's nothing at all surprising in it. When minor characters are introduced, they immediately engage in the kind of behavior that stamps ""kill me"" on their foreheads (for a rundown of the behaviors that do this in horror films, cf. Wes Craven's Scream). Penny always runs into a seriously traumatic situation at the worst possible time, therefore advancing the plot. Without spoiling anything (I hope), the final scene is exactly the sort of thing one expects from a horror movie since the fifties or thereabouts. Worst of all, much of the film features Rachel Miner pulling her best Tom Hanks impression (think Cast Away here, not Forrest Gump) while combining it with her best Linnea Quigley impression (do I have to name a movie? Think ""scream queen"" here). And while Cast Away was at its heart about THaHAtA (Tom Hanks and His Ability to Act), Tom Hanks actually does have some pretty serious chops, as much as I hated Cast Away. RMaHAtA does not make nearly as gripping a film, when most of the acting Miner has to do involves screaming and the occasional bout of hyperventilation. That gal knows how to gobble a pill, however!

gravedancers
penny dreadful
unrest
captivity (i guess it counts)
wicked little things",1199318400,3,385,4.594202898550725

2729819,1,B000MEYKE6,"I started watching this movie with high hopes.  Having already seen 3 other After Dark Films, Dark Ride, The Hamiltons, and Gravedancers, with Dark Ride being my favorite, Penny Dreaful looked very promising from the trailer that was included in these other films.  I was wrong.  The movie started out good, very creepy with the hitchhiker and being trapped in the woods.  Once she becomes trapped in the car, you may as well stop the film.  The car is somehow wedged between two trees for the rest of the movie, which leaves the large question as to how it fit in the first place and also, why won't the windows shatter once she strikes them with an umbrella. I can't figure out for the rest of the movie if she is losing it because of her meds, or what is really going on.  Bottom line, this movie was ridiculous and wasted an hour and 30 minutes of my time.",1190419200,2,860,4.377358490566038
2729820,4,B000MEYKE6,"One of the things I've really enjoyed so far about the After Dark Horrorfest films is their refreshing take on popular horror concepts. Penny Dreadful provides a fresh take on slasher films. In fact, I rather hate calling it a slasher but that's ultimately where it will be lumped. What Penny Dreadful really is, is a psychological horror and a powerful one at that. Not for those who are claustrophobic for sure!

The film stars Rachel Miner, best known for her riveting performance in ""Bully"" as Penny Deerborn, a young woman whose deep rooted fears have virtually handicapped her life after she was traumatized by an auto accident which killed both of her parents. Penny's fears seem to be many but start with a fear of cars. She is traveling with her Psychologist Orianna (played by Mimi Rogers) to the scene of the accident to confront her fears.

Along the way they hit a person hitchhiking along a dark stretch of road. Seeing that the person is ok, they offer the mysterious hitchhiker a ride to a nearby campground (ha ha ha) and by now the silent passenger has even creeped out the Doctor and she's anxious to be rid of their rider as soon as possible. You can probably guess the hitchhiker turns out to be a crazed killer but that might be the last thing that is stereotypical about Penny Dreadful. Unlike so many other recent horror slashers, Penny Dreadful doesn't seek to amaze viewers with creative new ways to kill, nor is it all that gory. Rather, this is a study in terror.

The killer eventually traps Penny in the car, wedging it between two large trees so she cannot open the doors. The bulk of the picture is spent within the dark, frigid confines of the car as the killer merely toys with Penny, making her witness to several murders, and delighting in her fear and helplessness. With so much of the film taking place in one static location, it does tend to slow things down quite a bit and those who crave action and a high body count may be disappointed.

But it is this fact that sets Penny Dreadful apart from other recent films such as the under whelming remake of Black Christmas. There are seemingly no connections here between killer and victim. No acts of revenge for what happened to the killer as a little kid. No misguided, moralistic reasons for killing like in the ""Saw"" film series. In fact, this is truly more terrifying because the psycho in Penny Dreadful is the very definition of a random killer.

Perhaps not for everyone's tasted but a solid, subtle horror-thriller, deftly directed by Richard Brandes. Look for horror icon Michael Berryman in a cameo role.

2729821,3,B000MEYKE6,"I've only seen three of these After Dark Horror Fest films but I'll have to say that so far ""Penny Dreadful"" is definitely the more satisfying of the bunch. ""Unrest"" was a flop and ""Gravedancers"" was 5 minutes away from being a masterpiece and then they screwed it up with the CGI ending, but this one started, progressed and ended on a good healthy balanced note. It has some dry moments and like most decent horror films a couple of illogical happenings but other than that it's a solid creepy little film with some very good acting worthy of any horror fans collection.",1188777600,5,572,4.563106796116505
2729822,4,B000MEYKE6,"I enjoyed this film.  It started out kind of slow and continues to progress slowly.  Some things that happened were not explained, but lets face it, most people in Penny's situation would have been totally freaked out by the circumstances.  I know I would have been.  I'd have been crying like a little girl.  The movie took its time building the suspense so if you don't have the patience to stick it out, don't watch it.  There is not a lot of action in this movie.  Some blood.  Some thrills.  The ending was kind of weak but, all in all, not a bad movie.  Rachel Miner did a good job.  Also, you have to love Mickey Jones.  Still the same guy after what?  30 or 40 years in the business?  I've seen 7 of the 8 movies to die for now.  I still put Gravedancers as the best, Unrest second, Maybe Penny Dreadful 3rd and Dark Ride 4th.  The other ones I was not too crazy about.",1186876800,2,877,4.161676646706587
2729823,3,B000MEYKE6,"After two failed attempts at a good After Dark film I tried Penny Dreadful.  I have to say this one wasn't nearly as bad as the other two I checked out.
This one follows a girl named Penny and her shrink as they try to get her over her fear of cars.  So of course when you are scared of cars what do you do? You plow down someone on a dark creepy road then offer to give them a lift.  It gave you a little insight that it is never safe to pick up someone, even if you run them over.
This one may be worth checking out as long as you don't go into it with high expectations.",1184284800,,573,3.7583333333333333
2729824,1,B000MEYKE6,"I went into this movie with high hopes. I too have a bit of a car phobia (though nothing like this girl, Penny) so I thought hey that's an interesting premise...and it would have been if the main charachter Penny had been the least bit likable. She cried, moaned, cringed and did basically nothing...the few things she did do were so feeble/feeble minded that I kept hoping she would find herself severed in half or something. The movie reminded me a bit of the movie with tom hanks stranded on a deserted island, with only wilson as her friend. Mimi Rogers plays, for the majority of the movie, a corpse. Great use of talent there. I have watched 4 of the horrorfest movies so far and this is the only one that truly disappointed me. I really wanted to like it, but it was basically unredeemable. The whole premise is ludicrous...absolute crap.",1182902400,2,845,4.565789473684211
2729825,2,B000MEYKE6,"Courtney Solomon, director of the HorrorFest, said that the event was put together hastily in 3 months, which may excuse mildly the general quality of these films--unfortunately, Solomon threw in a suggestion that he will have a full year for the next one (plug, plug).  Even though I still insist that I am going to get through the full 8 out of DVD, having missed the theatrical runs of these movies, I must admit that I'm not looking forward to the rest so much.  The main benefit so far has been that most of these flicks have run around 90 minutes, so the effort hasn't been too much of a commitment of my time.

But I love horror movies, so I continue to have some hope.

My main disappointment with this series so far is what this film holds in spades--many of these horror films have absolutely hackneyed and cliche moves of horror movies, but really do nothing to show any awareness of this triteness.  Am I expecting every horror film made nowadays to be like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scream/dp/630521610X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scream</a>, where the elements of horror movies are actually discussed in the plot?  Certainly not.  Even that movie played out that element to redundant extremes.

But I can hope that modern horror movies can at least work under the paradigm that there are other horror movies in the world and don't expect an audience to be so ignorant that the same-ol' same-ol' will work each and every time.

In other words...I want originality.  At least a little.

But this film disappoints in many ways, most of all in that it may have had an actual germ of an interesting movie, which got bastardized into trite junk.

The plot is simple--Penny was traumatized from a car accident in her youth, and with the help with her therapist (Mimi Rogers, who I think did some of her best durn stuff in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ginger-Snaps/dp/B0000A1HSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ginger Snaps</a>), is trying to overcome her fear of automobiles by riding to the place where her traumatizing accident took place.

Now what?  A mysterious stranger?  Penny forced to face her fears while fending off a mysterious killer?  You bet.  Even spot appearances by Michael Berryman (the representative face of the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hills-Have-Eyes/dp/B00009V7QM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hills Have Eyes</a>) and Mickey Jones, who has made a career out of playing rednecks and bikers, can't help this plot full of false jumps and ludicrous scenarios, with a killer who can evidently move cars but doesn't know how to get through vinyl seat covers.  Even the changing of the minute on a digital clock earns a haunting 'dong' from the cheap soundtrack.  Suggestions of Penny starving are a little thin, considering that her whole ordeal occurs in the course of one night (one night where the moon goes through three different phases, evidently), and her fear of not knowing how to operate a car later miraculously disappears when she knows exactly what to do to move the car from between two trees.

The potential this movie had was to play a card like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Open-Water/dp/B000PUYI62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Open Water</a>--Penny could be stuck in the woods in the car with her dead therapist without the whole nonsense of a mad killer, and the fear and creepiness would have become much more palpable and as a result a lot more interesting.

But no.  A lot of flash, and little to actually watch for.  That has been the nature of the HorrorFest so far, unfortuantely.",1182384000,6,3728,5.434027777777778

2729827,2,B000MEYKE6,"That is the tagline for this better-than-average genre movie.  Rachel Miner plays Penny Deerborn who, after witnessing both parents die in a horrible car accident, takes a trip with her psychoanalyst, Dr. Orianna Volkes, (played by Mimi Rogers) to Big Bear to overcome her deep-bred fear of automobiles.  The name for that ""phobia"" escapes me, but it is a more common phobia than is ever talked about.  Penny cannot stand cars:  she does not want to ride in them and she certainly does not want to ride in them for any length of time.

On their way to their destination, the good doctor demonstrates she's not the best driver in the world when she just about runs over a rather ominous hitchhiker.  In lieu of a huge lawsuit (and this is about the only reasoning I can think of for this pattern of movie logic), the good doctor then decides to give their victim, er, hitcher a ride to Camp-Way-Out-In-the-Woods-Where-Nobody-Would-Ever-Visit-and-Has-Been-Closed-for-the-Past-Two-Months.  If that isn't bad enough, the hitcher then offers them a bit of human shishkebob--and no one bats an eye.  In fact, Penny feels the need to ""open up,"" so she proceeds to tell the stranger all about her phobia.  Big mistake.

I'll stop there because I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone who might want to purchase or rent it for their viewing pleasure.  The look of the movie is great; not only did I get cold while watching, but there were many times when I had to ""remember to breathe.""  Rachel Miner does a good job at displaying her phobia, as well as another one who many of us have:  claustrophobia.  There are times while she was in that car that I literally had to set up in bed and get my breath.  Mimi Rogers does a great job of playing a corpse.  Liz Davies plays the hitchhiker with great panache; however, her voice sounded very masculine so I was fooled when I found out the killer was female.

**SPOILER ALERT**  Why such a low rating frome me?  First of all, I keep rating these movies (and CDs) low in hopes that Amazon will re-think their ratings and start assigning ""1/2""-stars.  I would have given this movie 2-1/2 stars.  It was better than a ""2;"" not as good as a ""3.""  What bothered me most about this movie was there was no payoff.  If I have to sit through 92 minutes of ANY scary movie listening to some person--male or female--snort, snot, and cry for the majority of that movie, then I expect a payoff; and, NO, it doesn't always have to be boilerplate payoff.  Growing up around women who would have kicked the protagonist's butt pretty quickly, I had trouble in really feeling for the victim.  I just wanted to scream, ""Grow yourself a sac and do SOMETHING.""  For this movie to wear me out the way it did, the ending was a complete let down.

The movie was directed by Richard Brandes, who also helped on the screenplay.  It is rated R for some gore (nothing over-the-top) and for one really lame excuse for a love scene.  Run time is 92 minutes.",1180483200,2,2967,4.566287878787879
2729828,5,B000MEYKE6,"This movie certainly stands out in many areas. Primarily in claustraphobia. The scenes where Penny is a captive in the car comprise a good bit of the film.

The horror here is not supernatural... it is real. This movie held my attention very well. It is part slasher/part true horror.

The slasher on the loose is only revealed as an escapee from a mental institution... a theme done many times over. However, it is the unfolding of the story that takes this to a new level.

Penny is trapped inside a car, which she dreads, with the corpse of her psychiatrist and a murderer who lets her know he's watching her every move. He continues to murder and loads the bodies onto the car with Penny and the corpse inside. Penny, who had a horrible car wreck experience as a child, tries to escape numerous times only to fail.

This movie is actually quite the gem. If you like tense, gritty, claustraphobic scare treats then this is for you. Turn out the lights, lock the door and make some popcorn. Once the story gets rolling you'll be glued to the screen.",1179705600,24,1051,4.486910994764398

I have been a hardcore horror fan since five almost 30 years of seeng horror films so I like some of the ones that may not be classics. What I liked about this one was the strong acting performance by Rachel Miner. Acting in a horror film is a very difficult thing to really capture a convincing terrified and traumatized person. Miner was a great actress and she has her hands film to carry this film with some things working against her.

  Mimi Rogers gives a credible performance but the film rests on Miner's shoulders. The Hitchhiker does a great job being scary and using his body. We forget about acting it's not all about your lines but how you use all your tools. Liz Davies as The Hitchhiker was great. She was scary and creepy as hell. This film is a little slow and it's not action packed. It doesn't try to be something is not. The run time of the film is right so in the end it plays out fine.

  I liked the ending for me it was a strong point of the film and how horror films sometimes need to end. I don't think this one will be everyone's cup of tea but I really like and think it's worth a watch. I don't know what Miner is doing these days but she certainly will be able to find work in horror.
