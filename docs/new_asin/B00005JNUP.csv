7941190,3,B00005JNUP,"The DVD is a single layer recordable dvd.
Face of DVD is printed with title and image.
No mention of copyright anywhere on the disk or label. Maybe it's not copyrighted anymore being from 1936.

Label looks like laser printed, not offset printing.
UPC barcode matches movie.
disc case was shrink-wrapped.

No menus whatsoever.
Subtitles are in English and burned in (not selectable)

Transfer is probably OK, considering it's a 1936 movie.
Audio sounds a little muffled and is sometimes hard to understand even for a French native speaker.

Please read the other reviews for actual movie that i have not watched yet.",1516752000,2,616,4.951456310679611

7941194,4,B00005JNUP,I wish Criterion would pick this up and restore the film. It is a consummate Renior story that displays early on his unique gifts as a film maker.,1354320000,5,146,4.25

7941196,3,B00005JNUP,"Made in  1936, this movie is neither a great work, or the work of a great director. The film itself is dated, frivolous, and as dreadfully sentimental as any of the stuff coming out of Hollywood at that time. As for the director, I have always considered Jean Renoir to be the most critically over-rated director in the history of French cinema. Had he been born into the world with another surname, I suspect that we would have heard a good deal less about him. Family connections seem to work in the Arts world as potently as in the world of politics. Enough of that.  Let us focus on the film. It concerns the exploitation of a bunch of losers by an unscrupulous con artist ( brilliantly played by Jules Berry) who disappears following a serious train crash and is presumed dead, just as his creditors were about to belatedly take the legal actions necessary to put him behind bars. As in all his previous malfeasances, his escape was initially aided by all those he had fleeced, extorted, raped and otherwise oppressed. His employees, unpaid for months and without any other job prospects, decide to take over his defunct publishing business ----already in debt to creditors to the tune of half a million ----and actually make a success of the enterprise, at which point he reappears to reclaim the now debt-free business as his own. This so enrages the nearest we have to a hero ( a soppy writer of American Western adventure stories that have been the foundation of the company's success ) that he shoots him dead, and then makes a run for the frontier with his blond moll in a desperate bid to escape arrest.
Having seen and heard what Jacques Prevert, the distinguished poet and script writer could do in LES ENFANTS DU PARADIS, I had high hopes. After all, in the latter, he provided Marcel Carne with a set of fascinating, credible and exciting characters  who engage us with their problems and personalities as well as with the brilliant dialogue that Prevert puts in their mouths. Here, the dialogue is as frothy and inane as the characters are inept. They are irritating to the point where one would like to line them up and give them a good kick in the behind. Renoir's reputation for great artistic compassion and humanity seems to rest on his sympathetic treatment of those who are too stupid or too venal to merit sympathy. The same tendencies leading to slapstick farce are very evident in Les Regles du Jeux, especially in the post-hunt party episodes, where, as here, they debase what could have been the serious, cynical or satirical treatment of serious questions. But Renoir's concept of comedy is regrettably, the glorification of stupidity rather than its condemnation. Berry's villain  is the single person with a modicum of intelligence that you will meet in the entire 90-minutes of this film. Renoir does share one feature with his ""hero"": in their respective careers, they both got away with murder. For the record, in my opinion, Jean Renoir did make an outstanding film in LA GRANDE ILLUSION, but only one. After all, he did make forty!",1335916800,5,3068,4.739700374531835
7941197,5,B00005JNUP,"Here's the story of ""Arizona Jim""-- well, maybe not, but the young French author of the very popular cowboy stories is our hero, and we find out if he can live up to the heroics of his dime-novel creation.  This light-as-air masterpiece from Renoir needs to be given the full Criterion treatment-- it's an equal to ""The Grand Illusion"" and ""Rules of the Game"" and Clair's ""Le Million,"" starring the same actor.  All lovers of film will enjoy it.",1127347200,7,445,4.620253164556962
7941198,5,B00005JNUP,"Monsieur Lange is a simple story. It deals with an execrable human being who maintains a negative tension state around an office, until the walls of the human patience finally fall down with the expected consequences.

Fiction and reality will be narrowly bounded in this original script which concerns with the honor and self steem of all human being under determined conditions. Exquisite and ravishing movie that deserves to be considered among the most representative isues of this overwhelming French director.

Go for this , you will enjoy the whole script and besides the admirable technique of Renoir style.

Besides, (if any shadow of doubt it could exist about the grandness of Jean Renoir and his huge influence over so many major and minor future directors) you must always remember and not forget that Toni, a lost film from 1934 is the first issue of this movement named Neo Realism, mistakenly applied to Roselini and De Sica. This film was the first one and somehow the real Godafther of the later movement!
