7955418,1,B00005UW7Y,"The Operator according to IMDB came out in 2000, but the technology such as phones used by characters and computers looks like it's from the early 80's at the latest.  Well apart from the overthetop eavesdropping technology, a what is the number for this person in a city phone operator apparently has at her disposal able to listen in to any landline, mobile, ATM or any other machine that's sitting in a room. I'm guessing this was a made for TV movie, although it's quality seems below what those movie TV channels can produce. But it does follow their formula of having a well known face in a minor role in the movie to promote it.  In The Operator's case that's Christa Miller (The Drew Carey Show, and after this aired Scrubs, Cougar Town). She only has a couple of scenes, about seven or eight minutes of screen time all up. The final scenes of the film also have the old lady Jerry stole the marble rye from on Seinfeld.  But other than that, I don't recognise any of the other supporting or main actors from this from anything made before or since. .

The main character Gary, is a married (to Miller) lawyer who is also a bedroom player. The film starts with him getting caught in bed with a blonde woman (possibly the one on the DVD cover, if it's not, that chick's not in the movie at all), by a shotgun toting husband.  His car windows are blown out and he runs away naked through the streets.  This is easily the most entertaining part of the film.  The lawyer is the type who can walk by a much younger female work colleague and say ""dinner tonight"" and she'll readily agree smiling to herself with a smug look on her face while the attractive girl sitting beside her looks on disappointed she wasn't chosen, but you know will say yes when asked tomorrow.  That's one of the misses of the film, I didn't buy that at all. Gary's not hideous, but he's not exactly an attractive guy either, he doesn't really ooze irresistible to women for the viewer. He's a lawyer and probably makes good money, so the fact Miller's character married him is maybe plausible, but not the fact all these other women are throwing themselves at him.  Anyway, while trying to talk to some guy in another city with the help of directory assistance, he becomes more and more annoyed each time he dials the number given by an operator and it is the wrong number.  So he loses his temper at the latest one when he tries for the third or fourth time.  Although his abuse is pretty mild, somehow the operator (just an Asian voice who we never see, other than her eyes at times) is so angered by being told off, that she makes Gary her enemy.  She is determined to ruin his life.

Now this is a pretty cool plot for a movie you're thinking, but it's been done countless times before, and I can't think of one movie where it wasn't done better.  Regardless anyway, this part of the plot doesn't last long, I'm not sure if the same actor was cast to be in a different TV movie and they just combined the two at the end, but it ends up becoming a preachy religious movie with our main character who now drives a car without a door, who visits an African American church in session, with a pastor that he rejected from jury duty earlier in the film because his client wanted to be judged by his peers (ie only white guys).  Gary (played by an actor called Michael Laurence by the way) totally overacts worse than someone on a radio commercial and blubbers his reacquaintance with the pastor.  They take a walk and for some reason the pastor supposedly telling a joke tells the worn out tale of a guy needing to be rescued who turns away rescuer, after rescuer , because he's a regular churchgoer and God will save him. I don't know what this had to do with anything to do with the rest of the film but we're there bored the whole time.  Then it becomes a I'm going to betray my client, who we'd learnt very little about before this in the movie other than knowing he's a racist.  Oh and there's some weird hit man kill some old guy's mum payment thing going on that, who knows why it's in the film. Then as I mentioned he goes and visits the old lady from Seinfeld who offers to make tea and tells him she's going blind and that sight is a gift.

A movie that really didn't know what story it wanted to tell, and really didn't know how to tell any of the ones it attempts to. Give it a miss.",1497744000,,4372,4.316239316239316
7955419,2,B00005UW7Y,"The Operator is not original, it's not realistic and ultimately very self righteous and a bit preachy. Now, I used to work for a major phone company as an operator, and there's no way the things that ""Shiva"" the operator did (in this movie) could ever occur in real life; there's the fcc, in office monitors and how an attorney doesn't have the sense to call the phone company and report the operator and have calls pulled..and the fact he doesn't even think to do this... that's bad.. And that emotional breakdown in the black church.. ugh.. spare me.. way over the top....

At the end, the attorney has a change of heart, and it became a bit too religious for my tastes... Plus, I don't understand how that old school cell phone worked as long as it did when the con man who sold it to him didn't give him a charger... It is interesting to note that Christa Miller (The Drew Carey Show, Scrubs and Cougar Town) plays the wife.. and it was co produced by Betty Buckley.. But even still, I wasn't impressed. Save your time and money and just rewatch The Net or The Net 2.0 - which are classics compared to this derivative mess.",1347753600,,1127,4.392344497607655
7955420,3,B00005UW7Y,"OK, this is not superior filmmaking and OK, the acting is definitely ham-fisted at times (especially the lead, Michael Laurence). But the premise is good and the plotting is, in fact, pretty solid.

An arrogant young attorney (Laurence) [gee, is there any other kind? joke] with an attractive loving wife beds as many other babes as he can, gambles, and defends a racist sleazeball (played really well by the late great Brion James, one of the best character actors around). So this guy's no saint. He makes the mistake of blasting insults at a telephone operator when he's frustrated about finding a number and little by little, the operator begins to ruin his life, via phony phone calls, credit card destruction, bank account problems, humiliation, etc.

So, yeah, it is a come-uppance tale, but the plotting is strong enough to surpass the definite weaknesses in acting. It's good that both the aforementioned James and also Stephen Tobolowsky are on hand to lend the film some acting chops; the other actors pale by comparison. On the other hand, the story is pretty well thought out and it does create some suspense--what will the operator think of next to bring this guy down?  At first the tricks she pulls are predictable, but things heat up and get somewhat more creative.

In one scene, she calls him on his cell phone and spouts Buddhist philosophy at him, which, though some may think sounds phony, is actually real--about desire, attachment, and suffering. That was unexpected and pretty cool.

As mentioned, not great, but not bad at all. Worth seeing.",1142035200,,1567,4.89811320754717
7955421,1,B00005UW7Y,"The only thing I can say in defense of this movie is that it brought my partner and I closer together. For the first time in our relationship, we were in total agreement: this film is crap!

Badly acted (the protagonist departed only briefly from WOODEN to totally over-the-top, stagey HAM), poorly scripted (why the hell was it set in the eighties? Clearly this script has been on some cash-strapped producer's slush pile for a very long time) and shockingly edited (it had more jump-cuts than one of dad's home movies. The whole thing looked like it was edited in-camera); this is easily the worst film I have ever wasted five bucks at the video shop to see.

I do not use these words lightly.

I haven't entered into very much critical detail, because I am currently going through counselling to erase this movie from my memory entirely. I only hope that once this is over I don't forget that I've already seen it and inadvertantly rehire the damned thing.

The only people who could possibly review this movie favourably are either studio cronies or desperately in need of medication.

The only humour in this movie was genereated by either dangerous substance abuse or sheer incompetence...",1100131200,,1195,4.781553398058253
7955422,5,B00005UW7Y,"THE OPERATOR is a marvelous movie--inventive, original, comic, tragic, suspenseful.  Writer director Jon Dichter has crafted a modern day morality tale, with a despicable cad at its moral center.  From the opening moment when Gary Wheelan is caught messing around with a hunter's wife to the quiet climax at an old woman's house, THE OPERATOR is a very engaging and intriguing film.  Much credit must be given to Michael Laurence, who carries the entire movie in his role as Wheelan.  First, he's flippant, self-assured, Mr. Cool.  Then he makes the big mistake of being extremely rude to a telephone operator (well voiced by Jacqueline Kim), and then his whole life falls apart.  Even though Laurence's character is not likeable, by the time he goes through the hell Ms. Kim puts him through, one can't help but feel no one deserves this kind of upheaval in their lives.  Laurence is superb in the scene where he breaks down, attends the church service of an African-American minister he removed from jury duty.  He and John Beasley share a scene rich in redemption, loss, and spiritual renewal.  It's a beautifully doone scene and Laurence shines.  Christa Miller as Laurence's wife is also quite good, as is veteran Brion James in the role of one of Wheelan's clients.  Stephen Tobolowsky also does a nice turn as Wheelan's bookie, who has an interesting way in looking at his illegal activities.
All in all, a quite different and provocative film.  If the operator is acting as some sort of spiritual guide to Wheelan, then perhaps that's what the movie's ultimate message is.",1080950400,5,1580,4.898496240601504
