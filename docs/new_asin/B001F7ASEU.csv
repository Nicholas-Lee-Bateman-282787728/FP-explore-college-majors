8301125,5,B001F7ASEU,Love it.  Picture quality good and the combination came at a fair price.,1496102400,,72,4.538461538461538
8301126,1,B001F7ASEU,"The Torchwood DVDs I received were manufactured and packaged by a company called ""2 entertain Video Limited.""  Several of the discs were scratched due to terrible manufacturer packaging. Two of the plastic ""hubs"" inside the set were broken and the discs were held in place by double-sided tape!!! And, one of the discs was completely blank.......with nothing recorded on it!

Also, as to the hard plastic ""pages"" that hold all the DVDs in the case...........Well, there wasn't the usual plastic ""hinges""......instead, the hinge was simply a piece of cellophane tape applied along the edges!!!  As I was turning the DVD pages, they started falling out.  This is the worst manufacturer packaging I have ever seen.

These were factory sealed DVDs, so it was not the fault of the seller. They promptly issued me a refund.

The 1-star rating that I give for this DVD set, only applies to the manufacturer.  The ""Torchwood"" TV series is itself a great show.",1315267200,4,951,4.943396226415095
8301127,5,B001F7ASEU,I love Torchwood. The characters are great and the acting is seamless. The different concepts they came up with for the show are interesting and keep you glued to the TV. Watch them all. Then move onto Dr. Who so you can see where Torchwood really came from and Captain Jack's immortality.,1314576000,,289,4.576923076923077
8301128,4,B001F7ASEU,"The series itself is true to form for a Dr. Who spin-off.  Dry and campy with a liberal dosing of darker elements.  Both dvd sets have the episodes, pretty much the way they aired.  There aren't a lot of extras and the menu navigation becomes a little annoying by the third disk, but well worth the money spent.  I only wish there were more.",1300838400,,341,4.28125
8301129,5,B001F7ASEU,"A friend told me about Torchwood, so I started watching it on the internet. But the quality was bad, so I decided to buy the complete series. Well, I don't regret it. The series are fun, there's action, drama, humour, really everything.",1295740800,,236,4.642857142857143
8301130,5,B001F7ASEU,"I love Torchwood and it is helpful to have all the episodes, so my husband can enjoy them.  He became interested after Children of Earth.  This provides some great back story on the various characters.  And who can resist Capt. Jack.  :D",1295049600,,237,4.571428571428571
8301131,5,B001F7ASEU,"EXCELLENT ENTERTAINMENT....FULL OF ACTION AND ALOT OF OUT AND OUT WEIRDNESS, WHICH IS WHAT I LIKE.",1260921600,4,98,5.1875
8301132,5,B001F7ASEU,"Like Doctor Who, Torchwood is fantasy/science fiction television at its best. This BBC series manages to be smart, witty, funny and serious throughtout the seasons. You won't see American television handling the broad spectrum of personal relationships as well. Sometimes going over-the-top is not a bad thing.",1259366400,4,310,5.617021276595745
