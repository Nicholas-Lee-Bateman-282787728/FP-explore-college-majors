7843673,4,6303317316,"We really liked this one! It reinforced the conversations we were having at the time about friendships and kindness. I am glad I bought it. I can only ever give Mr. Rogers four stars, as much as I value this series, because the Land of Make Believe is so strange. I think the story lines are more complicated than a young child can get and the characters can be hard to understand. My daughter does seem to struggle with this part, but she loves Daniel the tiger and Loretta the cat. We both find the other puppets creepy.",1210204800,,522,4.336734693877551
