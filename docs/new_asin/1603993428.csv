200967,5,1603993428,"I've always loved this show and am so happy that they finally re-released season 4 which has been unavailable for a long time.  I love old shows like this that are good, wholesome family TV.  Shows where the parents may not be perfect, but always do their best to teach their kids good values.  Shows where the kids may be occasionally a bit bratty and mischievous but are ultimately good kids who end up doing the right thing.  It's refreshing to watch shows like this after sampling some of the trash that is on TV these days.  Imagine a show that ran 6 seasons with not one murder, not one rape, not one explosion, not one car chase, not one sex scene; nothing that constitutes a ""good"" TV show these days.  Perhaps if networks aired more shows like this that promote good family values today, this world wouldn't be as screwed up as it is.  But I digress. The only question that remains to be answered is when is SHOUT FACTORY going to finally release seasons 5 & 6 on DVD?",1442188800,4,977,4.3646408839779
200968,5,1603993428,I love Mr. Belvedere and I hope this becomes available soon so I can purchase it.,1422144000,,81,4.125
200969,5,1603993428,"Love the show! The DVD's were new and love the factthat you get to see the ""Syndicated TV"" promos, not the ABC-TV promos from the late 80's. Thanks for the memories! Note that you must ""select episode"" and select the promo, then it will roll into the show automatically. It's not like other DVD's where you see a bonus section where the promos might be listed.",1363996800,,360,4.46969696969697
200970,5,1603993428,"Nothing to watch on tv except inappropriate garbage,want comedy,but  want it clean like it used to be. You will love this so funny.
There is so much side splitting comedy out there,but you'll have to go back several years I think its definitely worth it",1360800000,4,253,4.622222222222222
200971,5,1603993428,"Mr. Belvedere: Season 4 DVD, The Season Four, comes with All 20 Original Episodes in 3 DVDs and I noticed right away, it also comes with Cheaper Packaging, before each DVD had it's own Sleve with a Brief Description of each Episode, not season Four, all 3 DVDs are clump together in a plastic box. The Company responsible took over to release Season Four on DVD, an online exclusive through their Website, even though a little Pricey, it's Great news for all the Fans, maybe this Company will release Season Five and Six

I am glad I have Season Four with all the Episodes, they are the Originals, nothing has been shorten or removed, the Music and lengths are the same, nicely transferred to DVD with Great Color Picture and Sound and they are a lot of Fun to watch. Great Family Entertainment. I even like to sing the Theme Song, I found the Lyrics on a Website. I'm not giving credits to anyone, in case of any copyright violations, however, the Lyrics here they are,...sing with Me,... LOUDER:

Streaks on the china
never mattered before
Who cared?
When you dropped Kicked your Jacket
as you came through the door
No one glared
But sometimes things get turned around
and no one's spared

All hands look out bellow
there's a chance in the status quo
We're gonna need all the help that we can get
But we just might live the good life yet

Chips and the soda
made a night in the den
So sweet...
And the leftover pizza
made your breakfast at 10
What a treat!
But now we're dining at 7 with the table set
And we just might live the good life yet

Life has a way of taking you by surprise
A roll of the dice
And you're living it up!
Giving it up!

A fight to the finish
never ended with tea
No way...
And you shared all your troubles
with your friend the TV
Every day
But now it seems this new regime is here to stay
Get set for the last hurrah
Movin' on to the la de dah
We're gonna need all the help that we can get
According to our new arrival
life is more than mere survival
And we just might live the good life yet

We're on our way to realizing
We're headed for a new horizon
And we just might live the good life...yet!
THE END  ...Thank You D.D.",1312588800,10,2150,4.201456310679611
200972,5,1603993428,This set is not a bootleg it is a shout factory exclusive and is only can by it from a retailer at  [...],1270080000,,105,3.5652173913043477
200973,5,1603993428,This latest dvd set of the 4th season of Mr. Belevedere is a welcome addition to my collection.  I'm looking forward to the final seasons to be released.  This was a very funny show and the cast was extremely well-chosen.,1269561600,,221,4.5
200974,5,1603993428,"Shout! Factory comes through yet again for Mr Belvedere fans.  Fans were asking ""where is Mr Belvedere season four?""  Shout! responded by producing a set to be sold as an online exclusive through their website.  Retail stores were reluctant to carry an older title that might not have met their sales expectations with the season three set, but that didn't stop Shout! Factory.  They answered fans, along with fans of a few other shows, by selling a fully produced set exclusively online.  This is not a DVR or manufacture on demand set that other studios are producing.  This is just like their previously finely produced seasons one and two and season three sets. The set is not available in stores or directly through amazon, only through Shout! Factory's website or through amazon marketplace sellers.  Hopefully this clears the confusion about this being a bootleg set.  Mr Belvedere season four is NOT a bootleg.

The episodes on the set consist of the entire fourth season's 20 episodes spread out on three discs.  As with previous sets, these are all the original network episodes, not syndicated cuts.  They all have the original opening credits from the original network run.  No music is omitted or replaced.  Bob Goulet guest stars in ""The Trip"" and sings with George & Marsha.  That is not cut out.

Originally Shout! had planned to include commentaries on some episodes, but unfortunately wasn't able to on this set.  We do get the original promos for each episode.  There is no episode synopsis anywhere on the set, but at least we have the promos for a brief description of each episode.  Some of them are quite funny!  We do get a disc by disc listing of epiosdes and their original airdates.  Shout! switched to the thinner viva packs which is a single amaray that holds the three discs on holders this time.  The good part of this is that it takes up less shelf space.  The drawback is that the discs might be a little harder to remove.

The episodes' picture and sound quality is also without issue.  Just as with the past two sets, they look clear and vivid, although occasionally have a blurry spot.  There do seem to be some minor technical glitches on discs one and three.  On disc one if you play the promo on a few episodes once it is over it begins playing the next episodes promo instead of going back to the main menu screen.  This also happens on all episodes of disc three.  This is nothing major and shouldn't detract from the enjoyment of this otherwise finely produced set.

The episodes are yet again hystercial in typical Belvedere fashion.  Many fans find that season four is the highpoint of the series.  I tend to agree.  There are quite a few laugh out loud moments.  It's hard to decide which is funnier, when Wesley creats a Mr Belvedere puppet, or when Mr Belvedere puts on a wig and sings along to classical Wagner. The season ends with the famous episode ""The Counselor"" in which a camp counselor inappropriately touches Wesley.  This is the only episode so far that does not end with Mr Belvedere writing in his journal.  Instead, Christopher Hewett and Brice Beckham address the audience directly to talk about a subject that is,as they put it, is hard to talk about.

All Mr Belvedere fans need to purchase this set so we can see the remaining seasons released, hopefully quickly.  We all need to spread the word that these sets are not available in stores, and anyone who wants to purchase it must do so online.  Just as with the previous seasons, this show still holds up amazingly well and is better than you might remember.  The adult jokes are still in there.  The laughs continue!  Bring on season five!",1265414400,31,3657,4.660406885758999
200975,5,1603993428,"Since Mr. Belvedere Season Four has just been released, I haven't seen the DVD yet.  However, having been a hard core Mr. Belvedere fan, I don't need to see the DVD before making a comment about it.  Mr. Belvedere is one of the best family entertainment series that was ever on TV, excluding Father Knows Best.  The Belvedere series was a very down to earth series that dealt with the problems every household encountered.  The Owens family was a dysfunctional family and Belvedere came to the rescue with his snooty British remarks.  Despite what he said, his comments were hilarious.  But on the serious side, he always came to the rescue when there was a problem and everything worked out fine in the end.  One episode, which I believe is in Season Four, is the episode where Wesley goes to summer camp and his counsellor tries to molest him.  This is one episode that is very relevant today.  Everyone with a child should view this episode.  It is the only episode where Belvedere doesn't write in his diary.  At the end of the episode Brice Beckham and Christopher Hewitt speak to the audience about child molestation and give very good advise.  The Mr. Belvedere series was an awesome program and I hated to see it end.  If you're into some very good comedy and want to laugh your fool head off, Mr. Belvedere is the series to watch.",1265155200,11,1339,4.57563025210084
