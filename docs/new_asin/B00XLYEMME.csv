8716297,5,B00XLYEMME,"As a follower of Martin Armstrong for several years, I was interested in his views. I have never been to any of his conferences, so this was a chance to hear him speak. He is extremely knowledgeable about history as well as markets, and I find his perspective refreshing and frightening. Better to know the truth, after all.
This video is an edited reel of one conference. As I said, he is very knowledgeable and he does hop around a lot, but he fills in a lot of gaps when he  does so. An enjoyable watch.",1457827200,5,506,4.270833333333333
8716298,4,B00XLYEMME,"I would recommend this DVD to those who have limited exposure to Martin Armstrong's work. The presentation is similar to his writings in that he covers a lot of ground which all relates to the premise that most of what we observe in this world is cyclical. If, like me, you have been following Mr. Armstrong for several years, reading his publications and blog posts, you won't find anything in the presentation that you have not been exposed to already. I don't consider the $30 a waste of money because I enjoyed listening to the presentation, however I may have been disappointed if I ordered this item expecting to receive information that has not already been provided in some form via his website. Martin Armstrong's perspective is unique in today's world of business and economics and worthy of consideration. He doesn't tell you how to get rich quick or what to do with your wealth, he encourages us all to objectively look at events and trends and think for ourselves. Also, his organization has developed sophisticated analytical tools to forecast the direction of future trends which help us navigate our individual paths forward.",1456444800,7,1141,4.917098445595855
8716299,5,B00XLYEMME,"There is simply no person better in the world as Martin Armstrong to present with logic, facts, and reason why the cycles of economics exist, and how this information affects every single person who has ever participated in real-life.",1454716800,,234,5.0256410256410255

8716301,5,B00XLYEMME,"If you wish to understand how to invest and protect your wealth during the coming economic crisis, you need to familiarise yourself with Armstrong's models. Everything else is just opinion.",1446076800,2,189,5.333333333333333

I am willing to pay more if it was HD version.

Hard to read presentation letter in dvd format.",1443744000,2,131,3.8518518518518516
