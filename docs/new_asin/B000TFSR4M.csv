8208865,3,B000TFSR4M,"I really enjoy John McGann's playing and usually enjoy his instructional material.  Before you buy this one, you should be aware that it is mainly a lecture with him playing some music.  The information is concise and well presented, and should be helpful to many folks.  There is no tab or instructional documentation.  In addition, he doesn't present lots if drills or play-along material. He sticks to the fundamentals.",1292371200,2,422,5.072463768115942
