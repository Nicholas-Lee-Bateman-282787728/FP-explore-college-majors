3822454,3,B001VG2M9E,"This DVD was professionally done and I enjoyed it to a degree.  It lacked depth.  I grew up in Detroit and I wanted more information on the reasons why Detroit (a beautiful city when I grew up) went down hill so hard and so fast.  This DVD offered some of the information about policy, politics, and laws, but not enough in depth information to satisfy my need to know why Detroit had the worst deterioration (and still sits at that level) in this country's history.  I was hoping for more.",1361404800,2,490,4.411111111111111
3822455,5,B001VG2M9E,"To appreciate Detroit, it's best to hear about it's great history, notice its great architectural contributions, and the imagine how great a place it was and what it will be again. ""Detroit, Remember When""  does that as a documentary. Great DVD to add to your collection, Baby Boomers.",1353024000,3,285,4.9375
3822456,5,B001VG2M9E,"This is a great look back at Detroit in its hay day. very enjoyable. My family and I remembered all the places that we use to go for a nice time, like Boblo, and edge water park
along with Bellisle.",1325289600,5,198,3.975
3822457,2,B001VG2M9E,I expected more of a tour of the city.  There is a fair amount on Hudsons and Ford and Belle Isle but not much more.  Too many interviews pertaining to the music joints from the 20 and 30s and way too much on the Grande Ballroom and Olympia.  Not what I expected.,1300320000,6,263,4.019230769230769
3822458,3,B001VG2M9E,"Bought this for my mother who grew up in Detroit. She fell asleep on the 2nd DVD. It was a little dull and drawn out, but the 1st DVD was interesting to watch. Too much interviewing of people, not enough footage of the city.",1278633600,5,224,4.113636363636363

Everybody seems to be so busy""knocking""the Motor City,tha they tend to forget the town when it was in its' heyday!! These great days are revisited in this enlightening documentary!! The statistics speak for themselves,as far as the bustling metropolis Detroit once was..At one time roughly 2 MILLION people lived in this city of(a mere)140 square miles!! Talk about a great population DENSITY(The hallmark of any""true""city!! In comparison Houston Texas""requires""nearly SIX HUNDRED square miles to be able to boast a population of 1,872,00!!! Among the legendary attractions discussed here that Detroiters enjoyed were amusement parks such as""Jefferson Beach"",""Edgewater""and:Bob-lo Island""amusement park and boat rides..This is a great ride down memory-lane that actually sheds a positive light on Detroit!! Great stuff!!",1251072000,14,887,5.883720930232558
