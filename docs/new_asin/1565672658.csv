*Plot and ending analyzed*

I guess if you have the brain of a gerbil and chew sugar candy all day, this film should fit your bill just fine. Others might want a little more in the way of a coherent story. There are parts of Lady Snowblood that are atmospheric and colorful, but the idea is not handled with enough competency, or even concern.

Lady Snowblood is some dull, waif of a woman, who has a feeble umbrella sword, whom she uses to chop in half corpulent bodies, hands, limbs and heads. Okay. The enemies are as imbecilic as the premise, even unable to fight such a woman. They just sit by and wait to be ""chopped up"". I must admit that the high reviews made me think these films would rate as high as Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman or Lone Wolf and Cub, but they are nowhere near as great.

Still, they are worth a look for the time.",1468972800,,884,4.275449101796407
7796480,4,1565672658,"LADY SNOWBLOOD (1973) is a starkly beautiful Japanese swordplay drama featuring a female fighter, Shurayuki Hime (Lady Snowblood), or Yuki for short, whose mission in life is to track down and slay three of the four villains who brutalized her mother and killed the mother's husband and son. It takes place in the 1890s, in Meiji-era Japan, and includes several helpful flashbacks to provide the context for Yuki's mission. Born in prison--her mother was there for killing the first of the villains and died after childbirth--Yuki is raised by a Buddhist reverend who calls her a ""child of the netherworld"" and trains her in the fighting arts. Tall and regal, beautiful and ghostly white, Lady S (played by Meiko Kaji) looks too pure to sully herself with bloodletting, a tack which gives her the element of surprise in her many swordfights.
The film is divided into four chapters and is based on a manga written by Kazuo Koike, who also wrote the ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" and ""Crying Freeman"" manga series. At one point in Chapter Three, Yuki meets a writer (Toshio Kurosawa) who publishes a newspaper (""a cheap little rag"") and tells Yuki's story, accompanied by manga-like illustrations, making her a legend in her own time and causing her considerable dismay. There's a bit of stylization in the fighting as Yuki leaps up impossible heights and causes blood to gush out like a fountain whenever she slices or dismembers an opponent, but otherwise the film has a deceptive simplicity as Yuki moves like a wraith through small villages and the back alleys of Tokyo in her inexorable quest for vengeance. There is a lot of action and bloodshed, so fans of samurai and yakuza films should be satisfied. The tape is presented in a flawless letter-boxed transfer, in Japanese with English subtitles.
Meiko Kaji (who also starred in the FEMALE CONVICT SCORPION series) plays the title role and sings the theme song, ""Flower of Carnage."" Quentin Tarantino drew on this film as part of the inspiration for the Lucy Liu character, O-Ren Ishii, in KILL BILL VOL. 1 (2003) and also uses ""Flower of Carnage"" on his soundtrack. As impressive as KILL BILL is, fans who want to experience the formal beauty of the original form--seen here in a deftly-blended mix of samurai, ninja, yakuza, and manga motifs--need to go back to films like this. And judging from recent Japanese genre releases, e.g. RETURNER, ONMYOJI, and PRINCESS BLADE (itself a flashy contemporary reworking of LADY SNOWBOOD), to name a few, it's clear that, aside from KILL BILL, ""they just don't make 'em like that anymore.""",1066435200,54,2577,4.912844036697248
7796481,2,1565672658,"Don't get me wrong-- I love a cheesy samurai film as much as the next guy. However, this one is more cheese (and more low-budget) than most. Kaji Meiko (who had starred in three of the cult-phenom 'Sasori' films) chews the scenery as the title character, raised for the sole purpose of avenging the death of her parents at the hands of a group of leering outlaws.
The twist of having a female play the cold-blooded 'swordsperson' might sound intriguing, but it can't compensate for hammy acting, poor photography, sappy enka ballads, a villain straight out of the silent movie era, and slapdash plotting that looks like what it is-- a condensed version of a longer story that tries to compensate with extended narrative. The whole film has the feel of a 'quickie' that was made to cash in on the original comic series, and attempts by the filmmakers to appeal to a broader crowd are just plain awkward. Not convinced? This movie, based on a comic by the creator of the Lone Wolf series, was released after the first FIVE Lone Wolf films had hit theaters in the previous twenty months! That doesn't exactly inspire confidence....
The Grand Guignol-style special effects can be unintentionally laughable, as every slash of the sword produces a geyser of day-glo stage blood, complete with silly spray-on-the-wall sound effects. To her credit, Kaji doesn't look terribly out of place in her role, and there are some decent moments, as when she is faced with the unpleasant task of slaying one of her enemies when he has been reduced to an invalid dependent upon his devoted, innocent daughter. As a whole, however, the film can only be recommended to undiscriminating genre buffs.
If you're looking for a film of this sort that's actually worth seeing for more than spewing arteries and overwrought melodrama, you'd best look elsewhere.
Update: Judging from the trailer for 'Kill Bill,' master plagiarist Quentin Tarantino borrowed some scenes directly from this movie.  But that still doesn't make it any more watchable.  There has also been a Japanese remake that is now available on DVD.",1028592000,5,2087,4.909348441926346
7796482,5,1565672658,"Shurayuki Hime, a child of the netherworld, brought into life with her mother's death opens a fast-paced and insightful story into pre- and post-feudal Japan as one watches the subtle conflict between duty and revenge. It sports quite a bit of blood, so the squeamish may want to look elsewhere. But for tight-plotting, great performances (there are some scenes where Yuki could slay men with her eyes and her glance says a thousand words), and well done sword-fighting (not too theatrical, but more realistic), one need no more than to look here. A most excellent movie. Highly recommended.",1018051200,2,591,5.040816326530612
7796483,5,1565672658,"I rented this randomly because I thought the female swordsperson angle might be interesting, though I really didn't know what to expect.  I wound up surprised that the film had a good story, solid stylish direction, and terrific performances, particularly from the beautiful lead actress, Meiko Kaji, who brings the perfect combination of intimidating pinned up rage and super model good looks.  That's not to mention the terrific swordfighting sequences, which, be warned, are particularly bloody.  This is a must see for people into old Samurai films or anyone interested in gender roles in cinema.",989366400,5,600,5.294736842105263
