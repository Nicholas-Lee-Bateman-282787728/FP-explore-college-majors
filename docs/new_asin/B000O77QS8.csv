8494806,5,B000O77QS8,"I'm a huge fan of What Not To Wear. With the show having gone off the air, I'm now monthly buying on Amazon episodes from the first four seasons that I've never seen (which technically means the show hasn't ended for me ... woot, woot!)
Anyone reading any WNTW review I do should know:
1) I'm only doing these reviews to give the ep 5 stars; I will give EVERY ep 5 stars as a nod to the general greatness of WNTW. I admit it, I'm biased. (But really, if the knowledge, fun, and drama aren't enough, the brilliance and wit of Stacy and Clinton push every ep to a 5 anyway!)
2) While I don't have time for big writeups on each DVD, a few observations: This actually WAS a five-star ep. Megan is a talented up-and-coming singer-songwriter who while extremely thoughtful, and a bit more soft-spoken off stage, is fun-loving, too. There are a lot of laughs during the 360  and while shopping, there's plenty of drama during hair and makeup (great cut by Nick), and even though it was obvious she was gonna be gorg, it was still great to see her confidence at the reveal. Without having Googled Megan to see how she is doing in the business, I will say her two songs that were featured throughout the show were quite good and gave it a cool vibe. Also, having discovered WNTW a little before the midway point of its run, it's amusing to see the ""young"" Stacy and Clinton of the early eps. I particularly enjoyed Stacy's comedic presence in this one; some of her facial expressions were priceless.
3) However, I would be remiss if I didn't again mention the cost ... $19.95 per ep? WTF! I am a big enough fan of the show, and have the resources, to buy them. But do I see anybody else purchasing them? Probably not. Yet if you do spring for this ep you certainly will enjoy it.

SIDE NOTE TO AMAZON, TLC, AND DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS, INC.
