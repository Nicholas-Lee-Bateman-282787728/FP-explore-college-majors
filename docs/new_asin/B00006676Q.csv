1711870,4,B00006676Q,"Yes, THE ATTIC EXPEDITIONS is indeed a different type of movie. However, it isn't unique in it's sur-reality or it's odd structure. It fits right in w/ movies like CARNIVAL OF SOULS, DON'T LOOK NOW, PHANTASM,  JACOB'S LADDER, HORROR, IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS, MEMENTO, SPIDER, PI, DARK CORNERS, VAMP, AFTER HOURS, etc. in it's weirdness and atmosphere. The plot turns in on itself, disorienting us while creeping us out. Trevor Blackburn (Andras Jones) is a man trapped in a nightmare world of insanity, conspiracy, black magik, and murder. Just how much of it is real? How much is induced through drugs and brain-tampering? Dr. Ek (Jeffrey Combs!) performs experimental surgeries on Trevor and sends him to ""The House Of Love"" (run by Wendy Robie from The People Under The Stairs!) in order to get to the secrets hidden deep within Trevor's damaged mind. Secrets that will help Ek to rule the world! Or is he just trying to help Trevor to regain his memory? Nothing is as it appears, well, perhaps some of it is...  I think. Anyway, EXPEDITIONS is a nice twisty film w/ lots of oddity and gruesomeness. I would recommend watching this one a couple of times in a row, as the first viewing might seem confusing...  P.S.- Seth Green is excellent as Douglas...",1211500800,7,1256,4.752293577981652
1711871,3,B00006676Q,its sorta weird but cool and Green like you've never seen him before. You have to see it to beleive it,1064188800,,102,3.9047619047619047
1711872,4,B00006676Q,"""The Attic Expeditions"" opens with our main character, Trevor, waking up four years in the future with little to no memory of who he is. He is sent to a correctional home where he, along with four others, must recuperate enough to go back to the real world. He gets a buddy, Douglas (Seth Green), who claims to have commited an insane act to his body to get him there. But Trevor is being watched by the mysterious and scheming Dr. Ek, who has motives for Trevor. Meanwhile, Trevor is having strange dreams about a chest in the attic of the house. What does all of this mean? What sort of plan does Dr. Ek have for Trevor? The final result is creepy and very suspenseful. Watching this in my basement in the dark, I was thoroughly frightened and thrust around. This is a great movie for those who like psychological thrillers. I strongly reccommend it.",1036713600,,852,4.467948717948718
1711873,5,B00006676Q,"Insane much! This movie rocked the scalez when it came to mixing a hint of ""The Evil Dead"" with ""House on Haunted Hill""... I was in eyeball heaven. I couldn't turn away from the TV in fear that I might have miss something vital to the story/plot or miss a ""jump sequence"". All in all a A++++ Movie... must buy, a must rent, either way come-on Seth Green is in it. He rockz & made the ending VERY interesting.",1027987200,2,408,4.177215189873418

7961985,5,B00006676Q,"Pretty good film. Every time I watch it, I see things I missed the previous times. Seeing Alice Cooper in it was humorous but that's about it. Seth Green is great and so was Jeffrey. This film definitely needs your attention or else by the end you'll be thinking that the movie made zero sense. A couple pretty good songs were in it too, one by Nocturne.",1448064000,,354,4.298507462686567

7961990,2,B00006676Q,"The Attic Expeditions is a mash-up of two kinds of horror: the psychological thriller and Lovecraftian dread of the occult.

On the psychological thriller side we have Dr. Ek (Jeffrey Coombs, playing the same mad scientist he sthick here as his Dr. West role), a criminally misunderstood genius committed to unlocking the secrets in subject Trevor Blackburn's (Andras Jones) head. Ek sets up a monitoring set known as The House of Love, complete with actors and cameras, to monitor the progress in prying open Blackburn's soul. Ek's foil is Dr. Coffee (Ted Raimi...again), whose sole purpose is to sweat and give Ek someone to rant at. The House of Love is populated by actors there to trip up Blackburn. There's Douglas (Seth Green) a fidgety black-nailed scamp who befriends Blackburn. There's hottie Amy (Shannon Hart Cleary) who isn't supposed to seduce Blackburn but does anyway. Ronald (Jerry Haulk) talks through his alligator puppet.  And for some reason Alice Cooper wanders onto the set as Samuel Leventhal. One by one, these characters will reveal their true allegiance as they role-play an elaborate murder mystery with Blackburn at the center.

On the Lovecraftian side is Blackburn's secret (SPOILER EXPEDITION!): he discovered a black book that just might be the Necronomicon hidden in an attic chest.  He and lover Faith (delicious Beth Bates, in full naked-witch crazy mode) decide to reenact the book's rituals that venerate the Great Old Ones.  Eventually, these rituals culminate in a communion of sorts that requires a double murder.  Something goes wrong and only Faith dies.  But she isn't dead - she lurks in Blackburn's consciousness, waiting for him to join her.  She too lusts after the book, but its pages are blank to everyone but Blackburn.

In essence, the only way to unlock the book's secrets is to BE Blackburn.  The movie tries to provide two different means of cracking open Trevor's head, via spiritual possession (Faith) or electronic monitoring and brain surgery (Ek).  The movie focuses primarily on the mystery as to who is attempting to drive Blackburn insane. When that becomes tiresome it switches gears to a more supernatural thriller as Faith body hops the various actors in the House of Love until she gets what she wants.

The problem with these two disjointed plots is that the film simply isn't competently produced.  The flashbacks are egregious, the editing disjointed, and the acting uneven.  Most unforgivable is Jones, who simply can't pull off an acting role of this caliber.  He switches between a monotone whisper and confused ranting, which gets old fast.

The Attic Expeditions is ambitious, and occasionally there are glimmers of brilliance amidst the choppy editing and bad acting.  But mostly it's just a chaotic mess that falls far short of its promise of Lovecraftian terror.",1297382400,2,2840,5.0993520518358535
7961991,5,B00006676Q,"This movie carries on the Jeffery Combs as a mad bad Doctor idea..from some of his other movies...supernatural happenings and hidden agendas galore. Seth Green is entertaining and creepy good in this movie. It is full of action and twists and turns...but always comes back into view...It has a haunted house ,drug experimentation and unexpected violence...throw in a little sex..there it is..
Just plain old mindbending fun...Check it out..",1258761600,,440,5.391304347826087
7961992,1,B00006676Q,"The acting is okay, the photography is okay, but the screenplay is truly awful.  The story makes no sense.  Whoever wrote this piece of garbage needs to make a career change.",1230595200,,174,4.580645161290323
