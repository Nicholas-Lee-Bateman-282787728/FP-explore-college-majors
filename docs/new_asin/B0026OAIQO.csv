8353281,5,B0026OAIQO,"Terror in the Midnight Sun is a rather rare weird gint monster film from Sweden. It has a giant ape like creature that was deposited via spaceship by a ski resort. Panic ensues as spacemen search for the creature. Odd, but atmospheric. Gamera vs. Viras is a classic Gamera movie, complete with cheesy aliens with arms that detach, and a giant squid like monster. They come from outer space to terrorize a handful of adolescent children. Corny fun for sure.",1276473600,2,456,4.7125
8353282,1,B0026OAIQO,This release of Destroy All Planets (Gamera vs. Viras) is unauthorized and illegal. Buy the much higher quality version when it's out this September from Shout! Factory. Don't support movie pirates.,1275609600,,198,5.419354838709677
8353283,1,B0026OAIQO,"Wot a stupid review. Doesn't even mentione the fact that it is all 4:3 aspect ratio, probably crappy VHS transfers HA HA HA... and in English dub!

I mean, seriously, where is the technical information about this release?

I rated it ""1"" because ""0"" isn't an option here.",1241740800,3,271,4.625
