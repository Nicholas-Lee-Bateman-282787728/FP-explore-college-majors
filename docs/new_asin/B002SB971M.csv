The dvd is a series of discussions with Dr. David Weiman, who is very knowledgeable and well spoken - it was easy listening which is refreshing.

A few of the topics covered are:

Emotional and intuitive thinking vs. logical and data reliant investments and decisions
Consequences of a cashless society and useful everyday solutions
The difference between a corporate leader and an entrepreneur
Natural leadership skills vs. skills that can be learned to become a better leader or manager
The psychology behind Ponzi schemes, financial risks, short vs long term investments, and more
The good and the bad that come with the media and information available on the internet - and how they affect financial decisions

All of Dr. Weiman's expertise is matched with proactive advice. He provides the viewers with a ""psychological toolbox"" that will enable them to make better financial decisions. He discusses key strategies in management and leadership - including why placement of employees into appropriate roles requires unconventional thinking at times - or advice for someone who is in a management position but is introverted by nature.

The editing is a little choppy and the actual aesthetics of the dvd aren't anything to write home about, instead it's the content that is valuable. I highly recommend it.",1303862400,3,1423,5.251101321585903
