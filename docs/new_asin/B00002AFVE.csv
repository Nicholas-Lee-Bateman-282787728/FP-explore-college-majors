The film begins with a scene from the story (before the credits). The newspaper announces a vacation. Alvin visits and shows his education. Mr. Beasley delivers the mail in spite of difficulties. J. C. Dithers wants his vacation; Dagwood resigns. His coworkers give him a briefcase for his vacation! Will Dagwood go fishing? Will Blondie's sister come to visit? Will Blondie take Dagwood's job? Will the fishing trip have complications? The milkman uses a horse to pull his cart. [There is a serious undertone to the comic talk.] Dithers makes the deal in Washington, so Blondie will buy that property. There is music and dancing. You've got to see that comic dance routine! ""Start packing!"" There is another misunderstanding. Who else would mess up a deal like Dagwood? And so there is a happy ending.

While the characters are from the comic strip the stories seem to be created in Hollywood. The success of this series shows that it was appreciated by the audience. This could be due to its dealing with ordinary life.",1241740800,,1045,4.865168539325842
7915450,4,B00002AFVE,"I look back rather fondly on these old Blondie films.  Back growing up as a kid in the late 1960's and early 1970's they used to show them every weekend and i would watch them with my dad who had watched them himself in the theatres when he was just about my age back in the late 30's and 40's.  I always found them hilarious, slapstick fun as a kid and while they don't pack quite the same punch today as they did back then they are still good fun.

In ""Blondie Meets the Boss"" Dagwood has quit his job since Mr. Dithers wants him to cancel his vacation.  Blondie goes to try and get his job back and Dithers gives her the job instead of Dagwood.  Dagwood now has to play home-maker!  Eventually this all leads to a nightclub where Blondie's sister Dot is going to be in a jitterbug dancing contest that Dagwood accidently gets caught up in in the films funniest slapstick moment.  This really was one of the strongest entries in the series.  Lot's of laughs and good, innocent golden age fun.",1110240000,2,994,4.306451612903226
7915451,5,B00002AFVE,"As you may know by now after seeing the first film of the series ""Blondie"", the films are wholesome and have a pure sense of humor.  This second film ""Blondie Meets The Boss"" is just as funny as the first.  If the Blondie films seem to be serious at times, please take it in light-hearted fun.  Everything works out.  Dagwood wears the apron this time.  You might recognize the boy who plays ""Alvin Fuddle"".  He is Danny Mummert.  He played Baby Dumpling's pal beginning with the very first film, Blondie (1938), at the age of 4 until the last film, Beware of Blondie (1950), at the age of 16.  Danny Mummert did 24 Blondie films in all.  Mr. Mummert has not been in a film since 1956, but no doubt is enjoying his life of retirement.  As always, the film ends with a happy ending and a smile on your face.  Isn't Daisy a hoot?  The next film in the series is BLONDIE TAKES A VACATION.",1040169600,4,885,4.265060240963855
