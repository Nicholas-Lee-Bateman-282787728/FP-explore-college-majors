1949132,1,B0000VD0ZQ,"Bolo Yeung, the only skilled fighter in this movie, is not the star of the film as the box would have you believe.  The main character is an actor who shows no skill in martial arts.  His character flips out in the beginning after killing someone and then runs away.  The rest of the plot thereafter is nearly indecipherable.  Bolo is the 'Darth Vader' of the movie.  The big villain uses him to beat good guys to death.  Bolo's Shotokan is excellent in the movie, but that is the work's only redeaming value.",1008201600,7,509,4.419354838709677

1949181,3,B0000VD0ZQ,"If you like kung fu movies, you'll probably get some mild enjoyment (keyword: mild) out of ""Chinese Hercules."" It's about a guy who kills his fiance's brother. Feeling awful about it, he runs off to start a new life and a new identity, vowing never to kill again. But, this being a kung fu movie, you can be damn sure there's gonna be some serious a$$ whuppin' by the time it's done. Bolo ""Enter the Dragon"" Yeung is heavily hyped on the box (and the movie's title, ""Chinese Hercules,"" is actually one of his nicknames), but he actually only plays a small role as a henchman.

The DVD I got is from Front Row Entertainment. The image is pan and scan, heavily cropped from the film's probable 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The image is extremely bad - very, very faded and scratchy. The sound is dubbed. While purists might complain, I sometimes get a kick out goofy dubbed dialogue. Unsurprisingly, there are no extras.",1119484800,4,910,4.58282208588957
1949182,3,B0000VD0ZQ,"Well,This movie is about a young man who thinks that he killed his girlfriends brother. In doing so runs off and smashes his hand and swears to never again use his fists. He gets a job at
a pier working for some bad men. The boss of the bad men sells
out to the syndicate and in turn has to get rid of the workers
at the pier any way he can. When his friends start ending up dead the young man must once again raise his fists. The star of the movie is Chan Wai Man who kung fu movie collectors know very well as a common movie villian - but, here he is the good guy. The movie is old and originally had a different title. When they repackaged and changed the title - they capitalized on the fame of Bolo Yeung who plays one of the villians in the movie. The Fighting is solid - I have seen far better and far worse. Their are some minor volume problems in the movie as well. I have given this movie three stars for the simple fact that I have seen hundreds of kung fu movies and martial arts movies and this rates slightly above average to me.",1033344000,3,1043,3.9952153110047846
8003564,4,B0000VD0ZQ,"""Chinese Hercules"" is definitely an above-average film in the Martial Arts genre. It features a solid story, about a man dealing with the shame and guilt of accidentally killing the brother of his fiance. Because of this he leaves his village, vowing never to use his fists again. He ends up in a port village, working on a loading dock, employed by some VERY nasty criminals who treat their workers like livestock. Before long Shen finds that he needs to resort to violence after witnessing the outrageous abuse inflicted by his boss and his henchmen.
  Although Bolo Yeung is credited as the star, he is in fact not the main character. However his role is an important one, as he becomes the nemesis that Shen Wai Ta has to go up against, in some very violent and awesome fight scenes.  ""Chinese Hercules"" is very similar in story and structure to ""The Big Boss,"" with Bruce Lee. And although Bruce is my all-time idol, I must admit I prefer this film to that commercially successful movie, as ""Chinese Hercules"" moves at a faster pace and has a more dramatic element to the story.  I believe the low score of this title has to do with all these horrible dvd prints. The fact is, if you haven't seen it in it's original 2;35 super widescreen presentation, than you haven't really seen the movie. Cut down to the awful 4x3 pan scan format, almost half the picture is cut away. To add to the problem, the distributors didn't even bother to utilize the ""pan and scan"" procedure, where they move the image around inside the frame in order to get a decent picture. Instead they simply chop off huge chunks from both sides of the picture. As a result, many scenes feature prolonged shots of half of people's faces, and sometimes characters are standing so far apart that you only see the sky, or a building and can hear dialog coming from people not on the screen!  It's a shame because it makes a well-filmed movie look like junk, when in fact, this is a beautiful early 70's example of classic Kung Fu cinema.  Too bad almost all dvd's for this title are of this awful version. It is worth it for fans of the Kung Fu genre to track down a good print of this awesome flick.",1517270400,,2170,4.481012658227848
8003565,2,B0000VD0ZQ,"Apparently, if you use Kung Fu,  you aren't allowed to hit very hard the first 94 times. That's so the your opponent gets lots of chances to hit you 94 times before it starts to actually hurt. Bolo didn't follow the rules though, and killed a bunch of guys with only 4 or 5 strikes. Very bad Kung Fu manners.",1506816000,,308,4.133333333333334
8003566,2,B0000VD0ZQ,"An okay kung-fu action film, though Bolo Yueng is not the lead character.  He plays the villain's henchman and does not show up until the second half of the film.  Still, the film does have the nostalgic fun of many kung-fu films from the 1970's.",1497139200,,246,4.444444444444445
8003567,3,B0000VD0ZQ,"It is what it is, a mass produced martial arts film from the seventies.  We grew up watching these movies at the local drive-in where this genre of filmmaking was all the rage.  Although it brought back some memories of that bygone era, this rendition on Amazon had particularly poor audio throughout.  All in all, it was fun to step back in time for this run of the mill kung fu flick.",1485129600,,386,4.333333333333333
8003568,5,B0000VD0ZQ,"DISCLAIMER: DO NOT OPERATE HEAVY MACHINERY WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE OR REAL LIFE PEOPLE WILL DIE.

This movie inspired me to become an orphan just so I can undergo the same transformation as the protagonist who has at least two different names throughout the movie along with some major identity disorders or sorts... but that's only the beginning.  This protagonist's face has more iron clad than the USS Constitution.  This rockstar of a hero blossoms from a trashy gross worm into a super sonic killing machine butterfly in this 1 hour and 30 minute movie of unadulterated rage. During his orphan phase, he never once slept in his life and fights all the time.  As all of us who are scholars in ancient Greco-Chinese mythology, there is great significance in the main character never sleeping.  Argus Panoptes, the 100-eyed giant who never slept, draws many parallels with our Chinese orphan hero, but I don't want to bring any spoilers into this review...

To make a long story longer, this movie will change your life forever.  Do you remember the first time you saw Rudy in the theater, and you were so inspired that when you got out of the theater you stole little Tommy's toy football.  You started running with that pigskin through countless waves of theater staff and stiff arming people wearing tons of denim jackets.  You saw that opening and jumped through the glass doors like an 80s action movie star and made it into the parking lot.  Do you remember that?  But do you also remember how your adrenaline kicked in even more?  The cops see little Tommy's father running after you yelling, ""GIVE ME MY SON'S FOOTBALL BACK!""  Then you heard the soundtrack to Rudy playing even more loudly as though the whole parking lot was a football stadium. You juke'd through the officers like a hot knife through microwaved butter and led the chase on foot into the freeway all the while dodging taser probes.  Not even the demanding shouts of the law could stop your courageous desire to make it to the end zone.  After you slid underneath that jackknife'd semi carrying high explosive nitroglycerin and evaded the smokies, you leaped over a 7 foot barricade then chucked the pigskin on the ground for the touchdown while raising your hands shouting, ""RUDY! RUDY! RUDY!"" and pretended to be hoisted to the air by your teammates.  You looked back and saw that you caused a traffic jam that rivals a common day in Hyderabad, India.  Do you remember that sensational feeling?  Chinese Hercules has at least twice the inspirational effect, so it's VERY important you watch this movie under the effects of NyQuil or Benadryl... or at least wear a straight jacket and ensure that you are locked in a padded room that can contain your level of excitement after watching this movie.  As for me, I already stuffed my empty Pringles cans with imported Chinese liquid lead and am pumping iron just so I can get buff and have massive Chinese Hercules pecs by the end of tomorrow.

Lastly, this movie will serve you far better than years of training in Muay Thai, BJJ, Krav, and most other deadly forms of popular MMA training styles.  I learned how to kill somebody just by using my Slap Chop dominant hand death grip stance on somebody's head.  I can throw all of my Green Beret and Navy SEAL training out the window and 45 years of combat experience against the commies after these 90 minutes of astounding education.  We don't even need guns anymore with this newly discovered Slap Chop style kung-fu.",1482796800,3,3495,4.731023102310231
