1197988,3,B000009RWC,"The production value is terrible on this tape.  It appears to have been filmed in one take, and you can hear outside traffic (including a  motorcycle) in the background.  The music starts and stops are also very  jarring.
I find the instruction is very straight-forward, although I'm  not certain what level of dance it would be best for.  It incorporates some  very basic moves, and also shows some advanced floorwork.  Perhaps this  would be best for an intermediate level dancer.
I did learn a handful of  new moves from this tape, so it does have some use.  Just don't expect  high-quality production.",919987200,17,605,4.823529411764706
7905670,3,B000009RWC,"Alexandra King is a graceful, fluid dancer, on par with Neon. She does the best snake arms & wrist circles I have ever seen. Her performance at the end was graceful & you can really see her be in the moment & enjoy dancing.

The teaching itself was simple & straightforward, especially if you want to incorporate zills. She teaches slowly first, then normal speed, then normal speed with zills w/ & w/o music. This is not a workout, but like a class.

I took off 2 stars for VHS quality & sound quality & also that she could/should have had music playing softly at all times to kill the monotony.",1175126400,,596,4.36036036036036
7905671,3,B000009RWC,"Content is good.  Quality of sound is so bad, it is hard to continue to listen to it all the way through.",1026777600,,105,3.772727272727273
7905672,1,B000009RWC,This tape in general is poor quality.  She guides you stiffly through the movements and doesn't seem to be enjoying herself at all.  I would not recommend this video.,1016755200,8,166,4.689655172413793
7905673,2,B000009RWC,"If you're a belly dancer who has taken ANY classes and you're just looking for instructional videos as a supplement - move on to another video.  If you have any dance experience at all, this will be too simple for you.
Alexandra King's style is a cross between Greek and American Cabaret.  She covers beginning belly dance instruction like the basic egyptian steps and simple arm movements.  She doesn't go into any real explanation of Arabic rythyms.  She tells the viewer for veil work, a chiffon type of fabric is best.  She doesn't explain that this is merely her opinion and any lightweight fabric could be used, it's a personal preference. It looks like it was filmed in the basement of her house.  I have both Volumes One and Two and I plan on donating them to my local public library.
If you don't have the opportunity to study with someone locally, and you don't know of any other belly dance resource where you can find higher quality videos, then this is okay if you are brand spanking new to the dance.  Otherwise, save your money.",975888000,28,1043,4.575268817204301
7905674,5,B000009RWC,"Highly reccommended for beginner. As a slow learner,I am glad to have this tape,I use it as a warm-up every morning with my youngest daughter. Get it, you will never regret.",971913600,3,173,4.612903225806452
7905675,4,B000009RWC,"this video is good for the beginning-to-intermediate or intermediate dancer or someone looking to flesh out their performance routine. it  doesn't go through a warmup but takes you through the moves for both a slow  chiftitelli floor routine and a fast drum solo. though i knew a good amount  of the moves already the floor routine was helpful and there was enough new  stuff to keep me interested. visual quality isn't the greatest but it gets  the job done, and the video is definitely worth the price. the performance  at the end is fabulous and i love the costume! one pet peeve: the dancer  teaches you to do a full hip circle by straightening you legs to push your  butt up when you get to the back and some other strange stuff...the way i  was taught *not* to do it! i had heard of someone teaching it this way and  i guess it was this video... otherwise the rest is all good information and  she is an impressive dancer. i'd like to see more by her",966902400,12,956,4.375
7905676,3,B000009RWC,"I bought Alexandra King's first tape in this 2-volume set, and while I allready knew most of what was presented on the first tape, I purchased this one to learn a few more moves for the chiftitelli rhythm and because  of the reasonable price.  Alexandra strikes me as a good teacher in that  she presents herself well, speakes clearly and succintly, gives  thourough-enough explanations for the techniques, and her performances seem  well-articulated.  I would take lessons from her if she ever came here, or  would attend at least a workshop. There is minimal ""fluff"" and  time is not wasted much in this tape. Some movements are unnecessarily  repeated, like the chest/wrist circles, but then she uses those movements  to show some inprovisational work one could try.  The back arch is repeated  again, and like in my other review, this is an advanced move  that I feel  really should not be in the first tape, but maybe she presented it as a  challenge and for something to work towards.  There is no history or Middle  Eastern Dance given, but if one wants to learn basic movements than that is  fine.  If I had made the video myself I would have used different music for  the second tape is its a bit repetitive. Alexandra gives mostly hip  movements in addition to the lengthy floor-work in this one and does a good  job of showing movements from a side-view as well.  It would be a little  more helpful is she had employed the use of another dancer to demonstrate  what some moves look like on another body type.  Alexandra first  ""walks"" you through each move and then does it again to music  with the zill(finger cymbals).  This tape is very good if one wants to  practice with their zills and improve their finger/body coordination which  can be quite frustrating at first. I only wish she had demonstrated for  absolute beginners the proper way to put them on.  I feel one part should  have been redone as the music runs out before she's through with one small  segment, otherwise her timing is well-done. I have not decided yet as to  whether the chiftitelli or drum solo section is stronger, but I do feel  there would have to be a separate tape in itself for floor work as its  advanced and requires a lot of body strength, so I had wished she had cut  out most of the floor work and tailered it more to one learning some more  pure choreography.  The set is well-lit for the tape, but at the end where  she is dancing in a restaurant, it is poorly-lit.  The quality of the  production in terms of the image being in focus is not that great, but then  its appropriate for the retail price.  Her costumes match well with her  movements and the one she made herself at the end is impressive. Have fun  watchhing and practicing this spiritual dance form!",955324800,41,2765,4.558282208588957
7905677,5,B000009RWC,"Here I am again!  Volume 2 is just as wonderful as volume 1!  I can't get enough of this!  Alexandra does an overview of volume one with a few dance moves and warm ups, but this tape focuses on complete hip movements mostly!  I love it, love it, love it!  At the end she does a slow dance using a lot  of large movements with her arms and legs, then a second dance moving those  hips! Hips, hips, hips everywhere!  This tape is very inexpensive and you  will learn a lot from it.  BUY IT!",948672000,15,488,4.042105263157895
7905678,4,B000009RWC,I highly recommend this video for the beginning or intermediate belly dancer. Covers a bit of everything. I use it frequently. I am going to purchase Volume 1 since I liked this one so much.,946512000,,190,4.457142857142857
