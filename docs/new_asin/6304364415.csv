856677,5,6304364415,"Surviving four acts of classical ballet and Tchaikovski in the days of Pina Bausch takes... a lot. In this case it is easy thank's to the quality of every soul involved in the production. It is difficult to think of a better Aurora for Dowell's version. Durante is magnificent. Solymosi knows he is not a great soloist, and dedicates himself to be a good ""partenaire"" (smart move!) and a handsome prince (yes, that is called ""danseur noble"" and seems to be rare today with so many male ballet divas in New York and Paris). Of course the greatest ""thing"" is Dowell's Carabosse: That's acting-dancin Ms. Pina Bausch! Costumes, lighting, orchestra, the whole company. I cannot think of anything dissapointing except, maybe, the need of a strongest Lilac Fairy. Thank you Royal Ballet!",1041811200,16,781,4.924242424242424
856678,5,6304364415,"An incomparable performance of the Tchaikovsky-Petipa masterpiece from the Royal Ballet. From the moment the curtain rises on the Prologue we are swept into world of fairy tale splendor. Viviana Durante is exquisitely beautiful and technically brilliant as Aurora with stud-muffin Solymosi (he of the supple buttocks) her accomplished Prince; Dowell is a deliciously evil Carabosse with the lovely Hussein countering him as the beneficent Lilac Fairy. Sets and costumes are fabulously splendid, suggesting the early 18th and 19th centuries. In the panorama scene, the Prince travels through a wintery landscape to raise Aurora from her deathlike sleep, and, in the final act, their union is celebrated beneath a brilliant sunburst with Aurora's fairy tale guests dressed in lovely pastel costumes. This production cannot be bettered nor praised enough: every art of ballet theater has been lavishly employed in its creation. Principals, solists, corps, designers, and musicians are all in magnificent form. A 'Sleeping Beauty' that will delight most.",1038182400,23,1050,5.610062893081761

Every dancer from Durante down to the Corps is wonderful and Jane Burn and Belinda Hatley shine as 2 of the fairies.
The production is less refined than the POB production (where you can see real lyrical dancing from every member of the cast) . *However*, it more than makes up for it with the energy and passion which the POB production sorely lacks. If there is only one Sleeping Beauty you can get, this is it.",1026777600,12,588,4.3545454545454545

Some may prefer a more aloof and dignified Princess - but Durante is the Princess for me!  Absolutely wonderful.

856682,4,6304364415,"It is generally agreed by ballet critics that video and film cannot capture the impact of a ballet performance, and are best used to record performances so that later dancers can see how it was done.  However, these critics have the advantage of living in those few cities with well established ballet companies.  Sleeping Beauty is a long ballet, with many roles, and thus is beyond the resources of all but the largest companies.  This video is of an excellent performance by the Royal Ballet.  The dancing, costuming, and sets are all excellent.  The camera work also does a good job of making up for not being there in person.",1002844800,19,630,4.6909090909090905

856805,4,6304364415,"This DVD provides a wonderful, if imperfect, evening of ballet.  The sets and costumes are greatly flawed but the production still conveys the necessary atmosphere of sumptuousness and magic that one wishes for in The Sleeping Beauty, historically a legendary signature ballet of the Royal Ballet. The DVD is worth having for several reasons, chief among them the amazingly secure and exquisitely danced Aurora of Viviana Durante.  This technically fearsome role is beautifully served by Durante's fleetness, line, phrasing, and technical authority.  She has at times seemed tiny to the point of meagreness to me, but in this role her fragility works to her advantage, making her command of the technical difficulties of the roles seem that much more effortless.  The rest of the roles are nearly as wonderfully danced and mimed - the fairy solos are quite difficult in themselves and are danced with aplomb by the soloists,  who display the admirable technical depth that was available in the company in 1994.  Some exceptions: Benazir Hussein was unforunately unequal to some aspects of her difficult solo in the Prologue - a shame as she was a lovely dancer for the most part.  And Leann Benjamin was simply too big, physically, for Florine in the Bluebird Pas de Deux in the last act.  Her partner had trouble lifting her and she can be seen missing her footing once.  If lightness and lift are non-negotiable anywhere in The Sleeping Beauty, it is in this demanding pas de deux, and Bejamin's physical unsuitability for the part nearly undermined the whole.  The Prince in Sleeping Beauty is a pretty thankless role, the emphasis being on partnering more than solo dancing, but Zoltan Solymosi danced it sincerely and skillfully, partnering Durante gallantly.

The major defects of this production are the awkward stage sets and the hideous costumes by Maria Bjornson, particularly for the courtiers.  The Queen looked like nothing so much as a woman struggling under a basket of overturned laundry.  The eye simply does not know where to go - it is just ugly and without an iota of beauty or grace. Thankfully, the costumes for the dancing principals are traditional.  I'm sure Bjornson thought she was doing something terribly clever with these angled sets and ridiculous costumes, but all she really did was cause the viewer to thank the gods for Tchaikovsky's gorgeous score and Petipa's brilliant choreography - at least Bjornson couldn't spoil those.  One can only imagine the horror of the ballerinas alternating in the role of Aurora during that season when they saw the long staircase down which they had to make their entrance just before beginning the Rose Adagio! Really, Dowell should have known better. . .

And speaking of Anthony Dowell, he may have taken a wrong turn with the production design, but he is authoritatively and deliciously evil as Carabosse.  The mime, as is almost always the case with those trained by the Royal Ballet, was crystal clear without being overdone.  These are true stage people, not just dancers.

Thus, in spite of its flaws, I can recommend this as a worthwhile performance of this deservedly loved ballet.",1196380800,6,3160,5.019157088122605
856806,4,6304364415,My ballet students are studying this classical ballet and this video helped them understand the discipline and passion it takes to become a dancer. I appreciate the quality and the short time it took for  me to get the video.,1178755200,3,225,4.625
856807,3,6304364415,"Great great dancing! Fantastic music! But the designs! YIKES!

Alas, design plays a huge part in this ballet, more so than in most. And this production's are crap. Ugly and dark and inexplicable, the sets belong to some German expressionist silent film or an Alfred Hitchcock suspense climax. Where are Kim Novak and Jimmy Stuart when you need them? And Edith Head....who might have saved the show costume-wise.

Y'know part of the fun of this ballet is the sleeping court waking up in styles that are 100 years old. Then everyone is gloriously ""up to date"" for the whoop-de-do in Act III. In this version the court sees no reason to change. This and utterly bizzare stuff like shaking, floating dinner chairs with Carabosse emerging from under the table just make one moan.

But the fabulous dancing and mime [Carabosse is wonderful....even if she does come from under the table] just make one smile with joy. Definitely worth seeing at least once.",1170547200,5,949,4.845679012345679
856808,5,6304364415,"As a ballet lover of many years, I was utterly transported watching this superb performance of one of my favourite ballets.  Everything about it was absolutely tops:  sets, costumes, lighting, music - and of course the dancers.  Viviana Durante who I had not seen dance before was technically and dramatically a lyrical and beautiful Aurora. She reminded me of Alessandra Ferri. Solymosi was a to-awaken-for prince - and their partnership in dance was out of this world.  The Lilac Fairy (Benazir) was gracious and firmly sent the wicked witch on her way.  Carabosse (Dowell) has lost none of his dramatic skill.

The Royal Ballet corps showed its usual precision and excellence.

When I was a child in the 1940s my parents took me to see Sadlers Wells Ballet company - precursors of the Royal Ballet - at the Royal Opera House.  It was a signature experience for me.  This version of the Sleeping Beauty reawakened that memory.  Bravo.",1168300800,6,936,4.867088607594937
856809,5,6304364415,"I had never been very interested in Ballet till I found this video by the Royal Ballet of the Covent Garden.

I will try to describe my impressions schematically (I cannot help it, I am an engineer, haha):

Video Quality:

--------------

It is acceptable enough as the video has been recorded on the 90's.

Music

-----

The quality of the audio is fine, and the interpretation in very intense. I have to admit that I used to think that Ballet spoiled the music so to give more ""room"" to the dancers but that was, definitely, not the case.

Dance

-----

Well, there is a big brighting star here, and it is Aurora, no doubt. The role is played by an, almost anorexic, ballerina (Viviana Durante) which brings out a lovely, fresh, happy princess. She has great technique of feet, impressing leg extensions, she is very quick and nervous in movement and she is a great actress (compensating 100% the lack of phisical presence that she has, (as she is so thin) the fact that her jumps are not powerful).

On the other hand, the prince role is not convincing. I find the male main character performance very artificial. However, as he has such good phisical condition, one can always enjoy with his jumping and turning, etc.

Other characters are the fairies, played by Debbie Bull, Benazir Hussein, etc. Some of their performances are really brilliant, most of all their solos.

Some pas a deux such as the birds'one are simply great.

In general, the story is well developed and most of the dancers are very good. Again, the prince (Zolymosi) is not credible enough, what a pity!

COnclusion

----------

It is both a good performance and a good purchase. Enjoy!

(and excuse my awful english!)",1156291200,4,1693,4.68135593220339
856810,4,6304364415,"The dancing in this production of Sleeping Beauty is mostly delightful, but the staging is a disaster further compromised by the weird camera angles of the filming.

What a pity that the viewer must struggle to focus on the dancers' lovely lines while distracted by the overwhelmingly jarring composition of the sets behind them.  The distorted perspective, the stark contrasts between light and dark, the explosive rendering of the scenes all pull the viewer's eye away from the dancers and into the background, making the dancers mere accents to the design instead of the focus of attention.  The costuming, utterly overdone with pleats, panels, embroidery, ribbons, and fringes make for distractions. Add to that a camera angle that often aims up at the dancers from below, half the time loses their feet, and draws the viewer's eye up over their heads into the sets behind them, and we have a film that makes us yearn for what this production could have been if the staging and filming had come up to what the dancers offer us.

Contrast this with the Kirov 1989 version filmed in Montreal against totally dark or subdued backdrops so that the dancers are highlighted  and the camera angle is down onto the stage from a real audience perspective.

The Nureyev version with Canadian National Ballet, also filmed down onto the stage, is much more satisfactory because the sets are darkened or the camera angles are widened to encompass the choreography, close-ups and crops are minimized, and the lighting brings out the principals in the drama.

Having said all this Durante's dancing is lovely, her line exquisitely solid. The fairies variations in the first act and the character dances in the third are delightful, as is the final pas de deux., and this version deserves a place in one's collection for the sake of the dancing alone.

Four stars for the dancers, period!",1136073600,11,1876,4.9145569620253164
856811,5,6304364415,"This is one of the finest performances of The Sleeping Beauty available.  It is exactly what you should expect from the Royal Ballet.  The dancing is about as good as it gets:  both the female and the male dancing.  Fortunately, the male adagio in the second act is included; since there is a great deal of female dancing in this ballet, it is a pity that this adagio is often omitted, so I am glad to see it here. Everything else is fantastic as well, including the costumes and the surreal set design.

That was ten years ago and I haven't been able to watch until now because this one of the last DVDs she watched before she passed. I have to say that I really enjoyed the Nutcracker much much more that might have something to do with being more familiar with its music. Or it could be that at 78 minutes, Nutcracker was much shorter than the 132 minutes for Sleeping Beauty. I have to be honest and say that I could not get all the way through this one - I got to maybe around 100 minutes. As others have said, another reason for this was probably that it just looked drab. The other thing that bothered me was the DVD slip cover because it looked like it was printed on a home computer. I don't know if thats still the case, but it sure looks like its the same one in the photo.

The dancers who play the King and Queen - Aurora's parents - are wonderful even though their roles are non-dancing.  It's one of the few versions I've seen where Aurora and her parents convince me they actually care about each other.

Also interesting is the choice not to hide the spindle in flowers, as most versions do, but to have it given to her without disguise, and have her act like an excited young girl would, keeping her gift in defiance of everyone around her.

The quality of the movie could be a lot better.  It was the '90s, not the '30s.  The quality of the film itself was really disappointing.",1413936000,,750,4.552238805970149

7869378,4,6304364415,"I've watched almost all the Sleeping Beauty-ballets I could and whats making this my favorite is simple: it's just awesome.

  I know almost nothing about ballet techniques so I can't say what makes a good pirouette and what not, but I can see when there's passion and energy in a performance and this really have it. The performers looks like they're enjoying themselves.

  Viviana Durante really fits the role of princess Aurora. She looks so young and innocent.
  Anthony Dowell as the evil fairy Carabosse is really scary and intimidating.
  The lilac fairy, Benazir Hussein, is a real treat to look at, she is a real contrast to Carabosse, being loving and good yet authoritative and strong when she needs to be.
  Zoltn Solymosi was alright although he looks a bit big next to smallish Viviana Durante.
  I also want to highlight William Tuckett and Elizabeth McGorian as the king and queen. They don't dance a single step but their acting is great. I've seen really wooden acting in ballet where the actors just do the mime with stiff faces and no eye-contact or bodylanguage. Here, they take it seriously, just look at them in the prologue and the first act and how they interact with one another. You can really believe they are a loving coupe and parents to Aurora. The same goes for all the dancers as well.

  In some of the other reviews they criticize the costumes, that they are over the top but I liked them alot. They give the show a really 18th century fairytale-ish feeling. The only two things that could have been better is the sets which I feel should have had some warmer colors instead of the sterile grey and white they're in. The quality of the picture is also a bit unfocused, probably because this was originally taped for VCR.

  All in all it's great DVD and, in my personal, humble opinion, the best Sleeping Beauty ballet.",1350000000,2,1855,4.631901840490798
7869379,3,6304364415,"Well, it is good, but it's not easy to guess what's going on all the time. A lot of the dances seem to be nothing more than dances; they're not really telling the story. The device used is entertainment for the king and queen, Aurora's parents. But in the last act, which is said to be the wedding day of the princess and prince, many of the dancers wear costumes that seem to be depicting fairy tale characters. You don't really find out who they all are until the credits roll, and they roll too fast.

Still, there are some terrific dancers here, no Baryshnikov, but plenty of very good dancing and some really hot bodies in tights. The male bluebird is exceptional, and the wolf who chases Red Riding Hood is, well, a wolf. The pair of flirting cats are charming.

The music is by Tchaikovsky, and I love it, but there's only one song I really know: the one Walt Disney used in his version of Sleeping Beauty for the song ""Once Upon a Dream."" One of the reasons I wanted to get the DVD of the ballet (this one is the Royal Ballet) was to decide whether I want a CD of the entire score for the music. I do.

The sets and costumes are well done, the dancers are very good, but it just wasn't as engrossing as the Nutcracker with Baryshnikov's magnificent buns.",1336608000,,1262,4.294117647058823
7869380,4,6304364415,"I love Tchaikovsky's score for ""The Sleeping Beauty"" and know it forwards and backwards.  I had seen bits and pieces of this production online and decided I wanted to own it.  It has some very good things going for it and some things that are best ignored.  The good: The use of Marius Petipa's original choreography.  It is just as interesting now as I imagine it was in the 1870s (1880s?).  The performances.  Everyone plays a distinct character (even the corps members) and does a good job acting.  The performances of the main characters (the king, queen, fairies, princess, etc) are very well done and the mime is clear, and the dancing is first-rate.  Standout performances are given by Viviana Durante as the Princess Aurora - she is rock-solid in her technique and makes the most difficult steps look easy; she also makes for a charming Aurora; the other standout is Anthony Dowell as the evil fairy Carabosse.  Very well acted, authoritative, and sure of himself.  The Royal Opera House orchestra is led by Barry Wordsworth and is tight in it's sound (If you know the score there is a glaring mistake in the first act, though).  Now, the ""bad"", which, in my opinion isn't really so bad, it's just different, and that is the overall design by the late Maria Bjorson, who designed ""Cats"" and ""The Phantom of the Opera"", I believe.  She puts a forced perspective on the sets that is disorienting upon first viewing.  But, with multiple viewings it has some sublime detailing, even though it is still bizarre.  My advice, do your best to ignore the set and watch the dancing.  The costumes are, like the set off-putting upon first viewing, sure you have traditional tuts and tights but then you have some that I can't describe, you just have to see them.  Once you start really looking at them, though, you'll be amazed at the level of detail through layering colors, and designs on them.  The fairies and the bluebird are especially notable for this.  The, in my opinion, true bad:  Tchaikovsky's score comes out relatively unscathed throughout the Prologue and first act, with just a few measures of music and repeats lost here and there, nothing too distracting.  The scorned act fares worse, with cuts of all but two of the hunting party's divertissement numbers, the movement and re-orchestration of the Serebande from Act 3 to serve as a solo for the prince, the loss of the violin solo entr'acte and a drastically cut awakening scene.  Act 3 suffers the worst.  The Gold Fairy's variation is gone, as well as the Pas Berrichon and Cinderella and Prince Fortune.  There are many, sometimes glaring edits to the music and at times it seems to come to a screeching halt and then change gears completely by starting a new number.  People who don't really know the score probably won't be bothered by all this but it drove me crazy.  In summary, I can recommend buying this DVD based on the strengths I pointed out above.  I know I'm forgetting something but, oh, yeah, the video production quality is excellent with great camera work, editing, and clarity of sound.",1287187200,3,3073,4.7293233082706765
