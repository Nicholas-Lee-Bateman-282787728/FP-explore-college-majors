8646269,4,B003KK5ARU,"I have to disagree with M.greer in giving this product a 1 star review. I believe this product does what it was intended to do. That was, as it was titled, ""Build a water cooled gaming PC"". It gives you the customer, the basic processes and assistance in doing just that.

The author uses sound practices and helps the customer form the right ideas for building their own systems. After doing research at [...] before getting this product, it really didn't matter to me that there may be older computer components in the video. The process for building a computer is generally the same for each build.

I did see that the author of this video has commented that the video production was delayed and was actually recorded in 2008. So I can't really nock them for that.

Like most videos/books in this field, the author believes that the customer has the basic knowledge of what tools to use, how to connect computer cables and the best practices for handling the components. The author does a good job in overview of these areas but I believe the video was meant to build upon the customers' existing knowledge, as it should. You wouldn't attempt to sky dive or rebuild a car engine without learning the basics first.

Overall it's a good video",1280880000,,1243,4.610859728506787

will this help anyone ? yes but if you don't know what your doing at all this could have you going WTF at one point in time as it covers nothing on what to do if you run in to problems or if you happen to get stuck. no help at all on where to get help. this may pull people in for the water cooling side read read and read more some really bad info at times. but if you have never done water cooling before its a nice first step ""showing"" how to set it up some what but its not 100% great but better than just reading how. this should have been $5-$10 anything more is a waste. i will sell my copy for $10 shipped lol",1278720000,,2438,4.056367432150314
