This is the fifth in the Lucky Luke series, staring Terence Hill. In this episode, Daisy Town runs out of coffee and the town's folks demand that Lucky do something. In addition, Susan B. Anthony arrives and stirs up trouble by claming that Lotta Legs can do a better job as sheriff. Luke has no problem with this and turns over his badge to Lotta and takes on being the saloonkeeper - with a flair of keeping the place clean (the cowboys must take off their boots before walking on his floor.) Lotta is searching for the coffee, and soon discovers that Valdez, who is not imitated by a female sheriff, has taken all of the coffee.
Sit back, pour a cup of coffee, and enjoy this episode of Luck Luke. Valdez turns out to be a very famous coffee man of our time.
Be careful, the DVD appears to have no regional code (as stated on the cover) - it plays fine on my non-regional DVD player but will not play on my older one.",1010880000,2,952,4.236263736263736
