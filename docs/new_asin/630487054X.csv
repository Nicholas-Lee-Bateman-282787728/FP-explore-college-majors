7879251,3,630487054X,"Mafia: An Expose' is a good way to find out more about the Mafia, La Cosa Nostra & organized crime in general. (If this is the boxed set, and not just the Al Capone DVD.) For the people really interested in the History of the Mafia, this is a must! (I say again, as long as this is the boxed set of 5 DVD's.) Even my wife liked this set. Good history. If you don't like history or can't deal with films that are not big production, this is not for you.",1097884800,4,452,3.9239130434782608
