7960603,5,B0000648XW,"This was quite an enjoyable film, documenting an artist who deserves far more recognition, Teddy Edwards. The music is great with Teddy playing vitally at age 78. He is intelligent, personable, articulate as is his band members. His views on Charlie Parker are fascinating. Teddy's views on learning, playing and performing jazz- ""making music"" are too. Jazz critic, historian Dan Morganstern contributes interesting historical facts about the Los Angeles jazz scene; here they splice in part of a Dexter Gordon interview. Although they advertise Dexter Gordon as part of the film, his segment is from elsewhere and not really filmed specifically for the film; it was not necessary to include this and was the only part of the film that was lifted from elsewhere. Certainly an interesting and enjoyable film bringing some much deserved attention to a criminally over looked jazzman, Teddy Edwards.",1312761600,4,897,5.27972027972028
