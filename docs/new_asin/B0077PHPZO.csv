5062700,4,B0077PHPZO,I learned a lot from this film but the film quality seems like it is a bit old.  Could be better quality of filming.,1370131200,,116,3.8333333333333335
8512045,3,B0077PHPZO,"Interesting, but footage is very old - reminds me of early elementary school watching old film reels for those of you who remember that!  The footage is very graphic and does show the chase, the kill, and the graphic aftermath when animal eats animal.  Also shows full-on live births.  This was not made for young children and the DVD cover is quite deceiving as it looks up-to-date and super cute - makes you believe this is appropriate for young kids.  I like the DVD but would recommend for older kids.",1507420800,,505,4.5777777777777775
8512046,5,B0077PHPZO,Perfect even for very young children.  My 4-year-old and 7-year-old were both fascinated.,1502064000,,89,5.846153846153846
8512047,1,B0077PHPZO,animal lover all kind big and small very interesting and help increase my knowledge of animals shown,1475020800,,100,4.9411764705882355
8512048,2,B0077PHPZO,"This video is pretty poor quality.  It looks like it was shot in the early 90's and although I'm sure the content is cool, it's just really hard to see.",1447718400,,152,4.066666666666666
8512049,3,B0077PHPZO,shows some animals attaching and eating other animals.,1443657600,,54,5.875
8512050,5,B0077PHPZO,"Bought this for my 1 1/2 year old granddaughter and she loves it. It's not a 'kids' movie but since she is so interested in baby animals, it does hold her attention",1421107200,,164,4.15625
8512051,1,B0077PHPZO,"This is not a bad DVD and the price was right for 3 hours- BUT BUT BUT the footage is SO OLD! The color is all wore out basically!! Look here, kids of today want and are used to way better than this old school stuff....sorry but its the truth .....",1401840000,3,248,3.8823529411764706
8512052,5,B0077PHPZO,One of my granddaughter's favorite videos. This is the second one we bought for her!  She wore out the first!,1397260800,,109,4.45
8512053,3,B0077PHPZO,"I can't say I love it, the DVD was made a while ago, and the photography does not compare to the BBC Planet Earth at all.  My Grandson seems to enjoy it though.",1389139200,,160,3.8484848484848486
8512054,3,B0077PHPZO,"This DVD is way to graphic for children.  The segments of wild baby animals which was delightful, just wasn't of any consequence compared to the bloody gore that was throughout.  You might want to save this type of filming for another audience.

What were you thinking when you made the cover to entice people like myself to purchase this DVD thinking it would be a nice family DVD to watch with our children together.  Thank God we viewed it first before mailing it off to our family!",1379376000,17,485,4.540229885057471
