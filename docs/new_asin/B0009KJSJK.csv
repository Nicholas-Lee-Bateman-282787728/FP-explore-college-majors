8062658,5,B0009KJSJK,"The Kratt brothers always seem to organize animal knowledge/observation in inventive ways, somewhat around natural selection ideas, how animals cope with certain common conditions, even though they are very different species. And they (the Kratt brothers) somehow do this in a way that is accessible for preschoolers (even toddlers!) and still engaging for parents. That's about as tall an accomplishment as I can imagine. I would recommend this series to anyone. (The fact that there is a dual track in dubbed-over French makes it even more fun for the family when we're up for something really different!)",1128211200,7,607,5.268041237113402
