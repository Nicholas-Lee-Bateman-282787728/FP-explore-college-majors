8265910,5,B0017HEYD4,"I have purchased books and DVD's over the past year. It wasn't until I purchased Frank Clarkes DVD's Simply Painting, that I actually learned something. I am now painting and have picked it up quite quickly. I love to listen to Franks stories as he paints and will watch these at night then the next day again then paint. I do not use the goat hair brushes however, they are just not my style but if I had not stumbled upon Franks DVD I would still be painting trees and rocks. I own both Painting Across America DVD's and plan on purchasing more. I also signed up on Franks, Simply Painting website and enjoy his lessons and free videos for the good price of $6.00 per month. Hats off to Frank Clarke.",1375228800,7,702,4.325757575757576
8265911,3,B0017HEYD4,"I gave this item 3 stars, not because of the DVD, but because the packaging is so misleading.  It shows paint brushes.  I called Amazon prior to purchasing this item to make sure that the brushes in the DVD were going to be got-hair like Frank Clark uses.  The lady was extremely helpful and told me that they were got-hair so I placed my order. Imagine my surprise when the DVD arrived and I did not get any brushes.  So I called back to Amazon and another CS representative informed me that the brushes were not in the package.  Told me I can return the DVD.  I am still deciding as I really like the DVD but shame on Frank Clark for using packaging that shows brushes beside the DVD as if they are included.  And I guess shame on CS with Amazon that told me they were included and were made of got-hair.",1349308800,,806,4.194805194805195
8265912,5,B0017HEYD4,"Frank Clarke is a wonderful teacher and these dvds are wonderful too. He shows us how he paints. You learn how to do landscapes and paint things like palm trees, understand foreground, middleground, etc. It is a fun dvd to have and a great way to paint along with Frank Clarke.",1342396800,4,277,4.450980392156863
