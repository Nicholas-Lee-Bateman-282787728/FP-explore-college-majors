7215422,5,B00YI71PN2,"As much as I respect everyone's opinions and try to tolerate all of the quibbling reviews on here, this is just one ongoing debate/arguement that never ceases to end or stop annoying me.  Do I think the originals should be included just to appease the die-hard & [really] old-schools fans? Yes.  Do I care if they're not included? No.  No I don't love every little thing that's been added, however I do appreciate him cleaning up some of the special effects - so I don't let those things bother me.  I don't agree that every change he made was for the better, but it's a great saga - deal with it.  Once he's made up his mind he's likely not going to change it over a bunch of negative amazon reviews.

To add onto what another reviewer wrote, if you prefer the originals in their 'original' state then you prefer their 'original and poorer' quality.  And if that's the case, why do you need these on bluray?  They already exist on dvd, so just get those *and* save yourself some cash.",1294358400,999,985,4.403314917127072
7215423,4,B00YI71PN2,"Prequel (I-III) set = 3 discs
Original (IV-VI) set = 3 discs
Complete Saga set = 6 discs + 3 bonus discs = 9 discs total (best deal)

Total bonus features according to bluray.com = 30 hours. Maybe Lucas can throw in clips of Clone Wars and Ewok Adventure in the extras.

An original (1977 theatrical) release would be nice. But Lucas says 1997 is the better version, as he intended with the updates more consistent w/ the prequel storyline. He also states it's more feasible to clean up the relatively cleaner 1997 in achieving the best high def results, than to go backwards to remaster the 1977 print aging in a warehouse archive for 34+ years.  Besides, we do have the original already: the dvd (2004 limited ed.) and laser disc. Maybe we can at least ask that the deleted parts from the original be placed in the bonus section (a more reasonable request). He has `til Sept `11 to consider our demands. However, any push by Lucas/Fox, would probably opt in the direction for 3D release (going forwards, not backwards).

Considering Peter Jackson's LOR trilogy marketing gouging (and failure), would it be worth waiting around years for the other version, and then pay double, to cover the costly blu clean up of 2 separate prints? And unless blu ray players have the technology to select different versions on the same disc, for now we'd have to grit our teeth and embrace this as Lucas' complete, final, and only blu release of SW.  Rejoice, it's been a long wait just for this.

{addendum 01/16/11 below}
Lucas/Fox do listen to public's demands and read amazon.com pre-reviews by us, just like other producers/studios who then tailor their releases.  Sept '11 is a long time folks.  Hang in there.  I'm sure he wants everybody happy.

7215424,5,B00YI71PN2,"This is the greatest news that I have ever heard over Blu-ray. Now September 2011 is my Christmas for 2011, when I hold the box set of Star Wars. Soon as I heard the news of it from YouTube VIA CES 2011..... I knew blu-ray.com will have it's link up and running for the pre order and I was right. And just click Pre-order. Now over here lots of people are speculating about the quality of it going to be and the early episodes  transfers will look bad. Now let us not forget this.... we are here talking about THX right. All leading products want their products certified by THX. Even Avatar Blu-ray/DVD was certified by THX.

Now let us not forget that this is a Gorge Lucas production and he owns the THX studios world wide. If he messes up his own production  he will be putting his name and his company/studio/reputation of  THX on-the-line. Therefore I am very well sure all episodes of  Star Wars transfer to Blu-ray will be one of the best that we can find around.  For those who are wondering please remember that you read this article when/if you buy it and that I was right. This will be the best transfer on Blu-ray from a very old production. Because they/he wanted to do it right only they took this long. Not like the Gladiator release. At a interview years ago, he said it takes like good Nine Months to finish One Episode of the transfer to Blu-ray. Finally Star Wars and Avatar will be Two of those titles where you want to show off your Home Theater for some time. And most of all it will be a THX certified Blu-ray DVD. I won't have any doubts off the quality of this Box Set. It is a Five Star And a Two Thumbs up production from me. Thanks you all for reading my post.",1294272000,11,1689,4.246105919003115
7215425,5,B00YI71PN2,"I'm sure the picture and sound for these will be top-notch.  I've abandoned all hope for a re-release on Blu-ray of the originals.  I never really minded the addition of things to the OT, but the modifications were, IMO, generally for the worse.  See the title for this review.  That being said, I'll buy the full set opening day, and probably start with Empire, and it will be killer.",1294272000,12,385,4.536231884057971

7215427,5,B00YI71PN2,"I don't understand why there's obsession and whining and hate over not getting the originals.  If you're the kind of person who can't appreciate Star Wars unless you've got see-through speeders/X-Wings, horrible skipping lightsabers, and matte paintings that are obviously matte paintings, well then, you really don't need that stuff in hi-def, do you?  The originals are on DVD, you can buy them (on the cheap, no less,) and see Star Wars just the way you remember it - the way it's ""supposed"" to be.

I grew up with the originals, don't get me wrong.  Return of the Jedi is the first movie I remember seeing ever.  I watched the crap out of my VHS tapes - and many of the changes needed to happen.  Luke igniting his lightsaber, for instance, for the first time - that cut was horrible.  I was in high school when they released the special editions, and I remember thinking, ""man, I hope they fixed that.""  Almost.  Then, when they released the DVDs again around 2005, they finally got that part right.  I like that they tinker with it.  I missed the yub yub song at the end of Jedi at first, but the flute section John Williams wrote for it is beautiful.  I can't imagine watching A New Hope without seeing Han confront Jabba, or Empire without the gorgeous detailing added to Cloud City.

Now, go ahead and say this review wasn't helpful.  Scream at me about how Han shot first and how Jedi Rocks was horrible.  I will happily be clicking the pre-order link while you're doing that, and crossing my fingers that George has something special in store - maybe even MORE footage added in, further tweaks to the graphics, and more digital goodness.  THAT's the reason we need blu-ray.",1294272000,128,1684,4.600671140939597
7215428,5,B00YI71PN2,"Either you want this or you don't. Either you enjoy the Star Wars films or you don't. I don't want to hear any of this nonsense about the ""originals"" or the special editions. WHATEVER! It's Georges baby and you are either on board, Jar Jar and all, or you are not. Honestly any reviewing sword casting aspersions on the new editions are semantics at best. If this came out when you were 7 you'd have imploded from excitement. Even negatives like Han fired first has become an entire joke industry in and of itself and who knows, maybe George intended it and he is light years ahead of all of us. Either way, he changed my childhood, my direction in life, and even my kids lives with interesting fantasy and hero adventures. Seriously, there are an entire galaxy, (far far away) of things to complain about before you start complaining about Star Wars. We all know the films. We all know the quality will be top notch. He invented THX Sound for crying out loud. I doubt the set will be below par. And if by some phantom chance they are lame, I'll be happy to come back here and amend my speculation. I love those that are down on Amazon for allowing reviews before the product is out. You guys just don't get business. What is going on here right now before the release is called ""buzz"" and it's a retailers dream scenario that a bunch of nerds would all congregate and debate the minutia of an upcoming product.

this thing is STILL #1 in pre-orders on Amazon. I'm willing to bet every single one of you who one-starred this monstrosity, this mockery of what's supposed to be Star Wars, will end up buying it at some point in the future. You just can't help yourselves. Lucas does what he wants because he KNOWS after 34 years, he has you all by the balls. Star Wars culture is so ingrained in your minds that no matter what he does, you will still fork over your cash eventually. Eventually he will add in a scene where Palpatine looks directly into the screen, breaks the fourth wall, and says, ""You, like the millions of others, are now...LUCAS'.""

And you al will whine. And moan. And complain. And go on a one-star rampage.

7215446,5,B00YI71PN2,"WARNING! Before I go into the review, I want to give a friendly warning. This Star Wars Complete Saga set has NEVER been officially released on DVD format by the distributor. This set is ONLY officially available on Blu-ray format, NOT DVD. If you are purchasing this set on DVD format, you are being swindled and you'll end up receiving a BOOTLEG, an illegitimate product. That explains why many reviewers of the ""DVD"" version report that the visual and audio qualities vary between the films, the packaging is flimsy, fragile, or even already broken on arrival, and the discs themselves have wrinkled art and lots of scratches. Don't be fooled by listings that are fulfilled by Amazon. Just because it's fulfilled by Amazon doesn't mean it's a legitimate product. ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" only means that the product is shipped by Amazon, but Amazon is not the one selling it; it's a third-party seller. And because these are bootlegs, the quality between the bootlegs will vary. You might've gotten an ok bootleg, but most times, it'll be terrible. Just a warning so that you guys don't get ripped off. If you would rather have these films on DVD, these are the products you want to get. They are official releases of the films on DVD format. The links to the official DVD versions are below. They come in a combo pack.

This is the quintessential set for Star Wars fans! The Blu-ray transfers sound amazing and look gorgeous. While the price may be a bit steep, it is absolutely worth it. It comes with a total of 9 discs, one for each film and three dedicated just for additional special features. The amount of special features is astronomical! If you ever wanted to delve into the universe of the Star Wars films, this is the best you can get.

The packaging itself is simple, but elegant. The cover art is embossed, holographic, and attractive. The films come in a standard Blu-ray case which is enclosed in a cardboard sleeve. Thankfully, each disc has its own space. The discs are not stacked on top of each other, but instead are placed on ""plastic pages"". I'm sure the pictures can express that better than I can. In addition, the set comes with a small booklet entitled ""Guide to the Galaxy"". This booklet is simply a guide to all of the special features. It will come in handy if you ever feel a bit overwhelmed trying to navigate the special features. Highly recommended!",1533168000,7,3053,5.671772428884026

7215455,5,B00YI71PN2,"I can confirm that although there is neither information on the box about it nor inside the box, the 12 disc DVD version of this box set contains the theatrical release versions of the original trilogy on the ""bonus disc"" for each film (discs 8, 10, and 12). As far as I've been able to find, these DVDs are the last time the theatrical versions of the original trilogy made it to home video.

I can also confirm that they are so, so, so much better than the re-edited special edition versions that Lucas mucked up in the 90s or even the blu-ray versions released a few years ago. The original versions flow so much better without the unnecessary scenes that were shoe-horned in later and there are also terrible cgi additions throughout the new versions that stand out from the backgrounds so much that they jar you right out of your movie experience.

(I actually still have the bus of the first 3 movies (well, 3-4-5, not 1-2).... in any case, you get the whole saga, to see in sorry order 1-6 or in release order 3-4-5, 1-2-6..

7215531,3,B00YI71PN2,"The cheap plastic DVD case was smashed up and in pieces when it arrived, but... the discs are there.

I think the main let down here is that you would expect by now (2018) that something like this retailing for $50+ would be the highest quality possible. However, I was a little surprised to realized that things are digitally remastered as best as possible; the nature of the films (all six included here) themselves are interesting due to the fact that all were produced across four decades. So, this collection reflects this matter of fact.

I selected three stars because, while watching with a family member who had never seen these movies, an ""UNABLE TO READ DISC"" message appeared right at the climax/ending of the movie. And with this classic trilogy, one bad disc spoils it all... I later realized that this isn't entirely due to the DVDs, but possibly the player, and back to the simple fact that the older movies are not going to render with 100% quality..

Even still, the product did not measure up to overall expectations with regards to quality... I am revoking my originally poorer rating/review because the company DID reply to me and is in fact legitimate, something I was forced to call into question when trying to enjoy the products. I will end all this by reminding us that there are better quality options out there, and some, other than blu-ray, I believe.",1525564800,4,1380,4.717842323651452

I also have loved the bonus feature disks and there are three of those as well as all of the six Star Wars episodes. Unfortunately, these are not the original versions without the added changes by Lucas, but these are still excellent of the ones that are often available. This company also sent paperwork that was with the disks that if there was problem they would make it right. So far a safe set to buy. Plays here in SLC, Utah.

All the movies are in great condition. They play better on a blue ray player than an Xbox, just for future reference. I thought the quality  as fuzzy until I watched it by chance on my blue ray player. It must have something to do with the Xbox processor. But whatever, they're great!

It was shippEd very, very well. It was in a box in a bad in another bag and I had to get out a knife to rip into it. The case was unharmed and it was a beautiful case. I do not keep thdont cases or I would take a picture, but it was spectacular.

So the quality of those is pretty good so I'm revising my rating to 4, the pictures on each of the discs is of poor quality, leading me to wonder about the manufacturing, if they really were liscened by Lucas or ???, But I choose to say yes just disappointing that the images on the case and sleeve are nice, but not the disc images.

7215704,1,B00YI71PN2,"Although it might be a very high quality fake, what I received seems a counterfeit product. Back cover looks like someone scanned and reprinted some shiny/reflective graphics with limited success. I did some research and bootlegs of this addition are rampant... google it. I see now that Amazon reviews and customer images are not helpful. Amazons algorithmic product matching results in a mix of reviews and pics from two different blu-ray releases 4 yrs apart, plus a smattering of DVD format and pictures of peoples kids, and fishing trips; all lumped together. Now that Ive looked hard, I cant find any evidence that 20th Century Fox released Star Wars: The Complete Saga on DVD, only on blu-ray in 2011 and 2015. Given the studios rerelease of the same material in a cheaper (and easier to copy) package, I don't fell bad for them, but I feel bad for you. I don't want you to waste 60 bucks. May the force be with you.

PS: if you're looking for blu-ray Complete Saga, search for 2011 release.  Looks like a book rather than a case and its hard to fake.  Looking for DVD format, search 2006, its two box sets. Not so secret side note:  youll find non-special edition theatrical releases of the original trilogy in the bonus material of the 2006 versions.",1516320000,85,1259,4.683257918552036

Would have been nice to get the Blu-ray versions of it came with all of the original stuff but I have heard that it doesn't so I stuck with this.

- Episode VI - Return of the Jedi - DVD 1 looks like one, however the content is of Episode IV - The New Hope.
- Episode VI disc 2 is as choppy and grainy as watching a moldy VHS: gray pixels all over, scenes are in and out of focus, storm troupers in formation move wavily like water vaporizing.

The case was damaged during delivery, so the plastic slip cover for the paper insert is all that's holding the case together. I was disappointed by that. I would have bought at a box store but they spider-wrap cases really tight and damage them also. The disc art leaves much to be desired. It feels like a blur filter was applied or almost like they are bootleg inkjet labels.

7215841,5,B00YI71PN2,"I've been wanting to buy Star Wars: The Complete Saga on Blu-Ray for a while now, and I finally did! Unlike other editions of Star Wars, this complete Blu-Ray pack comes with all the films in the Original Trilogy and the prequels, two whole discs for bonus features, and a completely separate disc for spoofs and other stuff. Also, the main menu for each disc matches, where the main menu of other editions of Star Wars may be different, another reason you may want this rather than buying them separately. The only thing I don't like about it is that the original trilogy in it isn't the old version; it's just the remakes. For me, though, the fact that Disney's name is not on the case makes up for it. The packaging is also nice, with one of those fancy boxes the case goes into with Vader obviously on it. If you haven't watched Star Wars for whatever reason, or you're a Star Wars fan like me thinking of getting the saga all in one place, I recommend this to you.

For starters, I only had the prequel DVDs and nothing else, so the visuals are great. Say what you want about overused CGI, but as special effects go, they worked fantastically since they're in a fantasy/sci-fi setting. There were some things that I actually preferred in CGI, such as Yoda appearances in the prequels which were very well done and detailed. Other things I liked was how neatly it wrapped every special feature up in 1 disc. It was a major convenience factor to have everything right there for me to look at.

Now, some things I wasn't a fan of: I was actually looking if they had Blu-Rays of the originals in their original format but sadly couldn't find any. I would've preferred the original/untouched releases of the films without so much of the editing/changes that we all know and don't need to readdress. Still, for a boxset of all 6 episodes (OT/PT), I got it at a great deal and am very proud to finally own all the prequel/original trilogies.",1506643200,2,1169,4.5933014354066986

Attack of the Clones is the most painful to try to get through though while Revenge of the Sith and Return of the Jedi are things that happened, enjoyable enough depending on my mood.

I'm not going to go into the content of the films. If you are on this webpage, you probably already know the stories. You probably already have your opinions of which  of the 6 films you like, and which ones you watch grudgingly to complete the marathon.

The point of my review is that if you are a ""Star Wars"" fan, this is the DVD set you want. Why? (A) You get all 6 films in one package. (A)  ""The Phantom Menace"" (B) ""Attack of the Clones"" (C) ""Revenge of the Sith"" (D) ""A New Hope"" (E) ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (F) ""Return of the Jedi"" ALSO, AND EQUALLY IMPORTANT, you are given both the re-edited AND the original and unaltered original theatrical trilogy. Whichever version you prefer, you get it in this DVD set.

Quick comparing of the popular orders. (A) ""Numerical Order"" 1,2,3,4,5,6  This is a good choice. This order presents the events in logical order and gives you a well written story.  Darth Vader's childhood, troubled teenage years, his fall to the dark side, his rise to power, his redemption and finally his death.  The main disadvantage is that you have to accept a 20 + year step back in special effect time between 3 and 4.  (Although 4 is often hailed as the best.) So this may not be an issue for you.

(B) ""Production Order"" 4,5,6,1,2,3 Some people like this. It has its logic. Some people consider 4,5,6 the question films and 1,2,3 the answer films. Also, this leads to cinematic continuity. The main disadvantage here is that you end in the middle of the story. (Especially when the end of Part 3 makes it look like a whole new chapter is beginning.)

(C) ""Machete Order"" 4,5,1,2,3,6 This approach tries to keep cinematic continuity in tact while at the same time putting ""Return of the Jedi"" last. While I prefer 'Numerical Order,'  this approach has a special advantage. You get to see the hero's journey in 4 and 5. Then you go back and see the villain's path in 1,2, and 3 before the final showdown in 6. The one disadvantage here is that you end up with a 6 hour flashback in the middle of ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi.""

So whether you prefer the older original films (of 4, 5,and 6) or the edited newer versions, you will find what you want in this package.  As I said, I'm not the biggest fan of ""Star Wars.""  But knowing the advantages and disadvantages of the 3 orders is probably the best idea. No one order is going to work for everyone. Numerical Order, Production Order, and Machete Order all work for different people.",1501545600,55,2627,4.398760330578512

I have been wanting the digital copies of episodes 1-6 for a while.  When I saw all 6 for $80, I decided to buy them.  I saw that they were part of Disney Movies Anywhere, which is exactly what I was looking for, since I already have other Star Wars movies at DMA.  I've been trying to get all of my digital copies together to make it easier for the family to watch them.  Beware, not all 6 movies are part of DMA.  That's right, you get 5 of the 6 movies that you can watch anywhere (iTunes, Vudu, etc.).  However, Episode 4 (the original Star Wars), is ONLY able to be watched at Amazon Video.  So now I have movies that are only viewable at iTunes, and ones that are only viewable at Vudu, and now, Amazon Video.  This is crazy.  Can you imagine, buying a DVD at Best Buy, and only able to play it on a DVD player bought at Best Buy?  No.  And that should be the case for digital copies.  It shouldn't matter where I buy it, I should be able to watch it anywhere (except for exclusives, of course, but that is not the case here).",1497744000,12,1118,4.050228310502283

7216013,3,B00YI71PN2,"I enjoy the set. My five year son and I watch the series for Christmas together. It is a fun set to watch; only I'm not sure if the rating should actually be pg. there was a few sex slave scenes in the return of the Jedi. Being as I wasent even born yet for them to be in theaters; I don't know if this was original content or added, but since the scene looks a little cgi, it would have been ok to leave that out. It gets a little interesting trying to explain why there's a half naked green women with chains on her neck like a dog, being jerked around by its master worm. As asked by a five year old. Other then that, I guess it's your standard sci-fi, a ridiculous story that has theme of destructive warfare for peace all through out, for galaxy. I'm not really sure how the story got so big with so many fans? It's all war and sexist behavior, disguised as a rebellion against the authority. Humans getting light sabered in half, hands getting amputated. Human Deception is it's core them.  I guess as Americans we are very much at war with ourselves as much as the authority and the worldly inhabitants .",1495497600,,1111,4.215962441314554

Lucas committed a cardinal sin, by remaking these movies and not letting us decide if we want original recipe or extra crispy. Han fired the only shot in the bar, and many more changes. including the music added up to an experience that had me saying ""That is not right!"" many, many times through the movie. I returned it. That alone was a HUGE distraction.

If you ever saw ""The New Hope"", ""The Empire Strikes Back"", and ""The Return of the Jedi"" in their original format, you will be amazed at how much the feel of the movie has changed.

The price may seem high, but comes out to less than $12 per film, which is SUBSTANTIALLY less than purchasing all these films (plus the extras) on their own. Well worth the price.

Word of advice, I love to crank it up extra high just before the opening music (which is EPIC), and then enjoy it as my childhood comes roaring back with a scream of TIE fighter and rebel X-Wing engines! I suggest you do the same!  :D",1494201600,,724,4.340740740740741

7216066,5,B00YI71PN2,"I had avoided the Special Editions for so long that I didn't even know which movie Yoda first appeared in, so I finally broke down and renewed my geek cred by getting the complete saga and giving it a complete watch. After not seeing the original trilogy for decades(I don't even know if I watched V & VI all the way through as a child), I've fallen in love with the series again. The CGI creatures were definitely jarring to see in a 1977 movie, as was Han's sudden head movement in the ""Han shot first"" scene, but it was a decent trade-off for HD video with remastered colors and great audio. This is without a doubt the best version to get, despite the edits. If you want a less-edited version, you'll have to take a noticeable drop in video quality. For me, the video quality really added to my enjoyment of the movies.
As for the prequels... I hadn't seen the prequels since they were in the theater, so I was seeing them with pretty fresh eyes. I figured beforehand that people just hated the prequels out of nostalgia for the original trilogy. Watching all 6 movies over the course of a single week, not having much nostalgia built up for the original trilogy, I feel the side-by-side comparison gives a very un-biased view of how good the prequels are...... I much preferred the original trilogy. Wow, the prequels weren't that great. I wanted to like them, but when viewed right after the original trilogy, the writing and directing was much better in the original trilogy. Still worth having the prequel discs, though, for completion's sake.

And a side note:
This set is the reason I finally got decent speakers for my TV. The TV's built-in speakers just couldn't handle the sheer awesomeness of the sound.",1492387200,3,1717,4.592833876221499

Even after Disney bought the product, they still shill the updated, manipulated, ""special editions"" that have been ""specially updated"" over time to make them worse and worse and worse. The sound has been altered, the effects have been changed, the characters are twisted, to fit a profile that never existed. The great story continues without manipulation of the original content. The original Oscar winning sound and music and effects that have been altered to placate a new variant incomparable to the movies we saw and loved. I highly recommend you find the original movies in their theatrical form, in any way you can. George Lucas admitted his turn to the Dark Side many years ago, and the new folks running the game are doing a great job. But don't be twisted by what's right and what's easy.

7216172,3,B00YI71PN2,"The three-star review is not so much for the movies (which pretty much everyone has an opinion they won't be swayed from anyway), but the special features. This product has each movie on a separate disc, with three additional special features discs. Honestly, the whole reason I wanted this set was FOR the special features. I'm a huge costume nerd, and the costumes in Episodes I, II, and III are all incredible, particularly considering how much time was spent constructing them vs. how much screen time they got. I was also eager to see deleted scenes I'd seen bits of or heard about online (mostly scenes from Episode II that focus on Padme). Unfortunately, NONE of those scenes made the quite considerable list of special features this set offers.
To begin with, the special features menus are a bit tedious to operate. The features are split between the prequels and the originals, so with the prequels you chose from I, II, or III, from which point you chose what location (Naboo, Tatooine, etc) you wanted to focus on. This is weird right off the bat, because the story moves between locations. So, for Episode I, instead of having two options for Naboo--the beginning of the story and the end--there's just one. This would be fine, except it feels like there could have been so much MORE we could have been shown, but weren't because they had to cram two different parts of the story in.
Honestly, all of the special features were just kind of perplexing. From which costumes they chose to showcase vs which ones they didn't (no celebration dress from Episode I. No rainbow dress from Episode II. I couldn't believe that.), to the deleted and extended scenes they included, or the fact that there were locations that didn't have any additional scenes at all...it felt very lackluster.
This is not the be-all end-all compendium of Star Wars movies and features. It almost feels like this is filler. This is what you get if you have each individual movie, with each individual movie's special features, but still want more. Considering the price, that's really disappointing.
On the plus side, if you don't care much for in-depth special features but enjoy a sampling of them, and enjoy featurettes, this is a good choice.
I will say the packaging is wonderful. The case is essentially a book, with each disc getting its own little spread and a guide tucked into the back pocket to help you navigate the special features (to a certain extent). There's something that's just really satisfying about flipping through the pages to pick which one you want to watch.",1486684800,,2568,4.799097065462754

7216183,5,B00YI71PN2,"I just want to start by saying that this is about the 12-disc DVD box set with Darth Vader on the front. It contains all six episodes of Star Wars as well as bonus features for each one.
While I believe this set was released in 2015, none of the 2011 Blu-Ray edits made it here. Yoda in The Phantom Menace remains a puppet, and Vader never yells ""Nooo!"" in Return of the Jedi. Personally, I was relieved.

The originals (IV, V, and VI) are in their 2004 remastered versions, but my favorite thing about this set is that, on the bonus discs, you get the original theatrical releases of the films. Now, I remember hearing a lot of complaints about the standalone DVD releases (not this one) with this feature saying that it was just the laserdisc version with letterbox format. I don't know if that is what is in this box set, but it looks like standard widescreen to me. No part of the screen seems to be cut off, and the video and sound quality are about as good as VHS if not a little better. No major flaws exist other than a slightly shaky screen that you will barely even notice. The contrast is fine. Everything looks good. The sound is a little muffled compared to the remastered versions, but that's a petty complaint as well.

I definitely think this set is definitely worth getting. It's great to own all of these wonderful movies and to see the original versions before all of the edits came in.

If you're thinking about it, I would say just get it.

P.S. Sorry, I'm not the best reviewer, photographer, or disc sorter. Lol. Just want to help. Hope this helps some of you make a decision. You won't regret it.",1486166400,928,1620,4.372093023255814

7216225,4,B00YI71PN2,"I've just barely started watching these disc, after having received the shipment yesterday.  I got through Ep. IV last night and was impressed overall.  I am a Star Wars fan, but not obsessive about it.  I liked the overall quality of the remaster and how Blu-Ray made this 40yr old movie look pretty darn good.  Though, I did notice some unevenness between scenes and some did look better than others.  I also noticed some of the effects updates, which I didn't think took away from the story, but were noticeably better than what 1970's technology would allow.

The biggest frustration for me, and I noticed it's true for all 6 movies, is that the only audio option is DTS 6.1 (outside of commentary tracks and the descriptive audio track).  This would be fine if you're always watching with a surround sound setup.  But, watching it with just TV speakers (as I was last night), I noticed that the sound quality was lacking a bit.  I really had to turn things up to hear the dialogue at a reasonable volume.  Sounds effects and such seemed OK, but the dialogue was much quieter.  I presume that on a surround sound set-up, this may sound better and I'll test that down the road.  As a comparison however, I switched the audio track to the 2.0 Descriptive audio version and I noticed that the dialogue was much louder and more clear.  Would have been nice if a standard 2.0 stereo mix was included in addition to the 6.1 option and the others.",1484784000,,1444,4.550387596899225

I grew up with Star Wars.  I was born in late '77, so I have never known a world before Star Wars.  I wore Princess Leia buns in my hair in kindergarten, I bonded with my now-Husband over Star Wars, and I'm even currently wearing an R2-D2 shirt.  We have several versions of the Original Trilogy already: VHS, Laserdisc, the first DVD release (which was actually released on our wedding day, so it was a wedding gift).  But we didn't have any of the prequels.  (Say what you will about the prequel trilogy, but I remember the breathless anticipation when the first trailers for Phantom Menace came out)

The movies are crisp and bright, the sound is brilliant.  The parody reels were very Robot Chicken and Family Guy heavy, and I was surprised to see Hardware Wars didn't make it onto the list (IIRC, it was the very first Star Wars parody).

The new case feels like something more suited to a cheap console game than a high-end collector's edition anything.  And the case was shattered and falling apart!  The plastic used for the case is not suitable to protect anything.

After returning it I looked into other options for cases/collections/etc.  Only to learn that the 'theatrical' versions simply are not available on Blu-Ray and the DVD versions are out of print so collectors are charging up the wazoo.

So, I give up.  I will buy Star Wars when they have a decent collection with decent art at a decent price.  The end.",1484611200,2,763,4.8076923076923075

When I went to watch the Attack of the Clones DVD it literally froze I don't know how many times, luckily I was able to fix the solution by changing some settings on my DVD/Blu-Ray player, but it was a huge pain in the butt.

7216240,2,B00YI71PN2,"Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray]

PROS:  Episodes I, II and III are excellent in Blu-ray quality, clarity and sharpness.

CONS:  Episodes IV, V, and VI have a heavy graininess during any of the panoramic scenes (desert, snow, etc.)... with episode IV A New Hope being the worst. Many dark scenes look over-saturated. The new upgraded inserts by Lucas do not color match the original scenes.  Episodes IV, V, and VI fall far short of the sharpness and clarity that appears throughout all three episodes of I, II and III. Also this Saga does NOT contain the original theatrical versions of episodes IV, V and VI.

The ""second""/first one was good, but the acting by the grown Anakin Skywalker is too bad to be endured in the 2nd/5th and 3rd/6th, so they didn't see those.

Yes...Lucas made some questionable decisions with certain films, but SW is HIS BABY (well...Disney's now...lol).  The movies simply look and sound amazing and with the Original Trilogy...rekindled my love of SW as a child.

Amazon Video holds all 6 movies separately and bonus material for each movie separate from that.  If your Amazon account is linked with Disney Movies Anywhere, you can have all but the original movie (Ep 4) carry over into that app as well (Disney did not get the movie rights when they purchased Lucas films from 20th Century Fox - it is still viewable thru Amazon - stating the obvious as this billed as a 6 movie set).  I also automatically got 750 (150 times 5) Disney Movie Reward Points with my linked account.  I removed one star as I felt the digital version should have been available with the Blu-Ray or at least had a discounted way for the hard copy owners to include the digital version as well.  I'm sure Disney will be laughing all the way to the bank with my 65 dollars, so I don't expect their feelings to be hurt any.  Obviously I love the source material and already had these movies in all but laser disc formats, so I won't be one to get too technical with audio and video as I would likely watch in blu-ray when I want theater grade stuff.

****BUT, the solution: if you view the set in amazon you can click on each movie individually and add them INDIVIDUALLY to your watchlist. Then, go into amazon player through your watchlist and select the movie you want to watch.

7216328,4,B00YI71PN2,"I purchased this Blu Ray set on its release in 2011, and have enjoyed it many times over since then. So why am I reviewing it now? Well to cut a long story short, I just recently upgraded my TV from a 1080i plasma that I bought in 2005 (man, did that thing last!) to a 4K Ultra High-Def 55 inch screen. The first discs I wanted to try out on it were, of course, my beloved Star Wars saga. I'm glad to tell you that I was NOT disappointed.

The picture quality on these Blu-Rays is simply phenomenal. I found myself catching details that I had never noticed before, thanks to the sheer clarity of the image. There's no grain and very little in the way of special effects blocking and matte lines. If I had to pick a ""worst bit' it's the expanded Mos Eisley scene from Episode IV, simply because the special effects as rendered back in 1996 don't hold up as well in that scene as they do in the others. Contrast that with the assault on the Death Star, however, and the difference is night and day.

Some people are going to hate the fact that these are the special editions, rather than the theatrical cuts that purists love so much. Personally, I wish they'd released both versions side by side with an option to play either, but hey, that's never been how Lucasfilm has worked. Rumors are that Ultra 4K editions of them are in the works, something that I find very easy to believe, but in the meantime, this is the best that's available. And make no mistake, these movie look (and sound) incredibly good.

So why only four stars? Basically, the extras. There is some great material here, and the deleted scenes are intriguing, but so much has been left out that we have seen in earlier releases. A great case in point is the superb documentary ""Empire of Dreams,"" but there are far too many others to mention here. Where is the truly definitive, exhaustive Star Wars set that we'd all like to see? Sadly this isn't it, but it is the closest you'll get for the time being.",1482624000,7,1972,4.353260869565218

Before the most recent one came out (please don't ask which number it is!!) last winter, he wanted us all to enjoy the magic again, especially his 13 y/o granddaughter who's very appreciative of sci-fi.  I watched my husband who can't ever find ANYTHING when asked, start producing all these different DVD's and even VIDEOTAPES(!!) of all the episodes.  When I laughingly reminded him that we no longer had a VCR, he went into yet another hiding place and produced a half functioning VCR (played but wouldn't record) that I thought had gone to Charity ages ago!!

There is no scratch or smudge on the DVD, it's just a data flaw that causes that section to cease playing. We had to carefully skip past that part of the DVD to watch the rest of Part I.

7216408,5,B00YI71PN2,"A great deal too awesome to turn down.  Now all we need is a 4K version, then an 8K, then a 16K, etc.  Nevertheless this set looks great.  However some die hards do not like the HD look imposed on 35 mm because you can see all the artifacts during special effects.  I think the producers of this set has done a great job in editing and mastering the video for optimum viewing.  The type of monitor/tv you are using will also have an affect on visual quality (i.e. Samsung vs Sony, etc.).",1478044800,4,487,4.193548387096774

Bait and switch by Amazon and I'm not happy. I could've bought this at Vudu and still have access to the bonus content. Amazon Video sucks!!!

Update: I left feedback for Amazon and to my amazement they refunded my purchase price in full explaining that thay can't control what the content provider restricts or not.

I never got into the saga much, really never watching any of the movies. I began watching these with her to see what the fuss was all about and I must say I was blown away! It sort of helps having a 4K TV. The story line is something I can sink my teeth into. As for all the comments about this or that missing from the original or George Luca flubbing the editing for BD, I cannot really comment on all that but I do know that the late 1970's graphics are definitely better on BD and 4K. I love the added commentary and special features and it is great seeing all of the actors from back then to today. Overall, according to my wife, it is an amazing buy. I suspect we will be watching all of these on a binge. Now my 5 year old grandson is enjoying these!",1474848000,,912,3.989071038251366

I know we can stream it on all of the devices, but the idea was to watch it on tv.  I've checked about cancelling the order within 24 hrs.  I can't anymore since I streamed less than 5 minutes of the video looking for an option to download.  This product needs to detail whether you can download it up front or not.

So then I did some research, and found that as long as the discs contain the ABC hexagons, it will work on any player.  I am sooo happy to have found these.  This was all 6 blu ray discs for the price of 3 discs at my local blue store!!!  Its such a great find and savings.  Perfect for the Star Wars Fan!!",1473984000,5,666,4.32258064516129

7216548,5,B00YI71PN2,"Dear viewers of the ""Star Wars"" saga, both old and new

Since the release of Episode III, people have often wondered ""Should I watch these movies in Episode Order (I, II, III, IV, V, VI) or release order (IV, V, VI, then I, II, III). However, both of these orders are flawed.

Why is ""Episode Order"" Flawed?
-----------This is the order that George Lucas intends for you to watch it. George Lucas wants you to think that the pre-Ep VII films are about Anakin, when really it's about Luke's journey of defeating the Empire and rescuing his father. But watching it this way is boring! It completely ruins the surprise of Darth Vader being Luke Skywalker's father! Before ""The Sixth Sense"", this was considered to be the greatest plot twist of all time! It was a plot twist that nobody saw coming. The prequel trilogy was meant to be ""backstory"" for the OT.

Flaws of ""Release Order""
----------Many people will tell you that this is the way you're supposed to watch the Saga. But this method is ruined by one single shot at the very end of ""Return of the Jedi"" (Episode VI), where the ghost of Anakin Skywalker appears, played by Hayden Christensen and not Sebastian Shaw (the actor portraying Vader in that moment when Luke pulls off his mask). And if you're showing Episode VI to someone who hasn't seen the prequel trilogy yet, this will only confuse them because they will have no idea who he is!

{Side note: in the original 1983 release of ""Return of the Jedi"", the Anakin Skywalker ghost was portrayed by Sebastian Shaw. But just before the release of Episode III, George Lucas replaced the ghost of Sebastian Shaw with the ghost of Hayden Christensen. There's a theory that Lucas did this because, ""from a certain point of view"", Anakin Skywalker truly ""died"" when he became Darth Vader and embraced the Dark Side.

Theoretically, if you obtain a copy of the original theatrical version of ROTJ, then you could do release order. But even WITH that version of ROTJ, I still recommend a different order...}

So, what exactly is the best method to view these Star Wars movies? Well, here's how it goes: Episodes IV and V, then II and III, then VI. Yes, Episode I was left out for a reason, and I'll explain later.

Why is ""The Machete Order"" best, and why do you skip Episode I?
---This order preserves the emotional impact of the surprise twist that Vader is Luke's father
---Episode V ends on a cliffhanger: Luke is wrestling with the knowledge of who is father is, Han Solo is frozen in carbonite and Boba Fett has taken his body away, and the Empire has hit the rebellion hard! A new viewer to Star Wars does not get to see the fate of these characters until AFTER watching the episodes II & III

Why skip Episode I
---Well, putting aside the various flaws of the movie itself (Jar-Jar's antics, Anakin being an annoying child, the overly long pod-racing sequence), when it comes to the overall story of Star Wars saga, Episode I is probably the most empty. The entire ""trade dispute"" plot is presented clumsily and incoherently, and it doesn't have much impact on Anakin's story. And many of the major characters who die and/or go away are insignificant or replaced immediately: Darth Maul is replaced by Count Dooku, Chancellor Valorum is replaced by Chancellor Palpatine, and Obi-Wan's master plays no other significant role in series. At the end of episode I, EVERYTHING is in place for the Episodes II & III, and those two movies are where the REAL story begins: various systems leaving the Republic, which lead to the Clone Wars (which IS mentioned in the OT). This story is much easier to understand.

To sum it up, you can understand Episodes II & III without seeing Episode I. But...by skipping Episode I, you actually create yet another ""plot twist"" to a new viewer: Darth Sidious (aka Palpatine aka THE FREAKING EMPEROR) is behind everything! It is only at the end of Episode II that we see that Count Dooku is working with Emperor Palpatine! THIS is how a new viewer, by watching the movies this way, learns that the Emperor is creating a major crisis so that he can have all the Galactic Government Power.

One possible flaw: we learn that Luke & Leia are twins prior to Episode VI, which somewhat spoils this as a surprise when it is revealed. But then again, when you return to Episode VI, the suspense is wondering when and how Luke & Leia will find out, and if Vader will ever know?!

Now...Return to Episode VI:
So now we come back to the conclusion of the saga. As I mentioned earlier, Episode V ends on a cliffhanger, a new viewer is now anxious to see how the stories of the Empire vs. The Rebellion, Han Solo, and Luke Skyalker and Vader will end. And also, a new viewer has now seen how Luke's father became Vader, and realizes that Anakin is still trapped in that suit, forced to do the Emperor's bidding. To a new viewer, the emotional experience of Episodes II & III will be fresh.

What is interesting about saving Episode VI for last is that we start seeing Luke in a whole different light. He's dressed in black (like his father). He FORCE CHOKES Jabba's guards (and remember, until this point we have ONLY seen Anakin/Vader use this power). And he's making threats to Jabba the Hutt. He's acting arrogant, and aggressive. This is now very suspenseful, because a new viewer will wonder: ""Is Luke turning to the dark side, like his father?!""

And then everything makes sense when you see the ghost of Hayden Christensen at the end. It makes Obi-Wan's statement that Luke's father truly ""died"" when he became Vader much more meaningful.

So, when you show ""Star Wars"" to your kids, or to someone who hasn't seen the movies before, THAT is the right order.

Update: Now that they're doing these ""Anthology"" movies, MAYBE you could treat Episode I like one of the ""Anthology"" series. But only AFTER completing the ""Machete Order"".",1469923200,,5861,4.622115384615385

Some of the actual discs in our set didn't work properly. Episodes I & II didn't want to play from the beginning, only from a few scenes in. The disc for Episode II was the most messed up, but that ended up not being a problem because the movie itself was not worth watching. The ""real"" trilogy don't pose any problems, however, so I will skip the hassle of exchanging and just keep the set.",1466035200,,667,4.170542635658915

7216655,5,B00YI71PN2,"So let me be clear from the start, I don't mind the prequels. I know I'm the minority and I recognize the flaws in story telling and execution but I also feel some of the same giddy excitement I felt watching the original trilogy as a child and I don't think that can be discounted.
I'll assume you know the story by now and I'll spare you the long-winded synopsis. I like this set as it gives me the 6 movies in one package which also has the bonus disc. I'm a big fan of the extras and I really appreciate having them here. Ultimately, you know what you're getting when you buy this set and the movies are just that much better when enjoyed on hi-def bluerays.",1465257600,,662,4.1796875

7216671,3,B00YI71PN2,"I still want the original versions so I didn't even care about this set when I saw the specs originally and I had no interest in getting the set at all. Things change though. My kiddos wanted to see more Star Wars films after watching my DVD versions (http://amzn.to/1Uxy4is) of Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi and the Blu-ray of The Force Awakens so I revisited this set and after reading the reviews from other users I decided to bite the bullet and pick it up. My main reason for getting this set was just picture and sound quality. Overall, I am indifferent to this collection, but the kids love it so I can't complain to much. If you are a die hard Star Wars fan then this is a set for you, and if you have kids curious about Star Wars then this is definitely a set for you. Just remember that no matter what you show your kids Star Wars first, then Empire Strikes Back. After that you can go to Return of the Jedi or try the Machete order.",1464825600,,964,4.216216216216216

7216678,3,B00YI71PN2,"The movies themselves are 10 star movies.. And the Amazon movie app works ok However. This set is not. The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because the first movie ""A New Hope"" and all the bonus features will not connect to the ""My Disney Movies Anywhere"" App but all the others will. What's up with that? I can watch all the Star Wars episodes but not the very first one???????? If anyone has a way to correct this let me know. If I had known this I would never have purchased this set. I have no idea if they will connect to any other movie collection software apps but this is a dissappointment.

Well, as Disney has done a good job making sure none of the Star Wars films are available for free streaming services like Prime or Netflix, you kinda have to buy the movies now if you want em in blue ray quality.  And if you are going to buy one . . . well you're probably going to buy them all so you might as well do it in this package.

Episode 5-  DVD ""Special Edition"" with  remastered audio and visual plus bonus disc with ""Original Theatrical Release"".
Episode 6-  DVD ""Special Edition"" with  remastered audio and visual plus bonus disc with ""Original Theatrical Release"".

DVD quality on 1-3 and 4-6 (remastered) are excellent quality if you run your dvd player through a HDMI cable.  Or I watch my videos on an X-box 360 with HDMI.  I do not have a Blu Ray, but understand DVD's do look better when ran through Blu Ray that has a HDMI cable.  The DVD's are not far from Blu Ray quality.
The original theatrical release DVD's (included in the set) are not that pretty to watch, the screen is smaller and fuzzier, but none the less are watchable.  I do prefer watching the newly enhanced versions though.  If I did have Blu Ray I'd might splurge and go for the latest Blu Ray complete saga.  But I am satisfied with the current quality of the DVDs on my 65"" LCD, w/ HDMI.  Overall I am satisfied with this set and the low price to get all 6.

I hate to say it, but the special effects were better in the original cuts than what Lucas did to them...and even the movies after.
Can I even get the original release versions of these movies on Bluray or HD?
Other than that, it's Star Wars...a movie legacy that tells the age old tale of good triumphing over evil and revolutionizing the special effects industry to make modern movies what they are today.",1461542400,3,660,4.601694915254237

For me, this collection stands out because of all the extras, commentary tracks, and bonus features. Each movie has one or two full length documentaries about the filming process (some have more), multiple short behind the scenes interviews, rough cuts, and features, and 1-2 commentary tracks with the cast and another with the higher ups of the film crew. It was because of these bonus features (all streamable through purchase on Amazon Instant Video or Disney Movies Anywhere) that led me to this particular product. It's a bit expensive but for all the bonus content and the ability to stream any of this anywhere made the price more than worth it. FYI. I only bought the digital collection of movies.

7216833,5,B00YI71PN2,"Oddly enough, this complete saga is quite a bit more expensive than buying the two trilogy's separately, but my OCD made me buy them all in one package.  Whatever...awesome movies anyway and since they all came in together, I was able to have a Star Wars weekend prior to seeing the newest one at the theater.  Great quality blu-ray!",1459641600,3,333,4.627118644067797
7216834,4,B00YI71PN2,"(This review is specifically for the ""Star Wars Complete Saga"" DVD set, 2016.) I got this much cheaper on ebay than Amazon, but I need to clarify exactly what's in it. This is just a re-boxing of all the 2-disc edition DVDs for episodes 1 thru 6 from a decade ago (previously only available separately.) It has NONE of the special features OR modern edits of today's Bluray sets (no digital Yoda in Phantom Menace.) The ONLY advantage in buying it is if you missed the original trilogy ""theatrical version"" bonus discs of 2005, which came and went very quickly (Han shoots first!) ...those are included in this set, but as before are not enhanced for widescreen (they're basically DVD versions of the 90's laser discs.) All in all - it is a nice, complete time capsule of Star Wars DVDs from days past (if that's what you're looking for) Just don't pay too much for it!",1459555200,29,869,4.54140127388535

Well...I guess I'll suck this up and roll with it! So far- I've only actually watched the first movie. And then realized more recently that we have the three most recent movies, already, on DVD in our massive movie collection (that nobody ever watches). But who doesn't like/love Star Wars? It's a classic! So hopefully I get my $100 worth. Eventually. And that I never again surf Amazon while drinking massive quantities of red wine.",1459296000,,579,4.979381443298969

7216998,2,B00YI71PN2,I give this two stars because amazon says my TV to computer hdmi set up is not in accordance  to the copywrite protection  they must uphold. So instead of the 1080p I paid for I'm getting only SD content. What is beyond infuriating  is all the HD TV shows I have purchased all come in HD on the same set up. So what is different here?,1455840000,,334,4.03030303030303
7216999,4,B00YI71PN2,Bought for my husband as a gift. The digital re-mastering to Blu-Ray isn't the greatest but nothing you can do. He loved it anyway!!!,1455840000,,133,4.583333333333333

7217041,4,B00YI71PN2,"The movies are classic, of course, but Lucas ruined them with his edits.  At best, he just gave the movies a layer of cheesy CGI.  At worst, he changed the nature of the Han Solo character for future generations. #hanshotfirst",1455408000,,226,4.625

I literally had to mute the sound every time no one was talking, since in order to hear what was being said, the volume control had to be at maximum; yet when the talking stopped, the music and/or background noises blasted you out of your chair.  Without a 'slide' volume control on the TV, the only way to watch the movies was to mute the sound and hope to turn it back on in time when they started talking again.

If you have a newer model Blu RayRay player these disks will either not work depending on what brand Blu Ray player you have. I have a LG Blu Ray player and when I inserted the disk, at first it wasn't loading. Then a black screen popped off with words saying it's an older blu ray formated disk and if I have problems go to the website and update my player. Luckily for me after that screen appeared the movie started working. The boxset itself is beautifully crafted. Suprisingly enough the part that says blu ray and the back is glued on, not printed.  It doesn't bother me but from the picture on here it appears to be apart of the box set not a separate piece attached. The audio and visual effects of the set is also perfectly done!

I had to laugh when I read where the reviewer was disappointed that they changed Darth Vader at the end of the 6th movie to the actor that played Anikan. So what! For those that didn't see the original, it's not going to matter, for those that watched them from episode 1 to 6, it makes more sense. No problems with the play back.

While the latter has much better acting and pacing, the prequels actually tell a better story with more wisdom and philosophy to muse on as well. The only problem with the prequels is the poor acting and directing. I think George Lucas tells a great story but is a pretty bad director. He should have given the story to someone else to direct the films. JJ is a great director but lacks the creativity, spirituality and story telling genius of Lucas.",1453852800,,547,4.708333333333333

I'm glad to have the first six episodes in one collection.  I just really DO NOT LIKE the changes made when the original movies were digitized.  I don't mind the enhanced Death Star explosions, but the added animations on Mos Eisley and Endor were horribly done and did not blend well with the original footage.  Not to mention changing the scenes in Jabba's palace as well as Anakin Skywalker's appearance as a spirit in Return of the Jedi to look like Hayden Christiansen and having Darth Vader yell NOOOOO! as he lunges for the emperor (the most egregious change in my opinion).  I don't know what the hubbub over adding a laser blast from Greedo is about; I personally don't care one way or the other as it didn't add or detract anything from my view of Han's character, but again it was, to me anyway, an unnecessary alteration to the original movie.

I liked my original Star Wars trilogy on DVD better that included a single DVD with a complete documentary on the making-of our favorite 3 (okay, fine, 6) movies.",1453334400,,488,4.855421686746988

My only problem and I didn't take a star away but thought about it, is the digital ""remastering"" of the movie.  It's just not the same as the movies I watched as a kid but still a great adventure.  If you're debating on your kids watching it, I would say it is far less intense than the news and the playground.  This is the type of collection that makes memories and brings families together.  The bonus features, while a little rough on editing, were very informative and interesting.  Watching the process was fun.

7217413,5,B00YI71PN2,My advice is to watch the series from Episode One through to Episode Six. This isn't how they were filmed but it is much more enjoyable this way.,1452124800,,145,4.214285714285714
7217414,5,B00YI71PN2,Wanted to catch up on all the episodes before seeing the new movie. A few notable changes in the production but I won't give anything away. Haven't watched any of the bonus stuff yet. Lots to see though.,1452038400,,203,4.368421052631579

7217418,1,B00YI71PN2,"On the product page when you click on ""More Purchase Options"" it clearly states that ""HD videos from Amazon include the Standard Definition version"".  There are no notes or qualifiers or special restrictions it just states that ""HD videos from Amazon include the Standard Definition version"".  I had the choice to purchase from Apple's iTunes or Google's Google Play Store.  I decided to go with Amazon for this one reason.  But it is not true that the Standard Definition is also included.  When choosing to stream you don't have choice to stream HD or SD. Amazon will choose for you!!!  This is what the customer service lady explained very arrogantly.  I hope someone from Amazon can go and listen to my conversation with the Amazon customer service lady.  What Amazon customer service lady stubbornly explained is that ""If your device is not capable of streaming HD then the Amazon system will downgrade to SD to allow you to stream in SD!!!!  That is not the same as HD videos from Amazon include the Standard Definition version.  Your tablet or phone is likely capable of streaming HD coding as mine are capable.  But you may want to stream in SD if you don't have WIFI and want to use less data and streaming over the carrier network. If it includes SD then why as the owner I am not allowed to stream in SD?  When I'm home with my big screen TV and  surround sound system and high speed WIFI I would rather stream in HD.  When I'm driving and my kid want to watch on my phone to keep him entertained I would prefer to stream SD because I'm on the carrier network. If it """"""INCLUDES'''''  then I should be able to choose to stream HD or SD at the start of the movie!!!!  Instead the lady explained that Amazon system will downgrade to SD so that you can still watch watch your movie even if your equipment is not capable of HD coding.  Hello, !! that is not the same as ""HD videos from Amazon include the Standard Definition version""!!  PS:  Sorry for repeating the same message over and over. I'm hoping Amazon will either change the wording or at least put a star (*)  and then clearly state the limitation or actually include SD and allow the customer to decide to stream in HD/SD.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-The-Digital-Movie-Collection/dp/B00VJ04TH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars: The Digital Movie Collection</a>",1452038400,40,2384,4.853960396039604

7217452,1,B00YI71PN2,The quality is bad. I would have to constantly had click on HD several times during the movie to show a clear view. Until the 4th movie I gave up pressing HD and watched the movie in BLUR. If I could I'd love to return this but I can't. I just went to Best Buy and bought the Star Wars - The Complete Collection Saga which has blu-ray so it's so much better to watch. plus it comes  with so many special features and the DVD is nice to have in hand.,1451692800,,449,3.880434782608696

7217457,5,B00YI71PN2,Been watching since Christmas and hoping to finish today so that we can finally see the new movie. Watched them in the order of the story line-thank you Amazon. They all make sense now! Funny to see the acting/dialogue in the older movies. Not quite the same as I remembered in the theatre. My teenage kids think it's hysterical that these movies were cutting edge when first released.,1451692800,2,385,4.676470588235294

7217460,1,B00YI71PN2,Very disappointed in the volume.  Star ships blast by so loud we needed to turn the volume control way down into the 20-30's.  Yet we had to turn the volume way up into the 80-90's to hear individuals speaking.  I spent all my time increasing and decreasing the volume so our family could watch.  With the family together for the holiday our intent was to watch these tapes before going to view the new movie.  Wish it had been more enjoyable. Would not recommend.,1451606400,2,464,4.476190476190476

Yes, the 4th movie suffered from a feeling of Pixar-wannabee to the point where it could have been a kids movie, but even it was good. The real fun was that while I saw the first three as a young adult, I was able to sit down and go through all of them with my son as a young adult. He loved them all too.

I felt that ""Return of the Jedi"" was cheapened by replacing the original Darth Vader, once taken into the Force's netherworld, with the later (movie-wise) face of him when he was younger. It seemed an extremely cheap shot to get a marketable current pretty face in there. It was a move not befitting the elegance of the series.",1450742400,2,778,4.221476510067114

Picture is amazing, sound is amazing, stories (all of them) are amazing. There is literally nothing to not like.

There are deleted scenes put back in some of the movies such as Episode 1 however it is a great buy and totally worth it.

From my understanding this pretty much is just a repackaging so if you already bought the other set there is nothing new here.  Without going into some long detailed description of picture and sound, I will simply say it looks and sounds great.  I thoroughly enjoyed that aspect of this set as well I liked how this set is not in a slip case of any kind and it is fairly easy to remove the discs without the worry of scratching a disc.  That being said I would have enjoyed more special features for each movie, this set feels like an economy set without any real reduction on the price compared to the 2011 version.  There are a lot of documentaries that I feel like most will find uninteresting and kind of pointless.  Still the deleted scenes for the original trilogy were really cool to watch, but I wish I would have seen more making of related to the individual movies.",1450656000,2,1105,4.288461538461538

There is no way to get refunded, you have to watch movies stopping every second.
Best option is to buy the collection with Ultraviolet, so you can get it on something like this and not depend on their poor servers,
I have not been able to remove HD quality either for a poorer quality that doesn't stop every 15 seconds.
Be warned, its frustrating, I looked for refunds, but if you started streaming 5 seconds of the movie, like in my case, you can no longer be refunded.
You also know its a problem because when you press on buying it; the FIRST SCREEN you will see is telling you: ""Amazon may stream a lower quality version"" if your internet speed can't; Like I said, we can stream 4k without any problem, so I know its not my wifi thats the problem.

7217595,5,B00YI71PN2,"(This review is for the Digital Movie Collection.)

I know people have a lot of feelings about which release version this collection uses, and I get it. That's a big conversation we'll be having for a long time. However, I think it is unfair to review a collection based on what you think it SHOULD be versus what it actually IS. With regards to what this collection actually it, it is just as advertised: the six Star Wars movie, and bonus features for each movie (ranging from about 50m to a little over 2h). I own DVDs of Episode IV-VI, and wanted to rewatch the whole series before the release of The Force Awakens. Rather than purchasing DVD or Blu-Ray copies of Episodes I-III, I decided to purchase this digital collection so I could have all 6 movies available to stream. The video and audio quality are great, although the audio is surprisingly quiet; I have to basically turn it up all the way to get an immersive experience.

7217596,5,B00YI71PN2,"Do. Or do not. There is no try.

I'm going to make this short, sweet & too the point for the average/above average fan who doesn't have time to read the books (most popular ""helpful"" reviews) they are extremely long and over the top.. There is no need to review the story lines contained in these 6 movies. Everyone who is a movie buff and has watched movies of re-makes or remastered versions of older movies know that the directors spice things up for the 21st century.

The video quality of the digital copies were AMAZING. The sound quality of the digital copies were AMAZING. The content of the digital copies were AMAZING (even the additions made by Lucas).

If you're a fan gearing up for the release of the new one December 18th (North America) or just a curious teenager who doesn't know what a lightsaber is because you were born in the Hunger Games era.. THIS IS A MUST BUY!!

Oh, and since I spend more than 30 minutes trying to fix this issue, it looks like I can't apply for a refund. This is the last mistake I'll make with the Amazon Video service.

Update: After using the Amazon video app to watch these movies on my smart TV instead of my computer, I'm still keeping my review at 1 star. When they're playing smoothly, I can see the potential for quality sound and video, but unfortunately they're generally still riddled with bad quality playback and even some major sound syncing issues. I even had these movies completely crash and have to be reloaded multiple times while watching the series.

If you're looking for a way to enjoy watching episodes 1-6 before the release of 7 next week, I recommend a different route.

It is the final version of George Lucas' hatchet job and meatball surgery of his work. I hate the prequels due to the obvious disregard of anyone else's input other than Mr Knowitall Lucas.

7217656,2,B00YI71PN2,"Let's be honest: more than likely you already have most, if not all, of these episodes on regular DVD, and like me, you wanted Blu-ray because of the superior picture and sound quality. Unfortunately only 1 of those 2 were touched in this.

Despite upscaling from my blu-ray player and 4K TV when comparing these discs to the saga on regular DVD, there is a noticeable difference. It does have superior picture as I expected. The issue is the sound. Sound was completely untouched in this package. The THX remastered regular DVDs of Episodes 4 through 6 I have offer far superior sound compared to this set, and for being on blu-ray, I would have expected it to be remastered as well. That alone is a complete let-down for me and makes me feel as if I've wasted my money.

7217693,5,B00YI71PN2,"This new 2015 reissue is just blu-ray case packaging with Disc trays inside it
carrying all 9 Discs with all the exact same content as the 2011 blu-ray set
the episodes 4,5,6 Directors cut versions plus episodes 1,2,3
plus all the Documentaries & featurettes that come with it
exactly the same content as the 2011 blu-ray set the only Difference is the packaging that's it and new cover art of Darth vader
i personal prefer the Directors cut versions than the original Theatrical versions of episodes 4,5,6
because the Directors cut versions was George Lucas's original vision of how he wanted his films to be
released way back in 1977,1980 & 1983
the new extra scenes inserted back into the theatrical cut needed CGI treatment for the scenes to work, understand
way back in the 70's & 80's this technology was not available obviously
so the New Hope, empire strikes back episode's had to be released as is in cinemas in 1977, 1980 & 1983
which was not George's original vision
to the Directors cut versions actually make sense being a loyal fan of the series myself
so i'm actually very happy the Extended versions got reissued again in this new 2015 reissue
and the HD transfers look incredible, very very sharp & clear picture quality with new 6.1 master audio mixes
so it's your Decision either keep the 2011 blu-ray set anyway,
or try to sell it yourself on ebay i assume and buy this new 2015 reissue
5 stars i give for this new reissue",1447718400,28,1442,4.614785992217898

7217698,4,B00YI71PN2,"The Lucasfilm Limited/20th Century Fox Home Entertainment team has, over the past 10 years, released the six live-action Star Wars Episodes which make up""The Tragedy of Darth Vader"" on DVD several times; the Prequels initially as individual 2-disc sets (2001-2005) and the Original Trilogy (or Classic Trilogy, if you prefer) originally presented in a four-disc box set (2004).

These initial releases have been followed by two more re-releases, the first being the 2006 Special Limited Edition re-issues of the Classic Trilogy which include the ""transfer from laserdisc"" theatrical versions of Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1980) because fans weren't thrilled that they had only the 2004 ""for DVD"" versions of the 1997 Special Edition re-edits. Two years later, Lucasfilm re-issued both trilogies in separately-sold box sets with slimmer DVD cases.

This item has only been out for one day and already the fan girl losers have crawled out their mother's basement to bash this item simply because it's not the same one they watched back when they wore diapers and sucked their thumbs. These people are seriously mentally ill. They are so obsessed over a movie that they have even gotten to the point of total utter disillusionment and beleive that Lucas had nothing to do with Star Wars' creation. At every oppurtunity these annoying dweebs are there to remind you of their insignificant and pathetic discontent over still not having the version they grew up with on blu ray. Initially Lucas planned to never release the originals at all and wanted them to die out on VHS. But Lucas relinquished his stance and listened to fan outcry and released the laserdisc transfers on dvd...yet the fan girls still complain! Now they want the originals in blu ray quality...which is something Lucas never promised...so that's what all these negative reviews are about...it's a futile and pathetic attempt of a crusade that these degenerate nerds are trying to do...but don't listen to these dorks who droan on and on for 30 years hating everything star wars except for the first two films...these losers have been left behind a long time ago so I suggest you simply ignore these mentally ill degenerates. (and if you really want the originals in high def just go get Harmy's despecialized editions and stop crying like a little baby).

This product is great. I love the new cover with vader and it is far better than the one that had Luke and Jake Lloyd's Anakin on it. The bonus features are awesome with lots of deleted scenes and documentaries. There is plenty here to keep you entertained. The picture quality of the movies is excellent but what will really blow you away is the sound!

A new hope 5/5 (groundbreaking classic)
The empire strikes back 5/5 (masterpiece. best sequel ever)
return of the jedi 5/5 ( great conclusion)
phatom menace 2/5 (ridiculous. feels like a parody)
attack of the clones 4/5 (a lot better than phantom menace but still has some issues)

7217731,1,B00YI71PN2,"What went through my head was the terrible new audio that replaced the classic scene of Darth Vader picking up the Emperor.  In the original he simply looks between the emperor and Luke and picks up the Emperor as his decision.  In the remastered/CGI polluted editions Darth looks at Luke then screams NOOOOOOOOOOO.  (Which was beyond unnecessary and rediculous and the original was simply better in every way).

Well that's what went through this Star Wars fans head fellow fans.  Another release of the movies in there messed with state.  I wouldn't have even minded that if finally they had coupled this with the original trilogy in it's ORIGINAL state. (Doing a much better job than the limited edition DVD editions which were poor transfers from the laserdisc editions) To this day, Lucasfilm has even defied the American film archives intitute and not delivered the original films to the archives, offering instead the terrible messed up special editions only.

I appreciate that these are George's film's he can do what he wants, but sadly no one can and should ever be allowed to change history.  No matter what he thinks, a generation of space opera fans grew up on these films and will never be happy until he re-releases quality editions of the original trilogy.  Personally I own the laserdisc definitive edition so I have perhaps the final ultimate version of the original Star Wars trilogy and I will never part with it as I still watch and enjoy it today.  When I watch the special editions, I originally found some of the CGI fun, but ultimately also found it kind of an insult to the grandeur of the original films which were on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey in there timeless appeal.  With the CGI, if you watch them now, it already looks dated, whereas the original releases still shine like they always have.  In essence I think the original trilogy had to be 'dummed' down in order for the terrible episodes 1,2 and 3 to even hope to compare(which the didn't in any way).

Here's hoping with Disney now owning the rights to the franchise that they will see the light and release a bluray edition which features both versions of the original trilogy, complete with all the amazing special features that appear on the laserdisc definitive editions.  These BLURAYS have some interesting special features but it's not enough to force this long time fan into purchasing a set where I only want 20% of the overall box.  Hmm maybe release the special features discs on there own so I can simply put those next to my laserdiscs until you can finally release the versions of the films that MANY fans know and love.

George, you didn't make the special editions special, you made them on a whim and a curiosity and to cut a devastated fans rant short, 'if it aint broke, don't fix it'.

How do you think Leonado Da Vinci would have been perceived if he'd painted 'The Mona Lisa' released it to the public for a number of years, then decided it required a special edition and put a pink mo-hawk over the top of her head with a set of horns added to the painting because he felt that finished the picture off?  There's a time for editing and a time for moving on and accepting.  All artists have this problem.  They will always think this could be better, or that could be better, but seriously, you have to go with something eventually even if it's not everything you wished for.  Imagine if The Beatles had decided to completely re-do 'Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band' and turn it into a jazz work and label it as a special edition? How about an iconic feature like the 'Mount Rushmore National Memorial' being painted fluro orange because it would be a special idea and make the faces stand out? Look your going to get a lot of very passionate cheesed off people doing things like that.  Why? Here's why. Once an artwork(and a movie is an artwork) is released to the public, THAT'S IT.  That's your movie.  The only editing that should ever be done is to enhance sound or picture quality if the technology is available but you NEVER mess with it and change things.  That's simply unethical to this fans ideas.  Star Wars meant something as a child, it still means something today and it means those things without any CGI at all.

The Problem is not just the edited/removed scenes, it is the poor color correction.

Both of the Blu-Ray sets were made from the same scans as the 2004 Star Wars DVD's.

Look up Harmy's Despecialized Edition on YouTube if you want to see how many scenes have been changed over the years and how bad the recent transfers have been.

The only way to buy the original films is by finding them on VHS, Laserdisc, and the 2006 DVD's.  These are still not the true screen dimensions of the original movies.

If you want to have both the ""original"" and the special editions, I would recommend buying the 2006 versions of episode 4,5, and 6 individually on Ebay ""It is cheaper this way"".  Each movie should be the 2-disk 2006 version.  Then buy episode I, II, and III on Blu-ray.

If you do not care about color correction, heavily edited scenes, or being able to watch the original movies, then the full Blu-ray sets are what you will probably want to buy as they contain a large amount of bonus material.",1446336000,59,1110,4.482587064676617

7217767,2,B00YI71PN2,"Dear Disney Brass:

Give the fans what they want, there is clearly a market for it.

And don't just release the remastered HD original ""theatrical versions"" but also release an Extended Version with all the cut scenes put back in (like Peter Jackson does for LOTR); do this for all six films. Release this cash cow every which possible.

Give them more extras, like the classic ""From Star Wars To Jedi: The Making of A Saga"" documentary narrated by Mark Hamill. Other important extras would be the classic short film ""Return of the Ewok"" by Warwick Davis. All retro TV spots and trailers, too (ALL of them).

Release a separate product called ""Star Wars: The Dirctors Cut"" for the altered films. This would be respectful, logical and factual.

Lastly, release this ""ultimate set"" in a durable case that will hold up over time.

This is the legendary all-American Walt Disney Company after all, right? We the people expect high-end entertainment and products both.

Best wishes,

The Fans",1446336000,23,987,4.868263473053892

I also hate that you can't view original/theatrical versions anymore...they all have cheesy new scenes and graphics inserted.  Also, the sound quality was a little disappointing - granted, I don't have surround sound, but when I watch regular television or stream online, I only have to turn my TV up to about 12 to hear everything the way I want.  I blasted the volume on this (up to about 45) to try and get a better effect, but it still just kinda sucked.

7217862,3,B00YI71PN2,"I'm guessing that anyone buying this knows what they're getting into with Star Wars, and I don't have to explain it to them, so I'll talk about the quality compared to previous releases.

This one is definitely the best quality so far, despite your feelings on Lucas' latter day edits, which are all present. Previous to this I had DVD copies in various aspect ratios and resolution, but the blu-ray here is unimpeachable, in comparison.

The extra content is great, and all collected onto separate discs from the movies themselves. There's even some segments that haven't yet been released, which is cool.

The case itself isn't great quality, which is where it lost a star for me. It's made of like a laminated cardstock material, which isn't glued together very well. Part of my case started to come apart at the seams almost immediately. The discs are all stored in cardstock sleeves, which always makes me feel nervous. These sleeves basically mean you have to put your fingers on the data side of the disc to pull it out, then wipe smudges off later. I would have much preferred hard plastic disc holders, but that would have driven up the price significantly, which I guess is why they went this direction.

Which brings me to the other star it lost for me, which is price. I guess the Blu-ray format itself isn't cheap, plus you are getting 6 movies and hours of extra content, but it still seems expensive to me. See if you can get it on sale, whether here on Amazon or in a brick-and-mortar somewhere.",1444262400,,1511,4.626865671641791

The nice thing about Blu Ray copies are you can lend them out to people and if they Amazon empire falls - your copy is safe.  The nice thing about the digital copy is, every room in the house that has access to Amazon Prime Video can easily cue up the movie and start playing it.

Once you decide that Amazon digital is the way to go - I can say that the Video looks amazing.  I'm sure your mileage may vary based on your internet connection - I have a 30 mbps connection via cable.  They do a great job of putting the special features on Amazon Video TV matching them up with each movie.

Unfortunately, there is a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices had cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.

These are still the ""Special Editions"" of the Original Trilogy.  Even if Disney did give us the so-called ""original"" versions of these films, they would still be sanitized and edited.  For example, the Detention Block scene was trimmed by Lucas himself years ago to remove the blaster shots burning holes into the uniforms of the Imperial officers because they were ""too violent"" so don't expect PC family friendly Disney to restore those brief unedited shots exactly the way they originally were.  These films have been tinkered with so much over the past 3 decades with the sound mix altered, remixed, enhanced and visually color corrected so many times from the original interpositive that you will never see these films released exactly the way you may have remembered seeing them when you were children and neither will your children or future generations either.

I am referring specifically to the audio quality of the Blu-rays in: Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI)...as released in 2011.

Whosever job it was to ensure the balance of audio levels of the dialogue and the music/special effects tracks was clearly sucking on some powerful DEATH STICKS and is in need of a severe jolt of Force Lightning to wake them the blazes up!

Having to ride my remote's volume control  during the entirety of each film to turn it WAY UP when dialogue scenes came on and then WAY DOWN whenever there was an uptick in the special effects sounds or the score welling up RUINED the entire experience.  I deeply regret my purchase.

I do NOT recommend that ANYONE buy this product, released in 2011.

If you do your research (as I clearly did NOT, adequately) you may find a better set of the first six movies on Bluray.

The video was crisp and clean (with no caffeine, ha ha ha) and I really wish there was a way to adjust ANY receiver (digital or otherwise) to make this mess of an audio problem straighten out.  There just isn't.  They messed it up BIG TIME and apparently FIRED their quality control manager just prior to final approval.

People who will especially HATE the abject FAILURE of the people who put these Blurays together will be those trying to watch the films at a low volume, as in when others in the house are trying to sleep.  If you set the volume correctly to hear dialogue, then you will WAKE THE NEIGHBORHOOD when the first explosion occurs and if you set the volume lower to bring it back to a reasonable volume, it will sound like you MUTED IT when the dialogue scenes resume.

Of all the complaints I've heard about changes made to the movies' content in the special editions and now the bluray releases, I can't think of anything worse than the colossal MISTAKE of hiring the people responsible for the audio levels of these disks.  They couldn't have done a worse job if they had DELIBERATELY intended to SABOTAGE this product.

Meesah also gonna warning you aboutsa the extras.  Dersa no wayin' to play the deleted scenesas backa-to-backa.  Itsa like-ah deysa no wantin' you to justa set it anda forgettin' it.  Yousa gotsa ride that remote again to getsa yousa through deesa features.

Okay, no more Jar-Jar speak...

In addition (or subtraction), I have seen more deleted scenes on YouTube than they have on these blurays.  It's really pathetic.  They have 50GB of space on each disk and they couldn't put ALL the deleted scenes on here?

Just in general, the three ""bonus disks"" are extremely underwhelming.",1442102400,,2592,4.648351648351649

I do own a Kindle fire but the Samsung Galaxy S4 Tablet is a far superior product that was free with my new phone, my fire broke about 6 months ago and I thought all the digital content 8 purchased from amazon would be compatible but it is not.

While super fans can pick apart these new editions with what's wrong with them versus the original releases, I can enjoy these anytime and not worry that the tape is going to stretch, break, or that a VCR player will eat it.

You're able to see flashes of the brilliance in Eps. 1-3 that came through much more frequently and strongly in the Original Trilogy.

7218041,2,B00YI71PN2,"Perhaps I differ in my opinion of what ""remastering"" is. But I found some of the liberties taken with the original trilogy to be a perverse bastardization of the films. The CGI additions at Mos Eisley, in particular, are heinously out of place, conspicuous, and wholly unnecessary detractors from the plot.

Episodes 4-6 were written at a time when films had brilliant scripts, dedicated directors, and screenplays where the passion of the writing and consideration for the presentation of the story reigned supreme over visual effects. Lucas has superimposed modern components of film (CGI additions) over the originals, tantamount to ""restoring"" a priceless painting by inserting a patchwork of photoshopped images. It destroys the continuity. The original THX remasterings from about 1997 were better.

Also, you're paying for a ton of extra features. If you're a hardcore fan, or handy with Google, you probably won't learn anything new.",1439251200,,941,5.351351351351352

7218073,3,B00YI71PN2,"As of today, 7/27/15, the original unaltered theatrical trilogy (i.e. not butchered by Lucas) of Star Wars DOES NOT EXIST on Blu Ray.  You can confirm this by reviewing the release chart Amazon has included with this item listing.  The one DVD version of the original unaltered theatrical trilogy that was released in 2008 will cost you between $200 - $300+ from the Demon Pig resellers here on Amazon and over on Ebay.  That version has the black and blue cover with Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker fighting, and IV, V, VI printed across the bottom.  Be warned that the overall quality of that DVD version is extremely poor.  To summarize, the original unaltered theatrical versions of Star Wars DO NOT YET EXIST on Blu Ray, and the only crappy DVD version you can buy will cost you a small fortune.

7218091,3,B00YI71PN2,"I give the movies, in their original version, a 5, but this collection includes the ""additional scenes"" George Lucas was determined to add years later. These additional scenes, I think, bring nothing to the story but only show how great special/technological effects which are unnecessary and, for me, lessen the pleasure of watching the films. Other than that, however, the story is still great and it is wonderful to be able to see these movies again. (We only purchased the original Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi - not the other 3 films, for us they were just not entertaining or engrossing to watch - far more into special effects than a good story, but that is a personal opinion provided so readers understand how I view films).",1437523200,7,759,4.757575757575758

Episodes 4-6 shows its age despite the restoration works but no complaints in the visuals dept and I have no issue with the newly added in CGI content. However, they could have improved on the sound as I felt it needed enhancement for modern day home theater.

7218102,4,B00YI71PN2,"It's a shame the bitter 45 year old fanboys are using the amazon reviews to hate on the prequels and the new editions.  I mean, get real-  you knew exactly what you were buying.  Anyone purchasing this blu-ray set has seen every version of every Star Wars movie at least 10 times.  The reviews should speak to the quality of the actual boxing, the visual and audio quality of the blu-ray vs normal DVD, and the extras included that can't be found elsewhere.

The boxing is great.  Clean, compact, and with interesting artwork that you've probably never seen before on the inside.

The video and sound quality of these blu-rays are awesome.  Miles above the DVDs.  Interesting result, however:  It makes the original trilogy look a lot better, but makes the prequels seem a little worse.  The reason:  The prequels, relying so heavily on CGI that gets better every year, have not aged particularly well.  The extremely detailed quality of the blu-rays make them look even more cartoony.

The extras are wonderful, but leave you wanting a bit more.  SO MUCH conceptual art and 360 views of props...but that gets boring after a few minutes.  I'd gladly trade every bit of conceptual art and all that jazz for just one more good documentary.  And sadly, all but one of the documentaries are stuff you may have seen before...most are from the 80s and 90s and you've probably caught them on TV some time.  The real meat and potatoes of the extras are the new little vignettes, where the artists and model makers talk about specific things, like designing the Death Star or animating the AT-AT, etc.  Sadly, these little gems are only 3 or 4 minutes long each.  There's about eight of them for every movie, though.

My one huge gripe:  In a set this big, they could have and should have included EVERY SINGLE featurette and documentary Lucasfilm ever made, including the really good one ""Empire of Dreams"" from the OT DVDs, and all the docs and featurettes from the prequel set, which were really good.

There's an impressive collection of deleted scenes, but be careful:  If you're a die-hard fan, some of these are very cringe-inducing and awkward to watch. You may need eye bleach and some regressive hypnotism to forget some of them.  If you thought Luke was whiny in episode IV, just wait until you watch ""wormy"" hang out with his friends on Tattoine for a painful 15 minutes...you'll be rooting for the empire after that.",1437177600,,2420,4.704761904761905

7218197,5,B00YI71PN2,"This ""Star Wars: The Digital Movie Collection"" is a convenient way to get digital ownership of the ""modified"" (will not say ""improved"") versions of the six Star Wars films and in-depth Bonus Features on the making of each of the films. I love the Star Wars franchise but I fall firmly into the ""Han shot First"" group of fans, so would have preferred to have the original versions. That being said, I am happy to be able to access these from all of my streaming and mobile devices.

The Bonus Features are interesting but I doubt if they will get much re-watching after the first pass.

Highly Recommended!

7218204,4,B00YI71PN2,"I think the price was a bit high considering it was digital content. Also, it seems like the picture isn't as sharp as it should be and there are ""water ripples"" around the text on the bonus content. The bonus content, while good, is also very haphazard and there isn't a lot of rhyme or reason as to how they split it up in order to attach it to each film. I think the Original Trilogy fares better with that, but only ""A New Hope"" has a trailer as a part of this content, which I find odd. If they were making this ""archival"" as they claimed, each film should've had at least the main trailer attached to it. The new interviews are good and the behind the scenes portions are smartly assembled and that makes up for a lot of the rather disjointed content.

I'm not going to review the films because pretty much everyone knows them and either loves them or hates them. Everyone also has an opinion on which one is the best and which is the worst. Hopefully, you can just get past that and enjoy them.",1434499200,,1001,4.2408376963350785

7218266,1,B00YI71PN2,"I got this set for the original trilogy only. I don't care about the prequels and I think Attack of the Clones is just plain awful so I'm just ignoring them entirely. The reason why this set only gets one star is because George Lucas ruined the original trilogy. The versions included here are his heavily modified versions  and Return of the Jedi gets it worse than any of them. There are a ton of videos and articles out there that break down each individual change so I won't waste your time with that but believe me when I say that the films are almost completely different than they were when they came out in theaters (or were on VHS, which is how I was introduced to them). Lucas even goes so far as to completely remove certain actors and VA in order to shoehorn in more prequel nonsense. Seeing Sebastian Shaw replaced by Hayden Christiansen at the end of RotJ was just l depressing. I can't recommend this set even to people who have only ever seen the modified versions.

For those who aren't as familiar with the continued 'evolution' of Star Wars, you should know that George Lucas' interests include sports, long walks on the beach, and watching as your precious childhood memories suffer and die. If we have to put up with close to five hours of Hayden Christensen's lifeless and emotionally neutered defiling of all that was holy and good from Episodes IV-VI (not to mention Jar Jar Binks acting out Lucas' bizarre minstrel show fantasies), the least we can look forward to is the schadenfreude of unquestionably the worst visual abortion to grace American TV screens. Your hear that, Disney?

Lucas could have made him say stuff like ""Wow, this looks just like I've seen on the vids (or whatever kids were calling it a long long time ago IAGFFA)! Or Like I always imagined it.!"" he picked up the controls in the Naboo Cruser without even touching them. I little bit of ""oh wow, I'm in a space ship"" is okay, but when he realizes his life and those of his friends are in danger that crap should go out the window along with ""What does this do Artoo? Whoa!"" Sorry I know he's a kid, but I want him to be more focused and using latent force infused intuition to figure it out and to be a little scared while he's doing it. In fact that would follow the whole them of Anakin, That he is afraid to lose people. That little dude should have got a little dark in that cockpit and opened up a can of whipass.

When I started to watch the entire run in episode order, in a deliberate attempt to try and watch Star Wars as younger audiences always have, rather than as I experienced them upon original release, I intended to write a comprehensive and logical over-view/review. However the experience was so dull and depressing I gradually lost any motivation to persevere with such an approach. Whats left is, admittedly a scattergun collection of criticisms, but I think theres enough important ones here to justify the rating Ive given these (and this is very definitely a collective rating for the 6 films together. Considered separately the star ratings would be all over the place

And Im not going to criticise the entire silliness of the StarWars universe (such as Imperial Walkers that can be brought down by a piece of string, ditto for chicken walkers, or even why the Star Wars universe in general is so averse to using the wheel) as thats all part of the fun.

Nor am I going to do the first generation Star Wars fan vs the kids that grew up with the prequels bit. These films were never made for an adult audience and its unfair to assess them on those terms. Particularly as they fail so well on their own terms. I AM an old fart who was there in 1977 and even  had one of those saucer sized badges of may the force be with you. Im not saying I wore the thing but I owned one. Theres my credentials. I want to like this stuff. But it cant be done. The faults aren't cosmetic. They go through to the core of the saga. Which is a pity as one of the films (guess) is great as a standalone bit of fun, and one other is actually a genuinely decent piece of movie-making (guess again). So, in no particular order:

 The pod race. Its boring. Not just because its long and poorly edited, but because, as an audience we know it doesnt matter. Its a foregone conclusion. Unfortunately this comment really applies to the entire episode. And probably to films II and III as well. Which means, as the destination is already fixed, the film-maker needs to ensure we enjoy the journey. Thats why were watching. But we don't do we? Which brings us to

 Haydns charisma bypass. This isn't the problem  hes playing it the way its written and the way Lucas wants it played. Thats the problem. For the tragic fall (and later redemption (Ill get to that) Annakin needs to be someone the audience roots for, likes, identifies with. What he needed to be was the prequels Han Solo equivalent (in effect Han and Luke in one). And then he can make those bad choices that lead to becoming Darth Vader. And wed give a damn (it would even resonate with Han making the right choice (to return and save the day) in IV. Instead we get an unlikeable arrogant schmuck from 8 years old onwards. We already know where hes going to end up, but at no point in the prequels do we care (in fact the little brat deserves it). The greatest source of interest is trying to work out what possible attraction he has for Amidala. Nothing we see on screen gives us any clues (Lucas could have made the romance work by making Amidala as dull and unlikeable as Annakin; leaving us with a romance between two psychotics made for each other. That might even have been interesting to the audience (lots of TV is built around the apparently endless audience appeal of psychopaths). The problem with that approach for this series would be trying to wedge the Annakin fall from grace storyline (now the spine of the entire 6 film saga) into a setup where hes a prick from day one. Which as it turns out, is how it ended up on screen anyway. Which brings us back to where this paragraph came in

BTW, making the Darth Vader story the centrepiece makes perfect sense. Lucas got that right. Every anorak clad fan in 1983 (I was there) worked out that the only way to make the Darth Vader smiling around the campfire scenes work in ROTJ was to rejig the entire series around Darth Vader (it certainly wasn't that way when IV was simply Star Wars)  so that the dreadful corn at the end of ROTJ would be warranted. Lucas got that part right.and then went on to completely bugger it up.

 Some small stuffups  right from V we had the problem that Obi-Wan Kenobi lies to Luke Skywalker (well, he didn't in the standalone film but he does in the saga version). This is addressed re the biggy (Darth Vader as Dad: not addressed well, but addressed) but dealing with that doesnt touch on the fact he lies his head off just about every time he opens his mouth in IV. Ben Kenobi states he hasn't been called Obi-Wan Kenobi since BEFORE Luke Skywalker was born  except we now know he was. His clone war reminisces are almost lies (try hard and we can interpret them into the larger narrative); hes never owned droids, yet as much as anyone is seen owning droids he appears to have several in the earlier chapters (he keeps getting them killed). No wonder he has to plead for Luke Skywalker to trust him later in IV (you know where). Everything he states about Luke Skywalkers father is BS. Why lie about the small stuff? He may even still be telling porkies in V as he claims he was trained as a Jedi by Yoda, but the impression in I is that thats what Neeson was there for The real answer is Lucas didn't pay attention to any of this in the later and earlier chapters. But these aren't the sort of films that can break the 4th wall to explain or excuse themselves. Probably the best solution to the ep IV/V continuity problems with Obi-Wan Kenobi would have been to add a line in V about Obi-Wan Kenobi having dementia. All problems solved (Hans already called him a crazy old man, so the set-ups there). [BTW Obi-Wan Kenobi also mentions that he can identify Imperial storm troopers because they are such precise shots with a blaster. Which is odd as for the rest of the series they have trouble hitting the side of a barn. Still, thats just bog standard forgiveable film s***.]

* In a similar vein, in VI Leia talks about her memories of her mother. Now go back to III and try and work out how this is possible. You start to feel that George Lucas worked off memory when putting together I-III and couldn't be bothered spending 5-6 hours checking out IV-VI to ensure consistency. Other than as a cashcow does Lucas give a damn about this franchise?

 Jar Jar Binks. We all know that. But why stop there? How about every new CGI character in films I-III? Jar Jar just gets the flak due to having more screen time. But all the others are just as irritating. And as stupid in conception. I know were not supposed to think like this when watching a Star Wars film (are we supposed to think at all?), but how did that two-headed sports commentator evolve in the first place? I know its just a joke moment, but George  for a joke moment to work it actually has to be only a moment. You keep going back there.

 Which reminds me  C3PO isn't funny in I-III. At all. Yet is clearly meant to be a riot. Nor is pulling him to bits in every film a funny running gag. Especially as when it happens in V it was (originally) supposed to be dramatic. Fat chance of that working now, when his frequent dismemberment is used for head transplant gags.

 Note that R2D2 has super powers, including flight, in I-III. Apply these powers to situations in IV-VI and you may start to think R2D2 is just trying to make everyone else work harder. In fact R2D2 could probably overturn the empire on his own. If he wanted to.

 CGI Yoda. The muppet in V is far more convincing. Note also that the presentation of I-III Yoda makes a mockery of his initial scenes with Luke Skywalker in V. Unless he was stoned when they first meet.

 Kung Fu CGI Yoda.

 Han shot first.

 Boba Fett. Providing in II and III a backstory for a non-character in V and VI somehow manages to diminish the character in V and VI even more, as it draws your attention to the pointlessness of a character that was best used in a bad cartoon in a TV Holiday Special so awful even Lucas wants it to stay buried. But I remember. Told you I was a fan.

 VI: Note - IV and V were family pictures, this is a children's film (an observation, not a criticism). Let's accept that and carry on.... Apart from the major annoyance of teddy bear merchandise playing a role in the rebellion (you keep expecting to see price tags on their ears), or pondering the imaginative genius that coined wook-ee for a tall thin bundle of fur, and ee-wok for a short fat one, VI always had the problem that its has two climaxes, and they're both remakes from chapters IV and V. Luke Skywalker fights Darth Vader (V) and Death star destroyed via one fatal weakness (IV). Even the Bond films took more than three iterations before this level of dj vu set in. And Lucas has admitted this had nothing to do with greater dramatic resonance, it was simply that hed used his death star idea ahead of schedule in IV, but wasn't going to let that stop him still using it where hed originally set it in VI.

 The lousy (and rapidly dated CGI: check out Jabba in IV (CGI version and never looks part of the scene) with muppet Jabba in VI. Muppet Jabba stands the test of time. The earlier appearance in IV doesnt (it wasn't in the original Star Wars at all and isn't really needed)). All those CGI aliens also draw your attention to just what a poor costume Chewbacca was  even in 1977. The costumes in Pufnstuf (almost a decade earlier) are far more sophisticated creations. Even the cowardly lion in The Wizard of Oz (1939) has the edge. Clearly a budget victim at the time, he just looks like a refugee from a different film series now. On the other hand complain too much and Lucas might go back and attempt to fix him via CGI. And none of us want that

 Show don't tell errors: The prequels have an incredible amount of sound and fury signifying almost nothing. For example everything you need to know of importance in III occurs in the text opening the film! The entire setup (adding another villain, after Lucas tied himself in knots with Lees villain in II, (who, for most of film II could quite easily not have been a villain at all; his conversation with an imprisoned Obi-Wan Kenobi is probably the key exposition dialogue in the film and could have easily made him a good guy. Hence the clumsy twist of adding him to Palpatines ludicrous long-term plans (remove Lees character and robot army from Palpatines scheming with the clone army and see what difference it makes to Palpatines long-term plan. None as it happens. Lee could have been exactly who he says he is to Obi-Wan Kenobi and everything would still play out the same). Its an unnecessary level of complexity. The strength and appeal of IV was its simple straightforward storytelling. It became the most successful film in history (to that time) on that basis. The entire series is still simple, but its not straightforward anymore. Yet despite all the cod-political intrigue Lucas adds in I-III (yeah, thats why people go to see a Star Wars movie George), anything really important to the setup or to plot developments is told to us via the opening text (to all three) or, very occasionally by turgid expository dialogue. This is appallingly inept film-making and almost the antithesis of the original film  where Lucas was trying (and succeeding) in making a good old-fashioned fun-ride of a movie, something Hollywood wasn't doing in the 1970s. (You had to be there in 1977 to understand that this film wasn't just huge, it changed everything. Seismic cultural shifts on this scale haven't happened since. Nothing in film since Star Wars has come close. Its up there with The Birth of a Nation or The Jazz Singer for impact. Theres really no excuse for this. Lucas simply doesnt appear to know how to put together a film. And this from the guy who goes on and on (and on) about his understanding of narrative and heroic journeys (in some interviews you start to feel that perhaps its the only book hes ever read). I have no explanation for the incompetence on display throughout I-III. Perhaps there isn't one.

 BIGGEST STUFF UP OF ALL: this is the clincher. The entire 6 film saga is built around the rise and fall of Annakin Skywalker, and the subsequent rise and eventual redemption of Darth Vader (back to a smiling post-living Annakin again). Except, unbelievably Lucas manages to set things up so that Darth Vader is NEVER redeemed. This means that the I-III have actually managed to completely **ck up VI as well (in addition to continuity problems in IV and V). How has he managed to completely get it wrong? Like this: Annakin is a screwed up kid/adolescent/adult with particularly strong family/abandonment issues. For most of II his obsession is with his mothers welfare. Which, as it turns out, isn't good. He finds her in time to watch her die following her torture. This upsets him a little, and he slaughters everyone in the vicinity. Everyone. Women, children, banthas, the lot. Its a key moment along his path to the dark side. And is treated that way in the film. Subsequently in II and III he keeps finding it easier and easier to kill, well, anyone really. Killing children (called younglings?? Why? Nevermind) in III is another example of this slide. By this stage hes ready to wipe out anyone who looks at him in a funny way, or anyone who doesnt look at him, or, or, anyone. By IV hes got no problems with planets being wiped out (evens his daughters home planet. Of course he doesnt know Leias his daughter. He never senses that. Whereas with Lukeoh, whats the point?). But the key to Annakins slide is that when his family is threatened hes completely psychotic and will do anything. He says as much several times when Amidala is threatened. Its a family thing. Thats where he starts to go bad. Before that hes just an arrogant, unlikable prick. But not necessarily evil. Its threatening his family that unhinges him. After that anything goes.
So what redeems him at the end of VI. Does he see the error of his ways? Regret the untold millions hes been involved in killing, either directly or in a supervisory capacity? No, none of that bothers him at all. He only turns on the Emperor when his sons life is at risk. At which point, just as back in III hell do whatever it takes to protect his kin. And kills the Emperor (in the original release DV at least thought about this; in the 'improved' version he just yells 'Nooooo' and gets on with it. I have no idea why Lucas changed this). Whoopee. Darth Vader is redeemed. Except he isn't is he? His behaviour is motivated by exactly the same impulses its been propelled by since episode I. This psychopathic prick hasn't changed at all. So the entire saga is now about a self-centred psychopath who doesnt change. The end. How uplifting.

It wasn't that way when there was just IV, V and VI. In that version Darth Vader was redeemed, rediscovering his humanity  his soul if you like - when it really counted. But thanks to Lucass unique ballsup of I-III thats now gone. So I-III don't just stuff up themselves. They bugger the entire series.

 What about the clearly best film in the series  V. I now consider that the problem film. Its so much richer and mythic than the others that it (at the time of release) set up all the false expectations that led to the massive disappointment of the later, but set earlier films. Its too good to be in Star Wars. Written and directed by competent professionals it simply doesnt fit in anymore. Its not a team player.

 Which leaves us with IV. The only one that really stands up as a stand alone film. For the simple reason it was made that way. It still survives better than any of the others, despite the others doing their best (on either side of it) to muck it around and bring it down to their level, because it still has a story that doesnt really need the others to be enjoyed. It even works best as part of the saga because in the context of that saga its really functions as an illustration of what Darth Vader has become, while in passing, introduces us to Luke Skywalker  now in place for his final showdown with Dad in VI.

 Sigh.

 And there are many many more faults. Discussed and argued over by Star Wars fans for years now. These are just some of the more egregious ones for me. And I re-watched the series in episode order with the deliberate intent of giving the saga as fair a go as I could. But its just too damn stupid.

 Positives  nice box, good transfers.

What you get are the HD Blu-Ray versions of these movies, and they look awesome. You also get a bunch of never-before-seen bonus features that are associated with each movie and that is equally awesome. While some will complain that this release is blasphemous with it's changes, I am blaming that more on Lucas rather than Disney. Honestly I do not want anything else changed, just leave the movies as they currently are, as I know I will get used to them, just as I got used to the other digital remasters. But the quality of the films are still top notch and all the content you get is a bargain. I would recommend.",1431302400,,721,4.388059701492537

7218375,5,B00YI71PN2,"I so wish people would stop complaining these aren't the versions you want and actually review the Blu ray's themselves.  Yes I was a child of the 70's and 80's BUT I love the special editions over the theatrical releases.  People don't seem to understand Lucas has said the original theatrical version will never see the light of day again because its not what he wants.  I have two kids and the only versions they know are the special editions and its the only version any person will know from now on!!!

These blu rays are top of the line the picture and sound are perfect reference quality.  The bonus discs is probably all stuff you have seen before if you are a true fan but its nice to have it all in one set.

There are no DVD's of the movies in this set and no Digital Copies (you must buy those separate).  That would be my only beef, now that there are digital copies they should be included with your blu ray purchase.  But thats not gonna happen for the foreseeable future.

If you love star wars, then these are the discs you want.  I can't see them looking or sounding any better EVER.",1431216000,3,1101,4.300970873786408

7218377,4,B00YI71PN2,"So I won't go into this long-lived debate about how the prequals suck. Atleast, not until I go over one very important fact. The two movie franchies are obviously different, even in contuity. Anyone who liked the prequals more then the original releases would never really admit this.

Now with that said, this is a review regarding the movies and their special effects in DIGITAL FORM. The first and most important fact in this respect is that these movies high high quality video and audio. So if you care all about the pretty, then you are going to adore this collection.

However, I would like to say that the bonus features playing straight through is something that I find to be rather bothersome. So I'd honestly suggest then you go buy the blu-ray version more. Digital may appear to be the new standard, but you get more control over the content displayed in blu-ray more. If you have a new tablet and you want a new movie collection, really... you can't go bad with the Star Wars digital movie collection. It is as good as you will expect. But, I think that compared to the blu-ray version, it is not as low priced.",1431129600,3,1125,4.536945812807882

7218402,1,B00YI71PN2,"George Lucas returned after a 22 year ""hiatus"" from the original Star Wars film to write the Star War's prequels and the 22 year break shows.  The first two prequels, Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clone Wars, are indisputably awful and even difficult to sit through.  His casting, script, dialogue, and story is jaw-clenching bad.  I had hoped that all these years after seeing them the first time, something endearing could be found, alas this hope was mistaken.

One feels both insulted by and embarrassed for George Lucas while enduring the first two prequels, from Jar-Jar Binks to the painfully long, long, long teenage love story scenic footage (an outdoor picnic in the hills ... really George?) between Aniken and Padme.  Perhaps Lucas was surrounded by yes-men and nobody was willing to question his script and approach, we will never know.  The bottom line is don't buy the Digital Movie Collection and choose instead to purchase the individual Star Wars movies (IV, V, VI) that you will actually enjoy watching rather than being tortured sitting through (i.e. Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, I and II respectively).  On a positive note Star Wars III Revenge of the Sith (2005) is not bad, showing Lucas did hear loud and clear the flood of world-wide critiques following the release of I and II.",1430956800,,1318,4.883408071748879

Joking aside, it's a great set with two ""extras"" discs and a wonderful ""documentary"" disc, one segment of which features all kinds of parodies, etc. involving ""Star Wars"" over the years.  My favorites of these are the music-video parody of ""Phantom Menace"" by Weird Al Yancovic and the SNLive ""Star Wars auditions"" with Kevin Spacey ""auditioning"" as Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Christopher Walken and more.",1430265600,,562,5.142857142857143

Why, then, hasn't Disney released the Original Theatrical cuts? You know, the ones that made George all the money in the first place... Why aren't these available on Blu Ray? At this point, I personally am just fine with my DVD of the Theatrical, which finally came out in a boxset that's now very pricey. Lucas had to release his original versions since the Laserdisc was providing bootlegs. But a Blu Ray would be great, or an HD Stream... And when that day occurs, this Star Wars fanatic will be very happy... Am waiting... A long, long time... Let's hope, there will be another...

7218501,5,B00YI71PN2,"I am one of those people who have purchased every version of the trilogy that has ever been released.  So, of course, I had to add this to my collection.  It comes with separate special features for each movie, and the HD quality matches that of my Blu-Ray collection.  What I love, more than I thought I would, is the obvious convenience of having them streaming and on demand.  And, for $89, I feel it is a steal of a deal.  For purists, you may not like the new lead-in studio credit as they have removed the 20th Century Fox logo and associated fanfare and went with an edited Star Wars fanfare with Lucasfilm Ltd logo instead.  I found it to be satisfactory as I wondered if we'd get the Disney castle and ""When you Wish..."" as the lead-in.  It is, however, still in place on Episode IV.  Great buy!",1429747200,,804,4.3133333333333335

7218504,5,B00YI71PN2,"That's the reason I'm buying this set. My existing versions of all these movies are a rag-tag mix of 2 DVDs and 4 VHS tapes--To watch the original IV-VI trilogy, I'd have to rent them--my VCR is a thing of the past. Several years ago I picked up a DVD player. But that meant that I could only watch the newer trilogy by first renting the opener. A few years back I upgraded to BluRay, and all it meant was somebody coming out with a box set like this one. Which they did, so here I am. One other thing you DON'T get when buying this set rather than the individual films? You don't get those pesky promo ads in the beginning that you have to detour around with the 'disc menu"" button. There are fewer ""goodies"" that a certain element thinks are more important than the film (""Dewwwwd, like, I already saw this flick at the Cineplex""). But one of the ""goodies"" that gets left out here is those stupid ads when we already know what we want and/ or like. Neither the movie disc of ""Return Of the Jedi"" nor the ""Archive"" discs in this set has a scene which would have solved a mystery that's bothered me since I saw the TV broadcast version. There was a scene during combat sequences on Endor where Chewbacca borrowed one of the vines the Ewoks use for aboveground travel. Just as I was noticing how Chewie swinging on that vine reminded me of Johnny Weissmuller's old Tarzan movies, Chewie lets out a Wookie imitation of the ""Tarzan Yodel"". That scene was on the TV release but I don't remember if it had been on the theatrical release.",1429747200,,1532,4.341463414634147
7218505,5,B00YI71PN2,"An amazing experience watching all six movies in HD, and the bonus features are a pleasant surprise.  Did George Lucas change his movies and mess with my cherished childhood memories?  Yes, and this release is not going to change that fact. I have the originals for when I want to try and re-live the world-changing experience that was 'Star Wars'.  Compared to my first viewing in 1977, at a drive-in movie theater, this Digital Movie Collection on a home theater system is nothing less than an appealing assault on the senses. The video quality is mesmerizing.  The sound output gives a jaw-dropping experience unlike anything earlier formats have provided.  I cannot denigrate this version because the creator of the franchise, thinking he was improving his product, upset a lot of people who want to forever cherish their memories of the original. Maybe it is because I am getting old, but sitting in an easy chair, lights out, sound system on high, remote control in hand, pausing, rewinding at will, and watching as many times as I can want --I cannot think of a better time I have ever had savoring Star Wars.  Regardless of where one stands in regards to original vs. modified versions, there is enough in this offering to make it worthwhile for all.  Nothing can ever compete with the awe George Lucas' masterpiece filled me with as a kid, but this collection comes closer to recapturing that feeling than any of the other previous releases.",1429747200,,1450,4.82258064516129

Probably seen episode 4 30 times and listened to it another 40 times.

I used to be a big Lucas fan, until he started adding ""kid friendly things"" to his movies. He also has a heavy hand on over doing certain things or reworking his movies.
When they re-released SW I was doing a happy dance thinking they cleaned it up, especially the matte lines. NOPE. Why would I spend a rediculous amount of money for digital copy then?

I suppose they want you to enjoy the matte lines one more time. No thanks will stick to my originals on VHS, since they cannot release a high end copy that the fans want.",1429228800,3,627,4.208333333333333

I enjoyed the set. While watching the newest Star Wars, 1-3, I enjoyed all the CGI and how the movies flowed together, how the action was entertaining and pretty much flawless viewing. It was really hard to find any flaws with the integration of CGI and the actors. That being said I was really, really impressed with the Original Star Wars, you know ,4-6, and how advanced George Lucas and his team of professionals were!  I have watched the 'bonus' features on how the movies were made and I was still amazed how the 'team' made all the special effects and how the movies are still equal or better than today's modern CGI in the movies now! Now I wonder what would happen if George Lucas would/could get his whole Team of Star Wars 4-6 back together to make a new Star Wars movie. I always thought that if you are going to dream you might as well dream in Technicolor! I'm patiently waiting for the latest Star Wars movie with J. J. Abrams and then I can compare the series and see hove they stack up to each other. Great set of movies and they will always be a hit to watch anytime!",1428969600,2,1247,4.329059829059829

The enhancements in some areas of the special effects are outstanding, but goofy cut scenes with animals doing slapstick and the character revisions bother me a bit.

The bonus features are excellent and to me are as interesting as the movies themselves.  Of course I start watching Episode IV and go in production order since I may not get past Episode I if I went in episode order.

What can I say?  Disappointed that so many FOX and Disney movies, when you buy the blu-ray, you get a digital copy as part of the purchase.  But not with the Star Wars collection.  Now I understand the blu-rays came out a while ago, but ""disc to digital"" verification is easy for Ultraviolet, so why not with this?

Okay, I thought, I'll get over that.

Let's ignore buying it again.  In fact, maybe I can justify buying the series again, if this one includes the original edits of the movies, and not the special editions.  But, no dice.  Though this digital edition has lots of bonus features, it is missing that most important bonus feature:  The original versions of the original trilogy.",1428883200,4,847,4.617449664429531

 This new format does help, I am able to watch it without being bored and confused by the horrible acting , props and costume/scenery, or wanting to stop watching it.
 The bundle does allow a type of a story, not sure what but I suppose there is a story in this some how. Now I know the story, but they make you watch all 6 movies to find out, that Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa are ?
 Not a big fan of Harrison Ford.
 As for the picture quality, much improved. I also read there is new film editing, which I do say has worked, because the old version was really poor. The sound I suppose was improved, but really can't tell in the first film.
 Will never be a hardcore fan of this Star Wars.

Unfortunately it goes by title not movie number so I had to look up a few title names to make sure I was watching these movies in proper order.

1 - The Phantom Menace
2 - Attack of the Clones
3 - Revenge of the Sith

4 - A New Hope (The first)
5 - Empire Strikes Back
6 - Return of the Jedi

7 - The Force Awakens (not included in this set, in theaters in December 2015)

I love the movies, having, like so many others, grown up with them. And, like many others, I have wondered why Lucas would choose to mess with success. His excuses not withstanding, his meddling with the original trilogy was a bad decision. His continued meddling now only seems spiteful.

Now, for the prequels. Without the deep personal knowledge of the original material and extended material of a massive fan (guilty) the prequels can be enjoyable. My son will more often than not watch the Phantom Menace instead of a New Hope. Lucas was trying new technology with actors that were unaccustomed to performing with it. The wooden performances can be forgiven a bit.

Taking the character of Vader and changing him from the deeply feared and foreboding embodiment of malice into little more than a weepy sycophant I can not forgive. It's almost as if Lucas was intentionally trying to ruin the icon. Bastard.

I can only dream that the new series will make up for what has been done.",1428710400,3,1118,4.77720207253886

This simply will not stand!!! Sure Lucasfilm made and own them, but they were distributed by Fox originally and as a Star Wars and a Fox fan, I still find these films as part of Fox's legacy just as much as IV. It's bad enough that the films went through changes from DVD to Blu-ray, but no you got to take out the Fox logo and fanfare too for streaming!? Amazon, Lucasfilm, Disney, I'm begging you to please undo this error. If Warner can keep the MGM logo for their pre-86 MGM library and if you can still keep the RKO and Buena Vista logos for your classic films, surely you can restore and keep the Fox logo and fanfare  (and the Distributed by Fox credit depending if it's still there) for I, II, III, V, and VI.

7218721,1,B00YI71PN2,"I saw the original Star Wars in 1977 and 1978.  IIRC, I probably saw it about 10 times.  In actual movie theaters.

I saw The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi a like number of times when they were released.

Those are the films that I remember as being 'Star Wars'.

These are not those films.

I've seen some people say that 'change is good' and 'fanboys should just get over it'.

I'm not a fanboy.  Nor did I know about the argument raging between Star Wars aficionados and George Lucas about the release (or lack thereof) of the original theatrical cuts of these movies.  I've since found out about it.

What I also know is that I purchased these movies, thinking they were going to be the movies that I paid to see multiple times in the late 70s/early 80s.  And Episodes IV-VI are not those movies.  Not even close.

I noticed minor differences throughout, some of which were barely noticeable, others of which were mildly annoying.

But at the end of Return of the Jedi, when Hayden Christiansen appears alongside Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda, I had a completely cognitively dissonant moment, and realized that George Lucas had ruined the fond memories that I had of these movies in their original forms.

I've given this set away to young person who's never seen the original films and probably won't care.

And I will never buy another Star Wars product until I can be reassured that the movies that I'm buying are the movies that I remember from the theaters.

If you were born after about 1985, sure, recommended.

7218726,1,B00YI71PN2,"Let me start by saying I am a huge Star Wars fan, and grew up watching all six movies. I didn't purchase the new HD digital collection and I generally do not recommend it to anyone. Here's my review:

First, It includes the Prequels. Don't bother buying or watching the prequels. They are a waste of your time and money. The only thing they could possibly be useful for is entertaining small children, and I wouldn't even let my own children watch them because I feel it would be detrimental to their mental health and impress upon them bad portrayals of cinema, storytelling, and human interaction before they are able to understand why it is bad.

Second, Even the ""Original"" Trilogy is actually the Special Editions. If you enjoyed the original movies and would like to revisit them and/or pass them on to your children, by all means, purchase episodes IV, V, and VI separately for $20 each. They are the Special Editions, and as a die-hard fan I stand against them, but comparatively, that wouldn't be a bad option. The originals are not out in HD, and Adywan hasn't finished the ""revisited"" series. There are no HD original versions on the horizon for us die hard fans, so all in all, one can just attempt to ignore Darth's ridiculous ""NOOOOO"" and other changes in this version. If you're a die-hard fan, wait for other original versions. But again, I would not recommend this collection, just episodes IV, V, and VI. It is a $30 savings and I promise that you will not even notice the difference.

In summary, please consider your options before purchasing the full collection of these HD digital movies. They are offered separately and I'd hate for you to spend $30 more than you have to, as the extra $30 will not only make no difference to you (the prequels will NOT stand the test of time) but may even detract from your enjoyment of Star Wars.",1428624000,8,1854,4.595166163141994

They are, by definition, less valuable than a dvd or bluray which has value and can be resold.  So why should you pay the same or extra for digital versions?  The answer is that you should not.  Ever.  Digital copies of anything should be available at a significant discount because (1) they have no resale value and (2) they do not have production and distribution costs like physical media.  Digital distribution costs pennies on the dollar compared to physical distribution.

In this digitial collection, you're not getting a single disc, you're essentially paying for permission to stream the movie.  Kind of like paying for a rental copy that you have permanent access to.  Most people's internet connections will not be able to deliver bluray quality so you're paying extra to have a worse experience than you'd had if you'd bought the bluray.

There is demand. I don't understand the problem.

In regards to those who like all 6 movies and are considering purchasing the digital media instead of the blu ray disks:
The terms of service state that the service of providing the digital content content can be changed at any time ""even if your use of the digital content is impacted by the change"". Ask Kindle readers who have purchased digital content that was downloaded to their device only to have it automatically removed due to license / distribution disputes. Or the consumers who lose a digital channel because the cable provider and distributor get in a fight over how the income should be split. As a consumer if you are okay and willing to purchase digital content go for it, but understand that you will never have the same usage of the digital content versus the blu ray. The license is yours to view the content, at the quality they provide and is always subject to change by them or the owner of the content. They don't come to your home and remove the physical disk from your collection nor do they contact you and tell you to return the disk because the movie distributor realizes later on they could have sold that blu ray for 30 instead of 15 dollars each.

The market will bear is what the cost should be. I think my dollars are worth more than the digital content which could be changed or removed under the terms of agreement. The infrastructure for streaming is already in place For other media. So the costs borne are related to storage of enough copies to adequately serve the purchasers streaming demand which they scale, i.e. automatically provide more copies when there is a peak in streaming. This means that if there were one million purchases there is a smaller percentage of digital files (duh) since the one million aren't watching at the same time. So again it boils down to storage and royalties and profit of course.

I have no qualms with those who think the digital media should cost more and are willing to give their dollars for viewing the 6 movies from the Internet every once in a while. As long as they aren't my dollars then knock yourself out.

Let's see for  $74 a used blu ray star wars 6 disk set plus shipping on amazon I can play on any blu ray device I have currently  and in the future or take the blu ray media while on vacation or over to a family's home. Or I can pay 99 dollars and abide by the terms of use that may change over time with the possibility of having the terms change where I lose the ability to view the content and where I am currently limited to 2 devices that they specify that I may have or may not and requires registration.  So if I get a new media device I may or may not be able to transfer?  And they may downgrade the stream quality per their terms of use?  Again, it is just something you should consider.",1428364800,24,3047,4.421428571428572

This past weekend the children and I overthrew the tyranny of our imperial Blu-ray player. More appropriately the five-year-old held over his head and casted down into the vast shaft of the Imperial Death Star , aka the floor.

 Unfortunately this left his freedom burning on a Viking funeral pyre, and grounding looked ever near. I turned to Amazon, ""Help me STREAMING video your my only hope""

To which I received the answer ""Did you mean Star Wars Rebels?""

""No I didn't mean Star Wars Rebels. I said Star Wars""

""Did you mean Star Trek?""

""WHAT?!?  I did not say Star Trek!"" ( Plus I already owned it)

 Lost walking along the desert , searching for a way to awaken said streaming video I spied a press release that indicated a New Hope had emerged that would finally allow me to Strike Back Against the empire of Blu-ray. ( Insert some witty pun about return of the Jedi).

AND THEN I BOUGHT IT AND GOT REALLY BOARD ON MY LUNCH BREAK!!

Bought it and then wrote this review.

7218846,5,B00YI71PN2,"Thank goodness these films have finally come out in Digital HD on Amazons Instant Video. To go all digital years ago I gave up my DVD and Blu-Ray player and have since then so terribly missed these, my favorite adventures.

Its unfortunate to see negative reviews by those who are against George Lucas' editorial decision to clarify his work in Episode IV. Truly, those changes have nothing to do with the creative genius that lies behind all six movies.

For those who don't know, the friction stems from the concept of Han Shot First, which refers to the cantina scene between Han Solo and Greedo. Lucas was never satisfied with the original version that made it appear as though Solo shot Greedo in cold blood. He made several changes over the years to that and other scenes. As a grandfather, I tend to side with the changes. I like for the good guys, even the bad-boy good guys, to exhibit a bit more fair play that the baddies. And besides, this is George Lucas creative masterpiece!!! If he wants to improve the films, he should go for it. No true artist can resist adding one more brush stroke or changing one more paragraph (or scene) to make their work just that little bit better.

And thats the point for this new online, digital release. Here are all six films, with every ground-breaking embellishment that the artist could make in his reach for perfection. I love these movies like no others and this online release is something to be celebrated. Ignore the sniping and buy the entire bundle.

I still resent the fact that Lucas added a ton of SFX on the old stuff yet refused to digitally remove Jar Jar Binks from my memory (and the collection).

7218896,5,B00YI71PN2,"The generational divide may impact some views on the complete collection. Those who grew up with the original trilogy may not enjoy the prequels as much. Conversely, those who weren't around when the original series were in theaters may view the newer films as better. The set is worth it for the special features alone, all of the documentaries and deleted scenes included. However, the omission of the great ""Empire of Dreams"" from the DVD set is a bit puzzling. Either way, how many films are better than ""Star Wars"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back""? Consider the structure of ""Empire"" alone. The movie starts with a huge action sequence, includes the lightsaber battle everyone had waited three years for, and one of the best plot reveals in film history.",1426896000,2,756,4.868217054263566

7218902,5,B00YI71PN2,"This is a great set. It's one of the more expensive Bluray sets that I've purchased, but it's not terribly expensive for 6 films at the current price. You know what the movies are, so I won't go into detail except to say they look great. I guess there were some additional edits made (AGAIN) to the movies to update some things, but I didn't see anything I didn't like. Just small fixes that made sense to me. That awful, stupid, pointless singing alien in Return is still there, assaulting my eyes with terrible CGI. There still is no way to get the original, unedited versions of the films, but maybe that will happen in future years; who knows? Alien did it, so maybe Star Wars will, too.

The only shame was that upon arrival, the exterior casing around the dvd cases was falling apart already, and has now fallen apart completely.
  The movies themselves are wonderful though and still in a protective casing. The remastering of the films themselves was what I expected with the subtle changes to the story but that is an argument not for here.

7218934,4,B00YI71PN2,audio in latin spanish in all movies. But where is the 3D version of the last one that came to the theathers?,1425427200,,109,4.0
7218935,5,B00YI71PN2,"Ok, this set has been out for quite sometime now and I have read some of the reviews. Everyone is not going to be happy about it, so I might as well get that in right up front. Having been very fortunate enough to have seen the ""original trilogy"" in the theater in the summers of '77, '80, '83, respectively I must confess that I love those three the most. I am sure the kids that saw I-III for the first time and had not seen the later SW movies, must think those were their trilogy. That's all fine and dandy. Having loved SW all my life, and still do, I am one of those fans that had bought virtually every set that came out, whether it was the VHS widescreen editions from 1992 in a box set, or the 1995 Laserdisc THX certified Widescreen versions (which by the way IS THE BEST VERSIONS OF THE UNALTERED YOU ARE GOING TO GET, for an official release). When I saw the 1997 Special Editions that Lucas wanted to do, I thought, ok, he's going to finally put the Jabba the Hutt scene back in IV, now that we have all seen Jurassic Park, the technology for film has finally caught up so it could be believable. If anyone thought a fat man in a caveman bearskin rug would make a memorable character as a crime boss in SW, you have another thing coming. He did not look intimidating whatsoever. I was able to view the VHS documentary of what Lucas wanted to do in each IV, V, and VI. I thought his changes would add to each movie. Now, mind you, some tinkering went on behind the scenes still exclusively for this Blu-ray release set.
Here's what I think, and again, I was 10 when I saw IV: A New Hope in the theater so I believe I have been a SW fan longer than most of you have been.
Most of you long time fans, like me, have complained about the added CGI effects or changes to the original trilogy. Ok, that's fair enough.

IV ~ , if ANY OF YOU have an original VHS copy of it with the RED letters Star Wars on side, I beg you to go back and watch THAT on todays widescreen LED TVs and tell me what you think. You will NOT be impressed. No DVD of the original theatrical version ever came out until about 2004 with the ""Limited Edition"" sets. That set has the Special and Theatrical Versions, however, the Theatrical versions are not cleaned up, no THX, and ALL mistakes, I mean ALL are in it. Glitches, film dirt, the boxes clearly visible around ships, Darth Vader's metal lightsaber, you name it. But, at least it is on DVD.
This set has clearly cleaned up and I mean cleaned up many errors that were visible in IV. So, to the extent of the cleanup, yes, excellent job. Now, the added or changed scenes for this set in IV were good for me, with the exception of Han Solo and Greedo scene. It is ok now with them virtually shooting at each other at the same time. I would have preferred it left alone like in the original. Han Solo had a gun pointed at him, what else is he supposed to do, sit there and wait for it to go off? No, we all know HE shot Greedo under the table before Greedo could squeeze the trigger.
Obi-Wan Kenobi scaring off the Sand People, to me it is better. Again, not everyone is going to like it, just stating how I feel about it.
Creatures being added and so forth coming into Mos Eisley was nice whereas Lucas could not do it in 1977, but wanted to. The technology was NOT there to do most things he originally thought of doing. He wanted the spaceport to be big and expansive. He shot on the island of FIGI, I believe, and could not get that. The orange ""blob"" under Luke's landspeeder is finally gone as well when they enter Mos Eisley.
Jabba's scene with Han Solo and Chewbacca. Jabba is completely redone even from the lame 1997 version. Much better and looks more in line with Episode 1. When Han and ""the gang"" are taking off from the docking bay, we get to actually see the Falcon lifting off with the troopers shooting their weapons at it and then get to see the Falcon fly off in a more normal way as opposed to the stiff and tight liftoff we had since 1977. That's the motion control cameras at the time.
I never liked the X-Wings taking off from Yavin IV to go fight the Death Star. You couldn't see them, just little white blips like shooting stars all going at the same speed at the same time? A definite improvement there. The lightsabers in the duel between Vader and Obi-Wan. Better and more vibrant than ever before.  The ""Metal"" lightsaber was FINALLY covered up with RED! Thank you! (It's the scene where DV comes toward the hanger door as Han says ""Blast the door kid!"" just before they make their daring getaway aboard the Millennium Falcon.) That has bothered me for decades. The trash compactor creature was touched up, nice. The added scenes with Luke's friend Biggs Darklighter in the X-Wing hanger before the Death Star Battle were good. Added fight scenes during the Battle of the Death Star were really good and the explosion was nice with the added blast ring. The visible ""boxes"" around ships in previous editions have all but vanished, with the slightest hint of them when Han Solo and Luke are fighting off the 4 Tie Fighters fleeing from the Death Star. It looks fantastic on an Ultra 4K!

V ~ The ""meteor explosion"" that Luke sees on Hoth is more intense in sound now as opposed to the weak sound before in previous editions.
The scene with the Wampa Ice Creature added more suspense in the cave when Luke was hanging upside down.
The entire Hoth Battle sequence has been cleaned up, especially with the AT-AT's and Rebel Snowspeeders. Before you could clearly see the landscape through the metal of the ships. The large boxes around the ships, diminished greatly and almost invisible. Yoda has been left alone and looks as he did in the original release if not better by Blu-ray standards of detail. The asteroid belt looks really good now in high definition as opposed to the previous format releases. The Emperor scene aboard The Executioner with Darth Vader is just wonderful as he looks like he did in ""Revenge of the Sith"". Before in previous editions, he looked like an old man with a fat right eye. Didn't look intimidating to me then at all.  Well done with added dialog. Bespin looks fantastic and never better! This is what a Cloud City is supposed to look like, at least Bespin! The original was limited and could not show you the outside of the city and what it looked like. The lightsaber duel between DV and Luke was fantastic and looked awesome in every hi definition detail! The added scene of Darth Vader flying back to the Executioner was good!

VI ~ The added effects to the Sarlacc Pitt monster were good as before there was just tentacles coming out. Han Solo's dialog is changed a bit when he shoots the tentacle to free Lando Calrissian from the grip of the Sarlacc. Before, he says ""Trust me"" now ""It's alright I can see a lot better"" and some rope has been added to his legs when hanging upside down from the skiff as before there was just his feet there with Chewbacca holding them. Not really believable. lol  Inside Jabba's palace we see an added creature walking, a dug. Same species as Sebulba. Originally, Lucas wanted a bigger and better dance number to entertain Jabba.
With 1983 technology at his hands to do this and no CGI, he couldn't really do much and had to rely heavily on animatronics whereas the creature just stood there and moved a bit up and down near the mic. This dance number carried over from the 1997 version looks good and adds a little happiness to the otherwise doom and gloom of Jabba's Palace.
Yoda is left alone and intact as he was in original theatrical debut. The Ewoks now can blink. Again, in 1983, he couldn't accomplish this and was left with creatures that had their eyes open 24/7. It didn't bother me, because it only happens a few times, mostly when you are focusing in on what Princess Leia has to say.
Now, the scene where DV is about to pick up the Emperor and throw him into the energy shaft. It works for me either way. In the original he does not say anything and just picks up the Emperor, to his disgust. In this set edition, a deep NO! is added before he picks up the Emperor. Well, to me, Anakin is basically letting his emotions get control of him much like that of the scene in ""Revenge of the Sith"" where the Emperor tells him about his love Padme, ""It seems in your anger, you killed her."" He is basically outraged that yet again the Emperor is killing another member of his family and has to yell it out.
The ending has a lot of fans angry, and perhaps for good reason, but I think there was a reason why it was changed, good or bad. Instead of an older Anakin Skywalker ""spirit"" like in the original theatrical release, we see the spirit of Anakin Skywalker and what he looked like BEFORE turning to the dark side. In an effort to capture some of the prequel fans to the original trilogy and a sense of continuity on what he looked like before being burned, I think this is the reason Hayden Christiansen appeared next to Yoda and Obi-wan Kenobi. Personally, I would have left it alone as he was redeemed by Luke Skywalker when he died in the older form. Therefore, there was no need for a younger spirit of Anakin. Just my thoughts. The ending of the cities and planets were very good with joyous occasion and fireworks that an Empire or ""Emperor"" was no more.

I - III
All look great and sound great as they were in the theatrical versions. Episode I does have the extended pod race in it and adds to the movie. Nice. Yoda is CGI now as opposed to the puppet we were all forced to see in I. He is more in line now with II and III. Too bad Jar Jar wasn't edited here and there in I so we could see less of that character, who for me, was annoying.

Luke tells him of his struggles to join Academy also. Other members are seen at the station, one who is a woman and has a notable attitude towards Luke for some reason throwing him back his binoculars instead of handing it to him.

Shows entire dialog of Han and Greedo, of which some did not make it to final cut in film. Han shoots first, of course, while having gun pointed at him. Does not show Han below table taking his gun out of holster. Shows more of the creatures in the Cantina, a few got deleted for good reason. One looks like the ""Fly"" character from the original movie ""The Fly"". Very similar, but not exact.

Luke's recovery in Bacta from being out in the Ice (black and white, some audio).
Luke and Leia kinship before knowing they were brother and sister. Luke basically tells Leia that he really likes her and attempts to kiss her but is interrupted by the droids.
Wampa Ice Creatures getting loose on Echo Base in hallways and the security forces battling with them. Some effects, but no lasers. (This was probably deemed to slow pace of movie down, so it was deleted. Great to see though because they really were nasty creatures.)
Plus, we get to see C-3PO removing part of that warning sticker on one of the doors or ""holding cells"" containing an Ice Creature. When the Empire eventually enters Echo Base, they stop at the door, open it, and a large arm of a creature comes out to take one of the snowtroopers. Darth Vader comes and is warned not to enter by the other troopers, he is seen leaving down the hallway. (No audio here.)
The Fate of General Veers during the Battle of Hoth with the AT-AT's:
General Veers and his crew are destroyed right after shooting the Shield Generator at Echo Base by ""Hobbie"" and his Snowspeeder by crashing it into the AT-AT head where the crew are. (A Kamakaze move by the Rebels). Black and white, no audio, some drawings where used where the film was not completed, but the whole scene is intact.)

Overview with Dennis Muren, Phil Tippet. They talk about Jabba's palace, The Sarlacc Pitt and working in Yuma, AZ. where it was shot.

Vader's Arrival on Death Star, reaching out to Luke Skywalker in his chamber, Luke being shown in cave near Jabba's palace, perfecting his green lightsaber, C-3PO outside saying how wretched the place was, then being joined by R2-D2 going to Jabba's palace. All sound and effects are here and almost made it to the final cut of the movie. Also shows Falcon and X-Wing in background near where Luke was.
(My guess is that George opted to reveal Luke's new lightsaber during the Sarlacc Pitt skirmish.)
Tatooine Sandstorm. It is all here except for the final audio redub by the actors. The big fans are clearly heard to stir up the dust. This scene was cut to opt for the ships leaving orbit and splitting up in space as seen in the movie now, then communicating as to what is going to happen.

(I always wondered why the Royal Guards did nothing to Vader when he entered the Emperor's chamber unannounced and then the Emperor saying ""I told you to remain on the Command Ship."")
~ Emperor voicing command to JerJerrod to destroy the Endor Moon should the shield generator be destroyed by the rebels. JerJerrod states there are many soldiers on the moon, Emperor states back ""YOU WILL DESTROY IT!""
~ Deflector Shield is down, lost all contact with station on Endor, commence rotation of main batteries
~ Rebels moving in on unfinished portion of Death Star. Rebels enter Superstructure.
~ Moon target in range, commence firing.
~ Battle of Endor: The lost Rebels. Several female pilots are scene in fighters acting out, but only one made it to the movie and her voice was dubbed over by a male voice. (her voice probably was not suited in the scene, Heavy accent. It should also be noted David Prowse's voice was dubbed over as well for James Earl Jones as Darth Vader, so it's no surprise if you see this footage.
A pilot resembling that of the character Nien Nunb is also scene in a fighter. A Mon Calamari soldier is here as well with hilarious dialog for fun.
~The ""Falcon""rebels on board the Millenium Falcon during the Battle in Space above Endor. They are seen doing various tasks as well as the gunners aboard during the battle.
~ General Madine and some rebel support staff are shown in place of the Mon Calamari on board the Home One ship just in case the creatures did not look as good on screen. There was a plan for them to be replaced with human rebels.

(I also have the VHS on the making of the 1997 editions explaining in detail what went on when cleanup took place on IV, V, VI. The documentary called ""From Star Wars To Jedi"" that came out in 1983. It's narrated by Mark Hamill and is very good. It was never released on DVD or Blu-ray.)
The Artwork on set was decent and I really liked the guide that came with it also in sleeve.

 **** UPDATE ON ANOTHER BOX SET (OCT 2015):
Another reissue of this boxset is out now, same 9 discs, only has a black box with a full fledged Darth Vader on cover and the discs are housed in the typical Blu-ray plastic case that would hold 9. I don't have it as I have this (Beige), so I can't say whether or not the guide came with it.
**** BLURAY STEELBOOK EDITIONS:
 There are 6 ""limited edition"" cases out. These covers have the ""bad guys"" on each one, with the exception of II, whereas, Yoda, is on that one and each one has a ""scene"" inside the case respective of that movie. Most of the original artwork for the poster is on the backs of each case. They only house the single disc Blu-ray that is in this ""Beige Set"" I have reviewed.

All in all, a great set of the first 6 SW movies. I have to say that although the UNALTERED originals are not in this set, it does not detract me from giving this a 5 star rating. Like I said earlier in my review, I have been a long time fan since 1977 and these movies have never looked better or sounded better. Sound is DTS HD 6.1.
But, many of you still want the original unaltered versions of IV-VI. You CAN get them, but not on Blu-ray as of this writing.
Look for the 1995 LASERDISC THX WIDESCREEN VERSIONS of IV-VI. Those are about as close as you are going to get of the originals cleaned up with fabulous sound. Perhaps in the future after VII - IX are released we may yet have these original versions on Blu-ray.",1425340800,629,22815,4.485563041385948

7218994,5,B00YI71PN2,"I sincerely hope that science and scientists differ from science fiction and its practitioners. Heaven help us if they don't: We may be headed for a very boring world indeed. Strip Star Wars of its often striking images and its high-falutin scientific jargon, and you get a story, characters, and dialogue of overwhelming banality, without even a ""future"" cast to them. Human beings, anthropoids, or robots, you could probably find them all, more or less like, that, in downtown Los Angeles today...

O dull new world! We are treated to a galactic civil war, assorted heroes and villains, a princely maiden in distress, a splendid old man surviving from an extinct order of knights who possessed a mysterious power called ""the Force,"" and it is all as exciting as last year's weather reports.... Why, even the most exciting fight is an old-fashioned duel, for all that the swords have laser beams for blades....

Here it is all trite characterization and paltry verbiage... The one exception is Alec Guinness as the grand old man Ben Kenobi (Ben for the Hebrew ben, to make him sound Biblical and good; Kenobi probably from cannibis, i.e., hashish, for reasons you can probably guess.)...

7219021,5,B00YI71PN2,"Well, my review will be a mix of my own thoughts and responses to this extremely detailed review at the top (the only one I have read so far). I must say there were some things said with which I strongly disagree.

This guys obviously knows more techanical language in terms of picture quality and sound quality. One of the main reasons I spent the money on the complete saga was I knew if one wants some ultimate blu ray quality, Star Wars is obviously a place to look. ALL the movies look amazing!!! Star Wars will most likely be the best 1970s blu ray movie you will ever see. The only movie I hadn't seen before I got this collection was Attack of the Clones. This movie has the best scenery of any Star Wars movie!!  That chase scene through the city after Obi jumps out of the window. The detail, and structure and lights AND everything about the imagery of that background is great. In terms of sound quality, I have no surround sound. But they all sound very similar and they are all great.

I'm not real into romantice movies but I disagree with the remarks about the dialouge between Anakin and Padme. The story does a great job of showing the development of love between the two. Its a great story. Its dramatic. Drama is the key to any great film. The intensity of his love is part of what drives him to the darkside!!!  Its an essential aspect of the prequels part in the saga.

I'm sorry but....the two best movies in the whole saga are Revenge of the Sith and RETURN OF THE JEDI!!!!!  The main reason for this being that they both represent the intense, climactic endings of their respective series!!  First of all, lol.....how can u rush anything in a story divided into six long movies. How is that possible. The average dramatic movie is what, about 2 and a half hrs lol. I havnt added the total number of hrs of all the movies but I assume its longer then 2 hrs. The transformation of Anakin (who's anger actually appears to be somewhat angry towards the beginning when he said, ""I'm not a slave, I'm a person, my names Anakin."") is documented throughout the first three movies. It isn't rushed in anyway (let alone only being present in Revenge of the Sith...).

I can't believe I heard someone call Return of the Jedi the worst film....WHAT. If this is a common sentiment among hardcore Star Wars fans then I can just add this to the list of criticisms I have about their opinions and complaints. (Mainly referring to the some of the excessive complaints about insignificant changes in the original trilogy). 1. I don't think it was rushed. Palpatine had more time to groom Anakin because he was trusted senator. In Jedi he's the Emperor of the Galactic Empire and figured he had a one shot deal. Sometimes you just have to make sense of it with your own ideas. Maybe the Emperor was over confident in his ablilities at that point. Maybe he figured Darth being Lukes father woule help influence. Maybe he thought a tendency towards the dark side existed in the Skywalker bloodline. 2. The Ewoks are a great contribution to the story. Who can imagin Star Wars without the lovable Ewoks??!! First off, they didn't bring down the Empire. They played a minor role. It was done for the most part by the killing of the Emperor and Han and the gang deactivating the shield. Second, he says a small, less advanced force can't overwhelm a more sophisticated army. Have you heard of the Viet Cong? Lastly, I think its a great ending to the saga. Part of the saga ends on a little, forest moon called Endor. Its magical and mystical. Isnt this part of what Star Wars is about??!?!?

Return of the Jedi did come out when I was three or four. But my peference for this movie is not based on ""child blinders."" Basically, I had seen the ending about five years ago when I was 30 and it was at this point I developed a deeper appreciation for the ending. When the empire is killing Luke, its a great movie moment. If I had to pick a least fav, it would be between Phantom Menace and yes....A NEW HOPE. I know I will be shunned for that. I know its the film that started it all. But if you think about it, its the least exciting and has the least exciting plot points. The story just needed to be started somewhere and the Star Wars phenomonom set in motion. As far as the Phantom Menace, Liam Neeson.... and that's all ill say about that one haha.

Now for my short review ( excluding stuff I've already said). I liked Star Wars but getting this collection made me a huge fan. I realized how great the story is and its so cool having all the movies together. The case the movies are in is great in and of itself. I refer to it as a book. I love the artwork. Each movie has specific artwork dedicated to it next to its sleeve (the best ones being REVENGE OF THE SITH AND RETURN IF THE JEDI. And one of the special feature discs with a drawing of Han Solo and the Ewoks!). I havnt watched the special features. I'm not just not much of a special feature guy. I just love movies. In conclusion, its worth the money!!!",1422144000,,5019,4.369774919614148

7219025,2,B00YI71PN2,"The thing that bugs me is when a movie is released they always have to make a different version of the movie and mess with the classics. For instance with Yoda in Episode I they can change him to CGI, sure thats fine. Just give us both versions so we can switch back and forth instead of ending up with the worst version. I was soo excited to buy the whole saga on blu ray even though after a few months i got a slap in the face seeing the blu ray/DVD version for sale after I purchased the blu ray only set. I just wish they would make a blu ray/DVD with both the altered and unaltered version. I mean come on don't you think that would solve the problem of angry customers. You know what they always say, the customer is always right. Well than give what the customer wants, a perfect Saga!",1421971200,,792,4.116129032258065

7219039,5,B00YI71PN2,"The picture and sound quality are great for these Blu-ray discs. Lot's of extra features worth watching.
These are not the theatrical versions of these movies, as many people have stated, but if those differences don't bother you too much, you can't go wrong with having the entire Star Wars saga in high definition. The price was right.",1421625600,,337,4.827586206896552
7219040,4,B00YI71PN2,Bought as a present. Personallly i like the new CGI stuff. But if you have the trilogies in other formats maybe hold off maybe cuz its not like you get much more out of this.,1421539200,,174,4.0

7219046,4,B00YI71PN2,"Well anyway, it is nice to have the whole Star Wars saga in one package but you can definitely tell the difference in the high definition video quality when you watch Episode 3 (2005) and then go right to Episode 4 (1977).

Anyway, I have no interest in seeing any new Episode 7. This story is over with for me.

Additional info: I just tried to watch Episode two again, The Attack of the Clones. OMG, this has to be the worst episode! Anikin is so annoying as a lovesick wimp. I'll try watching it one more time but, jeez, it's hard to stay awake listening to Anikin's wimpy sounding whining throughout this episode.",1421452800,,617,4.4035087719298245

7219059,5,B00YI71PN2,"I haven't yet watched the extra non-movie discs, but this collection is awesome!  it has the remastered original 4-6 and I realize that some people don't like the things that were added (Jabba slithering around, the CGI singer added in Jabba's palace, etc.) but that is neither here nor there.  For the value, I don't think you can find a better deal, and if you did, it was a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.  Also, if Han Solo would have given Princess Leia an STD, they would have titled the movie ""Star Warts""

one thing that confuses me is how small is Chewbacca's manhood?  he doesn't wear pants the entire series and even the ewoks wore tunics.",1421280000,,660,4.421487603305785

Hopefully now that Disney owns Star Wars they will dump those three pieces of trash and restore the originals to their former glory.

7219095,5,B00YI71PN2,"So I want to start by saying Im a huge Star Wars Movie fan along with a even larger fan of the Star Wars EU material. First and foremost I love the fan boy complains of George Lucas destroyed these films Its funny because artistic rendering is a constant thing. The Mona Lisa has been altered Da Vincis Last Supper has been altered in color state. However, Lucas changes a few light sabers and the geek world goes insane. So rant over here is my review.
Blue Ray quality: The discs are of great quality. Granted I do enjoy the original grainy look that 4-5-6 had but with the right TV (Currently using a Samsung UN8550 60 inch 4K LED) it looks amazing. The sound is only 5.1Dolby so anyone with a decent sound system is going to notice the difference from 7.1 3D and the 5.1. However, it still sounds amazing. You can notice the difference between Episode 1 and 2-3 in CGI quality. Personally I felt Episode was much better in quality than E1.
Commentary: I love commentary and enjoy watching the movies with it on and getting to hear all new takes and views. The bonus disks are cool and its great to see how the cast acted behind scenes along with the art that goes into the movies.

My only complaint is the box the disc came in. Its cardboard! Really? Cardboard? I mean I understand most box sets are 95% cardboard but they just sit in a cardboard sleeve that make it easy to scratch. Personally I would have preferred a plastic rings or a plastic sleeve. However, you do get an entire serious for under 100$ so complaint is minimal. I would say even if you're a Lucas hater purchase them as the first three episodes are of great quality and the bonus material is nice.",1420761600,2,1673,4.362179487179487

Menu works well, sound and video quality are fantastic, and when you pause it puts a location bar on the bottom of the screen that is really nice.  The only complaint I have is it's SOOOOO slow to get to the menu after you put the DVD in.  It goes thru multiple warnings and those credit screens like where you see the searchlights and hear the horns and blah, blah.  There is just no need for it to take so long to get to the point where you can start the movie.

And most of them like 'Rylee Lauritson' have only ever given one review. Can you say fake account or spambot?

Sorry guys, I just wanted to let you know that were not all so easily fooled by your dark tactics. Its either execs from the studio or enslaved interns at Skywalker Ranch being forced to raise the rating of this epic abomination. Sorry George this boxset is as tarnished as your legacy.

I hope all the victims of Lucas Stockholm Syndrome will one day be cured. May the force be with you.

Update:  I saw a scathing one star review about how George Lucas has lost his mind and guess what?  It has mysteriously vanished.  Its fascism when some one censors the opinions of others and controls the message.

If you're a fan of the original series, and can't stand the awful CGI changes that look cartoon-like, then save your money and buy the DVD trilogy. It's very sad that this set doesn't at least give you the option to watch it in its original glory. What a letdown.",1418428800,15,550,4.5

7219229,5,B00YI71PN2,"I have given this five stars to make this review appear to those who are thinking about purchasing this compilation, as that's the ratings people will more than likely be reading to help determine if they'll be buying and these are the ones I wish to reach out to.  So before you bother reading the rest of this, know that I don't own this set nor have I seen it, and this review is not predicated upon its merits nor will be discussing them.  Instead, I'm writing this in the hope that it will make some question what they are doing in giving Lucasfilm their dime. As many probably already know, the original trilogy you are getting in this set is not what was released in the theatres back in '77, '80, and '83.  They are the Special Editions, rife with significant changes to the outstanding Oscar-awarded editing, audio and effects work, not to mention some such as character modifications.  Since these alterations in the late 90s, Lucas has adamantly and stubbornly refused to give the originals the HD treatment they deserve and has come out and said he considers them ""rough drafts"" and ""unfinished films"" and wishes them forgotten, in the hopes they'll be replaced and remembered only by the Special Editions.  Not only is he letting them fade away through neglect, he is actively going out of his way in the attempt to eradicate them from the history books altogether--using his clout to close screenings, confiscating every remaining 35mm reel when one pops up, even going so far as to take on the National Film Registry to have their original copy of the print (one of the only few remaining) replaced, which thankfully has so far been unsuccessful.

This may not appear to be a big deal on the surface to a lot of people.  ""They're just movies, not to mention they're Lucas' movies.....he can do as he wishes with his creation"".  This is a whole different debate altogether that I won't address here, but the fact of the matter is that the issue at hand here transcends what Star Wars represents. Lucas is attempting to revise a very important part of our history.  I don't mean to come off as preachy or pretentious in saying this, but this is something that needs to be fought against with all of our effort and means, not just for the benefit of the movies, the people that helped create them, but for society's sake as well.  The relevance that the unaltered trilogy represents in terms of our greater culture, to many peoples' lives, not least to mention the contributions it's played to the advancement in various areas of the motion picture, sfx and entertainment industries cannot be overemphasized.  Star Wars is tremendous in the breadth of its accomplishments that extend far past cinema.  In that, it has earned its place in time and needs to be accorded the respect it deserves by keeping the originals preserved in the manner in which they were released, not only for posterity's sake, but for historical relevance.  If we brought Shakespeare or Michelangelo back from the dead tomorrow and they told us they wished to alter their work (not in compliment, but as a replacement), we'd laugh at them and justifiably tell them to go take a hike.  There is no difference here.

Think twice as to where your money is going if you're considering this purchase.  Don't be a part of historical revisionism.  This really isn't about Star Wars in the large scope of things, what's happening in this case just exemplifies the principle at stake.  If practices such as Lucas is doing are allowed to continue, all art will eventually be endangered, and the implications and ultimate ramifications to our cultural heritage will be dire and very dangerous.

All that said, if you still wish to have all of these films, I'd advise buying used or finding ""other"" means to obtain them.  If you'll pardon the pun, a new hope does exist for those that wish to retain a copy of the original theatrical trilogy as seen in '77, '80, and '83. I cannot provide direct links (even though the legality of such fan remasters are grey if you already have bought any of the films in the past), but just punch in 'Harmy's Despecialized Editions' into Google or Youtube to get started.  If anyone is interested but unsure about the process on how to go about getting the originals and needs assistance, simply leave any questions in the comments below and I'd be glad to help in whatever way I can. With a little basic tech know-how and research you can soon have these magnificent films as originally shown (the first film even lacks the ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" subtitle between the main title and crawl which was put in a few years later after initial the release--how hardcore nerdy can ya get?) sitting unaltered on your shelf in beautiful full HD glory....ironically very safe from the constant meddling hand of its creator. This edition is also very professionally done with rumored assistance from anonymous sources within Lucasfilm that provided some of the source material for the transfers. Thank Heavens there are those out there who truly appreciate Lucas' films more than he does. Do yourself a favor and grab them instead of this if you are considering supporting what Lucas is doing. Instead, support those who understand the importance of and honor a history worthy of remembrance.

Because as it stands, Lucas deserves no such support to the legacy he is doing nothing but helping to desecrate.",1417737600,2,5407,4.742004264392324

Could I tell what changes were made. Not really, but still ... I'm old fat and grumpy. You can't change me, and I'd rather have the movie with all the warts and errors.

It's Just NOT RIGHT that they ""corrected"" after production and viewing on the big screen.

Was I disappointed yes, but I was not going to spend the hundreds of dollars on Amazon to buy the used original versions.

So, buy this set. You will likely never notice the changes. The prices is great and the quality was also. Plus since Amazon is the shipper you can always send it back if you don't like it...

7219234,4,B00YI71PN2,"I won't bore you with listing the many changes that George Lucas has made to his beloved Trilogy of space films (you can find those details in other reviews), I will tell you that Star Wars movies have never looked or sounded better than they do on these Blu-ray discs.

I personally HATE some of the changes made to Star Wars and Return Of The Jedi, but these are the only versions available on Blu and we have to live with them (for now). I like to skip through the cantina scene anyhow so I can avoid seeing Jedi Han Solo dodging a blaster shot from 3 feet away. The Prequel movies are a mixed bag (some lazy CGI work, extremely boring political nonsense, Jar Jar Binks, horrible line delivery, jokes intended for 5 year olds one minute and children being slaughtered the next, etc) but let's face it, you're about to buy this set regardless of any reviews. It's STAR WARS after all.

The extras are pretty good (Star Wars tv clips is really fun) but the stand out is the great documentary ""Star Warriors"", which follows some 501st cosplayers from all over the world. It was very cool and heatwarming to see how Star Wars brings all different kinds people together and the movies can actually help with personal loss.

Star Wars has actually become much bigger than the movies at this point so it barely matters what changes are made to the original films. It's a cultural phenomenom and even people who hate four of the six movies can still be considered hardcore fans. No other series has the power of Star Wars. You're almost considered a social pariah if you haven't at least seen these movies.  Buy this set and enjoy it for what it is, not what you wish it was. The HD picture and sound are stunning and if you hate the changes, skip 'em and move onto the next scene.

Remember kids, Han never shot first, he's the only one who shot at all. This is how it went down. Period.",1417564800,,1883,4.399425287356322

7219243,4,B00YI71PN2,"If this was a review of Episodes IV-VI, I would obviously be giving a 5 star review. Unfortunately, Episodes I-III exist as a big stain on the Star Wars legacy. I was very disillusioned over a year before Episode I was released in theaters because Lucasfilm flooded the stores with all kinds of Episode I paraphernalia, from figurines of a weird, muppet-looking character that no one had seen before to children's underwear featuring the same unlikely character. Lucas knew that Star Wars is a cash-cow, and as a purist, I resented the cheapening of the brand by selling absolutely anything you could put a logo on, and so long before the movie came out, at that. So, I boycotted Episodes I,II, and III and just finally got around to watching them last month. On the one hand, I kind of wish that I had never watched them, because they definitely aren't good. Lucas knows where the money comes from, and he purposefully made the movie more child-friendly. Granted, military sci-fi is usually marketed to teenagers, but these movies were made for six year olds. On the other hand, I'm glad that I gave the movies a chance because I may have been pleasantly surprised. Now, I just hope Disney *cringe* can do a better job with the next three episodes.",1416700800,,1249,4.681818181818182

The actual transfers are just beautiful. The OT looks like it was released today and the PT looks like it is almost popping out onto the screen.

Watching widescreen with black bars at the bottom at top and bottom of the screen actually DAMAGES your screen!  Since I paid a lot for my 4K Samsung, I am very sensitive about this....  This set unlike many, allows you to zoom to use every pixel on your screen.  The transfers were done well, even the first time-wise episode ""A new Hope"" has great resolution, and upscales even to 4K with ease.....  I really think we need a class- action suit against manufacturers that prohibit zoom, as they are damaging our screens (read the manual, Samsung recommends no more than 11% viewing of cut-off screens).

No comment on the extras, I only watch the movies.  Seeing how it was done is like knowing how David Copperfield flies...  It ruins the experience.

7219278,5,B00YI71PN2,"Star Wars: The Complete Saga is the collection of all Star Wars films from Episodes I to IV.

*Star Wars Episode I:The Phantom Menace - Obi-Wan Kenobi is a young apprentice Jedi knight under the tutelage of Qui-Gon Jinn. While Anakin Skywalker is just a nine-year-old bo and who obviously we will know as the father of Luke Skywalker and very well know as Darth Vader.

*Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones - Young Anakin Skywalker is an apprentice to a respected Jedi knight in Obi-Wan Kenobi.

*Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith - Anakin Skywalker becomes the Darth Vader.

*Star Wars Episode IV:A New Hope - a young jedi named Luke Skywalker assembles his motley crew of allies including space rogue Han Solo and two ""droids"" -- C3PO and R2D2 -- to rescue Princess Leia, the rebel leader of her planet from the clutches of the evil Empire as embodied by its enforcer Darth Vader

*Star Wars Episode V: Empire Strikes Back - The Galactic Empire, under the leadership of the villainous Darth Vader, is in pursuit of Luke Skywalker and the rest of the Rebel Alliance. While Vader chases a small band of Luke's friends across the galaxy, Luke studies the Force under Jedi Master Yoda. But when Vader captures Luke's friends, he must decide whether to complete his training and become a full Jedi Knight or to confront Vader and save his comrades.

*Star Wars Episode VI: The Return Of The Jedi - Han Solo emerges intact from the carbonated casing in which he'd been sealed. The bad news is that Solo, together with Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, is prisoner to the grotesque Jabba the Hutt. But with the help of the charismatic Lando Calrissian, our heroes and our heroine manage to escape. The evil Galactic Empire, with the help of the villainous Darth Vader, is building a second Death Star in order to crush the Rebel Alliance which brings to the conclusion wherein the we get to know that Luke Skywalker's real father is the Darth Vader.

This is a great film collection for a Star Wars fan as it includes a numerous bonus features that they would surely enjoy like special features and documentaries about the all six films. Upon owning this one,a fan can only hope for the release of Star Wars VII next year on the big screen. You will definitely get your money's worth.",1414022400,,2295,4.624078624078624

Even the original trilogy, shot and originally mastered with much older technology, looks great. Facial close-ups are highly detailed even in Episode IV. There's really nothing I can say that's critical of this without going into detail about the story, but that's for forums, not a product review.

Although some people like the story retcons and some hate them, I didn't feel that they really had a significant impact on my opinion of the product. I was just so impressed by how engaging the visuals are now, in all six movies, and it really helped me focus on the story and pick up little bits and pieces that I missed despite having watched each movie more times than I can count (on older media and worse quality TVs). It's impressive what they can do these days with digital remastering.",1413072000,10,1024,4.818181818181818

It will provide you hours of good entertainment. Once you get to the last 3 movies it will provide you hours of great entertainment. If you are a die hard and have to have the original trilogy theatrical version you can find laser disc rips on the net.

It's a modified movie with additional scenes added, my kids had never seen any of the star wars movies before, we were able to have a weekend marathon. They loved it, the little one cried when Darth Vader died. Great family movie nights. We seen it more than once now. Artwork on box kinda hoaky and paper sleeves for discs, lame, but there are 3 bonus discs that we'll never watch cause we're not hard core like that, but they're there.",1412294400,,477,4.370786516853933

The product shipping was great, no issues.
Im a stickler for damaged movie boxes, but this was in great condition.

No for some reason, the Episode IV disk likes to skip some parts of the movie on its own. Ill have to rewind the movie a bit if i want to see the skipped part. there is no scratches on the disc, so im not sure whats causing this. All the other movies play perfectly fine, so im thinking it might be a manufacturing issue on that disc only.

However, the most recent trilogy left a lot to be desired. Like most fans, I am also disappointed that the original version of the initial trilogy is not here. Also, the fact that Georgie Boy keeps altering the movies is very frustrating. I am sure he will keep altering them until the day he dies and by that time they will probably have evolved into totally different movies. Take the advice of the fans George, ""Leave'em be!"" At least offer the originals in Blu-Ray. I mean come'on man. That said. All the movies are visually stunning in Blu-ray and the music is awesome. Being a fan, I am little more critical than most. The last trilogy just didn't do it for me. It was okay, but not even close to the original. Time will tell if Disney can do any better. 5 stars for the original trilogy(would have been awesome if the original versions were included). 3 stars for the 2nd trilogy. 4 stars total.",1407628800,,1033,4.297435897435897

7219431,5,B00YI71PN2,"If you are a serious--no I mean SERIOUS Star Wars fan, then you would probably want this now
out of print Blu Ray collection.  See the problem is, George Lucas has this peculiar idea that
the films are HIS, not the fan base's films!  Which means, every time a new format comes out,
he changes stuff.  [See ""The People vs. George Lucas].  The most outrageous was the scene
in the very first film ""Star Wars"", in which Luke and Obe Wan Kenobi meet Han Solo and the
Wookie at the space port.  A bounty hunter was also looking for Solo.  In the original theatrical
version, and the VHS tape version, Solo shoots the bounty hunter from under his table at the
bar.  When it was revised for Blu-Ray, Lucas tinkered with it and had the bounty hunter shoot
(slightly) first yet, incredibly, MISS from about 3 feet away!  Why is this important?

Well, in the original version Han Solo's character starts out completely self-interested.  He is
not interested in the laws or in anyone else, just making good money.  He had no problem
with shooting a bounty hunter who was looking for him.  In the re-make, Lucas seemed to
decide to make it more ""kid"" (or teen?) friendly with the artifice that the bounty hunter shot
first (though Solo's shot follows so closely after that he would have had to intend it ANYHOW).

This version is out of print but includes an original (DVD) version that still shows the movie as
it appeared in theatres.  You won't find that in more modern versions.  It's still an epic series
(though Lucas himself is best with special effects, not so much at directing actors nor at
script writing--sorry George--I know you are wealthy enough that you shouldn't care).  The
series will remain in film history.",1404518400,,1715,4.6105610561056105

7219442,5,B00YI71PN2,"I won't go into great detail about the plot, characters, etc. There are plenty of other reviews that cover those aspects.

This is now one of my favorite movie series. I have always been a Star Wars fan, but had only seen the first 3 (Episodes IV, V, VI) prior to buying this set. In fact, I owned the non-blueray/original DVDs.

There are a lot of posts/reviews out there stating that Lucas ruined the movie by changing ""major"" aspects of the original films when the film was cleaned up both for sound quality and picture quality. I even have friends that refuse to watch the blueray version because of this.

I tend to think these posts are malarkey. Yes, there were a few noticeable changes, but only because I read so many posts complaining about them. I would never have known had I not read the reviews. The plot doesn't change, nor do the characters by adding an extra ""NOOOOO!"" to a scene. Other people tend to disagree - which is fine, I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan boy out there, but I do love the movies. Unless you have every scene and every line memorized, I think you will find the changes minimal and conducive to the viewing experience.

Now, for my favorite part. The sound was amazing. The 5.1 added a whole new dimension to these movies. Rather than hear a ship whiz by, you FEEL the ship whiz by. I cranked the volume up on my surround sound and felt more immersed in the movies than I have ever felt.

Whether you are an avid Star Wars fan or just getting into the series, I would highly recommend this set. You won't regret it.",1403222400,2,1553,4.378472222222222

7219447,1,B00YI71PN2,"I was in high school when the first ""Star Wars"" came out. Being the only person my age who read ""Time"" magazine, I was familiar with it before anyone else I knew had heard of it. That didn't last long. ""Star Wars"" was the first, and possibly the only movie I ever waited hours in line to see, and as it turned out, my friends and I ended up in the front row, scrunched down in our seats, heads tipped back, brains correcting automatically for the skewed perspective.

""Time"" went gaga over it, and so did I - up to a point. I was intrigued enough to see the sequels when they came out, but mystified when a girl I dated in high school told me that she had seen ""Star Wars"" 80 times. 80 times! This was before home video, so that achievement involved a lot of scratch, and an investment of time comprising a significant percentage of her fourteen years of life until then. And I am sure many people would say that this was not, in certain circles, particularly extraordinary.

Many years later, I rented ""Star Wars,"" thinking my 5 year old would enjoy it. He wandered out of the room after a few minutes. Clearly, approaching the film with no exposure to the culture, the hype, the history of ""Star Wars,"" simply as a self-contained movie, it wasn't anything special. A few years later, we dutifully attended the ""prequels"" as they came out. Most people who ""hate George Lucas"" see the prequels as a betrayal of the ""authentic"" Star Wars of their youth. Maybe they are. Or maybe, with age and experience, it's easier to see the series as the empty, crass exploitation of ""mythology"" that it is.

What the ""Time"" reviewers - people of my parents' generation - were responding to was the reiteration of the corny sci-fi flicks of their youth, presented with cutting-edge, 1970s-era special effects. Lucas wasn't just making another space opera - he was taking the genre seriously! As if it meant something, and was important. So for that older generation, it wasn't just a fun sci-fi romp, but a validation of their youth and what had been important to them - because it was treated as if it had always been important, and still was. The problem was, when people my age were confronted with Jar-Jar Binks, it called into question the validity of the original experience. It was as if, at the end of the original ""Star Wars,"" the camera had panned back to reveal the soundstages and plastic models. In this case, what was revealed was Lucas' utter artistic bankruptcy.

There was never anything even remotely authentic about the entire franchise. Lucas raided various sources of legend and mythology to create an incoherent hodgepodge, only convincing to youngsters who had no idea what was going on, or older people who were so entranced with the nostalgia that they willfully ignored what was nothing more than the blatant exploitation of traditional culture, to sell a product. Lucas is the Richard Wagner of his day, employing formidable talent and resources to create an ""epic"" that at its heart is meaningless - a rambling mess that periodically touches on what could be mistaken for profound meaning. It reminds you of life's universal truths without exploring them or discovering anything new; all the work, as it were, has been done by others before, and Lucas does little more than pick up a few pieces and inject them into a vehicle composed of zooming spaceships and spectacular explosions. The betrayal is not of the original ""Star Wars;"" Star Wars itself is the betrayal from the very first frame.

I suspect that the anger many people will feel upon reading this is more about their own realization that they are being fooled, and want to continue to be fooled without anyone exposing the illusion. Too often, people confuse what is truly good with what they like. There's nothing wrong with enjoying the shoot-em-up, dancing robot glee of ""Star Wars,"" but it shouldn't be confused with truly good movies. There are movies out there that are made for adults, and they are difficult because they challenge us and give us something to come to grips with. We know what they are, but we want candy instead of vegetables, and think because we are eating vegetable-colored candy, that we are actually being nourished.",1402704000,12,4222,4.723202170963365

7219458,5,B00YI71PN2,"Firstly I must say that I have always loved the original trilogy especially part IV, and had high hopes for the prequal trilogy kicking off with A Phantom Menace cinematic release. Alas at the time of it's release I was disapointed with this first film and not too impressed with Attack Of The Clones either. Revenge Of The Sith did complete the story in impressive style,  but i never got the Wow expirience of the original trilogy.

The original versions of the original trilogy are burned into our minds as timeless classics and any changes to them will be hard to swallow. George Lucas has found ways to tie these films together and that meant going back to these original films to add or alter parts.

These are great family films that are now presented in their best format to date in both sound and picture quality. Yes maybe a slightly soft look to a few of them but still superb looking.

Personally I think that along with most of these new additions and alterations, the Darth Vader No...Noooo work extremely well once you have deprogrammed yourself from the original versions.

Since watching this bluray saga set i have a new appreciation for George's vision and for the first time really enjoyed The Phantom Menace!

IMHO Revenge Of The Sith is George's best work ...yes better than A New Hope and Empire.

Episode 1 leaves a bit to be desired, but my kids love it the best.  I think #2 is fantastic exempt for the terrible love story.  And Revenge of the Sith is great as well.

But the 1 star review has nothing to do with the movies.  It has everything to do with the fact that I do not want to buy another set of discs.  I have two kids who seem to have destroyed almost any DVD/Blue Ray disc that is of the slightest interest to them.  They get so worked up and excited, they never put anything back.  Streaming movies has been a god send to us - I no longer need space to store the movies on the bookshelf, and my kids can't destroy them either.

But, for some reason, the one movie (or rather, series of 6 movies) that I would want to buy more than any other isn't available to stream.  In fact, it may be the only movies I know that aren't available to stream.

Why?
Why?
Why?

As a result, I can either view the original theatrical releases which I have on old VHS tapes (but look terrible on my HD television) or I have to go out and actually purchase a blue ray player that only gets used for Star Wars.

Why aren't these available to purchase and stream over Apple TV?
Why aren't these available to purchase and stream over Amazon instant video?

Why are movies that propelled us into the technological future, still stuck in the stone age??

7219478,5,B00YI71PN2,"I loved Star Wars as a kid. Like many who will read this review I literally cannot count the number of times I have seen even one of the films in the original trilogy. But because the movies are so hard to get a hold of if you don't own them, and because I wanted to take a little break from these films that I knew so well, I took about a 5 year break from watching Star Wars. Breaking the streak, I recently bought the Bluray Collection and my wife and I watched all 6 films in the order they were released. It was, to put it lightly, a remarkable experience. There were a number of things I have realized about the films and they are things that make me ok with all 6 films, including the disaster that is known more commonly as ""The Phantom Menace"" (which upon reflection is also a truly horrible name).

The first thing that I realized was that the films simply HAVE to be watched in the order they were made. Not only does it screw up all of the plot lines in the original trilogy to watch the prequels first, but it also mis-represents the idea of the story. If the concept is to show the balance to the force, than the only way you can watch ""The Revenge of the Sith"" without tearing your eyes out, is to remember that Anikin is, indeed, the chosen one to be realized 3 films later.

The second thing I realized is that even though the direction of both trilogies was determined by the same person, we are essentially dealing with a ""re-interpretation"" of the star wars universe. Just like we will see with the release of episode IIV in Dec of 2015. Lucas was a different person, with different values and goals for the prequel trilogy than he was for the original one. Its like trying to compare the Batman movies made by Nolan with the ones made by Tim Burton in the 90s. Same character(s), same universe, different story, different interpretation. Batman too, will see a re-emergence next year, and some will deem it better or worse than past interpretations. This doesn't make it a better or worse interpretation, it just makes it different. Very few, if any, would argue that the newest trilogy is better than the original, but that shouldn't make us think that the prequels should never have been made, or than Lucas somehow made a mistake in doing what he did. The reality is that each interpretation is what it is, and Lucas was not known for good films in the last half of his film making career. He simply started to care about things that his audience no longer cared about. He fell in love with technology and action at the expense of story and innovation, and we didn't like it. In the end, that's what happened. But I don't mind it, I like both trilogies for what they are, I definitely think one is better than the other, but I am starting to wonder if comparing the two against each other is to miss the point of star wars. The point is the world of fantasy that it brings us into, some like the characters and creatures, while others like the locations and action scenes. Some still, are just there for the light saber fights. The beauty is that we can all find some part of the Star Wars universe that resonates with us, and makes us excited about what Abrams might do with it next.

I hope you can watch Star Wars with the same open-mindedness that I now will, it made me enjoy the movies more, and hate Jar Jar a little less, even if he is one of the dumbest characters to make the big screen in the last 2 decades.

FYI: Also, just to hold on to a bit of the old glory, I tracked down an old cassette copy of the original trilogy to show my kids one day. Ill let them interpret for themselves.",1399248000,2,3622,4.2986822840409955

However, a word of warning to all you Star Wars fans - I have two major criticisms with this box set:

1) The picture quality is SO good that it really stands out that Yoda is just a puppet in Episodes I-III and it looks so fake that it spoiled my enjoyment of these movies. Even the puppet used in the the first film looks better on Blu-Ray and that's now 27 years old.

2) Despite being remade in 3-D with all of the original cast , the 3-D on Phantom Menace is hardly noticeable. Really annoyed at this, especially after spending so much extra money on a pair of 3-D glasses.

My advice? The first three are better on DVD because the picture is quite poor so I recommend that you buy the complete Blu-Ray box set, keep the discs of the original films (IV-VI) and sell the others on eBay (but include your old DVDs of Episodes IV-VI to help you sell them).

7219523,5,B00YI71PN2,"During The Tatoine Sandstorm, a deleted sequence from 'Return of the Jedi' included among the bonus features of the Complete Star Wars Saga blu-ray, a caption appears that reads ""Fans whirring loudly."" The sequence in question is evidently raw material, the filmed footage cut together without any polishing or special effects, and the caption is meant to explain the sound that can still be heard of the giant fans used onset to simulate wind. However, ""whirring loudly"" is exactly what Star Wars fans have been doing in regards to this monumental release from Lucasfilm Ltd. Star Wars: The Complete saga packages all six live action Star Wars in one body for the first time ever, and at the same ushers the saga into the HD age with their most pristine audiovisual presentation seen and heard to date, all whilst offering a healthy supplement of extra features, including material some of said fans have been waiting to see released for decades. Also, however, Star Wars creator and visionary filmmaker George Lucas has seen fit to revisit a few moments of the saga with some controversial and rather interesting revisions, continuing his artistic method of editing his films retroactively in an effort to further hone his epic vision into an even richer and more engaging cinematic reality-- and atop these alterations, has chosen not to include the unaltered cuts of the classic original trilogy in this edition.

Firstly, casting aside Geo. Lucas' controversial revisions for the moment, as blu-ray product, I don't feel that this deserves the 2.5 star average rating currently displayed on this site. That rating, everyone should understand, is mainly the result of a particular contingency of the fan base's very narrow focus on a specific aspect of the content of this package. It does not reflect the audiovisual quality of the films; the quality or quantity of supplemental features included; nor even the quality of the films themselves. That's the major reason that I feel a 2.5 star rating is not an accurate or fair reflection of this product overall. If only some people might leave their other baggage behind for a few moment, there might be a rating that doesn't make this product look like a cheap knock-off. Please feel free to campaign as much as you wish against Lucas' artistic decisions, but in view of all the facets of the blu-ray package, I don't believe this particular product deserves one star solely because of that side of things--and no matter what other reasons such negative reviewers provide, I am aware that there is essentially one reason for their negative reviews.

Among the pieces of this package being ignored by the extremist fans, there is certainly no shortage of extras. From the first, Lucasfilm Ltd. has shown that it knows how to put together DVD packages, and this carries over to the blu-ray release. As most people will know, there are three bonus discs here. In what seems to be another instance of Lucas' penchant for conceptual thinking that his films have exhibited in the past (see the core concept of the Force for one instance), the first two discs are labeled as ""Star Wars Archives"", with one disc covering material for the prequel trilogy (Eps. I-III) and the other for the classic or original trilogy (Eps. IV-VI). Each disc is further divided into sections by movie and sub-divided by ""planet"", wherein all of the material in a certain section roughly pertains to the portion of the given movie that takes place on that planet. It sounds convoluted, but in practice, I thought this was a clever, engaging way of arranging a large amount of information. Anything that could categorized as ""featurette"" is incorporated here, and these are the real treasure trove of the release for fans. Apart from the sketches and galleries showing the development of various visual aspects of the films, the most interesting and valuable bits were the afore-alluded-to OT deleted scenes, of which there were plenty, including the Luke/Biggs Tatoine scenes and Luke creating his new lightsaber in ROTj, both of which were genuinely a pleasure for me to watch. It's fantastic to have some of this stuff. Lucas has been withholding these from circulation for sometime, and has finally delivered at least on this front.

There are also some interesting interviews scattered about, including Lucas himself, speaking about his writing process in the early days of writing Episode I, circa late 1994/early '95. Which gives you an idea of how much time Lucas invested in making the prequels--roughly a decade. The third bonus disc, 'The Star Wars Documentaries' is more straightforward. We can always quibble about *which* documentaries should have been included, but overall I'm pleased with what's here, especially the 'Making of Star Wars' documentary on the production of the first film, 'Return of the Jedi: Classic Creatures', 'Anatomy of a Dewback', which features some insight into the late '90s Special Edition restorations of the OT, and an informative feature in which George Lucas, Lawrence Kasdan, and the late lamented Irivin Kerschner, among others, discuss the making of 'Empire Strikes Back'. [This is especially interesting to me because it notes that, in spite of Leigh Brackett's onscreen credit, Lucas was quite heavily involved with the screenplay for this film.] Do keep in mind, on the ""Archives"" discs that the prequel extras are somewhat sparser. I think this is partially the effect of Lucas and co seeking not to repeat features that had been included on past DVDs, for fear of being criticized for ""double dipping."" That's probably the same reason 'Empire of Dreams' and other such documentaries are not present, but it looks like Lucas can't win on that one: when he doesn't repeat special features, he gets flak for leaving stuff out, but if he'd repeated very much from the previous DVDs, I suspect people would have complained about that as well. At least the SW Archives concept is a fresh approach to exploring the obviously immense amount of material that exists pertaining to the creation of these films.

Speaking of concepts, one of the first things I did upon purchasing and safely lugging home my copy of the Complete Saga was to examine the packaging, leafing through the discs to make sure everything appeared to be in place and undamaged. Unlike others, I can't complain of any missing or misplaced discs (but would nonetheless recommend the prudent consumer ascertain whether they have this sort of issue to deal with before proceeding any further), and neither has the book-style packaging commented on by others yet harmed any of the blu-rays, in spite of the tight disc slots and lack of prongs to hold anything in place. Actually, I find the packaging art to be rather interesting in itself. When the cover photograph, pictured at the top of this page, was first released online, some fans found it odd compared to previous releases, and possibly unbefitting of a Complete Saga collection; words like ""amateurish"", or the simpler ""horrible"" were even used. I personally found the concept of the cover art--a visual depiction of the similar yet also divergent journeys of heroes Anakin and Luke Skywalker--interesting and appealing, but I didn't fully understand the hand-drawn look (as opposed to the usual glossiness) of the image until I saw it context for the artwork concept for the entire box set. Each ""page"" of the blu-ray holding book includes a hand-drawn, non-photorealistic sketch into which the disc pocket is built. For each of the six movies, the image chosen is relevant to that film. For instance, Episode I has a drawing of Darth Maul; Episode II shows Anakin and Padme in a romantic setting, through to Episode VI, the chosen image for which shows Luke and Vader dueling in the emperor's throne room. It may not be in line with typical package designs, which usually sport exciting, glossy images of the film's star or something equally profit-driven, but I rather like these mildly artsy drawings myself (sketches really is not quite the word, in that they are all full color illustrations), and they at least show me that some thought when into creating a visually and aesthetically pleasing design for this package rather than just dashing it off (despite complaints about the rather plain dichromatic designs on the surfaces of the discs themselves.) Not surprisingly, then, prejudgment loses out, and the cover image for the complete saga makes much more sense in light of the conceptual style of the package artwork overall.

It is equally evident to me, having now watched the BD films without and without the very enlightening and well-assembled archival interview commentary tracks, similar labor has been put into making these films look and sound the best today that they ever have for home viewing. In honesty, I have only a basic 2-channel stereo setup, so while I'm pretty sure I'm able to pick out much more of the fantastic John Williams score, and the background sound effects, than I was on DVD or VHS, I am not in the best position to comment on the intricacies of the audio presentation, although I'm pretty sure the sound has been remixed in a number of places, most often to beneficial or at least interesting new effect. As to the visual restoration and HD upgrade, I can only say that I have been watching on a 32"" Sharp flat screen, and I never seen these films look clearer or richer. I suspect nothing is perfect, and inevitably the more technically minded viewers will have their reservations about the transfer and restoration. There has been a little talk, from some posters, of film grain elimination, to which I can only say that I see little visible film grain in most shots, and if the deliberate removal of film grain is technically removing some film detail in spite of making the image look nice and clean, the HD upgrade goes quite a ways in compensating for this. Having recently been re-watching the saga (in order from Episode I-VI), I've been noticing details, in the background and foreground, I hadn't picked up on before: ornate designs on walls behind the characters in Amidala's palace on Naboo, or in the fireplace sequence in Episode II; fine details on the neimodians' uniforms, little beads that glisten on the queen's headpiece, and color bars popping out vividly on imperial officers' uniforms. It even seems to me that the improvement image quality is capable of highlighting some previously overlooked subtleties in the actors' visual performances: is it my imagination, or does Ewan McGregor give Liam Neeson a sidelong glance of reproach when the latter chastises him for concentrating on the future at the expense of the moment at the beginning of Episode I?

Speaking of Episode I, I won't go at any great length into my views on the prequels here, as I don't really feel there is time or space for that here; read my individual reviews of the films if you want any more of my thoughts in that area. Suffice it to say that the Star Wars is now intended to be viewed as one epic story, from Episode I to Episode VI, and the prequels are here to say. Many of Lucas' revisions reflect the unity of the saga, particularly in the last segment of Return of the Jedi, which has always been and remains one of my favorite portions of the saga. I would be pointing out the obvious if I explained how Anakin's revamped ghost appearance and the new dialogue during the emperor's death tie the OT more tightly to the PT. The fact remains, with or without a ""no!"" this is one of my favorite parts of the saga. The 1997 version, with extended galactic celebration sequences and new music was, I thought, one of Lucas' better ideas, and I can't say the latest changes do much on their own to detract from this grand finale. I will say that, when I first heard rumors of Darth Vader's ""no!"", I raised an eyebrow--out there, even by Lucas' standards. It is still rather weird. And yet I think, to some extent, it was meant to be. I do think it was clever how the reprise of the ""no!"" from Episode III was mixed in with the music (making it sound, in a strange way, almost operatic, which goes a long way to pay off James Earl Jones' seemingly odd delivery of the line at the time), and I can see what Lucas was aiming for conceptually. Consider:

-The added dialogue is the word ""no!"" twice, yelled once
-Several other times throughout the Star Wars movies, characters yell or say this word at dramatic high points, to express despair, dismay--the negative, in one sense or another
-This recurring line doesn't change the plot line
-It doesn't ever substantively change the character saying it
-It does theoretically enhance the drama of the moment, depending on how it's used
-When Lucas uses it here, it does connect to that device we've seen/heard throughout the other films. Therefore, I think it's safe to say Lucas put in the new dialogue for the sake of strengthening or adding to that device/motif (and also to put a new twist on it, since what Darth is saying ""no!"" to is the negativity, the Dark Side. This time, someone is saying no *to* the negative, rather than only feeling the negative as in past instances when the line was used.)

It's like metaphor or symbolism in a written story; it's there to embellish and enrich. It doesn't change the core of the story, characters, or plot. Symbolisms or repeated devices are simply used in storytelling to express the theme or point in another way, and/or with the intent to somehow enhance or make the narrative more interesting and thought-provoking.

The ""no!"" line in Star Wars is a poetic device of sorts because it is used recurrently to accent the drama and to link certain moments together in the context of the larger narrative's themes--poetry in this sense essentially meaning the way moments within a narrative/story compliment, mirror, have symmetry with each other, or somehow connect with one another in a way that portrays the story's themes or makes for satisfying drama. So for me, Darth Vader's ""no!"" as he seizes the emperor, while certainly not necessary to the films or story, is like a pay off for the recurring use of that line at highly dramatic or pivotal points in the saga. It is, as with every time it's been used, simply a dramatic accent placed to enhance the moment and the portrayal of the character, and to add to the artistic fabric (i.e. all of the devices used to tell the story and express the themes in a more graceful or interesting way) of Star Wars.

On its own merits, I can accept this ""no!"" as much as any other in the saga. Still, I wouldn't miss it if it weren't there, and as for the other blu-ray changes, they are so minor that, while I don't think the films necessarily benefit (I did think Obi-Wan's scream on the '04 DVD was more convincing than the original, but this one may have been taking it too far), I'm certainly not going to dock stars for those things either.

In an ideal world, I wholeheartedly agree that George Lucas would release the original cuts of the OTT (or at least the original 'Star Wars' film) along with his preferred cuts--meaning I would fully support him in doing so now. But it is also his prerogative as to how he wishes to present his movies, so to a great extent I also respect the artistic domain in place here. It remains to be seen whether future BD releases will incorporate the OTT, as Lucas has previously rereleased it on DVD, but for now I think this is an excellent package on its own merits. I can understand, to a degree, some Star Wars fans' ire over Lucas' creative decisions, but again, they are his decision to make, and at the end of the day, any 'Star Wars' fan giving this collection a miss is also missing a substantial amount of the good stuff.

In the meantime, I think I'm going to take the Lucas approach here: since Amazon allows reviewers to return and edit their reviews after posting, I'm going to keep this review open as a work in progress, so I can add new thoughts as they may come to me. I doubt this will actually hurt anyone.

People may think that even the slightest change in the original pictures or scripts is sacrilege, when in fact, any change that he has made is something he would have done anyways if he would've had access to it at the time.

7219597,5,B00YI71PN2,"When time permitted, I watched all six movies and the three bonus discs. (Haven't had time for the commentaries on the six feature discs yet.)

On a HD TV, the blu-ray discs are essential for picture detail! And the detail was there! It was wonderful watching these 2.35:1 movies on my 50-in HDTV (native aspect ratio of approximately 1.78:1), even though to reproduce the Director's intended presentation the movie was letterboxed on the TV.

The down sides: instead of having real disc holders, this collection use cardboard sleeves. Also, Episodes IV-VI are after George Lucas had ""improved"" pieces of them, so they aren't an exact match to the theatrical release. (There is more clutter in some scenes, such as more flying vehicles in the city in the clouds, also the controversial ""Han shot second"", and the change in the celebration at the end of Episode VI.)

If you love Star Wars and want to watch the widescreen movies on a HDTV (or equivalent), this would be a nice acquisition to anyone's movie collection!",1390780800,,1018,4.872832369942197

While some of the movies (episodes) are better than others, you have to have the complete set to get the complete story-line.

I was really taken by the idea of the force being with them and/or me. I had mixed feelings about some of the later movies but  realized they had much to recommend them. Perhaps some are: the imaginative creatures, their unique sounds, the cooperation of the peoples from so many civilizations, the machines and aircraft (some impractical), light sabers, love those capes, Darth Vader, and so much more.
I think the description of the set should have more star names than Mark Hamill. He was not in all the films.",1390262400,,688,4.4603174603174605

I said no that's fine just credit a % of the purchase and I would purchase just the missing disk and return the duplicate disk to them. They would not compromise at all!
I ended up purchasing the correct disk and sold the duplicate on Amazon.

When he opened this Christmas morning, he squealed like a 14 year old girl with a full-sized, scented, anatomically correct, autographed One Direction doll collection, cuddled it, and wiggled around on the floor like a dog with butt itch.

Now, almost a month later, I'm surprised he hasn't worn the discs out.  I know he's watched them each at least twice.  Can't honestly speak for anything except the quality of the box (very nice) because I've been hiding whenever he gets that special gleam in his eye, but I can say this made me the Hero of Christmas '14.",1390003200,,697,4.596774193548387

7219619,4,B00YI71PN2,"I've been a fan of these movies since I was 5 years old and saw ""A New Hope"" for the first time back in 1977.  I think I've paid some of George Lucas' bills with all the variations of these films over the years - from Beta, VHS, VHS widescreen, Laser Disc & DVD.  But something was lacking in the later years not being able to see my favorite movies of all time in high definition.  The opportunity has finally arrived, and is a must for anyone who loves these films.
  Now I know there are many out there who refuse to purchase these since they are the Special Editions and not the originals.  I understand, and feel your pain.  I too long to see the original versions I saw as a child uncut, remastered & in high definition.  Don't worry.  It'll happen at some point, especially after Disney purchased the rights.  But how can you say you'd rather watch your standard definition versions instead of this?
  The only reason I've rated this 4 instead of 5 stars is the tinkering of the films from their original versions.  But until those versions come out, I am perfectly happy with these!",1389312000,,1090,4.39

7219627,1,B00YI71PN2,Do not buy the Star Wars blue ray box set. I am very disappointed with the audio mix for these movies. You would think whoever mastered the sound would have watched it on a standard TV system  before mass producing them. I have slowly watched almost all 6 movies since Christmas and am constantly turning up and down the sound. The music/effects are incredibly loud and the dialogue audio is very quiet.,1389052800,,403,4.597222222222222

7219641,5,B00YI71PN2,"Love these movies.  It must have been challenging to write stories for audiences that knew where the final chapter would end, yet Lucas delivered.

Despite the fact that these films followed the formulas of the first three films they satisfied a die hard Star Wars fan who remembers seeing Episode IV in theaters as a child.

Of course - BLU-Ray makes it that much better.

We watched them all, he pointed out the changes, which other than the addition of CGI in the older movies, I wouldn't have noticed, and he didn't care.

He was thrilled with the gift. And I actually enjoyed watching them. The last movie moved me to tears. Lol",1388448000,3,392,4.213333333333333

7219647,5,B00YI71PN2,Purchased for our 19 year old son who plans  to use it on college weekends with friends for all-Star Wars viewing party.  We watched 3 episodes and felt the Blu-Ray audio was 5 out of 5 in all. Video was 4 of 5 or better but more a function of the movie and time it was made. That is episode 1 and 2 were better than 4.  Well worth the price paid on Amazon.  Comes in nice book-like filing package with art for each episode around the disc sleeve of each.  Deleted scenes and art work was fun to see.  Will serve us many years to come.  What we watched this past weekend was worth the price paid and there's much more to the set!,1388188800,2,629,3.984
7219648,4,B00YI71PN2,"I could go on and on about the completely pointless changes George Lucas has made to the original trilogy over the years but honestly, whats the point? Other reviewers have already said everything that can be said about them ""They take away the integrity of the original films"", ""They only exist to promote digital effects"" and so on and so forth. Honestly, I don't mind most of the changes made to the original trilogy although I still loath a lot of them ('Han Shot FIRST!!!' and Vader shouting ""No.... NOOOOO"" in Episode 6 are my most hated changes).

However if you can overlook these changes, this set has a lot to offer especially if don't already own the saga. The audio and picture quality for each movie is flawless and really show what Blu-Ray is capable of. There are also 3 discs full of extras including vintage documentaries, commentaries, and interviews with the cast and crew.

Then there's the movies, one half of them masterpieces and the other half being stuck in the void of mediocrity. I personally don't think that The Phantom Menace and Revenge Of The Sith are actually that bad. The one movie that I really hate is Attack Of The Clones, I mean, my gosh, the movie does not even try to be good, it exists only to exhibit digital effects. The love story is very implausible and it doesn't help that Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman don't even attempt to act as they deliver almost all of their lines very robotically. The action scenes also go on for far too long and it really makes me wonder if the movie was just made as a giant 2 hour long toy advert.

Then we've got the Original Trilogy, probably the greatest Science Fiction trilogy ever made, and I don't really need to go into much detail, the films are great adventure movies with a lot of heart, action, and good character development to compliment the excellent story. The changes that Lucas has made don't distract me too much unless its the two I mentioned earlier.

Overall this set is well worth the price if your a Star Wars fan and even if your not, there is still a lot to like about this set and I'm glad I picked it up.",1388102400,3,2118,4.4935064935064934

Good:
- All 6 films together in one package
- New and interesting special features and behind the scenes stuff that Star Wars fans love
- The prequel trilogy looks beautiful on blu-ray and is mastered very well

Not So Good:
- Packaging - the envelope style case that you ""slip"" the disks into makes for easy scratching
- Image quality on the original trilogy - A New Hope looks like the color has been pumped up to overblown levels.
- No ""theatrical cuts"" (which I know is a nerd gripe, but we all want them SO bad)

7219684,1,B00YI71PN2,"Dear George,

I am not happy with you. Yes, I admit it. I am angry.

Call me a ""fanboy"" or whatever. Dismiss my opinion however you wish. Say the movies belong to you and you can do whatever you want with them, as you are so fond of repeating. And yes, legions of pro-Lucasites will come to your defense. Or make fun of me and people like me. But they are wrong. You are wrong.

I loved the original trilogy. They were a great part of my childhood. And I still enjoy them as an adult - except for where you have meddled with them. Why, George, why?

Why did you add a bunch of cartoony, distracting CGI junk into the background of the Mos Eisley spaceport?

Why did you change Han's character by trying to make his shooting in the cantina more ""obviously"" self-defense? We already knew it was self-defense! It looks stupid.

Why did you make it so Luke no longer says, ""You're lucky you don't taste so good.""?

Why did you change the music in several parts of the movie, especially at the end of Jedi?

Why did you make Vader say, ""NOOOooooo!""?

Blinking Ewoks? Who gives a ____?

Why did you take out the perfectly acceptable - and fitting - ghost of Sebastian Shaw at the end of Jedi, and put in a totally-out-of-place Hayden Christensen?

Why do you keep making these distracting and pointless changes, while ignoring the things that actually NEED to be fixed? Such as Vader's PINK lightsaber, and Luke's Green-no-it's-Blue-no-it's-White-no-it's-Green-again lightsaber in Star Wars?

I know I'm beating a dead horse here. You're rich. You're successful. You're not going to read this. You don't care. Well, you know what? I think you're arrogant.

Just give us the original CLEANED UP, WIDESCREEN versions on Blu-Ray, and people like me will go away! But no. We're stuck with you and your lousy ""better"" versions of these movies. Until you're gone, at least... Not that I'm mean enough to hope for that. It's just disappointing that your pride has brought us to this.

That's what it's all about. That's why we're stuck with these. You're certainly not above milking another blu-ray release. But you don't want to give us what we want because it doesn't conform to your pure ""vision"" of what Star Wars ought to be. Well, that's a load of horse hockey George!",1386115200,17,2261,4.62

Episode IV

Episode II
Episode III
Episode VI

There is no need to ever watch Episode I. Just don't.

Other than the need to avoid Jar Jar, I really enjoy the quality of the video. In fact, the original footage looks so good on Blu-Ray that the additional CGI added in the 1997 re-release looks even more out of place.",1386028800,,460,4.337209302325581

I can't really say I play around with the disc content much as I typically have the intention on watching the desired movie start to finish without having to play around with scene selection or bookmarks or whatever these fancy players are capable of doing nowadays.

As far as the media content...I'm sure you've read in countless sources about the additional edits to movies.  They're DISTRACTING, and I really hope to find a re-release of this set with those edit REMOVED.  Vader screaming ""NOOOOOOOOOOO"" at the end of Episode III was already a laughable affair, so I can't quite see where one thought it was okay to add this talentless moment to the end of Return of the Jedi.  The scream Kenobi performs to scare off the Tuskens in Episode IV was also very confusing and felt very out of place.

7219687,5,B00YI71PN2,"My review hopefully will be helpful for all the parents out there.  I have four kids ranging in ages from 3-9.  Below is the reaction of each of my kids for each episode.  I will update this review as they watch each movie.  We started with Episode IV just like i did when i was a kid.  I hope this review will help you if you are trying to decide if your child will be interested based on their age.

Episode IV : A New Hope
1 (Gender - Girl Age - 3) : Fell Asleep after 30 minutes.  She seemed interested in it, but at that age it seems like 30 minutes is the max attention you can get.
2 (Gender - Boy Age - 5) : Watched the entire thing.  At some moments he seemed to get a little scared but it would only last about 2 seconds and he was fine.
3 (Gender - Girl Age - 7) : Watched the whole thing and had questions the whole time.  Seemed to be very interested in the characters more than the battle and plot.
4 (Gender - Girl Age - 9) : The most interested of all the kids.  Didn't say anything the whole time.  After the movie was finished wanted to start Episode V

Overall as a dad there was only a few parts i felt like maybe the kids should not see. My kids mostly watch the disney channel so this really was there first PG movie that they have seen.  The part where obi wan kenobi gets killed was a part that i looked over at the kids to see their reaction.  They all seemed fine.

Episode V : The Empire Strikes Back
1 (Gender - Girl Age - 3) : Only lasted about 10 minutes and then was off to go play with her toys.
2 (Gender - Boy Age - 5) : Only lasted about 1 hour and asked me if we could start it over another day.
3 (Gender - Girl Age - 7) : Stopped watching after about 1 hour also, and said she was not into all the 'spaceship battles'.  She really liked the character portions of the movie and not so much the ship scenes.
4 (Gender - Girl Age - 9) : Once again was the most interested of all the kids.  Never got up once to leave, and didn't say anything during the movie.

Overall this one was the least interesting for the kids between episode IV and V.  My oldest said that she liked the movie but liked episode IV better.  This had a few scenes that made me cringe for the kids.  When the Wampa caught Luke and held him in the cave.  The Wampa is sitting in the cave eating the Tauntaun.  Also, after Luke frees himself, he slices off the Wampa's arm.  Also, when Han rescues Luke in the snow, he slices open the Tauntaun's belly to place Luke inside.  All of these parts where a little uncomfortable for me as a dad with young kids.  Add in the part where Luke loses his arm to Vader and this movie between the two was a little worse in that way.

Episode VI : Return of the Jedi
1 (Gender - Girl Age - 3) : Only lasted about 30 before she fell asleep.
2 (Gender - Boy Age - 5) : Watched the whole thing and was extremely interested.
3 (Gender - Girl Age - 7) : Loved the ewoks.  She was really into this movie.
4 (Gender - Girl Age - 9) : Understood the relationship between the different characters.  Really like the ewoks as well.  Seemed to be sad about Darth Vader's end.

The kids loved this one.  The ewoks really captured the kids attention.  I think this movie helped peek their interest for the other three movies to come.

Episode 1 : The Phantom Menace
1 (Gender - Girl Age - 3) : Was in and out of the room during the whole movie, but seemed to be more interested in this movie than any of the other three.
2 (Gender - Boy Age - 5) : Watched the whole thing and actually understood that Anakin was Darth Vader when he was younger.
3 (Gender - Girl Age - 7) : Loved the movie, especially the queen and when she revealed her true self before the battle it seemed to be a real nice surprise for her.
4 (Gender - Girl Age - 9) : Loved this movie as well.  The relationship between Anakin and The Queen really seemed to be of interest for both of my older girls.  Whereas my son seemed more interested in the battle scenes.

I know the die-hard Star Wars people out there hate jar jar binks, but all four of my kids loved him.  They actually had a lego character of him and never new who he was.  Now after seeing him in the movie they were super excited to know who he was.  They laughed at him every time he did something dumb and kind of made the movie for them.  Of course the girls loved the queen also.  All the kids constantly want to know who is good and who is bad.  Part of me wants to tell them right away but I kept it secret like when I was younger.  They quickly seemed to understand who was good and who was bad.

Episode 2 : Attack of the Clones

7219692,5,B00YI71PN2,"I am a huge Star Wars fan and have enjoyed all six movies. I've always loved the worlds, characters, and stories to the Star Wars films. I decided to review each individual film to give my thoughts on each.

Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace

The Phantom Menace, which is the beginning of the saga, is my least favorite of the three prequels. It's not exactly Star Wars-y and Jar Jar Binks is annoying. However, though those things are true, that doesn't mean it's un-enjoyable. The problems are clear, but the Phantom Menace is quite far from being a bad movie. The main hero, Qui-Gon Jinn, and the main villain, Darth Maul, are some of the best characters in the Star Wars saga, and the film features an interesting story and epic battle sequences. The Blu-Ray version of this film replaces that bad Yoda puppet with the awesome CGI one, which is good, being as that was one of my biggest problems with this movie. Perhaps my biggest problem other than Jar Jar Binks is, like Return of the Jedi, the film is a little too slow. However, upon seeing it on Blu Ray, I was strongly impressed with how good the CGI was. Obviously, there were some ugly spots (it IS a 1999 movie, after all), but there were also many impressive spots, too. Though it's the least like Star Wars, it's place in the canon is clear. It's not an unnecessary movie, and it is quite enjoyable too.

The Phantom Menace Final Score: 7.5/10

Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones

Attack of the Clones fixes my problem with The Phantom Menace not being very Star Wars-y and improves on it in most ways. The story is even more interesting and is crucial to the Star Wars saga. Though The Phantom Menace was quite epic, some of the most memorable scenes in Star Wars come from Attack of the Clones. Yoda using his lightsaber for the first time to viewers and the Jedi coliseum fight are just to name a few. Though it does suffer from a cliche romance and some bad acting (particularly Natalie Portman, who I've never seen act very well), the pros to Attack of the Clones make those cons seem unnoticeable. Just before you begin to throw up at Anakin and Padme's romance scenes, the film cuts off to Obi-Wan and his more interesting plot. Also, this movie contains a lot of nods to IV, V, and VI; such as the Death Star plans and Anakin losing one of his hands. Is there too much CGI? I personally don't think so. Unlike movies like Peter Jackson's The Hobbit Trilogy, pretty much all of the CGI is needed to complete the movie (try creating Courascant with ""practical effects""). Out of all the Star Wars films, this one is my second favorite, mainly because it was the film that got me into the franchise. (Don't judge me!)

Attack of the Clones Final Score: 8.7/10

Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith

Revenge of the Sith is by far my favorite Star Wars film. It has the best story, some of the best action, and a distinct lacking of things such as bad acting and romance. I've always liked the acting to the Star Wars films, but even actors like Hayden Christensen, who I've never cared much for, were actually pretty good (unfortunately, Natalie Portman never seems to improve). Anakin himself was a much more likable guy (until, you know, he kills the innocent children), which is explained due to the fact that he's older. One of the many things that makes Episode III great is that it is easily the darkest of the Star Wars movies. The dramatic transformation into Darth Vader was very moving, and my heart sunk to my stomach when I saw the brotherly bond between Anakin and Obi-Wan shatter. This film has hardly anything wrong with it, despite a bad line or two. The satisfying finale to the Star Wars saga (because it was released in theaters last) boasts some of the best special effects and action sequences of any sci-fi movie to date. Seriously, this movie is amazing.

Revenge of the Sith Final Score: 9.5/10

Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope

The start to the Original Trilogy is very well made, filled with memorable characters and great special effects and music. The story actually isn't that original. It's a simple rebellion story with a sci-fi twist. It's by no means bad. In fact, that was probably the best way to make an old sci-fi film. This is made up for with the characters. Pretty much everybody recognizes Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan (Ben) Kenobi, and Darth Vader. The characters are very well developed (even though it's still gross that Leia kissed her brother), and are remembered for good reason. The thing I dislike most about this movie is its ending. The great villain Darth Vader is defeated as simply as he was isn't exactly a satisfying conclusion (I'm big into spectacular fight scenes). It's a good thing that there were two more chapters after it, because the Star Wars story wouldn't have been that great if it had ended there.

A New Hope Final Score: 8.2/10

Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back

The Empire Strikes Back is very similar to A New Hope. In fact, it took me forever to decide which film I like better. Episode IV had a better beginning, but a worse ending. I ultimately decided that since Episode V had a better more climactic ending (featuring a great lightsaber battle and the famous ""I am your father"" line), it was my preferred movie. Like Episode IV, the story is relatively simple. The great characters return, and new ones are introduced such as Lando, Han's old friend. The Jedi master Yoda's introduction was very funny and was a great way to introduce the character (back in the day). What's great is that the puppet is so realistic that it doesn't need to be replaced by a CGI model unlike the one in theatrical release of The Phantom Menace. Being one of the darkest Star Wars films (second to Episode III) Episode V is a great film and a true classic.

The Empire Strikes Back Final Score: 8.5/10

Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi

To me, Return of the Jedi is the weakest Star Wars film. Not just in the Original Trilogy, but in the entire six-part saga. Though it ends the series well, that's pretty much all it does. The Original Trilogy was one big story where IV was the beginning, V was the middle, and VI was the end. That being said, Episode VI has virtually no story of it's own, except for a couple of repeats of IV's plot (e.g. blowing up the Death Star). All it does is end the story. I wish that this film had a bit more of a plot like the first five films did. This film suffers from too much filler. Most of the Endor events and characters (particuarly Ewoks) are really uninteresting. Now don't get me wrong, it's a great way to finish to the series. I'm just saying that's almost all it's good for. I can't watch it without watching IV and V first. Even still, the way the ending is pulled off is great. The climactic battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader carries a lot of emotional depth and is very satisfying for the chronological end of the saga (until, you know, Episode VII comes out in 2015).

Return of the Jedi Final Score: 6.8/10

The Verdict

As I said before, I am a huge Star Wars fan. I grew up watching both Originals and Prequels, so I'm not exactly biased to any in particular. Ever since I saw Episode II in theaters (I had seen IV, V, and VI on DVD earlier), Star Wars has been one of my favorite movie franchises. These films truly are classics and being able to own all six on Blu-ray is a great thing to do. That, plus it coming with tons of bonus features, is enough to say how easy it is for me to recommend this collection. This package is great purchase for any Star Wars fan.

Sound effects are loud, crisp and dialogue is nice and consistent. Next would be the picture quality; it's really great and makes the movies that much more up to date. The packaging is nice and solid. The only negatives I would have to complain about is the few added voices to certain scenes.

7219705,3,B00YI71PN2,"where to begin.  This is the entire Saga(or Hextillogy) of the six movies to be watched in order(unless you hate the prequal in which case you wil buy only the Original Trilogy also available) Though I am not a fan of the first movie(to save confusion I refer to the ""Episode 1"" as the ""first"" movie and Episode IV as the ""4th"" movie in chronological order-if you don't,, use your intelligence) I kind of want to rate this 4 stars instead of 3 except for the insipid use of muppet-style CGI used in Return of the Jedi and the first movie ""Phantom Menace"" for other reasons other than the well used CGI.  Reason, because I did enjoy Empire Strikes Back which didn't come across as a cartoon as much as the 4th movie where Han steps over Jabba and Greedo shooting first and Han being some kind of virtuous ""paragon"" like Matt Dillon in  Gunsmoke or Return of the Jedi as a whole especially Jabba's fortress with the muppets WAY over done and it was tollerable in 1983 but the 1997 crap is too Disney/Henson!  The thing I hated about ""Return of the Jedi"" the most(which is a good movie without Lucas's insipid changes) is in 2004 Darth Vader's dreaded ""NOOOOOOOOO!"" was dubbed in by Lucas as a sign he hates people over 35 who are his original fans who he would have nothing without!  Even if it is a clearly hated aspect of Darth Vader in Episode III, he went and dubbed it in ""Return of the Jedi"" as a real slap in the face to the true Star Wars veteran fans.  Even though I still love Star Wars-mostly for Empire Strikes Back where Darth Vader comes across as totally ruthless and evil killing off his generals like they were flies, I think there is some insult in the way he modified his second trilogy(as in original) the first trilogy(prequal) is a mix of okay to terrible(mainly Episode I) Episode II isn't too bad if you can tollerate Anakin and Padme being too mechanical in there acting together and Obe Wan trying to be funny and not being so at all in the least sense of the word.  The true performers were that of Christopher Lee(Count Dooku) and Ian McDiarmid(Palpatine/Lord Sideous). My favorite character in all of Star Wars isn't a Jedi at all, it's Han Solo(Harrison Ford) and I will say, he is the best actor in the central character department though in the 4th-6th movies all of them are good, including Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker and Carrie Fisher's Leia.  I can't really complain about the saga but I can't really give it a good thumbs up totally and I reluctantly lower it from 4-3 stars.",1384473600,5,2511,4.467248908296943

7219714,5,B00YI71PN2,"These films look amazing in their much-anticipated BD release.  People giving this box-set poor reviews and detailing every tiny little item they have a problem with miss the point of suspension of disbelief.  Some seem to forget that when someone makes a film, a work of art, a device, tool or basically anything at all, it's their creation and not the viewer's. I'm of the opinion that if you create something like a film, you have every right to make changes to YOUR creation as you see fit.  Whether its to correct an error, take advantage of updated technology to create special effects, change dialogue for clarity, advance the story or just change the tone of a scene then that is YOUR choice and no one else's.  If I made a film that happened to gain popularity, and later made changes that I wanted to make to MY original creation, who is Jon Doe to tell me I ruined it or to tell me that I'm suddenly a horrible film-maker even though 20 years ago I was their favorite film-maker?  I can understand the viewers who prefer the unedited film simply prefer to watch that version, and if they do, they should keep watching that version.  But to dedicate so much time detailing every criticism of the changes that I decided to make would just baffle me.  Okay, so the new versions aren't exactly the same and you dislike some or all of the changes.  Don't watch it or buy it.  It's that simple.

As a collection of science fiction movies these run from the fairly simple (Episode 4) to the amazingly complex (Episode 3).

7219770,4,B00YI71PN2,"Star Wars is a space soap opera about a farm boy (Luke Skywalker) who meets a motley crew of characters (Han Solo, Princess Leia) before battling the evil empire personified (Darth Vader). The Star Wars saga is so iconic the story need not be discussed here.

Admittedly this set (like almost all Star Wars releases) has problems because George Lucas has changed many of the effects and scenes much to the detriment of fans of the original films. The original trilogy is not the original unaltered versions (where Han shot first) yet the transfers do look gorgeous. Even with an astounding 40 hours of extras (8 hours is brand new) I am disappointed we don't get the original theatrical releases that have never been released on BD or DVD. One benefit of the changes is CGI Yoda. There is some new content for BR. One of the new features is the Star Wars Archives (IV-VI) which includes deleted/extended/alternate scenes supplementary interviews with cast and crew and other featurettes. There are 3 bonus discs crammed with extras from SW: The Prequel Trilogy (Episodes I-III) [BD] and SW: The Original Trilogy (Episodes IV-VI) [BD]. However, it does not include all the old content from previous DVD releases such as ""Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy"" and the 3 featurettes: The Legendary Creatures of Star Wars, The Birth of the Lightsaber, The Legacy of Star Wars on that release. So hang onto that old bonus disc with 236 minutes of content.

Special Features:
Star Wars Documentaries: NEW! Star Warriors (2007, Color, Apx. 84 Minutes)
NEW! A Conversation with the Masters: The Empire Strikes Back 30 Years Later (2010, Color, Apx. 25 Minutes)
NEW! Star Wars Spoofs (2011, Color, Apx. 91 Minutes)
The Making of Star Wars (1977, Color, Apx. 49 Minutes)
The Empire Strikes Back: SPFX (1980, Color, Apx. 48 Minutes)
Classic Creatures: Return of the Jedi (1983, Color, Apx. 48 Minutes)
Anatomy of a Dewback (1997, Color, Apx. 26 Minutes)
Star Wars Tech (2007, Color, Apx. 46 Minutes)

Buy this set despite its imperfections. Shop around to get the price and Star Wars release that you want (there are many available). We aren't getting an uncut Star Wars in Lucas's lifetime and this collection has managed to hold its value. This saga comes loaded with special features and the films look and sound great (though the original trilogy gets the old 2004 transfers). Diehard fans may be interested in 1984's The Ewok Adventure and 1985's Ewoks: Battle for Endor. Don't forget about the Star Wars Holiday Special (1978).",1376697600,,2538,4.897674418604651

George Lucas was so far ahead time that it is amazing.

7219789,5,B00YI71PN2,"When this set was first released it was bombarded with negative reviews, many from people who never even watched this set, there main complaint ""the changes"" that George Lucas put in his movies. Most of the reviews that came out did not say anything about the video quality, sound or bonus features just complaints about George Lucas's tinkering of his movies. It also seemed anybody who had anything positive to say were quickly attacked by people for not agreeing with their opinions. One thing I mentioned back then was that I believed that after more and more people bought this set and actually watched it that more positive reviews would come out, and luckily I was right. Now there are more 5 star reviews than 1 star reviews and most negative reviews that come out are based on a missing disc or won't play on their Blu-Ray players.

I have seen EVERY version released on home video from VHS to Laserdisc, DVD and now the Blu-Ray release. The picture has NEVER looked this good before and although I thought they did a great job on the DVD release it just couldn't look as it does now on Blu-Ray. The original movies look like they were shot yesterday and hold up very well next to the prequel movies picture quality. It is truly amazing what they can do with movies as old as the original trilogy to bring it up to today's standards.

The sound is also very good especially if you have a good surround sound system. You can hear ships and sounds from behind you and the Millenium Falcon sounds amazing, the bass makes it sound very powerful. Some people have complained that the sound is not consistent if you watch it without a surround sound system and although I am sorry for that they need to realize that this set was intended for people to run it with surround sound. I have heard these on regular TV speakers too and although it did not bother me I did notice the sound effects, explosions and so on were quite a bit louder than when characters were talking.

The bonus features for this set are very good too, they finally have the deleted scenes available for the first time that fans have been begging for. Although I loved the original DVD Empire of Dreams documentary I do understand why it was not included in this set. One thing I have seen MANY times over the years are customers complain of double dipping, and get angry when the same thing shows up on a newer set that was available on a previous set. They tend to feel cheated for having to pay for the same things twice so I do understand not having it on the Complete Saga. The bonus material is broken up on to 3 discs, the first disc is for the prequel movies, the second is for the original trilogy movies and the last is further documentaries and specials.

I have said before I do understand why people were not happy with the changes in these movies and felt the unaltered versions should have been included, but this is a VERY good set and shows a lot of work went into it and again as stated by myself and many others these are George Lucas's movies, he created the universe, made them as he wanted to and upgraded them to the way he wanted. He did not work within the studios so he could make these movies HIS way and not have the studio system change them. He paid a lot of his own money to keep it that way and dropped out of the director's guild. So yes these movies truly belong to George Lucas, fans did not contribute to the making of these movies in any way, they just bash him and feel he went against them. I am not sucking up to George Lucas (as many people have been accused of). I just understand his right to make his own movies the way he wants them to be.

Now that Disney has the rights to Star Wars I am curious if they will release the original unaltered trilogy and that would be awesome. Already there are a lot of negative things being said about the next movie coming out in 2015, guess we will all have to wait and see. In the meantime we have this Blu-Ray set to watch and enjoy and as I said earlier I am glad more and more people seem to like this set as much as I do.",1375315200,5,4082,4.302990897269181

I also have no problem with any of the Special Edition changes, except for Greedo Shot First. As for the set itself, obviously, the picture and sound are absolutely superb. You are missing out if you watch Star Wars in any other way. The extras are almost worth the money by themselves, this has just about any information on Star Wars you can possibly want; effects documentaries, prop and concept art galleries, one of which actually has the entire animated segment from The Star Wars Holiday Special, there's, of course, also many deleted scenes, and interviews, which are always welcome.

7219800,4,B00YI71PN2,"Star Wars the Complete Saga was a birthday gift and it was amazing! I had had the newer trilogies but only on DVD and never Blu-Ray and I had never had the original trilogy at all. I will split my review into three tiny sections of my thoughts on the Complete Saga.

The Box: The casing that the Blu-Rays are housed in is very strong and durable. The case is decorated with some nice artwork and the Blu-Rays slide out easily. Nothing else to say about that.

The Prequel Trilogy: Remastered into Blu-Ray the video and audio quality is amazing! It is how Star Wars was meant to be viewed and heard. No qualms about these movies.

The Original Trilogy: I understand that George made changes to the original films via CGI, new scenes, etc. Most of the changes I did not mind, however there is one change that really really bothered me. In episode VI when the rebels have finally prevailed a new scene is shown. This scene shows people celebrating all over the empire from various planets of the Star Wars universe. My only problems is it is all CGI and done very poorly. There is even a part where citizens tear down a statue of the Emperor. I could not believe they would add something like this. It was completely unnecessary and took away from the original experience of the film.

Bottom line I love my Blu-Ray saga and would recommend it to anybody.",1374796800,,1352,4.461538461538462
7219801,5,B00YI71PN2,"All the films, all the TV specials, some parodies, behind the scenes goodies, incidental info... it's all here. The picture is clean and the sound is perfect. They've also changed the original animal bellow the precedes the arrival of Ben Kenobi in Ep 4 with something far more ominous instead of the whistle like bird call they used to replace the original growl which was just fine in the first place. The packaging is a little much to futz with. I'm concerned that one of these days I'll accidentally tear one of the pages holding the discs in place.

I'd really like a set of these movies in ""Original Theatrical Release"" format, without any of the 'enhancements' that have been added over the years.

7219849,5,B00YI71PN2,"Even if I don't truly love all 6 films, it's nice to have them all in one set (that takes up less room on the shelf, thus providing more space for more movies).  I call that win-win.  That they're Blu-ray, BONUS!  (Plus, I still have the original 3 on VHS, before they were tampered/fixed.)
As for the individual films, some are obviously better than others.  The Empire Strikes Back is the masterpiece of the set.  Attack of the Clones is the worst of the lot, when little orphan Annie is all grown up and throwing snits every two seconds.  This is what comes from hiring someone for their height rather than any real acting ability.
What I've always appreciated in all 6 films is the dazzling array of pyrotechnics.  They all excel when it comes to battle sequences and the more personal infighting.  It's the exchanges requiring dialog and the most basic aspects of relationships where things tend to go flat.  The personalities of the better actors fill in where character development is almost nonexistent.  Few have any history that bears repeating never mind being mentioned in the first place.  Characters just show up and you either accept them as is (Jar Jar Binks) or you don't.  As far as the FORCE goes, as often as they explain it (always in ambiguous terms), it still remains a mystery.  If they can see the future and have inklings/feelings of bad things about to happen why is it that they can never figure out who the bad guys are?  Even more disconcerting, the dark side of the force is considered anything to do with aggression, fear, anger, and hatred......yet Luke is instructed to kill his father.  How can murder ever be misconstrued as a good thing?  (No one plays Gandhi in this universe.)
My favorites will always be the original three films; at best I will simply tolerate the other three (and won't watch them nearly as much).

Otherwise, I don't suppose there is much else added in this that the DVD collection doesn't already contain.

7219865,5,B00YI71PN2,"The Star Wars saga on blu-ray exceeded all of my expectations that I had going in. The picture quality is amazing and the DTS-HD master audio tracks gave my home theater a real workout with the absolutely incredible sound mix. This Star Wars release like the few recent others that have come before has an altered version of the original movies. George Lucas always wants to update the Star Wars films with new ideas that he has and whenever he does this there is a very loud outcry from Star Wars fans. Although I would have liked to see the unedited versions of the films included, I'm not ever going to complain that they aren't because the Blu-Ray quality here is beyond amazing, and I really don't mind the changes all that much.

A quick rundown of my opinions of the films:

- EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE (5/5)

My favorite of the prequels by far (I know I am in the minority here). To me, this movie has the closest feel to the Original Trilogy that Eps. II and III just don't seem to have. Liam Neeson does a really great job in this movie like he does in all of his other movies, and the rest of the cast is great too. The story is a lot of fun as well but the highlights of this movie though are the pod race and the final lightsaber battle at the end with Darth Maul. Darth Maul left such a great impression on me that I think he might even take the place of Darth Vader as my favorite Star Wars character of all-time.

- EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES (4/5)

My least favorite movie of the entire saga would have to be Episode II. The main problem I have with it is the complete over-use of CGI. Many parts of the movie look pretty fake. The movie itself is also pretty slow as it does have a pretty badly written love story intertwined in the middle of the movie, but I guess it had to be there. It does have some pretty great action sequences though, and veteran actor Christopher Lee is in the movie who is always a great bad guy. And I still like the movie because it is Star Wars.

- EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH (5/5)

This movie is a pretty vast improvement over Episode II. The story here is quite a lot better but it still unfortunately uses a lot of CGI. There is a return of Darth Vader at the end of the movie, but I wish they would have had him in the suit for a longer portion than just the last couple of minutes. I believe Ian McDiarmid really steals the movie though as Palpatine. It really reminded me of Return of the Jedi during some of his scenes.

- EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE (5/5)

Everyone on the planet has probably seen this movie because it is truly an absolute classic. Its possibly the greatest movie of all-time.

- EPISODE V: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (5/5)

And this is possibly the greatest sequel of all-time!

- EPISODE VI: RETURN OF THE JEDI (5/5)

It is really hard to make a trilogy end greatly. Return of the Jedi is the best part 3 of any trilogy I can think of.

If you are on the fence about picking up the Blu-Ray don't be. Its absolutely awesome. The packaging itself is even awesome. It comes in a little book with special art for each movie. Also there are 3 discs of bonus features with tons of deleted scenes that have not been on any release before this! You don't get the bonus features if you buy either of the two separate trilogy three-packs, so buy the complete saga 9 disc set. Its so worth it!",1370131200,3,3365,4.196899224806201
7219866,3,B00YI71PN2,"As far as I'm concerned you didn't come here for reviews on the film as you probably already watched them and just want this for the collector's value. Well as far as I'm concerned it delivers exactly what it promises, the Star Wars saga with the perfect 1080p quality of blu ray. However this version is still contains the altered original trilogy. While I definitely like many of the alterations (they are more like polishes then changes to me) Han still shoots second which has cost this review a star for me (I mean seriously, what the hell?). However they also have a CGI yoda replace the puppet they used in Phantom Menace which is a win for me. Also, this isn't an extended edition and they only have some of the deleted scenes, not all of them. Overall it is lacking in bonus content so there goes another star. So I'd say it is a bare bones Star Wars Saga Blu Ray set and a bit overpriced for being what it is but it does deliver its promise.",1370044800,,951,4.318435754189944

7219878,4,B00YI71PN2,"I held back buying the blu ray for so long but one day I felt far too weak. I sold my Star Wars DVDs and bought the blu ray box set.

I now wish I'd kept the DVDs as well for the special features that featured on those discs are no where to be seen here (I forgot this was a Lucasfilm release and they don't want you having simply one version, they want you to buy twenty).

That said some of the new special features are great. There are no particularly good documentaries but little details and deleted scenes are fascinating.

The films look great (in particular revenge of the sith and the empire strikes back).

I'm not a big fan of the prequels. I do think there are good things in them but they seem like not enough care has been taken in their making but I couldn't just buy the originals because I feel compelled to own them all (all part of George's cunning plan).

I changes to the original trilogy, much like previous changes, add nothing. Vader's added dialog in Jedi is heinous and the ewoks blinking is simply distracting.

The trouble is... I love star wars. I find myself always complaining about the films and Lucas but I am drawn to them like a moth to a flame. I don't feel burnt with this purchase though, as they have made them look fantastic and ultimately that is why I bought it.

If they were to release the films in their original forms on blu ray tomorrow I'd buy it but I am impatient and this'll do in the meantime.",1368057600,3,1445,4.251824817518248

And im sure it won't be the last! First of all, like everyone else i am upset that it is the 1997 versions ond not the original '77- '83. Hopefully Disney will make that happen then we can stop buying Star Wars collections! (yeah right!) The movies look execellent on blu ray, crisper, clearer, colors pop out! The reason i gave it 5 stars is for the bonus discs. Its cool seeing the behind the scenes for Episodes I, II, III, but i was 26 in '99 & a Star Wars geek so thats really nothing new to me, BUT, to see behind the scenes, rough cuts, deleted scenes & interviews for IV, V VI, are just Amazing! Even though some scenes are only 15 seconds,Its so interesting to see what did not  make it to the final cut of the three classic films. And everything that went into making sci-fi films Before CGI!!

Now to me i am a huge fan but please stop after number 6. I really think it is bad they are going to make another movie number 7 come on really what else can they do.
Now that George Lucas sold out to Disney then oh well just another company Disney owns. I like this box set if they kept to the THX Stuff.
Now to me if you look really close at the last movie near the end you will see a new versions of the ghosts and to me that is just wrong

I'm not so happy with the way the BDs are housed in this particular ""book"" format. They tend to slide back into their sleeves, and one is forced to grab the BD on the playing side to extract it from the sleeve, which always leaves a small fingerprint (ie: oil) on the disc itself.

This set is a must have if you are a fan of the saga, I would discourage someone from buying the trilogies separate because you are missing out on 3 discs of bonus features which include deleted scenes from the original and prequel movies, and than you get a last disc of well worth watching documentaries.  If you have the DVD sets of the prequels and the original films HOLD ON TO THEM, many of the special features on the DVD's are not on the blu rays these are mostly new features so I am for sure going to hold on to my DVD's of the films. That all being said I was somewhat disappointed that the theatrical cuts were not included even though the changes don't bother me at all and I feel they were good, I would prefer to have the option of which version of the films I would watch.  In conclusion this should not deter any fan in the least bit from buying this set and enjoying the movies at home in full 1080HD this set is a must buy for any Star Wars fan!",1362787200,6,1180,4.077586206896552

After charging ALOT of moola to upgrade to Blu-ray versions of their movies, you'd think they would at least give us durable cases to protect our investments. Nooooo!! What we get are these stupid bound sleeves that one has to pry the disc from, dirtying the disc itself with fingerprints. They did this with Avatar 3-disc version,the Alien Anthology, and whatever else I didn't buy. I don't see Warner Bros doing this with Harry Potter or the Lord of the Rings sets!! The LOTR box has awesome cases for us. And it's not about being green with these paper holders; after all, some of us are film lovers and collectors and want cases that do what they're supposed to do- protect the disc. Actually it is about being green- how much green the studios can collect while giving us the purchasers the bare minimum!!! And don't get me going on those crappy, flimsy single DVD and Blu-ray cases with all the holes in them. How many of you folks stuck your finger right through the hole AND the insert??!! It's Your Money People! I know some folks treat these items as throwaway consumables; but for the rest of you cineastes- aren't you fed up yet???",1362441600,,1309,4.622317596566524

Sure, consider my opinion bias for being born in '91 and spoiled on CG my whole life but technology has changed the past 30+ years. The original trilogy is still timeless, Jar-Jar is still annoying and shrill, AotC is still terrible, the rock R2 is hiding behind DOES disappear, the Ewoks do have eyelids, Vader's lightsaber is NOT pink, Darth Vader does say ""NOOOOO"" at the end of RotJ, and, yes, Greedo still shots first. But who really cares? The integrity of the movies are still there as well as the magic that keeps me coming back for more! All the bonus material is really cool as well.

7219971,5,B00YI71PN2,"The first collection of the six episodes of the ever popular Star Wars Saga is worth every ounce of praise it has received. Mr. George Lucas and his team of professionals deserve kudos for their significant contribution to world culture.

It seems as though Mr. Lucas is working towards the creation of a body of work that will stand the test of time like Dante's Inferno, Chaucer's Tales or Shakespeare's plays. If that is indeed the case, most of the people who will experience these movies will do so after they have been completed and all of us have come and gone our way. They will have the opportunity to experience the six episodes as one continuous, chronological adventure that acts as a parable for the importance of freedom, the need for constant vigilance in its defence, the evils of war, the destructive excess of greed, and the value friendship.

As the collection continues to mature in the years to come, it will be interesting to see what changes continue to me made to bring a greater sense of cohesion to the Saga, inclusive of the incorporation of the newly announced episodes.",1361750400,,1098,4.713541666666667

7219974,5,B00YI71PN2,"I'm generally pretty easy on things, and I will be on review of this product.  If George Lucas feels compelled to keep working ""his masterpiece"", then so be it.  We have no control over it.  I think George would serve himself well by leaving well enough alone, and concentration on ensuring the masters are transferred over at as high a quality as possible.  He doesn't need to re-work content.  It's my sense, the general public is fully happy to see these flicks again as they originally saw them in the theater, and enjoy them for what they are - and that would be as a ""really incredible story"" that for some has changed people's lives.

Having seen all the originals in the theater when they were originally released, I will say this.  I ordered this package of movies and started showing these to my children last night.  I was VERY confused when I put the first disk in only to discover it was ""The Phantom Menace"", and that the original, first movie had mysteriously been re-named, ""A New Hope"".  That really threw me.  And so as TPM ran on my Oppo Blu-Ray player, I decided to let it run for the kids for a while, since this really was ""the real beginning of the story"".  But what I quickly realized was, they really needed to see ""A New Hope"" first if they ever expected to really understand what was going on, and what ""The Force"" was all about.  So I really think Mr. Lucas has done a disservice here by specifying the disks be put in this ""chronological"" order.  If you really are new to Star Wars, you should actually start with Disk IV, then watch V and VI, then go back to I, II, and III.  So it seems some confusion has been created here.  There's no way you can really understand everything that's going on in Disk ""I"" until you've seen Disk ""IV"".

So I complain.  I'm not a Star Wars Fanboy, so I can't get too wrapped up in the other small changes Lucas has made that really amount to nothing more than nuances in the story.  I'm more interested in the grand sweep of the entire series, and would suggest that Star Wars is Star Wars, and still the grand epoch that it always was, only with better video quality and better sound.  Enjoy the movie.  It's great in its orginal or altered form because it's just a spectacular story and spectactular movie, and no minor changes Lucas makes can really ruin it.",1361491200,2,2324,4.398126463700234

I ordered this as a gift for someone out of state, it came with a disc missing and a duplicate disc in it's place. The person received this as a gift and is a collector. To try to get this replaced...even just one disc...has been a nightmare. Because I bought the gift Amazon will only generate a return label to my address which is 3 hours away from this gift, they will not send a return label to the person who received it. Not sure why as the label is needed to get the gift back to Amazon for a replacement. So now I have to get the label to print, if my printer will work, mail it out of state where he will box it up and take it to wherever they can find a UPS drop off and then WAIT for a new item to be sent to replace it. Amazon never used to make this so difficult. I priced this item at Best Buy at the time I was gong to buy it, next time I will choose Best Buy, returns are much easier and my son could have taken it to the one near him and walked out with another one.

As far as the changes are concerned, the only one that truly annoyed me was the addition of the young Aniken at the end of the Return of the Jedi.

7220001,5,B00YI71PN2,"The original theatrical editions of the classic Star Wars trilogy, particularly Episode IV-A New Hope, while they contain many amazing moments, do have their warts, that AREN'T THAT GREAT.  I can see why, and am glad, that George Lucas changed some shots.  I like some of the changes Lucas made.  I don't like others.  But, overall, I feel Mr. Lucas has impeccable taste, the tweaks are justified, and the stories and rich entertainment value of this galactic space epic are intact, which is what's important.

Obviously, too many of you rabid, fanatical purists are holding on too tightly (rumble and creaking sound of clutched gloved-hand Vader stranglehold tightening around your own necks) to the original theatrical cuts of Star Wars IV-VI as one of your most cherished childhood memories (they were an important part of my childhood too).  The painful fact is:  YOU have changed.  YOU are no longer children.  You've lost that tender, innocent, idealistic core of youth, where the universe is all open and new, and have become jaded, nit-picking adult cynics.  It happens.  Get used to it.  Deal with it.

Some of you are truly an ungrateful, spoiled, ""glass is half-empty"" bunch of brats, who are too busy nit-picking what you feel are ""faults"" in these latest versions of the films, instead of enjoying the rich entertainment legacy that is right in front of you!  If YOU have the talent, which I doubt, make your own films.  YOU then will explore this creative process.  YOU then will be in control.  YOU then can make exactly the films YOU want to see.

Meanwhile, you should be THANKING Mr. Lucas for offering his groundbreaking, legendary Star Wars saga AT ALL on blu-ray, especially in the stellar high-def transfers that he has offered!  These look and sound gorgeous.  These are the finest transfers, especially of Episode IV-A New Hope, that I've ever seen outside a cinema, and I saw New Hope, in particular, in A LOT of cinemas as a kid.

Yes, it would be nice to own the classic, unaltered versions of Star Wars Episodes IV-VI on blu-ray in superb HD transfers from pristine film prints, IN ADDITION to these ""tweaked"" versions, just to see the evolution of ideas in Mr. Lucas' mind, to compare today's visual-effects technology with the more ""quaint"" visual-effects technology of the time they were made, as well as to enjoy the tighter, faster, more kinetic ride of the original theatrical versions (the original theatrical versions are shorter).

With the recent acquisition of Star Wars by Disney, we may just get our wish!  There may just be pristine prints of Episodes IV-VI somewhere, begging for Disney to archive and do a proper HD transfer and blu-ray release of.  If that happens, I will proudly add the original cuts to these cuts.  If that happens, hopefully that will finally put an end to this incessant bitching, by some of you, for the original versions.  You will then have to find something new to bitch about.

Meanwhile, try to relax, calm the clutter of your minds, hear the Meticlurians of the Force speaking to you, and, with time and training, Ani, you too will get back to that tender core of youth, that is still inside you.  It's called suspension of disbelief.

+++++

The special features are pretty comprehensive!  We get a tour inside Skywalker Ranch, interviews with all the artists involved in the making of these films, documentaries, spoofs, 2 commentary tracks, as well as a ""descriptive audio track"", per film, and many, many other goodies.

I really enjoyed watching the vintage documentaries, particularly SP-FX:  The Empire Strikes Back, a treatise on the evolution of special visual-FX in cinema, which Star Wars is certainly an important part of.  I also enjoyed watching the various Star Wars spoofs, spin-offs and references!  Obviously, Mr. Lucas isn't too precious with his creation; he doesn't mind having others poke a little fun at it (as long as they pay licensing fees to Lucasfilm, of course).

One spoof that was ommitted, or perhaps wasn't available, and would've been nice to have, was Ernie Facilius' Hardware Wars, which the youngster helmed right after the original Star Wars was made in 1977.  Hardware Wars shows ordinary household appliances, like irons and toasters, zapping lasers at each other in space.  Thankfully, a few shots of this ""opus"" CAN be seen in SP-FX:  The Empire Strikes Back!

Also (scratching head) curiously omitted from the extras on this blu-ray set, and that would've been nice to have, is the excellent Empire of Dreams documentary, produced and directed by Kevin Burns, found on disc 4 of the Star Wars original Episodes IV-VI trilogy DVD set released in 2004.  It chronicles the dismal state the world was in BEFORE the original Star Wars was released in 1977, how Hollywood movies were equally grim, and the rags-to-riches story of George Lucas and his struggle to get the original Star Wars on the screen, as well as his struggle to make the successful sequels, or, rather, parts of its continuing story.

Also (scratching head) curiously missing from this blu-ray set are all the wonderful web documentaries, found on the previous DVDs of Episodes I-III, the prequels, chronicling each and every aspect of the making of these films.  These short web documentaries were originally shown online, on Lucasfilm's website, as the prequels were in the process of being made, to generate excitement for their upcoming release.  I and other tech-heads and artists found these quite fascinating.  If you've already purchased the Star Wars movies on DVD, hold onto those DVD sets, as they are the only way to see and enjoy these great special features!

Meanwhile, these are a generous offering, and a powerful ride.  Fire up the HDTV and surround sound system, with subwoofer, and enjoy those massive, rumbling Star Destroyers!",1359590400,6,5829,4.955715756951596

the blurays have a beautiful quality about them the only thing i wish is that they were the original trilogy and not the altered ones that lucas made that take away from the classics

The sound presented in DTS-HD MA is breathtaking; one of the best audio presentations in Blu Ray ever. Episodes 4 and 5 were near perfect I didn't need to adjust my volume settings at all even during Yoda's scenes. Episode 6 was not as perfect as I noted that I had to raise the volume in certain dialog scenes but it redeems itself in the death star 2 explosion scene where you can hear the Millenial Falcon screaming towards you then the explosion of the death star 2 in the rear that then blasts itself forward.

Now onto the movies themselves, episodes 1,2,3 are better than I recall from my initial viewing and watching them in sequence made me more involved in the story so  the flaws didn't distract as much as previously. Episodes 4,5,6 were incredibly enjoyable and converted my wife to a Star Wars fan. I had watched episode 4 on the big screen 35 yrs ago but episodes 5 and 6 were viewed on a 22 inch screen via VHS so this was a huge step up for me as I'd never re-watched any of them. Despite that I did notice some of the added scenes and other changes the fan boys rant about but I don't think it's worth subtracting one star from the review let alone 4.

My recommendation to the fan boys is don't sell yourself short by missing out on this incredible blu ray presentation. At worst, insert the disc in the player, close your eyes to avoid Lucas' edits and treat yourself to the most enveloping audio experience on this side of the galaxy.

Note: I watched this on my hometheater PC with Radeon 6570 video card, DTS-HD MA bitstreaming to Onkyo receiver to 7.1 surround speakers, 55 in Panasonic Plasma.",1357344000,2,1927,4.374301675977653

I would however take a little caution if you are a someone who prefers the unaltered versions of the original trilogy (Episodes 4-6) and that's ok too since we all have opinions on Lucas's alterations. This set does have the altered scenes like Greedo shoots first instead of Han, Hayden Christensen's ghost appears at the end of episode 6, The emperor's appearance is different to look how he appeared in episode 3,and the sarlacc pit's mouth is different and etc. But if you are not a purist and just looking to sit back and enjoy a day off or a weekend watching these classics, then you'll find this box set a perfect way just to do that.",1357171200,2,766,4.439716312056738

7220073,1,B00YI71PN2,"Dear George,

I am not happy with you. Yes, I admit it. I am angry.

Call me a ""fanboy"" or whatever. Dismiss my opinion however you wish. Say the movies belong to you and you can do whatever you want with them, as you are so fond of repeating. And yes, legions of pro-Lucasites will come to your defense. Or make fun of me and people like me. But they are wrong. You are wrong.

I loved the original trilogy. They were a great part of my childhood. And I still enjoy them as an adult - except for where you have meddled with them. Why, George, why?

Why did you add a bunch of cartoony, distracting CGI junk into the background of the Mos Eisley spaceport?

Why did you change Han's character by trying to make his shooting in the cantina more ""obviously"" self-defense? We already knew it was self-defense! It looks stupid.

Why did you make it so Luke no longer says, ""You're lucky you don't taste so good.""?

Why did you change the music in several parts of the movie, especially at the end of Jedi?

Why did you make Vader say, ""NOOOooooo!""?

Blinking Ewoks? Who gives a ____?

Why did you take out the perfectly acceptable - and fitting - ghost of Sebastian Shaw at the end of Jedi, and put in a totally-out-of-place Hayden Christensen?

Why do you keep making these distracting and pointless changes, while ignoring the things that actually NEED to be fixed? Such as Vader's PINK lightsaber, and Luke's Green-no-it's-Blue-no-it's-White-no-it's-Green-again lightsaber in Star Wars?

I know I'm beating a dead horse here. You're rich. You're successful. You're not going to read this. You don't care. Well, you know what? I think you're arrogant.

Just give us the original CLEANED UP, WIDESCREEN versions on Blu-Ray, and people like me will go away! But no. We're stuck with you and your lousy ""better"" versions of these movies. Until you're gone, at least... Not that I'm mean enough to hope for that. It's just disappointing that your pride has brought us to this.

That's what it's all about. That's why we're stuck with these. You're certainly not above milking another blu-ray release. But you don't want to give us what we want because it doesn't conform to your pure ""vision"" of what Star Wars ought to be. Well, that's a load of horse hockey George!

You're so full of yourself, you know that? You've surrounded yourself with nothing but ""yes-men"". I would not like having to work for you. On the extra scenes, it is so obvious that everyone around you is afraid of you... Agreeing with everything you say, laughing at your lame jokes... Do you like it that way, George? Is that what being a successful filmmaker is all about?

I remember when the prequels were announced. I was so excited! But my excitement turned sour very quickly... Again, why George? Why?

Why did you create Jar Jar Binks? To be funny? My kids don't think he's funny. So who does? You?

Why did you make a prequel story that doesn't even try to conform at all to the continuity of the original movies? ""When I first met your father, he was already one of the best starpilots in the galaxy"", Obi Wan said. (Or something like that.) Since when does a kid driving pod racers count as being a star pilot? And Obi said he chose to take on Anakin as an apprentice. But in the Phantom Menace, he didn't choose at all. He did it out of obligation to Qui-Gon.

""He was a good friend"", said Obi in Star Wars. But in the prequel movies, Anakin and Obi don't act like they are friends at all. Obi spends his entire time griping about Anakin, and vice versa. You don't ever feel that there's any deep connection between them at all.

Why did you make it so that Jedi have to leave their parents and be monks? So to be a Jedi, you can't be married? Huh? And for that matter, why can't Senators be married? Whatever.

Why did you demean Yoda's character by having him pull out a lightsaber and start hopping around like a little green frog on steroids? This had to be one of the dumbest moments in Star Wars history.

Midichlorians? What?

Why did you put such an emphasis on the lightsaber? ""This is your LIFE,"" said young Obi. Oh really? I thought a Jedi's power flowed from the force. Guess I was wrong all along.

Why did you insist on killing off any halfway interesting villain before they ever get a chance to do anything? Darth Maul? Jango Fett? General Grevious? All dead. But yeah, let keep the stupid villains like Nute Gunray, the trade Federation guy around. People are REALLY interested in him!

Why did you keep using CGI to pack distracting cartoony stuff into every frame of every action scene? Why insist on using all green screen at all? It just looks unreal. And cold.

Most importantly, why did you make an entire prequel story that is completely uncompelling and makes no sense whatsoever?

At least we have the Disney movies to look forward to. Star Wars can't get any worse than it is right now.

George, it's not too late to change. I love you. I love the first movies you made. I love the universe you created. And although the prequels can't be undone, we can put that behind us. George, I'm willing to forget about the past. All I'm asking you to do is make amends. That means please give us the cleaned-up Blu-rays of the originals. Is that really too much to ask? I'll pay you a lot for it, George. I'll even stop saying what a bad guy you are.

Consider - you don't have to sacrifice your vision to please me. Rather than hate your new versions, I will watch them with interest to see what you've added. I'm willing to take that step in our relationship. But I can't do it until you meet me halfway.

If you do, our future will be bright, George. Someday, you might even find it in your heart to release the Star Wars Holiday Special. Until then, I remain...

7220123,5,B00YI71PN2,The movies are incredible the transfer to blu ray was superb. I only wish Lucas hadn't changed the movies they are minor changes but still it was a bad decision.,1355356800,3,161,4.4
7220124,5,B00YI71PN2,"I have watch the first 3 dosens of times while I grew up, on blue-ray 1080p led is like watching it for the first time.  This is one of my best purcheses ever",1355356800,4,158,3.787878787878788
7220125,4,B00YI71PN2,"I was always a Star Wars fan... Since I can remember, I even wanted to be a Jedi knight.... To use a light saber.... To control the force.... But then I grew up and found out those things only happen in movies.... Too bad!
I had the 2004 DVD edition of the Star Wars saga and as soon as the blu-ray version came out I wanted to buy it. I finally did. My opinion:

The video:
Amazing 1080p full HD video... The colors are just right! The video plays smooth even during the fastest action scenes... This is the best picture ever (I just didn't see the 4k displays yet)... I could notice no movie grain, even while watching the first 3 movies.... The whole saga was remastered to achieve the most out of blu-ray format. Speaking of video quality, it's way better than the DVD edition I had. I rate it 5 out of 5 stars.

The sound:
Definitely the best audio ever.... The surround effects are just amazing! One can hear all the things happening around theirselves.... The sound really provides a really immersive experience while watching the movies. The acclaimed soundtrack feels even better... The scores really build up the mood for the different scenes of all 6 movies. It's a unique experience.

The packaging:
This edition really have a wonderful packaging. The discs are stored inside a book, with really thick pages, all filled with pictures related to each film. The art itself is really well-made. Is was delighted when I first opened the box and saw the care taken to design and print this set. The overall presentation is really good.
Despite all the compliments made to the art, I just didn't like the way the discs are stored. There's no way to take a disc out of the ""book"" without risking to touch the data surface of the discs. This is a minor problem, since Blu-ray Discs have a scratch protection coating, but I just didn't like it at all. I really take good care of my movies and I just hate when you can see a fingerprint on the discs. Because of that, I rate it 4 out of 5 stars.

The story:
Lucas did a great job writing the Star Wars saga.... The story is really interesting, he can keep your curiosity and attention during almost all of the movies.... I just couldn't avoid falling asleep during the Attack of the Clones romantic scenes.... I just think these scenes were too long for the style of the series. There could be some romance on the series, but not that much.... As of the other films, I just love them. Even though I love the original trilogy, I just couldn't notice that the light saber fights got really improved in the newer movies. A sure 5 out of 5 star rating.

The changes made:
I think I didn't notice all the changes made since the DVD version of these movies. I just think that the CG Yoda is way better than the old puppet one....as this is a matter of opinion, I won't discuss it here.... There are fans who hated the changes and fans that think they came for the better..... I would rate them 5 out of 5, but that's just my personal opinion.

Overall:
I just love these films.... I would totally rate them 4 out of 5....
If you're a fan, you should buy this set.... If you're not a fan, but you like starship movies, give this a try... You won't regret it....
Lets see what Disney will do with the saga.... Lets hope the 7th installment is as good as the first 6..... Two bad these are not 3D movies.... But I don't really think I'll buy the digitally 3d-fied movies... I only like native 3D movies....",1355356800,4,3449,4.38125

7220134,5,B00YI71PN2,I bought this for my hubby for Christmas and he loved it. Although they made some of those stupid little changes that everyone complained about he still was really happy with the set!!!,1355011200,2,185,4.636363636363637
7220135,5,B00YI71PN2,"I was one of those Star Wars fans who was reluctant to buy the Blu-Ray set.. Well, even though it's missing ""Empire of Dreams"" and all the previously released material aside from it, including deleted scenes from previous releases, the six films have never looked or sounded better! I have no regrets.

EDIT (12/10/12): After realizing just how many one star reviews this has, by lunatics who have no lives aside from crying over the fact George Lucas likes to (in his mind) ""perfect"" his movies, I've decided to add on to my review.

Content:
I'm not sure if you've all heard about some of these legendary deleted scenes, but they're amazing. Some of them really make you wonder what could have been.. Extra passing mentions to Luke's father in A New Hope, Luke and his friends at Tosche Station, Luke building the lightsaber he used in Jedi, all kinds of great scenes that could have been, and, some that should have been. The deleted scenes add about half a star, if not a full star, to the value of this release.

More great content comes in the form of vintage making-of documentaries that most fans have never seen before. They're a fun watch for anybody who wants to get the feel of what it was like to be around as the films were being released.

Also included are a section for each planet in each film called ""The Collection"", featuring a number of models and clothing pieces, as well as matte painting, often along with revealing and very interesting video commentaries from people like Joe Johnston and Steve Gawley and Doug Chiang.

The bonus content does a lot for the value of the set, and I'd say it alone is worth at least a star and a half.

Picture and Sound:
There's really nothing that needs to be said here. HD sound and picture were long overdue, and here they are. Another half star, all 6 films look far better than they used to.

The Movies:
Okay, there have been changes, so what? It's the same Star Wars, the story and theme have never changed, it's not life-altering. Take a half star off if you must. The movies themselves, not including the optional negative half star, are at least 3 stars.

There you have it, a set worth no less than 4.5 stars.

Honestly, people are too fanatical about the changes thay have been made. Yeah, a lot of times they're unnecessary, or just plain bad, but the movies themselves still have the same effect on us and our kids, and nobody loves Star Wars any less, even if they hate Lucas. This set IS worth it if you love Star Wars, and don't let anybody tell you different.",1355011200,7,2535,4.493478260869566

7220142,1,B00YI71PN2,"Many of the reviews talk about the ""No, Nooo"" dialog inserted in Jedi but are missing the insult in Empire.  In the original version of Empire, after Luke jumps and falls through the chute in Bespin, there's a scene which shows Vader briskly walking and in a pissed off, gravely voice says ""Bring my shuttle"".

In the new version, the voice in the same tone as Jedi, says ""tell my star destroyer to prepare for my arrival"".  The very next scene shows what is supposed to be the shuttle landing in the star destroyer.  It's not, it's the opening scene in Jedi of the shuttle landing in the Death Star2!!  I mean come on king George.  If you're going to tinker with your toys at least try not to insult our intelligence.

I would like to know why in the original version of Jedi, R2's beeps changed from the first two films and Vader's voice became more digitized.  Why not keep it fluid?  For me, the origianl Empire is the best with A New Hope coming in at a very close second.",1354492800,12,977,4.324175824175824

7220155,5,B00YI71PN2,"Movies are always up to one's personal taste and opinions.  Having said that, I (and anyone who has watched them with me) completely enjoyed all of these movies.  I have had at least 3 marathons with various friends watching these, and I never get bored of seeing any of them again.  I usually see a movie only once, and that's enough, but not with these.

Seeing them in chronological storyline order all in the same day brought all the different elements together, and the whole story made more sense.  Every time I have a marathon, I pick up on something new that I did not realize before.  I might have a Star Wars party someday and have my friends dressed as characters come over for lunch, dinner, and drinks, and watch the movies!  There is at least a total of 12 hours of viewing pleasure, so if you plan a marathon too, keep this in mind!

Also, I like the small additions to the original movies with new scenes that relate back to the prequels; it helps bring the total storyline together.  For example, at the end of ""Return of the Jedi,"" new scenes from other cities in the universe are added that include celebrations of the victory over the Empire.  In addition, with these movies in Blu-ray, the picture is very clean, crisp and lifelike.

7220167,5,B00YI71PN2,"Wow, I just can't believe all the negative/hateful reviews for this amazing set based on a few gripes. Welcome to SW fandom!!

The set is incredible. I'd have liked some different extras in a few cases but you don't buy a movie for the extras. Everything looks great and the movies are all amazing.

My take on the series:

The Phantom Menace: A brilliant film on many levels but it is an acquired taste. However, it has been unfairly maligned and has become a convenient whipping-boy for angry ""fans"". The film is visually extraordinary, rich with ideas, fun to watch and kids love it.

Attack of the Clones: Another film that has become a convenient excuse for internet geeks to complain and hurl insults. The love story is weak but the film as whole is strong. It advances the story of the first trilogy well, is quite complex, and every frame is a pleasure to look at. Again, brilliant on many levels.

Revenge of the Sith: As good as any of the originals. Truly epic.

A New Hope: In my opinion the best of the series. Just a perfect movie that works on every level. It still looks beautiful.

Empire Strikes Back: Everyone's favorite but not mine. There is no plot, very little story, it's always cutting away from the interesting material to focus on Han & Leia, bland characters who remain static from beginning to end. Disappointing visuals  - not the photography or special effects, just the way Kershner shot it, like television. And all that dry ice - it's like the freakin' Ice Capades! Endless fog & smoke machines & dry ice. Pretty dull. But still, an entertaining SW movie with lots of great moments.

Return of the Jedi: Really perfect. I prefer Richard Marquand to Irvin Kershner as a director. The world he creates is visually stylish, intriguing, mysterious, colorful and fun. You want to revisit it over and again.

There you go. The best series of fantasy films ever produced. Don't listen to the negativity and endless complaining of career ""fans"". It's a great set and six great movies.

PS: If you're thinking of leaving some kind of insulting comment, don't waste my time or yours. Just post your own review. Thanks.",1349136000,8,2142,4.670212765957447

What I mean literally is that I felt watching the older style late-70's films was that you could see how ""hollywood set"" the movies are. Plastic, simple, blocky props, etc. They just felt fake in a lot of scenes, which stinks because I am so into BluRay and HD and was excited to finally have all 6 episodes in the HD box set.

I know not everyone may agree with me on this but I actually prefer watching 4, 5, & 6 in Non-high definition format.

7220182,4,B00YI71PN2,"Ok, I am not one of those Star Wars fan that is going to give this set 1 star because it doesnt contain the original versions. (Sure I wish it did, but oh well). Next, Im not going to give it 1 star because Lucas changed a few more things for this release. I am going to review the movies for what they are.

Lets start with the original trilogy. In my opinion, Episode 4 A new hope has the most improvement from the dvd transfer a few years ago. Dont get me wrong, all 3 are improved, but A New Hope shows it a little more. As far as Empire Strikes back, I personally didn't like the use of DNR on it. It is distracting. I would have rather had the film grain look. I know why they did it(Keep everything looking consistant throughout)..But it just doesnt work well. Good thing is that is usually doesnt last to long in the places its applied. Next up is Jedi..Its the worst of the 3 in terms of improvement over its previous dvd. Better yes, but not up to HD standards of today.

Now I have to say this. The sound on these is the most amazing thing I have ever heard. Its PERFECT. ITs AMAZING...this release is worth the upgrade to blu just for the sound.. No Joke!

As far as Episodes 1-3, Revenge of the Sith looks absolutely incredible. This is what I wish all 6 films looked like. Its stunning...Episode 1 is the least improvement, although the CG Yoda is for sure a plus! As to Episode 2, its not near Episode 3, but it is improved. I did notice some DNR apllied, but its not too bad. Again, the sound on all 3 of these movies is PERFECT. Worth the rebuy just for the sound.

As to the package and artwork. I like the case and the cardboard book. Its very sturdy.

Now on to the bonus features. I really didn't care for the deleted scenes. I can see why Lucas never released these before. They are not important at all to the movies and the quality stinks.

The only really thing worth watching is Disc 3 of the bonus features. It contains all the great documentaries and spoofs. I must watch for sure!

So there ya go, this set offers improved video quality over the previous dvd releases and provides one with PERFECT sound.

What are you waiting for, if your a Star Wars fan, go buy it, originals or not!!!!!",1344297600,8,2218,4.20235294117647

7220187,2,B00YI71PN2,"I bought these when they first came out - then sold them! Aside from the scene changes and whole rearrangement of the films, the Blu-Ray quality was not up to par for me!  I did not expect them to be consistent given then different times and mediums used, but I expected each on to look it's best on Blu-Ray!  I think what Lucas attempted to do was to make them all look the same presentation wise.  This was a mistake as it took away from each film the look that they had individually.  I also did not like the fact that The Phantom Menace was softened to make it look digital.  Yeah, it was always the nosiest of the films, but it lacked detail and that film-like look that it had.

Now I can say that I did not mind the special editions in the 90's as the original films were getting dated and were no longer looking state of the art.  Blame Terminator 2 for that one!  I understood why Lucas has to make those more up to date, but when you tinker with things once and like it, then you tinker with more stuff and then it becomes something else.  People may not like people who complain about the changes made to the films, but these were not the film we saw in the theaters in the 70's, 80's, 90's or 2000's!  These were films that none of us saw making their debut on Blu-Ray! We did not ask for this but this is what was given to us.  DO I want to see the originals unedited and uncut on BD only?  Probably not because they will look like 70's and early 80's films now, but I would not mind it if it were in a box set.

On a side note, the prequels were not bad, but aside from some lag in the love story and the kind of terrestrial look of Attack of the Clones, I think the main thing that makes the prequels hard to digest is ONE PRIMARY thing that I have not heard anyone touch one - everyone does a flip before they begin to fight with light-sabers!  These things alone make the films looks silly.  In none of the originals did anyone do a flip right before the fight.  Those looked more realistic and they looked more like a fight for their lives.  In the prequels it looked more like a show thing for a young audience and another thing that Lucas thought would be ""cool.""  I swear, aside from Jar-Jar, if they took those initial flips out of the light-saber battles, the films quality from that alone would increase.  Also, Obi Wan getting smacked around by a 2 ton steel cyborg and not having his head come off was not good either.  They should have made it so that he avoided getting hit since he knew it would kill him.  Aside from the fact that he was not unconscious (compared to being slammed against a railing by Dooku AND keeping his legs!), he did not bleed or have broken bones.  You know he should have died after one blow however!

CHange these things I pointed out, add the originals in a deluxe box set, improve the picture quality and they may have a good one.",1343865600,6,2887,4.171480144404332
7220188,4,B00YI71PN2,"First off, I want to try to give as much of an objective review of this Blu-ray collection featuring all six Star Wars movies.  Then afterwards I will give my own opinion.

All 6 Star Wars films (and 3 bonus discs) are included in this set.  As far as picture quality is concerned, it is probably the best I have seen on a disc format so far.  Each film looks great (with a few scenes here and there that appear to have needed a little more work).  The sound quality seems fine, although I do not have a surround sound set up so it is not fair for me to judge that.  The first two bonus discs have approximately 5 hours of materials respectively. (Bonus Disc 1 is for the Prequel Trilogy and Bonus Disc 2 is for the Original Trilogy). The third disc is a collection of extra documentaries and spoofs.  The bonus material does not include all of the previous material that was on the DVD versions.

Now I will give my opinion.  After having watched every film, extra feature and everything else in this collection I have to honestly say that many people are being far too critical of this set.  I know many of you don't like the prequel trilogy or the fact that George Lucas has altered the Original Trilogy, but GET OVER IT!!!  The fact is when the original movies were released they did not have CGI technology, otherwise Lucas would have used it to put in more Banthas, Dewbacks or whatever else he wanted.  I personally like all the CGI updates myself.  I don't know why people are always bashing it.  What would probably be a bigger crime to me (and this has happened as of late with many other films) is the fact that many movies are being remade without good reason other than to collect more money (i.e. The Day the Earth Stood Still and Flight of the Phoenix to name a few).

I digress.  As for the Prequel Trilogy I loved Revenge of the Sith.  As far as the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones are concerned I agree that they could have been different.  However they are what they are.  I would hope that when leaving reviews for a product, that people would describe the product itself rather than just crying about how George Lucas owes them after having spent most of his life working on six blockbuster movies that have brought many hours of entertainment and cultural influences to the world.  They ARE just movies!  I love Star Wars myself, but at the end of the day they are just movies and I'm not going to spend all of my time (with the exception of this review) obsessed with what Lucas has or has not done with these films.

For those of you eager to get the original theatrical formats, I'm sure they will be released at some point.  Until then, I will actually recommend this collection to any one who can try to keep an open mind and just remember that it is all fun and games and to NOT take these movies too seriously.  I apologize if I have angered anyone, but I am just being honest.

May the Force be with you all!",1343779200,7,2946,4.3224043715847
7220189,4,B00YI71PN2,"Really great movies. I have always liked the Star Wars Series. One DVD didn't work and Amazon replaced the package immediately.  I'm sure you will be please with it if you purchase the Complete Saga.

7220190,5,B00YI71PN2,"No, you don't get the theatrical versions in this set. What you DO get is the absolute best looking releases of these films yet! The transfers look great, and many (not all) of the problems in the DVD release have been corrected. The changes to the films are sometimes quite bad (Obi-Wan's ""roar"" just drives me nuts), but honestly, it's a few seconds out of 12 hours.

Plus, how can all these people give one star to the set that finally brings us so many deleted scenes from the original saga? That alone is worth the purchase for lifelong fans like myself.

And while they're obviously not best of the saga, episodes 2 and 3 look truly stunning. Episode 3 in particular is probably the best looking blu-ray I've ever seen.",1343606400,6,725,4.526717557251908

7220192,1,B00YI71PN2,"Why must Lucas do this to his most loyal fans. How can you change the movies we've loved so much. If you're a fan of the old trilogy I wouldn't recommend getting this. Yes the blu ray version is crisp but there are so many changes that Its completely noticable and It really ruins the movies. I was left several times rewinding parts and saying ""what the hell"". I could list them but theres quite a bit (like Obi Wan letting out a wierd computer generated yelp at the sand people). This was a huge dissapointment and a slap in the face to all the fans of the original series.---Unfortunatly I have no solution to you If you want the original series on a blu ray quality setting. There was a fan site offering it for free (fans went and made the original series in HD)but alas that site is no longer but maybe if you search long enough you might be able to find it.

7220193,2,B00YI71PN2,"Sadly as much as it is nice to have the films in HD, the new movies do NOT hold up (obviously as films, but also many of the VFX throughout the films sometimes look TERRIBLE, just my op)

Either way, I will NOT support Lucas until the day he releases the UNTOUCHED un EDITED original cuts of the original films.",1342656000,11,311,4.183333333333334
7220194,4,B00YI71PN2,"First of all, let me say that I have purchased the Standard Editions, the Deluxe Editions and the DVD two pack with both the original and the modified editions in them. I've pretty much bought every version that Lucas has released and I will continue to do so because I am such a big fan of Star Wars. I usually prefer having every version so when the time comes I can watch it however I want. Second, I'm not a big fan of directors changing the movies after we've seen them a hundred times and loved them every time.

The Box Set
- While it was a great idea to convert these movies to Blu Ray because they do in fact need to be there given the video and sound quality those disks give off, the box set feels a little complete as other reviewers have mentioned. I would have liked to have seen some new content added in and all the versions of the movies would have been a great edition. The box set itself is really cool looking and I do like what they did with the artwork on the packaging as the box looks great. The disks are each placed in their own section with artwork from that film which is pretty cool.

Special Features
- There definitely could have been some more added in but overall there are still some great features in there. The Star Wars Spoofs which have some great spoofs from TV shows over the years were a great laugh. Additionally the interviews and making of documentaries are always a good watch. The feature on Star Wars Tech and its plausibility is also one of my favorite things as well.

The Movies
- They look and sound absolutely stunning. The Blu Ray format was perfectly made for these movies as they have never looked or sounded better on my surround sound system. I'm glad I purchased them because I really do notice the difference in quality and cannot say enough about how good these movies look and sound.

The Content
- Never should have been added in. The scene that irks me the most is in Return and I cannot stand that he added in content. It truly takes a lot away from that scene and seems very out of place. I think that is the one scene that sticks out in my mind as an overall loss to the film. The second worst would be the sound change in Obi Wan's voice in A New Hope when he scares the Sand People. Though I will say it did make me and my friends burst into laughter the first time we saw it so if they were looking to inject some comedy into the film they may have just done so. Some of the other changes were minor things that did not bug me very much but if you are a fan of the originals and do not like changes made then this box set may not be for you. However, if you can get past these changes and accept that the movies are still great and the story is amazing then go ahead and grab it.

Recommendations
- I would definitely buy it again. Despite the changes I still love the films and as I said earlier I will probably buy every version that they come out with. That being said the movies have been changed and a couple of the changes do change the tone of parts of the films. Anyone who cannot stand seeing these movies changed in any way will probably be disappointed and should stay away. Anyone else who wanted more special features may be disappointed as well as there were definitely some lacking. I think for those of you that want the original versions and do not want these versions you should wait until a more comprehensive pack comes out with all the different versions in Blu Ray format. If that day ever comes I will be the first one in line. But for now this set definitely does make a great substitute.",1342569600,8,3581,4.214285714285714

That being said, it's not fair to compare them with Star Trek, especially since there have been no live-action Star Wars tv shows, except the one they're still trying to get off the ground. However, Star Wars did a better job than Star Trek in terms of films and telling a dramatic story in those films. The Trek movies are more action-oriented, which is to be expected for any science fiction show translated into film. I used to read the Star Wars novels that took place after episode VI, I always though that they would make episodes VII, VIII, and IX with the cast of the original trilogy, but I guess it was not to be. I first saw the Special Edition in theaters with my childhood friend 15 years ago, and episode III came out when I was in college, so these movies bring back fond memories of those days.",1341532800,8,903,4.445783132530121

The picture may be better but the cut scenes that weren't in the movies and were instead put on a different disc is total bs to me and waste of money when a lot, or most of us thought that the cut scenes would be put into the movies like they should've been, but we get ripped off again, and makeing me angry isn't a good thing.

7220208,5,B00YI71PN2,"After reading so many negative reviews about this product I had become skeptical. I bought it expecting the worst. I was very pleased. This is completely worth it, unless your one of those whiny hardcore original trilogy fans who can't handle the minor changes. Star Wars is a great story that has 3 generations of fans. (The Original Trilogy, The Prequel Trilogy, and the Clone Wars)

Picture and Audio was near perfect, especially in 2 & 3 which were shot in HD.The changes are minor except for the ""NOOOOOOOOOO"" which is kinda annoying. The only other change I do not like is the change Call that Obi-Wan does. Aside from that and the first 2 bonus discs being kinda skimpy, it is a excellent collection. As for the people who have given it bad reviews bc of the changes, if you don't like te changes then don't buy the product. If you like the originals then keep the originals. The best change to the films is the new CG Yoda in Episode 1.

I LOVE this collection as I am a huge fan of film and love te story of Star Wars. This collection appeals more to a newer generation of fans as ell as the older that are not cry babies.",1340150400,10,1131,4.330188679245283

7220226,4,B00YI71PN2,"I was once one of those kids who lived and breathed Star Wars.  I read the books and Star Wars Insider, collected the awesome toys (especially the action fleet sets), played the video games and played Decipher's CCG (oh, the memories!), and of course I watched the movies.  My brothers and I studied the Star Wars encyclopedia and essential guides, and spent most of our outside time having lightsaber fights.  This is just a glimpse of our severe nerdom...and the reason why we never had any friends until high school :)

Although the THX VHS tapes were most commonly in circulation during my childhood, I really grew up with the Special Edition versions, and these were what I knew best.  As a result, I was used to the changes: expanded CGI sets were the norm, I liked the new Sarlacc and the Death Star explosion rings, and I never even knew that ""Han shot first"" was a debate.  When I saw the 2004 DVDs, I was mesmerized by how fresh the movies looked.  Many of the scenes were tremendously cleaned up (Jundland Waste at sunset), but most fans focus on the negative changes.  The new Anakin at the end of RotJ was a bit shocking, but I actually didn't care, just like Vader's ""nooo"" at the end of the Blu-ray release didn't bother me.

So why am I not the same fanboy I used to be?  Why did I never become a so-called purist?  Did I just give up on caring for a beloved part of my childhood?  Why will the Blu-ray release be the version that I show my son when he is a little older?

I grew up, got married, had a kid, etc.  I am an adult!  People, all the magic and wonder is still in Star Wars, despite the differences.  There are much bigger things to worry about (in life) than R2-D2 hiding behind disappearing rocks, blinking ewoks, a re-vamped Max Rebo Band, and perhaps the worst love story of all time in AotC.  The movies are fun, but they are not life.  If you want the originals, buy a VHS or laser disc player and then buy older editions of the movies.  The Blu-rays looks great, and that is the primary reason to buy Blu-rays, right?  Over half the reviews are one star - one star!  Sure, I would like Lucas to release the originals on Blu-ray, but come on Star Wars fans, and get a life!",1338336000,5,2206,4.305825242718447

7220228,4,B00YI71PN2,"First and foremost, I really have to second Sloopydrew's review ""The Fanboy Test vs. The Girlfriend Test"".  It would be hard to write a much better review.  This DVD set is not perfect by any means, but the video and sound quality of the movies is amazing.  I never imagined the films looking this good.  I own a sound-bar, and the sound on that is amazing.  I can only imagine what it would be like on a high end digital surround system.  There are also a plethora of extras ranging from the 1970s to the present day.

I decided to buy these because I really was sick of getting out my VHS player every time I wanted to watch the original trilogy.  Although these discs do not contain the theatrical releases of Episodes 4-6, it is possible to look past the tinkering for the convenience.  If you are a Star Wars original trilogy purist, this set is not for you.

The package pulls out and pages through like a little book, with one disc per ""page"". The one thing I don't like about this product in particular is that the pockets the discs slip into can be kind of hard to get the disc out of. You may need a thumbnail.

I am just now starting to watch all these on blu ray and got through the first two but than noticed that the disc menu for three was actually The Phantom Menace. After further inspection it appeared to be that they gave me two copies of Phanton and didn't include Revenge of the Sith.

7220232,2,B00YI71PN2,"From the day I got my Blu ray player, this was the set I was most anxious to have, however because it's kind of pricey, I didn't get it for several months. Now that I have it, I feel like I shouldn't have bothered. There are serious problems with these disks. Audio drop outs, in some places it happens every 10 or 15 seconds. The sound just goes away for a while. You have to pause the movie and wait for it to ""catch up"" and then start playing it again. This happens with the movies and also with the commentary tracks. None of my other blu ray disks has this problem. In looking online, I see that I'm also not the only person having this issue. There are several solutions I've seen posted, but none of them worked.
  As for bonus features, apart from the unlistenable commentary tracks, they have also decided, for reasons that I can't understand, to not include any of the excellent making of documentaries that were included with the DVDs, and frankly, when it comes to the prequels, the making of films were the only thing worth watching from the DVDs. Instead, there is a selection of old made for TV documentaries made when the original trilogy was released. They are grainy as hell and look like they were taped from someone's VHS copy using a video camera pointed at a TV. There are a few features showing shots of some of the models and matte paintings used, which are nice, though some have short videos to talk about them and some don't. And unless I'm missing it, not one of them is about the Millenium Falcon? We get the hand puppet of the slug, but not the millenium falcon??
  The one and only redeeming feature is a long collection of spoofs. Everything from home made youtube videos, to robot chicken and Spaceballs. Just clips, of course, but still, a great set of really funny videos. Frankly, I would have scrapped everything else and been willing to buy a single disc of just the parodies.
  If you already have the DVDs, don't bother. If you don't, then buy the DVDs and save some money. Easily the worst Blu ray discs I have. I also have the Lord of the Rings extended DVDs, and I was expecting these to be at least up to the amazing standard that that set managed to achieve. These are not even in the ballpark...",1337817600,8,2241,4.400966183574879
7220233,4,B00YI71PN2,"Cons:

Well..it is true that Lucas did change and add some Scenes..The only Major difference in this Box set is Obiwan's dragon scare which he does to scare the Tuskin Raiders away .IMO at first it sounded like a Drunk old man is running at you while stepping on broken glass.  That was a WTF moment for me, but after watching it a few times though its just funny..(So basically no big deal)....

 Now for the Scene in ROTJ when Vader has to make his decision to save Luke or kill the Emperor, Lucas added that NOOOOOOO!!!! while Vader is thinking. IMO that was completely unnecessary because even though you cant see his face physically that doesn't necessarily mean you cant  see the Emotion in him. In the original you see him looking at both of them while music is playing and the camera zooming in on him which was enough to know that he is going to do the right thing..

Pros:
  The puppet Yoda in the Episode 1 is changed to the new digital Yoda which is episode 3 quality one. (Way  Better)
In Episode 5 when Luke gets attacked by the Wampa you can see the Actors arm, so that was fixed also.

But other than the boring stuff I just said.. the Box set is worth it, Picture quality is very good, Sound is even better (10/10 with surround sound :D)

One more thing: This set also comes with 40 Hours of extra footage so if your hardcore this is the thing to buy..And the case looks amazing with all the artwork and everything is held together nicely.",1337731200,8,1456,4.3161764705882355

7220237,5,B00YI71PN2,"At 40 years old I've known these stories virtually my entire life, ever since my Dad took me to Ep. 4 in '77.  And yes, I've heard every single opinion out there...but the truth is, the bigger something becomes, the more debated it gets.  And nothing's ever been bigger than Star Wars.  Personally, I think the naysayers often take more time to rip these films apart than those of us who love them take to defend them.  Because, honestly, what's there to defend?  It's the greatest sci-fi adventure/saga/movie serial of all time.  Period.  And for those who reply that the new ones don't live up to the originals...let me say this:  nostalgia's great and all, but I was around when the old ones came out; I read the comics, had the posters, ate the C-3PO cereal, and debated with my friends endlessly over every little nugget of those classic films...and the simple fact is: we WOULD HAVE LOVED THE PREQUELS back then. We would have LOVED THE CLONE WARS animated series back then.  Instead, we got the 'Holiday Special'.  In the late 70's and early 80's we had Star Wars comics with a green talking rabbit hanging out with Han Solo, and yeah, we loved him too.  We loved anything that was Star Wars.  And Ep. 1-3 are far beyond anything we ever discussed or imagined.  I never wanted to see anyone else's vision of Star Wars but George Lucas', and after all these decades, to finally get to see the entire Star Wars saga in AMAZING HI DEF with surround sound makes this entire box set the culmination of every single childhood fantasy my friends and I ever had.  This series is incredible.  Do I prefer some episodes to others?  Honestly, no, not really; it depends on what kind of movie I'm in the mood for.  They're all tonally quite different, but cut from the same cloth.  In fact, maybe that's exactly why I love this more than all other movies.  Upon buying this, I showed the entire series 1-6 to my girlfriend for the first time, and her two favorites were Ep. 3 & Ep. 6...and ya know what, I think the ten year old version of me would have agreed.  Today, I'd pick Ep. 3 & Ep. 5...but I might feel differently tomorrow.  I guess that's the point.  A great series now with an amazing blu ray edition.  I'm happy.",1336694400,7,2220,4.45409429280397

I never saw these films in a theater, only at home on sdvd & using an old tv & htib at that, so to upgrade to a great home theater was awe inspiring in its visual presentation & sound. The epic battles & explosions could be felt in the seat of my pants. Saw things in more glorious color & detail than I ever did before, so I'm totally impressed with the blu ray release at least for ep I-III; saw ep IV on blu ray & altho it is a bit more clear/detailed, was nothing much of an improvement either sight or sound imho, so I'll give the whole double trilogy 4 stars mainly because the later episodes are so much better in transferance to blu ray than the early ones & they only rate 2 stars.

While the prequels aren't as good, they still are entertaining and provide a nice back story. And while many of the blu ray changes to the original are unnecessary,they don't ruin the film and leave me in an outrage. So some important changes:
The new digital yoda looks....good. Not great or amazing. Its better then the puppet but my main problem is that the voice frank oz does is different in 1 then it is in two or three. So when the character has the same look but a different style of speaking its a little distracting for me.

The new obi-wan scream.....is unbelievable. It really is awful and quite possibly the worst change. I cant describe it.

R2D2 hides behind rocks...they look pretty real. and when I look back on the original he does seem very out in the open and not hidden.

Greedo shooting first....is a lot cleaner and smoother then the shoulder jump in the 2nd and 3rd revision.

Lukes lightsaber training.... looks the same to me. Maybe I need my hdmi to see the actual blue saber but I saw no difference and I was a little dissapointed.

jaba's giant door.... seem unnecessary. But it makes the scene when c-3po knocks on it a lot funnier honestly.

The blinking ewok eyes.... are soooooooo dumb. It wouldn't bother me too much if they looked better. But they are finely detailed and if the ewok moves his head too much the eyes seem to bob. Scenes with multiple ewoks are almost hypnotizing. I hate the ewoks anyway so it does justify my hate a little more when I watch it.

Darth vader's no.... isn't that bad. When I heard about it I was devastated but when I watched it i was fine. It has kind of a cool effect and it does kinda make sense that he would vocalized killing the mofo who ruined his life. Wouldnt you?

All in all this is a very good box set. The Bonus material is solid and satisfying. The packaging alone is worth the money. It's not as bad as some make it out to be, I have every version and I accept them all. Honestly the originals look so bad they are easier to laugh at then the new releases. If your a hater, then don't watch them and blog about it. If you love star wars and are curious to see whats changed now, get this set",1335139200,11,2518,4.319915254237288
7220254,4,B00YI71PN2,"To begin with, the complete saga remastered in full HD is a great adquisition. For even hardcore fans like, me it is a lil' disappointing to see no original trilogy without any changes, any way, the changes made to the films make it really good. For example, the animated  Yoda for episode 1 is just fantastic. So if you don't mind watching a modern anakin skywalker at the end of episode VI, this might be for you. Finally, if you like watching documentaries and behind-the-secnes stuff, this saga collection is right for you.",1334793600,6,527,4.666666666666667

7220256,2,B00YI71PN2,"I had been waiting for about five years for Star Wars to be released on Blu Ray, ever since I bought a PS3 and Hi Def 1080 P TV. Unlike older generations of SW fans, I came of age during the 1997 re-re-releases of the original trilogy and the prequels. Comparing the oriignals to the special editions, I prefer, the special editions, but I still very much think, Lucas should have included the original trilogy in this set. Many other movie directors have done this and have done it well. That being said, as an author, who is re-writing the first five books in a series of novels I started writing when I was in middle school, I can understand George's desire to make changes. I can also understand George's feeling that the newly edited versions of the orignal films are superior to their orignal 1977, 1980, 1983 releases. I feel that the re-written upcoming releases of my first five novels are superior to the orignal versions. Still, given how much love fans have for the orignal trilogy, I feel that Lucas needs to throw his fans a bone and include the original releases of Episodes IV- VI. I am one of the few people that feel that Darth Vader's screaming ""No"" as Palpatine tries to kill his son Luke is apprpriate for the anguish Vader feels at the prospect of losing the only person alive who beleives in him.
The part of the blu-ray set that upsets me the most is the fact that none of the special features from the orignal release of the prequels is included, so there are no bonus features for Episodes I-III. Not only that, but the special features that are on the three discs are inferior to the bonus material that was included on the first DVD release of Episodes IV-VI
Still, it is fun to see all of the star wars movie in one set

7220262,3,B00YI71PN2,"So, everything has been said so I just wanted to say that mr Lucas indeed knows how to keep bleeding money out of the franchise.

7220263,4,B00YI71PN2,"Ok, so the sound on the movies seems slightly muted from the DVD's, but I can mostly get over that. They don't sound as loud or as full as on DVD. I can deal with it. Hence the 4 star review. I LOVE the 3 bonus discs and added commentary on each movie.  I can handle the minute tweaking of each movie for blu ray. The Obi/Anakin fight in Sith looks right now as opposed to when it was released. For all the haters out there, if you think George is doing this for the $$$$, DON'T BUY THE SET AND SHUT YOUR FACES OFF!!!! The main reason I spent the money on this was for discs 7,8, and 9. I own Eps 1-3 on DVD; bought them when they were released. Bought the DVDs for the original ""special editions"" when they were released. Bought the re-release of the original trilogy with the theatrical versions when that came out. And yes, bought this. I am soooo over it. These are awesome movies and an awesome series. It's an awesome movie when you view it as it was supposed to be, as 1 movie spread over 6 parts. For me, my favorite ""bonus"" was the documentary on the 501st Legion. Second would be the archive stuff for the original trilogy (I am actually watching that as I type this). There was never a doubt I would pick this up.  Don't hate on George for releasing this. Hate on the technology that forced him to have to release it in this version. And yes, I will buy it again if it gets realeased in a different disc type format for whatever comes after blu ray.  This is cinematic gold.",1333497600,6,1485,4.167247386759582
7220264,5,B00YI71PN2,"I was a little hesitant about this set considering all that I heard about the new additions.

I first saw the original SW in 1977 when I was six years old and it most certainly had an impact. The original trilogy is near and dear to my heart for all those boring and lonely days of my youth where I would either read the Marvel comic, scour Starlog magazine for any tidbit, or thankfully and finally watch the film first on HBO, then CBS for its premiere, then at last on VHS.

Time, maturity, and the discovery of girls led me to my own adventures, but I always came back to Star Wars on a rainy and dull day to enjoy the fantasy, sound, and visuals of this truley wonderful series of films. I ultimately find myself working in the industry today because of it.

The Special Edition brought SW back to theaters in '97 and they were a joy to behold, with a few special surprises! Though I would much rather have the song Lapti Nek back in Jedi, it really doesn't matter.  1999 finally brought us new SW movies and despite my frustration with various attributes of the Prequel trilogy, I find them to be visually stunning and very entertaining.

My adoration hit a snag with the DVD release and the replacement of the actor who briefly portrayed Anakin's ghost at the end of Jedi with Hayden.  I understand why Lucas made this revision but I found it jarring. So upon hearing of the blu ray with even more revisions I did not set out to buy them and would just settle with the DVDs of the original theatrical releases.

Christmas 2011 comes and goes, lo and behold the lovely girlfriend has purchased this set as a gift for me. Well, it's not very often I get a Star Wars item as a gift anymore so I felt like a kid and was very happy to have it. Since then I've been slowly making my way through the set and it is well worth the time, warts and all.

Look, I can empathize with the original trilogy purists, and the prequel haters. There are, without question, revisions that are maddening,  Jar Jar antics that make me cringe, and alien cow surfing that just makes my head explode. But at the end of watching each of the films I found myself humming the theme music and feeling a little bit happier. None of the prequel, or revisions was remotely enough to tarnish the fun of watching these movies. And on my 55 inch display through the 5.1 surround sound, they look and sound incredible. What a joy! Especially hearing my adorable 5 year old niece laughing at Jar Jar Binks.

I highly recommended this set for anyone who wants to check out of the real world for a few hours and be amazed at the top quality, family friendly, special effects extravaganza of the Star Wars saga.

Thank you George. Please make more!",1333411200,7,2715,4.367063492063492

7220267,1,B00YI71PN2,"Other reviewers have written about this very passionately so I will keep this short.
Star Wars belongs to all of us - not only George Lucas.  Without the fans of the original trilogy, he would never have had the income to build the effects houses that granted him the possibilities to toy with them.  So by dismissing the original films,  he is dismissing the people who brought him his fortune - his fans.  I went to see the original films many many times in the theater and later my VHS tapes worn thin - that's not something he can ever take away from me.  He does, however, have the power to restore those original films to a modern technical standard.  The fact that he can't do this for us (and there are a LOT of us), is beyond me.

The worst thing about these 'updates' are that many of his changes are just bad and gratuitous.  A lot of the effects work feels choppy, and stand out in contrast to the original effect work.  And most egregiously - it interferes with the narrative.

Spielberg admitted he regretted revising ET with CGI, because he felt like he was toying with people's childhood memories.  He promptly made the original version available on all formats.  Steven.. Sit down with your dear friend George and talk some sense into him, will ya?  The original Star Wars, as clunky as outmoded as it might be to him - evokes a lost, childlike feeling in millions of people.",1333238400,18,1392,4.476190476190476
7220268,3,B00YI71PN2,"First of all let me say that I am one of those few people that have actualy liked most of the changes George Lucas has made over the years to the Star Wars saga. With only one exception. He replaced the crappy Ewok ""Wub-Wub"" song with an even crappier musical jazz/broadway number in the middle of Jabba's palace in ""Return of the Jedi."" With that said I love the new blue ray releases of the Star Wars saga. It is nice to know that George fixed the scene at the end of New Hope where Luke jumps out of his x-wing and addresses Leia as ""Carrie,"" the actress' name. Now Luke properly addresses her as Leia.

My only problem is the cardboard casing that these movies come in. I find it difficult removing the the discs with out scuffing them. This is not something to hand over to kids if you want to preserve your discs. You would think for $90 bucks george would have given us plastic cases. Now I've got to buy a new cd container. Bad George, bad George.

With that said, I have to hand it to a guy who has made a fortune selling us the same movie over and over again. First VHS, then the digitally remastered vhs, then the 20th anniversary edition on dvd, then the 2007 release on dvd. Now the Blu-ray. A month after blu-ray, Star Wars 3D in theatres. way to go George, you make your money. You players out there need to stop hatin! lol.",1332979200,5,1339,4.2265625

I had to turn up my sound system to the same sound level as when I watch DVDs.  The picture quality was no different from the DVD version either.  I seems like Lucas just took the DVD versions and copied them onto Blu-ray.  I am very disappointed in this ""Blu-ray"" set.  The only reason that I am giving these movies a 3 star rating is because it is Star Wars, but as far as an improvement over DVD, Lucas has jipped us.",1332892800,5,575,4.327102803738318
7220270,4,B00YI71PN2,"Before I begin my review I would like to make one thing clear: I don't like Blu Ray. As far as I'm concerned, movies are not real life and the closer they get to looking like real life the more the magic slips away. That being said, I know 99.9% of Americans disagree with this opinion so I am going to write my review from the perspective of someone who would want the highest definition possible.

This is without a doubt the most comprehensive and complete release that Star Wars has ever gotten. Obviously, EVERYTHING isn't included (It would be hard to include a piece of Darth Vader's lightsaber in every package ) but it is a fantastic placeholder for whatever movie-viewing platform comes along next decade. You could spend literally days going through all the goodies are included on just one bonus disc, which include but are not limited to deleted scenes, concept art, high-definition turnarounds of actual movie props, documentaries on those props, featurettes on nearly every aspect of shooting the films, and more. In other words: There isn't a collection in the world that has so much Star Wars goodness.

Then there are the films themselves. The picture is so clear that you could conceivably be looking through a crystal-clear window into another universe, and the sound is crisper than you've ever heard it before. Of course, there are changes, but is an extra ""No"" in Return of the Jedi really going to ruin the entire Saga for you? Sure, it's annoying and should be edited out in all future releases, but it's a small blemish on an otherwise awe-inspiring presentation of a classic Saga. Besides, the other improvements are just that: Improvements. For example, the horrible Yoda puppet in The Phantom Menace has been removed and replaced with a CGI character that has 110% more emotion and feeling than the pupet ever did.

Then there is the presentation. Each film has a gourgeous menu with scenes from the movie floating across the screen and an iconic musical score playing in the background. The discs themselves come in a cardboard booklet that allows you to store what otherwise would be an ungainly pile of discs with all your other Star Wars media. Each page of the ""book"" has gourgeous artwork that captures the essence of the movie you are about to watch.

Overall, my advice is to purchase this set. Even though it isn't the final, perfect Star Wars release, it is extremely good and will most likely be the best format for watching these films that we will have for a long time. Whether you are a die-hard fan of the franchise, an all-around movie buff looking for the best presentation of classic films or a regular Joe looking to experience a piece of cultural nostalgia, this set is a must-buy.",1332633600,5,2730,4.741052631578947

I am a Star Wars fan & collector for over 31 years-started collecting August of 1980.  Took Empire to do that.

Ok, we get all six films wide screen.  BORING DISCS, NO ARTWORK ON THEM.

Three discs are extras.  Two of these discs are extras for the six films.  We veteran Star Wars fans know there are still missing deleted scenes-need bloopers.  Commentary for the films.
The third disc of extras has different documentaries & specials.  THE ONE I AM DISAPPOINTED IN IS THE SPOOFS SECTION.  Ok, Saturday Night Live-hey people isn't the best the episode where Carrie hosted?  It is NOT here.  I never watched the Friends TV show but is there NOT an episode where Aniston has the metal bikini?  Where is the Big Bang Theory?  Family Guy-so many to choose form & they only did a few bits from different episode.  Where was the one with Mark?

And, of course where is the Star Wars Holiday Special?

Brochure inside set is LACKING  I expected information on the films-nope nothing.  And that 2 page art work at the back of the package.  The main characters from episodes 4, 5 & 6  OR THE CHARACTERS WE LOVE Han, Leia, Luke in my opinion are barely shown in top right corner.  SHOULD BE RIGHT IN FRONT WITH VADER, YODA, CHEWBACCA & THE DROIDS RIGHT?

We can just sit here & await the next time George does a blu ray release & see if improvements are made.

First: Blu-Ray resolution -Perfect. The digital demons at ILM brought out the best possible picture. It's clear and perfect. The menus are good looking and the pop-ups are nice as well.

Second: Sound -Perfect. ILM is good at what they do. I am not a big fan of 6.1 surround I think 5 channels are plenty, but the mix is excellent.

Third: Packaging -Beautiful. The movies come in a box/book with each disc inserted into a hardcover book page with illustrations.

-Fourth: Extra features -Average. All or most of the extra features are the same from the DVD. Thus a 4 star review. The commentary can be accessed from the pop up menu.

The bottom line is there is not that much different than the DVD's if you are a snob for resolution and sound, then get the Blu-ray. It's worth the purchase price. If you don't care about picture and sound, the unconverted DVD should work just fine.",1330560000,2,1068,4.484536082474227

However quibblers complain (sad really, such pettiness and disrespect to the director), the bottom line is that the Blu-ray version of the Star Wars saga looks and sounds incredible.

Of course there are some soft shots and minor flaws to overlook; to be expected given episodes 4 - 6 age. But it is clear that considerable care was taken to make this a collection worth buying one more time. The edits made, though minor, are altogether an improvement.

To me, the ""bonus features"" are merely a reminder of the incredible efforts that went into producing this cultural treasure.

The only thing that bothered me a little was Vader yelling no at the end.  I can understand that maybe Lucas thought it would add to the feeling, but yes I do think that a silent Vader was a better Vader.  If you still love these movies you'll get them on blu-ray.  The picture and color is just fantastic if you have an LED tv.  I watch mine all the time.  DVD and VHS players are prehistoric now so you might as well upgrade.  You'll still love them.  I promise.

7220306,5,B00YI71PN2,"There is a problem in star wars fandom (or hardcore fandom in most cases) basically called ""prequel/lucas haters"" or ""fanboys"" it feeds itself by perpetuating the elitist idea that basically half of the whole thing that these so-called fans claim to like is bad and should be boycotted and constantly attacked. It is made up of a lot less actual fans than they would like to have you believe and it has become something of a forced meme in the star wars fan community. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THESE INDIVIDUALS IF YOU ARE AT ALL NEW TO STAR WARS!

They spend ridiculous amounts of time and energy creating all out manifestos to defend their tired argument that (basically) every star wars film besides the very first two made is somehow/someway bad and wrong and unholy. This small amount of hard core fans is primarily made up of Gen X'ers who have a sad sense of ownership over what they call ""their movies"" and pretentious college age hipsters/self proclaimed film experts who enjoy the thrill of being a part of something (in this case an anti-star wars complex) and getting to feel smart around other people by ""letting them in on the secret"" that anyone who enjoys star wars as a saga is foolish and somehow ""buying into"" some kind of money scheme by the creator George Lucas who in reality is a hippy philanthropist who has donated more than half his money to charity, education and liberal causes while putting the other half of his money back into the film industry by creating many innovations and trends which go on to be used by almost every other filmmaker in hollywood.

These fanboys (or whatever you wish to call them) have been so obsessive and persistent since around 1999 that a lot of reviewers and bloggers for certain websites have fed into it in order to gain hits for their websites and blow up their comment sections. Since the Saga as a whole has been released on blu-ray this trend has finally started to die down because of the fact that the Saga box set sold incredibly well (over one million copy's the first week not counting x-mas sales) despite boycott attempts by the fanboys which were embarrassingly proven by this fact to be in the extreme minority.

These people (and the Trolls who help them) will use a large (and tellingly always different) variety of arguments and basically propaganda to get you to join in with them. They look at people just like you who are new to star wars as practice for them to hone their skills in converting people almost like some kind of cult or gang rather. DO NOT TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY!
The intended way to watch the Star Wars Saga is in numerical order, 1-2-3-4-5-6.

You will find that star wars is a visually and artistically beautiful and cleverly crafted fantasy series. Something that is as timeless and family friendly as The Wizard of Oz. But if you buy into the foolish prequel hate all you will be is another angry, elitist fanboy with a pretentious vendetta. I know this may all sound silly and believe me it is but I am dead serious when I tell you that you have been warned.",1329004800,10,3053,4.565693430656935
7220307,5,B00YI71PN2,"The fanbase might currently be mired in heated discussions and pointed criticisms about who shot first or about Anakin Skywalker's thoughts on sand and its irritative qualities, but these frivolous complaints will be less than footnotes in the grand scheme of things. Future generations, which will far outnumber us in time, will not be reacting with shock and vitriol to something new and different in the Star Wars universe; they will simply be enjoying (or not enjoying) Star Wars in its entirety, for what it is and what it will always be.

It is a unique and highly inventive spectacle the likes of which has never been seen before, and probably won't be seen again, not in this way. Each Episode is its own universe with its own atmosphere and its own beats that, when portioned into two trilogies, create two singular arcs that function beautifully on their own but when combined into a six-part saga tells a breathtaking, epic, and almost musical and melodic tale of adventure, action, heartbreak, mystery, romance, fear, anger, joy, betrayal, deception, and beauty. This saga truly is a sight to behold visually, aurally, emotionally.

That wonder looks and sounds spectacular on Blu-ray. I'm seeing and hearing details I've never noticed before, which is what one wants from a high-def release. The special features are a decently sizable affair, although I do lament the relative lack of lengthier documentaries that go deeper into specific portions of the films and their production, or their impact in general. We do get interesting info and somewhat short clips on a vast multitude of subjects (art, costumes, models, puppets, miniatures), a few interviews, two commentaries for each film, overviews of each part of each movie, an hour-and-a-half of spoofs and parodies, etc. This all amounts to over 40 hours of special features, so don't think you'll be getting shafted there, but I would have liked deeper docs to go along with it all, aside from just Star Warriors (which was wonderful).

Star Wars, like all myths, is timeless, and long after the cries and outrages of modern fandom are gone, generations upon generations will be experiencing and enjoying these films for what they are, never giving a care that Darth Vader didn't originally say ""No!"" at the end of Return of the Jedi or that Yoda was originally a puppet in The Phantom Menace -- they'll be too swept up in the adventure, the drama, the legend that is Star Wars to make those details anything but trivia night fodder, and if these movies look and sound so amazing now on Blu-Ray, I can only imagine and drool over the outstanding quality with which those future generations will be witnessing this spectacle!",1329004800,7,2694,4.942604856512141

7220313,3,B00YI71PN2,"I have strong recollections of the release of (what was then) the first Star Wars movie, back in the '70's. As a wee lad, the build up was almost unbearable and the film itself was an eye-popping revelation. There had been almost nothing like it;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2001-A-Space-Odyssey/dp/B0013K1190/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2001 - A Space Odyssey</a>, I suppose, supplied a similar sensory overload but somehow it didn't have *quite* the impact that SW did. For some reason though, I never saw any of the sequels/prequels and I don't believe I even saw ""A New Hope"" much more than a couple of times since its debut. I feel that I can come to the series, therefore, with rather fresher eyes than many of the other reviewers and, I'm afraid, it turns out to be a bit of a disappointment.

To get a couple of things straight; I enjoy sci-fi films, action films and all that good stuff - so there's no reason why I shouldn't like SW. Secondly, I have little or no interest in the audio or visual quality of the film or the quality of the Blu Ray transfer or any technical hocus pocus such as that. I expect a product of this price to be of reasonable quality and, as far as I can tell it is (I note with some annoyance that the audio drops out on a New Hope if you select subtitles and then stop and resume playback).

The good points? These are six absolutely sumptuous looking films. Say what you like, but watching them is the visual equivalent of a Pan-Galactic Gargleblaster. The look of the Star Wars universe is gorgeously realised and very busily populated - talk about a cast of millions! The environment is rich, exciting and great fun. If Lucas took the opportunity to pep up the earlier films with the benefit of the latest CGI technology? Well, more power to his elbow - he certainly committed worse crimes.

And so to those crimes. The acting sucks. It sucks big time and all the way through. Mark Hamill can't act for toffees and should have been strangled at birth. I laughed out loud when, on discovering that his aunt and uncle had been murdered, he did a classic Joey Tribbiani ""smell the fart"" look. Hayden Christensen is deeply annoying and deserves a good spanking. I can't understand why he or Lucas thought that a sulky little b! tch of a teenager would be a reasonable precursor to the most feared and hated force for evil in the universe. Ewen McGregor seemed to think that impersonating Alec Guinness was a acceptable substitute for acting and the best I can say about Harrison Ford is ""he got better"". Carrie Fisher is fine - I could watch her all day (admttedly not just for her acting). Natalie Portman looked, early in Phantom Menace as if she would be the only reason to keep watching, as the enigmatic, strange and aloof Queen of Naboo. Sadly, it eventually becomes clear that her only task in three films is to give Anakin something ELSE to sulk about and then give birth to Luke and Leia. As a result she just gets boring and ordinary and I couldn't help but think of her as an opportunity lost.

Then there's Jar Jar Binks.

I'm sorry if you've heard this one before, but there's no getting away from the fact that, unless you're about 5 years old, the entire Phantom Menace is virtually unwatchable thanks to Jar Jar. I had heard that there was an ""issue"" with this character but I had no idea. No really, none. I suppose that this is no different than the Ewoks who are almost as hateful (I was rooting for the Empire by the time I'd got to RotJ) and just as obviously playing to the cuddly toy and school lunchbox franchise, but at least they don't infect the whole of RotJ.

Plot holes there are plenty of (I'm doing my Yoda impression, here). As if Lucas spent all of his energy on the visuals and a scriptwriter (and acting coach) he could not afford it is (/Yoda).  Overall, it's a fine enough bit of popular/populist story telling - as simple and naive as any Western, war movie or love story.  It's supported by the ground breaking visuals and is quite adequate to keep any 12 year old happy/entertained/excited/engaged. But you could fly an Imperial Galactic Starcruiser through the plot holes. By themselves these inconsistencies would be tolerable in the light of the spectacle of it all, but if you add in the acting (and Jar Jar-isms) the whole six-film series turns out to be a bit of a let down. No - a mystery - I cannot understand why the films attract such a devoted following. If you want an epic scifi series with a broad, majestic vision, try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lexx/dp/B001DF681G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lexx</a>. OK it's tacky, silly and cheap as chips but it has a sense of humour that the Star Wars series lacks and if you compare their respective budgets, I can assure you which one delivers value for money.

I give this two stars and one more for old time's sake, but if, like me, you're an adult and are coming to this with little in the way of Star Wars experience, you could well be disappointed.

It's a great set. At first the extras seem few. But, there is a lot of small interviews and overviews, concept art and back story of each movie on the first bonus disc. The two best parts of the bonus discs are on bonus disc two. ""Star Warriors"" and ""A Conversation With The Masters"". Star Warriors is all about the ""501st"", cool stuff. Plus, the extras include three classic documentries of Ep. IV, V, and VI. There's also spoofs, Star Wars Tech and much more.

7220318,4,B00YI71PN2,"I wanted to base this review purely off what you get in this boxed set. To start I am in my forties and have been a fan of the franchise since the beginning, I am not a purist snob, but I do have an affection for these films beyond the celluloid they are printed on.

First, the box. I have no idea why companies keep making non-standard boxes. They think I want a collector's item, but what I really want is something that looks uniform with the rest of my collection. The inside box is tight and it is hard to get in and out of - plus the ""sleeves"" make it impossible to remove discs without getting fingerprints on them.

Second the artwork on the box is all original and new for this release. One question... why? With so much vintage art available from the archives - why on earth commission new pieces? Lucas seems to think the fans want ""new"" stuff, but the reality is - we want the old stuff! In addition this ""new"" artwork - is horrible. Some of it looks like it was done by High School students for a county faire.

Third - bonus disks. Even though there is enough material in the archives to make a boxed set for each movie (like Lord of the Rings did) Lucas has put the special features for 3 films together on one disk. Each movie is broken down into ""planets"" but the features are not always directly related to the planets - it's all very haphazard.

A typical special feature disk would include interviews with the costume designers, set designers, script writers, location scouts, the director and actors. Surprisingly, those features are sparse to non-existent. The vast majority of interviews and features are about the model builders and special effects team members. For episodes 4-6 the features are almost 90% the same 4 model builders. Again, with so many vintage interviews and archives - why give us new material?

The third special feature disk are Star Wars vignettes not even put together by Lucas - most of these are independent or have been on television already. From all of my past Star Wars discs, I have a slew of shows that COULD have been included - but were not - not to mention the hard to find Holiday Episode.

The movies themselves are gorgeous! I have a high def player, showing 1080p and I have no idea why so many reviewers say that these prints look bad. Admittedly there are some scenes which look darker than others, and there are fractions of moments that look grainy, but I have several copies of these films (including the lazer disk burns) and these are by and far the best.

As a star wars fan, I own them, I have to. Do I wish they were better? Of course, but perhaps as a fan boy, nothing will ever live up to my expectations.",1328140800,4,2681,4.41497975708502

I do believe people are overreacting and getting way too angry about something while failing to look at the larger picture.  I watched these films and forgot just how much I loved them (more prevalent with the Original Trilogy) and I enjoyed them with unbelievably awesome picture and sound.  What I do agree with is that some of the changes are just not needed.  I loved that fact that Yoda was changed to CGI in Episode I.  It looked great and was one of the better changes that was made in Blu-ray version.  But changes like the notorious, ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" at the end of the Return of the Jedi and the change in the Krayt dragon call, just didn't make that much sense.  They weren't big enough to ruin the movies for me at all!  It's not like these changes changed the plot!  While I was confused as to why they felt they needed to make the changes, I'm not going to be one of those people who gets angry and goes on here to give it only *.  The changes didn't affect the quality of films (overall they're probably better) or how I would critique the films.  Coincidentally, the one that was tampered with the least in the Original Trilogy, the Empire Strikes Back, is still the finest Star Wars film in my opinion and one of the greatest science fiction films of all time.

7220328,5,B00YI71PN2,"ANYONE who rated this 1 star obviously did not even buy star wars the complete saga on blu ray. All they needed was a place to vent before the product was actually released. In my opinion you should not even be able to write a review unless you have actually owned the product. Thats just my humble opinion. So for those of you who are ""hating"" on the complete saga, go elsewhere, please. I've grown up on star wars just like many of you. (owned the VHS, saw the original trilogies when re-released in theaters, got the dvds, saw the prequel trilogy as they came out in theaters, owned the dvds, FINALLY got each trilogy pack when released as well with the unaltered original prequel movies) NOT to mention countless star wars merchandise (bed sheets, toys, drinking glasses, etc.) SO don't act like you are the only star wars fan in the world. There are many of us.

OK MOVING ON, i got this as a gift for christmas, but have not been able to watch it because i was finishing up the LOTR extended blu ray which is one of the best as well. The best thing is that you can be halfway through episode 1 and realize the brightness of the colors, the fixing of some CGI, and the INTENSE score and soundtrack that sounds amazing on blu ray, surround sound (volume WAY up), and tell me you don't regret your decision to own this! (Too bad they didn't take Jar-Jar out, i would not miss him.)

All in all, just watch through the movies, it will be like watching the movies for the first time again. Which is why we all love star wars in the first place, to feel that nostalgia of a timeless story.

There is nothing i can say about picture quality and sound quality that has not been already said, but WOW.

If you are thinking of buying but need that foot out the door, let me stand behind you and push you out!
If you are a fan of star wars, do you really need to think twice about buying this?

AND TO ALL THE COMPLAINERS: Have fun waiting 6 years for the next blu ray boxed set after Lucas re-releases (again) each movie in 3D. (If you have not heard, Lucas plans to release one movie each year. Do the math.) I can also laugh at you now because most of you who stand your ground and refuse to watch...GOOD. You really do not know what you are missing. And the rest are GOING to cave in and buy it anyways then shamefully admit that its actually good. I promise you that.

Chances are George Lucas might realize that a good amount of his fans appreciate the changes that he makes, but would rather see the movies the way they were originally.  After reading reviews that talk about disappointing sound changes that were made to certain scenes or visual effects that have been altered to the point of becoming a distraction.  I'll just wait until George Lucas releases an ultimate edition that includes the original theater version, and all the altered re-released versions since then.  We might have to wait awhile longer until after the new versions of 2020, 2024, and 2029.  Hopefully by then we'll have the holographic room version that will fully immerse the viewer - by then I'll have forgiven that they ruined the Han Solo/Greedo scene and the great flow of the movies with so many new add-on's.",1327449600,9,885,4.912751677852349

The fact that he wanted these changes is reassuring because art is ever changing and evolving.

7220332,5,B00YI71PN2,"Got as a gift for Christmas 2011--

I'm an old fan (was five when ep. 4 came out and my dad fell asleep during the Chilly Willy cartoon before the movie started so I had to wake him up to read the opening scrolling words to me).  And I hated eps. 1-3 when they hit the theater.  But I just watched them again, all in a row (1-6), and was very impressed.  The blu-ray quality was great, with only a few instances of the screen becoming weirdly grainy when it hadn't been in the previous scene seconds ago. (Any one have any explanations for this?)  It was good to see the stories all in a row, and the true test came when I watched them with my daughters (5 and 9).  Jar-Jar annoys me.  Not my girls.  They loved him.  And the monsters and the sounds were just as incredible to them as they were to me.

I also enjoyed reading the hater reviews and then watching the movies and trying to find the same problems they did.  Yeah, some of the issues could/should have been fixed, but for my part, if the dude who made the movie wanted to change the movie--it's his movie.  Go and make something this all-encompassing or this massive, and then see how you like it when someone who didn't participate in its creation tells you what you should and shouldn't do to it.  Or write a book and then let random-internet-troll edit it for you.  Or have a child and let the know-everything-peoples-of-the-internet tell you how to raise him/her.

I could be wrong, but from my perspective (having created tiny little movies, having written sadly-as-of-yet-unpublished books, and trying to raise two little girls), people (those who didn't create any given project) have every right to critique and complain when they don't like something about the movies they watch.  But the idea that comes across from so many of these hater reviews is that George Lucas changed the movie just to personally tick people off.  I bet he didn't.  But even if he did, it's his movie.  He can do what he wants with it.  Just like some of you wrote hater reviews laying out your vision, George made some movies laying out his...",1327104000,8,2091,4.467018469656992

I'm not going to lie, it is still possible to ignore all of the edits and have a good time; the original trilogy is just that good. At this point however, I just don't want to give George Lucas any more money, as the man clearly has no respect for his audience, his critics, or even his coworkers (for those of you who are unaware, one egregious example is the fact that Lucas superimposes prequel trilogy actors into key scenes involving Darth Vader and the Emperor, thus overwriting and erasing the work of the actors who originally played those roles.)",1326844800,17,768,4.572463768115942

Say what anyone wants to say, good or bad.  I'm not complaining.  I love it.

As a Blu-ray release it is stunning.  Much better than I thought it could be.  Amazing.  Chewy looks positively wonderful.  I could go on and on.  There are excellent comments by others on plots and technical matters.

I have no plan to criticize those commenters who seem to hate this release.  The proper manners, if there is a consideration for procedure, seems to be to judge the film but not those who comment.  Wish old deleted scenes were added if available.

I can love this release for three reasons.

FIRST----- I have VHS tapes of the original if I need to see the original.

SECOND----- the movie are six in total.  They are a progression of film making technology over years of production.  Over thirty-five years now.  Change was always there over such a large time span.  Blu-ray certainly is brilliant.

THIRD-----It's a story.  Logic and science are bent greatly and that's an understatement.  It was meant to be fun not worshipped.  It still is fun and very successful because it is fun.  It is known well in parts of this planet that can play movies at home.

There are 3 dics, all blu-ray, of extras.  The third seems to have material not released before.  I enjoyed it very much.  Especially the Rose Bowl parade material.

7220343,3,B00YI71PN2,"I bought the Star Wars blu ray after much hesitation due to the changes Lucas made with the original trilogy. I am not a hardcore Star Wars fan, but rather a casual viewer to the series but I have played all the video games, read a few novels, and of course seen all the movies so I understand the Star Wars universe quite well. Initially when Lucas changed the original trilogy in 2004's DVD release, I was able to live with most of the changes while being irked at them at the same time. I was lucky enough to have purchased the edition with the laserdisc originals. I was watching the series on my brand new LED TV, and decided that I needed to upgrade from DVD to Blu Ray.

First of all, the films to me are easily 5-Stars, but this review is about the overall product that is The Complete Saga on Blu Ray. So right off the bat 1 star is subtracted for the obvious reason that many other reviewers have expressed here, the simple fact that the originals where not included in any form makes the set called ""The Complete Saga"" incomplete. Those are the films that I grew up watching and hope to share with my children one day. All the cheesy ness special effects and all, Yes Han shot first and will have always shot first in my eyes. Ewoks can blink- fine, Darth Vaders NOOO in Jedi lessens the emotion rather than just being silent and badass. These have all been discussed in other reviews, but the fact that Lucas has done everything in his power to destroy the old prints is simply wrong and future generations will never see the films as they were originally intended to be shown.

Another star is taken off because of the poor transfer of Episode 1. I happen to have enjoyed Episode 1 despite many fans hating it. I remember the hysteria in 1999 when it was released and it was the first Star Wars film that I saw in theatres and it was an experience I haven't had since with going to the movies in the past decade. So it holds a soft spot for me - Jar Jar and all. The transfer looks terrible with so much DNR and clayface added in, they could have done much better. Episode 1 was the last film of the series to be shot on film (II and III were shot digitally) The originals (IV-VI) were shot on film over 30 years ago and look amazing on Blu Ray so there really isn't any excuse from Lucasfilm they just didn't put the effort in.

Also, I didn't take a star off because with the way crazy Lucas has been acting towards his fans, there might not be another release of the complete series with the originals. I held out pre-ordering because with all the hate of the special editions, I thought like the LOTR series, the originals would eventually be released in high definition. Now the rumor is the 3D box set will be released next of the same blu ray transfers in this set. While all of this is rumor and speculation, I cannot drop another star.

The positive for this box set is that this is the best the series has ever looked and sounded period. With exception of Episode 1 as stated before, the films look and sound fantastic and Lucasfilm overall did do a great job of bringing the films to Blu Ray format. I was glad I bought the Blu Rays instead of just settling for the DVD's because the difference is huge. When the price for this set gets to be manageable, I do recommend purchasing this set. It includes a lot of special features that are well worth it. I respect the fans who are boycotting this set and I feel their pain every time I hear that NOOOO, and hope one day we all can purchase the originals as they were seen in theaters and what I grew up watching on VHS. May The Force Be With You.",1326585600,7,3619,4.255813953488372
7220344,4,B00YI71PN2,"I was very unsure if I was going to buy this after it was announced that it had a lot more edits. I still don't understand why Lucas keeps on editing them when he knows the fans are against it. I own the trilogy from 2006 that includes the original theatrical versions of the films, and that set is actually really great, but there are no extra features and the picture quality isn't even as good as a DVD. I held off from getting this until January because I couldn't bear to watch more edits he made to the movie. After viewing the 2004 version of ""Jedi"" and seeing Hayden at the end...I never watched that version of the trilogy ever again. After months of thinking I came to the conclusion that Lucas is probably never going to re-release an HD version of the original trilogy again. He just does NOT care what people think. I understand that he wants all 6 films to fit together and look alike, but the fans want the films they grew up with. I have the originals on DVD and I guess I'm alright with that. So I bought in and bought the box. Though there are changes that I absolutely cringe at and CANNOT STAND, the original trilogy looks AMAZING. The picture and sound just is phenomenal. It is the ultimate way to experience Star Wars. The new Yoda in PM is actually way better than the puppet they had that didn't even resemble Yoda. The Ewoks blinking I could care less about that. I actually can't even believe he thought of doing that. The new door at Jabba's palace is another useless change. It just made me go, ""Wow...it's bigger?"". Who really cares? The ""NOOO"" sequence isn't as bad as people are saying. I don't like it, but I don't hate it. I wish it wasn't there, but whatever. I understand why he wanted it. But for those who think it's the same clip from ep III where Vader says ""NOOO"", it is NOT the same. Not as long and not as cheesy. Besides the new edits to the original trilogy, the box has everything that I would want. Remastered prequel trilogy (the films are NOT that great, but if I'm going to watch them at all, it may as well be in HD). The special features are actually great, especially the documentaries on the third disc. The deleted scenes are my favorite part after the docs.. There are some great scenes that I can't believe have never been seen before!

I know people will hate that I gave in and bought this and will say I'm not a real fan and that I have ""the Lucas Syndrome"", but I don't really care. I know I'm a fan and I also dislike the changes, but I'm not going to let it ruin this amazing set for me.. Even if you won't watch the original trilogy from this set, for 80 dollars you will still get the 3 prequels in HD, and 3 bonus discs with tons of features. I was almost going to just get the prequel trilogy on blu ray, but that itself is 40 dollars with NO FEATURES. Though this set should have included both versions of the original trilogy, it doesn't and I've come to terms with it. I will still watch the DVD's of the original trilogy more, but this box has so much to offer. All 6 films in 1080 with INCREDIBLE SOUND. Sorry if this gets people mad, but the set is great.",1326585600,4,3128,4.239530988274707

7220346,5,B00YI71PN2,"I am a recently-converted Star Wars fan. For anyone who hasn't seen the Star Wars movies, I suggest watching them as soon as possible. They're that good.

And this box set is exactly what an epic saga like Star Wars deserves. The packaging is beautiful. You can tell a lot of work went into the drawings on each page of the book and the collage of characters on the last page. But the packaging is just the beginning.

I saw Star Wars on DVD the first time, and it was amazing. But I wanted to see what the movies looked like in HD. So I decided to buy the set on Blu-ray for myself. In a word, the movies look fabulous. Even the original trilogy looks pristine in 1080p. Star Wars has never looked better.

Not to mention all the bonus features. The collection of spoofs on the last disc is absolutely hilarious, and there are enough deleted scenes, documentaries, and other goodies on the three bonus discs to last any fan a long time. Each movie also comes with two commentary tracks for more Star Wars fun.

Yes, there are some changes in this release that some fans may find disappointing, but this release is too wonderful for any Star Wars fan to pass up. The beautiful packaging, awesome picture/sound quality, and bonus features make this set truly epic, and they make this set the new standard for other home releases to compare themselves to.",1326499200,4,1353,4.487804878048781

If the die hards want to see things only in the 1st unimproved version does that mean they only watch video on 12"" black and white tube TV's to get that 'Nostalgic"" experience ??  I for one am perfectly happy to have the whole set on Blue Ray, with cleaned up picture, sound, minor tweaks, and all.  I can watch the original VHS tapes if I want nostalga, or the original laser discs, or the VHS box sets, or the regular DVD's, or the classic versions on DVD from Laser masters.....there are so many versions floatinga round why worry about it - watch what makes you feel good.  MY favorite version was seeing Ep 4 ""A New Hope"" in Cleveland, summer 1977, when it was still just ""Star Wars"", and the theatre had just shown Midway or some other picture in Sensoround with the big add on subwoofers and amplifiers -  in the opening shot of the Corellian Cruiser over Tantooine the rumble made the floors and walls shake & rattle - and the rest of the movie was just plain awsome -  ITS NEVER been that good anywhere since then.  If you are not into the changes and new versions - don't buy them - but let the rest of the world enjoy their moment.",1325808000,11,1439,4.241758241758242

Colors are more vibrant, scenes are better in texture and exposure...the shadows are cleaner...only two 'sounds' added and they enhance rather than detract. No 4 suns on Tatooine, only 2....that was a hoax as most of the bad ratings are. Whose movies are these?  GL, and he can do whatever he wants. Kudos to you George!  They are masterpieces!!

7220364,4,B00YI71PN2,"At first I was against getting the blu-ray Star Wars set, because like so many other fans, I object to George Lucas' tampering with a classic. At 25 I saw the original release in the theater when it opened in 1977. I got back in line and saw it again. I have attended opening day for each of the sequels/prequels. I bought them on vhs, and dvd upon release. I was so glad when the original theatrical releases were made available, and bought them too. So I finally gave in and got the blu-ray set. Wow! the picture quality is great! As I watched, I got all caught up in the story again, and didn't really care about the little changes. IT""S STAR WARS!!! I gave it 4 stars because I don't cars as much for the last 3, or first 3, whatever, (Prequels). I'm a fan, not a film-maker. I enjoy the saga for what it is. Every time The Beatles catalog is released I buy it again. Why? Because I'm a fan, and quality matters to me. When the original theatrical releases of Star Wars come out in blu-ray, I'll buy them again. I'm a Force-aholic, it is my destiny!",1325808000,8,1053,4.217821782178218

I do not have 6.1 sound and the sound was silent so I selected 5.1 sound but it is only available in English with commentary.  The commentary is for site challenged persons.  I am hearing challenged so I also like to have closed captions turned on.  I spent an hour trying to get the commentary eliminated with no luck.  Why would Lucas make the DVD with no 5.1 un-commented version of sound on the disk given it is probably the most prevalent sound system.  So please don't tell me to throw my 4 year old $1000 Audio equipment away and buy a new system.  Also apparently my audio equipment is not firmware upgradable to include more decoders.  I am very frustrated.  I will not buy more BluRay disks again because of the probability of having more audio problems.

7220371,4,B00YI71PN2,"I am happy with this product; the movies look amazing.  I was impressed with how much they were able to ""clean up"" the older movies.  I have not watched them enough to speak to individual changes, nor do I honestly want to take the time to catalog them all - I was interested in the overall experience, and just having these on blu-ray.

My real complaint with this product was the special features - particularly the menus.  The special features themselves were interesting and engaging (although I must add the disclaimer I have not watched all of them - only the first disk so far).  But...the menus were awful; you have to click on every interview and every prop piece etc. individually; a lot of the time you watch 5 or 10 minutes, then have to select something else to view.  Why didn't they just put everything in one file (for lack of a better word) by category, such as all interviews being together, so that you only have to click the menu buttons once and can watch a half hour or an hour rather than 5 minutes?  Or, all of the stuff on one planet together, if that is how they wanted to organize it.  I found myself very irritated having to sit up and hit the button on the remote every few minutes, especially since my (older) blu-ray has long pauses as it processes on these DVDs for whatever reason (it has never had a problem with any other DVDs).  If they had simply organized the special features in a more accessible, less hands on way I would have given this review a 4 or a 5.

EDIT: Upon actually trying the ""Play all"" button (Yes, I probably should have done that first) it allows you to play all the special features on that disk from a specific category, such as interviews.  Therefore, I am upgrading this to a 4 star rating.",1325635200,3,1751,4.3734567901234565
7220372,5,B00YI71PN2,"Yes, Lucus did change things. Many things, in fact. Personally I have been a fan of most of his changes except for the replacement of Sebastian Shaw in the final scene of ROTJ. Yet, there is one change in which Vader screams no when the emperor is about to kill Luke. For me, that adds more character and shows that he is turned. It is not silly. The picture quality is great, the audio is amazing, and there are a few things I see still wrong but do not care. If you see all the one star reviews, those are hardcore Star Wars fans. They want the original theatrical release on Blu-Ray with none of Lucus's changes. That will not happen for some time. I gave this five stars because the movies are wonderful, the color is great, and the sound will blow you away. Not because of its changes, that doesn't make this bad. So, if you're thinking of purchasing this item, and you are not worried about 10 second changes, get it. Unless you agree with the one star reviews, you will not be disappointed.",1325635200,8,997,4.336898395721925
7220373,4,B00YI71PN2,"I love all the movies. All of them. But I must say I wish they were not altered from the originals. There weren't many changes from the DVD versions but nevertheless I wish they hadn't changed them too much from the release versions.

  Episode VI, however crosses the line a little too much. The scene in Jabba's Palace with the singing and all that jazz DOES NOT belong in this movie and should have been left the way it was in the release version. I feel embarrassed that they decided to add this stupid scene to the movie. At the very end they added Vader saying ""no...NOOOOO!"" when he saves his son, wasn't too annoying, but I still liked original better.

  There are, however positive additions to this series that I would love to share one of. In episode I, Yoda does look A LOT better. I dare say he used to look more like a puppet than in V and VI, but now is animated much like  how he in in II and III. I liked this addition a lot and cannot say I miss the puppet version in the original episode I.

  Overall, I give this 4/5. It's Star Wars. That is a given. I just kind of wish it stayed the classic way. I enjoyed the better quality CG but that is all that was necessary to make this series Great.

  I got this because I did not have the whole collection in one set. So if you are thinking about giving this a buy, and you don't have the entire collection already, I would definitely recommend this to you if you're a star wars fan!",1325548800,7,1449,4.150537634408602

In that final moment of conflict for Darth Vader, having to choose between his teacher and his son, his silent suffering and the internal battle he wages while making that choice was far more gut-wrenching and harrowing when he was silent.  Hearing him now cry out and make his choice so early in that critical moment robs an enormous amount of energy from that scene, and really was a poor choice of re-editing.  I turn the sound down at that point now.

Still worth the purchase price, though, and a 4-star rating.",1325203200,6,669,4.773913043478261
7220382,4,B00YI71PN2,"This brief review is coming from a casual Star Wars fan, far from some of the fanatics who hate anything but the original versions.

Movies:
These are the same great Star Wars movies everyone knows.  I personally like all 6 as the story really pulls you in, although many purists simply hate the new ones.  This is understandable, but the casual fan will like them all.  Yes there were some changes added to the Blu-ray editions, but I don't think they are as bad as most have made them out to be.  This is especially the case if you're younger and may have never seen the original versions to begin with.  Overall, some of the greatest movies you'll ever see, especially if you have any interest in Sci-fi.

Video Quality:
The video quality of these 1080p Blu-ray's is very good for the most part.  Episode 3 is excellent and this is expected given it is the most recent.  All of the original 3 Episodes have very good quality which is really saying something considering their age.  Episode 2 is all pretty decent with episode 1 having the worst quality of the 6.  This is due to much of it being filmed with with early versions of digital cameras.  Overall I would give the picture quality a 4/5 for the entire series, taking into account the age of the films.

Audio Quality:
This is where all of these films really excel.  The sound is great on a simple 2 channel system, but watch these on a full surround sound home theater and prepare to be amazed!  There are very few other movies I have seen where the sound is on this level.  The light sabers hum around you, rumbling of spaceships and the dialogue are all top notch.  All of the Star Wars episodes definitely provide reference level sound, which I give a 5/5.

Extras:
I've never been one to watch extras, but this saga contains tons of extras to keep you busy for a long time.  If you want to see documentaries, behind the scenes and deleted scenes from Star Wars, then this Blu-Ray saga is for you!

Overall Impressions:
Overall, the Star Wars Blu-ray saga is a great addition for any Star Wars enthusiast or one who demands the best home theater experience available.  If you already have the DVD's, upgrading would be necessary only if you want to hear and see the absolute best.  I personally felt it was worth the upgrade for the audio quality alone and the great picture quality is the icing. I give the Blu-ray saga a 4.5/5 overall with perfect scores for the movies and audio.  While the picture quality is great, I feel they messed around with Episodes 1 and 2 a bit too much by adding too much edge enhancement, dropping my overall score a tad.",1325203200,10,2617,4.463157894736842

Ok so there were minor changes, I didn't notice, but like I said we are not fanatics. The video and audio is incredible on this set. Great rainy day movies, we watched them all day back to back and didn't get tired. We are definitely star wars fans now and will watch the saga over again many more times. I highly recommend these films to anyone who has not seen star wars or has seen it 100 times. For all the bad reviews about changes and no original copies, you probably already have the originals on VHS, so get the Blu ray versions and quit living in the past.

Yes, I love the theatrical version, and it would be nice to have it in blu-ray, but come on, it's 2012... move on people. Keep a VCR and watch your copy on VHS. If not, it's not difficult to find and it's still pretty cheap somehow. Again, this is Star Wars in blu-ray with amazing video, audio, and extras... you get what you pay for.

Yes, episode 2 and 3 sucked big time but the sound quality and picture in both trilogies are amazing. I still haven't seen the extras but will soon. If you are even remotely a star wars fan, despite all the negative comments people are giving, you definitely should buy this edition. If not for the movies do it for the amazing collectors box it comes in. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because it doesn't include the originals.",1324944000,5,633,4.283333333333333

7220393,5,B00YI71PN2,"First, I need to preface this with the fact that I have been using Amazon since they started and this is only the second review I have ever done.  I don't usually like to take the time, but here I felt I had to.

I received this for Christmas and have finished half of it now.  I LOVE this!!  I've waited years for all of these together.  I don't know what is wrong with all the people who hate this.  From what I have read, it seems they are all stuck back in 1977 and don't want anything to change.  I bet they all still wear polyester suits also.  So Lucas decided to update some elements.  In case you don't remember, these are his movies, he wrote them and they are his vision.  He can do as he pleases.  How many artists throughout history have painted completely over something they did previously?  He doesn't do that, he only uses the time, money and technology he has now to add to or correct areas that bothered him.  Sure there are little nit-picky things I would personally like changed, but I am not the creator of this, so it's not my place to say.  Art is not a democracy.  Overall, this is a fabulous set, I love the packaging and all the extras.  Lots of little trivia and details I would never have known otherwise.  Especially areas like costuming, where you can watch the movie and say that the dress looks cool, but when you get a zoom of the detailed embroidery you just got WOW.  And then to know that a set that took eight weeks to build was used for less than a day and then destroyed.  Since I am not in the movie biz, these details are fascinating.  And then the personal piece that Ewan McGregor tells about his uncle and his personal recollection of the first movie.  That kind of stuff takes it to the next level.  So stop your fussing, take a Prozac, throw away the polyester, sit back and enjoy.",1324944000,9,1828,4.252906976744186

It's that disconcerting. The recent changes for this Bluray set are absolutely hideous.  Was Lucas freaking high when he ok'd this garbage?

Why not change FLAWS.  Maybe get rid of matte lines, make it so you can't see Dave Prowse's eyes through the Vader mask.  I can live with that.  But these changes?  Dear God.  Lucas actually ruined possibly one of the greatest scenes of the entire series:  when Vader throws the Emperor into the shaft.  Or how about the way the music is made to artificially repeat in the added dewback footage?  Utterly shameful.

Not only do you offend us fans with this crap, but you offend the original artists who worked on these films.

You're not getting another red cent from me, Lucas.  I'm not funding your addiction to destroying three of the greatest movies ever made.",1324857600,18,1031,4.817142857142857

The Good:
- BluRay looks and sounds amazing if you have a decent sound system and High def TV.
- The artwork on the packaging is awesome.
- Lots of unreleased bonus material.

The Bad:
- The packaging looks great but is impracticable, the discs don't slide onto the normal spindles, they just sit in a cardboard sleeve. It's a project to get them out without touching the business side of the disc. (I'll be buying some BluRay cases to sidestep this.)
- No theatrical versions, if these versions were somewhere in the 40 hours of extra material, it would instantly be worth the money, but its not, so hang on to your VHS copies.",1324857600,4,832,4.361290322580645

Please make Star Wars 1-6 on Digital Copy Discs available for purchase or download on Itunes Please.
That is the only thing I need to complete my life. I already own every copy of star wars on LaserDisc, VHS, DVD, and Blu Ray.

I WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY 9.99 EXTRA FOR THE STANDARD DEFINTION AND 14.99 FOR THE HIGH DEFINITION VERSIONS ON ITUNES.

society really likes watching movies and buying them via ITUNES now. No one carry's around portable blue ray or DVD players.

I don't have much longer to live and promise to donate my organs after I die if you put all the star wars movies on iTunes.

I know there are people that are disapointed George Lucas made some changes to the movie but, I think it looks great. I would rather watch a movie that has been cleaned up a bit. I do like the orginial three movies untouched as I have seen them and kinda wish that George Lucas hadn't put Hayden Christensen in the last movie at the end. But, that part is a minor detail. Enough, when I put the first movie in and turned on the tv I was AMAZED and smiled while watchin the movies. My friends made the comment like, YOU REALLY LIKE STAR WARS, after watching movies one through three in a matter of days.

What if Micheal Jackson's 25th Anniversary release of Thriller included ONLY new versions of the songs that made it the best-selling LP of all time? New versions were paired alongside the old. I get the weaving of all six films together but someone needs to tell George Lucas and Lucasfilm that Episodes I, II & III can't hold a candle to Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back & Return of the Jedi. Without an originals option, THE ONLY OPTION WE ARE GIVEN IS TO BOYCOTT THIS RELEASE!! This Blu-ray release is a travesty - worth $20 at best.

It's so irritating! Especially since the ""fixes"" are completely stupid and unnecessary. WHY?! Don't even get me started on the story changes...there are plenty of fans here who've bitched about everything that ticked me off too...

What makes older movies like Star Wars so great is to see what special effects were like in our past. These shows were ground-breaking when they were released. Why not let everyone see them for what they were? Frankly, the effects in the originals were fine, even by today's standards. In fact, CGI can look just like CGI sometimes...fake or cartoon-ish. George Lucas...you WERE a brilliant man...now you're just....irritating! I will keep my original versions thank you. I am dumbfounded that there are any positive reviews. I imagine they are from the new generation who prefer the usually cartoon-like look of CGI and didn't see the originals twenty times before the new BS versions.",1323907200,15,1078,4.923076923076923

The sound and picture in this set are simply stellar. There sound has amazing dynamics that can give a light workout to even the highest of enthusiast audio systems. The DTS-HD tracks make full use of all audio channels almost perfectly. There are a few small mistakes where sounds that should be behind you end up in front and vice-versa, but it is very few and far between. I think I counted only 5 instances in the first (original) 3 films, this I can accept considering the audio master was recorded in Stereo.

The video in the all 6 episodes are quite simply the best I have seen in Star Wars, as it should be. The New Trilogy looks simply stunning. It is simply astonishing how good all these films look when played on a Modern LED projector or a new 240hz LED TV.

7220422,5,B00YI71PN2,"Star Wars on blu-ray is one of the best things for Lucas to come out with in the 21st century. He did a great job restoring the original trilogy. The best part of the box set I think is the bonus features. That is, three discs of bonus content, ranging from documentaries and never before seen footage on the first two including several deleted scenes that not that many people have seen. The other disc is just Star Wars fan-made content, with an hour and a half worth of fan-made and pop culture references to Star Wars. The only drawback to all of this excitement is that Lucas did not release the original ""A New Hope"", ""Empire Strikes Back"", and ""Return of the Jedi"" as bonus features, so diehard fans like myself will not have the privilege to see Han shooting first. I guess those will just have to sit in a secret vault at Skywalker Ranch for another twenty years or so until the next best way to view movies comes out. One good thing that Lucas did change in the newer trilogy was in ""The Phantom Menace"" and what he did was that he changed Yoda from that creepy puppet, to CGI to make him seem more lifelike and not creepy. Overall, this is a must buy for Star Wars fans all over, it is a great way to get into the series and introduce it to your children, but just make sure to tell them who shot first.",1323734400,9,1314,4.239043824701195

He is saying ""No, don't kill my son."" or at least thinking it. I know people will disagree with me, but I like it. The bonus features I like too including the Deleted/Extended Scenes.

I finally received the set in September 2011,but to my surprize and horror,Disc #2-""Attack Of The Clones"" had 2 defect/glitches in it in two differant places during the movie! The first defect happens during the night scene when Anakin frees his mother from the Tuskin Raiders that have kidnapped her,and the second defect happens during the scene where Yoda gets off the transport ship during the battle on Geonosis. I double-checked these scenes to be sure it was not something else,but they were and are genuine defects made during the duplication and or the mastering process at some point,just who is at fault I do not know,but someone is. Amazon sent me 2 sets,and both had the same defects on Disc#2. I also contacted Fox about it,they sent me a replacement for Disc#2 with the same exact defects! I am pleased over-all with Discs#1,#3,#4,#5,#6,#7,#8,and#9,but my problem has not yet been teken care of.

I've never been that into Star Wars. I believe the first time I saw a FULL Star Wars movie was when I was in my middle school's pottery class. Yep.  That was about 16 years ago. I thought they were good, and I can see why people are so fanatic about it, but I was ok with just seeing it once and maybe catching a few clips here and there on TV.

As most people were, I was dissapointed with the hype of the new prequels, and never really saw all of Episode III. I have seen the rest though, and plan to watch them all again someday.

Having them all on Blu-ray in one spot is pretty cool, and I hope to watch them all in chronological order someday with my son when he's a bit older. I have the luxury of not being a fanboy and I don't have to worry about the changes made and the lack of the original's being included.

I recommend you don't taint the folks new to Star Wars with all the negativity of what Lucas has done, and let them just enjoy the films as they currently exist. They can become fanboys later and complain.",1323216000,12,1201,4.00836820083682

7220432,1,B00YI71PN2,"I will start this review by raving how Awesome Amazon.com is with Customer Service! I had bought this item in pre-order, and when they mailed to me, the courier lost it, so Amazon sent me another copy completely free of charge! They are, without a doubt, the most amazing webstore in the World!

Now that I have said that, I'll take the time to tell you why this edition is an insult to Star Wars Fans everywhere. Unfortunately, the fact that we keep rewarding Lucas by buying the raped editions of our childhood memories means that he will continue degrading the brand until Star Wars is just another movie, instead of the legend it once was.

About the prequel trilogy, plenty has been said about why it sucks (see here: [...]). But this edition has 9 blu-rays: 3 of the prequel trilogy, 3 of a raped edition of the original trilogy, and 3 of extra content. I bought this Complete Saga edition mostly for the extra content, and because, despite its shortcomings, the blu-ray gave the prequels its shine in aesthetics. No doubt, they are some of the most beautiful scenes ever shot, despite they not making any sense at all or having absolutely no storylines, much less credible ones.

About the original trilogy, though, there is a lot to say that hasn't been said. First of all, while it is true that works of art are never finished, but merely abandoned, change does not automatically translates into improvements. However, there are some improvements in the trilogy. Not everything is bad. And remember, this isn't the first time Lucas makes changes to the original Trilogy. He changed them when he released the 20th annyversary edition in the 1990s, and then changed them again in the DVDs. There are changes I like and changes I dislike. Most of the changes I dislike, I consider them bad because they either reduce the impact of the narrative or reduce the emotional force of the story. I find it surprising that, for a space opera loosely based on a Kurosawa classic, Lucas can't understand that the old eastern adage that ""less is more"" is particularly relevant to emotions in narratives.

Of course, I'm upset that Han still doesn't shoots first (a fact that added character and depth to him), and of course I despise that Darth Vader now screams like a little girl ""NOOO"" when saving Luke in ""Return of the Jedi"", instead of the original silence that added tension and allowed us to see and feel the conflict within Vader and, more importantly, feel the relief of Vader suprising us with his decision of saving his son and returning to good. But those are easy to see. I am more upset by the countless small stuff that add up and reduce the overall quality of the film simply by being there. An example of this is how ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is completely ruined in the last few seconds. In the original film, Luke, Leia, C3PO and R2D2O watch from a window how the Millenium Falcon, piloted by Lando and Chewbacca, start the gigantic quest of searching for Han Solo, and the impossibility of their challenge is made clear on us by the smallness of their ship and the enormous size of the Galaxy the get lost in before fade out. In the new blu-ray version, immediately after the Falcon penetrates the Galaxy, we see a reverse shot of Luke and Leia from outside the window that pans out and shows us the might of the Rebel Fleet. As you can see, in the original version, we were left wanting to see how would our gang make it against impossible odds! It was an emotionally charged, perfect ending to a dark movie. Instead, in the new version, we see the aesthetically pleasing,, but otherwise pointless might of the Rebel Fleet, which tells us that we don't need to worry about Lando and Chewie because the Rebellion is mighty. Since we don't need to worry about them, why do I even want to watch the sequel? These are the little things that completely ruin the Saga for me.

So, yeah, this edition is great on visuals, but drastically poorer than all other versions that preceded it. I recommend you save your money and buy older versions instead. Don't do what I did and reward Lucas for ruining the best films ever. Don't make this insult to Star Wars fans a success.",1323216000,13,4182,4.593038821954485

I don't know what most of the people's problems are giving a one star as their review, other that they are traditionalists. George Lucas did very well in the re-releases and he got most to of what he originally wanted to do with some of the scenes. I cannot imagine seeing the original release without the redo's on blu ray, I wouldn't have paid the money. If you have a problem with this then keep your VHS tapes in good shape because that is the quality that you will be watching. I feel the same way about TLOR which I now have on blu ray.

Everything else they say is a lie. I have personally watched all 6 films and most of the bonus features, here are the facts.

Q I heard Puppet Yoda was dubbed over with CG Yoda in Episode 5 and 6 is that true?
A No he is still the classic puppet Yoda

Q Dose Greedo Shoot first?
A No, in this version Han shoots a milla second earlier

Q How is the picture quality?
A Episodes 1-3 looks phenominal, Episodes 4-6 look greatly improved but could be better.

Q Dose Darth Maul speak now?
A Yes he has about 5 lines of dialog added in Episode 1

Q Any significant changes?
A Very minor tweaks only uber fans would notice. Over the course of all 6 movies, about 5 minutes of new footage added, and 2 seconds of alterd scenes. Most notable When Darth Vader chucks the emporer in that pit he shouts No.

Q What is the deal with the 90 minute spoof feature
A It's a collection of many Starwars moments from Tv Shows, Movies, music videos, Stand up, and online vidoes. They are hilarous.

Q How is the box?
A It's the thickness of 3 DVD's and the same length and Hight. It's also extremley durable, so don't worry about it wearing out.",1322524800,15,1299,4.234817813765182
7220446,1,B00YI71PN2,The changes are terrible.  I honestly to not understand why they made such stupid changes.  The fact that they changed Vader's lightsaber pink alone makes this a one star.

7220448,5,B00YI71PN2,"I bought this set for my boyfriend's birthday this month, but it was really for me. I have all six movies on DVD, but the quality is even better on Blu-Ray. The original trilogy is as breathtaking as ever, and the new trilogy is just as disappointing (they should have just remade them with better actors... but I digress.) However, this set is completely worth buying. We watched the spoofs that are an extra feature, and they were absolutely hilarious. You also get to see parts of the movies you've never seen before, with all of the deleted and alternate endings and the documentaries. It does have a lot of the same stuff as other Star Wars sets, but you can complete your collection with the Blu-Ray set. I think if you're a Star Wars fan of any caliber you should get this, if not for all of the bonus features, then just to watch the movies another hundred times on a different system. Do it! You know you won't regret it.",1322352000,9,930,4.412790697674419
7220449,3,B00YI71PN2,"C'mon people! First and foremost, Lucas is a businessman. You are foolish if you think that he or his people made these content changes and omissions because of incompetence and/or artisic arrogance. Would it be way off to suggest that maybe he wants his hyper-loyal fans to come back to see the un-abused original versions in the theatres until the Iranians finally blow us all to bits? So please, stop complaining about an 'unfair' but simple Lucas marketing strategy. As for the ad nausium detailed list of complaints about this set posted here, you are precisely the people who will pay to see the originals again and again, whether it be in the theatres or by pay-per-view which via most providers is not content that can be copied, even to a DVR. Do the math on this just at the current movie ticket, drink and popcorn prices for a family of 4, and you can see that George does not want the people who truly value the art in the orignals sitting on their butts enjoying his tri-trilogy at home for a mere $89.99. And by the way, technically, just the video cleanup they did on the original 1977 segment is quite commendable. Maybe we should take what we can from this set for now, as we know that we will be lining his pockets again when the originals become available again outside of this media.",1322352000,,1303,4.52542372881356
7220450,2,B00YI71PN2,"This is more-or-less my point of view regarding this latest release.  I was not interested in purchasing this set because of reviews I read, nor am I a fan of buying anything that gets re-released over and over again.  BUT, I got a copy loaned to me by a friend last week.  He likes them by the way - to each his own, and I surely will not judge him!  Anyway, I was not impressed with this version.  I really don't need to go into why, and rehash the same things that other reviews have complained about time and time again.  Suffice it to say, I have the same concerns about this version that about all of the 3 star and less customers have.

Just info to ponder.  I purchased and watched repeatedly the original version that was released  YEARS ago on VHS - unmolested and original all the way. I still have them and though my home is now converted over to the latest greatest in home theater entertainment with high definition flat screens, surround and blu-ray players through-out, I still have a VCR set up - just for my Star Wars videos (and a few others - like ""Smokey and the Bandit"", ""The Black Hole"", ""The Holy Grail"" - etc.) There is something about watching the original Star Wars trilogy with all the ""flaws"" still intact. When these movies where re-released in a box set for the FIRST time (but still on VHS), I refused to buy them... For one, I thought ""well, I already have them!"" And two, I knew exactly what was going on with George's insatiable appetite for his Star Wars fan's easily taken money. To this day, I have NOT purchased any remake or re-issue of the original Star Wars trilogy - period. Do I have Star Wars ANH thru ROTJ on DVD? Yes - the 1997 re-release.  It was given to me as a Christmas gift by a friend (I did NOT pay for them, nor am I a big fan of them). I also have the prequels on DVD. But that's it! Personally, I refuse to line the pockets of George Lucas time and time again every time he decides that he needs cash for a new Hummer or wants to remodel his home in the Hamptons and (again) pulls Star Wars out of the closet, brushes off the dust, sends it down to ILM and has them add some new CGI scenes, or sound tracks or add a deleted scene or two from the 'bin-o-deleted scenes' barrel (not too many, we need to keep some back for the re-re-re-release when he decide to have his head cut off and put in a jar like they do on Futurama - I hear THAT is expensive!). Ridiculous George!!  I know, I know... They are HIS movies, and he should be allowed to do with them as he pleases.  Yes, he should.  Never-the-less, there comes a time when you realize that George is capable of doing what his fans want, yet does not.  I'm going to guess that most of us, at some point, will start to wonder; ""Am I being taken advantage of?""  In my opinion, Yes!  If you're ok with that, well - you have every right to be. Some people like to see all the new ""cool"" stuff and can't wait for the next incarnation and will happily buy them, adding the latest version of the same movies to their stock-pile and increasing their overall investment to hundreds of dollars, again, for the same movies.  I can't do that.  If you're a true Star Wars fan, you know that George wanted his movies to be more than they were when he originally released them, but the technology to accomplish his dream just wasn't there...  But the way they turned out is what made them magical and filled us ""original"" fans with wonder.  What's wrong with giving that back to us in an original, untouched blu-ray release?

Lucasfilm is on the right track by embracing blu-ray technology - a little late, but hey - It's all part of the big $$ plan - right?? Anyway, if George wants another cent of mine, here's what he's gotta do.  Take the original, unmolested theatrical version of the original trilogy AND the prequels and go down to ILM, or where-ever he goes to have the movie doctors perform their ritualistic hacking and re-hacking of these classics and say these words only: ""Take to computer -STOP-, clean up -STOP-. Put on Blu-Ray -STOP-. Put in nice packaging -STOP-, mass produce."" If he'd only do that, I'd be happy to drop some coin once again for the original trilogy.  But until then, I cannot see buying another ""upgraded"" version.  Those of you who are still considering buying this... I'd wait!  Sooner or later, we ""original"" fans will get OUR version that WE remember watching in the theaters!!

I don't own it, I won't buy it, but I DID watch it.  I don't care for this newest ""beating of a dead horse"" version.  When it comes to reviews, what's the difference in whether you bought it and loved it, bought it and hated it, or refused to buy it and why??  None in my opinion - they're all important.  Let's see if Amazon agrees, remains neutral and allows THIS version of my review/feedback of this product to be posted.

As with all my reviews, the above is only my opinion of an item that I own or have tested.  Depending on the overall rating that I give it, it is possible that I may have either purchased or tested a faulty unit or an exceptionally good one.  Your experience may differ from mine, better or worse.  Paying attention to the up or down trend from several reviewers will help you make an educated decision on whether or not the item is for you.

""Instead of a story, let's just shake shiny keys in front of the baby!""  The first feature (A NEW HOPE) was the only good one, and the rest range from tolerable (EMPIRE, JEDI) to bile (all three prequels).

You want to lose yourself in genre story telling?  Great characters in compelling situations in space?  Surprisingly impressive effects within a far more impressive episodic story arc?  My sci-fried friends told me about such a series, and I didn't listen.  I could only conclude they were letting their genre preference get the best of them, but thanks to streaming Netflix, I've learned that the remake of --

Yeah there are some scenes its noticable, but I don't care that much. But at the scene in Return of the Jedi when vadar grabs his master and tosses him to save his son, its a very powerful scene with just silence from vader and you can tell how he is conflicted but adding him saying no has no value in it and sounds really silly. I'm glad I got the dvds that have the original theatrical release. I'm very surprised that the Blu ray doesn't have them which is a major downer and don't know why they would leave that out.

7220460,3,B00YI71PN2,"I've held a copy of this in my hand so many times debating on whether or not to purchase this. It's mostly due to that I really don't want to own yet another set of my favorite movies and do I really want to own the prequels. However, the Star Wars nerd in me is a completionist and I want to get it over with owning all six movies. And if I'm going to own Star Wars, it better be in the ""ultimate set"" format. I'm also a documentary nut and love watching how movies (particularly how special effects for the originals) are made. The bonus features discs alone make me want to buy this, but right now this is too expensive. I do love the quality of Blu-Ray discs especially with my favorite movies of all time in the best digital state yet. However, after reading about the changes, yet again, to the original trilogy I'm up to the point that I need to be drunk if I want to buy this or not. Yes, the new changes made absolutely no sense in 1998, 2004, and now, but overall this is a good Star Wars product.

I rated this product 3/5 stars in a way how each star represents to me:
  1 for being Star Wars films
  1 for all discs being Bu-ray
  1 for the multiple hours of bonus material
the 2 missing stars are obvious:
  1 for the alterations and not having the original Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi movies.
  1 for the (insert explicit word) poorly constructed prequel movies.

Overall, I really do want this collection, but for nostalgic reason, I can't see myself spending this much money for my favorite movies again and all of the bonus material.",1321920000,2,1578,4.258389261744966

I thought that the secenes where going to be more ""completed"". They all look bad with the exception of the one where Luke is building the lightsaber.

For the movies themselves the sound and video are amazing! But if I had known that the deleted scenes were so badly transfered I would have only bought the Original Trilogy (Episodes IV, V and VI).",1321920000,2,605,4.601851851851852

7220463,4,B00YI71PN2,"Initially I was not going to buy this set; not because the idea of 'The Changes' was frightening or outrageous to me, but because of the price. But of course I did buy it, and overall I'm not unhappy with my decision. Before I go any further,  I will admit that I'm a relatively ""new"" Star Wars fan who has basically only ever seen the special edition versions of the OT. I may have seen the original unaltered versions at some point when I was too young to remember. That may bias my opinion of this set; just like the old-school fans may be biased against the changes.

All the new changes don't bother me because I'm not used to the ""original"" versions. Even further than that, I LIKE the changes--at least the updated graphics--because they make the movie more realistic. I do wish Han shot first, and I don't understand the big deal (one way or the other) about a longer/additional 'NOOO', but all-in-all the changes add to the experience--for me. Watching the original Star Wars movies this past week, I've felt like I was watching a movie not yet 10 years old. Well, except for the 70s/80s hairstyles. Long story short, the changes do not take away from my viewing experience. I can understand how people believe that the changes destroy their experience, destroy movie history, although I don't feel that way. No, other artists don't re-do their works every 2 years, it's unconventional to do so, so on and so forth, but none of that bothers me. I don't mean to apologize for Lucas, I don't care what other people think, or what George Lucas thinks. I like the updates to the film! Sue me! (Please don't sue me :( I really do play nice.)

With that said, it would be the right thing to do for Lucas to at least put the original unaltered movies onto Blu-Ray, as an ""archival"" kind of release. For all I'm concerned, he should make whatever changes to his movies he feels necessary... but I don't understand why he won't release the originals. People want them, people are going to buy them, so why not release them? It can't be GREED, as many have stated. Do you know how much cash he'd make by selling the unaltered trilogy? HA! TONS! In my opinion, he's just embarrassed by the unaltered films and that kind of thing doesn't go away lightly. Eventually, it'll happen. In the mean time, enjoy the movies as they are released on Blu-Ray.

Now to some other bits...

PACKAGING

The packaging looks beautiful. The artwork, although simple and quite strikingly different and quiet for that of a Star Wars release, practically sums up the entire story in one image. Quite frankly, it's a nice little work of art, a simple commentary on the lives of Anakin and Luke.

Unfortunately, things aren't quite as perfect on the inside. The internal artwork is just as wonderful, don't get me wrong on that. It's the disc ""slots"". I HATE this kind of storage method--storing discs in cardboard slots. While BD might be less susceptible to scratching/damage, I still feel uncomfortable with this kind of storage for the discs. I've put them in a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Discgear-Selector-100-Auto-Disc-Retrieval-System/dp/B0015A70O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Discgear Selector 100 Auto Disc Retrieval System</a>, which is aesthetically pleasing and practical. It holds up to 100 discs, so you can easily store any discs from these unfortunately packaged box sets.

MENUS

The menus I dislike. They're cumbersome, the special features are scattered all over, by different planets and agh, it's just a mess. I LOVE special features and that's usually the first thing I go to with a movie or TV set, but these special features are a hassle to go through. Furthermore, the menu design does not look Star Wars at all. It's a black background, some gold lines and clips of the film. Frankly it looks like an early DVD menu, just with the advances of Blu Ray.

AUDIO

I'm not an expert but the movies sound fantastic to me, nearly like being at the cinema. The surround sound effects are phenomenal, encompassing the entire range of my audio system. Bottom line, you feel like you're in the middle of everything. This hold true for each of the films.

VIDEO

As others have said, Episode III probably looks the best but truly each movie looks so much better than their DVD counterpart. The original movies--changes aside, updated effects aside--look like brand new film. That's what I love the most about these releases, that the movies hold up against anything being made today.

Overall, I gave this set a 4 because despite the fact that I enjoy each movie, each transfer, and the bonus material, there are certain negatives to the box set. If you're a relatively new fan and have never seen the unaltered films, don't let the negative reviewers turn you off to this set because you're not going to get those films for a while. All in all it's a great buy for me.",1321660800,14,4904,4.801897983392645

I had a friend over and the first thing he said was ""Wow that is a really sharp picture"". And unlike most movies this is not just a rehash. There are a ton of touch ups they did in all the movies: adding additional background action and graphics, all the ships are enhanced to look better than ever, and they even took the terrible Yoda puppet out of episode 1 and made him computer generated. And the extras are actually interesting for a change! Their are numerous actual documentaries about all sorts of things and a whole lot of concept art n such, if your interested in that sort of thing. Don't listen to the sticklers who complain these aren't the theatrical versions. The picture is amazing, the sound is uber clear (surround sound is just amazing"" and this is the best collection of movies around.

Each disc is slipped into a thick cardboard ""page"" in a ""book"". No cases, just a slot for each disc.
However each page is so thick and hefty it does not give at all when you try to remove a disc.

How to remove a disc from this set:

1. Stick your index finger on the edge of the disc of your choice. Realize nothing will happen if you try to remove it this way. Then stick your finger under the edge of the disc, be sure get a good smear on the data side.

2. Now lift the disc away from the backing. Note backing won't bend, nor will flap over top of disc so you must really pull to lift it away from the back.

3. Realize this isn't enough to remove the disc. To compensate: roll more of your index finger under the disc so that you can simultaneously bend and pull disc out.

4. Watch disc. Please note all lasers and explosions look horrible. They're super saturated and don't look real, or even look like they're really there. Very distracting.

7220482,4,B00YI71PN2,"The Lucasfilm Limited/20th Century Fox Home Entertainment team has, over the past 10 years, released the six live-action Star Wars Episodes which make up""The Tragedy of Darth Vader"" on DVD several times; the Prequels initially as individual 2-disc sets (2001-2005) and the Original Trilogy (or Classic Trilogy, if you prefer) originally presented in a four-disc box set (2004).

These initial releases have been followed by two more re-releases, the first being the 2006 Special Limited Edition re-issues of the Classic Trilogy which include the ""transfer from laserdisc"" theatrical versions of Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1980) because fans weren't thrilled that they had only the 2004 ""for DVD"" versions of the 1997 Special Edition re-edits.  Two years later, Lucasfilm re-issued both trilogies in separately-sold box sets with slimmer DVD cases.

For the 2011 Blu-ray release of the movies set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, George Lucas has authorized a first-time ever box set, Star Wars: The Complete Saga, which presents all six films in one collectible package, which also includes three bonus discs with making-of featurettes, interviews, documentaries and even a selection of Star Wars spoofs.

What is in the box set?  Well, unfortunately for many fans, Star Wars: The Complete Saga doesn't include the original versions of A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi either. Instead, the set includes the ""official"" versions from the Classic Trilogy 2004-2008 DVDs, with several additional tweaks added for the 2011 Blu-ray editions.

(Note: All six Episodes of the saga received digital fixes, not just the '77-'83 movies. Some are very noticeable, including an all-digital rendition of Yoda which replaces that garish-looking dark-green puppet in The Phantom Menace, while some, mostly involving sound edits or added off-screen dialogue, are fairly subtle. Additionally, some glaring visual goofs spotted in the DVD releases have been either partially or completely corrected.)

To be honest, I am one of those rare Star Wars fans who aren't upset that Lucas did not offer the original 1977, 1980 and 1983 versions of the Original Trilogy with the Blu-ray set. I have those already on DVD and though I am fond of them, I prefer the updated versions.

As is often the case with Blu-ray reissues of movies already available on DVD, Star Wars: The Complete Saga offers viewers a mix of the old and the new.

For instance, the original 2001-2005 (from both Trilogies) DVDs' audio commentary tracks have been retained, but the menu design is different, more foreign language tracks and subtitle options have been added, and new audio commentary tracks - edited from archival interviews featured in ""making of"" specials and other sources - can be heard while watching each Episode.

The Bonus Features:

This, dear reader, is the only source of disappointment about the Star Wars: The Complete Saga Blu-ray set, albeit one that I will eventually will learn to live with.

To be sure, the complete ""carryover"" of extra features from the DVD version to Blu-ray would have made the set a bit more unwieldy and even more expensive, and I have seen a few Blu-ray versions of movies I own on DVD that don't duplicate all the extra features from the older format. The Blu-ray edition of Superman: The Movie, for instance, eschews at least one featurette found in the DVD's extra features section, and Terminator 2: The Skynet Edition doesn't include a Windows Media Player-only version of the original 1991 theatrical version that comes with Artisan's 2003 T2: Extreme DVD.

For me, Star Wars: The Complete Saga's only major weak point is the selection of documentaries on Bonus Disc 3, which has quite a few good bits (The Making of Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back: SPFX and A Conversation with the Masters: The Empire Strikes Back 30 Years Later are my favorites), but also includes a few less-than-riveting ones.

While I am not knocking 2007's Star Wars Tech, a documentary which delves into the sci-fi aspects of the saga and its comparisons to modern Earthbound technology and aired on cable's History Channel, I would have preferred to have seen that same year's Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed, which is an examination into how George Lucas borrowed from mythology and Earth history to create a story with themes that are relevant and universally appealing.

My Recommendation: If you own a high-definition TV and a Blu-ray player, you probably think that the Star Wars movies will look and sound better on Blu-ray than in any other home viewing format. And guess what? You'd be right. The digitally-remastered audio and video elements give home viewers clearer sound and sharper images than previous formats can, although the ""old"" DVDs still look nice when played on a Blu-ray player with an HDMI cable.

Sure, the fact that Lucas's team of digital artists has - again - tweaked both Trilogies and not included the older versions may still rankle some diehard fans, but to me, Star Wars: The Complete Saga is, despite its few shortcomings, really worth buying.",1320796800,24,5144,5.0554899645808735

7220487,4,B00YI71PN2,"Despite the criticism levied by the likes of Devin Faraci and other self-appointed movie ""iconoclasts""/contrarians, the Star Wars saga deserves credit for both ushering in over an initial decade of ambitious sci-fi and fantasy movies, and for having a long-term influence on moviemaking in general.  Say what you will regarding George Lucas's odd need for constantly (and possibly unnecessarily) revising his own work, noted filmmakers such as Peter Jackson, Ridley Scott, Christopher Nolan, and James Cameron have all cited George Lucas's Star Wars saga as an influence on their own notable bodies of work, not to mention other entertaining (if not quite as lauded) movies such as ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" and ""The Last Starfighter"" having been clearly influenced by the Star Wars franchise.  Informed by Joseph Campbell's studies of the common traits shared by myths of different cultures, colored by the pulp science fiction serials of the past, and crafted in a rather pragmatic fashion, with an emphasis on making a fantasy world that seems ""lived in"", Star Wars may have sacrificed ""thespian values"", but in return was imbued with a visually-based, likeable appeal.  In keeping with his approach to the DVD format, Lucas has (almost interminably) delayed releasing a Blu-Ray version of his movies, until it was clear the format would survive the hi-definition wars.  ""Star Wars: The Complete Saga"" was touted as the ultimate release of all 6 movies of the Star Wars franchise, in the current benchmark visual media.  So how does it measure up?

I'm going to be honest here- this release is a tad disappointing, but more so due to various ancillary disappointments, as opposed to the visual quality of the movies themselves.  I'll break down each of the movies individually in a bit, but first I must address two of the main reasons this release got a 4 rather than a 5 star rating.  The first is simply the fact that 20th Century Fox continues to treat its consumers as second class citizens by imposing Byzantine copy protection schemes that actually render some of the discs unplayable in some machines, at least without having to mess around with firmware updates (and I wager that many ""casual"" movie fans wouldn't expect to have to download and implement software updates to their Blu Ray players in order to play such a well-known movie).  While the discs all work on my PS3, the Episode II disc won't even load on my father's Sony Blu-Ray player.  This isn't an isolated occurence, as I've read problems with various players on a number of forums.  This is simply unacceptable behavior from a major movie studio.  The second major issue is that many of the extras that were present in the DVD releases, including the outstanding ""Empire of Dreams"" documentary, and the prequel trilogy deleted scenes from the DVD bonus discs, were simply omitted.  Simply put, HOLD ONTO YOUR DVD BONUS MATERIALS, because this supposed ""ultimate"" version omits much of what the DVD releases had.  The good news is that at least the DVD commentary is still intact, with the added bonus of a second layer of ""archival"" commentary material.

Let's move onto the movies themselves.....

Episode I: The Phantom Menace: Easily the weakest of the Star Wars movies, wooden acting, poor dialogue, questionable pacing, and the constant in-your-face antics of the annoying Jar Jar Binks all drag this movie down.  The good news is that the Blu Ray release manages to improve the audio (which was too low in the DVD version), while the hi-definition treatment emphasizes one of the things that the movie did well: the bright, colorful visuals that manage to stay true to the Star Wars ethos.  Also of note is the fact that the oddly grotesque version of the Yoda puppet used in TPM has been replaced by the CGI Yoda.  Still, Episode I manages to confuse the idea of ""child-like wonder"" with ""childishness"".  Perhaps the concept of Anakin Skywalker starting his adventure as a little kid was a mistake.  In any case, this version's HD visuals are its saving grace, as the fidelity made it actually more watchable.

Episode II: Attack of the Clones: Episode II is rather tricky to review, as it's best described as the most perplexing combination of cool and crap that I've experienced.  On the one hand, when it works, it's a better film than its predecessor.  The action scenes (particularly the last 30-odd minutes when the Clone Wars begin), and the ""suspense"" sequences (i.e. Obi-Wan on Kamino and Geonosis) feel true to what fans like about Star Wars.  On the other hand, the ""romantic"" scenes are filled with some of the most awful dialogue and grimace-worthy acting I've ever seen.  It's almost as if George Lucas yelled ""action!"", and suddenly wandered off, distracted by shiny objects or something, leaving the actors without guidance.  Similarly, the HD transfer here is a bit ""oddball""- while the CGI-heavy cinematography didn't look too awkward in standard definition, there's something off and flat about some of the shots in HD.  Notably, there were some strange color-banding issues in one of the scenes on Tatooine.  At the same time, the almost cartoony color saturation has its own endearing quality.  This is a movie where Lucas more or less got the big story right, but goofed on executing the ""human element"", bigtime.

Episode III: Revenge of the Sith: Despite revisionists who claim Episode I was better in retrospect, Episode III clearly seems the best of the prequels, and in many ways stands in the company of the original trilogy.  Although still wooden and goofy at times, the acting is better, perhaps because this movie finally delivers the payoff we were expecting, and thus required a more tense atmosphere.  The pacing is what is key here, as the slam-bang opening action sequence starts things off quickly, while the mounting expectations of disaster for the Jedi keep the scenes on Coruscant rife with tension and atmosphere.  There's a lot of action (a massive space battle, five (count 'em, five!) lightsaber battles, Clone Wars scenes), and the downward spiral into darkness that is initiated at the movie's mid-point taps into the same well of darkness that The Empire Strikes Back drew from.  While there's a couple of questionable decisions here and there, this is a pretty entertaining installment.  In terms of visuals, this is, simply put, a benchmark for HD viewing, with the best effects of the series.

Episode IV: A New Hope: In terms of the movie itself....well, it's the first Star Wars movie!  Of course, this is the latest ""Special Edition"" version, not the original theatrical release.  The CGI Jabba (the DVD version, thankfully) is still there, along with the additional sequences.  As for the infamous ""Greedo shoots first"" scene......Lucas has tweaked it further, so that both Han and Greedo essentially shoot at the same time.  It's a tiny bit of compromise from Lucas, but by this point you've probably already made up your mind on whether his change was a dealbreaker.  One questionable change here is the revision of Ben's ""krayt dragon call"", which frankly, while more believable than the odd sound effect from earlier releses, is also sort of.......dumb sounding.  Visually, the HD transfer is actually surprisingly good.  While I was expecting the higher resolution to make the ""composite squares"" surrounding the Tie Fighters in space look more glaringly obvious, Lucasfilm managed to subdue that effect relatively well.  Obviously there will be issues with a 35 year-old special effects movie, but overall, I'm pleased with the result.

Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back: The ""darkest"" chapter of the original trilogy is also the most personable, and Lucas kept his meddling with ""history"" relatively subdued and in good taste.  The changes are generally improvements, with the most notable being inserting Ian McDiarmid into the scene where Vader speaks with the Emperor via hologram (which was done for the DVD release).  Continuity-wise, it was a pretty necessary decision.  For theatrical release ""purists"", this installment will undoubtedly cause the least amount of grief.  Visually, Empire is on par with the other original trilogy releases, and Lucasfilm makes some of the dodgier lightsaber effects shots from the DVD a bit more palatable here.

Episode VI: Return of the Jedi:  Unfortunately, Lucas has historically saved his most egregious film ""revisionism"" for this entry, for whatever reason.  It pains me that despite the cries of fans everywhere, Lucas refuses to undo that most horrid of the Special Edition alterations- the ""Jedi Rocks"" Max Rebo musical number.  It boggles the mind as to why Lucas thought we'd still want to see this terrible, out-of-place reject from the Muppet Show cutting room floor, with all it's ""look at me, I'm computer-generated"", in-your-face, tone-deaf obnoxiousness.  Similarly, you'd think that if Lucas was dead-set on replacing Sebastian Shaw with Hayden Christiansen in the ending ""ghost scene"", he'd at least dig up a less ""creepy"" shot of him for the Blu Ray release.  But....no.  This time around, Lucas also added a couple of other changes, such as Wicket the Ewok blinking (it actually is rather subtle), and Vader yelling ""no....no!!!!"" when making his decision to stop the Emperor from killing his son.  That last decision isn't quite as awful as people make it out to be, but I still think Vader silently making his ultimate sacrifice was just fine as it was originally done.  Visually, RotJ is well done overall.  It's a shame, though, that Lucas refuses to listen to the fans, and won't at least tone down his prior mistakes.  Still, in the context of the prequel movies, RotJ actually resonates a bit more thematically.  Namely, the basic emotional necessity of ""attachments"" that the Jedi Order of the prequels denounced, turned out to be the very thing that saved the galaxy, as the emotional bond between Vader and Luke is what drove Vader to kill the Emperor.  Interesting stuff.

While I've discussed the omission of the DVD bonus features, I should note what has been provided.  The prequel deleted scenes are interesting, but unlike the DVD deleted scenes, are actually sort of half-baked, with grotesquely unfinished effects.  The real gems are the deleted scenes from the original trilogy, including the ""Taschi Station"" scenes, which were to be the original introduction of Luke.  There's also an assortment of interviews, and of course, the ubiquitious presence of Rick McCallum, whose main job on the DVD commentaries and interviews appears to be to remind us how awesome George Lucas is.....many, many times.  The ""spoof"" reel is kind of chintzy, and is mostly forgettable.  While I enjoy the appearance of the Star Wars Gangsta Rap in this ""gag reel"", the lack of the classic ""Hardware Wars"" short film pretty much robs this feature of its relevance.  There's also some rotatable models of certain ships, with a bit of nifty video commentary embedded in that feature.  It should be noted, however, that the special features menu is clunky, and reacts slowly.  And while it was always a long shot, the inclusion of the ""Star Wars Holiday Special"" as a hidden easter egg would've been a funny surprise.

So there you have it.  Visually speaking, this is the best version of the movies yet.  For that, it deserves 4 stars, as despite its flaws, Star Wars is a seminal franchise in moviemaking.  However, a myriad of questionable decisions regarding omitting content, the continued presence of the ""Jedi Rocks"" musical number, and 20th Century Fox's ""screw the consumer"" mentality rob this otherwise essential set of its 5th star.  Thanks for bearing with this rather long review, if you're still there!",1320624000,12,11728,5.04356846473029
7220488,1,B00YI71PN2,"I was looking forward to purchasing the original Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi movies on Blu ray with some extras. Unfortunately, that isn't possible. I guess George Lucas doesn't like his original movies at all.

I remember watching Star Wars in the theater as an 8 year old back in the day when Lucas considered it ""good enough"" to release. Also, watching the sequels, collecting the toys,etc. Since then the versions have been updated with belching and farting noises among other things.  To me, the lamest thing is having Jabba the Hutt in Star Wars. (I know it was in the original book, but leaving him out makes more sense).  In the original version of the movie Obi-Wan explains, ""You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy."" Then when Greedo and Han have a conversation and Han shoots him it is because (as I understand it) Han knows he won't make it out of the Cantina alive otherwise. That's just the way things go on this planet. Obi-Wan didn't just make that statement to kill time.  We also see other not so nice things happening at the Cantina. In the updated version we find out that it's no big deal-Jabba just scolds Han for not paying him and Greedo dies for trying to fire his gun first. We no longer have the Han Solo in the wild west of outer space idea-protecting himself from what he knows will happen. In the updated version of the movie, I wonder why Obi-Wan's statement wasn't also updated as, ""Hey there are some scummy looking people here who might say mean things to you so try not to cry.""

I'm not a fan of the ""Menace"" other than about 5 minutes of it, but the Clones and Sith movies have some good parts here and there with Yoda kicking ass being a favorite. I still don't understand why the acting seems so wooden from some people who have done well in other films. Now I guess Lucas wants to make the original movies even more like the inferior prequels by changing more stuff. He has already changed way too much. That makes me very sad. Darth Vader used to be one of the great movie villains (and still is if you just watch the original versions of Star Wars, Empire and ROTJ). Now he is becoming an annoying person.

Anyway, I hope my VCR and VHS videos of the original movies hold up for a long time so I can watch the best versions.

I also hope that no one gets the idea to ruin a lot of my other favorite movies. I really don't want to see Julie Andrews belching out ""The Hills Are Alive,"" or random farting animals blocking Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dances.",1320624000,10,2548,4.385593220338983

Drop the hate and maybe that feeling will come back. Enjoy them as you did the first time and you will be much happier.

Edit: I also want to add that there are a lot of parts I try to ignore (the new Jabba Palace song especially even though I didn't like the original that much either and of course Han and Greedo) but the Pros more than out weigh the Cons. Seeing the original trilogy in crisp HD and hearing the Millennium Falcon fly across my TV room is reason enough. There are way more original parts than changed parts. Purists have tunnel vision and these little parts are insignificant. For example if history were different and the originals had blinking Ewoks or a ""Nooooo"" at the end of Jedi and Lucas changed that to non blinking Ewoks and a silent Vader in the remakes people would be just as hysterical.

This is what you do NOT know:  How is the audio and video quality of this Blu Ray Release?

Here is the plain and simple answer:  AWESOME

Do I love all of the movies for their content?  No.

Was I completely blown away by the superb audio mix?  YES.

Is the video quality great?  YES.

7220506,5,B00YI71PN2,"Star Wars is an institution of cinema, it's not just a movie (or movies) but is also a cultural
phenomenon, a revolutionary franchise, a highlight in Hollywood's history and more. With an
excellent entertaining story, endearing characters (at least in the first three), spectacular and
revolutionary special effects, epic action sequences and the best score ever, this saga is truly
unique and amazing.

While the first three films are all classics and modern masterpieces, the prequel trilogy is
somewhat of a mixed bag that does not achieve the heights of its predecessors but they are not as
bad as many have claimed and they are still enjoyable in its own right.

This BD set is one of the most, if not the most anticipated release in the HD format. When it was
first announced, many sentiments circulated around the net: joy, anger, anxiousness, etc. Star
Wars is such powerful that we, the people have strong reactions towards it. Of course, with a new
release, there is also new controversy. First the bad news: the films presented here are new
""Special Editions"" that are ""closer to the vision George Lucas have for his films"". I really don't
mind when directors go back to their previous work and do some changes as long as they give as
the option to choose the new version or the original release that everyone likes. George Lucas has
never give us such option and that's what bothers me the most. I wouldn't mind the special
editions if the original were also included (completely restored of course) and we were given the
option to choose. With Star Wars that has never been the case but, as mad as I may be, I have
learned to live with the pain and live with the changes that can be very subtle or very obnoxious and
stupid.

I should warn you that if you absolutely don't tolerate the changes then don't buy this set. If you,
like me, have learned to tolerate them or don't care about them then this set is very
recommended.

I will review each film, their picture and sound quality and some of the changes that have been
made.

Prequel Trilogy (1999-2005)

Ep. I: The Phantom Menace (1999)
After Ep VI was released in 1983, the world has lived happily without a new Star Wars film for 16
years. But when George Lucas announced that he was going to release a new Star Wars film that
was going to be the first of a new trilogy, the world jumped with joy. Ep. I was one of the most
anticipated movies ever and the excitement was visible everywhere. When it was finally released,
Ep I was not proclaimed as an instant classic like the previous film and many people felt
disappointed with what they saw on the screen. To be fair, the first three films were sacred goods
and Ep I had to reach impossibly high standards. But, that it's no excuse to deliver a film that was
a mixed bag from beginning to end. The picture has a lot of problems, the main one been the actors. I
don't know what George saw in Jake Lloyd but he is not a good Anakin Skywalker. He is one of the
main detractions of the film, which is bad because he is the main character and if you don't like
him, then the whole movie is hard to follow. The other big detraction and this may be the biggest
one is the inclusion of the creature Jar Jar Binks. Many people have complained about the Ewoks
on Ep VI but the whole group of them are not as annoying as this creature. Jar Jar is such a bad
character that comes close to ruining the whole film. Natalie Portman is an amazing actress but here
she seems a little out of focus and uncomfortable. The best characters and performances are from
Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor as the two jedi knights that save the day. Other problem is that
some sequences are too long like the pod race which begins very good but then drags a lot and
ultimately becomes boring. The plot is too political and lacks the excitement that the previous films
had and overall, you never feel connected to the characters. On the positive side, the visuals are
amazing with spectacular special effects, the action sequences are exciting, the lightsaber fights are
fun much more dynamic and of course John Williams score is always of great help to all the films.

TPM  has a lot of issues but ultimately is still watchable and sometimes, it is genuinely fun.
Recommended.

Movie: 3 stars.

Ep II: Attack of the Clones (2002)
After the lukewarm response to Ep. I, Ep. II was supposed to be a return to form for the franchise
and while is definitely an improvement over the previous film, it still has some troubles, mainly
one which can be summed up in two words: Hayden Christensen. How can you enjoy a movie when you
absolutely hate the main character? That's the main problem I have with this film, I can't stand
Anakin Skywalker. While the action sequences are better, the battles are bigger and more
interesting and is great to see Yoda in action, Anakin is a real pain in the a**. Again, Ewan
McGregor is the best character in the movie and you root for him instead of Hayden. But, not
everything is Hayden's fault. A lot of blame goes to Lucas who wrote the character as a stupid,
stubborn, whiner. Natalie Portman is good but when she is with Hayden, their lack of chemistry is
very palpable. The love scenes are very ridiculous and you just can't help but laugh sometimes.
What this movie does right, aside from the battles and special effects is that gives us more stellar
performances from supporting characters like Ian McDiarmid, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker,
Christopher Lee and Samuel L. Jackson and of course there is no more Jar Jar. It's also great to see
the jedi order in its splendor, fighting as a strong group. And of course Williams score is as always
excellent.

Ultimately, AOTC is fun to watch despite its problems and is better than Ep I. Recommended.

Movie: 3.5 stars.

Ep. III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)
Now this is a return to form for the franchise. Ep III, which is easily the best of the prequel trilogy, provides a satisfying conclusion to the saga and I can easily say that is a great film. The story is much darker and the action sequences are great. The battles between Anakin and Obi-
Wan and between Yoda and The Emperor are simply amazing. Surprisingly, Anakin is not as
annoying as it was on the previous film and he fares better here. For a movie that you know what
will happen, Ep. III is a fun ride and almost equal to Ep. VI. Highly Recommended.

Movie: 4.5 stars.

Original Trilogy (1977-1983)
Star Wars (also called-Ep. IV: A New Hope  1977)
Countless of things have been said about the original SW so I won't delve to much in it. Suffice to
say is that while no movie is perfect, this one comes pretty darn close. It's a classic with
unforgettable characters, a great story and special effects that are still spectacular to watch until
this day. A masterpiece.

Movie: 5 stars

Ep. V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)
My favorite SW film and one of the best movies ever made, TESB is as perfect as the first film and
even better. Darker, with great performances, a wonderful twist and an unforgettable villain, this
movie is perfection 100%. Very Highly Recommended.

Movie: 5 stars

Ep. VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)
While this is the weakest film of the OT, is still a great film that gives a great conclusion to a great
trilogy. The main problem it seems to be the Ewoks but I don't find them that annoying (again
watch Ep I and we'll talk about who is really annoying). Ep VI is lighter than V but is also full of
thrills like the triple final battle, one in Endor, the other in outer space and the most important one
inside the Death Star. Ep. VI provides a perfect completion for a perfect trilogy. Very Highly
Recommended.

Movie: 4.75 stars

Video & Audio
Ep I is the worst looking movie in the whole set. Much blame goes to DNR that makes the picture
look weird. Faces are sometimes soft, night scenes are sometimes crushed but overall is not a
bad transfer. In fact, it has never looked better but it could have looked better if a better effort
was given.

PQ: 3.5

Attack of the clones look much better but still has some problems again with softness and some
colors are not well reproduced. But, overall is a godd transfer and I'm sure it will satisfy everyone.

PQ: 4

Revenge of the Sith is completely demo quality. Is as perfect as anything you will see. A
spectacular transfer.

PQ: 5

The original trilogy looks uniformly excellent. I was surprise that they did not eliminate all the
grain in the film like in Ep. I and there is a layer of it throughout the three films. Skin tones are
warm, colors are well reproduced and detail and contrast are spectacular. You will marvel at how
good the movies look. Some DNR is apparent in some scenes but overall the three movies have
stellar transfers. I'm very happy with the results.

PQ: 4.5

Sound is spectacular in all six films. The 6.1 DTD-HD MA in the whole saga is dynamic, strong,
clear and completely amazing. There is no sign of damage or hiss. This is a stellar mix for all the
films.

AQ: 5

Changes:
This edition has some new changes in the films:
The best one and the only one that feels appropriate is the replacement of puppet Yoda for a CGI
one in Ep. I. Is far more pleasing than in the original release.

The other changes unfortunately are again done in the OT. Fortunately two of them are not very
annoying. The first one is is Ep. IV where Obi-Wan's screams in the desert was changed and
enhanced. The other is Ep. VI and now the Ewoks blink. Both changes are hardly noticeable.
Unfortunately, the most annoying change, also happens in Ep. VI and now Darth Vader screams
""Nooo!"" before throwing the Emperor down the Death Star. This change is very stupid because the
original scene was perfect but you know what they say ""this comes close to George's vision...""
As for the previous changes, they are still there but now Han and Greedo shoot at the same time.
At least now, this is closer to the vision we had of the scene. But for me, the most awful change
was the replacement of Sebastian Shaw for Hayden Christensen at the end of Ep. VI and
unfortunately he is still there ruining the end of the movie. Thanks a lot George.

Bonus Features
This set comes with so many bonus material that you will have to see it for days. Everything is
great and interesting.

First, on discs I to VI, you have two audio commentaries, one from the previous DVD releases and
a new one that is a compilation of archival interviews.

On disc VII you have the archives for Ep. I-III where you will find interviews, model collections and
concept galleries for each film. Most important, you have 22 deleted scenes, 6 for Ep. I, 5 for Ep.
II and 11 for Ep. III. This is the highlight of the disc and they should not be missed.

On Disc VIII you have the Archives for Ep. IV-VI again with interviews, sculptures, models,
concept galleries and 23 amazing deleted scenes, 8 for Ep. IV, 10 for Ep. V and 5 for Ep. VI. They
are a must-see for everyone.

On Disc 9 you have a variety of documentaries including three making of documentaries for the OT
films, a documentary about the changes done in 1997 for the films re-release, a homage to troop
501, a documentary about the SW creatures and a very fun one with all the parodies of SW.

The bonus material is excellent and is clear that Lucasfilm put a very strong package. The only
downside is that none of the DVDs bonus material has been ported over, including the excellent
'Empire of Dreams' documentary. Still, this new material, particularly the deleted scenes, is
amazing and will be a great treat to everyone.

Closing Thoughts
The Star Wars saga is one of the most legendary pieces of filmmaking ever made. While not all the
films are perfect, overall the 6 films provide top-notch entertainment and deserve to be seen. This
set is almost perfect with spectacular picture quality (most of the time), superb audio and plenty of
excellent bonus material. The only downside are, as always, the changes done to the films and the
exclusion of the DVD bonus material. Maybe some day we will see a definitive Star Wars set with
the inclusion of the originals but until then, this set comes very highly recommended!!!",1319932800,12,12169,4.501133786848072

I fear that the way the case is set up that it may result in scratches down the road.  If you are a fan like I am do not let kids remove the discs.,1319932800,9,444,3.6210526315789475

Lucas needs to release the original movies like we all want. That I would pay for. Not this. Lame! I feel so sorry for the generation who will only have this to watch and never saw the groundbreaking original releases.

Scenes in episode IV and episode V (EMPIRE STRIKES BACK) are ridiculously clear and improved - even on a huge screen (as I have - albeit a high end one  The packaging is also really nice - a solid book-like feel to the set with nice graphics/art worked in for each movie and the extras. I was disappointed that Lucas opted NOT to include a digital copy feature given the new generation being introduced to these classic movies, preventing easy portability for kids, etc and/or playing in a car/truck without blu ray capability. I couldn't help feeling Lucas was holding yet one more thing back to make us buy again...GRRR....HEY GEORGE - we've already paid PLENTY!  They should provide a code and allow those who paid for the set to download portable copies. Still, this set is a MUST for any STAR WARS fan!

7220515,1,B00YI71PN2,"Disappointing and kind of sad really.  You'd think Lucas would figure out that folks will stop buying his movies if there isn't a compelling reason to buy them.  With the digital upscaling on most players these days there is no reason to buy this set vs. one of the older sets.  If you must see the deleted scenes (which face it you'll watch once), just rent it.  Plus if you find the constant ""tweaks"" annoying (I actually don't care anymore), then the vader ""noooooooooooooo"" may make you go postal.",1319760000,9,501,4.595505617977528

The only thing I'm really dissapointed in is that the horrible blue tent is still on the originals from the DVD release-I read somehere they fixed that,  they didn't.  I'm all for changing things up, I just wish they would make more of an effort to make sure the change is for the better.  But these people who have gone from loving Star Wars to hating it-if you don't like an altered version of Star Wars then simply don't watch it.

I recently saw the Adywan Star Wars edit-

<...>

and was very impressed. It's literally a perfect example of what a tweaked Star Wars movie should be. Every change made the movie better, made a movie I've seen a hundred times new again.

The major, major fallback is the extremely long loading time on ordinary bluray player. I'm using a Denon mid-level player and it takes around 5 minutes from the insertion of disc to the real movie starts. The DVD takes 30 seconds.

There are obvious enhancement of the image quality but this improvement often uncovered a lot of the visual effect fault, so the film does not look as natural as in a DVD.

That's fine, but why refuse so adamantly to include the original theatrical versions for the purists? Is he just being a jerk? As for the Darth Vader ""Noooooo..."" atrocity, imagine watching ""Gone with the Wind"" and at the end Rhett Butler says, ""Frankly my dear, I don't really care."" Imagine watching the Wizard of Oz and having the whistle blow from tin man's dance CGI'ed out and replaced with a 3D fireball because hey, technology has improved. If you want to experiment with the new technology, make a new movie, you hack. Really disappointed. It arrived today and I'm not even going to take the plastic off so I can return it. I foolishly assumed a massive blu-ray release would include the theatrical releases I fell in love with, I guess I should've checked first. I'm starting to think he will have them released after his death or something. I don't see any logic in his decisions whatsoever so it must be some odd artistic thing like that.

7220533,5,B00YI71PN2,"I've been a Star Wars fan since just before the Special Edition was released in the theatres in 1997. When I saw the added material, I loved it. CGI dewbacks, CGI X-wings, a bigger more beautiful Mos Eisley, the new song and scenes during the ROTJ celebration...I pretty much loved it all. I can't say I would defend Jedi Rocks to my death, but I certainly don't despise it. As for the prequels, Episode I is easily the weakest and then II and III get progressively better, but even with the cheesy lines, sometimes bad acting and occasional odd plot points, I still love them all (besides, why hasn't anyone noticed these faults in the Originals? They're certainly there). The DVD releases just stream-lined the transition with the Prequels and, to me, made an overall more compelling story. I prefer Star Wars I-VI over the original trilogy by itself.

With that said, I respect people who don't like the changes, and I think Lucas really ought to release the originals on Blu Ray their sake, but for every single 1 star rating on here I must protest that they are exaggerating. This is most easily shown by the fact that most of them existed months prior to the Blu-Ray releases (why would Amazon do that anyway?).

So how do the Blu-Rays fare? The changes are hardly noticeable. Some were unnecessary and in fact I think they could have changed a lot more (I hate the toy-like X-wings in A New Hope). Otherwise, the film quality is AMAZING! A New Hope has never looked better. I've long felt weird about the movie due to the fact that it seems so dated compared even to Empire and Jedi. Vader's outfit didn't seem as black as in the others, and I could always notice that the lenses on his mask were red instead of black. In short, film quality is absolutely gorgeous. It's the best part. There are some good bonus features, but I've never been much of a fan really. Some of the documentaries are pretty good, but I can't imagine why they included the original 70's and 80's documentaries of the movies (ick) instead of the excellent documentaries found on the DVD collection. I also don't understand why some deleted scenes available on the prequel DVDs were omitted.

7220551,3,B00YI71PN2,"The big news on the home video front is the release of the six-episode STAR WARS saga in true high definition.  Long awaited by fans and collectors - after all, there are now two generations of potential buyers - this set offers many small changes George Lucas considers improvements, but there's not much that's really new here.  And that's true of the (mostly) retread of the bonus material.  The possible exception is the ""Conversation With The Masters"" feature on disc nine.  New extras, fillers of little substance, include the Star Wars Spoofs and the ""Star Warriors"" feature.

There's no question this iconic series has embedded itself in the cultural fabric of the late 20th Century and remains an enduring element of our sometimes-nebulous zeitgeist.  Initially released on May 25, 1977 as one segment in an imaginary cliffhanger series (done a la Saturday matinee style), the brilliance of the notion, the setting and the hero's quest struck a nerve among young - and older -- filmgoers worldwide.  Perhaps it was that seemingly endless opening shot of the battle cruiser as it entered the frame.  Whatever it was, we immediately knew we were in good hands and we eagerly suspended disbelief.  Everything about the production seemed new and yet familiar.  It had a vivid comic book pace and look, while also invoking a patina of spirituality.

But I sense a disturbance in the force.  Can you hear the screech of die-hard Lucasites?  Even though George Lucas has sought to smooth out and improve elements that have bothered him, these alterations, however small, are made in the prequel trilogy (Episodes I, II and III), those effects seem to ripple in the original trilogy (Episodes IV, V and VI) which follows.

It seems silly, but the original episodes have accrued a sacred status with many fans.  Kind of like embracing only the King James Version of the Bible.  But since George Lucas is creator and thus god of his cinematic and digital universe, he can do what he likes. Still, it's unsettling.  There's a feeling that the changes in the prequel somehow contaminate the original trilogy - when in normal chronological story telling, it's should be the other way around.

Some of the minor changes, however inconsequential, are quickly noticed by those of us who have seen the films countless times first as kids and now with our kids.  There's the insertion of a scene in ""A New Hope,"" where R2-D2 hides behind digitally rendered rocks, Obi-Wan Kenobi's altered dragon call (also in ""A New Hope"") and the blinking Ewoks in ""Return of the Jedi.""  I'm glad the Ewoks blink.  That blank stare really bothered me.  Seriously.  Now they seem alive and not so much little people in costumes.

Exactly how many versions of STAR WARS do we need?  Times are difficult, and it's hard not to feel exploited.  No doubt fans will buy the Blu-ray set (you can also buy the original trilogy in BD), but a persistent, pervasive element of greed sours the whole experience.

For the time being, I suggest enjoying Luke, Leia, Obi, Yoda, Han, Darth, Chewie, Boba, Jabba and the gang on whatever DVD version you have but on an up-convert player.  See it in near true hi-def but wait until the 3-D version comes out.  It's already in the pipeline.  And hey, who knows, rumor is it will be the first of the 3D home videos that can be experienced without those cumbersome glasses!  Now that would be worth the wait!

By then, I predict, Lucas will finish the set with Episodes VII, VIII and IX (in Holographic Surround D).  And the home versions will start all over again -- no doubt with a few tweaks here and there as Lucas, in his endless act of creation, searches for perfection.

7220563,1,B00YI71PN2,"I don't understand Lucas. I don't understand why his friends and employees were unable or unwilling to dissuade him from his insane folly. In spite of his incompetence as both writer and director, he managed to create the original Star Wars, a phenomenal success, and a really good movie, despite some flaws. Empire was better, in great part because he neither wrote nor directed it. As for Return of the Jedi, well, it wasn't as good, but it was still vastly better than any of his prequels.

So why did he make the ridiculous changes in the Special Edition in the first place?

Why did he make more horrible changes when he released the SE on DVD?

Why did he think, when viewers rightly mocked Vader's ""NOOOOOO"" at the end of Ep. III, that he ought to reprise it in RotJ in the Blu-ray release?

I could at least understand if he were only interested in updating visual effects. I can sympathize with his feeling that the old technology wasn't up to par with his imagination. But his CG often looks worse, and he simply doesn't have the artistic understanding or ability to merit our acceptance of the idiotic changes he made to the original trilogy, or the countless moronic choices he made in the prequel trilogy, chief among them being the decision to write the screenplays himself. He thinks its his right to change these movies. Maybe it is, in some sense, but then it's my right to become very angry with him and not buy them.

George Lucas is clearly interested in making money, and he's been very good at it. He wants to re-release all six movies theatrically, yet again, this time in 3D. No doubt money was on his mind when he decided to restore deleted footage and add lots of CGI for the Special Editions and their home releases. Those changes offer clear incentives for consumers to pay more money for something they've already seen. But one cannot say the same for having Greedo shoot first, or putting Hayden Christensen's stupid mug next the ghosts of Obi-Wan and Yoda.

7220583,5,B00YI71PN2,"Ok, first off... yes, I'm a fanboy, but I'm gonna try to be as objective as I can about this. Like many other folks here have said before, this is a review about the PRODUCT...not the MOVIES. I've been a Star Wars fan since I can remember, and like many people out there, I disagree with many of the changes done to these movies over the years, particularly Greedo shooting first (with now is pretty much Han and Greedo shooting at the same time) and the Jedi Rocks scene in ROTJ. Anyway, may people here seem to have rated this box set because  of the new changes (and of course because it does not include the unaltered movies). Honestly, none of the new changes bothers me to the point of ruining the movie experience. Sure, Vader yelling NOOO at the end of ROTJ feels a little weird now, but trust me, you'll get used to it over time. Same as we all did to Luke screaming as he falls down in TESB after losing his hand.... that scream that seemed to be the exact same scream used for the emperor in ROTJ...of course it was eventually removed, but yo know what I mean

That's not justifying the added NOOO to the scene. Personally I think it was better with no scream, but it's not that bad. Really. You gotta focus on both the positive things in this set as well as the negative. The PQ is absolutely amazing. TPM looks as if it was filmed this year. All movies look beautiful!!. There's plenty of bonus material. The artwork is really great. I remember many people complaining that the artwork in the dvd versions was just a crappy photoshop work (and I agree). But now we get this beautiful painting of both Anakin and Luke on Tatooine. I just love it....no to mention that the box itself is A LOT better than the thin box of the 2004 dvds. The menus were more fun on the dvds, but now they are more straightforward...no animation every time you click anything. The SQ is also amazing. I'm sorry I'm not very technical on this review but I can only give a regular consumer's point of view for this.

So, bottomline... I recommend this set to anyone who loves star wars. You won't regret it!... There are A LOT of great things in this set, and the ""bad"" things are jut minor stuff that won't ruin the experience at all!",1318723200,11,2224,4.341346153846154

7220586,5,B00YI71PN2,"Many have blasted this boxed set - well, the way some of the movies were not changed to suit them.  Get over it!

These are still some of the best movies ever done - period.  They have a story.  They have heroes and bad guys.  They have fast vehicles.  Dangerous situations.  Crashes.  And there is a moral to the tale.

So there are shortcomings - big deal.  Take the series in its entirety - not as six different movies.

I enjoy sitting down and slipping one of the dvd's in and relaxing - you should too.  Stop worrying about what Lucas is doing or not doing - see the movies for what they are.  Remember the glass is half full!  : )",1318723200,10,637,4.114754098360656

I never bought STAR WARS movies before, and the only one I saw was the first original one (IV episode), many years ago. Back then I considered it one of the worst movies I ever saw in my life.:-) Few weeks ago I decided to buy whole series on Blu-ray, in one package, and started to watch the movies with my kids. Wow! I like all of them! I really don't care if they are the originals or not, and why all these people complained about that, but I definitely recommend these Blu-rays. The image and the sound are amazing, and the special effects in the newest three episodes are not over-the-board (like in most movies these days) and all six of them are pretty uniform in playing, action scenes, music etc.

7220600,5,B00YI71PN2,"This 9 disc box set is definitely the ultimate series for all Star Wars addicts. If you do not buy the 9 disc box set there are no special features in the separate prequel and original trilogy boxes except 2 commentaries. These exact movies are available in this set in any case. The real drawcard though is the 3 bonus discs jam packed with special features and exclusive to the Complete Saga box set.

Using innovative menus you navigate through each each movies and go to specific planet locations, view interviews, deleted and extended scenes, the collection of vehicles and costumes, and concept art gallery for each film. The special features are the best I have seen when it comes to documentaries including original never released 70s doco Making of SW, plus SFX doco on Empire from 1980. The Jedi creatures doco is one that I have never seen and there are new docos too, plus a science tech doco and Empire 30 years later.

The 97 minutes of spoofs, satires and parodies is brilliant as you can laugh at all the satires of SW over the years in shows such as Robot Chicken, Simpsons, Family Guy, That 70s Show, Saturday Night Live, talk back shows, and heaps of others including fan films such as Troops.

The deleted scenes from original trilogy are great to observe and very rare till now, many of which are legendary such as Luke constructing his light saber, Tosche Station scenes, Wampa attack at Hoth headquarters and the sandstorm from Jedi.

The movies are all brilliant quality, and feature some added, rehashed scenes though not many. My conclusion is grab this if you are serious about Star Wars.",1318550400,7,1615,4.696113074204947

7220609,1,B00YI71PN2,"Oops, wrong movie, but the sentiment applies. Lucas needs to let his films go the same way Indy needed to let the Grail go. His unstoppable meddling is making them worse and worse. I hated the prequels and it seems all the new changes are doing is tying the old films to them but that's like tying yourself to a STD-riddled dead hooker. If George wants some films to change, he should be changing the ones that are widely considered terrible. Making Episodes I-III less stupid is certainly a lot harder than making the original saga more stupid but if he wants to impress...

I first appreciated certain changes Lucas wanted to make with the Special Editions... sure, clean that ugly blur out from under the land speeder and feel free to better define the 80's compositing, even add in a snake thing to the sarlaac to make it more interesting. These little changes were improvements in my eyes but they came with a horrendous looking Jabba the Hutt having a redundant conversation with Han, a very effeminate Jawa swinging from his brontosaur-elephant hybrid, a giggling little droid who gets smacked out of the air by a big bully droid, and a painful music video sequence with cartoonish characters screaming directly into the camera, pretty much breaking the delicate fourth wall.

These little annoyances ushered in the spirit of the prequels. They were there to appeal to kids, because apparently Lucas knows what kids like and he's decided that it is retarded, flamboyant creatures, cartoony CGIs, kindergarten dialogue, and mindless action. Also throw in a triple amputee catching fire and screaming in rage as his flesh melts off.

The new changes follow suit, including the disgusting Vader ""Noooooo"" and some horribly generated creature that looks like that creature who raced that stupid kid from ""Jingle All The Way"" in Episode I. Ahhh, yet another tie in to Lucas' miserable prequel films. Just stop old man. Let someone competent completely remake the prequels and restore the old films to their original loveable glory. The thing is, George, kids loved them as they were, why do you think they were such a success?",1318377600,11,2128,4.889196675900277
7220610,5,B00YI71PN2,"This is an excellent update for Blu-ray. There are problems with clay-face in the first couple films, but its only bad considering that George Lucas had millions at his disposal to polish these films for Blu-ray. It isn't so bad that it looks like some garage-made indie film. Everything else is great to flawless. The extras are extensive as well. 2 commentary tracks for every film, several fan-made films, etc. etc. Lastly, the packaging is great. The case is thick, hefty, sturdily-made and makes you feel like you're about to put something very special in that Blu-ray player.

Just ignore all the asinine fanboys riled up that George Lucas has made a handful of tiny tweaks. I was upset when Lucas made Greedo shoot first in 1997, and a lot of fanboys are trying to pretend that Lucas is doing the same thing again. He isn't.

7220614,3,B00YI71PN2,"This is not about the picture or the sound quality, and I'll be brief about the films and concentrate on the extras. Basically, I give the films an increasingly better grade as the saga progresses in story order: TPM C-, AC B-, RS B+, NH A, ESB and RJ A+. While Episode I is dragged down by a plethora of racist stereotypes, annoying fart humor, and using CGI as a crutch (tragically against Lucas' 1980s mantra of ""A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing; it is only a support""), Ep II is dragged down by the very atrocious acting and dialogue and complete lack of subtlety or sense in the Anakin / Padme love story. What keeps ""Sith"" from being A grade is the sheer weight of the legacy of the flaws of the other prequels, and of course, Vader wailing ""Noooo!"" Oh well, Lucas DID say he wanted to portray Vader as being a pathetic character. NH is untouchable, pristine classic SF/fantasy, and I like ESB and RJ the best. (Yes, even the Ewoks -- they're the perfect Vietnam parable / parody; it only got bad when the little furballs expanded into other stories.)

(Mini-rant: And, yes, Lucas has tweaked the classic trilogy yet again. I got tired of complaining about it long ago. In summary, some changes are actually good, some indifferent, and some truly terrible. If Lucas (or maybe someday, his successors and/or offspring) would just make it a policy to Always make the original versions avaliable in whatever new medium and re-release comes up, everyone from fans to film historians would be So Much Happier, and we'd all be able to just ignore Lucas' idiosyncratic changes.)

The artwork's interesting, although cardboard packaging for any digital media always makes me a little nervous. Sometimes those discs can be jammed in there tighter than R2's caked-on carbon scoring.

Each film has two commentaries -- the old DVD ones (the only carryovers, by the way), and a new one, compiled from many sources. Even so, there is a lot of overlap with the older commentaries and some of the interviews in the archive discs.

Archive Discs (7 & 8) -- Arranged by trilogy, then planet, then one of four categories of content:

Interviews -- generally okay, some more in-depth or revealing than others ; depends on who's talking. Do you really want to hear Rick McCallum do his usual fawning EPK schtick? Sometimes Lucas makes sense, sometimes he's, erm, debatable. It's usually the section ""overviews"" that are most interesting.

Concept Art Gallery -- for those of you who have some or lots of the ""art of"" and other ""behind/scenes"" books, anywhere from 50 to 85% of this stuff you've seen before. Easier and quicker to navigate than any of the other archive extras, so you'll be able to find the (for you) unseen droids.....artwork....you are looking for.

Amongst the previous and following category, one will sometimes find matte paintings with a really sweet art-to-screen comparison that shows you exactly where and how it works in the movie, wiping back and forth between painting and film.

360 Degree -- Basically a collection of models, costumes, creatures that you can get to rotate as you look at it. However, you cannot rotate some of the larger models, only pan from front to back. Each item has close-ups of selected areas. Many items have an always welcome, very interesting video commentary, some as long as near 15 minutes.
For those who care, the Boba Fett armor in the Episode V section (Pursuit) has a link to the infamous Nelvana animated short that introduced the character in the even more infamous SW Holiday Special of 1978.

Deleted Scenes -- probably one of the most talked-about selling points. Unfortunately, for the prequels, none of the fascinating Del. Sc.s from the prequel DVDs were carried over. What we get on the Blu-Ray are sheer leftovers. (Episode II's C3PO 360 Degree documentary has some intriguing glimpses) So, none of that tantalizing Owen and Beru footage from Episode II that appears in bits on the 2000 VHS of the SE Trilogy. For the prequel trilogy, pretty much the only good del. sc.s are the animatics for sequences for ""Revenge/Sith"", with ideas ranging from the farcical to the near sublime.
Of course, the real meat of the deleted scenes are those for the classic trilogy on disc 8; life-long fans who have been hearing about, and reading the novelizations and comic adaptations, and seeing ultra-rare photos will finally be able to see and watch a lot of that rarefied material. (No ""Empire"" bits of Luke having his surgical face mask removed nor any Lando struggling to get Luke onto the Falcon, though). With 24 DS from throughout the trilogy, it's still a pretty thorough selection, from Biggs to Wampas to Jedi's alternate opening and more Jerjerrod and Royal Guard action.

On the bottom left, there's a nice, short thing called the ""Archive Fly-By,"" a loving 4+ minute peek into Skywalker Ranch's repository for SW artifacts (and the Ark of the Covenant's burned crate, too)

The documentaries on disc nine are a mixed bunch. There are the three classic behind/scenes documentaries that came out with each of the classic trilogy films. Too bad ""From SW to Jedi"" isn't here, known for its Declan Mulholland/Jabba footage from ANH.
1997's ""Anatomy of a Dewback"" is basically a 30 minute ad for the SE, although the patient viewer can glimpse more the Lucasfilm Archives.
SW Tech is a rather goofy, corny, sometimes near grade-school look at the science of various Star Wars gadgets, creatures, and concepts, and real-life counterparts and developments. Too bad the History (yech) Channel's much better and more illuminating documentary on Star Wars compared with history and mythology isn't here.
ESB 30 years later doesn't really cover any new ground, so it's thankfully brief; includes some of Irvin Kershner's final interviews (see also Roger Nygaard's ""Nature of Existence"" series for more fun with Kershner.)
Star Warriors is a cute and fun tribute of the 501st costuming group, and their appearance at the 2007 Rose Bowl parade. Although it's definitely biased (there IS also a Rebel costuming group, you know), it's still well done, heartfelt, and funny.
Finally, there is a 97 minute collection of Star Wars spoofs, which is inevitably uneven. Some of it's redundant for those who have the Robot Chicken SW DVDs (about 5 of their best ones are here). Some of it is classic internet or advertising fare of varying degrees of hilarity or stupidity. A little of it is 70s material (sorry, no ""Hardware Wars"") that is usually more disturbing than funny. Some of it is well-known, some is more rare and esoteric. I'd think that anyone with a healthy sense of humor would probably get a laugh or a smile out of at least half of the material here.",1318377600,9,6728,4.846823324630114
7220615,5,B00YI71PN2,"We are looking for the films we saw from 1977 through 1983.  We're tired of George Lucas changing the films on an apparent whim.  We want ALL the extras (including the ones from the DVDs and, most importantly, ""From Star Wars to Jedi"") included with this set.

And just so you know I'm not being a snob, I do hold degrees in film history and creative writing.  Let me tell you, it's a tough business.

Now, back to the frustration of this BD set:  These are all valid, inarguable, and absolutely true concerns.

But, you're all wrong.

Here's the thing:

1.  I think what we REALLY want is to feel the way we did when we were kids and saw ""Star Wars"" for the first time.  Obviously, that experience is never going to happen.  We're older.  A lot older.  And the mere fact of our maturity is going to alter our point-of-view (no, I'm not quoting Obi-Wan).

2.  For the most part, none of use has several hundred million dollars just sitting around to invest in the production of a motion picture.  George Lucas took a BIG gamble on the the first film, and he won.  He won.  He defeated 20th Century Fox and that's amazing.  This is HIS story.  True, as the audience we play a pivotal role in that story, but we didn't pick a fight with a major motion picture company.  When I get enough money, I'll tell my story, but I can't argue with marketing and capitalism as they are the foundation of American Culture (remember, we're a capitalistic republic, not a democracy).  In many ways, the fiscal and materialistic motives of our society are part of what Lucas is trying to discuss in these films.

3.  I'm almost done.  Stop whining.  Stop.  Yes, you.  I mean it.  Stop.  These films will live FAR longer than any of us, and I find comfort in that fact.  No matter how much one complains, nitpicks, or criticizes, they are very good films.  Great films even.

Directors have been changing and re-releasing films since 1895.  One example:  ""The Phantom of the Opera"" (1925).  Two versions emerged within 24 months of each other with changes by the film's director.  Each version is worth seeing and no one complains about it.

For my part, I'm in awe of how dedicted Lucas is to his story.  He spends a lot of time, effort and, yes, money to get it right.  Like Roger Ebert, I believe films are now what they are about, but how they are about.  Knowing my great-grandchildren will be enjoying these films in a near seamless narrative is really, really exciting.

And that lightsaber duel with Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul is pretty awesome too.",1318377600,13,2544,4.4868421052631575

Video quality was exceptional and it was technically great.  Even the sound was stunning with the walkers in episode 5 and 6.  Technically a great blu ray but the re-editing leave a lot to desire.  Extra were better then expected.  Wish George Lucas would have left it alone.  My kids never saw the original episode 4 since Lucas messed with the early 90s release.,1318377600,7,525,4.619565217391305
7220618,4,B00YI71PN2,"Overall, this set looks very good.  The best Star Wars has ever looked.  There are a few places where a new transfer using the most current technology would have improved the set and it is a little disappointing that they didn't do this.  I have to assume the cost of re-working the newly added CGI to an all new transfer and restoration of the original source material was prohibitive (i.e. there weren't enough people who cared by withholding their wallets to make it worthwhile). I must admit that with the (mostly) great looking picture and the excellent uncompressed audio, I did feel for a moment like a kid watching this for the first time again.  Even the prequels, possibly since they can be watched in a more relaxed manner free from the weight of their original anticipation, seemed to work much better for me.  Not perfect but well worth buying.",1318377600,5,857,4.6866666666666665

7220621,3,B00YI71PN2,"I bought my blu-ray player just before Christmas 2010, and Star Wars was the first movie(s) I wanted to get. So I wasn't too happy that I had to wait nearly a year to get them. I don't live, eat and breathe Star Wars, so I didn't have a count down timer going, or going to be insanely picky like the light saber is going to be white in the middle. However, I am fairly disappointed.

I don't have a $3,000 entertainment system. While this information is relative, it may help some. When I am watching TV, I have the volume in the 5-9 range. For DVD/Blu-Rays, I generally bump it up to 12-15. For Episode I, I bumped it to 30, and still missed about 25% of what was said. Episode II had to bump up to 22-23, but missed some words if the actor was farther back on the scene. Episodes III & IV, was normal, 14-16.

Loading screens:
Episode I: No loading screen, it hangs for ~5+ minutes
Episode II & IV: has a loading screen (R2D2), loads in 2-3 minutes.
Episode III: No loading screen, but loaded in a minute or less.

I haven't watched V & VI yet, so I cannot report on those. Maybe I got a few bad discs, I cannot tell.",1318291200,4,1119,4.100456621004566

There are three excellent additional content BDs, with deleted scenes from all six films as well as a compilation of all the major documentaries released over the years.

7220630,4,B00YI71PN2,"Okay so there's a lot of good here, with some very annoying bad. I'd say it is definitely worth a purchase, especially if you consider yourself a pretty fervent Star Wars fan like myself.

Pros:
- Incredible video quality. The films have never ever looked better, even when compared to the hi-def versions that have been airing on television as of late. They weren't lying when they said that you would see a lot more of every frame -- I've noticed little background details that I've never come across before in my life. Exceptional stuff.
- Sound is fantastic, THX went through and recorded a brand new audio track for like the 15th time and it really shines in surround.
- The deleted scenes, in my honest opinion, are worth the $80 alone. Come on people! This is stuff we've only dreamed about having up until now.
- The rest of the special features are pretty solid, would have loved to have seen rarer or more brand new documentaries, but the 'collection' stuff is fantastic.
- Just knowing that you have the veritable 'Complete Star Wars Saga' in your possession. My eight-year-old self would be flipping out.

Cons:
- The latest additions. I have a feeling that they'll grow on me a bit, like the '97 and '04 additions, but for now they stick out like a gross sore thumb. [Noooo!!!]
- Again, I can't help but feel like there was a missed opportunity on the last special features disc ... the random sw-inspired clips from TV felt a bit unnecessary.
- The packaging is just ab-so-lutely god awful. Terrible water colored paintings in some dumb book setup. Han with Ewoks... Boba riding that weird dinosaur from Ep. 3... that horribly assembled collage of characters? WTF?! It blows my mind that this stuff got approved. I'd probably pay another $80 to have a better case to put my discs in. :/

Final Thoughts: Loathe it for the oft-terrible prequels, superfluous additions, and shockingly horrendous packaging. Love it for the original trilogy looking and sounding so magnificent, a handful of fantastic special features, and the holy grail that is the deleted scenes.

7220631,5,B00YI71PN2,"There are already way too many reviews of this so I'll be short. I am of an age where the Star Wars films were pretty impressive. I remember taking my son (he was about 9 or 10 then and is now 40 something) and standing in line (with geeks in costumes) for 4 hours to get in! Now these same geeks (or their offspring although I have a hard time imagining them reproducing) are posting 1 star reviews because George Lucas had the effrontery to change a single line in the originals. These are, in my imagination, guys who still live at home and have a life size cut out of Princess Leia (where do you get those anyway? I'd love to have one) next to their bed.

Look, Lucas made some adjustments I wouldn't have, but it's his film and he can do whatever he wants.

What I wanted was a clean transfer to Blu Ray and interesting special features and that is what I got. Go ahead and buy this and unless you are one of those geeks you'll really enjoy it.",1318204800,10,949,4.1521739130434785

Absolutely fantastic picture quality for these classic movies.
If you started with Beta/VHS tapes and moved on to DVD, you'll know what I mean. The purchase of this collection is the next best thing to being there.  The only thing that can beat the quality of these movies are possibly 3D Blu-ray or other technology that hasn't been invented yet.

I think Lucas did a fine job with remastering the originals (4, 5, and 6 espicially) and that the changes don't bother me at all.

Yes, it would have been nice to be offered the originals with no changes as an option, but the changes that were applied don't damage or detract from the movies at all.

7220636,1,B00YI71PN2,"I really wanted to like this, but I just can't get over the color issues in the Original Trilogy. I don't understand why they would spend all the money and effort to release these in HD yet still get the color so wrong. The Death Star interior isn't grey anymore, Hoth is now blue rather than white, and Vader's lightsaber is still PINK throughout the trilogy as in the DVDs. On top of this you still have plenty of matt lines, ghosting, jump cuts, and a ton of garbage matts interspersed with cheesy 1990's special effects, most of which have not stood the test of time nor an upscale to 1080. Either leave the movie alone or do it right, pick one! The whole thing is just a convoluted mess.

I simply do not understand why they would spend all this money on these various changes only to leave so many SFX issues, old and newly created. They fixed a few shots of Vader's lightsaber from the DVDs, changing it back to red in a couple close ups, but 90% of the time, it is still pink. Unless Darth Vader having a pink lightsaber was part of Lucas's ""Original Vision"" this is just an incredibly shoddy restoration.

The Prequel Trilogy looks great, but I don't think anyone watches those, so it doesn't save this set.",1318118400,17,1216,4.4
7220637,2,B00YI71PN2,"I preordered this as soon as it was available and after getting it, I really wish I hadn't.

Pros: The picture and sound quality are amazing for all the movies, especially the prequels.  The new yoda in Episode I was a great improvement over the cheap looking puppet in the original.

Cons:The original trilogies were a huge disappointment.  They didn't fix any of the lightsaber coloring as rumors were saying, Luke's saber in A New Hope was still grainy just as an example.  The new Krayt Dragon yell Obi-Wan made was horrible.  It was almost like female tennis player's grunt as she hits the ball.  There weren't a lot of new things in Empire, except for maybe some different camera angles in some shots.  Return of the Jedi was ruined for me even more.  It's still the special edition that should have never been plus even more additions that should have never been.  The biggest would be the now infamous ""NO...  NOOOOOOOOO!""  They changed some camera angles in the final saber fight and during the scene with Jabba's barge that kind of made it weird to watch.  I've only seen the blu-rays once and probably won't watch them again unless it's a prequel.  I still need to see the bonus footage so I'll update once I do that.

Lucas needs to put his creativity to the backburner and re-release the original trilogy as a cleaned up version without the ""special edition"" junk.

As my title says, buy the prequels on blu-ray and try and get the originals on laser disc (only way to get the actual originals in the best quality available) unless you want all the bonus material.",1318118400,16,1577,4.598566308243727

In episode IV, they should have fixed luke's saber better when he was on the falcon and fix the obi-won saber when he was facing darth vader. Same thing for Episode V.

Yes changes were made and yes not all of them were needed in the eye of the public, yes a digital copy should have been included, yes the original version should be there for those not wanting the updated versions. all those points aside, they looked and sounded great. one thing i think many people couldn't and cant get their heads around with star wars is the fact that it was and is created for children.... sorry that's what lucas said, and unlike some other long going shows star wars didn't really mature until episode 3 with the audience, at least not to the extent of harry potter or something along those lines. also people seem to easily forget all the great things that star wars has done for the movie industry. half of the great cgi and sound we have in movies is due to star wars.... if not more than that.... so for me star wars has always been about pushing boundaries and innovation forward, sometimes at the cost of a mistake or two but the fact that they do it means it will help everything in the long run. star wars is my childhood and i will always believe that i can move items with my mind if i try hard enough :D

Please keep in mind that I do have an HD LED tv, and a Dolby 5.1 surround sound system. But the audio is remixed, the video unbelievably crisp, and the added/lengthened scenes rock. I can't possibly see how anyone that claims to be a fan of Star Wars would be critical of this. You can be cynical and try to be a ""purist,"" but why?

This will stay in a drawer somewhere and go down as a waste of money.  I won't even bother to watch V & VI (Noooooooooo).  I-III are made for TV junk anyway.  Hayden Christenson was horrible to start but gets worse every time you see it again.  Those 3 are were ruined beyond repair the moment Lucas decided to direct them.

7220649,5,B00YI71PN2,"I don't have much words to spill on the matter, other than that George Lucas has stated that he would continue to work on his space saga, and has done so several times.
He trimmed them when he released the 1997 Special Editions, and made further changes to releases in 2001, 2004 and 2006. With the new Blu-Ray format, he once again made changes, which he, again, predicted. He clearly stated he would make another batch of changes with the creation of the next film format (which turned out to be Blu-Ray).

Whether or not he will one day realize that the best-selling Blu-Ray item of all time could be surpassed only by the Original Theatrical Edition, which he would of course have to release himself as well, remains to be seen. I'm not losing any sleep over it.

Everyone knows that the internet has alternatives to offer. They offered me the theatrical set. I already bought the 2004 dvd set, and now the Complete Saga Blu-Ray set as well.
I have what I need, and so does George Lucas.
Time to face the facts. He will very likely not release the Original Trilogy. If he does, it will probably quadruple his millionaire stature overnight. If he doesn't, tough break.

He was so excited when he saw the set and pop in episode 6 right away (not sure why he picked 6 but I was ok with that). He sat right next to me as we watched the movie. Watching him brought back many childhood memories and how I felt watching these films. I am really glad that I can experience these films again with and through him.

For the content itself: The picture is breathtaking and I am noticing thing in the films that I never saw before. Maybe it's because I've seen them so many times before that my eyes are wondering but there is so much more to see in HD. The sound is also incredible and I only have a 5.1 system. I also, like all of the changes they made to the films, I think that it helps blend the series together and make it a unified story. A lot of people on here are Star Wars purist and only want to own the original version of the films. I think that Lucas should release the originals for those people but remember the originals were not in HD. So, IMO, changing the picture quality is also changing the original film.

UPDATE: JUST RECENTLY HAD THE OPPERTUNITY TO HEAR THE SOUND QUALITY ON MY TUNER. ALL I CAN SAY IS IF YOU CAN SET IT UP THE SOUND THIS WAY, YOU WILL FEEL LIKE YOU ARE THERE. THIS IS TOTALY AWESOME!!!! I HAD TO TURN THE SOUND DOWN AT TIME DUE TO WHERE I LIVE. (US ARMY OVERSEAS AT PRESNT) BUT WOW!!! IM VERY MUCH BLOWN AWAY. THANK YOU AGAIN AMAZON FOR THE BEST DEAL THAT I HAVE EXPERENCED. LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE GREAT DEALS.",1317859200,8,958,4.015706806282722

If you love Star War and a die hard fan this is a must have and also to support George to make other one with 3D and fixed the some CGI.
I own all the formats of Star Wars VHS, VCD, LD, DVD and now the Blu-ray set which is great with very detailed picture quality which looks 100+ time sharper. I love the extras too.
The audio is much better with my new 7.1 amp.
I was sick of the DVD quality on my big HD screen.
With the HD CGI rendering, there were some bad scene with the CG + live footage which did not match that well, apart from that over all I am very happy with this Blu-ray set.
I did not give a 5 star because this format dose not have 3D and audio is not 7.1.
I cant wait for the UltraHD format when it comes out or if it comes out.",1317772800,4,801,3.7455621301775146

Also, Obi-Wan's call to the Sand People in Episode 4 has been ruined. I didn't think these changes would bother me; but they really do. All I can say is no wonder Lucas is so rich; I never thought I would need to buy a copy of the original, unadulterated Episode 4-6, but if they are ever cleaned-up and re-released, I will definitely have to get them. Lucas has finally made just enough changes for me to really look forward to forking-out more money for this movie one last time. But one last time only...ya hear me, George?

They are absolutely beautiful, the original moves hold up really well to the blue-ray transfer, that's what I was really hoping for, if  the blue-ray format would bring out more clearity to the original films, and it did, 100%.  The delivery service for these films was also fantastic, I ordered it on the 1st, and recieved it 3 days later, and I had Free Super Savers discount too, two thumbs way up, definitely recommend, ignore the bad reviews, and buy this.",1317772800,4,783,4.961832061068702

I know some people are disappointed in some of the things that were added to the original trilogy, but not me, I love it.  I'm glad Lucas added something extra to this release, it then makes me feel like I am not paying for the same movies again with no added benefit.  All six movies look stunning and sound amazing.  I am so happy with this release, probably the best thing I bought all year.  For those who are whining about some of the very subtle changes, it may be time to get a girlfriend so you can enjoy other things in life such as arguing.",1317772800,11,622,4.237288135593221

I would rather watch this version then the old versions. I know, I know i'm crazy right? Well I really feel that I could put up with Han shooting second for 99.5% of the original movies in blu-ray quality. Oh also if your (Mr. Lucas) going to change things like the whole Han, Guido scene then at least make it look legit. It looks like a high school kid spent and hour using premier pro on it and it was his first project ever. Also when Han walks over Jabba's tale, c'mon that looks horrible! You would think with all of the money that these movies have made over the years that we could get some CGI that doesn't suck! I also liked that originally Jabba wasn't in the first movie, only spoke of. It made him more of a mystery. Then when you first saw him you were shocked. And the ""Nooooo!"" at the end ended up making a deep scene into a very corny scene. But my rant is over. I still say get them.

7220667,1,B00YI71PN2,"I get that they are George Lucas' movies and I suppose he can do whatever he wants with them....but why? Why change the classics? Does George Lucas go through his parents' scrapbooks and alter his childhood drawing because he can do a better job now? The old movies were the pinnacle of special effects for their time...don't go back and change them every few years to try to make them look like the freaking Matrix. My personal opinion is that despite all the advances in CGI, the CGI looks a lot more like I'm watching a cartoon and the old carefully created models used in the original trilogy looked far more realistic than the stuff in the prequals. If there is such a need to go back and fix things in the movies...why not fix the ridiculous dialogue in Attack of the Clones? Why not get a professional writer(or hey..any High School drama student) to rewrite the interactions between Padme and Anakin?

My bottom line is this...I don't care if George Lucas re-releases and changes the movies every 6 months until he dies.....I just want there to be an unaltered Bluray release as well. I'm sure there will be one eventually because there is certainly a demand for it, but until there is one I will not watch or buy this Bluray release. When the unaltered classics are available, I will watch them and this current release and update my ratings.

7220669,5,B00YI71PN2,"I'm a first-generation Star Wars fan since 1977, having seen the original versions of the original three films in the theater one time each as a child, then falling in love with them all over again on VHS in 1987. And I've been a huge fan ever since. The Star Wars Saga is the ultimate epic space opera and film series.

This isn't actually a review of the movies most of you reading this will have seen one or more versions of dozens of times (well, at least the classic trilogy), although this review will discuss some of the changes made (and not made) to all the films. This is meant to be an overview of the 9-disc 2011 blu-ray product entitled ""Star Wars: The Complete Saga"" with personal observations and select commentary thrown in.

PHYSICAL QUALITIES

Disc & Packaging Structure

The discs themselves are heavy-duty, yet smooth and well-coated with scratch resistance - the best available in retail products I've seen. The packaging is also of superior physical construction, taking the form of a hardback book with 9 sturdy pages (think baby/toddler cardboard book stiffness), and the book has an outer box it slides in and out of. The disc-book is about a centimeter shorter than a standard DVD case and slightly wider. Each right-side page is half-circle open in the middle, forming a sleeve with a super-smoothly-coated insides for the optimum protection for both storing and removing/returning the discs. The inside back cover has a more traditional sleeve for the set's single information booklet called ""Guide to the Galaxy"" which mostly details the special features on the bonus discs. For those of you with ""green"" consciousness, there is not a single sliver of hard plastic anywhere in the box/book - the only plastic in the entire product is in the discs themselves and I suspect the very thin, soft coating of the inner disc sleeves. I couldn't really have even imagined higher-quality discs and a better-constructed storage for my Star Wars blu-ray set. I'm very pleased with this aspect of it.

Disc & Packaging Appearance

Of lesser concern for me is the appearance of the product's physical components, but for sake of completeness, I'll mention it. The discs themselves do not have any images - they are light grey with blue trimmings. The movie discs (1-6) have the previously used logos of STAR WARS with the episode subtitle underneath, both on top of the episode number in the form of a large Roman numeral. The outer box and disc-book do not have a single photo - it is entirely original artwork. The info booklet has the single photo of the entire product (the Falcon flying through Death Star II), and more artwork. In my opinion, the artwork almost totally sucks. It's awful! The spine, front and back covers of the disc-book exactly match the box, which is also used for the cover of the info-booklet. The disc-book has 10 two-page images (minus half-a-disc-sized portion for the disc on the right-page of the 9 pages). The only tolerable movie disc image is for Episode II, but that is because the characters are more distant and the image has the most photo-realism to it. The only art I really like in the entire product is a small picture of Luke on a Taun Taun in the info booklet, and the disc book picture for Bonus Disc 1 (certainly by a different, better artist), although it depicts something that does not occur in the films or even deleted scenes: Boba Fett is riding a lizard mount like Obi-Wan rode on Utapau in Episode III. I think that picture may be a nod to the animated sequence of the old Star Wars Holiday Special in which Boba Fett rides a creature of some kind, IIRC.

I am somewhat disappointed that they didn't just use photographic imagery throughout this entire product like some of the other releases because that would have been more attractive. Or they could have at least just gotten a better artist for the art throughout the entire product! But like I said, more important than the product's appearance to me is the structural qualities of the discs and packaging, and of course the digital disc content.

THE BONUS DISCS

The films are much more important than anything else, but for completeness I'll touch on the special features discs.

Bonus Discs 1 & 2

Bonus Disc 1 is devoted to the prequels while Disc 2 is for the classic trilogy. Bonus Discs 1 & 2 have archive cast & crew interviews, 360 turnaround galleries for props and costumes, art galleries, and a total of 45 deleted/extended scenes exclusive to this release. I've watched all the deleted/extended scenes for all 6 films, and the most interesting ones to me were for Return of the Jedi, especially the Battle of Endor stuff. But there was nothing that I thought really shouldn't have been cut from the films.

I've read some complaints about the menu organization of these first two bonus discs. First you choose the movie you want to access the features for, and then within each episode choice the features are divided up by planets/settings (Naboo, Tatooine and Coruscant for Episode I; Tatooine, Aboard the Death Star, and The Battle of Yavin for Episode IV; etc.). So when I went through to watch all deleted/extended scenes, I had to keep going up and down an extra menu level to get to the scenes for the next setting, and then up and down two level menu levels to move on to the next film. It is a little wacky but really just a minor inconvenience if you want to only view one specific type of feature for 1 or all 3 films on each disc. If you want to watch everything in one setting of one film at a time, then the menu tree is set up specifically for maximum convenience in that case.

And I just remembered that I read somewhere that Bonus Disc 2 has the animated sequence of the Star Wars Holiday Special. It is not listed as a special feature on the info booklet, but if you navigate through a certain menu you'll supposedly find it.

Bonus Disc 3

Bonus Disc 3 has documentaries not available on the Star Wars DVDs. As a whole they cover the entire saga, but the main focus is on the classic trilogy. They are not nearly as important to me as they are to a lot of fans I know, but I can speak on a few of them. I'm sure I was totally enthralled by The Making of Star Wars (1977) on TV when I was a kid, and someday when I'm feeling nostalgic for my childhood I'll probably watch that again. I used to have Classic Creatures (1983 - hosted by Carrie Fisher and Billy Dee Williams) on VHS, and it is interesting if you want a behind-the-scenes look at the aliens from Return of the Jedi, including the operation of the 6-man Jabba muppet. I had taped the excellent Star Wars Tech (2007) onto a blank VHS, so it's cool that I now have it in a digital format, but it's disappointing that this disc didn't include History Channel's also excellent Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed (so I`ll have to keep that tape).

The only documentary that I've watched on this blu-ray so far is the new Star Wars Spoofs (2011), a 97-minute compilation of Star Wars spoofs and parodies from 1977 to the present. There are entire short skits (like the classic 1977 SNL Star Wars Lounge Singer Bill Murray, and the hilarious Natalie Portman SNL monologue). There are a multitude of clips from various TV episodes and movies (The Simpsons, Family Guy, That 70's Show, Robot Chicken, Fanboys, etc.). They even had Weird All Yankovic's ""The Saga Begins"" music video. There is some great stuff and not-so-great stuff. There is so much there but a few things missing that should be there. The down side of this feature is, there isn't a chapter division for each individual clip so if you want to skip the one your on or repeat one, you'll jump father away or have to scan ahead or back - a minor inconvenience. It's a long feature that I watched at night and I started getting sleepy by the end, so you may not want to watch it all in one setting like I did. Being a blu-ray, you can bookmark it anywhere though.)

THE FILM DISCS

This is as good a place as any to mention that there are two audio commentary tracks for each of the films of blu-ray. There are the same ones from the previous DVD versions of these films, and then new commentaries compiled from ""archival interviews with cast and crew"". For the classic trilogy, I would expect that the word ""archival"" to mean pre-1997, which should be a real treat for all the purists. I don't enjoy listening to commentaries while watching adventure films, but I will force myself to listen to the new tracks once (as I did for the original DVD commentaries).

As I have only had one frame of reference for viewing the blu-ray films, I thought I should first specify what that is, in case my experiences are in any way relative to my equipment and viewing conditions. This may mean more to you than it does to me. My blu-ray player is a Sony BDP-S350. My HD TV is a Sony Bravia KDL-40V4100, a flat-screen LCD with a diagonal of a little over a meter. My blu-ray player and TV are both almost 3 years old. My line of vision is exactly 90 to the plane of the TV screen, and my eyes and ears are at a height equal to about 1/3 up from the bottom edge of the screen. I'm sitting such that the distance of my head to the TV screen is a little more than the width of the Death Star's thermal exhaust port.

The Films on Blu-ray

All six films sound and look awesome in HD! Even Revenge of the Sith, which had the least room for improvement, is substantially better. I fully appreciate all the pain-staking effort that had to go into improving the resolution of over 12 hours of high-quality sci-fi entertainment, frame-by-frame. Coruscant from space is breathtakingly gorgeous. The Millennium Falcon is amazingly detailed, with all of it's charming dents and carbon-scoring. The Death Stars seem even bigger and more epic due to the incredible level of detail now visible. I could go on and on, but you're really just going to have to see it for yourself.

There is one significant exception in the HD upgrade. A very logical and fitting artistic choice was made in the rendering of the holograms of characters. Throughout the all six movies, it looks like the holograms were not upgraded to HD, now looking somewhat pixilated compared to the surrounding ""reality"" they are projected into. This of course is easily explained in-universe as they are just not high-resolution transmissions, and I feel this actually works to improve the illusion of the entire scene seeming real. The holograms are now an intentional vestige of the analogue age, left behind to honor the origin and evolution of the Star Wars films themselves which began as motion picture projections but have now become the ultra-realistic-looking digital media. A very nice touch. And the hologram effects also seems more unified between the two trilogies now.

A significant improvement that the HD upgrade also provides is a solution to a common criticism I have ran into since 1997. Over the years I have heard many Star Wars fans express that the addition of GC characters and objects into the films seems unrealistic, in not only the updated versions of the classic trilogy but even the prequels. Ironically, these fans seem to have no trouble accepting the un-reality of rubber muppet characters, but CG is somehow unacceptable in their vision of the Star Wars universe. Well, now muppets, rubber masks, human actors and CG characters can all exist in visual harmony together, thanks to the wonders of HD. The increase in resolution seems to have unified the apparent realities of them all. Now the real-world elements of the scenes have been ""raised"" to the same level of visual reality of the CG elements, resulting in the CG elements seeming to much more naturally blend in with their surroundings. This is more apparent in the classic films, but applies to the prequels as well. This adds in a whole new level of visual realism to the films, perhaps being the greatest achievement of these new blu-ray versions of the films.

Now I'll go into more detail about some of the blu-ray enhancements and changes specific to each film.

Episode I: The Phantom Menace

The effect for the Jedi Knights speeding away from the droidekas on the Trade Federation ship has been improved. The original effects error of the two-headed pod race announcer's hand passing through his vest was fixed.

The big change that even the die hard purists don't seem to mind so much is the complete and utter removal of that awful imitation Yoda muppet. The TPM muppet bore a vague resemblance to the original muppet from the sequels, but I thought that the TMP muppet could at most pass for Yoda's crazy spice-addicted brother. I know some fans that feel the CG Yoda model from AotC and RotS was not as good as the original muppet, but even they would agree that the prequel CG model looks a lot more like the original muppet than the TMP muppet did. And in blu-ray the CG Yoda in all 3 prequels looks more realistic now, so I'm very happy with this change.

Episodes II & III (Attack of the Clones & Revenge of the Sith)

These mostly only had minute editorial tweaks like the exact transition between scenes, moving a couple reaction shots and dialogue lines to a slightly different part of a scene. The only really somewhat significant change is adding a line of dialogue in AotC where Anakin is having a nightmare about his mother while staying on Naboo. Shmi Skywalker's voice is now heard pleading for Anakin's help with the echo effect (signifying it is a thought or dream in Anakin's mind). It does accomplish the addition of a little more urgency to the drama of the film.

The Classic Trilogy

Above, I mentioned how great the Death Stars and the Falcon look. The asteroid field effects are improved all the way around, and Cloud City looks fantastic. The upgrade to high definition is more noticeable in the original trilogy and thus strikes me as even more stunning overall. For the most part, the lightsaber effects are improved and match the prequel effects.

However, there are some aspects of some scenes that you can only do so much with without completely new effects. The squares around the ships flying in front of outer space are no longer visible, but ships flying in front a capital ship still sometimes show a barely noticeable amount of distortion surrounding the smaller ship. The snowspeeder cockpits viewed from the pilot's point of view are now completely opaque against the Hoth landscape, but you can still just barely see the moon of Endor through Han's head and the cockpit of the shuttle Tyderium. And some distance backgrounds that were previously just out-of-focus in the original camerawork are now just understandably flat-out blurry in HD.

Episode IV: A New Hope

Obi-Wan's simulated Krayt Dragon roar (to scare off the Tusken Raiders that had attacked Luke) has been changed yet again. While I don't understand Lucas' need to change it, I also don't understand the big uproar this insignificant alteration to the film has caused among fans. A live Krayt Dragon is never seen onscreen anywhere in the film saga. Who's to say what a fictional off-screen animal should sound like? I would think Lucas is the only one that would even care. I certainly don't give a damn what the dragon is supposed to sound like. The fictional simulation of a never-seen creature's roar only has to convince the fictional Sand People, not us. You may not like a particular sound effect, but I think the harsh criticisms I have read about this (for any version of the roar) for something so inconsequential are ridiculous.

Rocks have been added near the opening of the little cave that R2 is hiding in when Obi-Wan shows up, and the negative criticisms to this are completely unfounded. It has been spread throughout the internet that the rocks inexplicably ""disappear"" when R2 is later shown wheeling towards Obi-Wan and Luke, but the purists that have stated this are totally misinterpreting the scene. When R2 is coming out of hiding, the shot is from a different angle than the previous view into the cave, and the rocks that had been added to the previous shot would be behind R2 who is obscuring the mouth of the cave. So how are you supposed to see the added rocks through R2? There is no discontinuity caused by the added rocks, and I suspect that some purists are misreporting things in an attempt to fuel the fire of their hatred of Lucas and all changes in general.

I mean, there nothing wrong with not liking the new rocks, but it is incorrect to misrepresent the continuity of the film. I don't really like the added rocks but I don't dislike them either, because it really has no impact on the scene, just like the variations of Obi-Wan's dragon roars. The details of these two changes are just go in my ""Whatever, George"" file and are then given no more attention. And some people say Lucas is all OCD about Star Wars!

The scene where Luke first turns on his father's lightsaber has been edited more tightly to better conceal the disjointedness that occurred from the original editing of two different takes together to appear as one continuous live action. I'm pleased with that minor but needed improvement.

And now Han and Greedo shoot at virtually the same time.

The Sequels

While holograms have been left in a lower resolution, the Force Ghosts have been fully upgraded to HD further differentiating between the two effects. Both sequels overall look great, but almost all the changes were made to RotJ. For the purist muppet-lovers out there, rest easy. Yoda and Jabba the Hutt remain the original muppets they've always been in the sequels, but even the muppets look better in HD. And I'll throw in here that contrary to false rumors, Sebastian Shaw's portrayal of Anakin de-masked remains unchanged from the previous version of the film (besides the upgrade of it to HD).

Episode VI: Return of the Jedi

The static shot of the droids moving up to the blast door to Jabba's palace is now slightly expanded into a wide pan-in to the droids starting with a larger door. It adds heightened impression of scale to the beginning of this space opera adventure - a nice touch.

The ""thawing out"" of Han has been slightly altered so the carbonite seems more like it's ""melting"" away, an improvement to the original effect.

A Dug (the species of Sebulba in TPM) is added walking in an empty space in one shot in the palace (not a close-up), and some people say it looks fake. I think it looks better than a lot of the rubber aliens in the palace, and I like it how the Dug adds a little more visual continuity between the two trilogies.

A few shots of Ewoks show them blinking, and a couple close-ups of Wicket show the details of his eyes, making Ewoks seem more like real animal life-forms and less like midgets in suites.

It does seem like a few TIE Fighters were added to the Battle of Endor, another improvement made in the interest of increasing the sense of epic scale.

When R2 is blasted in front of the shield generator bunker, I noticed that the electricity effects were enhanced. My wife noticed that they added some gadgets popping out of R2. I'll watch for that next time, but since I didn't even notice the new gadgets I doubt I will have any problem with the change.

""No... Nooo!""

When Vader is watching Luke getting zapped by the final attack of the Emperor's Sith lightning, Anakin now says ""No."" Then as he picks up Palpatine, Anakin more loudly says, ""Nooo!"" I've read this described as a ""scream"" but that is way overstating it. And contrary to what is commonly being reported, it is also not quite the extended ""Noooo!"" from RotS when Vader finds out that Padme is dead. (That may have been the recording they used as a basis, but if so it was augmented and shortened for this scene in RotJ.)

When looking at the complete Star Wars saga, these two additions of the word ""No"" do not seem out of place to me at all. Obi-Wan yelled, ""Noooo!"" when he saw his Jedi master get struck down by Darth Maul in Episode I. Luke yelled, ""Nooo!"" when he saw Vader strike down Obi-Wan in Episode IV. Luke has his mega-no sequence to Vader in Episode V, ""No... No! That's not true. That's impossible! ... Noooooo! Noo!"" It seems that now Anakin in Episode VI is just following in a time-honored tradition among his master and son. But at the climax of the six-film saga, it's stated at the prevention of the negative outcome. This broken man who had killed his wife and Jedi master was now sacrificing his life to save their son and destroy the Sith master. My wife, who had made it a game when watching the blu-rays to point out every change to the films she noticed, made no mention of Anakin's new No's. It seemed so natural and appropriate to her that after seeing the blu-ray once, she thought they had always been there. Anakin's new No's make perfect sense to me with respect to the entire film saga.

I have read criticisms that the new No's were out-of-character for Vader. Well, it is not Vader who said them! It was the buried persona of Anakin Skywalker who was emerging back to the surface to conquer Darth Vader. The titular Jedi who was at that moment returning. I like Anakin's new No's!

STILL UNCORRECTED...

I've long ago accepted the fact that I am a severe minority among first generation Star Wars fans. Many of the fans from our generation like to point out things they would change about the prequels or changes to the original trilogy they don`t like. So now that the films are all so close to perfection, I thought I would represent a radical view by going ""anti-purist"" and provide my fan-boy list of things in the classic trilogy that in my opinion still need changed or corrected!

Episode IV: A New Hope

After the droids land on Tatooine, the inside of the escape pod's open hatch that was previously blue is now a slightly more realistic-looking black in the blu-ray. But later when the stormtroopers search the area, the hatch is still blue. What, it is a black material than turns blue under the hot suns? This is minor point but just seems unfinished.

Lucas has long stated that the cantina scene was incomplete in the original release. He ran out of time and money to finish it. By now he's had decades, no shortage of money, and obviously no qualms about revising his movies. But one of the two Duros has long alien fingers while the other still has normal human hands. A little CG fix in a dim background, come on!

And in blu-ray it is now more than ever apparent that when Ponda Baba (walrus man) is shown at the bar he has fin-cup hands, instead of the more humanoid hand of the severed arm shown on the floor after Obi-Wan slices it off. The ANH deleted scenes even have the original shot of the severed fin-cup hand on the floor. Changing it to more humanoid hand in post-production for the original release was a completely sensible decision because without a humanoid hand it wasn't very clear what was on the floor. But now, with all this financial success and time, Lucas couldn't just go ahead and fix the previous shots of the alien to also have the five-fingered hands? A couple minor CG fixes, come on!

Also, I really don't see the need for all that blood on the floor by the severed arm. Putting the humanoid hand with a gun makes it pretty clear what Obi-Wan had cut off. All the other cases of limbs and heads getting chopped off by lightsabers throughout the rest of the film saga do not show any blood (in fact the severed body parts sometimes also conveniently disappear from view).

In 1976, the remote-control R2 was unreliable and often failed. So they improvised in some shots where only the top of R2 is visible by having the live actor that played him just hobble along with his own legs, which resulted in R2 appearing to bob up and down while traveling over a flat surface the character would be rolling across in-universe. Even as a kid I thought that looked ridiculous because R2 just shouldn't move that way. On blu-ray, the CG R2 in the prequels looks virtually identical to the live ones in the entire saga, so there is really no reason that they couldn't have just corrected the bobbing R2 shots to one moving in a manner consistent with all the other scenes he is shown rolling in.

An often pointed out effects problem is the appearance of Skywalker's lightsaber blade on the Falcon. The fix the blu-ray applied appeared inconsistent in my viewing. Sometimes it looked consistent with the saber blade's appearance in RotS and TESB, bold and bluish. But other times it still appears weak and turquoise-tinted. Why only fix some of the scene and not all?

In TESB blu-ray, it looks like R2's blue parts that originally appeared black while in Luke's X-wing have finally been made blue. But in ANH's Battle of Yavin, there are still shots of R2's blue parts being black. That should have been cake to fix them all by now.

I'm a huge film score music aficionado. TESB's iconic ""Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme)"" was based on the ""Imperial Attack"" theme from ANH. There was no longer a need for the original ""Imperial Attack"" so it never appeared in the saga outside of ANH. ""Imperial March"" was used in the subsequent five Star Wars films as appropriate. When the saga is viewed chronologically, the theme appearing significantly in the films taking place before and after ANH makes ANH seem somewhat at a loss without it. I feel it would be appropriate to edit brief phrases of ""Imperial March"" into ANH in two places: When Vader first appears in the film as he enters Leia's starship, and when Vader last appears in the film as he gains control of his TIE fighter and flies away. Thematically, that would make a lot of sense without altering the musical landscape of ANH as a whole.

Episodes V: The Empire Strikes Back

It makes perfect sense for walker vehicle motion to be produced with the use of stop-motion photography. Intuitively, machines moving in that non-organic fashion seems realistic. But I have always had a problem with the effect of tauntauns' moving. I do understand that in 1979, claymation was the only way to bring tauntaun's to life, but the choppy motion looks incredibly fake by today's standards, especially on blu-ray. I still have no problem with the muppet Taun-Tauns used for the close-ups, but for a couple distant shots they should have CGed the tauntaun scenes.

It seems to me that the scene where Han rescues Luke on Hoth uses a little short-cut in the upgrade to HD. The scene is now darker, which of course means less detail is needed. It actually makes the scene more dramatic because it visually supports Han's dialogue about it getting dark and there not being much time to get the shelter built to save them both from the cold Hoth night. But there is one shot of Luke laying down in the snow by the dead tauntaun in which the brightest seems to suddenly change. Is this a glitch from viewing it on my equipment, or a flaw in the blu-ray itself?

And in the modern age of ILM, there is no longer any need to depend on the 1979 live-action short sleeve/long sleeve ""effect"" to portray Luke with his hand cut off. Just fix his really long-looking arm with CG.

And as great as most of the lightsaber battle looks, Vader's lightsaber still comes across as hot pink in a couple shots. So the blu-rays almost got all the lightsaber shots fixed in the classic trilogy. And at the end of TESB when Luke, Leia and the droids are watching the Falcon fly away, R2's blue parts are still black.

Episodes VI: Return of the Jedi

Like almost everything on the Star Wars blu-rays the surface of the rancor's body looks impressive, but I'm still not happy with outcome of the effect of slowing down the footage to make the creature seem larger. Just like in my childhood, the rancor still moves too slow-mo to really seem that menacing to me. But since speeding up the footage would only make the creature seem smaller, the only way to really improve the effect in this manner would be to start over with a CG rancor. They'd need to either re-edit some of that scene visually to have extra faster movements to pace with the current music, or to just have the faster scene have a shorter overall runtime and edit out some of the musical score. I'd prefer the former over the latter.

When Yoda dies, the blu-ray still uses the archaic original effect of Yoda's blanket fading out with Yoda, while at the same time the blanket without Yoda can be seen fading in (but not exactly the same position) before it falls into the vacuum left by Yoda's passing. So for a time, two blankets are visible as Yoda fades away. It should now be easy to fix this transition by simply adding a CG blanket over both of the original blankets, with the CG blanket falling down not unlike the original one did after Yoda is completely gone from the shot.

The prequels expand upon and enhance the meaning of the classic films. In Episode I, John Williams introduced a new musical theme based on ""Imperial March"" called ""Anakin's Theme"", a softer, lighter theme which is used throughout the prequels. With respect to the entire film saga, it would be thematically appropriate to briefly quote Anakin's theme when Anakin dies and into Luke's reaction shot.

Editing a brief quote of the epic prequel musical theme called ""Duel of the Fates"" somewhere into the final confrontation of Jedi vs. Sith would also thematically unify the saga. The prequels make good use of the classic musical themes, while also evolving them into new themes, so a couple minute additions of prequel themes into the RotJ's soundtrack could enhance the cohesion of the saga as a whole.

Although it does not appear as much as the Luke's ""long-sleeve"" severed arm in TESB, a similar live-action ""effect"" was used for Vader/Anakin when Luke cut off his hand. This is more visible when in the close-up on Anakin after he throws Palpatine into the pit, the forearm that bends like it has a wrist in the middle of it (because in the real world, it does). But Anakin is a cyborg so maybe his forearm also got broken inside the leather suit? OK, fine. But it really stands-out when Luke is dragging Anakin to the shuttle by one hand and one bent forearm that happens to appear just as long as the arm that had the hand cut off. CG it!

Future Revisions to the Films?

Based on Lucas' pattern since 1997, the classic films get changed every 7 years so that alone would indicate that we have another revision to the saga coming by 2018. However, it has been all 6 films will be re-released theatrically in 3D one-at-a-time starting with Episode I in February 2012. If the 3D films come out at the rate of one per year, the final episode will come out in 2017 which is also the 40th anniversary of the original Star Wars film. It seems extremely likely that the films will be re-released in a home 3D format either one-at-a-time or all at once by 2017. Either way I suspect that I'll need a 3D TV by 2017). There is plenty of time to put further revisions into the rest of the films, especially the classic trilogy. I'd be thrilled if they revised anything from my ""still uncorrected"" list above! Lucas won't live forever so I doubt there will be any new versions of the films after the home 3D versions. So when will Lucas stop revising his films? My guess is 2017.

FINAL WORDS

You may not agree with all the opinions I expressed throughout this review, but if you are reading this then you must be a Star Wars fan of some kind on some level. If so, then do yourself a favor and watch all six films on blu-ray at least once, even if you have no intention of ever owning them. You'll see much more than I could possibly ever hope to describe in words. And if you wish to criticize the blu-ray versions after viewing them, at least you'll then have an educated opinion for doing so.

In my first viewing of Star Wars: The Complete Saga, the rich Star Wars multiverse has deepened in a way I couldn't have even imagined before seeing the films on blu-ray. While still not perfect, my favorite films have just gotten an incredible amount better. As impossible as it previously seemed, I'm somehow now even more of a Star Wars fan than I was before. But this blu-ray release has also reminded me that EVERY version of any Star Wars film is awesome!

If you have any questions, please feel free the ask. If you have also seen the blu-rays and want to comment on them with respect to my review, please also feel free. May the Force be with you.",1317600000,18,32457,4.591262303574513

The original trilogy looks outstanding there is no way you could tell this was shot back in 1977, it looks much better than a lot of the blu-rays from recent movies. I must buy for any fan of the series. You will only notice changes if you have no life and are a very petty person. This series is incredible and Lucas deserves more appreciation for the masterpiece he has brought us.",1317600000,7,485,4.34065934065934

Could you imagine what would happen if Mr. Lucas had access to time travel? Lincoln would have shot first. Hitler's ghost would look like a younger version of himself. The evolutionary line of all animals would have been altered so that even arthropods and fish could blink. Lucas would have painted rocks in front of the Mona Lisa. There would be more young men drafted into wars because Lucas always wanted there to be more troopers, and they would all sound the same. All credit for Empire and Jedi would have gone to him.

Grow up, George.",1317600000,18,561,4.6

Sure, the changes may seem minimal, silly even or not even a big deal and I would agree. But I find Lucas total lack of awareness/respect that there are actual fans who enjoyed the original movies to be quite galling and extraordinary. While the films maybe his creation, once the films are released, they belong to the public. It is MY choice to decide what versions of the film(s) I want to buy and since he saw fit to take away the choice to purchase the originals, I'm not buying them at all. However, my plan is to wait him out because eventually he will give us what we want I'm sure. We just have to wait a little longer for them but they will be there. I'm patient.

Of course all of the die hard fans are a little ticked off, but they're not big enough changes to turn me away.  I still enjoyed them just as much as the originals and did not feel my money went to waste.  Thumbs up!!",1317600000,19,550,4.046296296296297

There is nothing added that will make you say, ""Man that made the movie really suck.""  I bet if you just watched the movies without someone telling you something had changed, most (I said most) people would never even notice the small changes.

If you want to see the original movies as they were released, by all means watch them on inferior media like VHS, or DVD.  Nobody is forcing you to buy or watch these.  If you want to see the Star Wars Saga at it's best, do yourself a favor, and buy the Blu-ray edition.  Don't listen to all the crazy negative hype.",1317600000,23,720,4.335820895522388

7220678,5,B00YI71PN2,"I would give this set 4-1/2 stars, but bumped it up to an even 5 to counter the entitled whiners who don't even own the set and rated it one star instead of just voting with their wallets. Use a forum if you want to express your opinion, this is a review of the product in my hands.

While the visuals for Episodes II through VI look clean and sharp, the best improvement from the DVD version can be seen in Episode I. The sound in all 6 movies is also impressive; the first Republic ship in Phantom Menace rumbled my walls and turned my insides cold when it flew past camera. The movies really have Lucas-quality presentation. My only complaint centers around the lightsaber continuity that was disrupted with the DVD versions of the original trilogy. The contrast remastering that removed the white cores from the sabers has not been completely removed from these copies. It's improved in some scenes, most notably the Vader/Luke saber crossing in front of the Emperor in Return of the Jedi, but there are other scenes where they are unaltered from the DVD's. I would assume that it was a cost issue to touch so many more shots, but if there was ever a franchise that had the money to fix all those shots, it is this one.

I own several copies of these movies and expected the Blu-ray extras to match what had been released previously with the DVD's. I was pleasantly surprised to watch the first two extras discs and see completely new footage. That was a good 8-9 hours of behind the scenes coverage that I dove into rabidly. If you enjoy watching how these movies are made and the artistic visions that go into the final product then I HIGHLY recommend this set based on that. The third disc has a good selection of documentaries that I had not seen before as well as several spoofs that range from boring to ridiculously funny (<3 Robot Chicken).

Just today I discovered that in addition to the already released DVD commentary on each movie, there is a SECOND set of audio commentaries gathered from interviews with casts and crews. More value to a set that already ranks among my favorite collections that I own.

I would recommend this set to anyone that enjoyed the movies and would appreciate all the behind the scenes extras that have been crammed onto these discs. It would take a few dozen hours to watch and hear every piece of content in this set and I love that facet of it. Hope this helps people who are actually interested in the set.",1317513600,15,2454,4.507865168539326
7220679,5,B00YI71PN2,"This set is amazing! Star Wars looks very impressive. Although there are new changes, I do not really care. All the new features are nice too.",1317513600,12,142,4.5
7220680,5,B00YI71PN2,"I'm a fan-girl.  R2D2 was the ring bearer at my wedding.  As a Star Wars fan of Death Star proportions, I'm tired of all the complaining. The new Blu-Ray versions are remarkable, right down to the carbon scoring on C3PO and the bushy eybrows of Moff Tarkin. Get yourself to a THX home theater, quit complaining, and enjoy the blessing.",1317513600,18,335,4.566666666666666
7220681,5,B00YI71PN2,"Let me just get this out of the way and say that I agree that most of the changes Lucas has made are unnecessary.  And I agree that he should make the original unedited version available.  But that's not what he's done.  That said, I prefer to judge things on their own merits, and I don't see that any of his changes have hurt the story or the characters.  Specifically I don't think Darth Vader saying ""no"" at the end of Return of the Jedi hurts his character in any way at all (it is not the sad ""no"" of a man who believes he has killed the love of his life, it is the defiant ""no"" of a man who has just realized that all the mistakes of his life have led to a moment where he is actually watching his own son being murdered).

Even with all the changes Lucas has made, I still love these movies from beginning of episode I to the end of episode VI.

The blu-ray quality is exactly what you'd expect.  The colors are bright, the details amazing.  In many scenes you can now see the actual texture of the cloth used in the costumes, even the very fine lines in the Imperial uniforms.  The only downside is that A New Hope was made on what was basically a shoe-string budget for sci-fi at the time, and there are a few details (like being able to see brush strokes in the paint, or flaws in the original models) that you don't really want to see, but those are easy to overlook.  The sound is also great, esp. if you have a surround system.

Long story short, these are still amazing stories of adventure and heroism that are certain to last a long time despite Lucas' changes to them.  As an artist myself I can completely understand that sometimes you have to ""turn in"" work that you're not completely satisfied with, and he is simply going back and trying to fix some of the details that he wasn't satisfied with the first time around.  The stories told in the Star Wars movies are so rich and inspiring and the characters so iconic that the movies have even been used as teaching aids for philosophy and religious studies around the world.  These stories still retain that power (even after the much debated changes) and I believe will continue to do so for generations.",1317513600,17,2175,4.299019607843137
7220682,5,B00YI71PN2,"Well over the course of 2 weekends I've watched these films with my children and spouse.

I am the only of them who has ever seen all six prior.

I grew up with a deep love for the star wars universe, though I never took it to fanboy-ism (although I did buy a star wars belt buckle recently)

Changes, no changes.  Honestly, I don't really care.  The continuous releases have allowed a continued interest passed on now to a generation that ""doesn't know any better"".

thanx to these being put out yet again, my kids now love star wars too and the boy is asking when we can watch them again.  I can deal with the eye sores for the sake of having common ground with a 5 year old.

It would have been cool to get the original theatrical releases included, but honestly that shouldn't be a deal breaker for anyone considering the set.  I feel the story, the universe, really is that good, enjoy it.

I can understand and appreciate the pain of watching your childhood get screwed with in profound ways, I am a G1 transformers fan after all, but my nerd rage will do nothing good to anyone.

While i do understand partly why I did not adore Star wars initially it actually does have some more interest than I thought. The factthat the movies have been altered seems to be quite a sacrilege to many die-hard fan and to some degree one does notice that some of the ffects have been altered without being a connoisseur but is it really that big a deal? the movies are enjoyable even if the later produced earlier 3 episodes are less fun. On these discs there is such a lot of material that one can not really complain...even if all reviews on the site seem to be about people complaining or not about the upgrading of the movies. While it is true that from a cinematographic and historic perspective it is probably dumb to change a great classic, on theother hand the movies rea very very pleasant. theo nly real criticism is that maybe indeed the original versions should have been kept and included.

There is one caution however I've not seen comment on....the order you watch them.  Yes I know most everyone has already seen them starting from episode four all the way to episode three.  If you start with episode One, the Phantom Menace, and continue in sequence through episode Six Revenge of the Jedi, you will notice issues with story continuity and special effects.  You'll be going from unbelievably intense action sequences in Revenge of the Sith, to the relative benign fight scenes of A New Hope.  This is especially noticeable in the fight scene between Darth Vadar and Obi Wan on the Death Star.  Darth smites our friend Obi Wan in a seeming geriatric choreography of minor thrusts and parries that look rather silly when compared to what Mr. Lucas has given us in his later and more technologically advanced final three episodes.  An analogy might be made, when going from episode three to episode four, of continuing to walk a normal pace on an airport floor elevator and experiencing the abrupt lack of momentum once you've stepped off at the end.  If you can adjust to this required shift in what you're watching you'll do fine with this saga.  It's still one of Hollywood's finest examples of cinema and visceral entertainment and should be in everyone's video library.",1317427200,15,1406,4.8655462184873945
7220686,5,B00YI71PN2,"So I have finally had the time to watch all 6 movies, and the video quality is stunning, the remastering of the older films and the production of the new ones was excellent, with the audio quality up there with some of the best I've heard...
Now to the reason why so many people give a 1 star rating before actually seeing the changes...

Yes, there were changes, some I noticed, some I didn't...  for example I thought the Ewok's looked more lifelike, and some of the visual changes made decent sense...  As far as the ""Nooooo!"" scene, I honestly didn't think it hurt the film.  I don't think it was a required change, I would maybe not have added it due to the purist complaints, but honestly in the original 3 movies it would have been a bit weird to have the Nooooo! in it, but in context, and the fact we now have the visual back story leading up to the death of the emperor and who Vader is, the Noooo! doesn't take anything away, I don't think it adds much of anything, but it doesn't hurt the film...

All in all, I am a star wars fan, not die hard but I love the movies, originals and remastered with changes...  I can't complain about the quality or honestly even the changes...  so I will stick to a 5 star rating due to the quality of the movies, and of course the audio and visuals quality seen on the Blu Rays....

And honestly I have a 1080p THX certified projector and the colors, while emphasized, never bloomed out on me, nor did they seem completely unrealistic... I watched with several true purists who know the films second by second, and they while disappointed with some of the changes, said they still want to get the blu ray because of how great it makes the movies look.

7220692,3,B00YI71PN2,"ost of the other reviews have complained about the modifications to the film, so I'll talk about something else: the layout of the menu options. The way it's organized is really cumbersome. The bonus features are organized by movie, then by planet, then by type of feature. Given that the only reason many people bought this set was to see the deleted scenes, it just means having to go through many layers to get to the deleted scenes, then you have to backtrack to see the deleted scenes for EACH planet. I can't imagine who thought organizing the features by planet was a good idea. To make things worse, there's no ""play all"" option for the deleted scenes. Again, a simple, standard option that makes life easier.

Most of the new deleted scenes themselves aren't particularly exciting and it's clear why they were cut. Amongst the prequels, the only one I enjoyed was the ROTS Elevator Antics because it really shows the bond between Obi-Wan and Anakin. I also liked the Anakin-Palpatine relationship in Amending the Constitution. The really gems are the original trilogy deleted scenes. It was truly magical seeing scenes we've heard about for three decades but never seen. . I personally think the Anchorhead scene should have stayed in the movie because it's great characterization for Luke. It's even great seeing rough cuts of the Cantina. The ESB scenes weren't quite as dramatic, although I did like seeing the extra footage of the pre-1997 Wampas. But it's clear those scenes would have detracted from the film. ROTJ also has some neat scenes, such as the one of Luke building the lightsaber - another one that could easily have made it to the final cut. The expanded scenes with Moff Jerjerrod really build up his character and make him a much more sympathetic. I really do wish they'd kept that in.

I want to be clear: these movies look gorgeous on blu-ray. However, they didn't look bad on DVD. The main selling feature of this blu-ray was the bonus features and I just think they could have - and should have - had an easier layout. Hopefully future releases will streamline the menu options. I hate to give Star Wars just 3 stars, but I really think this release could have and should have been better.",1317340800,4,2221,4.721649484536083

7220695,3,B00YI71PN2,"I'm 43. Like many my age, Star Wars holds a special place in my life memories. What has happened is you have such a successful cutting edge movie that has proved the test of time. My 10-yr old is just as fascinated with the series as I was 25+ years ago. So you have two groups, us old-school purists trying to hang on to memories of our younger years under the guise of cinematic preservation. And then you have a new generation that essentially isn't as concerned with home media production history relating to the original release. How many products on Amazon have well over 1000 1-star ratings for *any* product yet still maintains and avg 3-star rating. that says it all

My conclusion is either a) Lucas DOES really hate the cult following of his art, b) Lucas is too busy to be involved to call the shots on the blu-ray editing, iow, he doesn't care much about the bd product and is busy with other things on his life, or c) this is an ingenious marketing plan to first sell to the mainstream, piss the enthusiasts off to create buzz, then release a very low compression bd version of the unaltered originals to shut everyone up that says they want cinematic preservation when they really want to relive a better time in their life from many years ago and are change-adverse personalities at their core. It's interesting the things we all cling to as we grow older. I would say 'get a life' to many, but to each their own. Star Wars IS worthy of better retail products that offer hi-res versions of less-altered original cinematic material.",1317254400,10,1547,4.544802867383512

Im not a perfectionist and i can deal with minor change here and there, whatever.
But when its this bad of a change, why bother.
Think George Lucas should rethink his ideas, his original first 6 movies were cool.

Now im not a crazy Star Wars but i consider them awesome, i really like it.
But when you make a change, you should be looking on improving.

7220697,5,B00YI71PN2,"This a review of the product, and not of the films, themselves.
-------------------------------------
Ah, yes. Despite the changes to the OT, half of which I could've gone without, it was a very worthwhile experience to watch all 6 films in high quality audio and video, weaknesses of the PT aside.

Episodes 1 and II certainly have excessive dnr, but III looks excellent. The OT looks fairly good too, with some grain befitting the age of the movies. The sound is something to behold, as well, with 6.1 audio.

With over 40 hours of extras, you'll also be quite busy, with a wealth of interviews, documentaries, deleted scenes, and more! As a fan who's never seen much of this material, it was very informing and worthwhile. Of course, several new changes have been introduced to the movies, and depending upon your views, you will either not mind or absolutely loathe them and George Lucas. As for my opinion, several of them are quite egregious, but do not detract from my overall enjoyment of the films.

In the end, if you're a fan or just a casual person who happens to like Star Wars, this may be the set for you, unless those new changes really bother you.

p.s.: I also would have loved having the original, unaltered trilogy in high definition, as well!",1317254400,12,1263,4.675675675675675

I have had this item for nearly 2 weeks now and I have merely scratched the surface of the rediculously large amount of special features. The films look BEAUTIFUL and sound better than ever!

7220710,4,B00YI71PN2,"I've been a fan of Star Wars since I was 9 years old (nom I'm 42).  As the years go by I've seen George Lucas make changes and adjustments to the original trilogy.  Not all this changes are good but in the end this is the world HE CREATED and he has the right to do with it what he wants.  How much I wished that the original versions of A New Hope, Empire and Jedi were included in this set but Lucas doesn't want us to see those versions.  Let's face it, it is highly unlikely that we will see the old versions in HD someday soon, maybe after Lucas is dead we'll get them.  So, for now we have to accept what Lucasfilm is giving to us.
The movies have never seen better, the image quality is great, the sound has improved a lot and we even have back the music of the moment the X-Wing Fighters start the attack on the  Death Star in A New Hope, that music cue has been restored only in the English soundtrack.  The extras are great, the deleted scenes are like a treasure and SURPRISE SURPRISE, the cartoon from the Star Wars Holiday Special is included, this is the cartoon that features the first appearance of a little character called Bobba Fett.  You just have to look for it, it is easy to find it.
So I think that even if I don't like some of the latest changes, I still like Star Wars, we just have to accept that if it was our movie and we had the money and time, we too would be making a lot of changes to ""make it better"".
Just imagine what changes are coming to the 3D versions of the movies...",1317168000,9,1508,4.053872053872054
7220711,3,B00YI71PN2,"The added Vader ""Noooo"" at the end of Jedi was just horrible.  But then there are many things about the last third of Jedi that bother me.  I bought this edition for the deleted scenes and documentaries, but honestly the scenes are on youtube and the fan documentaries Star Wars Begins, Building Empire, and Returning to Jedi, all available for free are the best docs I've seen on the movies.

The new movies have some parts I like- all the Obi bits are good in my opinion, but I found myself fast forwarding through the ""Annie"" and Padme parts because I still find them horrible.

It may be my imgaination, but certain background elements in the old trilogy seem enhanced or added to.  Things have more color, or style, or come fancy holo terminal will be there when there wasn't one before, etc.

I would have been happy just getting the original trilogy on blu-ray.  The extras aren't worth it in my opinion.",1317168000,10,911,4.552147239263804
7220712,4,B00YI71PN2,"Wow! Star Wars hits Bluray and I'm sure all the geeks are up in arms about the fact that Lucas decided to give us the Special Editions (no doubt so he can sell you the originals yet again, down the line).  Well...  like I said in my last Star Wars review way back when it hit DVD for the first time, you don't have to buy it, no one's holding a gun to your head, right?  With a franchise this big and a dedicated fan base this large, the geeks will never be satisfied.  Oh well...  I'm here to review the movies and the fact theat they look stunning in their Hi-def format.  Episodes I-III have never been my favorites.  I have a allergy for bad acting and Hayden Christiansen is enough to evoke thoughts of suicide,but on Bluray they look absolutely stunning and this actually made me like them just a tiny bit more.  The original three films were all about story and the actors, the latter were all about CGI and... who knows, Jar jar Binks?  Episodes IV-VI are the Special Editions, as I said, but they look better than they have ever looked, and that comes with it's pros and its cons.  The better the picture, the clearer the glitches.  In the opening scene, where the Empire has captured the Rebel Blockade Runner, Darth Vader emerges from the smoke and destruction, and you can see the brushstrokes on his mask.  It looks like it was made by a 10-year-old kid.  Que Serra Serra.  But it still looks amazing and the sound is phenomenal.  Extra features galore!  Deleted scenes from the original movies.  Interviews.  Making Of... documentaries.  Wow!  There is plenty here for the geeks to salivate over and plenty here for the casual fan as well.  Sure they're not the originals.  Sure Greedo shoots first still...  But what are you gonna do?  Buy it or not.  Very simple.  I am a fan. I own these movies on VHS, DVD, and now Bluray.  Gotta have them.  They truly do look fantastic and the 3 bonus discs have a ton of stuff to keep you entertained for over 40 hours and that's insane.  Do not like the sleeves for the discs (scratches???  really?  Does no one think of these things?)but the packaging is compact and well illustrated.

Overall, you will have a choice to make, to buy or not to buy, that is the question...  I have been a fan since '77.  I have to own the original three films.  The latter three can burn in hell, but in this is a chance to them all at once (you can buy them individually, if you are insane).  And the price was very reasonable.  So sit around a moan and cry and whine about how unfair George Lucas is, or....  Pop in the Blurays and enjoy the ride.

7220713,1,B00YI71PN2,"This is a perfect example of how to take a beautiful thing and debase it out of spite. Vader says ""Noooooooo..."" at the end of Return of the Jedi?  I say ""Mehhhhhhhhh...."" to this. I cancelled my preorder.",1317168000,17,205,4.394736842105263
7220714,1,B00YI71PN2,"Disclaimer:  I have been a Star Wars fan since I saw STAR WARS in the theater in 1977.  I have not purchased this blu-ray set and I have no intention of doing so.  I have never before written a review/opinion on Amazon.

My review is of the content and concept of how this release is being marketed and presented, so I understand that some will argue that I shouldn't write a review for a product I don't own, and that I shouldn't write an opinion of what I wish this set were.  I also understand that some will accuse me of having too much time on my hands or of living in a basement.  Others may say I'm living in the past.

Whenever I choose to purchase Star Wars again, my intent will be to purchase a High Definition copy of the movies that I saw in 1977, 1980, and 1983 in the best resolution available.  This is no different than being excited about and purchasing Psycho (1960), Casablanca (1942) on blu-ray.  Star Wars (1977), like Psycho, is a classic film.  It has been lauded and appreciated for over 30 years, and it should be preserved and restored and presented in the greatest possible resolution.  Technology and the ability to change and edit existing works after their release may lead to increased interest and even an increase in the fan base, but that doesn't have to be and shouldn't be in place of preserving the original.

When the Special Editions were announced and Star Wars reappeared in theaters, I was very excited, like nearly every other SW fan.  The opportunity to see the films restored, theatrically projected, and augmented with modern special effects was an amazing and unprecedented concept.  And following the release, one could purchase the original versions on VHS or the Special Editions.  The fact that they were called Special Editions indicated that they were a separate creation or interpretation of the originals, but as they were made available on DVD and Blu-ray, they are no longer marketed as Special Editions, of course, and the dates remain 1977, 1980, and 1983 (despite the fact that they contain significant material from as recent as 2011, which should now be their stated release date).  Having the Special Editions available on Blu-ray is fantastic for those who want them, but as far as I'm concerned, the original Star Wars trilogy has not been released on DVD or Blu-ray.  They were relegated to ""Bonus Feature"" status, and never presented properly for the format or era in which they were released.  And for all those who say to just stick with the VHS of the originals, would these same apologists say the same if every other classic film were altered, rereleased, and only available in its original for on VHS or a low resolution, outdated DVD release?

There is not rational reason that the original, unaltered STAR WARS trilogy should not be available on Blu-ray at the highest resolution possible, restored to look as pristine as when first released (remembering that film resolution is STILL greater than 1080p video)

This brings me to my one other disappointment with this set.  I have no doubt that this is the best that the films have ever looked in an official release and I'm sure the HD presentation is great to look at.  But it still isn't the best they could look.  Multiple reviews have commented on the master sources of these transfers and the fact that they still don't live up to the best of what Blu-ray could be offering.  I have no speculation as to the motivations of George Lucas, but I will not join those who believe that each of his changes are improvements (many come across as cartoony cgi additions that serve only to distract from the story) or that he has taken the time to make the films look as good as they possibly could.  That would have involved a new 4k or 8k transfer of the negatives (clearly not possible for AOTC or ROTS).  I would have purchased this set in a heartbeat at it's current resolution if the original trilogy had been in included unaltered, but I am still amazed by all those who believe that this is the best possible resolution or presentation available.  It clearly isn't.  It's the best so far, but just as Lucas rereleased the DVD version to include the low-res originals I can only hope that something similar (and much more respectful to both the films and the fans) happens with the blu-rays.  Spielberg understands what the fans want, as do Ridley Scott, and even CBS digital, which released Star Trek (the original series) to include both the pristine original versions, and the versions enhanced with cgi.

Until Lucasfilm restores and releases the original Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi, I will not be purchasing any version of SW on Blu-ray.  In the meantime, dedicated fans have labored long and hard, with limited resources and have achieved results that meet or exceed the official release in every respect and I will be enjoying those versions.  Technology has enabled Lucas to ceaselessly and unnecessarily tinker with his property, but is has also allowed the fans of his original vision to preserve what was created more faithfully and more entertainingly than he has.  At last, the circle is now complete.

7220716,1,B00YI71PN2,"Star Wars Episode 4 in the 2004 DVD had the music volume turned down as the X wings descended down the trench. In this 2011 release, they say the music volume is now up again? The change was definitely deliberate. Why must these changes be back and forth? That is a sign of uncertainty or some marketing scheme.

Is there anyone who actually likes the added ""No"" and ""Noooo!"" by vador in Return of the Jedi? I watched it on Youtube and was hurt. The change actually sinks the impact of the movie. It takes you 'out' of the movie instead of pulling you in it. At the end we still see the new younger Anakin instead of the older person that Luke saw. But if I was Luke, I would be thinking to myself 'Who is that guy?'

I jumped on-board the 'Widescreen' or 'Letterbox' format many years ago, when everyone was against it, because you could see a film the way the film looked in the theater. But with Star Wars, that is no longer possible. I didn't mind the Special Editions and some of the added things but what seems to be going on here is an unfair bait-switching to earn money for future releases.

These additions are distractions. Sometimes traditions should be left alone. There are a lot of angry people. I understand it. You don't mess with a person's tradition.

It seems that Lucas tried and tried to merge the original trilogy with the newer trilogy together, and you simply cant do it.

When Black and White movies were colorized at least you could turn down the color on the TV if you didn't like it. With this, we will boycott it. NO I DIDNT EVEN BUY IT!! That'll teach them a lesson. Lucas can do what he wants, and I hope the majority does what they want by not buying. It would be neat if this gives him an economic crash.",1317081600,17,1738,4.302752293577981

Especially Revenge of The Sith, I thought that one looked the best (probably because it's the newest.) I can understand why fans are mad with Darth Vader saying  ""NOOOO!!!!"" but it's really not as bad as I thought it would be. It does seem rather pointless to add that to it, but whatever. All the other changes are so minor you most likely wouldn't notice unless someone told you about them. Aside from maybe Obi Wan's odd call/scream to scare off the Sand People. I found that one kinda hilarious.  But you get over these things when you're watching it anyways, it's still Star Wars, and it's never looked this amazing before. If you could stand the 2004 DVD changes of the original trilogy, you won't have a problem with these. All the extra's are really cool too. I would like to note that it DOESN'T include deleted scenes that were on the original prequel DVD's. These are all for the most part unfinished scenes.

I enjoyed this set a lot. I really forgot how much I enjoyed these movies until I watched it on Blu Ray again (it's been a few years since I last watched them.) I grew up watching the original trilogy on VHS until they looked like crap. I still got them somewhere.",1317081600,12,1278,4.4297872340425535
7220719,4,B00YI71PN2,"If you go by Amazon's average score alone, you'd think this Blu-ray set caused cancer or something. But that's what happens when you allow angry fans to write uninformed reviews months before the product is actually released. Mind you, there are plenty of sensible, valid complaints to be had about this set. Only one of the six films (Episode III), looks truly amazing. The original films suffer because they're derived from the 2K laserdisc transfers and not the 4K master files. And there are the unnecessary additions to the old films, most notably the terrible Vader ""dialogue"" added to the climax of Episode VI.

That's just what you have to put up with in this set. If you don't like it, don't buy it. As relatively lackluster as the video quality may be in some cases, it's still certainly superior to past formats. And luckily, all six movies sound amazing. They'll really put your home theater to the test. The bonus features are also robust, featuring a healthy mix of commentaries, retrospectives, and deleted scenes. The latter material alone should more than justify the upgrade for many fans.

Yes, Lucasfilm could have done more as far as offering a complete set of bonus features or providing the best possible video transfers for the original trilogy. With the 3D theatrical re-releases coming, it's a safe bet we'll see new Blu-ray editions in the coming years.

It's very frustrating that people are using the review section as a blog for their rants, rather than to actually review the product. Here's the deal, the films look and sound amazing. Simple as that. The classic films look phenomenal. The prequels look pristine. What people need to keep in mind is this is the ""complete saga"", not the ""complete collection of every version of the films"". This is the COMPLETE film series of Star Wars, episodes 1 thru 6. Anakin's journey from hero to villain and back again in glorious hi-def. Yes, Lucas has made alterations, enhancements, adjustment, and so on but, and while some are better than others and some weren't at all necessary, it is largely intended to bring all 6 films together so that they feel more cohesive. It's cross pollination. Bring the look of the old into the new and bring the new tech into the old. When people comment about how a film like Blade Runner was released in a set with all previous versions, the comparison is somewhat irrelevant for me. Blade Runner is not part of an ongoing film series that spans from 1977 to 2005.  It's a one shot film (and a classic at that) but it's something that's not ongoing. It's one of my favorite films and it's a masterpiece and a landmark in Sci-Fi but it's not tied to anything current like, say, a Blade Runner 2, 3, and 4.... The intent here in this ""complete saga"" is for todays generation and the generations to come to be able to view this (all 6 films) as a complete work, as cohesively as possible. You should be able to watch the newest one (ep3) and then pop in the oldest one (ep4) in one sitting and have it be as minimally jarring visualy (for example, watch the original Terminator and then T2. Completely different look and feel to the overall film quality, not to mention the score, and then, if you're still wanting more, try comparing the latest entry, Terminator Salvation, to the original). The same could be said for the Alien films. Star Wars is a living, breathing document, not a time capsule. It's a work that spans decades from beginning to end and It should not be relegated to a mere reference point. Lucas' first major change to the series was in 1980 rerelease where he changed it to ""Episode IV - A New Hope"". From this change, Star Wars ceased to be ""Star Wars"". It was no longer a stanalone film, rather, it became a building block for a series. It's always cracked me up how people act as if these changes are something new but we had completely different actors portraying the Emperor between 1980's Empire and 83's Jedi and nobody ""boycotted"" the film because he was different. That's a change, people. Let's keep some perspective.

Now for those who say that Lucas has a complete disregard for those effects wizards, model makers and puppeteers who worked on the original films, this is simply not the truth and anybody who actually goes thru this box set can tell you that. This box set celebrates, as much or more than any past release, those people who were behind the scenes. While it is true that some of their work is no longer in the films itself there's no attempt to pretend it never existed. All 3 of the original making of docs are present along with several archival interviews with the people who brought it all to life. It quickly becomes apparent that there's an understanding of history in this set. They went to great lengths to make sure we're seeing the people involved and, ironically enough, a lot of the original shots that have been replaced in the feature show up in the featurettes and docs in their original form. There's so much of what went into making the film and even more behind the scenes of what never made it in originally. I'm not just talking deleted scenes but concept painting and alternate versions of animatics. Dozens of turnarounds of costumes and props and even close ups of the 'traditional' matte paintings. It feels very much that Lucas and co have a strong respect and appreciation for those who helped him bring it to life originally but as the audience becomes more sophisticated the films must evolve to retain relevancy. At the end of the day, someone who's new to the series will never get fully emerged into the world when they're distracted by the wire going from Sy Snootles mouth to the microphone. They'll never look at the pink blob below the landspeeder and think it's ""hovering"".  These films were so far ahead of what they were trying back then, many of the techniques barely worked at the time and have no chance of standing up in hi def today.  Even a lot of the digital work from the 1997 Special Editions (which was cutting edge at the time) has now been updated to keep it relevant. That's the key for this franchise.  Star Wars has transcended being a mere film. It's been embraced and rediscovered decade after decade and the demographic changes year by year. It's as talked about today as much as more recent films such as Avatar are. It's still a topic of discussion. Citizen Kane came out practically the same time on blu ray as this box set and how much do you see people discussing that? Do we want Star Wars to become part of the past or do we want it to be current?

I feel that it's a double edged sword. People want what they saw in 1977 on hi def but they'll not be satisfied with a straight transfer, scratches and all. They'll want it cleaned up I'm sure and then they'll want the wires removed and matte lines toned down but then it starts to be something else, and no longer the ""original"", right?  I get the longing for the feeling of ""nostalgia,"" honestly I do, but at the end of the day, there's not one version of this film that will satisfy every single fan. I recently was watching the blu ray of Back to the Future and when it ended, it didn't have the ""to be continued..."" tag. That was the version of that film I had grown up with and there it was... gone! It was a little jarring to me but I got used to it. I'll always have my memories and I am not dependent upon anyone else to preserve my childhood. Simple as that.

Give this box set a shot. You'll be happy that you did. The films have never looked or sounded this good and you're really missing out if you pass it up because of a couple of tweaks here and there. The core is still intact and that should be what's important.",1317081600,14,6477,4.441547518923465
7220724,5,B00YI71PN2,"Changes happen people get over it, this set is the most impressive visual tour de force in the short history of the blu ray medium. The six films have not looked better ever and as such should be considered a must buy.",1317081600,12,218,4.214285714285714
7220725,5,B00YI71PN2,"You don't have to be a new generation fan to appreciate the special edition versions or the prequels.  My introduction to Star Wars was going to see Return of the Jedi in 1983.

There are certainly things I like/dislike in any of the movies, but even the originals weren't perfect. Adding in a NOOOO into Return of the Jedi does not diminish the film- The slapstick ewoks, burp jokes and the slightly less enthusiastic acting already did that.  Does any of this make it a bad movie? No. It is a very good movie, but flawed since the beginning. Same things goes for the other movies as well.  These are not supposed to be perfect movies, but fun movies for children and their parents to enjoy.  For every good alteration Lucas makes, he makes a pointless one.  So there really is no ""perfect"" version of any Star Wars movie, except for perhaps this version of The Empire Strikes Back. If Lucas added in Roger Rabbit to the background of one of the scenes, then sure. Give this set 1 Star. But all the changes are within the Star Wars universe.

Getting back to the set- They did an amazing job with the picture and sound quality.  It is night and day from any previous release.  There is enough bells and whistles to please any fan.  The special features are also the best I have seen for the series.  The nearly 1 hour of deleted scenes from the original trilogy is a treat.  You can't tell me that these angry fanboys who claim to be ""true fans"" wouldn't be interested, since this is the first time they have been released.

The original 1977 version of Star Wars is not included here, which is what launched this whole thing we know as Star Wars.  That would have given the set 5 stars, However, I gave it a 5 to counter all the moronic 1 star reviews on here.",1317081600,11,1762,4.365030674846626

+ Films look and sound great (better than previous releases of course)
+ Simple, but nice box set
+ Price on Amazon is a great deal compared to other retailers, so if you buy it you should get it here

Cons
- As others mentioned, the original versions of the original trilogy are not included
- 'Bonus feature' discs are terrible, it takes about 30 seconds to get from the main menu to a single deleted scene, takes almost the same time to go from one deleted scene to another... I could not find a way to ""Play All""
- All of the deleted scenes I watched were garbage, Youtube quality video, most are shorter than the time it takes to switch from one deleted scene to the next so most of your time is spent in the superfluous menus

7220734,5,B00YI71PN2,"After waiting several months, the Blu-ray edition of Star Wars is here.  I promised that I would not write any kind of review until I had seen all six pictures of the series at least once.

Episode I
Visuals & audio:  Both greatly superior to the DVD.  A grossly over-exposed scene of the city on the DVD was corrected  here and  the landscaping and architecture are breath-taking.  Audio is very good.  Sound of explosions have real bass fundementals unlike the DVD.  I'll have more to say about the music later.
Story and acting: Probably the weakest of the six in both respects.  Neeson and McGregor are always good as you would expect.  Natalie Portman is irritating in this one.  She mumbles and whines through her dialog and nobody seemed to be there to correct her.  I realize that she is supposed to be hiding the fact that she is actually the Queen but at least she could have spoken distinctly.  Jake Lloyd as young Anakin Skywalker was a big mistake -- a cute little boy who runs around saying ""yippee!""and his characterization is not convincing.  A much better choice,  for that part would have been young Daniel Logan who played Boba Fett in Episode II; he had the demeanor and appearance far more consistent with the character he would ultimately become and he was still young enough for the part at that time.  Every time I see him in Episode II I think, there's the kid who should have played Anakin.  The pod race is a little long but for some reason the sound effects are less irritating here than with the DVD.
Special effect are marvelous and  what you would hope for with Lucas' technology by this time.

Episode II
Visuals & audio: Some of the night scenes in this are really dark -- probably more like the original film was.  I made it a point to watch all of these films in a totally dark room.  The DVD probably had compressed contrast to make it more suitable for its time.  Audio is very good -- the music and sound effects in the entire series never override the dialog which is clear and understandable at all times.  The sibilance components of the dialog are always clear providing better intelligibility.
Story and acting.  Portman improved slightly, but the romance scenes are unendurable.  Hayden Christensen is awful here, reciting his dialog without conviction and putting stresses on the wrong words.  Lucas is to blame for a lot of this: He wrote the story and directed the films.  He should not have allowed these sort of things to get away from him.
Special effects are great-- the car chase at the beginning and the monster battles and rescue at the end are unbelieveable and look splendid here. The monster battle at the stadium was, supposedly, a tribute to Ray Harryhausen, the master of stop-action animation.

Episode III
Visuals & audio:  Looks wonderful but is not that much of an improvement over the DVD.  DVD mastering had come a long way by the time this picture was released although the DTS sound of the Blu-ray cannot be matched by the DVD.  The scenes of cityscape and futuristic architecture in this episode and Episode II simply cannot be believed and are especially striking with the resolution of Blu-ray.
Story and acting:  Natalie Portman had improved greatly, bringing real humanity to her character.  I  can say the same but to a slightly lesser degree for Christensen.  Obviously a lot of coaching went on between films.  The story is very good and neatly ties into episode IV which follows.

Episode IV
I watched the series in this order because I wanted to see how bad this episode was going to look compared with episode III.  Not a bit of it!
Visuals & audio:  The restoration of this film is nothing short of a miracle in picture and sound.  John Williams composed some his most ravishingly beautiful music for this film.  Like the opera cycle ""The Ring of the Nibelungs"" by Richard Wagner (sort of his ""Star Wars""), Williams composed specific themes or leitmotifs to pertain to his characters: Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Darth Vader and even Han Solo have their own musical themes which are recalled in the orchestra when they are the center of attention.  At 40:48 when Luke sees his dead parents and burned home, the horns (French horns as most people incorrectly call them) sound a theme that is one of the main themes Williams uses in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind.""  The  film does not seem old at all having rich detail and wonderful sound quality.  However, I was a little irked to discover that the average volume level of this episode is a full 8 to 10 decibels higher than episode III.  That's a lot and it means you cannot use the same volume setting for all the films in this series and get the same effect, which I find rather irritating.  The entire episode, including the dialog, is at a higher average volume level than the preceding episode and the reason why this would be necessary or overlooked eludes me.
Story and acting:  Luke Skywalker is portrayed by Mark Hamill initially as a young man with no sense of purpose which is what I assume Lucas wanted him to be. But is does bother me to hear him say, ""But it's a whole nother year.""  This being said on a planet far, far away?  Princess Leia Organa: Carrie Fisher is OK here but her British accent keeps coming and going.  Harrison Ford and particularly Alec Guinness bring a huge amount to this film.  Even at Guinness' advanced age, his dialog rolls out of  him effortlessly and totally believably.  The special effects were groundbreaking for this time even though Lucas was operating on a strict budget.  The final battle scene, no matter how many times you have watched it is still a nail biter. This was of course the first film originally released in 1977 that we all came to know and love.
Changes/alterations:  I don't have any qualms over the little additions Lucas put into this film.  They enrich it a bit.  We get an elevation view and other details of the architecture of the Mos Eisley Spaceport which I regard as a real improvement in helping dispel the impression that it is simply a movie set.  The CG of Jabba the Hutt was a good idea -- at least we now know what he looked like.  Han Solo walking behind him and stepping on his rear quarter is quite funny if you catch it.
Jabba in this episode seems quite friendly toward Han Solo in this scene.  In most of Jabba's other scenes he is a crazed Caligula-like dictator.  I'm not sure most people will even catch some of these modifications, except for those who have made a life study of these movies.

Episode V
Visuals and audio:  Here I noticed quite a difference in clarity between the scenes shot on set which are crystal clear and the multiple element space battle scene which look a little soft in focus compared to any of the other films.  This episode contains some of Williams' most majestic music, showing off the wonderful brass section of the The London Symphony,  certainly one of the world's finest orchestras.  Who ever decided on that orchestra certainly made the right move.  It brings a great deal to these films.  So far I haven't seen any reviews mentioning the music or the great orchestral playing of it.  It's nice to see they at least got a credit, considering what they contributed to these films.
Story and acting:  Probably the best of the lot in most respects.  Hamill, Fisher and Ford have enriched their characters greatly.  The story is probably the most powerful of the six.
Changes/Alterations: These appear to be limited to the few inserts made in the ""Cloud City"" scenes, which, again, I think improve on the original film, the the teeth gnashing and moaning of the devotees to the original versions notwithstanding.  If there were any other additions, I missed them.

Episode VI
Visuals and audio:  Both superb.  The most complex space battle scenes ever done up to that time do not have the soft focus problems of Episode V and look absolutely wonderful.  The speeder chase through the forest is stunning and beautifully accomplished and looks great on a large screen TV.
Story and acting:  Again, the principals in the cast are at the top of their game with the story leading to a smashing finale of the entire tale.  The Ewoks were put in, I think, mainly for the kids to appreciate, but it's cute and well-done.
Changes/alterations:  The rework of the ending, celebrating the victory over the Empire, is a great improvement visually and musically over the original, which looked and sounded like a Disney kiddie picture.  Oh, yes.  I guess there was a change to the musical number in Jabba's den to update it a little.

When I got to the end of this episode and saw the credits start to roll, I unexpectedly felt a chill running up the back of my neck.  Maybe it was just the music, but I think there was something else.

I am not going to give any rating of the best and the worst of these films as we all have our own opinions on that.

A word about the ""book"" container.  I think it's fine, using less shelf space.  Removing the discs is easy by slightly bending the page downward thus lifting the leading edge of the disc.  Then the disc can be easily pushed out by its center hole.  The paper-based material, being much softer than the polycarbonate plastic of the discs, is unlikely ever to scratch them.  A word of warning though.  I would make it a point not leave the book lying open, especially at a page where the disc has been removed.  If a foreign particle falls into the disc storage area it could end up scratching the disc.  The repolishing devices that can be used to refurbish DVDs and CDs are not usable with BDs, the thickness of the plastic of the playing side  being much less.  If you scratch a Blu-ray to the point it mistracks, I think you're out of luck.

Amazon's pricing policy:  I think I was treated more than fairly in this regard.  I pre-ordered the set months ago.  Then Amazon reduced the price by $10 and I was given notification that my original price would be reduced accordingly.  The set arrived promptly with free shipping and in perfect condition.  A great addition to my Blu-ray collection.",1316995200,24,10097,4.598879551820728
7220735,5,B00YI71PN2,"I have grown up with Star Wars.  I watched the originals on cable growing up (I was still in diapers when they first hit the big screen).  I went to the theaters opening night as the original three episodes were remastered in 1997.  I caught each of the three new episodes via midnight premiers over the past decade.  I was so happy to finally have a chance to upgrade my collection from VHS to DVD and now finally to Blu Ray.  The color and sound are spectacular and worth owning for any Star Wars fan.  The boxed set itself is packaged in a nice little photo album styled sleeves that is beautiful to look at.

I look forward to a day where each of the various director cuts (original, remastered and Blu Ray) are available together in the same set, to give the viewer a chance to experience each of the various releases and era associated with them.  However until that day comes, this is the best version in circulation and is a must own!",1316995200,16,942,4.3428571428571425
7220736,5,B00YI71PN2,"The Star Wars Saga on Blu Ray is fine compilation of all six Star Wars movies as well as an extensive collection of behind-the-scenes extras, documentaries and interviews. I am happy with the picture quality of each movie, but totally blown away by the audio mix. These movies have never sounded better. The picture quality varies from movie to movie, but overall I am impressed with just how good the entire series looks.

I did notice a few color and picture anomalies that had been mentioned by other reviewers, but with a couple of minor adjustments to my Panasonic plasma display, I was able to fix these issues (the teal tint in Episode II and the muted star fields in parts of Episode IV) by simply changing the Color Management setting from ""Warm"" to ""Normal"" and the Picture Settings from ""Dynamic"" to ""Cinema."" After doing that, this set as well as other Blu Ray titles I have look much, much more detailed and stunning. I'm a little confused as to why some details and effects were tweaked for this release, but others were ignored, like the color of Luke's lightsaber in Episode IV, as well as the lightsaber jump-cuts that occur when he turns it on and off. I am happy to see that the ""Emperor's Slugs"" were cleaned up in Episode VI, but don't quite get why some of the matte-lines in the same movie remain visible, but none of these details are that galaxy-shattering to me personally.

The extras, including the deleted scenes, new and archival interviews, model and prop displays, are very interesting and informative, and the 2nd commentary track made up of archival interviews is even more interesting than the 1st previously released commentary. I haven't listened to all of the commentaries through each movie yet, but they clearly spent some time and effort to make sure the archival commentary matched up as closely as possible to the scenes. And I am still, piece by piece, making my way through all of the locations, shorter video commentaries and concept art included on discs 7 and 8. There are quite a few bits of information about the making of these movies that I never even knew before, and I've been a Star Wars fan since I was 12 years old back in 1977.

I do wish that the excellent documentary ""Empire of Dreams"" and the Prequel documentaries ""The Beginning,"" ""From Puppets to Pixels"" and ""Within a Minute"" had been included, but I already have those on DVD, so with those and the new extra material in the Blu Ray set, I feel like I have the most complete Star Wars home video collection I want.

While I don't really care that much about seeing the original trilogy as each film appeared in 1977, '80 and '83, I do think it is a missed opportunity that those earlier cuts were not included here. It would have been very interesting to be able to compare, scene by scene, exactly what was changed and why, by offering the original cuts via seamless branching, as with the Alien, Bladerunner and Apocalypse Now Blu Rays, or at least have some sort of pop-up setting that compares original scenes with newer ones, but no such thing is included here.

The only part of this set I really do not like is the ""Spoofs"" section, which for me wore thin after only a few minutes and doesn't even include some of the best early Star Wars spoofs like ""Hardware Wars"" from the late '70's or Carrie Fisher's hilarious 1978 SNL appearance. Also, while the packaging of the discs is ok, the artwork on this set is truly strange, even amateurish. I'm not sure what they were thinking when this art was chosen for the first-ever release of all six Star Wars Episodes together. Why not use some of Ralph McQuarrie's or Doug Chiang's concept art, keeping with the theme of the retro-documentaries included on disc 9?

I have yet to watch the ""Star Warriors"" documentary, so I'll post thoughts about that some other time.

Overall, I think this is a fine Blu Ray set of all six Star Wars movies, and there is a ton of material included for the price. Although some of the additions or ""Special Edition"" changes to the movies have proven to be controversial to many fans, they really just don't bother me that much.

Finally, I managed to find time to view the entire Star Wars Saga from start to finish in number order, from The Phantom Menace to Return of the Jedi, to see how it all works out as one epic chronological story. I found myself deeply involved in the story and characters in ways I hadn't anticipated. I saw and heard character and plot twists and development in an entirely new and refreshing light. When it was all said and done, my least favorite Episodes were I and VI, but they do make solid bookends to the entire story, which is still full of life and imagination to this now 40-something viewer.",1316995200,10,4732,4.585106382978723
7220737,4,B00YI71PN2,"There are only two changes in this movie that bother me: Greedo shooting first, and Darth Vader shouting ""Nooo"" when he kills the Emperor in ROTJ.  This amounts to less than 10 seconds of film in a series that runs nearly 13 hours.  For me, that's not enough reason to just discard the whole product.  The picture is great, the sound is great, and it's loaded with some great extras.

The final disc, Documentaries and Spoofs, could have been better.  Only a few of the spoofs are funny, and they are not separated in chapters, so you can't jump to the particular one that you want to see.  It would also have been nice to see the ""Empire of Dreams"" documentary included.",1316995200,15,671,4.459016393442623
7220738,3,B00YI71PN2,"I originally posted this review with the caption ""make a stand!"" and asked people to consider not buying this set until the long-time fans get what they want - remastered, unaltered, Blu-ray versions of the classic trilogy.  The general response was agreement or criticism of not being adaptable to the changes (the latter is obviously from a younger crowd).  However, like a sucker I still bought this set, albeit at the lowest price I could get it and I used a gift certificate.

I originally wrote: ""While this box set contains the complete Star Wars Blu-ray series, I can't settle for less when it comes to how George Lucas has butchered the classic trilogy. Especially since he only directed the first movie! Until this very eccentric, stubborn, yet creative man gives in and gives us what we want - a cleaned up, unaltered original trilogy on Blu-ray, than I have to make a stand.""

The part that intrigued me the most was to see the deleted scenes from the classic trilogy, which I have seen a few (low res), and heard or seen pictures of others.  Seeing them was cool, however, even one of the deleted scenes is altered now too (see Luke lighting his new lightsaber at the beginning of ROTJ - never happened, just built it and didn't turn it on...and Vader was NOT calling out to Luke - those are outtake images and voiceovers from ESB).

I further wrote ""It's amazing that the man responsible for such an iconic cinematic creation is also responsible for its fall from grace. George Lucas - thank you for Star Wars, but give the fans what they want - the original trilogy (now in the Blu-ray format) just how we remembered it. Include the real deleted scenes, and make a better cover art...the current cover is terrible. The prequels over time have proven to be terrible and not true to what we learned in the classic trilogy, but ""Revenge of the Sith"" was strong overall. I will not buy these movies AGAIN and AGAIN, and I ask all of those that feel the same to make a stand until we get what we want and deserve - the original trilogy that we grew up with, visually cleaned up, with outstanding Blu-Ray picture and sound. Thank you.""

There are the aggravating changes that are inserted into the classic trilogy, specifically the Greedo/Han confrontation, this absurd wall that now covers R2 from the Sand People, the goofy drive-through at Mos Eisley, stepping on Jabba's tail, etc from Star Wars.  I thought I heard the lightsaber effects would be cleaned up, but Luke's training scene with the seeker is as bad as its always been.  The movie still works great despite the few cringe-worthy additions.  With Empire, it's the bad matching of the new Wampa while Luke struggles to get to his lightsaber; the sound does not mesh with the picture - see Luke running away from the Wampa with his lightsaber still lit, but you can hear it being turned off.  Having seen the original movies so often I notice all the changes even to the audio - changing Boba Fett's voice was reprehensible; the guy's voice from the prequels sounds cheesy.  During the escape from Bespin, the change from the white walls to windows does not match well, but the biggest offense of all was this unnecessary trek of Vader back to the Executor.  We all understand when he originally said ""bring my shuttle"" that he was leaving.  I do like the new shot of him walking across the platform to the shuttle, but the ensuing flight to his ship and arrival at his Star Destroyer chops up the flow of Luke's rescue from the underbelly of Cloud City.  It is absolutely absurd that they went further to show Vader arriving in the docking back which is directly from ROTJ and then a different angle of him coming down the ramp.  Inane.  On top of all this, why is George Lucas making these changes to a movie he did not direct??  With the exception of these absurdities, the movie still retains what makes it the best of the series.  I'm not going there with ROTJ, the movie was bad in so many areas as it is and it got worse with the revisions, but the movie still has its good moments.

Overall, besides the terrible cover art, the box set is creatively put together, although it's difficult to get the disks out.  It's good to see all the extras, and the classic movies look much better in this format - it's kind of like seeing at the movie theater where you can see all of the facial expressions and details better.  The prequels look good in HD, a lot of it is CG stuff anyway so it should.  I'll skip over the first two prequels which over time I went from thinking they're ok to terrible, but the Darth Maul duel scenes are awesome.  ""Revenge of the Sith"" looks real good and just suffers on its own in areas with bad dialogue and unnecessary cheesiness.

So I was a sucker and bought the (classic) movies again (the sixth time I think).  For the price I paid it was ok, but I would still like to see the classic trilogy remastered and in Blu-ray.",1316995200,19,4929,4.503928170594837
7220739,5,B00YI71PN2,"Look, it's Star Wars finally on Blu-Ray.  The highest definition possible to date.  All those anal fan boys who gave this one star because they're upset Lucas didn't personally call them to be sitting next to him as critics for the enhancement changes need to get a life!  He is simply trying to enhance things with present day technology that simply wasn't available decades ago.

Is it perfect?  Nope.  If you're looking for perfection, go make a film yourself so the rest of us can laugh at your works.  So Vader now says ""No"" at the sight of his son being killed . . . ""Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!"".  Get a grip.  This detracts from nothing, except the absurd ego's of anal fan boys who want what they want or they'll hold their breath.  Yawn.

Bottom line, this is still the Star Wars saga.  The greatest saga yet in the Sci-Fi genre.  It's in Blu-Ray, the highest resolution available.  Relax and enjoy it.

The tv we use to watch them on is a 40 inch Samsung lcd and we have a surround sound setup as well.  They look and sound simply amazing.  I was born in 87 so I was pretty young when episode one came out, and I have always enjoyed it.  I've never hated these movies as the die hard star wars fans do, but how can you be a die hard fan of you don't enjoy the prequels....they are apart of the universe that is Star Wars.  To me they are riveting and they tell the story of how Darth Vader came to be, which is a pretty awesome story if you like Star Wars.  These movies are some of the best looking Blu Rays in my collection not to brag but I have a decent one going.  if you haven't already pick yourself up a copy, you won't regret it.  And as for Amazon SOMEONE in your department is opening up merchandise , WATCHING it and re packaging it.  PLEASE find out who this is.

7220742,4,B00YI71PN2,"Ever since i purchased a blu ray player, i've anticipated this star wars release.  i love the films and have viewed or purchased every vhs and dvd release.  i always thought this complete set blu ray release would be the be all end all release that would allow me to finally purge my video center of my star wars collection.  this release lived up to my hope...almost.

When revenge of the sith first opened in theaters i was fortunate enough to see it in IMAX.  i was completely blown away by the film.  not just the story, but the visual presentation as well.  the star wars universe came alive on that screen.  i purchased the DVD the first day it came out, put it in the dvd player, sat back and was thoroughly disappointed by what i saw.  it wasn't the same film.  when watching the blu ray version, i saw the same film i saw in the imax theater.  just an absolutely amazing film!

the biggest surprise, however, was watching Attack of the Clones, a movie heavily criticized for its presentation when it was released in theaters.  Attack of the Clones has always been one of my favorite movies, but i understood the criticism.  the actors always looked like props in a digital world.  well, with the blu ray release, that criticism is no longer valid.  the blu ray format successfully integrates all aspects of the film into a beautiful, cohesive presentation.  the end result is a much better film.  i felt as if i was watching episode 2 for the first time.  the film is so crisp and clearly presented that you could spend the entire film only paying attention to the background and still have a very enjoyable experience.  the scene that best articulates this is the scene when anakin and obi wan walk into the sports bar.  you can clearly see every character and what they are doing.

with the release of the original trilogy, george lucas proved he was ahead of his time.  with the release of the blu ray set, lucas proves he was once again ahead of his time with episodes 1-3.  the vhs and dvd releases were not adequate formats for the vast star wars universe on display in episodes 1-3.  it took the blu ray format to make lucas's vision really come through.

as for episodes 4-6, the blu ray release is a disappointment.  while the format finally brings together all aspects of episodes 1-3, it has the opposite effect for episodes 4-6.  yes, the picture quality is better...but that's the problem.  for starters, the added scenes from the special edition release look really out of place against the background of the entire scene.  and there are many scenes where the picture quality is so clear, it's completely obvious you are looking at a model against a space backdrop.  of the three films, Return of the Jedi transfers to blu ray the best.  but the scene where luke and leia are on speeders on the endor moon looks so fake it's comical.  you can tell they are stationary against a moving picture behind them.  a new hope transfers the worst to blu ray.  the magic of the star wars films has always been that they look real.  with episodes 4-6, most of the scenes look fake on blu ray.  but this is true for other films as well.  blu ray is a wonderful new format and some older films can transfer to this format and look better, while some transfer and look worse.  surprisingly for me, the original star wars films look worse.

with this release, lucas, i hope, has finally finished releasing the star wars movies.  for me, the definitive star wars collection consists of the following six discs:  episodes 1-3 on blu ray and episodes 4-6 on dvd.  give me these six discs and i am forever a happy person!",1316908800,13,3625,4.50384024577573

7220746,5,B00YI71PN2,"I don't usually write reviews on Amazon. But because of all the one star reviews written by extremist fan boys, before this set even came out, I feel compelled to do so. I don't even know why these people call themselves Star Wars fans to begin with. Most of them only like the first two films. The don't like Jedi or the prequels. To me it's just crazy the way they act and I'm 39 and a life long Star Wars fan. I dare you to find anybody who likes these movies more than me. But I don't dress up like the characters or have rooms and rooms of merchandise. I just love the films.

To address the changes first for the Blu-rays, they're mostly minor tweaks. Hardly noticeable, except for the change of theYoda puppet in The Phantom Menace to a CGI character. But now he matches the Yoda from the other two prequels. Darth Vader's ""No!"" in the context of Jedi actually, to my surprise, makes the scene more dramatic. But all of that drama about these tweaks in much ado about nothing. They don't change the impact of the movies. They don't change the story. It should also be noted that this set has broke records in Blu-ray sales, despite what naysayers predicted. And I find these attacks on George Lucas to be childish.

Now, as for the picture and sound quality. The 1080p HD transfers are better than I've seen the movies look. They look crisp and I saw details I've never seen before on my Samsung 1080p LCD. My Sony home theater system got a work out with the new DTS-HD soundtracks.

As for the bonus material, I haven't had a chance to watch all of it yet, but the deleted scenes and vintage TV specials are all I needed. The rest is just icing on the cake.

So, if you love these movies and love watching movies in HD, I highly recommend them.",1316908800,21,1752,4.316109422492401

You will se a huge difference, like watching a totally different movie.  The vewing experience will be improved 100%. Images are clear, crisp and become more vivid!  However, without any up-conversion, the box set quality and clarity looks much better than the DVD counterpart!

In a different note, I did noticed that there are a bunch on negative reviews, and the mayority are prior to the box set release. How can someone objectvely review something that he or she has not seen yet? My suggestion is to watch the movie objectively FIRST, then make a comment.  I just see a bunch of heresay, without facts, comments based only on rumors and speculations!

This reminds me of the various blogs and comments about the iPhone 5, were people express their opinions with no concrete evidence or facts, specially the phone can still be chaneged as we speak!  This will be a pointless discussion, nevertheless, people do it!  The same happened here, blah blah blah without a single shread of evidence!

On the other hand, to our likeness or not, Mr. Lukas is the owner of the intelectual property of these movies and as such he has all the legal and moral rights to do as he sees fit with these movies!  We either enbrace it or we dont.  I have seen every Star Wars movie as they were released and seen all the changes as they were made.  But all the changes made, enhance the movie, take the viewing experience to the 21st century.  And if you pay close attention, the message and the escence of Star Wars is not lost; Good will triumph over evil.... These movies still trasend the changes that were made. Therefore, that's why they are and will allways remain classics!  If it was for some peple here, we will still travel in horse and carriage!  If technology can remaster and allow the box set to be better, why not?

If people like the original versions good, the still have the VHS to enjoy enjoy and cherish! This is like The Beatles catalog being degitalized and then remastered.  You will allways have the purist and misconformed whom will say that the original lp's with their clicks and clacks sounded better!  No problems, stay in the analog era or jump to the digital era, your choice!  Regardless of analog, digital or remastered the message remins the same... All you need is Love...

Clear your mind and watch the Box Set as if you were seen it for the first time, or pure fun and entratainment!

The HD Picture of all 6 films is awesome. It preserves the theatrical release quality of color and detail of each film. It's just like I remember if not BETTER! Also it's certified in THX meaning this is how George Lucas intended the film to too look on Blu-ray!

Writers rewrite books for any number of reasons -- 20 years after its first publication, Owen Wister edited ""The Virginian"" to reflect changed judgements of what was acceptable language.

I have no objection to changes that improve a film technically, or add things that were not possible during the original production -- but I do object to changes that alter its substance, such as Han firing in defense, rather than (technically) murdering Greedo. I'm surprised that Lucas STILL hasn't fixed the Arabic numbers in Luke's scanner. Amazing.

I have little to add to the comprehensive comments made by others, except to say that Episode IV has never looked so good. And I discovered that John Ratzenberger appears in Episode V. (He's the officer in gray behind Princess Leia.)

Other than adding a scene in which Jar-Jar is slowly crushed by a steamroller with a spiked wheel, there is little that could be done to improve these films. Episodes III, IV, and V are worth repeated viewing, and justify the (discounted) purchase price.

PS: I just watched Episode VI. It's better than I remembered -- the opening half hour is marvelously comic-booky, and a high point of the series -- and the Ewoks aren't /quite/ so annoying as I remembered. But they are a major irritation -- they look like what they are, dwarfs in Very Bad costumes (the fabric backing often wrinkles badly), and Lucas's desire to show a stone-age people defeating laser-armed soldiers makes no sense.

7220759,5,B00YI71PN2,"Unlike some, I've actually watched all six episodes, before writing this review.  I will try to keep it short.

The sound in all six episodes is superb.  The video quality of all episodes has been enhanced and special attention has been given to color and object texture.  To be fair, episodes IV,V and VI, while greatly improved, they show their age a bit in some sequences where the background is somewhat grainy.  I've had every version of Star Wars that has been released, and this is by far, superior to all the others.

Now, to address some of the nit-picking I've seen in some reviews.  I have no clue why anyone is up in arms about light sabre colors.  They looked fine to me.  About the much debated NOOOO in episode VI, I'm fine with it and felt it was very appropriate for the following reason.  The NOOOO in episode III represented the last emotion of Anakin Skywalker, and the NOOOO in episode VI represents the emotion at the return of Anakin Skywalker.  As far as the CGI rocks in front of R2D2 that disappear later in the scene, it is a minor continuity error, but not a big deal.  After all,we've all witnessed Han Solo being flash frozen with his hands tied together, but the ""wall hanging"" of him has his hands at shoulder level facing forward, with nothing tying them.

Looking at the background, there's pixilizations in the backgrounds. Also, I remember Lucas saying (over & over) that the Cantina scene wasn't what he wanted. Well, I have to say after standing in line in 1977 and seeing this film COUNTLESS times, it is time to re-do it. The Cantina scene needs to be redone, omitting some of the masked creatures and adding some more interesting CGI ones. Also, the Falcon's engine lights still haven't been corrected (have other fans noticed they change from blue to white), AND if Ben gave Luke his Father's lightsaber (Vader's in essence, from #3), then WHY is it WHITE?
Yes, I AM a HUGE fan of the original- so I say for the next release, PLEASE release the ORIGINAL versions, then release more tweaked ones also. That way the fans will actually HAVE the ultimate editions!
It's going to take me a while to get through ALL the 9 blu ray discs, but they did a fairly good job on #4 (what the original fans consider to be the first). The picture DOES still need tweaking, but the sound IS the best as I've heard in ALL the versions. I WAS impressed by the picture quality, but would I say it's the best it CAN be? No- like I mentioned, there still are pixilizations here & there- mainly in the darker scenes and in the background shots (sky, etc).

As far as the changes that Lucas has made in the blu-ray versions, I barely noticed them and I honestly thought they were for the better. They really have no impact on the plot of the movie and shouldn't be fussed over. Also, this set comes with about 2 days of bonus features (40 hours actually), which makes it completely worth it.

As for my boyfriend, he's a connoisseur & could not contain his amazement at the incredibly heightened quality & excitement about some of the changes. This is a must-have for any Star Wars fan, period. You might even introduce someone else to it who never thought they'd sit thru something of this caliber.",1316822400,16,707,4.664
7220765,5,B00YI71PN2,"The movies have never looked better. People have been unfairly giving this set bad review out of bias because a couple things have changed. Sure he added some sounds, Vader yelling no(which makes sense when you watch it)and blinking Ewoks. None of these changes make the movies any less enjoyable. The sound quality of the movies is perfect. The set also comes with 90 minutes of spoofs which i found very enjoyable to watch. The bottom line is that this is one of the best movie box sets out there. The first review on the amazon is over a page long and he complains about changes and canceled his order. In other words he does not own the Blu-ray. That review is bias and should be removed as he does not own the set. I'm sure many of the other reviews are from people also who do not own the set and just wanted to hurt the movies sells because of a couple minor changes. If you don't like the set because of the changes, don't buy it, and don't leave a review on something you don't plan on purchasing. I hope this added a little sanity to all those negative reviews.",1316822400,15,1071,4.306930693069307

Today, when I tried to play the rest episode 3, a red screen poped up, telling me to update my blu ray player! My blu ray player is very updated! My question is: WHY ON EARTH, this disc can be played a week before, but can not be player later on?",1316822400,13,354,3.7972972972972974
7220767,4,B00YI71PN2,"Forget the 1 star reviews whining about ""this isn't the old school version"". It never was intended to be, it never will be. Don't like it? Don't buy it. Most of these came from individuals well before the product came out anyways, and shouldn't even be qualified as reviews. That said:

I've been a SW fan for years. I STILL remember going to Seattle to see the originals in theater (in the original format, not the new release), and love the series. One of my biggest concerns was that the originals would be 'grainy' or lose picture quality. Not so, and that's a good thing.

The sound and video quality on ALL of these is excellent. Of course, I'd expect nothing less from one of the standard bearers in the industry.
The special features (to me) were kind of lacking, and many of them in horrible quality video. No worries, I didn't buy the set because of special features, but that does knock it down a bit.
The packaging of this product, well, let's just say it's horrible. THIS is how discs get damaged, scratched, printed up. While it was a somewhat decent idea, forcing individuals to grab the discs by the inside of the disc itself (as opposed to grabbing them by the outside of the disc like you should) causes damage to discs. Great for marketing, I guess, I mean you damage a disc, it's got to be replaced, right?",1316822400,9,1326,4.475206611570248
7220768,3,B00YI71PN2,"I have just finished watching the first three movies in this set. The first and third seem fine, but the second one has frequent audio dropouts - sound just stops for a fraction of a second. It's really quite annoying. I hope Fox reissues this disc and makes a free replacement of it for us.",1316822400,3,291,4.3090909090909095
7220769,5,B00YI71PN2,"Despite the alarming widespread dissent of the diehard fans, the Star Wars saga on Blu-Ray has shattered records to become the best-selling Blu-ray release ever. I pre-ordered mine (along with a Sony Blu-ray player) from BB and have now watched all of the feature films in the set, and I have to say that this set is simply amazing.

I found it pretty humorous reading all the ""reviews"" on Amazon and elsewhere whining and ranting about George Lucas's changes to the films (specifically the original trilogy) PRIOR to the the set's release. I watched the films very carefully  with my tablet in front of me opened to a page with a great in depth guide  to all the changes (google ""dvd active star wars the changes""). Surprisingly there are actually very few MAJOR changes in terms of new or altered scenes--far less than the DVD Special Edition release--and most of them (imho) are positive. The only changes that pissed me off were Obi-Wan's ""dragon call"" on Tatooine and the entirely pointless and horribly choreographed new scene with Jabba confronting Han Solo in Mos Eisley (both in Episode IV, the latter actually added for the SE DVD's but ""improved"" for the Blu-Ray release). The lightsabers in the Original Trilogy don't always look right, but they're supposedly improved from prior releases.

The picture quality for all of the films is absolutely AMAZING. The first three films (prequel trilogy) especially look gorgeous. EVERY single time there was an environmental shot of Coruscant I would stare in awe at how beautiful and detailed it looked. The sound quality (I have a 5.1 setup) is equally superb across all 6 films. I've only looked at the bonus disk for the prequel films, but they're nearly equally as amazing as the films themselves and are brimming with extra content in HD. Unfortunately, the bonus disks lack the trailers seen in the DVD releases.

Overall, this is a MUST HAVE purchase if you own a Blu-Ray player (I bought one for my TV so I wouldn't have to use my laptop). Even at the original $129.99 msrp it's a buy, but at the $79.99 most retailers are selling it for it's an absolute steal. Let the fanboys whine, since they're missing out on an awesome product. May the force be with you.",1316822400,14,2222,4.761038961038961
7220770,4,B00YI71PN2,"I saw Star Wars back in 77. I was in college and the movie was a sensation. I have bought many versions of the movie and seen them in the theater many times. The blu rays are very good. Most will enjoy seeing them again with such great sound and picture. They wii give your home system a good workout whatever it is. Four stars and not five-the set could have been like Blade Runner set and shown all versions of the movies. Having said that, I don't mind the changes Lucas has made, and even like many of them. Great set-highly recommend.",1316822400,10,539,4.242718446601942
7220771,1,B00YI71PN2,"It's really simple, George. You first released Star Wars: A New Hope in 1977. That film made you a bajillion dollars then and in the years after. Ditto for the original releases of ESB and ROTJ. Maybe you hate them now. Maybe you wake up late at night, screaming incoherently, drenched in sweat, tortured over the hell you created in 1977+. Well, too bad. Suck it up. You became a billionaire thanks to fans who watched your films in 1977+, not '97, 2004, whatever. I'm going to be that guy and say it, you OWE US the originals. Period. End of discussion. Why? Because those are the films that made you rich, that we loved growing up. The films we paid for in 1977+. So, yes, George you friggin' douchebag, you OWE US those films.

The thing is fans didn't want this set; they wanted something else. But this is what he put out. And in an ultimate ironic twist, George Lucas will sell you now that which you don't want (the butchered original trilogy plus the other three crappy prequels) But hey, they're all on HD!

Will we resist? Or will we flock to the stores and to the online retailers, and buy it grudgingly, but buy it nevertheless?

Beautiful case, with noticeably better picture quality that the older versions (as of now I have only watched I-III, so I can't comment on the originals). I haven't gotten into the extras yet either, but now it's an easy 5-star.",1316736000,9,315,4.833333333333333
7220774,5,B00YI71PN2,It is great! Picture quality looks awesome on all movies but best on the prequals IMO. That is to be expected since they are newer and filmed digitally. Changes don't bother me and to tell you the truth I don't really notice them cause I haven't watched the movies hundreds of times as the hardcore fans may. In fact I have only seen the originals once probaly and they are like watching new movies to me so I have enjoyed this set a lot. I also like the prequals more then the originals. They are more modern and have better effects. Plus I love the pod race scene and JarJar unlike most people. Not to mention the originals came out before I was born. And no I am not a kid I am 28. I think the originals spend too much time in space or on the same planet where the prequals we are takin to lots of different worlds through out the movies. Although I hate seeing Anikin turn to the dark side as watching the first 2 episodes you grow to like him. But I still love all 6 movies and now that they are Blu Ray it doesn't get any better. Totally worth the purchase! Stop being so picky about small changes that don't even effect the story. It is still Star Wars.,1316736000,9,1160,4.1371681415929205

I have the original VHS, and bought the retread VHS in the late 90's.  Fine.  My biggest disappointment was I bought the DVD of the original trilogy in 2004.  Much to my dismay...the escape scene from the Death Star by the Millenium Falcon you can Still see the off color black boxes around the ships! And a mere 4 years later, another DVD release that also includes the original releases in additon to the updates as well.  I understand the 'updates' and 'tweaking' by lucas...  But this new Blu-ray series without the 'original' collection??  I'll wait.  And it MUST include all these extras too!  Fool me once.... (and twice)....Not again!",1316736000,5,814,4.629370629370629
7220776,5,B00YI71PN2,"OK. There are a lot of people criticizing the film. I don't see their arguments. I've watched the film, and with the enhanced sound, it is truly incredible. I've been a fan since my wife and I saw Episode IV in theaters in the late 70's.

What irritates me is the constant whining about little things people want changed. I hate it. Referring to my title, I've listened to it, since the Episodes I-III hit theaters. They are great movies. And I enjoy this latest release, just like I did the VHS releases, the DVD releases and now this one. I hope I live long enough to see one of these people, who seem to know so much, attempt to create a movie. When you do, just develop coping skills for the army of people, who have nothing better to do than to don Star Wars uniforms and sit in front of a TV.

7220777,1,B00YI71PN2,"This release had the potential to be something wonderful. We could finally have all the magic of Star Wars with the advances of more modern HD technology. Lucas has become obsessed with visual effects, so you'd think this update would be right up his alley. Sadly, he took this opportunity to change the original trilogy again, and add in more crap that just makes the movies worse. Beyond that, the updates to visuals could have been a tad better as well.",1316736000,22,456,4.6419753086419755
7220778,1,B00YI71PN2,I don't believe it takes anything more than that to review any release of Star Wars that does not use the original theatrical version of events. Shame on George Lucas for failing to practice what he preached and butchering these movies. Shame on anyone that buys these and continues to support these abominations.,1316736000,25,313,4.9245283018867925
7220779,5,B00YI71PN2,"I have seen each Star Wars movie in the theater when it first came out, and have enjoyed them all tremendously. So now here they are on Blu-Ray, looking and sounding better than ever before.

Part of the fun (for me) is that with each release in each new medium, Lucas et al. continue tinkering with (and, IMO, improving--for the most part, anyway) the movies, allowing me and mine to enjoy these movies--which I've seen way too many times--with new eyes. So for the interested fellow customer, here's a list of changes (for as far as I've been able to spot them) that have been introduced compared to the previous DVD releases. This list is undoubtedly incomplete, so feel free to notify me of omissions or errors.

The Phantom Menace.
- Puppet Yoda has been replaced with a digital Yoda which better resembles the Yoda in the other movies.
- Most of the movie's shots, except some at the beginning, have a slightly wider framing. Looks gorgeous.
- new effect when Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan speed away from the destroyer droids.
- the shot where the Neimoidians are watching Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan on their viewscreen is now a wider shot, clarifying that it is, indeed, a viewscreen.
- In Palpatine's office, his collar no longer changes color between shots.
- The hand of the two-headed podrace announcer has been fixed.
- ""Vote now! Vote now!"" in the Senate has been turned down in the audio mix, and various cries in other languages have been added.

Attack of the Clones.
- the scene where Anakin and Obi-Wan fly through the power couplings has been edited slightly differently, as has the ending of the Yoda/Dooku fight when Dooku escapes.
- the Kamino scenes now look less bright and have a greenish tint over them.
- The scene where Anakin has a nightmare about his mother now has added audio of his mother crying ""Anakin! Help me!"", by actress Pernilla August. (Sounds OK, but it does take away a bit from the Oedipal subtext that I assumed this scene was supposed to convey. Though maybe that's why they added it in the first place.)

Revenge of the Sith.
- The rooftop of the dwelling from which Yoda watches the Kashyyyk beach battle now has moss growing over it, making it look more organic.
- The transition to Anakin on Mustafar is now a wipe again, as it was in the theatrical version.

A New Hope.
- The audio issues that plagued the DVD have largely been fixed or reduced. For instance, the noticeable jumps in audio quality during the Leia/Tarkin dialogue have been fixed. Some issues remain, though--perhaps those things can't be fixed.
- Lightsaber colors have, in a number of shots, been fixed. In a number of other shots (e.g., on the Falcon), they haven't... which could be intentional on the part of Lucas et al.
- The hatch of the escape pod is now grey rather than blue ... Except in the scene where the stormtroopers find it. Go figure.
- Aunt Beru now says ""Tell your uncle"" instead of ""Tell uncle"".
- Digital rocks have been added over R2-D2 when he's hiding from the Sand People.
- Obi-Wan's cry when scaring away the Sand People is different again--and more prominent in the sound mix.
- The Han/Greedo shootout is edited tighter.
- During the Death Star escape, a laser blast from the Falcon no longer appears mid-air.
- The ""humdinger glitch"" has been fixed.
- When Luke climbs out of his X-Wing at the end, he now yells ""Hey!"" to Leia, instead of ""Hey ya!"" (or ""Carry!"").

The Empire Strikes Back.
- The Wampa snowmonster's arm has been fixed. In previous versions, you could see the operating pole in the lower left corner of the screen.
- Added reflection to the window in Cloud City through which we see Leia pacing.
- Sparks have been added to the fireplace where Chewbacca finds C-3PO, and its color has changed.

Return of the Jedi.
- The gate to Jabba's palace is now much larger.
- Slightly altered effects when the Carbonite melts away from Han.
- A dug (i.e., a member of Sebulba's species) has been added to Jabba's palace.
- A new shot of Han accidentally hitting Boba Fett's jetpack has been added.
- The Ewoks now have eyes that blink.
- When R2 goes haywire after being shot, several effects have been added. (Others have been removed--he doesn't ""urinate"" any more).
- Light saber colors have been corrected.
- The amorphous animated black spots on the sides of Palpatine's face (presumably to hide the makeup rubbing off on the costume) have been corrected.
- Darth Vader now goes ""No ... noo!!"" when he sees Luke being tortured by Palpatine.

That's it, as far as I can tell; apart from these changes and the improved A/V quality, the movies are similar as they appeared on DVD. That is, ""Jedi Rocks"" still sucks (though to be fair, so did ""Lapti Nek""), as does the shot of the Executor crashing into the Death Star. Jar Jar still annoys in most of the scenes he's in (though I've mostly come to accept him)... And we still don't know why Han never bothered to pay off Jabba in the three years between ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"", why the rebels didn't use that ion cannon on the Imperial walkers, why Luke didn't bring down the remaining Imperial walkers by just climbing up to them and throwing a bomb into them, why the Empire's initial attack plan was aerial bombardment, why Luke needed to be ""frozen"" for his journey to the Emperor, why Vader didn't keep an eye on Jabba's place waiting for Luke to appear, and so on, and so forth .... but, maybe those issues will be fixed in a later edition.
(Just kidding, obviously.)

As a side note, the documentaries are very informative. I found it surprising just how much of the prequel trilogy was done with models, and how much greenscreen was used in the original trilogy.",1316736000,14,5682,4.579154375614553
7220780,1,B00YI71PN2,"I don't get how people defend George Lucas.  They say he created these films and he can do what he wants with them.  Lucas says he did not have the budget or technology to make the movies how we envisioned,  I guess I can see that. But something I don't understand.  He didn't have the technology to make Greedo shoot first?  Didn't have technology to have Darth Vader yell Noooo?  Didn't have technology to make Ben Kenobi sound like a little girl?  Didn't have technology to make the song in Jabba's palace suck?  What does that have to do with technology?  As a Beatles fan,  I love the B-side of Abbey Road.  Imagine Paul McCartney put a new song in there, totally screwing with the awesome medley.  Steven Spielberg should go back and make a new shark for Jaws, totally CGI.  Make him do back flips or put a scene in where he fights a giant squid and all sorts of crazy things.  I'm sure he didn't have the technology he wanted in 1975, but that is how movies work. Go back and change Charlton Heston's wig and beard in Ten Commandments. Add a scene in It's A Wonderful Life showing Clarence getting his wings and flying all over the universe. The possibilities are endless.  Maybe in few years he can go back and take out the kiss between Luke and Leia because it promotes incest.",1316736000,25,1286,4.389830508474576
7220781,5,B00YI71PN2,"The prequels are the biggest and most welcome surprise in this set. Massive, massive, massive improvements to the picture particularly in better marrying the multitude of elements within the frame. That is to say, digital elements are merged much more gracefully with practical elements. Furthermore, these elements look more like they were physically photographed on set. No, it is not perfect and totally seamless in this regard, but the improvement is light-years beyond previous releases. Clearly, there are improvements that will go largely unnoticed by the average viewer's conscious mind while still registering as marked improvement even if one is not able to put their finger on exactly what or why. The prequels, photographically speaking, have been dialed into a look that is parallel to the 'look' of the original films. This improvement lends these prequels a legitimacy that was absolutely NOT there previously. Visually it appears as if a hazy filter has been lifted from in front of the camera revealing, well, Star Wars movies. There is now a clarity to the overall picture to which the eye is much more receptive allowing the viewer to more fully take in the richness of Lucas' grand illusion. One could liken this enrichment to the new life afforded a film experience by taking in a widescreen presentation after being well familiarized with years of pan & scan. The money spent on these Blu-Rays by the consumer is onscreen for sure. Enjoy.",1316736000,11,1460,5.0875
7220782,1,B00YI71PN2,"The movies themselves are awesome. The way they did the bonus features is a HUGE let down. You start off being warned that they used the most current blueray disc technology. If your system isn't current then it won't work right. Well I do have the most recent release and things are till borked! There are a million menus to flip through and each time it takes forever for the new menu to come up. There are menus buried within menus buried within menus. By the time you get to the feature you want to look at there's more menus. There's no play all just more menu items to chose what to play. THIS IS A MAJOR PAIN IN THE TOUKUS! Once you make your way through this maze to watch 30 seconds of  let down.... you now get to proceed back through all the previous menus to get back to chose another path of mazes. You can try and use the top menu feature... when I tried the whole thing froze up. After getting so frustrated I wanted to burn the whole set, I went and saw if Sony had an update I missed...  but there's not. I basically wasted 100$ on this set. I had all the movies but looked forward to the special features in this set.... Live and learn I guess!",1316736000,16,1162,4.16
7220783,4,B00YI71PN2,"Star Wars Blu-ray box set

Packaging...  The box set is just beautiful, the best I've ever seen on a DVD set or Blu-ray.  A very well constructed hard cardboard case.  Open it up and there's an equally well made book, with nine flaps, each holding one of the nine disks.  I say again this is the nicest looking box set that I've ever seen.

Format...  All six movies have very good picture and sound.

Changes ... As far as I know that changes to Episode I The Phantom Menace...  They replaced Yoda with the digital one first seen in Episode II, which I think is an improvement for that particular movie.  And when Obi wan and Qui-gon first meet Darth-Maul, after Darth-Maul ignites is light saber he lets out a small growl.

Episode II Attack of the Clones ... For me a tie matching up with The Empire Strikes Back, this is the best one in this series.  When Anakin is having a nightmare about his mother, you hear her cries.  The scene where Duke who flies away on his air speeder near the end of the movie, the background behind him is cleaner and not as fake looking.

Episode III Revenge of the Sith...  As far as I saw there were no changes to this one at all.

Episode IV A New Hope...  As noted in the sand people seen R2. D2.  Is more surrounded by rocks when he is hiding is OK.  And the change they made to Obi Wan's  Crate Dragon call was terrible.  Other than that the movie is fine.
Episode V The Empire Strikes Back...  It was said in this one, the scene with the wampa getting his arm chopped off was fixed.  Matching this up with my previous DVD version, I really couldn't tell the difference.  Other than that the movie is perfect.

Episode VI Return of the Jedi...  Jobba's as door is bigger, so what.  The added alien walking around in Jobba's palace, was OK.  The ewoks eyes blinking were not that noticeable, except for wicke'ts in certain scenes.  And Vaders cries of NO... weren't as bad as you might think.  I did catch two scenes where there was a little bit of static heard in the background, checking that out with my previous DVD I noticed the crackling in that one too.  The only reason I think it's more noticeable on this one, is because Blu-ray is set up for better sound.

Final say, all six movies are good.  The only disappointment was obi Wan's crate dragon call in A New hope.

Special features...  All six movies practically have the same order of special features.  A couple interviews, deleted scenes, design and costume looks, clip art.  Although the behind the scenes features are excellent.  The clip art is just that.  The designs and costumes are nice; almost each one has a video documentary clip at the end.  The deleted scenes are the only things I didn't like, if you want better deleted scenes I would go with the previous box set.  The deleted scenes in the first three episodes are not completed, some of them are still being shot with their Annamaddix and blue screens.  To add a disappointing note, these are all new deleted scenes.  Either fewer or more than the previous set and not a single one is the same.  The one from Revenge of the Sith where Yoda lands on Dagobah isn't even in this one.  So the deleted scenes for the pre- trilogy, not that great.

The original movies have better scenes.  We finally get to see Luke looking up with his binoculars at the battling starships and where Biggs comes to meet him on Tatoine.  Like before most of these are unfinished scenes and rough cuts, but there a lot better.

And each movie has two audio commentaries.  The first by George Lucas and crew, the other is archival interviews with cast and crew.

Documentaries...  The making of Star Wars...  An original 1977 documentary, performed by R2. D2 and C3PO.

The Empire Strikes Back SPFX...  Original 1980 documentary. That shows the special effects of the Star Wars movies and other material.  Performed and narrated by Mark Hamill.

Classic Creatures: Return of the Jedi... 1983 documentary.  Looking at the monsters and creatures from the Star Wars movies and other classic films.  Performed and narrated by Carrie fisher and billy Dee Williams.

Anatomy of a Dueback...  1997 documentary.  Giving you a play by play of what they went through to create the special edition scenes.

Starr Warriors...  2007 documentary.  This documentary looks at the rose bowl parade, commemorating the 30th anniversary of Star Wars.

Star Wars Tech... 2007.  A look at how the Star Wars technology might or might not be real today.

A Conversation With The Masters: The Empire Strikes Back 30 Years Later...  George Lucas, Irvin Kerschner, john Williams and Lawrence Kasdan reflect on the film and what it meant to them.

Star Were Spoofs... 2011.  Multimedia television and Internet do their part in contributing to the Star Wars phenomenon.  For example...  Robot Chicken, Family Guy, The Simpsons, Weird Al Yankovic and more

On a sadder note, the things you do not get in this box set...  The original unchanged versions, theatrical trailers and the best documentary I've ever seen Empire Of Dreams.  In this I recommend you keep your old DVD box set.

In the long run I think this blue-ray is a pretty good buy.  It has its good points as well as it's bad, but doesn't everything.

A final comment to George Lucas...  Stopped fixing things that don't need to be fixed.  Why don't you digitally RE master A New Hope so that the storm trooper doesn't bump as head, or when the Tie Fighters are flying around the Millennium Falcon you can still see an outline of them added background.

Final comment to the upset fans...  Ever since 1997 when George Lucas released the special edition, he has been constantly making changes.  I really don't think the fans are upset because he keeps on making changes to these movies.  I think the fans are more exhausted with the fact that every time he makes a change he releases a new box set I think I speak for everybody out there when I say, George enough already",1316736000,10,5949,4.56980056980057
7220784,1,B00YI71PN2,"Star Wars is consistently on the top of the AFI (American Film Institute) list of one of greatest films of the 20th century.  I have only one question for the people that give five stars, for whatever reason, to this abominable set.

Which version of Star Wars do you think has been catalogued by the AFI?

If you give this set five stars because you grew up with the prequels then you need to educate yourself to realize the rigorous critique a film undergoes to even be reviewed let alone accepted by the AFI.  They would never accept anything other than a pristine unaltered print and neither should we.  Older fans who gave this five stars should hang their heads in shame.

Zero stars...",1316736000,24,692,4.540322580645161
7220785,5,B00YI71PN2,"With all of the outrage surrounding this release, I thought I would give my opinion, as a life-long Star Wars fan.

If you watch these movies chronologically (which I've yet to do), the additions to the blu-ray edition really make sense -- I'm specifically thinking of the ""NOOOOOOOOO"" and the Krayt Dragon call...

The sound in this release is absolutely breathtaking.  The hum of the lightsabers and the sounds of ships just blew me away.  I could care less about the video quality (which is disturbingly excellent) with sound like this!

If you're a fan of Star Wars and you have a decent surround sound system, you really owe it to yourself to give this release a chance.  You will definitely not regret it.",1316736000,9,711,4.693548387096774

All these changes are what he wanted but didn't have the tech to do it at the time. These are the best quality we will ever see these films in so be happy the changes are not really that big of a deal. Darth Vader looking at palpatine while he is killing his son and then basically saying enough is enough and screaming no actually was emotionally touching I loved it my wife cried when it happenend.

I've got a lot of blu-ray discs and this one is on spot.  Sometimes when you get an old movie on blu-ray the picture quality isn't there.  This movie had amazing quality.

As for all the people reviewing this movie low based on the minor changes, move out of your mother's basement, it's a movie....it doesn't change the outcome, you're idiots.",1316736000,9,473,4.465116279069767

We chose these two first to compare the different eras of SW films.  These were viewed on a Samsung 46"" LED TV and with a standard 5.1 surround setup.  The detail on both these films was beyond my most optimistic hopes.  We could make out the individual pores on all the actors' faces.  We could see tiny granules of make-up on Carrie Fisher.  The colors were vibrant and crisp.  Sound was equally impressive.  The synchronization of the dialogue to the actors' lip movements was perfect.  These Blu-rays have been meticulously re-mastered and the results are truly awesome.  The price is reasonable considering you are paying about $13 per movie.  Even if you own the DVDs, if you are a videophile and/or audiophile you owe it to you and your family to add this incredible set to your collection.",1316736000,7,927,4.695652173913044
7220791,5,B00YI71PN2,"Alright, everyone needs to calm down. I've been a fan since 1979 and although this collection didn't have everything I wanted (original theatrical release & digital copies), This collection looks amazing on Blu Ray.  I watched them with my daughter and she absolutely loved the movies.  I showed her the original trilogy and then we went back to watch the prequels.  So, before you completely dismiss this collection, trust me that you'll enjoy seeing them in HD and having George's definitive vision.  He actually ""improved"" the Han Solo/Greedo meeting in the Cantina and although Han didn't technically shoot first, it was recut to look a lot better than the previous version.  I was pleasantly surprised.  He actually gave in a little and listened to how awful it looked before.
Anyway, I really like having them all in one collection and you will too.  So stop complaining and ""give in to your feelings.""  And buy the set.",1316736000,7,926,4.891025641025641
7220792,5,B00YI71PN2,"I have a few conflicting opinions on this collection. First and foremost, I'm glad GL decided to bring this saga to Blu-ray (he sure took his sweet time). I am loving how much better, or rather, clean the movies look. That crisp look of Blu-ray is quite impressive. And I have yet to get to the 40 hours of bonus features... which I'm excited to see. What I am conflicted with, is how much a loathe GL's obsession with being a perfectionist. He seems to just not understand that the fans like what he did, making changes is not necessary, let alone wanted. What's worse is forcing those who want this saga on Blu-ray to have only the altered version and not let us have the unaltered is infuriating. However, with that said, my beef I have is with GL himself, not Star Wars. They're still fantastic movies, albeit somewhat tinkered with. I give this 5 stars for the fact that I love Star Wars and that's what this collection still is. Everyone marking this with 1 star has every right to feel that way, but shouldn't confuse the GL's work for GL himself. He deserves the poor rating, not this.",1316736000,3,1093,4.442786069651741

7220794,1,B00YI71PN2,"Right at the top: This is not a review of the whole box set.  I refuse to buy this on the grounds that Lucas is simply trying to grab as much cash as possible from the same product.  If this had included the ORIGINAL series with better picture and sound, I would own it, even with the craptastical prequels.  But no.

Instead, I borrowed the Deleted Scenes disc for SW, EMPIRE and JEDI.  This is a review of that, for those who, like me, would only purchase this set for that disc.

1.  It's a super-uber-new Blu Ray which takes a LONG time to load if you have an older Blu Ray player.  It took me an hour to watch fifteen or twenty minutes of material.
2. Even just from watching bits of clips, I can tell that the picture quality on the Blu Ray films is amazing.  The Deleted scenes have been cleaned up, but not to that crisp quality of the features.
3.  With the exception of the ROTJ lightsaber scene and sandstorm scene on Tatooine, there's nothing on here that an avid fan hasn't found on the web already.  And quite frankly, nothing on here is that interesting.  At all.  There's several angles of a Han-led assault on the Endor bunker with a fun ""scum?"" rebuttal from Solo, but that's about it.

Long story short, if you were looking forward to the Blu Rays for the bonus material and not Lucas's newest rogering of one of the greatest film series of all time, you can skip this.  You're better off re-watching the ""Empire of Dreams"" documentary.",1316649600,19,1455,4.356877323420075
7220795,4,B00YI71PN2,"First things first: the picture and sound quality for this set are unparalleled.  The improved quality was more noticeable with the original trilogy, but they're all a huge step up from their DVD counterparts.
So how about the films?

THE PHANTOM MENACE

A good space fantasy, but it lacks the charm of the originals.  Part of it is just because everyone's so young in this film; it takes place 33 years before A NEW HOPE, so nothing is too identifiable yet.  The special effects are fantastic, although at times it feels like we're watching a Pixar movie.  The digital characters look real enough, but sometimes they try too hard to draw attention to themselves, and I've noticed that most of the live-action heroes speak in monotone.  The story is also pretty complex, involving the hostile takeover of a planet by a greedy Trade Federation, and resolving the conflict in the Galactic Senate.  Those new to the STAR WARS universe might be a little confused if they start with EPISODE I, because ironically this one contains the most exposition.  Despite its flaws, the action elements make it feel like a STAR WARS film.  The lightsaber duels, the menagerie of alien creatures, the podrace, and the developing relationships of the characters make up for shallow acting and complexity.  The inclusion of the digital Yoda is a nice improvement from the stiff puppet that was originally used, making the character look consistent with the rest of the films.  That being said, as a prequel it's a more sophisticated story than the originals, and it does a nice job of setting up the rest of the saga.

ATTACK OF THE CLONES

A good sequel, finding more common ground with the original trilogy that it's foretelling.  We finally get to see its two primary heroes working beside each other as student and teacher, and we get our first glimpse of the Clone Wars that Ben Kenobi talked about in A NEW HOPE.  Again, the action scenes are first class: everything from the speeder chase on Coruscant, the fight with Jango Fett on Kamino, the asteroid field, and the Coliseum-like battle of Geonosis are true spectacles.  The highlight of the film, of course, is the Yoda/Count Dooku battle toward the end.  The atmospheric, cloudy mood of CLONES is a different pace for the series, but the air of mystery surrounding it makes for a diverse experience.  The one major flaw is the unbalanced romance between Padm and Anakin, which doesn't feel fleshed out enough.  Padm genuinely avoids Anakin's advances the entire film, and then suddenly tells him that she's fallen for him.  It's nowhere near as subtle as the Leia/Han romance in EMPIRE, and the dialogue they exchange is laughable.  Aside from that, it's better than MENACE, telling a more gripping story and providing a great set-up for EPISODE III.

REVENGE OF THE SITH

The title crawl says it all: it starts with the word WAR!  Virtually every scene is an eye-opener.  George Lucas tightened the script and created a story that is both engaging and dark, making it the most intense chapter in the saga.  There are tons of battle scenes that further move the story, and the emotional resonance of its performers is near-flawless.  The romance between Anakin and Padm is still rocky, but where the film really shines are the relationships it explores between Anakin, Obi-Wan and Palpatine.  Ian McDiarmid is cunning in his duel portrayal of a well-meaning chancellor and power-hungry Sith master.  The centerpiece: an epic lightsaber battle that takes place on an erupting volcanic planet.  This was the film STAR WARS fans were eagerly anticipating since the prequel trilogy's inception, and it delivers on all accounts.

A NEW HOPE

Considered a classic by fans and film historians, it tells the tale of a young moisture farmer, Luke Skywalker, who joins the Rebellion in its fight against the Galactic Empire.  Joining forces with a host of loveable characters, Luke rescues Princess Leia from the clutches of Darth Vader and leads an all-out Rebel attack against the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star.  The visual effects have always dazzled audiences, and while many fans see the additional tweaks over the years as major annoyances, they really don't interrupt the flow of a fantastic fantasy tale.
For the Blu-ray release, several changes include a modified krayt dragon call made by Ben Kenobi upon rescuing Luke from the Tusken Raiders; as well as the addition of digital rocks to better hide R2-D2 from the Tuskens' presence.  Neither of these changes detracted from the overall film, and they aren't as noticeable as the major effects overhaul undertaken in its 1997 re-release.  The infamous Han and Greedo confrontation has again been slightly altered, in which Greedo and Han shoot at the same time, restoring the scene to a more appropriate western shootout motif.
Despite the various changes, most of the film is left intact with some astonishing High Definition visuals and an always-stunning soundtrack.

THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK

The Rebels continue to evade the Empire across the trenches of space as Luke continues his Jedi training under the tutelage of wizened Jedi Master Yoda.  A romance blossoms between space smuggler Han Solo and the spunky Princess Leia, and Darth Vader reveals a startling secret.  The most important chapter in the STAR WARS saga looks infinitely better in this HD transfer, especially during the battle of Hoth.  The film has remained largely intact from the 2004 DVD version.  Of course, noticeable changes over the years have attempted to bridge EPISODE V with the prequel trilogy.  Hence for the 2004 release, the holographic Emperor was replaced with Ian McDiarmid, and Boba Fett's raspy voice was replaced with actor Temuera Morrison's, making the film more consistent with Boba's origin story.  Again, despite these revisions, the film is always a treat.

RETURN OF THE JEDI

The Emperor oversees the construction of a second Death Star as the Rebels go to the forest moon of Endor to disable its shield and launch an all-scale attack.  Luke faces Vader in an end-all confrontation, while the Rebels befriend a stalwart band of Ewoks.  The film only looks that much better in High Definition, especially given the space battle toward the end.  The major addition to this release is the added line given to Darth Vader at the end of the film, making him sound comparable to the way he did at the end of EPISODE III.  It's debatably a pointless addition, but it doesn't stop the rest of the film from being a true spectacle.  Other minor revisions include CG enhancements to Wicket's eyes (he can now blink), and the addition of a dug in Jabba's palace (the species of Sebulba from EPISODE I).  And yes, Hayden Christensen is still portrayed during the end sequence.
Bottom line: If you really love these movies, there's no reason not to have this set.  The minor additions throughout the series are just that: minor.  If you can get past that, they're still just as loveable as they were upon their initial release.  STAR WARS purists canceling their pre-orders because of a few added lines of dialogue are living in a fantasy world: George Lucas has declared on numerous occasions that he has no interest in releasing his abandoned movies in a clean format.  The individual DVDs, which come packaged with the theatrical films as an added bonus, are as close as you're going to get.  My advice: either dust off your VHS tapes, or find the individual DVDs.  But don't let the little graphical changes be your deciding factor in making a purchase: it's easy to overlook the five minutes of tweaks when you see for yourselves how great these films look.

Now on to the Bonus Features.

This is where true STAR WARS fans might be left out in the cold.  Considering the three extra discs, we really aren't given anything fresh to explore here.  The two archive discs merely contain short interviews regarding the behind-the-scenes of each trilogy, and most of the interviews detail how the art departments conceived the planets.  The deleted scenes are incomplete and at times painful to watch.  Most of the deleted scenes contained on the prequel disc are simply unfinished animatics and are nowhere near as polished as the deleted scenes on the DVD releases.
The third bonus disc is where you'll find all the classic STAR WARS documentaries, as well as 90 minutes of STAR WARS spoofs (namely clips from THAT 70'S SHOW, SNL, and THE SIMPSONS).  The most engaging featurette on this disc is A CONVERSATION WITH THE MASTERS: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK 30 YEARS LATER, in which director Irvin Kershner,  George Lucas and composer John Williams discuss the making of that particular film.  The behind-the-scenes documentaries are nice, but THE MAKING OF STAR WARS, which is narrated by C-3PO and intercut with interviews of the cast, comes off as severely cheesy.  And the absence of EMPIRE OF DREAMS is very noticeable.
So buy this release for the films and the films alone.  The bonus content is just that: nothing really that thrilling, but some of it might provide insightful.  The films are the real reason to get this set.  And the force is strong with STAR WARS on Blu-ray.",1316649600,7,9173,4.898898250162022
7220796,5,B00YI71PN2,"Other than the issues with Lucas keeping the crappy changes he's already made before, my husband, the Star Wars junkie is quite happy.

I suppose it's a good thing that people can't come back from the dead, and no it's not because they'd be flesh eating zombies. It would be the sheer terror of Da Vinci wanting to add dinasaurs in the background that would ruin its cultural impact. Not to mention he'd probably give away any secrets ge may have had about the last supper.

So here it stands, Lucas is a flesh eating bastard. He eats away at the same meal, until there are only bones and then he preceeds to decorate those bones with uneeded yellings and dreadful cgi bone eating maggots. Lucas has even gone so far as to desecrate Jim Henson's memory by using cgi to replace one of the most beloved muppets. Shame Lucas.

If VCR tapes and 4x3 back breaking TVs are still your thing I can see fighting Lucas on his update. I love how this was done and how the visual and audio has been given a modern shot in the arm. 5 Big Stars for this Star Wars blu ray box set. I may buy another just as a back up!

7220800,5,B00YI71PN2,"First let me say i can completely sympathize with those who are upset that the original theatrical versions of the orginal trilogy are not part of this set but that being said i think its been taken way out of control in the view of being rational. the fact that there were over a thousand reviews on this set BEFORE it came out was insane to me, even with the leaked footaged of the changes in this release. how can one fairly give an opinion on something they haven't seen in its entirety right?

Anyways, i really feel that the people at thedigitalbits.com got it right other than there critical low rating on episode 1 video quality which i found to be above and beyond what the dvd video quality was. No grain makes that movie so much easier to watch. what a great treat to see that movie look as good as it does. the worse looking film in the bunch to me is episode 6 and i guess the reason for that was the way it was shot. The softer tone in the picture just doesnt work for me but even still it looks great and the "" horrible "" changes i actually like. Didnt think i would but i do.

The three specail features disc's can be a little bit of a pain to navigate through but the content is worth while. The deleted scenes fron episode 4 make this set worth buying and those scenes are as "" original "" as you can get baby, lol. The documentary about the 501st legion is really fun aswell, to see other fans do there thing on a grand scale is kinda cool to sit back and enjoy.

The changes in this release are really quit minimal compared to a couple of lists i've seen on the internet of proposed changes that really just would rebuild the movies from the ground up. just bad news from the get go. Theres still alot of the original film left in these movies and those scnes that haven't been altered are a pleasure to see in HD. Its not like every shot has a change in it. There all mostly small stuff that i feel really doesnt change much, it certainly didn't take anything away from my Star Wars exsperience.

I was not too excited about it until it was in my hands and I started to really look through it. 9 discs and 3 of them are the special features. To get 6 films on blu-ray for this price is a great value. The special features alone are worth the price. There is more detail and more information about the movies than I have ever seen anywhere else.

My friends and I would act out scene after scene, day after day.  We traded Star Wars cards, we played with the Star Wars toys,  the characters became friends to us.  We held our breath for 3 long years for the next movie. And when that day finally came it was better than Christmas. We could finally see for ourselves what did happen to Luke, Leia, Han, Threepio, R2, and Chewbacca. This release has been the biggest letdown.  I don't own it and I never will.  The original cuts, in restored video and audio, without the new special effects from any era, is that too much to ask for?  I would have spent 80 bucks on just those.

7220810,1,B00YI71PN2,"Well, the original Star Wars movies that so many people experienced as they first appeared in cinemas are apparently no longer of value or relevant to anyone anymore and are not included in this set.

The fact that a quality print of the original Star Wars is still not available today is unbelievable and a real loss to fans of the original trilogy, and indeed to all those with a genuine interest in the preservation of important works and maintaining their integrity within film history.

I am sure this release will adequately meet expectations for those that enjoy the revised canon, and I genuinely hope it is all that you wish for, but also feel that many people are greatly missing out by not experiencing the original theatrical versions, which actually had a more natural looking colour pallet, better contrast with no detail loss in shadows, and pioneering special effects and model work still intact.

As time has moved on, and in the light of continuing changes and digital manipulation, which just seem to detract rather than enhance, I have now come to accept that fans such as myself who greatly appreciate the unaltered films are also no longer relevant, or indeed even part of the intended demographic for this current incarnation of Star Wars and all that it has become.

I have great memories of watching Star Wars when first shown in cinemas all those years ago, and the real sense of adventure it evoked in the imagination, and although obviously a little sad that both new and older fans will not be able enjoy the original trilogy at a respectable quality, I believe this release really does mark what is a great missed opportunity.

7220812,1,B00YI71PN2,"I waited until I could see the final release versions of the changes before commenting hoping that some of them were rumors or that some of the video clips I'd seen were fake.  Here's my quick run-down of the ones I particularly noticed (only from the original trilogy as I don't care nearly as much about the prequel):

* Obi-Wan's changed Krayt Dragon scream is **horrible**.  They should have stuck with either of the previous versions.  This one sounds like a kid playing around with some fun tech.  It completely breaks me out of the scene.
* Gredo still shoots first (though it does look slightly better).  :(
* The Ewok's have eye-lids.  Honestly, this one didn't bother me nearly as much as most people.  I prefer the no-eyelids but am okay with the CG eyelids.
* Vader now says ""No.  Nooooo"" when the Emperor is shooting lightning at Luke.  Another good scene completely ruined.  Not only was the scene much more effective without the line but the quality of the voice seems way off as well - my guess is they either did not use James Earl Jones or used software to modify dialog from somewhere else - it just doesn't sound like it fits there.

My personal take is that I like some of the changes made to each version (1997, 2004, 2011) but I really wish Lucas would stop ruining scenes or characters.  I will continue to watch my theatrical release DVDs until Lucas, at a minimum, restores Han to shooting first, removes the ""No"" line from Vader, and makes the Krayt Dragon scream not sound horrendous (either of the two previous versions or some new one is fine (as long as the new one is *much* better than this one)).",1316649600,15,1630,4.503401360544218

7220814,4,B00YI71PN2,"As our home entertainment options constantly improve, it is a wonderful thing when the media for our favorite movies gets an upgrade. I was extremely ecstatic when my wife ordered me the Bluray set of the complete Star Wars saga as a gift. As a lifelong fan of the films, I am really happy to finally have a set that looks and sounds great. Sure some of the movies were ""fixed"" better than others, but it really comes down to expectations. I have come to expect Lucafilm to constantly work to fix things both in content and technical aspects that they do not like. Gerge Lucas is a story teller, even when flawed, his intent always seems to be to tell the best story. With the Bluray release, the story doesn't necessesarily improve, but it now looks and sounds right with the equipment I have at home. And for that reason alone, its worth it. Do I like all the changes made to the features over the years with each new media release? No, of course not, but I have come to accept them as part of the process. Watching these I will say that the documentary extras and movies are great. Much of the other extras were slow to load on my Bluray player with an excess of menus to manuever, but I still enjoyed them. If you are a fan, you should relax and try to enjoy these. Its really not that hard to do....

I can understand if someone is looking at this from a 'purist' standpoint and gives it the no go, but even for all the crazy additions contained within the actual movies, I'm still a kid at heart, and still love the series for what it is: A GREAT escape from reality for a few hours.

7220820,4,B00YI71PN2,"Before I begin, I want you to know that my dad worked at CBS/FOX Video during the 80s. As such, what I'm about to say comes from someone who has seen the original negatives (or, at least, a copy that isn't that far off from the o-negs).

Being a fan of STAR WARS, I'm ready to jump at any chance to purchase a product that will give me a home theater experiences comparable to how I saw the movies in the theaters. I did that for the DVD release (which, just for the fact that I could watch the movies over and over again and they'd look as pristine as when I first watched them was worth the money) and now for the Blu-ray release. Obviously, the fact that the movies are only 85%-90% of what people originally remembered has become a source of friction amongst the fan community. However,  I could overlook that (especially  since I don't mind some of the changes) when I think about the pristine clarity Lowry Digital and Blu-ray technology could bring to these classic movies. But, the ultimate test was my dad. I played the movie for him on our 50"" TV. He was already impressed with how much better the movie looked. Then, he had me pause on a moment on the Tantive IV with a closeup of C-3PO. He pointed out to me the detail of all the dirt and grime on 3PO's forehead that he remembers seeing on the film prints he handled. He remarked on how this was the first time he had seen that kind of detail come out on any version of those movies for any home video release. As such, this version of those movies is *much* closer to the original negs.

The additional features are amazing as well. There were rumors going around in the fan community about certain sequences, whether or not they had been filmed, or whether or not the footage still existed. Two of my favorites would have to be all the footage related to the Wampa scenes on Hoth and the additional footage of the Rebel side of the attack on the second Death Star. There are interviews that have never been seen before dating back to before the special edition all the way up to the DVD release. As well as behind the scenes documentaries that were aired during the original trilogy. Some extra ""tokens"" would be the addition of a documentary about members of the 501st being hand selected to march in the Rose Parade as well as ""spoofs"" of the trilogy, I assume, were fan created. My only complaint would be that I could have hoped for something a little more substantial in terms of extras. Not as much as, let's say, The Lord of the Rings Special Extended Edition. It doesn't have to be such a big monster. But, just something similar to what we got with the DVD release: STAR WARS Empire of Dreams. So, my word of advice is, if you already own the 4 DVD set (the silver slipcase), keep it. The DVD extra in that set is worth hanging onto.

Update: There are more videos on the individual trilogy discs other than the cut scenes and the interviews. I started looking at the collections and, after looking at rotating models, additional interviews played. They could have done a better job at explaining that.",1316563200,12,3076,4.398945518453427

We were interested in them just for nostalgia, to reconnect with our youth in seeing the story of Darth Vader.  But the movies look and sound good.

The disappointment is that these discs have terrible extras.  They are old or not interesting.  I'm an idiot for continuing to buy these movies from money-hungry Lucas in hopes they will be a definitive set.  And for such a technological powerhouse, Lucasfilms does nothing with the Blu ray format in term of the user interface.  Even the deleted scenes are not easily or logically accessible.  If you want to see a great UI, look at the Alien Anthology or Lord of the Rings just to name two.  Lucas totally blows using the Blu ray format to the movies' advantage.

And I'm tired of hearing Ben Burtt the sound designer being the most heard voice in the commentaries.  Where is Lucas?  where is the cast?  They should have made full running commentaries.

I give this collection only one star even though the movies never looked or sounded better.  But I won't return them.  Because I'm an idiot, like many of you out there.  If we we're smart, we'd all return these discs to send a message to Lucas.  But you know you won't!  So I won't either.

Everyone seems to forget how darn expensive VHS were back in the days. A copy of a new release would cost about 80 to 100 $. Now you get all six movies on blu ray + 2 discs loaded with extras for 80 $ and you still find reasons to complain about it. The picture quality is awesome. The sound is mind blowing. Who are these people giving 2 star reviews ? Lets keep this simple. If you already own 3 different star war releases on DVD you should probably not buy this release because you are going to find something to complain about. If you do not own any star wars DVD or blu rays then buy this release. By the way no normal person cares if Darth Vaders lightsaber ? turns from red to pink for 20 seconds. The only people who care are the ones who have seen this movie one too many times. In Ben-Hur one of the actors is wearing a watch during the horse races. I wonder if they corrected this mistake on the new blu ray release. My guess, probably not ! Now i am starting to feel real sorry for George Lucas.

7220828,1,B00YI71PN2,"I've loved Star Wars ever since I discovered my older brother's action figures. We must have rented the movies a million times. They never got old. When Luca$ decided to release the movies to theaters, I was 11. I was excited to see them on the movie screen for the first time. There was so much that I didn't get to see on the old video tapes. On top of that, new special effects.

The difference between 11 and 26 is huge. I miss the movies of my childhood. I don't care anymore about CGI Jabba or how he added scenes. I miss the original trilogy. The new movies leave me cold. I'm old enough to appreciate how the new footage and changes destroy the original flow of the films. Lucas doesn't care about quality movies anymore. He hates the original trilogy. Instead he focuses on the Prequels and the army of yes men who basically treat him as a mastermind, instead of the shell he is.  What happened is be grew old. Like Wendy in Peter Pan, he is unable to experience the wonder he once did. The new movies are written by an old man who forgot what it is to be young. He decides to tinker with a legend, unaware he is becoming a laughing stock to the public in media. Where he was once a daring filmmaker who had a vision no one believed in, he now trades on his former glory, surrounded by yes-men while he milks the fans for all the money they can. Toys, crappy video games, awful expanded universe books. He tinkers with the movies to sanitize them for young kids. He turned his back on the people who helped make the original trilogy great.

Now we have the blu-ray set. With little Anakin proudly on the cover. He prefers this version, the one he has complete control over. He probably giggles has he adds CGI rocks and changes voices creating what in his mind is a great product. He is wrong. The sad truth is, he could have put the theatrical versions in the set and avoided any mess. No one would have cared. Instead he takes revisionist history to a near 1984 level. He truly believes that he always planned for this to happen. He refuses to admit he made most of it up as he went along. The new generation believes him. My niece will grow up thinking Star Wars is clones, Anakin and bloody Jar Jar. That makes me want to vomit.

I will not be purchasing this set. I saw the deleted scenes from the classic movies on you tube. I will stick with the unaltered trilogy. Maybe someday he will see the light and release the movies we all remember. I don't care if it is alongside the new edits with a CGI tree or something. The only way I can stomach Star Wars anymore is by acknowledging the parts that make me feel like I'm watching classic cinema. Sadly this is not this set.",1316563200,10,2687,4.273084479371317

I hate 90% of the changes that Lucas has been making to these films ever since he re-released them as the Special Edition Trilogy back in '97.  In the movies I saw and loved back in the 1980's, Han shot first, Ewoks didn't blink, Sebastian Shaw was the ghost of Anakin, and Darth Vader didn't have to say NOOOOO!! before he threw the Emperor to his death.

I'm still a fan with the completion of the prequels & a much broader understanding of the (now) last 3 films. For those people who want to nit-pick, cry, complain & , in essence, bitch about the re-mastering, tweaking &  repackaging of this epic saga is an all-around grow-up & appreciate it for what it is; storytelling on the grandest scale ever!! These are the ground-breaking films by which all other sagas that follow will be measured. That means Harry Potter, Twilight, & quite possibly Stephen King's The Dark Tower will follow in line as some of the best told stories ever put to film (although not a fan of Twilight, an example just the same!) in a series.
If George Lucas feels that the finished product isn't to his satisfaction, either from technological limitations from the past or adding previously deleted scenes to tell HIS story, then let him finish off what he intended to in the first place!! These are his stories, like it or not!! I'm not going to go off by saying what I like or what I don't like about this set. I do have my own reservations, but who cares, I still like the stories & what they bring me back to; my childhood. So a scream isn't what it should be or the lightsaber is pink!! Are you kidding me!?

In episode 1 the yoda cgi was a better addition than the original and nothing was really done to 2 or 3. The Kryat dragon call that Ben Kenobi did was diffrent but was not that bad . Do have to say ""A New Hope"" looked gariney through out most of the movie . But 5 and 6 were visually stunning . Picture quality was a lot better than dvd . Now for the part that everybody thought was stupid . Lucas did add the ""no"" scream and yes it did sound a bit wierd but its liveable . Did not take or add anything from the movie , and than you have the eyes that blink on the Ewoks , really if you don't look carefully enough you cant see it . So for all those people that canceled their preorders because of those small changes you have forgotten what a movie is . These movies are made for our entertainment and nothing more . Instead of breaking every scene down to tell us whats wrong don't watch or by it for that fact . In the end we all  need to make up our own minds about what we watch and all 6 movies were very good .

The book 'pages' are heavy, 1/4 inch thick cardboard with slots for each blu-ray.  I don't think the discs would be scratched inside this packaging because of the thickness of the cardboard - the individual discs are thinner than the cardboard, so I am leaving my discs in this packaging once I am done watching each movie.

The movie quality is excellent, and it is wonderful to see the movies without any cropping and good sound.  Despite how you may feel about the changes, if you want to see Star Wars in 1080P, just buy this.

7220840,5,B00YI71PN2,"I saw the very first movie, Star Wars, as a young teenager at the old original Hollywood Cinerama Dome theater in 1977. My father took me to see it. I saw the subsequent two episodes, V & VI, in theaters as well. I saw all three originals in all their glory as originally released on the big screen when they premiered. I was totally and instantly hooked. I started collecting Star Wars memorabilia immediately. I have a huge collection of -original vintage- Star Wars memorabilia in pristine condition (which I would love to sell if anyone's interested). And, I have been a devoted Star Wars 'nut' ever since that first experience in 1977. I've seen all six episodes on the theater big screen, including the theater re-releases of IV, V, and VI in 1997 of course, and now I've seen them all on the home big screen in all their Blu-ray surround-sound glory.

I preordered this box set back in January and had been waiting for 9 months. During that time I never did pay too much attention to the blubbering lamentations of the Star Wars purists who have behaved like spoiled children all but claiming ownership and rights to something they have never possessed as their own, nor to the folks who had never even seen what was in store for purchasers of this box set -because it hadn't even been released- yet. However, I was recently somewhat concerned by the recent revelations of alterations to certain scenes in a couple of the episodes that were officially disclosed. It garnered my attention to a degree but came nowhere close to motivating a cancellation of my purchase. After all, Lucas had done this before and more than once over the last 34 years. Now, after having watched all six episodes again but in Blu-ray, the deleted scenes, the alternate scenes, and all of the other extras in this box set, I am greatly pleased by this box set.

The episodes have never ever looked so good outside of the big screen theater. The surround-sound is impeccable. The changes are so small in the grand scheme of things, and in the big picture it actually improves -this- Star Wars experience. Having already owned the Laser Disc's, the VHS, and then the DVD sets for many years I am so glad I purchased this set. Mr. Lucas and crew did an outstanding job. Some of the extra's and several of the deleted/alternate scenes I had never seen before. Anyone who simply just 'likes' the Star Wars galaxy, much less someone who has seen them all in theaters as originally released in their younger days, and whom has a Hi-Def TV (it is absolutely stunning on my newer 73"" 1080p plasma), a surround-sound setup, and a Blu-ray player would be greatly remiss in not purchasing this box set.

Good:
-Video cleaned up--there is absolutely no source available with better quality
-Numerous technical glitches fixed
-Tons of extras, including multiple commentary tracks per film

Bad:
-Greedo still shoots
-The infamous Vader ""no""
-Obi Wan's intro scene in Ep 4 has him making a pretty awkward krayt dragon noise
-Some Blu-Ray players have trouble because there appears to be new copy protection applied to some of the discs; this should be a temporary thing though once software/firmware updates hit.  I had trouble with Ep. 2 but within a day my software had been updated and everything was fine

I used to be completely crazy for Star Wars.  I read every single Star Wars novel that existed at the time.  My favorite PC games were X-Wing, TIE Fighter (Defender of the Empire of course), and Dark Forces. I would have trivia battles with one of my friends over such riveting topics as the name of the guy with the gas mask who snitched on the crew in Ep. 4 as they made their way off Tatooine.  I say this because I KNOW what it's like to love this series.  Coming from that sort of background, even I am not flipping out over this Blu-Ray set.  Honestly, only the Vader ""no"" is egregious enough to make me pause.  But if it bothers you that much, just rip the Blu-Ray, take the audio from the DVD's version of the scene and put that in.  That's what I plan on doing.  Too technical?  Well, watch an older copy of ROTJ and quit letting two dubbed-in words ruin your life.  Every other change is minor enough that they, at most, evoke a ""Why did Lucas change that?  Oh well"" response.  I can confidently report that I did not embark upon a murderous rampage after seeing R2 hiding behind some rocks that weren't there in the original film.

Honestly, if you're going to complain about something, complain about the prequel movies, especially Ep. 1 and 2.  Those are like the equivalent of 2 hours of Vader ""no""s.  The Blu-Ray set is fine.",1316563200,11,2113,4.571808510638298
7220845,5,B00YI71PN2,"I am a huge Star Wars fan and I love all six films. I got this on the first day it came out and I was amazed how good Star Wars looks in hi-def. The deleted scenes for the Originals were just awesome, even though that most of them were not finished and had no sound to them, but that is understandable. I was a little disappointed that they didn't include the deleted scenes from the DVD versions of Prequels and that they didn't include the original Jabba the Hutt scene, but still the ones they had were pretty cool to watch.

I previewed the collection a little bit and I have to say that all the props, costumes and models that I have seen are pretty cool. I have yet to look at the rest or seen the concept art gallery and interviews, but I can't wait to seem them. If you have the DVD versions, keep them when you get this product. I say that because the bonus discs don't have the plethora of behind the scenes and special features material as the previous versions.

For all of you that complain about the minor changes, just stop talking and watch the movies. They are still great films regardless of changes.",1316563200,12,1118,4.268867924528302

7220847,1,B00YI71PN2,"First of all, if I could have rated this ZERO stars, I would have. Thank God I got to see this release without actually buying it!

You know those people who feel unhappy with something about their body and decide to go in for a little nip and/or tuck? Then, before you know it, they notice something else that they don't like and go back for more, only now they start to look like someone who had plastic surgery. Then they go back in to fix the weird look they got and they come out looking even worse. After a while, they become psychologically addicted to plastic surgery and start going in every 6 months, each time coming out of the doctor's office looking more deformed and hideous than the last time.

Well, this is what the STAR WARS films have become. They used to be this natural, beautiful thing...a perfect example of how to make a great epic film series with a limited budget and equally limited effects technology. If you don't believe me, hunt down an increasingly rare copy of the untouched original films and marvel at the imagination and ingenuity put forth on the screen without the help of one second of CGI.

While you're at it, marvel at the character of Han Solo, a self centered and morally misguided rogue who goes through a wonderful character arc from that to well respected, self sacrificing hero and leader of men.

All of the newly butchered...I mean, SPECIAL...editions are shadows of the original films. Gone is the magic. Gone is the organic look of the film. And especially gone is the character arc of Han Solo, the best character in any STAR WARS film.

7220852,1,B00YI71PN2,"------EDIT - I broke down and bought this. Changing review to reflect updated thoughts.
---Since reviews are clumped together, this is a review for the blu ray set of all 6---
Why did I change my mind? To own all 6 in HD. Will they be the ones I watch? Probably never, but they'll be on the shelf.
This review has been revised, just like the historical, original versions of the original movies, haha. See that? Easy. This isn't the review you were looking for anyway. Move along ;)

Even ""Episode 1"" has been changed from its theatrical version. Lame. Don't know about EP2. Probably changed. I think EP3 is the least messed with from what I've read.

Sad how much the original 3 have been messed with over the years. Someday, (I hope) we'll see a real HD transfer of the ORIGINAL movies, even the prequels. Just unbelievable the amount of silly little things have been tweaked. It also seems a little disrespectful to all the folks who worked so hard on the old non-digital effects.

Still holding on to my 2006 DVDs, as they do contain the ORIGINAL movies (IV-VI anyway).
Not happy with any of the changes made over the years. Pointless. All of it.

About the only positive things about this set are
1) Discs should work
2) Tons of bonus material
3) Blu ray discs scratch less easily

Cons:
1) I don't think any of the movies are in their theatrical, original versions. No option for this. Lame.
2) Color manipulation is horrible in places. Maybe it looks perfect on some super-special THX test theater setup?
3) Sound changes / additions are pointless. Darth screaming ""nooo"" ...really?????
4) Destroys the memory of the originals, as so many details have changed.
5) Includes 3 rather bad movies, but tons of bonus material. What can you do.
6) 1997 - tons of changes made. 2004 - more random changes made. 2011 - more random changes made. That makes this the what, 5th edition or something? How much is enough?

It's really simple. Not a problem to revise, add *good* changes (maybe if they did a better job on color correction, for example). Heck, do what you want. Everyone's problem is quite simple - there is not really any *good* version of the originals available anymore. The 2006 DVD were the last disc based way to get these, and they were limited edition. Non-anamorphic ""postage stamp"" style (letteroboxed inside a 4:3 window) DVDs are kind of a let down in this era of widescreen.

I think that if there were one *good* last true original format of the movies, it wouldn't be as big of a deal. They could have even done a cheap upscale of the originals in DVD form as a bonus here, in proper aspect ratio, and that would probably have made most people quite happy to have even a slightly better than 2006 DVD version included here.

Someday, I really hope a good ""4k"" or better scan is done of the originals, and that they're released to the public. It's a shame that this heavily manipulated blu ray is now the only available format of such a classic.",1316476800,18,2969,4.546816479400749
7220853,5,B00YI71PN2,"I think this is a great set and probably the best box set I own. Most of the changes made to the movies were technical, except for the now infamous change made to ROTJ. And honestly, I watched it and it wasn't that bad. Was it unnecessary? Yes. But it doesn't ruin the film.

Now I do believe they need to release a remaster of the original versions, if only for archive purposes, but this set is still a good release.",1316476800,15,418,4.160493827160494
7220854,5,B00YI71PN2,"I have noticed that many die-hard fans of this series (one of which I am) are rushing to judge this set before any of us have really had much of a chance to critique it, and I say to those who are condemning it out of the gate to BACK OFF. I am one of the biggest Star Wars fans out there amongst the many (have been since I was old enough to walk), but I think many of the die-hards are missing a few key points here:

1) This series does not belong to the die-hards, no matter how much we may pretend it does. At the end of the day, it is the masterpiece of GEORGE LUCAS, and thus it belongs TO HIM. If he wants to make changes to his unequivocal masterpiece before he dies, then he has every right to do so. Do you know how many changes the greatest of artists made to their masterpieces before their deaths? Countless. And why? Because they wanted to get as close to their individual visions as possible before they died. George Lucas is no different. He knew fans would buy this set, changes or no changes. Therefore, he obviously made the changes because he decided they belonged there. So GET OVER IT! Quit condemning his judgment before you've even had a chance to thoroughly investigate it.

2) The set is actually NICE! The way it is put together is very nice, and the extras with it are great from what I have seen so far. So what really is the problem here? Lucas adds a few rocks to a scene, and we're gonna smash up what he has give us and demand he reverse course on his own masterpiece? Please.

3) This is the first time we have ever had all the films united into one set, a day many of us have long been waiting for, notwithstanding the fact that we have long waited for these films to be released in high-definition as well for a long time. Is that not reason to at least celebrate a bit? I mean come on.

In short, I am amazed at the amount of whining (yes, whining) going on with some of the reviews I have been reading that were written before the set was even released and just a few days after its release, hardly enough time to give it a fair hearing and thoroughly critique it. I have personally viewed the films and see nothing majorly wrong with the updates Lucas has made to them. Will it be something to get used to? Of course it will. But am I going to cry and whine about it like a crime has been committed? No. I am just as big of a die-hard fan of this series as many of the whiners on here, and I may not personally agree with all the things Lucas has done to the films, but I also understand that he has the sole right to do so as the creator and that if he is making these changes, he obviously intended it to be this way. So I would suggest all of you stop rushing to judge this set to the gallows before even knowing what is in it. Quit ruining it for more moderate fans of the series who are looking to the reviews to determine whether or not they would like this set. Let them be the judges of this set, because it's clear that many die-hards are in no shape to give an accurate judgment on this set. It's a sad day when grown adults (the whiners) start behaving like spoiled children who want vanilla ice cream (the original unedited versions of the films) but instead are given chocolate (the updated blu-rays) by Dad (George Lucas), and then they decide to scream at the top of their lungs (the narrow-minded reviews), throw down the ice cream cone refusing to try it (refusing to even give the new versions a chance), and kick him because they didn't get their way (the character assaults on George Lucas).",1316476800,19,3551,4.17956204379562

7220856,5,B00YI71PN2,"I get why people are angry. George change something that was beloved by so many, but that's life.
I personally found nothing wrong with the changes, sure Vader yelling ""NOOOO!!"" sounded pretty bad, but that didn't ruin my experience with this box set.
The films themselves have never looked and sounded better! Episode III looks on par with other Blu-Rays like, Avatar and Star Trek. All the others look good, but being that they are older and not shot in Hi-Def they don't look as good as Episode III.
I really like the packaging (US Version). The packaging won't scratch up the discs, but it will force you to touch the bottom of the disc. The book style and the art on each page looks gorgeous! Although, I would have liked to see disc art, but that's very minor.
The special features are phenomenal! Over 40 hours of stuff to watch, personally, I won't watch much of the features, but if you like that stuff. It's there for you. What I really like is the bloopers and the documentaries that are included.

""No, the ""untouched"" original trilogy is not included. Yes, there are some goofy new additions, like Darth Vader yelling ""NOOOOO"" as he throws Emperor Palpatine over the railing. I don't think anyone really expected this release of The Complete Saga to be free of controversy. But come on. It's Star Wars. On Blu-ray. This is a once-in-a-technological-generation event, and if your hatred of George Lucas' revisionist tinkerings keeps you from enjoying some of your favorite films in high definition, you're missing out. Believe me, I share your pain. Whenever I hear that stupid funk song inside Jabba's palace, I cringe like a man being forced to bite down on tin foil or chew sand. It's almost physically painful. But I'm done being bitter. I'm playing the long game. One of these days, Lucas will wise up and realize that the original trilogy--in its original form--is a culturally and historically important piece of pop art that belongs to its fans. But until that day, I'm going to enjoy this Blu-ray box set. The films have never looked or sounded better-- Episodes III-VI are particularly impressive--and they come with a fantastic collection of special features.""

What they should have done is at least put original releases on the disk as the disk is a dual layer blu-ray disk 50 gigs of storage so im sure it could have fit.

as for the docs why couldn't they have added all of them on another disk I missed from star wars to jedi the making of a saga that was classic.

There are some extremely minor changes to the original films, which suffered significantly from a lack of modern technology but resulted in a great deal of charm.  It's still wholly Star Wars, presented in the finest quality available on home entertainment systems.

The prequels aren't great, but they're really not as terrible as I remembered them after seeing Revenge of the Sith years ago.  The real problem is the poor writing.  They sound as though someone started in a foreign language, pasted that into Google Translate, and turned that in as a shooting script.  The story is still great, and the often-underrated actors do what they can with bad material.

7220868,4,B00YI71PN2,"I pre-ordered the boxset back in January as soon as it was announced.  I'm a Star Wars fan and have been since I saw the original in the theater in 1977, and I've owned several different editions both on VHS and DVD over the years.

The set is packaged in a very sturdy slipcase.  Inside the movies are in a book format, with thick pages for each movie.  I was originally concerned about scratches, but the slots that each disc slide into seem to have a coating on them that keep them from slipping around and they actually fit pretty well. I've read that this is similar to the Alien set, but since I don't have that one I can't say for certain.

The films have never looked better on home video.  There may be a few issues here and there, but as opposed to freeze-framing through each spot where a change took place, I sat down and watched them, and had a blast doing it.

I have to admit I wasn't crazy about some of the changes I had heard about in the weeks up to the release. But they aren't as big of a deal to me when watching them in the context of the films.  For example, the new Krayt Dragon call that Obi-Wan makes in Episode IV sounded awful to me when I heard the clip online.  However, when I finally heard it in the context of the movie in DTS-HD sound, I really didn't mind it.

The sound is amazing.  When I first started watching, I felt that I wasn't hearing as much from my surrounds. Ambient sounds were there, but I finally realized it was the fact that everything was more precise, and I was only hearing the ""punch"" of the surrounds when I was truly supposed to.

There are a ton of extras and I haven't gotten through them all yet, but what I've seen is great.  Tons of things we haven't seen before, and some of the deleted scenes and animatics are things I actually would have liked to have seen added to the films.

 Obviously there are those that changes matter a great deal to and I'm sure we all would have loved a branching option to select your own custom cut (Crawl/No Crawl,Han does/doesn't shoot first,SE footage/no SE footage, etc.) but unfortunately that's not here.

I would encourage you to consider the set as a whole and not fault the whole over a couple of changes here and there, but if those mean that much to you, this review won't sway you anyway.

It's on par with throwing some technocolor into classic black & white films.  Although the video looks stunning, the new additions to the movies were sooo unnecessary, they stand out like a very very sore thumb.  I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about and can't agree with the majority more.  These ""subtle"" additions are crammed down your throat.  Lucas has ruined a good thing and no doubt will continue tinkering with it until it's no longer recognizable.",1316476800,20,593,4.764705882352941
7220870,1,B00YI71PN2,"Okay, I've bought the Star Wars movies like 3 times now, and I will not buy it again.  This is where I draw the line.  I don't care that it's now in a new format or that a few tiny things have been changed, I just don't care.  It's the SAME DAMN MOVIE!!!  I've probably spent over $200.00 USD over the years on these movies alone.

First of all, I don't care about all the special features, I don't care about the bonus materials, I don't care about the original scripts, or the interviews, or the commentaries, I just want the movies.  That's all I want!  Say what you will about VHS, but at least in those days you had like 3 previews, the FBI warning, and then it was the movie, and you didn't have the price jacked up because of all these special features that no one really gives a rip about!

Okay, now I know everyone is up in arms about the changes that George made to the movies and frankly I am ticked off too.  The only good changes that he's ever made were putting the animation of the sandcrawler actually moving in A New Hope, that looked cool, the revised explosions of both Death Stars, definite improvement, and finally the extended wampa scene in Empire Strikes Back, that was done very well.  Everything else was garbage and unnecessary!

As far as the new changes, I really don't care about the Ewoks blinking, seriously, I don't.  But when you make Darth Vader, the biggest baddest guy in the Galaxy whine out the lines, ""No...NOOOO!!!!""  Like a whiny emo teenager, that is UNFORGIVEABLE!!!  That scene was already a masterpiece!  Adding that line of dialogue was the equivalent of putting a Snidley Whiplash mustache on the Mona Lisa.

George, if you really want to ""fix"" one of your movies, go back and FIX Howard the Duck.  Go back and FIX Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  THOSE movies need fixing!  Star Wars was perfect the way it was, and you just keep screwing it up more and more every single time you re-release it.  And why are you re-releasing it every 5 years or so?  Do you not have anything better to do with your time?  Instead why don't you go work on the Star Wars TV series that you promised fans would be done by 2009???
Also, if you really want to change the mythos of Star Wars or add something to the storyline, why don't you just MAKE ANOTHER DAMN MOVIE!?!  Seriously!!!  Just go make another movie and stop trying to fix what ISN'T BROKEN!!!

George, I've been a fan of Star Wars my whole life, I've played the games, I've watched the movies, I've watched BOTH animated Clone Wars series, I've collected the action figures, and I've even done the Star Wars roleplaying game, BOTH versions, d6 and d20, I've also read most of the books and comics.

7220873,1,B00YI71PN2,"*Spoilers ahead*

I am not a purist and don't think Star Wars is the best thing ever, not even close.

But I do think the original trilogy is a fantastic series and some of the best films ever made.

Lucas has been tinkering with Star Wars for decades, and while there are some questionable changes and additions that weaken the series, they were all essentially MINOR, until now. Even Han not shooting first anymore is not THAT big a deal, though still dumb. So while I had sympathy with Star Wars Fans I was never outraged. There are even mess ups like Vader's light saber turning pink on some editions, but again not a huge deal.

Lucas did the prequel trilogy which was utter tripe and destroyed the characters of Vader and made his story not tragic but teen angst rubbish. Even the legendary Obi-Won V Vader Volcano fight was abysmal and Lucas finished it off with a cheesy and ridiculous NOOOOOOOOO at the end when Vader first realises what he has become. However at least if you just treated this crap as non canon like I do, it does not impact on the original trilogy. The Vader in this rubbish is not the same as the original trilogy, it's just a star wars novel brought to screen, it never happened in the official Star Wars story line. That's what I told myself and it worked. It works for the Rocky sequels, Terminator 3 and 4, Robocop 3, Matrix 2 and 3 etc. It's a thing we all do for sequels and prequels that suck, and thats fine as we still have the originals we love.

However now comes the final straw, the stick that broke the camels back, the final nail in the coffin, the final insult. That horrid NOOOOOOOOOOOOO has followed Vader onto Return of the Jedi. During the final ultimate scene where Vader finally turns away from the Dark Side and saves his son by killing the emperor , thus losing his own life, he now screams NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO in the same horrid cheesy way from the prequel trilogy end, as if to mirror it like it's good or something.

This is a change too far, it rips the heart out of the series and ruins the most important scene in the final film. Anyone who claims to like Star Wars needs to STAY AWAY from this release. If people don't buy it Lucas will be forced to re release it on Blu Ray and REMOVE the change!! Vote with your feet/wallet people, don't buy it!!",1316476800,16,2305,4.373831775700935
7220874,4,B00YI71PN2,"Just got this Blu-Ray.  Was very happy to pre-order this only to find out when it gets there that the discs won't play in anything.  In fact, it completely locked up my Blu-Ray player (Samsung BD-P3600) so that I could not even eject the disc.  Luckily the power button still worked and I was able to power down and then hit the eject button to power back up, which ejected the disc before it tried to read it.  Tried to play it in my brand new Dell XPS-17 and again the movie doesn't respond to commands at all- just get to the opening splash screen where you can select ""Play"", but you can't actually select it, so you can't watch the movie.  Obviously there is something new about these movies that no players have the ability to play them, so why even release it yet?  What a disappointment.

UPDATE:  I bought an OPPO BDP-93 from Amazon and it has no problem playing any of the discs, so I changed the rating to 4 stars.  Deduct one star for the ""Noooooooooo"" added in ""The Return of the Jedi"".  Really, Lucas?  Just cheesy.",1316476800,12,1029,4.335078534031414
7220875,2,B00YI71PN2,"Well, being a Star Wars nut, I went against my better judgement and bought this Blu-Ray set at the ""bargain"" price, and it's a good thing the price was slashed or I would have demanded a refund.  The only good thing so far about this Blu-Ray set is the free T-shirt deal :)

How could George and his staff manage to screw up again???  And yet they have.  These ""Hi-Def"" versions obviously couldn't be from the films themselves.  I believe they just enhanced the standard DVDs.  The color is lousy is you don't have a top of the line HDTV.  Bottom line: stick with the standard DVDs and wait for a better Blu-Ray set to be issued.  You know they will come out in time.  George won't pass up yet another chance to milk the public for more profits.  Take a tip George...Try not...Do...Or do not....There is no try :)

A couple of side-notes:  The packaging is terrible...you need the strength of The Force to get the disks out of their slots...LOL  And the Star Wars spoofs....What spoofs???  How can you have a series of spoofs without Hardware Wars & Spaceballs??? (Well, just a brief scene from that film but hardly enough, and hardly the funniest scenes).  Maybe we do need The Schwartz instead of The Force... :)",1316476800,13,1214,4.504587155963303
7220876,5,B00YI71PN2,The PQ and audio are both superb. One thing I found difficult is to pull the disc out of the package. You need to either bend the disc or the booklet page.,1316476800,10,155,3.875
7220877,4,B00YI71PN2,"It's Star Wars, what more do you need to say? Episodes I-III are still painful to watch, because Jake Lloyd, Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman did not act well and Lucus wrote awful dialog. That said, the special effects are amazing and something to behold. Episodes IV-VI are far superior, but you probably already know this.

Since so much will be written, let me just offer this point. I watched Episodes I-III with the commentary from Lucas, McCallum and others on (just to avoid the dialog).  Poor George Lucus, while an obviously talented filmmaker, is still ""stuck in the 60's."" Unfortunately, he was not well served by his history teachers, making comments about Richard Nixon trying to change the constitution to serve a third term (false) to Roman and French history (wrong again on the fall of the Roman Republic and the French Revolution) and, of course, referring to the Vietnam War as a war of ""primitives"" against a ""technologically advanced"" society like the U.S. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Vietnam conflict, colored by old, worn out propaganda from Hanoi.  (Whatever your opinion of the Vietnam War, the North Vietnamese were anything but ""primitive"" or technologically inferior, as was documented by Dr. Michael Lind - a well known Liberal - in his book ""Vietnam: A Necessary War."" North Vietnam, and by extension their proxies the Viet Cong, received state of the art military hardware from both the USSR and Communist China.)

Yes, Lucas is a big Liberal, no surprise. That comes through in his commentaries but if you can ignore it, it is still worthwhile to hear the other comments on the history of the movies and what he intended.",1316476800,2,1679,4.943262411347518

7220879,1,B00YI71PN2,"It's over due! Lucas should keep on making Star Wars Films like what they did on Harry Potter. If he is too lazy to Direct & Write them, there are Lots & Lots of unemployed Talents out there who can do it for him. Funding the new Films won't be an issue, I bet you, All producers would want to bank on this Franchise, because it' will be an instant success.

Star Wars Universe has so much potential for a New and Exciting Stories. Honestly, I'm TIRED of Anakin & Luke. I want to see the Next Generation Jedi's on the Big Screen. Solo & Leia's twin kids Jaina and Jacen would be Awesome. Or, a Han Solo & Wookie one shot Film. Anything as long as it's not about Vader, Anakin & Luke.

So for now, I'd say, NO to this Blu-Ray Gimmick.

7220881,4,B00YI71PN2,"Overall this is a pretty good blu ray set. I STILL WANT THE UNALTERED TRILOGY, but until we get the original trilogy unaltered, this is the best looking and sounding Star Wars we have. The packaging is also pretty nice.

The picture quality was surprisingly good, especially the original trilogy. The restoration job done here was pretty amazing. The picture quality in the prequels was nice as well, but that was almost expected. There is some DNR in The Phantom Menace, and a little less in Attack of the Clones. The picture quality in Revenge of the Sith shines, as it is the best in the set. Now I just want to see the original trilogy unaltered with this excellent transfer.

The audio, across the board, is simply fantastic. The score and sound effects are amazing, and this sets trumps all other blu rays in the sound department. True demo material.

Yes, the changes that Lucas make are infuriating, but I'm still glad I got this set. I hate Han shooting first, hate the ""NOOOOOOO"" and really get annoyed but the added CGI and useless silly creatures. But this is all we have right now and it looks and sounds great.

The movies look and sound great, and are still enjoyable. The deleted scenes, the behind the scenes featurettes, the making-of features, and the commentaries are all great. I loved seeing these movies in their HD debut. If we can get an unaltered trilogy in the future, that would be icing on the cake.",1316476800,,1428,4.610236220472441

Most of the negative reviews here are from fans who feel cheated and are trying to get back at George Lucas (my hat is off to you).  However you have not purchased this product and therefore have no business reviewing the BD's.  The original trilogy look very good and sound awesome on blu ray.  This is the best picture and sound you will experience these movies!  While I am not a fan of the prequels I have to say that ROTS is almost Avatar standard on blu ray.  The first two films of the prequel I won't waist my time on commenting as I won't watch them again.  Overall the changes made to the original trilogy is not awful ( I actually enjoy most of the updated cgi ) as it makes these films more current.  I do agree ROTJ is a mixed bag and the added bar scene with Jabba the Hut is ridiculous! I find it sad that people won't watch the update Star Wars episodes 4 through 6 simply because the director / creator made some changes to the original movies!  Sit and pout but don't count on the original theatrical releases to be on blu ray anytime soon.  That will only happen if GL is broke and I don't see that happening anytime soon!,1316476800,12,1192,4.165938864628821

I read many reviews on here and I can understand many people frustration about the changes George has done to these movies.  But the way I feel is this!!  Let's take a moment and realize what is going on in the world and be very thankful that we have six wonderful movies that allow us to forget the bad in the world for a time.  These changes in my mind is what makes Star Wars so great it is like seeing a new movie each time I watch them.  I too grew up in the age of the original Star Wars and have fond memories of my father taking me to see Star Wars, Empire and Return of the Jedi but after seeing the new trilogy I was a little concerned how the original would fit in to these new upgraded versions.  That is why I feel these changes make the movies all flow very well together.  But as I said before I understand people's concerns and that's what makes Star Wars fans the best around.  But I truly recommend this collection believe me you won't be sorry.  For those fans that like the original untouched versions as I am sure you know those are available on DVD but purchase this blu-ray to add to the collection the special features alone are worth the price of 79.99 which by the way is a GREAT PRICE!

As far as the films are concerned, I wish Lucas would just get on with it and digitize the entire saga with digital characters, voices etc.

I have a sneaking suspicion that after the entire world buys yet another format of this film, he will license Criterion to release the ORIGINAL trilogy as it was released back in the 1977-1983.

Since that is the reaction many of us fans or just people who grew up with the films around are saying at this release.  Star Wars was one of the best films of it's time and created a legacy that is legendary in film. It's biggest enemy has been it's own creator, George Lucas. He has gone out of his way time and time again, ""improving"" as he calls it, what was already perfect exactly the way it was. As with any artist who keeps working on a finished work, he has only managed to tarnish and eventually sour the fantastic universe and heroes within it, with his ""Improvements.""

7220892,1,B00YI71PN2,"Well, what can I say that all the other reviewers haven't yet? It's been over 30 years since the original theatrical release of Star Wars premiered and every release since has slowly been hacked, remodeled, tossed like pizza dough and dipped in 6 month old ludafisk. In layman's terms, this movie STINKS! I mean come on!! You wonder why George Lucas only directed 4 of the 6 movies (three of them being episodes I thru III....ehh). And this is the guy that just HAD to have Jar Jar Binks in his films, a character that is undoubtedly the most obnoxious and irritating alien creature ever created.

That said, I can say that the movies do look good, I mean, besides all the countless CGI additions that look ridiculously fake. I liked the old method of using actual models for all the ships and vehicles which looked realistic. I also liked the old Yoda muppet which had real skin, hair, and meshed well with the human characters on screen. But now everything seems to be computer generated because George Lucas thinks it's cooooool, he loves this stuff. Hell, might as well make Luke Skywalker a CGI character and Han Solo into a long eared Gungan. But I was never a fan of the prequel trilogy, i thought the Phantom Menace was extremely boring and the whole Jar Jar Binks as comedic relief was just plain awful. But I suppose if the Imperial Empire can be defeated my some primitive Ewoks [that now blink their eyes?] who fight with sharp wooden sticks then I guess anything is possible in Lucas Land. The new movies were obviously targeting the younger demographic who may have been too young to see the old trilogy when it was re-released in theaters, when really it should be targeting the older folks who have seen it.

I am a die hard original trilogy supporter, but the changes that were implemented in the new Blu Ray release (which took WAY too long to release in my opinion) were unnecessary and only detracted from the story. I'm not sure what compelled Lucas to suddenly add some garbage dialogue and make things look more unrealistic, but I guess they are his movies and he has the supreme power to do what he wants with them. But overall, I'm glad to have a high definition Star Wars series at my disposal and I GUESSSSSS I can [grudgingly] overlook these stupid changes. I waited far to long for this release to boycott it completely. But if you are a true to the bone Star Wars fan I may advise waiting for a re-release (If it actually happens) that has removed these unusual changes; i.e. Darth Vader's now infamous NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO in episode VI or Ben Kenobi's elementary scream in episode IV.

Watching this new version of Empire Strikes Back was like being transported back in time and seeing the movie for the first time; and, yes, I saw it when it originally came out.

All of the movies in this package are big and bold, just the way Star Wars is meant to be.

All that said, I struggle with episodes I - III; but I also realize there is no way they could live up to my expectations.  In fact, originally, Episode VI did not live up to my expectations.  It is only when I step back and view the whole story that I can appreciate the genius of Lucas.

I spent this past weekend with my five year old daughter, telling her about Luke and his father, and how anger leads to the dark side.  The new movies did not let us down.  It was more fun than I thought possible.

Sure, folks can complain about the changes, but I'm afraid they miss the bigger point - in my humble opinion.  Lucas rolled the dice with episode IV long ago.  Sure, he got rich, but, over the years, we have been lucky to have these films, these memories.  His risk has become our cultural gold mine.

If Mr. Lucas wants to make changes then so be it; I, for one, will be in line to check it out.  The joy he has given me outweigh any negative feelings I might have about his constant tinkering with the originals.

One note: if you're considering buying these movies, read over the negative reviews.  Decide whether or not you can accept the changes.

If you want the originals you'll have to settle for crappy res. Its as simple as that,1316390400,16,256,3.9423076923076925
7220906,3,B00YI71PN2,Love the Blu-Ray treatment the StarWars Saga has just received.  Just one problem.  It is a repeat of Avatar.  The discs have issues playing on a HTPC using both PowerDVD 11 and ArcSoft TrueMedia Theater 5.  Both companies are stating a update is in the works.  My rating is only on 20th Century Fox's Decision to hurt the customer by updating Anti-Copy.  Sad thing is I was able to copy the discs and convert them to H.264 1080P files that Played flawlessly.,1316390400,3,459,4.536585365853658
7220907,5,B00YI71PN2,"I disagree with most of the reviews I read that are poor ratings. For one, like Ewan McGregor said when getting the part, it's STAR WARS!! Be happy it was created in the first place.

Secondly, I love all the movies and am a huge fan. I do not mind all the changes/additions Mr. Lucas made to the Complete Saga. It is his creation, and like many artists, if you have the need and ability to make your art as you wished it to be but were not able to do it originally, then why not adjust it? I do not think the changes/additions made degrade the quality of any of these films.

If the diehard fans dislike these adjustments and enjoy the original theatrical release versions, don't purchase the BluRay version and stick with VHS or laserdisc...or whatever was around when you first saw them back in the 70s/80s. I, for one, enjoy newer technology and enjoy the Star Wars saga keeping up with it. To have all six films in one package and to be of amazing quality is great in my opinion.",1316390400,14,984,4.313513513513514
7220908,5,B00YI71PN2,Watching the whole series again now in my LED in 1080p with an amazing image and sound quality. Highly recommended!,1316390400,14,115,4.8
7220909,4,B00YI71PN2,"Alright, we need to simplify what people's problems with this set are. It apparently isn't the quality of the video (for the most part) or audio, which is what blu-ray enthusiasts care about and is what I ultimately bought a high-def tv and surround sound system for. It's basically the fact that George Lucas did not restore the theatrical versions of the original trilogy for blu-ray and only gave us slightly modified special edition versions with this set.

By now you already know what was changed, and there are some things which probably shouldn't have been touched, but they were and there's nothing we can do about it at this time. Now the question we have to ask ourselves is do we care more about the Star Wars experience on blu-ray, the medium that gives us the ultimate home theater experience, or are we so determined to stand by our convictions that the theatrical cuts should be included that we will shun this set and wait until it's released with the original theatrical cuts?

The answer to this question is actually simple, and it took me having to watch the original theatrical cuts on dvd to realize how ridiculous my original reaction was. As I watched these great movies on my 50"" Pioneer Elite in Dolby 2-channel stereo, I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed in some way. I have this amazing home theater system, and these original theatrical cuts, with their grainy picture, black outlines around the special effects, and 2-channel stereo, which still sounded great for only 2 channels, simply don't give us the home theater experience we hoped for when we purchased all these expensive components. I began to realize that even if these versions were restored for blu-ray, it would look horrible because the level of detail on blu-ray would expose all the limitations in the special effects of that day. These cuts were meant for a lesser medium, like dvd or laser disc, where they could still showcase detail, but not enough where the limitations would be obvious and distracting. And what is the point of Dolby Stereo, which was the original theatrical audio source, on blu-ray? Sure the special editions were widely criticized for the many changes that were made, but one thing is for sure, even though the special effects of 1997 seem dated compared to today's special effects, they are leaps and bounds ahead of the special effects from 1977, 1980, and 1983, and undoubtedly showcase on blu-ray better than the theatrical cuts ever would.

What seems to be apparent when you read all the negative reviews is that people are just angry at George Lucas for the changes he's made to his works over the years. I agree it seems annoying for him to make so many changes, but this is his story, Luke Skywalker is his version of himself in his sci-fi fantasy, and he went through a lot to simply get the original movie made. Star Wars doesn't just belong to him, and it doesn't just belong to the fans who made it popular, it belongs to everyone, and it is available in so many different formats to please all these different people. This blu-ray set was made for the people who want the ultimate Star Wars experience, and this is the ultimate experience that George Lucas envisioned himself. He made some changes to try to make it perfect for blu-ray, and sometimes we try a little too hard to make things perfect when they already are, but he's not doing it to make the fans angry, he's doing it FOR the fans, because he wants them to see the vision that he saw in his mind over 35 years ago. I don't know why people get so angry at him for that, without George Lucas we would not have this legendary work of art. It's still available in it's original form on dvd, but George Lucas is providing us with something he believes is better, something he believes is the pinnacle of the Star Wars experience, and I think that's awesome. I haven't even bought the set yet because I simply don't have the money, but as soon as I do, I will add this blu-ray set to my collection.

So if you want the ultimate Star Wars experience, this is it, and if you want to see the original theatrical cuts, you still can on dvd, and they're just as, if not more, entertaining as the special editions. You have to come to accept that if you want the original Star Wars theatrical experience, it's simply not blu-ray caliber, and if you want the ultimate Star Wars experience, it's going to be different than what you remember, but it's still Star Wars, and it's still as amazing as ever. People have this expectation that somehow we can create this perfect version of Star Wars that pleases George Lucas and the fans, but that will never happen, and that is why they've given us so many different versions. So decide for yourself whether you want the blu-ray experience with what many reviewers say is the greatest home audio experience and the best picture you've ever seen from Star Wars, or whether you want to stick to your guns and your laser disc and dvd versions just because they are the original theatrical cuts. When you think about it, this argument is trivial, if you love blu-ray and Star Wars, just buy it, and most likely you won't regret it.",1316390400,20,5161,4.606521739130435

I tolerate the changes and modifications that Lucas and co. inject into these films each time they release them.  Count me in if they ever release a Blu-Ray of the original theatrical versions, but in the meantime these are stunning (1080p vs the 480p of the laserdiscs).  I watched Episode III with my son this weekend and Star Wars never looked or sounded better on my humble Blu-Ray/TV.

Do not listen to all the negative reviews over the episode 6 change were Vader yells ""NOOO!"".  That is literally 2 seconds out of the entire 6 films.  To discount the entire film set in HD quality over 2 seconds is a bit fanatical.  The imagery is amazing and the sound is great too!",1316390400,13,443,3.9886363636363638
7220915,4,B00YI71PN2,"Unless so many others, I actually purchased and watched the Blu Ray set before I set out to attack it.  In all fairness I see why people are up in arms. The majority of Star Wars fans want the pre-1997, unaltered versions of the original Star Wars trilogy.  IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!!!!!!!  Well, at least not while owner of all things Star Wars, George Lucas, still breathes.

Now for the movies themselves.  The audio and visual components of all six films are virtually flawless.  No Star Wars movie has looked better in the home setting.  My main problem with the visuals is with the OT special editions.  Brand new digital effects against twenty year old footage never did blend well and in high def the contrast is even more noticeable.

As for the prequel trilogy, the movies are what they are.  Watching The Phantom Menace again for the first time since it was in theaters I didn't hate it as much as I remembered, however, it's still has some really bad dialogue.  Actually, all three prequels have moments that make me cringe however I'm not going to bad mouth the movies here. What can be said that Mr. Plunkett from Red Letter Media hasn't already covered?

As for the original trilogy and the alterations, here's my analogy:  I grew up in Southern California and went to Disneyland several times a year as a during the seventies and eighties.  In the last twenty years the park has made several changes that I don't care for including putting the Rocket Jets on the ground level, adding lame music to Space Mountain, making the Haunted Mansion less scary, and making Pirates of the Caribbean more politically correct.  I don't like the changes but I am still always happy to spend a day at Disneyland and not let the changes ruin my day.  Same with those old Star Wars movies.  Nope, Greedo doesn't need to shoot first.  We don't need to see the guy in the Wampa suit, and we sure don't need to have Darth Vadar scream ""Noooooo!"" as he destroys the Emperor.

Some complaints:  This isn't even close to being a be all, end all boxed set.  Footage such as the original Jabba The Hut as missing.  I would also have been nice to include a high def version of ""Empire of Dreams"".  I did find it a hoot watching the deleted scenes from the original trilogy and I must say the editors deserve a big bonus.

If you really really really have to have the unaltered versions to enjoy the Star Wars experience, don't bother with this set.  No, I don't like most of the changes made over the years, but I still enjoy those movies.

7220917,1,B00YI71PN2,"I purchased the 2004 box set on DVD along with each ""prequel"" film as they were released. Then I purchased the same Original Trilogy again on DVD just to get the REAL Trilogy. No one made me buy these films, I wanted to for fun and posterity sake.

But George Lucas' attitude concerning his failure to treat the original trilogy with the respect it deserves by listening to the fans (the people who made him rich), has finally made me understand one thing: GEORGE DOESN'T CARE WHAT WE THINK. So in that tradition I don't care about these new Blu-ray releases. Seriously, I'm not that desperate.

You owe the fans an apology....and not in the form of a shoddy half-baked Blu-ray someday. A REAL Blu-ray release of the original trilogy complete with a remastered anamorphic widescreen image and sound.

The picture looks the best it ever has, and the sound is outstanding.  This is a great set, and it's a great price.  It's packaged well, doesn't take up too much space.  If you are a Star Wars fan, you owe it to yourself to see the movies in stunning hi-def.  It's a beautiful feast for the eyes, and the ears.  John Williams score hasn't sounded this clean since the original movies came out the first time, or if you were lucky enough to see Star Wars in concert and hear it live, this is as close as you can get.

7220919,5,B00YI71PN2,"I'm shocked at how immature most of these reviews are.  Writing a 5 page diatribe on why this set of amazing films is 'utter trash,' etc.  Most of these reviews are from before the product was released, based specifically on the fact that the 'Original Theatrical' editions were not included.  Those reviewers are right, they are not included, and I will say that I believe the set benefits from it.  The saga feels like it all connects, like it is one story of six films rather than two separate sagas of varying quality.  And Vader's new line at the Emperor's demise doesn't change anything.  It doesn't make him 'whiny' as so many are claiming, and will only ruin the scene if you allow it to.  I actually forgot about the new Krayt dragon call until my gf reminded me of it.

First, let's look at the content of the films.  All six star wars films stand out from the cinematic crowd in almost every way.  The costumes, design, sets, creatures, ships, etc. are all incredible to look at and really stand out in Blu-Ray.  You'll notice art on the walls of Theed palace and wonder what sort of history that piece has for their planet, and see the scratches on Plo Koon's breather.  The creativity and artistry that have gone into all six films is mind-blowing.  As is the overarching story.  I've heard a lot of people say ""Always watch 4 - 6 first.""  I'd disagree with that and say watch them in the order they're packaged and intended to be seen, 1 - 6.  Anakin becomes a much more tragic character and you'll watch 4-6 and your heart will break a little bit at his unmasking.  I was a prequel hater for a long time, but I must say that it's been 11 years since Episode I and it's time to give these movies another chance.  They really are phenomenal films, despite the acting and dialogue's stiff moments - but even the originals have some eye-roll worthy lines, so it just kind of adds to the character of the films.  It's not the Dark Knight, it's Star Wars - a samurai-western-sci-fi-fantasy with muppets.  And that is what makes it awesome.

One thing I noticed is that the originals are shot in a much more critical focus than the prequels, which does affect the way they display in HD.  There seems to be a lot more to see in the prequels, the screen estate is occupied with various eye catching designs, costumes, etc and it almost looks real.  Much of the originals are shot in critical, so the back and fore ground become more blurry.  This is more of a comment than a criticism, the focal range is part of the film's artistry, but it does create a visual discontinuity in production style.  The originals do look incredible in HD.  You can see all of Chewie's hair (and a few strays of Tarkin's), the texture of Ben's robe, etc.  They look like real people in your living room.  And the soundtrack is wondrous - getting a perfect rumble without ever peaking.

Finally, and I haven't gotten to look at all of them yet, but the special features are totally packed with content.  Each episode is divided into planets, showing the production of that particular part of the film, and within each planet are deleted scenes, concept art, interviews (which I thoroughly enjoyed and I believe are brand new), and some rotating maquettes that really show off the interactivity of your Blu Ray player.  One *slight* criticism is that there is no way to watch ALL the deleted scenes at once.  You can only watch each film's deleted scenes within each planet.  I understand this for the sake of organization, because there is SO MUCH that it would become a mess of features if it weren't split up somehow, but I did find myself getting a little lost in the menus at times.  On top of all that, there's 8 or 9 documentaries from over the years about various production aspects, and a 90 minute compilation of spoofs from all different media.  I'm really looking forward to that one.

If you're a fan of the saga, or are looking for something to really show off your home theater system, this is a worthy investment.  I already own these movies in 3 or 4 different incarnations, but this set blows them all away and was definitely worth the price of admission.  I will get enjoyment out of this for years to come.

7220922,4,B00YI71PN2,"In reading all the hate for George Lucas and the new BLU RAY set with all the changes, I was convinced to NOT buy the set. Truthfully, I have the Laserdisc set of the Special Editions and the quality is still good for me, it's even better than the 2004 DVD release. But the other day, I broke down and said, ""What the heck"" and bought it. I've watched Episode 3-5 so far. SITH looks , sounds good. ""New Hope"" is real good at spots although the black level is a little high on spots, overall a good presentation. ""Empire"" is good, a little soft at times but overall a good presentation. If I had seen it before buying would I have still bought? Probably not, however, I don't regret it. The quality is certainly better than the 2004 DVD's and overall, I'm pretty satisfied, yes the packaging could be better and it seems that FOX is not too good at placing the discs, as with the ""Planet of the Apes"" boxed set. With all the griping about all the changes, so far I haven't seen any, as for the ""Nooooo"" in Jedi, well, I'll watch that tonight but I can live with that, as well as Obi Wan's new scream in ""New Hope"". Hey, at least they removed Luke's wimpy yell while falling after his fight with Dad, Darth Vader in ""Empire"". Could the transfers have been better, absolutely, but overall, they all seem to be pretty good and not worth all the hub-bub people have been making. If you're a Star Wars fan and want a new print, then buy it if not, rent them or don't. I'm still keeping my Laser Discs and I have the VHS widescreen of the original versions and a laserdisc of Jedi in it's original form. If Lucas releases the original versions which, ""For God sakes George, listen to the fans, remaster the originals and sell them in a seperate box set"", I would buy it as well. But if they re-market and re, re-market then I'm just going to stick with these, I will not keep buying. That's ridiculous",1316390400,8,1894,4.293296089385475
7220923,4,B00YI71PN2,"I gave this item 4 stars because it isn't perfect.  In a perfect world, GL would have released the original restored theatrical versions of his movies on blu ray.  But he didn't so let's move on.

The way I look at it, you don't go to a concert to hear the EXACT same thing that was put on record do you?  You want to see or hear something a little different.  I think that's what we have here.  It's still Star Wars.

We all know Greedo shot first and Darth Vader doesn't scream ""Noooooo"" while disposing the Emperor.  Most of us probably have every single verson of all the movies so if it's that important, just throw in one of those discs in the player.

Now on to the positives.  First, I love the packaging.  Very original to make it look like a book with some beautiful artwork.  Rather than keeping the discs in individual plastic boxes or one giant box where the discs can get loose in transit.

The picture and sound quality are fantastic.  No issues with my Sony player reading and playing the discs.

The bonuses are fantastic as well.  So much more entertainment than just the movies.  9 discs for $80?  That's $8.88 per disc so you get a lot for the value.  True, there have been documentaries (i.e. the excellent ""Empire of Dreams"") that were left off.  Again,  you probably already own it somewhere else.

So I gave it four stars.  Taking one star away due to the minor changes made; leaving 4 for all the other good things about the set.",1316390400,14,1454,4.3632958801498125

7220925,5,B00YI71PN2,"The audio is great. I had it turned up quite a bit. The audio is half of the entire experience and it delivers. I added another speaker for the 6.1 experience.

To take advantage of the blu-ray tech, i hope people are viewing these discs on the right hardware. 1080p 120hz tv, blu-ray player set to 24hz, 1080p and going through at least a 5.1 surround sound receiver (with hdmi in and out) that is capable of DTS-HD Master Audio with the proper number of speakers and sub....hdmi cables all the way around.

Solution to Darth Vader's ""NOOOOOOO"" in Return of The Jedi : put your hands over your ears for those 2 seconds.

My theory on the different color of Luke's lightsaber in the Millenium Falcon is that it might of been in training mode (reduced power)

The ewoks eyelids are now cgi...big effin deal. are you that petty? i mean really.

Some complain that George put Hayden's ghost force image at the end of Return of The Jedi....my take on that was to keep continuity. Instead of an older man next to Ben and Yoda, maybe George thought people would recognize or relate to Anakin's image better. it was a young anakin that was turned to the dark side, not an older man.

changing Boba Fett's voice to Temuera Morrison's....once again...to keep continuity

I guess there are a couple of other issues people have, but from the sound of it, i can overlook these little nuances.

The picture quality is one of the best quality bluray's I have in my library.  Blurays are hit and miss as most of you know, where some are just conversions from dvd's, where the pic is grainy and not really HD.  Not here... what a great addition to my library!!

I have enjoyed Star Wars since I was a kid, and this is indeed the crown jewel of Star Wars, they did a FANTASTIC job!  Not sure how you can make 40 year old film look this crisp and clear!

I don't pretend to be a super star wars nerd where I know every second of every scene, dress up in jedi robes and painted broom sticks for light sabers when going to the movie theater (really people?), or like Han shooting Greedo first blah blah blah..

I did see the Han/Greedo scene here and it looks like they almost shoot at the same time now.  The discoloring of the desert when C3PO and R2 land from escaping with the Death Star plans has been fixed.  Also the sound from when Obi-Wan saves Luke from the sand people (that WOOOOOOOOO sound) has been changed from the previous Triology DVD collection.

I am not a Lucas hater, but I'm not a fanboy either.  I just enjoy watching Star Wars.  Again, I think one would be hard pressed to say that they would be disappointed with this purchase.  It also comes with several bonus blurays with bonus material.

I don't watch Star Wars films everyday, so I couldn't tell you the difference between theatrical version vs. director version or whatever ...

I actually own the BluRay set, purchased from Amazon. I still don't understand how people write reviews about items they don't own or haven't seen, or items that haven't been released yet.

Bottom line you get six Star Wars films on BluRay plus hours and hours of extras (9 discs total) for $79.99.  Picture and sound are awesome.
The only thing is that the packaging could have been a little better.  If you want to, you can buy individual cases.

If you like the films, buy the set.  If you don't like the films, don't buy the set.

I will keep my DVD sets with the original movies, but I must say I'm not bothered at all by the changes Lucas made.  Most of them are like a welcome surprise.  I will say that I still have to watch ROTJ to see the famous ""NOOOOOOOOO"" scene and if I hate it I'll lower my rating.  I should know after tonight. But so far, I'm good with this set.

BTW, the movies look & sound great.  High def really serves to great benefit when playing these files on a large screen TV.  If you have kids (not really young ones, though), they will enjoy this!

7220934,1,B00YI71PN2,"Who didn't love the original Star Wars movies? Lucas has steadily ruined them against his own fans/customer's wishes and the latest Blu-ray release with it's 'improvements' only added insult to injury after promised corrections that never came.

It's bad enough were stuck with Jar Jar, yet various other key scenes remain edited and ruined, or only fixed partially with a single frame fixed out of several giving a sloppy impression of the editing that was done.

Given their track record, there will probably be yet another 1-2 more Blu-ray box set releases yet none will ever truly be fixed or give the series back to the fans.",1316390400,16,630,4.878504672897196
7220935,5,B00YI71PN2,"I absolutely love this release. It is truly for the definitive release. Never have I had the urge to sit so close to the screen to get all the detail.

I first watched the original trilogy in 1995 on LaserDisc on a big screen. I remember not liking it too much. 1997 I saw the special edition on Laserdisc also. I loved the changes they made and for the first time I loved the trilogy with the release of the Special Edition. Lucas is a visionary to update outdated clunky models with bad makeup with CGI versions.

The best edit done since 1997 was the removal of that corny Emporer model with the monkey eyes superimposed of it. Replacing that with a superimposed Ian Abercrombie was the most brilliant move yet by Mr. Lucas.

Bad hue of the lightsabers inherent in many versions has been fixed, and the red hot white core was CGI'd in to the lightsabers in most cases.

The new ending to Jedi is awesome. I won't spoil it. I like all the edits to it however. I never cared for the ending originally as I don't particularly like ewoks but this new ending makes it far more palatable.

Those who want the horrible original theatrical versions will be disappointed to know that Lucas himself said they were destroyed as part of the retransfer for the 1997 special editions. He gracefully provided a professional LaserDisc AD conversion to DVD but people still weren't satisfied. Truly, Lucas is darned if he does and darned if he doesn't!

Replacing the poorly done Yoda puppet in Episode I with a CGI one was a very smart move. That was one thing that irked me wrong when I saw it in theaters. Now, Episode I is perfect to me.

Some gripes: Grain was artificially added unfortunately in some places for the prequel trilogy. This is necessary though because some shots were digital sourced and others film. You can't have inconsistencies where one scene has no grain and another has a bunch. Also, Ep. II-III were filmed in 1080p/24 and not 4K or 8K. I chalk this to technological limitations at the time. Unfortunately, the latter issue can never be rectified. It will always be in a resolution that isn't viable for excessive editing.

Overall I find the picture quality to be great -- plenty of bitrate. The audio was awesome on my Marantz SR4600. The dynamic range blows you out of your film viewing chair when starships explode.

I can't wait to see the 3D theatrical re-releases! With technology and graphic processing units getting more powerful and energy efficient simultaneously each day Lucas will be able to make non-discernible CGI models for the 3-D re-releases.",1316390400,14,2576,4.656387665198238
7220936,2,B00YI71PN2,"I bought this mostly because of the amazing special features and HD content, but it wasn't without some chalkboard screeching visuals and audio that really puts a damper on the classic Original Trilogy films.

What I seriously don't get after all these years is the resounding voices of the vast majority of people isn't enough to get through to Lucas' head that people want what they fell in love with, not a shoddy CGI-updated version of something that really didn't need additions to hold up the films today.  They were wonderful as-is.

I could understand improving the composites and removing matte boxes and saber fixes and such, things that were in error to be fixed in that regard I would be all for, but the Original Trilogy movies are now just riddled with crap that makes my eyes and ears unpleased.

I can't believe ""NOOOO!"" Was added to ROTJ and I still can't get over Lapti Nek being cut entirely and the addition of the Sarlaac beak. If you're being digested slowly over 1000 years I would say just a static open gaping mouth is FREAKY as-is and needs no stupid CG beak!

I really don't know what's gone through Lucas' head over the years, but these changes are absurd. There's a big difference between fixes and changes. I welcome the great new 6.1 sound mix. WELL DONE!

George, you've clearly disappointed MANY in what you've changed in the Original Trilogy. I don't think i've ever seen such a consistency in complaints about these blu-rays anywhere else in a movie series.

To the people who say ""GEORGE CAN DO WHAT HE WANTS!""  Yes, he can, and they are his movies. Total given and I understand.  I guess you could think of it as you are living in your house as a small child, your parents give you a bedroom and you love it for years.  One day they come in when you're 15 and say, ""We're going to patch up the window, lower the ceiling a foot and paint your walls neon orange cuz we felt it needed to be changed.  So you're now going to have to live with that.""  Would you like that?  Of course not!  The room is part of your life and important to you, but that doesn't matter because your parents can do to it whatever they like because it's your parents' house, not yours.",1316390400,11,2195,4.455
7220937,5,B00YI71PN2,"I was not going to purchase this new blu-ray set based on the other Amazon reviews I've read and the fact that I was reticent in spending more $$$ because I have purchased all previous versions of this series and felt that I did not want to buy everything but again. However, there were others that reviewed this set AFTER they purchased this set which lead me decide to purchase this set and I AM GLAD I DID.

I have been an avid fan of all of these films since the FIRST, first movie was released. The ""issues"" brought up by previous reviewers were not ""issues"" at all, but tweeks to add to the film's watchability. Although these tweeks are noticeable (But only if you have seen each film multiple times, multiplied by a gazillion), I feel that these tweeks do not detract from the film and do not ruin the foundation of the storyline.

I believe there are fanANTICS that will complain for the sake of complaining. I believe instead, people should be thankful that there are those who wish to make and create the best movie experience possible and it seems the team at Lucasfilm are just that sort.

If you are on the fence about purchasing this blu-ray issue of these epic films, I assert that this set will be an excellent addition to your movie (specially Star Wars) collection.",1316390400,11,1284,4.502145922746781

7220942,4,B00YI71PN2,"Okay, I'm not going to review all six movies based on their content.  I'm just going to do transfers and new special features.  To start I actually like all six Star Wars films.  Sure, I could nitpick all of the prequels and Jedi all day, but I still like them.  My least favorite films in this series end up being Jedi and Phantom Menace.  But onto the actual product.....

As far as transfers alone this set deserves FIVE STARS.  These movies have never looked better.  Really.  It's unreal.  Of course the prequels, being shot digitally, look the best, but the original trilogy looks only a spec less.  The sound is the best I've ever heard on blu ray honestly.  You can hear star ships zoom by your head on either side for all six films.  Clone Wars' scene between Obi Wan and Jengo in the astroid field works the best.  Ben Burt's sound design really shines here.  The only negative I can think of with the new Hi-Def transfers for the original trilogy I can muster is that some of the cut and paste comp works in outer space involving the space ships are more obvious.  YOu can see the matte lines around the flying ships.  I remember seeing this on the original VHS's I owned as a child, but I didn't notice them when watching these films on the last dvd release.  If back in 1997 Lucas went to all the trouble of making the comp lines in the Hoth battle in Empire less transluscent than why not touch that up too?  Your guess is as good as mine.

At this point everyone, EVERYONE, knows that Lucas tweaks and adds to his original trilogy and even the prequels(remember the added scene in Phantom Menace on Coruscant, and the added sound effects in the stadium duel in Clone Wars?), and this release is no different.  There are less tweaks here, but they are there.  Firstly, on Episode IV we get a new sound effect replacing Obi Wan's original dragon call on tatooine.  It's more shrill and scary.  It adds to the scene, but defintely doesn't detract from the original premise.  Necessary?  Nope.  Distracting?  Not really, unless you need to get a life, of course.  Episode V only had one noticeable change and that was replacing the original actor who voiced Boba Fett with actor Tumuera Morrison who played his father Jengo Fett in Episode II, and played ALL the clones in the prequel trilogy.  Episode VI has only one change as well that I noticed, additional dialogue for Darth Vader when he kills the Emperor.  He gets a line of ""No"" and a redub reflecting his big ""Nooooooo"", at the end of Revenge of the Sith.  Really unnecessary, but not a deal breaker.  I didn't find the moment in Sith funny, but rather nostalgic for the old Universal Frankenstein films, so this doesn't bring up bad memories or really bother me.  But at the end of the day it is totally unnecessary and really unwarranted.

The prequels, as far as I could tell, were totally untouched with the exception of Phantom Menace.  They replaced the awkward puppet used in this prequel and replaced him with a digital version that fits more with the next two prequel's Yoda.  This I don't mind.  I never liked the Yoda puppet in Phantom Menace, it looked worse than the one used in Empire and Jedi.  The puppetry by Frank Oz was great as always but the look was all wrong down from material for skin to the lighting.  He looked like a cheesy puppet, which the original trilogy's Yoda really truly didn't.  Honestly, this brings another factor to my attention.  If Lucas is going over and trying to 'perfect' all these movies than when is he going to get around to digitizing Yoda in Empire and Jedi?  Or when is he going to add articulation to the Ewoks?  What about Episode IV's Chewbacca?  Chewy looks the weakest in that entry, especially in blu ray.  YOu can actually see the lines in the mask around the eyes more often than the later films. I'm not saying I do or don't want this, but when is it going to happen?  Spielberg animated E.T.'s face for his special edition of E.T., so why not Yoda in Empire?  We'll see....

Okay, and now onto the three special features discs.  This is my major complaint regarding this set and this is why I didn't give it a full five stars which it deserved.  None, and I mean NONE, of the special features produced for the original Prequel releases, and the first release of the original trilogy are here on any of the three special features discs.  So, I have to keep the fourth disc from the original trilogy release, which has the wonderful almost all encompassing Empire of Dreams doc, and the prequel trilogy had great finished deleted scenes.  Especially the doc for Phantom Menace which had a doc regarding the making of that film and it was very intersting and entertaining.

Okay, disc seven of the bonus material is all about the prequel trilogy.  It's sparse as far as running time goes, but adds up when you break down the interactive material which consists of concept art, stroyboards, animatics, and turn table vies of vehicles and characters.  Cool stuff, but I garuntee you'll only watch it once.  The interviews are cool but mostly filler when it comes to the actors, but all the technical guys, and Lucas himself is very good, and you can't find it anywhere in previous prequel release.  We get some more deleted scenes too, but they're not 'finished' like the ones released with the dvds.  They are rough and have temp animation.  Most of these are not that interesting, not because of quality, but because they add up to little more than ancilary bits and extensions of scenes.  Nothing important here.

Disc 8, is the same as disc 7 but this time regarding the original trilogy.  The interviews have more depth, but they seem like take outs, or extensions removed from the excellent Empire of Dreams dvd.  Seeing the concept art here is wonderful due to the fact that they are so old.  It's great to have this stuff on file finally, but the real meat of the original trilogy comes into play with disc 9.

Disc 9 has a great archival collection of features released back in the 70's and 80's and as recent as 2010!  The Making of Star Wars(back when it was simply called Star Wars) is wonderful, if slightly more truncating and missing retrospect when compared to Empire of Dreams, runs about 49 minutes and covers all the prodution details but, for obvious reasons, doesn't go into the hardships taken on by Lucas.  Empire Strikes Back: SPFX runs 48 minutes and basically just sticks with the visual effects aspect of this film.  While, again, missing intimate details regarding the production and behind the scenes stuff you sure get to know how that film's ingenious visuals were realized.  Classic Creatures: Return of the Jed runs 48 minutes and is my favorite of the original film's vintage docs.  It just fouces on the practical creatures and puppetry heavily employed for this sequel.  I don't know why but I still get a kick out of men and women building, operating and deseigning practical creature effects.  Repeat info regarding Jabba's creation comes from Empire of Dreams but it doesn't do that in other areas, and it's hosted by Carrie Fisher and Billy Dee Williams.  Anatomy of a Dewback is a 26 minute doc I remember watching back when the original films were being re-released in their special edition form back in 1997.  It basically painstakingly goes over the restoration of the original trilogy, and the scene that was added with the Storm Troopers riding the dewbacks in the desert.  Lucas gives his reasons, regarding asthetic and storytelling for this addition.  This is the only new secene covered in this doc, but it is really fun.  Star Warriors is a feature length doc running 84 minutes about a Star Wars club that has 'movie authentic' costumes that they do free charity work in.  It's about their trek to getting a march in a big Rose Bowl parade.  YAAAAAAAAAAWN.  Star Wars Tech is a 46 minute doc straight from TV regarding Star Wars technology and how fact based it is, and how possible it is to become true, and how much of it actually DID come true.  Very cool.  A Conversation with the Masters: The Empire Strikes Back 30 Years later is a 2010 doc only running 25 minutes but has new interviews with Lucas, director Irvin Kershner and screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan reagarding the most loved of the original trilogy.  Very neat, especially hearing from Kasdan, but it mostly repeats ino discussed in Empire of Dreams.

Finally, the last new special feature is a 97 minute compilation of various Star Wars references and parodies from over the years in movies and TV.  We get clips from Robot Chicken and Family Guy(of course!), but we also get clips from Clerks, Fanboys, The Donnie and Marie Show, many various seasons of Saturday Night Live(fav being the lost audition tapes for A New Hope starring Kevin Spacey doing dead on and hysterical impressions of Christopher Walken and Jack Lemon), How I Met Your Mother, and many others.  Funny enough, but you can find these clips easily on the net, and honestly this, and the Star Warriors, feature I would easily trade in for a Hi-Def version of Empire of Dreams and ALL the prequel DVD's special features.

The one retained special feature from the dvd's is all six films' commentary tracks, which are great!!!  The best info you'll get about the films.  There is a new commentary track added to each film which mixes the original commentaries with archive interviews with various producers, FX guys, and the actors.  I've only listened to Sith for this, and it's good, but I would rather have had the interviews seperated.  Also, some of the snippets on this commentary are repeats from the interviews presented in the special features discs.

So, there you have it.  It's a mixed bag.  If you're an uber fan, but not a total dweeb, like me you'll want to hold onto your bonus discs from the previous releases unfortunately.  I'm sure we'll being seeing more Star Wars on blu ray in my lifetime, probably three times more.  The transfers and sound make it worth and some of the special features.  Really, the real question comes down to this: why have the orginal bonus materials not been included on the very roomy blu ray discs, especially when there are 9 discs?  And, of course, WHERE THE HELL ARE THE REMASTERED HI-DEF COPIES OF THE UNALTERED ORIGINAL TRILOGY?????  It baffles me with sooooo many fanboys asking for this that Lucas still hasn't given it.  Why?  At least for posterities sake this should happen.  I'm sure it will one day.......

The gentlemanly thing for Lucas to do would be to include all versions of the films, like with nearly every other major Blu Ray release (Apocalypse Now, Blade Runner, Aliens, Star Trek The Original Series, etc), to make all camps happy. But I can live with the changes.

The actual movies themselves all look great in HD. Sound and picture is excellent and these movies have never looked better. The cartoonish CGI in The Phantom Menace shows up quite a bit in this set, though. Overall, in terms of actual HD presentation, they've done a great job.

The extras are actually my biggest disappointment. None of the deleted scenes from the prequel DVDs (Shaak Ti's death, Yoda arriving on Dagobah, etc) are included on this set. That's right, you'll have to keep your DVDs. That is very stingy, in my opinion, and it would not have been too hard to include the extras from the DVDs. It just reeks of a cash grab. None of the docos from the DVDs are here, either.

The extras we do have are threadbare. A few brief interviews (which sound like PR soundbites), concept art and photo galleries (who actually cares about these things?), stupid spoofs which one can find anywhere on the Net, etc. The deleted scenes that are presented here are in horrible condition. They're mostly unfinished, filthy prints, with no studio dubbing (so you can't really hear anything), or CGI animatics (in the case of the prequels).

The extras are very disappointing. Don't buy this for the extras.

those bonus discs! the first two have technical coding problems which make them freeze up or in the best case appear choppy.
 I did the firmware upgrade thinking it would resolve the issue but it did not.

Seeing these movies on my HDTV in 1080i (sure ANH, TESB, ROTJ, and TPM were not filmed in 1080i) looks great so much better then any DVD.

As for the changes I'm a Star Wars fan I love the Star Wars Saga and having them look the way they do on my TV well I still have my DVDs but I don't know how often I will go back and watch them on DVD.

I can tell you that the video and audio quality on this edition in phenomenal assuming you have the right equipment.  I'm sorry some of you don't like Mr. Lucas' changes.  Are the disruptive for those of us who have seen some of the episodes hundreds of times?  Maybe, but get over it.  The pros FAR outweigh the cons.

For $80 you get 8 discs with an unbelievable amount of extra material.  Do the math.  The junk movies released 2 months after theatrical release today cost $20-$25 each and are not written, acted, or produced to the quality of these 6 wonderful movies and yet this box set cost you $10/disc.  Show me why it's not worth it.  Simply put, if you'll allow your mind to embrace the vision that is George Lucas' you will likely be VERY happy with this set.

Time has passed, technologies have improved and Lucas is now able to render the films closer to what he invisioned orginally, but was thwarted due to the lack of technolgy at the time. As all things,when we go back, we always make them better due to us knowing more, and/or having more expertice available and now seeing things clearer and better.
So for those who remain in the past, the outhouse can be either a cold, or hot place. Me, I prefer modern indoor plumbing. That's the way these new films are - an upgrade!

7220951,1,B00YI71PN2,"First of all, the Blu-ray release is superb in almost every way from a technical standpoint.  The sound and picture are amazing and raise the bar on Blu-ray releases.  However, you need to realize that ALL of the deleted scenes that were on the DVD releases are absent from the Blu Ray release.  To say that this is frustrating is an understatement.  When I preordered this set, I expected a near definitive collection of material in one set along with the material previously released.  This is not the case.

For example, on the Revenge of the Sith DVD, viewers are treated to a deleted scene on the bonus disc of Yoda arriving in exile on Dagobah which was to be included at the end of the film.  This, along with all other previously released deleted scenes are absent from the BluRay set.  It is not in the extras nor is it in any of the documentaries.  In order to highlight this scene's importance, supposedly this scene was released in the European theatrical release and the producer, Rick McCallum, states on the Revenge of the Sith DVD that this scene should have been included in the actual movie.

Where are the original takes of ""human Jabba""?  How could this be omitted?  We saw this before in previous releases.  Why not throw it on one of the nine Blu Ray discs?  What about the previous documentaries and other interviews?  I honestly feel cheated if I have to keep a DVD edition as well as a Blu Ray edition in order to have all of the material.  After basically giving away the DVDs I feel compelled to buy them again in order to have the complete set of extras.

While studios and directors should take note of the technical aspects of this Blu-ray release, they should learn from these blu-ray editions should not leave the customer feeling cheated by their purchase.  Hopefully Spielberg keeps this in mind for the eventual release of the Indiana Jones movies and ET.

***EDIT***
I want to add one thing.  Take a look at the product description.  Amazon compares the DVD releases with the Blu-ray editions.  If you look at ""bonus features"" Amazon states that they are the same as what was released on the DVD then has a listing for new bonus features.  It looks as if Amazon was duped by Lucas as well as the general consumer.",1316304000,18,2249,4.553615960099751
7220952,5,B00YI71PN2,"Of all the movies I have seen on Blu-ray, these are the best looking. Each movie is on a 50GB disc, rather than the usual 25GB. A properly calibrated TV will show you stunning color and detail unparalleled by anything else out there. The 6.1 Audio is beautiful. These make the DVD releases seem like they were covered in fuzzy scotch tape.
The special features alone merit a purchase. After spending 5 hours on them, I have barely scratched the surface. It features amazing turnarounds of props with detailed pictures of various areas of each one. The documentaries on the 9th disc are all very interesting. Anyone who has a Blu-ray player and an HDTV needs these, and those without need to upgrade for this.
Quit fussing over minor changes that are far less impactful than the low quality of your DVDs and VHSs. I had very high expectations for their quality, and they easily exceeded those.
For 90 bucks, this is a steal and easily worth the money at full price as well.",1316304000,15,972,4.591954022988506
7220953,1,B00YI71PN2,"I used to love Star Wars, the original trilogy was awesome. WAS being operative word here. Lucas has changed them so much, that they're not even the same movies anymore. I wouldn't mind all these changes if they made the movies better, but that's not the case at all. It's like every change is designed to make the original trilogy just as bad as the prequels, so that it will seem more like they are part of a single story. A very bad, poorly written, single story. Well, congratulations, Lucas, you've managed to take something awesome (the original trilogy), and make it into a long single story that I have zero interest in. All of the changes you've made to these movies are the single reason I still own a VHS Player, So I can watch the original three movies as they once were, perfect.
 Remember the scene in Star Wars, (back when it was just called 'Star Wars', before they added the 'new hope' to the title), remember when Obi Wan talks about how Vader was a great jedi once, and a good freind, before he turned to the darkside, 'more machine, than man, now'? That's what Star Wars: The original trilogy is like, once was a great film, beloved, and respected, now a mere shadow of itself, more a smorgasbord of digital animations and add-ons now, than the film I once loved.....As the new Vader would say, 'NOOOOOOOO......!'",1316304000,19,1333,4.554166666666666
7220954,2,B00YI71PN2,"The reality is, the problems extant here didn't begin with this release.  Often ignored is the fact that there were DOZENS of changes to the movies over the twenty years following their initial theatrical releases (prior to the 1997 special edition).  They were non-invasive, mostly sound related, and did nothing to add or detract. Nobody got bent out of shape about these production edits, because they were mostly imperceptible and not impactful whatsoever to the story.  Admittedly, we all scratched our heads when George began modifying the original trilogy back in the mid-90's.  It felt strange to alter a story that was so well-defined and coherent, not to mention already ingrained into our collective consciousness.

But while those 1997 re-do's certainly generated plenty of controversy within the fanbase, there were some gem moments that really made the films pop again.  The new scene with Jabba was a terrific addition, because it added to the story and clarified character relationships.  Even the ever-hated ""Han shot first"" change was somewhat understandable, as it did nothing to take away from Han being a badass (he still shot Greedo at point blank range, after all) - it just meant Han wasn't a flat out murderer.  Certainly the extensive rework on the sound, the cleanup of bad special effects remnants, and the addition of gorgeous new scenery, ships, and environments was something to be applauded.  So even while the hardcore fans cried foul, I found the Special Editions to be a generally ok upgrade to the originals.

Unfortunately though, this is where the cracks in the wall began.  In the Special Editions we also got our first taste of something we'd end up getting in spades with Phantom Menace... cheesy, poorly placed, poorly timed, and poorly delivered comedy.  The added shot in ANH of the Jawa being bucked off his mount at Mos Eisley is supposed to be funny, but is unnecessary and adds nothing.  The extended band segment in Jabba's palace in ROTJ (the most egregiously bad decision of the 1997 Special Edition) feels grossly out of place, and brings silliness rather than feelings of danger, uneasiness, and foreboding.  It undermines the story that is about to unfold - or at the very least, fails to help set it up properly.

Everyone knows the prequel trilogy is filled with this bad comedy problem - personified, of course, in the character of Jar Jar Binks - but there's more to it than just that.  Why is a line like, ""You came in that thing?  You're braver than I thought"" a hundred times more funny than anything in the prequel trilogy?  Timing, context, delivery, and not having that feeling of being set up and forced.  Throughout the prequel trilogy, bad comedy decisions coupled with dozens of insincere and stiff performances leave one repeatedly asking ""THAT was the best take on that scene??"". It demonstrates that George is losing sight of what makes a great scene - or even great delivery of a few lines. The fact that he would ok the ROTS scene with Vader screaming that awful ""Noooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" is proof enough of that.  Imagine the difference if that had been simply a cry of defeat, reflecting a moment of immeasurable blinding anguish and pain.  Instead, it was laughable and became an internet meme.  I was embarrassed for Anakin, not sorry for him!

The 2004 DVD editions once again focused on improving sound and fixing issues - although as many know, the color of these editions was quite poor.  Again, fanboys fumed about some of the changes to ROTJ in particular, but they were generally in line with trying to tie the prequels together more effectively, which I can understand.

As we arrive at these new BluRay editions, it's worth pointing out that they're BEAUTIFUL.  SW has never looked this good, period.  It was a good idea to replace the Yoda puppet in Phantom Menace with CG, as it never looked quite right.  Most of the other changes are incidental and add value.  But the addition of Vader's ""No. Noooo!"" in ROTJ undermines a wondrous moment in cinema.  That close up on Vader's mask as he watches his son being tortured requires NO EXPOSITION.  We can see the inner turmoil and mental reconciliation all culminating in the moment he takes action to save his son.  But now, poorly placed dialog - the greatest failing of the prequel trilogy - is thrust upon the original trilogy.  True, the average viewer doesn't know or care that it used to be better... but these two stars are for George, who has lost the ability to write dialog and is making things worse with each additional release of these wonderful films.",1316304000,12,4601,4.850192061459667

I still think that replacing the actor who played Darth Vader with the new Anakin from the later movies was (still is) wrong but that does not mean these movies are not awesome! The quality is just great and having watching them already, I can attest that it is true.  Besides, the price is just a bargain and the extras (I have not watch them all) are pretty good.

Lucas always does a great job of taking care of his movies but I will not be buying this or any SW set for one reason.....this is just the first of many, many, many, many, many releases and the content of each release will be different from the other and none of them will have everything on it requiring the fans to buy several different movie sets if they want all of the additional content. George has been doing this since the videotape era. One set comes out and it is great then later on down the road another set is released with additional content but lacking content of previous sets then another variation is released and so on. I have no desire to jump on that never ending 'candy trail' of a roller coaster. One does not have to watch these on bluray to understand what has been going on since the videotape era regarding these releases to make this decision.
Like I said, I believe this set will look FANTASTIC on blu-ray and the additional content will be very enjoyable and I think people that do buy this will not be disappointed at all but don't get upset when, in a year or so, another blu-ray boxed set or individual releases are released with more or less on it cause it WILL happen.",1316304000,10,1309,4.346938775510204

7220963,5,B00YI71PN2,"Received the entire saga on the release day (Sept 16 2011) and I'm very impressed. I was questioning my purchase after reading all the reviews by avid fans who are disappointed, but decided to stick with it. My son and I have recently watching episodes IV, V, VI and now we were ready for episode I so it was either:
a) rent it
b) buy it on dvd
c) buy on the first three episodes on blu-ray
d) buy the entire saga on blu-ray

I'm very happy I bought the whole saga on blu-ray. Since I had just watched Return of the Jedi on DVD recently that was the first disc I popped in for comparison. I was really impressed with the quality of the picture and vibrancy / depth of the colors and sound. Any concerns about ""pink"" light sabers were washed away by the superior picture provided by blu-ray. Yes, the color transfer could be questioned for some scenes, but if you think about the process of converting film to HD capture, there are always trade-offs and you start with a baseline to give the best overall results and depth - do you then go back to every scene and set a new baseline? probably not... it looks plenty good enough!

The thing I was most ""concerned"" about was the addition of Vader saying ""No.."". I really thought this would bother me a lot, but upon watching I thought it was natural enough in the context of the film. Should Lucas have made this change? Well, he's been tweaking these movies now for several iterations... and I think it really was up to him as to how to package the entire saga. Might it be nice to eventually see the original features undisturbed? sure... but I can also appreciate the perfectionist approach that produced this end to end packaged saga which fits all 6 episodes together nicely.

I'm happy with my purchase and I consider it a great deal for the price. If I could pick only one version to own on blu-ray (e.g. undoctored original vs. latest attempt at perfection) it would be a hard decision, but I'm happy with the ""finely tuned"" version Lucas has provided and I probably won't be giving away my old DVD's so I'll have something a bit closer to the original. Thinking of it this way it means your old DVD's are not irrelevant, and may still be worth something to you...

7220966,5,B00YI71PN2,"I got my copy and watched the first movie with my wife.  The picture was amazing on my 50 inch plasma. The sound on my 7.1 was riveting.  Jar Jar held up very well and the lightsaber battles didn't look effects heavy, it looked ""real"" or believable is more like it.  The Menu Screen was ok.  Nice, tight, but ehh bland.... I do miss the THX setup tool from the original DVD's. It may be found with the extras though.

There are a couple of things that I do not recall noticing from the theater or DVD version, one is Darth Maul speaking.  I never really cared for TPM, too much setup not enough story in my mind.  He may have spoken before, but somehow I don't think so.  I will have to check the DVDs at some point.  Another was the pod racers reving their engines prior the race starting.  Again, maybe was there before, maybe it is the better sound now.  Any other changes blended right in and I didn't notice them (or recall them now if I did) from my viewing.  One strange thing is that I found Jake Lloyds acting to be, well, better.  Don't know why that is.  Maybe because I am a decade older and view the acting styles differently.  But I now think he did a fine job with the script he was handed.

I will do a review for each one as I watch them. I must say however, that I am glad I dropped the 80 bucks on it.  I can't understand why people are hating on this for minor changes made by GL to HIS movies.  These movies are not OUR artistic or intellectual property.  They are HIS.  Everything I have seen so far blends in or is an improvement.

Episode 2: Honest, I really didn't see any major changes from the DVD / Theater release.  What I did see was a huge amount of background detail!  You can make out the background characters, they are doing whacky things at times, check out Dex's diner.  The human waitress actually looks like she is in a diner.  C3-PO when he falls in the factory does NOT look like a cartoon!  The movie looked very polished.  Things looked used and worn in.  The colors during the speeder chase where very realistic.  I was constantly looking around at the scenes, saying to myself ""hey I didn't notice that before.""  I could not tell if things where added in, or are just now drawing the eye because of the detail.  The one thing I did not care for is that the romance still feels forced at times between Padme and Anakin.  The visuals and sound are on par with my Episode 1 review above.

One thing I was thinking about is people complaining about the explosions.  Really folks, if you are that concerned about them looking realistic, maybe you should consider that we have no idea what materials and gases are going into said explosion?  That being said, I really enjoyed the asteroid belt chase sequence for its visual effects and explosions. :) Oh and the surround sound for the sonic explosion was floor shaking.  If you are that much of a purist though, why aren't you complaining that there should be no sound in space??????

So to repeat what others have said, only review the movie if you have seen it!  Do you really think your review calling for a boycott will gain traction?  For every one of you who are closed minded, there are 20 others willing to buy this release and watch it.  Trust me, GL don't care if you decide not to give him your money.

Don't let their nit- picking ruin it for the millions who don't care if Vader's light saber is more pink than red.  For me, the Extras discs are great since I haven't spent the better part of my life searching for and watching every bit of Star Wars video that's ever been posted on the Web.  It's all new for me.  On the Extras Disc #3, the Spoofs had me laughing hard.  Also, did the critics expect Lucas to completely re-do Star Wars just for the BR release?  Wasn't going to happen.  Heck, why not just request that Lucas re-shoot Star Wars from scratch?  After all, new film and digital cinematography would make for a better film, right?  Anyways, if you love Star Wars for the sheer fun that it was meant to be, buy the set.  My suggestion is to buy the Complete Saga just for the box.

7220974,5,B00YI71PN2,"Don't pay much attention to the Star Wars Fanboys that give the movies 1 star because some of thier favorite scenes were alterted. These are the Special Editions that came out in the theatres during the 90s - the Special Editions are not your dads Star Wars. This is Star Wars for a new generation.

I saw a New Hope back then (90s) and loved the changes - all my friends that saw the movie back then (in their teens) loved the Special Editions too (I remember talking about the movies in school). Now I understand the people who saw these movies in the late 70s and 80s want the unaltered versions, but you have the DVDs with 80s type quality if that is your fancy.

So if you have moved on (I presume you did if you own a bluray player) keep reading. The bluray movie is breath taking.

1. amazing 5.1 sound - the intro will make your entertainment room rock. They did not skimp on sound, the space scenes with the engine sounds of the various space ships, light sabers sounding like they would shatter your tv, and explosions that sound like they were real and happened in your house. It is clear thy Star Wars has never sounded this good.

2. great HD picture with perfect blacks and depth - this is HD done right (unlike some movies that just do a simple transfer that looks like a burned DVD on a Bluray) Star Wars has never looked this good. They made a 70s movie (new hope) looked like it was released in 2011. The skin tone colors for the actors are right, hair color is perfect, backgrounds look real, I could not believe this is a 70s movie watching this. Space scenes looked perfect black was dark black, stars looked like you were in space, planets looked real, depth in space scenes was perfect, light sabers glowed, were perfectly red and blue and looked redone to me. there is no way Star Wars has ever looked better.

3. Extras touches/improvements evident throughout (go to the official website where this is covered) - They include scenes never released before from the vaults to entice the fans that have bought the movies 4xs already (this is my first time buying a full set).

In conclusion, as a first time purchaser of the movies (I waited for Bluray as an early adopter of Bluray) I am very impressed and can tell the movies were redone right. I am sure your experience can differ based on your TV and Bluray player, but know that if your picture settings are correct, you will fall out of your seat with perfect visuals that make a 70s movie looked like it was released in the 10s.

The films NEVER looked or sounded as good as they do on Bluray! The special features on disc 7 & 8 are outstanding! Personally, I'm glad that the special features from the Episode I, II, III and 2004 box DVD set aren't included. It would render those useless. Between the DVD's and this Bluray set the only thing, in my opinion, that's missing is a few more deleted scenes from Episodes I, II & III.  The ""Collection"" is incredible bonus feature.

IGNORE all the whinny 40 somethings that can't move past there own childhood! This is Star Wars at it's finest!!!! The films HAVE NOT changed, the story and characters are the same they where back in 1977, 80 and 83. They simply look better then they ever did before!

I've seen the changes Lucas has made to the film.  Sure, he ""owns"" the films, but a film is a group project, requiring hundreds of actors and artists, making decisions, creating moments that make the film.  When Lucas changes the film, he disrespects the creativity and work that went into making the film by the original cast and crew.

Furthermore, it disrespects my memory. I've grown up with Star Wars.  I was born on the day A New Hope came out.  I've seen the originals hundreds of times.  But the changes Lucas made has changed the films in rather significant ways that do not match up to why I love these films.

Sure, he has the ""right"" to change them, to ""revise"" them, but should he? The film was made for the audience to watch . . . and it was a generations that watched it.  By changing the film, he is alienating those generations.  He is changing our history.

7220979,4,B00YI71PN2,"From someone who actually owns and has seen the Blu ray set here is review...

1. Video quality 4.5 out of 5. - Definitely the best these movies have ever looked. In Empire Strikes Back, you can vividly see the fur on the tauntaun. The special edition additions were blended in much better then with the previous DVD set. I'm not a fan of the Special editions, this set makes it more bare able. The prequels look on par with the original trilogy, however episode 3 is the show stopper. By far the best picture quality of the set.

2. Audio 7 out of 5. - The sound on this set is amazing. I couldn't believe my ears as the Tie's were buzzing past my ears from my home theater.

The only reason I am giving this set 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't include the original theatrical versions. If you're a star wars fan and are on the fence about this set, its definitely an upgrade from the DVD's.",1316304000,21,903,4.208092485549133
7220980,1,B00YI71PN2,"The title says it all. Stop changing these movies. Remaster them properly, and release the original versions.

7220981,5,B00YI71PN2,"Has anyone noticed or does anyone care that every one of the over 1300 reviews written for this box set were submitted weeks, even months before the set was actually released? Reviews written by people that have not seen the DVD's. Reviews written by people that have collected mis-information and half truths from internet blogs and from other rabid fans.

This is my opinion after watching the entire set:

No, this is not the complete end all be all definitive everything Star Wars that was ever made all in one place set (which it was never advertised as or even teased as)

Yes, it is a fantastic collection of Star Wars bonus and extra material and all of the films on BR presented beautifully. Wonderful picture and wonderful sound. Really nice, simple packaging and a good solid retail price with some nice retail extras depending on where you bought your set.

As for the re-tooling, tweaking and other changes:

This material is George Lucas vision, his property. He can change it as much as he wants based on his changing taste, modern technology or even on his mood on a particular day. It's his to do with as he pleases and he clearly pleases to ignore (in general) fan outbursts and distaste and to continue to ""improve"" his vision of what his property should be, it's his prerogative. I personally do not agree with it but as a business person, I understand it.

Will there ever be a COMPLETE box set? Probably. Will it have ALL versions of the films? Probably. Will it have the holiday special, SW toy commercials, Muppets and ALL of the features & featurette's ever made? probably. Will it include the complete Ewoks & Droids? Probably. Will it include bloopers and out takes? Probably. Will it cost $79.99? Probably not.

The kind of box set people want (myself included) will be a twelve (or more) disc set and will cost more like $199.00

Will it be made, why not? Lucas Film is a money making machine, an empire that employs thousands. It should be made, I believe it will be made and I do not believe that releasing this BR box set was a bad thing. It's a business and in order to run a business you need to release new product. 300 Different Boba Fett action figures, release and re release of EVERY playset and vehicle ever made, re releases of all of the vintage items (which essentially killed the secondary market) and on, and on, AND ON and people are complaining about the first Star Wars BR release?! JUST SILLY!

Stop whining and either buy it or don't, you all know that you already have the VHS collection(s), the DVD collection(s), the Laser Disc collection(s), and all of the bootleg VCD's & DVD's sitting in your collections (in my own collection too!). What is another $79.99 going to hurt to have the series in stunning BR?

Get over it and start saving your paper route money for the next ""COMPLETE"" BR box set! (Just like i'm doing and I can tell you that the news paper bag is killing my shoulder!)

In the mean time, enjoy your new BR box set because you know that you, me and every person that complained still ran out and bought it.",1316304000,21,3076,4.534296028880866
7220982,5,B00YI71PN2,"Star Wars is the best saga ever... why?

The movies:
They work at so many levels. They can be as complicated as you want them to be or as simple and fun to watch.  They have the best compiltaion of history, philosophy, psicology, religion and mithology ever put in any movie.  At the same time you can watch it for the explotions, FX and the action.

The blu ray edition changes:
We all have our own opinion on these movies: how they should look, how they shoul be told, how the action ca be more fun, what they shoud`t change and what they shoud improve or change.  All the movies needs something or lacks something but the star wars movies are so loved for everybody that a lot of us are so pasioned about them and any little  or big change is very important and we forgett what were we looking at them at first. I hope some of us still have manage to have fun and find what are we looking for in these BD edition or the olders one.

The Blu-ray picture quality:
I have no words... they look a lot better than the DVD versions by far. i have no reference equipment but they look excellent to me.  It's like see them for the first time.  You can't believe how much detail were you missing.  I`m very happy.

The blu-ray audio quality:
I'm not an audiophile and i haven`t had the oportunity to listen them loud but they sound a lot better too.  I still have to install all my nine speakers to hear the difference. They sound they way I remember heard them at the movies.

Extras:
They are cool but it lacks some material of the DVD versions and they feel incomplete to me. I like the package and artwork it's much better than the DVD versions. The spanish subs are also better done this time, they told better the story and is more adecuate to the english dialogue.

Thanks for reading and sorry for my english",1316304000,13,1810,4.254385964912281
7220983,5,B00YI71PN2,"My 12-year-old son is a Star Wars fanatic (50+ books, multiple LEGO models, series of bobble head dolls, etc).  He knows the lore inside and out.  My wife remembers the films from High School and loves the story.  Our other two children are younger but still like the movies.  We own all 6 films on DVD and have been watching them on a 110"" screen, upscaled by a Playstation 3.  We read about the changes to the films and debated cancelling our order, but decided to wait and see.

The Blu Ray version of Episode 4 was an enjoyable experience for all of us.

Film clarity and detail far surpass even the upscaled DVD.  The space ships, the Death Star, even Darth Vader's mask look so much different in this version that my wife said, ""Wow.""  Warning for parents of young children:  you can definitely see the burned skeleton of Uncle Owen after the Storm Troopers finish with his home.  What was a vague outline of a human form before is now definitely a burned body, with some bone visible, but you will probably need a large screen to notice it.  The sound was excellent, including small background details in Mos Eisley and other scenes that really add to the atmosphere.

The changes to the film actually added to the entertainment value.  We all watched more intently to see if we could notice them, and my son the expert filled us in on the backstory associated with each change.  Obi Wan's dragon call imitation is different, but still caused my kids to chuckle...it is no more scary than before, just different.  The rocks in front of R2-D2 appear for a couple of seconds in one scene.  The family didn't care.

Overall, we were entertained by the new blu ray version.  We saw things we have never seen before.  We heard things more clearly than we have heard before.  We had a good time as a family looking for and discussing the changes.  We will watch it again.

And, for some final perspective on the changes, my 12-year-old son said this, ""Directors are always adding deleted scenes to or removing original scenes from a 'Director's Cut' version or an 'Extended Version'.  What's the difference with Star Wars?  We already know the story.""

Watch these movies for what they are, entertainment, and you will not be disappointed.",1316304000,26,2240,4.6075949367088604
7220984,4,B00YI71PN2,"After reading all the negativity on here i had to chime in about this box set. I have watched all 6 movies and I have to say the changes are not that big of deal and absolutely does not ruin the experience at all. The only thing that I thought was odd and out of place was the new Krayton call in Episode IV. Now picture quality Episode I, ok. Episode II, great. Episode III, outstanding. Episode IV, excellent. Episode V, great. Episode VI, great. Now soundwise, all across the board is nothing short of stunning. Special features were really neat, some stuff I definitely never seen before. Not even on Youtube. I really wouldn't be surprised if all the people on here saying they canceled their order and to boycott this set actually did buy it and just want to bitch about it. Because let's face it, most of them are diehard Star Wars nerds and they wouldn't care if George took a crap and put it into a tin box and put Star Wars bluray they would still buy it because it is Star Wars related. I really don't care if the original trilogy sees the light of day because to me it seemed old, outdated and doesn't fit.

So, in a nutshell I just want everyone not to be swayed by the reviews on here.  Watch it for yourself and then you can make your own decisions about it.  But I was personally blown away by it.excellent!",1316304000,4,1323,4.284

But shoud you also hold on to the past dvds, sadly, yes. The deleted scenes from the prequels that were in finished form on the 2 disc dvds are not on this set... Nor is the excellent Empire of Dreams documentary. That said the extras that are here are quite good. I can also confirm that the animated short from the Holiday Special with Boba Fett is indeed on this set as an easter egg. Lastly, the changes. Did they bother me, honestly , no. In 1997 and 2004, thought some of the changes I had heard about would bother me and they didn't. Will Lucas release the original cuts at some point, yeah I think he will.

7220986,5,B00YI71PN2,"Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.

I just finished watching Episode IV (A New Hope).  Although I haven't played any of the other discs, I dedided to go ahead and write a review, because some people may be wondering whether this is a good Blu-Ray purchase.  I think it is, so far.

I was quite pleased with the video quality.  It is excellent, except for a couple of scenes of sand and blue sky, which have some grain (I sit about seven feet away from a 52"" LCD).  Overall, the video quality is fantastic.  The aspect ratio is 2.35:1, and I am very happy for that.  The actual movie is just about 120 minutes.

The DTS-HD 6.1 Master Audio soundtrack is also excellent.  Why they made it 6.1 instead of 7.1, I don't know, but it probably doesn't make a whole lot of difference.

Luke's light saber is white, with blue edges.  Darth's light saber is white, with pink/red edges.  I have no complaints about the light sabers.  However, some of the explosions seem to be too orange (not like real fire).  Other than that, and the scenes that have grain, I saw no flaws.

My first impression of the packaging was ""Wow! This is a great way of packaging the set"".  I really loved it, until I tried to remove a disc.  The only way I could figure to take the disc out, was to pinch the side of the disc and pull.  You shouldn't have to touch the playing surface to remove a disc.

I debated starting with Episode One, but decided to start with Four because it is my favorite of the three original, and the main reason I bought this set was for the originals.  I originally ordered only the Original Trilogy, but changed my order to the Complete Saga, because I decided each Prequel movie was probably worth $10 to me, and the three bonus discs were probably worth another $10.  I have never seen Episodes Two and Three.  I have seen Episode One on DVD.  I didn't enjoy it that much, so never bought the other two.",1316304000,15,1965,4.347107438016529

7220988,5,B00YI71PN2,"I am 1100% with The Maker. And with all the changes he did. Now all six movies are perfectly unified into one solid story. The mirroring technique (the Prequel trilogy mirroring the Original) works perfectly in the storyline. (By the way, I saw all the originals in the movie theaters-I AM NOT A NEW FAN. I love the original trilogy, the Phantom Menace, AND  Jar Jar). For all the vitriolic people, you obviously don't get Star Wars. It is not a museum item. When G.L. imagined it, he did not imagine it grainy and vintage looking.  Star Wars is forever...Star Wars is forever....",1316304000,13,580,4.621359223300971
7220989,5,B00YI71PN2,"I just finished all six movies and a bunch (but not all) of the special features and I have to say I LOVE this set.  The PQ on all the movies is outstanding.  I think The Phantom Menace is the most noticeable upgrade (the DVD PQ was just awful for this one). I did notice some DNR, but overall the picture is very sharp and vivid.  Attack of the Clones was very good looking and I did NOT notice the supposed green tint everyone has been talking about.  Revenge of the Sith was perfect quality.  Episodes IV,V, and VI have never looked sharper or as colorful as they do now.  Being that they are old films, the PQ isn't as good as I-III, but that was to be expected.  The Audio on all the movies is fantastic.  I noticed subtle background noises I have never heard before. The sound mix really gives your system a workout.  The Changes made to this release turned out to not be so bad when watching the whole thing.  I understand why this bothers many people, but for me personally it didn't bother me.  The Special features I have watched so far were pretty interesting.  I think the collection of ""Spoofs"" could have been better, but still had many funny moments.  The Packaging for this set is alot nicer than I thought it was going to be when I first saw pictures of it online. The outside Box is very sturdy, as is the book and pages inside. The pages are designed to hold the discs securely and it is very easy to remove/replace the discs without scratching them.  The artwork through the set is very good, although it would have been nice to see the original poster artwork for each movie in the set, but no big loss. I highly recommend this Complete Saga release for Star Wars fans new and old, hardcore or casual, and for blu ray enthusiasts in general. I honestly believe this is the last release of Star Wars I will buy at least until the original unaltered trilogy gets released, which may or may not happen.  I know I am more than satisfied with this set.",1316304000,14,1968,4.32425068119891

7220992,1,B00YI71PN2,"Do you know what I think happened?

Lucas got drunk one night after he created the Special Editions, thought that he made a better product, and burned the originals. The next day he wakes up and sees the havoc he created, then convinces himself it is for the best. Years go by and his faith in his spontaneous decision begins to decline. He starts having nightmares about it... waking up in a sweat, unable to escape that one important decision that would alter his artistic integrity. He becomes an insomniac. His days are haunted by the ghost of the real Anakin. He desperately tries to cover it up with new material, trying to throw a veil over his all too intelligent fans, or maybe just create younger ones that have yet to understand what real art is. But he still sees a vast majority crying out for the masterpiece that was... people who grew up with the originals, and people like me who never got to see the originals in the theaters but who have watched the originals over and over countless times, thirsty to taste the movies with HD tongues.

But he cannot deliver it... because it's gone, its energy spread across the galaxy.

Or maybe he's just being stubborn.

Until we know the truth, I'm watching the 2008 DVD release and am not spending one dime on anything Star Wars until its true fans get what they deserve. We helped make you what you are Lucas.

It boot up much faster then my older player that's a couple years old, but still, it kind of sucked!  I do wish G.L. didn't go and screw the movies all up.  I don't mind cleaning it up, fixing the flaws and what not, but all the added stuff is just LAME.  To me, the BEST Star Wars is #5,  The Empire Strikes Back!  The one G.L. didn't have anything to do with, followed by the Original.  The Added stuff done to them was just wrong.  If only I had a VHS player.

7220997,1,B00YI71PN2,"Fact:  In 1977, a movie called ""Star Wars"" was released.  Not ""Episode IV - A New Hope"", but just plain old ""Star Wars"".  It was a brilliant homage to classic sci-fi and fantasy serials with a compelling narrative, lovable characters, and cutting edge special effects for the time.  Unfortunately, this movie has never been released to anamorphic DVD or Blu-Ray disc formats, and it's an oversight that's unforgivable on the part of George Lucas.

Enough with the changes.  Steven Spielberg said, ""For myself, I tried [changing a film] once and lived to regret it.  Not because of fan outrage, but because I was disappointed in myself. I got overly sensitive to [some of the reaction] to 'ET,' and I thought if technology evolved, [I might go in and change some things]. It was OK for a while, but I realized what I had done was I had robbed people who loved 'ET' of their memories of 'ET.'""  That hits the nail on the head.  Once a film is released, it belongs to us all, and it's wrong - actually, morally wrong - for George Lucas to continue to intentionally withhold ""Star Wars"" out of stubbornness to acknowledge the original films as the classic works of art that they are.  ""Star Wars"" was a groundbreaking, revolutionary film, and it deserves to be seen in HD format.

Release the originals, George.  Fully restored, 1080p.  We know you have them, and we know you have the technical know-how to do this.  If you can't bring yourself to do it, give it over to somebody else to restore.  In the meantime, I was 8 when I first saw ""Star Wars"" in 1977, and I grew up with your creations as well as Spielberg's.  Steven understands how to respect and sympathize with his fans, and you clearly do not.  Well, you have offended me for the last time, and the next Star Wars related purchase I make will not come until the originals - the REAL originals - are released.  Until then, I simply cannot recommend these bastardized versions of the classic movies.

(As for the prequels, they're some of the worst movies of the 2000s, and if they did not have the Star Wars name attached to them, they'd be forgotten by now.  Best avoided altogether.)",1316217600,23,2144,4.56282722513089
7220998,1,B00YI71PN2,"I was delighted to hear that Star Wars was coming out on Blu-Ray.  However, it turns out that you're not getting the original Star Wars.  You're getting 30 years of Lucas changing bits and pieces to the point where parts of the original films don't even resemble that of the theatrical release.  Not only that, there's no option to watch said films in their original format; even though the Blu-Ray discs hold the capacity to do so.

Bottom line:  There have been so many changes over the years to the original films, Lucas doesn't even know who shot first.",1316217600,23,557,4.585858585858586
7220999,1,B00YI71PN2,"There's only one thing magical about the Star Wars franchise - its ceaseless ability to make untold millions from twelve hours of mostly mediocre filmmaking. These movies will continue to be released in a never-ending, Orwellian-like milieu of 'super special editions' and 'ultimate collector's tin box sets' all gobbled up by legions of vapid fans who should have moved on decades ago to pursue something more cerebral, like collecting Beanie Babies.

To think a slightly ""sharper"" transfer or a few fleeting seconds of unseen celluloid that should have stayed on the cutting room floor repeatedly sells these tired films to the same lost souls wishing to relive an imagined childhood they likely never had is the true triumph of George Lucas's vision; a vision of insatiable greed fueled by the sophomoric whims of a generation of pudding heads.

The icing on this foul tasting crumb of Miss Havisham's cake, however, is the hilariously appropriate middle finger Mr. Lucas has shoved squarely up the posterior end of the lemmings who've been lining his pockets these last thirty years. His unwillingness to throw his throng of benefactors one stinking bone in the form of unaltered theatrical releases perfectly illustrates his utter disdain for those who gave him the ability to live as the narcissistic prince of his Neverland Ranch.

Of course there's little need to worry; once sales from this latest debacle begin to wane, you can bet the new 'double secret' set of the same movies will be headed to the local Walmart. In the words of that great religious icon of yore, Reverend Kenobi, ""who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him?""",1316217600,27,1657,4.996376811594203
7221000,2,B00YI71PN2,"I want to like this set I really, really do. I looked forward to it and had it on pre-order for months. I heard about the questionable changes but still kept my order. There is a lot of great extra content, but ultimately it is about the films. They all look very good, but not quite as amazing as they should have for being Star Wars. Part of the fault lies in the 7 year old transfers that were used for the classic films. HD mastering has come a long ways in that time, and new 4k or 8k scans should have been created. This is standard practice and I'm at a loss for why it was not done. Still, they look better than they ever have on home video. The sound on all six films is excellent across the board.

But the real letdown here are the additional changes to the films. Calling these films Star Wars is false advertising. They should be called Star Wars 2011, or Star Wars v. 4.0. These are not the films people grew up with. They aren't even the versions from the DVD. As many reviewers have noted, there are yet more ridiculous changes. And yet many of the mistakes from past releases are still not fixed.

By far the worst is Vader yelling ""noooooo"" at the end of Return of the Jedi. I watched the whole film and tried to see this in context. But it just flat out doesn't work on any level. It sounds comical and out of place. It truly takes you out of a great dramatic scene and ruins it. It's just heartbreaking and I can't begin to fathom why it was done or who could possibly have thought it was a good idea.

I won't go on about how Lucas is destroying his legacy and alienating the fans who made him what he is. Many other have done that. But I do want to say that the people upset about this are not haters. On the contrary, we are the people that love the films the most and it is painful to see them altered and destroyed by endless, needless tinkering. These are not the films that won awards and the hearts of billions of people around the world.

The most frustrating thing is that all of this would be a moot point if the original versions were included on the blu rays. All would be forgiven and everyone would be happy. I can only hope that some day Lucas comes to his senses. He has always been a vocal supporter of film preservation. I don't understand why he refuses to preserve his own films.

Star Wars is one of the greatest films of all time. Maybe I should say Star Wars was one of the greatest films of all time. I picked this up today and I am disgusted. There is absolutely no reason that the original theatrical version could not have been included. All you are allowed is George Lucas' perverted re imagining of a classic master piece. The original trilogy is littered with terrible CGI, awkward changes, and deep running character changes that destroy what made Star Wars so great. Han Solo is a bad ass smuggler who doesn't take crap from some scum named Greedo. He shoots him straight out. And Darth Vader doesn't scream like an awkward teenager at the sight of his son's near murder.

In short, do not buy this set. Buy the 2006 2 disc set and accept that Star Wars will never be presented as it was originally intended in HD.",1316217600,8,898,4.50920245398773

7221006,2,B00YI71PN2,"Let me start by saying that the prequels, look really good. And that's what this is a 2 star.

BUT the originals...are terribly done

First off, it's not true HD. In fact most of it looks standard. Secondly in A New Hope, during the escape from the death star, where Luke and Han are shooting the TIE fighters. The fighters have a little brown box around them on several frames, AND during one frame it actually goes back to FULL screen, from widescreen. Then while Luke is about to destroy the death star, one of the tie fighters there, actually is transparent somehow lol. Luke's lightsaber still changes color twice. AND Obi-Wan's does as well during the fight with Vader it turns purple several times.

 I'm actually really considering returning this. In fact I probably will.",1316217600,15,780,4.713235294117647
7221007,1,B00YI71PN2,It may sound like hyperbole but this release is a slap to the face for fans.  If it had been nothing more than a prettier version of the DVDs we would have been happy and ponied up the money.  But actually making them worse is unacceptable.,1316217600,16,240,4.195652173913044
7221008,5,B00YI71PN2,"Unlike nearly all of the 1-star ratings, I'm actually posting this (1) after the product was actually released, (2) after actually purchasing the product and (3) after WATCHING it.

Haters'll hate, it's too bad Amazon has done such a terrible job at eliminating reviews that were submitted prior to anyone possibly having or seeing the release in question.

I'd love to get the original versions too, I'm sure it'll happen someday.

BUT - if you love Star Wars you'll be thrilled with these nine discs.  They look WAY BETTER than anything ever released before.  I'm watching them at 65"" and they're BEAUTIFUL.

And this is a TON of Star Wars content - so not only is it by far the best quality ever available, it's a HUGE quantity.

Don't let the fanboy haters get you down - if you love Star Wars you'll be in heaven with this release.",1316217600,20,836,4.570469798657718
7221009,1,B00YI71PN2,"Lucas further debauches his original classics with filth. After hearing Lucas changed more, I was HOPING that he would have just changed the few things he did this time around on the theatrical versions, like starting from scratch. Obviously even that was too optimistic. These are just BluRay rereleases which have been further destroyed. Don't waste your time or money with these. Yea, the picture quality is amazing in all 6 films, but then again the first 3 films aren't worth watching anyway. Save your money, buy the Bonus Disc DVD version and watch the theatrical films as they were originally meant to be viewed.",1316217600,17,620,4.914285714285715
7221010,5,B00YI71PN2,"The films on blu-ray look great.  We get it.  These aren't the ""original"" versions.  They'll probably never be released.  George Lucas himself refused to give up an unaltered film print of the 1977 movie when it was elected by congress to be preserved forever in the National Film Registry.  He offered them a digital film print of the 1997 special edition, which they rightfully refused.  Go search for a torrent of the Harmy remastered versions online.  I am a massive Star Wars fan, yet I have an open mind.  Many people are upset that George Lucas ""tampers"" with his films.  While that's obviously true, here's a serious question that all the non-nitpickers are dying to have answered...  How do any of the changes that have been made, big or small, actually negatively affect the actual storyline of the 3 original movies?  I'm talking physical complete scene alterations.  There aren't any because none occur.  Okay, we see Jabba The Hutt early.  So what!!!  Greedo gets a shot in.  So what!!!  Darth Vader says NOOOOO!!!  Oh my, the world is coming to an end.  So what!!!",1316217600,3,1078,4.760869565217392
7221011,1,B00YI71PN2,"No good. Save your cash, yes the Blu-Ray looks amazing, but for real, Lucas totally jacked it up. Stick with your DVD copies, or better yet, your VHS tapes to seriously enjoy this cinematic masterpiece.",1316217600,17,202,4.8
7221012,1,B00YI71PN2,"This is the first Star Wars set I've decided I can't buy. With movies like Blade Runner and Apocalypse Now offer both versions (5 in Blade Runners case) to appease fans, it seems beyond ridiculous (in fact...quite literally SAD) that the original versions of these films can't be provided for this release. Providing ""Special Edition"" versions is interesting and maybe even kind of fun, but only if you can view the original unaltered version. I'll buy Star Wars on Blu-Ray whenever they actually release Star Wars on Blu-Ray.",1316217600,18,526,4.988636363636363

7221014,1,B00YI71PN2,"""Nooooooooo!"" Wow. There was nothing wrong with the original ending. It was dramatic and well done. Sure, making Vadar scream ""Noooooo"" ties it into Ep 3.

Noooooooo, thanks. I'll pass.",1316217600,16,369,5.166666666666667
7221015,5,B00YI71PN2,"For all those complaining about the blu-ray addition and how Lucas ruined it by adding stuff to the movies such as extended seens, Shut up and watch it.  Because it is obvious you haven't.  I got it as a Birthday gift and none of the seens were actually added to the movies, but appear on bonus discs. Since most that have complained were doing so hours after the release it makes it more obvious that you have no clue and beleive everything you read or hear from the media speculation.",1316217600,13,486,4.388888888888889
7221016,1,B00YI71PN2,"One of the definitions of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome than before.  DON'T buy this crap in the hope that Lucas will finally get some sense and put out the product people want.  So long as people keep shelling out money for new versions of Star Wars minus the original cuts, just so we can get the few new extras he cynically adds each time, he will continue to pull this moneygrabbing crap and withhold what everyone really wants.  Lucas: ""Come back to me baby.  I won't hurt you again!"" Right answer: ""No"".  Wrong answer: ""OK, baby.  I'm sure you'll be different this time because you WANT to change.""",1316217600,14,661,4.512605042016807
7221017,2,B00YI71PN2,"There's a lot to like about this set as a fan of these films (IV, V, VI especially), but why oh why won't you stop ""improving"" these films Mr. Lucas.  I know you have the right to do whatever you want but it really was more compelling to have Darth Vadar silent when he threw the emperor down the shaft.  As a fan of silent cinema, I thought you knew the meaning and power of silence.  You were obviously trying to tie ""Nooooooo"" to the ""Noooooo"" in episode III.  When I watched episode III in the movie theatre people laughed out loud at that scene.  Never a good sign.  It doesn't ruin the film for me completely as it seems it does for some but it certainly takes me out of the film and disconnect during such a key dramatic moment in the series.  The transfers are beautiful on bluray for sure and sound amazing.",1316217600,15,816,4.225806451612903
7221018,5,B00YI71PN2,Wow that is amazing how bad of reviews that this set is getting. Ok yeah george lucas made a little changes here and there and yes it does suck that he altered the originals. The question is am i against it? Not really because the simple fact that half of the movies that hollywood has came out with are remakes of an original movie to update the movie with today's technology to attract young viewers or viewers that has never even seen the original bc it lacked the attraction of the movie on the shelf. While star wars original 70's movies added a little cgi and darth vader saying nooo didn't really ruin the movie for me. I still enjoyed these movie for what they are even if they have been altered a little bit. I am a star wars fan and i love the unaltered versions as well as the improved versions and i know im gonna have a lot of people get mad and tell me that im not a true fan but hey i said i was a fan not a obsessive freak. to the people that are pissed off about this set u go ahead and boycott this release its not gonna change lucas mind bc even himself said that he hated the originals and it is his jurisdiction to change what he wants to change because he is the creator of this wonderful movie. Like i said they have alot of remakes of the old horror or comedy movies and i don't see anybody bashing them yet unless they are just plain horrible,1316217600,20,1367,4.104477611940299
7221019,5,B00YI71PN2,"Ok. I just want to say that I am writing this for my love of the movies. I know there has been a big debate over the (new versions) of these films. These were my favorite films as a kid growing up, and still are today. But I am torn as individual watching them. I agree with those who want there kids to see the original release of these films, because thats what they are original and they are the reason sci-fi and film history has been changed. But to note that (special edition) of these films released in 1997 were improving certain aspects of the films they were a different cut. Therefore this complete saga contains the prequel trilogy with modifications and the special edition trilogy with modifications. Just wanted to clarify for those who have had a mental debate over to buy it or not. Now for the pluses: A. its blu ray and hi def so picture and sound are great. B. 40+ hours of special features unseen. C. All 6 films together for the first time. So I have said what I have been feeling and I hope this helps at least one person to hear the truth rather than a bad review for someone who didn't buy it.",1316217600,13,1118,4.253521126760563
7221020,5,B00YI71PN2,"As the title says, How can you rate any item before even receiving it. That is absurd. That say that George Lucas has ruined ones childhood memories by making changes makes me laugh, as if any movie could do that. If anything, Its new Star Wars!!! some of the scenes were filmed years ago. George would have put many of them in years ago if he had the technology... Seriously people.... stop acting like whiners.

 As for the product.. It truly is amazing. The picture vibrant and the sound exuberent!! The new scenes look great and the deleted scenes are so much fun to watch. The only negative thing I might say is that some of the special features have all ready been released in the past , But thats ok. Its a nice definitive collection. BTW, the lightsabers look amazing! I didn't enjoy the adding of Nooooooooooo! by Vader as he throws the Emperor down the shaft, but it did not  "" ruin my childhood""! You will enjoy these!!!",1316217600,16,931,4.464705882352941
7221021,3,B00YI71PN2,"Lately, I've been taking the tact of renting any movies blu rays first before purchasing them for my collection.  More so for controversial product quality such as this package appears to profess.

UPDATE:  I watched Episode IV my feeling is image and enhancements such is brighter colors, sharper edges, animated models to what already exists is fine, but changing the sound effects, adding more stormtroopers, etc. is like colorizing a Black and White movie... call it like it is: STAR WARS enhanced or director's cut... lets cut out all those unnecessary changes that changes the storyline.

7221023,5,B00YI71PN2,"Sadly the majority of the reviews here are whining fanboys who yearn for things that few modern viewers are interested in. It is true this set features alterations from their original releases. I for one hope the theatrical versions eventually come out so that the internet won't be clogged with irate fans who often equate the Star Wars films enhancements with a physical or sexual assault. But then how would they fill their pathetic lives? I have seen all six at the theaters when they were originally released as well as their rereleases. I have owned every VHS, laserdisc and DVD copy and can honestly say the films look spectacular on blu. I am not crazy about the Han shooting at the same time as Greedo instead of first in the Catina scene but I'm not losing sleep over it. Most of the changes are positive from the original films. Special effects have been enhanced, the antiquated yoda puppet in episode one is now cgi, cities are filled with more activity and character, the sound mix for the older films has been updated and so on. I would like to see a theatrical version release one day, but honestly on repeat viewings I'm going to reach for the new special effects, additional footage and superior sound mixes over the historically important but technologically dated originals more times than not. The theatrical versions exsist on DVD so if you don't like the new ones you can pass on this new set but you will be missing some great special features, a plethora of rare deleted scenes, informative audio commentaries and some cool Easter eggs including the kickass Boba Fett animated short featured in the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special! These films are the way Lucas inteded and intends them to be seen and who are we to say he is wrong? My advice for the truly outraged is to perhaps become a genius, create some of the most iconic characters in modern film history and then do with the property what you see fit (or you could just chill out). To everyone else I encourage you to pick up this set and enjoy these fantastic films and explore the hours of entertaining  special features.",1316217600,22,2109,4.654155495978553
7221024,4,B00YI71PN2,"This is a review of the entire collection of Star Wars films in the Blu-Ray format. This release features even more changes and updates to the films than the previous 1997 Special Edition of the first trilogy contained. The prequel trilogy also received some changes, more so than their initial DVD releases.

I grew up with these films when they were initially released in the late 70's and early 80's, and I collected many of the toy figures and spaceships when they were available. I also went to see the ""Special Editions"" of the original trilogy on each of their premiere nights when they were released in theaters back in 1997.

On to the review of the Blu-Ray box-set itself.  The equipment I used to view the discs consisted of a Sony HDTV, a Sony 3D Blu-Ray player and a Sony Home Theater with 6.1 Surround Sound.

Following are my reviews of all the Star Wars films in this release.  This also includes updates/changes that I spotted while watching them.

Episode I looks much better than the 2001 DVD release of the film.  Colors look excellent, the scenery is much more vibrant and realistic and the DTS-HD 6.1 sound (particularly the music, laser battles and lightsaber duels) just explodes with furor across all the speakers in my home theater.  Even Jar-Jar and the rest of the Gungans looked much better than the previous 2001 DVD release.  Darth Maul also looks meaner and much more sinister.

Episode II features improvements on the scenery shown on Naboo and Tatooine and looks much better and brighter.  The sound is also much better and clearer than the previous 2002 DVD release.  Yoda also looked better and more realistic.  An edited change was also done during Anakin's nightmare.

Episode III looks amazing.  The scenery looks much better than the previous 2005 DVD release with sharper details.  The battles and lightsaber duels look and sound much better with sharper detail.  Mustafar in particular has a much improved look.

Episode IV looks incredible, especially considering its age at 35 years old.  New details are now much more visible, from updates on the appearance of the Death Star to the ship chase in the film's opening.  Darth Vader's costume looks much better and the very familiar breathing sound is much clearer plus the updated scenery look a lot better and is much more defined.

Speaking of sound, the multiple crunches of the soldier's neck when he's being strangled by Darth Vader now sound so much more realistic with the crunches of bone being much improved.  All in all, a great update of a great film.

Episode V now looks better than ever.  Some much needed touch-ups to many of the scenes in Cloud City have been done and they all look much better now.  As was the case with Episode IV, the spaceships have a much more life-like appearance now.  Also, Hoth has a much better appearance and the ground battle has been improved with more snowspeeders headed for eventual impacts on the ground when shot.

The same can be said for Dagobah with the planet and scenery receiving a much-needed improvement.  It all looks much more realistic now.

As was the case with Episode IV, I think this was a great update of a great film.  The updates and restoration were badly needed and came out looking and sounding very sharp.

Episode VI also looks better.  The spaceships were again touched up and look much more realistic now.  The scenery has also been improved upon as well as the lasers and lightsabers with both looking much better than I have ever seen.

Other changes that were noteworthy were the eyes on the Ewoks blinking and the much-discussed ""Noooo"" that Darth Vader says while Luke is being electrocuted by Emperor Palpatine. I liked both changes, especially the eye-blinking on the Ewoks.  However, I noticed that some areas were missed where I thought a blink was warranted.  Perhaps they'll fix those spots in a future release of the film.

Again, this was a great restoration of this film that's closing in on being nearly 30 years old.  The changes and improvements made it much better.

Three bonus discs are included with this boxset.  They include deleted scenes, interviews and behind-the-scenes documentaries, some of which date back to 1977.  All were interesting to watch.

So why am I deducting one star?  The problems I have with this set are the lack of artwork on the discs and the way the discs are held in the binders themselves.

I would have liked to have the discs featuring some artwork on them as was the case with the previous DVD releases of the films.  In this set, the discs are plain with no artwork on them.

It's also worth noting that the way the discs are held make it very difficult for someone with arthritis in their hands to get the discs out of the package for viewing.  I would have liked to have them on trays or perhaps in individual Blu-Ray cases in a cardboard box much like how the 2004 DVD release of the original trilogy was packaged.

In spite of the physical problems I have with retrieving the Blu-Ray discs out of the box-set, I have no hesitation in recommending it as a marvelous upgrade from the previous DVD releases of the Star Wars films.  I personally prefer the updated versions of all the films, be it the prequel trilogy or the original trilogy that I grew up with. To me, these updates are vastly more entertaining than the original versions of the film and give a much better glimpse of the fascinating Star Wars universe that I have enjoyed since first seeing Star Wars in the movie theater back in 1977.",1316217600,4,5527,4.689511941848391

From what I have read and clips I have watched, Greedo still shoots first, terrible looking cgi aliens are jammed in or replace classic characters, boba fett has a different voice, vader looks like episode III anakin without a helmet and as a ghost...  Before you do something silly and buy this set, please check out Obi-Wan's new krayt dragon call and Vader's new line of ""No... NOOOOOOOOOOO"" at the climax of episode VI... Think long and hard about whether George Lucas deserves any of your money.

7221026,4,B00YI71PN2,"I will start by telling anyone looking to these reviews as a decision maker to buy or not buy this set needs, at this point, to read them from 'Newest First'.  You will note that 90% or better of the reviews written since we have had this product ACTUALLY in hand are 4 or 5 star reviews and for Very Good reason.  The HD upgrades these movies have gotten (especially IV, V, VI) are INCREDIBLE.  It is like watching the film for the first time or better.  The resolution has not only been enhanced but the colors and sound bring the films to life like never before in home viewing.  All the people who have been complaining based mostly on the ""Noooooooo"" in ROTJ are missing out on seeing their favorite movie in stunning HD.  I give this set 4 stars only because as an ""ultimate"" set(which to be fair, it is not billed as such) I wish they would have included more the the past ""making of"" docs and the original theatrical versions cleaned up for blu-ray also.  I also thought the parody feature is lacking some of the best and early parodies like ""Hardware Wars"" and others I have seen over the years, but it is still very funny.  While I agree changing some of the dialog (like the ""Noooooo) and changing the Obi-Wan's dragon call at the sand people are not 'improvements' I think that a lot of the effect changes are cool and certainly don't effect the movie watching experience.  I will never forget the originals but I am so happy I did not let it stop me from buying this Awesome set, and you should not let it stop you either!",1316217600,14,1535,4.339160839160839

The quality is extraordinary and makes you feel like your on the set watching the movie.  You can see every little detail of the jets coming out of the millennium falcon, instead of a blob of blurry blue you see multiple jets at work with colors ranging from white to a tipped blue flame.  defiantly worth 80$ for 6 movies and 3 bonus discs. its a must have for any starwars fan.",1316217600,25,1102,4.430693069306931
7221032,1,B00YI71PN2,Lucas shot second and continues to kill the series. Proves that old saying that the first idea is the best idea and you should leave it alone!!!!!!!!,1316217600,5,149,4.555555555555555
7221033,1,B00YI71PN2,"The original three Star Wars movies are easily some of the best movies ever made. George Lucas has changed that with his incessant, pointless editing. Instead of Han starting out as a cut-throat, which he was, Lucas tries to paint a prettier picture by having him shoot second. Then the ridiculous scene with the CGI Jabba, which stands out worse than anything, continues the downhill slide. The original trilogy is now full of edited scenes, CGI bits that look awful, and changes that make no sense. George Lucas should know that while people love Star Wars, they love the original Star Wars. There's a reason that he made the prequels, because the originals (which you can only buy on DVD in one release (2008) which is twice the price of the whole 6 Blu-Ray movies) were awesome.
Just like Darth Vader now says ""NOOOO"" to the Emperor, everyone needs to say no to George Lucas and not buy this ""Star Wars"" release.",1316217600,16,916,4.660493827160494
7221034,4,B00YI71PN2,"People continue to complain about the changes Lucas has made to the movies without actually looking at the benefits of this set. As far as the changes go, save for the new dialogue for Vader at the end of Return of the Jedi, most of them are cosmetic at best and bear very little on the narratives presented in the films. Since most of the changes from the '97 special editions have stuck, the changes to the films since then have been marginal at best.

The facts at hand are that this is Star Wars in high definition. There are a lot of new features to peruse on the complete set, and this is the best that the original films have ever looked. New deleted scenes, documentaries, and an attractive addition to your shelf should be what determines your decision to buy this set or pass. If you haven't yet made the jump to HD, you probably don't need to worry about it too much unless you're a big hound for new material related to the films. If you have a Blu-ray player and are sick of watching the films upscaled from your old DVD's, this is a set worth owning.

I just hope that you base your decision not on stereotypical fanboy bitterness that treat these films as if they're the bastardized word of God, but treat them as films you enjoyed. That should be the determining factor in any film purchase.

I enjoyed every minuet of what I have seen so far and am very glad that George Lucas has considered the viewers experience so carefully. All I can say is, if you don't like this.. all I can say is ""you need to go home and rethink your life .. "" lol.",1316217600,15,389,3.7560975609756095
7221036,5,B00YI71PN2,"I'll keep this pretty short. I got my set yesterday and let me just say this is one of the BEST packaged boxed sets ever. It's simple, yet stunning at the same time. Each episode comes in a flip case, housed in a cardboard cutout on one side, with boxart from that particular episode in the background.

I watched Episodes 1 & 2 yesterday and the picture quality is absolutely jaw-dropping. It's extremely crisp and clear. Love it.

The audio sounds good too, and honestly the William's score sounds great in surround on a low-end system (can't imagine what this sounds like for those of you with more expensive sets). I heard notes and lines that I'd never heard before, and I'm not talking about, ""Noooooo.""

I can't wait until my next day off to watch some more episodes, but so far this is total win and totally worth the price of admission.

I'll edit my review after I watch more.

Edit #1 - I got a chance to watch Episode 3, and just wow. Video quality was phenomenal!!!! I can't say that enough! I started playing it right after I sat down with some pizza, and right after the scrolling pre-synopsis was done I had to stop eating because my jaw was wide open! This held true through the whole movie.

PS. I am a huge Star Wars fan!! And yes, I'm disappointed that they aren't the exact theatrical cuts (first release), but I am ok with that.",1316217600,36,1350,4.401606425702811

7221038,5,B00YI71PN2,"Sorry, haters, but I'm loving this puchase.  I picked up this set yesterday and am thoroughly happy with my decision.  The sound and video are absolutely amazing.  To say that you have the DVD version and that's good enough is just your way of rationalizing your non-purchase.  These transfers look better than the theaters.  Seeing and hearing these blu-ray versions, I felt like I was seeing more detail than ever before.  You really get to see all the extreme detail that the model-makers and CGI artists put into their craft.

Should Lucas have added the ""Noooo"" to Jedi?  No.  Should he have made Greedo shoot first?  Absolutely not.  Should he have added CGI to the original movies?  Sure!  I like how it makes the movies come alive even more.

I'm not blind or dumb.  While I don't agree with everything Lucas has done, I realize that those 3 minutes of changes in no way affect my overall enjoyment of a 14 hour cinematic adventure.  I love Star Wars.  And now, I have all 6 of the movies in the most superb video and audio available today.  You should buy it, too.",1316217600,17,1073,4.528795811518324

7221041,5,B00YI71PN2,"There have bene many haters and people complaining about the star wars blu ray release, many of these people rating a product 1star before ever seeing the actual product themselves, relying instead on what they hear and fan ranting. Yesterday I got my blu ray set and began to explore what it has to offer. The first film I watched was Empire Strikes Back which looks amazing in 1080p. The Colors are crisp, the sound blaring through the 6.1 surround sound and its star wars as one would see it on the big screen, the theater experience brought to your living room.

Also I explored the bonus features which as many people know, focus on deleted scenes. The prequel scenes are mostly unfinished or animatronic scenes but honestly I can say I loved them. None of them are double dips from the DVDs and you can see what was in the mind of the team before the final product. Many are too violent (such as Obi Wan killing Grievious by ripping out his heart and then blasting it) for the actual film but are great to watch. The OT scenes though are what we all want right? And these scenes are just as legendary as one would hope. Growing up a fan of the Radio Dramas, I knew about these scenes and finally seeing them myself, the star wars fan inside me was giddy with excitement, they are worth the money I paid alone. Also you get the boba fett animated short from the Star Wars Holiday Special - the first time anyone saw the famed Bounty Hunter.

I have not watched the entire set but the changes thus far are perfectly fine in fact gorgeous. Most of the changes seem to be in Episode 1 where the Podrace is extended, Yoda is now Digital to match the rest of the PT and several rendering/CGI errors have been fixed. Overall I can say this, thank you for giving me Star Wars in 1080p Lucasfilm. Thank you for giving us the deleted scenes we've heard about for years. And THANK YOU FOR THE SAGA ON BLU RAY WITH ALL SORTS OF NEW STUFF FOR THIS STAR WARS FAN TO ENJOY!",1316217600,17,1964,4.3197831978319785

I'm a Hollywood colorist and after watching A Phantom Menace, all I can say is Yetch!. It's painfully obvious this movie wasn't re-color timed for the Blu Ray release. So many of the scenes had a very disturbing magenta hue in the blacks and were otherwise so off that I found the movie almost unwatchable. In one cut the colors were great and then the next scene people's skin and hair color was suddenly different.
I'm going to have to find a previous version of this movie to see if the same issues are there also.
I'll watch episode 2 tonight and see if that's as bad. If so I'll see if I can return it and if not probably throw it away.",1316217600,15,743,4.2027972027972025

Now I grew up in the 90's and only saw the originals on recorded VHS off paper-view and remember it quite well. But the new Cgi and added dialogue I saw at the re-releases in the theaters wasn't a game-breaker for me. Don't take my word for it.

The older episodes are still clearly old with significant film grain to be seen (as would be expected) but the HD conversion brings new life to the films.  I think they did a very good job of balancing the use of new special effects with preserving the original look and feel of the work.

I know a lot of people are unhappy about some of the editing choices based on what I read here but for me this is an amazing update to a childhood classic.  And, a good value at less than $15 per episode not including the bonus material.",1316217600,14,664,4.1640625

I wasn't really offended by any of the new tweaks added to the series - I actually enjoy some of the changes (like the yet again reworked Greedo scene - this scene moreso than any other seems like an ongoing dialog between fans and Lucas - he doesn't want to give it up, but always tried to compromise and improve it).

You can join the haters and those calling for boycotts (I imagine most of them are secretly purchasing it anyway)or you can enjoy yourself. Enjoying a tweaked Star Wars is like any guilty pleasure - you savor every moment and then complain to your friends that you hated it.

7221057,4,B00YI71PN2,"The astonishing thing is not that so many read certain reviews here (such as that of N. Lucius) but that so many responded positively to such blatant ignorance.

For someone to complain so vociferously about changes,  and then to ignorantly complain that other scenes were 'changed' (i.e., Luke's light saber training session on the Millenium Falcon) when they were in FACT exactly as presented in the original theatrical release from 1977 is ironic and humorous in the extreme - in spite of a handful of changes, these films are presented almost entirely as originally released, and in a quality approaching that of the film formats  (which, kiddies, is superior to the cute little HDTV setups so many of you are now used to) of the past.

These are beautiful transfers, from picture to audio quality, and are simply the best these films have looked in a home viewing situation. Yes, Lucas has made some minor changes here and there (and it is his right - he owns these works, regardless of what some minority of extreme fans may believe), but it really makes little difference in the impact of these works.  Goofy? Yes. Naive? Undoubtedly, but such things are the charm of films inspired by space opera and Saturday serials. Regardless of source material and inspiration, these films forever changed the landscape of cinema worldwide, and presentations for home viewing remind us why.

Don't listen to the envious, ignorant haters out there - the old flaws are there, the mistaken changes are present, and the films continue to shine as an example of world-building in cinema and as grand entertainment.",1316217600,8,1605,4.925925925925926

These are relevent only to the perfectionist. It doesn't matter if all the ""I's"" are not dotted or all the ""J's"" are not hooked up the the left. This is not LOTRs where 30 - 50 minutes are not included - these are minor issues.

7221063,3,B00YI71PN2,"I had to write something now, but I will update it after I saw them all.

I got it today and I was going to hold off because of the changes. I had a gift card so I did not pay full price. I like the Special Editions so I did not really HAVE to have the originals, although he should have put them in this package just because those were the theatrical releases. The SE's were good minus the Bob Fett in ANH and the Jedi changes. I understand that he had to update SW because they started to look dated, particularly after Terminator 2 came out! For the longest time they were the state of the art in film.

He also updated them because he knew that he was coming with new films, wanted to increase box office rankings for his films AND he used those SE box office receipts to help fund the prequels, just as the 3D version might finally fund the sequels! Updating the films to keep them cutting edge was OK because once they started looking old, they would be viewed as old films which they are, but old like Planet of the Apes or Omega Man old! I am all for update to special effects, but JUST NOT THE STORY and characters! Han shooting first is changing the movie. Vader saying ""noooo"" is changing the character to fit after the fact film prequels. That stupid musical in Jedi should be cut as well as anything not needed. It was almost as if he was able to change things and then purposely tried hard to think about what else he could change. Less is more which is why ANH worked so well! They had less money, so they worked more on things that did not require as much money, such as ACTING and STORY. He should stop trying to make the originals fit the prequels when he should have made the prequels better fit the originals!

Now the review: I'll start with the first disc that I popped in - the deleted scenes. The discs take a while to load and I have a high-end Sony player. The discs do have resume which is great! This disc was in some forme of HD formatting, but I can tell that some scenes were taken from a video tape source and the film sprockets had to be fake. I know that that footage cannot be as good as it gets for Star Wars cutting room floor! I think that the scenes were presented in such a way as to avoid anyone from putting together a definitive version of the films!

ANH: These scenes were basically all of the ones that you may have seen on websites but complete with sound and clearer of course. They claim that these were unfinished with the assumption that that is as good as they can get. Some are even in black and white. Hand Solo had a girl, but they cut her out. They could have left that in as it would not have made much of a difference. 99% of these cuts I agree with. You would think that you would like to see the whole scenes film within the movie, but those scenes did nothing more than distract from the main film. It also introduced other characters (Luke's friends) that Lucas would have to explain or keep track of later. These scenes also look less ""Star Warsy"" and more terrestrial. Luke had a Kangol and his buddies looked and acted like earthlings. Good cuts, but I would not mind seeing the scenes added with seamless branching!

Empire: This film's deleted scenes were scenes that could be useful to the film, but not really needed. I like the Wampa scenes where the creatures were in the rebel base and even appeared to have an encounter with Darth Vader and his troopers. That added to the fact that they were both on a system that they both did not fully know. They said it was cut due to the Wampa not looking real. I agree, buuut, Lucas COULD have CGI'd a Wampa! I recalled reading about these scenes in an Empire novel/comic book that came out during the release.

There was also a scene right after Luke fought Vader and landed in the Falcon. He and Leia had an extended discussion and Boba Fett was brought up. This should have been kept as we have seen Boba Fett on film and we know he is a bounty hunter. It added more meat to the plot and the upcoming ""Jedi."" There was also a scene with Lobot getting captured by Storm troopers. It should have been kept. I do not know why they took that out as it was a small, non-distracting scene which explained his fate. I always assume that he took control of the city after Lando left. There were more, but they were mainly extended dialog. Not much was left out of this film as it was close to perfect!

Jedi: THIS film is known for being the worst of the originals. The deleted scenes on this film SHOULD have been added to the actual film! It would have GREATLY filled in plot holes and transitioned certain scenes better. If the deleted scenes were added back, Jedi could easily stand next to ANH and Empire! The main scenes, which I always wondered about all of these years, was where did the gang go right after the sail barge scene? They actually met up in a sand storm and talked about what happened and where they were going. Makes sense to leave that in there!

There was another where Darth talks to Luke with the force and asks him to ""come to him."" Luke is seen building a new light saber! I always asked: ""where did he get the new green saber from since they do not sell them and he lost his other one?"" Darth later in the films also says:""...I see that you have CONSTRUCTED a new light saber."" Would have been nice to put that little scene in the film, it could have made the movie MUCH better! Who decided to cut these is a fool! They SHOULD cut the musical number instead of adding MORE!

There was also a scene with a commander (?) Jejerrod at the Emperor's chambers. He tells Darth Vader that he cannot come in and Vader begins to choke him. He then says that it is on orders of the Emperor and Vader releases him! Also, the red Emperor's Royal Guards are in the back ready for action! This was the only time we could see them doing something other than standing there! They REALLY should have kept this as well! These deleted scenes could have made Return of the Jedi a very great film is they had left the scenes there and it would not have seemed handicapped by plot holes and Ewoks! I would LOOOOOVE to see this ""special edition"" with seamless branching! Now THESE are the originals that I want!

Menace: I did not finish this yet, but I did watch and hour and skimmed through to see the digital Yoda. I like the digital Yoda as the puppet seemed scary and looked older than the Empire Yoda. The picture quality is the worst of the series (I did not see another as of yet, but I know from experience) and it originally had a lot of grain. I do not know if the grain and look was to simulate the old days in Star Wars time, but that was the way it was. He cleaned it up - a little too much! Yeah, take some grain out, but not to the point where you lose detail. He tried to make these looked like the last to prequels. He should have known that the last two would look newer than all because they were digital. They should have looked older since they were prequels. I like the grain in Phantom.

I did not finish because I fell asleep! It is still hard to get over Jar-Jar and the picture quality overall looks no better than an upconverted DVD, no lie! There are times when you can easily tell that they are in front of a blue screen and not on location as certain background have no depth to them. I also notice some things that I did not like about this film - Jedis moving fast! When they are burning a hole through the door, they encounter shielded robots and then they both turned into the Flash and dash! Not needed. When they are going into the water where Jar-Jar lives, they are moving then they disappear! I also never liked their Batman styled. Confronted with water? They just happen to have breathing apparatus with them!

When I am done, I will give more. I just give the four stars until then.
UPDATE: 9/19/11

I just finished watching the prequels.  The Phantom Menace seemed to be faster paced this time.  In case people do not get what they are about, they are about the Emperor MAKING Anakin and having him infiltrate and take down the Jedi from within while he handles the political side of things.

Professional reviews rave about the prequel picture quality, but I think that they were paid off!  Truthfully, the picture quality is no better than an upconverted DVD on a GREAT Blu-ray player.  The digital film was a bad idea and I think that the only reason he went with it was to better match the CGI with the digital action.  He should have stuck with analog film as it is virtually limitless for the future.

The sound is not as great as they say either (JBL mid-level speakers, 5.1 no sub, Onkyo 2nd from the top of the line receiver and high quality synergistic speaker wire!).  It is good, but not deserving of a 5!  Most reviews gave the sound a 5 while the picture got a 4!  The picture on the prequels deserve more in the range of a 3 - and I am being generous.  It is not bad, but I did not feel the jump to Blu-Ray (60"" 1080P, 10-bit panel, semi-professionally calibrated) was there.  I did manage to see threading in clothes, but nothing popped off the screen like film titles do.  I suspect that the originals will look a lot better.  So far, I only like the deleted scenes disc!  I usually could care less (but still care about) deleted scenes discs, but this one was special.  I will update on the sequels...",1316131200,10,9376,4.263513513513513
7221064,5,B00YI71PN2,"After reading the reviews prior to the release of this set I was hesitant of buying it. However I have seen the dvd's this set is replacing and did not think the changes were enough to have me wait until some 'unknown' time for theatrical versions to be released. Also I read reviews at blu-ray.com on the picture and sound quality being great. So I bought the set at target with bonus lithographs this morning. After watching the first one and the last I now understand that with the added special effects the old movies now blend better with the newer ones. This is what Lucas had intended. I enjoyed them very much.
 The blu-rays are a dramatic improvement over the dvd as it should be. The light sabers are much better than the original theatrical versions IMHO. I actually sense their power now. Everything looks crisp and the sound is amazing.
I am glad I purchased this set and with the added bonus features are just that a great bonus. When and if the original theatrical versions come out(for the original 3) I will buy just those 3 and see them as an 'addition' to the set I have now.

Ill take the original 3 movies on vhs with mono sound rather than watch this crap. I will not be buying anything star wars related. People just you wait, the original theatrical release on blu ray, the 1997 versions on blu ray, the 2004 release on blue ray, all of them will just put more money in George Lucas's pocket.

7221070,1,B00YI71PN2,"Let's start off with the most important problem first, the packaging. Fox has adopted this stance that their best movie collections must be treated like crap and pulled out of cardboard cases. I can only assume that this is to force you to buy new copies when you scratch the hell out of your discs. This problem seems to only be in the US version, I cannot fathom what would make them want to do this.
  George, I get it, you're an artist, and your works are never completed, but part of being an artist is knowing when to stop. Please bring out the original theatrical cuts of the films in high definition, from the original master prints of the movies, that's what most of us really want to see. I'd buy them day one I can promise you that. Too much has been changed from the original trilogy, and even though you're still tinkering with the IV-VI you've started messing with the prequels as well. Some of the fixes I can understand such as the Wampa arm issue, the interior shots of the rebel ships fighting the walkers on Hoth.
  Honestly though, does anyone care if the ewoks eyes blink? Does it matter that R2 is a little bit more hidden behind those CGI rocks? That you finally covered up the Vaseline that you originally put on the camera to cover up the wheels on the landspeeder? No, not really. I'm not even going into the pink lightsaber that never got fixed, the green lightsaber in A New Hope that got fixed for a few frames then goes right back from blue to green, or the yelling that was added in Jedi.
  At some point you have to realize, these movies are no longer yours, they are your fan's. They belong to us.

INITIAL POST:

Immediately upon opening the set I removed a star. The all cardboard case is a joke, and all but ensures I won't watch these that often, for fear of destroying the discs. You have to slide the discs against the cardboard to get them out, there is no way around this. I know Blu-rays have a protective coating, but still cosmetically they still scratch. I will say this though the cardboard is high quality, I just hate this kind of packaging! (See The Simpsons Seasons 11-13/20 for reviews on this type of packaging) Stay tuned for more updates. I am off to watch Phantom Menace now.

EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE

The Phantom Menace Blu-ray is extremely well done, the picture is the best I've seen on any Blu-ray In my collection. I hope this picture quality is reflected throughout the saga. The sound was also excellent, even on my elderly 5.1 system. The A/V earns my over all rating a star back. Yay! We are back to five stars.

The new CGI Yoda is a vast improvement over the horrible puppet they used originally. That being said, I did observe that the clarity of the picture tends to make the CGI more noticeable, especially in scenes with CGI & live action. Not a complaint so much as just an observation, as I realize CGI was still in it's juvenile phase in 1999.

Over all The Phantom Menace Blu-ray gets an A+! On to Attack of the Clones! (My personal favorite of the prequels, just because we get to see Yoda break bad!)

EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES

Attack of the Clones doesn't benefit from Blu-ray treatment like The Phantom Menace does. I blame this on early HD digital cameras that were used to film it. Most everything is less focused than TPM, and I noticed quite a bit of pixels in darker scenes and shadows. Based on the fact that the cameras were inferior, I'd say this is the best AotC will ever be. It gains no extra stars, but it doesn't lose any ether, for my overall score of the saga.

EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH

Revenge of the Sith suffers from the same thing that Attack of the Clones does. It was filmed with digital cameras instead of actual film, and it shows. There is a great deal of pixelation, mostly in the backgrounds, but there is some noticeable pixels in much of the foreground also. Don't get me wrong it looks good, but nowhere near the clarity of The Phantom Menace. Based on the fact that AotC & RotS both suffer this way I have removed a star from my overall rating of the saga. Sad that Mr. Lucas didn't have the foresight to realize that digital cameras were/are far from perfect. On to A New Hope...

EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE

A New Hope. The first Star Wars movie ever. The picture is impressive for a 34 year old film. There is a bit of noise in the picture, but it's more than acceptable.

Han & Greedo pretty much shoot at the same time now, and the scene looks more natural. The added in rocks in front of R2D2 are well done. I probably wouldn't have even notice if I wasn't looking for them. As for Obi-wan's Krayt Dragon call, it is very noticeable, and pretty goofy (I actually burst out laughing). All in all these new additions don't do anything to really harm the movie, but they don't do anything to help it ether.

My one real complaint comes from the Lightsaber effects... How is it that Mr. Lucas feels the need to adjust things that were okay to begin with, but the Lightsaber effects in this movie keep getting neglected? All through my childhood I hated the way the Lightsaber effects looked in this movie, particularly when being powered on/off. There are severe frame jumps and inconsistencies, that with modern technology should be an easy fix. Why does this keep getting overlooked? Also, I was under the impression that the Lightsaber colors were going to be repaired in this set. Well Luke's saber color is still way off particularly in the remote scene on the Millennium Falcon. This is supposed to be the same Lightsaber Anakin had at the end of Revenge of the Sith, it is supposed to be bright blue. In the remote scene it is a washed out aqua color that at times is mostly white. How is this acceptable? I see amateur YouTube fan videos all the time with better Lightsaber effect than this. The fail on the Lightsaber effects makes me remove another star for my overall rating of the saga. On to the Empire Strikes Back. Shouldn't be anything to disappoint there. *knocks on wood*

EPISODE V: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK

The Empire Strikes Back looks pretty good, again there is a bit of noise, but it is to be expected with a 30 year old movie. I will say this however, many of the space effects had a quite obvious square around them where they were edited in. I don't know if it was because my TV settings are too bright or what, but it was quite distracting at times.

The Lightsabers, while not as bad as ANH are still a little off as far as color, Vader's saber is more hot pink than the red it should be. Also something I noticed that I hadn't before, is when Luke is climbing out of the Wampa's cave, you hear the sound effect for the Lightsaber turning off, but it clearly doesn't. Seems like a really easy fix would be to just remove the sound effect. I'll let it slide because I missed it for 30 years so I guess it's easy to miss. All in all TESB doesn't lose any stars but it doesn't earn any ether. On to Return of the Jedi... May the Force be with it...

EPISODE VI: RETURN OF THE JEDI

Return of the Jedi suffers from the same squares around the ships/Death Star that I noticed in TESB. Again it could be that my TV settings are too bright, but it's where I like it for video games and I don't feel like readjusting from movie to game every time. Odd that they are so obvious with just a brightness adjustment, though.

As for effects the Lightsabers look decent enough, for a brief moment durring the final duel Vader's saber is almost a purple color, but overall the Lightsabers look good. Jabba's Palace door is bigger but you wouldn't really notice if you didn't know to look for it. The added in Dug is negligible and is on screen for maybe a whole second. The Ewoks blink, and I'm pretty sure the whole eye has been updated for Wicket. Now for the ""NOOOOOOO"" well I came into it expecting the worst, but all in all it's nowhere near as bad as everyone has made it out to be. It was unnecessary, but doesn't destroy the scene. I think the Obi-wan Krayt Dragon call was way worse. So final verdict on the saga, 3 stars, average... On to the special features discs, which are really the selling point with this set anyway. I have high hopes.

UPDATE TO SAGA REVIEWS: ATTACK OF THE SQUARES

I originally chalked up me being able to see the editing squares to me having my brightness up to high. Well I posted a discussion about it and come to find out I'm not the only one seeing them. Seems to me like more time should have gone into making sure things like this were fixed for the Blu-ray HD release of these films, instead of adding unnecessary rocks, howls, Dugs, eyelids, and NOOOOs! Since I am not the only person to see these squares, and they stuck out like a sore thumb to me, I am removing a star for both Empire & Jedi. Overlooking this, after all the ""improvements"" that have been made over the years, is a slap in the face. I hate to be the one to say this, but if he truly wants both trilogies to match up, ALL of the space scenes in the original trilogy need to be redone. They look awful compared to the prequels.

THE BONUS DISCS:

The bonus discs are jammed packed with tons on material. Enough to earn the set 2 stars. Nearly all on the deleted scenes I would love to see finished and placed back into the saga (aside from anything that would destroy continuity, or promote insest! lol!) The discs are overflowing with stills of models, costumes, paintings, etc. all in very high resolution. The documentaries are informative, and entertaining. While the spoof special was a hoot!

FINAL VERDICT:

The set gets a 3 star rating from me, due to the fact that I think the original trilogy could have been cleaned up a great deal more for this HD presentation. All in all for what you get, the current price of $80 (although I've heard the price is going up in the next couple of weeks), is well worth it. Hopefully the OT will get the real HD clean up it deserves for the 3D versions beginning in 2012. I shall wait & see...",1316131200,3,8455,4.359186268277178

7221076,5,B00YI71PN2,"I have just watched the first hour of New Hope and Phantom Menance as a representation of the newer movies and older ones. They are both breathtakingly good in this set, exceeding every expectation I had. New Hope has a clarity, crispness, and detail that has to be seen to believe. Almost every second reveals never before depth and details.

Phantom so far is breathtakingly colorful, rich, lush, and detailed. The sound is also amazing. I haven't had a problem with scrathing from the packaging. And the packaging is superbly artistcally done. Each disc has its own sleeve and a fine painting from a classic scene/ or characters from each movie. I haven't had time to enjoy the extras but there are a lot. Finally from a value standpoint. At the time of release the price comes to $13.33 per movie. An unbelivable deal for what you are getting.

In the end for all the haters what I feel most toward them is pity. I wonder how many of the one star pre-release reviews, not basing those review on the actual product in hand of course, are actually not going to get the set. Talk about spiting in your own face. And their reaction to me is the very definition of not seeing the forest for the trees. So Lucas makes a few changes. Totally what? 0.005% of the overall movie scenes? And for that all the venome and hate? Especially when Lucas could have charged A LOT more for this and done a vastly inferior job. My sincere thanks George. While I might not agree with everything he does, and I certainly was not enthralled with everything about the first three movies, these Blu-Rays deliver everything you could hope for from a Blu-ray

This Blu-ray set takes home movie watching to a new level. And I have the LOTR Blu-rays as well. If someone reading this is a 'fan' and also a 'hater' can take a deep breath, read the reviews of people who have seen these and then decide what you want to do. Hold on to the hate and stew? Or release the hate and treat yourself to the most amazing Star Wars experience you can have to date. If you are a Star Wars fans and you want to enjoy the 6 movies warts and all from a story telling perspective (not Blu ray quality perspective), then you deserve to treat yourself to this set. Do not let anger lead to hate. Especially as that anger is misplaced. George gave a lot to fans this time, one hell of a lot. Do not let the haters steer you to the Dark Side. Their anger is misplaced and they are only hurting themselves. Pass on this if you wish, but you are missing out on a truly stunning piece of home movie watching. By far the most beautiful set of Star Wars movies ever.",1316131200,40,2615,4.365503080082136

I poured over the reviews on here and actually thought about canceling my pre-order due to all the negative reaction so I wanted to put out what I think is a level headed review

Visually and sound wise the blu rays are great, especially ROTS, all huge improvement over the Standard Def DVDs. I would say the set is well worth the money. As someone who was born in 1972 and watched these movies for the first time when they came out - they blew me away. It was the reason I built a home theatre in my house and shelled out the money for a 1080p projector and these movies on blu ray on a wall size picture was worth all of it, I have been waiting for these on blu ray since blu ray came out-  probably like most people..these were the movies I wanted to see more than any other. Im not a fanboy or freaked out by the changes made to the original versions - while I think they absolutely suuuck, they don't ruin Star Wars for me. After listening to the commentary on ROTS by Lucas and others that worked on the prequels - you can tell why the prequels mostly sucked, Lucas and others on the prequels definitely fell in love with thier own believed self importance and infalibility as opposed to the originals where they did not know they were as smart and they now ""know"" they are and that probably explains why the originals weren't included
I agree that it would great to see the originals that I saw as a kid on blu ray and someday they probably will but I believe this set is well worth the money...I respect the people who refuse to buy this set due to the changes but I am happy I did and am loving seeing them on blu ray, im noticing things I never noticed before in the movies...",1316131200,20,1799,4.166666666666667

7221080,5,B00YI71PN2,"Just received the blu-rays today and watched sections of each of the movies to check out the quality of the HD video.  I had no problems, even with the ""pink"" light saber light.  (The pink is on the fringes, and the ""red"" light saber light is actually white with pink edges.  Looked realistic to me.)

The first movie historically, episode IV, is outstanding in terms of improved clarity of the picture and the color.  I have the original DVD versions, and this blu-ray not only improves the resolution but also the depth and color.  They clearly did a lot of work on this.  I got pulled in and watched the whole thing.  They did an outstanding job on upgrading the picture, and to be frank, I really didn't notice the new inserts.

While I wish George Lucas had simply packaged the original theatrical versions (which I loved), these revisions/additions are just as good from my standpoint.  The picture quality makes these classic movies come alive and the depth of the picture is great.  Blacks are solid and the colors look true.  The death star is something to behold in high definition.  The sound is great as well.

I think for most buyers, this blu-ray series will be well worth the investment and appreciated.  Although the packaging is minimal, it won't take up much space and the disks are protected (but just barely).  I gave it 5 stars for the quality of the picture and sound, not the packaging.",1316131200,112,1409,4.620967741935484
7221081,3,B00YI71PN2,"I love Star Wars.  I don't dig all the changes.  Like many, there are some that just make me cringe.  Yes, Han shot first. That said, there were things about the unaltered original trilogy that made (and make) me cringe also, like those dang Ewoks.  Never bought that the Empire was taken down by a bunch of walking stuffed animals.  And just how the heck did they get those giant logs hoisted into the trees? Yes, I would give anything to make stormtroopers as fast, accurate and deadly as their Prequel trilogy counterparts.  And to have the Ewoks (since there's no getting rid of them now) supplemented by an Endorian tribe of Wookies.  Now there's your epic battle.  I can just hear Chewie letting out a roar to signal his people to attack.  That would've been awesome.  But I digress.  Like I said, I'm a fan.  I will always love Star Wars, and just like any true love relationship, you have to take the warts and all.

That said, the Blu-ray edition of the complete films is a mixed bag.  For me, the biggest surprise is how unbelievably fake the prequel trilogy looks now in high definition, particularly Revenge of the Sith.  Don't get me wrong, the CG creatures and backdrops are truly jaw-dropping.  And live actors and set pieces look great too.  But it's the combining of the two that is painfully obvious.  It looks like really bad compositing now.  As if the whole film were just somehow unfinished.  Did you ever watch the new 'V' before it was cancelled on ABC?  You know when they were on the ship, and how obvious it was they were just standing in front of a green-screen?  Yeah, this is worse.  It looked great in theaters, and even on DVD, but sometimes I think high-definition can take away from a film.

Still, I love the set as a whole.  Because when you're a fan, you're a fan.  Love the extras, love the fact that the OT trilogy has NEVER looked this good before.",1316131200,12,1888,4.463343108504398
7221082,4,B00YI71PN2,"I gave this box set a 4 star because it deserves it. Since it looks like I am the first person on here to have actually bought the box set and watched it, I think it's fair to say that the rest of you are a little strange. First off, no one that has written a review before this had actually seen the media. Say what you will about the stuff you all saw on the Internet, none of it compares to the actual blu ray discs. The physical discs offer the cleanest, most crisp picture you can get. This cannot be accomplished through the videos seen online because they all fist have to be compressed in order to transfer their massive amounts of data. This makes all the Internet products look inferior to the physical media itself.
Next, we know that Georgie has changed parts of the films. Does that change the cannon of the story arch?  No, period.  Although the story is not enhanced by the changes, the changes within themselves do not take away from the story either: anyone who says that they do is out and out wrong. In addition, it is these same people who have posted reviews on Amazon without even seeing the final product. Not only are you people wrong about how the changes affect the films, you haven't even seen these versions yet.
So if you are wondering if you should buy this version of star wars, I suggest that you do if you don't already own the whole saga. I do own them and can tell you that the quality is high because I have seen them on blu ray, unlike these prejudice, pompous, ridiculous people who are more concerned with whining about small changes then passing on the story to another generation.",1316131200,15,1621,4.364238410596027

Lucas didn't even direct ROTJ and ESB. He's got some nerve twisting films crafted by others into deformed parodies of what they once were, especially given the content of his speech to congress. Greatest moment of the saga ruined the exact same way Vader's transformation in ROTS has become the most groan-inducing, laughably cheesy moment of the entire saga - with a single word:

NOOOOOOOOOO!!!

Seriously, it is me or is this particular revision chillingly spiteful? How could he possibly *not* know it would be universally despised? Is he that out of touch, or does he really loathe his fanbase so much that he'd deliberately antagonize them this way? Think about it. As a revision, it simply makes no artistic sense.

The movies are there, and there are changes. Get over it. It's first and foremost George's movie to tinker with. It's not like he has ordered all previous copies burnt. You have yours, I have mine. I think I speak for EVERYONE when I think the originals deserve to be blu-rayed, but that's another topic. The movies look, and sound great...and guess what? They're even better than before. The OT deleted scenes are fantastic, the PT is mostly animatics and they suck to be quite honest. The previous DVD deleted scenes are noticeably absent.

The Holiday Special is on this. Yeah. It's a cookie. A very weird, awkward cookie that I'm not even going to bother saying more on.

Honestly, blu-ray players aren't that expensive anymore, and either is this set. Buy it, love it, and be a grateful fan.

I go to the link and there is no update.  I have an HTPC with Arcsoft TMT3 (latest version).  I start searching around and EVERYONE is having this problem with TMT3/5 AND PDVD9/10.  I see that they did not get pre-release versions of these disks so they could test it so they are just starting to look at all the issues today.  Meanwhile, full versions unencumbered by copy protection are available for download.  The hackers have already figured out how to get around this new version of copy protection.  So once again, paying customers are suffering and those that are stealing it are enjoying their copies.

So I called Fox to get my refund.  The stooge on the phone told me that the disks aren't guaranteed to work.  Total BS.  For decades, EVERY SINGLE DVD/CD I HAVE WORKS ON EVERY SINGLE DVD/CD DEVICE.

I'm guessing I won't.

The sound is tremendous, however. I watched Episode IV last night and I remembered how it was actually John Williams who should have become the multi-billionaire, because without his music, that movie in particular is pretty hokey.

7221092,5,B00YI71PN2,"Look, let's start this off by saying I am a die-hard Star Wars fan and have been ever since I was younger. I'm almost 24 and still can't get enough of these movies. Sure, I don't know everything about the movies and every little detail, but I know enough that most people don't. So, lets start this off correctly:

Star Wars on Blu-ray is the best way to own these films. I may not own the most top-of-the-line TV and the best sound system, but all the films look amazing compared to their DVD counterpart and the sound will blow you away!

Sure, Lucas has made some changes. However, the first thing I did was go to these scenes and really take note on what everyone was complaining about. Yes, all the other changes he made previously are still in there, but like these new ones, they all have a common theme to me: They last about 2 seconds, and the movies are STILL THE SAME MOVIE. Had Lucas gone and rewritten that Leia was never Luke's sister or something, I think that's a reasonable thing to get angry over. Here's what I went over:

Episode 1: Yoda is digital. Impression: Positive! Holy cow, does he look GOOD. This sort of change is something that was necessary. The puppet Yoda always looked off to me, even at a young age. I didn't look at any other changes, or heard of any.

None from Episode 2 or 3 either that I'm aware of.

Episode 4: This is old, but, sorry, Greedo still shoots first. However the scene has been altered slightly and looks a lot more realistic vs. the old version. I still find this to be positive personally, but I'm not a stickler for these things.

R2 apparently is behind some new Rocks as the sand people are looking at the land speeder. Neutral on this one, I barely noticed the change until someone else pointed it out.

Ben's howl toward the sand people. Impression: Neutral/Negative. It feels off for some reason, but honestly, 2 seconds and it's over, to me, it doesn't ruin the film.

Episode 5: I heard they changed the Wampa's arm, but I didn't check, I'm sure it's a good thing from what I've heard.

Episode 6: NOOOOOOOO. Impression: Neutral. Really. It could have been done better, especially since Vader has no face it's hard to imagine him coming to the realization that this is wrong, but it's not HORRIBLE. I chuckled at first, but in time it will grow on me.

Ewoks blink. Heavens forbid something blinks. It looks fine and natural; nothing to get all mad over.

There are a few other (minor) things, but overall, NOTHING ruins these films. The people who are getting all worked up over this need to realize: It's NOT your movie! Lucas can do whatever he wants with his baby. If he goes and changes the whole plot of the movie, I'll fight with you. But a few minor changes to make his movies look better? Whatever, get over yourselves. I guess all this hype and bad ""reviews"" may have driven the price down, so at $80 for 6 films with the best picture and sound and tons of bonus features, you can't go wrong; it's friggin Star Wars.

I can't wait to have my own marathon of these movies and have a great time cherishing these films for years to come. Unless you've got a problem and demand to have originals, this set is a MUST OWN!",1316131200,45,3190,4.388135593220339

I highly recommend but the decision is still yours.

7221102,1,B00YI71PN2,"Okay, I'll admit ... this is a gripe, not a review ... get over it.

So here's Lucas in a nutshell ... he is an innovator, a creator, a story writer ... what he is NOT is a filmmaker, at least, not since his original STAR WARS.  For all he knows how to drive people to achieve technical miracles, for all he knows how to create an alternate galaxy ... he does NOT know how to translate that to a screenplay or a final film.  Lucas' BEST work was when he gave control over to Irvin Kershner for EMPIRE.  His WORST work was when he took FULL control over the prequels.  The writing in the prequels was outright atrocious, because Lucas doesn't understand the difference between dialogue and stage direction, having characters utter lines like ""I'm just so in love with you,"" rather than writing that in the margins of the script and letting the actors communicate that feeling with their performance.

And so we arrive at the worst change THIS go-around (for you know there will ALWAYS be another revision as long as Lucas lives).  Vader, when finally choosing to save his son by casting the evil Emperor into the abyss utters a quiet ""no"" as if to himself, and then a larger ""nooooo"" as if to make sure the Emperor understands he ain't happy!

Now, ""nooooooo"" should INDEED be what Vader is THINKING in this moment.  But to actually SAY it, and to say it so melodramatically ... that's the problem - that's where Lucas just flat out does not understand actors, dialogue, or even audiences!  We don't NEED to hear Vader make the decision out loud by saying ""no"" - his ACTION communicates everything.  His looking back and forth, slowly at first, then faster and faster until the audience is finally shouting ""DO IT ... DO IT!!!""  ... it builds, we see it building ... and then he does it, and we scream with joy!  ""Yes!! Finally!!!""

Do we REALLY need to add a ""noooooo"" to this scene?  No, we do not ... to do so is an insult to the audience.  And it, once again, shows us that Lucas does not know how to make a movie.  Plain ... and ... simple ... This sequence, in its original form, was a testament to the director (Richard Marquand), the actors, and the film editor, because the audience was able to figure out exactly what was going on in Vader's mind without him uttering one syllable.  That is ruined now...

Will I buy this set?  Will I overlook this destructive campaign of revision after revision for the sake of a few extra lines of resolution on my screen?

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!",1316131200,24,2490,4.476718403547672
7221103,5,B00YI71PN2,"""This will be a day long remembered."" This quote from the first Star Wars film, known since 1981 as ""Episode : A New Hope,"" describes the feelings of myself, and countless other Star Wars fans on the eagerly awaited Blu-ray release of the Star Wars saga.  I just received mine about two hours ago as of this writing.  But with every new release of Star Wars comes a looming question: What will George Lucas change this time?

This was not always the case.  Fifteen years of home video releases saw the trilogy presented exactly as they were seen in theaters (albeit usually in panned and scanned versions formatted to fit a standard television screen), and with the release of 1993's THX edition release (available in widescreen for the first time on VHS), it seemed the movies would never be better than they were.

The work Industrial Light & Magic did for Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park changed all that.  Lucas admitted that he was never happy with the way Star Wars came out, due mostly to restraints of time, money, and ILM's pioneering, yet crude technology, and announced that with current computer graphics, he could finally go back and complete scenes from the original trilogy that had bugged him for years.

1997 saw the release of the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition, a theatrical (and eventually home video) re-release of all three films with newly enhanced special effects, and a handful of additional scenes.  To say the reaction was mixed would be an understatement.  Nearly a decade-and-a-half after they were revealed to the world, many of the changes Lucas made have been heavily criticized and hotly debated.  Those who grew up on the originals felt that the new additions ruined the movies.  Disappointed fans took solace in the fact that at least they could still watch the original versions of the films at home on VHS.

Seven years later saw the DVD release of the ""Original Trilogy"" as it was now known, following two prequels, with one last film on the way.  Fans pleaded and prayed that Lucas would see fit to release the theatrical versions alongside the Special Editions, which were now said to have even more changes to better tie in the Originals with the Prequels.  Not only did they not get their wish (at least not until a few years later), but many fans scoffed at some of the newest changes made to the series, believing the prequels to be further ruining the series, and any changes made to accommodate those films would be even more detrimental to the dignity of the Original Trilogy.

So here we are today.  I have my Star Wars Blu-rays laying on my sofa, awaiting their weekend marathon.  I have heard rumors of even more changes to Episodes  through , as well as a few for  through .  These rumors include deleted scenes incorporated into the films, a new CG Yoda to replace the puppet (I knew they were doing this for Episode , though I'm still unsure about whether this plan also includes Episodes  and ), and the possibility of Han once again shooting first.  I will thank anyone who has knowledge of exactly what changes have been made to keep quiet.  I want to be surprised.

The thing is, after all these years of changes and complaints, I still don't see what the big deal is.  There are very few changes to the Original Trilogy to which I strongly object, and none of those changes affect the over-all film in any way.  What difference does it make whether Han or Greedo shoots first?  As long as Greedo misses, the other approximately 13 hours, 20 minutes, and 59 seconds of the saga remains roughly the same.  Sure, the Jabba the Hutt scene in A New Hope seems redundant and unnecessary in terms of the single film, and maybe it ruins the ""big reveal"" of Jabba in Return of the Jedi, but since Jabba already appears in The Phantom Menace (canonically the first film in the saga), and that scene was always supposed to be in A New Hope in the first place, it hardly ruins anything.  I will agree, Jedi Rocks sucks, Lapti Nek is better, but since it is only a nonsensical musical number with no relation to the plot, whichever song they use is more personal preference than pertinence.  Speaking of music, I also prefer the instrumental music and galactic celebrations used at the end of Jedi now to the ""Yub Nub"" teddy bear picnic from the original.  And as for replacing Sebastian Shaw with Hayden Christensen... it could have been done better, but again, it's only a few seconds of footage, and for the new generation of Star Wars fans who have grown up with the prequels, it does help tie the whole story together.

I have yet to even look at the Blu-rays (as of this writing), and I will not see anything from Episodes  through  until Sunday, but when I do I will reserve judgement, and determine for myself if anything ""ruins"" Star Wars.  I doubt anything will.  I might not agree with some of Lucas' decisions, but when it comes right down to it, they're not my -- nor anyone else's -- movies, but his.  I challenge anyone who says that they could make a better movie than George Lucas to do so.  Making fan edits and indie movies based on the Original Trilogy do not count as creativity.  They are just stealing a brilliant idea from a more successful person and modifying it to fit someone else's tastes.  The original movies were not perfect -- they have always had flaws -- but if the man who created them feels that the current versions are the best versions, that is his prerogative as their creator.  If you don't like them, create your own multi-billion dollar franchise, and make them your way.  These are his movies, and as long as they are his, they are mine too.  Besides, they are only movies...

UPDATE: I have just now finished watching all six movies and I can now confirm that more than ninety-nine percent of the saga appears on Blu-ray exactly as it appeared in theaters (Episodes  and  are, as far as I could tell, identical), with most of the alterations being to Episodes - , which are still nearly ninety-nine percent the same as their theatrical versions.

How do I come to this conclusion?  Simple arithmetic.  The combined total runtime of the entire saga is 805 minutes, 418 for the Prequels, 387 for the Original Trilogy.  The only noticeable changes to the prequels were the aforementioned CG Yoda, and a brief fly-through of Coruscant, both in Episode  (the fly-through was included on previous home video versions).  By my rough estimate, there are approximately 4-5 minutes of significant new footage to Episodes - combined: about one minute each for the Jabba scene and Jedi Rocks, about 30 seconds each for Mos Eisley and the Victory Celebration, and about a minute or two of scattered CG enhancements like the animated Dewbacks, Rebel fly-by, Cloud City expansions, Sarlacc, etc.  (The infamous ""Greedo shoots first"" shot is literally eight frames -- or one-third of a second -- long, in which Greedo fires an imperceptible two frames before Han.  I counted.)  Figuring conservatively that's approximately 98.7% of the Original Trilogy's footage left intact, all of which is story and character-based, meaning nothing even remotely alters the original plot.

I has been over a year since I've looked at the hours of deleted scenes and special features -- I forgot to update at the time -- but from what I recall, most of the were pretty interesting.  The most exciting ones were the deleted scenes from Episodes -.  I also liked the features on the building of the various models, including the Death Star  and the Super Star Destroyer.  The Prequels' features were a little less interesting.  Most of the best stuff was already included on the DVDs, and unfortunately, as far as I could tell, none of the were carried over to the Blu-ray, including, sadly, the deleted scenes.  It would have been nice to have had the option to watch to Prequels in extended branching versions, since most of the deleted scenes were mostly completed for the DVD release, and would have served the subplots of the trilogy, but the only deleted scenes we get here are incomplete, pointless, and in some cases, only animatics.",1316131200,17,8103,4.691436659589526

7221106,1,B00YI71PN2,"""My name is George Lucas. I am a writer, director, and producer of motion pictures and Chairman of the Board of Lucasfilm Ltd., a multi-faceted entertainment corporation.
I am not here today as a writer-director, or as a producer, or as the chairman of a corporation. I've come as a citizen of what I believe to be a great society that is in need of a moral anchor to help define and protect its intellectual and cultural heritage. It is not being protected.

The destruction of our film heritage, which is the focus of concern today, is only the tip of the iceberg. American law does not protect our painters, sculptors, recording artists, authors, or filmmakers from having their lifework distorted, and their reputation ruined. If something is not done now to clearly state the moral rights of artists, current and future technologies will alter, mutilate, and destroy for future generations the subtle human truths and highest human feeling that talented individuals within our society have created.

A copyright is held in trust by its owner until it ultimately reverts to public domain. American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history.
People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as ""when life begins"" or ""when it should be appropriately terminated,"" but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.

These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tommorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with ""fresher faces,"" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new ""original"" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires. The copyright holders, so far, have not been completely diligent in preserving the original negatives of films they control. In order to reconstruct old negatives, many archivists have had to go to Eastern bloc countries where American films have been better preserved.

In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be ""replaced"" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.

There is nothing to stop American films, records, books, and paintings from being sold to a foreign entity or egotistical gangsters and having them change our cultural heritage to suit their personal taste.

I accuse the companies and groups, who say that American law is sufficient, of misleading the Congress and the People for their own economic self-interest.
I accuse the corporations, who oppose the moral rights of the artist, of being dishonest and insensitive to American cultural heritage and of being interested only in their quarterly bottom line, and not in the long-term interest of the Nation.

The public's interest is ultimately dominant over all other interests. And the proof of that is that even a copyright law only permits the creators and their estate a limited amount of time to enjoy the economic fruits of that work.

There are those who say American law is sufficient. That's an outrage! It's not sufficient! If it were sufficient, why would I be here? Why would John Houston have been so studiously ignored when he protested the colorization of ""The Maltese Falcon?"" Why are films cut up and butchered?

Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.

I hope you have the courage to lead America in acknowledging the importance of American art to the human race, and accord the proper protection for the creators of that art, as it is accorded them in much of the rest of the world communities.""

Obi-wan's Dragon yell to scare away the sand people is kind of jarring and out of place. The scene was much more powerful  when the sand people ran off presumably because they knew who this old man was.
Greedo still shoots first.
All the other changes Lucas made in 2004 appear to remain intact - and purist have been up in arms over it - but these are Lucas' babies - so he has a right to tweak and change them as he wishes - although I don't agree all are for the better.

All in all though - these are great movies - and have been given a great transfer to Blu-ray and fans should be happy to add them to their collection.",1316131200,13,1119,4.2

Episodes 1-3, Episodes 4-6, and this set that has them all. So if you're a prequel hater, why did you buy the set that has the prequels? I would not trust reviews of people who say they hate the prequels but bought this set, then gave it a bad review. They are most likely liars. As far as the added stuff, big deal. So Vader says no, big woop. No reason not to watch my favorite movie in spectacular HD with excellent sound. Everyone who bought this set knew in advance of the changes and bought it anyway.

7221115,5,B00YI71PN2,"I'm only in my 20s so I didn't get to see Star Wars when it originaly came out in theaters.  My mom really liked Star Wars so I remember being about 8-10 years old and watching Star Wars almost every weekend.  I had the big black VHS set and on my big screen tv a lot of the movie would be black.  I specificly remember in ""Return of the Jedi"" not being able to see a lot of things in Jabba the Hut's hideout.  It was way to dark.  I was thrilled later in life to get the dvds and finally see everything that is happening.  I was a little dissapointed with the changes but now I'm used to them and cherish the scenes I remember from a kid.  In blu ray it's never looked better.

If you are someone who loves Star Wars and don't mind that some scenes were edited this is the best looking release of Star Wars yet.  I'm just half way through ""A New Hope"" and have said wow many times at the visuals.  I agree with some other reviewers there are more positives than negatives.  I do feel for people who went to the theaters in the 70s-80s a bunch of times to see Star Wars and can't see the exact version.  Overall I think it's an amazing blu ray.",1316131200,12,1144,4.013274336283186
7221116,5,B00YI71PN2,"I'll keep it short and sweet.

The quality of the films is first class.  It's hard to believe that I'm watching a film from 1977.  Phantom Menace got a major facelift and is excellent, both in sound and video.  I'm very, very pleased.

There are a boatload of bonus features.  Admittedly, I haven't watched all of them yet to determine their quality.  There are just too many.

The ""changes"" everybody keeps complaining about are really a non issue.  Yes, Vader's ""nooooo"" feels a bit out of place, but to take it down one star, let alone four for this comes off as fanatical.

If it aint broken, don't fix it.",1316131200,20,332,4.6440677966101696
7221119,1,B00YI71PN2,"First off, the fact that episodes 1-3 are included already makes this a waste of time and money.  Those movies were some of the worst movies ever made.  To make things worse, the alterations and additions ruin episodes 4-6.  At some point, the true fans of Star Wars episodes 4-6 will find 35mm prints of the films, and re-edit them in high-def to their original, un-molested form. Wait for those versions.",1316131200,16,406,4.690140845070423
7221120,1,B00YI71PN2,"""Noooo!"" made for a great meme. Fans had already given up long before ROTS came out, so the emphatic ""Noooo!"" that Vader lets out at the end of the film was a great target to laugh at. It was so over-the-top stupid, it was the pinnacle of Lucas' total inability to write a script, or create drama worthy of something outside of a children's cartoon. Seriously, remember it? The guy falls to his knees with his hands in the air and just cries, ""Nooo!"" and that's it. It was hilarious for most people for being so uproariously ridiculous. Most of us Star Wars fans don't acknowledge the prequels as canon, since they all sucked so horribly; we just act like they never existed, and rightfully so.

And, as I'm sure you know by now, someone decided to put that same cry into the very end of Return of the Jedi, the ultimate climax that left everyone breathless. If it's not clear yet what everyone's talking about, they added in the voice-over to the final scene in Return of the Jedi when Vader stops the Emperor from killing his son. It was a scene that was perfect in every way, stunningly emotional, showing us that Vader was never completely lost to the influence of the Emperor. Again, after the original version, it left everyone breathless. Well, it still does that, but for a very, very different reason: It makes the whole scene retarded, and ruins the entire film. If you're unfortunate enough not to know this is the case and purchased the Blu-rays blindly, you'll be in for a very depressing surprise. I believe that, much like the prequels, this is one version of Star Wars, along with the others that were totally unnecessary cash-ins, that we will pretend never happened. It's best for everyone that way.",1316131200,24,1717,4.611111111111111

I watched episodes three, four, five and six and they all have audio issues. That being there are several and I do mean several moments that the audio is muted, very annoying. If you have the DVDs just stick to them. There's not enough increased quality here to make it worth the annoyance. And you watch, ol' George will find ways to fix these and add more nonsense.

I remember walking out of the theater trying to get ""CP30"" (how I said it then) right.  I was transfixed.  Got the action figures, the little death star kit with the trash compactor.  The next two movies were epic as ever as I entered my teen years.

I had a wonderful moment taking my own son to see Ep III.  Talk about the circle of life.  I loved them as a kid.  He loves them as a kid.

I'm not going to pass on these--which have been preordered since January--because of a scene here and there.  They look fantastic and we enjoy them.  If you don't want them, don't buy them.  I'm sure, eventually, the originals will be released.

I agree with most of you--I think Lucas has flipped his lid.  He basically lives in the same Tom Cruise orbit where no one around him is willing to tell him no.  Maybe Spielberg should stage an intervention.

Han shouldn't shoot first.  Vader shouldn't shout ""NOOOO.""  Ewoks probably don't need eyelids.  But I'm not going to let that stuff ruin a cherished, shared family experience.

This thing is averaging two stars, mostly because of the flood of 1 star reviews, from people not even buying it?

My kid, who couldn't wait on the blu ray, discovered a battered DVD of Episode I in his room.  I tried to convince him to wait but he couldn't.  I went in to check on him, and the first comment was how funny Jar Jar Binks is.  The most reviled character in the history of the franchise.

  For all you 1 star reviewers.... Get a life! These changes come from the creator George Lucas himself, if he wants to improve on his vision let him. You can't judge an entire saga on some minor changes your probably upset that the Sagas being rereleased in theaters in 3D too Huh?

Stop tinkering with a film that has great historical significance! Please give us a straight up exact copy of the Academy Award winning original theatrical release in high-def on Blu-ray. I honestly don't care if it includes zero additional content. I just want a high-def transfer of the unaltered original film and I guarantee I'll buy it when you make it.

Until we get a high-def transfer of the original, I refuse to buy another Star Wars product, be it book, movie, or whatever.

I'm not saying I agree with all the changes but as another reviewer said if your a true fan of Star Wars then get over it. Or just don't buy it! Who are we to say ""you better do this"" or ""you better do that Mr. Lucas""? Again, its his dream. Its HIS baby (so to speak).
He has the technology in his hands to make true what he saw throughout this entire process a process that has consumed almost his entire life!
If you where a director, producer, writer, creator you would reserve the right to make changes too.
Again, we may fill his pockets but without him there would be no Star Wars so think about that.
Now I must go and watch my new Star Wars on blu ray!!!

Updated a long time ago in a galaxy far far away...
Shortly after initial review.

I do agree with most that Lucas should have preserved the originals on blu ray format but sadly he did not.
Hope this finds everyone well and now I must return to my HD SW in 6.1 surround sound!
I guess I'm willing to trade off some off Lucas insanity (I do not dispute that some of the changes and additions are off the wall) for quality sound and picture.

Further edited....

After a few hours of thinking about it I wonder if the negative reviews are Trekkies in disguise trying to tarnish a great thing?

7221128,1,B00YI71PN2,"Sorry George, you have taken what was a masterpiece and ruined it.  We all knew the movies where not perfect, the effects where dated and the dialog cheesey at times.  But we that was all part of the charm and what made it special.  But even now you can't stop playing with a classic, I am going to save my money and not buy this travesty.  And to fish a quote from George himself

""My name is George Lucas. I am a writer, director, and producer of motion pictures and Chairman of the Board of Lucasfilm Ltd., a multi-faceted entertainment corporation.
I am not here today as a writer-director, or as a producer, or as the chairman of a corporation. I've come as a citizen of what I believe to be a great society that is in need of a moral anchor to help define and protect its intellectual and cultural heritage. It is not being protected.

The destruction of our film heritage, which is the focus of concern today, is only the tip of the iceberg. American law does not protect our painters, sculptors, recording artists, authors, or filmmakers from having their lifework distorted, and their reputation ruined. If something is not done now to clearly state the moral rights of artists, current and future technologies will alter, mutilate, and destroy for future generations the subtle human truths and highest human feeling that talented individuals within our society have created.

A copyright is held in trust by its owner until it ultimately reverts to public domain. American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history.
People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as ""when life begins"" or ""when it should be appropriately terminated,"" but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.

These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tommorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with ""fresher faces,"" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new ""original"" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires. The copyright holders, so far, have not been completely diligent in preserving the original negatives of films they control. In order to reconstruct old negatives, many archivists have had to go to Eastern bloc countries where American films have been better preserved.

In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be ""replaced"" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.""

There is nothing to stop American films, records, books, and paintings from being sold to a foreign entity or egotistical gangsters and having them change our cultural heritage to suit their personal taste.

I accuse the companies and groups, who say that American law is sufficient, of misleading the Congress and the People for their own economic self-interest.
I accuse the corporations, who oppose the moral rights of the artist, of being dishonest and insensitive to American cultural heritage and of being interested only in their quarterly bottom line, and not in the long-term interest of the Nation.

The public's interest is ultimately dominant over all other interests. And the proof of that is that even a copyright law only permits the creators and their estate a limited amount of time to enjoy the economic fruits of that work.

There are those who say American law is sufficient. That's an outrage! It's not sufficient! If it were sufficient, why would I be here? Why would John Houston have been so studiously ignored when he protested the colorization of ""The Maltese Falcon?"" Why are films cut up and butchered?

Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.

I hope you have the courage to lead America in acknowledging the importance of American art to the human race, and accord the proper protection for the creators of that art--",1316131200,25,4849,4.8393719806763285

My hope is that people refuse to buy this set or that it doesn't sell as well as Lucas thought it would so they understand that fans of the saga don't want this anymore. It's one thing to complain about it and something entirely different to stand up against him by not giving him anymore money.

7221145,1,B00YI71PN2,"Words cannot describe how stupefied George Lucas has made me. The numerous modifications to this edition brings back the very same nauseated feeling when watching the ""remastered"" flight into Cloud City when the VHS set came out. The awful CGI has only become a growing motif in regards to the Star Wars IP; there is an entire TV series which runs off of this principle change--for a target audience to which these offensive, ill-conceived visuals are marketing towards. Star Wars was originally intended for kids, but its collective following garnered enormous support from all age demographics over the decades. What baffles me is why George actually EXPENDS MONEY in making these modifications, instead of IMPROVING upon the EXISTING Audio \ Visual elements. That is to say, Georges idea of improvement involve modifying metaphysical aspects, such as the atmosphere of a situation, where he should have been focusing on something like color saturation, audio levels, things which could be taken advantage of in the contemporary living room. Instead adding some half-baked excuse of a graphic ""extra"" character walking in the background is immensely distracted in low resolution situations; it is tenfold worse exploded on a larger high definition screen. He needs to simply release the originals, in HD, period. Nothing else, nothing extra is needed. I don't want special features, or deleted scenes, I don't want anything of that nature, and that's what the fans--at least I believe as much--feel. All this time and money has been expended for something denaturalized from its original form, it isn't an improvement of the old, but some sick twisted mutation, a foggy image of what once was. Perhaps that's saying a lot about George Lucas at this point in his career, maybe he should just get out of the business all together.",1316044800,44,1830,5.144295302013423

The new sound for Obi-Wan scaring off the Sand People was awful, and sounded like it was made in a small sound stage; the Greedo shoots first scene is still awful; Ewoks should not have CGI eyes; and Vader isn't the type to yell out, ""NOOOOO!!"" as he makes the fateful decision to save the life of his son.  I'm still upset about other changes made in the past, such as adding in a bad dub of Threepio explaining how the tractor beam is controlled by X different switches in the Death Star, and a power loss at any one of these would allow the ship to leave.  It's pointless and sounds awful!  And since when do clones raised from babies have the exact same *accent* as their prime?  Give Boba Fett his original voice back!  And need I say it?  ... Yes.  Han shoots first!!

You can still find the original trilogy on the Limited Edition DVDs that came out a few years ago, but those are going fast.  They also are letter-boxed (not anamorphic widescreen), standard stereo (no surround sound) and are very raw, with graininess and lines the order of the day.  But at least they are not altered!

To borrow from one of my favorite web comics (Dork Tower), he spends all this time revising movies that were beyond popular, and yet does *nothing* in an attempt to improve ""Howard the Duck""??

I love both of the trilogies as they both tell two cohesive and engaging stories with compelling characters, crisp storytelling and thrilling action.  The original trilogy that I saw was the 2004 DVDs so I wasn't made aware of the changes until I looked it up on the internet.  I didn't mind them; they seemed trivial and didn't affect the storytelling in my opinion.  When they announced the Complete Set on Blu Ray, I excitedly pre-ordered it like millions of others.  Then the unthinkable happened.  George Lucas ruined the climactic scene of Return of The Jedi for NO GOOD REASON whatsoever.  I didn't mind the other changes; the blinking Ewoks, Obi-Wan's wuss scream, Jabba's new CGI door but this was unforgivable.  I sadly cancelled my order because I can't in good conscience pay for this.  Say what you will about the 2004 versions but none of them ruined important iconic moments or scenes.  I will still buy the Prequels on Blu Ray tomorrow but it still saddens me that I won't be seeing the Original trilogy in HD until Lucas pulls his head out of his ass and undoes the damage he has done.... who knows how long that will be.",1316044800,11,1296,4.567099567099567

7221161,5,B00YI71PN2,"I have to say, all the complaining about the Blu Ray version of the Star Wars saga has really opened my eyes to how ignorant Fanboys are.

Don't get me wrong, I geek out about Star Wars probably more than they do, and I'm also not a sucker. That being said, fanboys need to take it down a few notches over this release. It's misleading to the people actually interested in buying this collection. If you have a problem with this release DON'T BUY IT! If you'd rather wait to see if Lucasfilm puts out another version or six of this -- then WAIT!

It's pretty ridiculous that you take something you claim to love so dearly for granted. I was alive and comprehensive when Lucas put out all the different DVD versions and guess what -- I'M NOT DEAD! And guess what else -- I had my version from 2004 and I decided I didn't need the new versions so -- I DIDN'T BUY THEM!!!

It doesn't take  a Star Trek fan to put together this simple equation: A(I have a version of the Star Wars saga I like) + B(I don't need a newer version) x C(A newer version of Star Wars) = I DON'T NEED IT SO I WON'T BUY IT.

Although it is ignorant of me to assume fanboys with nothing better to do WOULDN'T take precious time out of their day and reserve it to lampooning Lucas, Lucasfilm and Star Wars because, in true Shakespearian fashion, they don't have what Lucas has and are denying his attempt to profit off them.

Here's an easy way to stick it to Lucas...DON'T GIVE HIM YOUR MONEY!!

It flabbergasts me that something you can claim to love so much is taken for granted and rejected so violently. Just get it together and chill out. I'm not a Lucas apologist, I don't work for Lucasfilm or 20th Century, I love Star Wars and I will protect that even if it means taking on parasites from the inside.

For the record: None of the majority of the Original Trilogy specs that appear on the disc have been released before. Never has the saga been available in HD picture quality or sound quality for keeps (I am aware they aired on Spike in HD but you can't record in Blu Ray quality, at least not this quality). Most of the specs are new and boo-hoo if Lucas fixed some more things. You're honestly telling me if you could go back and correct your past mistakes and the worst that would happen is you piss off fanboys, you wouldn't?

That's true ignorance. Look at the flip side of the coin folks, and just shut up and enjoy Star Wars. It's a freaking film saga, and no one is mandating you go out and buy this. I'm not criticizing your freedom of speech, I'm using mine and saying they way you're going about exercising your right is stupid, foolish, ignorant and a poor reflection on the true Star Wars fans out there.

After discovering it pretty much for the first time in the 90's, I fell in love.  If I remember correctly it was the THX certified re-releases circa late 90s that was the first set I watched start to finish, shortly before the new prequel series came out.  I finally understood exactly what I had missed and why these movies were such a big deal.  Since then, I have seen the prequel trilogy and just about every release up to this point.  I have been anxiously awaiting the day it might arrive on Blu Ray so I can soak up the 5.1 or 7.1 sound and see a brilliantly revived THX certified picture in all its digitized glory.

I've built myself up for what I would consider a reasonable restoration of these films.  Sure, they'll get rid of the graininess, maybe do some basic color correction and leave us with a finely-tuned and clarified set of films deserving of a stake in my Blu Ray collection.  Unfortunately, George Lucas seems much more interested in adding and changing things instead.  I have watched the countless clips of Vader screaming ""Nooooooooo"" and Ewoks blinking, Yoda being replaced by a CGI clone of himself and so on, only to find that its all an unnecessary layer (or several) that actually subtract from the original films, rather than add anything of substance.

As an artist, photographer and creative consultant and enthusiast I must tell you that knowing when to be finished with something is just as important as knowing when to put your ideas to work and create something new.  I suggest George Lucas move on from the constant augmenting of these films.  I don't support the changes and will use my purchasing power to show it.  Sorry Georgie, i'll be waiting until you get the hint that this isn't what your fans want from these films.  Stick to restoration and nothing more, bring this out in its original but restored form and then we'll talk about me handing over some money.

7221185,1,B00YI71PN2,"In 1977 my brother and I, along with a couple of friends went across the bay to the Coronet theater to see Star Wars.  I was unimpressed at the time, having seen a couple of the silly trailers.  As we got closer to the theater - still some blocks away - I noticed these looooong lines, and discovered that they went off in 2 directions, and ended (or began) at the theater, and that we were going to be at the end of one of those looooong lines.  At that time I had to reevaluate the purpose of my being there.

1st - I was stranded; I either had to endure the line or find an alternate way home.

2nd - Since these people were obviously in line to see the same movie (this was in the days before the multiplex cinemas), what was so special about it that they would endure such an excruciating wait?

3rd - Did I really want to spend the rest of the day standing in line in San Francisco to see a movie that looked so silly?

As it turned out, of course I stood in line, and was shocked to discover that everybody in that line, including me, made it into the next showing, and the excitement in that theater when the lights dimmed, the curtains opened, the 20th Century Fox fanfare blared, to be followed by absolute silence, was almost unbearable.  Then the simple blue ""a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" intro, and the crowd became almost ecstatic.  Of course, then the ""Star Wars"" Crawl.  Keep in mind that this was NOT ""Episode IV.""  It was simply called ""Star Wars.""  Everybody laughed out loud at the antics of C3PO and R2D2, booed and hissed the first time they saw Darth Vader, and were totally caught up in the movie.  Many stayed to watch as the curtain finally closed, then went outside, and GOT RIGHT BACK INTO LINE AGAIN!  And, I was one of them!  Over the next 3 years I saw the movie some 20 times, and countless times since then on video or TV.

Then, Star Wars became ""Episode IV: A New Hope.""  ""Empire Strikes Back"" came out - deeper, darker, but not as stimulating as the original.  ""Return Of The Jedi"" came out in 1983, which closed the book on the Luke Skywalker saga.  If Lucas had left the originals alone, maybe just tweak a scene here or there (like removing the vaseline ""forcefield"" effect of the speeder in the first film), then I'm sure that nobody would have minded his re-edits.  But, once he had his hand in digital effects, he altered the entire series.

Then, The Darth Vader saga was released (""The Phantom Menace"", ""Attack of The Clones,"" and ""Revenge Of The Sith,"" and the whole premise of the entire franchise shifted to focus on Vader's life and redemption.  Not to mention that the last three were a shadow of the originals, and the ""answers"" that were provided to explain events that had unfolded in the ""Luke"" saga caused those of us particularly familiar with those questions (e.g. when Luke asks Leia about her mother in ROTJ, or Ben tells Luke that Luke's father wanted his son to have his lightsabre in ANH), that Lucas was just ""mailing it in.""  George Lucas had abandoned his original audience in favor of a dumber group who only wanted to see battles with lightsabres and blasters, and was completely unconcerned with the story.

Still he tweaked, released the original 3 in a VHS package, then a few years ago a dvd package.  I dutifully bought those, along with the individual dvds of each of the Darth Vader saga as they were released.  I saw Han Solo reduced from the rogue character he initially was to being merely a pilot with some fighting skills.  I met a ""younger"" Jabba that failed to move the story along.  There was also additional backgrounds and characters, even some characters that had been replaced.  Even Darth Vader's likeness was changed.

Now, with this new package, which I've had added to my cart since it was announced, I'm being told that there are even more changes made, and none seem to be improvements.  I want to see the same movies I went to see at the theater.  Those were art - even the newer ones still had some value.  If GL wants to make real money then he could sell the originals in all their Blu-Ray ORIGINAL glory (adding the additional footage, digital enhancements, etc as additional items), and continue to sell this package - which is what this review is supposed to be about) separately.  As it stands, I've REMOVED the set from my cart, and refuse to buy it.

Mr Lucas, I only hope you read this, but I doubt that you will.  Maybe others will - and use their wallets to make a statement.",1316044800,46,4493,4.410194174757281

What I am just as disappointed about is the exclusion of extra features that were on previous DVD editions. How hard would it have been to include them on this set? Not hard at all, I'd imagine. Instead we get things like a very short interview snippets and featurettes celebrating Star Wars fans and tv/movie/internet spoofs. Sure, there's a lot of good stuff here but it could have included all the previously released material too. As it stands, hardcore fans will have to hold on to their bonus discs from old DVD releases.

As for the video and audio quality of the movies themselves...outstanding. It's the best they've ever looked on home video. If I had to give a rating for quality alone I would give it 5 stars. As it is, I have to mark it down for not giving the option of viewing the original trilogy without all the 'special edition' changes and for not including previously available special features.",1316044800,30,1109,4.716494845360825

Me, I'm going to enjoy all the films with all the updates and IMPROVEMENTS including Episode I - III for what it is... part of the Star Wars universe. For your information, by the way, those VHS versions are not the same as the theatrical editions anyway so good luck finding the bootleg recordings from inside movie theater if you want to see what you saw as a kid. The more Lucas adds to the movies the better. More animated movies too? Bring it on. More Clone Wars, why not? The sense of entitlement you 1 star givers have is ludicrous. Grow up and quit whining.

I tried to keep an objective mind, and I thought I'd rather see for myself what the changes were about, and THEN form an opinion.
Needless to say, I'll pass up.

The much maligned Vader scene is as bad as people have described. This is truly awful, not to mention unnecessary. This is downright laughable. The original moment was so powerful precisely because Vader's silence told so much about his inner conflict, looking back and forth at Luke and the Emperor, until he resolved it. Now we're left with a mock-up of George (the one from the Tex Avery's cartoons, not Lucas).
For that scene alone, it's reason enough to bypass this set.
I also lent an eye (or an ear, as the case might be) to the re-dubbed Dragon cry from Obi-wan. It sounds like someone had too much fun with the time-stretch function in Adobe Audition. It actually has a comical effect, by now.

I didn't watch the supplementary changes. No need.

A mostly, and surprisingly, unaltered episode 5 with nothing really blasphemous coming to mind. And a completely and utterly UNWATCHABLE episode 6 that has so many changes done to it that it is a crime. The last 15 are so atrocious and appalling that if your the cynical type you'll be laughing at the end.

Now, for those of you who may be concerned about this: yes, Darth Vader now cries ""nooo"" twice when he takes the emperor at the very end of the saga, in episode VI.

The simple fact that there are numerous versions, updates, re-edits, additions, improvements, & abolishments is proof that historic interest in Star Wars has developed a society of mental goof balls.  These are moviews after all.  It's not like Luke and Han and Chewy are sitting around the Intergalactic Cantina pontificating on how they let the universe down by not putting the best version of their story on blu-ray.

Here's the truth for me - I won't buy this version, nor will I go into painstaking detail on the pros and cons of this release over all the others.  I live in the here and now, not the glorified past of how a movie featuring space puppets made me a better appreciator of art, or a successful business man.  These movies remain great fairy tales, nothing more than a retelling of stories we've all heard before in nursery rhymnes and through Shakespeare.
My memories of the original 3 are the same as many others, and I too was disappointed in the later 3.  But we can't be kids forever.  If we hold on to our childhood fantasies too long we become ignorant and obscene.  Just read the other 1000+ posts here to confirm that.

So grow up you queers.  Rely on your memories to validate how great these movies are.  I'll occassionally pull out the old VHS tapes and watch the original trilogy as it was meant to be seen; slightly hazy, scratchy and complete with the occassional mistake that kept the story grounded as nothing more than a fantasy.

Really George, do you think I'm that stupid, really? honestly?! There are fans out there who are going to buy these anyway & to those fans I say, this proves that George can wholesale alter (or in my view slaughter) dramatic content in his movie (namely Jedi) & you will still buy it, well this is the last straw for me. I was excited about this set, but i've cancelled my pre-order. The only way he is going to get the hint people is by not buying it, I mean if it looks like a duck & quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck!!!
  The reason is that now he's screwed up the whole purpose of Return of the Jedi. The whole movie is basically summed up start, middle & end with the last act of Jedi, but so much for that. What George SHOULD HAVE done is exactly what Ridley Scott did with the Blade Runner blu-ray, include every version in the set, all 3 theatrical versions of Star Wars, Empire & Jedi, the 1997 theatrical re-release special editions & his tinkered version. Make it a humongous set, load it up with extras on each disc with the movies and with extra discs & said here.
Now that is something I would have been in the front of the line for. Not some Hack job re-do that he is trying to pass off as the movie he wanted to release.

And now George has messed up the bluray release with pointless tinkering.

7221231,1,B00YI71PN2,"In the opening scene of the 1942 film classic, Casablanca, we see a plane on final approach into the distressed city's airport. By today's standard it looks like a cardboard cutout dangling from a fishing line. 1933's King Kong portrays stop motion creatures, including those of the title character, whose movements are jerky & clearly artificial. The original Star Trek television series is campy with cheesy props & special effects. And as a movie fan (geek) I can honestly assert that I wouldn't have it any other way. Their inherent deficiencies do nothing to detract from the quality of the films themselves.

That said, I will admit that I was excited about the 'changes' made to the original Star Wars Trilogy when they were RE-released to theaters in 1997. Even though I felt that the Star Wars Saga was great as is, I cheered when each improvement showed up on the big screen. They were new & really looked cool. I totally get what motivated George Lucas to do it. Aside from re-adding those scenes that were made back in the 70s, Lucas was improving the aesthetic image of the films. I saw it as a different type of 'director's cut' editing - if he could have filmed it that way in the 70s he would have, so adding them in later isn't such a big deal. But now, after several more releases, each with more & more changes (to dialogue especially), I am of the opinion, ""Enough already!""

I'm not going to get into whether or not I believe Mr. Lucas can or should alter his works. I'm simply going to state my opinion - I don't like it. Many of the changes have gone beyond a director's cut & improving the aesthetic look of the films. Vader mumbling ""NO"" as he vanquishes the Emporer, Luke screaming as he falls down the Cloud City shaft instead of quietly accepting death over the pain of Vader's news, the image of Sebastian Shaw as a redeemed Anakin Skywalker being replaced with Hayden Christensen, they all change my emotional reactions to the films. I'm finding myself rolling my eyes more than raising my eyebrows.

I've had the latest release of Star Wars on Blu-ray on pre-order since it was announce. Yesterday, I canceled that order. For me, the price is no longer worth it. It isn't the same film I once enjoyed in my youth anymore. By no means am I calling this a boycott, rather, a decline to buy a product I feel is of a low, low quality.

I have three copies on the original trilogy.  The original vhs releases, the special edition releases, and the DVD box set.  I also own the DVDs of the prequel trilogy.  These movies are great and I have seen them all dozens of times.  My home theater is begging for an HD version of these movies so my kids and I can enjoy them in the best possible manner.

These are not the blu rays I'm looking for.

If it was Lucas who decided to add Vader's ""no, nooooo!"" into the climactic scene of Return of the Jedi, he has officially lost it.  It ruins the scene.  First of all, it does not sound like it was edited by a professional (in the UK version at least, that is the only one I've actually seen it on).  Second, it does not sound like James Earl Jones.  Third, why?  Just why?  That scene was perfect.  The music and movement showed Vader's turmoil and ultimate decision with absolute perfection.  This edit is a deal breaker for me.  Lucas will make money hand over fist on this but it has the unique characteristic of being the first version released in thirty years that I will not be purchasing.",1315872000,31,1337,4.327935222672065

The climax to the entire saga is ruined when Darth Vader screams ""NOOOOOO!"" in the previously silent and very emotional redemption scene. If you saw a clip of this before buying this set, you'd be forgiven for thinking it was an amateur youtube parody, but it's not. There are many more changes than this, but one can look these up with a quick search. All Lucasfilm needs to do is release both versions in the same set and noone will have any complaints. Ridley Scott did it with blade runner, including 4 different cuts of the film.

As for the Prequel Trilogy, again, these aren't the theatrical cuts either, but I don't care as much about this as they're hardly great films in the first place. But film preservation deserves to be respected even with regard to them.

The deleted scenes disk is severely lacking for the Prequel Trilogy. All are unfinished and in extremely low quality, and most are just test animatics. It all just seems like half a job.

Appalling.

All the people who are defending these inferior remakes have forgotten what it was like to watch the originals.

It's obvious that Lucas does not care about the fans or the legacy, as the original theatrical releases are not even in as bonus material.  If the originals were released as bonus content in this set, it would be a must-buy.  As it is, the studio is relying on uneducated consumers to grudgingly pick this up to prove that they are fans.  I'm just PRAYING that consumers bother to read the reviews before purchasing this set and vote with their wallets.

7221240,1,B00YI71PN2,"This is a response to the comments that it's useless to rate an unreleased product. I would generally agree except that this product has been released over the course of nearly 35 years. It would be equally fair to comment on a boxed set of a television series which one has seen every episode. Furthermore, the fact that we know what changes have been wrought to the aggregated product from video clips and the inate fluency with which many people can mouth along silently every word of dialogue allows them to reasonably plug them in mentally and compare against prior versions.

What the dwindling legion of stalwarts firmly entrenched in the pro-blu-ray change camp might fail to appreciate, is that the overwhelming criticism go far beyond knee-jerk reactions to rewriting our cherished memories. The changes conflict with and undermine well established rules about story-telling that were simple enough to allow millions of people with divergent experiences and tastes to suspend disbelief and get wrapped up in the film. Star Wars wasn't as big as it is because of Jedis or lightsabers or aliens or fascist enemies or muppets or special effects or cinematography or music or catchy one-liners or drawn out plot elements or the final redemption of the protagonist/antagonist. It was all these combined. It was the things that the Academy saw in it and recognized it as a good film irrespective of the franchise.

The original Star Wars movies were great movies WITHOUT the enthusiasm of fanboys who went to the theater in costumes and staged lightsaber battles in the front row. The Star Wars prequels were not great movies DESPITE the enthusiasm of fanboys who lined up for days to be there opening night. It is by the same metrics that we judge other movies that critics of the blu-ray release base their reaction on. We know these films inside and out, forwards and backwards. The changes over the last fifteen years have reconciled for many people what the difference between a great movie and a flash-in-the-pan.

Most of the 1-star reviews are based on known criteria and a track-record of failure by Lucasfilm to meet the demands of so many fans. Manyt of the 5-star reviews (but not all, I'll give credit where it is due) are based on expected enjoyment that won't stand the test of time. It's no surprise, then, that so many 5-star reviews were written soon after the anouncement was made. Bears beat the bulls on this one.

This is stupid. I can't believe I'm so pissed off. I feel like the parent of junkie who struggles to hold out hope. I love Star Wars, but it squandered so much potential on quick-fixes and fast money. I still love a part of it and that love will never die, but until it cleans up his act, no matter how much it knocks at my door and leaves delicious offerings of behind-the-scenes footage or deleted scenes, I will not tolerate its presence in my house. Go somewhere else with your lies and broken promises. You haven't changed. And for all the highs, which I still love you for, they can no longer make up for the disappointment and tears that you bring when you try to peddle your smack 'round here. So go! Get off my porch! If you think you have 5-star friends, well then stay with them. But you'll see. You keep this up and one day you'll wake up feeling empty and completely alone - if you ever wake up.

However, the golden rule, if there is one, in any piece of art, is never change the very essence of the work.  The Nooooo! placed in the ROTJ scene is unforgivable for me.  The Noooo from the third prequel was awful scene with nearly zero emotional impact.  However, Darth Vader throwing the emperor down the shaft is one of the best scenes in all the movies, a pivotal moment, (and one of the few good scenes in ROTJ to be honest).

7221249,1,B00YI71PN2,"In 1988, George Lucas stood before Congress and issued the following statement:

""My name is George Lucas. I am a writer, director, and producer of motion pictures and Chairman of the Board of Lucasfilm Ltd., a multi-faceted entertainment corporation.

I am not here today as a writer-director, or as a producer, or as the chairman of a corporation. I've come as a citizen of what I believe to be a great society that is in need of a moral anchor to help define and protect its intellectual and cultural heritage. It is not being protected.

The destruction of our film heritage, which is the focus of concern today, is only the tip of the iceberg. American law does not protect our painters, sculptors, recording artists, authors, or filmmakers from having their lifework distorted, and their reputation ruined. If something is not done now to clearly state the moral rights of artists, current and future technologies will alter, mutilate, and destroy for future generations the subtle human truths and highest human feeling that talented individuals within our society have created.

A copyright is held in trust by its owner until it ultimately reverts to public domain. American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history.

People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as ""when life begins"" or ""when it should be appropriately terminated,"" but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.

These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tomorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with ""fresher faces,"" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new ""original"" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires. The copyright holders, so far, have not been completely diligent in preserving the original negatives of films they control. In order to reconstruct old negatives, many archivists have had to go to Eastern bloc countries where American films have been better preserved.

In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be ""replaced"" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.

There is nothing to stop American films, records, books, and paintings from being sold to a foreign entity or egotistical gangsters and having them change our cultural heritage to suit their personal taste.

I accuse the companies and groups, who say that American law is sufficient, of misleading the Congress and the People for their own economic self-interest.

I accuse the corporations, who oppose the moral rights of the artist, of being dishonest and insensitive to American cultural heritage and of being interested only in their quarterly bottom line, and not in the long-term interest of the Nation.

The public's interest is ultimately dominant over all other interests. And the proof of that is that even a copyright law only permits the creators and their estate a limited amount of time to enjoy the economic fruits of that work.

There are those who say American law is sufficient. That's an outrage! It's not sufficient! If it were sufficient, why would I be here? Why would John Houston have been so studiously ignored when he protested the colorization of ""The Maltese Falcon?"" Why are films cut up and butchered?

Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.

I hope you have the courage to lead America in acknowledging the importance of American art to the human race, and accord the proper protection for the creators of that art--as it is accorded them in much of the rest of the world communities.""",1315785600,31,4618,4.911424903722722
7221250,1,B00YI71PN2,"When people ask my what my favorite movies are, the Star Wars saga has always been on the top of my list.  Growing up, I considered myself a tremendous fan that not only collected as much Star Wars memorabilia as possible, but watched the movies as often as I could.  As a teenager, I built a web site dedicated to the films, which in turn influenced my decision to be a software developer today.  It goes without saying that these movies changed my life.

But after the release of the Special Editions in 1997, there were so many awkward changes to the original trilogy that sitting through a viewing was difficult.  I am not going to focus on all of the changes made to this release; that has all been said one thousands times.  What I do want to say is I am not sure why I still call myself a fan of Star Wars.  I haven't watched A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, or Return of the Jedi in over a decade.  The original versions of the original trilogy are too engrained into my nerdy soul, and it bitters me to see all of the changes to what were once my favorite films.

Most of us know the story about the student who convinced George Lucas that the final movie should not be called ""Revenge of the Jedi,"" because the revenge is against the Jedi mantra.

And I could have lived with pretty much every change - EXCEPT NoooooooooGate.

CGI Yoda in Phantom Meanace?  Ok.
Change Obi-Wan's scream in New Hope?  Comical, but livable.

David Prowse's body language was ALL that needed to be said in that, frankly, very historic and very powerful scene.  Make all the little cosmetic and CGI-happy changes you like to your films.

7221266,1,B00YI71PN2,"To start off, I write this not as an irate fanboy, but rather as a concerned citizen as to the direction in which a historically significant and classic piece of cinema is being taken and is becoming lost to the ages.

The current Blu-ray set of Star Wars being offered here DOES NOT include the Original Theatrical Releases of the Original Star Wars Trilogy. They do however include the revised versions with past and recently added changes to the Original films of 'Star Wars', 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi'.

Why does this matter? The original three films, Star Wars (1977), the Empire Strikes Back (1980) and The Return of the Jedi (1983)as they were released in the theaters are now considered classic films. However, in 1997 they were re-released in theaters as 'Special Editions' with many changes to the visual effects, color quality, sound and editing. These 'Special Editions' significantly altered the content, style, and characters in several scenes of the films. These 'Special Editions' were again released on DVD in 2004 with even more changes but were no longer called 'Special Editions' but just 'The Star Wars Trilogy' even though they were not the Original Theatrical versions of the films as they were seen when first released in the theaters. At that time many fans began to become concerned that the Original Theatrical versions of the films were not released on DVD as well. In 2006 Lucasfilm released a 'Star Wars Limited Edition' DVD set which included the original theatrical versions as 'bonus discs'. However, the original version 'bonus' discs were of very poor quality and were from the masters used to produce the laserdisc releases of Star Wars a decade earlier and not the masters used to produce the 'Special Edition' versions of the films. Furthermore, the Original Theatrical versions of films were presented in a letterbox format rather than the current standard anamorphic presentation which further reduced the image quality. By the way, the 'Limited Edition Star Wars Trilogy' DVD set which is the only one that contains the Original Theatrical versions of all three films has now been discontinued at the same time as the release of this Blu-ray set. Is this a coincidence, or a concerted effort by Lucasfilm to subvert the original theatrical versions of Star Wars?

The Blu-ray set being offered here adds further changes to the ones already seen in the 'Special Edition' releases. These current changes compounded with the changes we have already seen over the past decade continue to significantly alter the films from their original theatrical release form. These continual changes along with Lucasfilm's refusal to release the Original Theatrical versions of the films in high quality on a modern video format such as Blu-ray amounts to a systematic erasure of the culturally and historically significant Original Theatrical versions of the films Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.

Ironically, in 1988 George Lucas himself stood before Congress and gave a speech against altering significant historical and classic films:

'A copyright is held in trust by its owner until it ultimately reverts to public domain. American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history.

People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as ""when life begins"" or ""when it should be appropriately terminated,"" but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.' - George Lucas

Mr. Lucas, if you want to change your films then please do so, but not at the expense of letting the Original 'Classic' and 'Historically Significant' Theatrical versions of the Star Wars films being forever lost.

Imagine if 'Citizen Kane' was permanently colorized, or the lines from Casablanca's famous ending changed, or the 'Maltese Falcon' re-edited ... really, please think about if THAT happened. Well, THAT is what is happening to 'Star Wars'.

Given the current rate at which the Original Trilogy is being altered, what will the films we know as 'Star Wars', 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi' look like in 10 - 20 years from now ? Do you care about cultural and cinematic history? If you do then please make an informed decision.

I thank you for your time.",1315785600,50,4757,4.957340025094103

7221268,1,B00YI71PN2,"Back to 1978, when I borrowed a friend's beta VCR to copy a video-tape of ""Star Wars"".* Home video was in it's infancy, but who knew that in over 30 years the original film that was nominated for 10 Academy Awards including Best Picture, would no longer be available to the public? Aside from older dvd and VHS releases.

That exclusion is the reason that this is the one & ONLY time I plan to ever write a review before the product's release. (Although, only Sith deals in absolutes.)

I recently bought Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"". He included the theatrical/international/director's & final cut on the dvd set. Same with JC's ""Aliens"" and SS's ""E.T."". As I recall my ""Wizard of Oz"", ""The Color Purple"", ""Rocky Horror"", ""Roger Rabbit"" and ""Beetlejuice"" have all survived well on my dvd shelf (AND in the public's hearts) without needing poorly ""tinkered"" versions.

Almost no one would've begrudged Lucas some cosmetic touch-ups 'here and there' to smooth out some old effects shots. But of course, another great talent named Michael Jackson just started off with a few minor changes. Now I see their careers heading dowsn a strangely similar path.

This Blu-Ray package, minus the first theatrical versions, combined with public statements, cements the fact that he has virtually dis-owned the films that he, and countless talented craftsmen, like John Dykstra, Rick Baker, Phil Tippett, Dennis Muren, & even Frank Oz and John Williams (to name a few) so carefully crafted. Hey, did he cut John Ratzenberger out of ""Empire Strikes Back"" because he was that ""Cheers"" guy? ;)

Bottom line: The filmmaker dis-owns the magic he made and people fell in love with, he dis-owns those fans who supported him. It's sad.

The reason I am buying this set is so that my Son can enjoy these movies with me--regardless of how they have been changed.

At this point Lucas may as well make Alderaan shoot first at the Death Star.

UPDATE:

Since writing this, the whole deal with Disney buying the rights to Star Wars happened. Thankfully they wrestled the rights to Star Wars away from Lucas before he put Hayden Christensen into an old man mask and redid the scene at the end of Jedi where Anikan Skywalker takes his helmet off and sees Luke with his own eyes. That would have completed Lucas' vision to erase Sebastian Shaw from history.

Now that Disney owns the right, lets hope they do the right thing! Put the original theatrical releases on Blu Ray! I'm absolutely certain that would help in recouping that $4 billion investment cost paid for the Star Wars franchise. I have money. I want to give it to you for this. Help me Disney. You're my only hope!

7221277,5,B00YI71PN2,"It's that easy to recommend this set. My original ""review"" is below. Well, like most of the ""reviews"" on here it wasn't actually a review, it was a criticism of decisions made by these films' creator and a wholly-unfair rating based on prejudices, but I threw in my two cents and affected this INCREDIBLE set's rating just as they did.

All controversy aside, this is the best addition to my BD collection since I started collecting 19 months ago (maybe the Alien Anthology beats it). The movies themselves look BRILLIANT (aside from some issues that pop up here and there, but we're not necessarily looking for ""reference"" quality we're looking for EXTREME WATCHABILITY), the sound is absolutely FANTASTIC and there are more special features than I can go through in a month. Well, it'd take a lot less time were I not living in a world of such HORRIBLE distractions, such as a JOB and a WIFE (and football!!) but everything I've seen so far makes me happy. It's probably due to the fact that my home theater set up is the best I've been able to experience since I saw these movies in the theaters, a lot better than I used to watch the DVDs on, but with a decent-sized HDTV and even a passable 5.1 surround system you'll know firsthand how great this COMPLETE SAGA is. It demolishes the visual and audio quality of the DVD set in every imaginable way, and is most definitely well worth the upgrade if you love these films as much as I do, or just love films in general.

I'm just so happy I want as many people as possible to watch these so we can talk about em! There's a lot of changes, a LOT less so than those made for the special editions in '97 and the original DVD release in 2004, but they're all in a package that's so much more fantastically put together I don't look forward to ever having to give up this set.

Star Wars is such an integral part of our popular culture, and it will certainly outlive naysayers and bandwagoning Lucas negativists. We can be as particular as we like, but when that supplants the sheer joy and innocence of experiencing fun movies like these, hasn't the point been lost?

Highly recommended!

7221278,2,B00YI71PN2,"What can I say, it's Starwars. The new films do look nice in HD and the soundtrack is awesome as usual. I love the new effects as Han is defrosted from his Carbonite prison especially. But as usual with most of the times it's been released (LIke C3PO saying Do take good care of yourself to Artoo and the AND sounding really wrong) there's a problem with some of the audio. Please bear with me I'm not one to moan, I normally just sit back and accept things, but here goes.

*Rant mode engaged*

Having read all the reviews I am tempted to send Return of the Jedi back to Lucas with a note reading *Please remove Vader's NO! and send it back to me* The first one I mean, as it's as bad as if someone passed wind during a funeral. I can live with the second NO as it doesn't sound as badly dubbed.

I wouldn't mind but the guy who did it should be ashamed, it is totally off pitch. Which kiss A** people did Lucas get to sit through this? It certainly wasn't any of us fans. Seems that he is trying to alienate us older fans so he can hook in the younger audience, most of whome don't seem to mind the new additions. It seems all this was hidden and covered up from the fans, while Lucas stood on stage with his grinning face showing off the deleted scenes, like a magician keeping the audiences attention on him.

When all's said and done, I forsee Lucas will go down in history as the biggest scammer and con artist ever, because you can bet when he changes the Vader bit back due to fan outrage, he will make us pay for it again. Either that or he will ignore us while he sits on a pile of money that would make Scrooge McDuck happy.

That said I say we need a petition. Lucas should change the ending of Jedi and then we return the blu ray and get the new version without Vader shouting NO! Because I am scarily getting used to it!!!!! How could Lucasfilm make such a blatant sound error as this? They are the ones that gave us THX and changed the way films are today, yet they can add in a sound that sounds like a 1st year undergraduate added it, and then expect us to not moan when we want our money back?

Heck even Simon Pegg agrees with us!

There got that off my chest. I have bought the Blu Rays and will watch them. I just wish Lucasfilm would put two versions on the discs like most other film companies. One that is the special edition and one that is his vision (Directors Cut), instead of being such greedy pigs. I have heard people saying, it's Lucas' vision he can do what he wants. But would you buy a painting and then let the artist come in the house and paint I RULE on it? Just because he thinks it looks better.

Still all said and done I would say don't buy them but I know that's not going to happen, as Lucas has turned the films into a drug.

People under the age of 18 won't notice any changes however, as they might not have seen the originals. So they are more likely to buy them.",1315785600,9,2911,4.101933216168717

But no, in keeping with the character he most resembles, Jabba the Hut, Lucas looks to gouge his fans for another $80.00.

Not from me George. The only one of these movies I genuinely enjoy watching these days is the first, now fourth or fifth, who knows? I have it on DVD and don't need the minor improvements that Blu-Ray would bring. In fact I think that will merely highlight how lame it appears compared to today's CGI aided films.

I wish you had some friends in your life that did as well.

You deserve better than this.  You are a legend.  You made fricking STAR WARS!!!!  I went to the drive-in every weekend when I was a kid to watch this movie.  The day it came out on HBO, I watched it right up until my Mom made me go to school.  The best Christmas I ever had was when we went to the movies to see THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.

What happened?

What did I do to make you mad at me?

I was Star Wars when Star Wars was still considered geeky.  I suffered ridicule and shame because I was a sci-fi kid.  Now everyone loves sci-fi.  I thought I could finally put those painful years of shame behind me.  But now this.  I feel that shame and ridicule all over again.  But not from the kids who thought I was a geek.  I'm feeling that from you.  Please, give me back Star Wars.

I will pay double,

no triple,

the asking price of this box set for a cleaned up original version.

I promise.

Ewoks and all.

Just fix it.

I promise I'll never bring this up in an argument.

While it seems clear some reviewers have somehow gotten to see it before release, I'm surprised how no one has mentioned anything about the Blue-Ray disc quality. After all folks it's a  1080p movie set! Sure, there are the mistakes of adding unnecessary new dialogue such as Vader's ""Nooooooo"" sequence and the said CGI rocks hiding R2 but these things are surely small potatoes compared to the hours of untouched stuff in these films! I'm really looking forward to seeing the battle sequence from the opening of Episode III in HD! Even on DVD on an HD TV with upscaling, this sequence looks amazing!  Hayden Christensen puts in a far more convincing performance in Sith than in his previous outing in Attack Of The Clones and Lucas's story is at least a little more airtight, especially at the end of the movie! Having seen most of the incarnations of the Star Wars saga, I'm anticipating a pristine HD version. to see it in more detail on a large HD TV is an exciting prospect and I'm sure, everyone has known for ever that these movies were made just for this format!",1315699200,8,1188,4.599056603773585

Months later, when I found out the original, unaltered versions would not be included, I did not immediately cancel.  Disappointing, sure, but not unexpected after all.  I still had my 2008 non-anamorphic widescreen DVD versions which I bought for $22 on Amazon a year ago (sorry, now apparently OOP).  I still really wanted to see the films in 1080p.

When I saw video of Vader bellowing ""NOOOOOOOOO"" when he throws the Emperor at the end of RotJ, then saw confirmation it was really real, I cancelled my pre-order immediately.  At this point I'm half disgusted and half amused by the way Star Wars has been treated on home video.  They know exactly how the die-hard fans are going to react.  This is an intentional ""Screw You"", and frankly it's hilarious.  Doing this over and over again and watching the fan's heads explode every time, it really is pretty humorous, isn't it?

I'm not even mad.  I know in my lifetime, maybe not until after George Lucas dies (thank God I am much younger than him), but someday I will own a pristine, high definition copy of the original trilogy with Han shooting first, no Jabba in Mos Eisley, no Ghost of Young Anakin Skywalker, no Vader yelling ""NOOOOOOOOO"", no corny CGI creatures bouncing around every establishing shot, no New Emperor face, no blinking Ewoks, etc.  It will happen when they have completely exhausted the fan-base and wrung every possible dollar they can get out of re-releases in the latest format that are just shy of what we really want.  It has to happen and it will happen.  That's just Capitalism, folks!

So don't get mad, just save your money and wait it out.  The sooner sales dry up the sooner we will get what we really want.  If you keep buying just because it's Star Wars and ""oh, well it's good enough"", it will just take longer.  I can wait and so can you.",1315699200,40,1908,4.594674556213017

George Lucas is lazy, and he is a hack revisionist. He doesn't know when to leave well enough alone, and move on to new projects. I am convinced his success with the early trilogy was as much due to the effort of his wife Marcia, an expert editor and one who understood the importance of character, as well as Gary Kurtz, the producer who kept Lucas reigned in, and who offered critical input. With no oversight and external input, George makes technically excellent, but storytelling deficient movies. The prequels are a complete joke, gaudy with all the pointlessly overdone elements, over-the-top characters, and stilted dialogue.
If this set had contained REAL remasters of the original versions of the original 3 movies, I would not mind the revisionist nonsense and I would have purchased this set.
However:
People are being asked to pay $90 for a product that has myriad technical flaws, things that should have been corrected regardless of what movie it is. These are a distraction and shoddy workmanship.
Also, changes are continually being made to the substance of the movies without offering the originals. Many movies get doctored by their directors. But when this is done, it should be and usually is done concurrently with a careful restoration and release of the original version in the best possible quality. But in this case it's not.
AVOID this. If you keep paying Lucas to butcher the movies and bury the original movies we grew up on, we won't recognize them after a while, and he will not stop. I can't believe I ever idolized Lucas. I don't now. With each release of the Star Wars movies, he destroys a little more of our childhood memories.",1315699200,25,1907,4.7993920972644375

There's really no excuse, there has been more than enough time to put together a complete package for blu-ray.  All we are asking for is new state-of-the-art 8k resolution transfers, and also the original versions that everyone grew up watching.

If we were to look back at his career, the films that made him billions, the films that guranteed his place in cultural history were films that were NOT his complete vision. They were the product of a team of people with their own thoughts, their own views and their own input that made the original trilogy what they were...Cinematic history. The most obvious validation to this point are the Prequels. They are, without a doubt, unwatchable. I could not even bare to watch the fan re-edits. They are so terrible that it is best to ignore them outright or see them as an alternate universe, an alternate origin story. Oh and George Lucas had FULL control of those three films, no wonder he obssess over them and is willing to butcher the originals. And he goes beyond that...he donwright refuses to release the originals in the new format, that sounds like hate to me, hate of a product he was not in full control of.

I was so excited when I heard the original trilogy was coming out on blu ray, I was going to accept the '97 version...but not now. Not with yet another revision, the bastardization of an iconic scene. That's enough for me, there is no need to revise my experience of the films.

I for one, will not waste my money on this hate-filled revision, this bastardization of a classic film.

Good luck with purchase!

Although I agree that these are George Lucas films & he has the right to make changes as he desires, I as a Star Wars fan & a movies collector cannot come to terms why he does not at the very least provide the original theatrical releases as well as these new edition releases on this STAR WARS Complete Saga Blu Ray Edition, why not give the consumer the choice, why not give your fans the option of either old or new versions, even the price has again been further reduced from $89.99 to $79.99 to help push & market this product. Most other Blu Ray movies has several editions & add ons that can be viewed either as the original version or the extended version on one blu ray disc. This is unacceptable in these times of economical distress & technological advances. Thanks to the easy access of knowledge via the internet, the consumer can research a product extensively before coughing up money to buy it. I will always remain a Star Wars fan, but I won't put up with this blatant disregard for the consumer, how many more version would come to pass before the originals are offered up in highest definition available to the consumer today, that is BLURAY.... As for this version, its a NO-WAY from me!
Latest Video Clips that suppose to be the alleged changes in the bluray edition:

2. Obi-Wan's Krayt Dragon Call from Star Wars_ Episode IV - A New Hope

5. CGI Yoda in Star Wars_ Episode I - The Phantom Menace

7221337,1,B00YI71PN2,"This was supposed to be THE blu-ray set of the year. I pre-ordered this in January and was getting very excited about this release, even if it would've had the 2004 version, which I was fine with that. 9 Discs, containing 6 films and 3 bonus discs, for 80 dollars (used to be 90)?  What a deal!

Of course, this was before footage of the new Blu-ray was shown on Youtube.  Obi-Wan's new Dragon call, the zoom-in shot of Jabba's Door in ROTJ, and finally, the worst change of all... Darth Vader now saying ""NO"" in the climax of ROTJ.
And yes... these are real.  Confirmed by Lucasfilm themselves...

Let me say this: these changes are just awful and unnecessary.
The latter change is probably the biggest insult to the original trilogy... WORSE than ""Greedo Shoots First"".  How can he do this to the climax of ROTJ?  It was perfect to begin with, so why change something that was never broken?!

Of course, the Original versions are not included. (I actually thought they wouldn't be released at first like they did for the DVD.  Is Seamless Branching too much for you, George?

And to further add insult to this set, Episode 1 might have changed Yoda to CGI, but Episodes 2 and 3 are not altered (10/8/11: It's been brought to my attention that there are actually a few changes made to Episodes 2 and 3).  ... are you telling me that George wants the Original Trilogy to be like the Prequels?  ... It can't be true, it can't be!  Why would he do this to our childhoods?!

This fiasco gave me the final decision to cancel the pre-order and boycott this release.  Anyone who buys this will be part of the Dark Side... which is Lucasfilm.  THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS MUST NOT BE ERASED FROM HISTORY.  WE WANT WHAT WE DEMAND, LUCAS!  I'm not paying any future Star Wars media until the Originals are presented... remastered on a Blu-ray format.  You can include the new versions however you please, but you'll make more money if you release the originals bundled.

UPDATE 10/8/11: OK... after this whole fiasco, I stopped complaining about this set... what else is there to complain about?
Thankfully, I don't have this set, but from observations presented on the net, if there's one change that will be the worst change of all, it's Darth Vader saying ""NO!"" in Return/Jedi.  Now, for the record, it's a bit (that's saying something) better than the ""NO"" in Revenge/Sith, but it's been done horribly.
1) The timing was off. The ""No"" should've ended before the shot when we see him lifting the emperor.
2) He doesn't sound like the usual Vader.

As for the changes, I can live without (or just shut up about that).",1315612800,91,2604,4.566810344827586
7221338,1,B00YI71PN2,"I was ecstatic when a friend told me months ago about these finally making it to BD format. This set and the LOTR are what made me finally make the leap from DVD to Blu-Ray.

However, after seeing the (preview of) the craptacular change Lucas did by adding the wussified ""NOOOOOOOOOO"" as Vader throws his former mentor down the shaft, I can't help wondering who REALLY got the shaft? Palpatine or the fans like me who shuddered when we witnessed this act of wanton butchery of (IMO) THE BEST scene in the entire movie!

Needless to say, Georgie boy, you will not get another thin dime from me until you restore that scene to it's original. I wouldn't even take a FREE copy of this!

I've met and spoken with Dave Prowse many times and I shared with him that this was my favorite scene. It NEEDED no dialogue! When Vader looks from Palpy to Luke and hoists The Emporer and the Jedi theme swells in the background...but now....Lucas, you just jumped the Frickin' shark!!!!!

7221346,1,B00YI71PN2,"I have long debated the original film faithfuls for not embarrassing the mostly positive changes in the updated versions of the original trilogy.  I grew up mostly on the special editions as they were in films when I was young.  I then smoothly went into the new trilogy and loved them as well.  Star Wars rang true for me as a Spiritual and Political Allegory.  So, the new trilogy exploring how someone good can become evil worked will for me.  Also, showing how a republic can fall into a dictatorship was a perfect way to show what is happening to America in modern times.  It also shows how good people sometimes do bad things, thinking that they are doing the rights things for what they feel are the right reasons.

I never understood why the Han shooting first thing was such a big deal.  It's how Lucas story boarded it, from what I hear, so it was part of Lucas getting back to his original vision.  I liked the space battles more and like many CGI characters more than many of the puppet characters that, as Lucas has pointed out, never really worked.  Puppet Yoda was awesome; but the pit of carkoon looks better with a beak.

But that's what this all was supposed to be about, right?  Lucas showing us his original vision.  Han shooting first being changed was the second only real change in from the original that impacts storyline; Luke shouting as he falls in Empire is another.  I also saw nothing bad with adding Naboo to the end scene.  I liked the new music and end scene in Jedi better than the original; as it felt more complete.

My first real offense was the new Anakin in Jedi's ending for DVD.  Where is the old dude that looked so fatherly a loving from the original films and the original special editions?  He's gone, and now we have Hayden Christensen.  Who, truly, I liked in the new trilogy; but doesn't belong in the original.

But this, this is obscene.  Vader shouting No!?!  It made sense in Revenge of the Sith.  He just realized his wife was dead.  It was supposed to be a nod to Frankenstein, I think, and really do think fans were overeating.  But here, in Jedi, it makes no sense at all!  It's there just to try to tie Vader to his Episode 3 self.  Which, I felt worked well subtly.  If the leaked youtube clip really is the voice, it sounds awful!  And yes, New York Times does confirm that Vader does say No.  I thought it was a cruel joke from some Youtube poster making a point about the changes and seeing if people would think it was real.

I don't foresee myself buying these anytime soon.  Please explain to us, Lucas, how this addition in any way lands in the category of fulfilling your original vision?  This is just a blatant attempt to make the two trilogies appear more cohesive. Which, unlike many fans, I did feel they were cohesive already.

For the future, I don't just want original versions.  I think they deserve to be in there for the fans that love them and for film history.  But I don't just want them; I also want the 90s special editions that I feel are better than both the new version and the originals.  Vader shouting No is just awful.  What were you thinking Lucas?

7221356,1,B00YI71PN2,"To those who are supportive of this release and disdainful of people like myself who are complaining about it: There are two main problems people have with this Blu-Ray release.

1) People are being asked to pay $90 for a product that has myriad technical flaws, things that should have been corrected regardless of what movie it is. These are a distraction and shoddy workmanship.

2) Changes are continually being made to the substance of the movies without offering the originals. Many movies get doctored by their directors. But when this is done, it should be and usually is done concurrently with a careful restoration and release of the original version in the best possible quality. But in this case it's not.

The owner of SaveStarWars.com makes an excellent point about this:

""...none of this would be an issue if the originals--and the previous special editions, for those now crossing over--were available in high definition. We could just shake our heads at Lucas when we thought he made a stupid decision, say ""well, I wouldn't have done that,"" and then watched the version we liked, whether it was the original theatrical version, or the 1997 version, or the ones from 2004 and 2011. It wouldn't matter if we liked a change or not, or which version was ""right"", we could just agree to disagree and be happy with the version that Lucas gave us that spoke to us the most. The way every other film with multiple versions--Blade Runner, Alien, Lord of the Rings, Close Encounters, etc--has been treated.

""Lucas is so narcissistic about suppressing the older and original versions of the films, as though they no longer exist, that he has brought the heat on himself. And, unfortunately, he has opened up a lot of rifts in the fan community that really should not exist in the first place. We all love Star Wars, but it has so many versions, sequels and permutations that it is inevitable that we all never agree on one single, absolute Gospel canon the way Lucas wants: there's too much radical variation. The only way things will be good is if we can each have the one we fell in love with, because we all fell in love with different variations at different years for different reasons. When you create something as big as Star Wars, you sort of have an ethical mandate to do this, to protect a cultural artifact and make sure it is seen and treated with respect. As Lucas himself said: ""American works of art belong to the public; they are part of our cultural history."" I hope one day Lucas can drink his own medicine so we can all just get along.""

Some 5-star reviewers have pointed out that when one starts focusing on the minute details of something it's hard to concurrently enjoy it. True indeed, and yes, the point of a movie is to 'get lost' in it and to 'enjoy the story'--and that actually is a reason not to change something that is already beloved the world over. When changes are made to a story you already love so much and know very well, these changes hinder you from getting lost in it or enjoying it as much, because they surprise you.

One reviewer wrote: ""I just love to watch movies for their stories, sure effects are great, but seriously, a movie like Star Wars can get by on just a great story."" I agree, and that's why I fell in love with them too: the story. And I am pretty sure that's why all the so-called nitpicking ""nerds"" love Star Wars too -- why else would the original trilogy stand the test of time even though its special effects are quite lacking by today's standards? Why else would little kids seeing the originals today still fall in love with them despite their outdatedness? I wish George Lucas would have remembered that the story and the characters are what people care about more than the special effects; then maybe he wouldn't have felt the need to change the story or add more special effects.

The main defense of the Blu-Ray release is that Lucas can do whatever he wants because they are ""his"" movies. Lucas himself takes this view. But Lucas didn't write or direct two thirds of the original trilogy, so to call it ""his"" is literally inaccurate even though, because of our flawed copyright laws, it's legally accurate. But beyond the question of whether he can is the question of whether he should. Lucas himself has spoken out vehemently in the past against tampering with classic movies:

""People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be ""replaced"" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten. Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself."" -George Lucas's 1988 speech to the U.S. Congress

Later he revised his view to exempt himself from his own ethical standards:

""It's my classic. On the one hand, I'm doing this, while on the other hand I'm on the Artists Rights Board, a foundation that's trying to protect films from being changed--which I feel very strongly about, because with the technology we have today, anybody can go back and do this kind of thing. I can sort of see the future, and I want to protect films as they are and as they should be. I don't want to see them colorized, I don't want to see their formats changed, I don't want to see them re-edited, and I don't want to see what I'm able to do now, which is add more characters and do all kinds of things that nobody even contemplated before."" -George Lucas, 1996

And his view now? When Lucas was asked why no originals, he purportedly rolled his eyes and said, ""Grow up. These are my movies, not yours.""

Some people have the impression that the desire to preserve original films is unreasonable and/or just a weak peep from a small minority of over-the-hill geeks, but it's the stance taken by the AFI, the National Film Registry (which Lucas had a big hand in creating), the Film Foundation (Lucas is on the Board of Directors) and the Library of Congress. It is a widely recognized principle and one that Lucas is a huge supporter of, even, so he says, in regard to Star Wars. ""Lucas, a proponent of film preservation, has said recently that he would like to restore the originals but can't pay for it, even though he is a billionaire. Yet when an outside organization from the federal government bodies of film preservation [the National Film Registry] offer to foot the bill in the meantime, what does Lucas do? Try to get them to take the Special Edition,"" which the NFR refused to do. So it's not just a closet idea... and clearly money is not the true reason Lucas doesn't want the originals released.

The fact that Lucas continually makes changes to the Star Wars movies while not preserving the originals for viewing, frankly is reprehensible (and hypocritical) both as an artist and as a businessman... regardless of whether one feels the movie was actually 'improved upon.' What would the reaction be if the Tower of Pisa were straightened, or Mona Lisa's face touched up to smile a little more, or Mickey was given brown fur, or countless other famous and beloved historical icons were tampered with beyond mere maintenance, either by their creators or by others? Star Wars was nominated for 11 Academy Awards in 1977 and won 7 of them, and the Star Wars saga is beloved the world over. As the most successful film series in all of film history, Star Wars is a historical treasure and global icon that should be treated with the same respect that it and those who love it deserve.

P.S. For a wonderful song about it which sums up all these reasons in a brilliant way, look up ""Thanksgiving"" by Paul and Storm. And there is an excellent blog post on this by Andy Wilson called ""Why I (Reluctantly) Cancelled My Pre-order of the Star Wars Blu-rays."" Well worth reading.

P.P.S. If you're a fan of this set, great! I'm glad you like it! In fact, I'm envious! Before you leave angry insulting comments about me or my review, please remember that I have the right to my opinion just as you have yours, and I'm writing my review for the benefit of those who may share my tastes.

UPDATE - I have now viewed The Empire Strikes Back from this set (the only one whose changes don't bug the tar out of me). And my reaction in regards to the audio/video quality was ""Meh."" We also watched Harmy's High-Def Fan Edit of A New Hope and the sound and video quality were just as good as this official release, even to my picky audio professional husband.",1315526400,133,8945,4.593984962406015

With as much space as we have on a blu ray disc, for George Lucas not to include all versions in hi def is just stupid. I am finally sick of the bull crap that we have all done through. He use to be one of my favorite people in film history, now he has become infamous. I will not buy a blu ray set until it contains all versions of the movie in 1 set.",1315526400,31,449,3.6391752577319587
7221358,5,B00YI71PN2,"I have read so many negative comments about this blu-ray. Most of these comments seem to complain about lightsaber color??? Who cares! For god sakes, just watch the movie. The story has stayed the same since 1977. Sure they added a few more effects here and there, but who cares?! I fell in love with the story of Star Wars not the CGI aspects of it. It's a space opera, the music is epic, and the characters are fantastic, it's a whole new galaxy brought to life! If you fell in love with star wars because of the effects, like lightsaber color or how many rocks R2-D2 hid behind on Tatooine, then you are a nerd. I just love to watch movies for their stories, sure effects are great, but seriously, a movie like Star Wars can get by on just a great story.

All in all, I'd say buy this if you love Star Wars. I think it looks great on my HD TV. The colors are vibrant and it just all looks ""warm"" if that makes sense. The sound is great too. I'm very pleased with this. If you are a big Star Wars nerd then this is NOT for you, but if you juts love to watch Star Wars and just love blu-rays in general, then by all means, buy this blu-ray!

Hopefully I will see the next three films in my life but if not hopefully George Lucas will have died off by then and a more qualified person will have taken over the project for the next three films. The only reasonable explanation is before Lucas started writing the Prequels was that he has caught syphilis and it has been slowly destroying his brain.,1315526400,21,1057,4.425641025641026

Lucas has now officially gotten me to the point where I will NOT buy his recycled crap anymore and when the 3D versions come out, I will not be in line waiting to see them.

7221364,1,B00YI71PN2,"Let me preface this by saying that I am a fully functional, capable, well adjusted adult with a well paying job, family, friends, hobbies and interests in the world outside of Star Wars. It is amazing that people are still spouting off ""Get a life!"" when it comes to fans voicing their concerns over something they love being treated with such disdain by it's own creator. What ""Get a life!"" really means when someone says it is ""i'm better than you, my beliefs and values on what is important are more important than yours, please stop talking because I can't stand it when someone doesn't agree with me."" Please. It's unoriginal, lame and lazy.

Now, on to this set. I will not be buying this. It has already been well documented by people that ACTUALLY HAVE THIS SET (sorry, had to capitalize to make sure it was read by the ADD generation) that it is a poor release. Extra material aside, pretty much all the ""technical corrections"" Lucasfilm did were to select shots. The color timing is STILL incorrect from the 2004 dvd release. Not to mention the Vader ""nooo"", Greedo shooting first, Krayt Dragon call sounding like some guy getting his testicles smashed with a hammer, etc. And to the crux of 99% of the outcry, the original versions are *still* not included. In a format such as blu-ray, with multiple other boxsets out there that have been done and done well with including multiple versions of a film, why, oh why, does George Lucas completely insist on not including the Original Trilogy on blu-ray? All he'd have to do is make clean transfers from the original negatives, bolster the sound, and hopefully recomposite the opticals (while not changing a damn thing!) to make it look prettier for blu, and that's it. It'd be over.

Unfortunately, I will have to stay with my dvds. I cannot support Lucas and his ever changing ""vision"" to get the films to how he wants them, simply because he chooses to ignore the fans request to be able to choose the version they want to watch. It's completely asinine.",1315526400,33,2015,4.657303370786517

If his younger self were to meet him today, he would spit into his own face. Apparently, he has spent so much time exploring the Dark Side of the Force, he never noticed when he himself switched over to it.

A real disappointment, and a true dirty shame. At this point, there is no rational - or moral - reason, absolutely NO justification for not including the original, wide screen (but possibly restored/cleaned up) version of the original trilogy on these disks. I have bought every crappy edition of these movies since they first came out on DVD; NO MORE. Mr. Lucas, you have had enough of my money by now; I will not spend more on your quest for travesty and corruption.

On a related note, why don't you insert some 'much-needed' CGI Jawas into 'Casablanca' or 'Citizen Kane' instead? How about putting some CGI into 'Godfather' and 'On the Waterfront', if you are at it already? SURELY those movies would benefit from your 'brilliant' insight...",1315526400,27,1136,4.732323232323233

7221372,5,B00YI71PN2,"I have been a huge fan of Star Wars since I saw Star Wars Episode IV in 1977 at age 15. I sat through it 5 time in the opening week! Since I have seen it well over 200 times! I have also bought EVERY VERSION ever released on video including: VHS Dolby Stereo, VHS Hifi, Laserdisc CX Stereo, Laserdisc Digital WS, Laserdisc THX WS, Laserdisc Special Edition (SE) THX WS, DVD SE Boxed set. So buying the movies over 7 times is no big deal! Honestly, each was an improvement over the last. I also have NO PROBLEM with the 1997 Special Edition release and subsequent changes over the releases. Let's face it, special effects of the 1970's were cheesy at best when compared to CGI of the last 15 years. Many errors could be seen in the matting in almost every scene. Adding the CGI not only enhanced the films, it brought a whole new audience an appreciation for the wonder that is Star Wars. If I were to show the ""Theatrical Release"" of Episode IV to my grandsons after I show them Episode I-III, they would laugh at how cheesy it was.

Lucas is a TRUE ARTIST! He was never satisfied with the original films. As a matter of fact, the reason he stared in the middle of the story (Episode IV) was he knew he could never show the vast complexity of the Robot Armies of the of the Trading Guilds, Clone Wars as he had envisioned them with the special effects of that time. That is why he started the story at a point where the effects of the time could achieve reasonable results. He had to develop Digital Motion Control photography to make the ships move as he had envisioned it. He always knew that the technology of special effects would improve. He hated how fake the puppets looked in the bar scene, Yoda in Episode V, Jabba the Hut and Rancor in Episode VI. This is why he went back and redid all three original films before he started the prequels. The prequels are very close to what he wanted ALL the films to look like. I am happy now I can show my grandsons all 6 movies in chronological order in 1080p on my 65"" set in 7.1 Dolby TrueHD!

By wanting the original works of the movies on Blu-ray you are essentially being a hypocrite. You say Lucas shouldn't revise his master pieces, but on the other hand you want his original works to be changed into HD on Blu-ray? So many overrating hypocrites, you people are people being ridiculous.

Oh, and by the way it is his Saga of movies and he can do whatever he wants with it. You people have no right telling him what he is doing is wrong when you would not even have Star Wars if it weren't for him.

7221375,2,B00YI71PN2,"They promised fixes as in a Blade Runner type restoration. This is certainly not what we wanted as Star Wars fans. Nothing is really fixed but a couple obvious things and from frame to frame the same mistakes wobble in and out as if the quality control fell asleep after they started what they were supposed to do. So many things still wrong. From 70s models and monitors, garbage mattes, wonky lightsabers (yes, they fixed some bad ones), and atrocious CGI to new mistakes like leaving out rocks they just painted in a scene before! Good Lord. Lucas is the king of hacks. Anybody but this man needs to helm the restoration of these films.

I am all for updating work and correcting older works as in what they did with Blade Runner. But these films are simply being given the once through and done. They barely even spend time on making them cohesive and updated for a new generation of viewers. You need to go frame by frame and analyze what needs to be done. A plethora of inconsistencies still exist.

You also need to throw a couple hundred million at it Mr. Lucas. Stop with this half-baked restoration process. What Lucas is doing is the bare minimum, and we all know the man has zero taste. He never listens to fans who have categorically gone over every mistake and every other thing that looks out of place. The next thing you do is release the old films AS IS, without any corrections, just as they did in the Blade Runner set.

This man is an egomaniac. Do not support this set if you care. Wait until native 4K to see if they clean up anything more. They really just need to take one long look at ALL of these films and then go in correcting everything step by step. The CGI in the prequels already looks dated and terrible today, and it makes the films look even worse than the originals! This whole set needs about 200 million pumped into it at this point to even resemble a modern sci-fi epic, which is what this idiot obviously wants. He just doesn't have the brains to get it done.

All the fans ask it that we have the option to see the version we fell in love with. To me it's like seeing a once beautiful actress, who was beautiful even with the flaws, have a bunch of plastic surgery to look younger, but instead of just aging gracefully, she now looks like some horrible pantomime of herself. That is exactly how these special editions feel to me, and frankly until the theatrical versions are available, Lucas can't have one red cent of my money.

7221377,1,B00YI71PN2,"The biggest thing against this release is that it has no original theatrical version. Those classic, historical, culture-defining original films have essentially been surpressed from history because of one man--George Lucas'--desire that they not be seen. This release contains does not contain the version that won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, nor does it contain the Oscar winning original audio and editing. This is a shame, and a travesty. Those films NEED to be restored and presented in high quality, and it wouldn't be much work to do so when stuff like Police Academy and Fast Times At Ridgemont High are available in HD from 35mm material.

But anyway, okay this is Special Edition only, maybe I can stomach that for the sake of seeing Star Wars in high def. But they can't even present the Special Edition in acceptable ways! I'm not talking about the ""creative changes."" I'm talking about the video and audio. Yes, the films are very sharp and very clean looking, as they were in the 2004 version. That is one star I will give this set for. Lowry labs did a good job at getting rid of the dirt and blemishes and giving the films the clean look Lucas wanted. But the colours are all messed up! Luke STILL has a green sabre in Star Wars and Vader still has a pink sabre in Empire Strikes Back. They did fix two sabre shots, but thats it--unfortunately, entire scenes were miscoloured. The blockade runner is still a cool blue shade, there is still weird tints, the blacks are crushed, starfields are erased, and lazers and such lack vibrancy. All the problems of 2004 are still there. Lazy, lazy, lazy. Is it really so hard to make the films look right? See this page: [...] for how the BD still looks bad.

I could give some points to the extra features, but they are lacking too! If you average it out, it's less than a single extra disc per film. Don't you think Star Wars and Empire sort of deserve at least a disc of extras each? For that matter, don't you think they deserve maybe two each? Instead, we get a 90 minute feature length documentary on the 501st cosplay charity (nothing against them--this just should have been 30 minutes). The other documentaries are fluffy and useless too, except the vintage ones which are at least interesting to see. The model archives are okay, and the deleted scenes are good to watch, although they left out a ton of deleted material that I know still exists.

In short, I like the idea of watching the Special Editions in high-def, but this isn't worth your money. Mediocre extras, bad presentation, more IDIOTIC changes like Vader going ""NOOooooo!"" in Return of the Jedi and no restored original theatrical versions of the original films.

For those reviewers that stated that Lucas destroyed or ruined their childhood, you honestly need a life if you're based your childhood on a film.  If George Lucas wanted to completely tweak the films beyond recognization..., at the end of the day, HE HAS TO LIVE WITH THAT DECISION and who are you to critize him for it.  If only people had this much passion and outrage over stuff that really mattered..., like hunger in our country, or the homeless, or hate crimes, then this world would be an entirely different place than what it is now.",1315526400,10,1031,4.321243523316062

He's simply acting, on his own, to re capture a lost glory, and slightly modifying details a bit to continue to keep him self excited about the act.  Sorry George, I've grown up.

All I've wanted from you all these years, is a continuation of the story.  You tried, with Ep 1,2 and 3...  Delivering the most absurdly written and poorly orchestrated examples of film making this side of how they script COPS (yes, the reality TV show).

And then after that, you're just re-editing, and re-editing, and trying to capture something that wasn't perfect to begin with, which means you'll never obtain perfection with it.

While I agree that the ""Nooo!"" scene in Jedi is kinda silly, it's not a deal breaker for me.  Most of the changes he has made over the years have improved the series IMO.  I like the Mos Eisley scenes a lot more, making the marketplace more crowded, etc.  Of course Greedo shooting first is still silly, but at least they have cut down on the timing so that it looks like Greedo gets a shot in at the same time.  The insertion of Christenson at the end of Jedi is aces in my book and thank God they replaced TPM Yoda with the CG one.  The O.T. Yoda is perfect, but the newer puppet was terrible.  Did anyone complain when they replaced the English text on the Death Star tractor beam?  How about when George put 'Episode IV A New Hope"" above the crawl in the movie known then as simply ""Star Wars""?

My father took me to see all the original trilogy films during the initial runs and I was proud to return the favor with the prequels.  We also went to the special editions when they were released, and were looking forward to the 3D versions which we will not get to see together due to his passing away.  When we would watch each newer version it was fun to look for the changes and point them out to each other.  We both loved Star Wars as ideas AND as movies.

I guess I fail to see why people are so enraged.  I can understand a little bit but overall they are still Star Wars, and that is enough for me.  At this point, I don't think I could watch the unedited ones the same way.  Go back to the cardboard Dewback? Vader's eyebrows? No one-armed Wampa? No, thanks.  I will say that it would have been nice to include the O.G. movies just for reference and to shut the complainers up.  Although where does it stop?  What about the kids that only saw the ones from 1997, and want THOSE versions because they are the ones they grew up with?  How about the people that only saw the DVD versions?

In the end, I am still super excited to buy these versions and can't wait to dive into the extras discs.  And I'll wager that 99% of the reviewers that ""cancelled"" their pre-orders still buy the set inside of 6 months.",1315526400,12,2199,4.161137440758294

I am now going to say sorry to Frank Oz and all his efforts in Star Wars movies at this time.  Other than Frank Oz's voice, George Lucas feels that a CGI version of Yoda is better through all the movies in this classic series.  I am at a loss for words, to destroy the vision of some of the greatest movies ever made in motion picture history is a very disheartening thing.

If tarnishing the memory of Yoda is not enough; changing the color of the light-sabers makes me not want to every see the Blu-ray release of Star Wars.  It may be too late to make some changes that may appear in some distant conference room at the Skywalker Ranch.  I fear that these changes will be so devastating to Star Wars Fans.  That the current Star Wars's Fans will also become a thing of history.

I'm actually shocked by the amount of people that are that upset with this especially the ones that now have a ruined childhood because of it. In the grand scheme of life, it doesn't bother me as much but really, people should be used to it by now. I mean Lucas was changing things as he made the movies to begin with. First Luke and Leia are kissing then in RotJ their brother and sister. In ANH Vader and Anakin were at first 2 seperate people then in ESB, he decided to make them one in the same. I understand that when he filmed A New Hope, he wasn't sure if he would be able to film the 2 others but nonetheless, he changed things to make a better overall story when he could.

Does Return of the Jedi need Vader to say ""Nooooo"" or even Hayden at the end?  I don't think so, but I was more annoyed by Greedo having to shoot first than this. That's a big change, IMO. I understand that people are tired of Lucas' tweekings but the ""Noooo""doesn't change the story at all. Either does the Ewoks blinking or a Dug walking through Jabba's Palace. I understand the changes because I personally feel that Lucas is trying to blend the PT and the OT together better to be more fluid. I grew up with the OT but I also like the PT. The problem is that people want the sacred OT to stand alone away from the PT.That's not what Lucas wants...obviously.  He wants the PT and the OT to be one overall story.

For those of us who grew up with the original Star Wars movies, and loved all the little details as much as the epic saga and larger than life characters, the last few decades have been torture.  They have actually been physically painful, to the point that I, who once owned a Boba Fett helmet and a scale Millenium Falcon replica, cannot bring myself to introduce the films to my children.  The problem is that George Lucas knows all we want is the original theatrical releases in a permanent, high quality format, and once we have them we will stop buying them or otherwise pay attention to his crazy alternate ""official"" versions.  So he will never give them to us, and instead keeps trying to foist off repackaged updates on an innocent public.

At the same time, Mr. Lucas long ago forgot what it was that made the original films so great, if indeed he ever understood it at all.  Everyone has a breaking point when it comes to his changes.  For me, it was continuity-wrecking madness such as midichlorians and noxious genetic pre-requisites to become a Jedi, Lord Vader actually being a slave (?!) on Tatooine and burying his mother outside Luke's house (where her grave disappears), and actually cutting and pasting Hayden Christensen into the ending of Return of the Jedi instead of the grandfatherly and deeply satisfying image of Luke's real father we'd lived with for 20 years.  I still can't believe some of these things actually happened.

For others, it may be Ewok eyelids, or weird-colored lightsabers, or inserted CGI creatures flailing away, or something else that just seems so horribly wrong that it shakes your faith that whoever made the change had any idea what they were doing.  For years, I listened to the (few) devotees of the Prequels try to defend all of Lucas's changes to the original films as ""improvements"" or ""updates"" or the like, secure in their knowledge that he would never ever change the Prequels they loved, since he had all the time and money and technology in the world to get those right the first time.  Well, guess what -- welcome to Revision Town, population You.  Those prequels are going under the knife for real this time, and it is just starting.  Like a 60-something Hollywood actress who has to start getting more and more plastic surgery to fix the earlier plastic surgery that turned out to be a bad idea, not only will Lucas not stop changing things, the pace is actually speeding up.  These films are well on their way towards being just as grotesque, frightening, and unrecognizable as those plastic surgery addicts.

This raises the ultimate question:  why buy this blu-ray set at all?  It is your money, and you can spend it as you please.  However, it is wholly naive to think that what you buy today will be the same ""official"" version of the films that exists in Lucas's head and the ILM hard drives even the following morning, let alone years from now.  You are buying products that are, simply put, much inferior to the originals, and that have built in expiration dates keyed to whenever Mr. Lucas needs more money.  Next time, will the Millenium Falcon be polka-dotted, and Princess Leia a bearded lady with a dubbed baritone?  Who knows.  Over the years, we've all thought ""there's no way he'd go that far,"" and then suddenly Lord Vader is wearing 6-inch Battlefield Earth boots because the actor is too short, or he ends up strangling Amidala after going to the Dark Side out of fear Amidala would die.  We lost all adherence to reason and rationality long ago.  The only control the long suffering fans have is over our pocket books, and it is time at last to exercise it.

So please, take more than a few moments to get over yourselves and actually review the item for what it is. George Lucas trying to perfect (to his vision) of what he wanted to do with Star Wars when he first had a chance years and years ago. Ewok's not blinking. You're going to get mad over that?

7221450,1,B00YI71PN2,"I've enjoyed the Star Wars films since I was a child. I grew up watching the original trilogy more times than I can remember. Star Wars is more than just a series of films. Its an experience. Countless awards, nominations, and honours have been given to these films. When Lucasfilm announced the definitive release of Star Wars, images of the Blade Runner, or the Alien Quadrilogy Blu ray releases come to mind. A fully restored, remastered set, full of the special features that fans crave. Multiple versions of the film(s) so viewers can watch each version, compare them, and find which they enjoy more. A definitive collection in every sense.

Sadly this set is not that. The 2004 DVD releases had many issues. Issues that made the changes seen in the 1997 releases even worse. Fans lament these changes for many reasons. In addition to these changes the remastering process left many new issues in the films. Colours were off or flat out wrong, effects were messed up due to the changes implemented. Changing the movies to fit a directors cut isn't the issue, the issue is keeping the original version available. Something that George Lucas not only fails to do, but he is actually trying to keep the Original releases from seeing the light of day.

The Bluray release of Star Wars comes with a slew of new unneeded changes. These changes are even infuriating non-hardcore Star Wars fans. Among them is the now famous ""Noooooooooo"" heard around the internet. The subtlety of the films have now, by and large been lost, which is a real shame. The remastering process has also created issues with the colouring, yet again. Lightsabre colours are still not correct. Digital additions of CGI create continuity errors that were not there previously. Lucasfilm stated that they went over the entire saga and did a frame by frame restoration. Instead we got blanket colour correction and audio tweaks that hurt key scenes in the films. Only select shots have had actual frame by frame restoration. The remastering process effort seemed to be more focused in adding a digital Yoda (a Change that I don't really mind), and digital Ewok eyes. Audio changes sound horrible and pasted over the existing track which is a real shame considering that Skywalker Sound is the go to for quality sound mastering.

The real tragedy here isn't the changes; its the absolute lack of original versions for these movies. As George Lucas himself so adamantly fought against the colouring and restoration of Black and White films, we now have to fight against the once crusader to try to save the original Star Wars movies from him. A true definitive edition would contain at the very least the Original Theatrical versions and George Lucas' re-imagining. But preferably every version (like 'em or hate 'em). The only way to show Lucasfilm our distaste for these ""Remastered"" versions is to exercise the most powerful tool that we as consumers have. Choice.

I have cancelled my pre-order for the set. It is not the product that was described or originally offered to me. I will not give George Lucas more money for this set because he will be encouraged to keep making more changes and since people keep buying them he has no incentive to stop. I hope that more people will cancel their pre-orders, and not purchase this set. Only through these actions can film-makers see that its the public that truly has the power, and hopefully they will then begin to listen to the people that they once a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away used to make films for.

The fact is that the changes made to the films over the years are changes that their creator wanted made.  They are his movies, and he has the right to change them if he see's fit.  While I am more in Spielberg's camp (he has said that there will be no digital tinkering with any more of his films) if Lucas wants to make changes, it is his right as an artist.  Frankly, I really liked the improved special effects in the original trilogy, effects that he would have used originally if he had the money and the technology.  I don't like that Han doesn't shoot first, but really, I don't stay up nights worrying about it either.  I have an actual life, so, you know, that's what I concentrate on.

7221455,1,B00YI71PN2,"This box set is a major disappointment in so many ways.

First, Lucas never even announced the changes. I would have been very angry and shocked as I sat and watched these films, never even aware that this is NOT the set I had intended to purchase. It amazes me that he would put these out without any details concerning the changes. It's bad enough that I had to buy the Special Editions. Thank God it was leaked on the internet before the release.

Second, it is expected that these type of major releases be all inclusive. Every major box set have included all versions of the films, including the original theatrical release (except Lord of The Rings - which angered those fans). Avator - 3 versions, Apocalypse Now - 2 versions, Blade Runner - 5 versions, Terminator 2 - 2 versions, Aliens - 2 versions of each film.

Third, you really have to ask what is wrong with Lucas. After all, Star Wars original theatrical releases made him a billionaire. His fans responded to them and made him a billionaire. The original versions obviously elicit a strong emotional response to them. Quite simply he is denying his fans on purpose. He really is just slapping them in the face. What's worse is he doesn't care at all. What harm would there be in releasing the original cuts? He really is being stubborn and his reasoning is absurd. There isn't a single studio or director who acts this way. No movie in history has ""disappeared"" only be to replaced again and again with different versions each time. It's important to understand that Star Wars isn't just a movie. It's a world wide cultural phenomenon that was influential in dozens of areas. To erase it is to erase history.

Fourth, at this point we don't know how many changes there are. There could be even bigger, worse changes than what we are aware of. I've read that Yoda has been replaced by CGI in Empire and Jedi. Also, there is some speculation that the transfer itself may not be as good as expected. In any case, I want a full review of the films.

Fifth, yes, I suppose he can make as many changes as he wants; he owns the films; it's his vison. It doesn't mean he should or that it's right. He himself spoke to Congress on this very issue. It's all over the internet now. He WAS very much against going into classic films and altering them and changing the original vision of the director (it should be pointed out that he did NOT direct Empire or Jedi). Just ask yourself how you would feel if any classics that you liked were altered - Ten Commandments, Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia, It's A Wonderful Life, Willy Wonka and many others.

Sadly for the fans, for the next generation, for historians, and for professors of film, religion and psychology the original versions will be gone.",1315267200,50,2790,4.536779324055666

I'm not going to allow 5 seconds to ruin 40 hours of bonus features, and all 6 films in 1080p. I'll get used to it, just like a got used to all of the other changes in previous releases.

I will be the millionth one to say this, but why would anyone in their right mind shell out this much money for a lackluster collection that's virtually the exact same as the error-ridden DVDs?

We don't need a dug in Jabba's palace. We don't need these extra things. We want the real issues addressed. And if that's too much to ask, then for Christ's sake, don't address ANYTHING.

Which brings me to my biggest complaint. Noooooooooooooooo, not the blinking ewoks. How dare George Lucas call this a perfect cut of the films, leave so many errors uncorrected, and then go on to completely ravage one of the few good things about Return of the Jedi. Vader's redemption has been destroyed and disrespected by the tacky, misplaced, and overemphasized ""Nooooooooooo"" from Revenge. I cannot fathom what goes on in George Lucas's head that makes him think it is okay to alter THE defining Star Wars moment. No words.

In short, this collection literally offers nothing. The documentaries can usually be ordered seperately on amazon. The deleted scenes will find their way to you, eventually. Do not waste your money on this piece of work.",1315267200,39,1547,4.919540229885057

7221460,5,B00YI71PN2,"Update on 9/29/2012 to my original review below:

Finally got around to seeing it. Put off seeing it because I worried that perhaps the negative reviews were true. Was I in for a pleasant surprise! Lucas didn't let us down. It is everything I hoped for. Outstanding clarity and color. Good execution of Blu-ray on my high-res display. Spectacular sound quality on my Bose stereo system. Specifics given in the extensive and excellent five star reviews said it all, and I'm at a loss to add anything there! It's all true about this being an outstanding box set, down to the fine quality packaging with bound book containing DVDs that is easily accessible. Lucas spared no expense.

Original pre-release review unedited:

AMAZON's policy of allowing reviews prior to a product's release means nobody who reviewed this Blu-ray edition of STAR WARS: The Complete Saga is basing their comments on actually buying, receiving, and viewing the product.

If I had never seen these reviews, and suspected the rating was skewed due to people ""reviewing"" these DVDs prior to actually viewing them, I would want to know the following information to do my own calculation on the REAL review ratings based on actual *buyers* after the product was released! Although this will incite anger in those hoping to keep you from buying a product they have never themselves purchased and viewed, I'm going to post this anyway. So those who want to diss me, have at at! :)

By the way, the basis of my 5-star rating is simple. Amazon allows reviews prior to a product's release. A review can be any rating one wishes. People are taking advantage of this fact. Therefore, I'm going to take the ""all's fair in love and war"" approach and provide statistics as of Tuesday, September 6, 2011 (which ratings skyrocketed over the Labor Day weekend), to help legitimate future buyers calculate the REAL ratings based on some baseline:

Amazon Ratings As of September 6, 2011:
817 Reviews
5 star:  (168)
4 star:  (27)
3 star:  (28)
2 star:  (33)
1 star:  (561)

Keep in mind, this product has not been release, yet has the above ratings. Anyone with the average number of human brain cells should be able to see how real future ratings are being obfuscated.

I know, I know, if this gets posted like the other 817 pre-release ""reviews"" above, at least 561 people are going to be furious at me. No matter what you say I'm NOT a Lucas employee trying to defend the motherland, lol!",1315267200,12,2459,4.7552941176470584

Here they are in the worst quality available.  Isn't that what you wanted?""  No, it isn't.  Lucasfilm, take a good, long look at the 5-disc Blade Runner Blu-Ray for how a landmark film with multiple cuts should be released.

Can't wait, bring it on.
I have done my research about what changes remain, what they added, and even what they didn't and let me tell you I may not be extremely happy about it, but its not as bad as the one star review guys are making it out to be. All of the CGI that was added to the original now does not look quite as out of place as it did on DVD as well as that NOOOOOOOOOOO they are all talking about being blaspheme, even though I do find it unnecessary, it does not ruin the scene. Honestly I might not have caught it had i not been listening for it. These changes are at the film makers discretion and if you are complaining about, and think that George Lucas, Creator of the epic Star Wars Galaxy and Co-Creator of Indiana Jones, will ever stop pushing the boundaries of technological advancement, which just for your information is how he created Star Wars in the first place, then just stop being a lucas fan and please stop tearing down these works of art!

We want the original, unaltered theatrical cut of Star Wars! we want it despite its aging, despite it's now evident flaws, but also with the great effects, quotes, and music, scenes that made us dream!!!

I cannot understand what George Lucas is making with his classic movies. Maybe he needs to keep some of his companies working, otherwise it does not make sense at all.

Making all these senseless changes is something not acceptable. Please take them back.

I don't mind what he does with his recent trilogy because I did not like it at all, but I really mind when someone messes with classic movies, and when he does not give us the chance to watch them the way they were meant to be watched. The way they were shown at the theaters for the first time. The way we love them.

I can only quote what George Lucas himself said, not so long ago, in this very same world....

""People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society.

In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be ""replaced"" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.

Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.""

They are a separate class of customer for this product and seem to have written 90% of the reviews as they have an enormous amount of negative energy regarding seemingly insignificant issues compared to the vast majority of the interested population.

The primary experience of watching Star Wars is included in this set. The emotions I experienced watching the trilogy in the 70s and 80s as a teenager and young adult are the same. The same goes for the Prequal movies made and released much later. The only real differences being the picture is clearer Blu-Ray quality and the sound has been upgraded. No more, no less. The subtle differences appreciated by extremely serious Star Wars fans just do not matter to the vast majority of fans.

I view the overall poor rating of 2 stars for this set as absurd. It lacks the common sense most people have. I mean lets be honest. Star Wars is truly a motion picture phenomenon. For most people who love Star Wars the opportunity to purchase and enjoy this amazing collection of movies with upgrades in picture and sound is appreciated. I regard it as a welcome addition to my Blu-Ray collection.

Why not just watch the unaltered DVD's and be happy? And don't complain about picture quality, because in 1977 Star Wars was shown on grainy projectors.

You people seem to be forgetting that George is not remaking a bunch of old movies, he is making, as he has explained countless times to deaf ears, a 12 hour epic. It would be simply impossible for him to make three prequels without making some changes to the originals. For example, if Lucas did not include a Dug in Jabba's palace, you might be forced to wonder where all the prequel aliens went. Lucas is creating symmetry and continuity between the six movies. This is the reason for the dreaded ""Noooooooo""; it's a filmmakers technique for alluding to an earlier point in the saga. Also, where are all the ""purists"" when it comes to improvements to the OT; why does nobody complain about the removal of the Emperor's old lady/baboon face in ESB? Or the added shots of the Millennium Falcon taking off from Mos Eisley? Or the added X-Wings on the attack on the Death Star? There are just as many good changes as bad ones, IMO, and the new changes just make the six movies work together better.

Vader saying Noooooo... erked me.  My brain tried to justify him speaking, but in  the end it said NOOOOO!!! (in my opinion) it seriously takes away from the scene that we all know. Vader hadn't spoken in over 25 years why have him speak now? Actions speak louder than words. Obi-Wan's yell  does not need to be there at all.

People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society.""

In his dark, empty home theater, he is watching and rewatching the original three films which effectively are his iron lung.  Instead of marveling in the ingenuity and charm which drew in hordes of fans, he racks his mind over what else he can possibly alter, because at this point, it is hard for many to imagine there could be anything else.  But not for him.  In the words of one of the gungan general in the midst of war, he challenges himself: ""Mesa tink of something.""

Along with all the magic and splendor, being a Star Wars fan comes with its fair share of ridicule and mockery.  It has always been an amusing exercise in persuasion, if not defending one's artistic convictions, to declare loyalty to the franchise which defined childhoods and transcended well into adulthood.  But with each new, unnecessary and context/tone-warping alteration deemed important by its creator, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep up with the defenses.  So much so that self-defense against attacks of mockery for still standing by such a highly panned and parodied series gives way to self-ridicule, which allows no means of further defense.

Clearly, he has reached the point of no return in terms of lunacy and there is no telling what is liable to be victimized by his devolving mind next.  Well, I ain't buyin'.",1315180800,33,1477,4.825396825396825

7221502,1,B00YI71PN2,"***EDIT***
Ok, fine I bought the 6 movie set (used). The things that looked awful on YouTube still are. Star Wars (A New Hope) and Jedi suffer the most.

The new HD transfer really reveals how badly done Jar Jar is in the Phantom Menace. He looks like an ""in-progress"" shot of an effect that will be added later. It's especially bad on Naboo. None of the bizarre ""there's an entire city under this medium sized lake"" stuff was fixed. Yoda looks MUCH better.

Attack of the Clones is still terrible.

Revenge of the Sith looks amazing. The acting still lets the movie down until the last half.

For all the movies the sound and picture quality is really very good. A New Hope seems most improved in that regard. Jedi and Revenge of the Sith have the best picture quality of the 6. All the movies have sound the was reworked considerably. Most of the changes are for the better.

Having Said all of that. The needless and poorly executed changes to the movie really spoil what would have been an amazing set. Why waste so much time and effort looping in bad dialog or adding rocks that vanish for no reason? Most of the simple FX changes/upgrades work, and have since Lucas first started all this ""tinkering"". None of the story changes have worked. Han shot first because he was a pirate and a smuggler. That's why his transformation into a hero was so powerful. He wasn't mean, but he wasn't above shooting a guy either. The Jabba the Hutt we meet in Jedi is a ""Vile Gangster"". The Jabba Lucas shoehorned into that unused scene in A new Hope is a guy you can literally step on. Now Darth Vader has been diminished just a bit because Lucas didn't trust the power of the original scene.

Tinker with the films all you want George, just don't make them worse. Also, why not allow people to watch the unaltered versions -- they are classic pieces of cinematic history.

7221506,1,B00YI71PN2,"It has been clear since 1997 that George Lucas views movies differently than many of his fans, including this reviewer.  Lucas sees films as inherently imperfect so they should be constantly updated and tinkered with.  I find it astounding that he considers all of his changes to be improvements though- no matter what you think about the changes, I don't see how anyone could like the new dance number in Jabba's palace!  But given the recent history of Star Wars, these new changes should not surprise anyone.  If you haven't heard, the two most objectionable changes are a ""NOOOO"" scream to the scene where Darth Vader kills the Emperor, and a new animal call to the scene where Obi-Wan Kenobi scares away the sand people.

I think Lucas's way of looking at movies is fundamentally flawed.  Movies are imperfect, but they will always be imperfect.  Even if you change special effects, they will eventually look outdated anyway.  Even the new ANH Jabba sequence had to be updated AGAIN in 2004 because the CGI started to look fake.  I like to view movies as a product of their time.  I don't mind continuity errors in casting choices or old special effects.  What George Lucas is doing goes against the ideals of film preservation and that is just one of the reasons I will not be buying this product.  But even if I accept Lucas's conception of movies, I can't help but think that most of the changes either aesthetically damage the movies or make no difference whatsoever- rendering them utterly pointless.  It goes without saying that I will not be purchasing this blu-ray release.  I am satisfied with the 2006 DVD release which has the original versions.

7221508,1,B00YI71PN2,"I grew up watching the original films in theaters, and remember the years in between, just waiting for the next episode.  The original trilogy quickly claimed the number one place on my list of all time favorite movies.  But they were more than that.  Some of my favorite memories of childhood involve Star Wars.  As the years have passed, and Lucas continues to tamper with them, the love I had for these films has faded.  The main reason for that would be that Lucas has so drastically changed the originals.  Each time these films are re-released, we find that he has again ""improved"" the films.  These improvements have been decried by long-time fans, and yet he continues to change the films.

I had held off pre-ordering this box set, and was just about ready to give in and order them, when I got an email about the latest confirmed changes to the original trilogy.  I went online and found the sight where I could preview these changes.  Replacing the puppet Yoda in Ep. 1 I think was actually a good thing.  The puppet used in that film just didn't equal the original Yoda.  The next clip I watched was where Vader now screams NOOOOOOOOO as he throws the Emperor over the railing.  I felt sick when I saw this.  First of all, the voice doesn't seem to be Vader's at all, and secondly, this really robs the scene of the emotional impact it had in the original.  When I first saw this in theaters, I remember wondering if Vader would choose the Emperor or his son.  I didn't need a lame scream from Vader to understand the emotional conflict he was feeling.

OK, now I would watch the clip that would just wipe any hopes of this release redeeming itself.  It's the iconic scene from Ep. 4 where we encounter Ben Kenobi for the first time.  Luke has been attacked by the Tusken Raiders, and they are looting his land speeder.  In the original, we hear an eery sound echoing in the valley, and then we see a shadowy figure coming towards the speeder.  We soon realize that this is Obi-Wan, and we realize that because of his powers, he was able to emulate this sound which frightened the Raiders.  The new scene shows Obi-Wan approaching just as in the original, except for one major difference.  Where once we were given a sound that would truly frighten someone away, there is now a sound that would cause someone to bend over in uncontrollable laughter.  Why would Lucas think this is an improvement?????  This one sound totally destroys the whole scene.

The final changes I've seen really don't seem to detract from the original.  The fact that we now are treated to blinking Ewoks actually does make the scene seem a little more natural.  However, I have to wonder why all this effort was put into making Ewoks blink when there are still some major problems that have not been addressed.

Lucas seems to have a major problem with letting these movies go.  I find it hard to understand why he seems intent on totally destroying these iconic films.  It really upsets me to watch what was such an integral part of my childhood slowly evolves into something that is barely even watchable anymore.  I feel that Lucas has no respect for his fans, and he continuously shows this by changing them even though he hears our cries from the sidelines screaming, ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!""  Unfortunately, our cries have gone unheard.  After watching these latest changes, I have finally decided that I have no desire whatsoever of watching these bastardizations of what was once a landmark trilogy.  And I certainly have no intentions of adding any money to Lucas' greedy pockets for this travesty.

7221509,1,B00YI71PN2,"First I want to say I have been a fan of Star Wars from the beginning, and being that I was born in 1977 Star Wars played a huge part of my childhood.  At four I was convinced I was Luke Skywalker.

In High School I watched the VHS copies so much I literally wore them out.

And now, reading about all the changes made to the original triology makes me feel like a huge part of my childhood has either died or that the Star Wars I loved was only a lie, due to the many changes made to an already great iconic movie.  I was excited about this release, and due to so many more which may seem minor changes I will not be buying.  Maybe on Ebay I can find the VHS versions...

The Fans have made it clear that the much loved orginal movies would be GREATLY appreciated.  Even if this new blu-ray editon had the orignal added with a higher price, I would be the first one at the store with money in hand.  But without that option, I will quit buying any new release of Star Wars that has, in my eyes, been perverted by greed, and not artistic expression.  True, the orginals were not perfect, but it was the imperfections that made the movies perfect!  Puppets were more real than that fake CGI crap that has become too common.  It was bad enough that Indiana Jones 4 has ruined a great iconic triology, but at least I can watch the orginial three with my mind at ease.  I am not given that choice with Star Wars.  and so, without even watching the new edition, and not even wanting to give this crap even one star....I feel like the force has left us.

Lucas, give the fans what they want.  Seriously, what was so wrong about the orginal three that you have stated yourself you will never release?  If they were that bad then why at every Scifi convention the Star Wars community is so huge, and not because of the new released triology but based on the orginal three.  It's not about CGI, Changes, and etc, it was about the innocence of the unaltered orginal movies that were so frickin incredible.  The new changes are just too distracting, and what I have seen with the new changes (AGAIN) is just too disturbing.  Like Michael Jackson (may he rest in peace) you can go one change too many, so many that it changes the original that we loved so much.

RIP Star Wars....until the orginal is released....I will now find the orginal VHS versions and transfer to DVD, that way I can enjoy them the way they were orginally intended, although  maybe not perfect in your eyes Lucas, to us the fans they were truly magic, and what you have done is literally too much for me to handle.",1315180800,15,2575,4.268041237113402

Star Wars: Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (2004)

As a fan of the original films, their absence is most strongly felt. They are historic elements of American and world pop culture, and I would very much like to see them in a state-of-the-art presentation. I would also like to see the 1997 Special Editions from time to time, just for nostalgia's sake. They are not as good and not nearly as important as the original films, but I saw them in the theaters and I would like to relive that experience. They are also interesting artifacts of 1990s CGI; who had ever seen 20-year-old live footage integrated with modern CGI before the Han-Jabba conversation? Although I haven't seen the 2004 versions, I am sure they have their fans. Many people must consider it ""their"" Star Wars Trilogy. Every one of these films, from 1977-2004, is important to someone, and should be included in any complete set.

You will not see these films in the Complete Saga. You will, instead, see new works assembled from pieces of the old and brand new elements. These new works include new directorial choices, sometimes made without the input of the actual directors; new actors; revised characterizations; new music and sound effects; and changes to the narrative. Most importantly, in my opinion, is a certain change made to Return of the Jedi. The pivotal argument in Jedi is a debate between Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi about the nature of Darth Vader (and, by extension, any person who does evil, all of us). In the 1980 and 1997 films, it is resolved one way; in the 2004 and 2011 films, it is resolved another. The original resolution, I think, is more mature and poignant. Other changes flatten character arcs, undercut dramatic beats, and introduce inappropriate slapstick humor. These derivative works published under the Star Wars name are not as good as the source material, which remains, sadly, unavailable in HD (or even DVD) quality.

(Admittedly, most of these changes predate the 2011 versions, but as the BD has carried them over, so I carry over my criticism.)

You also won't get the theatrical editions of the prequels in this set, or even the first home video version of The Phantom Menace. They weren't very good movies, and the changes are fairly minor, but I am sure there is a prequel fan somewhere waiting for a really complete version of the prequels.

On its merits, I am sure the films look amazing. I thought when the first prequel came out in DVD almost a decade ago, looked amazing. I thought the 2004 box set looked amazing. But like many others, I was surprised by the ch-ch-changes, which is why I am not jumping up and down for this set (in fact, I am more geeked over the Jurassic Park Blu Ray!)

What confuses me is this reluctance Darth Lucas has on releasing the films that people obviously want. I don't get it. Surly, if you add the original ORIGINAL trilogy/Christmas Special/and hell, the Ewoke Adventures for good measure - increase the set to say, $150+, people would buy it. I would buy it! And if Lucas wants to be money-hungry (as we all know and love him as!), he can throw in all the various versions of the films - add another 50 bucks, and get more money.

The idea is giving the consumer, and indeed, the fans - options. I am so glad many people have mentioned Spielberg, my childhood favorite. Both E.T. and Close Encounters include his farting around and the original. Now, take something like Blade Runner. There are MANY versions of that film, and luckily, you can obtain the various versions on DVD/Blu Ray.

The uproar seems to be shared. But life will go on, folks. I still got my '04 DVD set.  I am not either losing my sleep or holding my breath for a COMPLETE set, but it would be nice. And when that day occurs, it will be an instant purchase for me. I am sure I wouldn't be the only one either!

I'm writing this review to argue that this isn't the case. Before there was ever the ability to digitally alter any of the Star Wars films, George Lucas became a very rich man. Where did all this wealth come from? It came from the audience. As the audience we are the unofficial shareholders in LucasFilm LTD. As children we bought tickets to the films and bought toys to re-live the adventures we had seen. As adults we purchased many copies of the films for each format as it became avalible. With every dollar we told George Lucas that we loved these films and would continue to love them. At some point George Lucas turned on us. He stopped caring about what audience wanted and only paid attention to the money we gave him. He used the money to slowly destroy the films we all have loved since we were children. Enough is enough. I won't purchase another altered version of these beloved films just so that the money can fund the next version of the film that Lucas releases. Those original films weren't created in a bubble. They showcased the talents of hundreds of artists and film makers that set out to change the way science fiction films were made. George Lucas would be nothing without these people. I will no longer support the destruction of their contribution to one of the greatest film series of all time.

If you like Star Wars, you cannot accept the changes George Lucas has made and will continue to make in the future.  There needs to be a call to purity in these films, the original theatrical releases have to be preserved, and these alterations cannot be forgiven.  Anybody giving this 4 or 5 stars does not really care about Star Wars, and that is final.  My only hope is that George Lucas never touches the Star Wars Expanded Universe.  I care too much about the X-Wing, New Jedi Order, and Fate of the Jedi books to ever have George try to make a movie out of them or create an animated cartoon series so he can sell more merchandise.

My biggest regret is that kids growing up now do not understand the implications of what is happening here and they may grow up believing Star Wars is what George Lucas is presenting in these Blu-rays.  I am a big Star Wars fan, probably more of the Expanded Universe that follows Return of the Jedi than anything else, but we should still have enough respect to not mess with the originals that started it all.  On a side note, I wish Christians would get more outraged over all the hundreds of new versions of the Bible that remove or change the original KJV.  The NIV for example has over 64,000 less words than the KJV with entire verses actually missing.

7221532,1,B00YI71PN2,"The greatest indictment possible of Lucas's latest corruption of his life's work is best spoken by himself.

In 1985 George Lucas testified before Congress:

""My name is George Lucas. I am a writer, director, and producer of motion pictures and Chairman of the Board of Lucasfilm Ltd., a multi-faceted entertainment corporation.

I am not here today as a writer-director, or as a producer, or as the chairman of a corporation. I've come as a citizen of what I believe to be a great society that is in need of a moral anchor to help define and protect its intellectual and cultural heritage. It is not being protected.

The destruction of our film heritage, which is the focus of concern today, is only the tip of the iceberg. American law does not protect our painters, sculptors, recording artists, authors, or filmmakers from having their lifework distorted, and their reputation ruined. If something is not done now to clearly state the moral rights of artists, current and future technologies will alter, mutilate, and destroy for future generations the subtle human truths and highest human feeling that talented individuals within our society have created.

A copyright is held in trust by its owner until it ultimately reverts to public domain. American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history.

People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as ""when life begins"" or ""when it should be appropriately terminated,"" but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.

These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tomorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with ""fresher faces,"" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new ""original"" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires. The copyright holders, so far, have not been completely diligent in preserving the original negatives of films they control. In order to reconstruct old negatives, many archivists have had to go to Eastern bloc countries where American films have been better preserved.

In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be ""replaced"" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.

There is nothing to stop American films, records, books, and paintings from being sold to a foreign entity or egotistical gangsters and having them change our cultural heritage to suit their personal taste.

I accuse the companies and groups, who say that American law is sufficient, of misleading the Congress and the People for their own economic self-interest.

I accuse the corporations, who oppose the moral rights of the artist, of being dishonest and insensitive to American cultural heritage and of being interested only in their quarterly bottom line, and not in the long-term interest of the Nation.

The public's interest is ultimately dominant over all other interests. And the proof of that is that even a copyright law only permits the creators and their estate a limited amount of time to enjoy the economic fruits of that work.

There are those who say American law is sufficient. That's an outrage! It's not sufficient! If it were sufficient, why would I be here? Why would John Houston have been so studiously ignored when he protested the colorization of ""The Maltese Falcon?"" Why are films cut up and butchered?

Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.

I hope you have the courage to lead America in acknowledging the importance of American art to the human race, and accord the proper protection for the creators of that art--as it is accorded them in much of the rest of the world communities.""",1315094400,26,4695,4.917825537294564

The EpIV Greedo shooting first scene sucks.  At this point, all of these ""little"" changes are starting to add up.  Why should I spend money on a version I will like less than the last version I bought?

It's amazing how much disdain Lucas seems to have for his biggest fans.  At least when Spielberg altered ET, he put both versions in the set.

And the last straw:
I remember buying the original trilogy on DVD the day they came out.  Lucas said in interviews, he would never release the original versions on DVD.  And then a funny thing happened, the original versions WERE released on DVD.  And I had already forked over the cash for these altered ones.  I'm not going to get burned again.  I'll buy the movies on Blu-Ray when the originals are part of the set.

With that, I am extremely happy for those who will enjoy this Blu-ray set.  I envy you.  I envy you not only because you have an extra $90 to squander, but because you are going to enjoy this set for years to come (or at least until the next revision).  Unfortunately, I can't enjoy this set due to some creative choices regarding the films and, especially, the bonus materials.  I actually canceled my pre-order on May the 4th when all was revealed. It certainly was revealed to me and opened my eyes wide as a result.  I knew the lackluster bonus materials were only the tip of the iceberg.

As most people already know, Mr. Lucas and his employees have further altered the Star Wars films.  I am not going to go into detail regarding the changes as countless websites and almost every ""reviewer"" on Amazon has already pointed out the newest changes.  As mentioned before, I am not angry at anyone, just sad and disappointed.  See, I was very excited when this set was announced over a year ago. I own less than ten films on Blu-ray.  They are films that are worth the money to me and films I know I will watch repeatedly.  Star Wars is one of the movies I can watch forever and still get goose bumps.  However, I can't buy this set and still have a clear conscience because it will be money wasted.  To me, the only worthy feature of this set are the deleted scenes from the original Star Wars films.  However, I would only watch them once to whet my curiosity.  So, the deleted scenes aren't worth $90 to me.  Instead, when I canceled my pre-order on May the 4th, I donated the $90 I saved for this set to various charities in my area.  I felt much better doing that instead of buying this set.

7221546,1,B00YI71PN2,"I would like to start off by saying that George Lucas ""had"" three awesome films that I have loved since was at least 7 years old.  Looking back on those films all I have to say is why Lucas why.  Why did you take one of the best trilogies of all time and pollute them with prequel trash such as Attack of the Clones.  Seriously what were you thinking.  I mean sure the effects were good, but movies are not just about flashy effects.  Take episode three for example.  It had one of the best openings I have ever seen and the lightsaber fights were simply stunning.  However it takes more than effects to make a great movie.  Moving on to your first special edition release in 1997.  I enjoyed them.  The changes were minor and did not change the pace of the films.  Then in 2004 you made yet another special edition.  The lighting made it seem like Luke's lightsaber was green in A New Hope (when it is supposed to be his fathers and BLUE!!!!) and having Hayden in Return of the Jedi was not really needed at all.  Now in 2011 you have made another special edition.  The biggest change being the Nooooooooooooo! in Jedi.  Why o why.  It was the best scene in the trilogy.  The original scene where Vader has to choose between the dark side and the light side. What made that scene so bad ass to begin with was because Vader did not say anything. And it drove home the fact that Obi-Wan was right and that Vader had become more machine then man, and the scene showed the audience that the ""man"" in Vader was struggling to overcome the machine qualities within himself. In the scene, Vader looks at his son then looks back at the Emperor and then Vader finally chooses the path of a Jedi and throws the Emperor to his doomed fate down the exhaust shaft.  The other changes like the CGI rocks in the Krayt Dragon scene and the Krayt Dragon call were changes that I could deal with however the Krayt Dragon call really does sound like a kid hitting puberty.  The Ewoks I lids really did not need to be changed either.  This is why I say Why Lucas Why.",1315094400,8,2047,4.28125

Star Wars is such a cultural icon specifically because of the innovative film making techniques Lucas and his team developed in the late 70's. Destroying that accomplishment by replacing scenes with CGI, introducing politically correct concepts that were not part of culture when the original films came out only proves that Lucas has lost his ways.

It's very apparent LucasFilm does not listen to the fans that fund their own existence so it's only fair we don't buy this product. The blu-ray format allows for such a rich experience but unfortunately the creative genius of Lucas was not around to take advantage of it.

7221569,5,B00YI71PN2,"Star Wars: Episode I made me a fan of the Star Wars saga.  Yes, that reviled prequel.  I was 13 years old in 1999 when I first saw TPM.  That film made me conjure up VHS tapes of the '97 special edition original trilogy.  I watched them all (Greedo shooting first and all the other ""corrections"").  I was a teenager kid and didn't really know of these mistakes until much later.  I grew older and still love the entire saga of six films because it is one glourious story.  I matured and realized the flaws in the prequels (script issues, overdone cg in some cases, wooden acting, and the like).  However, I still stand, that as a whole, it is one beautiful tale about Anakin Skywalker's journey; from Episode I all the way to Return of the Jedi.  It is monumental piece of work in not only American film history, but the history of film itself.  BUT. BUT. BUT.  A line has to be drawn.  A huge, distinct line of knowing when to finish your work, when to stop ""tinkering"".  You cannot keep touching up a painting after it is up and framed in the Louvre.  Star Wars is already framed; it was done.  It is inducted into the AFI.  It is recognized as a cultural landmark.  I ask this question.  WHY DOES GOERGE LUCAS KEEP ALTERING THE MOVIES?  WHY?  I can live with the new changes (the eyelids on the Ewoks, Jabba's new giant door, even the Krayt dragon scream).  BUT, making Vader scream ""NOOOOO"" at the most pivotal scene of redemption in the Return of the Jedi took the cake.  That was the final straw.  That was it.  I cannot take it.  It became a farce.  The ""noooooooo"" was never okay in Revenge of the Sith, and it is not okay now.  It is cheesy and out of place; something that belongs in a comedy or better yet, a parody.  It does not let the viewer think.  It is handholding.  The viewer has no idea what Vader is going to do during that scene.  With the utterance of the ""NOOOOO"", now the viewer knows exactly that Vader was disapproving of Palpatine's torture to Luke.  I mean come on!  I cannot take this anymore.  I was going to buy this first day, first touch.  It is a sad and irreconcilable shame at this point.  Only a theatrical release of the original trilogy on Blu-ray can redeem George Lucas to not only me, but a whole legion of fans.
You cannot change art.  This work of art is George Lucas's. Yes.  But, he gave it to US.  He cannot give us a gorgeous piece and take it back.  I don't know if this is a blatant money grab to keep re-releasing these films, but Lucas is getting quite stale.  He can be a God among directors with only 6 films in his repertoire but he keeps spitting back at his patrons.  I don't get it.
Don't buy this.  That ""nooooooooooooo"" is the final nail in this coffin.  Yes, it is really that serious.  He never said ""NOOOOOOOOOOOO"" back in '83, he shouldn't say it now.  For crying out loud, I expect that kind of joke to be inside the Family Guy parody of Star Wars, not the original film itself.
This is a mess.

Sure, they might have fixed a couple SHOTS, but the color timing is still way off, Hoth is infested by blue snow, and lightsabers are inconsistent at best. For this reason alone, I wouldn't pay $90 for this set, but then we have even more needless tinkering by Lucas.

One of the pivotal moments of the entire saga is ruined by an idiotic dialog addition, Obi-wan's Krayt Dragon call now sounds laughable rather than intimidating, there are more rocks concealing R2 as he hides from the sand people, and there's a frakking Dug walking around Jabba's palace.

No, instead the most anticipated Bluray release ever since we all bought our Bluray players at 5am the day after Thanksgiving is not only going to deny fans the original theatrical cuts that we've all asked for, but also contains an even further ""enhanced"" version of the films. Yay! This is almost as welcome as the time my mom took all of my baby pictures and photoshopped in a bunch of other babies wearing cowboy hats; or when dad edited those Christmas home movies of us opening up gifts and finally digitally inserted a bunch of elves and replaced the Super Nintendo I was opening with the Mogwai I'd always wanted; or like the time George Lucas gratuitously made changes to Star Wars by adding eyelids to Ewoks and making Vader scream ""No"" in the same terrible way he did that made me cry in shame and disappointment when I saw Revenge of the Sith, oh wait...........it's exactly like that.

I can't understand why fans are denied access to a great, respectful Bluray or even DVD edition of the original theatrical cuts of the original trilogy when it is obvious that ever fan would buy them bundled with whatever crazy editions Lucas crammed in there to make it a super edition. I'm admittedly one of the biggest Star Wars nerds within shouting distance and I've cringed through the prequels, even tricking myself into thinking they were good for at one denial filled moment. I even had a blast when the special editions came out and I got to see Star Wars in 35mm even though I was forced to sit through that weird song in Jabba's palace; but this is just too far.

I love the original Star Wars trilogy, the three movies that need no back story, no corrections, no additional dialogue or extra aliens in the background. The movies that I grew up watching, the ones that made me pretend my bike was a speeder bike on Endor, the one that made me perfect lightsaber and blaster sounds effects so the playground would sound more official, the one that made me want to see a Rancor in real life, to hang out with Ewoks, to have Chewbacca beat up the bullies at school, the one that made my childhood and all of our childhoods what they were. The original Star Wars trilogy gets 5+ stars in my book, however this disrespectful money grab gets the lowest rating I can give.

Lucas, in 1988 testimony before Congress said:

People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society.
In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be ""replaced"" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.

The best thing about this blu ray release is the sound! The sound will blow you away!!

You get 4 cinematic masterpieces (A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and Revenge of the Sith)

The old trilogy looks great, even though there is a slight hint of grain whenever you see the sky. That must be the film stock though. A New Hope looks so good I gave away my limited edition theatrical version on DVD. Who gives a crap who shot who first, this HD is amazing!! Plus the Han/Greedo scene is improved and feels slightly more ruthless than the Special Edition on DVD.

I don't care about the changes. I like Vader saying ""No."" It makes sense because he has regained his humanity.

You get 2 fun and entertaining films (Phantom Menace, and Attack of the Clones)

Phantom Menace is the most improved film here, blowing the DVD transfer out the water and replacing the rubber looking Yoda with CGI Yoda, fixing continuity with the other prequels. I felt as if I was watching this film for the first time. Magical.

The bonus disc that covers the original trilogy is awesome.

However not all the deleted scenes have high replay value

one deleted scene from A New Hope is worth checking out and should have made the final cut, the Toshi Station scene. Great character development here!!!

one deleted scene from Empire Strikes Back is worth checking out and should have made the final cut, the scene showing Luke and Leia almost sharing a very deep and passionate kiss after he was rescued by Han. This scene would have made it a completely different movie!!!

Three deleted scenes from Return of the Jedi should have made the final cut, one showing Vader telepathically calling Luke as he creates his new light saber, the sand storm scene had good character development and shows Luke's wounded hand from rescuing Han, and a scene where Vader strangles an officer who says the Palpatine doesn't want to see anyone.

All the new overviews and interviews were great.

Bonus disc for Prequels is great too, EVEN THOUGH DELETED SCENES FROM DVD EDITION WERE NOT INCLUDED, SO HOLD ONTO YOUR BONUS DISCS!!!!!!!!!!!

New deleted scenes for Phantom Menace all sucked, completely worthless

Two new deleted scenes for Attack of the Clones were great, one dealing with Dooku's origin and another dealing with Anakin losing his memory of his mother. Should have been included in the final cut of film!!!!! Great character development!

One new deleted scene for Revenge of the Sith was great, dealing with Palaptine further seducing Anakin into the dark side. Should have been included in the final cut of film!!!!! Great character development!

All the new overviews and interviews for prequels were great.

Bonus disc with documentaries and spoofs was a mixed bag, especially if you own the awesome ""Empire of Dreams"" documentary from the dvd release. All the docs for the old trilogy didn't cover anything new that ""Empire of Dreams"" did and were boring. If you haven't seen Empire of Dreams you should, otherwise you might like these docs.

Spoofs was the best thing about this disc, freaking hilarious!!!

Star Wars Gadgets doc on technology was okay. i'd never watch it again.

documentary on the 501st was okay, i'd never watch it again

Empire strikes back 30 years later was the best Doc but not essential, it's hard to top Empire of Dreams in my eyes.

The only bad thing to this set is...

The case flat out SUCKS!! Don't like sliding my disc in and out of sleeves, even if blu rays are more scratch resistant, i don't care...

I used my old DVD cases and switched out the DVD's with the Blu rays. Feels more secure and guarantee to not get scratched!

So, this is a great set, just switch the cases with your dvd set and keep your bonus disc from the dvd's!!!

I wouldn't buy this set for the list price of $140.

Amazon price is okay, $80, but I got it for $70 used. If I were to put a value on it I'd say that's about right. 10 bucks each film and 5 for each bonus disc...",1315008000,2,4116,4.586065573770492

7221592,1,B00YI71PN2,"OK. I bought the silver-box widescreen DVD version of the original trilogy, which is a pretty good version if you can ignore the ""Han shot first"" edit. I was leaning toward buying the complete Blu-Ray set, until I found out about the looped-in ""Noooooo"" during the final Vader/Emperor scene in ROTJ, which I watched on YouTube. WTF! Is Lucas so thick that he cannot tell how wrong that decision was? Is he so deaf to the people around him and his inner creative voice that he has no consciousness of such idiocy?

It was pretty obvious that Lucas himself had jumped the shark artistically when Phantom Menace came out (ex: JarJar Binks - really?), and the final Vader scene in ROTS ""Nooooo"" was too hackneyed to be believed. I suppose Lucas is so incapable of depicting true emotion that he has to resort to lame exclamation. What a squandered opportunity to depict the birth a truly iconic character.

Don't even get me started on Crystal Skull.

The latest liberty with ROTJ is typical Lucas, screwing up a previously well-balanced scene by adding an unneeded and distracting voice-over, which deflates the tension like an ice-pick to a basketball. The best film in the franchise (Empire) was not even directed by Lucas and this is a prime example of why. Lucas should be restricted to the special-effects lab and allowed nowhere near the director's chair or editing room.

Lucas long ago demonstrated a nearly complete loss of creative integrity. His early vision was evidently corrupted by success, special-effects technology, and whoring after easy-money licensing deals (ex. Jar Jar Binks 3-Bean Salad, I kid you not). His contribution to the art is now limited to f******g around with his earlier work in ways that are completely unhelpful.

George needs to quit screwing around with these movies and find a new hobby. I will not be buying these on Blu-Ray in their present form.

Maybe Jim Cameron could send John Connor back in time to terminate Lucas in 1990 and hand the reins over to  one of the talented and hungry new directors like Christopher Nolan or J. J. Abrams. Imagine what we might have had.  :(",1315008000,8,2117,4.81267217630854

George Lucas is a visonary filmmaker.  All he's doing is show his vision of his films that he had all the way back in the 1970s.  This entire saga is like cooking, it needs some more spice in it.  It's like painting, it needs a couple of dabs painted on.

I'm somewhat of a fan who likes to see some little changes in films.  BTW, THAT'S the key word I can discribe with the changes in these films: little.  Not major, not big, not masive.  This isn't the 30th anniversary version of ""Night of the Living Dead"" for crying out loud.  It doesn't have an extra subplot made decades after the film was originally released, and it doesn't have a different film score.

Anyway, I'm A-Okay with the changes as long as it doesn't interfere with the most important thing in this entire saga: THE STORY.

I'm also okay with Vader screaming ""No"" as he's about to bring Palpatine to his end, and I completely understand why Lucas did it.  He lost his mother, he lost his wife, and he was about to lose his sone at the hands of this man whom he trusted since he was 10 years old.

I used to never care about the additions to the Special Editions in 97 and the DVD changes in 2004. After seeing Darth Vader howl NOoooo! when he chunks the Emperor down the shaft in Return of the Jedi, I decided to never buy another Star Wars release. This has to stop. I buy the movies for what I saw and loved in theaters as a kid. I put up with the changes made a few years ago but it just keeps changing and changing. What movies are we going to be watching in 20 years??? It is time to stop supporting these changes by buying everything Lucas puts in front of us. Only fans can make him stop. The problem is he makes millions with every little change he makes so he thinks the changes are welcomed be fans. Show George Lucas and Lucasfilm that they are wrong. DO NOT BUY!!!!

7221598,1,B00YI71PN2,"Back in the days of ancient Rome, when a conquering general would have his triumph through the city, a slave rode behind him whispering in his ear ""remember, you are only a man""...lest the event go to the hero's head and give him ideas above his station.  It was a good idea, and for the most part it seemed to work.  George Lucas needs the same thing...only his little follower should be screaming in his ear ""leave well enough alone.""

Every version of Star Wars gets altered every time he re-releases the films.  At first, his claim was that he made changes to the visual effects because he had been unable to make the movies look the way he originally intended because of technological limitations.  Most people could buy that, and the new effects for the so-called special editions were an improvement and pretty harmless.  Unfortunately, they also gave Lucas a taste for easy editing via CGI...and doing so was like giving an addict their first taste of crack.

He began altering dialouge, changing scenes and action, all the while claiming it was part of his ""definitive vision"" and how he intended the story to go all along.  Thing is, it's total bunk; he's not making changes because he couldn't have made back when he first produced the films, he's making the changes the way a kid with ADD colors in a coloring book; whatever idea pops in his head that he thinks will look or sound good, he does it, because with CGI he can.

Take his infamous ""Greedo shoots first"" change.  It not only ruins the character, it looks like garbage; the editing is on part with something someone would do for a Youtube video mash-up.  Or how about his replacement of Sebastian Shaw in the end of Return of the Jedi with Hayden Christiansan?  Not to wax philosophical about a fantasy movie, but it's a ruinous change becuase it invalidates the whole story.  See, when he appeared as a ghost lookinig like he died when he died, it meant Anakin had indeed ""returned"" as a Jedi...that he died as a good guy.  By changing it to how he looked as Hayden, it's supposed to imply that he's gone back to how he looked when he was last a Jedi.  But that would mean he DIDN'T die a Jedi at all...ruining the story and even the title.  And as with the Han and Greedo confrontation, it was shoddily done, simply replacing Shaw's head with Haydens, using footage taken from a costume screening.  The actor didn't even know it was being done, nor was he given a chance to actually ""act"" the scene.

The outcry from fans and critics alike about these changes should have been enough to convince anyone who wasn't totally self-absorbed that they were a mistake.  Enter George Lucas, who not only left these horrible changes in the latest blu-ray editions, he added more. More CGI creatures wandering around the screen, more egregious changes to dialogue, including what is surely the most awful change ever made to a movie...Darth Vader yelling ""no"" as the Emperor tortures his son.  What was an intense scene that left the viewers wondering what Vader would do has been reduced to a joke, all because Lucas suddenly realized that a key character always yells ""no"" in his other films...and needed to here, as well.  It's all part of that ""poetry"" line George keeps feeding us about his films.  There's no poetry to these movies anymore; they have become the cinematic version of ""Here I sit broken hearted"".

Bottom line?  If you want to see a good version of Star Wars, don't watch this one.  If he'd simply had the decency to include hte original versions on the disks it might have been okay, but he didn't even do that.  For a man who openly expresses concern about preserving our film heritage, he sure is a hypocrite for trying to bury the original versions of these wonderful stories.  Save your money...don't buy this garbage.  Just wait for the inevitable fan edits that will be out; they'll eliminate the more egregious changes, and the effects will probably look better, too.",1315008000,28,3960,4.642754662840746

This according to Lucas himself, in testimony before Congress in 1988, when he said...

""People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society.

""In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be ""replaced"" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.

""Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.""

(Read the entire testimony at savestarwars-dot-com.)

The original Star Wars films are cultural landmarks, and should be made available - not replaced by revisionist crap where Greedo shoots first, Vader screams ""NOOOOOOOOO!!!"" at his solemn moment of redemption, and then gets a creepy young Hayden Christensen ghost while Yoda and Obi-Wan have old ghosts, etc.

George, you probably should have called it quits years ago - hell, maybe have handed it off to a new team altogether.

You simply don't add dialogue to a key scene in a movie like this and expect everything to be hunky-dory with the fans.

George Lucas continues to tinker with his original trilogy and his changes are often distracting.  He has every right to alter his own movies, but that doesn't mean that you or I should support it by buying this inferior product.

Certainly the most controversial change in this set occurs at the end of Return of the Jedi, when the Emperor is shocking Luke and Darth Vader must decide between his son and the emperor (and the light side of the force v. the dark side).  Director Richard Marquand handled this scene with subtlety as the viewer has a clear understanding that Vader is starting to question his master, but the final act of saving Luke still happens suddenly and with terrific emotional pay-off.  In these Blu-Ray editions, Lucas has decided to add dialog for Darth Vader as he looks between his master and his son, having him say ""No...Noooooo!!!""  This ruins the subtlety of the moment as Vader's intentions are telegraphed to the viewer ahead of time and lead the viewer to wonder why the Emperor didn't hear him and do something to stop him.  Silly as this addition is, you have to wonder what Lucas could possibly have hoped to achieve with it.  The scene worked as it was for almost 30 years.

I am tired of Lucas tweaking these movies to the degree that these no longer feel like the ones that I watched over and over as a kid. For goodness sake, please leave Obi-Wan's krayt dragon call and the infamous ""Greedo shoots first"" scence alone. How many times now have they been tweaked?!?
And adding ""Noooooo!"" to the end of RotJ is just plain spiteful, given the negative reactions that Episode III faced when Vader's yell came across as just cheesy instead of heart-wrenching. We all get it. We know that Vader throws the Emperor over the edge because he disapproves of him trying to kill Luke. We don't need to hear him actually saying, ""No!"".
Plus, why do we feel that it is necessary to give Ewoks eyelids now, all of a sudden? Episode VI has been fine without them for over 25 years. I have never met a person who said, ""You know what? I would have loved Return of the Jedi had it not been for the fact that those pesky Ewoks never blinked! That's it. I'm out of here until they get those Ewoks blinking like they should!""

Now, granted, I think that the digital Yoda is kind of a good change, because that puppet always looked stupid to me, but I think I would rather have an unadulterated version of the movie rather than a tweaked version for nostalgic reasons.

Here's a novel idea: how about a version of each of the movies in HD with surround sound and vivid colors, and that's it! Leave well enough alone, and be satisfied with what you originally created!

7221649,1,B00YI71PN2,"George,

I appreciate your attempt to clean up matte lines, wonky lightsabers, and improve sound and picture quality in your Blu-ray release.

However, I don't understand why you want to make jarring changes to your characters that make once powerful cinematic moments now creepy or distracting.

A lot of people have made the case for Han shooting first (as in the theatrical cut) in Episode IV being a much more interesting and accurate characterization, so I'm not going to touch that.

This review is going to be principally about the changes you made to scenes with me in it.

For instance, in the original cut, when I throw Emperor Palpatine down the death star's reactor shaft, there is a moment of silent deliberation where, oscillating my expressionless masked face back and forth, I decide whether or not to sacrifice my life for the life of my son. The lack of dialogue allows the viewer to read more subtlety and indecisiveness into this act, and the silence is truer to my character's previous dialogue in films IV-VI.

In this release, you decided to have me scream ""NO! NOOOOO!"" at the very beginning of the scene, removing any of the subtlety or conflict, inserting a goofy, lamely comic line not befitting of my badassness, and consequently dulling the emotional significance of a father's redemptive sacrifice of his son.

What's worse, you replace Sebsastian Shaw's peaceful and redeemed ghostly image on endor with Hayden Christiansen's garish, creepy, pedefile-like smirk.

Not only does this not make any sense, because the last time I was alive (on the Light or the Dark side) I looked like Sebastian Shaw, and Obi-Wan and Yoda's ghosts look exactly as they did before they died... but again, Hayden's horrible acting and the visual unevenness of the three actors blunt what could have been a great, emotionally significant scene.

The scene starts great with Mark Hamill's excellent contemplative stare, coupled with peaceful acting from Sir Alec Guinness, but it ends with Hayden Christiansen's disgusting smirk, ruining what was one of the emotional high points and one of the key resolutions of the trilogy.

I keep trying to Skype you - please pick up so I can force choke you and prevent you from making any more changes to your movies.

Sincerely,
Darth Vader",1314921600,"3,016",2289,4.950391644908616

The SE included many unnecessary changes that I could live with, but these changes are shoddy in their execution and reveal that Lucasfilms knows nothing about character arc, subtlety or quality.  Someone who works there needs to say 'no' to George.  I recently heard someone say Lucas added the ""nooooo"" because of his laughable ""it's like poetry stanzas"" excuse.  That would be like saying  ""since I used the word 'night' at the end of the 3rd line, I need to make sure I use that same word at the end of line 6.""  Good poetry is not a sing-song rhyme.

I was looking forward to the archival discs, but there's no way I'm shelling out even $90 just to have those.

7221680,1,B00YI71PN2,"Here is my problem with what has happened to these movies.  George Lucas continues to think that people can't understand what is happening in a movie, so he needs to verbally describe what is going on.  It was the issue that plagued Indiana Jones IV and Star Wars I-III.  I was 5 years old when I saw Star Wars for the first time(complete with the storm trooper hitting his head on the door and everything).  The first viewing was a bit confusing to me at the time, but I understood the basic principle and loved how deep the lore was.  It was fascinating to learn all the characters names through toys and word of mouth (the internet didn't really exist at the time as it was 1990).  After a few more viewings, I found that I understood the subtle nuances and was able to grasp what characters were feeling and thinking without them saying it out loud.  Lucas feels that someone that age cannot and that they are apparently his primary audience.  He is catering to the absolute wrong crowd.  These edits make the special edition (which was terrible) look like a classic masterpiece.

One more thing George: Han shot first and Greedo didn't even get a shot off.  That's what made Han Solo cool.",1314921600,19,1194,4.506976744186047

7221684,1,B00YI71PN2,"I, like many, am spurred to voice my disgust on this site in hopes someone, somewhere, will try and find the good still in George Lucas and turn him from the dark side. Like many who love these films, I remember the thrill of seeing the original Star Wars upon its release (at the ripe old age of five). It remains an experience unparalleled in its excitement, wonder and joy. I even enjoyed a great deal about the oft-maligned PT, despite Jar Jar, groan-worthy romance and the total mishandling of a character that likely should have been a lot more Han Solo and a lot less whiny Twilight reject. Regardless, for the most part I have loved most things Star Wars since that first trip to the theater all those years ago.

As far as the changes to the movies, I have been mostly neutral regarding the 1997 and 2004 Special Editions. In all honesty, until the last few days I have been neither a Lucas hater nor an apologist. I even leaned in the direction of those who have sided with George in that these movies are his vision to do with as he pleases. And I was at least mostly okay with the majority of the revisions, the obvious exceptions being Han shoots (not first, because he was the only one who did) and the truly horrible Jedi Rocks (arguably the single worst sequence in the entire Saga).

Now recently we have confirmation of even more tinkering. To be fair, I am not overly bothered if Yoda is CGI, Ewoks blink and Han Solo gets inexplicably iradiated.  However, Mr. Lucas has proven that even the most patient and forgiving among fans have their breaking point. He has found mine in the already infamous ""Darth says no"" additions. Honestly, I wonder if the man is a sadist and is now rubbing the collective noses of those who made him what he is in his foul poodoo of ""perfecting"" his vision. I mean, surely he is aware of the widespread criticism of the similar ""no"" from ROTS. Why else would he essentially replicate that absurdity in ROTJ unless it is to basically ""shoot the bird"" to those who have (rightly) claiimed ol' GL lost his grip on Star Wars a long, long time ago? I am certain he would claim otherwise, but this for me was the final insult added to the already egregious injury.  Of course I have not even mentioned the changes that should have been made (all the color issues from the DVD release) and were not.

So it is with heavy heart (but lightened wallet) that I cancelled my pre-order today. One can always hope against hope that if enough of us raise our voices eventually we will be heard. But to be honest, I don't see anything changing until Emperor Lucas is somehow removed from power. It seems he shares an unfortunate trait with his counterpart from the Saga: Their overconfidence is their weakness, and neither seems capable of admitting they were wrong.",1314921600,24,2799,4.501968503937008
7221685,1,B00YI71PN2,"George Lucas just can't help but keep messing with these movies.  As many have heard, the original trilogy contains a number of alterations, the most disturbing of which is Darth Vader yelling ""NOOOOOO"" as he kills the emperor in Return of the Jedi, to make a bridge to Lucas's Revenge of the Sith.

Here's the thing.  Return of the Jedi was not directed by George Lucas.  It is not his movie - he had the original concept, but the movie is the work of Richard Marquand, who died in 1987.  It is beyond offensive that Lucas would feel justified in modifying someone else's movie (someone who isn't even alive to defend his work), particularly because the modification is to take the subtle, well-directed climax of the film and morph it into some ham-fisted, ridiculous thing.

What kind of director modifies good movies to make them more similar to bad ones?  A bad director, that's what kind.

I will have no part in this.  As much as I would love to have Star Wars on Blu-Ray, I refuse to financially reward someone who would cynically modify a work of art that isn't his.

7221692,1,B00YI71PN2,"Adding to the chorus of 'boos,' I am a strong example of a ""woman (Star) warrior."" I am, unfortunately, old enough to remember going to see every single Star Wars film in cinemas. Not to wax too nostalgic, but as a young(er) lady in 1977, I was swooning to the sight of stud Harrison Ford and ""young turk"" Mark Hamill - all while downing a popcorn (with real butter) and an ice-cold Royal Crown cola. I saw the original Star Wars in cinemas at least two dozen times, Empire about a dozen times, and Jedi about half a dozen. Why the decline? I got busier with my artist management and simply couldn't attend cinema as much as before.

As for the Blu-ray set, somebody should tell Lucas to go jump in a bacta tank. He first trashed the films in 1997 when he plastered cinema screens with pure excrement called the ""Special Editions."" Then he further degraded the trilogy with a whole new set of changes (on top of the '97 changes) for the 2004 DVDs. Now he has applied additional changes on top of the '04 and '97 changes.

At least when Lucas' friend (and far superior filmmaker) Steven Spielberg made egregious alterations to his classic ""E.T."" he insisted that the original version be issued as well. Because not only does Spielberg respect the need to preserve films as they were originally released, he also respects his fans' wishes. I mean, just look at ""Close Encounters"" - the Blu-ray gives us all three separate cuts of the film (including the only one that counts: the theatrical cut).

But Lucas is like someone obsessed with plastic surgery. Once the process of change begins, a person can lose sight and overdo the nipping and tucking (trust me, I've had a few weak-willed friends who ""gave in"" to societal expectations of female so-called beauty). So yes, Vader crying out ""NOOOOO!"" is a horrible idea (and an unnecessary ""link"" to Episode III).  But it really doesn't matter anymore what he does. The damage is done. It's irreparable. And I, for one, prefer to reminisce about my cold RC and sticky theater floors while watching superstuds like Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams making my heart flutter.

One more thought: are these versions acceptable for new, young fans who are just discovering the ""Moldy Saga""? No, because these movies are garbage at this point. Get the DVDs with the original versions - kids don't care how ""perfect"" the special effects are. They respond to the stories and the characters. Hey, when I was a youngster we had sci-fi movies with flying saucers hanging off visible strings or wires. But a good story is a good story. ""Star Wars"" used to be that - all that is left is pure stench because Lucas rotted them.",1314921600,83,2659,4.648936170212766

7221695,5,B00YI71PN2,"I have grown up with the Star Wars canon ever since the seventies, and I've seen and enjoyed them in their various incarnations over the years. To my taste, they have continuously been upgraded and tweaked for the better. The 1997 versions as well as the 2004 ones on DVD. As they now appear on Bluray, I have seen the various alterations to be expected in the films.

Generally, I don't see what everyone keeps fuzzing about!!! Just face it, the films are the director's / producer's creation and he has the sole right to do what he wants with them. He simply stays true to his vision. I can certainly see that the limitations of the time when the early films were produced, made Lucas compromise with what effects he could achieve. This also applies to the retouched Yoda of TPM, which wasn't achievable in 1999, the early days of CGI animation. Today, when the possibilites and finances are there, he simply goes ahead. What Lucas does may be strange compared to many other modern film makers. But in a way, he is working like many classical music composers of the past, for example Brahms, Sibelius etc who worked on their symphonic work for an entire lifetime; they issued a premier version in their youth, withdrew it, changed it, relaunched it, withdrew it, changed it, relaunched it, and so on. Meaning that today their symphonies exist in a number of versions that a lot of contemporary classical labels want to record and release for the first time. Like these composers, Lucas has a vision that he wants to fulfil, and feels free to update his work whenever he feels it is right. Star Wars is the man's Magnum Opus, or lifetime achievement, and he seems set on spending a lifetime with his films. I cannot blame the man for this.

I don't personally mind the tweaks that Lucas offers with the Bluray release. I don't even mind Vader's added ""Noooo!"". That it entirely spoils the impact of the ending is, in my view, an exaggeration. People have complained about the flat acting in the new trilogies, and claimed that Vader's added exclamation goes along the same lines of alleged second-rate melo-drama. Well, Lucas has mentioned before in interviews that his object with the Star Wars films is to create them in accordance with the old-fashioned matine serials broadcast in the 50s. Which undoubtedly all were cheesy and contained less-than-stellar acting. The core of the problem is that the inclusion of old-fashioned melo-drama just does not rhyme with the way films are done today, nor with a modern day film audience. Modern film makers tend to prefer an understated, subtle portrayal, and let the audience use their brains. Watch any old film from the 40s-60s and you will notice how un-subtle and overstated the acting is; it is not easy to become emotionally stirred by those old films. So, in that respect, giving Vader a ""Nooo!"" before he tosses the emperor, goes exactly in line with how films were done back in those days, which, in fact, is what Lucas wants to achieve.

So, quit complaining about the Bluray release! I am, like many others, looking forward to these! Stop comparing the films (the prequels in particular) to other modern films - these are shaped differently, according to a 50s serial blueprint. Accept these versions as they are - they are the director's vision. If you want to recreate something you were obsessed with in your childhood, go back and watch the old versions on VHS. The Blurays present Lucas' vision, an adherence to old-fashioned film making, but with modern day technology, and on the best digital format today. Alike my examples with different versions of old symphonies, another studio may someday hunt down the old versions of Star Wars, remaster them and issue them on Bluray - or whatever format may be the optimal home video experience in the future.",1314921600,7,3817,4.771558245083208
7221696,5,B00YI71PN2,"I have heard complaint after complaint on how George Lucas ruined his saga.  However, in honesty the critics ruined the series, not Lucas.  For those who do not recall, Phantom Menace featured a character (who I thoroughly enjoyed watching) Jar Jar Binks.  Now for some odd reason, supposed fans of this movie took it upon themselves to start an ""I HATE JAR JAR"" campaign against the film.  Oddly it was not started by those who first watched the film (It received very high remarks as a ""return to the original style"" that made the original trilogy famous).  But many hated it and e-mailed Lucas about their grievances.  When it was time to produce the second of the prequels, Lucas took these complaints and used them to create the weakest film of the saga -- ""Attack of the Clones"".  Although Lucas attempted to make fans happy, many were critical of the films name.  Something that Lucas stood by from the upstart.  In the finally of the Prequels, ""Revenge of the Sith""  Many raved that the film was the best of the entire series.  However, overtime, many began complaining about the NOOOOOOO!!!!! comment made by Vader in the films ending.  So it does not surprise me at all that people are going to complain about anything new Lucas adds to his masterpiece.  So considering all these complaints, I have it on good word from Lucas that the best addition to these films, will either be added before distribution, or just before the next round of redistribution.

In this never before seen NEW footage, Darth Vader screams NO! after seeing the Emperor attack Luke and before throwing him over the rail and down the shaft of the Death Star.  However, this is not actually new footage.  The restored sound actually returns the phrase originally in the 1983 theatrical version of the film.  From the sound of it though, I think Lucas added one additional No before throwing the Emperor over the rail.  Anyways the new footage happens immediately after this crucial scene an d marks the return of Jar Jar Binks!!!

IN this new footage, we discover Jar Jar has been working with Anakin and the Emperor on the Death Star.  He has been crucial in gathering up every Jar Jar Bink hating critic across the Galaxy ad placing them in a special detention center that was once used as a docking station.  After Jar Jar hears the Emperors screams, Jar Jar gets a force message from Anakin that it is time to press the release button on their hostages.  However, in typical Jar Jar fashion he hits the wrong button and sends these critics into the dead of space.  Now many would figure that the Rebels would rescue these helpless people.  But Lando Calrissian remembered how many of them called him a traitor for turning Han over to Boba Fett.  So he accidentally fires a few rounds into the critics who hated him most for his actions.  Although unable to get them all before the Death Star explodes, never fear, for the Super Death Star also gets its revenge on those so critical of this storyplot and when it blows up, it sends millions of pieces through the survivors of Lando's attack.  Back on Endor, Luke, Han, Lando, Vader, Qui Gon, Jar Jar, the Emperor, Yoda, and Obi-Wan all make a toast to the end of the critics of this highly successful franchise.  OR AT LEAST LUCAS SHOULD INCLUDE THIS SCENE IN THE MOVIE!!!!!

No matter what people state about the Blu-Ray release, STAR WARS will always be one of the greatest films ever made.  And I am sure on Blu-Ray it will still remain great.  If critics really want to complain about something, then why didn't they get angry when Paramount changed their beloved Star Ship Enterprise in the Special Release of Star Trek The Original Series????  They made the once bold looking ship look like something found in an early Buck Rodgers film --- A true disgrace.  What few so-called flaws by Lucas will generate more sales of these films (one more time) for those who are looking at the perfected version of this film saga.  What is even more of a disgrace for me (and I include myself in this list for making fun of the Starship Enterprise) is do any of us really recall why we loved these films?  Or are we just attempting to compare them to the more recent film hits  (like ""The Matrix"", Harry Potter, or Avatar)?  I have never seen anytime that Lucas has ruined these films, and as many know, he will rerelease this set once more, and include in the original films.  So why complain critics?  You know you will still buy this package just like you have purchased every package since the films rerelease in the early 90s.  That is my opinion of it anyways.  AND YES, I DID LIKE and still LIKE JAR JAR BINKS!!!!  That was probably the only character who was close to being what every young Star Wars fan looked forward to seeing in every new film.  And notice I stated ""Young Fan""????  These films were made for eth young and young at heart.  So no matter what changes Lucas does to them (without erasing the film altogether) will not hurt the films true fans --- The KIDS!!!!",1314921600,13,5015,4.579124579124579

I was thrilled by the 1995 OT (Original Trilogy) THX remastered VHS releases, (I bought both letterbox and full-screen sets just to make sure I'd always have the original)I was originally excited about the Special Editions in 1997, but quickly found the additions/changes distracting, and went back to those THX sets, and when the trilogy came to DVD, I honestly only bought them for the bonus disc content. I was excited by the original versions released on ""Limited Edition"" DVD, but slightly disappointed by the fact that they were not the 1995 THX remastered cuts, they were the 1991 Laserdisc transfers? So now I have a cobbled together set of the OT and bonus features disc from the Special Edition 2.0 box, and I'm happy with that. But I'd love to just get the OT extras disc from the blu ray set. I simply don't need or want ANY of the rest of it! I thought the prequels were lousy, with Ep II being quite possibly one of the worst movies ever, and the whole prequel trilogy a complete waste of time. I honestly don't consider them when I think of the OT. So with the prequels unwanted, and these latest Special Editions completely useless to me, I can't justify buying this. I first thought, I'd buy it, and sell off the other discs, but since they don't come in there own cases, that's just not going to work. (Would anyone buy this set minus a disc, especially THAT one??) I hopefully will be able to see the original trilogy archives disc, but not at the cost of the whole set. If George Lucas was smart.............sigh....he would have released a ""Collector's Edition"" set on blu ray with the OT and the first Special Editions as released on VHS with all the interviews and documentary features from those, then he could go all mental and keep changing things for never ending new editions every few years, but at least the originals would remain intact and available to THOSE WHO WANT THEM.

7221701,1,B00YI71PN2,"Dear George,

Stop tampering with timeless classics. We appreciated the hi-def VHS back in 1995. We tolerated the CGI extras in 1997. We gagged on your prequels, and wretched at your DVD edits (Hayden at the end of ROTJ, seriously?) and now these blu-ray hacks (and that is what they are, hacked-apart masterpieces) will succeed in turning even the most loyal fans against your blatant profiteering and utter callousness.

But hey, your George Lucas. People will buy whatever trash and cheesy merchandise you churn out. I should have hoped that South Park episode would have taught you a lesson a few years ago. Which timeless classic are you going to edit-into-ruin next?",1314835200,55,672,4.991071428571429
7221702,1,B00YI71PN2,... then change Boba Fett not dying in the first few seconds of the fight on the sand barge. What a waste of an iconic character. I was already disappointed by Hayden Christensen replacing Sebastian Shaw as the ghost of Darth Vader at the end of Return of the Jedi. This is just too much. I will be voting with my wallet. No Star Wars on Blu-Ray for me.,1314835200,33,353,4.130434782608695
7221703,1,B00YI71PN2,"opposed this version of theses Hollywood master piece because of the cgi added characters, views, and star ships. Lucas ruins our favorite childhood movies with added cgi gimmics. Literally boycott this movie",1314835200,34,208,5.53125
7221704,1,B00YI71PN2,"Star Wars was a groundbreaking film.  Not the best young cast ever, but a truly revolutionary piece of storytelling.

It's been over 30 years since, and George Lucas can't stop screwing with it.  I was 11 when ""A New Hope"" was released, and I saw it over 50 times over the following months.  But it's not the same movie any more.  He's not just screwing with his film - he's trying to re-write the past with a broad brush, marginalizing all the brilliant strokes in the original release.  He's worth billions - as a ""job creator"", he should be willing to spend a million or two, clean up the original releases with 4K scans, and do his myriad of fans a huge favor.

Pre-order cancelled.  I'm just hoping someday the original will be re-released, as I so vividly remember it.",1314835200,33,774,4.478571428571429
7221705,5,B00YI71PN2,"I can't wait for these blu-rays, SW finally in HD.  I have been a SW fan my whole life, considering I was born a year before the first was released.  I have gotten all of the previous versions of the films, DVD wise.  I expect them to be just as good, if not better than the DVDs.  All the new bonus features look pretty cool.  Excited and ready to go.

But what gets me is all these people out there that can't get past they're ""dogmatic point of views"".  I rember the days when people were actuall SW fans.  Now all they do is complain when a change is made to better the film.  Where did all the real SW fans go?? If you were real SW fans you would take it for what it is, not complain over changes.  You demand somthing and now you have nothing but complaints for what you wanted.  Dont buy them you don't deserve them, save them for the real SW fans.  Hey somebody had to say it!!",1314835200,15,885,4.022988505747127

Months pass...Then the travesty that is slowly unfolding before us starts to occur. At first, I hope it to be a mock up, fake, etc. But it seems more likely now that all the changes are actually happening.

So...Being a loving Star Wars fan, I did the only thing that I could. I deleted the order that I had placed for the complete box set and will GLADLY do without Lucas' P.O.S.

Sigh. Coulda been great.",1314835200,39,533,4.32

7221709,1,B00YI71PN2,"Pre-order cancelled.

Why? Lucas has ruined one of the seminal moments in the original trilogy with a ridiculous cry. I'd rather have a straight across transfer of the special edition dvds than these new blu-rays.

Pity.",1314835200,8,220,5.083333333333333

7221714,1,B00YI71PN2,George Lucas is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. For over two decades I've loved and enjoyed Star Wars. Before the dark times. Before the Special Editions/Prequels.,1314835200,22,176,5.103448275862069
7221715,1,B00YI71PN2,"I read with dismay that George Lucas is tampering again with his, it seems, no so beloved movies.  He must be still truly unhappy and disappointed with them to be changing the original movies at every opportunity he has, which, curiously, is always related to money. Now releases the originals, later the special edition, later the originals together with the special edition, then the prequels with a modified edition of the originals' special edition. And you wait; he probably is not finish yet. Most likely Mr. Lucas will also release a put-your-glasses-on 3D version with new digital sequences, maybe later a 12.2 surround with new special effects and music. For sure, in six years, to celebrate Star Wars' 40th birthday, he will surely redo the movies again, in 4D or whatever filmic dimension we are at that moment, maybe with a different story performed by digitalized actors, being the star a revamped Darth Vader played, thanks to the magic of digital technology, by a resurrected Laurence Olivier, so the whole trilogy becomes a look alike Shakespearian tragedy, for it looks that is the path he tries to make `his' movies go. Therefore, instead of the ""Nooooo"" Lucas is going to make Darth Vader say in order to eliminate the climax in the most important sequence of TROTJ, and in the process match the end of the VI episode with the III, Mr. Lucas should try something like ""To be or not to be, there is no question, I lift you with my arms to destroy all your charms, and drop you into the vent, so in the force you don't make another dent."" Nothing can be closer to Hamlet. Well, dear George, Star Wars is not Shakespeare, and doesn't need to be. In fact, It better not be.
George Lucas should try to follow the norm that states `If something works, don't fix it,"" and learn the lessons of other directors who also try `to improve' what couldn't be improved. It comes to mind Steven Spielberg and the Indiana Jones Trilogy in DVD, which supposedly was going to have added scenes and retouched digital effects. The fan's complains, and a timely South Park episode saved the day, and the movies can be enjoyed as they were originally conceived (I hope that George Lucas, who was the producer, doesn't get any ideas about them when it comes the time to be released in Blue Ray). If Spielberg has retouched any of his movies, it was precisely to eliminate non-sense added sequences, like that horrible anticlimactic ending scene in Close Encounters that Universal make him shot. On the contrary, George Lucas, Universal style, sees the original Star Wars trilogy merely as a commodity, destined to produce revenue one way or the other and as long as the movie industry exists. Many of us consider that Stars Wars is much more that a set of movies, they are something that belongs by right to the history of cinema, of this country, and probably of the world. The Star Wars Trilogy is more than movies, and one only has to watch, for example, Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed, among other documentaries, to realize that their content extends beyond their pure filmic intent. It is the Star Wars of 1977 the one that changed movie history, not the one of 1997, and for sure not the ones are about to be released in Blue Ray. That movie made 34 years ago is the one that most of us want to watch, with the entire splendor a Blue Ray can bring to the image, and nothing more. It is difficult to believe that a `cineasta' with more than 30 years in the business on his back cannot see beyond his nose in this matter. Maybe that's what happens when one owns a corporation that doesn't create movies but makes other movies look good through the marginal creativity of special effects (that's why the creativity of the FX couldn't save the prequels). Lucas is trying, again, to make those classical marvels to look good by creating another pointless adulterated copy. I don't see how adding dialogues, changing screams (Ben Kenobi's), digitalizing sequences or actors, or doing anything to movies already perfect makes them more perfect or more appealing to thousands of fans that yield to see the originals, not a corrupted copy. Does anyone think that digitalizing the last sequence of Casablanca, or changing the dialogues of Gone with the Wind (""Frankly my dear, I don't give a f@#k""), or adding digital extras to the battles in Spartacus, is going to make those movies better, more classical? Probably Lucas does, and wants to put every movie ever made through a computer and a recording studio so they look and sound as they were made yesterday. Why not; ""if Ted turner could color B&W movies, I can now turn all of them into holograms.""
 Many forgave Lucas when he made up the artificial special editions; since his justification for the move was believable, most of the fans, me included, fell in the trap (still I wonder how you can envision something that didn't exist in the 70's, i.e. digital effects). However, I never understood Lucas's unwillingness to release the original movies on DVD. He finally did, probably under fans' pressure, thanks God, but still we had to go through two or three releases of those pesky special editions, and so the originals had to came out also accompanied by them (and to the trash they went). Of course, surprise, surprise,  I couldn't see any real or unreal improvement, no ""wow, that's amazing,"" (only the brief encounter of Luke with his childhood friend before the last battle in episode IV); the added digital sequences matched the rest of the movies like a glove would fit the fin of a dolphin, but at least the story, dialogues, emotions, climatic sequences remained the same (I saw, however, a un-improvement in the marriage of Lucas and digital era with the disappointing prequels). But now Mr. Lucas wants to go where no one has gone before and tamper with the heart and soul of the movies, the dialogue, and remove the climax from one of the most climatic scenes in movie history, the triangular, private duel taking place in the Death Star, the scene that resolves the conflict we have been suffered together with the characters, the redemption of the tragic hero, Darth Vader. Maybe a `Nooooo"" (less than 2 secs.) in the mouth of Darth Vader doesn't seem a big deal, but it is. Just Darth Vader's sudden movement towards the emperor, conjugated with Luke's look of relieve, surprise and pity, all lifted by John Williams's music was what made the sequence perfect.  No words. But soon, September 16, that ""noooo"" enhanced by True Dolby Digital and in bombastic THX, is going to scream across the living rooms of the USA, and the world, maybe, wishful thinking, as the symbolic voice for all of us, ""Lucas, nooooo, why did you do that."" And there, in the Death Star, by the mouth of Darth Vader controlled by George Lucas, is where also TROTJ will also die, thrown deep into the abyss together with the emperor and the money this monstrosity is going to cost. How appropriate. Anyway, and paraphrasing Ricky's words in Casablanca, ""We'll always have the originals,"" and I'm going to stick with them. Those of us who know the original movies, and saw them when they were released and later in VHS or laser disk, are extremely lucky and I hope that the movies are shown by parents, and grandparents, and uncles, and aunts, and brothers, and sisters to the successive new generations, since Lucas is denying them the pleasure of watching not only a movie as it was conceived, but how a piece of movie history was made. The sadness of this entire blunder is that Lucas is not the only one to blame, we also are. In two weeks many, lots, will run to the stores, real or on line, to get a pristine copy in Blue Ray, instead of letting it go and keep playing their already owned pristine DVDs and thus force Lucas to recall the Blue Rays and do it again, this time right. Yes, ""show him the money"", as Tom Cruise's character would say; I won't. September 16 I will play the original movies (maybe even in Castilian, as I saw them for the first time when I was 14, at least the first two, TROTJ is doubted in Latin America) as if I just bought them. And I will wait until Lucas decides is time to make more money by releasing the original movies so he looks like he cares. Only then I will fall in his trap and buy them. But right now, I am going to make a copy, better two, of my Star Wars DVDs so I can keep the originals unblemished in case Lucas decides that the next step is to burn the negatives and so any remaining memory of a certain movie that premiered in May of 1977 to the delight and amazement of several million people and changed the way we see movies.",1314835200,26,8621,4.614332247557003
7221716,1,B00YI71PN2,"I was very disapointed to hear that the unaltered theatrical films would not be included in this set. Still even with the previous changes I was going to purchase it. Then I heard and saw the changes made ,and well no. The bottom line is the I have seen these films and own them on DVD. It doesn't make sense for me to repurchase the films AGAIN. Especially after hearing and seeing the redubbed climax. A great movie moment has been altered to pay off a moment in the Revenge of the Sith ( a moment that was laughed at by the audience at the screening I was at ). Whatever man. If there is ever a Blu Ray set that offers the unaltered originals I'm in. Til then there are other ways to watch these films without unnesesary changes.",1314835200,24,732,4.235714285714286

I don't think we as fans will ever get to have the same experience as we have had before thanks to Lucas having complete control of every aspect of the series.  We tell him, we want the original theatrical releases of star wars, and what does he do?  Makes them worse to maybe make us mad?  If i weren't mistaken i would say Lucas hates Star Wars and hates the fans even more.  He time and time again lets us down with these ""new"" releases.  I'm sad to say I'm done giving into pathetic excuse of remastered material and putting more money in his pockets.

I implore every fan out there who loves Star Wars for what it should be, do not buy this it's a waste of money and only proves we are stupid and easily manipulated to buying junk",1314835200,26,863,4.225609756097561

Some of the original changes made for the SE were at least tolerable and at least one change made sense, like the voice of the actor who spoke for Boba Fett in The Empire Strikes Back was replaced with the voice of the actor who played Jango Fett in the prequels; but it's getting out of hand with this new release.

These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tommorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with ""fresher faces,"" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new ""original"" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires. The copyright holders, so far, have not been completely diligent in preserving the original negatives of films they control. In order to reconstruct old negatives, many archivists have had to go to Eastern bloc countries where American films have been better preserved.
In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be ""replaced"" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.",1314835200,72,1158,5.036458333333333
7221722,5,B00YI71PN2,"Note to reader: Just because a review doesn't hold the same opinion as your own, doesn't mean it's unhelpful. The button reads ""helpful"" or ""unhelpful,"" not ""agree"" and ""disagree""!!!!!!!!!

So, this is what the big deal is? Darth Vader crying out ""No"" when he throws the Emperor into the reactor? Some of you fanatics really need to get over it and learn how to be a child again. I don't think that the new addition is that bad at all. I think it makes the scene better in my opinion and can understand why Lucas added it. This is the moment that Vader regains his humanity, through his son, and I believe that it should be not only expressed with action but with words. The only reason why, i believe, most of you dislike the new addition is because it reminds you of the scene from ""Revenge of the Sith.""  That scene gets an unfair wrap from people just because it quickly cuts to the next scene, making Vader's cry feel slightly awkward. It's funny, because no one says anything about a similar awkward cut that was in ""Empire"" when Yoda says, ""there is another,"" it quickly jumps to the next scene, I remember viewing that and being like , ""Wait, what did he just say?!"" I wish they would have stayed on Vader when he cried out ""No"" and made him fall to his knees, so that the viewer could take it in, same with the Yoda scene. My point is this: this has been happening in Star Wars and I STILL LOVE IT! People need to relax and instead of rejecting the new additions try and see why Lucas, the artist, included it. I like the new dialogue as stated above.

I won't even go into the blinking Ewok eyes or the new Obi Won cry because those changes are so minor to me. I could care less but some of you people who are upset about that are borderline cynical and neurotic.

And the whole film Connoisseur attitude that some of you have is too much. The Criterion Collection has numerous classical films with multiple versions, such as Orson Wells ""Mr. Arkadin,"" with some versions better than the other as far as image quality, and you don't hear Orson fans complaining. They appreciate the multiple versions. You film connoisseurs talk about art but who are you?! You are not an artist, you're a spectator. Lucas is the artist and no matter how much you complain, you still love him. Lucas is the least mean spirited guy in all of film making, unlike someone like James Cameron, yet you hate him with a passion. It's sad because when he passes away you'll all be crying and thanking him.

I also don't understand all the complaining regarding image quality, even for the dvd sets!! I recently just watched the OT on my HDTV and PS3 and I thought it looked great and this is just DVD! I read a lot of complaints about the quality and it just makes me shake my head like you people don't appreciate anything.

Then there's the never ending complaining of not having the original theatrical versions in high quality DVD or included on this Blu Ray. Look, Lucas released the theatrical versions on DVD already!! Okay they were released in 4:3 Letterbox but guess what? There's such thing as ""Zoom"" on your TV, you know! I like the SE versions of ""Empire"" and ""Jedi"" but not ""Hope"" because i like the notion of Han shooting first and the Jabba scene is unnecessary, so guess what? I bought the limited edition DVD with the theatrical version as a bonus! All I do is zoom in and boom! Everything is fine. Sure the image is grainy when there are white backgrounds but i think it gives it an edge. You people expect Lucas to go out of his way and restore the originals but he never promised that!!!! you should be happy he did what he did because if he didn't all you would have is VHS and that would really suck.  It's you crazy fans that are being selfish, not Lucas.

So when I get the Blu Ray versions I'm just going to switch out the SE version of ""Hope"" and replace it with the limited edition theatrical version. I'm a ""happy camper!"" I also like to add that I think it's awesome that Lucas fixed the puppet Yoda in ""Phantom."" Thanks Lucas!

And while I'm at it I might as well defend the hated prequels. Look, the whole point of ""Phantom"" was to show that no one is born evil. Some of you people want to view Vader as pure evil but that's not how life is. even Hitler was a baby! Even he was innocent at some point but most people don't want to admit that. They just want to view him as pure evil. Lucas is deep and you people don't want to see it. I also like to add that I hate people like the infamous Red Letter Media, who get famous off of slandering and scrutinizing Lucas' creation. If it wasn't for Lucas that degenerate wouldn't even be known, so as much as he dislikes Lucas, he owes his fame all to him! This guy says ""Phantom"" had no main character but that is incorrect. the main character is Qui-Gong, then Anakin! Who the heck do you think is on the screen most of the time!!!! Red Letter Media is despicable.

Then there's the Midi-chlorians. I think most of the people that hate this idea feel excluded from the force because they are too fanatical but in actuality the Midi-chlorians are based on the Endosymbiotic theory. Lucas was just using this as a plot device to say ""Anakin is a very very very strong dude"" it doesn't mean that the force isn't everywhere or that you are excluded from it. He needed a way to convey to the audience the strength of Anakin and how can you do that through spirituality alone when you have dozens of Jedi moving things around with their minds and such? You need science!

Then there's the complaining of the dialogue in ""Clones,"" which is a movie I love with all my heart. You people swear the romance between Neo and Trinity, Aragon and Arwen, is so Shakespearean! Also the constant hatred for Hayden's depiction of Anakin is totally misunderstood. Many people claim that he whines too much and that it makes Anakin look like a brat. Let me ask you folks a question: How were you when you were a teenager?! All teenagers are whinny and self-centered! I don't care what you say, that is the truth. Remember the scene when Luke first meets Yoda and he is impatient and whining about ""we're wasting our time!"" No one complains about that but that is a straight up parallel to his father Anakin. ""The boy is impatient"" Yoda says, yet many ""fans"" hate Hayden and not that scene with Luke. Also, Lucas was going for a whole James Dean vibe for Hayden, which i think he nailed impeccably. Go watch ""Rebel without a Cause."" There are alot of resemblances to Hayden's performance yet everyone adores James Dean's performance in that film and no one calls him out for being whinny.

I also think people fail to see the importance of Anakin's visions of his mother and wife being killed. This is paralleled in ""Empire"" when Luke sees Han and Leia being killed in his visions. Yoda tells him not to go in fear that he will go down the same path as Anakin. This is great story telling and i believe many of you can't see past your hatred because you've lost touch with your inner child and can't stop judging and let your emotional poisons blind you. Somewhere down the line you got the notion in your mind that Star Wars was the next Holy Bible but it was always meant to be fun. All the complaining of dialogue in the prequels is unfair. ""You scruffy looking nerf herder"" ""I Was Going to Toshi Station to Pick Up Some Power Converters .."" are lines from the OT that could easily be interpreted as corny dialogue yet no one complains. Face it, many of you have become bitter adults. Put there is always hope.

Then there's the complaining about Padme dying of a broken heart. Don't you guys remember that this is the fantasy genre? I thought ""Revenge of the Sith"" was just as great as any film from the OT and I can't believe people still find something wrong with it. I loved that film to death.

Certain dialogue is really overlooked by many with the ""western"" mentality. Lucas derives a lot of themes from eastern philosophy and Joseph Cambell's mythology books. The scene where Anakin tells Padme she's beautiful and she says ""only because i'm so in love"" to which he says ""No, it's because i'm so in love with you"" is another scene that is torn apart by the degenerate Red Letter Media. What Lucas is trying to say here is that it is the act of loving that brings happiness, not being loved!!!! Which Anakin clearly misunderstands. This went right over your guys' heads. Go read Don Miguel Ruiz' ""The Mastery of Love"" or the ""Tao Te Ching"" and maybe you will understand.

Also a scene in ""Clones"" that is hated is the one where Anakin confuses compassion for love, this is something that I found was very touching and i can understand how a jedi, someone sworn to a certain lifestyle like a monk, can misunderstand compassion as ""encouragement to love."" The story is deep and i once again ask you upset viewers to stop being so hateful and open your minds. Stop being judges. That's why so many children love Star Wars because they don't judge! That's why you say Lucas ""raped"" your child hood because when you were a child you didn't judge, now that you're an adult, all you do is judge. I think some of you people want Star Wars to be Lord of the Rings. I like LOTR but at times it's too serious. SW is always fun. ALWAYS. That is the difference.

And lastly who isn't excited about deleted scenes from the OT?!!! You know you want to see them!

I just want to say to people stop being so judgmental and open your mind and heart like you did as a child. i love star wars and i'm not some happy go lucky no brainer. I got problems controlling my anger and Star Wars is one of the few things that makes me happy when i'm down. I can really relate to the story. To anakin's because i want to be wise but i deal with my dark side and also with Luke because i got problems with my father, who is a very callus man.  In other words: Lighten up and be happy with what you got! I know I am. I'm buying the blu-ray ASAP!",1314835200,18,9963,4.361725067385445

For the most part they're not that big of deal and don't really add or subtract from my experience or enjoyment. Besides, the problem isn't actually the changes that have been made, it's really George Lucas' refusal to release the original versions. I wish that he would just release them.

Preorder for Complete Saga canceled on August 31, 2011.

Thank goodness the abominable changes (a few of them linked to with youtube clips below) leaked far enough in advance for people to cancel their preorders. I didn't really need the Blu-Ray additions, but I preordered anyway to get HD Star Wars..........however, I REFUSE to shell out $90 (original price of $140?!?!?!) to watch the most powerful scene in the entire saga be turned into a farce. Hayden's mug at the end of Jedi in 2004 was bad enough. This is the final straw.

A lifelong Star Wars fan has officially canceled his preorder and urges everyone else to do the same ---- please don't waste money on supporting these terrible changes. $90 can be spent so much better.......

.....in addition to all of the past foolish changes (e.g. Hayden Christensen in Return of the Jedi, completely replacing Sebastian Shaw!!), here is what pushed this huge Star wars fan over the edge(replace the 'h**p' with 'http' to go to the youtube links):

[...]

[...]

<\beginrant>

The Noooooooo addition isn't as hammy as the Noooooo at the end of Revenge of the Sith....BUT......they added this completely unnecessary and distracting dialogue in the middle of what was a PERFECT scene and the climax of the entire saga.  With this change, all of the subtle internal conflict and suspense is lost and the scene is dumbed down to three-year-old level, completely ruining the tension and deflating ultimate surprise when Vader grabs the Emperor and heaves him over the edge.

This is one of the most iconic scenes in all of cinema for a reason......it was perfect.....to mess with it AT ALL deserves the harshest of criticism from one's fanbase and colleagues alike.

The fact that these changes split the fanbase in two (those that don't mind it vs. those that hate it) is reason enough for them not to be made. The originals were brilliant, flaws and all. Just give us the remastered, upscaled transfers of the original prints and retire forever, George....I want a good-looking (high-quality transfer) of the versions I fell in love with. NOT versions with substantial and distracting edits to the score, the pacing, the dialogue, the sound effects etc.

Yes, it is Lucas' baby to play with. It is also my money (and yours) to give to him or not. Some may not agree with me, but these changes are dealbreakers (especially the one made to the climax of the whole saga) at the current price --- I understand that some people can still appreciate the movies to the fullest even with these changes --- that's great and best wishes w/ the Blu_ray transfers. Unfortunately, I don't fall into that camp and I'd like to encourage as many people as possible to NOT support Lucas' latest revisions by cancelling their preorders and only buying this later on at a nice discount.

What is really terrible is that I just watched the REAL, ORIGINAL version of the climactic scene in Return of the Jedi where Vader picks up the Emperor ----- I started to again get emotionally vested in the scene, but at the key moment that is usually emotionally overwhelming , my emotion was tempered because I was hearing the ""No.........NOOOOOOO!!!!"" in my head even though the dialogue wasn't in the version I was watching.

Lucas has tainted that scene in my mind forever........I wish I had never even heard that new dialogue! I hope that this is just because it is fresh in my mind and that in the coming years, I can forget that I ever even heard new dialogue in that scene and can go back to fully appreciating the scene in its true form, brimming with power and emotion.....

I urge you all to BOYCOTT this release and pick this up second-hand or at a very significant discount in a few months when it turns out that they have a massive overstock because the fans finally decided to spit out George's slop.

7221729,1,B00YI71PN2,"In 1978, Star Wars was nominated for 10 academy awards (including best picture, best screenplay, best supporting actor, etc.) ultimately winning 7 including awards for editing, sound mixing, and special effects. The AFI lists ""Star Wars"" as #15 on its list of all time greatest films.  Make no mistake, this isn't just a fun romp, it is a very significant and important film.

Understand that the version in this box set is NOT that version, but a version that has been largely painted over with 21st century computer graphics, does NOT include the academy-award-winning sound mix, and with many different and more recent editing decisions. On this version, the effects and edits you see may be from 1977, or they might be from 1997, or maybe 2004, or maybe 2011... they might be the original academy-award-winning animatronics of Stears Dykstra, Edlund, and McCune that have never been equaled, or they might have been replaced by dated-looking 1990s computer-graphics, or they might be new things that were thrown in a couple of months ago. The choice of scenes and editing of those scenes might be the academy-awarding winning ones made by Paul Hirsch and Marcia Lucas, or they might be newer ones made by people who are preparing the movie for future 3D-a-rama. The glorious academy-award-winning sound mix by MacDougall, West, Minkler and Ballhas remains unavailable and has been replaced here by a yet another new one, and into which the young remixer even inserted his own voice.

In short, this release not only fails utterly to preserve a major artifact of our cinematic heritage, it goes further in that its producer has made it clear that he will never allow that seminal work to be accurately preserved.

7221732,1,B00YI71PN2,"""My name is George Lucas. I am a writer, director, and producer of motion pictures and Chairman of the Board of Lucasfilm Ltd., a multi-faceted entertainment corporation.

I am not here today as a writer-director, or as a producer, or as the chairman of a corporation. I've come as a citizen of what I believe to be a great society that is in need of a moral anchor to help define and protect its intellectual and cultural heritage. It is not being protected.

The destruction of our film heritage, which is the focus of concern today, is only the tip of the iceberg. American law does not protect our painters, sculptors, recording artists, authors, or filmmakers from having their lifework distorted, and their reputation ruined. If something is not done now to clearly state the moral rights of artists, current and future technologies will alter, mutilate, and destroy for future generations the subtle human truths and highest human feeling that talented individuals within our society have created.

A copyright is held in trust by its owner until it ultimately reverts to public domain. American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history.

People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as ""when life begins"" or ""when it should be appropriately terminated,"" but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.

These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tomorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with ""fresher faces,"" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new ""original"" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires. The copyright holders, so far, have not been completely diligent in preserving the original negatives of films they control. In order to reconstruct old negatives, many archivists have had to go to Eastern bloc countries where American films have been better preserved.

In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be ""replaced"" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.

There is nothing to stop American films, records, books, and paintings from being sold to a foreign entity or egotistical gangsters and having them change our cultural heritage to suit their personal taste.

I accuse the companies and groups, who say that American law is sufficient, of misleading the Congress and the People for their own economic self-interest.

I accuse the corporations, who oppose the moral rights of the artist, of being dishonest and insensitive to American cultural heritage and of being interested only in their quarterly bottom line, and not in the long-term interest of the Nation.

The public's interest is ultimately dominant over all other interests. And the proof of that is that even a copyright law only permits the creators and their estate a limited amount of time to enjoy the economic fruits of that work.

There are those who say American law is sufficient. That's an outrage! It's not sufficient! If it were sufficient, why would I be here? Why would John Houston have been so studiously ignored when he protested the colorization of ""The Maltese Falcon?"" Why are films cut up and butchered?

Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.

I hope you have the courage to lead America in acknowledging the importance of American art to the human race, and accord the proper protection for the creators of that art--as it is accorded them in much of the rest of the world communities.""",1314835200,35,4537,4.899608865710561

Lucas has given numerous excuses as to why he can't remaster the originals for an updated home video release. He has said that the original negatives were destroyed to make the special editions, I find it hard to believe that a filmmaker would be so callous that he would destroy the only remaining negative of his original work. I also find it hard to believe that there are not multiple 35mm prints that are in decent condition and could be restored for a brilliant HD presentation.

His most recent excuse is that it would just cost too much. Last I checked, Lucas is worth over 3 billion dollars, how expensive would a full restoration be? 20 million? 40 million? Either way, that's chump change to Lucas! I'm willing to bet that if every die hard fan gave 5 dollars to restore the original films, they would be paid for hand over fist!

I know of no other film maker that has such a disdain for his fans as George Lucas...I am a huge fan of the franchise but his constant tinkering leaves me very bitter.

I was actually considering buying the blu-ray set until I heard of the unnecessary inclusion of Darth Vader crying ""Nooooo"" when he kills the emperor...it lessens the impact and emotion of that scene. Other unnecessary inclusions being the altered Krayt dragon call Obi-Wan uses to scare off the Sand People (this was actually altered before for the 2004 release).

I for one, liked many of the additions in the Special Editions (the new dramatic escape of the Falcon in Mos Eisley was one example).  The simple fact is this; These are Georges movies.  We are only along for the ride.  I compare his movies to how Walt Disney felt about his Disneyland...it will never truly be 'finished'.  They recently updated the Star Tours attractions at Disneyland and Walt Disney World and you don't hear the SW fans complaining about all the updated awesomeness.

Some of the changes are a little strange (Han should ALWAYS have shot first).  But Yoda did look awful in Episode I and I'm glad he addressed it.  Did Darth Vader need to scream 'noooooo!' in the end of VI?  no but it will fit better i the scheme of the 6 movies.

I suppose if he would just put out an original theatrical release version of the 3 movies, then there would be nothing for them to complain about, but I'm guessing somehow they still would.  Would they be happy if the sound was left all scratchy and imperfect?  I doubt it.  I for one would pass on it.  I always felt some of the early ILM effects don't play very well these days, even if they were amazing in their day.

My life is better having experienced all the Star Wars movies.  I will gladly buy these when they come out.  I wonder if this will be one of the best selling 'worst-reviewed' titles of all time?

That's what kept me from getting this pack when it came out in 2011.  I always MUST have the cool Blu Ray pack the day it comes out, but not this one.

I very much made my peace with the old (and infamous) changes GL made to the original trilogy, but as soon as I saw the trailers with the new changes for the Blu Ray, that was a deal breaker.  Fast forward 2015, I saw this in the Amazon second hand market at 40 bucks.  Since it was in good condition (and I haven't seen the original films in a veeeery long time), I pulled the trigger.  I start watching the movies and I thought ""I should have bought this form the get go.

Then I start watching Return of the Jedi...

We all know that very important changes apply to Star Wars (like Greedo shooting first, new musical numbers in Mos Eisley, and Jabba talking with Han, between others), and we all know the changes made in Empire Strikes Back, which were relatively minor, but the changes, and specially, the NEW changes made in ROTJ were painful.  Actually PAINFUL!!  And more specifically, the fact that Lucas added voice on Vader in the scene in which the Emperor is frying Luke by saying ""No... NOOOOOOOO!"" is unforgivable.

The camera work was perfect!!  We all knew Vader was in conflict when the Emperor was killing Luke.  So WHY adding voice to that??

The last slap in the face was in the very last scene in Jedi, in which Luke sees Obi Wan, Yoda, and... Hyden Christensen???  My friends told me this change was made sicne the DVDs, but I never saw it.  WTF??!!!  To a casual fan the reaction is ""Who is that?"", and the immediate response would be ""that's the guy who plays Anakin in the horrible prequels.

And lets me fair, I have nothing against Hyden Christensen, but honestly he doesn't belong in the original triogy.  And for those ""purist"" who say ""It makes perfect sense because Anakin is presented with the image he had when he was good"", well I'll say ""The last time he was good was when he saved Luke from the Emperor and restored balance to the Force (?)""  I don't like much the last part because in all true.. we just don't know anything about that ""prophesy"" Lucas tried to sold us with the prequels.

Anyway, I hate Lucasfilms made changes to tie the original films with the horrible prequels.  Because of that, I'm thinking that I was scamed with $40.  Who knew.

I give this set a 2 and a half stars because of the technical aspects.  The films are still great (the originals anyway), but they come with unnecesary crap that only distracts you.",1314835200,,2571,4.451820128479658

In the scene we see Anakin Skywalker reasserting himself over the evil that Vader represented in his life.  The parallel to Anakin's anguish after discovering that Padme was dead  is good because love for his family and the realization of that loss is what drove Anakin to the dark side to begin with (both with his mother in Episode II and his wife in Episode III). The fact that Anakin's love for his son (more family) drives him back to the light and the EMOTION OF THAT MOMENT when he finally comes back and essentially sacrifices himself; I'm sorry, that moment deserves something more than just silence from Vader/Anakin.

7221770,1,B00YI71PN2,"In 1989, the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress selected the film as a ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically important"" film. If this is true, then why can George Lucas keep changing this film and the trilogy it comprises? In 1977 Star Wars was released. In 1997 it was rereleased with added footage and various edits small and large that in my opinion altered the movie for the worse - Han Solo no longer shot first in the cantina meaning the plot contorted itself to allow his opponent to shoot first but miss from a table away, the space battles now included a mixture of the original model work and sporadically inserted computer graphics in a jarring way, Return of the Jedi now had different closing scenes song and different performance in another part, while matte paintings were replaced by digital scenes and extended fly-bies. These films were then issued on DVD in 2004 and contained yet more alterations - the 1997 version of Jabba the Hutt in the first film was replaced by a more 'accurate to the prequels ' version of Jabba while the voice of Boba Fett was replaced by the dude who'd played his father in the prequels and quite frankly there are other changes because the ghost of Anakin at the end of Return of the Jedi is now Hayden Christensen instead of the original actor and if I recall correctly, Greedo still shoots first at Han and misses, but now by less. In summary : these movies have gone through multiple iterations and while fans like myself may not be representative of the average person, underneath this there is the story of George Lucas, a man who for whatever reason released a groundbreaking movie / movies once and has for whatever reason never felt the desire to just leave them alone. And now there's a bluray release. And guess what? The original trilogy gets more revisions. A formerly silent Vader who wordlessly turns on his master at the absolute climax of the film in Return of the Jedi now screams ""NOooooo!!"" while doing so. Why? Why, George? Sure, it's his to do with as he pleases. But I think if Leonardo da Vinci was alive today and wanted to redo the Mona Lisa every couple of years, eventually the Louvre might tell him that with all due respect, sir, you're making a fool of yourself. I know I don't have to buy these films if I don't want to... and i don't. I would have liked to have heard a better sound and seen sharper visuals than the rather poor 'original versions' released as an afterthought / limited edition in 2008, but if I'm asked to pay yet more money for butchered version of the original trilogy and the prequels I hate then... I simply won't.

However, the real problem with this set is that they continue to tinker with the dramatic stuff. Remember when Han shot first? That established him as a rogue who wasn't afraid of cheating to win a fight. Making Greedo shoot first, was awkward in how it was done, as well as confusing. It also changes Han's character.

Same with the cheesy ""NOOOO!"" for Vader. The silent mask watching Luke die allowed the audience to interpret what was going on in Vader's head. You could almost see the gears turning in his brain.

By having him say ""Noo. NOOOO!"" you rob the audience of that great moment of film.

Ever since the prequels its like Lucas feels everything has to be spoon fed to fans. All three prequels it went like this:
First the characters say what they're going to do.
Then they do it
Then they explain what they just did.

Nothing is open to interpretation, which takes away the impact of the films.

I think that for a lot of us star wars fans, we just wanted to see the movies we saw as kids. There are some pretty horrible changes he made in original re-release. As a prime example, and the one that's probably been discussed the most: Han shot first, it an intrinsic part of his character development in the first film. Shooting in retaliation makes him far less of a 'scoundrel'.

There were other additions that I didn't mind. Like fixing some of the SFX stuff, cleaning up the audio, addition of a couple of deleted scenes(Jabba at the Millenium Falcon). Things they were unable to do with the tech at the time. Those added to the movie rather than take away from it. It's the major structural changes, like Han shooting first, and now adding ""Noooooo""(one of the most ridiculed parts of the prequals) to what I formally thought was one of the best scenes in the film, that are so infuriating.

The scene was so emotionally powerful before with Vader's silence. With no facial expression, they were able to convey the emotional turmoil of watching his son being killed by the Emperor. The added dialogue makes the scene seem so melodramatic.

Realistically though, we knew Mr. Lucas couldn't help himself from tinkering with the films even more.  BUT, with the changes he has added now, he's gone too far.  There are silly CGI additions that create continuity errors (R2D2 hidden in a pile of boulders now) and over-the-top audio changes (Krayt dragon, etc.).  The killer though, is the addition of NoooOOOoooOOo.  This scene was probably one of the most important moments in the entire saga.  Vader's silent actions sent chills down your spine.

7221793,1,B00YI71PN2,"I am very angered by this whole thing about George Lucas putting all 6 films of the original trilogy and the prequel on Blu-Ray instead of regular DVD, with the deleted scenes (which I wanted to see of the deleted scenes anyway -- I already have all 6 films on regular DVD, original trilogy on THX (1997 version) as well as 2004 version of original trilogy with the original theater releases of 1977, 1980 and 1983 movies on DVD (the ORIGINAL WAY it was meant to be).

What really bugs me BIGTIME is that why Lucas wanted to bring them all out again on Blu-Ray and to make it more realistic than before. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix""...that is the addage that should be used by Lucas on this. When I heard of the new changes and added audio and other tweeks to it, I was very livid, even though I don't have a Blu-Ray player and don't want one at this time because they are so expensive and there are very few movies on release as Blu-Ray anyway. If George Lucas had smarts, which he does, he should have produced the movies again on regular DVD and to make them available as a package for both DVD and blu-ray, so that people will have a choice to buy either version. But since it is on Blu-Ray, then with the added tweeks etc that he added in there and replaced, then being the actual STAR WARS PURIST as I AM, then it makes it all the more to NOT buy this release when it comes out on September 16 2011.

What George Lucas did, really destroys his original vision of the story and the saga as it goes on and continues today in books and novels. I have read all of the novels and books that lead after the original triology ends, right up to the current series ""Fate of the Jedi"" series -- with 2 more hardback books, one I am reading now ""Ascension"" and the other book ""Apocalypse"" coming out in April 2012...who knows if the Star Wars saga will continue after that.

Like I said before and will say again, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix"". Don't fix the original...it is set in American cinema history forever, and I think that Darth Vader himself will tell you ""Nooooooo"" only once, which that is in the original ""Return of the Jedi"" scene at the 2nd DeathStar. The added yell and cry is not in the original trilogy version and not in the 1997 and 2004 versions. Why did Lucas put that in there, I will never know. It defeats the purpose why we watch movies and escape to worlds that are not our own.

Please do not buy the Blu-Ray version of this on September 16 2011...if you are a pure Star Wars fan like I am, then save your money and use it for things that mean more than just to see mistakes being added to an original classic, and i really do mean ORIGINAL.",1314835200,23,2668,4.235756385068762

7221797,1,B00YI71PN2,"Revising film history should be a crime.

As many other reviews have stated, Lucas has once again tinkered with his once classic films to make them more ""thematically complete"" with the terrible prequels. In yet another stupid change, Vader now yells ""NOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" when he throws the Emperor down the shaft at the end of Return of the Jedi. He does this to match up with the end of Revenge of the Sith, which was one of the most comically awful moments of the entire prequel trilogy, which is saying something. This does not add anything. Instead, it turns a powerful, cathartic, climactic scene into one that is on the nose and inert and now brings to mind the hilarious terribleness of the end of Episode III. It's a joke. It is borderline blasphemy and very much in line with all of the other awful changes Lucas has made to these films over the last 14 years.

And there are some other, minor changes that are just annoying and serve no purpose. They all seem small and silly by themselves, but they add up. It's gotten to the point where it's barely the same trilogy anymore.

The real point is this: Yes, George Lucas created and owns this franchise. Yes, he is technically and legally allowed to do whatever he wants with them. But he shouldn't be allowed to. The original versions of these movies are some of the most important films ever made. They have changed people's lives. They revolutionized special effects. They are culturally significant works of art. They are a testament to the power of the medium of film as a whole. And George Lucas has taken those movies away and replaced them with these bastardized versions that are objectively worse in just about every way. NO ONE, not even the creator/owner of said work of art, should be allowed to do that.

Star Wars coming out on blu ray should be a very happy occasion. Instead it's a very upsetting one.",1314835200,25,1874,4.6017964071856285

Lucas try to remember again, movie making and Star Wars as you said before, is not a one man work. It was a collaborative effort and the input of all those great people, made it great. Star Wars is not great just because of you. YOU DIDN'T MAKE STAR WARS.

Guess what? I'll personally start the next billion dollar payday for you if you just do what you know deep in your heart is right.

Luckily for us, the admirers and supporters of your original vision, there are preservationists and faneditors out there preserving what you refuse to.

ADYWAN to have to tell you this, but you're HARMYing your chances of anyone caring about your future endeavors with these actions. You have turned one of if not THE the pivotal moment in the entire saga into a laughing stock. We don't need Vader to vocalize. There is more emotion behind that black mask in those 20 seconds than there is any other scene in the entire saga.

For the love of film, heed your own words:

""My name is George Lucas. I am a writer, director, and producer of motion pictures and Chairman of the Board of Lucasfilm Ltd., a multi-faceted entertainment corporation.

I am not here today as a writer-director, or as a producer, or as the chairman of a corporation. I've come as a citizen of what I believe to be a great society that is in need of a moral anchor to help define and protect its intellectual and cultural heritage. It is not being protected.

The destruction of our film heritage, which is the focus of concern today, is only the tip of the iceberg. American law does not protect our painters, sculptors, recording artists, authors, or filmmakers from having their lifework distorted, and their reputation ruined. If something is not done now to clearly state the moral rights of artists, current and future technologies will alter, mutilate, and destroy for future generations the subtle human truths and highest human feeling that talented individuals within our society have created.

A copyright is held in trust by its owner until it ultimately reverts to public domain. American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history.

People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as ""when life begins"" or ""when it should be appropriately terminated,"" but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.

These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tomorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with ""fresher faces,"" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new ""original"" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires. The copyright holders, so far, have not been completely diligent in preserving the original negatives of films they control. In order to reconstruct old negatives, many archivists have had to go to Eastern bloc countries where American films have been better preserved.

In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be ""replaced"" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.

There is nothing to stop American films, records, books, and paintings from being sold to a foreign entity or egotistical gangsters and having them change our cultural heritage to suit their personal taste.

I accuse the companies and groups, who say that American law is sufficient, of misleading the Congress and the People for their own economic self-interest.

I accuse the corporations, who oppose the moral rights of the artist, of being dishonest and insensitive to American cultural heritage and of being interested only in their quarterly bottom line, and not in the long-term interest of the Nation.

The public's interest is ultimately dominant over all other interests. And the proof of that is that even a copyright law only permits the creators and their estate a limited amount of time to enjoy the economic fruits of that work.

There are those who say American law is sufficient. That's an outrage! It's not sufficient! If it were sufficient, why would I be here? Why would John Houston have been so studiously ignored when he protested the colorization of ""The Maltese Falcon?"" Why are films cut up and butchered?

Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.

I hope you have the courage to lead America in acknowledging the importance of American art to the human race, and accord the proper protection for the creators of that art-as it is accorded them in much of the rest of the world communities.""",1314835200,21,5813,4.820281124497992

It seems as though LFL with all their resources cannot manage to recognize and fix simple errors that they themselves created. These include inconsistent lightsaber colors, loss of detail in the blacks,and audio issues like the left and right channels flipping around and not having the music, FX, dialogue, etc. at the proper levels. There were mistakes made in these areas when the films were retouched for their '97 theater release and again for their 2004 DVD release. Officially involved members of the team who worked on this new bluray release have gone on record assuring fans the issues have been corrected, yet here they are in the bluray.

7221822,1,B00YI71PN2,"These latest scene changes are the final proof that George Lucas has lost his mind, however they are NOT the main reason why I just cancelled my blu-ray pre-order. I had been excitedly counting down the days until this release, but this time George/Lucasfilm has given the whole Star Wars community the middle finger by not correcting many of the problems (color) which plagued the 2004 release. This blu-ray has virtually all of the same issues as the DVD.  I'm talking about Vader's bubblegum pink lightsaber, the super high orange or purple explosions opposed to the more realistic white hot/yelow effects. These were especially noticable during the Battle of Yavin, Tantive IV shootout, and the carbon freezing chamber duel. They stuck out to the point to where they were almost distracting. After seeing the prequels, it's hard enough to still view Vader as that ultimate bad a** villian I feared in my childhood, but it's now near impossible to do it when he's chasing after Luke with a pink lightsaber.

Lucasfilm has been made well aware of these issues thru complaints made by ticked off fans since the DVD launched 7 years ago. Now in the last year of hyping up of this Blu Ray release, Lucasfilm has assured us Star Wars fans that our complaints had been heard and addressed in this release,  the Blu-Ray would NOT have the same color and audio problems as the dvd's, they went back to the original negatives and spent 3 years fixing these particular problems, they manually went thru frame by frame in the problem scenes fixing and making other color corrections to bring them close again to the original theatrical versions.

Heck Starwars.com displays a screenshot of Luke's fixed blue lightsaber on the Millenium Falcon in ANH, boasting about how they went back and fixed these problems. I have seen the Blu-Rays myself and I can confirm this is NOT the case!! Yes it is fixed for that particular frame and a few other frames, but the next shot of the same scene his lightsaber shifts back to green, just like in the screwed up dvd release, then goes to bright white, then back to a very pale blue color. Yes they fixed ONLY a small portion of that scene, left the rest of it untouched with the wrong color, while implying that the whole thing has been corrected. The lightsaber scenes in the other movies, Empire Strikes Back & Return of the Jedi, are practically UNTOUCHED WITH THE SAME color and timing problems that the DVD's have. It's like Lucasfilm is only willing to put in a half a** effort in anything they release anymore.... and why not?? If it says Star Wars on the box it's going to sell.

Now for the changed scenes:

A New Hope

- When R2-D2 hides in the shallow cave from the Sand People, there have been CGI rocks added in. The new rocks now cover up half of R2's body which makes him hidden better. However when he leaves a few seconds later, he just pulls forward and the rocks simply disappear!! Did they just forget to alter that scene too?

- Obi-Wan's introduction, he scares the Sand People away with a Krayt dragon call, has been redone again and now sounds like a jr. high kid making funny noises in Windows sound recorder. When I first heard it I thought no way, it's someone pulling a joke. It's sounds so bad and is so out of place, they made absolutely no effort to mix it in at all. You'll just have to hear it for yourselves... but sadly it's real. Unbelievable

- Greedo still shoots first. It is alot better than the DVD version.

Empire Strikes Back

- Wampa's arm in fixed. Looks good about time.

Return of the Jedi

- Jabba's Palace has a bigger door... ok?

- New CGI alien walking around in Jabba's palace as everyone sleeps. Poorly done and sticks out worse than a sore thumb... looks like Sebulba from Episode I?

- Ewok's now have CGI eyelids, blink, and sometimes make a clicking noise when they do. (maybe a tribute to Muppets/Fraggle Rock?)

- Darth Vader now screams ""Noooooooooooo"" as he picks up and throws the emperor, much like the way he does at the end of Episode III.... now twice!! This  ruins a great and one of my favorite scenes. It's bad. The voice doesn't even sound like Vader's and it's just lazily pasted over the rest of the audio.  Lucasfilm didn't make the effort to blend in at all..... what are they thinking????? If you really feel you need to add something like that, at least attempt a decent job.

This has just gotten laughingly ridiculous. There is no excuse this time for ignoring what the fans want and taking away more of the original magic the movies had back in the 70's and 80's. Besides the deleted scenes, this is not a quality release. I've cancelled my pre-order and I'm done with anything new to do with Star Wars. This includes the new upcoming 3d versions which will no doubt have even more stupid changes and conveniently opens the door for yet another Blu-Ray release. I have my unaltered copies on my bonus DVD and that's all I need.

I urge anyone who feels the same way to NOT fill the pockets of George Lucas anymore!! I don't understand how they think it's necessary tinker with new stupid voiceovers and Ewok eyes, but not fix the more obvious and distracting problems of this and the previous release. All the while Lucasfilm insinuated, just as recently as last week, that they had indeed corrected those problems..... THAT IS FALSE ADVERTISING!! They also claimed to have exhaustively sent this set thru 3 levels of quality control which is either another lie or Lucas has the most elite team of a** kissers ever assembled. I've defended the first two prequels, the Special Editions, and George Lucas himself over the years, but I'm done. For the first time in 25 years they will not be getting another dime of my money.

***UPDATE 9/9/11***

I've viewed the bonus content which the deleted scenes are no doubt the best of all the extra features. As for the Prequels, the previously released DVD deleted scenes are NOT included, so hang onto your old discs. The older movies include scenes that have been Star Wars folklore for years. Some are good and the quality is what you expect for deleted scenes cut over 30 years ago. However some of scenes I particularly had interest in, seem to be made from degraded alternate shots... since there are productions stills and video snippets that Lucasfilm released, over the years in different supplemental products, showing the same scenes taken from higher quality sources. On another note, the deleted ESB content shows the scenes leading up to and the aftermath of the wampa fight with rebel soldiers in Echo Base. The battle itself is completely omitted in this release, which is a shame since the battle scene was filmed and possibly finalized before it was cut from the final release. Luckily there are various stills of this scene still floating around and it was covered by Star Wars Insider years back. The rest of the content is very good and it's great finally seeing some of the other scenes... however after viewing I get the impression Lucasfilm is purposely holding back some of these materials for a future release.",1314748800,"2,861",7089,4.640861931364725

I wasn't even annoyed that much by Greedo shooting first or the horrible dance sequence in Jabba's Palace. But this is my last straw. When is well enough good enough. The scene where Vader kills the Emperor were pitch perfect and now all is ruined for the sake of throwing some poorly delivered lines into the mix. It even kills the fantastic music that John Williams created years ago by mucking it up with garbled yelling.

Ewoks blinking is cool and fine. I'll even accept Obi Wan sounding like a Bruce Lee wannabe when scaring away Tusken Raiders, but this is final scene is unacceptable.

The only thing that can redeem this set, the saga as a whole, and my faith in these once great movies is a re-release of the original trilogy, with cleaned up visuals (no added scenes or effects, just a clean print) and 5.1 audio.  Lucas has to be sitting on this because the mid 90's widescreen VHS release was close to this very thing.

Such a shame.  Lucas should be taking a cue from the awesome Blade Runner blu-ray release from a few years ago.  That's how you pay homage to a piece of cinematic history.  Not with this heavily modified piece of garbage.",1314748800,25,811,4.366666666666666

Pretty much a perfect summary of what Lucas is doing, isn't it?  My plan at this point is to track down the originals on DVD or VHS and forget about buying any new versions unless Lucas finally sees fit to do what he should have done in the first place and release the theatricals on high definition.

One of the best scenes in Film history where Darth Vader is finally redeemed is completely ruined by the insertion of Darth Vader yelling ""NOOOO"" several times. It messes up the entire suspense of the scene and turns it into nothing but a joke. I don't want the next generation to grow up watching this version which why I urge everyone to rate this set 1 star.

Where he is wrong though is not including the original versions and remastering them for HI-def as an option. No other filmmaker has done what he has which is basically not acknowledging the existance of the original version. Yes these are his movies, but they also belong to us the fans because the fans support and love for these films made it the phenomena that it is. Sorry Mr. Lucas but I will not be ordering these. I'll stick to the laser discs.

You know on second thought all these changes since the 1997 Special Editions til now have only made them consistent with the mediocrity of the Prequels. I always believed that the Original Trilogy existed in its own parallel universe separate from the six episode series anyway. Sort of a ""Mirror Universe"" version of Star Wars which is fine. The George Lucas of 2011 is certainly not the George Lucas of 1977. So these new versions of Star Wars should be called Star Wars : The Rise and Fall and Redemption of Anakin  Skywalker which is the way Lucas sees these films as nowadays. The Original Trilogy should exist as Star Wars : The Adventures of Luke Skywalker which I believe was the original conceptualization of the series. This if I remember correctly was used for the original novelizations of the trilogy.

Darth Vader was always a much more interesting character when his origins were a mystery and only hinted at. This only enhanced his legend, mythology and aura which is why everybody loved this character in the first place. He was essentially a sci-fi version of the""boogie man"" . The Original Trilogy made him the pop culture icon that he WAS. Unfortunately these special edition versions basically broke down Dart Vader into something a lot less. Lucas essentially made him into some gifted and whiny kid who was screaming out for help. This is fine if that is what Lucas wants of course. But as I said earlier give the fans the option of which version they want to see. There is no reason why they cant both exist. It is a big universe anyway.

What I would like to see in an original trilogy Blu-ray set :

Restored unaltered versions of the Trilogy with cleaned up effects and Original sound mixes as an option.
Deleted scenes
Original Making of documentaries.
Star Wars to Jedi Documentary
Empire of Dreams Documentary
Return of the Ewok Documentary (Restored and Remastered)
Star Wars Holiday Special (Restored and Remastered)
Vintage Interviews with cast and crew
Audio Commentaries
New documentary on the Star Wars Phenomena from a 1970's early 80's point of view which includes vintage toy commercials, actor and character appearances on such shows as Donnie and Marie, The Richard Pryor Show, The Muppet Show, etc. and interviews with illuminaries and fans of the period.

He was a no good smuggler /mercenary that decided to finally do the right thing at the end of the film. I think we all get that by now. I have always been 50/50 on changes to the films over the years. Return of the Jedi was just fine the way it was. Changes was the Sarlacc Pitt conversation between Han and Lando. When Han is hanging upside down ready to shoot the Sarlacc Lando asks him ""Now wait I thought you were blind?"".....Han replied ""Trust me!"". That was the basis of their relationship. They didn't trust each other. That's how their relationship was left in Empire. Six years ago because they added more score to the sequence because of added elements and the line was changed to ""No wait I thought you were blind?'....Han's reply....""Don't worry I can see much better now!"". Once again this kills the character dynamic between their relationship. What is wrong with Lucas and killing his character development. Does he not know how to tell a story anymore? NOW fast forward to Blu-Ray. We do not need Vader explaining his position as he saves his son from being killed. The selfless act of destroying the Emperor to save his son with no words spoken said it all.

Outside of some innovation in special effects shooting he is a no talent scrub who caught lightning in a bottle by retreading other movie tropes into the sci-fi genre.

He's not worth your geek angst.  Grow up and move on to REAL cinema not the consumerism as art that Star Wars is.  At one time it had some artistic weight (unlike say BayFormers), which makes the current state of this franchise all the more pathetic.  Save your money.

The newly-added ""NOOOOO!"" as Vader stops the Emperor from torturing Luke is the worst change since Hayden replaced Sebastian Shaw at the end of 'Jedi.' The removal of Shaw from the Jedi ghosts was enough for me to never watch the Special Editions again.

As a fan of the original, unaltered Star Wars movies, I will have to make due with my non-anamorphic DVDs that were included as a ""bonus"" last time the individual movies were released. They don't look great, standard definition, zoomed-in to fill the widescreen TV, but to be honest, the hack has so thoroughly turned me off from Star Wars that I can't really imagine ever watching the movies again.

The Special Editions were cool to see in theaters in 1997, but I never thought at the time that the movies were to become a ""work in progress"" for the hack to continue messing with for every reissue.

Until now.  Because the new changes (especially the ""noooooo"" in Return of the Jedi, in what used to be one of my favorite scenes) bug me enough that I get to save $100 (or whatever) by not buying these Blu-rays.  Life satisfaction intact, +$100.

Edited April 2012 to add that I have now watched most of the content of the box, so I now have an informed opinion and not just a moral objection.  ...And my informed opinion is that I was right all along.  The picture quality of the films varies greatly (there are at least a handful of pretty atrocious shots throughout the six films) and while some of the extras weren't bad, most of them were pretty forgettable.  I will remain a non-buyer.  I'll be now sticking with the old 4x3 DVD copies of the ORIGINAL trilogy and the bonus disc from the box set.  (Empire of Dreams: great doco.)  For me, any pleasure that could possible be derived from the increased resolution of Blu-ray is rendered useless in the face of the decreased enjoyability of the films themselves.",1314748800,36,1148,4.48792270531401

The events that lead to Anakin's fall from grace were far better left to the imagination. Allowing the viewer to create their own back-story from the limited clues left in the original (good) movies, to employ their own imaginations, brings the audience in to the story even after the movies are over. So many questions unanswered added to the allure and the mythological feeling of the original (good) movies. And the worst special effects in Star Wars (calling it ""New Hope"" is dumb, it's ""Star Wars"") have more heart and soul and impact than any cartoon CGI green-screen nonsense Lucasfilms regularly barfs into our eyes. If you disagree, take a good, long look at yourself. You've moved beyond ""fanboy"" and into the realm of ""apologist."" Give us what we want, the original (good) movies, remastered in HD. Say what you want about the Ewok song, that scene showed closure for all the characters involved in the saga, the characters the audience had come to know and love throughout the series. Vader was vindicated, Luke realized his power, Leia and Han realized their love, and Chewbacca was all ""GrrrrgggggGGGGGOOOOOOWWWW!"" It had soul, it wrapped up the character-driven story perfectly over the joyous sound of singing space-teddy bears.

7221870,1,B00YI71PN2,"Obviously we are all upset about the never ending changes to the Original Star Wars trilogy, but here's the reailty we have to live with:

 - George Lucas is never going to release the original theatrical versions on bluray because he thinks they are flawed.
 - The next Star Wars release will be a bluray 3D version with all previous changes.
 - The best original theatrical version is the DVD set from 2008.
 - Lucas Films is not going to re-scan the original film negatives because all of their color correction work would be lost.

Now, here's my opinion:

 - George Lucas has fallen into the trap of perfectionism (trying to improve something that already works).
 - The prequel trilogy is not the best because he focused on the visuals, not the actual story/characters/dialogue/acting.

My recommendation:

 - I would buy the original theatrical versions from the 2008 set (episodes 4-6) because I would enjoy watching them more than a high definition altered version.
 - I would buy the bluray set of episodes 1-3 because those movies are mostly eye-candy action movies anyway.",1314748800,26,1084,4.8901098901098905

But what if a male artist lost all his mojo? What if age, increased estrogen levels and general senility caused him to go really bonkers?

How bonkers?

Say that Leonardo da Vinci decided to make improvements to the Mona Lisa decades after he painted it. Suppose he decided she should really have blond hair, or eyebrows, or a mustache, or show teeth?

That kind of craziness.

The kind of craziness that motivates a man to take a hammer to the face of ""The Pieta.""

15 hammer blows to the face.

And this brings us to this Blu-Ray Star Wars collection and what Lucas has done in this latest installment of defacement.

Once again he has proven that it is still possible to take classics of film history and smash their faces.

Here are a few old blows to the face:

A CG Han solo head move so that Greedo can shoot first?
Yep, still there, still insane.

Boba Fett's great raspy voice replaced with Crocodile Dundee's?
Yep, still there, still insane.

The end of Return of the Jedi showing Yoda and Obi Wan as old men spirits but Anakin as a boy?
Yep, still there, still insane.

New blows:

In ""Return,"" as the emperor is killing Luke, Darth watches and considers the conflict within him between good and evil. This a classic silent body language moment where David Prowse conveys everything we need to know in his body language about this conflict. This is a pinnacle moment in the series played perfectly.

Here comes the Lucas hammer: Now Darth screams ""Nooooo"" like a whining Annakin brat two times before he throws the emperor to his death.

I screamed ""nooooo"" too as the hammer blow fell to this film!

Another new blow:

""Star Wars,"" Luke has been knocked unconscious by sand people, Obi shows up on the scene and using the power of the force replicates the perfect scream of the desert dragon that the sand people fear. They run for their lives. A perfect scene. ""Cut, print!""

Wait, here comes the Lucas hammer: No more force dragon scream, now Obi just yells like an asthmatic old man who fell down a sand dune.

I could go on but why???

Why should we buy this trash, why should we sit by and let Lucas take everything good and magic away?

Why does he keep doing this!?

Why!!??

In the end the best we can do is complain to the world and not give Jabba another penny.

7221872,1,B00YI71PN2,"You know, I grew up in the 80's and the Star Wars trilogy was a deeply rooted part of my childhood.  I still enjoy the movies to this day, even though Lucas has not felt the need to release a nice remastered version of the films I grew up with.  Instead we get the special editions, which I basically accept with a 'grin and bear it' attitude.  But it seems with each release the movies see more and more poorly thought out changes added to them, which distance them a little bit more each time from the movies I loved as a kid.

That said, I was still somewhat looking forward to this set for its cleaned up audio, corrected color timing (which had been screwed up in the last DVD release), and some of the special features.  Well, my interest drove right off a cliff when I heard some of the changes that were made to the versions of the original films in this set.  Other reviews go into great detail about the specific changes, so I won't re-post that info here, but needless to say it completely killed my interest.  I'm not sure how some of these changes got past the 'idea' stage since they are laughably terrible and anyone in their right mind could tell you they were a bad idea.

It never hit me before at how legitimately frustrating it is that Lucas refuses restore the original versions of these movies for HD, or even a legit DVD release.

I'm sorry, but I draw the line here.

* Obi-Wan should get laid at some point.
* C3PO should be re-voiced by Mike Myers doing a Scottish accent.

* Uncle Owen should smack Luke around some. The kid is just asking for it.
* Jabba has legs now. OH SHI-
* Give Salacious Crumb a cool hat just like Lando.
* Have Boba kill an Orc at some point.
* Order 66 is really just the cue for Mace Windu's surprise birthday party. He gets a new light saber and a wallet that says Bad Midi-chlorian on it.
* An elaborately choreographed Wampa dance routine to the tune of ""One"" from A Chorus Line.
* Change the opening overture to Yakety Sax.
* Don't ever let Spock kiss Uhura again... oh... wait. Sorry. I mean, Darth Vader should never cry.

I canceled my Blu-Ray order after seeing and reading about the changes made to the films. He has gone too far this time. He has made a career out of releasing and re-releasing Star Wars, making unnecessary changes to justify a re-release while refusing to fix simple errors because frankly I think Lucas doesn't even watch Star Wars anymore. He watches a 10 second clip and signs off on the change and that's it.

I've heard apologists say, ""Well, no one is forcing you to watch the movies."" You're right. And so that's why Lucas will never get another $1 from me, and apparently I'm not alone.",1314748800,96,784,4.52112676056338

How many times can fans bend over before their a** is bloodied and raw?!

I stick to my difficult and final conclusion that Lucas has indeed lost his mind. It doesn't take Nostradamus to realize that he will never, EVER stop tampering with these cultural masterpieces, which I personally believe is open contempt for his creations and his fans.

I have my untouched/unedited VHS copies that look and work perfectly fine, and although I'm sure in his sick and twisted mind he would like to destroy every copy that doesn't fit his demented revisionism, mine is safe and sound on the shelf until the next viewing, unfettered by the madness and endless tampering of Darth George.",1314748800,55,1025,4.851428571428571

All this stuff wouldn't matter if there were nice HD-transfers of the unchanged original trilogy, but instead of doing this, the trilogy just gets altered into an incredible joke that was once the greates sci-fi saga of all time.

Isn't it bad enough he infected the planet with the dialog from Attack of the Clones?
Bad enough that he inserted Hayden into Jedi?
He is now replacing the puppet from Menace with the CGI Yoda from Clones and Sith.
This is the only move I actually approve of as the CGI Yoda looks much better.
Nope that's not it...to my surprise and utter horror he is adding the Darth Vader ""NOOOOOOOOOOO"" from the end of Sith to the end of Jedi.

Haven't you desecrated our childhood memories enough without adding that laughable ""NOOOOOOOOO"" to Jedi when Vader picks up the Emperor and tosses him into the pit?

I grew up with the originals in the 80's, owned all the toys, and had no problem with the Special Editions except for the awful and forced Jabba scene in a New Hope. Otherwise the digital matte cleanup, enhanced sound and picture, etc are all wonderful and don't change the great story one bit. The biggest problem with die hard fans of the original trilogy in my opinion is that they look at the movies through the prism of their youth and make it something other than it was. I made it a point to see the prequels with younger cousins when they came out because I knew I was far too jaded as an adult to recapture the magic of the first movies on my own. I see how they recreate the scenes from the newer movies with their toys, have plastic lightsaber fights, and I remember that these movies are timeless and meant for all ages. These were fun sci-fi space operas, not deep thought provoking masterpieces. Jango or Boba Fett, they are all awesome to me!

Taken as a whole, the Star Wars saga is our modern mythology. Its a story of betrayal, loss, and redemption and its gonna look great on my 42"" Sharp HDTV. Those complaining about the transfer being 4k I guarantee could not tell the difference unless they were using a screen above 50"" and even then the quality should still be fantastic. Giving this product a one star review because of a lack of matte lines and bad color and sound mixing just baffles me.

7221930,5,B00YI71PN2,"What people don't seem to realize is how badly the effects for the original trilogy have aged. Has anyone watched the original trilogy as of late. Does anyone realize how many different versions of the original trilogy exist with different dubbing on the stormtroopers and other minor characters. Lets not forget the versions with different camera angles that have aired in the US and UK. The theatrical and TV versions differed in alot of ways. On Blu Ray the movies would be unwatchable unless they digitized some scenes and that would take a major restoration of the movies which Lucas is unwilling to do. The simple truth is that the effects just would not cut it by todays standards. The only way we will EVER get the original released again would be if the original films went into public domain or if they simply decided to offer it as a premium or exclusive somewhere...but don't expect them to be remastered. Lucas himself is embarrased by the originals so why would he want them released. They were released with the 2 disk editions a few years back with existing masters and everyone still complained. Sure they were non anamoprhic, but the majority of us grew up watching this move in low resolution to begin with. Everybody here is complaining, but they still will buy this set even if they gave it one star. Best advise would be to enjoy these movies the way they are since the creator decided that these are the definitive versions. To be honest the alterations are a major improvement (except for the greedo scene, which I could live with)and only adds to the enjoyment of the films. As for the films being only in 4k instead of 8k makes no difference unless you plan to watch these movies on a 200"" inch screen. If you have a screen below 100"", these will do just fine. What everyone should really be complaining about is the packaging. If you love your discs, buy seperate cases to keep them in cause this packaging will destroy your discs.

As to the 4k transfer...this doesn't mean necessarily this is a bad transfer.  First of all, if the information is there in the original for a good transfer, less than 8k may be a waste of money.  Second, depending on the TV size, blu-ray player, and other factors, most sets might not even take advantage the full transfer size.  If there is more information retained in the original elements, that large of a transfer is a waste of money.  If the original digital elements of the first trilogy in it's native format is less than 8k, then it is a waste of money since there isn't that amount in the original elements and ""enlarging"" it, so to speak, to a higher resolution is like enlarging a bad photo, all of the difficiencies are still there, only larger.  What really counts....how it looks when you watch it.  A larger resolution won't restore what isn't there in the orginal negatives of the trilogy set, and it won't restore all of the lacking digital info of a lower resolution original prequel either. Whether or not the earlier scans in 2004 are insufficient for blu-ray, who knows, got to look at the blu-ray when it comes out. How does it look and how does it sound?  That's all that matters.

Yes, George Lucas is a savey business man, and yes he has held back before. I suspect most of us would do the same if we could make money like he does.  Yes, he does do some things backwards like offer his newer versions instead of the original which could have been offered as alternate endings.  However, there are many movies I have been disappointed with that have made their way to blu-ray and could have used all of the nice treatments like ""The Ten Commandments,"" or ""Wizard Of Oz"" which show what can be done.  If you want to see what can be done, get a copy of Criterion's ""The Red Shoes.""  The problem comes down to money, and it's always money.  The only studio to have the forsight to do the higher definition transfers is ""Disney"" who was envolved in copying all of their films digitally and cleaning them up since their first transfer of ""Snow White"" using Kodak back in 1987. This is because Disney films don't loose their attraction with age, and the company wanted to preserve it's heritage, evident by it's keeping almost all information about each film in their libraries. Most companies either don't feel it is worth the trouble since interest with their films dissipates with each generation who becomes only interested in newer films.

I personally believe every film ever made should be restored to the best it possibly can be by chemically cleaning up where possible, creating new film transfers, and then digitally scanning them with at least twice the 35mm resolution.  This should be done to preserve every film for future generations, and so the quality will be there should better techniques arise in the future to better improve the digital copies.  This desire will probably never happen because of money issues.

I have been disappointed by even transfers of more recent films to blu-ray.  Probably, as blu-ray becomes more popular, and costs of transfers become lower, this might change.

I suggest you wait if you are unsure.  Rent a copy  when it comes out or borrow one from a friend and see how you like it before you complaining.  You might be surprised at how good it looks or you might want to just stick with the same old dvd you own than buying a blu-ray that is going to disappoint you.

Along with this, there is an excellent article about the hows and whys of film preservations, the use of above 2k transfers, etc.,  and the decisions made at this link:

7221936,2,B00YI71PN2,"The thought of seeing the Original Trilogy on Blu-ray is an enticing one.  I already own the DVDs as well as the PRE-Special Edition laserdiscs.  I don't own the original movies on VHS so I don't think I have the absolute original-release versions anymore, but the laserdisc versions are probably pretty darn close.

Truthfully, the main thing I wanted to buy this Blu-ray set for was for the bonus features on the extra discs, totaling maybe three hours of featurettes and documentaries.  But I'm confident those bonus features will end up on the Internet eventually and I'm not concerned if they are hi-def or not.

Primarily, though, I'm sick and tired of George Lucas constantly tweaking these movies, especially the two he didn't even direct.  He's been making alterations to them for years, and it has become pretty obvious that he must never have had a clear vision for the OT or he would have settled on a ""final cut"" by now.  He's OCD or something, I suppose.  And the fact that he doesn't seem to have a clear vision of what he wants them to be, even after years of tinkering with them, leads us to believe that he's not such a gifted filmmaker after all.  The scripts for the prequels MORE than prove he's not a gifted writer.  He's not even a semi-competent one.  He just likes to play with his digital toys, that's all.

I'm beginning to believe that the original Star Wars trilogy was a success IN SPITE of him and not because of him.  He certainly didn't make them alone -- he had an army of immensely talented and driven model makers, effects artists, and film editors.  They deserve at least as much credit as Lucas does for the OT.  But he took all of them out of the picture for the prequels and relied on spiffy CGI to compensate for a dull script and wooden acting.  Sorry, George, but those films just don't cut it.  No amount of bonus content can make up for how terrible those movies are.  I've taken dumps that were more interesting.

I guess I'll just re-watch my laserdisc versions, because in those Han shoots first, there is no extra and unnecessary Mos Eisley or dewback footage, the original dialogue is mostly intact, the Sarlaac monster looks as it should, and Hayden Christenen doesn't appear in ""....Jedi"".

I love the OT but not enough to shell out any more money for yet another re-worked and re-tweaked 28-34 year old ""work in progress"", Blu-ray or not.

The rest of you who will buy the Blu-ray sets, enjoy them.  No doubt they will look and sound great.  But excellent movies like ""Star Wars"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" don't need the Blu-ray treatment to be enjoyed.

7221942,1,B00YI71PN2,"I have already commented and followed the thread of this title for a few weeks now. I decided to actually put in a review because after much deliberation, reading, and researching I decided it was worth the time and effort to put a one star review down in the hope Lucas and others involved will possibly listen to the fans. Perhaps if he sees 100 5 star reviews, 2000 1 star reviews, and poor sales he will come to the conclusion that the Ultimate Edition we are hoping for should actually be produced.

An ultimate edition worthy of my money would have the original Theatrical Star Wars Trilogy with at least a new 8K transfer. If you left the imperfections in I would be fine with that. If you wanted to make some of the small corrections like color, gamma, removing wires or the tracking squares I would rather you not, but it would not be a deal breaker for me. That's it, a high quality audio and video track with very few if any changes. No extra CG, characters or editing.
An ultimate edition should of course have the special editions
An ultimate edition could have any or all of the movies edited over again with whatever changes desired.
An Ultimate edition should have all major and minor interviews and specials pertaining to Star Wars and the involvement of ILM in regards to Star Wars
An Ultimate edition should have various convention and fan created content. I would love to see stuff like Ryan V. Dorkman
An Ultimate edition should have plenty of deleted scenes and bloopers
An Ultimate edition could have plenty of digital high res images from the movies as stills, production, ILM, etc.. etc.. I know you have them already since you have them in book form already, you just have to pay a few thousand to own it ;) (which if I had, I would by the way, yeah I am a fanboy!)
An Ultimate edition should have all extras from all the previous releases of the movie

Is that asking a lot? Sure it is. Is it possible, of course it is. Would fans be willing to pay for this? and how much? Di-hard fans would pay a great deal for this. The average person? maybe not so much. Would it be worth it for Lucas to create such an edition? Considering what other directors and companies are producing I would guess yes. My household has three generations of Star Wars fans, two of which would pay a great deal for this sort of edition. Sure we all have our wish list, and we have deal breakers which will kill a sale in a heartbeat. I think what I have outlined here is a bit vague but covers the scope of what I would like to see in an Ultimate Edition. Star Wars has impacted society for decades with the love of multiple generations still excited about the Saga. Sure many of us have issues with the latest three, but it's all part of the Star Wars Universe and I would love to see and own an Ultimate collection where I can see what aspect of the universe I see fit. George Lucas may want to remove the existence of the original theatrical release but it's those releases that made us fall in love with the characters and universe. We all understand you had a limited budget and created the technology needed to even create the movies in the first place. Many of us love them as is, as we remember them as kids and young adults. We can embrace your new versions if you also allow us to love what we grew up on.

7221943,2,B00YI71PN2,"As a lifelong recovering Star Wars junkie, I figured my final 'big' purchase (as I quietly retire from the SW collecting world) would be the medium defining STAR WARS BLU-RAY discs. After all the hype over the past few years, I feel sort of empty and not as excited as I should about these. I was beyond thrilled to get the DVDs in 2004, just to be let down by the lack of technology that went into them. After some time, they became just another collectible and sold off most of what I had (including toys, books, cards, junk, etc) while there was still a market for the items. It's pretty sad when I find the Family Guy Star Wars spoofs more entertaining (and crystal-clear visually) then my childhood memories of the original flix. The last round of films (Episode I - III) were embarrassing at best.

(Buzzkill Moment example: Darth Vader in Episode III, ""Nooooooooooooooooooo!"". Don't even get me started on the other 2 films. And you thought the Ewoks were bad....)

(Show of hands: How many people are REALLY holding their breath for the LIVE ACTION Star Wars television shows?)

I see the same trend with the Blu-Ray discs. Everyone excited and wants to see the extras, myself included, but do I want to spend $90 to do so? Looks like I might just wait until I see the set at a secondhand retailer for $50 or on Amazon for $25 in good condition. Over the past 30 years, I'm pretty sure I've padded Lucas' pockets with upwards of $300k in goods. What has he done for the fans besides rape our youth with subpar drivel and reworked classics? In the words of the classic The Who song, 'We won't be fooled again!'

I am of course referring to the Greedo shoots first scene (OK, the Jabba scene is also cringe-inducing). The reason the scene grates me is not simply because it changed a scene from the original trilogy but because it changes the character of Han Solo, specifically his endearing recklessness and shoot-first ask questions later personality.
I know we will never see that scene released on Blu-ray or even properly on DVD (the theatrical versions on the 2006 DVDs are cut from the LaserDisc transfer).

-Discs with these movies and discs with special features and other various

He (Walton Lucas) comes at you with his story that spans two generations of Jedi or heroes, etc. First is Battle of the Naboos then Our Clone Wars then Imperial Machine vs. Rebellion Allison. It is here where it all begins, until the next movies that is arriving later. Great sounds. Visuals of the kind children are amused and enthralled with, such as lightsabers and starfighters attacking the senses, figuratively. An entertainment.

You can put this in your cart, soon and immediately spend the money, and have this come at you in an entertainment sense, present day. Aggressive, fun imagination. This is Star Wars. George Lucas hate this.

The Force is not a person who needs to eat or feel tired, it is that that can what which powers the Jedi. Obi-Wan say you must do what you feel is right so then this tells your family that Star Wars is for helping know what is right and wrong like a fairy tale, but one that is modern and state of the art.

Just the lackluster protection of cardboard sleeves to guard the Blu-Ray discs.

However, from the pictures I've seen, the UK release uses a more commonsense case design (either a multi-disc BD case or slim BD cases in a box).

Using a case like this for a catalog title of this magnitude is utterly disgusting.  I've already cancelled my Amazon pre-order and intend to import the UK edition...assuming they don't adopt a similar, eco-friendly, junk-design cover.",1311638400,14,717,4.836065573770492

Some decent prints of the original theatrical version that does not have some kind built in flaw would be nice. I don't care about the dulled down Sesame Street versions that Lucas concocted in the 90s claiming it was how the series was intended to be made. I got mad when the DVD set I bought did not in fact have real anamorphic widescreen for these movies. I see it merely as a vehicle to earn even more money by refusing to release the version that fans really want. Hoping they will also buy the good versions next time around. Well, I will not fall for it this time. They fooled me by not giving me real anamorphic widescreen for the DVD box I bought the last time around.

Leave the CGI versions for the little kids. The grown ups want the good versions where Han shoots first, the background is not plastered with slapstick animals and where Sebastian Shaw in 20 seconds portrays Anakin Skywalker better than Hayden Christensen ever did throughout 2 movies. Even Jake Lloyd would have been better.

Dear Mr. Lucas stop ruining my childhood memories and just release the good versions Star Wars. The ORIGINAL trilogy! I don't care about those silly little flicks you made after that, and no sane person likes your ""retouched"" version. Just take the original negatives. If you intend to do anything with computers, make sure it is just to remove any possible dust or scratches. Put this on Blueray. Use the original sound. Don't add any dinosaurs or light hearted characters like Jar Jar Binks. We have been waiting for some good versions for far too long. Stop the shenanigans and just release a good version on Blueray, you got so much money from me already that you don't need to fool me this time around too!

I'd also like to add that the artwork looks horrendous. Why oh why can't they use the good original artwork? I mean I'd still buy it if it had good versions of the original films, but the artwork from the late 70s and onwards was just so much better than this.",1309219200,28,2087,4.47244094488189

In other words, if you're expecting the mind blowing digital resolution in many of today's fine Blu-Ray releases, you can forget it with this version of Star Wars. (One of the things that won me over to Blu-Ray was watching Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean at the local Wal*Marts. Not that the movies themselves were good -- the transfers were great.)

Instead they will include only the special feature versions with all of the unnecessary and distracting computer generated special effects that Lucas added years later.  If Lucas wants to re-write the films, he should re-shoot the entire movies.  Simply inserting a few minutes of special effects using the latest whiz-bang technology into a film made with older technology is completely distracting.  Furthermore the additions add nothing to the story line and are totally unnecessary.  Save your money until they sell a blu-ray release that includes the original theatrical versions.  Lucas did the same thing when the series first came out on DVD - he included only the special feature versions in the first release.

Now, I appreciate cleaning up the special effects from the first movie and in the others. I won't complain about restoration and fixing what time, technology and budget would not allow for. However, some of the deleted scenes and altered scenes not only were disappointing but truly sucked. The Solo-Greedo was the ultimate movie botch and pooch screwed not only the scene itself but also the character of Solo who later goes on to become softer. If any blaster was that random and clumsy I doubt a bounty hunter would carry it... Duh, Lucas: value NOT added.

Lucas's commentary about these being his movies and his attitude is well remembered. Word to Lucas: your success with your movies was made by legions of fans who paid to see them and bought your merchandise. Look after the fans that got you there. I somehow doubt George will read this. I hope he does.

Remember, George released the ORIGINALS on DVD already. I really don't think there will be any benefit to having them on Blu-Ray because with Blu-Ray will will see the original film in High Def which will make the quality SUCK....but only this time in Hig Def.

7221980,1,B00YI71PN2,"Is it really that hard for Lucas to swallow his ego and let the fans get the versions they know and love? It is a sad thing that someone who stood against the evils of the industry not only became that evil, but actually ended up as something worse. Purely capitalistic money-grubbing studios would at least recognize what their fan-base would love to spend cash on and accommodate. Here we have a man who can't publicly admit that he made a mistake. At least Spielberg released the original E.T. after he realized the idiocy of the ""guns v. walkie-talkies"" mess. So we joke about that, but Spielberg is forgiven. He's not derided as much.... At least until Indy 4, but that's another topic.

Lucas just can't get off of his high-horse. The original versions were demanded enough to get to be released on DVDs, and that was a massive teeth-pulling session just to get them there. (Notice how they were only considered ""Bonus Features"" on par with Making-Of shorts. *sigh*)

I am not interested in this collection. Just give me the original three movies, remastered audio and video for Blu-Ray, and I'll be happy. I think that's what most people would be pleased with. At this point, I have to say the best collection of Star Wars I've seen is still the THX enhanced VHS set put out in the mid-1990s.

Come on, George. Swallow your pride. Give the audience what they want. Embrace your original works, and most of your critics will suddenly go silent. Until then, you're just the Hollywood equivalent of the cranky old man screaming at kids to get off his lawn.",1308528000,20,1560,4.644927536231884

Regarding the original trilogy, when they restored all three films for the 1997 re-release in theatres, after the prints where cleaned, they scanned all three films at 4k resolution and then did the digital clean-up and additions. The BD releases are starting with the 4k remastered digital negatives.

7221985,5,B00YI71PN2,"There are always things that we love and things that hate about our favorite movies. There are very few movies that from opening scene to final credits that I've said ""wow, this movie was perfect, I couldn't find anything wrong with it."" Star Wars is no exception. I am sure that if you would ask Lucas he would tell you himself that there are things that he would have done differently, even after the 2004 revamps. I was born in 1980, so I wasn't there for all the hype and grandeur that surrounded the first three, but I have still been able to sit back and relax and have a great time being a part of one mans imagination.
The fact that this is coming to Blu Ray seems to be a sore subject for lots on here. I don't see what the big deal is. Blu Ray is just the next thing in video entertainment, so naturally, Lucas and all others that have a say in SW, just want a piece of the pie. I don't hear anyone going off on Short Circuit 2, Big Business and all the other terrible movies that should never have left VHS that somehow squeezed their way onto the Blu ray shelves.
I've heard people whine about the features on this upcoming set and I just have to say something, I've seen Star Wars more times than I can count and only until recently have I sat down with my popcorn and watched it with the commentary and I found it very interesting. Hearing the back stories about what they did and how they did it was entertaining, (here comes the big but) BUT (told ya) if you are not interested in the actors and creators story behind the films then you will NEVER spend the time listening to the commentary, so in short, does it really matter what is in the commentary? If you've never listened to it on another film, then you probably don't care enough to comment about it on Amazon.
I also have heard people caterwauling (huh?) about the fact that it will be out in 2012 in 3D and then quickly on 3D DVD, so why put this set out at all. Not everyone has or wants a 3D TV, so stop wailing about this release. Enjoy it for what it is: a long awaited collection of movies that have never been put together like this before. When it comes out in 2012 buy it...or don't, it's not going to make a difference. People who collect movies and are fans of Star Wars will STILL buy the 3D versions, even if they already have the many previous versions, yes that includes Phantom Menace special edition. (ha!) Oh, a quick side note while we are talking about EP1: STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT JAR JAR!  Look, I have no love for the floppy eared idiot but knock it off, he didn't ruin the movie, he was intended. Lucas admitted that when he first created Chewie, kids were afraid of him (I have no idea what is wrong with the kids in 1977 but I digress) and he wanted to make someone that the kids would like and NOT be running in terror of. He succeeded beyond his wildest dreams. The royalties alone from Jar Jar Binks Halloween costumes alone must have paid for his own Death Star. He is a story teller and a business man, wanting to make money. So, can we just stop going on about the stupid Gungan, please?
So, to sum this all up, go out, buy the Blu Ray Version. I am sure that it will be lots of fun, invite the gang over, have a Star Wars Marathon, watch Luke get his hand cut off, learn who Vader really is (spoiler), make fun of young Anakin, laugh at Salacious, Watch Vader get his hand cut off, root for the bad guys, watch Dooku get his hands cut off, spot all the errors, shout ""Han shot first!"", watch Panda Baba get his hand cut off, ask why Obi Wan is always bellied up to a bar, watch a Clawdite get it's hand cut off, show it to the kids and people who have never seen it before, explain the details better than 3P0 at the end of Return of the Jedi,  Hug a Dug, Bonk a Gonk and then watch Anakin get his hand cut off!!

I own lots of Blu-Ray discs from movies that date back as early as the 1920's (Metropolis) and I got to admit that Blu Ray is the next big thing in watching movies so I made this evaluation based on my personal experience: If old movies with B class reputation made it to Blu Ray and were completely enhanced in the shiny HD format, what would it be like having the entire Star Wars saga on blu-ray?

7222002,1,B00YI71PN2,"I really don't care about the video transfer rate and all that.  And I realize this hasn't come out yet.  But I can't stomach the idea of watching the series, coming to the end, and seeing a holographic Hayden Christensen.  I bought the last DVD versions that came out.  The whole time I'm getting more and more annoyed, not just by the random CGI dinosaurs wandering around, but by things that were changed seemingly with no other reason than to mess with fans of the original series.  George Lucas can say what he wants about ""this was how I originally wanted to do the series, but we didn't have the technology, and now we do, so here's some dinosaurs!""  But he changes other things inexplicably.  For example, the song that the band is playing at Jabba's palace, and the ""ewok celebration"" song at the end of the movie are both changed.  Why?  Who knows.  I'm pretty sure that if he wanted to have different music in the original versions, that was technologically possible at the time.  And then when you get to the end of the whole series, you're sitting there wondering what happened to the happy ewok nub nub song and then you have to look at Jar Jar's BFF, Hayden Christensen.  And why is he there?  Who knows.  They didn't replace Alec Guiness with Ewan McGregor.  They didn't replace old yoda with some sort of younger, 200 year old version of yoda.  I was so disappointed I had to put in the original version and rewatch the whole last scene, which sucked because it was the laser disc transfer.  But I guess that's all we're getting.  Hence the one star review.  On a side note, I also give Phantom menace a one star review.  Those of you who buy this set, look out.  I recently rewatched the Phantom Menace, and there's SO much more Jar Jar in there than I remembered.  Meesa no likee George Lucas.",1306281600,51,1812,4.460365853658536
7222003,1,B00YI71PN2,"Seriously.  The first three originals were great.  Every new product seems to get further and further away from that.

7222004,2,B00YI71PN2,"George Lucas has legal right to change his films after he makes them, but altering the original work we all fell in love with is lame. Especially when multiple versions are available on the majority of Blu-Ray discs out these days. Why not include the cleaned up ORIGINAL version as well as his new corny additions? sounds simple to me.

The people have spoken, and Lucas' failure to address this major issue not only tarnishes his already flimsy reputation, but reassures me that he simply doesn't care. All more the negative.

I'll wait a year before biting the bullet, but I hope I won't have to eat my words.

7222005,5,B00YI71PN2,I have been waiting a long time for star wars saga to come out on blu ray!! I do wish it had the old school versions on them.  Also it seems everytime  star wars is released on a new form of media they change the special effects.  I wish they would take there time on this and enhance the effects for the better.  The jabba palace song blows in the new versions!!!  The songs in general in star wars sucks. Not the john williams songs!!!  Also the one thing that wish they would add is Darth Vader killing Jar jar!!!!  That would be worth everypenny.  I think this movie set would have 5 stars on every review!!!,1305676800,4,612,4.170940170940171
7222006,2,B00YI71PN2,"There's not much left to say about the contents of this edition. It is rather disaponting.
Lucas is definetly testing the fan's patience and endurance in buying editions of SW, always with tiny modifications compared to the previous editions of the movies. A touched up effect scene, maybe a ""lengendary missing scene"", and a lot of mambojambo.
All I expect from these new editions in Blu-ray is a spectacular transfer, breathtaking sound quality.
About the lack of documentaries, it is obvious to me that Luca$ is saving them for a future release of 3D versions of the movies.
Another thing is this ridiculous campy cover! What the hell is that?
So, I guess I'll stick to my DVD editions a little longer. Maybe I'll buy the Blu-rays when they are cheaper.
This box-set is not worth what they are charging us for it.",1305590400,19,816,4.713286713286713
7222007,4,B00YI71PN2,"I had my doubts about this set at first, since the cover is much worse than the two trilogies separate, and a penny more.  But after seeing that it may have more bonuses, and possibly the chance to see deleted and alternate scenes, it may just be that we can see Han shoot first in HD.  Maybe it won't be in the movie, but it will be on the disc.

Also the chance to see the deleted scene on Hoth where C3P0 actually does something and leads some troopers to their doom.",1305504000,4,470,4.086956521739131

No.  All the 1 star reviews are from people who want the highest possible quality of the original content.  Content!  That's the complaint!  Clean the films up, make the sound better, but don't change the story.  Geez, it's tough to make some folks understand something so simple.  George understands it, believe me.  He's just got too much pride to admit his alterations detracted from the magic of the original movies, so you can't have those except in bad form.  But George is no dummy when it comes to money.  Would you leave millions of dollars on the table when it's right there for the taking?  All he's got to do is give the fans who built his franchise what they want.  Then he'll be a big hero.

7222010,4,B00YI71PN2,"First thing's first: unlike what some would say, I doubt this is a cash-grab with all the vintage programs on disc 9.

That said, being young as I am, Star Wars is Star Wars to me. I doubt i'll really be too convinced to enjoy the original theatricals(if they were included, which they're not) that much more than the Special Editions. Same movies; different cuts. Saying otherwise is like saying the extended version of LOTR, Beauty and the Beast, Harry Potter, etc are entirely different movies from their theatrical versions. I recognize the need to put out the theatrical cuts as an option because most fans want that nostalgic value(even though nostalgia *can* blind one's judgement, but not always), but as an aspiring filmmaker, I also see the artistic intent Lucas was striving for......that he would've done in 77 if given the chance. an artist is never satisfied with his work. Yes, filmmaking can be just as much an art as painting. And HELLO! The guy practically co-founded Pixar. Actually, Pixar's a spin-off of the old Lucasfilm Computer Division. Well, that's something done right. Yes, I am far from the type to attack any filmmaker just because I don't like a movie or a certain cut of a movie. I instead criticize the movie and try to think of ways in which it could've been better. I recognize flaws but don't easily get turned off by them, and I honestly don't like having to rush to the defense of someone because another person who knows nothing about the industry storms in and claims he can do better. Yes, I'm sick of the constant moaning that seems to be making a dent in Lucas's brain just about as much as Capitalists care about the common people, but I just move on. There's more to life.

I love star wars, but until I really see the theatrical cuts, I could honestly care less about them. Same great story; Same memorable characters. LOVE the scene where yoda tries to whack R2 with a stick. The non-CGI FX are still wonderful. I'm just tired of hearing the same complaints over and over again. If more people complained to this extent about government, America would actually be getting somewhere rather than teetering on the edge of a cliff.",1305244800,10,2174,4.673629242819843
7222011,1,B00YI71PN2,"Considering it won't have the original versions, this is already not a set that we'd all really look forward to that much.  However we already knew we weren't getting the originals.  But what makes this set such a sad 'cash grab' is that it lacks vast amounts of extras that we were promised by Lucasfilm.  It's missing Empire of Dreams (the best documentary on the OT), The Legacy Revealed (mythological and philosophical take on the saga), and several other very profound documentaries/features on the saga.  Instead we get some awful documentaries on the 501st Legion (the cosplaying fanbase) and a documentary on the mostly terrible changes to the OT in the special editions.  While the old making-of documentaries are included, as well as deleted scenes, these only make up several hours of the supposed 40 hours of extras.  There has been no word STILL on whether any additional work has been done to correct the issues in the 2004 SEs (such as color correcting, etc.).  It seems they've stuck with the god awful transfers from 2004 and decided not to spend a dime on upgrading them.  Look forward to most likely seeing Vader's pink lightsaber again.  On a final note, the box art is atrocious.  While this is very minor, it's strange they went with such a poor (and poorly received) art designs.  This set keeps getting worse all the time.

UPDATE:  The news of the further edited films made me edit my review score.  The SE films were already tampered with poorly but this has gone too far.  I'm utterly refusing to buy these sets ever.  My last sentence in this original review rang truer than I'd ever hoped or expected.  Stick to the previous DVDs, Laserdisc, and VHS tapes.

That's specs as in aspect ratio, transfer rate, format, languages, etc. And you know what? I couldn't find them. Maybe you'll have better luck searching than I did, but this does not bode well for what these discs will contain. You'd think LucasArts, or any studio, would be trumpeting that these blu-rays are prepared using the highest transfer rate available, that they're new digital ""prints"" taken direct from the masters, that this is the definitive version of each film...unless, of course, they aren't.

7222016,4,B00YI71PN2,"The thing you guys don't seem to understand is why Lucas MUST do this. Lucasfilm is an INDEPENDENT production company, which means he is self sufficient and doesn't rely on Hollywood for funding. He hasn't had any funding from Hollywood since the 70's. In order to maintain this independence, sometimes you have to ""sell your wares"" so to speak in order to fund the next projects. Filmmkaing is a hard game on level and for Lucas to achieve what he has in his career is nothing short of a miracle. He is the epitome of the self made filmmaking mogul. Something SO many filmmakers yearn for, but rarely if ever achieve in any long term manner. And he did it on one project, one story. If you've guys have been paying attention to what he has been doing you would know that he is prepping all six Star Wars films to be presented in 3D in the next few years. This is a time consuming and very costly endeavor. So, with such a massive undertaking underway, why in God's name would he NOW do an ultimate edition, which is essentially the final word? He didn't want to have the fans wait like they had to do with the DVD sets and he also needs the money to pull off all the future projects. So, he's basically compromising to try to satisfy everyone for right now and also get his work done. And you guys have the GALL to complain like spoiled brats! He gave you the original films on DVD when he had no intention orignally...what more do you want??? If you don't want these editions to hold you over, just don't buy them, but know you may be hindering greater work down the road. You guys are almost like investors in Lucasfilm every time you purchase SW product so stop whining and be patient, because TRUST and BELIEVE...there is INCREDIBLE MIND BLOWING stuff coming down the road for the future of Star Wars and when it's said and done, when the FINAL WORD is said...I don't think ANYONE will be dissapointed.

That way they can release a better version later with a better video format and with the features they should have included with this set.  Like they did in numerous VHS and then DVD sets.

All of you fanboys out there and purists to the original trilogy, don't you understand that if Lucas had the technology that he has at his disposal today when he made the original trilogy, they will look like what he has today?  Don't you understand that he is always looking for advancement of cinematic technology that will give the best freedoms for the directors, producers and studios to make movies with?  Don't you know that most movies use his production facilities to create and do post production work on their movies?  If Lucas did not listen to the movies executives when he created the original Star Wars trilogy what makes you think that he will listen to you?  His Star Wars Universe is his ""all rights reserved"".  Oh, yes, he will listen and take note, but it is up to him to do what he wants to do with HIS universe.  If you wish to purchase the blu-ray then do, then if not then stick to the VHS or DVD of the original trilogy and be satisfied.

If you fanboys and purists of the original trilogy did not listen to any of interviews that he gave and gives he has said that the way that the original trilogy stand are the closest vision that he had for them.  Who knows when new technology comes out that is better that what we have today do you think that he is going to revisit the whole saga and tweak it here and there to bring them closer to his vision for his universe?  Then we are going to have not only the fanboys and purists of the original trilogy and those of the new trilogy all in a tiff same the same thing over again, then what, boycott Lucas Films?

So go and and flex your freedom and purchase this wonderful set and join Lucas in his most complete vision of the Star Wars Saga to date.

7222022,2,B00YI71PN2,"There isn't much that I need to cover that J. Bongiorno didn't already go over in his fine assesment, but I just wanted to throw my two sense in for this absolute joke of a release:

For the price and the amount of time we have waited, the HD transfers better be stellar, because this $100 set doesn't offer a single noteworthy thing for a consumer to shell out so much moeny, other than a few 1 or 2 minute deleted scenes that aren't even cut into the flicks.

Why Lucasfilm refuses to listen to the fans who desire the original versions of Episodes 4-6 is beyond me. It's going to piss a lot of people off, and if they think they won't lose much money in the decision they are wrong, because I can tell you now that they won't be getting $100 out of my wallet!

Clearly I'm not alone here.

They don't even have to be on seperate discs, just make them flipper discs or on the same individual discs. Lord knows there is enough room on this set with the lack of documentaries and other content!

My other gripe isn't really a fair assesment, but it is more a personal opinion. I don't feel like the preguels are worth anywhere near the price of the original trilogy, so the set is a rip-off on that side of the coin as well, but like I said, that is just personal opinion and I don't expect everyone to agree.

Hopefully there will be some surprises we haven't seen yet, but my guess is this is a release that is planned to hold over die hard fans until the next big ""Ultimate"" set release. Knowing the fine folks at Lucasfilm they will bring the next set out to coinside with another film (or 3) and get our money again with their 15th double dip of these films.

I do love the originals, so I will drop $30-$40 on those.",1304812800,15,1722,4.2
7222023,5,B00YI71PN2,"These are BluRay discs.  They have more than enough capacity to do both original and special edition versions on one disc per film, and in the original widescreen format. Don't be surprised if one day, Lucas decides to release the original theatrical versions on BluRay.  Lucas is known for waiting to release different versions so he can milk his Star Wars franchise to death for every new shinny silver dollar he can rip us off for.

I am a major fan of all six movies. My digitally remastered standard DVD copies look great on a BluRay player and HDTV. The upscalling to 1080 lines is fantastic. They almost look like HD, especially during bright sceens with lots of color and details.

But since I got the BluRay versions, There is a very noticeable difference.  And I like that they are the special edition versions.  The HD picture is much clearer and defined, and the ""DTS HD Master Audio in 6.1 surround is breathtaking to say the least.  It is a vast improvement over the old Dolby 5.1 on the DVD's.  Although I am a bit surprised that DTS did not make it a 7.1 surround mix for their HD Master Audio mode.  But all that means is the extended Back surround channels are mono instead of stereo.  It still would have been better in full 7.1 surround though.

And now that Lucas has made his billions $$$, he sold his Lucasfilm company to the Disney corporation.  Disney says they will make another Star Wars film.  Come on people!  The series was great but it is finished.  And the announcement that JJ Abrahms is going to direct it, only means it will be a revamped dark version of the original with a completely changed history.  In other words,  JJ will kill this wonderful franchise with special effects and rock music like he did with the newer Star Trek movies.  He will turn it into a long video game for the kiddies.

It is over and done.  Let it live on as it is, but don't ruin it by making more.  Let Darth Vader rest in peace.  Disney is a great film company with lots of very talented people.

7222024,3,B00YI71PN2,"A long time ago, in a movie theater far far away, there was a film worth watching....
This is not it.

Ok, everyone knows that. The video looks great (considering the cameras used) the audio is suberb, and the original films are classic. I hate the graphic design and art, but that's subjective to a degree.
I think it sucks to say this is complete and not give the ""original"" cuts as much respect isn't that the whole selling point of Bluray? What about the missing bonus stuff?

I think one star is fair all things considered. Three of the movies are unwatchable (for me), three of them are very good but have unwanted changes. Bonus stuff is missing and I don't like the package or menus.

There are plenty of 5 star reviews for this set, I frankly can't understand that given how terrible 3 of the films are. And only one film of the set comes close to what I'd call a 5 star film, but it's more like 4.5.

SO let's see what my math says... for all the movies 2.25 stars and subtract 1.25 for the bluray bonus and packages. Actually I think I'd like to take off another star just because so many people gave this set 5 stars... but I won't.

Also if some dude can sit at home and fix up the original films on his home computer, I'd think they could at least do that. Should I have bought the Original trilogy set? No, I'm a collector and I take the good with the bad.",1304726400,27,1371,4.197718631178708
7222025,5,B00YI71PN2,"Finally STAR WARS is on Bluray, but is it anygood, well it depends if you let those minor tweeks get to you, and if you don't, your in for a treat! First of all, the packaging on these movies is superb, kind of reminds me of the packaging for the AVATAR Extended Edition, but better. The artwork that they used was awesome, each movie in the boxset has it's own distinct cover to depict a significant event in that movie! Alright down to the main course!

THE PHANTOM MENACE 4/5. Why give it a high rating? Because I think it delivers a very good story, and the character design, and tech is top notch, granted the Gungan's are very annoying, but other then that great movie, it tells Anakin's origin's, and it show's Kenobi's master, and then there is one of the most awesome villians in the STAR WARS universe, Darth Maul, unfortunately hardly in the movie though. And they put a CGI Yoda in this one, very much appreciated. And this movie looks very good in HD!

ATTACK OF THE CLONES 3.5/5. This has to be my least favorite STAR WARS movie, mostly due to the fact that it heavily relied on CGI most of the time, the story for the most part was good, I think it was critical to show, Anakin's, and Padme's growing relationship, and it was great to see the creation of the clones, and to see young Boba, and his father Jango Fett, Count Dooku is a pretty cool villian. The lightsaber duels fell short on expectations. And this movie looks even better in HD.

REVENGE OF THE SITH 5/5. The reason for my perfect score is simple. It connects the dots for Episode III to Episode IV, and it shows the reason behind, ""Anakin's Fall"". And if you read the Expanded Universe, and watch the Clone Wars series, it will show more of Anakin's dark, and rebellious side, the story in this movie is very dark, for STAR WARS standards, and is my second favorite STAR WARS movie, yes there is ton's of CGI in this one, but for good reason, this is the most violent one of them all, and the best looking in HD!

A NEW HOPE 4.5/5. The first STAR WARS movie, and it show's it's age in HD, but that's not really a bad thing, the amazing story is still there, and from what I have seen they have fixed most of the lightsaber coloring in this version, and it appears both, Solo, and Greedo shot at the same time, but that's not a big concern at all, that has nothing to do with the story, I think STAR WARS fans will be pleased with the HD treatment, this one got! Very nice looking in HD!

THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK 5/5. My most favorite STAR WARS movie ever, it's just so flawless, the battle on Hoth is still one of my most favorite parts in STAR WARS history, and Luke's training on Dagobah with Yoda, and realization for Luke, to find the truth of his father, and the astroad battles, this is such an amazing movie, and it looks fantastic in HD, and frankly, the updated special effects just compliment this movie! Very good looking in HD, this one is!

RETURN OF THE JEDI 4/5. The final chapter in the STAR WARS saga, and ends on a high note! This one tells the story Vader's redemption, and of the Rebellion finally defeating the Empire, the only flaw I see in this movie is the Ewok's, seriously?! Ewok's defeating AT Walker's, and Stormtroopers, that's my only problem, and now on to the very controversial ""NOOOOOO!!"" scene, yeah it seems strange at first, now I grew up on the ""Original Version's"" , but I can see why George wanted to make Vader show emotion, overall great film! And it looks fantasic in HD!

SPECIAL FEATURES 5/5. There a ton of special features, in the Complete Saga box set. You get deleted scene's from Episode 1-VI, they are awesome too, and you get, making of's, easter egg's, etc.

PACKAGING 5/5. As I said, the packaging is awesome, each disc compartment get's it's own art design of a significant event in that film, and the case is basically a hard cover book, just like the AVATAR Extended Edition, if you are a STAR WARS fan, and can look past the minor changes done, it's a must buy, but it would be nice if George added the originals in there, for purest's sake.",1304726400,,4080,4.366271409749671
7222026,5,B00YI71PN2,"For the Star Wars haters out there, get a life. We're finally getting all six Star Wars movies on Blu-ray and everybody should be happy. I just don't understand all of the hate just because a small group of rabid Star Wars fans who have a hard-on for the unaltered theatrical versions of the original trilogy just didn't get their way. If you don't like the ""Special Edition"" films, then go find someone else to complain to. For me, I'm thrilled.

To get all six movies in a boxed set is a wonderful find. The additional scenes, the upgraded special effects, who could ask for anything more. For me? I'll be planning to purchase this set once it's released. Sure, George Lucas has milked the Star Wars films for all they are worth and it's probably the only thing that he's guaranteed to make money on because there always be a demand for it. While the fanboys can all argue, moan and complain, you know that they'll also be in line to purchase this collection ... not that they'll admit to anyone else. For all of their moaning and complaining, they are Star Wars fans, after all.

For me? I'm just glad that these movies are finally getting a Blu-ray release and I'll be enjoying these movies as soon as they are released this September.",1304726400,5,1239,4.502222222222223

The only film from the Special Edition trilogy that doesn't make me want to take a drive down to Skywalker Ranch to punch George Lucas in the face is Empire I guess because there wasn't a lot of 'fixing' done to any major scenes in that one. Enhancing explosions and adding in some extra background set pieces to blend better with the new trilogy is one thing, screwing around with the actual film by moving actors into positions they didn't really move to in order to create illusions of a 'Greedo shot first' scene or Han Solo stepping over the badly obvious cgi Jabba the Hutt tail in order to get around him are just ridiculous.

This saga wasn't your idea was it? No? Ok then shut up and stop complaining and enjoy it for what it is.

What good is that superior resolution if A.)You don't have a device to support it or B.) You'll never own a set large enough to support it.

I bought, like many of you, the trilogy on VHS when it came out.
I then bought the trilogy again on VHS which had the gold and black box.

Hey George is redoing the 1st 3 films, and he re-releases all 3 with the added SFX which added intothe visuals etc, loved em, So we ALL buy that.

George makes the newer films, which all come out on DVD., then the 2004 box.

2011, Now this Blu Ray Box set, as many have said prior, does NOT include the extended versions, and the ""extras"" over 30hrs is on 3 other discs.

2012 is when the Extended Versions set will come out, and that leaves you with 2014!

Now many don't know what's coming out in 2014! And many are unaware of this little tidbit!

Even though i am one of the few star wars fans that prefers the special editions to the originals, the fact that the originals are excluded is appalling.  The fans that grew up on star wars and being star struck by it when it was originally released are now denied what got them hooked in the first place.  in 9 blurays, that's 450 GB of data, georgie boy couldn't fit in the originals?  that's a crying shame.

i own the dvd release special editions and even though i preferred the new special effects and the changes georgie boy made for continuity's sake, i also praised the fact that the original theatrical releases were on the dvd as well.  that means if i want to see the ORIGINAL star wars as it was first released, i can with those dvds.  i don't even have that option on blu ray and this is the definitive hi definition experience here.

Not a whole lot to ask, really, especially considering how well they would most likely sell.

If George Lucas wants to keep mutating his films beyond the point of original recognition, fine, so be it, as long as he offers the original theatrical versions along with his newest, spiffiest Especially Special Editions.  Otherwise, it's just a terrible rewriting of cinematic history that shouldn't be casually shrugged off with an overly simplistic ""They're his films, he can do what he wants.""

The idea of not finding room for the original theatrical versions in a 9-disc Blu-Ray set in favor of things like parody fan films is simply ridiculous.

7222040,2,B00YI71PN2,"I am one of those who saw Star Wars when it was on the Big screen in 77. Loved it. Loved it to death. Was registered with Lucas Films and got subscribed to the magazine Bantha Tracks that would come out every couple of months (this was before the internet). I had the bed sheets, the toys etc. I was a real Star Wars nerd and still continue to love them through repeat viewing.

I can't say the same positive thing for the sequels. The prequels were not only a bad idea but they were poorly written by Lucas and it shows on screen; none of the magic of the first three. Just lots of noisy special effects with no heart. The characters were over dramatic and bland. Anakin is a Brat. I really wanted to like the prequels but you can definitely tell that he did not get the help writing this trilogy as he did the other.

So would I buy the original trilogy again (I have the VHS and DVD versions)? Not a chance and this isn't because of the prequels but because I want to see the original trilogy the way I saw it in the theater. No weird creatures that look fake in Mos Isley. No Gredo shooting first and then changed again to both shooting at the same time. I want Han the way he was originally conceived. Of course Lucas won't remaster that with all the money he makes from fans, just the lousy re-dos.

I don't know of anyone that grew up in the 70's and 80's that like the prequels so maybe it is just for people that like the effects and lousy character development and a lot of fast cuts. People who like the prequels because they are part of the first three movies. I can't explain why anyone would call the Prequels entertaining. Messy film making with no soul. That is what Lucas has proved with the prequels and the last Indiana Jones movie.",1304467200,14,1751,4.2208955223880595
7222041,3,B00YI71PN2,"Having seen the films, here's my very brief updated review.

It's not as bad as some feared it would be (given that they're older transfers -- a route I still maintain was a cheap way to go). But it could still stand to be improved in a lot of ways with a new trasfer.

As to the films themselves:

1. There have been changes. Some work; some have caused even more fan contention. I'm one of those that actually wishes for more changes. I think TPM, AOTC, ROTS could stand to have major editing and fx work done to them. So put me in the camp of wanting even MORE special edition changes to both the special effects and narrative.

2. There's no original versions. Even though I prefer the SEs, I think fans should be able to get the version they grew up with.

3. Special features: Everything from the past DVD set should've been ported over. It hasn't, so hold on to your DVD copies if you want those documentaries. There are still features from the old videos that haven't been released on digital.

Hopefully, one day the equivalent of the Blade Runner or Aliens blu-ray sets, which contained all the different versions of the films (including new versions), will come out. This isn't the Ultimate Edition box set that fans had been teased with for years, and will not include extended versions of all six films. Additionally, the ""100 hours of new documentary footage"" fans had been teased with by Rick MaCallum in 2007 isn't here, which implies an eventual later set, likely in another 7/8 years.

In the meantime, the films look great, and this is the best version available for home viewing. Some good news: the grotesque puppet Yoda in TPM was (thankfully) replaced with a digital version that looks like Yoda. It helps TPM quite a bit (though, as I said, more is needed for that film).

For those who want to look deeper, take a moment to read about Star Wars' sordid history on video -- including the reasons four of the six films were downgraded in image quality -- on the site, The Secret History of Star Wars (in the article: ""Saving Star Wars."")",1304467200,"2,692",2060,4.518817204301075

7222049,2,B00YI71PN2,"This will not include the original theatrical versions so I can't see the point of buying a set just to get the botched 2004 transfers upscaled to HD. Darkened picture, blue tint, pink lightsabers and all film grain smoothed out. The movies now look like they were shot on HD video a few years ago as they are very unfaithful to the original look and contrast of pretty much any previous version, including the 1997 Special Editions. In my opinion, they are one of the worst home video transfer of any movie. On the other hand Episode 1 will feature a brand new transfer. Yeah, great the movie that visually already looks the best (only prequel that was shot on 35mm film) is getting the most attention.
The only reason I'm not giving this one star is because 3 of the discs will be for extras including deleted scenes from the OT that have never been released before. I definitely want to see them but I can't justify even amazon's price of $90 just to see 3 bonus discs. We all know any stores along with Netflix and your local library if they carry blu-ray will have these. It will be very easy to just rent them.
The 2004 bonus disc was never officially sold by itself but it can be found here for a very low price. I suspect something similar will happen with the extras from this release.

And given that this set is so expensive and doesn't have the movies any of us really want, I suggest people for once don't buy something just because it has Star Wars on the box and vote for a restoration of the original versions with your wallet. LFL has already admitted this won't be the long desired definitive set as there is too much being discovered everyday in their archives for them to have everything completely prepared. If this set does not sell as well as hoped, it will probably be a lot easier for LFL executives to convince George Lucas to restore the theatrical versions and finally give us what we want the most.

I used to consider myself a die-hard Star Wars fan over a decade ago. That was before the phantom poo poo...

The Special Editions were fun... but they were just that: Special Editions... NOT the originals. Sorry, George, you may have created the idea of Star Wars, but I'm of the mind that if it wasn't for the amazing creative crew behind you, the Star Wars films would never have flown. You owe it to them to show the world their hard work that helped make you famous. Those old effects were the gold standard at the time, before all the CGI. Let me write this again: those old effects are NOT obsolete, they are simply of another time. Another age of cinema that should not be forgotten.

There is NO reason to not include the originals. Even Ridley Scott and James Cameron and Peter Jackson release both versions of their films for THEIR fans.

You'll only get my money once you finally give in and give us the originals people grew up with.

********************* 2015 UPDATE ***************************

What's the matter Disney ? You own this stuff now... Why not maximize sales by releasing something George Lucas HIMSELF never released before you purchased his franchise: The original unaltered trilogy on Blu-ray...",1304035200,34,1234,4.797169811320755
7222053,4,B00YI71PN2,"So I just got done reading about 10 reviews from the ""1"" star section. It's amazing that these people can take one thing that they see, base an entire opinion on it, and then write a review. I see a lot of whining...""Han shot first""...""1:33 format""...""There will be another release in six months, and I'll have to buy that""...

First off, it hasn't been released yet! Do you really think that amazon.com has all the answers? and knows all information? NO! For anybody to think that Lucas would release the Star Wars films in the best format that we have ever seen, and do it in fullscreen format? Come on. Obviously that was some sort of misinformation or typo. It just wouldn't make sense.

I can understand the people who want their untouched orignal films, to a degree...When Lucas revised the original Star Wars films back in 1997 with the ""Special Editions"", his primary goal was to prepare us for the prequels he had yet to release. With the advancement in technology, trying to fill a 30 year technological gap is a difficult task, even with the CGI that was available in 1997. Bringing an old film up to the standard of todays films, and trying to make it look seamless, is almost impossible. But, to the best of their ability, and also probably trying to predict the future of multimedia, Lucasfilm took a leap and cleaned up the films. Watching ""A New Hope"" on DVD, with an upscaled player almost looks as good as a bluray would. The picture is crisp, clean, bright...almost looks like it was shot less than 15 years ago, almost. For the audiophiles, we received a 5.1 Dolby surround mix. So who wouldn't want to view their precious Star Wars films in top notch quality? Well, apparently Han shot first.

Personally, I think the ""Han shot first"" complaint is the only legitimate alteration complaint of all three orignal films. What else can you really say ruins the films? There wasn't any other plot altering changes to the films. Everything else is just CGI alterations or recreations, panning the camera to left just to see what's walking around, making explosions look better, and making the films blend with ""prequel"" standards. But when I really think about it, does this one scene really change the experience of the ENTIRE film? Not really. I'm not happy with the change. But to trade off all of the enhancements that made the films better just for one stupid scene? I don't see the logic.

Making something future proof is next to impossible also. Somebody once said to me, ""Don't buy bluray's if you already have the DVDs, next year there will be greenray"" Well, buying things is what makes people happy, and it also makes an economy. Could Lucas re-release the box sets over and over? Yes, and he probably will. But so what? If you look at the DVD releases of the original films, there was 3 of them. A 2004 release was the first for DVD, 2006 which included the orignal uncut films, and another 2008 release which is just for marketing. Just because another release comes out, doesn't mean that you have to buy it, and it doesn't mean that it's any better than the last one.

So remember, Lucas is human too. He's made mistakes, and he'll probably make more. But if your not smarter than the corporates, you're not any better than they are.",1303430400,88,3263,4.6286701208981

Because Lucas vision is complete, regardless of his alterations, which were his original intentions anyways.

7222056,1,B00YI71PN2,"It's simple: I am a huge sci-fi fan. I understand the mind of a sci-fi fan. When great, iconic stories are created, like Star Wars, those who own the rights to these franchises cannot release updated packages and NOT include ""original"" uncut or unaltered version too (ESPECIALLY since Blu-Ray hold so space, they could fit all the original Star Wars movies on 1 single Blu-Ray disc 3 times over! if they wanted to...)

Again, the problem is simple: If original, fan favorite versions are NOT included, I would consider this release a ""money-making"" scam. A popular marketing tactic employed by MOST (not all) major studio's and intellectual property owners of franchises these days. Most likely, a newer, better version of this package will be released years from now, essentially screwing anyone who bought this inferior package. No thanks George, you can keep your ""avatar wanna be"" marketing to yourself...",1303084800,18,909,5.100671140939597
7222057,5,B00YI71PN2,"I find it very hard to see so many folks give things that haven't even been released a bad rating, as this very product has. Unless there is a serious technical issue or you don't like the film at all, there is no reason to place a review, but don't do that before you watch it. It may be one of the most familiar movie series ever, but that doesn't mean if you've seen it you should be leaving a review here until you've watched this specific edition.

To clarify the special edition that this product is claiming to be, without the originals (1977 to 1983) to many peoples dismay, few seem to realize that George Lucas himself was never content with what he had available when he first made the original three films decades ago. He was very limited, and he hoped to one day make his imagination more of a reality. That dream came true in the late 90's when he made the special editions and re-released them. After many complaints of people who were very attached to the originals, and to show how much he cared about the preservation of its cultural heritage, he had to release the originals alongside the specials. Frankly, I prefer the specials; they are what the original creator wanted to do in the first place, it's more attractive, and makes the depiction of the Star Wars universe more vivid. But personal opinion aside, it's not right to leave reviews for a product that has not come out yet. If it wasn't for Star Wars, most of all other science fiction that followed wouldn't exist, aside from a few classics. At the very least, sci-fi would be a lot different these days. If anything, the constant updates and the special editions have strengthened the franchise to show newer generations what true science fiction is, and can be.

That's not to say George Lucas was without opinion about the alteration of original films. In a congressional speech in 1988, George Lucas himself, with other directions such as Steven Spielberg and Woody Allen, spoke out against the alteration of original art in film and how technology and the industry as a whole does not protect original works. This is a very powerful speech by George Lucas himself. Keep in mind while reading though that it's not countering what he later did to Star Wars, as he himself, the creator, altered his own vision, and still had the dignity to release the originals alongside them, which many creators will not due if a film is altered or remade:

""My name is George Lucas. I am a writer, director, and producer of motion pictures and Chairman of the Board of Lucasfilm Ltd., a multi-faceted entertainment corporation.

I am not here today as a writer-director, or as a producer, or as the chairman of a corporation. I've come as a citizen of what I believe to be a great society that is in need of a moral anchor to help define and protect its intellectual and cultural heritage. It is not being protected.

The destruction of our film heritage, which is the focus of concern today, is only the tip of the iceberg. American law does not protect our painters, sculptors, recording artists, authors, or filmmakers from having their lifework distorted, and their reputation ruined. If something is not done now to clearly state the moral rights of artists, current and future technologies will alter, mutilate, and destroy for future generations the subtle human truths and highest human feeling that talented individuals within our society have created.

A copyright is held in trust by its owner until it ultimately reverts to public domain. American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history.

People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as ""when life begins"" or ""when it should be appropriately terminated,"" but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.

These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tommorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with ""fresher faces,"" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new ""original"" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires. The copyright holders, so far, have not been completely diligent in preserving the original negatives of films they control. In order to reconstruct old negatives, many archivists have had to go to Eastern bloc countries where American films have been better preserved.

In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be ""replaced"" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.

There is nothing to stop American films, records, books, and paintings from being sold to a foreign entity or egotistical gangsters and having them change our cultural heritage to suit their personal taste.

I accuse the companies and groups, who say that American law is sufficient, of misleading the Congress and the People for their own economic self-interest.

I accuse the corporations, who oppose the moral rights of the artist, of being dishonest and insensitive to American cultural heritage and of being interested only in their quarterly bottom line, and not in the long-term interest of the Nation.

The public's interest is ultimately dominant over all other interests. And the proof of that is that even a copyright law only permits the creators and their estate a limited amount of time to enjoy the economic fruits of that work.

There are those who say American law is sufficient. That's an outrage! It's not sufficient! If it were sufficient, why would I be here? Why would John Houston have been so studiously ignored when he protested the colorization of ""The Maltese Falcon?"" Why are films cut up and butchered?

Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.

I hope you have the courage to lead America in acknowledging the importance of American art to the human race, and accord the proper protection for the creators of that art--as it is accorded them in much of the rest of the world communities.""

As you can see, just any special edition is not a worthy successor to an original. I originally found this at this site, [...] , to cite my source. To the authenticity, I will say it's probably quite real, but this site tries to use it as an argument against Star Wars special editions all together, however it's quite biased and should be taken in that respect. But again, Star Wars was originally conceived and made a reality because of George Lucas. Despite who worked with him on the originals and who weren't around to help with the specials, or whomever didn't agree with them when we created them, he did in fact do it himself, which is more than what many movie ""re-designers"" have done in the past. He didn't deface his own film, but simply improved what he wanted to do in the first place.

Do the creator a favor, and a favor to the future readers of a product that isn't even out until September 2011, and review intelligently, when you actually experience the product yourself. I'm leaving this review to boost the rating of a product that, unless there is serious technical, hardware, or packaging issues, shouldn't have such a low rating, especially before it comes out.

That said, I'll definitely pre-order this. Can't wait!",1302912000,15,8207,4.775035260930888
7222058,5,B00YI71PN2,"I have been a Star Wars fan (like most of us here) for far too many years.  To me, it was a wonder why Lucas waited as long as he did to release this on Blu-Ray.  My guess is that he was thinking his own innovative technology might come up with a means by which he could slide it past Blu-Ray!  The fact is this medium is the best at this time.  Lucas was no doubt content and probably gave in, not for the money, but he felt his fan base deserved to see the movies the way they were meant to be seen.  Having seen TBS parade these versions recently should be incentive enough for the purchase (like any Star Wars fan has to even think about it!... OK, COSTCO may have it cheaper later this year...)... my thought is this.  I first saw Star Wars in a theatre when I was 18... I will never forget that day.  Ever!  This would not only be a necessary addition to any home theatre collection... but few movie collections have ever inspired this much feedback from such a diverse fan base.

1)  Include both the original and the updated versions.  I want to watch the movies of my youth as I saw them, not as they would be if they were created today.

2)  Don't ever, EVER change the story line.  Don't replace the FBI guns with walkie talkies (in E.T.), and don't try to turn Han Solo into a prince by making Greedo shoot first.

In short - I will NEVER buy these movies unless they include the originals as well.  If all of you would stand up and do the same thing - Lucas would HAVE to cave in.

Of course, then he couldn't release 8 different blu-ray box sets over the next 8 years, getting suckers to buy the same movie over and over again.

I am going to wait for the Blu Ray produced in a manner which does credit to the 3 first iconic Star Wars films.
  My children attended a corespondent school so it was up to me to make sure they were exposed to American culture.  The first time they watched Star Wars on a vhs the kids thought Han Solo was really cool because he learned to trust and changed. My son went around being Han Solo alot more often then he did Luke. But I think it was more to do with the owning a sweet spaceship and a dog that can walk and talk then the redemption of Han's character. But when they saw it again altered; Leia comes off looking totally like a PMS freak for hating Han as he really isn't that bad a guy. He just comes from a poor neighborhood. And the scene of Han walking on Jaba's tail is totally not real as this guy surrounded by body guards is going to put up with that kind of disrespect. I really takes the edge off these two bad guys. So I too am going to be on the long waiting list for George to get it right.

Will I buy these on blu-ray? No. Not without the original versions. I have the originals on DVD--and even threw out the ""enhanced"" versions, in favor of the ones I saw when I was a kid.

So, until Lucas changes his mind (what little there is of it--he's a nut, if you ask me), I will not migrate to blu-ray for these inferior versions--even if they are on blu-ray. I'll stick to the old tried-and-true versions--where Han shot first--and YES, I care about that, because having Greedo shoot first totally alters Han's image--for the worse.

I'm not going to get into the ORIG VS SE arguement...I have both versions and I'm fine with that.  Nevertheless, all I'll say about it is this.....George made mention, more than once, that certain effects, etc, were NEVER the way he wanted them.  So, if given the chance to ""go back"" and ""fix"" things, why wouldn't he?!?  Bands/recording artists don't release their ""demos"" and go ""HERE YA GO!""

I have basically just enjoyed reading the posts, 'reviews' (because apparently you already have them) and comments that are in response to the posts and 'reviews'. To say the least, it has been fairly comical reading, like a Comic Con debate.

I was 7 years old when Star Wars first came out. I saw it for the first time when it was re-released before TESB came out. When Jedi came out, I remember how bummed we were when a lighting storm caused about 10 minutes of the film to not be shown. It was around the time that Luke took Vader's helmet off. I took my niece to all three Special Editions, just because Star Wars is awesome and I wanted to make certain she could enjoy them.

When my daughter was first born, we would watch the original trilogy while I was giving her a bottle or just hanging out. It's a phonomenal creation that should be passed from generation to generation. I don't own the Prequel (yet) because I just never really wanted to buy it on DVD.

Now, with this being said, everytime a new Star Wars format has been released, I have been ready to purchase. Why? Because I am a fan. I have been a fan, and I will continue to be a fan. When it was released on VHS, I bought it. When it was released on DVD, I bought it. When the Two-Disc Special Editions came out (including the original versions) I bought it. When the Blu-Ray complete saga is released in September, I will but it. Why? Again, because I am a fan.

I haven't seen the Blu-Ray versions yet, because they haven't been released. Apparently, a good amount of the people who have reivewed them have though. Please let me know about the 30 extra hours of bonus material. If you could copy for me, then I wouldn't have to buy the set.

One more thing I want to add as well. If everyone is really hard up about Han shooting first, then just blink when that part comes on, because it will be over when your eyes reopen. It doesn't matter who shot first. Maybe Greedo had a lazy eye that caused him to veer to the right. We don't really know his background story, he could have had a shaky hand. It's hard to say.

7222084,4,B00YI71PN2,"Odds are the info in question is in error somehow.  Either that, or whoever's deciding how this thing's being released is a complete and total idiot.

Think about it, Blu Ray is a high definition format, designed to be played on HD TVs-the vast majority of which by design have a widescreen format.  There is absolutely no reason for anyone to bother with the pan and scan process anymore, especially for a Blu Ray release.  Who can even hook up a Blu Ray player to an old boxy TV set anyway?  Why go through the expense of buying the player when you don't even have a set that can display the enhanced picture quality the new format allows for?

The only reason I can think of for them doing this is literally just to piss off fans. Another slightly more likely reason is that they may be literally ""cutting corners""-it's too expensive to upconvert and remaster the entire picture (but you'd expect George Lucas of all people to be quite capable of sparing the expense).  If they're smart they'd still consider that they'll end up losing more money from a releasing a full screen-only version than they would from having to make a bit more of the picture HD.

This said, while I wish they'd include so little as a remastered standard definition version of the original original trilogy with 5.1 surround-I'm not terribly bothered by most of the Special Edition changes/additions, aside from maybe the music video bit in Jabba's Palace in RotJ.",1298505600,6,1444,4.65748031496063

He used the same transfers used for Laserdisc, simply to try to quell the many who were upset -and to stop the *bootlegs* on sale for years. The films at least should be allowed to be seen on BLU Ray in the original format as many have clamored for online in campaigns (thank you thedigitlabits.com ) for years.

7222087,5,B00YI71PN2,"The best trilogy in MY opinion is the original trilogy (1977-83). The latest trilogy just completes the chapters and hopefully Lucas does not play (as in add any CG effects) with the Original Trilogy but if he adds some to the recent 3 it will work. I'm looking forward to it all, the movies, deleted scenes, bonus features. The thing to consider is that not all movies pre-HD era turn out as crisp as we would hope, a few i watched just looked liked their DVD counter parts only a bit more brighter in contrast. Nevertheless I'm taking a dive into spending the amount for the entire collection. If you had difficulties following i suggest go back and watch them, i did this past fall and fell in love with the (original trilogy) all over again. For those who do NOT like SciFi movies or found the gold in these movies, it's okay, borrow from a friend or get them from Netflix, anyway you can, indulge yourself in the Star Wars realm.

7222088,2,B00YI71PN2,"Star Wars was fantastic. Empire Strikes Back was better. Return of the Jedi as pretty good until the teddy bears, but my kids _love_ the teddy bears -- makes Return of the Jedi their favorite of the three (yes, sad but true -- when they're older, they'll understand).

Even my 5 year old gets that Lucas did such a bad job on characterization and storytelling that Darth Vader is more interesting than any of the ""good guys.""

Those two points said, I am very happy with the original trilogy -- as released. But Lucas couldn't stop. He had his little darlings. So he made three crappy movies and then crappy 3D cartoons. Even five year olds don't like The Clone Wars.

So Lucas is batting 2.5 for 7? More like 2 for 10.

And then there is the blu-ray and DVD strategy....

When Peter Jackson and New Line released The Lord of the Rings on DVD, they got their money back and then some. First, they released the theatrical version; then some months later they released an extended version and that disc _also_ included the original theatrical release. People were steamed, but many both the whole kit _a second time_. But George Lucas won't do that. Why? Because he owns the whole thing from start to finish. He's the annoying studio head he has to deal with.

That still leaves the question of why he doesn't even want to just make some extra money.

The answer is straightforward. NOBODY thinks his ""extended"" version is better. If he were to release the original theatrical, sales of the ""Lucas new and improved"" would drop to ZERO. And lil' ol' George just can't bear the thought that his franchise took a nosedive straight down the toilet. He jumped the shark, screwed the poodle, you named, he did it, screwed it, blew it.

7222090,4,B00YI71PN2,"Han shoots first...Greedo shoots first...SFW!

I hear there is a scene in RotJ that has been left out since its release where Luke creates his own lightsaber on Degobah.  Can't wait to see this highly soughtafter missing scene finally!",1297814400,4,235,5.0
7222091,3,B00YI71PN2,"First off, I want to state that I am not one of those Star War fanatics who had a coronary because Greedo shot first when Fox finally released the original trilogy on dvd several years ago. In fact, when the original trilogy first came out starting in 1977, I purposedly avoided them-mainly because I was more of a horror movie fan and not a sci-fi fan. Even though I did eagerly go to see ""Alien"" when it was first released  theatrically in 1979 {and loved it, by the way!} I considered Alien to more horror movie than sci-fi extravaganza. Seeing a big monster jump out and go 'boo' was more appealing to me than watching a bunch of space ships flying around zapping each other out of the sky.

Well, I'm still not a huge sci-fi fan, but I have come to embrace the Star Wars franchise {mainly the original trilogy} The stories that revolved around the original characters Luke, Hans and Princess Lea were engrossing, exciting and deeply moving. They were like a throwback to those great fantasy movies from the early sixties like 7th Voyage of Sinbad, Jason and the Argonauts, and the Magic Sword. However, I felt the charecters from the newer entries starting with The Phantom Menance on were rather stiff, emotionless and without true direction. In fact, the main purpose of the newer entries obviously was not to show how and why the conflict between the alliance and The Empire got started, but to show how and why Darth Vader was created. All 3 movies-Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith shouldn't have centered on this singular plotline. The original trilogy enveloped us into the lives of Hans, Luke, Lea, Obie wan, Vader and the 2 robots. The newer entries centered on the creation of Vader, and Obie Wan was literally reduced to the thankless role of faithful sidekick.

But enough about how great I think the original trilogy was. My reason for writing this review is to share my feelings about Mr. Lucas, and his constant need to tinker with his movies. Lucas is like a kid with a brand new toy that he doesn't know what to do with. He's been adding scenes and re-editing others in a futile attempt to create what he feels would be the 'perfect movies'. While I applaud him for improving the quality of some of the special effects in the earlier movies, I, like many other fans, totally disapprove of him adding a dubbed in ""nooooooo...""  when Vader tosses the emperor down the shaft. The scene as it was originally shot played well enough. We fans don't need to hear Vader break down like a wimp in a terribly dubbed voice to know that he couldn't bear to see his beloved son suffer an excruitiatingly painful death at the hands of a man he didn't particularly like to begin with. I hate it when a filmmaker thinks so little of the intelligence of his audience that he feels that he has to create dialogue that explains every little scene that is showed.

In other words, if Lucas and 20th Century Fox truly want to create the perfect Star Wars dvd franchise, than they should concentrate thier efforts in putting out an ultimate edition with all the documentaries, deleted scenes, interviews and trailers that are available, and bundle them all in one final boxset. Then Lucas and the folks at Fox could spend the rest of their lives counting their profits and at the same time have a clear concience. If that day ever comes, then may the force be with them!",1297382400,43,3390,4.578253706754531

When Francis Ford Coppola released his Apocalypse Now, he did the same thing with both the Original & Redux, even though he preferred his Redux over the Original. He too, respected the fans enough to do it right. I'm glad he did, because I've yet to meet anyone who liked Redux over the Original.

Does it really alter the storyline if Boba Fett now has Jango Fett's voice, or if Jaba is in episode IV, or if the Emperor in I, II, III, and VI is now the same Emperor in V, or if a few new creatures popped up to give it more scenery, or if the guy who's supposed to be a hero shoots to defend himself only after he's been fired at, or if the RTOJ picnic song was replaced by a BETTER song, or if Hayden Christiansen is now looking at Luke at the end? Not in the least bit. The story, the philosophies, and the themes are still the same.

In the case of the prequel trilogy: OK, I can understand some parts. The dialogue, Jar Jar, and Jake Loyd, sure. I'll give you those. However, the changes in style, such as the use of polished scenery as opposed to the original trilogy, make sense in all honesty. They serve to show how the Empire's presence really deteriorated the galaxy as shown in the original trilogy.

""Digitally Remastered"" is the name given to twice re-cut classic films by George Lucas.  First, the theatrical releases of the ""Special Edition Trilogy"" from 1996 and 1997; including many edits, additional scenes, new digital characters, and alternate music.  Second, after the conclusion of the ""Prequel"" trilogy, George once again swapped characters and voices, and made further minor adjustments to create a ""seamless"" time-line for all 6 films.

The argument is not about the quality of blu-ray over standard dvd, the issue is with the fact that 3 of the greatest movies of all time were perverted by their creator.  All signs point to Lucas working towards eliminating the original unaltered films from our consciousness.  Mind you, the edits by every-ones standards, other than Lucas, do not improve the films.

I will forever prefer to watch even an old broken down VHS copy of the original trilogy than the most advanced version of this disgraceful ""remastered"" nonsense.

Why not include the original prints of the film? I understand the argument ,that in HD,the older films will look that much more...I don't know..dirty? I think the only people that will even click on the option of watching the old versions, will be fans,and they want to relive the way they saw it as kids. I know I enjoy showing my kids the differences in each version. Why not make it simple and just include it all! Let this be THE definitive home release of the films. Much like the recent ""Remasters"" were for the Beatles.",1296086400,7,910,4.4226190476190474
7222115,4,B00YI71PN2,"...but I do look forward to having Star Wars in a HD format. Personally, I would've rather just bought the original trilogy, but I have a feeling Lucas is going to sucker punch us with the extras only being available on the entire box set. I won't be surprised if this happens. The deleted scenes from the original trilogy would be worth it alone. Am I happy about buying it in Blu-Ray 7 years after it came out on DVD? No, but I like high definition.

I've been into the Star Wars movies since I was 2, when the original STAR WARS came out, so I can also say I'm a diehard fan. That being said, to those fanboys who keep complaining about the 'original theatrical"" release of the original trilogy, IT IS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN! Lucas has already said that he destroyed the original prints and the versions that came out a few years ago were from the Laserdisc version. He is not going to go back and remaster a print that doesn't even exist anymore, so get over it. As much as I wish Lucas would stop peddling different versions of the movies, they are his movies to do with as he pleases, whether we like it or not. No one cares if ""Lucas raped your childhood"" (if you want to sound like a pathetic whiny fanboy, keep saying that). We are getting deleted scenes and other miscellany this time that we've never gotten before. If you want to call foul on it, don't buy it. That is the power of the dollar in a capitalistic society.

7222122,5,B00YI71PN2,"What's with all the hate?  I thought this box set was JUST recently announced.  Now I see everyone and their grandmother is reviewing this Blu-ray set and spewing nothing but negativity out on it.  Everyone's main gripe seems to be that the classic movies aren't in this set.  Deciding I wanted to see it for myself, I cancelled my pre-order and proceeded immediately to the movie section at Wal-Mart... just to be disappointed when I saw they not only didn't have it, but it's NOT BEING RELEASED UNTIL SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR.  Being it's still January, I began wrapping my mind around why trolls on Amazon.com are writing negative, nasty reviews about a boxset that hasn't even been released.

Then I realized something:  There were already a couple seperate releases of Star Wars already out on the DVD market.  When it was first released, you all cried about the original movies not being released with it.  Then, when those slim boxsets were released the original trilogy came with the classic movies, and yet you all complained that the master wasn't good enough. (and honestly, who could blame you? the aspect ratio is chunky and awful)  Now, this Blu-ray boxset is being announced, with very vague details of its contents.

Therefore, why are you all complaining about something that hasn't been released yet?  Are you all so self-centered and egotistical that you think your negative pre-release reviews are actually gonna stop people from buying it, even if the original movies aren't included?  To those of you complaining about the original trilogy:  First of all, shut up.  The Blu-rays aren't out yet, you have no right whining about it until AFTER they've been released.  Second of all, if you already have the original trilogy on DVD or video, then DON'T FREAKING COMPLAIN.  If you wanna watch the original dated versions, then go the frick ahead and do so.  No one's stopping you!

Unlike you cry-baby whiners, there's a lot of us out there who don't care whether a film was slightly altered to make it more modern.  Some of us just appreciate movies for what they are:  Timeless distractions from the ordinary.  These movies, as timeless as they are, are no different.  Well, except for the prequels.  They kinda stunk.  But nonetheless, these are the Star Wars movies on Blu-ray, what you see is what you get.

BOTTOM LINE:  If you don't like the idea, don't buy it, but don't troll on here and expect to change people's minds.  You can stop annoying people now.  Thank you!

But if you love Star Wars I say enjoy this release. Granted I own the re-released Special Editions. I saw them in the theater but refused to watch them on dvd. 2-Disc set had the originals, not remastered but still incredible. I won't pass up this chance to view the movies on blu-ray. It's not the way most of us would prefer but Lucas didn't alter every scene in the originally trilogy. Believe me I understand some of the negativity. I believe the pros outweigh the cons. I know we all grow tired of giving our hard earned money to keep buying the same movies over and over. In the end it's still a win for us Star Wars fans.

We thought the SW universe was the coolest thing and we still do. So while many complain about the edited versions, we take what we can get. We have the original trilogy special edition DVD box set, which we rarely watch because we usually end up watching them on TV. Go figure. Spike plays them all just about every weekend in HD. Of the new trilogy we have the last two but we are missing Phantom Menace, we have that on VHS for some reason and no longer have a VHS. So we will be buying the bluray set. I do agree that there should be an unaltered version of the original films because I truly despise the OLD Obi-wan standing next to the NEW Anakin ending. We also enjoy watching the 2nd trilogy. OK so we FF most of the Hayden Christensen scenes except the part where he's melting, ""NOOOOOO"". Point is we still watch & enjoy the movies despite the edits and can't wait to see how they look on bluray. Please put the old Anakin back though in the end of ROTJ. I also enjoy the Ewok ending in that film but understand the intent with the new ending, how it ties the films together.

Fact is, these movies are fun to watch (and hear) on Blu-Ray!  If you have a nice home theatre system, it's a must have. The experience is nothing short of amazing and this box set sets a high water mark for mastering and audio quality.

Would I prefer that Lucas didn't go in and make minor tweaks to certain things? Yes, I would probably prefer the theatrical released versions instead.

They showed the movie before other cinemas in the area. I don't know why, or how, but it included an scene before the last battle where Luke encounter his friend Biggs. Could not see this again until the special edition. So yes, i like the special edition, not just because of the special effects but for the recovered scenes.

I do have to say that on Return of the Jedi that and alternate angle feature with the original ""spirits"" scene(main) and the new one(alternate) would be nice, even so, if the new one has not only the younger Anakin, but also the younger Obi-Wan and Yoda. Just a thought, but even with this variation, this and the rest of the movies still are so good that they can be avoided by any Star Wars fan.

perfectly reasonable -- the technology just wasn't available at the time. That's Fine. But that bar room scene was something he could have changed at the time, so the 'technology' gap doesn't apply.

He defaced his own art, and brought forward three prequel films with so many plot holes and contradictions to their own reality that it leaves one in disbelief (just check out Star Wars reviews on YouTube to see what I mean.) But then, in the old days he had a team of experts helping him every step of the way. No one dares to question him now, just watch the behind-the-scenes footage to see for yourself. A beautiful space opera, with imaginative inspiration from old Sci-Fi serials, has been turned into pure commercial garbage.

7222151,5,B00YI71PN2,"Regarding all 6 movies, I have always loved them, always will.  The Blu-ray picture and sound are great.  The digital additions are fine.  The digital Yoda in Episode I is a great change.  Episode IV looks and sounds awesome for a movie made in 1976-77.  And the Ewoks having eye expression in Episode VI is a welcome addition.  And how cool is it having Sebulba make a cameo in Jabba's palace.  I am more than a little amazed at the one star naysayers and the nitpicking.  It comes down to choice, the theme that is the very heart of these movies.  These films were created by an insightful and revolutionary man for the sole purpose of entertainment and fun.  What a shame that some have become so obsessed that they have to tear down the creation of another to be validated.  The very essence of the journey towards the dark side, eh?  If you like these movies, buy the set and enjoy.",1294617600,10,887,4.407407407407407

But now George messed it all up makes me cringe at hearing Darth saying NOOOOOOOOOOO! in ROTJ where he picks up the emperor and throws him in the shaft. Lucas must be on something when he made these changes again. There are however some changes I like is where they covered up the exposed piece of a pole with extended Wampa's piece of arm with cgi to make it look more real. That'll be a real good edit. Making Yoda's character in TPM look more like the real Yoda from TESB. That too is real good edit. But all the other changes that Lucas had made is totally messed up and I wish he didn't messed with them except for the changes I already mentioned, those I like. Lucas needs to wake up cause when I don't buy this set and I'm sure a lot of others won't either, then maybe George will finally listen to us and give us unaltered versions and 1997 SE versions too for us real Star Wars fans to enjoy instead of just watching his nonsense 2011 re-edit versions.",1294617600,4,1061,4.257425742574258
7222153,4,B00YI71PN2,"That is the only question you need to ask yourself, if you have the DVD version.

Me, I love Star Wars to the point that I would buy the title just to have it.  That's the honest truth.  I couldn't bear being left out and not having seen the 'latest blu-ray version' and still call myself a fan of the series.

But that's just me.  I'm sure there are far more practical fans out there who would only buy this if it had any extras on it that weren't seen before.  Just like how you justify buying a new digital camera with new features even if your current one has tons of features you will never use.

DVD's upscaled with a competent player to play on HD will be more than enough for today's large screen TVs and will not justify spending another $100 just to ooh and ahh over smoother lines.  It's not like princess Leah was wearing something see-through a la Monica Bellucci in Matrix, that will enhance viewing pleasure.

And what other supplements could have been added to that of the DVD series?  A lesson in upscaling and a documentary on how to transfer things from DVD to bluray?  Wow, that will shed new light on the Star Wars universe, won't it?

No, in the end this series is just a test of how big a fan you are in terms of willingness to spend and collect.  I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm one of those who will, and really, nobody else should be either.  I am giddy already of this box sitting next to my original trilogy DVD box and making me feel rich and content just staring at it.",1294617600,5,1501,4.221052631578948
7222154,4,B00YI71PN2,"First I want say the Girl Friend/Fan Boy review was enjoyable. Here's a Star Wars guy that can sit down with his gal and enjoy it. It's somewhat funny how we (including me) will notice the Star Wars tweeks or lack there of.

I like my new Blu Ray complete trilogy set. The packaging is cool and the films look good to me. I don't pick on every detail. I'm just not that kind of Star Wars fan.

That said, I saw Star Wars when I was 7 years old. It was not titled Episode 4: A New Hope yet. I saw it again everytime it was in the theater along with the others. My brother has that version on DVD. Great, saw it again and can whenever but I don't very often.

The fact is I was a Star Wars along kid with my brother. Had lots of fun too. Then the there's the Dark Side, we were made fun of for it, teased about it just for liking Star Wars. Hateful crazy things were hollered at us for no reason. Even in class I'd be suddenly made fun of for once liking Star Wars and I had not talked about in years. That was a long time ago and forgot about most of it until recently. I finally let go of allot of Star Wars stuff giving everything to my brother. Star Wars for me was a brotherly bonding fun time.

Now that my bro and I are married, each with a son; Star Wars has come back into our lives and we are kids again. Our lovely pretty wives have renewed our childhood fun and they even make time for us to enjoy the Star Wars movies. But here comes the Dark Side again.

The issue I see is this: Why can't we have the original Star Wars untitled 1977 version on Blu Ray too?
Would I like to have that as an extra on a Blu Ray? Sure thhat would be awesome. Does it make me despise George Lucas when I don't have it as a choice? No, I'm not that kind of Star Wars guy.

Here is my opinion. I am happy to have the Blu Ray Complete Triology. I did not have a complete set before other than the VHS version in widescreen with the hologram on the front. It's in storage now, never to be used again.

If George reads these reviews I would like to tell him this; It is fun to see how you really want to share your vision. I'm an artists too and I also like to tell stories. All this George Lucas/Star Wars blasting hurts, I know it does. For that reason, I am embarrased to be a Star Wars fan. But I am fan and always will be becasue it was and is so much fun to explore.
I loved the mysterious Jawas in the origianl 1977 and we'd ask who is this Darth Vader? What about this desert world you created? We want more and more.... Star Wars is fun for all ages and for many of us it's too embarrassing to fight these crazy hateful reviews. There are lots of us orignal fans out here who still enjoy Star Wars. Now, it would be so cool to have the very first version of Star Wars on Blu Ray, (The unaltered version that was put on DVD) with loads of extras documenting what it took to update the movies, a vintage collection of the films with back to back comparisons. A limited Blu Ray set made for that purpose.

Is it really worth the fuss to demand it from George Lucas? Not to me. There is no argument out there about it, film preservation, history, hating CGI or what ever the argument is, none of it is worth the time to be mean. It's only a movie after all.",1294531200,,3249,3.964777947932619

7222156,5,B00YI71PN2,"I want to say a few things.

First off, the prequels were terrible and a waste of time. We all know this.  They were nothing but eye candy for Generation Y who've been raised on movies created by computers and with no plots. They lacked soul, originality, and were dire in the continuity area. The feeling of the ""Star Wars Universe"" was completely lacking and Hayden Christiansen was without a doubt stiffer than morning wood. And any of the Star Wars newbs who think they're better have no idea what a movie is. Stick with your PS3. And that's all I'm going to say about that.

Now on to originals.  They have finally arrived on blu-ray and that's a good thing.  But I have to address the whiners who were there to see the originals in the theater like myself.  Get over it! George WILL NOT be releasing the theatrical cuts on blu-ray. Take the hint already.  It's not happening.  You cry about wanting the originals but then complain about him color correcting the lightsabers. You can't have it both ways. These movies were never about whether Han shoots first, or color correction, or Hayden Christiansen popping up at the end of Jedi. They were about good vs. evil.  And that has not been changed at all. Some of you people over-analyse these movies to the point of obsession.  They're just great movies. Nothing more. There are over 100 errors in ANH.  That doesn't deter from it being unwatchable.

And to the people accusing Uncle George of being greedy.  Why is it every time Star Wars is released on a new medium Lucas is accused of ""double sipping"" or milking it? This isn't double dipping.  This is Star Wars being released on Blu-ray for the first time.  Just like DVD before that and VHS before that.  This is no different than every other movie that is released.  But because it's Lucas it's greed?  As a matter of fact Lucas never delves into a new medium right away so you can't say he's greedy or SW would have been released years ago. Besides, have you heard of Anchor Bay Entertainment? They give us a new version of Halloween, Dawn of the Dead, and Evil Dead every other month. And don't even get me started on Disney.

I will be buying the original trilogy in September.  I will be excited to watch these movies and seeing the deleted scenes.  And you should too. Peace!",1294531200,30,2293,4.516990291262136
7222157,4,B00YI71PN2,"Star Wars fans, please stop crying! First, no one has seen the new complete Blue Ray version. It comes out in September 2011. Lets wait until then to make our judgments. It may look great! As far as Lucas adding to the originals (IV, V, and VI), remember, as much as we loved them, in their theatrical release, Lucas said that ""he never really finish the first 3 films and he did so. You may noy like it but remember one important fact. While many Star Wars fans feel the movies are theirs, it's not. There are George Lucas' and if he felt they weren't finish and he had to add to them, like it or not it's his and only his decision.

I have seen the first or 4th depending on your point of view in the theater when it came out 17 times all together. At least back then I was dating and had a different date every time I went. Or, so I paid double for each viewing. Either way, I bought the movies on Beta, then VHS, and again VHS, oh and on the precurser to DVD's the Record that played with a needle inside a machine that played movies like records, then and record sized lazer disks, yeah who remembers them? Now, I have all 6 both sets on DVD, that I have not even seen yet, and here comes the blu-ray. While I am hugely tempted, I just don't know if I am ready to shell out the $90 after spending $70 or so with tax on the last six on dvd, that I have not even seen yet. Oh, prior to that I had purchased the first three or 4-6 depending on your point of view on DVD individually. Those I have seen. But, then came the better version in the sets of 4-6, and 1-3. So, I purchased those. I have so many versions of Star Wars, I believe I could hold a yard sale. So, what do I think about this, well, the movies I would give 5 stars. However, I believe there should be a special sale price for people like me, who own so many versions. Then motivate us to purchase the blu-ray. On the other hand, Star Wars on Blu-Ray should be an amazing experience. But, what's next, Star Wars 3D, then something better. How many times are we going to dip into our wallets for this one series of movies? I wish I could answer that. I honestly dont' know. I had thought I was done with the Star Treks, when I purchased the redone standard definition versions for $99 each. But then my wife got the blu-ray version for my birthday and now, I have those.

7222164,5,B00YI71PN2,"This isn't really a review....more of a question and a brief memory.

In late May, 1977 the word of mouth regarding a new sci fi film about to open at the Ziegeld Theatre in New York City ran rampant.....so much so that I stood in line for the second screening that day....the first that day was too early for my late night habits, and the line for the second certainly proved that word of mouth works.

Entering the theatre I saw many people leaving whom I recognized from the Broadway theatre world, and they were all, to a person, slack jawed and amazed.  Some were even staying for the next screening (this was the beginning of one viewing only).

The Ziegfeld is(was?) a beautiful massive red curtained box built for massive audiences watching a huge screen.  The rest is history.  The movie started and as the crawl of information began, the audience howled in recognition of the old serials from the 40's and 50's.  And THEN, THE RUMBLE BEGAN, THE LITTLE SPACE SHIP ZIPPED ACROSS THE SCREEN AND FOR WHAT SEEMED LIKE AN ETERNITY, THE GIANT UNDERBELLY OF THE PURSUING SHIP BEGAN TO FILL THE SCREEN, THEARE SPEAKERS ALMOST EXPLODING, AND THE SHIP SAILED ON, AND ON AND ON.....HOW BIG WAS THIS????  With one voice, the entire audience began to cheer, clap, stamp their feet, and, for me, a new beginning of sci fi films began.

Now, 34 years later, we are seeing yet another version of the films, now counting 6, being sold to fans.  My biggest question is:  are the ORIGINAL CHAPTERS III, IV AND V, the un-revised versions, going to be in anamorphic wide screen for large screens, or, as they were coupled with the revised versions a few years ago, letterboxed but not enlarged?  That's my basic question.

At the moment, I am perfectly happy with the DVDs I've collected over the various incarnations of STAR WARS.  Now I'm guessing, if the trend continues, the entire saga will be manipulated into 3D eventually and more changes will occur.  The original three rest in my memory untouched and protected.  The opening day of episodes IV and V will never repeat the overall excitement of late May, 1977 (was it the 22nd?)where a, then, younger man stood waiting for a look at the future.  Well, the future is NOW, and it ain't that bad at all.

7222165,5,B00YI71PN2,"I am glad they are releasing this entire series to Blu-Ray in the enhanced version.  To the so-called purists out there the 25th anniversary theatrical release and subsequently to different media formats enhanced those episodes. Much of what was added, besides cleaning up old technology special effects, were scenes that ended up edited out of the original films. These scenes filled in gaps in the story line which were obvious edits in the original, so don't complain.  The Star Wars saga has always been on the cutting edge of motion picture techology, even back in 1977 when it was originally released.  George Lucas became a pioneer in film special effects and launched an entire industry serving the motion picture industry.  Many of the later great special effects films including all the Star Trek films may not have been possible without the technology developed by Lucas.  It's only fitting that these films are now released on state of the art media not only for a new genereation to enjoy for the next 30 years, but for all of us old timeres who first saw it on the big screen in the 70's.  This is definitaly what I have been waiting for.",1294444800,6,1152,4.735

I have been a fan for decades now, have owned many of the Star Wars films on various media, including the DVDs, and while they look great on the 2004 release, this Blu-Ray transfer should prove to be a welcome update.

I love these films, the entire Saga, and I say that without an ounce of shame. I stopped getting into petty rumbles with whiney fanboys who debate the films into oblivion; inconsequential arguments about prequel vs original, SE vs unaltered, Greedo shooting first or last, etc, are all fruitless and ruin the ability to just enjoy the films without idiotic squabbles over insane minutia cluttering the experience. Thankfully more than enough media has been released for Stars Wars and both the Special Addition AND completely unaltered Originals are available to enjoy.

For those looking for the amazing original, unaltered classics they have been available on DVD for years now for us all to appreciate. And contrary to a few disgruntled fans' endless prattle, the originals look perfectly fine on these DVDs. Here you go:

So I celebrate the release of the entire Saga, warts and all, on Blu-Ray. The good far outweighs the bad, and it's time for the greatest film franchise of all time to be seen in all it's Blu-Ray glory.

7222167,4,B00YI71PN2,"A reviewer commented: ""I ask George Lucas: How is any of this different from Ted Turner arguing that 'if color film had been more-widely available back in the 1940's...'?""
Here's how it's different.  It's his movie.  Turner didn't make movies.  And for anyone to alter the work of another is both arrogant, inflated and boorish.  No one's going to re-edit Citizen Kane, or colorize it, or include CGI (although the Xanadu exteriors could probably use it).  Welles isn't around anymore.  But when the director, the sole creative force (he wrote them too) says, ""I want to change a few things,"" who can argue?  So some now scream ""It's not the way I remember it!  He changed it!"" which really means he took away part of your adolescence when you giggly and gawked at the screen in 1977 like every other teenage nerd.  There are ample examples of artists retouching their works, and I mean fine artists like DaVinci and Michaelangelo and others.

Now if someone like Turner (who isn't really even doing this anymore) wanted to alter the work of another, they can and do.  It's called a re-make.  Think the new ""True Grit.""  Jeff Bridges as John Wayne?  No, but Bridges is hot right now, so he's cashing in.  Harrison Ford in the Humphrey Bogart role in the re-make of ""Sabrina.""  I think the originals should be left alone.  Wait until we get the CGI version of ""Wizard of Oz"" then I'll join the screaming too.

But Lucas can do as he pleases.  He apparently pleases to release the updated and in his opinion, up-graded ""special edition"" version of the original trilogy on Blue-Ray.  And I have all of those on DVD (and VHS and Laserdisc for that matter) but I'll buy the new BD versions too.",1294444800,17,1689,4.604026845637584

Hell, he isn't much improved in the 2nd one either.  And fix Jabba in episode 4...too cartooney, and maybe even small.

I'd love to see Han shoot first, hehe, but whatever.  I have the original one's on dvd that were released as bonus disc's, and those are just fine.  The prequal trilogy is lame and silly, but eposide 3 is cool.  What , , more could I say about the classic original trilogy.  But for real, I kind of like the special edition versions, but they added a bit too much to episode 6. My question, why the first set doesn't get fixed up as well.  Yoda looks like his distant crack addicted cousin did a stand in, wtf??  That first movie needs some tweaking.

I hope they release the extras that were on the laserdisc and include into the movie Luke constructing his lightsaber.  Anyways, looking forward to the blu.",1294444800,2,1003,4.385869565217392
7222169,1,B00YI71PN2,"The original Star Wars movie released in 1977 was an amazing achievement. Some (not all) of the tinkering with the movie, which resulted in a ""new version"" twenty years later, I found distracting. My primary example of this is the following scene:

Stormtrooper: Let me see your identification.
Obi-Wan: [with a small wave of his hand] You don't need to see his identification.
Stormtrooper: We don't need to see his identification.
Obi-Wan: These aren't the droids you're looking for.
Stormtrooper: These aren't the droids we're looking for.
Obi-Wan: He can go about his business.
Stormtrooper: You can go about your business.
Obi-Wan: Move along.
Stormtrooper: Move along... move along.

During this scene in the 1997 version there are all kinds of CGI animations circling around which distract from the subtlety of Alec Guinness's performance. So, for that reason, I would like to be able to view the movie as it was originally released, and I would enjoy seeing it on Blu-ray. Generally I find CGI tiring whenever it is used in the 1977 film. If it was used subtly I would have enjoyed it much more, instead we are hit over the head with it as in the scene mentioned above.",1294444800,18,1177,4.850746268656716

So yes, it's been a very long long wait and I am very happy because it is finally going to be over. ... and changes or no changes, Han Solo remains my favorite Hero in this amazing saga. I gave it 5 stars because I'm really happy about it. I of course have not seen these unreleased BRs.

I do believe the prequels are really bad and could live with IV-VI only. But still, I want my complete saga. Don't trash it just yet. If you think it's not worth it, don't buy it.",1294444800,10,776,4.071895424836601
7222171,2,B00YI71PN2,"This is typical tyrannical behaviour from director's.  Another egregious example of tampering with a classic is Amadeus.  Where is there an original theatrical release to be found (laser disc, VHS).  Lucas and Milos Forman must've attended the same ""lets' mess up the original"" Oscar winning classics we, the PAYING audience cherished.",1294444800,11,335,5.529411764705882
7222172,1,B00YI71PN2,"Yes, I'm a die-hard, and yes, I'm pissed that this will probably not include an original theatrical version.  I haven't read all the posts, because I don't want to get that invested in this as I am losing hope that Lucas will ever appreciate his original masterpiece.

I look at the original movies, and every time I think to myself that this was made in the late seventies.  I think about what else was going on at the time, and how far it pushed the envelope in movie making and for sci-fi in general.  I think this movie changed the way people looked at the sci-fi genre because it had such passion, such fire, such guts.  I think of all the amazing story telling and creativity.  I think of the inventiveness of the technologies they had to create that paved the way for future movies.  It redefined what I thought was possible in space opera and ""set the standard"".

Well, all of that is taken away when you modify the movies.  ""Hey look at this amazing movie from the 70's and see how it compares to today, but ignore that weird looking CGI stuff that was actually added in the 90's . . .""  To me, it's modifying a classic.  I understand this is probably way too sophisticated an idea for most people, but can't you TRY to understand?  This is a CLASSIC, in every sense of the word.  You don't modify a classic, no matter how ""well-intentioned"" you are.

""Hmm, I think the Mona Lisa would look better in a different hair style, because I just found a memo from Leonardo DaVinci that said he wasn't happy with how her hair turned out and was too busy to change it"".  OK that's exaggerating, but the original restrictions of the artist are a very important part of the historical nature of the art.  Everyone has to live in a world of restrictions, and the choices the artist has to make is a large part of the finished work of art.

I don't care what Lucas thinks about ""Oh, this is what I really intended"".  I think he's lost some marbles.  He was restricted back then and had to make choices as an artist.  These choices are a cherished part of the art (for me anyway).  Just look at his work now.  He has all the resources in the entire universe, and can't make a movie that can hold a candle to the originals, and he's too blind to see it.  Maybe money makes you blind.

He was such an amazing artist and visionary back in the 70's and 80's.  Now, in my humble opinion, he's lost it.

Sorry if I've offended anyone, but this topic just makes me mad.  Sorry if I've offended you, George.",1294444800,59,2495,4.309677419354839
7222173,1,B00YI71PN2,"Those of you 4 and 5 star reviewers are traitors.  There I said it.

If you're willing to pay for another version with the horribly done additional footage then you are not fans of Star Wars.  You're fakes.

The movies were PERFECT.  The additional footage only made them worse and should have been added as extras, not forced on us like revisionist history.  I cannot in good conscience pay for another version of these films in their present state.  They only detract, not enhance as the extra footage for the Lord of the Rings trilogy did.  It's obvious that Lucas has lost it....look at episodes 1-3.  Terrible.  And Chrystal skull?  Give me a break.
All effects, crap plot.

7222175,3,B00YI71PN2,"Let me start by saying, none of us including myself should be reviewing an item on Amazon that hasn't even been released.  I agree with the fans who prefer to see the the saga as it was originally filmed.  Everyone that would prefer to see the ""extra footage/ cleaned up version"" I ask you this,  Can you be 100% sure that George isn't going to spring something on you in this release that you don't absolutley hate,  or even more simply, that the movies are going to look that much better (they are taking 33 yr old footage and 33 yr old special effects and giving you 1080p).  Are you serious??  I seriously doubt that the original saga can be remastered AGAIN to the point of WOW.  That being said, I will return to my original thought, ""none of us know how this saga will look, at this time it is just SPECULATION AND OPINION, therefore Amazon should save some credibility and turn off the review links on items until they are released.",1294444800,27,940,4.398843930635838

7222177,5,B00YI71PN2,"I can't wait for this release.  The original 3 (A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi) alone would be worth the near $90 admittance fee for the entire Blu-ray set.  I've seen each of them at least 5 times on the big screen, have had 2 sets of VCR copies and the trilogy on DVD.  I grew up in the 70's so Star Wars toys were a no-brainer at Christmas time each year - at least until I stopped getting toys for Christmas' and my birthdays.  The cast in the original 3 could never be equaled - Harrison Ford is one of the greatest actors of all-time.",1294358400,14,568,4.044642857142857

7222181,5,B00YI71PN2,"As a long time fan that has waited way too long for a Hi-Def release, this is a must buy for me despite any shortcomings concerning the original versions. As stated already, the original versions are already available as bonus discs on the Special edition DVD release and that is likely the best outcome we can hope for as no further resources will likely be funneled into any restoration by Lucasfilm. As far as this release goes, I believe we will have a lot of treasures unearthed in the bonus material. We may even see the infamous ""Luke building his lightsaber on Tatooine"" scene from Episode VI added to the either the bonus content or maybe even the film itself as a clean Hi-Def version exists. That alone would make me buy this set. In retrospect I am a little let down by the prequels, but I would rather have them then not as they add in the missing story elements/background to the original trilogy. I am buying the complete saga set and will be content to call this the definitive collection even with the inevitable 3-D release on the horizon. At long last we will have our saga as it was meant to be seen!!",1294358400,8,1121,4.446601941747573

To any fan of the original series, it is a key moment in the development of Han Solo's character. Without strongly incorporating his initial mercenary nature, his appearance in the end as savior to the rebellion loses all its impact.
