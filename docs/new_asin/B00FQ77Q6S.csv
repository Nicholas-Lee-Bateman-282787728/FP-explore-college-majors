6020086,5,B00FQ77Q6S,My kids and I really enjoyed this movie. We had a lot to discuss at the dinner table after watching this movie.,1393718400,2,111,4.090909090909091
6020087,5,B00FQ77Q6S,"It's a relief to know he was not alone, he was cared for up until the end. See Blackfish!  Read ""Death at Seaworld"" by David Kirby.",1391644800,,131,4.038461538461538
6020088,1,B00FQ77Q6S,""" the only captive orca to ever be successfully rehabilitated and released back to to the 'wild' ""

This is insane. Keiko's release was strongly opposed by most qualified researchers associated with the project, they only did so because they ran out of funding to care for him. You must wonder what the agenda is for people who find it more important to pat themselves on the back that their ideology is right rather than admit it was wrong.

[...]

That tells the real story. What they did with Keiko was essentially the same as taking your dog or cat 25 miles away from home and leaving it to fend for itself. Cruel and stupid.",1390780800,5,629,4.452173913043478
6020089,5,B00FQ77Q6S,Loved this documentary. I was very moved. Very informative and mesmerizing. It's good to see how Keiko lived his life after Free Willy.,1390348800,,135,4.913043478260869
6020090,5,B00FQ77Q6S,Success!!!!  He made people want to put aside their evil ways to allow love and compassion to be bestowed on a wronged Orca.  Bravo Keiko!!  You were and still are making people less bent on destruction fueled by hate.  I wonder if Keiko knew he would be spear heading freedom for the captive Orca.  You have to view this!  May you be changed for the remainder of this life and generations to come.,1389657600,4,398,4.383561643835616
6020091,5,B00FQ77Q6S,"I had no idea whales were so badly used and abused. All in the name of ""entertainment,"" in other words PROFIT. These people need to find other ways to make a living.

6020092,5,B00FQ77Q6S,"Very informative & eye opening documentry. So heartwarming to see keiko swim free from iceland to norway, after many years of captivity. So sad that his need for humans played a great part of his life. I will always be glad he swam free for 5 years. Instead of swimming in a fish bowl for the rest of his life. Freedom is far better than captivity. No whales or dolphins should be ripped away from their families for human entertainment!",1387929600,11,437,4.475
6020093,5,B00FQ77Q6S,I love Keiko! I am glad that he went my to the sea its sad how he didn't find his family I was hoping that he would! I have all the free willy's movies and I am glad he got to see other whales like him,1386979200,4,201,3.391304347826087
6020094,5,B00FQ77Q6S,"I am still feeling happy for Keiko, that after years of captivity he was able to live in the ocean.  I am impressed that he chose to cross the Atlantic Ocean and even if in the end he preferred human company, I can accept his choice because it was his decision to choose the family he felt comfortable with.",1385769600,7,307,4.203389830508475

6020099,5,B00FQ77Q6S,Best documentary I have ever seen .,1416355200,,35,4.142857142857143
6020100,5,B00FQ77Q6S,"Excellent documentary of Keiko & his journey to potential freedom. Sadly he truly enjoyed people too much to really be free & got sick and passed on. Never knowing who his family was, other than people, should be a lesson that we all learn. Leave these beautiful creatures in the natural environment they were born in where they truly are free. Being Keiko fans and seeing him in Oregon several times his story is personal to our family. So sad was the day he left, watching him fly over in the huge aircraft knowing that we'd never see him again. That is until we meet him again ""on the other side"".",1411689600,2,600,4.414414414414415

6020102,3,B00FQ77Q6S,"I ordered this movie thinking it would be new, especially considering the price, and it was not. The dvd is in good condition but still disappointed, it took a long time to receive a used dvd.",1400976000,,192,4.361111111111111
6020103,5,B00FQ77Q6S,"I just received the movie in the mail today, and it was so worth it!! I love Keiko & it was so great to know a fuller detail of how his life was after that movie was made. People can complain about the cardboard packaging ( Which is Eco friendly) or say something like *Its a false movie blah blah blah* But they Keiko Foundation did a great job on making this film. If you love anything about nature or continuing self education, then I highly HIGHLY recommend getting this movie. Its so great and honestly, tells Keiko's story with love, compassion, and education.",1395273600,,566,4.451923076923077

8617958,5,B00FQ77Q6S,I took all my grandchildren to Oregon to say GOODBYE to Keiko years ago so I bought this for them to watch with THEIR children as a Christmas gift and also bought the FREE WILLY movies.  Some of the children are a little young to understand but the DVDs will be there to watch and learn from long after this Great-Grandmother is not longer around.,1480636800,,347,4.338461538461538

8617960,4,B00FQ77Q6S,"Chronicles the life of the orca that appeared in 'Free Willy'. Abducted in 1979 (abduction footage shown and not easy to watch). Spends time in Canada and then Mexico where the movie is filmed.

From there it goes to Oregon and then an attempt is make to return it to its home ocean. Insightful, ocean footage and talking heads. Surprise ending.

Concludes with a list of 40 other animals still in captivity.",1465430400,,408,4.652777777777778
8617961,1,B00FQ77Q6S,"So hey everyone. Don't waste your money on this. You can watch it free on YouTube. But a word of caution. As you watch, make sure you try to wade through all the emotional bull crap. The narrator/movie producer is an obvious hypocrite who seems to make an emotional connection when this movie is trying to end all connections to animals. Not to mention that the ""cast"" in the film had only a cursory involvement while 95% of the onsite staff involved were not even consulted in the film.",1458691200,2,487,4.48314606741573
