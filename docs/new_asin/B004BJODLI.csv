8422009,1,B004BJODLI,"I was already getting the feeling that Hindi cinema has not been at its best in the last few years, and my fears were confirmed upon seeing this sad excuse of a film. Golmaal 3 severely disappointed me, and here are some of the many reasons why.

You may feel like this movie has a lot of potential when you see some big names in Bollywood in the cast list. But you would REALLY have to be loyal enough to these characters to sit through the entire movie. The plot is basically about an elder man and elder woman, who were once in love with each other, but had forgotten about one another and moved on with their life. They now both have 3 kids each (sounds like the Brady Bunch at all?), all adopted but don't realize it, and when the former lovers finally decided to tie the knot, they and their grown children move in together under one big roof and get into a lot of fights. After the marriage, the whole movie revolves around the kids' bickering and pranks.

The writers attempted to make the plot interesting and complicated by adding extra elements--such as a criminal with amnesia and issues the characters face outside of family matters--but the plot turns out to be extremely thin. Too much of the movie involves ridiculous stunts and music and dance numbers that the movie doesn't have time for a deep story. It's true that there are many other Bollywood movies with the same problem, and people seem to watch them anyway, but in the case of Golmaal 3, the stunts were not that funny, and the songs and dances were not as appealing as in other movies.

And why was there a dog named Facebook? I thought they would use the name of the dog to make a joke somewhere in the movie, but I guess that was the joke: that the dog was named Facebook. Not. Funny. One. Bit.",1324166400,,1773,4.366666666666666
8422010,3,B004BJODLI,"Rohit Shetty begins GOLMAAL 3 with a few collage shots of GOLMAAL and GOLMAAL RETUNS. He has every reason to do so. After all, both clicked with the audiences and set the cash registers ringing. But they also bring with them a humongous set of expectations for GOLMAAL 3.

GOLMAAL 3 promises to be bigger. Not only the characters, the number of action sequences, gags are a lot more than the previous two editions. You also have a dog this time named 'Facebook'

After GOLMAaAL, GOLMAAL RETURNS and ALL THE BEST, Ajay Devgn teams up with Rohit Shetty yet again this Diwali. Their combination has proved to be very successful. Also, in the recent past, Ajay has excelled doing comedy and action, something which this film has aplenty.

All in all, a Cracker of a film!",1300579200,,767,4.625
8422011,3,B004BJODLI,"There are well known actors in this movie, but it is, on the whole, a farce. There are gigs and farcical drama, but a very thin story and little purpose behind the narration.

Tusshar Kapoor comes out as quite the oddity with his primal speech. In fact, the character which he plays has been stretched too much, and in more than one film. It falls flat, this time. Kareena Kapoor looks brisk and Arshad Warsi and Shreyas Talpade are wasted. Johny Lever repeats his amnesia act, to add to the whole farcical atmosphere.

This movie is good for a lot of laughs, gigs and irrelevant fun!",1297209600,,584,4.5
