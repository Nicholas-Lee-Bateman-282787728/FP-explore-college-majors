Tuck Bushman and the Legend of Piddledown Dale (2009) - Tuck Bushman is an out-of-work TV presenter and creature hunter, but he tries to stop whatever is causing the strange happenings around a remote Yorkshire village.

Typically, Mill Creek Entertainment repackages the same public domain horror movies around Halloween every year, but not with Freak Show Cinema, as the twelve movies haven't been packaged together in one set before. Many of the movies in this collection were filmed in the U.K., but all twelve moves were filmed on a extremely low-budget giving them a homemade feel to them. Horror films are known for bad acting, but these films have the most horrible acting ever recorded, and that says something as I have seen some really bad movies. Dark Measures: Gang Warfare, The Curse of Blanchard Hill and Tuck Bushman and the Legend of Piddledown Dale were the only interesting movies from this set. The others were hard to sit through.

Lighting, acting, sound, script, everything is poorly done. Normally in these types of collections there is at least one good film, but this had nothing but stinkers. They are all on the same level, quality wise.",1444176000,,335,4.894736842105263

8594634,2,B00DN3U6QO,"This is a collection of 12 low budget films, most are not worth viewing. 10 of 12 films use colons in their title and many have been released under different titles. This is perhaps one of the worst 12 film collection I have seen. If there is a film on it you want to get that is in this set, the cheap price (currently $1.99 US on E-Bay) will make it worth while considering at this point you are basically getting the film for next to nothing, you are paying for shipping.",1441670400,,474,4.163043478260869

8594637,5,B00DN3U6QO,"After reading some of the reviews & watching this set, I am going to say that I wish Mill Creek Entertainment would put out more of this kind of fare!  Not because I am dis-satisfied with their multi-packs of several cult B - Z rate movies, but because i think this would be an excellent outlet for several types of independant movies like this!!!  I already have their ""Blood Bath"" & Their ""Bloodsuckers"" 12 pack sets and it is nice to see what people do with their movies.
  So while I understand why people would not like movies of this type, watch these as these should be watched, as someone trying to make an attempt to make a film.  We all gotta start somewhere!!!
  5 Stars Mill Creek!!!!",1405123200,6,696,4.390625
8594638,2,B00DN3U6QO,"Holy cow Mill Creek! When you decide to release a stinker, you really pile it on thick. I know these are all independent films made by people who used their life savings trying to make dreams a reality by becoming the next big thing. The problem is, I watch movies to be entertained, as do most others. I don't care if the movie cost 1 billion dollars, or 1 cent. I want to be entertained, and taken away from my own problems for a couple hours. I don't want to suffer through atrocious acting, horrible lighting, sound that fades in and out, and countless other problems that make me more pissed off than before the film started playing. I don't make movies because I know my movie would turn out at least as bad as these. I know this, so I don't do it. Not everyone that picks up a camera, or who has a rich dad that can buy them one, has the ability to make a good film. If any of these films had any of the characters featured on the misleading cover art, I might have found a few of them interesting, but no such luck. There was one film, while having all of the problems mentioned above, did one thing none of the others did; it was entertaining. Tuck Bushman & The Legend Of Piddledown Dale didn't take itself seriously, and had some genuinely funny moments. It's the only reason to pick this set up at all.

While I'm bashing this set I might as well mention another thing that pissed me off. Why do most of these movies need two titles? Wasn't one enough? Sometimes the title screen doesn't even show both titles. Was it a way to try to market these films again, hoping people would think the movie was some kind of sequel? Who knows. The more I read those two title movies, the more stupid they sound, and the less they sound like anything to do with the movie itself. Buyer beware.",1402185600,5,5575,4.65274949083503
8594639,5,B00DN3U6QO,"If you appreciate low budget exploitation movies at all, buy this set just to watch 'Kung-Fu Killing Spree: Order of One'.
Although it is cheesy, and the main characters look pretty out of shape for this kind of thing, I guarantee you have not seen better fighting scenes in a movie this low budget!! I was thoroughly entertained by this one, and can't wait to see if the rest of the movies in this set live up to it.",1389657600,3,417,4.291139240506329
8594640,3,B00DN3U6QO,This is like a lot of Mill Creeks's other holiday releases: Public domain videos you can download off the internet for free.  So why get the DVD instead of just downloading them?  Mill Creek does at some basic clean up of the movies and you don't have to have a computer watch them.  That alone is a good enough reason for me to get this collection.,1382745600,,349,4.257575757575758
