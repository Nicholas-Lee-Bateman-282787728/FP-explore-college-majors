8241514,2,B0011EIRYU,This was not at all what I expected.  It really didn't show her changing her body shape or anything and the film was very poor quality.',1473811200,,136,4.230769230769231
8241515,1,B0011EIRYU,"This purchase was a total rip-off. I couldn't tell you exactly what garbage I got. There were no reviews before mine, and I thought that it could be a ""Body change story"", with some bottom life moment that made ""Jeannie"" enter the path of health and exercise. Well, I'm going to tell you exactly what's in those 9 minutes of video. No, it's not a typo, the whole recording last 9 minutes. They used to ask $20 for it, and I got it ""on sale"", for the incredible price of $10. How lucky I am! If they ask for $0.01 plus shipping: DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH!!!!!
Around 1 1/2 minutes are wasted in credits, before and after. After the presentation credits, comes up a woman, Jeannie, and tells you that she did the 12 week body makeover challenge. They show you a picture of a big woman in bikini, that is Jeannie, and she informs you that she's going to do her second challenge. So from there on, you see different video shots of her exercising in a gym, and as she is pushing herself, there's a lot of teeth showing. That goes on for around 6 minutes, with some annoying music. Then she's getting prepped for the competition: hair, make-up, bikini and oil. You see her being photographed and the ending credits come up.
I could have used those $10 on some kids' movies in Walmart, I could have gotten at least 3, from a reputable company, well filmed, at least 1 hour film each, and lots of fun for my kid.
The name was so misleading, I still can't believe that Amazon allows these people to scam people like this.",1459555200,,1508,4.332155477031802
