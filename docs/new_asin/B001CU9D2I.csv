3520212,5,B001CU9D2I,"The movie was great. It explained a lot that I didn't know. My Dad was a paratrooper in that battle, but he never spoke about it.",1408838400,,129,4.0
3520213,5,B001CU9D2I,My Grandparents and father were in this camp and rescued.  I appreciated the pictures and story research.  Brings great context to the family stories.,1405555200,,150,5.208333333333333
3520214,5,B001CU9D2I,"For the last 14 years together with my family lives in Los Banos, Mayondon, Showing this documentary to my family makes them more appreciate of what happened there during those times. Highly recommended.",1405468800,2,203,5.181818181818182
3520215,5,B001CU9D2I,"This History Special recounts the story of the legendary WWII liberation of more than 2,000 prisoners from a Japanese POW camp in the Phillipines by men of the 11th Airborne ( ""Hell's Angels"" a.k.a. ""the Angels"") and helped by Phillipino guerilla fighters in what was later described as a textbook operation for all ages by Gen. Colin Powell. My father served with the 11th in the Phillipines and in Japan and I found this documentary to be quite fascinating.",1403049600,4,459,4.822784810126582
3520216,4,B001CU9D2I,"My father was a co pilot on this mission. The historical facts are exactly like he described it. Thank you, Matt.",1397865600,2,113,4.428571428571429
3520217,5,B001CU9D2I,I purchased this for the library of the church wgere Tom Bousman worships today.  He is one of those interviewed who was imprisoned at Los Banos with his family as a teenager.,1371513600,2,175,4.46875
3520218,5,B001CU9D2I,"A very good show very informative, and well produced. The interviews with the P.O.W.S. and the solders who rescued them was well done, and gave me more of an insight how life was as a P.O.W. and the courage of the solders who volunteered to rescue them.",1313020800,3,253,4.404255319148936
3520219,5,B001CU9D2I,"I am a member of the 11 airborne,the daughter of one of it's deceased soldiers. The Los Banos mission was a miracle of coordiating all three, the air, sea and ground with the guerillas of Los Banos. I know the gentlemen in this video and I would say it's the best video of it's kind and the only one i know of that shows you was really happened in the phillipines.
I would recommend this for any history buff.
I will be going to the 65th reunion of the Los Banos angels.

8289756,4,B001CU9D2I,"Good overview of the Los Banos Raid which had no strategic value but a very high moral value.  A lot of the video is spent on the lead-up to the raid, including life before the war and the years of confinement in the internment camp during the war.  Unlike the Cabanatuan Raid, this camp had civilians in it (Cabanatuan was for military prisoners).  What was very special about this video is that actual internment personnel and actual rescue paratroopers were interviewed throughout the video which added an immensely powerful human element.  Also Philippine guerrillas were interviewed through a translator.......so everyone except the Japanese were interviewed.  I visited Cabanatuan and hope to visit Los Banos, albeit Los Banos is far less preserved and this video in conjunctions with some books will be very helpful to understand the site despite massive changes since 1945.",1522281600,,881,5.176056338028169
8289757,5,B001CU9D2I,"Excellent documentary!  My father was on the parachute team, added as bodyguard to Colonel LaFlamme, who also went (but was NOT in command, obviously, Lt. Ringler was in command of the parachute team).  LaFlamme was added late to take responsibility for any high ranking Japanese officials who might be captured (none were) and history didn't even record that he went along (but he did).  My father was his driver (188th 2nd Divison), and as his bodyguard was NOT a trained parachutist but my father was, so LaFlamme asked him to go along.  30 years later my father ran into a civilian at a party who he met while freeing the camp, unbelievable small world!",1492387200,,657,4.7368421052631575
8289758,4,B001CU9D2I,"It is awesome, a lot of my dad's anecdotes came out in the documentary.",1470528000,,71,4.142857142857143
8289759,5,B001CU9D2I,We had read the book and we're excited to see the film. Very interesting to see some of the rescued and rescuers from the book appearing in the film. Very well done.,1458432000,,165,4.1875
8289760,5,B001CU9D2I,A good movie about an important POW rescue of the war often over looked by major battles going on simultaneously.,1457481600,,113,4.7
8289761,5,B001CU9D2I,"My mother was only three years old when my grandfather was taken prisoner as a civilian at Los Banos. I really commend my grandmother for the courage and stamina that she demonstrated for the four years that my grandfather was interned.  She never gave-up hope that he would return to her and my mother, and I thank God daily that I had the opportunity to know my grandfather for 47 years, before he passed away in 1996.",1450051200,,420,4.454545454545454
8289762,5,B001CU9D2I,Well done document about the Los Banos Rescue.  I was very interested in the history that Rescue AT Dawn provided because my Aunt was one of the missionaries that had been a POW at the Los Banos Camp.  I was not disappointed in this well done DVD which showed individuals who where involved in the rescue as well as those who had been interned.,1436572800,,344,4.359375
8289763,5,B001CU9D2I,"Great detail and footage of not only the raid but of the unsung heroes of it, the 11th Airborne (of which my father was a member at this time in the Philippines, Company H of the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment). It's only too bad this story wasn't more known to the general public as it happened the same day the flag went up on Iwo Jima. Taking nothing away from that, this story is one of brilliant planning and even more brilliant execution. Highly recommended for lovers of WW2 history. This one has a bittersweet ending, as the raid was amazingly successful, however the Japanese took revenge out on the Filipino people after it, that's the only negative part. Love the interviews with the prisoners as well as the paratroopers. That makes it. Go watch it......well written, great footage, and it's a great story. Loved this!",1434240000,2,833,4.712328767123288
8289764,5,B001CU9D2I,"My Dad was rescued that day. Had been there 3 year and was in the Death March before that. Thanks to all that took part!

8289765,5,B001CU9D2I,"THIS WAS PERSONAL. MY FATHER IN LAW WAS IN THE 11th AIRBORNE and involved in this rescue at Los Banos. His interview on Los Banos was the reason for this ever coming to life. According to Colin Powell, this was a masterful plan carried out perfectly.",1418601600,,250,4.456521739130435
