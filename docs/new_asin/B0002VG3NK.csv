8032951,5,B0002VG3NK,"The video shows very detail of each skill and drill while video clips on youtube or social medias are free, but not really cover details as much as I want.  It also covers how to choose sticks: lie, blade pattern, length. All questions I have, I can find answers in this DVDs. It's good for all levels, maybe a little too much for beginners, great serious hockey players.  It's worth to buy.",1489622400,,391,4.416666666666667

8032954,5,B0002VG3NK,"this is an excellent series with 100s of moves to practice. This is the best Skinner video collection that he offers in my opinion. It has everything including individual drills, dekes, coaches drills, and dry-land training. Definitely worth the money",1420848000,,251,5.3
8032955,5,B0002VG3NK,Very helpful . Very well done dvd set.,1408924800,,38,3.875
8032956,5,B0002VG3NK,"If you play Ice Hockey and want to improve your stickhandling, get this DVD set. Sean Skinner is amazing, watch him on Youtube, search on Sean Skinner and Ovechkin, he's better than Ovechkin. The only downside to the DVDs is that there is so much information. Great for coaches and players. I improved my stickhandling 3x from these DVDs.

The DVDs contain the following:

DVD 1 - Stickhandling Theory & Preparation
DVD 2 - Stickhandling Agility Techniques
DVD 3 - The Moves, Fakes and Dekes
DVD 4 - On Ice Drills and Drills for Coaches
DVD 5 - Dryland Training for Stickhandling",1355270400,,579,4.666666666666667
8032957,5,B0002VG3NK,"this is a 5dvd set,  absolutely amazing,  ton of info., great way to develop a sick skill set.  sean will progress you through all the steps in a very doable manner.  as a player, and a coach i highly recommend this product, if more americans buy this and learn to be team players, we will soon be on par with the canadians. roughly 10 hr.s of video, alot to digest, will help take players to another level if the player is dedicated to practicing and applying, you will see the art of stickhandling differently. you will see the sound techniques and priciples instead of just quick hands and freestyling.  now if you already have quick,soft hands........  WATCH OUT,HERE COMES THE CLINIC!",1200960000,7,689,4.652892561983471
