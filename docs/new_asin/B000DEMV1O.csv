8156675,5,B000DEMV1O,"This is perhaps the best film I have ever seen. It's like Jackass, only the film's creators have bothered to put some effort in creating stunts that aren't disgusting and a plot that is so simplistic its hilarious. If only this version of the film had English subtitles.",1215475200,,270,4.645833333333333
8156676,1,B000DEMV1O,"Do not waste your time on this movie unless you spend your days

playing the nastiest practical jokes on your friends

(kind of crashing their TV-sets or cars).

Throughout the film a group of friends does stupid things

(e.g., they take sleeping pills and then go roller-skating at night),

and there is nothing unexpected at the end.",1170633600,,335,4.807017543859649
