8239699,3,B00110FM8I,The video has many good historical films or movie footage of LST's in action during the pacific war.  The narration is good and informative.  The sequence of Okinawa showed primarely a crew fighting a fire on an LST.  The crew actions appeared to be laize faire.  More action involved kamikazes attacking LST's at Okinawa and no footage of that was shown.,1315526400,,355,4.770491803278689
