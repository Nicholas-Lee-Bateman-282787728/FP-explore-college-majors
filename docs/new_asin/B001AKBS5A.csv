8277913,4,B001AKBS5A,"This is a double feature VCI DVD-R with 2 1936 features from Puritan Pictures.  Both features look good with minor dialogue splices.  ""Roarin' Guns"" runs for 64 minutes(sources give running time as anywhere from 59 to 71).  ""The Traitor"" runs 56 minutes(sources give 58-60).  Both are very entertaining Tim McCoy westerns with original titles.",1356825600,,343,5.296296296296297
