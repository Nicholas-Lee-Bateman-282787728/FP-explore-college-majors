1808533,5,B00007G1Z6,"I didn't have hopes for this movie being good. I was pleasantly surprised. Great story, great acting. A fun and not depressing comming of age story for a handsome 16 year old boy in Mexico City. He gets a surprise move in for what he thinks is a 11 year old girl cousin, she has grown up to be a hot hot hot older woman. He can't stop dreaming about her..she is dumped on by her neglectfull boyfriend..He lets his dreams be know to her...she eventually gives in to his strong boyish drive to be with an older woman...Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Que cosita linda Mama.",1103414400,22,561,4.456310679611651
1808534,5,B00007G1Z6,I first saw this movie when I was in Mexico about a decade ago.  Many of you will feel identified with this kid who falls in love with an older woman who lives next door.  Everything is about the forbidden desire for a teenager in Mexico in the 1990's.  I cannot wait for the DVD release.  You will see a different movie which will send you back to your teenage years.,1085097600,16,368,4.140845070422535

7975920,4,B00007G1Z6,This is a typical coming-of-age movie about a teen growing up while he is trying to discover the opposite gender and developing fascination about it. A dream-come-true kind of script which leaves a sweet after-taste.,1390694400,,216,5.2
7975921,5,B00007G1Z6,"Jose Alonso, the young actor who has had a continued acting career, does a great job in navigating family and young adolescent turmoil.  His friend and he are so real and comical as they attempt to grow up, especially, in their new open attraction to females.  As the cover summary says ""he would have an unforgettable experience---his sexual initiation.""  And that with an older cousin!  Some of his adventures with his friend are ""laugh out loud"" events.  Recommend for high school and mature junior high students.  Youth today will be aware of comparable experiences by their friends or themselves!",1366761600,,601,5.02020202020202
7975922,4,B00007G1Z6,"THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT. BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED. SURPRISED THOUGH THAT NEITHER OF THE TWO BOYS EVER SUGGESTED THEY WERE TAKING CARE OF THEIR FANTASIES THE SUPPOSED TRADITIONAL WAY, UNTIL THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE THAT FIRST SCORE, ESPECIALLY THE CO-STAR WHO GOT OVERLY EXCITED ON TOP OF THAT ROOF, ALTHOUGH HE DID SEEM TO HINT WHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO DO, WHEN THE MAIN PLAYER SHOWED HIM THE PAINTIES. DO BUY THIS MOVIE. ITS WORTH IT.",1338163200,,429,4.512820512820513
