2262000,4,B00094ARGY,"I loved this series and am so disappointed to see an end. The second season showed more of a character developement and explained more as to the workings of things. Am in love with all the characters! The only reason I gave four stars instead of five was because in the second season the writers, in order to do more character developement, had moved away from the ""reaping"". I LOVED watching the reaps and was a little let down during the last few episodes because of this. But, if there had been a third season they could have gone and done a little for both ""characters"" and ""reaps"" since they had laid more of the gridwork already. If you want to check it, i wrote a review for season one. And, I will leave this the same way. . .It is a crying shame they discontinued this series!!!!",1114300800,5,788,4.331081081081081
2262001,5,B00094ARGY,"July 2007 Update!!!!!!  There is going to be a movie!  So the first sentence in my original review below turns out to be inaccurate.  Star Ellen Muth goes so far as to hint that that a renewal of the series might be possible.  Details are still forthcoming and apart from the movie (and I'm sorry, I don't know if this is a TV, a direct-to-DVD, or theatrical release) nothing definite is known about the chances of the series being revived, but this is definitely good news.  There is some recasting.  Mandy Patinkin, unfortunately, will not be back as Rube nor will Laura Harris as Daisy.  It appears Rube's character is being replaced by a new head reaper, while a new actress will be playing Daisy.  Otherwise all the other actors will be back.

Tragically, this will be the final season of DEAD LIKE ME that we will get.  Although there is currently a campaign being waged to rescue the show, these campaigns inevitably and unfortunately result in failure.  The cancellation of the show is hard to explain.  It isn't as if Showtime has such a great string of hit shows that their valuable time slots had to be freed up for new critical and popular hit series.  The fact is that DEAD LIKE ME was the finest show the network ever hosted, and its cancellation is both a blow to quality television on Showtime in particular but also television as a whole.  The past few years have seen a host of the very best shows on television get cancelled.  The list is long and contains some very impressive shows:  FIREFLY, ANGEL, WONDERFALLS, KAREN SISCO, FARSCAPE, and many others.  My lone cause for hope for the short term future of quality television is that LOST enjoyed such tremendous success in its first season that networks are currently scrambling for long story arc shows with well written, deeply interconnected scripts that typified all of the shows I mentioned above.  Maybe, just maybe, the tide has turned.  Unfortunately, not soon enough to save DEAD LIKE ME.

In its first season, DEAD LIKE ME quickly established itself as one of the quirkiest and finest shows on television.  As any watcher of the show will know, Georgia Lass was a young girl who became a grim reaper after dying in a bizarre accident.  The show explored what it means to be alive through the struggles of one who was no longer alive, but who nonetheless still was confronted with the need to persist in a world in which in many ways she no longer belonged.  Issues of friendship, work, belonging, responsibility were all dealt with in clever, intelligent, and funny ways.  The great news for those who haven't seen this series (and there are many who don't have Showtime and therefore rely on DVDs for their experience with the show) is that Season Two is a much, much better season than the first.  Without exception, the writers manage to develop and expand all of the major characters, with the exception of George's father, who plays a lessened role.  George becomes a far richer character, finally at ease with being a reaper and acknowledging that she has responsibilities.  Her challenge in Season Two is deciding what she wants with the unlife that she has.  She struggles with issues of love, and grows considerably as a human being.  Even more than George, Rube (Mandy Patinkin) becomes a more complex, interesting character.  In a slowly developed story arc, we learn more about Rube's life, we get glimpses of his family (he learns that a daughter he fathered in real life is still living, and he visits her in a nursing home immediately before her death), and are given some hints as to his death (the results of a bank robbery, the details of which might have been explored in Season Three).  Mason, without ceasing to be a bit of a clown (in one episode, ""Send in the Clown,"" literally), is revealed in far more complex and interesting person than he did in Season One, while Daisy Adair becomes vastly more than the mere self-obsessed sexpot she was earlier.  In fact, Daisy becomes a many layered, sympathetic, impossible-to-predict individual.  In particular, her relationship with Mason, who is completely smitten with her, is developed in great detail.  George discovers that her parents are divorcing and that they are selling the house she grew up in, and we see her mother exploring new romance, and we watch her relationship with her daughter Reggie gain some depth as George's sister gradually comes out of the shellshock that gripped her in the first season following George's death.

What is remarkable to me is that the show managed to become richer and more complex on virtually every level, all while generating a string of great individual episodes.  The frustrating thing about the show not being renewed is that there were a host of unexplored possibilities, so many unanswered questions.  Would George manage to find love?  Would her parents reconcile or find new relationships?  Would her mother find a buyer for the house?  Just how did Rube die, and was it related to the bank robbery?  Would anything ever happen between Daisy and Mason?  And there were a host of life experiences that had not yet been explored.  There was unquestionably a large amount of room for many more stories.

DEAD LIKE ME is a great example of a show that doesn't fit traditional entertainment economic categories.  It was produced by MGM television, but shown on Showtime.  The latter at least in part declined to renew the show because its rating were not strong, while MGM wanted it to be renewed in part because of the strong DVD sales.  We have seen a number of shows that have enjoyed weak ratings on TV experience huge DVD sales.  FIREFLY, FAMILY GUY, and WONDERFALLS are three examples.  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is one of the best selling TV series ever on DVD, but never enjoyed especially large ratings on TV.  My guess is that at some point the television production companies are going to have to work something out with the broadcast and cable networks to make it more attractive for the networks to keep shows that are highly successful on DVD but that do not get great ratings on the air.  At present, most of the benefit of keeping DEAD LIKE ME on would have primarily benefited MGM, but not Showtime.  Last year Twentieth Century Fox (not to be confused with FOX TV; though both have the same parent company, they are separate companies) very much wanted to keep ANGEL going because of its strong DVD sales, but the WB wanted to go in new directions (bad directions, it turned out, since none of its shows this year have gathered the ratings that ANGEL did, nor have any enjoyed the critical acclaim that it did).  More and more overall viewership of TV series is declining, while DVD sales and rentals of TV shows is increasing.  This is good for production companies, but bad for networks, and some formula needs to be found to make it good for both.  ANGEL was cancelled in part because Twentieth Century Fox refused to reduce the amount it charged the WB to show the series.  Until the production companies agree to help close the loss of income the networks are experiencing, I think we are going to see a lot of shows that have a small but dedicated audience fail to be renewed.  Everyone loses.  The production company loses the opportunity to sell their product to the networks and the potential DVD sales.  The networks lose because they are getting cheaper but more mediocre product.  And the fans of shows lose because they find high quality shows like DEAD LIKE ME pushed aside for blander and less interesting programming.

At least we have two very fine seasons to watch of this very, very good series.  We can only hope that the television industry can find the right alchemy to make it possible for superb series like this survive in the future.",1114041600,441,7775,4.714074074074074
2262002,5,B00094ARGY,"I loved Season 1 and then I loved Season 2 even more because the actors seemed more comfortable in their roles and they really got to grow their characters, especially the lead, Ellen Muth. You see such growth and change in all of the characters -- and that's what good drama is all about. And it was also hysterically funny in many parts.

  I was very upset when they cancelled the show, but you know, that's OK. The way Season 2 ended, you got the feeling that everthing was going to be OK with George and that she really got to embrace her role as a reaper... It's almost as if it was time for the series to close...

  Though i would LOVE it if it came back to cable...",1113782400,6,674,4.1461538461538465
2262003,3,B00094ARGY,"I liked Season 1 very, very much.  It was interesting, thought provoking, and even laugh-out-loud funny from time to time.  All in all, a great, great show.

Then, this happened.

Season two has a number of problems, many of which are admittedly nitpicks.

One: George suddenly becomes obsessed with clothes,at least in comparison to season one.  She gets an advance from work and her eyes light up at the prospect of a designer jacket.  Why, I ask you, would they change her?  Are they trying to say that it is a healthy step forward for someone to decide that they like wearing expensive clothes?  It was an unnecessary, unexplained character alteration.

Two: Daisy randomly becomes Catholic partway through and henceforth acts completelly different.  Now mind you, I myself am Catholic, so I obviously don't have a problem with her for /that/ reason.  The problem is that it A) makes no sense, and B) neuters the character.  None of the reasons that Daisy was interesting in the first season carried over to the bulk of the second season.  She was boring and pointless.

Three: the middle half or so of the season depressed me dreadfully.  After watching those episodes, I felt myself fall into a deep funk.  Season one delicatelly balanced comedy with tragedy to neutralize and eliminate despair.  Season two didn't.  It began and ended ok, but the middle was depressing.  Not even the good kind of depressing (the kind that's cathartic kind).  This was the kind that is unnecessary and cruel.

Four: continuity, or rather lackthereof.  Get this: Season One's finale is the 1st aniversary of George's death, and it is the day her headstone is added to her grave (they make a point of showing it being carved).  Season Two's finale takes place on the first Halloween after her death, which had to have happened before the first aniversary of her death, and her mother and sister spend the night at her grave, headstone and all (I do believe).  This still means that Season Two and Season One's episodes are all jumbled out of order with each other, which throws a lot of the episodes out of whack.

Five: by the end of the season, my patience over all the near-miss confrontations between Geroge and her family had begun to wear thin.  It just got tired of all the times they came so close to seeing each other, and then not.

Six: I know that one of the other reviewers saw it as a virtue that their roles became more strongly defined, but I personally strongly dislike this.  Any sitcom can have The Father, The Mother, The Screw-Up, etc.  It takes something better to have characters that are complciated, characters that have some gray to their personalities, characters that are /people/.

This could have been worse, but it should have been much better.",1113609600,12,2763,4.753684210526316
2262004,5,B00094ARGY,"It seems that every show that i like gets cancelled.  Wonderfalls, Life As We Know It, Popular and now Dead Like Me.  The first season of this show was excellent and the second season was even better because it explored the characters even deeper and it was hilarious.  The day this dvd hits stores, i am going to get it and i recommend that everyone do the same.",1113004800,11,363,4.3088235294117645
2262005,5,B00094ARGY,"I hate that this show was cancelled. Cable TV used to be a safehaven for excellent scripted series like this one. Now ""Dead Like Me"" is gone, and its been replaced by ""Fat Actress."" It seems that reality TV is invading even the premium channels now - its unfortunate. ""Dead Like Me"" was the best and yes, most successful show on Showtime's lineup, and the only reason it was cancelled was because the head of the network didn't really find it to his taste.

DLM, excellent in its first season, really hit its stride in season 2. All the characters were already well established, so the second season really allowed them to open up and do some interesting things, and the acting was never better. George (Ellen Muth) has adjusted to her death but still hasn't forgotten her family. Her family (Cynthia Stevenson, Greg Kean, Britt McKillip) is still affected by the loss of George but begin to recover and establish themselves as individuals - especially Reggie (McKillip), who is one of the best characters in the show this season. Thats saying something, considering that all of the reapers (Callum Blue, Jasmine Guy, Laura Harris, Mandy Patinkin) are all at the top of their game as well. Rube (Patinkin) becomes even more of a father figure to the reapers, especially George, while at the same time beginning to reflect on his life, something he stayed far away from in season 1. Roxy's (Guy) identity becomes more defined, and Mason (Blue) is EXCELLENT as the screw-up older brother figure to George, and his pursual of Daisy (Harris), provides much of the hilarity as well as a good deal of the season's emotion. Daisy, who was added midway through season 1, is now a fully established character and it reflections into her past that provides many of the questions that will unfortunately be left unanswered due to the show's premature cancellation.

I can't wait for the season to reach DVD. Season two really turned DLM into a week-to-week addiction, and its episodes are among the series' best. The show is definately the funniest and most moving its ever been, and I'm not ashamed to say that I'll be counting down the days until July 19th.",1112745600,136,2148,4.7560321715817695

He's a great actor and his character as Rube (as in Goldberg, as in chain reaction stuff) made the chemistry whole.  I do regret the loss of Rebecca Gayheart, but her method of leaving was quite interesting in Season One.  I just could not ""warm"" to Laura Harris' character.

2262269,2,B00094ARGY,"I am surprised to see so many strong reviews.  I watched the first season and am only one disc into the second season, and I really don't know if I will watch any more of it.  There are so many good and interesting series out there, and this is not one of them.

This is a series that deals with life and death, so, the writers try to sound wise and insightful, dropping bits of life wisdom here and there.  To me, it sounded like people without wisdom attempting to share the little wisdom they have, which is not much.

In ""Six Feet Under"" each death was carefully thought out and often bizarre.  Here, the deaths seem stupidly bizarre, beginning with the first, being hit by a meteor.

In fact, this appears to be a series which was perhaps written by the rejected writers for ""Six Feet Under.""

Because this series deals with death, the writers attempt to make what their character say sound profound, but what they say is never even close to profound.  Seems like the main character talked about how she is on-time more since she has been dead; and her discussion of that with herself (as the narrator) is a good example of the limits of profundity to be found herein.

If you love hearing characters swear constantly, using the F-word as a verb, adjective and noun, this might be the show for you.  Also, ""Jesus"" and ""Christ"" are used irreverently--somewhat strange for a show pretends to have some sort of reverence/interest in death.

All shows require you to buy into their premises, and some, the show is so watchable, that you accept them, sometimes no matter how fantastic they are.  I find myself questioning the premise of this show, that these are ""reapers"" who reap souls.  They look exactly like you and me; they are seen by everyone (although not as they looked in life); they are all able to assume new identities in order to work, because they must work in order to find a place to live.  This would include a character who becomes a police woman, because, apparently, their background checks would not turn up that she is not a real person.

These reapers go out and take the souls out of people right before they die, but, in many cases, the people still talk, think, and interact after their souls are removed.  When you find yourself questioning the show's premises, it indicates that the show has not really taken a hold of you.

How do I put this in a different way?  The setup seems to be designed to make it easy for the writers to write.

The characters are too broadly drawn and lack depth.  I have very little interest in any of them, apart from the 10 year old ""sister"" of the lead actress, who is more interesting than any of the other characters (not that she is a great actress; not that it is a great role; it is simply the most interesting person on the entire show).

I don't even like the beginning montage, although it is an apt setup for the show to follow.  Everywhere you look, there are reapers (and, of course, you do not know who they are).

I have watched the first season, and I am on disc2 of season two; I do not know that I will even finish the season out.  I have almost no interest in the future of any of these characters; and the development that they undergo from episode to episode is mostly underwhelming.

One last thing: the music is good, for the most part.  I watch (ed) the opening montage for the music.",1467849600,,3367,4.423701298701299

2262486,5,B00094ARGY,"Why do they always kill the good shows?  Two seasons of this and American Idol still isn't dead kinda makes you wonder a bit.  Ellen Muth does a wonderful job of portraying the typical ""I don't get a shiot"" teenager who questions every aspect of society.  The remainder of the Cast does a good job in the supporting role but I find it tragic as George had so much more to show us as they barely scratched the surface in two seasons.  Sad they waited till 2009 to try an revive a show about dead people had they tried sooner and with the original cast I feel it would have been successful.  Rest in Peace George and may a toilet seat from space hit the morons who killed this series........",1455580800,,689,4.269230769230769

2262513,5,B00094ARGY,Season 2 was great. George feels more comfortable in her role as a reaper and realizes she has a little something extra the others don't.  The audience learns more about the lives of the characters and the trouble they get into is a nailbiter.  All in all the dark humor is great and the characters reveal more about themselves. I think that death has many facets and  this season captured it.  Love the series.,1454976000,,411,4.513513513513513

It has an 8.2 rating (34,101 Votes) on IMDB, so was quite popular when it was released in June of 2003. The people that belong to the churches of Christendom should love it, because it supports the concept that the earth is nothing more than a incubator for angels and devils. Our life experiences and how we react, is what prepares us for one or the other after death. But what about those people that don't have enough experience to make the cut?

2262961,4,B00094ARGY,"George, or Geogia was a sarcastic little brat who got killed by a toilet seat that from the space station that when burning up in the atmosphere made it through and landed on her taking her out for good.  She finds that the after life for her isn't heaven or hell, but a job with an odd collection of older ""ghosts"" (quote because they are seen by the living but differently than when they were alive, wouldn't want mom bumping into you and stroking out).  But she finds out she is a reaper.  Gets a post it note (or 2 or none) from her boss each day with a name, location and ETD (Estimated time of death) before which she has to ""tag"" them by touching them thus marking them for some cantankerous critters who then proceed to setup some accident for them (or some other fateful ending).  She also has a job at ""Happy Time"", a temp agency.  She is basically negative and oozing with attitude but funny in her own way, and a way that grows on you.  Her crew are misfits, they all seem to be grimm reapers because they had issues in life and this is their purgatory of sorts.  Who knows, theology is not Dead Like Me's thing at even a surface level.  It is a comedy and it is basically a formula show with a bunch of oddballs that make humor by being themselves.  It has some sad, some conceptually gross (they don't show much), but a basic comedy that grows on you in time which allowed me to stream two seasons in a couple of months.  Not a fast paced pickup on the humor but there was only so much to get.  Very different this show, but that was its positive, a change of pace which was good for a filler as time required.  Two seasons of 15 shows was about what this show had in it, and was nice in that it provided what it had to offer and then wrapped up on an appropriate note.  I liked the series and it provided an extremely unique style of humor.  Never saw a show quite like it and don't expect I ever will... but it is worth watching.  The point to writing this is that for a run of two seasons this show is unique and worth taking the time to watch.  It's not for everyone I'm sure, but for those with a dry sense of humor it will strike you as funny.  I doubt I'll find another show that I say ""this reminds me of Dead Like Me"", but that is the up side to the show.  It won't leave you laughing until it hurts but it will make you laugh just as it will make you wonder what its about.  Took me a while to stop searching as it isn't deep, it simply is what it is.  So if your thinking of purchasing it, don't.  If you thinking of watching it then I recommend you do, give it a chance and around episode 5 you'll have the answer as to whether you'll like it or not.  I did, hope you do to!",1438992000,,2700,4.045197740112994

The characters compliment each other very well and create dynamic interactions that highlight the absurdity of human neuroses and personalities in a fun and loveable way.

2263122,4,B00094ARGY,"I thought this was a very entertaining show.  It ran its course and really never found an audience.  Possibly because it had such a dark topic.  I felt it was really ahead of its time and if started today may have actually done much better.  The relationship between Rube and George is one of the most complicated ever attempted on television.  I thought they did a great job with wrapping the series up in the last episode.  Seems as if they knew they would not be renewed.  Therefore the series feels more like a very long mini-series or movie that actually has a conclusion.  The movie that followed was not bad, a lot of fans did not enjoy, but I liked it.  It was a bit unnecessary but a not a bad addition.  If you like good stories with meaning, complex themes and witty banter, you will enjoy.",1430265600,,801,4.351351351351352

2263128,5,B00094ARGY,"One of my favorite-if not the favorite--TV shows ever.  Funny, quirky and often down right weird.  About grim reapers who have to touch soon- to-be-departed people to release their souls at death.  Most imaginative ways to die you could ever imagine.  All the reapers gather in the waffle shop to get their post-it assignments from Rube--Mandy Patinkin--to find out who they have to touch.  Just a first initial and last name and estimated place and time of death.  So they have to figure out who is about to die.  There is also a sub-plot concerning George's (Ellen Muth) family and how they are dealing with her death as their lives continue.  George was hit by a space toilet seat and then became a reaper...Also, the reapers have to find their own income and lodging.  They are on their own except for the reaping part...",1429920000,,825,4.673611111111111

I was looking for a show to watch while waiting for Haven to start up again and in between episodes of Supernatural; this show simply does not fit the bill. The protagonist is sort of dull in a positive way for the first few episodes but then she starts to be like a friend you have but don't really want to talk to...ever.

However, though I didn't like Season 2 as a whole AS WELL, I did have some favorite episodes in that season.  I liked Season 1 generally, but didn't have a particularly favorite episode.

Their job is to remove souls from people seconds before their death to prevent suffering.
It is hard to describe this show, but it is actually quite funny and even touching at times. These facts overshadow the dark theme of the show.

The story was left unfinished when Reggie became aware of her sister's presence at the cemetery as she and Joy were paying respects to Georgia's grave.

As I started watching the series, I became entrenched in the duality of life and death and how many of is take so many things for granted in life until faced with death.  I really like the way this series was delivered; it had everything, happy, sad, funny and some just right down to earth.  Really makes a person think and maybe, that was the intention of the writers.

I SOOO wish this show had gone into more seasons!!!  (That said, the movie that was made from it a few years later, that does not have Patinkin in it, is not worth the time to watch it, IMO.

2263365,4,B00094ARGY,"Georgia Lass is a college drop-out, a cynical teen with no ambition, no interests and no friends. Her mother finally gives her an ultimatum... get a job and move out... so she puts in an application at the temp agency Happy Time and is sent out as a file clerk. On her first day, during her 20 minute ""lunch hour"" she is killed in a fluke accident caused by falling debris (a toilet seat) from a space station. She doesn't realize what has happened until  Rube (Mandy Patinkin) points out her body. He explains that walking into the light isn't for her, she's been drafted into a team of grim reapers.

So this is the story of her after life. All of the reapers on Rube's team are people who died with unresolved issues. They meet each morning at Der Waffle House to get their assignments, distributed by Rube on yellow sticky notes. Reapers' appearance is different to the living than it was when they were alive and they go by  different names. This time around, she is Millie.  She quickly discovers that being a reaper isn't a paid position and doesn't come with benefits, so she ends up back at Happy Time looking for work, this time with more motivation to find it. One of my favorite quotes is ""What kind of a universe would give me the power to remove people's souls from their bodies, but make me keep a suck-ass job if I want to eat?""

The subject matter is not for young people and there is a lot of bad language, but it's really funny! Unfortunately it only lasted two seasons, but this is the second time we've watched it and I'm enjoying it as much as I did the first time.",1415923200,,1587,4.347972972972973

2263423,4,B00094ARGY,"Good show, kind of a dark comedy.  Premise: Eighteen year old Georgia ""George"" Lass dies (hit by a piece of space debris falling out of orbit) and learns that instead of ""moving on"" she is to be a grim reaper, taking souls from others who are about to die and escorting them to the afterlife.  She works with a team of others with their personality conflicts and they go about their existence in a bumbling sort of way since not all deaths go easily.  On top of that George tries to deal with her new life while following her family's reactions to her death, especially her younger sister.

I didn't really think the subject of people dying would make for much comedy but the writers did well to show that while sometimes tragic, its also a part of life and how people deal with death can be as important as how they deal with life.  The show was cancelled after only two seasons but the producers were able to wrap up the loose ends with a direct-to-video movie.  Woulda been nice to see how some other things developed.  Ellen Muth, who plays George, hasn't done much since the show went off but I thought she was pretty good at playing a girl who went from shirking responsibility to handling some very upsetting responsibilities.  Mandy Patinkin was as good as he always is and very solid as the reapers' boss who gives out their daily assignments.",1409961600,,1352,4.489795918367347

2263448,4,B00094ARGY,"One of the best little shows that couldn't.  Well, it did for 2 seasons, and it's hard to fathom why Showtime cut it loose so unceremoniously after it's short but successful run.  Some creative differences near the beginning of its first season caused something of an upheaval when series creator Bryan Fuller stepped away from the helm and Rebecca Gayheart's character Betty was written out after episode 5.  But her replacement, Laura Harris (Daisy Adair) more than amply filled the void, and in my opinion, became one of the show's linchpins, giving consistently fine performances in each episode.  Cynthia Stevenson was strong as ever.  And Mandy Patinkin was just simply marvelous throughout.

During its run, the show developed a loyal and vocal following (including me) whose clamoring after its cancellation was largely responsible for the production of a follow-up movie in 2009, which was misbegotten and bland.  Some of the original shows weakness became glaringly obvious as the stable of actors couldn't make up for bad writing.  Most notably Callum Blue and Laura Harris' replacement Sarah Wynter, who was just horrible.  Also missing was Mandy Patinkin as Rube Sofer, replaced by a smirking, self-involved prick played by Henry Ian Cusick, fresh off his success in ""Lost"".

I think the saddest part for me was that I could never really warm up to the main character, George.  I'm not sure why.  Is Ellen Muth unappealing?  Was her character miswritten?  I don't know, but I never found myself rooting for her, and I should have been... she was killed by a toilet-seat-from-space at the ripe age of 18, for chrissakes.  Interestingly, it was somewhat fitting that Ellen Muth's (Georgia ""George"" Lass) last words of dialog at the end of season 2 were ""... dead lie me"", a prophetic utterance indeed.",1408406400,,1812,5.033557046979865

The premise is a hoot and the combination of Reapers makes the story.  But just how many souls need be reaped before it becomes mundane?  That just might be the saving grace to the show.  It finishes before it fades.

Ellen Muth is anything but the average young lady.  She is a great young actress.  She plays ""Peanut""/George as if that were her.  This is a worthwhile series to watch and laugh at and with as long as you're not hung up about death.",1405382400,,569,4.242990654205608

2263536,5,B00094ARGY,"Let me start out by saying I am a big fan of the series (5 stars yes) .

I typically go through a television series all at once, not on a weekly basis. Doing this places me in that world and while I am watching the series many of my thoughts are on the series. Sorta like when I am writing a story. I like seeing a charater arc over a couple weeks instead of a couple years. Curiously, I loved this world, although I really did not like many of the characters.

However, the show has so many plot, logic and character holes, far too many times I was watching the show and saying ""oh come on . . . ."" It was a frustrating viewing experience which makes it understandable why the series never lasted beyond its second season. Still the Dead like Me world was fascinating.  Reapers, death divisions, post-it notes, the other side - just a lot of good otherworldly stuff.

The show sorta falls on its face by almost centering on the protagonist's former life family. Perhaps if it just centered on the little sister that would have been okay, but every time they went to the former mother and father I got pulled out of the reaper world into the drama world of a million other TV shows.

Still, I had to keep watching, regardless of its flaws.

BTW, contrary to many viewers, I felt the DVD movie sequel to the second season was pretty good and warpped up the series nicely . . . with a slight chance (not gonna happen)  for a renewal.",1397001600,,1431,4.25830258302583
2263537,5,B00094ARGY,"This series had the perfect cast, and a premise like no other before, or since.  The subject matter was based on the questions we all have: Who am I?  Why am I here?  Is there life after death?  Why do bad things happen to good people?  Maybe that's why it lasted only two seasons.  It made us think, and offered us the opportunity to respond to what we'd heard, and seen in ways that could not only make our life different, but the lives of those around us as well.

2263570,5,B00094ARGY,"I stumbled across this show several years ago on Netflix and liked it so much--Mandy Patinkin was one of the stars and I like his work--he's quick, quirky, grumpy, and very funny.--I mourned for several days when I discovered the series had NOT been continued after the second season.  The premise-- when they die certain people don't go towards the light--they become ""grim reapers"" and must reap the souls of people scheduled or preordained to die at certain times. The main focus of the show is on eighteen year old Georgia (called George) who becomes a grim reaper after being killed in an explosion caused by a piece of the Russian Space station Mir falling to earth. George is the classic bad attitude late teen--college dropout, sullen, on the outs with her family, in a nowhere job. When her life is suddenly snuffed out and she becomes a reaper she goes through the classic stages of grief--and Patinkin's character tells her that something must be unfinished for her. George reluctantly adjusts to her new job and joins the eclectic group of other reapers who meet with Rube (Patinkin) regularly to get their reaping assignments.  The show is very funny but also quite poignant as each character over the course of the two seasons reveals the small things (or big things) in their lives that have caused them such regret in death.

2263577,3,B00094ARGY,Was not nearly as good as the first season but then also the show just ends. The made for TV movie that comes after this pretty much just ruined the show for me. I think the show honestly was before it's time.,1392076800,,209,4.0
2263578,4,B00094ARGY,This was a surprisingly interesting series. I wish they would have a couple more seasons to mature and flesh out the storyline.,1392076800,,127,4.818181818181818
2263599,3,B00094ARGY,"Started out great, with a lot of promise. There's a few episodes that were quite good (check out the last one of season 2), but after a while, it was just ""sad"" and not in a good way.",1391990400,,183,3.8421052631578947

2263604,3,B00094ARGY,i really enjoyed the first season. season 2 was somewhat boring. the writers and cast lost their zeal for making show.,1391385600,,118,4.666666666666667

2263606,4,B00094ARGY,I'm getting older and death doesn't seem as funny as when I first watched this but the series is fun and very respectful of death and the living can understand Georgia's loss of self and her struggle getting use to her new normal.,1391126400,,230,4.372093023255814
2263607,5,B00094ARGY,"I loved this show when it was aired...They even made a movie.

2263608,5,B00094ARGY,It was awesome. I laughed so hard that I almost died and became a grim reaper.  I'm sad it was cancelled.,1390867200,,105,4.0

2263621,4,B00094ARGY,"Great show, too soon canceled. )nly 2 seasons. When the suits at the networks only use one metric to measure the number of viewers, they overlook how strongly the fan base feels about liking it. Some networks (not Showtime) are using OTHER metrics. an example of this is tweets and f/b likes. Some shows take more than 2 seasons to find their audience and for their audience to find THEM. The BEST example of fan pressure creating a different metric was the Startrek series franchise.",1390089600,,484,4.705882352941177

2263623,5,B00094ARGY,"I enjoyed this last season, the writers had some really great story arcs, this season is definitely better than the first. Too bad the execs didn't think it was good enough for a renewal.",1389225600,,187,4.529411764705882

2263625,4,B00094ARGY,"Conceptually interesting and highly entertaining, this show is one of my favorites. Although the reaper ""rules"" are not totally consistent, the characters are so complex and delightfully amusing that it's easy to overlook. It's different and refreshing. Such a pity it only ran for two seasons.",1388793600,,294,5.413043478260869
2263626,5,B00094ARGY,I just love the show. I watch the show on my roku player. And sometime watch the show over and over .,1388793600,,101,3.6363636363636362
2263627,5,B00094ARGY,"When this series originally aired, I really enjoyed it and was sad to have it end.  The characters each have a certain charm to them and the roles are very well done.  The story, with 'George' as the main character, is really quite tragic but the added humor creates a solid balance.  Series that have this sort of edge to them have a way of making the possibilities 'after death' a little more intriquing!",1388793600,,406,4.45945945945946
2263628,5,B00094ARGY,My daughter asked for this as well as season 1 for Christmas.  She was thrilled to receive both and put a smile on her face.,1388707200,,124,3.96
2263629,5,B00094ARGY,"I really like the irreverent humor. The cast works well together.
We are told that after we die all our cares and worries are gone, but this show makes you think about that assumption.
Just my opinion.",1388534400,,201,4.45945945945946
2263630,5,B00094ARGY,"I enjoyed this show because it is unique and requires imagination!  It is nice to watch someone that is original and that is able to hold my attention.  The young actress who plays the lead, Ellen Muth, is tremendous and I enjoy how the characters play off of one another.  In addition, I was pleased to see Jasmine Guy acting again after the series she did by Bill Cosby.  Not to mention Mandy Patinkin (from Criminal Minds too!) and Cynthia Stephenson that have been actors in many shows.

It is just a fun show to watch and I enjoy it immensely!",1388361600,,548,4.3861386138613865
2263631,4,B00094ARGY,"The support players are so strong, it makes up for a bit of a lackluster star (Ellen Muth was much better in Dolores Claiborne). The story lines are interesting. ""George"" kind of grew on me after a while. She redeemed herself in one of the episodes, which made her less of a snotty teenager. In the end I loved her relationship with her boss, Delores Herbig--""as in her big brown eyes."" It was nice that her mother, played by Cynthia Stevenson, was also humanized. By the end of season 2, the writers did well by both characters. I ended up watching all seasons and the special ""movie"" version episode that wrapped everything up nicely.",1386547200,,636,4.587719298245614
2263632,5,B00094ARGY,Great story line that doesn't try to explain too much of the afterlife.  A great cast of characters. Death - It's a fickle business (without pay),1386374400,,145,4.576923076923077

2263636,3,B00094ARGY,"Kind of a let-down from Season 1, but it still has Mandy Patinkin. I kept waiting for him to say, ""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You kill my father, prepare to die.""

Spoiler: the episode where ""JD"" is killed was totally unnecessary. Maybe it's because I love my dogs so much...",1384819200,,281,4.403846153846154
2263637,4,B00094ARGY,"A very original and well thought out show.  I fund myself getting a bit tired of the vignettes about George's family's problems, but the situations George got into were delightful.  I could barely wait to watch the next episode and finished the entire season in just four days. The movie did not do justice to the original show.",1384646400,,328,4.637931034482759
2263638,4,B00094ARGY,Reggie's character PISSES me off. What an arrogant bitch. She takes everything she's been given for granted. She should treat her mom with the respect she deserves. I can't stand her attitude. It makes me sick. She is such a downer. Go away negative vibes.,1384560000,,256,4.711111111111111

2263660,5,B00094ARGY,"Funny, sad, scarey, perfectly wonderful! Ellen Muth is fabulous as the teen who dies but stays around as a Grim Reaper. Patinkin and the rest of the cast are all excellent. Best series I have seen in a long time.",1383782400,,212,4.325
2263661,5,B00094ARGY,"A nice series that in a light hearted way deals with the subject of death. Death is a mystery that we will all deal with and this puts a light hearted slant on how it could work, not really. But it is very entertaining.",1383609600,,219,4.0
2263662,5,B00094ARGY,"i really don't know why they ended this series so soon. only 2 seasons seems abrupt. i really enjoyed Dead Like Me.it wasn't like all the other shows you watch. was unique, dark but not like horror, and the sense of humor and sarcasm kept me hooked. i love Georgia's attitude. reminded me of Edward Norton from Fight Club. alot of ppl didn't laugh during that movie when it was obvious to other that it was supposed to be humorous. i just loved this series.",1383091200,,457,4.3882352941176475
2263663,5,B00094ARGY,I've watch the series three times and it never gets old. I was delighted to find it on Amazon Prime since was no longer on Netflix. Both seasons are great but movie doesn't do much for me. Not the same without Mandy Patakin.,1382832000,,224,4.232558139534884

the movie. More on that later.",1379116800,,246,4.25531914893617

2263675,4,B00094ARGY,"In this, one of the most inventive and captivating series TV has ever generated, we learn of GRIM REAPERS who rescue the soon-to-be-departed from horrendous pain by taking their souls just before the death itself.  Dialogue is witty and urbane, and a bit scatological,  All walks of life, all types of ""victims"" form the weekly catalog of the dying.  Recurring series' ""reapers"" are led by the magical MANDY PATINKIN.  ELLEN MUTH creates ""the kid,"" newly dead at only 18.  Be careful when you watch this; traditional ideas about the afterlife are challenged.  If you don't like to question authority, STAY AWAY from ""DEAD LIKE ME.:""  if you LIVE to challenge authority, jump on in; the water's fine.",1377907200,,699,4.923076923076923

2263678,5,B00094ARGY,"I was immediately engaged with the writers' quest to explore our
fears of the unknown after death.  They provoked all emotional
levels- fear, happiness, love, anxiety. Ellen Muth makes Geroge
very believable from the opening line through out the entire movie.
The supporting cast equally talented.  I can understand why the
show didn't survive in America.",1377302400,,355,5.321428571428571

2263696,3,B00094ARGY,"This is a cute show and I really like Ellen Muth and Mandy Patinkin in it.  There was a lot of potential in their take on the setup and many interesting things happened, but ultimately the show doesn't stand up.  It didn't run long enough to satisfactorily explore the world it created, and this was possibly caused by the makers failing to present and follow through with character development, instead jumping haphazardly from contrived event to contrived event while some of the more interesting storylines were allowed to fade away.  Like many shows on premium cable, it also suffered simply for having been a premium cable show, throwing in adult themes and dialogue simply because it could rather than because they contributed significantly to the story.  I recommend giving the show a watch through if you are on Amazon Prime, but I wouldn't bother owning a copy.",1375401600,,870,4.8979591836734695

2263698,3,B00094ARGY,Season two was a good compliment to Season 1 but got a little too dark and complex. Subplots were getting away from main theme...it wasn't terrible because this Series' writing team is great and should've had season three to settle complex issues by the characters for example Mason's heavy drinking and depression. I would rate season 1 four stars.,1374883200,,349,4.932203389830509

2263745,5,B00094ARGY,"I wish the show could have run another season or more to wrap up some of the ongoing story lines.  It was very well done and a good mix of dark humor and more serious moments thrown in as well.

If you like the show I do *not* recommend the movie, though.  They tried to finish up some of those loose ends I mentioned above and it was too much for one movie (and the new Daisy looked nothing like the original, nor did her mannerisms match).",1368489600,,441,4.045977011494253

My family enjoyed watching the season but missed the quirky story lines from season 1.  It seems like season 2 spends a little too much time on George's family breaking up.

2263788,5,B00094ARGY,"Very entertaining. George grows quite a bit, and continues to have insights on life. I love her interactions with Delores Herbig.

A lot of rules get broken this season, with consequences both good and bad. The Reapers are people too, and it's hard for them to stay on the fringes of life. They are still attached, still want family and love, still want some normalcy.",1363219200,,368,4.661538461538462
2263789,5,B00094ARGY,Absolutely love this show- wish it had more than two seasons!  It is interesting to see the characters grow and learn and evolve... even though they are undead.  They face the same challenges living people do and it comical in how many of those are dealt with.,1363219200,,260,4.51063829787234
2263790,5,B00094ARGY,"Season 2 was even better than Season 1, I think.  On an episode-by-episode basis, I sometimes found myself wanting to spend more time on Rube.  The good news is that there is some character development for him in the season.  There's also development for Mason, George, and even George and Delores' friendship.  The season was enjoyable and we just flew through it, even choosing to watch it over some brand new shows waiting on our DVR.
Of course the biggest problem is that there was no third season.  There is a 1-1.5 hour... thing.  You'll find it, no doubt, and see that the reviews aren't as good as Season 1 and Season 2.  You should probably just watch it, but be warned it's probably not the wrap-up you're hoping for.",1363219200,,727,4.546153846153846

2263792,4,B00094ARGY,"This is an interesting cable series that never quite found an audience. The acting is good, with Mandy Patinkin being a real.standout. Though many of the accidental deaths portrayed have a chuckle and smile to them, overall the shows seem to be dipped in sadness. I feel that it's appropriate for the show to be melancholy, given that the characters work as soul reapers for people dying either accidentally or violently. However, the viewer should keep this in mind when deciding to watch, not everyday is a good day to watch a show suffering from the blues.",1363219200,,559,4.77319587628866

The third time, disk two still does not play.  Decided to keep it anyway as it seems to be a mfg. defect.  Changed rating from a 5 to a 4 because of this.",1359504000,,452,3.858695652173913

The vendor contacted me and while did the great thing of refunding my money also talked to me in a demeaning tone via email blaming it on ""A disgruntled postal worker"" (I work for the postal service)and then basically pushing for me to change my rating and review only after walking me through how to do it as if I was a child who didn't know how too, so here I am. The DVD's that did work were in good condition, they were an old Hollywood video set as seen by the ex rental barcode sticker. The customer service was less than satisfactory but since he (I assume) attempted to make it right, I would buy from these people but I can't guarantee you will be 100% satisfactory.

I'm not sure I can fault the acting, although my opinion is it was mediocre at best.  There were a lot of failures in this series, starting with the writers who couldn't define the direction.  It had it's good points, but simply not enough to hold your interest, I usually fell asleep soon after I started the stream.  The show lacked continuity ( rules changed too many times ).  Too many flashbacks, would have been better to develop the story at a logical start point, I mean seriously we can imagine a story that starts today and goes back thousands of years, but that is an overused and weary tool.  You seriously have to ask yourself who's managing the production?  This series turned into another tired out soap opera for women, that's really getting old.....",1344729600,,873,4.62987012987013

2263853,5,B00094ARGY,"I like this show, but some of the episode descriptions are wrong. Probably not a big deal to most people (and I'm sure it's not Amazon's fault), but I like to read the description before I watch the episode, and if it's completely wrong, then what's the point?

For example ""...but Mason is about to change his mind when he learns that his reap is a little girl"" is completely wrong. He isn't about to change his mind, and his ""reap"" was not a little girl. This isn't the first time the description hasn't matched the episode. There were several in the first season too, but I just thought maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention. Turns out, I WAS paying attention, and the description, indeed, was wrong.

Anyway, I'm going to watch the rest of the season, and then the movie...then I'll have to find something else to watch. I hate when good shows don't last.",1340150400,4,866,4.509554140127388

2263881,5,B00094ARGY,"I watched the first season and loved it so much - had to buy the second season - plan to get my grandson to watch it.  GREAT little show - not gruesome at all - cute show that gets the message across to young and old alike that there's no time like right now to enjoy: your loved ones/friends/favorite things/trying new things/being proud of yourself and your skills or work/all the good things in life.  Makes it clear that parents only want to ""talk"" with you because they love you and they might be able to help if you have a problem.  That they are NOT ""the enemy"" as many youngsters think.  And also that younger siblings can actually be a comfort to you now and in the future - and that they usually really NEED your attention - a little goes a long way.

Story line is 18 year old girl gets hit by a space-station toilet seat and becomes a member of a team of people who've died but are not allowed to ""go on"" until they've helped an unspecified number of other people who've just died ""due to an unexpected accident"" (this is their teams' ""division"") to ""pass on"" to the next step in existence.  In the process, this young girl (who never appreciated anything in life while alive) learns to cherish everything mentioned above.  Her coworkers each have something to learn from this process as well, and pass on when they've learned it.  Great show that keeps everyone interested and also teaches great life lessons.

It's a shame they canceled this series. I enjoyed it while it was on television. The DVD's contain more ""salty"" language; lots of F-bombs and so forth so it may not be suitable for younger kids. Then again, the subject matter probably isn't suitable for kids under the age of 12 or so anyway.",1301443200,,360,4.640625
2263883,5,B00094ARGY,"I can't believe the show was cancelled.
Unreal.
Thanks to my Amazon bud Ron Sullivan I watched season 1 and fell in love with this series immediately.
So how does season 2 stack up?

A lot of shows simply lose it during the second season but I'm happy ""Dead Like Me"" avoids all the usual pitfalls.
The acting, directing, story telling are all still there and just as perfect as the first year.

Anything bad you ask?
I really didn't care for the whole Ray side story.
That whole thing could have been resolved in one episode instead of dragging it out for three.
That minor gripe aside.
.....there were just SO many unanswered questions.
What happens with Rube who seems to be on the verge of jumping ship?
What happens to Mason and Daisy?
What about George and her family?
There were so many questions raised that we'll never get answers to now.
Season 3 would have been incredible.
I'm keeping my fingers crossed the brain behind this show brings it back with the original cast.
There were simply way too many great things about this show to just let it rest the way they did.

Brilliant.
Funny.
Sad.

2263884,5,B00094ARGY,This was a great show and another example of a network pulling an extemely original and funny show instead of doing the approrpiate advertising they needed or have the patience to gain an audience. It is worth watching the first two seasons (no cliffhanger to be ticked off about no third season being made). The writing was a little weaker in the last few episodes but had a lot more that they could have done had they continued the show.,1296086400,,439,4.5
2263885,5,B00094ARGY,"I like many others began watching this series long after it was cancelled.  The show was not cancelled due to a lack of ratings, in fact it was doing very well for Showtime.  Budget problems with MGM and subsequent related issues spelled it's demise.  Few productions capture the audience in the way that Dead Like Me have, inspiring a league of devoted followers and fans, perhaps even cementing Ellen Muth as an icon of the intelligent sarcastic witty attractive grim reaper she played so well.  I highly recommend watching both seasons to completion, if possible in the order they were produced.  The dynamics and interaction between cast members was a treat, albeit one clearly targeting the adult audience due to the adult language and sometimes realistically harsh interactions between the group of reapers that is the subject of the series.  This series is not about death, it is about the facilitators who help people transition from life to death and how they deal with themselves while trying to exist and work in the real world amongst the living.

Dead Like Me had me laughing, crying and even seriously contemplating the direction and goals of my own life at times.  However the witty humor and tainted outlook on life, along with the perfectly fitting voice of narration by Ellen Muth kept things light enough to classify DLM as a comedy drama that never disappointed me by resorting to slapstick simpleton humor just to get a laugh.

Highly recommended.",1291852800,,1468,4.910931174089069
2263886,2,B00094ARGY,"Ellen Muth/George simply became too painful to watch. She acted like not only being a reaper sucked but the actual show and storyline sucked as well. Between George, Herbig and the grandmother I was about to lose my mind. I kept literally falling asleep. I frequently rewound episodes only to realize I hadn't even missed anything because nothing really happened. I would go into a daze, fall asleep but I would still be half aware of what was going on. I found I simply wasn't missing anything at all. I too only got through about half of disc two of the second season. I only paid ten dollars for each season for a total of twenty dollars. I got ten dollars for both seasons at the pawn shop. I took the ten dollars and put it towards the 12 dollars that they wanted for season one of Millenium. I know Millenium was a dark weird and somewhat dumb show but I know I'll be able to watch it. And I am one of those types who usually cannot get rid of a tv show once I have bought it. Usually most of shows have some redeeming qualities that force me to keep them. Now I truely loved the mother of this show, but not at first. At first her complete ""bitch"" factor was simply too far off of the scale. But later she showed more humanity and she is such an attractive woman and she was also doing some great acting. And the father and daughter were both good characters. My favorite reaper was Callum Blue who was sorely underused or his character was not given the breadth it needed.

All in all ""Dead Like Me"" was to me a pretty dreadful show. Sure, they employ a lot of profanity and sexual situations but it only cheapens the show. It does NOT make the show HIP. I did like the music of the show though and I like the opening sequence used for each show. That guy from the police was doing a good job.

Ultimately though the show was going nowhere at all and it was moving at a snail's pace. And Ellen Muth is pretty hard on the eyes. She has nice hair and she is fit but I hate her voice and she is simply not attractive. If Muth had more talent we could easily forgive her looks but her so called acting was simply brutal. I'm so glad I got rid of this show.

Sorry folks, I sincerely wanted to like this show I like dark humor. I own all of Buffy and Angel, four seasons of Supernatural, One season of Dark Shadows, both seasons of Reaper--- which is pretty poor too, and oh so much more horror and so on. I have lots of sci-fi also. I like monsters, sci-fi, zombies, vampires, etc. This show was right up my alley but it was simply too damned stupid for me to bear.",1290211200,3,2569,4.175403225806452
2263887,5,B00094ARGY,"As if a comedy about Death didn't have enough tragedy to it, ""Dead Like Me"" Season Two is saddled with some very sad facts:
1) that it was the last season to air, and
2) that the writing really got so darn good at the end.

If you've missed the first season, it's worth going back and watching, and you might also like to know that sometime later, the cast & crew reunited to make a one-off movie (though sadly this wasn't enough to revive the series).

""Dead Like Me"" centers around a young woman named Georgia (""George"") Lass.  ""George"" died, only to discover that things were about to get worse.  Rather than be carried on into the hereafter, she was chosen to be a ""reaper"":  a not-dead, not-living person who has to be present when people die to help separate their souls from their bodies and guide them into the beyond.  It's a dirty job, but...well, it's just a dirty job.  Not only does it not draw down a salary, it doesn't leave much of a flexible schedule for someone who still has rent to pay, and a lot of George's un-life give us Office Space-style humor at her day job and morbid mirth at her 24-hour 'eternal night' job.  George is part of a crew whose specialty is accidental deaths and her team of Reapers each has their own interesting story to tell.  As each episode pushes things forward, it also looks back at itself, be it by using a theme (one episode revolves around ""coffee""), showing us a bit of backstory, or giving us some insight into a character's personality.  It is well written, it is funny, and sometimes it is hard to take.

Each episode left me eager for the next.  And at the end, I was sorry to see it go.  If you like grim comedies and don't mind some explicit language (the series was made for Showtime), Dead Like Me Season Two is a short-lived treat.",1280707200,,1794,4.367469879518072

2263889,5,B00094ARGY,"This is a really cute series - one of those shows you just never forget it's so different.

In season one Georgia meets with an untimely death, and becomes a reaper. She's in denial about her death, and wants no part of her new job. She's grieveing the loss of her family, as they're also grieving for her - all moving away from each other; not helping or comforting each other - esp. the young daughter, Reggie.

In season 2 everything seems richer, livelier, more evolved. The reapers seem more like a family than just a group of mismatched souls. Georgia seems more settled and adjusted in her new life, while still watching over her family - esp her little sister Reggie. She comes to realize how much Reggie meant to her. The upheaval for the family is more settled in season 2 as well. The parents finally part company. The mother, while still somewhat distant, comes around a bit, and seems to be a better parent to Reggie - who, over time, reluctantly adjusts to her ""new"" improved mother.

Review from season 1:
The series, Dead Like Me, is kind of a dark comedy. The series is about a young woman, 18 year old Georgia, who's met with an untimely death when a toilet seat comes crashing to earth from the space station MIR. It's a funny scene - not just because she's hit by a toilet seat which has burst into flames because it's falling from space, but because in an ironic twist Georgia (George) is at lunch on her first day of work, looks up, and sees the toilet seat heading straight for her! At first she doesn't seem to understand she's dead and is in great denial. George finds herself stuck between life and death, appointed to be a reaper - a job she wants no part of.

As a reaper George is still ""in the flesh"", but no longer appears as George to anyone who knew her before. She ""lives"" a somewhat normal ""life"" in that she has a job working in an office, but also meets with the other reapers every day and is given her assignment - who she has to reap that day and at what time. When the reapers touch the intended person, they die, and go on to ... where ever it is they go when they die! On occasion one of the reapers is late, or misses their appointment - which has various unfortunate consequences. The reapers are always trying to beat the gravelings to the reap. Gravelings are nasty creatures - about the only thing that would really make this series unacceptable for kids who are scared by such things.

George never seems to get over the fact that she's died, and keeps going back to check up on/spy on/reminisce about her family - something reapers are forbidden to do. There are some pretty funny results of her doing this, especially with her mother - who percieves her as some kind of stalker after she runs into George more than once lurking around their house. There are also some pretty sad moments when it comes to her younger sister, Reggie - who also can't seem to get over Geogia's death. After George's death Reggie rebels by stealing toilet seats from neighbors and school, and hanging them from a tree in a ""secret place"". It's funny in a ironic way.

George's mother, played by Cynthia Stevenson, is an uptight, cold character even before George's death, but afterward takes out her grief on her husband and Reggie. Reggie grows up to be a pretty girl, but she's always kind of alienated from her peers.

Minor characters: In her new ""life"", other than being a reaper, George is employed in an office where her boss, Deloris Herbig, is an odd, motherly character. At home Deloris has her own reality show of sorts - which George finds out about when she has to move in with Deloris and finds herself broadcast on the internet! Deloris has an elderly cat, Murray - who's love of Deloris' life.

Main Characters: The ""head reaper"" is played by Manny Pantankin (Rube) - who is ideal in the part. I don't think there's anyone else who could play the part so well - as we later find out in the movie - which was a huge disappointment to my husband and myself. The other reapers are played by Jasmine Guy (Roxy) who is wonderful as a hard-nosed meter maid. Laura Harris (Daisy Adair) who is beautiful and stuck up. She was an actress in her day who just can't give up on the fact that she'll never act again. To Daisy all the afterlife is a stage. Callum Blue (Mason) a British con man, who's always looking for a con, and is too good looking even for himself - in his opinion! And Rebecca Gayheart (Betty) a former dancer who's character is happy and optimistic.

I originally got the 1st season of ""Dead Like Me"" as a present for our oldest daughter, but she never watched them, so my husband and I ""borrowed"" them. Once we started watching we had to see them all! After watching the first 2 seasons my husband and I searched and were thrilled to find the 3rd season, but then were so disappointed when we found the series ended after 3 seasons.

2263908,4,B00094ARGY,"It always hurts when a show that you really enjoy gets cancelled.  However, the blow is definitely softened if the show has a good ending, and ""Dead Like Me,"" for the most part, does.  The season starts off a bit weak, but picks up a few episodes in and becomes about as good as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/first-season/dp/B0001GF2F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">first season</a>.  There are no episodes as utterly fantastic as the pilot, which really made the first season, but there are definitely a few standouts.  The penultimate episode, ""Always"" was especially great.

This season, for me, was all about character development.  There was more attention put on multiple episode storylines that, in some cases, really paid off.  Daisy's journey from gossiping girl to devout Christian to Ray's girlfriend to an emotionally vulnerable woman was tragic and captivating to watch, and in many ways made the season for me.  All of the characters really had something going on, which gave these episodes--even the less entertaining ones--a lot more depth.  Rube goes on a journey to find someone from his past, Roxy becomes a cop, Reggie (who, in many ways, is the star of this season) deals with her parent's divorce and even more death, and Mason becomes even less capable of taking care of himself.  Mason's character arc was especially well done, as there's an absurd balance between the comedic and the tragic in his scenes.  You're not sure whether to laugh or cry at his antics.

On the other hand, there were things I thought could use definite improvement.  I'm not really fond of how they handled George's character this season, because she often felt like a plot device the writers used to introduce and sum up their episodes, which is an odd way to use the series' protagonist.  Every episode starts with George musing about something random from her life and ends with her making a realization about that thing.  That's a bit too formulaic for me, especially after George's wonderful development in the first season.  I also noticed that the use of music in this season was shockingly bad, as cheery little tunes play over the scenes that were intended to be dramatic.  Rube's realization in the post office that his money wasn't sent to his daughter should and could have been chilling, but with happy music playing in the background, what do you think the scene will come off like?  Certainly not as it was intended to.

All in all, the positive definitely outweighs the negative.  This was a show that I truly enjoyed, and I am happy to see that, despite it's cancellation, ""Dead Like Me"" will have life after death.  In just a few months from now, a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/direct-to-DVD-Dead-Like-Me-movie/dp/B001JV5BHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">direct-to-DVD ""Dead Like Me"" movie</a>&nbsp;will come out.

Each character had their times to shine, each was an individual. I miss them.

I loaned this series to a friend, a man in his very early sixties. He had been rather depressed at losses and impending losses of people for whom he cared.

The second season of DLM deepens the characters of the first and adds, in the second half, a confrontation with true evil and a profound sense of menace. DLM losses much of the breezy quirkiness of the first season, and with it matures and grows into a multitude of narrative dimensions.

The last few episodes become very dark indeed, and out of them emerges 'George' very much transformed from the nihilist teen that she was at the beginning of season one. In the end it is she who declares ""I'm not afraid of anything,"" and demonstrates that this, by and large, may well be true.

The potential that Delores Herbig (brown eyes) saw in the surly teen who came to Happy Times to get her very temporary job has finally realized itself; as has whatever else it was that Reuben obviously instantly saw in her. A fitting round-off to the series--leaving one to wonder, of course, what might have been, if it had been allowed to continue.

I had people over for an insane Dead Like Me marathon evening.  We had a blast!  Most of my guests had never seen the series before, but all thoroughly enjoyed it.  I hear there is a movie, going directly to DVD in 2008, to finish out the series since season 2 dead ends (no pun intended) into nothingness.  I can't wait to see what they do, even though they have replaced one or more of the main characters.  I'll have to rent that one first.",1202428800,,753,4.173611111111111
2263957,5,B00094ARGY,"The characters of Death Like Me took a lot of people in their prime and like those characters this show did not die after becoming old and stale but while it was still young and fresh. Its abrupt cancelling took not only fans but cast and crew by surprise as well (as is evident by Jasmine Guy comments in the Dead Like Me Again special feature who was looking forward to playing Roxy for a long time to come).  I guess the only positive thing we can take from the axing is that it parralleled what the show was about, the unexpected waking up and finding that something you love and looked forward to the company of is abruptly no longer with us and we will never see them again and wish we'd learnt a little bit more about them while they were still alive.

The second season of Dead Like Me is funnier than the first, the first season although great had to in order to set the series in motion to deal with a lot of issues with George coming to grips the whole reaper situation and aspects such as finding her place in employment at Happy Time as well. Also her family members had to come to terms with her being gone and the inevitable tension and strains amongst them while doing so.  There's still some of this in season two but with the second season the other reaper characters get to be explored in greater depth, in fact the show became more about the reaper family as a whole, rather than a show about George. This allowed a lot of funny moments such as Mason having to reap a naked old man who wouldn't leave until his funeral. Heavy drama moments as well such as Daisy dating a domestic violence control freak, Rube letting viewers in on the existence of his daughter and much more.  George scenes at Happy Times were a lot funnier with her being promoted to interview clients for employers (who are just hilarious applicants) and giving an office thief his comeuppance. We also get to see the Gravelings in a lot more detail with this second season (and you can see how they and other special effects such as the death ripple were created in the special features).

It is a shame this show was axed, it a very good and unique TV program.  Do yourself a favour and get a copy of this and the first season while they are still reasonably priced.  There is a Dead Like Me movie coming out with Ellen Muth and some of the reaper actors from this series which may give us fans some closure but although we can hope, I've never seen a series resurrected after a few years off air.  I hope I'm wrong though!  I really hope I'm wrong!",1198540800,4,2540,4.3081761006289305
2263958,4,B00094ARGY,"I've always loved this show, and it's too bad it was canceled.. on the other hand maybe it's a good thing; shows have a tendency to get dorky after the first few seasons... Anyway, this season is better than the first. It's got the same great dark humour(if not better than the first season's), less dramatic(the first season was a little too dramatic for my taste, but this one is perfect), and you get to learn more about the character's pasts, as well as meet new characters along the way. George's mom yells a lot less (thankgod) than she did before. Reggie's character has developed more. Mason's just as funny as before, and Rube is a little more laid back. We also get to learn a lot more about Rube's past, which is interesting. Although by the end of this season there are still quite a few questions left forever unanswered, it's complete enough that it doesn't leave you hanging by a thread. The last episode is my favorite one, which takes place on Halloween, and has a great ending(for the episode as well as the series).",1196121600,2,1034,4.53475935828877

The problem here is Showtime did not give this show time to take off, it was advertised very little if any at all.

Meanwhile, the family she left after she died is falling apart.  Her professor father is dating a grad student.  Her mother is selling off all George's possessions.  And her little sister Reggie is in serious mourning.

Sadly, the American six-pack and chicken wings viewing public prefers their TV fare packaged and served in the form of easy-to-digest, low nutrition items. As a result, Dead Like Me lived for only two seasons and was cancelled -- a deserving fate for Jerry Springer and Fear Factor, but these pieces of garbage are served with chips and dip.",1186272000,,540,4.75531914893617
2263993,4,B00094ARGY,"I was kind of hoping for more in the second season. The stories are good, the characters go through changes and the episodes, on an individual basis, are for the most part excellent. But the show seems to go over old ground here. I wanted to know more about the rules of the reapers and how things worked and there wasn't much of a looming threat or anything to move the story as a whole along.

There are great characters in this show and they're wonderfully fleshed out in the second season, unfortunately since this is the last season it makes it all the more frustrating.

This season leaves you wanting more, which is normally a good thing, except when there isn't any more. As long as you don't mind there being an aching void in your psyche where the characters of the show used to be, I certainly recommend this.",1185840000,,820,4.423841059602649

Don't watch this season first, take it from the beginning, it is essential to understand the character development to enjoy the story, for those of you that have, I will just say that George comes to grips with her occupation and matures into responsibility.

The show is very witty and very refreshing. It has a comical perspective that you generally don't see in shows on today. I love its unique aspect of being from the perspective of a grim reaper.

The program offers a rollercoaster of emotions.  In a single episode you can laugh and in a matter of moments your eyes will well up and feel a tear escape and run down a cheek.  This is the true test of an excellent show.

My only complaint with the show is there are some episodes that the amount of obscene language does get rather tiresome, especially the ""F"" word.",1178928000,,533,4.135922330097087

You're left with but taste of what could have been for a fantastic season 3. Rarely to comedies really resonate on very human levels, especially from the perspective of something so outlandish as a grim reaper.

Mandy Patinkin's portrayal of Rube is top notch, a performance to the caliber of his famous Inigo Montoya, and its a shame that Hollywood hasn't found a use for Ellen Muth since. Its edgy, its funny, its sad and you're left wanting more. Only if they'd had a 3rd season, at least to tie up the main plot line with Georgia's guardian angel persona, and give us some more sarcastic banter along the way.

2264075,5,B00094ARGY,"After catching a few episodes on HDNet and Sci-Fi, then voraciously viewing the first season in a week, I bought the second season too. If you can suspend whatever personal beliefs you have and embrace this fantasy, you'll be rewarded with a cleverly written and even more cleverly acted story. Said story involves reapers, Grim Reapers, that are, ironically, often less than grim. It revolves mostly around Georgia, an 18 year old girl who joins the ranks of the reapers after a stray piece of space toiletry obliterates her physical form. The entire show is narrated by our heroine, adding humorous observations that make you stay up until 1:30 A.M. just to finish off all the episodes on the disc. We're presented with death and its aftermath in a way that doesn't judge sinner from saint: Everyone dies somehow. The dark comedic spin that adds flair to this somber topic makes it one of the best shows that, sadly, is now as departed as the reapers themselves. In the second season, the characters became much more ""real"" and ""genuine"". Faults, foibles and imperfections are shown as plainly as the strengths. It's sad to think that just because it was a cable-only show, it was never give the chance that it deserved. NOTE: The show was on Showtime, so expect a liberal amount of profanity.

2264103,5,B00094ARGY,"As non-subscribers of Showtime or any movie channel, we missed 'Dead Like Me' when it was current. But after purchasing a Plasma TV and getting the HD channels on DirecTV, we had the opportunity to see this jewel. I admit it was a bit of an acquired tastes when you just jump into in the middle but very soon my wife and I were addicted to it and watched season one over a weekend and before the next week was finished, we finished watching the last episode of season two, reluctantly turning off our DVD player. Especially because I like things to add up, the logic to hang together I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to suspend enough disbelief to watch, but somehow this entire production managed to move past all of that stuff without damaging the profound philosophy that drives the show. I find it consistent, well balanced between light and heavy topics and altogether fascinating without one negative commentf (except the fact I can't see anymore of them. :(

I don't know all the political ins-and-outs of current television production but I'm pretty much blaming Showtime. This was an absolutely brilliant and immensely crative project, both from its conception through its execution. I've never been quite so 'hooked' on a TV series and I have a past in cable television production and distribution. My guess is that this show just wasn't promoted and probably never should have been done in such a limited venue. Too bad it wasn't on TNT or USA, although it does seem to be a fairly expensive production so maybe it takes a subscription service to afford it. Anyway, it is a crime that it still isn't on.

I don't have the time for long reviews although I sometimes find them very useful and I almost never stop to write one myself but had to this time. This last holiday most of our friends found 'Dead Like Me, Season One' in their stockings (there are a few that you're just not sure will get it), and now I'm back buying 2nd seasons for ALL of those who received season one as they have responded with such enthusiasm.

2264107,5,B00094ARGY,"THE PROLOGUE

------------

To fully appreciate a review I think it's important to know a little about the reviewer. This particular reviewer is about 25, male and likes when his TV-screen shows him something a little more intelligent. I've never really liked the mainstream shows like ""Friends"" and ""Desperate housewives"" even though I (still) watch ""Lost"" and ""Prison break"". My favorite shows are ""Battlestar Galactica"", ""Heroes"", ""Wonderfalls"", ""The L-word"" and off course ""Dead like me"". I should probably also mention that I'm Swedish so my English might not be the best at times.

This review is for both seasons of the show, since what I will write here also holds for the first season (this is actually a copy of my first season review, lazy me).

THE STORYLINE

-------------

""Dead like me"" is centered around a girl named Georgia ""George"" Lass, an eighteen year old with with doubts about the meaning of her life. She can't communicate with her mother, her father has an affair with one of his students and her little sister might as well be invisible, for all she cares. This could be the plot of a another mainstream teenage drama series, but instead George is hit by space debris and dies.

Instead of passing on or anything like that she finds herself having to work for the undead as a grim reaper, taking peoples souls before they die, saving them the unpleasantness of the actual death and helping them ""pass on"". Despite their good deed to society reapers don't get paid ""through proper channels"" and they still have to make a living, either by a day job or petty larceny what ever means they can find. They do get a new appearance though so they won't attract the attention of the people they knew when they were alive.

We get to follow George as she struggle to make a new life for herself, dealing with her new job, her day job, her old family and finding the meaning and purpose in (un)life she never found when she was alive.

THE REVIEW

----------

I could probably say a million things about this show but I will try to focus on the most important aspects.

First of all, it must be said that ""Dead like me"" is foremost a humor series, with a dark and a little twisted humor. But the show also deals with very serious questions like life and death, fate and circumstance, friends and family and the meaning and purpose of life. This mix of comedy and drama would normally scare me of, since shows like that have a habit of being over dramatic. Especially when dealing with these kind of ""life and death"" issues. I'm thinking about shows like Ally Mcbeal which I found quite funny to begin with but that soon tried a little too hard to get it's point across. Dead like me never has this problem, partly because the humor and drama scenes are well separated, and partly because all the deaths in the show are really silly and unlikely. This un-dramatizes it all. It also helps that the makers of the show doesn't try to shove some neatly packed, morally correct answer to all those life and death questions down your throat. In fact they don't try to answer any questions at all, they just seem to ask the questions in a different way. Also, the show never gets religious in any way. It is never assumed that God and Jesus Christ is waiting on the other side. Heaven and hell are mentioned a few times but most of the worlds religions include the concept of a heaven and a hell so that doesn't bother me in any way.

The actors in the show are really great. Normally you see a show with a couple of actors managing to bring their characters to life. In ""Dead like me"" all characters are marvelously interesting. Sometimes it's even a little bit disturbing that so many of them die in the show because you would like to know more about them. But you can rest assure that the you will be able to at least get to know the small group of reapers that George is part of; Betty, Roxy, Mason, Daisy and their leader Rube. The humorous nature of the show off course means that all the characters are quite stereotypical and strange but in many ways they are also very normal. They have personalities just like any normal person and their sometimes strange behavior is completely understandable given the fact that they have been dead for quite some time.

The dialog and setting (is that the right word) of the whole show is also absolutely spot on. There are many conversations that you really remember long after you've seen the show, and most of them are really funny. There is a particular dialog between George and Mason about frogs that I find very amusing, watch out for that one.

If I'm to complain about anything at all about this show it has to be that they sometimes rely a bit too much on computer animations. I really can't see why they couldn't use real props in some of the scenes and some of the animations are a bit sloppy. But this is definitely not of major concern and it definitely not something that is going to make me lower the five star rating of this show.

So if you like a strange and different show  with a lot of humor and brains then you should really see ""Dead like me"", because this is probably the best show I have ever seen so far in my life. Or as George would probably have but it:

""This show is so good it would probably kill me... again""",1168128000,,5297,4.477178423236515
2264138,5,B00094ARGY,I LOVED THE SERIES. THE PLOTS WERE CUTE AND INTERESTING. TOO BAD IT WAS ONLY ON FOR 2 SEASONS. THE ACTORS WERE VERY GOOD AND ALL WORKED WELL TOGETHER.,1168041600,,150,4.206896551724138
2264139,5,B00094ARGY,"Dead like me is probably the best short running series I've seen in a long time. It is unfortunate that Showtime saw fit to end it just when it was becoming known. George's adventures parallel morals in a story that is told with genuine wit and near sarcastic realism which reflects lessons we could all learn from in real life. This could have run several more seasons and I do not doubt could have won several awards if given the chance. There is some swearing, which only adds to the realism however some may want to avoid it if such is offensive to them. I really like this series and still hold hope that someone will revive it.",1167955200,,633,4.372881355932203

2264142,5,B00094ARGY,"When I first saw the ads for Dead Like Me, I wondered what it was about. Then I saw the show in a motel during vacation and didn't really get interested in it. Later, I watched a couple reruns. It became one of most amusing series I've ever watched. Very funny and weird in a neat way.

When I discovered Showtime dropped this show, it helped me remember why I dropped Showtime from my lineup. They'd do well to show less porn and more things with the clever and sweet appeal of Dead Like Me.

Dead Like Me got better with each show, although it started out the first season a little slow, which it why I didn't continue watching until later. The second season was excellent. The characters were great. Too bad it's all over. I am so glad I recorded most of the series. The shows are just as delightful the second or third viewing, but what would you expect from someone who likes rewatching Men in Black I & II, Groundhog Day, Happy Texas, Demolition Man, Star Wars (IV-the first one screened), and Stargate?

Maybe Showtime needs a visit from a grim reaper willing to rip the soul out of its corporate fat butt and shake it real good before slamming it back inside. Maybe Showtime execs would see the light, although it's not likely. Most bigshots think they know what people want for entertainment.

Dead Like Me is a nice little show. Too bad it met up with its own grim reaper.",1167696000,,1382,4.38671875

Did not want a job! But at 18, on her lunch break she is in the spot where a space station blows up and the toilet hits her in the head. Then she is really dead. But to her surprise, she is now a Reaper. They take the souls out of the Dead, so that when they die, there is no pain. Then they go off into the light. But the Reapers don't get to leave town. They just meet every morning at breakfast, n thir own special waffle house, and their Boss, gives them each their little yellow papers with the names of the near deadly departed. But they also want their own lives. So every day they try to get into all different things that they shouldn't be doing, and Rube, their boss, he tries to keep them in line. As a Sci-fi fanatic, I can tell you, it is too bad there are only 2 seasons. But they are both very worth watching. You will love their shenanigans, and some of the horror, but it is definitely a sci-fi comedy.

Go for these 2 seasons. I would love another season. But I believe there are only 2. I have them both. But it would have been nice to have more. By the way, Rube, their boss is Mandy Patankin.(I hope I spelled that right!) He is absolutely perfect in this Daddy role for his reapers. You will love them all.

Fortunately, for fans, the studio found a winner in the DVD market.  Unfortunately, for fans and the studio, there are no more episodes.

The only issue I had was that with the cancellation of the series, I feel like they left me hanging. They did a lot of fore-shadowing throughout this season, especially in the last episode, and then ended everything.

I understand that series must end, but for gods sake at least wrap up the loose ends, and leave the audience feeling complete.

I sure wish it would have survived, and I believe Showtime could and should have renewed it over some of the other fare offered.  I realize it seemed to derive from Six Feet Under, but in fact is a completely different concept.

Certainly, there might only be 2 or 3 shows on network television better than this one.  One more season would have shown whether or not it had real staying power.  But then the producers stated they would be focused primarily on another project, so that may have killed it regardless.

You have to accept the premise (real grim reapers), and as the subject says, I believe it turned too dramatic, less humorous, in the second season.  More comedy would have possibly saved it, as well as maintaining production values and some of the early concepts as were shown early on when money was being spent to enhance quality.

Certainly the story possibilities were endless. I was looking forward to meeting God, or at least Peter, in the 10th season finale.

There is one scene, in one episode, where you make a flying tackle across a crowded office, then scream ""Man Down"" as you take the poor guy out.  That was some awesome television - you deserve an award for that one scene alone.

The true art form is one that never gets old.  These DVDs will never gather dust or suffer from neglect.  And the best part is that they pay for themselves, seeing as there's no reason in the world to waste any more money on Showtime.

2264220,4,B00094ARGY,"George, the eighteen-year-old turned Grim Reaper, is back for another season with her excellent supporting cast.  Having been a Reaper for about a year, George is starting to get into the swing of things but there is still plenty more to learn.

On the job front George, as Millie, is gaining responsibilities she is not sure she wants.  On the home front her old family seems to be falling further apart.  On the Reaper front she learns that she is not alone in her feelings about her life, just a little more vocal about them.  Rube and Roz do some of the most developing in this season although Mason really has his moments.  In other words, through death we find out a lot of wisdom about life.

This season is formatted a little differently than the first season.  Nudity has been added (only in a few episodes and all male) but that is very minor.  The big change is that all too often it seems that George and the other reapers on the team are more responsible for the actual deaths they deal with.  All too often it seems that if they hadn't been there then the victim would have survived.  The other big change is the gravelings.  They are far more visible this season.  We also learn a little more about them and where they come from.

2264226,1,B00094ARGY,"This is why there will be no third season, to put it simply, the second season sucked, or was a major disaster compared to the first one, why?

1-The story line; the story line became repetitive, boring, pointless, depressing and centralized mainly around a character that has lost all the charm and talent she had in the first season -George-

2- The main Character ,George (actress Ellen Muth) somehow lost the spark or the spunk that she had in the first season, not only that, but her acting became more and more annoying to the point were i found myself fast forwarding the parts were she is at, even her voice dragged on and on and on in the background; dull, depressing, even Arrogant at times, repeating mumble that you couldn't stand listening to anymore, and pushing me closer to the point were i wanted to bang my head on the wall and scream ""will you just shut the hill up!!"" trying hard just to zone her voice out.

3- Other Characters played by marvelous and adorable talents (Laura Harris,Callum Blue, Jasmine Guy and Mandy Patinkin)  were minimized or cut short, which took out most or all of the flavour and spice that was left in this season!! even though those characters are the only reason i managed to get through the half of the second season. while certain characters that did not fit in the show at all (Cynthia Stevenson) were given much more attention (maybe in an effort to attract a certain audience) will it did not work.

it is a shame, someone drooped the ball on the second season, and it is no where near what the first one was. my advise don't buy it, you will waist your money and regret it.",1139097600,12,1627,4.483108108108108
2264227,5,B00094ARGY,"This show is way to easy to fall in love with. The show is quirky, filled with swearing and sexual references, but manages to stay heartwarming at the same time. The script is simply amazing, intensely emotional and lough out loud funny at the same time.

I fell in love with Ellen Muth who plays the role of George Lass incredibly well. The chemistry between her, Laura Harris, Callum Blue, Mandy Patinkin and Jasmaine Guy (her fellow reapers) is of great quality and each character is unique and lovable.

Be warned that if you start watching Dead Like Me, it will be impossible to stop. It nearly brings tears to my eyes that Showtime cancelled the series after the 2nd season. The series had that much life left in it (no pun intended). For being hilariously funny, yet poignant and spiritual at the same time, Dead Like Me gets a well earned 5/5.

I sincerely hope it is brought back from the dead and we see season 3 at some point in the future.",1139097600,3,951,4.454022988505747

2264242,5,B00094ARGY,"Yay!! The second (and sadly last) season of DLM finds its way onto DVD.

Again, we see both this life, and the afterlife though central character George.

On the dead side: George is a reaper, collecting souls of people about to die (this prevents them feeling pain and stops them getting left behind in this world). George's team also includes Mason, Daisy, and Roxy and is lead by Rube.

 This season we also explore the other characters in more detail; especially Rube's mortal life, and surprisingly vulnerable Mason, with the effects on him caused by his`job'.

 My favourite character Daisy also gives hints on her living life, especially towards the end of the series. I enjoyed having the `Bimbo Blonde' surface scratched away from this character, revealing someone we could all know.

On the living side: George works for a temp agency, Happy Time, `living' under the guise of `Millie'. Some of the best comedic moments of the series take place in Happy Time. `Millie's manager Delores is just too funny, and all viewers will see a little bit of their own managers in the character.

  George has now adjusted to the fact that her old life is over, and decides to make the most of this one. This will include boyfriends, and mingling with her co workers at Happy Time.

 Also, we once again follow George's surviving family. Her parent's are divorcing, and her younger sister Reggie is entering that frightful period known as puberty. George's grandmother also appears this series.

Well, is there anything negative about this fantastic series that ended far too soon?

 While the final episode `Haunted' is satisfying, and ties up the series nicely, there are still a few loose ends that niggled me. In `Haunted', Crystal (the receptionist at Happy Time) is searching for `Georgia Lass' on the computer. Has she learnt George/Millie's secret? Reggie knows George is still around, but has she also grasped the reaper angle. I'm quite sure she has, but it would have been nice to have this voiced. Finally, flashbacks to Rube's mortal life leave more burning questions, which I won't mention here as I don't want to spoil anything.

2264243,5,B00094ARGY,"Dead Like Me was a terrific series with a quirky plot line and a definitely warped sense of humour. It was the reason I was keeping Showtime. Ellen Muth's performance as slacker George is terrific, as are the performances of the rest of the cast, especially Jasmine Guy as the take no prisoners Roxie. Some of the episodes are hilarious and some downright heartbreaking, especially the Halloween episode where the reapers are taking the souls of a serial killer. Mason's encounter with the little boy too sick to go trick or treating just tugs a your heart strings. This was a show that should not have been replaced by Kirstie Alley's unwatchable multi-episode commercial for Jennie Craig!!!",1129680000,7,692,4.923076923076923

2264245,5,B00094ARGY,"I must admit, I'm a little slow to watch TV series DVD's, so I haven't actually viewed all of the discs.  I'm about 2/3rd's of the way through at this point.

Like season 1, this season continues the same humor and wit that made the first season so good.  I especially enjoy seeing all of the unique ways the writers came up with to kill off the general population, though so far nothing really tops the bank robbing scene from season 1.  In addition, the philisophical narrative about death continues to be interesting and thought provoking.  This season does begin to discuss people's views on religion a bit more, but at the same time it's well balanced - without any emphasis on how one religion may be better than any other.

My one complaint is that the writers seem to have goofed in a few spots where George seems to forget her identity toward those that are living is supposed to be Millie.  So in some scenes, she's called Millie and in others she's called George.  There's no consistancy to this, so the possibility is that two people could meet with George/Millie at the same time and not understand why each person knows her under a different identity.

Other than this one oversight, the series really is excellent.  I only wish there were a season 3 I could look forward to.",1128124800,2,1289,4.541125541125541

2264247,5,B00094ARGY,"I stumbled across Season One of 'Dead Like Me' at my local video store last year, rented the first disk, and I was hooked. Great concept, high production values, quirky plot line, and fine acting. Worth the price of admission just to watch Mandy Patinkin

The second season builds on the first and has the wisdom to allow the characters to grow without out-growing the original concept.

The DVD set packaging is attractive, the DVD menus are convenient, the content is engaging, and the 'added features' are actually entertaining.

I missed the run of this show on Showtime, and I'm very pleased to have the chance to whatch it now at my own pace with this box set. Buy both seasons. Share them with your friends. Stop off and get a waffle on your way to work tomorrow morning.",1127088000,4,778,4.58273381294964

It does not insult your intelligence, nor does it give gratuitous offensive language or concept.  A good watch!!",1126915200,,261,5.166666666666667
2264270,5,B00094ARGY,"If any of the other reviews didn't quite get this across; yes, the show is amazing. The second season is even better than the first. But if you're thinking about buying this, you've at least seen a few epsisodes, and come to your own conclusions about these opinions. What you're really asking yourself is ""Is it worth putting out the money to own the DVDs?""

The short answer is, of course, ""Yes.""

But what you don't know is why. That's why I've written this review. So here's the breakdown, graded and all.

The show itself: A+

Obviously the most important part. This season is absolutely essential to own if you're a fan of the show at all. If you happened to miss even one episode, then trust me, you missed a lot. There isn't an episode in this season that doesn't make you laugh out loud, and at the same time, move you in a way nothing else on television could. Every cast member, down to the guests, such as ""Will and Grace""'s Eric McCormack, give an absolutely stellar performance to give the show a reality that ""reality television"" couldn't hope to match. Again, you probably know this, but to emphasize; the show is perfect.

Special Features:

This goes into four categories.

""Dead Like Me... Again"" Featurette: A

To add to your enjoyment of the show itself, it is absolutely wonderful to see the cast and crew discuss just how much they enjoyed working on it, and give insight to the characters, and to even get to know the actors/actresses themselves a bit, and how they relate to the characters. Callum Blue even discusses his decisions for Mason's character in the show, how he thought the character should grow, or as he put it, not grow at all. This special feature will make you appreciate the show even more.

""Putting Life into Death"" Featurette: B

This special feature (broken into sections describing each visual effect, such as the signature 'soul popping' effect) is fun to watch to understand a bit about the technical aspect of the show. However, each section is rather short, barely scratching the surface of these effects, and will leave you saying, ""Well, yes, you did that.. but HOW?"" Granted, the makers of the show aren't going to just give it all away, so I'm not taking off a lot of points here, but it would have been nice to see just a little more of what went on to truly appreciate the work that went into it. But it is fun to watch, particularly the ""Bouncing Glass"" story, which is pretty funny, and makes you feel like you were there, to have an inside view of that little goof.

Deleted Scenes: A-

This is perhaps one of the greatest ideas presently on DVD. And this set is no exception. But sometimes you have to wonder if some of them made it in there just to write ""Over 10 minutes of deleted scenes"" on the cover. Again, they're fun, there's some charming moments that it's nice to see to feel like you got to know a character a little better, but there's a few that don't seem to fit, specifically ""The Real Story"", which is very short, and doesn't seem important to the story at all. For the most part, however, it's a very nice feature to have included.

Photo Gallery: A

Breezing through this feature will catch your eye with moments in the season where you can say, ""I remember that"", and most likely have an unrelenting urge to watch that episode, while taking time on each one will really capture you in some extremely touching moments that will make you want to take a screencap on your computer to save it, or allow you to see things you didn't notice in the episode, such as ""My name is Mr. Rube"" on the board at school. Definitely worth a look. Or many.

Packaging/Aesthetics: A-

The DVDs themselves are in four slim cases, each containing four episodes, with the exception of the last, which contains three episodes and the special features. Each case has the relevant episode summaries, which may be trying to be a bit too summarizing, sometimes leaving out an entire character's journey within that episode that may be your defining storyline to look for. Obviously, they can't say every part of every story, but perhaps could do a bit better than one sentence per episode. The front and inside of each case has a picture of a different character, the front also containing a quote from the show of that character. And herein lies my real problem with the packaging. I'll just use the best example for purposes of brevity. With all of the interesting, clever, and wonderfully insightful lines Mandy Patinkin's character, Rube, has, the quote at the bottom of Disc 3 (the 'Rube' disc), the quote reads, ""Anything interesting in the obits"" -Rube. Every character has far more interesting lines than the ones provided on the discs, and it's a shame to see this good idea go to waste. Season 1 at least had Rube's ""No pearly gates for you."" line, while it wasn't his best, it was far better than Season 2's picks. Obviously this isn't a crucial part of the packaging, so I didn't take off to much for it, but it was a bit aggravating, so it couldn't be totally let go.

Overall: A

You need to own this. No question. Watch and enjoy.",1126742400,5,5099,4.554098360655738
2264271,5,B00094ARGY,"I was very excited to get the 2nd season of DLM, but VERY upset to hear Showtime had cancelled it. I enjoyed every bit, it's a great show with a lot of potential. They were just starting to get into all the different characters and it could have continued at least another 2 seasons!

I never watched Six Feet Under, or any similar show, since I don't get those channels, but a friend reccommended this one to me & I love it. I reccommend it to anyone who has a somewhat ""quirky"" or ""twisted"" sense of humor. The only downside is there was a lot of cursing, some of which I felt was unnecessary.

Showtime was stupid to let this get away!",1126742400,,638,4.221311475409836
2264272,5,B00094ARGY,"While this show may be too morbid for some, i find its witt refreshing, something not often seen on tv. It is unfortunate that a) it was cancelled and b) it was only shown on pay-tv in Australia as I think it would have done well on the networks as Australians tend to have a darker sense of humour than most. Anyway this show is outrageous, hilarious and un-missable. Undoubtabley one of the best characters is Delorus Hergigg (as in her big brown eyes) at Happy Time. This second season is a great follow up and definately a must have for all!",1126483200,,545,4.352941176470588
2264273,5,B00094ARGY,"I bought the first season because the story sounded intersting.  I admit it was an okay show, but it wasn't something I really wanted to watch.  I decided to buy the second season anyway, and I'm really glad I did because I really really enjoyed it.  The characters go thru some interesting changes.  Reggie became a little more than just a disturbed child, and they brought some interesting mythology to the show.  I'm really disappointed that the show was cancelled.  I have to say that the Putting Life into Death features aren't all that exciting, but I enjoyed the Dead Like Me Again.  I wish they offered some insight on this set as to why it was cancelled.

My only beef with the set is that the font of the series title doesn't match the first season.  This doesn't look as nice when displayed by the spines, but I like the artwork better, so I guess it evens itself out.",1126310400,,879,4.44375

You are taken along an odyssey with the alive, yet very dead, reaper Georgia Lass as she ponders her life when she was alive, while learning to live her 'new' life as a young reaper.  This show is intellectual and touching.  Every episode is related to some sort of lesson that Georgia missed while she was alive, and it is a lesson for the audience as well.  Not a morbid look at death, but a brilliant way to look at life.  Truly a show worth watching, and truly a treasure.",1126310400,,616,4.213675213675214

2264298,5,B00094ARGY,"There are few television series' that can continually hold peoples interests for very long. But those that can are so spectacular that they burn brightest before being snuffed out. Such is the case with Showtime's DEAD LIKE ME.

After two short but extremely sweet seasons, DLM was given the axe for unknown reasons.

This second season is just as fantastic as the first, giving us more laughs, more thought-provoking character analysis, and more gut-wrenching and tear-jerking episodes.

If you're not familiar with the premise of the series, it goes something like this:

Eighteen-year-old Georgia (""George"") Lass, on her first day of work, is killed by a toilet seat that blasts into Earth's atmosphere from the disintegrating Mir space station. After the explosion, she's recruited into reaperhood by Mandy Patinkin (Rube). And with Rube comes a clutch of other reapers, all with attitudes, personal baggage, and problems of their own. Most notable among them is Mason (played perfectly by Callum Blue), an alcoholic, drug-using reaper who knows no boundaries. In one hilarious but ultimately sad episode during this season, Mason has to reap the father of a young girl during the girl's birthday party. And Mason has to dress up as a clown to get into the party. But Mason is anything but a clown and, in fact, hates them. So when he's asked to make balloon animals for the children, he produces some very phallic looking items, much to the chagrin of the parents at the party. And then, after he successfully reaps the girl's father, he heads outside to rip off his clown nose and start drinking heavily from a whiskey bottle.

We also get to see Georgia lose her virginity and grow up a bit (even though she's still dead). And we get to witness how Gravelings are made (the beastie little creatures that cause all the bad accidents).

But those revelations pale in comparison to what happens to Rube. In one of the most heartbreaking episodes, Rube discovers that his one and only daughter is still alive, and is about to die. If you watch this and it doesn't choke you up, I fear that you're dead!

It is sad to think that there will be no further exploration of these amazing characters' lives. I will certainly miss not learning what happens to George as she grows psychologically and emotionally. I will miss not knowing if Reggie, George's younger sister, blossoms into a normal young lady. I'll miss all of these wonderful people.",1126051200,2,2443,4.858173076923077
2264299,5,B00094ARGY,"The 2nd season of Dead Like Me is excellent...just like the first season.

It was well worth buying.  Now all my friends want to borrow my set so they can see how great the show is as they do not have showtime.  I am having a hard time letting them borrow them as I don't want to have to wait to get them back.  My husband bought me the first season for my birthday and I haven't let anyone borrow it either.  The show is so funny and strange at the same time. The idea of reapers living and working along with everyone else is so cool.  We like to try to figure out who the person is that they have to reap and how they are going to die.  What the people say when they realize they are dead can be so funny. I love the waffle house where the reapers meet every morning to get their post it with the name and time of death.  I wonder if the waitress knows who and what they are as she always comes up when they are talking.  Great show a must see and Buy.  Thanks amazon for having it available.

2264318,5,B00094ARGY,"Dead Like Me is one of the best shows ever and its second season is even better than the first one. For those who still don't know the show, it is about Georgia Lass, an eighteen year old girl who suddenly dies when a toilet seat coming from the Mir space station crashes on her. Then she is recruited as a Grim Reaper.
The first season was about the death of a beloved and how people try to deal with it, while the second season is different: Georgia has been dead for a year, and her family has slowly learnt to deal with her disappearance. The storyline seems to be about characters finding who they really are rather than how they  cope with death. Most of the characters see their lives change:
Daisy's soul searching, Reggie grows up, Joy moves on while George tries to keep an eye on her family, but quite remotely...
This season is amazing: the show is shrewdly written and some of the story lines are really moving - for example, the episode ""Send in the Clown"", in which Mason has to reap a little girl's father on her birthday, or all the episodes showing Joy trying to move on with her life while facing her divorce. The actors are all brilliant, because they try to be as subtle as possible, to convey emotions without overdoing it (but this is no sitcom after all).
In this show, death is not really treated as a big deal, there is always a detail that will make you laugh (as George's nickname: ""Toilet seat-girl""). To me, this show is as good as TV can get, and even if it was cut down in its prime - as Georgia's character was, it will soon become a classic.
As a French girl, I think that the DVD could at least have been subtitled in English, because even if I understand English quite well, I missed some of the lines and it did bother me (a lot)!! MGM is lucky the show is excellent, because as far as the DVD goes, it is not good, and its promotional extra features are dull.",1125014400,2,1897,4.269444444444445

I don't know WHO runs Showtime, but it isn't my Showtime. Save it to say, buy the two seasons,keep the packaging, and in the years to come this program will become a collectors item. The show is thought provactive, sensitive, and makes us all realize just how important living a full life is.

2264322,5,B00094ARGY,"Just when I found this show they cancelled it!  It is too bad, this was one of the funniest shows (in a dark way) that I had seen in a long time.

2264323,4,B00094ARGY,"Talk about your offbeat tv shows.  This one takes the cake.  Just when you thought there were no brain cells left in Hollywood, someone came up with this madcap idea.  I give this one a big A+ for originality.  I'm sorry it didn't last longer.  I discovered it after the second season was already half over.  Luckily I had the chance to see all of the episodes on one of the Showtime on demand channels.  I'm glad I caught it.  The afterlife sure is rough for the dead, in this tv show at least.  What's the fun of being dead if you still have to work for a living while you're reaping other souls?  Seems like the reapers just can't get a brake.  This show's cancellation just proves that most folks in Hollywood haven't got a clue!

For those who don't know, the premise is about people who die and come back as reapers.  Reapers remove souls from the body just before they die and then they send the souls off to their final destination whereever that may be.

It does contain foul language and sexual situations but no actual nudity for the most part.  Not suitable for those under thirteen.",1124409600,,1095,4.378109452736318
2264324,5,B00094ARGY,"There is nothing about this show that is not entertaining.  I managed to watch this entire season on TV, instead of only the first episode.  I still picked up the DVD set, mind you, but I knew what I was buying into.

The first season was all about acceptance.  George (Ellen Muth) died from the devastating impact of a falling toilet seat from the space station Mir.  In fact, early in the first season Rebecca Gayheart's character affectionately nicknames her ""Toilet Seat"".  She is then informed that she must spend the rest of her days reaping souls until her ""time"" comes to move to the next level.  A reaper is to take a certain, if not exactly vocalized, number of souls before this time.  They only know it's their last when it happens.  George is set to reaping almost immediately, and boy is she having problems with it!  From refusing to take a soul and leaving it trapped in the dead body, to involving herself with the doomed individual thus changing the course of events and leading to a roomfull of ab-shocker dead folk, George pushes the limits of both her job and her co-reaper's patience.

Season 2 has a completely different focus.  George is quite accepting of her job, and while she may have lasting issues from dying at such a young age, or never having done certain things during her life...she embraces her job openly, almost warmly at times.  Season 2 is all about change within the system.  This is both reflected in her day job at Happy Time, where she flirts with and kisses the entirely-too-dumb-for-words new employee thus leading to a promotion, and where she attends a camping outing, forcing her to deal with her ""alley cat""ness and embrace her coworkers a bit more.  Delores Herbig (Christine Willes) has some quite juicy quotes, one specifically dealing with the frustration of the unresponsiveness of an online dating service.  Delores is by far one of the most entertaining characters and if Dead Like Me never airs a new episode again, at least I have these episodes to keep me happy.  She is truly a gem.

Another thing that happens within this season is love.  Or, well...affection.  Whether it be between literally Gone With The Wind Daisy Adair (Laura Harris) and loser Mason (Callum Blue), or  between George herself and a country club boy, the kisses are flying.  The beauty of the relationships in this season are that they seem completely unconventional yet entirely natural.  Daisy and Mason play theirs off so wonderfully, even when newcomer Ray (Eric McCormack, from Will and Grace) steps in and leads Daisy by the bullhorns.  Which, I must say, after Will and Grace, Eric does an amazing job at being a womanizing (...).  Mason deals well though.  I won't spoil the ending there, though.

Rube (Mandy Patinkin) frustrates and annoys me more and more.  He never seems to care about his reapers' feelings until the wrong time.  At that time, it makes so little sense that the reapers really don't know what to do with it.  At one point, Rube buys George a warm oatmeal cookie, and she says something along the lines of ""Whenever you buy me food, it's because something bad is coming"".  That's how they view him, and that's what annoys me about Rube.  He has a great story this season, as he struggles with his humanity after trying to find his daughter.  His...really really old daughter.

Roxy (Jasmine Guy) doesn't really do much this season beyond change jobs from the thankless, violence-less job of a Meter Maid to the fulfilling life of an officer of the law.  In the line of duty, she kills a girl who Mason is meant to reap.  This really makes me wonder just how much fate plans for.  Roxy was fated to shoot the woman Mason was fated to reap.  If Roxy hadn't been a cop, that woman might not have died.  Actually, this question has come up a few times.  For instance, in an episode in which George must choose one of three applicants for a temp job at a chemical company.  She frets and frets and frets, and the next day the gentleman asking for the temp goes on a shooting spree, killing 13 people.  Including himself, and the applicant George chose.

George's family, mainly Joy (Cynthia Stevenson) and Reggie (Britt McKillip) are amazing.  Their story is so simple, so down to earth, but ultimately so entertaining.  Joy is a woman who continues to lose everything she loves.  Her daughter gets blasted by a toilet seat, her other daughter seems to be losing her mind, and then her husband cheats on her with a student.  The following divorce and attempted move really make Joy's life wonderful.  The appearance of Joy's mother, a free-spirited drifter brings a little happiness to Reggie's life, and a lot of painful memories to Joy's.  Their story is so human.  It's nice that we get a chance to see what the after-effects of a departing soul are.  Despite the fact that Reggie believes George is still alive.  (For good reason!)

Overall my favorite character would have to be Daisy.  From stealing the cross, to confessing to a priest after stabbing a hole in her hand, to her relationship with Ray, she shows remarkable grace and growth.  Laura Harris is a wonderful actress and portrays the insecurities and strengths of Daisy wonderfully.

Overall, this show is just one of the best things I have ever seen.  If it had lasted at least two more seasons, it probably would have dethroned Buffy the Vampire Slayer as my favorite television show.  Unfortunately, it doesn't look as if that will happen.

If you are a lover of intelligent, gripping, and reality-suspending entertaining television, pick up Season 1.  Then pick this up, because you can never get enough Dead Like Me.",1124150400,7,5644,4.710633946830266
2264325,4,B00094ARGY,"So you like dark comedy and are considering delving into ""Dead Like Me"", right?  Good choice.  Especially if you don't mind laughing around the topic of death, which actually is a great way to deal with it.  In a nutshell, whereas the first season was about how George was getting used to being a reaper, the second season explores the other characters as well as some interesting and unique deaths.  Some of them are downright hysterical and some are incredibly touching.  This season is wonderful.

If I had one complaint it would be the excessive use of the ""f"" word.  Don't get me wrong, I swear like a sailor myself, but the ""f"" word is so overused in this season as a noun, verb and adjective in every sentence it gets annoying after awhile and is a bit distracting.  It's almost as if the writers were thrilled that they could actually swear on TV and just went a little overboard.

Otherwise, a must-see",1124064000,2,911,4.539877300613497
2264326,5,B00094ARGY,"Season two of, in my opinion, the finest series ever put on TV, lives up to the first and possibly surpasses it.

As in the first season, this dry, witty dark comedy avoids all the lifeless (no pun intended) cliches of the typical brainless sitcom that so many people enjoy on network TV.  It always entertains, always has a sublime message that is never done obtusely, and evokes a span of emotions from sadness to happiness that is done so delicately it never seems manipulative.  Just a great show.

Season two varies from the first in a few ways, at least as I see it.  The humor is a little less dry, the dialogue is less vulgar (thankfully), and some of the characters have changed somewhat.  Georgia becomes much more confident and much less the whiney, insecure, depressed girl from the first season.  Not sure if this is good or bad, because season one Georgia was terrific.  Daisy Adair is vastly improved; the overdone references to sex are lessened, and she becomes a sweet, sensitive, vulnerable, caring woman that is just as lost as the living, and trying to find herself.  She is much more believable than the first season's, and much more likeable as well.  Rube is still Rube, but is more humanized by his storyline with his daughter.  This storyline is done in an interesting and mysterious way, with clues given along the way until it finally resolves itself.

Despite the name, and ostensibly being a harsh show, this is a really sweet show.  This is particularly so for the second season.  The final scene of the final episode, with Georgia smiling at her adoring former sister is in some ways a microcosm of the show - incredibly sweet, sad, delicate, poignant and beautifully mysterious and reassuring (to borrow a phrase from the first season).

This is the easiest recommendation I could make for anything Amazon sells.  If you are thinking about it, get this DVD.  You would have to be brain, ummmm, dead, not to like it.",1123200000,12,1947,4.679411764705883
2264327,5,B00094ARGY,"This truly original series is one of the best ever created. Great writing and acting make this a must-own DVD.  The series maintains its brillaince up through the (possibly) series finale episode, 'Haunted'. The series follows Georgia, who last season was killed in a freak accident, and then selected to live among us as a grim reaper. We also continue to see the story of the family she left behind. The performance between Cynthia Stevenson (Joy Lass) and Britt McKillip (Reggi Lass) as Georgia's grieving mother and sister adds a touching and real element to the show. The series never lost its trademark quirkiness; it is truly a masterpiece.",1122681600,8,647,4.935779816513762
2264348,5,B00094ARGY,"""Dead Like Me"" managed that rare feat in TV; it was both funny and intelligent without pandering to the lowest common demoninator. In the second and final season George must grapple with a number of issues including becoming infatuated with someone from the world of the living--even worse he's about as clueless as they come. Mason continues to be a sober reaper for a little while at least until he sees the impact he has when he takes the soul of a father at his little girl's 6th birthday party. Even worse, Mason is forced to be the clown for the girl's party. It's no surprise that when he makes animal balloons they all look like genitals.

As if the life of the dead couldn't get any worse, the group must take the souls of a serial killer in the season finale and final episode of the series. There's a pretty good featurette on how the optical effects are created for the series including those nasty Gravelings, a photo gallery and 10 minutes of deleted scenes. Unfortunately, MGM doesn't incorporate the deleted scenes on the DVD so they are at the end of their respective episodes which makes viewing these are a bit surreal. The featurette on the second season features brief interviews with most of the cast and executive producer Steve Beeers.

The drawbacks to the set are few. There's no commentary tracks on this set which is a pity. Even after the departure of creator/writer/co-producer Bryan Fuller the second season of the series continued to break new ground and the writing continued to be top notch.

MGM seems to be regressive when it comes to DVDs; these sets don't have a chapter break after the opening credits which is a bit odd. Also, the concept of the ""play all"" feature that has become the standard for most TV series on DVD somehow continues to elude them. Other than that, the picture quality is exceptionally good with little video noise and a sharp anamorphic widescreen transfer. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround is utilized extremely well unlike a lot of TV shows that are put on DVD so those are factors in favor of this transfer.

Sadly, also missing this time out is the clever packaging that housed the first season with it's transparent casing that surrounded the box that holds the slimline DVD cases.

Another great TV show departs leaving a hole that Showtime can't fill at the moment. Supposedly (this is according to TVonDVD.com)the show was cancelled because it was expensive to produce but only had a cult following and Showtime wanted to use their limited resources for original programming for a big blockbuster type hit like ""Deadwood"" or ""The Sopranos"". Maybe they should have dropped the increasing weak ""The L Word"" or one of their insipid original series. I'll mourn the passing of this clever show but at least it didn't over stay its welcome and become a ghost of its former self. ""Dead Like Me"" left the TV plane too early but it won't be forgotten.",1122249600,24,2910,4.698039215686275
2264349,5,B00094ARGY,It's unfortunate such a show with great writing has been cancelled.  Alas we've got two dvd sets to keep it immortal (like a reaper).  This dvd set is as good as the first of course and too bad there won't be another.. its a great shame.  If you like a show that will send you laughing until permanently have to buy depends in the store... THIS IS IT!  Each episode leaves you with enough material to ponder about life/death and with tons of questions leaving you wanting more! Hopefully some intelligent money-hungry studio executive decide to pick the show up to continue seasons. It would continue to be a guaranteed hit. Until then...we will thoroughly enjoy the dvds.,1122076800,7,672,4.669491525423729
2264350,4,B00094ARGY,"Dead Like Me is yet another example of a TV show cut down in its prime. MGM and the show's creator, Bryan Fuller, butted heads over creative differences and this led to his departure during the first season. The show survived with very little disruption for a strong second season and then was promptly canceled by the studio. Dead Like Me took a smart, clever and very entertaining look at death that was free of the pretension that plagues a show like Six Feet Under. It is much more playful in tone, much like the also defunct Wonderfalls.

Dead Like Me treats reaping as a job just like any other except for the crucial difference that these characters are harvesting peoples' souls. There is a playful, whimsical side to the show that is largely a part of its appeal. In the episode, ""Send in the Clown,"" there is a spot-on parody of Hill Street Blues, right down to the music, a famous line of dialogue and so on but for parking enforcement. Six Feet Under this ain't - unless it merged with Harold and Maude. It's frustrating when such an obviously brilliant show is cut down before it really is allowed to reach its full potential.

All of the extras are located on the fourth DVD. ""Dead Like Me...Again"" is an 11-minute featurette about the show. The cast talk about their characters and gush about working on the show. Sadly, the irony is that everyone talks as if another season is in the works when we know that the show has been cancelled.

""Putting Life Into Death"" takes a look at how the special effects technicians bring the CGI Gravelings to life and how they pulled off five other effects, such as souls passing through live beings and how the death ripple, when a reaper touches someone before they die, is achieved.

Also included are nine deleted scenes totaling 11 minutes that are not put into context, so, at times, it's difficult to figure out which episode they come from.

Finally, there is a photo gallery featuring some stills from the show.",1121817600,9,1971,4.588068181818182

2264352,5,B00094ARGY,I am getting fed up with networks that keep killing great TV. I loved Dead Like Me from the first episode. I waited over a year to see season 2 and didn't even know it was out until the first run was over. I am now watching them rerun on Showtime and will buy the second set soon. I love the characters in this show. Some of the episodes in this season I will admit do seem to rehash previous concepts I still found them interesting and enjoyable to watch. I would love a third season of this show or perhaps a Showtime movie or miniseries at least to answer all the left over questions.,1121817600,5,587,4.113043478260869
2264353,5,B00094ARGY,"I think the FCC should start fining broadcast and cable networks whenever they cancel cricially-acclaimed series that are also doing stellarly with ratings. For a pay cable channel, ""Dead Like Me"" was doing fabulously until its untimely demise.

But all that aside, what you have here is the second fifteen parts of a 29-part saga that make up the lives of five grim reapers (six if you count the shortlived Betty Rhomer from season 1.)

The production values, dialogue, acting, score, and almost every nuance is orchestrated perfectly. The only thing that this DVD errs on is a lack of any real special features, but 15 episodes of grim reaper snark and melodrama is enough to make me giddy and happy.

Perhaps if the stars align, if Betty Rhomer emerges from the cliffs of Dover Bay again, and if Mason and Daisy tie the knot ever, we just might see a season three of Dead Like Me.

But if not, add this to your DLM collection and revel in the stellar work of a cast and crew for a job well done.",1121731200,6,998,4.467032967032967
2264354,4,B00094ARGY,"The second season of ""Dead Like Me"" wasn't as strong as the first, but it was pretty close, still very engaging and better than most other television shows on cable and the networks.  The main problem with season 2 is that it sets up many interesting questions that were meant to be answered in future seasons, but we'll never get those answers because someone at showtime decided to kill it's best show.  Rumors and petitions are all over the net trying to bring the show back on another network, but that will probably never happen, as many of the actors have new projects lined up.  It's just such a shame!  It sounds childish, but I cancelled Showtime because of the cancellation of this show.  If you liked ""Dead Like Me"" or any other recently cancelled show, let the network know your opinion.  Could you imagine not having a second season of ""Lost"" and not knowing the answers to that show?",1121731200,6,897,4.575
2264355,5,B00094ARGY,"It was quite a surprise to find out the reason Showtime hadn't resumed showing a new season of DLM.  It is quite disheartening to see such an intelligent funny dark comedy cancelled and replaced by more of the usual ""rubbish"" that the networks grind out.  The second season was actually better than the first, and we really saw the character of ""George"" grow up into adult, something she couldn't do while alive.  The entire cast was excellent, and the interaction of the ""reapers"" among themselves and with their ""victims"" was hysterically funny.  There were so many unaswered questions woven into the plots about the reapers that we will never know the answers to.  The development of this mismatched group of characters was so interesting, plus the subplot of George's family gave such a deep dimension to the overall story.  What will happen to Joy and Reggie?  How did Rube die?  What was his history?  I'm sure the writers would have given us a wonderful ride, if only Showtime stuck with it.  Will we be asking these questions about the ""Fat Actress""?  I doubt it.  (Sorry Kirstie, it's not you, it's the show).  At least we will have two seasons of DVD's to keep the ""Dead"" alive.",1121040000,6,1188,4.70873786407767
2264356,3,B00094ARGY,"The reputations of many great shows are tarnished by being kept around even a little too long.  In one case, that of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the quality sunk into a pit about 15 episodes before closing up shop.  I am sure fans of Sliders can tell you another story about this problem.

I remember others saying that the show had a perfect first season, and those episodes should have stood alone.  I disagreed at the time, but am not so sure anymore.

The main problem with this season was its way with failing to develop plot threads.  I can't give specific examples, as that would be against the review guidelines, but if you were expecting the stories of some supporting characters to be expanded, forget it.  The only decently developed plotline was a late thread focusing on Rube.  Everything else felt like a waste of time.

I apologize if I make Dead Like Me S2 sound like horrible TV; it was still a decent show to watch, if nothing to watch twice.  I am afraid, however, that further seasons would only have further tarnished the high quality of the first.",1120521600,13,1067,4.539267015706806

It helps ask questions that we as a society are afraid to ask. Also as an added bonus it manages to put in a humorous light the thing that is coming for all of us.,1114819200,7,763,3.9934640522875817
