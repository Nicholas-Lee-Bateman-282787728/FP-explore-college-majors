8073612,4,B000A2WORA,"This is the best movie I've found about this catastrophic tsunami event. Good explanation, good footage of the terrible power of the tsunami as it came ashore and moved through towns; well paced. Get this movie while it is still available.",1290124800,5,239,4.853658536585366
8073613,5,B000A2WORA,"A reviewer of the National Geographic tsunami DVD gave a bad review because coverage of the 2004 tsunami was missing; apparently he did not notice that the DVD was made in 2000.  This NOVA DVD is mostly about the 2004 tsunami.  Many reviewers of other tsunami DVDs give bad reviews because they had expected to see footage of the actual tsunami, the actual huge wave that blocked most of the horizon, hit sumatra, Thailand, Sri Lanka, or any of the other places that it hit.  This is silly.  NO SUCH FOOTAGE EXISTS, as a worker at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawai'i is astute to point out in this particular DVD.  Whoever, if anyone, was filming was mowed down and killed by the tsunami.  The lack of footage is also testament to the unpraparedness of the human race to respond to deadly tsunamis.  We all must remember that the countries that the tsunami hit are not exactly the most developed countries in the world, AND at the time and, perhaps, still today there is no tsunami warning system in the Indian Ocean.  Even after the tsumami struck its first blow on Sumatra, even the places on the planet who watch closely and are the first to detect such disasters did not know exactly what was happening or the scale of what was happening for quite a while. Even if we could have sent helicopters to shoot footage of the tsunami waves hitting other places after Sumatra, the probability of filming a huge wave is not huge becuase the height of the wave is different in all places because the height depends on the particular morphology of the coastline.  There is, actually, footage of the wave where is was not so large and did not have the height or power to kill whoever was filming.  The northwestern United States could certainly be next, says this DVD.  I highly recommend this DVD to everyone because destructive disasters on everyone's planet is everyone's business.",1135987200,3,1887,4.653614457831325
