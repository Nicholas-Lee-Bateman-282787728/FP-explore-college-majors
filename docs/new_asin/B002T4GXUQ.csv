3983648,5,B002T4GXUQ,"In the lead up to the Iraq invasion there was more debate about whether there were WMDs than most people remember.  Many even say today that everyone thought there were WMDs (or, as Ali G. puts it, BLTs) at the time.  I certainly did not.  Multiple former UN weapons inspectors stated their opinion that Iraq had neither WMD weapons programs, any stockpile of operable weapons, nor, even if they had had them, any means to deliver them.  Scott Ritter, whom the Right immediately sought to discredit because of a minor Internet dating peccadillo, stated with enormous precision what the situation in Iraq was with regard to WMDs.  The invasion of Iraq merely confirmed what Ritter, who was the person who had initially determined the breadth and extent of the Iraqi WMD program, was saying before the invasion.  Also, the Pew Foundation released a study of all publicly available information (much of it from reports from UN weapons inspectors) concluding that Saddam Hussein had neither weapons nor delivery systems.  My point is that I was utterly confident before the invasion of Iraq that there were no WMD and I was pretty convinced that Team Bush had no secret information that would trump what the inspectors had already seen.

But I'm sure we all remember that Bush and Tony Blair and all their subordinates pushed forward all kinds of ""proof"" for an invasion that they had already decided to undertake.

IN THE LOOP chronicles from a darkly comical point of view those halcyon days leading up to the invasion, replete with pushy, manipulative behind the scenes aides, incompetent cardboard figures of politicians, and third tier bureaucrats.  There is political gamemanship, brinksmanship, cajoling, threatening, and attempts to dominate through intimidation and aggressive profanity.  This is all spun out through a series of outstanding performances.  The cast is a gifted ensemble, though Peter Capaldi is especially compelling as a particularly aggressive British aide.  My favorite scene was probably one between an American department head and an American general (played by James Gandolfini) in a child's bedroom, as he adds up key stats on a toy adding machine that makes musical sounds as each key is depressed.  And I was especially pleased to see Anna Chlumsky in an important role.  Yes, this is the same Anna Chlumsky from MY GIRL from the early nineties.  She shouldn't have stayed away for so long.

This is not a film for everyone.  Much of the humor is either dark or subtle.  And the movie is filmed with Type A personalities strutting about, making life unpleasant for those in positions of lesser power.  But the result is an impressive lampooning of the days back before we had actually invaded Iraq.  I highly recommend it.",1251676800,11,2753,5.006593406593407
3983649,4,B002T4GXUQ,"If you like British humor of the Monty Python sort, and are cynical about politics, this caustic, over-the-top satire may be your ticket. It comes at a price, though, with unrelenting vulgarity from start to finish, much of which, I must say, is hilarious. When I watched the movie, people in the theater were laughing aloud; so was I. Amidst international fears about the possibility of an unspecified war, Britain's minister for International Development Simon Foster lets slip an ambiguous affirmation that ""war is unforeseeable."" His communication chief, Malcolm Tucker, goes ballistic. The crisis requires extensive negotiations with fellow buffoons, spinners, and careerist diplomats in Washington, including teenage-looking interns, minutes of meetings that must be ""corrected,"" and talk of a ""war committee."" All of this, mind you, without any regard at all for citizens who'll suffer the consequences of their vanity and folly. The message of the film is that, regardless of parties or administrations in both Britain and the US, government is badly broken and deeply dysfunctional.",1249603200,17,1091,5.5
3983650,4,B002T4GXUQ,"""In the Loop"" is a sharp and witty and funny and depressing take on the office politics of politics.  Simon Foster is the ambitious but largely clueless and weak-willed British ""minister for international development.""  When he makes the mistake of suggesting, contrary to the official British position, that an imminent war was ""unforeseeable"" on a BBC radio interview, he is colorfully and harshly reprimanded by the British press secretary who seems incapable of putting three words together without a creative interjection of expletives.  Simon suddenly finds himself in the midst of a power struggle between hawks and doves (both UK and US) and interns and career politicians, some who care about whether the war (ostensibly the war in Iraq, which is never actually mentioned) proceeds and, mostly, others who care more about their own future in politics.  The point is that even when it comes to matters of greatest urgency, the petty and small are never far off.  It's a clever and very funny take on bureaucracy and international politics, that would be even funnier if it weren't so awfully scary.  Shot in the kinetic documentary style made popular on the BBC's Office and its American remake - it may make you dizzy while the wordplay has your head spinning.

The plot of the movie is simple enough. A war is being contemplated in the Middle East by America and Britain and two factions within those governments are jockeying for power to either prevent it or to go ahead with starting the war. There are countless details of bureaucracies that go flying by and you may need to watch it twice to catch them all (partly due to the various heavy accents). All the characters that you find in every bureaucracy are there (the sycophant, the psychopath, the career builder, the fence sitter). Peter Capaldi's portrayal of a perpetual foul-mouthed, berserker bureaucrat makes you wonder if he's going to have a heart attack halfway through the film (it is awesome).",1463184000,,922,4.726708074534161

Far away in England, a lonely foreign-relations minister, Simon Foster, played by Tom Hollander somehow speaks his mind and not the co any talk, and he is not staying on track. This is a talk show and it hits the news with a bang. The Prime Minister has a foul mouthed communications director, Martin Tucker, played by Peter Capaldi, who goes ballistic. Simon tries to back talk but somehow gets caught up and goes go Washington to be part of low level discussions with a war committee. His job is to backtrack,,but he makes thing worse, and is sent home to London.

Meantime in the U.S., a State Department official, played hilariously by Mimi Kennedy, has found out about the ""war committee"" and is trying to find people in government to talk down any thing pertaining to war.  An arm chair general, played by James Gandolfini, does not want anything to do with war.  Under secretaries, over secretaries, and all matter if person el become involved in one mishap after another. A scapegoat is found, and war is delayed for a day of two.

Well written,well acted, hilarious characters in this film, and we should view this film once a year, just because.

3983700,3,B002T4GXUQ,"3 1/2 stars -- there'a a lot of energy here, and if you like a broad caricature of a bullying PR man, Peter Capaldi will fill the bill. I don't think that there's any character in the movie, British or American, who isn't at some time or another chewed out in profane and scatological terms by Capaldi's character, Malcolm Tucker, who as ""Director of Communications"" for the unnamed British Prime Minister, undertakes to keep everyone on message -- and that means keeping even cabinet members from definitely NOT ruling out the possibility of military action in the Middle East. When Simon Foster (Tom Hollander), the British Cabinet Secretary for International Development, says in response to a reporter's question that war is ""unforeseeable,"" Tucker is all over him. It's soon clear that the powers-that-be, both in Washington and in London, are expecting, and even wanting, a war to be undertaken, and the meat of the story is how resistance to that idea, especially in Washington, is overcome by middle-level and lower-level officials, with Tucker in the thick of things, cracking the necessary heads. There's a broad difference in the ways that Americans and British political figures are represented in the movie: in America, there seems to be a desire on the part of some in government to avoid war, while in Britain, the issue seems to be rather with just not messing up what the PM has already decided. In both places, some of the humor derives from the naked careerism of all involved, so that affairs of great importance seem to be being resolved in terms of office politics rather than global politics. For example, a good deal of humor is derived from one character seeking to organize a committee meeting and keep that a secret from other characters who suspect that the innocuously named committee is really a ""war committee"" -- so meeting places and times are shifted in ways that belong to a sitcom like ""The Office,"" even though events of global importance are on the table. There's also a concern with the leak of a report, and later the rewriting of that same report, all carried out with no regard at all for the opinions and reservations of the writer of the report.

But does it add up to a well-focused satire? I'm not so sure. The crucial decisions have been made by characters we don't even see, so what we do see is the process of getting these decisions implemented. Sycophancy, egotism, and careerism are rampant in the ""middle management"" level where the process is being played out, but at no point do we feel that war is being undertaken BECAUSE of sycophancy and careerism on the part of aides and junior officials. There's a good deal of local humor in the process, but not a consistent target of serious satire. Capaldi is the engine who drives the process from the British side and makes his presence felt in Washington too, and the pleasure of the movie is seeing him in action. There's a funny little sidebar that reminds us that British Cabinet Ministers are also Members of Parliament -- so that Foster, while trying to undo the damage from his ""unforeseen"" statement, has to go home to his constituency and face the wrath of Paul Michaelson (Steve Coogan), a constituent who is angry because his neighbor's wall is collapsing into his Mum's garden and his MP, Foster, doesn't seem to be helping out with this problem. It's a nice cameo by Coogan, and on the American side, there's something more than a cameo from James Gandolfini as a General who doesn't seem to know much about war and doesn't seem keen to fight one, but rather likes to think of himself as ""the Gore Vidal of the Pentagon."" Other actors do good work -- Anna Chlumsky is Liza Weld, the assistant to the American Assistant Secretary of State Karen Clarke (Mimi Kennedy) whose report is leaked after a bizarre series of events in Britain that are prompted by Foster's aide's girlfriend discovering that her boyfriend Toby (an effective Chris Addison) has tumbled into bed with Weld while accompanying Foster to negotiations in the US. So a dimension of family drama is added to the office politics that take up most of the movie. And it isn't an accident that the only reasonably competent person, Judy Molloy (Gina McKee), is maneuvered out of her job as Foster's aide by Toby and therefore has to watch or hear about the confusions and turbulence in the US from a distance.

Sounds complicated, and to a degree it is, but the plot-lines and motivations are clear, and the overall tone is set by Capaldi's Tucker, who ignites the movie with raucous, profane energy whenever he is on the screen. When he isn't on screen, the movie works more fitfully. Still, it's not too long, and it isn't totally mindless, and if you don't expect really pointed satire, then you'll find it quite enjoyable.",1425168000,,4801,4.755395683453237

A trifle contrived but even that aspect of it faithfully reflects 21st century message-spinning practices.  Loosely based on US/UK military interventions in the Middle East, this film is strong in its depiction of how the policy levers got/get pulled, how personal and institutional cross-Atlantic alliances get done and get frayed, how tensions arise between career Governmentalists and callow, wet-behind-the ears front-office staffers, and how the art of the strategic leak gets practiced.  All this is captured in a metaphorical ambition souffle. Unique in that it mocks both governments while it absolutely devastates the way they worked--and failed--together.  Notable in that it casts James Gandolfini in a role he often played: as a US general.",1391299200,,868,5.7578125
3983751,4,B002T4GXUQ,"This is a political satire with the cynical verbal barbs of British humor. I enjoyed it for many reasons which I will explain in this review. It is primarily about spin.  By this I mean that the film is mainly about British and American politicians and bureaucrats trying to control the message, threaten their colleagues if they stray from the message, adapt quickly when conditions change and thus the message needs to change, multiple ways to deceive, and ways to cover your fingerprints as you try to turn every situation into a career win rather than a career loss. Sound familiar?  Yes, every type of careerist is characterized here but with their weaknesses revealed exponentially.

Peter Capaldi plays the Director of Communications for the British Prime Minister. As such he has to keep the rest of the government on message. Whenever an official in government strays off message, he goes crazy and becomes a threatening profanity filled demon to bring them back in line. Unfortunately for the nave Secretary of International Development Simon Foster, played perfectly by Tom Hollander, he lets a personal opinion about Mid-east tensions slip in an interview. Simon is a good fellow who is totally over his head in the insane world of cut-throat politics. He plays the role of the gentle fool, he tries to be wise and ends up sounding foolish, and he becomes a ping pall ball in the political discourse as the United States and Great Britain move toward an invasion of an unnamed country.  On Simons staff is  his Communications Director, Judy Malloy, played by the exceptional actress Gina McKee. She also plays Caterina Sforza in the epic series, The Borgias, with Jeremy Irons as Pope Alexander VI. If there is a character that may serve as the moral center of the film, the observer of all the chaos and miscommunication, it is Judy Malloy.  Her boss is not very supportive, a new understudy is hired for the office, and the Director of Communication for the Prime Minister is openly hostile toward her as if it is her fault that Simon Foster makes idiotic but well meaning comments to the press that are twisted for political ends. Chris Addison plays the new communications assistant in Simons office, Toby Wright, and he creates one crisis after another with his careless leaks to the press.  There is a wonderful scene where he is caught having a one-night-stand with an old graduate school friend and his excuses and denials provide a miniature example of the spin being practiced by the more senior statesmen in the film.

On the American side of the equation, things are almost as idiotic. Two dueling Assistant Secretaries of State try to continually out play each other as the United States moves toward an invasion of another country. Mimi Kennedy plays Assistant Secretary Clark whose bright young assistant, played by Anna Chlumsky, has done a policy analysis and found many more disadvantages of an invasion compared to advantages. She also has discovered that the British intelligence source, Iceman, is highly unreliable. What is portrayed so well here is that competition exists at multiple layers of organizations with folks most competitive with people at their own level. Mimi Kennedy is outstanding in this film. Her competitor, Assistant Secretary of State for Policy, Linton Barwick, speaks non-sense to continually throw people off his track. He is played by David Rasche.  James Gandolfini is also excellent playing the Pentagon general who is trying to protect his career while the pro-war and anti-war forces battle in the policy and press arenas.

In the policy world of leaks to the relentless press, distorted and unreliable intelligence sources, careerism and competition, poor message control, and shifting alliances; this political satire sometimes rings all too true. I admit this film is not for everyone. The cursing by Peter Capaldi, while highly creative and imaginative, is also a bit crude. The dialogue is fast and furious and sometimes due to the British accents is hard to understand. However, as a mini-mirror into the world of policy formation, it is right on the money.",1391040000,3,4127,5.011678832116789

3983764,4,B002T4GXUQ,"Solid.  Funny.  Relentlessly cynical.  Morbidly quick-witted.  More realistic than many serious films on the same topic.  Kind of like an Altman film.  We elect an awful lot of fools, assisted by kids who ran for high school vice-president.  Drop a microphone in their midst, put something serious on the agenda (a war, health care), and it's hilariously horrifying.

It portrays women with more balls then men, both sides of the Atlantic. In Britain its the Scots vs. females.  In the U.S. its women vs. wing nuts.  The funniest parts are Scots vs. U.S. wing nuts.  The women, however, are curiously inept in the end.

Some people will have trouble with this film.  It's fast talking, heavy accents.  If people don't pick up fast language, they'll get frustrated, feel stupid, and get angry about it.  There's plenty of stuff for people who prefer their comedy done differently.

Pros: Captured tribalism in bureaucracy (corporate or gov't).  In Britain the Scots do the dirty political work, screwing other people's careers and talking a stream of vulgarity.  In the U.S. the kids do the actual government work, getting evidence and reporting it.  Then they go dance in mosh pits.

Cons: A movie plot shouldn't set up a dynamic (tight vote schedule or bust) and then forget about it.  The 2nd half proceeds to make a U.N. vote essential, and very quickly.  That fizzles, with plot twists that don't pan out.

Gandolfini steps in, and shines, but the movie keeps him from making the right move.  Necessarily cynical, I assume.  Because of the tight time line, had a dove like Gandolfini physically restrained a key hawk the hawks would have missed their tight schedule.

But that would be too earnest, so one of the light weight patsies should have done the same thing, putting the world into the hands of the least likely.  Because the hawks are physical cowards. it was a missed opportunity.",1384646400,,1894,4.855799373040752

3983769,2,B002T4GXUQ,"""ALL HAIL GREAT SATIRE!"" screams the hyperbole on the DVD package of director Armando Iannucci's In The Loop. This film is neither great nor does it offer any new ideas about political satire. Ave juvenilis, I would think.

There are good films and distracting ones...and there are films where one element delivers a death-dealing train wreck to an otherwise passable effort. There is satire and there is wit. In The Loop overplays the former at the expense of the latter.

I can imagine the creators getting drunk together on a regular basis and, as if determined to destroy a sensible and witty plot, opt to antagonize their audience with non-stop strafing missions against intellect. These are only so-so writers at best and pretentious sarcasts at worst, relying throughout their drivel on an irritating use of coarse language - as if the word `f***' and all its derivatives, plus other carnal insults were the only vocabulary choices available to them: it's gratuitous, childish, and suggests the nadir of British writing talent.

For my money, Dr Strangelove starring Peter Sellers, was the epitome of political satire on film. ""Yes, Minister"" (BBC) was high water on British television, and many of the 1950s-era ""Goon Show"" radio programs - again with Peter Sellers - were fantastic satires on English society. Obviously, these masterstrokes of great satirical writing were never consulted before the creators of In The Loop began their persistent slog through the sewers of our native tongue.

The performance by the late James Gandolfini delivered far more than the creators did for In The Loop. Comparatively speaking, the balance of this film was stillborn and a waste of time.

My appraisal: Two (2) stars out of five: One for Gandolfini; the other for the marketing group who led so many astray by hyping this terrible movie.",1384214400,,1839,5.0561056105610565

The addition of James Gandolfini results in a few scenes where he and Peter Capaldi as Tucker go head to head and it is an intriguing combination.
Stretching the normally 1 hour show to a full length movie does result in some bits that aren't quite as tight a the TV version and overall the British cast steals the show here. This is possibly explained by the same team having worked together for 4 seasons giving the British sequences a bit more comic rhythm.

3983808,4,B002T4GXUQ,"""In The Loop"" is a well done but depressing comedy/drama about the U.S. president and the British prime minister trying to sell a war to their respective legislative branches.  It's pretty much a thinly veiled commentary on the run-up to the Iraq war (or maybe it's exactly the Iraq war they're talking about, just not mentioning it by name), with every scene showing people screaming into phones, running through corridors with files, or engaging in paranoia-laced whispers about who knows what about what secret committee, back-room meeting, or other ""inside"" event.

The movie is depressing because its main message seems to be that EVERYONE in government, from the most-seasoned legislator to the lowliest staffer, would immediately get behind anything, even a horribly-flawed war initiative, if it would help his or her career or stroke his ego (being offered a seat on the RIGHT advisory committee is a particular Holy Grail in the film).  And what's truly depressing is that the film makes a convincing case that, too often, that is exactly what happens in situations like that.

But, if you can take the relentless cynicism and endless parade of self-serving characters, ""In The Loop"" will certainly entertain you with its sharp dialogue, dark humor, and overall intelligence.",1364428800,,1284,5.188405797101449

3983816,3,B002T4GXUQ,"Probably one of the most complex and subtle comedies ever devised. This film version of the vulgarity-heavy British TV series, The Thick of It, focuses within a controversial US-UK decision whether to plan for war (which is mentioned but the film emphasises more on a battle-of-conflict through bureaucracy and media than the morals and ethics).

The White House, cabinet officials, UN delegates, and military officials all set the stage for this very intelligent and omnipresent satire that knows when to have a say mocking the people responsible for your country's political affairs. However, amidst its wisdom and cryptic humour, lies a lack of cinematic edge and a very dry, unidentifiable environment about it that may leave some viewers struggling, impatient, alienated, or half-engaged as if like a real-time documentary. Like its TV series, an active brain and a keen interest in political affairs and opinion must be required for a film of its height.

In the Loop, on thematic grounds, works on many levels showing the irony, hypocrisy, and almost true-life realism (thanks to the often superfluous yet stylistically believable performances of Capaldi and Gandolfini who may be enlightening, frightening, and intimidating) of how everything works through the highs and lows (mostly the lows here). It was also released during a politically tense period that reflects the heavy anti-Bush sentiment and the attitudes of the British and Americans.

Satire at its highest order (definitely not a comedy at parts as some might interpret); In the Loop was a very daring and rich effort on BBC Films and Armando Iannucci (the creator/writer) to have pictured and illuminated a film that might have otherwise been looked as filler for The Thick of It or pretentious, long-winded garbage into a complex, thought-provoking film that leaves for a whole lot of open-ended questions than what most satires will offer these days. Iannucci's work (aside from Alan Partridge) lives in two worlds- the engaging, the frustrating, and the confusing and without a doubt, this film fits that definition.

In the Loop, in all its intensified glory and an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay, is equal parts good, bad, and ugly (when the ending does not signify much in the process other than more whining and a built-up but poorly presented climax).",1362960000,2,2347,5.2175066312997345

3983825,4,B002T4GXUQ,"This is the BBC tv show, THE THICK OF IT, brought to the movie screen.  Both satirize politics in a docudramedy mode.  You are virtually convinced you are seeing the political scene as it exists unfold before you on the screen.  The movie takes this model but also blends in the United States whereas the tv version is set entirely in the UK and made in the UK with a UK cast.  The UK cast is mostly here but there is also an American contingent since the action shifts to Washington.  I liked it but the I like the tv show better.

For one, some of my favorite characters in the tv show are missing here, like Peter, who is hilarious. Also, although we are done with Nicola, there is no woman in this movie who comes close to replacing her. The American cast adds James Gandolfini who is ok but just not as funny as the UK counterparts. I hate to say it but I can also never fully believe him as anyone other than Tony Soprano so we start out in the hole with his addition to the cast.

If you are a fan of the show, you will watch this movie and enjoy it because you simply cannot get enough of it.  However, if you have never seen the tv show, there are 4 seasons of the THE THICK OF IT, most of those available on Amazon Instant Video.

3983826,5,B002T4GXUQ,"My boyfriend and I tend to have very different taste in comedy movies.  For shows we both enjoy Veep, The Office, Parks and Recreation, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, etc., but for movies he likes the Apatow/Rogen stuff (Superbad, Pineapple Express), which are alright, I guess, but I like things with more of a dry wit.  Anyway, I was super hesitant to have us watch this for ""movie night,"" since he doesn't generally like British comedy (hey, it can be an acquired taste), but with the super great reviews and the fact that it's created by the Veep guy (Armando Iannucci) and there have been a lot of ""The Office"" comparisons, I thought it was worth the chance.

I found it absolutely hilarious.  It's not super dry humor and definitely not family friendly.  On a scale of 1-Deadwood for cursing, it's a Deadwood.  It is very similar to Veep on HBO - a bunch of pompous politicians running around formulating schemes and trying to get ahead by any means necessary.  It's a satire of bureaucrats, obviously, and it's done very well.  If you've seen Veep and like it, this is a no-brainer.

So, it was an A with me.  Did my boyfriend like it?  He didn't find it to be the next Superbad, but he laughed quite a bit, especially at Peter Capaldi's character, Malcolm Tucker.  Let's just say he's one of the most vulgar British guys I've seen on screen, and he curses like Al Swearengen.  He's also super hilarious and witty, and every scene he's in we both laughed at.  But no - you probably won't like this if you only appreciate Apatow humor.  My boyfriend overall did not like it and would never watch it again.

Some people found it to be a downer.  Well, the truth that is reflects is definitely depressing, but the movie isn't - so just don't overanalyze it.

Also, if you like this, like I said before, check out Veep on HBO, or if you really like Peter Capaldi, watch the BBC's successful comedy series that this movie was a spin-off of: The Thick of It.

Oh, and maybe some familiar American faces - James Gandolfini (Tony Soprano), Zach Woods (Gabe Lewis from The Office), and Anna Chlumsky (who plays a very similar role as Amy in Veep)",1351900800,,2148,4.518134715025907
3983827,5,B002T4GXUQ,"The negative reviews for this movie seem mostly to be from people who were surprised by and offended by this film's extensive, creative, vivid profanity. There is no doubt, this film is full of cussing and if that's likely to bother you you should stay away.

This film is about cowardly people trying to manipulate each other in the runup to the Invasion of Iraq in 2003. It is, more or less by definition, a black comedy. They lie, they cheat, they curse. The English are savaged by the Scottish and disdained by the Americans. Those against the war are alternately ignored or mocked by those who are for it. There are very few principled characters in this movie, and by the end they're mostly out of jobs.

The dialog is very quick and, in some cases, heavily accented. Some of the insults rely on U.K. slang (""hod""==wheelbarrow). Some, even when the words are clear, will be obscure to American audiences (why does Paul Higgens refer to Chris Addison as ""Love, Actually"", for example?. The movie reference is clearly intended as an insult, but what in particular is he mocking?)

Most of the casting is great -- Peter Capaldi as the ball-busting Director of Communications for the British Prime Minister, Gina McKee as Director of Communications for the hapless Tom Hollander. Mimi Kennedy does well as Assistant Secretary of State, trying her best to slow the leap into war. She is mostly ignored by the perfectly cast David Rache, who favors the war and is clearly the president's favorite. Zach Woods and Anna Chlumsky are great as junior state department staffers.

The politics and interpersonal relationships in this film are depicted in a sophisticated way. The humor, however, is often juvenile; the laughs come mostly from insults and cursing, with some from ""cringe humor,"" as the characters find themselves in socially awkward situations, and some also from amusing cross-cultural errors. My favorite of these was a scene in which (the Scot) Peter Capaldi ends a fight with an American general played by James Gandolfini by spitting ""And don't you ever call me English again."" A look of momentary confusion crosses Gandolfini's face, making clear that he has no idea what Capaldi is talking about.

3983832,3,B002T4GXUQ,"There are a fair number of chuckles in 'In the Loop' but the writers clearly could not find a way past their broad political bromides (war is bad, bureaucrats are ineffectual toadies, demagogues demagogue, etc.) to qualify their project as successful satire (peppering off-color anatomical references throughout doesn't quite cut it).  There are riffs of quick and well-delivered banter; lots of name-dropping and faux topicality (pretentiousness that used to pass for wit on shows like 'Murphy Brown' and 'The West Wing' in the U.S.); and longer periods of dramatic artifice, generally by way of angry diatribe.  But where are the laughs?  U.K. comedies like 'The Office' and 'Saxondale' are biting and brilliant and cringe-inducing because they reveal a prevailing, small-scale foolishness in all our attempts to be self-important.  ITL ultimately seems to be trying very hard itself to be important on a grand scale, to make its own jaded (and tiredly obvious) statement rather than poke deserved fun at the bores, the hypocrites and the world-shakers in the halls of power-- the archetypes who so often make life so miserable for the rest of us-- and sadly, for me, it undermined the whole idea.  My favorite character ended up being Steve Coogan's totally superfluous constituent, who through his single-minded obliviousness manages to suggest the larger parody that ITL might have been.

When I watch a movie, I want to be entertained, amused, educated, or thought provoked...and at least interested. I do not want to be confused, put off, or irritated etc. Within 10 minutes I was sure this was NOT going to be something I wanted to waste my time on but I gave it 5 more minutes before I hit the point where I could just not stand to watch it any longer.

A main? character is verbally throwing a huge hissy ego fit and trying to use every vulgar, violent threat he can - including shouting into his phone on an elevator where someone else is also trying to have a phone conversation and the mean guy can't even have the tiniest spec of consideration for the people around him (much less who he's ripping apart on the phone) and crosses over to stand directly in front of the other person on the phone.  He then makes it into the office and starts verbally spewing as much contempt and profanity etc. as he can around there...  What set this guy off you might wonder? The prime minister? answered a question on the radio with a statement that basically the prospect of war is ""unforeseeable"".  Ok, so perhaps (if I knew more background on this) that wasn't the best thing the guy could've said - but in no way should it have gotten that bad of a reaction.  Ugh.  I don't want to have to be around that kind of behavior in real life, I sure as heck don't want it blasted at me for 15 min or longer when I'm trying to be entertained.

3983835,5,B002T4GXUQ,"Forget the comparisons with Strangelove and Wag the Dog. Those are both classics in their own right, but ""In the Loop"" is different. The closest comparison I can give this is ""Yes Minister"", but far more subversive. This is razor-sharp.

The point of the film is political career as well as the way political power works. When is a politician willing to sacrifice career for principle, and what happens to principled politicians when faced with trans-Atlantic geopolitics? When does one choose expediency over principle? The prospect is bleak.

In this case both British and Americans are put to the test in the face of an impending war in the Middle-East - pushed by a cynical American appointee who keeps a live hand grenade as a paper-weight. It's not a spoiler that the Anglo-American alliance does go to war. That's pretty much assumed from the beginning.

What is fascinating is how this horrific combination of appeasement and war-mongering can be turned into comedy. One could have played this any number of ways. But comedy? ... As in LOL comedy ?  Not a kind of PBS/NPR occasional chuckle, but actual' laughs?

This film succeeds wonderfully.  It is an incredibly funny and acerbic portrayal of power.

One word on the dialogue: across the pond, profanities can approach sheer poetry. ""In the Loop"" is a wonderful exploration of that capability. If this is a concern for you then there is a delightful scene in the film that addresses the issue. Watch for it.",1343865600,,1469,4.875502008032129

A film that is all about political spin, as US and UK mid-level politicians debate invading an ""unnamed"" Middle East country, and then have to play catch-up when sensitive and classified information somehow gets leaked to the media. The film is laugh-out-loud funny, but probably also scarily not too far from the truth. The dialogue is gloriously obscene: DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE if you are offended by language (I doubt there is a single line of Peter Capaldi's manic dialogue that isn't laced with truly inventive scatology). James Gandolfini, as the US Army lieutenant general who happens to be a dove, may be the only recognizable face, but the entire ensemble is brilliantly cast, and it is probably Peter Capaldi as Malcolm Tucker whom you will most likely remember.

3983844,5,B002T4GXUQ,"Armando Iannuci, responsible for VEEP and THE THICK OF IT, strikes gold again with IN THE LOOP.  IN THE LOOP is somewhat of a spiritual successor to the British series THE THICK OF IT, so fans of the show will know what to expect.  This movie is fast -- it moves by so quickly, it took a repeat viewing to catch all the jokes -- and the movie feels like it was created on the spot.  This immediacy gives the movie a more realistic feel, even if the characters (most of them anyways) speak in stilted dialogue that is worthy of the stage.

I will stress, if you are uncomfortable with profanity, pass on this movie.  Much of the language here is crass, vulgar, and mean.  If you enjoy awkward comedy (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Office-The-Complete-BBC-Collection-First-and-Second-Series-Plus-Special/dp/B0002W4P98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Office: The Complete BBC Collection (First and Second Series Plus Special)</a>), there is plenty to enjoy here.  Most of funny beats comes from awkward and embarrassing moments.  I'm not quite sure I would call this satire, as others have, but it sure is cynical.  The script flies by at an incredible pace, and it feels like there's not a wasted moment of movie here.

While this has been one of my favorite comedies in years, not everyone is a fan.  It seems that folks either seem to absolutely love it or absolutely hate it.  For that reason, the negative reviews here on Amazon are worth taking a look at.  They raise good points, but when it comes to comedy, it's hard to have any kind of ""objectively funny"" criterion.  If you're still undecided on if you would like this movie or not, check out the trailer or clips on YouTube.  The movie does not vary much in tone, so most clips you find will be representative of the rest of the movie.

I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, The Office, or any of Armando Iannuci's previous work.  If you enjoy mean, awkward, fast comedy, this movie is worth every penny.  It's not heartwarming, but it is gut-busting.",1337817600,4,2107,4.954415954415954
3983845,5,B002T4GXUQ,"The British have three distinct advantages when it comes to comedy: their naturally hilarious accents (exceeded only by a outrageous French accent), they produced Monty Python, and a cornered market on being bloody droll, very bloody droll, indeed.  In The Loop is a wickedly funny and wickedly smart political satire.  Specifically, In The Loop satirizes minor ministers/under secretaries, their aides, and communications fixers in the British and US governments (with plenty of cross-cultural wit to boot).

America is run by children.  This is in contrast with the British system, which gives career politicians dual responsibility for international development and retaining walls.  Such are the truths that receive a scathing treatment (very much of the funny-because-its-true variety--in the theater my friend who spent time as an aide on the hill was rendered virtually to tears by the truthiness of the first).  That wit never loses its razor-sharp edge.  Not when it mocks a minister's incompetence, not when it mocks an aide's bumbling ambition, not when it mocks a minister's ritual humiliation, and not when it mocks our master race of toddlers.  Only when the matter of joining war begins in earnest does the it begin to set in that what we've been laughing at is not laughing matter (an unnamed war, and not exactly as any war happened, but close enough to be uncomfortable).  And therein lies the power of In The Loop.

Now beyond the movie being poor so is the production, acting, directing, and editing.  As most (maybe all ) IFC releases the video quality is very poor.  Seems low resolution, and herky jerky.  Heck someone with a home computer could improve upon it.  Acting is grade D television level.  I blame directing for that.  Editing is pitiful. You see things like one scene with bikers along the street rolling up on the middle of the scene, then cut to another angle and they are gone. Ditto for the vehicles on the street.  And so on and so forth.

In short, pretty much everything is bad about this.  How it got some good reviews I don't know other than folks like their cursing (I don't mind if it fits), and they are easily pleased.

With a dry British wit taking center stage, the loose backing plot is resigned to second fiddle until the third act. When the writing is this sharp and effective, though, that's perfectly fine by me. The meat of this story may be focused on the assistants and pages responsible for madly sprinting around the office on a whim and handling all the heavy lifting, but the sharpest satire is reserved for their bosses, the senators and secretaries who are more interested in photo ops and talking points than effecting any real change.

The writer/director said that when he screened it in Washington DC, afterwards people asked him how he knew about all the secret gaffes portrayed in the film.

3983851,2,B002T4GXUQ,"I'm still scratching my head on this one which came HIGHLY recommended by my sister who shares 99% of my taste. This was the other 1%. Sister ADORED this film. I thought it was a total waste of my time, but find it hard to explain why. Sharp-elbowed, appallingly ambitious, back-stabbing climbers can be the stuff of great comedy - particularly satire; and God knows they exist in spades in elite politics. And I love satire, at which no one excels the Brits. But this movie was not even bad -- it simply bored me to tears. It just fell flat. Not funny. Not even interesting enough to feel it was worth my time.

Clearly there is simply an element of personal taste here because the reviews are so variable. But I also had a big technical problem with the writing. The actors were good. Most unusual, I thought the American acting here even stronger than the British (James Gandolfino was particularly great in a small role I wish had been larger.) But the Brit writers revealed a serious weakness: they used the same voice for both their British and American characters, making them virtually indistinguishable aside from their accents. That rang jarringly false for me. Grasping, ambitious, self-centered, amoral and immoral socio-pathic creeps struggle to climb the political ladder in both the UK and the US (and the rest of the world, too, n'est ce pas?) But they don't interchangeably talk and act like one another in their shared obnoxiousness. Accents aside, the American characters could all have been Brits. This is the equivalent to a writer who cannot write realistically for people of the opposite gender. My sister had told me the satire skewers everyone and that no one comes out looking good - neither the Brits nor the Americans. At least that much we agreed on about this film . . . .

I stayed with it to the end because of my sister's referral. But honestly, if you're not hooked within the first 10 minutes, it doesn't get any better. You might as well then pull the plug.",1327104000,4,1993,4.659090909090909

From the camerawork to the embarrassed pauses to the dialog... imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, after all. Forget the reviewers who fixate on one character's excessive swearing; what matters is that this is a classic British comedy of embarrassment. Top politicians are essentially hollow idiots, everything is a cock-up rather than a conspiracy, hidden powers guide the world's destiny and the minor players (the protagonists of this movie) don't even get to glance at the script.

However, be warned: if your idea of funny is America's Funniest Home Videos or Animal House, then you will be disappointed. The script is superb as is the dialogue. I have no idea why one reviewer was disappointed unless they wanted inane comments in the mode of the Khardashian sisters or Simon Cowell. This is a British comedy which indicts American and British politicians. It is funny if you like British humor. But if you want jokes about farting then look elsewhere.

3983856,5,B002T4GXUQ,"This is a movie that some people really dislike.  It contains a surfeit of vulgar and profane language largely from the character of the British prime minister's director of communications brilliantly played by Peter Capaldi.  Also, it is satire, which is disliked by many  people.  The great American playwright George  S. Kaufman once said that ""Satire is what closes on Saturday night.""  The subject is a series of meetings in London and in Washington between U.S. and U.K. high government officials concerning the possibility of an impending war, presumably somewhere in the Middle-East.

Most of the actors in this film are new to me.  Some of the actors playing the parts of Americans may well be British actors.  These days, actors on both side of the pond can provide either American or British accents nearly perfectly.  One actor, definitely American, is James Gandolfini, playing an American General who reputedly uses a live hand grenade as a paper weight.

The superbly written film portrays these officials who, in their attempts to avoid the outbreak of a new war, only manage to move both countries closer and closer to it.  The cast and director of this fine film acquit themselves admirably.  The opening credits state that part of the funding for this film was provided by the U.K. Film Council, an organization that has since been abolished in order to reduce government spending.

It was an off-the-cuff comment by British government official, Simon Foster that brought down the wrath of the Prime Minister's chief enforcer and attack dog, Malcolm Tucker. In trying to dig his way out, Simon is then caught in another off-the-cuff interview talking about ""climbing the mountain of conflict."" In the meantime, US government official, Karen Clarke and General George Miller are hoping to short circuit mounting pressure for war on the US side. Thinking they've identified a like-minded Brit, they invite Simon to Washington to attend some conferences. Simon is sick of the know-it-all attitude of long-time staffer, Judy, so he takes the new hire, Toby. When Toby leeks details about the secret war committee meeting to CNN, the whole fiasco becomes a media feeding frenzy. Malcolm is less than pleased. He doesn't like to ""learn anything about a British government official on TV unless they've died."" And if words could kill, Simon would die a very brutal death, indeed.

If rough language offends you, do NOT go to In the Loop... consider yourself warned! For those who enjoy scathingly funny, take-no-prisoners dialog, In the Loop is high art. While the style of In the Loop is decidedly British, I believe American audiences, for the most part, will get on board with this one. Some of the accents are a bit difficult, but not impossible. It is impossible, however, to catch every line because of the unrelenting, rapid-fire pace of the dialogue. But in the end, most will catch more than enough to enjoy this film.

The satire and points raised are quite good and the dry British wit and stiff upper lip and American Bombastic attitudes are wonderfully mocked. The cast is pretty good and play their respective roles in a very deadpan way, Gandolfini is especially good as a Pentagon general. This film has some genuinely humorous moments in it and some biting sarcasm, but you come away startled at the thought that things like this may actually happen in the centres of power around the world and whilst it may be funny to watch for just over 90 minutes, in reality it may be a very scary world we live in!

The characters, British and American, are alternately moronic or dysfunctional to the point the viewer does not care about any of them. Much of the so-called humour is an endless stream of profanity, particularly from the PM's aide 'Malcolm,' who in real life would have been up on formal charges of harassment, discrimination, and intimidation within the first five minutes of the film. But apparently the makers have a very strange notion of the personalities that survive in the political world. This is not Dr. Strangelove or other great poltical comedies. There is nothing humorous or ""sharp"" about the dialogue and there is no plot or ending. Save your money, you would have more fun  with Fire Maidens of Outer Space (yes, it really is THAT bad).",1294358400,11,1020,4.730337078651686

3983865,1,B002T4GXUQ,"This is the worst movie I've seen since Damien. Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death had more griping scenes than In the Loop.

The gossamer thin, see through plot revolves around an unforeseen war somewhere in the Middle East. And then there are lots of politicians, government employees and military types talking about the war, doing way too much swearing and using the word unforeseen so many times that it quickly loses any whimsical charm it once had. It was unforeseen how many times they would use the word unforeseen.

I would rather take out the garbage at church than watch this movie. I did take out the garbage at church today, 4 bags full. And that was more enjoyable than In the Loop.

There's a politician who does an incredible amount of angry swearing. He has no redeeming values and he appears far too often. All he does is make a too stressful, utterly bad movie even worse. As Francois Chateaubriand, the French writer, politician and diplomat, wrote, ""One is not superior merely because one sees the world in an odious light.""

After 15 minutes of this utter dog of a movie, I suspected that nothing would save it from the straight and narrow path of nearly continuous whinging. There would be no phoenix like uplifting scene that totally changed the tone and tenor of this abominable waste of time, effort and disk space. And I was quite correct. Thankfully, I was cleaning house while the movie was playing. So I did do something productive.

***** Spoiler *****

Though, in truth, I can not spoil this movie because it's already rotten through and through.

At the end of the movie, the mean politician fired Simon. Then General Miller was incredibly mean, rude and crass to Simon. And that was the end. How is that the end of a movie? The whole thing is utter, pointless drivel with people yelling and swearing. Nothing is resolved; there's no character development or anything meaningful or even remotely funny that ever happens.

I listen to BBC Radio 4 quite often. (I know no other people in Minneapolis who listen to the BBC. Nearly all Americans are totally clueless when it comes to being informed about what's happening in other countries.) I quite enjoy The News Quiz with Sandi Toksvig and Just a Minute with Nicholas Parsons. It's sad that the makers of In the Loop live in the same country with such wonderful, informative and light hearted shows and still managed to learn nothing about entertainment.",1285459200,10,2458,4.740046838407494
3983866,5,B002T4GXUQ,"""Loop"" is perhaps the most obscenely funny film ever made,as well as a spot-on political satire, carpet bombing the ""f"" word from the beginning to the end of its Oscar-nominated script. Virtually star free yet perfectly cast, the rancid soul of the film is incarnated by Peter Capaldi, who hits the ground running as a British governmental operative and never lets up in his merciless barrages directed at his peers, subordinates and even a quasi-pacifistic American general played with precise ensemble spirit by James Gandolfini. The visual and verbal style of the film is frenetically-paced, skewering both British and American officials and would-be careerists as the film hops, skips and jumps from London to Washington and back again.
  As a satire on the manipulation of totally specious ""intell"" in the run-up to the Iraq War, ""Loop"" would make a terrific pairing with Paul Greengrass's ""Green Zone"": the mask of comedy opposite the mask of tragedy.",1283817600,3,957,5.167741935483871

The centerpiece of the film and the show is the profane and manipulative Malcolm Tucker (played ferociously by Peter Capaldi) the Prime Minister's Communications Director/policy enforcer.  He rains down tsunamis of graphic and picturesque verbal abuse on anyone who strays from the Government line and can turn almost any situation to his advantage.  If you're sensitive to profanity and foul language, then this is not the movie for you. If you find imaginative insults hilarious, you're in the right place.  This film and ""The Thick of It"" have a consulting writer whose only job is to add more creative swearing to each script.

The story follows a befuddled government minister (the pitch-perfect Tom Hollander) who inadvertently becomes a spokesman for both the pro-war and anti-war factions in a fictional potential conflict that mirrors (but isn't) the Iraq War. Unlike the TV series we get to see an American contingent which includes James Gandolfini as an anti-war Pentagon general, Mimi Kennedy as a State Dept official and David Rasche in a great performance as a cheerily Machiavellian and puritanical State Dept neo-con. The locations range from London, Washington and New York to a small garden in Northamptonshire. Steve Coogan, who will be familiar (by sight at least) to many American viewers, plays the outraged occupant of this garden.

If you like The Office (UK), The Larry Sanders Show, Curb Your Enthusiasm or other semi-improvised shows, you'll enjoy this. On repeated viewings you might find yourself rewinding particularly hilarious lines several times.

If you're not familiar with non-standard British accents you may need to pop on the subtitles every once in awhile. There are a couple of regional English accents and much of the funniest dialogue is delivered by Malcolm Tucker and his underling Jamie, both of whom have pronounced Scottish accents.",1282089600,7,2268,5.594752186588921
3983868,4,B002T4GXUQ,"To say that I understand everything that went on in this film would be a total lie.  I am not a political person (not in the least) and so I couldn't quite follow everything.  To say that this isn't one of the better satires out there would also be a lie.  I mean, you don't have to be technically politically savvy to understand just what this film stands for and to gather the message it is trying to relay.  In fact, what makes this film all the more funny is that, despite its razor-sharp wit and humor, it comes off extremely honest.

The film basically revolves around a group of people whose political futures are placed on the line when one man makes a poor move and states on public television that a war on the cuffs is `unforeseeable'.  This seemingly small move stirs endless panic as parties from both sides of the political fence (those for and against the war from both the UK and the US) try and spin his words and actions in their favor.  Caught in the middle is Simon Foster, the unlucky man who made the regrettable statement.

With so many serious dramas being created in the light of the Iraq war, it is nice to see some humor tossed its way.  Shot in the familiar `improvised' mode that shows like `The Office' are shot in, `In the Loop' is certainly a unique cinematic experience.  It has flaws, but they are minor really.  In fact, nearly every flaw I can conjure up winds up being yet another reason why I really like this film.  It seems so over the top, yet those aspects of the film really drive it forward for me.  The script is seriously brilliant, delivering sharply crafted lines, one right after the other.  The ending of the film is oddly anti-climactic, but that is such a godsend here, for it adds to the scarily real quality to this film.  It just seems so, honest...even when it is blatantly embellished.

Another major plus here is the acting.

The performances are so sharp, so precise that they fit this mold beautifully.  It reminds me of `Juno' a tad in the way that the performances complemented the script.  `Juno' had a script that was very unrealistic in texture (especially the dialog) and yet it worked remarkably well thanks to the commitment from the actors (that film has certainly grown on me over the past two years).  `In the Loop' is the same in that, without a committed cast, this would have fallen to pieces.  It just wouldn't have worked.  The script is too insanely preposterous (dialog wise) that is wouldn't have worked without dedicated performances that sold you on every word.

Peter Capaldi is a genius with 4-letter words, and while I found his character development to be slightly repressed (as are most characters here, which seem to represent stereotypes within themselves) he nailed everything that was asked of him.  Everyone here is just fantastic, culminating together to create one of the best ensembles of the decade.  I really want to give special attention to Tom Hollander though.  His character (that of Simon Foster) was certainly the most demanding because he is the center of the films entire plot and he thus has to create the most complex character.  He is really the only character with a major arc, beings that he seems to be the only character not defined by a clich (not to say that this is a clich ridden film, for it is a satire that revolves around exploiting clichs).  Using this to his advantage he crafted a character that was just as sharp tongued, but in a more repressed way, and he showed his characters insecurities, fears, bouts of strength and boundless confusion perfectly.  Add to Hollander the likes of James Gandolfini (who is just golden here), Chris Addison, Zach Woods (hilarity; the future Malcolm Tucker) and Mimi Kennedy (the list goes on and on, but who has time to name them all) and you have comedic supremacy.

In the end, I really liked this movie a lot.  It does have its flaws, and at times the narrative does seem to do it a disservice (it feels like a TV show, really) but overall there is no reason anyone should miss this movie; well, unless you are easily offended by verbal vulgarity.  I give it high marks, a B+ if you will, but that's a very, very strong B+.",1281312000,3,4186,4.554812834224599

By taking the position that 'this is so bad, if you don't laugh you'll cry'(coupled with wonderful actors and a great script), this movie effectively allows us to explore the fine line between baby sitting and diplomacy and how personal ambition all too often gets translated into disastrous public policy.  My husband and I watched this movie when it aired on TV and loved it, but knew we were missing some of the dialogue due to the accents (one of the main characters is Scottish).

3983871,2,B002T4GXUQ,"This film was a serious disappointment. In The Loop is a film-length development of the cult British TV series The Thick Of It, which features the daily travails of a hapless government minister and his aides as they spend a large amount of their time battling Malcolm Tucker, the profane and half-insane chief spokesman for the Prime Minister. The episodes are not always funny and can be tough to watch, but they're only half an hour long. This is the first big problem with In the Loop -- while you can survive a half hour dose of The Thick of It, the effect of an hour and 45 minutes is numbing. By the end of the film you're immune to the word play and streams of outrageous language and temper eruptions. You just want the film to end.

  The other major flaw to the movie starts the second the cast leaves the centre of the British government in London and moves to Washington. The makers of the film clearly have no idea how the U.S. system or officials or politician really work and so we have a bunch of characters with American accents, supposedly high up in the U.S. executive branch, acting exactly the same way the British ones do, firing off the same volleys of profanity.

  Lost in all this is the story of how some American officials are pressing for a war in an unnamed Middle Eastern country and the chaos that ensures when a clumsy and not very intelligent British minister and his press aide stumble into the action.

3983874,4,B002T4GXUQ,"I don't know how funny this would be the second or third time around, but it was pretty funny the first.  What we have is the run-up to an invasion of an unnamed Middle Eastern country with the focus on American and Brit governmental operatives as some advance the program and others try to stop it.  It's an over-the-top satirical comedy, a kind of burlesque version of the real run-up prior to the invasion of Iraq.

Tom Hollander stars as a nice boy minister who wants to stop the war train.  Peter Capaldi plays some kind of Brit gov attack dog with a bad case of coprolalia who enjoys nothing more than humiliating subordinates and the occasional Yank as he salivates about the marvelous maiming and killing to come.  David Rasche plays Linton Barwick the American Secretary of...well they don't say, but it would be Defense.  Rasche has the voice and mannerisms of the real Secretary of Defense during the Iraq War (Donald Rumsfeld) down pat.  Rasche's parody of the ultimate micromanaging war-nit was for me the highlight of the movie.

There's a nice comedic take on the relationship between Karen Clarke, who plays an American assistant secretary and her intern played by Anna Chlumsky resulting in a lampoon of polticos running helter-skelter as they go about managing the ship of state.

Everything is lickity-split.  The dialogue comes at you like water from a fire hose, and everybody is just drunk with nerd-gov power.  There is a certain truth behind the sexually demeaning expletives coming out of just about everybody's mouth, revealing a kind of repressed macho that is the dream of persons in positions of petty power.  The script and the improvs by the actors set a new high water mark in the creative use of not only the f-word but in the expression of the myriad ways one can get really hosed in various orifices.

Anyway, ""In the Loop"" is good for a one-time viewing with many laughs and some insight into the stupidities of our glorious leaders and their staffs.

You'll think of this again and again as you watch In The Loop, a biting tale of ego-mania, narcissism, and testosterone in politics.  An extremely foul-mouthed senior Advisor for the British Prime Minister has his hackles raised when a lower-ranking Minister finds a possible war in the Middle East ""unforeseeable.""  But what is unforeseeable is where this slip of the tongue will take the Advisor, the Minister, an assistant Secretary of State, and their respective staffs.  And, I might add, where these behind-the-scenes shenanigans will take both countries.

Are there really politicians like this?  What happens when these loud politicians go home at night?  Do they kick the dog and their children?

Note: Although actor James Gandolfini is given top billing in various displays here, his actual appearance is very brief and inconsequential: One comedy bit and a couple of transitional scenes for other characters.

As advertised, there is a near constant stream of abusive profanity. However, I found it very disappointing because there was no quality, only quantity.  I expected the profanity to play off the immediate situations, showing some imagination. But you could probably do a cut-n-paste between sections of the movie without anyone noticing.

In a scenario that is probably closer to the truth than anyone would ever admit, an unfortunate British undersecretary answers a fairly bland question about the possibility of Mideast war during a radio interview.  An awkward response to that unexpected query triggers a storm of political shenanigans in London and D.C.  Hilarity ensues.  James Gandolfini is the only name actor (for U.S. audiences), and his not-that-hawkish general is a delight to watch.  Peter Capaldi plays the British prime minister's hatchet man with fire and brimstone that is awe inspiring.

3983878,4,B002T4GXUQ,"""In the Loop"" was spun off from the Britcom ""In the Thick of It"", borrowing four of its writers from that television series, but concerns itself exclusively with the run-up to the Iraq War. In London, Minister for International Development Simon Foster (Tom Hollander) declares that ""war is unforeseeable"" in an interview with the press, evoking the near-hysterical fury of the Prime Minister's foul-mouthed Director of Communications Malcolm Tucker (Peter Capaldi), who knows the PM is plotting the invasion of a Middle Eastern nation in cooperation with the United States. In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Karen Clark (Mimi Kennedy) is trying to draw attention to the shaky intelligence behind the proposal, if only she can discover which committee of rival Assistant Secretary Linton Barwick (David Rasche) is pushing the war agenda.

Bureaucrats on both sides of the Atlantic maneuver to find out what is going on behind closed doors and how they might stop it -or at least benefit from it, as it is obvious that 10 Downing Street and the White House have already decided on war. It's a satire of Anglo-American relations, of the petty ambitions and underhanded tactics that shape important policies, and of office politics, as bright and beleaguered assistants tussle with one another to keep their careers alive. The pace is frenetic. The language is colorful. The characters are insufferable. It's hilarious.

No one can match the British at political satire, but behavior has gotten cruder since the dignified doublespeak of ""Yes, Minister"". Everyone is obnoxious. Perhaps it's the influence of reality TV, which also contributes an unsteady camera and quick-cutting. I could have done with less of that. While the sharpest satires distill reality, ""In the Loop""  exaggerates it, which is not quite as clever. But it is very funny, and at some point it engages the viewer emotionally in the matter at stake, though I don't think it ever does in the characters.

First of all, let me just say, Malcolm Tucker.  Remember the ""Blown Away Guy"" ads for Maxell cassettes: a guy in a leather jacket wearing long hair and sunglasses sits in a chair facing a speaker.  His hair and necktie are wind-blown like he's in front of a wind turbine.

That's what it feels like to watch Peter Capaldi play Malcolm in this movie -- he's a torrent of bile.  Malcolm doesn't seem to care if or why we start a war, as long as everyone toes the line.

And for the other reviewers who object to the language in this movie: you know, I HAVE heard cursing in other movies and when it's lazy and done for cursing's sake, it's just boring.  These writers and actors elevate it to an art form.  One of the best jokes in the movie is that the biggest war-monger can't stand foul language.  That one and the line about lubricated horse anatomy.

Of course, the cruelest joke is that most of these political hacks are too busy worrying about moving up the ladder to be concerned whether young kids are going to die in a war (well, except for Simon, and he's still a tool).

3983883,1,B002T4GXUQ,"This film grew out of a TV series here in the UK called 'In the Thick of It', and is basically more of the same. UK critics gave both glowing reviews. They seem to think the swearing is creative. Even if it was, it hardly seems enough on its own to warrant such praise. They also seem to think it's how people behave in the UK civil service/government. They don't. The writer has admitted he guessed. Okay, satire is all about exaggerating behaviours to poke fun at them. But it's very hard to see what basic behaviours are being exaggerated here in the first place. Malcolm is a character who if he existed in real life would be punched in the face every five minutes by anyone he came into contact with.

My current theory as to why this programme/film has been so widely praised in the UK is to do with the fact that we no longer know how to produce sitcoms that people actually laugh at. So instead a new kind of embarrassment-inducing sitcom has taken their place. 'The Office' is the obvious example, a programme that relied heavily on Ricky Gervais basically playing himself - a limitation in range which has become all too apparent since. If anyone in the US is interested in a sitcom about UK politics that is actually closer to the truth while also being - pause to contemplate the sacrilege I'm about to speak - funny, you could check out 'Yes, Minister' and 'Yes, Prime Minister'.",1268006400,16,1392,4.480314960629921

3983885,5,B002T4GXUQ,"The political satire is not dead; it's just been, er, resting ...at least since ""Wag the Dog"" sped in and out of theatres in 1997, barely noticed by all but the film critics. Writer-director Armando Iannucci and co-writers Jesse Armstrong, Simon Blackwell, Ian Martin and Tony Roche (much of the same team responsible for the popular BBC series ""The Thick of It"") have mined the headlines and produced a nugget of pure satirical gold with ""In the Loop""  I daresay that it recalls the halcyon days of Terry Southern and Paddy Chayefsky, whose sharp, barb-tongued screenplays once ripped the body politic with savage aplomb.

When the British Minister for International Development (Tom Hollander) gets tongue-tied during a BBC news interview and blurts out that ""War is unforeseeable"" in response to a question about his stance on a possible U.S. military intervention in the Middle East, it stirs up a trans-Atlantic hullabaloo, as hawks and doves on both sides of the pond scramble to spin his nebulous statement into an endorsement for their respective agendas. When he later attempts to backpedal by adlibbing ""Sometimes, to walk the road of peace, we have to...climb the mountains of conflict"" it raises murderous ire from the Prime Minister's Director of Communications (Peter Capaldi, in an award-worthy turn as a classic Type-A jerk) who tells the minister (amongst other colorful admonishments) that his awkward metaphor made him come off like some kind of ""Nazi Julie Andrews"".

The gaffe-prone minister is given a chance to redeem his now rather precarious career status with a ""fact finding"" visit to D.C., under the watchful eye of Capaldi (""So have you come here to insult me in a different time zone?"" the exasperated minister dryly asks him at one point). Also along for the trip is the minister's ambitious new advisor and chief handler (Chris Addison). They are feted by the dovish Assistant Secretary of Diplomacy (a brilliantly funny Mimi Kennedy) who is desperately trying to keep him from the clutches of the extremely hawkish Assistant Secretary of State (a wry David Rasche) who is like an amalgam of Rumsfeld and Cheney, and of whom Kennedy observes ""...the voices in his head are now singing barbershop together."" Things really get interesting when a vacillating, war-weary general turned desk-bound Pentagon brass (James Gandolfini, refreshing to see in a genuinely comic performance) gets tossed into the mix.

The filmmakers take aim at many targets here, hitting a bull's eye nearly every time; and I guarantee you haven't heard such creatively honed insults and deliciously profane pentameter singsonging from the mouths of thespians since HBO's ""Deadwood"" went dark (or at least since David Mamet last churned out a screenplay). Capaldi's character in particular gets to spout some of the most uproariously clever lines I've heard in any film in years. As for my personal favorite, I'd say that it's a tossup between (a) ""I'm putting you on a probationary period...from today until the end of recorded time"" or (b) ""I will marshal all the media forces of darkness to hound you to an assisted suicide."" Hey, I know what you're thinking...I'm a People Person. Maybe I should go into politics (not!).",1266192000,7,3228,5.09640831758034

One of the wittiest and most sophisticated movie satires of recent vintage, ""In the Loop"" provides us with a hilarious behind-the-scenes glimpse into the ugly, messy world of international diplomacy.  The mad run-up to the Iraq war serves as the obvious blueprint for the fictional - yet far from make-believe - tale the writers have come up with here.  We begin in London where news has just leaked out that the British and Americans are planning a military invasion of an unspecified country in the Middle East.  When the bumbling Minister for International Development, Simon Foster, accidentally goes off script by stating in an interview that such a war is ""unforeseeable,""  the Prime Minister's staff goes into immediate damage control mode, hustling Foster off to Washington D.C. to see if they can get him in on the pre-war planning and negotiations.  From that point on, Foster becomes a bone-of-contention between the pro-war and anti-war factions battling it out for preeminence.

The source for ""In the Loop"" is a popular British TV series entitled ""The Thick of It,"" with many of the actors from that program appearing in the movie (though we're told that most of the performers play different roles in the film from the ones they play on the show).  As if that weren't confusing enough, the script by Jesse Armstrong, Simon Blackwell, Armando Iannucci and Tony Roche spends virtually no time on introductions or back story of any kind, leaving those of us who are unfamiliar with the context feeling just a wee bit lost and disoriented at the beginning.  Indeed, we are plunged so immediately into the swirl of activity surrounding the minister's diplomatic faux pas that we learn early on that we had better start paying some serious attention to what`s happening on screen or risk going under in pretty short order.  I say this not as a criticism of the writing because, frankly, this is one of the few comic scripts I've come across in quite some time that actually treats its audience like thinking adults, that doesn't find it necessary to talk down to us in order to appeal to the lowest-common-denominator viewer.  The one-liners come fast and furious in this film and woe to anyone not willing to make the effort to keep up with them.  The good news is that the writing is so sharp and acerbic that we really don't mind putting that extra added effort into our viewing.  One simply cannot be a passive onlooker while watching ""In the Loop"" and still reap the rewards of the experience.

With the kind of understated irony that distinguishes the best of British humor, the densely-plotted, character-rich screenplay aims its comedic sights at all the would-be power players, petty backbiters, toadying assistants, longsuffering aides, incompetent bureaucrats, draconian bosses, mealy-mouthed office-holders and enraged constituents that make up the world of high-level diplomacy and politics.  The movie also has some fun with England's perceived role as ugly stepsister (or lapdog, if you prefer) to the bully-boy United States in matters of world affairs.

Director Iannucci gets nothing less than a sterling performance from each and every member of his large and gifted cast, be they American (with James Gandolfini the most recognizable face in that crowd) or British.  However, extra special note should be taken of Tom Hollander, Chris Addison, Mimi Kennedy and, above all,  Peter Capaldi, who tears up the screen as the deliciously ill-tempered  and foul-mouthed enforcer for the British Prime Minister.

The truths this allegorical fable reveals about how easy it is to cherry pick evidence to lead a country into war and how hard it is for individuals of goodwill to stand up for what they know is right are so dead-on in their accuracy and so universal in their scope that they leave the mind reeling from the impact - and the ribcage aching from all the laughter.",1264377600,12,3905,4.987673343605547

This may be the most cynical film I've ever seen, which in this case is a plus. One gets the strong feeling that In The Loop is a rather accurate portrayal of the inner working of British and American government, despite the very satiric tone. Egos everywhere and common sense seemingly nowhere; sounds about right.

There are endless f-bombs, so it's not for the kids, but is tailor-made for those intelligent enough to understand how the political world really works. The tinge of unfortunate reality is everywhere; it's every man and woman for themselves, and the vapidity and self-serving nature of career politicians has rarely been so unflinchingly presented on screen.

All the principals are solid, but Capaldi is a standout. Gandolfini is good but needs to play something other than aholes for a change. Mimi Kennedy is another highlight; the entire cast clearly relished playing this dark comedy, and the sharp pace and sharper tone never let up.

It's been a long time since I was this surprised by this many lines in a film--- the biting wit is constant and unstinting. If you enjoy your barbs hard and focused, with geopolitical overtones, this will be about as good as you'll find on the silver screen.

Kudos to the Beeb for funding this. Can't imagine any nationally funded American arts group ever putting something this edgy out there.

Definitely recommended.",1264118400,,1389,4.939914163090129
3983890,4,B002T4GXUQ,"Sharp, funny and highly watchable, IN THE LOOP is a British political satire that imagines a world where manufactured intelligence combines with media (and interpersonal) manipulation to help clear the fictional path toward an invasion of an unnamed Middle-Eastern country.

For me, the movie leans too heavily on Capaldi's trash-talking, proudly Scottish Malcolm Tucker, a character who feels as clich&eacute;d as the overly educated, upper-class English politicians he enjoys berating.  The movie does a great job of showing how star-struck the British contingent are when they get to hobnob with the big boys in Washington DC.  Perhaps the most enjoyable part of the movie when one cabinet minister, played by the familiar-faced Tom Hollander, is forced to juggle the mundane concerns of his local constituents (septic tank problems, a crumbling wall) at the same time as he's participating in discussions that could impact the destiny of the world.  Anna Chlumsky shines as a careerist Washington staffer and James Gandolfini is great as the American general who talks tough as he tries to oppose the march to war.",1264032000,3,1991,6.328413284132841

The Blu quality on the exteriors and wide interiors were solid, and even with some of the close interiors but it was obvious when they changed to certain cameras as some grain was prevalent. The theme grows weary after a bit but fans of this kind of parody will most likely get their money's worth.

* TV spot, 30 second trailer.
* Behind the scenes, 3:16 minutes. An IFC promo that played on the network, shows primarily Gandolfini to probably attract the American audience.

3983899,4,B002T4GXUQ,"""In the Loop"" is a sharp and witty and funny and depressing take on the office politics of politics.  Simon Foster is the ambitious but largely clueless and weak-willed British ""minister for international development.""  When he makes the mistake of suggesting, contrary to the official British position, that an imminent war was ""unforeseeable"" on a BBC radio interview, he is colorfully and harshly reprimanded by the British press secretary who seems incapable of putting three words together without a creative interjection of expletives.  Simon suddenly finds himself in the midst of a power struggle between hawks and doves (both UK and US) and interns and career politicians, some who care about whether the war (ostensibly the war in Iraq, which is never actually mentioned) proceeds and, mostly, others who care more about their own future in politics.  The point is that even when it comes to matters of greatest urgency, the petty and small are never far off.  It's a clever and very funny take on bureaucracy and international politics, that would be even funnier if it weren't so awfully scary.  Shot in the kinetic documentary style made popular on the BBC's Office and its American remake - it may make you dizzy while the wordplay has your head spinning.  Definitely worth watching.
