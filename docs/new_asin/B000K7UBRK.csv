8154658,5,B000K7UBRK,"I bought Rick's Steve's everything - because this first downloadable instant video was soooo informative.  I am a serious traveler but not really a Europe traveler.  I thought I knew everything but this video showed me how many important things I would have forgotten.  Without being a spoiler I will simply say I counted at least ten major things I would have wished I knew about before I left the states - that Rick Steve' talked about in his work.  I liked this video so much I bought all of his instant videos available. Why?

It opened me up to places I thought I would NEVER want to go to-like Istanbul or Portugal.  Now I really want to go to those places and maybe skip a few countries he toured that I am set to travel too.  So with Rick Steve's you truly can tour the world, learn a lot and better plan  travel in general.  In my case, his tips are big enough for me to totally change a destination.

I think his work is also great for shut ins who may never get to go to foreign places - but with Rick Steve's they can!",1440374400,,1030,4.182741116751269

8154661,4,B000K7UBRK,"If this set contained just one useful travel tip, it would have been easily worth the price, and it contained many.  I was very pleased with the purchase.  One item not covered however was how to handle checked baggage on the train.  Rick's philosophy is to travel light, and of course that's a good idea, but sometimes your trip requires a second bag that could not be stowed at your seat.  If he had covered that issue, this would have definitely been a 5 star rating.",1383868800,,470,4.430232558139535
8154662,5,B000K7UBRK,"As with all of the Rick Steves' videos I have seen, this is very concise, informative and entertaining.  If you are planning a trip, not just to Europe, but anywhere really, this video provides very good, down-to-earth tips and information.  I am very pleased with it.",1285113600,4,268,4.804347826086956
8154663,2,B000K7UBRK,"I suppose if I were a fan of the show this would have been interesting, but I've never watched Rick Steves' travel show before so I didn't make it through the whole behind the scenes show before deleting.",1214092800,2,204,4.394736842105263
8154664,5,B000K7UBRK,"Has there ever been another travel guide more amiable, more informative, more eclectic and just plain likeable than Rick Steves? This somewhat nerdish but pleasant looking fellow will immediately win the viewer over with his charm, humor and smoothing, layback manner. However what will keep you watching program after program is his consummate knowledge of the sites and people he visits.

This DVD is a wonderful and valuable addition to the Rick Steves' collection. The `Travel Skills' portion is indispensable for the novice traveler and the `Making Of' and `Steves' Kids' segments are fun and entertaining.",1207526400,5,611,5.364583333333333
8154665,5,B000K7UBRK,We learned alot about what to do and what not to do from this very practical and entertaining video.,1199664000,2,100,4.315789473684211
