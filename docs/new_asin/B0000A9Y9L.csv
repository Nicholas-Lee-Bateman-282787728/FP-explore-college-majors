We've also found that all of this series are shakey.  Something to do with transfering it to digital made the quality diminish.",1125878400,3,387,4.565217391304348
1904512,4,B0000A9Y9L,"We own several Strawberry Shortcake movies, and this is my least favorite.  I moan and groan every time I have to listen to Honey Pie Pony moan and groan and be completely ungreatful, but the point of the story is to appreciate your friends which she does figure out by the end.  Otherwise another cute addition to the Strawberry Shortcake collection.  My 3 year-old daughter, just loves to watch all of them and I like them because all the caracters speak kindly, help one another, and there aren't any scary parts, so unlike many other options out there.",1106784000,3,556,4.653061224489796
1904513,5,B0000A9Y9L,"When Honey Pie Pony hurts her leg, she must miss out on a great adventure and stay in bed.  Despite the moans and groans of this demanding patient, Strawberry Shortcake and her friends Angel Cake, Ginger Snap, Orange Blossum and Huckleberry Pie nurse Honey back to good health and good nature.  Scenes include HAVE A GOOD TRIP, IMAGINATION, GETTIN BETTER BOOGIE, and HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.  My preschooler and toddler are captivated by this DVD and request it so often I have learned some of the lines from the puppet show and my husband started singing the catchy gettin better boogie song!  The story line is sweet without being too saccharine.  We definitely plan to buy some of the other Strawberry Shortcake DVDs.",1094515200,5,715,4.733870967741935
1904514,5,B0000A9Y9L,This movie is so much fun it had my day care kids up and dancing to the great new Berry Tunes. It teaches kids to help others and that friends are important. Follows in the Berry tradition. Watch the music video allthe kids just love it.,1066176000,10,237,4.173913043478261

7996519,2,B0000A9Y9L,"I should have paid attention to the reviews. My daughter really likes Strawberry Shortcake and has really enjoyed most of the DVDs from this version of Strawberry Shortcake. (She's not crazy about the new Strawberry Shortcake show that's on HUB right now.)  However, after about 15 minutes of this DVD, she stopped watching and told me she wasn't interested in it.  She said that Honey Pie was annoying and that it was ""totally boring and annoying.""",1334880000,,449,4.894736842105263
7996520,5,B0000A9Y9L,This was a great addition to my daughters movie collection. She loves anything dealing with strawberry shortcake and she watches them all the time!!,1325289600,,148,5.208333333333333
7996521,2,B0000A9Y9L,"Poor Strawberry.. she is such a sweet kid, but the horse's whining and grouching overpowers this whole movie.  My daughter doesn't like this Strawberry Shortcake movie as much as she likes the others.",1296000000,,200,5.0606060606060606
7996522,3,B0000A9Y9L,"My 4.5 year old daughter has a lot of Strawberry Shortcake dvds and for whatever reason, this one wasn't as interesting for her.",1276300800,,128,4.608695652173913
7996523,2,B0000A9Y9L,"The lesson in this story (by the end) is to appreciate your friends. They do a HORRIBLE job of depicting this. Instead you get the feeling that the message is to ""whine until you get your way"" or ""give someone that whines anything they want."" My husband refuses to let my daughter watch this movie. Honey Pie is whiney and really needs to get the treatment that race horses get when they hurt their leg.",1182211200,3,403,4.386666666666667
7996524,5,B0000A9Y9L,I bought it for my niece and she simply loved it!!! highly recommended. Both English and Spanish languages available!!,1168300800,,118,5.2631578947368425
