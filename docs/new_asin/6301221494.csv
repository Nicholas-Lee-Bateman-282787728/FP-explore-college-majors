325921,5,6301221494,"This is pure, undiluted, un-Thalberg'd Marx Brothers - every bit as insane and convulsively funny as Duck Soup! Higher Education is the target here with the major salvo being the prostitution of education to the financial  gain of a winning sports team (the fact that Harpo and Chico, let alone two  gangster thugs, can play on a college football team no-questions-asked  shows a brilliant mind for social satire).  The film is packed with classic  Marx routines:  Groucho's singing and dancing ""I'm Against It,""  The Speak-easy & ""Swordfish,"" Harpo's dog-catching &  catch-all drawer pockets (which seem bottomless); Thelma Todd as the  College Widow and the parade of suitors in and out of her room (with more  well timed slamming doors than a Feydeau farce) and the endless funny  lines.  Chico has never been in finer form with his fractured  ""Italian"" and entertaining piano playing.  As to Harpo's recital  of ""Everyone Says I Love you"", a personal story:  When I first  saw this film in the 70s at Indiana University, the hall was packed with  over 800 people.  When Harpo finished playing ""Everyone Says I Love  You,"" 800 arose and gave a standing ovation to a musical number over  forty years old and a clown who had been dead for a decade.  The film was  freeze-framed until the applause died down and that took nearly fifteen  minutes! It was a moment of Everyone saying we love you, too.  This film is  a keeper!",939772800,11,1424,4.804979253112033
325922,5,6301221494,"Yes, back in the 30s the Marx brothers made the cover of Time magazine.  And the movie still that was placed there was from Horse Feathers.  And with good reason -- this is the best Marx film of the thirteen.
It's an  absolute shame that a full version of this movie does not exist.  Apparently sometime in the 60s, the movie was released to TV, and in the  interest of time considerations some of the major negative was altered and  eventually lost.  We are told that there is from three to ten minutes of  the film that cannot be found.  What a pity!  This is a movie that you  never want to end.  Any additional minutes would be manna from Marx  heaven.
You will also notice some film ""jumping"" in the  ""make out scene"" with Thelma Todd.  These are poor splices that  have been made over time, but do not detract from the final masterpiece  that is Horse Feathers.

Every Marx fan has a favorite movie of theirs; HORSE FEATHERS (1932) is mine.

Ably directed by Norman MacLeod, the screenplay is by S.J. Perelman and Will Johnstone, plus songwriters Bert Kalmer and Harry Ruby, who also contribute two of the brothers' best tunes. Groucho shines on both of these.

""Whatever It Is, I'm Against It"" is the famous number where newly appointed president Quincy Wagstaff is introduced to Huxley College, backed by a mortarboard and robe-clad faculty. It briefly segues into ""I Aways Get My Man.""

The film's musical highlight, ""Everyone Says I Love You"" is performed by all four brothers: a straight rendering by Zeppo, a harp solo, Chico's energetic vocal over piano with humorous lyrics, and a languid Groucho serenading with guitar for ""college widow"" Thelma Todd as she gently rows their small boat. His first verse suggests Miss Todd has ulterior motives in being with him. This sequence, which ends with a quacking duck, is my all-time favorite Marx moment.

Much of Prof. Wagstaff's anatomy class lecture is from ""Home Again,"" a vaudeville act written for them by Uncle Al Shean that was based on their ""Fun In Hi Skule"" skit. Another recycling of old material is Harpo's cleavering a deck of cards in half. This is from their first Broadway show, ""I'll Say She Is.""

Other famous sequences: the speakeasy ""swordfish"" password routine, a merry chase in Miss Todd's bedroom, and the comic football game. A photo taken during work on the latter appeared as a 1932 TIME magazine cover. Chico was at that time recovering from a severe knee injury; he's clearly hobbling in these scenes.

326001,4,6301221494,"Don't watch HORSE FEATHERS expecting anything like a coherent plot, developed characterization or sophisticated filming technique.  Shot on a shoestring by Paramount, with more than its fair share of stock footage, it has the feel of a quickie; a more up-market version of the Hal Roach two-reelers that were released at the same time with Laurel and Hardy.  On the other hand HORSE FEATHERS does preserve for posterity some of the Marx Brothers' finest routines.  Groucho has never been better as a crazy professor charged with the responsibility of rescuing a poor school; his dialog fairly crackles with one-liners, and he is a past master at handling mock-love scenes.  Harpo has his fair share of visual set-pieces, notably when he leads a police officer a merry dance in and around his dog-catcher's van.  He also has the chance for one of his harp solos.  Chico enjoys himself most during a speakeasy scene, when he and the other two brothers have great fun with the so-called 'secret' password.  He gets to play the piano in another specialty number.  The ending is a bit weak, with a crazy football game stretching the audiences' credibility to the limit, but all in all the film is great fun; the humor stands up well eight decades later.",1390262400,,1248,4.85377358490566

326047,5,6301221494,"1932 has come and still the same depression and still the lack of whisky or bourbon and still the methylated spirit of moonshine trafficking on the telephone. So just invest, or dump, the four Marx brothers in a good college that is lying flat on its back in spite of all the varnish and inflating they have been doing with hot air and filling beans and you can greet the great implosion of the intellectual effete hormones of the middle-aged menopausal college professors and college widows and the latter's mafia beaus and college gigolos. But the speakeasy methylated whisky deliverer and his good friend the dog-catcher are better footballers than they are football player kidnappers. Though as for escaping from their locked rooms by sawing the floor around themselves they do better than any carpenter would do. What is surprising is how the Marx brothers are trying to confuse us with their symbolic subliminal innuendo that everyone feels and no one understands. Who knows that 42 is Solomon's number multiplied by the holy week, six times seven? Who knows that Harpo's swordfish is the flaming sword of some archangel in Genesis, the flaming sword that is the verb of God in the Old Testament's prophets sheathed upside down, outside in into a good old fish probably caught by Peter-Simon the fisherman and multiplied by Jesus? And we could go on like that for pages. Every single detail is ambiguous, meaningful but everything is said so fast, too fast, so that we hardly can follow the meaning of all these expectorations. And you jump from the ""falsetto"", or is it ""false set o' toes"" to a ""false set o' teeth"", a toe for a tooth, let's toe the line, tiptoe the mark that leads to the famous lex talionis. But what brass neck this Chico has who is playing the piano all the time as if he were on a music hall stage! What contumelious behavior this Harpo has who is constantly playing the harp, but is he really or is he alone! What bumptious chutzpah this Groucho has who is for the first time ever playing the guitar and throws it away to the ducks in the lake! And that is no wise quack from him even if it is a not so wise quack from the duck. And animal are thus constantly sprouting up in the language, a hog hugs a pig that picks a fight at once. Or some police dog ends up for sale in the dog catcher's van, who wanted to give a ticket to Harpo for blocking the traffic when he was only feeding and resting his horse. And I will not comment upon the football match that is won by the losers because they get loose on the rules and cheat openly. And that will end with the lurid scene of the college widow shifting her loyalties from the local mafioso and the smooth looking Zeppo to the triad of Harpo, Chico and Groucho in a polygamous marriage. That's what I would call a deep dive they will take all together on top of the widow after a high soar to a winning score, and the sore is for all of them who will be sorry to have ever come to that Huxley College that has little to do with any Brave New World. But they might sorely consider they have had some fun.

326048,5,6301221494,"Horse Feathers stars the four Marx Brothers; and they carry this film like the champs they still remain. Thelma Todd plays the college widow with sophistication; her sense of timing during the comedy scenes equals that of the four Marx Brothers. The plot moves along at a good pace and there are plenty of laughs for everyone.

The action begins with Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff (Groucho Marx) becoming president of Huxley College. Wagstaff disapproves of his son running around with the college widow Mrs. Bailey (Thelma Todd); and unbeknownst to anyone Mrs. Bailey is in cahoots with her real boyfriend Mr. Jennings (David Landau) and Darwin University. Jennings wants to get the football signals from Huxley University so that once again Huxley will lose a college football game; that way Jennings's bet that Darwin will win the football game will pay off handsomely.

Of course, from there on in it's anybody's guess what happens next. Will Wagstaff ever find out the real reason Connie Bailey is after him AND his son? Will Wagstaff be able to correct his mistake when he finds out he recruited the wrong two men to win the football game? Sure, he recruited two men--Pinky (Harpo Marx) and Baravelli (Chico Marx), but he was supposed to recruit two other young brutes. The young brutes play for the opposing Darwin University team to get the team to victory and let Jennings win his bet. How will Huxley University win the game after Pinky and Baravelli are taken hostage by the two brutes sent into the Darwin team to help fix the game?

There is something potentially controversial thing about this film. Paramount was apparently desperate to have singing and dancing in it. Therefore you get several song and dance numbers that push the limits; poor Wagstaff (Groucho) has to sing a song as the movie opens. It's a very funny song; but Groucho Marx couldn't sing. Baravelli has a short musical number with the widow Bailey at the piano and Pinky (Harpo) magically finds a harp sitting conveniently just outside the widow Bailey's window so he can serenade her. In addition, you need to suspend belief somewhat because Zeppo plays Wagstaff's son, even though in real life Zeppo Marx was only 11 years younger than his brother Groucho. Sigh. They do try hard and it's a very funny movie so I'll overlook these issues and give the movie five stars anyway. I laughed a lot!

Overall, this movie is a must have for Marx Brothers fans; and anyone who likes screwball comedies from the 1930s will cherish this one for years to come. If anyone says you should skip this movie, ignore their advice!

Groucho et al remain horn and painted moustache above their peers with the only type of shtick that consistently holds up in our new century. Horse Feathers, like Duck Soup, is timeless due to the volcanic creativity of its dialogue. Groucho's cranial word play is an asset which he brings into his every scene appearance. Yes, Chico and Harpo are quite good, but Groucho is absolutely exquisite. I was surprised by how many times I laughed aloud during these seventy minutes. The spin on college and football, while rather superficial, remain fresh on the ear.

Also, he goes to a speakeasy to enlist the help of two men to make the football team better than any other. Instead, he enlists Chico and Harpo which wreaks havoc on the school. Goodbye books, goodbye plot, goodbye sanity; the Marx Brothers are here!

It's my favorite film of these guys.

Perhaps no film has so many of the above-listed descriptions, in spades, as this one does. It just leaves you shaking your head. Some of the lines in here are some of the best I've ever heard and some of the scenes and jokes are the dumbest I've ever seen. One thing for sure: they come at you at a machine-gun pace. You barely have time to digest what you just saw and heard and there's another joke coming at you. You can barely keep up with it all. The football scenes at the end of the film are the most outrageous I have ever seen. They, like much of the movie, have to be seen to be believed. Yes, the latter is a little too ridiculous but, hey, that''s the Marx Brothers.

The only breaks from the non-stop jokes comes when one of the brothers decides to sing a song or play the piano or harp. Those tunes are so-so. The long harp solo by Harpo is too long. I read once where the brothers were opposed to having that in this movie...and they were proved right; it didn't fit.

Groucho says one of my favorite puns ever in this movie.  While speaking about geography, he mentions the Alps and says, ""The Lord Alps those who Alps themselves."" D-ohhhhh.

This movie reminds me of when the 3 Stooges played football, except the Marx Brothers are even more chaotic about it.  Despite professor wagstaff not being a player in any way, shape, or form, with no uniform on, he waltzes on the field and knocks people down.  Harpo drives a horse and cart onto the field too.

Chico and his richly comedic language are always good, and I've even grown to like most of Harpo's antics, but somehow, when you put everything together, I'm left shaking my head every so often.  I think the main obstacle in my enjoyment of a movie like this is the lack of continuity in the story.  Most of the time, the plot is no more than incidental to the comedy.  They certainly don't make movies like this anymore, so I have a hard time getting into the proper Marx Brothers mindset.

In Horse Feathers, Groucho plays Professor Waxhaw, the new president of Huxley College; his son (played by Zeppo) is following in the family footsteps of concentrating on a college widow when he should be concentrating on more important things - such as football.  Professor Waxhaw decides that the Huxley team simply must beat Darwin, its primary rival.  He takes his son's advice and hires a couple of football players who hang out at the speakeasy - well, actually he really recruits Chico and Harpo.  Waxhaw also takes an active approach to teaching, and his takeover of the anatomy class makes for the funniest scene in the film (it degenerates into a spitball fight).  All the guys hit on the widow woman Waxhaw's son is stuck on, not knowing she (Thelma Todd) is in cahoots with the Darwin team and is trying to steal Huxley's football signals.  After a most unsuccessful attempt by Chico and Harpo to kidnap Darwin's two best players, we get to the big game.  Picture this: Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo all out there on the field - you can imagine the high strangeness and hilarity to be found here.

It's hard for me to evaluate this film.  On the one hand, I can see that it is classic Marx Brothers, with one-liners, jokes, gags, songs, dances, the works.  On the other hand, I sit here and wonder why I didn't find this film funnier than I did.  I almost feel like I'm doing something wrong by not enjoying Horse Feathers more than I do.",1094256000,3,2204,4.49748743718593
326075,5,6301221494,"For years, ""Duck Soup"" (1933) and ""A Night at the Opera"" (1935) have competed for the title of Best Marx Brothers Film. However, it is ""Horse Feathers"" (1932) that deserves the honor. Directed in appropriately ramshackle fashion by Norman Z. McLeod, this Depression-era satire features Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo at their musical-comedy zenith. In terms of pacing, ""Horse Feathers"" is the only Marxian effort that takes off from the starting gate and never lets up  no lengthy introductions, delayed entrances or disappointing climaxes. It's a fast and furious romp that should be viewed more than once, especially if you want to catch all of Groucho's classic dialogue. (Unfortunately, a few minutes of risque material involving Harpo and Thelma Todd were excised for television and have yet to see the light of day. One hopes that MCA will restore the deleted footage for its DVD reissue.)",1093737600,4,896,5.136986301369863
326076,5,6301221494,"A previous reviewer asked this question, and I must say it's something I've always wondered about myself.  But it doesn't really matter.  In this sublimely funny film Groucho is Professor Wagstaff, newly-appointed head of Huxley College.  Zeppo is his son (""your mother and I wanted children.  Imagine our disappointment when you arrived.""), who tells his father that Huxley needs a better football team.  So Groucho goes to a speakeasy to buy a couple of professional football players.  Here he meets Chico and Harpo and mistakes them for the pros he's looking for,and engages them to play for Huxley.  Soon all four of the Marx Brothers are romancing Connie Barnes, the College Widow,(ravishing Thelma Todd) whose gangster boyfriend wants the rival college Darwin to win the match. The whole film is packed with laughs.  It includes my all-time favourite scene in any Marx Brothers comedy, when a tramp comes up to Harpo and says ""can you help me out?  I want to get a cup of coffee"" and Harpo takes a steaming cup of coffee out of his pocket and gives it to him.  And then there's the scene with the swordfish, and the bit with the seal, and the ice, and when Groucho and Thelma Todd go out in a boat, and all four marx Brothers singing 'everyone says I love you' to the widow, and the climatic scene at the football match, and - oh just take your pick, every scene is wonderful.

326099,5,6301221494,"Although I can't give this film anything else than a perfect five, I am disappointed with this release. I shelled out a small fortune to buy this on eBay, and it looks like it was transferred over from a VHS tape! Artisan and Universal need to get their act together. The Marx Brothers made five films with them: The Cocoanuts, Monkey Business, Animal Crackers, Horse Feathers, and Duck Soup. I think that The Cocoanuts and Monkey Business could easily fit onto one disc, and Animal Crackers, Horse Feathers, and Duck Soup could fit easily on another, with spare room for extra features.

Although I paid an arm and a leg for this disc, I am glad to have it. It does run like a VHS tape, though. When I stuck it into my DVD player, it automatically played a copyright protection warning and after a few seconds of blackness, it went to the Universal intro and then it played the full movie. There are scene selections, but you just press skip on your remote, since there is no concrete main menu. Universal doesn't have any plans to re-release this, but I really hope they change their minds. The film is excellent; this release is not.",1043625600,15,1136,4.541463414634146

I loved the part when Harpo rode away in a garbage bin like a Roman charioteer. Groucho of course got the lead. His ridiculous song about commenced it and being against it was stunning... if not stunning, aggravating. Gets into your head and sings itself over and over like a broken phonograph.
The college widow was a weirdo. Wonder what Zeppo saw in her. Whatever is a college widow, anyway?
Well, I'm off to review something a bit more dramatically stable. But see this movie anyway.",1031184000,2,701,4.661290322580645
326101,5,6301221494,"If I had to recommend one flick out of the Marx cannon (an impossible task, I admit) this is the one. Sure, The Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers opened the door for the Marxes in Hollywood and Duck Soup and A Night At The Opera are considered the peak of their talents. But everyone dwells on those. For my money, start to finish, Horse Feathers never lets you down. Whether its the ""Swordfish"" hijinks of the speakeasy scene, Groucho's musical opener ""Whatever It Is, I'm Against It"" or the four Marxes doing their own unique takes on ""Everybody Says I Love You"", there isn't a dull moment in the film.
After producer Irving Thalberg died, Zeppo left the act and Chico's gambling debts began to climb, most of the later Marx brother flicks settled for and suffered from poor scripts and the padding of those dreary romantic subplots. The Marxes still had some great years after this one. But not many. Check it out!
On a side note, blonde knockout Thelma Todd does her usual screwball best with the Marxes as The College Widow. Sadly, only a few years later, she'd be found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning (one of Hollywood's more infamous unsolved deaths). It's too bad...with her comedic roles in the early thirties, Thelma's career was taking off and she could've been one of Hollywood's greatest starlets if her life hadn't been cut short.",1030838400,2,1343,4.719148936170213
326102,5,6301221494,"To be perfectly honest, there isn't a great deal of difference in quality between the various films the Marx Brothers made at Paramount:  all of them are comic masterpieces.  My only regret with this one (as with MONKEY BUSINESS) is the lamentable absence of Margaret Dumont, whose love scenes with Groucho are among my favorite comic moments in all of cinema.  Thelma Todd does her best in this one as the ""College widow,"" but she just isn't a replacement for Ms. Dumont.
Does plot matter in a Marx Brothers film?  Not much.  In this case, Groucho is the new college president of Huxley College, and is simultaneously concerned to wean his son (played by Zeppo) from the college widow and build up the Huxley College football team.  To accomplish the latter, he goes to a speakeasy to recruit a couple of first rate football players, and mistakenly signs up Chico and Harpo instead.  The plot gives pretty of room for one outrageous skit after another.
Thelma Todd, of course, died three years after this film in what is, to this day, one of the most controversial deaths in Hollywood history.  She was found dead in her garage of carbon monoxide poisoning, but given that she was involved with some pretty unsavory characters at the time, there has always been widespread speculation that she was murdered.  She was only thirty when she died.  At the time of her death, she was one of the busiest actresses in Hollywood.  In addition to HORSE FEATHERS, she also appeared in the Marx Brothers' MONKEY BUSINESS.",1027728000,8,1511,4.75095785440613
326103,4,6301221494,"I had a professor in college who seemed to base his entire teaching style off of Groucho Marx's character in HORSE FEATHERS.  And, yes, it was one of the more amusing set of classes that I took in my time at university.  So, any time I want to relive a more surreal version of my undergraduate learning years, I simply have to throw this DVD into my player and get set for 68 minutes worth of hilarity.
While DUCK SOUP may the best known of the Marx Brothers' films, I think that HORSE FEATHERS may actually be the better introduction to show to someone unfamiliar with their material.  It's a short, snappy, quick film, the musical numbers are quite funny and the gags are classic Marx Brothers material.  Groucho Marx the professor is here, as are Chico and Harpo as a pair of delinquent, accidental, and almost middle-aged students.  Zeppo makes a brief appearance as Groucho's son and barely appears in the second half of the film.  It has all the elements of the standard Marx Brothers film, but it doesn't feel tired or clich&eacute;d.
Naturally, the Marx Brothers themselves are as hilarious as ever.  The only real secondary character of note is played by Thelma Todd, who, unfortunately, has a much weaker and smaller role than she did in MONKEY BUSINESS.  Still, it's fun to see the ubiquitous scenes of different Marx brothers all trying to get the blonde (and in the end, of course, they all do).  The rest of the characters are the collection of gangsters, idiots and straight-men that we come to expect (and then forget about) from the various Marx Brothers pictures.  They have their part to play in the plot, which is really only an excuse for there to be an actual story for the brothers to subvert.  The other people exist only so that they can have various Marxs running hilarious rings around them.
The DVD itself looks about as good as you'd expect a film of that age to look like.  There are some strange jumps in the film, as though someone along the line had cut out a remark or two.  I understand that this is due to problems with the surviving print of the movie rather than any fault of the DVD itself, so it doesn't really seem fair to complain about it.  The extras are few and far between; in fact, there aren't any extras at all.  It's just a bare-bones release with nothing other than the film included.  Of course, when you've got a film that's as much fun as HORSE FEATHERS is, who needs extras?",1019174400,10,2429,4.511415525114155
326104,3,6301221494,"There are some amusing moments in this film, but it seems badly dated to me.  While Groucho is extremely funny at times, Harpo and Chico seem like products of a bygone era when dopey ethnics and soulful mutes represented the apex of comic invention.  I smile whenever I see Groucho on screen, but those other two just don't do a thing for me.",1013299200,,342,4.412698412698413
326105,5,6301221494,"It is a mistake I think, admittedly easy to make, to consider the Marx Brothers to be postmodern comedians.  Indeed, there is a moment in ""Horse Feathers"" (1932) where Chico has started to play the piano and Groucho turns to the camera and tells the audience that while he is stuck listening to this there is no reason they cannot go to the lobby until this whole thing blows over.  Rather than explaining this as an example of self-reflexivity, characters in a movie aware they are in a movie being watched by an audience, I think the fact the Marx Brothers were raised and educated in vaudeville offers a simpler and more accurate explanation.  Similarly, their insistence on destroying the existing order wherever they find it, whether it be a college classroom or a local speakeasy, is symptomatic of anarchy rather than an instantiation of Fukyuama's declaration of ""the end of history.""
Postmodernism is based on metonymic order, syntagmatic combinations involving a perception of contiguity which can generate metonym (naming an attribute or adjunct of the thing instead of the thing itself, e.g. ""crown"" for royalty) or synecdoche (naming the part for the whole, e.g., ""keels"" for ships).  However, when it comes to tropes and other figures of speech, the Marx Brothers simply resort to puns, eschewing even the Modernist notion of metaphoric order.  If Groucho, as President of Huxley College needs to stamp a document with a seal, Harpo brings him a real live seal that the boys can chase around the room.  Still, the Marxes can be literal, but only when the situation does not demand it: Harpo cannot speak (itself a telling indictment of conventionality and propriety), but can still communicate the secret password ""swordfish"" to gain entrance to a speakeasy and can respond with to requests to cut the cards or to help someone get a cup of coffee with more speed than a Groucho zinger.
For the Marx Brothers the messenger is more important than the message.  Note with care that the boys are at Huxley College, whose chief rival is Darwin.  Clearly, while Darwin first articulated the theory of evolution and the idea of survival of the fittest, the Marxes side with Huxley, who popularized those theories and made them palatable to the masses.  Of course, there is also an implicit tribute to Huxley, who got off one of the great academic one-liners of all time in his infamous debate with Bishop Wilberforce over evolution.  Within this Darwinian context the film's climax, taking place in a football game between the two aforementioned schools, becomes a pointed refutation of the idea human beings have evolved too far beyond our brutish ancestors.  Of course, this is open to debate since the negotiated meaning we can draw from the text does not necessarily subvert the dominant meaning; unfortunately, this opens up the possibility of the film's oppositional meaning and once we get into the notion of subverting the text in anything involving the Marx Brothers academic towers start developing foundational cracks.  Nor do we want to consider the implications of Groucho's character being named Wagstaff from a Freudian let alone a Darwinian (or even Marxist) perspective.
This is not to say the Marx Brothers are not ahead of their time, ironically in their support of consumerism.  We have one of the earliest examples of product placement when Connie Bailey (Thelma Todd), the college widow involved with Zeppo, falls into the lake while canoeing with Groucho and makes the mistake of asking him for a ""life saver.""  Amazingingly prescient regarding the harms of tobacco smoking, they undercut the mentioning of a popular cigarette by turning its slogan into a pun: ""I'd walk a mile for a caramel.""  Who knows how many young people have seen this film over the years and decided to consume mass quantities of chocolate instead of smoking harmful cigarettes?  This is a number, I truly believe, that cannot be accurately calculated. Indeed, we should not even try.
""Horse Feathers"" is a second tier Marx Brothers comedy, below the sacred trinity of ""Animal Crackers,"" ""Duck Soup"" and ""A Night at the Opera,"" which still makes it a great comedy.  It marks the second time that a film script was written for the brothers from scratch, rather than being adapted from a successful Broadway stage show.  ""Horse Feathers"" was written by S.J. Perelman, Bert Kalmar, Harry Ruby, Will B. Johnstone, and Arthur Sheekman (uncredited) and directed by Norman McLeod, who had worked with the brothers the year before with ""Monkey Business,"" and who managed to direct a football film ""Touchdown"" in the interim period.  Although the film does have its mundane moments, mostly involving everyone's attempt to court the college widow, the speakeasy scene is an absolute gem and the football game makes for a grand finale.",1009843200,7,4828,5.004993757802747

It's a shame this movie isn't longer. This kind of film will cheer you up if you had a bad day. If you ever do, watch this film. It's bound to make you chortle. However, in one part of the movie, when the brothers go over to Thelma Todd's house, the film in various points jumps ahead. For instance when Groucho and Zeppo are going to leave Todd's house (Groucho stays), Groucho kicks Zeppo, than the next frame Groucho runs to the window. Try to keep up with it if you can at that point. Than there are all of these film scratches and huge bars on the screen on every frame at one point.

326107,5,6301221494,"I love this movie. There is minimal singing and dancing here, the only unbearable points being whenever Zeppo starts singing to Thelma Todd in his gimpy voice. Groucho for some reason is made a president of a university in this film, and he is as would be expected incredibly inadequate, and causes plenty of mayhem. Chico is a dopey Italian as usual, Harpo plays a dog catcher. Hoping to gain respect for his school, Groucho tries to hire football players, and accidentally hires Chico and Harpo, who have very funny moments in this film, particularly in the class room scene. Although people must have thought Harpo's love interest of horses in the first few films to be silly, imagine how it might be percepted these days, especially after movies like ""The Animal"".
  A great movie, funny stuff, plenty of wit and humor. The movie seems to end pretty badly though, and I guess the writers couldn't find a good way to end it. I love the music though, all the brothers get to sing or play, and Groucho shows that he had a good knack for the guitar. Oh yeah, and Thelma Todd is nice to look at. Where do you think the drink ""Hot Toddie"" got it's name?
  A last note: in 1932, when this movie was made, a book called Brave New World"" by Huxley came out, and concerned a mutated futuristic species of sorts. Darwin wrote the theory of evolution, as a lot of people know. The schools Huxley and Darwin compete in the film. See the underlying theme of conflicting theories? Well....it's there.",1007683200,19,1489,4.5655430711610485
326138,5,6301221494,"""Horse Feathers"" released in 1932, is the Marx Bros. fourth film, and the second consecutive one without the illustrious Margaret Dumont. Thelma Todd reprises her role as a suductive vamp, as she had played in ""Monkey Business"". And all four Marx Bros. have a field day poking fun of higher education.
In this film, Groucho plays Quincy Adams Wagstaff, newly elected president of Huxley College. The first indication we have that Groucho does not take the role seriously is when he lights a cigar, strictly against the rules of the college. He then breaks out in song, singing, ""Whatever it is, I'm Against it"".
Groucho's interests lie with football, rather than education itself. Hearing that two really good football players are regulars at a speakeasy, Groucho visits the establishment, hoping to sign them on before the rival college, Darwin, beats him to the punch.
Chico and Harpo happen to be there as well. Chico plays Baravelli, an ice man who sells liqour on the side. Harpo plays Pinky, a dog catcher. Groucho asks them if they are regulars in the bar, and if they play football. They go along with Groucho, assenting to each question. That's all Groucho needs to hear. He immediately enrolls them in Huxley College so they can play on the team.
Groucho also has another purpose. Zeppo, playing Groucho's son in this film, Frank, has been neglecting his studies by pursuing interest in the college widow, Connie Bailey, played by Thelma Todd. She is working for the rival college, Darwin, and is using Zeppo to get the football signals. Groucho is determined to break the two apart, not because she is using him, of course, but to obtain her affection for himself.
There are many hilarious highlights to ""Horse Feather"". One highlight is when Chico and Harpo attend a biology class, escorted by Groucho. ""Have they started sawing the woman in half yet?"" Groucho asks the teacher. Chico and Harpo leaves some fruit on the teachers desk before they take their seats, as though they were little children. Groucho soon takes over the class from the teacher, pointing to a chart with the human body. Harpo sneaks up and places a picture of a horse over the chart, and then a pin up calendar. After Groucho tells him he can't burn the candle at both ends, Harpro immediately produces, from his bottomless pocket, a candle that happens to be burnung at both ends. The scene ends with Chico and Harpo shooting peas at Groucho. Not wanting to be outdone, Groucho joins in, having his own pea shooter tucked away.
Another highlight is when Groucho goes to Connie Bailey's room, attempting to persuade her to stop seeing his son. Before he knows it, he is sitting on her lap saying, ""I could sit here all day if you didn't get up."" Zeppo enters, and Groucho takes the offense, angry to see his son in a disgraceful postion. Zeppo leaves, and Harpo re-enters with a block of ice. The ice is used merely as a pass, or excuse, to gain enterance, and is quickly tossed out the window. When he leaves, Chico appears with a block of ice.  They go back and forth, getting more ice so they may enter the room to ""show their affection"" to Connie, leaving Groucho with little time to make his own advances.  Groucho's reply to this is, ""This must be the main highway"".
The climax of the film is the football game, where the Marx Bros. perform more of their hilarous antics. Groucho, after realizing the two real football players he was intending to sign are playing for Darwin, plans for Chico and Harpo to kidnap them. But their scheme backfires, and it becomes Chico and Harpo who are the victims of kidnapping. The two must find a way to escape before the start of the football game. When they do, Harpo makes his grand enterance on the field riding a chariot, and throwing banana peels in front of players, who stumble over them. Even Groucho joins the team on the field.
""Horse Feathers"" follows a procession of what is considered the best and funniest of the Marx Bros. films. The material is still fresh and raw, unlike in later films. The Marx Bros. are allowed freedom to do as they please, without being constrained to remembering the correctness of their lines. Adlibs are frequent, which only seem to frustrate the director, producer and writers of the film. The audience, however, is delighted, and could care less. We are much happier to see the boys working off each other, rather than what the writers have written. And the finished product succeeds as a result.",1005955200,7,4468,4.71227621483376

326147,4,6301221494,"In my own personal opinion is you were to look at any Marx Brother film just based on the story,you'd say NOTHING makes sense! But that was the charm of their movies. The crazy antics they played on each other and the  other characters involved. This is my favorite film by them! I'd seen it  years before when I was younger and loved it even then. My favorite moments  are when Groucho sings ""Whatever it is I'm against It"". And the  scene in the speakeasy. Groucho asks the bartender if he could break a  check for 15 dollars and 22 cents. The bartender gives him the  change,Groucho quickly takes the money and says ""As soon as I get a  check for 15 dollars and 22 cents I'll send it to you! Swordfish!"" And  runs out!",948153600,3,721,4.288888888888889
