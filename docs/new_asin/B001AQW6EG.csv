3464440,1,B001AQW6EG,"I bought this for my 6 year old niece. I was excited to gift this to her after reading all the positive reviews.  Unfortunately,  this dvd is anything BUT exciting. It's outdated,  poor quality, bad music and gymnastics equipment is needed for more than half of the routines! My niece REALLY wanted to like this dvd-however, it was so boring she could hardly sit through it. Wish I would have bought her a better gift.",1421020800,,418,4.546666666666667

3464442,4,B001AQW6EG,"Good product, no complaints.  It is what it says it is.  Very basic and easy to learn.  Daughter loved it.",1387324800,,106,4.2
3464443,3,B001AQW6EG,"This is an informative dvd, with lots of helpful information.  However, it's not really suitable for use as a dvd for a child to use when practicing at home.  (It also specifically states at the end of the dvd that gymnastics should only be done in the gym!)  In order to follow along at home, your child would definitely need a bar and beam, at least.

I found it a bit dated-looking, and not particularly ""fun"" or inspiring for kids under, say, 8 years of age, to watch.  It's more for the gymnast who has begun serious training (eg level 4).  But the information is sound, and they do offer some tips and advice which could be used by any young gymnast.

It's not a complete money-waster...but not what I was looking for.",1380067200,,724,4.398496240601504
3464444,5,B001AQW6EG,"easy to follow instructions... if your girl loves gymnastics, she will love this DVD.  Hard to get her to stop watching.",1374883200,5,120,4.714285714285714
3464445,2,B001AQW6EG,The children seemed bored and the item doesn't really have many moves to stimuiate a childs interest.  Seemed a little dated.,1363392000,3,125,4.9523809523809526

8278817,4,B001AQW6EG,My daughter loves watching and trying to copy the girls on the video.  I do have to say it is a bit cheesy looking as i think it was filmed in the 80's.  I am sure things have been updated since but works great for my 3 year old,1480464000,,228,3.63265306122449

8278821,3,B001AQW6EG,"This dvd is basically a bunch of 2 to 4 year olds having fun playing in the gymnastics gym first, with the instructors explaining what's going on. Then a coach with about 7 or 8 year olds doing beam, then uneven bars. There's no vault, and no floor. Which ironically was what I was looking for. It looks to be from about the 80's. I still like it ok. I think $10 is a lot considering they didn't cover two of the main gymnastics areas. I wouldn't have bought it if I knew what it was (although if it was cheaper, I probably still would have bought it). I have a 13 month old daughter who I'm about to start taking to mommy and me gymnastics so hopefully this dvd will turn out to be great in the future.",1441929600,2,703,4.0647482014388485
