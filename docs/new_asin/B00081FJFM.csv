8055210,2,B00081FJFM,"There are very VERY short snippets by Charleton Heston, Tom Selleck and Chuck Norris, though the picture is VERY misleading on the DVD cover.  Many short shippets by various people including everyday people, and the DVD is very short.  Okay DVD if you can get it for $1 or less, plus postage, otherwise save your money for something else.",1254182400,5,338,4.711864406779661
8055211,1,B00081FJFM,"Very little of those on the cover, but a good coverage of Roy Rogers.
I wasn't impressed.",1218153600,3,89,4.294117647058823
