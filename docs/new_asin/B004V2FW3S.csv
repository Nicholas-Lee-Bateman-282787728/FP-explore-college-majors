8442722,3,B004V2FW3S,"The film Main Solah Baras Ki stars Sabrina as a young aspiring actress who falls for the famous director Dev Anand (playing himself).

The film is Dev Anand's best, but Sabrina really shines. She elevates it to a higher level. She is an actress with raw emotional talent. Refreshing to see someone who can be lost in the character. Hope to see more of her soon.

I was at the premiere in London years back, and remember seeing Sabrina wearing an amazing black dress. Very classy and an extravagant premiere, Even Prince Charles was there.

Sabrina, if you read this - good work! Keep it up",1305849600,,589,4.537735849056604
