1061158,5,6305731926,"I remember my mom buying me a comic book of this story when i was 6 years old. It was in chinese and I couldn't read it, but I loved the book so much. I cherished that book. It's been 18 years since I seen it, this movie Is wonderful. I believe it is a bit mature for young children, but a must see for everyone. It isn't everyday that a cartoon movie can make a grown man cry.",983059200,3,377,3.7848101265822787
1061159,5,6305731926,"what can i say this IS the 1st animated title  i have cried to, i had to  shut the door so no one in the household could see me. beautiful imagery  abound, a very touching story of a young artist his dog and the people who  enter his life. it is a must see  so just watch it.",966297600,4,275,3.6724137931034484
1061160,5,6305731926,"After seeing this video advertised on one of my children's television  shows, I immediately sought it out.  The animation reminded me of ""My  Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" (both of  which are among the best childrens' videos available, imho).
After  peeling off the wrapper (which had a sticker on it which said it was  suitable for ages 3 and up) I sat down to watch ""The Dog of  Flanders"" with my two children (ages 7 and 9), and the three of us  were bawling our eyes out by the end of the film (me primarily due to guilt  for not screening it earlier!)  My kids were devastated by the ending of  this movie.  This is NO Disney flick.  Any of you familiar with Hans  Christian Andersen's ""The Little Match Girl"" will have an idea of  how this story winds up.
I do, however, give this movie 5 stars because  it is a beautifully rendered video of a classic tale.  The characters are  very well developed and the animation is really beautiful.  However, this  probably only served to contribute to the sense of horror my children  experienced when the video was finally over. They were truly  inconsolable.
If you do decide to purchase this video, please be sure to  watch it yourself before screening it for your kids.",960249600,38,1236,4.568807339449541
1061270,3,6305731926,"C'mon, they could have made it better. I thought the animation was cute and all, but it just doesn't cut it. It's emotional, but I'd reccomend Disney to kids...more appealing. It's just one of those rare movies that's...I'm at a loss for words. If you're emotional and love ""classics"", check it out...I guess.",1120003200,,309,4.849056603773585
1061271,3,6305731926,"I remember I saw this when i was kid in Japan. Original one was better. There are so many distractions in this new version. The use of computer graphic at the last seen was just distracting. It's like ""we are producing this under small budget, so we could afford only 10 seconds CG"". The first and last seen with adult nun is also distracting. There was no point to it. It doesn't give any depth or angle to the story. The was the grandfather died was also very artificial. They could do better...",1078876800,4,497,4.354838709677419
1061272,4,6305731926,Beautiful pictures with beautiful music. It's not a story of dog. It's a story about a boy in 19 century in Belgium. Great movie expecially if you have a dog. Recommended.,1078790400,3,171,4.548387096774194
1061273,3,6305731926,"Not a typical animation. No dancing animals, no happy ending. Compared to original story, character's age was set at much younger age. In original, they are 15 or something, but in this story, they are 8. This make audience hard to understand why a girl's father worry so much about their romance and marriage.",1078790400,3,310,4.7592592592592595
1061274,1,6305731926,"This classic from the World Masterpiece Theater series gets seriously botched by Pioneer Entertainment. First Off, this is the EDITED VERSION, and ONLY the EDITED VERSION! Scenes were cut from the original Japanese theatrical release to 'tame the violence to the dog' sequences, which were some important moments. Also, the original Japanese dialogue is nowhere on this disc.
But for some reason, the VHS release comes in either edited and dubbed, or widescreen uncut japanese with english subtitles.
My opinion is to go for the subtitled uncut version on VHS. Either that or somehow find the original series that aired on Japanese TV years ago to get the full story.
This movie is an absolute treasure in many Japanese childrens' childhoods, and now pioneer disgraces the DVD format.
5 stars for the movie, and 4 stars gets retracted for the butchering.",1052265600,18,854,5.0638297872340425
1061275,5,6305731926,"Where do I start, without giving anything away? I watched this movie yesterday with my daughter. We were thinking, ""La-tee-da, a happy movie, with beautiful Japanese animation (in the tradition of Kiki's Delivery Service and Totoro), about a boy and his dog . . ."" And boy, were we in for a loo-loo of a surprise. I never cried so much at an animated movie, I gave myself one mondo killer headache, attempting to retain some composure for my child's sake, but lost it in the end, and we both sat there, in her room and cried together. She summed things up pretty well, when she said, ""Mommy, sometimes sad movies are still beautiful."" And this one is a beautiful story indeed.
The movie is about a poor,young boy and his love for his dog.(and vice versa) He lives an oh-so-humble, but happy life with his aging grandfather. The movie tells the story of how his life then changes, based on the actions/thoughts of those around him. It's also about art/love and the beauty of art, as the young boy, the center of the movie, Nello, loves to draw, and does it well. He longs to see some of the paintings of Reubens,but cannot afford the cost of viewing the paintings.
I guess the overall message of the movie is that, God is beauty and art and love and the three of these things are all one giant amorphous blob of , well, blob of goodness . . .and that human lives are fragile and finite.
I wouldn't recommend this for the very young, and would suggest parents view the entire movie (with tissue nearby) before showing to the kiddies.",1047427200,18,1531,4.4714285714285715
1061276,5,6305731926,"This is a stunning animated feature with simple yet effective animation and a beautiful soundtrack.  A powerful story of a boy and his dog, together through thick and thin that has been around for more than a century.",1029196800,4,217,4.7105263157894735
1061277,5,6305731926,Are you sure this movie is made in 1959? It looks like color animation version. I do not think Japanese made color animation movies in 1959.,1023753600,,140,4.423076923076923
1061278,5,6305731926,"This movie is good but as DVD not so good because they do not have any good feature as DVD and it is just like video tape. No switching languages.
I usually do not like English dubed version but this one is really good. I think this movie is good in English because there is no jokes. If we translate jokes to different cultures, sometime it is hard or almost imposible. For example Pokemon in Japanese is so good but in English not so good.
This story might be sad but in Christian world it is supoosed be happy ending because they went to heaven. I am not a Christian sot that the most important thing is that both Patrasche and Nello were together when they died.
Some review say it is bad for kids but in Japan this stroy is made for kids. Kids should know sadness, too. And they should know they have better life than these poor people and dogs.",1023753600,3,850,4.220858895705521

7893187,5,6305731926,"I first saw this movie when it came out (in English) at the age of 7, and it immediately became one of my all time favourites. I don't watch it often, but it is one of the very few movies that I've watched more than 2 or 3 times (of my own accord). Despite it's very sad story (particularly the ending), it has oddly enough become my main comfort movie. More than anything else, it makes me feel human and ...I suppose more importantly, loved. No matter how bad things get.

All of that said, I know that I'm a bit of an oddity - being the only person in my very large extended family who has actually been WILLING to watch it a second time - but it certainly is a very beautiful, and beautifully executed story that I strongly recommend to anyone and everyone. However, do be prepared. If you can brace yourself, it should make the tear-jerking a little more... bearable.

As for the big complaint often said about the dub (which had about 10 minutes removed), not having yet seen the original I would just like to say that I don't feel the emotional impact was meaningfully affected. Certainly not so much that it makes the original unequivocally better except to the most diehard fans.",1328572800,,1188,4.420091324200913
7893188,4,6305731926,"i'm not a big fan of anime, but the movie had a good story line.  the problem is that i bought it for my five year old grandson (he asked for it), but it was a little hard for him to understand and way too long.  he's never wanted to watch it a second time.  i think it will be fine once he's a little older.",1280361600,,308,3.6363636363636362
7893189,5,6305731926,"There are many emotions wrapped up in this movie, it is a joy to watch. Both of my kids (age 7 and 9) gave it two thumbs up. It deals with some heavy topics such as death and classism. But it does so in a very gentle and appropriate way. It also emphasizes the importance of honesty, work ethic, friendship, and creativity. The majority of the movie makes you feel so good about the friends and the loyal dog.

In case you are afraid of a sad ending, there is a very dramatic climax which leaves you feeling gutted, but then is followed with a montage to remind you of all the wonderful things leading up to it. Lastly you are brought back to present day with the friends greeting each other and happily revealing what has become of their lives.

It is a real shame that the movie wasn't distributed more. It is difficult to find but worth the effort.",1258156800,,851,4.279503105590062
7893190,5,6305731926,"Sometimes I get the impression that fiction for children is required to be 'funny.' How did we come to accept all manners of neurotic, dark, 'imaginative' humor that degrade the human spirit as suitable for our children, while they must be protected against sorrow at all costs? As a father of two young boys, I find this state of affairs to be the truly unforgivable sad story of our times.

Sorrow that builds the soul, on the other hand, touches children  with invisible grace.",1234137600,,480,4.7023809523809526
7893191,4,6305731926,"The novel of ""A Dog of Flanders"" was just a few pages long. So dragging this on to 52 episodes as in the World Masterpiece Theater anime adaptation would mean to add many irrelevant characters and side-stories.

The movie stays closer to the novel, except that here Nello and Allois are some years younger. The design looks a lot like the 1975 series in order  to be accessible to children, but this time the characters look a  lot better and some nice CGI designs of Antwerb and the countryside were added.

I also watched the Japanese version that lasted 102 minutes, that had some scenes that were omitted in the English DVD release, like the one alluding to some possible love relation between Nello and Allois, even if they're younger than in the novel. But regarding cruelty to animals the original is not any different from the English version.

Only in the 1975 series there is a graphic depiction of animal abuse. And there the Japanese voice actress of Allois is much better. Still the English dub is very good and the first time I watched it it left an impression.

Very well directed movie, but better read the book and try to find the anime series of 1975 or the 1992 anime remake that is supposed to stay closer to the novel.",1187568000,,1239,4.533632286995516
7893192,5,6305731926,"I've heard about ""The Dog of Flanders"" years ago, & now that I have bought & seen it, I am glad I did. I loved every moment! Several scenes I cried, especially when poor Nello would be turned away just because he was poor. ;_; It even caught the attention of my mother, who hates anime. :P It's a very sweet & entertaining version of the classic tale. I know kids & their families would enjoy it very much. So if you're an anime fan looking for a good anime movie, or if you just want a movie to cherish forever, then this movie is the one for you. I guarantee you wiil not be sorry.",1181692800,,583,4.0344827586206895
