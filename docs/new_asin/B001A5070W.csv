3445599,4,B001A5070W,"This movie is a wonderful lesson in how hurtful we can be to ourselves and others.  The movie uses comedy in a brilliant way to make us laugh and cry at ourselves.  You'll see the ugliness of a society that perpetuates being slim and fit, at any cost, while fearing the so-called curse of being overweight. Overweight people have a right to be angry with society's prejudice toward them.

""A survey of persons asked the question of being 100 lbs. overweight for life or losing a hand, which would you choose?; an overwhelming majority chose losing the hand.""

As a man watching this movie I was given a lesson in why so many women are so conscious of their weight as well as what makes a woman beautiful at any size. The confidence and realness of the big woman in contrast to the insecurity and emotional detachment from life of the little woman drives the message home perfectly in this movie.

This movie forces the viewer to participate in the onscreen dialogue. It makes us aware of our own fears and weaknesses as well as that of our friends and family when it comes to compulsive anything.  More importantly though it shows us how to accept and be happy with our imperfect selves and our imperfect friends.

A must see at any weight!",1245196800,,1240,4.533632286995516
3445600,5,B001A5070W,"Disfigured is a powerful drama about women and men who struggle with weight issues. Weight is an issue for so many of us. There is phenomenal pressure especially on women to stay thin; and of course there are the medical problems that can come with being overweight. In addition, there are medical problems and other issues that are associated with anorexia. Disfigured does a splendid job of showcasing the lives, the everyday struggles, and the emotional roller coaster ride people can go on when they try to come to terms with body image issues, weight, self-esteem, self-acceptance, anger, fear and so much more. The acting is terrific despite the fact that these are not very well known actors; they certainly had me convinced they were real people and not just actors! The plot moves along at a very good pace and I was never once bored. The cinematography is also excellent.

When the action starts, we quickly meet the overweight members of a fat acceptance self-help group; they want to change societal attitudes so that there will be less prejudice against overweight people. One afternoon an anorexic woman, Darcy (Staci Lawrence) comes; she truly thinks she is overweight and she wants to join the group. She is quickly voted out except by one member, Lydia (Deidra Edwards) who thinks maybe Darcy should be allowed to join the group.

Although she was voted out of the group, Darcy wants to help Lydia advertise her new fat acceptance walking group. Lydia is taken by surprise; she's not sure what to make of Darcy. However, Darcy is very eager to make a friend; and the good natured Lydia makes friends with Darcy. It isn't too long after the walking group starts that Lydia meets Bob (Ryan C. Benson); Lydia and Bob start a ""no strings attached"" affair and it's very interesting to see their relationship develop.

Eventually Lydia and Darcy become closer with each woman sincerely trying their best to help the other with weight and body image issues. Darcy stays over at Lydia's place to keep a watchful eye on Lydia so that she won't overeat without being noticed; and Lydia asks Darcy for ""anorexia lessons"" when she becomes involved with Bob. These two women want desperately to help each other confront their deepest psychological fears and demons so that they can get stronger and no longer suffer. All along the way, Lydia and Darcy confront issues including anger, fear and the need to let feelings ""in"" instead of just letting feelings ""out.""

Will Lydia and Darcy conquer their demons and gain more control over their weight and body image issues? What about Lydia and Bob--will they stay together or will something eventually cause them to go their separate ways? What about the tension between Darcy and her mother--how will they manage to keep things under control? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!

The DVD comes with a plethora of bonus features; and that's terrific. There's an optional running commentary with Staci Lawrence, Deidra Edwards, Ryan C. Benson and director Glenn Gers; three deleted scenes; a ""behind the scenes"" featurette; outtakes and bloopers; a featurette on fat acceptance and eating disorders; the theatrical trailer and more!

Disfigured shines as a brilliant film that focuses on incredibly important social and psychological issues regarding body image, weight, self-acceptance, anger and so much more. I highly recommend this film.",1243641600,6,3405,5.007067137809187
3445601,5,B001A5070W,"I loved this film. It exceeded my expectations. As someone who has been both anorexic and quite large in my lifetime, I could both relate to the film on a personal level, and also really appreciate it on a more social/political level as well.

I found the characters, as well as the actors who portrayed them, for the most part very believable with minor reservations. I think the only reservation I had on the believability scale was a bit with Darcy, the anorexic main character, I found a bit too 'with it' and bold and sure of herself. It's been my experience, both personally and of other anorexic women, that sufferers of anorexia tend to be a bit more unsure of themselves, plagued with self-doubt, not quite so confident in themselves or their abilities. But overall, I found the film realistic and approachable.

I also thought that it really addressed a lot of important issues, namely that both fat people and anorexic people actually have quite a lot in common, and by these two women getting to know and understand each other, a lot of myths get debunked that each one has about the other, and the viewer might have about them as well. We learn, through the growing friendship between these two women, that, fat or thin, they're both just regular people, and that they struggle with a lot of the same issues as each other and as everyone else does.

For me, one of the most important aspects of this film was the unapologetic love scene between two of the plus-sized characters/actors. This is both a love scene and a sex-scene; romantic and carnal at the same time. Its lighting is softly pinkish, but their act is both loving and animal, and they are naked and glorious in all their fleshy selves, fat rolls and big bellies and breasts and thighs and butts right out there for all to see. The scene is interspersed with shots of people in a fat activism group discussing, quite frankly, what they like about sex, and the difficulties of wanting and enjoying sex in a world where people are disgusted with their fat bodies. It shows us, in a very unapologetic way, that fat people have the same needs and wants as every other person, for love and sex, and that it is natural and normal and there is nothing disgusting about it. Fat people are made, in this society, to feel ashamed for their appetites, and this scene, and this film in general, portray the satisfaction of appetite as natural and normal and, if anything, it's the denial of appetite that seems disturbed and stunted.

I would highly recommend this film to anyone who has 'food issues' or anyone who has prejudice toward people of size, though prejudicial people might be disgusted by it. It's an eye-opening film that shows us, above all, that people are just people, regardless of how we look. None of us are perfect and all of us have some sort of hang-up. It's just that some people's hang-ups end up being displayed in a more physically obvious way than other people's, on the canvas of the body.

One more addendum: The plus-sized main character, Lydia, has a love interest in this film, a fellow plus-sized person named Bob, who is played by Ryan Benson. Interestingly, Ryan Benson was the winner on season 1 of ""The Biggest Loser."" I've watched 'Loser' off and on since its inception, and throughout that time I've been impressed with their results but often wondered at the ability of their contestants to keep off the impressive weight that they lose. They lose weight so rapidly and have to devote so much time and energy to the task, that I've often thought that it would be impossible for them to keep the weight off long-term because it's just too demanding a regimen for anyone to maintain for life. Now I know. Ryan may not be all the way back to his pre-'Loser' weight, but he's definitely a big guy again. I have to say I was pleased to see that he hasn't let his weight gain stop him from living his life. He obviously has an acting career going for him and he isn't hiding in a hole somewhere feeling ashamed for 'failing'. Good for him!",1243555200,3,4037,4.578146611341632
3445602,4,B001A5070W,"I would have given this movie 3 stars if I hadn't waited 10 days to write this review.  The fact that I haven't been able to get it out of my head and now desire to watch it again tells me that it is better than I initially perceived.  I am a recovering anorexic, so it is obvious why I bought this movie. It is thought provoking and I believe very artistically made.  I think it would make an awesome play on stage.

The reason I give it four stars instead of five is that I think the film unpolished and the acting isn't as rich as I would've liked and there was a sex scene that was much more explicit than necessary.  That being said, this is an independant film (which I love) and I thought it accomplished the purpose that was intended.  I especially liked how it incorporated the background into making the whole ""feel"" of the characters'  personalities come forth--the reflection of the anorexic's darkness, the black, white and grey, the angular and pointed edges, the lack of any color, spark, or even joy at all in her life.  In contrast, the overweight woman had bright color and objects surrounding her that represented her actually ""living"" and experiencing all that life has to offer.  She had sexuality and embraced it (although made all the wrong choices expressing it)---there was a lot this movie expressed visually along with the character development.  One thing I must say is although they say the anorexic is recovering, she didn't express any recovery signs that I could see.

This film spoke a lot about the issues facing women of all sizes.  I don't know much about being overweight, but I do know what it is like to be a woman in this weight-obsessed world--and like the anorexic in the movie, I always ""feel"" awfully fat.  As an anorexic all of my adolescent and adult life, I thought the portrayal of the anorexic was extremely well done.  Of course as with any movie, the anorexic character did exibit a lot of the stereotypical thoughts about anorexics and anorexia in general, but of course that cannot be helped in a 90 minute movie.  I was pleased the movie showed the strained relationship between the adult anorexic and her parents--especially her mother.  The friendship between the two main characters was intriguing.  I was a bit put-off by the ""anorexic lessons"", because most anorexics would be offended that anyone would think that they could just become anorexic because they decide to do so.  That is not true, but I believe the issue brought up in the movie is very relevent to the thoughts of the lay public concerning anorexia.

There was a scene in the movie that intensely brought the friendship between the two young women in the movie together in a very moving and profound way.  The dialogue in that moment brought the whole message of the movie together and it made understanding both of the characters in relation to the world around them manifest in a way I rarely see in film.

Finally, fair warning...there is a graphic sex scene that shows a lot of nudity.  I will watch this movie again, but I will not watch that scene again.  In fact if I could do it, I would delete that part from my own dvd.  I understand the reason for the scene, but I believe it detracted from the message of the movie.  The movie would have been much better if it would have left us to our own imagination as far as that is concerned.

I do recommend this film to adults only because of the sex.  If you fast forward or remove the sex then I recommend this movie to teens as well.",1236297600,10,3514,4.518987341772152
3445603,4,B001A5070W,"At first I was a little turned off by the summary. Then I started watching it. I was ready to stop at around twenty minutes. The movie was really painting a bad picture of the fat acceptance movement initially, and fat people in general as if they're all just a bunch of overeaters*  just trying to change the world. As time went by, however, I started to slowly get into it.

*WARNING: SPOILERS (Skip two paragraphs for non-spoilage :P)*

From what I saw, it's as if the anorexic woman represented a complete internalization of the body image issue, whilst the members of the Fat Acceptance group (Minus the main character) represented complete externalization of the issue. The whole idea of giving ""Anorexia Lessons,"" threw me for a curve ball, but then I understood where it went. To me, the movie is saying that the issue is both external and internal, but that these issues among women (And MEN for that matter) of all sizes share similarities.

I don't agree that you can compare binge eating disorder or compulsive overeating to Anorexia Nervosa so casually, but I think the recovery, help, and catharsis are similar. I also think it expressed that the negative body image that is a part of these disorders and in general are opposites that are expressed almost exactly the same as well in many cases.

The movie to me nearly underestimates society and what it does to people when it comes to body image (But it's only an influence... ALBEIT a strong one lol :p). Not to a horrible degree, but it rubbed me a little bit. That, and the picture that is painted of that group (I'm not taking much because that might just be a symbol of body issue externalization here [Just one quarter of a star]) is the reason I can't give this a five.

I will say this is a 4 1/2 in my book among these issues though. The ending made me smile. Body acceptance is something for everyone, and rights among people of all sizes? That's a whole different issue to be tackled. There's nothing wrong with doing both at the same time, but they are different issues. You just can't say ""F@%& the world! Change for me"", nor can you say ""It's all my fault! I'm hideous!"" They're both extremes that more often than not don't solve anything in the end. This is one of the reasons that while I believe in body acceptance (And I'm a moderate among rights), I am unwilling to join many groups because they don't represent my beliefs to the same degree.

I'll leave this example of why this isn't just internal for kicks though:

""Ever feel like your fat? This movie is about some super fat people that just don`t feel like they fit in. Great god. Whats happening to us.""

""ahhhahahhhhahha.lol.""

""And this is the problem with americans""

""everyone should learn muay thai to keep strong and fit..god give a great body to you..why not used it and take good care of it..""

""this movie is super lame....they hate on the skinny girl in this movie. There is also i really disgusting fat sex scene don`t watch this movie if you have eaten recently, unless you`re bulimic in such cases it would be very appropriate and advantageous because you could just recall the fat sex images from memory and puke on command with no finger down the gullet.""

Now compare that to what I've said about the movie.
I rest my case. All I have to say is: LOVE YOUR F***** SELF! It's good for you! That doesn't mean glossing over the issues that you may or may not have. It means not judging your worth by how you look. PERIOD.

I'm a thin, young male (That has practiced, and likes Muay Thai Kickboxing) too, but that is a moot point, is it not? lol

3445605,1,B001A5070W,"While the conversations in this movie are thought-provoking, this film ultimately reenforces stereotypes. Lydia is portrayed as a compulsive, emotional over-eater, when study after study has shown that many fat people do not eat any more than average people, and often are persistent dieters. The film also comes down on the side that Lydia needs therapy - it portrays sizism as an issue that must be dealt with internally, rather than dismantling society's prejudices. If any other group of people facing discrimination were told to seek therapy and self-help, we would recognize that attitude alone as an extreme prejudice, much less the problem of failing to recognize the very real prejudice that leads to internalized oppression.

They succeed to some extent because Darcy does not stop pursuing Lydia. This baffles Lydia at first, but Darcy really needs a friend and the two women eventually realize they have more in common than they would have guessed.

I watched this from the point of view of someone who has been borderline anorexic... never enough to get sick, but have definitely had weight issues... currently weigh exactly what I am supposed to (according to those horrible weight charts) and still hate my body. So when I saw this movie on the shelf I had to snatch it up. The film has received some criticism for making Darcy too healthy and they even mention in the special features that if Darcy is appealing to you, you should speak to someone about it. It is true... she is very functional. She has a successful job, is not sick, and is just very thin, not skeletal. Of course, she is ""recovering."" I guess we have to remember that. But there is even a scene where Darcy attends a party, her mom talks her into eating a snack, and Darcy goes to the bathroom and spits it out. I really have to agree that they did NOT make Darcy look sick enough. Or at all. Considering almost everyone else in the cast was overweight, of course if you could choose to look like anyone, you would want to look like Darcy. I think that was a mistake. Lydia is obviously healthier than Darcy. Physically AND mentally. But no one wants to look like her.

Despite that, I liked everything about the movie. Although I love special effects, I love when movies are based on acting, plot and real-life situations like this movie. Darcy and Lydia discussed prejudice they have experienced from family and friends and even strangers based solely on how they look and they bonded over that. They tried to help each other learn to eat better. They were not exactly successful. But learning to live a healthy lifestyle can take a lifetime. This was a movie that made you think and I love that.

About the sex scene between Lydia and her overweight friend. Yeah, I thought it was gross, but I have also never liked watching sex scenes between skinny people either. They are gross too. It's just a personal preference I guess. It's beyond me why people want to do that in front of a camera. I think movies are better without them. But I do understand that they wanted to make it seem as normal for fat people as for everyone else. It's just too bad they had to.

I loved the scene where Darcy and Lydia traded ""concerns"" their families always express for them. Darcy: ""I feel like I'm going to break you!"" Lydia: ""I'm just worried you're going to have a heart attack any day now!"" They had tons of them and they were so funny.

The movie starts out looking like a documentary or a reality show, but soon takes a dramatic turn as we get to know spunky, troubled  Lydia and morose Darcy.  Women of all sizes can relate to the pressure to be perfect and the misery of those who compulsively overeat or starve.  The movie does not resolve any issues and there are no magical make-overs,  it just brings an important subject to light and opens it up for discussion.

I think the writer/director made the most of his $50K budget, but it still looks like a student film.  The dialogue is sometimes corny and the sound quality is poor as is the photography.  Most of all, the actors, while earnest, were simply not good enough to make me forget I was watching a cheap movie.  On the plus side, the movie does bring to light a very serious problem plaguing millions who wonder everyday, ""What good am I if I'm not perfect?""

3445617,5,B001A5070W,"Disfigured DVD Review
1 Disc (2008)

""Disfigured"" was written and directed by Glenn Gers and stars Deidra Edwards and Staci Lawrence. Deidra Edwards is Lydia dealing with being fat and Staci Lawrence is Darcy dealing with anorexia and they form an unlikely friendship after Darcy tries to join a Fat Acceptance Group since she believes she is fat. This is a must-see movie for any woman (or man for that matter) who has had any issues with body image.

This is a shockingly amazing story coming from a male writer/director. Glenn Gers really captured these women as fully rounded characters in an intimate and real way. He gives equal focus to overweight and underweight people bringing the whole message back to body image and the fact that people need to be comfortable in their own skin before they can change or they will never be happy.

The script is very accurate to how women feel about body image and does an excellent job of giving both sides a lot of time and making sure both women get to know the other's problems more closely. Being overweight or underweight both have implications for affecting one's life health-wise, in relationships, at work, and especially how one feels when they are alone. Their friendship and discussions help both of them begin to move toward trying to be healthier people overall without worrying about body image. Anorexia very much is a dark, painful journey that Darcy does a great job explaining emotionally in her face and words, but appears more functional than a real person would be so the viewer has to understand that while she got the emotion dead-on, it really is a lot more painful to watch physically than she could demonstrate without living it. Lydia is actually a healthier person than Darcy though it might not look that way on the outside. She is emotionally stronger and more connected to others and has the capacity to love than Darcy has lost along with all other enthusiasm for life and food.

The movie does not leave the viewer with concrete solutions other than women apparently need to get together and talk about body image to learn to accept themselves before they can change themselves (anorexics seeking therapy, fat people committing to better health, etc). The major downfall of the movie is the low budget leading to lots of handheld shaky camera which is occasionally distracting and the lighting sometimes is so bright that it looks like an actress is standing against a white background when they are in a living room with furniture in it. The sound also gets a little hard to hear sometimes.

DVD Extras:

This DVD is packed full of extras. First off, there is director and cast commentary with Glenn Gers, Deidra Edwards, Staci Lawrence, and Ryan C. Benson which is very informative about background information and facts. There is a Behind-The-Scenes feature showing off Venice Beach starting off with the story of two overweight people wanting to walk and the story developing from that and online message boards drama. It was a challenging film to shoot on the beach with lots of unwanted background noise that had to be weeded out and it was a very hot, humid shoot with lots of ""night"" indoor shots being taken in the daytime with black plastic over windows making it hard on the actors. Unfortunately the interview taken with Staci Lawrence is apparently in a noisy night club or something because it is very difficult to hear her. This entire feature length film was shot in fifteen days!

There is a Fat Acceptance and Eating Disorders featurette explaining what actual fat acceptance movements are about and how he took it a bit farther to make an argument. Glenn Gers hosts this portion and recommends a book title ""Rethinking Thin"" as a good source of information and admonishes anyone from thinking anorexia is an attractive idea before jumping to an interview segment between some experts in the field to provide some of the psychology behind the ideas from the film. One group fights for civil rights of fat people and discusses the discrimination in the workplace and elsewhere. They emphasize the movie's message of education and communication for advancement in solving these problems. A ""weight neutral"" perspective is like a foreign language. Exploring anorexia, they brought forth some symptoms that weren't shown in the film that Darcy actually would have been experiencing like coldness, hiding one's body in bulky clothes, and a slowing down of metabolism and energy except during compulsive exercise. Darcy was a very functional anorexic in this movie and her body was shown a lot more for the viewer than actually affected people would have. The experts here vow that it is a disease one can recover from though it is widely believed that isn't the case. It is a very informative and helpful.

The outtakes and improvisations are very funny and the deleted scenes were very informative showing more symptoms for Darcy and more of both main characters' childhood history.",1271376000,2,4975,4.893238434163701

I liked the commentary on the ""fat acceptance"" movement, e.g. standing up to skinny shamers (body acceptance is good; fat acceptance is bad). The nude scene was surprisingly tasteful. The lead character did get progressively more annoying, which made it hard to sympathize with her. Acting was not great. If you like Lifetime movies, you will probably like this. It was worth a watch.",1470096000,,497,4.928571428571429
