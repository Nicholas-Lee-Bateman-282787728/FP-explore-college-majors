This family saga is HILARIOUS, touching, sexy, wildly irreverent, and breakneck paced. For American viewers with minimal exposure to British slang and street accents, I recommend watching with the subtitles ON.

Only Season 1 is available in Region 1 (U.S.), Seasons 2-5 are Region 2 only. There are ways around this -- all region DVD players, resetting Macintosh internal DVD player to region 2, etc.
It is absolutely worth the effort, but why hasn't the rest of the show been released for Region 1? Why hasn't this show made a splash on U.S. cable television (along with Skins and many other British TV shows).",1232064000,8,687,4.716666666666667
8259062,5,B0015M48KA,"This series would never make traction in the US. Think of it. People on gov assistance and very much living nuanced lives on that assistance. Stuck on the gov tit like a leech on a hemophiliac for that matter.
The Gallagher clan and co are more human and real than any WASP PTA goer or church attending blowhard could ever aspire to.
The characters are detailed, subtle and astoundingly realized. Casting is above par and a joy to encounter. This is TV that is more cinematic than sitcom like. Yes I gush, but its the truth. Became a fan when I first saw season 1 on the Sundance Channel. Have been captive ever since.
Characters are flawed, as in real life. As most people are. But there is a realness to Shameless that challenges you. Do you really want to care for these people? Hang in there and soon enough you find another level within these characters that makes you practically tearful. That is great writing and acting.
If you are up for a challenge, and love great writing. Despite the fact that you may need to turn closed captioning on, and may miss some localisms that us US'inans may stare blankly at. This show is for you....and did I say it was funny. At times uproariously funny in fact.
Then take the plunge and go for it.",1220745600,13,1240,4.442982456140351
