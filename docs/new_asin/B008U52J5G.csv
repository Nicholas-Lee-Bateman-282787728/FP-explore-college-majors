8601928,3,B008U52J5G,"Awesome show, Saito Takumi is the best as usual. It's unfortunate english subtitles are not available to download anywhere online. The english subtitles on these DVD's do not make any sense. Sentences such as ""Wife green there fall"" are predominant. I can only figure they were created by a person who has never spoken the english language and literally does not know the translation of words from Japanese to English. Really disappointing actually. I wish I did know what the characters were saying, but watching the show anyway is awesome, it's totally action packed with great actors.",1381190400,2,587,5.061855670103093
