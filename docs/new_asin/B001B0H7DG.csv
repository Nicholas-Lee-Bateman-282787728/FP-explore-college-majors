Anne Francis was a great actress, and what a great show this was.  Thank you VCI.",1221091200,4,255,3.7547169811320753
3477523,5,B001B0H7DG,"Anne Francis holds the title of my first television crush. I was 13 when the series debuted and I can tell you that the show holds up even today. Diana Rigg as Emma Peel in the Avengers was her British counterpart, and I read that Honey West may have been cancelled after one season because of Mrs Peel's allure. I too would have liked to see this series continue for a few more years as I'm sure the second season would have been in color, adding a new dimension to it. I enjoyed the episode featuring Miss Francis from the Invaders two years after Honey ended, again showcasing Anne's versatility as an actress.
I highly recommend this before its time series to anyone who enjoys an action packed, but character driven story, made all the more fun by Honey's pet ocelot Bruce.",1220400000,4,778,4.485915492957746
3477524,5,B001B0H7DG,"The one season of the  TV show Honey West (1965-66) was a piece of TV history in the making. Her show would pave the wave of female detectives for generations to come. There were a few before her, but not many where she could keep up with the boys. Her show lead the way for other Female lead shows like  Cagney and Lacey and the Girl From U.N.C.L.E.

The show was a black and white, thirty  minute action packed thriller of a mystery. As I said it lasted only one season, but many in the network took notice of it and what could be done in 30 minutes.

Film actress Anne Francis, who starred in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forbidden-Planet-Ultimate-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000HEWEEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forbidden Planet (Ultimate Collector's Edition)</a>, takes the role with a plomb for action. She can handle herself in a male PI world with the best of them. Her small detectibe agency had many high tech gadgets that would make James Bond blush. She had brains combined with muscle. She could handle herself in high socity and slumming with the best.

She is aided by Sam Bolt (John Ericson), who acts  like mother hen to the adventurous West.  For those fans of fan fiction, some assume she was a kin to James West ((<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wild-Wild-West-The-Complete-Series/dp/B001CQONOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wild Wild West: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;)..but that is rumor like the Green Honest is kin to the Lone Ranger. BUT I digress!

This  DVD collection has all the Honey West shows from her series. However,  what is missing is the pilot of the show which aired on Burke's Law

This collection  has the cleanest master copies I have seen for a show forty  years old, cleaner than other DVD shows like  Superman, Wild West West or Perry Mason. Thankfully the video producers of this project did not colorize these episodes.

There are a few extras such as ads of the period like VCI did with their Roue 66 first season collection. However, there are  no audio commentary, I wish there was. With Star Anne Francis being ill, it would be nice to hear her thoughts on this show.

So is this worth getting, YES. It would be a treasure in any mystery fans library of classic television. I am putting Ms West between Ironside and Columbo, you know the deiective with brain and can think out a mystery.

Honey West, a slinky, glamorous female private eye, was something new to television --- In an era when actresses were confined to sedate housewife and girlfriend roles, this series marked a unique and original departure. This was the first dramatic TV series in the U.S. with a female star in an action-adventure role traditionally played by a male actor. In addition to being television's first modern, independent, self-sufficient woman, Honey frequently engaged in energetic fight scenes and shootouts. As The Avengers had not yet aired in America, it was unprecedented to see a beautiful, curvacious woman in a catsuit beating up male attackers with a high-kick, judo-flip, or well-placed karate chop. She is also the first character, male or female, on U.S. television to use martial arts as self-defense.

Her untamed feline qualites were reflected by her leopard spot and animal-print wardrobe and decor --- She also kept an exotic pet ocelot and raced around in a convertible sportscar --- The risque aspect of the novels was toned down for television, although sultry Anne Francis nevertheless exuded a considerable sex appeal --- And she frequently went on undercover missions requiring some revealing outfit or bikini, etc.

In keeping with the secret agent trend of the '60s, Honey was outfitted with a number of James Bond-type gimmicks: an exploding compact, a garter-belt gas mask, and tear-gas earrings --- Her partner and man-Friday ""Sam"" (John Ericson) usually stayed in the background or sat in their high-tech surveillance van talking to Honey via a radio hidden in her lipstick case --- Their relationship was kept platonic, and Honey usually had to rescue him instead of the other way around --- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

3477528,5,B001B0H7DG,"I only recently discovered this show from a friend who knew how much I love big cats.  Bruce the Ocelot is a star unto himself.  The show is a typical 60's detective show where things happen very quickly and almost unrealistically. It reminds me somewhat of The Saint, but only less international travel and more female charisma. Honey West is a great show and I am only sorry that more seasons were not created.  I can't wait to see the entire collection once it is released",1216771200,9,475,4.5
3477529,5,B001B0H7DG,"Spun off BURKE'S LAW, HONEY WEST was a very short-lived show (just one season) but it had the incomparable Anne Francis as Honey and John Ericson as her sidekick Sam Bolt.  I was eleven or twelve when I saw this show so my memories are kinda vague.  Be interesting to see how it holds up today.  (Remarkably, many shows from the 60's actually stand up pretty well because the driving principal behind them was to ENTERTAIN the audience.  Household watching the most popular shows dwarf today's network audience size.  Of course there were no cable or satellite channels or internet -- Al Gore hadn't invented the latter yet.)

3477533,4,B001B0H7DG,"""Honey West"" was one cool show, with a jazzy musical score and TV's first lady private eye. I'm not sure there would be another until Laura Holt in ""Remington Steele"" almost 20 years later. Anne Francis looked great in the role, with the most famous mole on TV. It was enough for the 8 year old version of me to develop a serious crush, and the 8 year old version of me didn't even know why boys were supposed to like girls yet. LOL

Some of the story lines are a bit formula. By the mid-60s there had already been dozens of private-eye shows, some of them with very long runs (77 Sunset Strip for example), so there was plenty of plot fatigue in the genre. You'd even find production schedule pressure causing things like slightly modified versions of the same script appearing on more than one series. I can remember one particular story, for example, being used both on ""Bourbon Street Beat"" and ""Maverick"", and of course Maverick wasn't even a private-eye show. Still, Honey West threw in some of its own twists, such as radio sun-glasses, judo, and exploding earrings.

Honey West was an early effort of Aaron Spelling, so it's no wonder that the show had a good look and a sexy flair which was years ahead of its time. Unfortunately, it was simultaneously a few years behind its time, being filmed in B&W at a time when color was emerging as the dominant TV format. That may have held back its viewership enough to cause it to end after only one season. But that one season does have 30 episodes, and thus 30 chances to see Anne Francis at her lovely best, which her wardrobe invariably showed to best advantage.

High drama? No. A lot of fun? Yes. I particularly liked the pilot episode, which was woven into ""Burke's Law"", another of my favorite crime series of the 60s.

This DVD set is of acceptable quality. Make sure to set your TV to 4:3 ratio for it to look its best, but the picture here has better than average sharpness for a 60s TV show on DVD. The sound is of remarkably good quality, without ear-jarring distortion even in the music.",1503360000,12,2053,4.466666666666667

Producer Aaron Spelling spun the character off into a separate thirty-minute series which premiered in the fall of 1965.  In the series Honey inherits the spying business from her late father, a top private eye. She also got his partner the rough and handsome Sam Bolt, played by John Ericson.

Also, this appeared to be lower budget attempt to emulate the old English ""The Avengers"" series, including having strong female lead.  This was an early Aaron Spelling production and you can see how much had improved by time of Dynasty and his other successful series with more resources.

3477561,5,B001B0H7DG,"Anne Francis shines in a 1 season series from 1965 thats full of chic fun, action, mystery, martial arts and comedy.

I knew about this show when I was little, but didn't watch it; although, I've always liked Anne Francis- a super actress with looks, brains, energy and an uniqueness or genuineness that made her stand out in any role.  I rememberher in that early, famous role opposite Spencer Tracey in Bad Day at Black Rock.  Wow, she could carry her own easily with any star.

Here, you have 30 episodes from a campy, somewhat trashy novel series turned into a stylish 30 minute TV slot adventure.  The writing is super crisp; full of fight scenes(lots of judo throws and karate chops- very well done.  Appreciated by a long time martial artist myself and well choreographed.), chases, a mystery to solve, murder and mayhem(without gratuitous blood), snappy one liners by our heroine, and elegance and a touch of suggested romance thrown in.

Honey drives a smart sports car; owns a playful ocelot(""Bruce as himself""), has a secret room beyond her office, lots of secret agent type devices, great clothes and a handsome, rough and tumble, take a lot of blows to the head, often arguing and at odds with, suave but dependable partner, Sam Bolt(gotta love that name) played superbly to the tee, by German born, John Ericson.

Our daughters love this show, for the enpowering image of Honey West takng charge, flipping the big, bad guys around with great aplomb and humor, solving mysteries and doing it with such a flare for style, and still having time to play with Bruce and her aunt.

Great show with lots of familiar cameo faces, for those of us who remember the 60's and 70's.  The bonus features include Anne Francis photo gallery, behind the scenes photos, vintage  commercials.

The family and I love watching the oldies on family movie night.  Something's missing in todays shows- pure entertainment for entertainment sake?  Novelty?  Great show themes(they had them in the 60's!).  I tell the kids that Honey West is the great, great granddaughter to James West, another show we watch-well, they both carry derringers.

3477573,5,B001B0H7DG,"Excellent series. I love Anne Francis. She was sexy, cool and very dangerous as a private eye. Very good action and her Judo was pretty damn effective. Not sure if she preceded Emma Peel with the judo but I am sure she was the first here in the US on tv to do so.",1431907200,4,263,3.888888888888889
3477574,5,B001B0H7DG,"This show reminds me quite a bit of the Avengers series, but with the male seemingly more subordinate, yet he always gripes at Honey quite a bit. I have never seen this show before, but had heard about it. A lot of people will tell you this is a women's lib show, or simply cheesecake. I have seen only half the episodes so far, and I must say while those aspects are the most recognizable of the show, once you watch a bunch of episodes those factors really fad quite a bit.

The show reminds me of the Avengers in that there's lots of clever quips, often by Honey herself, and it's cute them having little diversions such as Honey's cat, and at times where one scene will end with the last word missing, but continued in a completely different scene, by somebody else, supplying that last word. It gives just a miniscule taste that some minds are thinking alike and adds some humor.

To me, this show is more or less The Avengers on speed. They don't have a lot of time to get those plots in there, but it seems to work well, because once you get used to such a pace, you realize that all the key points in many Avengers episodes seem covered, only more quickly, and so since both heroes are rather fast paced it agrees with faster plots.

I do rather like the running joke seen in many episodes, where Sam is watching out for Honey (whom often goes in where angels fear to tread) yet he so frequently gets himself bashed in the head. Somehow those crooks are pretty keen to Sam's whereabouts. I also enjoy the fact that Honey isn't just Kato in a skirt, but is often quite feminine, and it's enjoyable to see how the two play off each other when Honey entertains somebody and Sam gets jealous.

If I had been an adult when this show were aired, I probably wouldn't had liked it, as I think a lot of men of the day would had seen it as somewhat threatening with the partial role reversal and it perhaps running with trying to be an arm of women's lib. But, if you watch the show, especially in this day and age, it doesn't come across preachy on those particular aspects at all. It's just a story about a girl with extraordinary abilities teamed with a fairly ordinary guy.

I can't find any flaws on the quality of the video itself, but it is a fairly dark series at times. Wow, wouldn't it had been a scream, in years following this series, to see a new Honey West with her and Mike Hammer? I suppose nobody ever wrote a book like that, nor would had been able to, but talk about an action packed ride that would had been for a tv series!

So overall I would say this is an entertaining series. It's a series that gets better as you watch it more, because you get more used to their style of humor, plus you start anticipating some of the same stunts, such as Sam getting his head bashed in yet another time. The sad thing is you have only one season's worth before they go away forever. BTW, I love the music on this series, especially the end credits. The music and the video in the opening theme, tell you right away what to expect from this series, and that's speed and adventure.",1430956800,9,3088,4.27008547008547

The story lines are fairly lightweight and the series is a vehicle for the lovely Ms. Francis. The series fits right in with the many other spy type shows of that era such as I Spy, Man From Uncle or The Avengers. It is less serious than I Spy but less corny than The Avengers.

3477592,4,B001B0H7DG,"""Honey West"" was unfortunately Anne Francis' only venture into television.  For its time, it was a novel idea: a female detective with a male cohort, predating ""Remington Steele"" by at least ten years.  The show followed ""Burke's Law"" on ABC on Friday nights at 9:00 P.M., of which it was a spin-off.  Alas, the show lasted one season, due to ABC's decision to be thrifty and buy cheaper programming in the guise of ""The Avengers"" than to continue with the more expensive ""Honey West.""  One of the things that hurt ""HW"" was that it was a detective drama that was only given a 30 minute time slot on ABC's schedule, when all other such drama shows were given an hour.  It also aired on Friday nights, eliminating viewership in the sacred 18-35 year-old demographic.  30 episodes were produced (by Aaron Spelling), and all are here in glorious black and white.  John Ericson portrayed her partner, Sam Bolt, while Irene Hervey (singer Jack Jones' mother) portrayed Honey's mom.

It was the first television show to feature a female private detective and many others followed in the 70's.  Anne Francis is at her beautiful best here, and not afraid to be extremely sexy, nor drop a lot of one-liners loaded with double entendres. Richard Levinson and William Link wrote a lot of the episodes, and they went on to greater fame with hits such as Columbo and Murder She Wrote among many others.

3477641,5,B001B0H7DG,"The same building housed ""H. West & Company, Private Investigators"" and ""Charles Townsend Associates, Private Investigations"". Whenever I see the camera shots of the exterior of that building I always wonder, were the two agencies down the hall from each other, or did one occupy the whole building and then moved out before the other one moved in? Did Hank West (Honey's father) and Charlie know each other? Did Honey West and Charlie's Angels ever run into each other from 1976 on? Surely Honey's macho partner Sam Bolt must have been aware of the Angels, hehe, but then again, he seemed secretly stuck on Honey.

Over a decade earlier it was April of 1965 and I was eight years old when Honey West sizzled the airwaves on the cop show ""Burke's Law"" Season 2 Episode 30 titled ""Who Killed the Jackpot?"" That September she was back in her own series. Producer Aaron Spelling had been inspired to bring the pulp fiction heroine to television after viewing Honor Blackman play Dr. Catherine Gale, the blond anthropologist partner of secret agent John Steed in the original episodes of the British television series ""The Avengers"". All I remember about ""Honey West"" from that time is seeing her face in the honeycomb cells during the title sequence. Then it was off to another channel to watch good ol' Gomer Pyle.

Most people don't know that the enormously popular ""Make Room For Daddy/Danny Thomas Show"" spun off the enormously popular ""Andy Griffith Show"", which in turn spun off the enormously popular ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C."". With Honey West in the same Friday night time slot as Gomer Pyle, how could she buck a tradition like that? On Friday nights the people who would be more devoted to watching ""Honey West"" would probably be out on the town anyway. What's more, Anne Francis said in an interview that the second season was going to be in color but there was a dispute between ABC and Four Star Productions, so ABC decided they could just air ""The Avengers"" cheaper than they could make ""Honey West"". They also thought they didn't need two catsuit-clad, karate-chopping women on the air at the same time. I disagree. Cathy Gale's successor Emma Peel was British -- played by Diana Rigg, she was the first Avenger woman to be seen in the States -- and Honey West was American. I would have watched both, because I loved ""The Avengers"" and now I know I would have loved ""Honey West"" too.

When the TV Land channel aired a ""Honey West"" marathon in the late 1990s (""brought to you in VertiVision, the vertical stacking modern marathon miracle where you know what show is coming up next by the show you're watching now!"") a friend videotaped several of the episodes for me. Yowsa! I soon realized that Honey West knew the secret of being a great entertainer: she left me wanting more! And not just because of her sex appeal; she was strong, she was smart, and even though she was tough she could still be gracious about it all. I don't think that when someone was killed her turning away in sadness, sometimes on Sam's shoulder, was any sign of weakness. The plots brought back that wonderful world of thirty-minute dramas and mysteries which we just don't see anymore. (They were the television equivalent of literature's ""short stories""). I also dug that crazy jazz score, which I can listen to over and over again without getting tired of it. With a little bit of suspension of disbelief ""Honey West"" is credible to me; and contrary to the sleazy pulp fiction novels on which it was based, the TV series can be safely watched by the whole family. I'm so glad DVDs are finally available!",1324512000,6,3592,4.707472178060414
3477642,5,B001B0H7DG,"Today it is taken more or less for granted that a woman could be a private detective, could be skilled in martial arts, know how to use a gun, to be an equal to a strong, handsome young man, in fact even be his boss but in 1965 these were radical notions.  As in the semicomic novels by G. G. Fickling, Honey West had inherited her PI business from her father Harry West.  In the novels Honey worked alone but in the TV version she is aided by partner/employee Sam Bolt who takes care of all the high electronic gear as well as supplying some additional muscle from time to time.  In order to keep tongues from wagging (this was the mid 60's remember) the two were 'chaperoned' by Aunt Meg aided by Honey's pet ocelot, Bruce.  The half hour episodes were all written in a lighthearted vein, full of banter and some very mild innuendos.  The stories are on a par with other series from the time, some clever ideas and some plot holes big enough to drive a truck through, but still quite entertaining.

What sets this apart from other series before or since is the ground breaking role of a very feminine young woman as a very active lead in an action show rather than as a sweet, helpless victim.  Not to be done by her contemporaries, Honey had all the cutting edge technology of hidden radios, tracking devices and spy cameras just like James Bond or the Men from UNCLE.  She even had a secret sliding door separating her office from her apartment just like the one concealing the entrance into UNCLE headquarters.  This series lead the way for many that followed, Police Woman, Charlie's Angels, Remington Steele and others.

There are some interesting extras included, some vintage commercials that will now bring a laugh - a throat lozenge that would sooth a sore throat enough so the a cigarette could be enjoyed! - and some production stills.  Sadly there is no commentary track for any of the episodes, it would have been interesting to hear some of Ms Francis' thoughts on the production.  Still there are wonderful little gems, performances of stars before they were stars, Maureen McCormick pre-Brady Bunch, Bobby Sherman pre-Here Come the Brides.  It is too bad that this delightful series only lasted one season - it was replaced by The Avengers.  Even though Honey West was quite popular the network felt that there was no need to have two shows featuring 'girl private eyes'.",1307836800,5,2389,4.617021276595745

3477649,5,B001B0H7DG,"Give it up for Aaron Spelling's production of that femme private eye, Honey West.  Not a big hit in the Sixties, lasting only one season.  It was fun watching the first eight episodes in this set.  I won't list all the episodes here, but each one involved Honey, her partner Sam and her pet ocelot, Bruce.

Bruce just growls and playfully bites as Honey (Anne Francis) and Sam (John Ericson) solve another one for the good old USA.  Kidnappings, jewel thieves and, interestingly enough, criminal women masterminds!

Another fun thing about these shows:  The crazy jazz music, and the special guest stars that you just ""know"" them from somewhere.  I spotted several minor celebs that I've seen on Star Trek.  Also an old favorite, Everett Sloane, who has appeared on Western TV.  A very young Brady girl, Maureen McCormick appeared as well.

Different directors and producers run each episode, at least at the start of the first season.  Honey knows judo and uses it fairly well, though sometimes she's hit over the head unconscious.  Other times the duo is in a lot of hot water!  Some episodes have the plot of the client who is actually the thief.

I mean Honey and Sam are no Thin Man's Nick and Nora by any means.  But Honey's intro into network television opened the door to other strong female characters in crime dramas and other television, so the show is important from a TV history viewpoint.

3477651,4,B001B0H7DG,"""Honey West"" stands as a precursor to later Aaron Spelling shows like ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""Melrose Place"", insomuch that the action revolves around a gorgeous woman.  In this case, that woman is the late Anne Francis, who proves to be absolutely stunning and capable as the title character.  Anne Francis actually reminds me a little of the late Elizabeth Montgomery, who was busy with her own series, ""Bewitched"" at the time.  But whereas Montgomery's Samantha Stephens could wiggle her nose to make things happen, Honey West had to use brains, skills, technology, a little muscle in the form of her partner Sam (well played by John Ericson), and a little grounding in the form of her Aunt Meg (also nicely played by Irene Hervey).

And then there's Bruce, the pet ocelot who looked right at home in the midst of all the chaos.  It's one thing for people to remember how fetching Anne Francis looked in all those evening gowns or in the stealthy bodystockings, but Bruce holds his own whenever he's on screen.  He definitely earned his place in TV animal star lore, alongside other favorites like Arnold the Pig (""Green Acres""), Ben (""Grizzly Adams"") and Tiger (""The Brady Bunch"").

Like many shows from the time period, ""Honey West"" features a bevy of actors who would later become famous in other roles, including James Best (""The Dukes of Hazzard"") and James B. Sikking (""Doogie Howser, M.D.""), and celebrities like Bert Parks (longtime host of the Miss America pageant) and Dick Clark (who has hosted so many shows it's not fair to choose just one).  The music sets an appropriate tone - a high-energy opening theme to get you ready for action, and a low-key closing theme that acts to cool you down and get your ready for next week.  And the language remains nice and clean, which means the whole family can enjoy it.

It only ran for one season, but ""Honey West"" is an unusual and entertaining part of television history.  It's definitely worth the purchase.",1294358400,11,1968,4.792899408284024

3477653,5,B001B0H7DG,"Great show! Not as camp as Batman or as self-mocking as The Avengers, Honey West comes across as stylish and likable.

I was unaware of Honey West when it first aired in 1965, so it was brand new to me when I saw it recently. It's obviously influenced by The Avengers, which had been on for a few years in Britain and was enormously popular there but wouldn't be on American TV until 1966. Honey West (Anne Francis) is a detective who owns her own agency, which she inherited from her father. Her partner in crime detection is Sam Bolt (John Ericson), but the name on the door of the office is Honey West - she's the boss.  This is progressive stuff for the era of Rob and Laura Petrie.

Honey and Sam, a former marine, are equals when it comes to proficiency in martial arts and use of firearms - no mean feat when you observe that even when dressed in her ready-for-action black catsuit, Honey is usually wearing stilettos. What a sense of balance.

I thoroughly enjoyed these shows, although a thirty-episode season proved to be a bit much for the writers. On the last disc, there were several clunkers that featured ridiculous villains such as a guy in an ape suit, a guy in a robot suit, a guy in a bear suit, gypsies, and a guy in a Robin Hood suit. Fortunately the final few episodes were more believable.

For the most part, these were average TV detective stories, but a little more action-packed because they were only a half hour long. No long explanations or tedious subplots, just right into the story and away we go. Honey and Sam have more than a professional relationship, but we don't know how serious they are. Honey lives with her Aunt Meg (Irene Hervey), who seems to less a chaperone than a kooky roommate who is always just coming back from the racetrack or is just off to the casino. She helps out on a few cases, which is more than you can say for Bruce the Ocelot, who's little more than an accessory to go with Honey's feline-themed wardrobe.

It's fun watching Honey and Sam chasing down criminals with the help of their oh-so-sophisticated gadgets, such as Honey's car phone, mini cameras, and listening devices. And you get to see some actors before they became famous, notably Maureen McCormick (The Brady Bunch) at age eight or nine, and Bobby Sherman as a brash, but untalented singer. Extras are several dozen vintage commercials: cigarettes, makeup, perfume, margarine, etc. The shows and commercials are all in black-and-white, although a couple of Honey West promos for a local Dallas station are in color.",1275955200,4,2542,4.600441501103753

She was the quintessential prelude to all the later super women who always got their man...and put him out of commission. I would like to think that she could have been Nikita's grandmother, played by Peta Wilson on LaFemme Nikita. I loved that show and it all started with my infatuation with Anne Francis as this intelligent detective who could catch the bad guys and still look and act like a lady.

Sure the dialog is dated, the action can't match today's standards with all it's special effects, the episodes are just 30 minutes long and the episodes were filmed in black and white, but all those drawbacks is what gives this series it's whit and charm. There is something special about the way detective dramas were written in the 1960's. Quite a bit of the dialog reminds me of James Bond's ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia with Love""-simple, straight forward and to the point. (just the way I like it). Then there is the 30 minute episode length (well more like 20 something, but you get the point). Having this short time frame, allows the viewer to sit down and watch an entire episode in sort of fast motion. The plot is set, a few twists are thrown in and Honey solves the case. It's simple, it's clean and it works all the time. Finally, there is the black and white filming. Some folks out there can't stand black and white and deemed it outdated and not worth watching. I say hogwash; this medium has stood the test of time and in my book adds a touch of class and visual beauty to this series. I could go on and one and talk about how cool it is to see those great automobiles from the 1960's speed across your TV set or those classic commercials from Wesson Oil or Mabelline. Oh, and did I mention Anne Francis is smoking hot? Anyhow, as you can tell I REALLY like this set and highly recommend you buy it. The transfer from film to digital is outstanding in quality and makes this even a better visual experience than when it first came out 45 years ago.

Honey west is a wonderful person that everyone of both sexes would like to have as a friend, but she is a dim shadow compared to Cathy Gail (Honor Blackman) and Mrs. Peel.  She is not smart and does not pretend to be.  Her hand to hand combat skills are poor.  She is frequently overcome by the bad guys and has to be rescued by her male partner.

3477665,3,B001B0H7DG,"The ""Honey West"" 4 single-sided disc DVD release contains all 30 (half-hour) B & W episodes, which ran on ABC during the 1965-66 television season.  Also included are some vintage commercials and several promos for other ABC shows.  The set is nicely made from high quality recordings of the original episodes.

If you are unfamiliar with the show it is like a blend of Honor Blackman's ""Avengers"" episodes and Gene Barry's ""Burke's Law"" stuff.  In fact, the title character and her associate Sam Bolt (John Ericson) had been first introduced to television audiences in the ""Who Killed the Jackpot"" episode of ""Burke's Law"".

It did not approach the imaginative whimsy of Diana Rigg's ""Avenger"" episodes.  It was played pretty straight, putting it a bit behind the times as shows like ""The Wild Wild West"" and ""The Man From UNCLE"" were following ""The Avengers"" down the self-parody road.  This odd disconnect was one reason the series never made it past its first season.

Another problem (obvious at the time even to a pre-teen like myself) was the casting of a high mileage actress like Anne Francis in the title role.  Francis had been tantalizing eye candy back in the 1950's (see ""Forbidden Planet"" and ""Susan Slept Here"").  Unfortunately by 1965 she looked like my Cub Scout den mother, but with too much make-up and a much more tacky wardrobe.  Poor Anne had gotten a little chunky by this time and you felt sorry for her trying to go after the same demographic as the svelte and much younger looking Diana Rigg.  And they wonder why these things get weak ratings.

The half-hour format also hurt the series as there was not sufficient time for either character development or interesting misdirection.  The production design was pretty basic and generally low budget.  They did manage a few gimmicks like a pet ocelot (named Bruce), high tech gadgets, and a nicely understated attraction between Honey and Sam.

Honey is more Cathy Gale than Mrs. Peel, using her feminine wiles and a few judo moves.  Francis and her stunt coordinator were not up to Mrs. Peel's fighting skills so Honey mostly  resorts to a gun.  The action sequences are generally pretty lame, so you can imagine that after a few tries at staging fights the producers decided that it would be a good idea to give Honey marksmanship ability.

Apologies to her sidekick, John Ericson, but the series really belongs to it's star. For me, it was an increasing joy to watch her as a sex doll on the outside, and a delightfully shrewd actress on the inside - charmingly far ahead of the stories she was playing, or the actors with whom she played them. She radiated a very attractive, (natural?) abiding satirical humor beneath the story events, in a way strongly enhancing, not subtracting audience enjoyment. (If it wasn't natural, it was a sadly uncommon acting achievement)

The episodes rip along at a pace quite appropriate to distracting audience attention from the admittedly rapidly written 26 minute storylines of the era. The idea behind the series was to provide never-too-serious fast fun, and with Ms. Francis out front in so many admirable ways past surprising, it becomes smile-inducing warp-speed escapism (which also featured a number of imminently famous guest stars).",1236384000,4,1114,5.149171270718232

As we've grown more accustomed to serious shows of destruction, explosions, and death, viewing this series will remind you of a time when America was more innocent. Honey West is somewhat like a ten-year-old's attempt to describe really serious events. The episodes involve a potentially serious situation but go on to treat it with an optimistic, childlike solution. It's cute, and it's old-fashioned, whole-family-can-watch-it entertainment. Even if you're a guy that has grown to expect Hollywood's current action thrillers, you'll still enjoy watching Anne Francis. She's hot!",1236297600,,931,5.609929078014185
3477669,5,B001B0H7DG,"Two things stand out on this DVD set.  The first is the well-endowed Ms. Francis walking around in her tight black cat-suit and black boots.  The second is something I have NEVER seen before on DVD--beautiful, digitally restored ads from the 1960's, such as the ads for Parliament cigarettes, Prell shampoo, Lucky Strike, etc.  The bright digital transfer of the episodes tends to bring out the cheap sets and production values. This is something that plagues other old shows such as ""Ironside"" and ""The Man From UNCLE"", but which also is part of their charm.  Honey West comes off as more of a cartoon character than a real detective (obvious comparison--Emma Peel of ""The Avengers"") which makes for some fun TV.  A unique show that was cancelled, ironically, because ABC found that they could order episodes of ""The Avengers"" for less money than producing ""Honey West"".",1233964800,5,871,4.938356164383562
3477670,5,B001B0H7DG,"In the early 1960's British audiences were treated to Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman) the beautiful female co-star of the Avengers TV series in Britain. In 1965 just about the same time as Mrs. Emma Peel was introduced into U.S households the beautiful ""Honey West"" (Anne Francis) made her mark as one of televisions first female action / adventure stars in a lead role. The ""Honey West"" character was first introduced in an Episode of ""Burke's Law"" called ""Who Killed the Jackpot?"" where honey outwitted her male counterpart played by Gene Barry proving that she could be as good as any male detective.

Premiering in the fall of 1965 ""Honey West"" was given her own 30 minute television series from producer Aaron Spelling, sadly this show only lasted 30 episodes. Anne Francis was the perfect choice for the ""Honey West"" character she was beautiful, seductive, glamorous and everything her British counterpart Emma Peel was. In an era of television when women stayed mostly in the background or took lesser roles Anne Francis was a pioneer and she paved the way for many actresses who followed.

""Honey West"" following in the footsteps of her late father a top notch investigator in his own right, inherited his private eye firm as well as his old partner Sam Bolt. Even tough the sexual tension between the new partners was evident throughout the series Honey's first and only true love was the thrill of the chase and no man could equal that.

No stranger to hand to hand combat ""Honey West"" wasn't afraid to mix it up from time to time to get the job done. She was an expert at judo and she also held a black belt in karate. Honey also owned an arsenal of weapons filled with cool James Bond like gadgets guaranteed to get results. These neat gadgets included an exploding compact, a garter belt gas mask, teargas earrings and a lipstick microphone, talk about a woman who was ""Dressed to kill"". ""Honey West"" was a fantastic half hour show that definitely paved the way for shows like Charlie's Angels, Policewoman, Cagney and Lacey and countless others.

Presented for the first time on DVD format from VCI Entertainment ""Honey West"" includes all 30 episodes remastered in glorious Black & White. Either the prints used for this release were in great condition to start or VCI thoroughly cleaned them up because this show looks spectacular!  The video image is crisp and clean and the sound is terrific. This incredible 4 single sided disc set with amazing artwork and solid packaging is a must for any ""Honey West"" fan new or old. It's true what they say, Nothings Sweeter than Honey!

3477672,4,B001B0H7DG,"Anne Francis will forever be remembered as Honey West.  Honey inherited her father's detective agency.  With the help of her partner Sam Bolt (John Ericson) they solved 30 cases before ABC cancelled them and sent them to syndication reruns.  Also on hand for support is Honey's Aunt Meg (Irene Hervey) and for security Honey had Bruce, her pet ocelot.

This was a bright fast paced show.  Due to the 30 min (25 w/o commercials) run time, there was little chance for complex plots, red herrings, etc.  Many of the shows were written or directed by future TV greats including Levison and Link who invented many famous detectives including Columbo, Mannix and Jessica Fletcher.

The typical show starts with Honey and Sam on a case.  The case takes an unexpected turn.  Honey and Sam pretty much solve the case before one last turn.  This was a fun show and everyone had their eye candy.

The show also featured many of then futuristic surviellance devices (most will not be perfected for 20 years.)  Look for some future stars and some classic stars.  And it is a hoot to see LA 45 years ago.

The following is list of the episodes with guest stars:

The Swingin' Mrs. Jones -Honey breaks up a blackmail ring that preys on wealthy women.

The Owl and the Eye - Guests Lloyd Bochner and Herschel Bernardi - After Honey and Sam provide a security analysis for a museum it is robbed.

The Abominable Snowman - Guest Henry Jones - Honey uncovers a drug smuggling ring.

A Matter of Wife and Death - Honey and the woman she is protecting is almost killed.

Live a Little, Kill a Little - Guest star Herb Edelman - Honey tries to save the life of the former girlfriend of a mobster.

Whatever Lola Wants - Honey is hired to attend a charity ball with a hired killer.

The Princess and the Paupers - Guest stars Bobby Sherman and Michael J Pollard - Honey is hired to find the kidnapped son of wealth man.  But Honey suspects more is afoot when the ransom is the amount needed for the son's rock band to cut a demo record.

In the Bag - Guest star Maureen McCormack - Honey is transporting a girl between her bickering parents.  But the girl accidentally gets involved with smugglers.

The Flame and the Pussycat - Sam and Honey track down an arsonist but find out there is more than just arson.

A Neat Little Package - Guest J Pat O'Malley - Honey and Sam must find out the identity of man who lost his memory in a car accident.

A Stitch in Crime - Guest James B Sikking - Honey must recover a dress collection that was stolen.

A Million Bucks in Anybody's Language - Honey uncovers a conterfeiting ring.

The Grey Lady - Written by Levison and Link - Guests Kevin McCarthy, Cesare Danova, Pat Collins, Bert Parks - A theif robs a starlets hotel room while she does a TV interview.

Invitation to Limbo - Written by Levison and Link Directed by Tom Gries - Guest Wayne Rogers - Honey and Sam are hired to find out who is leaking top secret information at an electronics company.

Rockabye the Hardway -Guest Joe Don Baker - Honey and Sam try to find truck hijackers.",1227139200,4,3061,4.451438848920863
3477673,3,B001B0H7DG,"Honey West is a product of its time.  During the series initial airing almost 40 years ago, I can easily see how it became a classic cult series.  But time has not be nice to the series.  The production value definitely shows its age and some episodes are difficult to sit through.",1227139200,8,281,4.365384615384615
3477674,5,B001B0H7DG,"If you're here reading reviews of ""Honey West: The Complete Series,"" there's a pretty good chance that the reason you're interested in this DVD can be summed up in two words--""Anne Francis."" There's also a pretty good chance that you're male, that you were born fairly close to the middle of the last century and that you first encountered the lovely Miss Francis starring as Altaira in the 1956 film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forbidden-Planet/dp/B000HEWEDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forbidden Planet</a>.""

If you fit this profile, and, as I did, developed a huge pre-pubescent crush on Miss Francis, you're sure to find ""Honey West: The Complete Series"" a most enjoyable trip back through time. There are other reasons for giving this series a look, of course, such as the clever (for their time) James-Bond-style gadgets, the decent (although not really cerebral) story lines, Honey's 1965 Shelby 289 Cobra and even her perennially irritated pet ocelot Bruce. Or you can look at the series as one of the very few examples--along with Emma Peel in ""The Avengers,"" which began airing on American television at almost the same time in 1965 as ""Honey West""--featuring a strong, smart, sexy and capable female lead. Or you can look at it as pure nostalgia, and let it take you back to a far simpler time of clearly defined heroes and villains, and of pure black-and-white moral choices. But let's face it, Anne Francis is the big attraction for us aging baby boomers. In her performances as Honey, she is just as alluring today as she was more than 40 years ago. With her dynamic screen presence, crisp, no-nonsense manner and complete competence, she is a true joy to watch.

I recommend ""Honey West: The Complete Series"" most highly. Even if you don't fit the profile, you should still consider it. It presents a self-contained slice of television history that laid the foundation for female characters and roles that continue to evolve today. Look at ""The Sarah Connor Chronicles,"" for instance, and you'll see how far things have come from the groundbreaking, genre-bending days of ""Honey West.""",1227052800,10,2143,5.208695652173913
3477675,2,B001B0H7DG,"I wish I could say some good things about this set but, alas, I'm not able. There's a very good reason why Honey West only had one season in before the cancellation notice arrived: It wasn't a very good show.

Lame...lame... LAME.

Anne Francis should have had MOLE-cular surgery. It's not that she's unattractive, she isn't, but it was so distracting!

Another thing is the show was only thirty minutes long which was a death knell for dramas in 1965. There wasn't time to develop characters beyond a superficial point. Even the handsome John Ericson was given little to do. The series degenerated into slapstick, one-liners & bad puns by the last few episodes. It even went into the depths of Batman (the series) when it came to the staging of fight scenes; I kept waiting for the ""bams"", ""oofs"" & ""smacks"" to pop up on the screen.

Honey & Sam had more gadgets than James Bond. They had microphones in makeup compacts & sunglasses, cameras everywhere including one that operated like a periscope in their Econoline van. Yet they would get conked on the head or befuddled in some way. and, PLEASE, when Honey went into disguise the mole was still there, you'd have to be blind or stupid to miss it. I could go on & on but I won't. And to tail somebody in a sub-compact foreign sports car is just too much.

There are the bonus materials of vintage commercials from that era, which doesn't mean much. The episodes are in great shape without barely a hitch in them.

Unless you're a Honey West fan, & I mean a REAL fan, I can only recommend that you avoid this.",1225411200,18,1561,4.498233215547703
3477676,2,B001B0H7DG,"I imagine myself, on a break from Calculus homework on - what evening of the week was that? - watching Anne Francis upon the screen . . . Not quite the visual bliss of ""Forbidden Planet,"" but . . .

. . . sorry, folks, it just doesn't work anymore. The awkward fight scenes, Sam's ineffectual rants at Honey's independence, Honey in action  while Sam listens in via her wired earrings or (aargh!) those folding glasses . . . well, be honest now. It's forced, isn't it? And TV acting and production standards have changed over the years, thank heavens. Plus, you know exactly what will happen next time, and next time, and . . .

But all that would be fine - we'd just have good, predictable, outdated, 60s-style Anne Francis-sexy fun - except that with commercials, we've  got about 23 minutes to set up the crime, create a complication, get Honey knocked down once or twice, have Sam yell at her, and watch them figure it out and catch the crook. It's just not enough time to create a compelling mystery story. All we're left with, really, is Anne and the ocelot, and it's just not enough.

Still, I imagine this show in the mid-60s, the heavy scent of sex hanging in the air as Anne Francis sashays across the screen, the exotic undertone of Bruce - an ocelot named Bruce!? So, even if it no longer works, you gotta cheer for what it tried to be. Hey! At least it wasn't The Brady Bunch! I mean, it **was** Anne Francis, after all!",1225152000,24,1433,4.392452830188679
3477677,4,B001B0H7DG,"Honey West? I'd never heard the name before. I didn't know there was a whole series of novels, and I definitely didn't know that Anne Francis was a groundbreaker for future leading ladies. As I popped in the discs one by one, I was on the fast track to visit 1965 and find out all about The Swingin' Mrs. Jones.

The Episodes:

Truth be told, I didn't even blink at the episodes being in black & white, because I grew up with re-runs of other shows without color, but it took me a little while to get used to the show being only 30 minutes long.

Most of the episodes were pretty formulaic, but I could see the redefined gender roles: Honey would typically do all the investigating, and Sam would do more of the menial tasks like surveillance in the ""H.W. Bolt & Co. TV Repairing"" van. Honey would save the day with martial arts, while Sam would typically get knocked out from behind. Honey West got to change outfits about 2-3 times per episode: whether it was a bikini, an evening gown or a black catsuit, they only served to accentuate her drop-dead-gorgeous looks (yes, I am biased).

I never knew if I'd see a pair of glasses with a hidden microphone, a bottle of sun tan lotion as a homing device, or a garter belt as a gas mask.

One frequent technique I enjoyed were the quick cuts for humor. One minute Sam would be yelling at Honey saying ""You are not gonna do any more crazy things! THAT'S THE..."" and the scene immediately cuts to Honey at a movie theater with an usher saying ""Ticket, please...""

Cameo roles? Well, I noticed Joe Don Baker, Richard Kiel, Dick Clark, Alan Reed (the voice of Fred Flintstone!), a very young Maureen McCormick, a.k.a. Marcia Brady, George Burns in a few cigar commercials, even a robot which appeared in a Gilligan's Island episode one year later!

Okay, how about the box set itself?

(1) First off, this is a space-saver's dream come true. All 4 discs come in a single DVD case so there's no worrying about finding shelf space for this series.

(2) Vintage Commercials:

I was pleased to find over 40 commercials in this box set. From Sylvania's Flash Cubes to Dippity-Do, each of them had me in stitches. The one for Sucrets relieving sore throat pain enough to smoke a cigarette never ceased to make me laugh!

(3) Glamour Shots: This feature is found on the first two discs of the set, showing promotional pictures of the cast as well as a few caricatures.

(4) Hidden Trailers: On the first disc there are trailers for ""Next week's exciting episode of Honey West"" - These are only accessible at the end of the credits of the first 3 episodes.

I can't go on with this review without a little recognition for some people behind the scenes:

(1) Honey's gowns were designed by Nolan Miller, a television costume designer who did work on the 1980s series ""Dynasty"", and ""The Colbys"".

(2) John Ericson's wardrobe was done by Botany 500, a men's apparel line which provided the wardrobe for Don Adams in ""Get Smart"", and several game show hosts such as Bob Barker and Dick Clark.

(3) Joseph Mullendore did the music for the episodes, and his unique dramatic music was also found in the original Star Trek series.

Are there any cons to this box set? There are but a few:

(1) The Vintage Commercials are not listed on any of the discs. Since there were over 40 advertisements, finding just one is impossible - we also have to fast-forward to the commercials we want, they do not have individual chapters.

(2) There is no Closed-Captioning on the episodes. Other shows from the 1960's have captions in their re-runs; I'm not sure why that wasn't done here.

Even with said drawbacks, I enjoyed this series very much. Honey West was a few years before my time, so I never knew Anne Francis paved the way for roles like Jennifer Garner in Alias or shows like Charlie's Angels. If you're a fan of retro television shows like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Avengers/dp/B000CCW2VQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Avengers</a>, You will definitely enjoy this.

With 30 episodes and the extra features, Honey West is a sweet deal.",1224633600,11,4117,4.690277777777778
3477678,5,B001B0H7DG,"I have to confess that I was only 9 years old when this series first aired. But I do recall my family and I watching it each week and enjoying every inch of the show. I was unable to remember any one particular show, but was excited to see it was going to be released on DVD. How happy I am that I made the purchase as the show stands up against time. The prints are nice and clear. The sound is excellent and the plots, great. I recommend this wonderful set to anyone interested in vintage TV shows.",1224547200,5,500,4.0606060606060606
3477679,4,B001B0H7DG,"HONEY WEST was a series starring Anne Francis that was a somewhat successful spin-off from another series called BURKE'S LAW.  It premiered in 1965, and ran for one full season.  On this DVD set we get all the episodes of HONEY's short run.  Originally the show was designed for Honor Blackman, but she declined to do the Bond film GOLDFINGER.  Anne Francis was cast, and the show broke ground for displaying the first female action star to hit the air.  It was a formula Spelling would resurrect many times throughout his career, most notably in CHARLIE'S ANGELS.  HONEY WEST only ran one year because ABC was planning on doing THE AVENGERS, and they worried only one female action star could be on their network at once.  What a pity!

In this set from VCI we get 30 black and white episodes.  The transfers are okay, but we do see some edge enhancement and pixelation now and then.  As for extras we get two photo galleries set to music, vintage commercials, and promotional spots for the show.  There could have been more, but amazing we get all of this in one package in the first place.

Sexy and funny, HONEY WEST is certainly one fans of empowered females will find irresistable.  It's a kick!",1224547200,4,1201,4.582159624413146
3477680,4,B001B0H7DG,"This 1965 series is noted as groundbreaking in pop culture history because it was the first to feature a female private detective (or as the Ideal board game called her, a ""girl private eye""). Tough and independent yet sultry and willowy, Honey apparently inherited her father's detective agency, has a pet ocelot named Bruce and works with a hunky partner, Sam Bolt, whom I surmise from the dialogue in one episode was a marine and from a ridiculous robe he wears in another, a boxer.

Sam's character is standard rough-and-tumble ladies' man issue for the genre and is frequently irritated by Honey's more impulsive decisions. Of course, they have a bickering yet cute relationship that bubbles with over and undertones.

The stories themselves are also garden variety for the period, but nicely written (some by ""Columbo"" creators Richard Levinson and William Link) and well paced within a tidy 30 minutes that never gets padded nor rushed. It's too bad that TV drama no longer seems to utilize that time frame.

Producer Aaron Spelling reportedly launched Honey West in response to seeing The Avengers before it was imported to the U.S. with its iconic Emma Peel character, which ultimately eclipsed this series. The idea of a beautiful, strong female lead who does karate and has some cat suits in her wardrobe is the main similarity, though. Honey's show does not have the surreal, sometimes fantastic approach of the British series, nor does it have the unflappable, relentlessly affable John Steed.

What it does have is the extraordinarily comely Anne Francis, still every bit as memorable as she was in that classic Twilight Zone episode, ""The After Hours."" She is an excellent choice for a TV character that must have been a bit of a jolt to some viewers in 1965 who were used to Jane Wyatt and Donna Reed.  Francis straddles the then-precarious line of being emancipated and in control and yet approachable and disarming. John Ericson, who Disney fans might recognize as the German colonel in ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" or Barbara Eden's love interest in ""The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao,"" is suitably granite-jawed as Bolt, the kind of private eye that might have stepped off a paperback novel cover.

The lead actors seem to have the most fun playing undercover characters. Honey occasionally is ""forced for investigative reasons"" to don skimpy outfits - a standout being a tigerish car hop. Some of her outfits seem sexist by today's standards, but it's interesting to note that, in the somewhat more enlightened 1970s, Sgt. Pepper Anderson frequently posed as a hooker on ""Police Woman"" as a way to get Angie Dickinson into tight fits. It's TV, I guess.

Baby boomers like me will love spotting actors in guest roles throughout the series, many of whom went on to more prominence, including soon-to-be teen idol Bobby Sherman (who sings ""Walking with My Baby""), pre-Marcia Marcia Marcia Maureen McCormick, ""Hill Street Blues'"" James B. Sikking, Miss America host Bert Parks, Joe Don ""Walking Tall"" Baker, Wayne ""M*A*S*H"" Rogers and Dick Clark.

It's also a treasure trove of great character actors, like Howard McNear (Floyd the Barber of ""The Andy Griffith Show), Eleanor Audley (of ""Green Acres,"" ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""Cinderella"" and The Haunted Mansion) and Alan Reed (the voice of Fred Flintstone).

And speaking of ""The Flintstones,"" you can hear Anne Francis herself promote that show in a promo on disc four in which she hawks the ABC lineup for Dallas/Fort Worth Channel 8. It's one of a collection of commercials included on each disc that really sets the tone of the period, with excellent prints of spots for everything from Sweeta, Dippity-Do and Seven Seas dressings to High Sierra After Shave and White Rain hairspray, plus stars like George Burns for El Producto cigars and Edie Adams for Muriel cigars.

Another trivia note for animation fans: the ""Honey West"" theme title sequence, a still photo montage with groovy graphics, was produced by Format Productions, the company that also produced 1961's ""The Alvin Show.""

There is also a nice little set of photo galleries, but sadly, no commentaries. That would make this set totally perfect, but other than that, it's the cat's meow.",1224115200,5,4209,5.007153075822604
3477681,4,B001B0H7DG,"From producer Aaron Spelling, this highly enjoyable series came out just as the TV landscape was heading into a more fantasy-based type of series (BATMAN, BEWITCHED, etc) and consequently didn't last more than a season. That's a shame because it is incredibly enjoyable. There's a decided camp appeal to the proceedings and Anne Francis, (you may remember her as Georgia in FUNNY GIRL), as the delightful title character is a joy to watch.

The packaging for this four disc set is attractive and the bonus features even offer us vintage commercials from the period.

3477682,4,B001B0H7DG,"Every time a semi-intelligent, capable heroine appears on a hit TV show, we're told that now all those old cliched women's roles are passe, compared to Heroine X.

But Honey West was truly one of the groundbreaking TV heroines, way back in the mid 1960s when women were still classified either as housewives or girlfriends, and a sexy woman was usually an evil one. ""Honey West: The Complete Series"" ended up being a pretty solid, unique detective show, with a heroine who definitely broke the mold -- both back in the sixties, and in the current day.

Honey West (Anne Francis) inherited a detective agency from her father, and instead of living off other people's work she dove into it, along with her long-suffering (and very hot) partner Sam Bolt (John Ericson).

As the series opens, Honey attempts to nab a criminal for a client -- the baddies get lonely, wealthy widows and wives into sexual situations, photograph them, and then blackmail them for ridiculous amounts of money. To make herself a target, Honey stays at a luxurious resort and pretends to be the neglected wife of a senator... while Sam pretends to join the blackmailing gang. Of course, it doesn't take long for the bad guys to start catching onto them.

And as the series goes on, Honey and Sam have some interesting problems to deal with, both for themselves and for law and justice and all that -- firebugs, kidnapped pop singers, stolen designer dresses, a horrendously spoiled little girl, a jade owl, jewel thieves, gypsies, a mobster's ex, an amnesiac with way too much money, loads of counterfeiting, psychics, embezzlement, and lots and lots of assorted thieves. There's even one thief who impersonates the one and only Honey West. Now that's personal.

In many ways, Honey West was a heroine ahead of her time -- she was a smart, self-sufficient heroine who was perfectly okay with being feminine, rather than having to be one of the boys. She did martial arts (we even see her practicing at home), wore glamorous gowns, took professional calls from the tub, had a pet ocelot, and had a vaguely James-Bondian array of magical technology (like a garter that turns into a gas mask, or a watch that served as a microphone). Oh, and her partner happened to be not only a technical wiz, but also quite tough and handsome.

It's a testament to Anne Francis that she can make this character seem semi-realistic and likable (although Honey's rotten money sense helps) rather than utterly nauseating. Francis -- best known as the daughter from ""Forbidden Planet"" -- brings a jaunty, sharp-edged energy to Honey, and handles her groundbreaking character without any visible strain. Though Ericson is technically the sidekick, he's more of an equal partner -- handsome, capable, and with a sharp tongue whenever Honey enmeshes them in another weird problem.

The mysteries themselves are pretty solid, classic material -- blackmail, theft, kidnapping and drug-running are the major culprits, although occasionally they become a little too wacky to be believed. They're handled with a deft mingling of the gritty (car chases, truckstop brawls) and the refined (Honey's luxurious apartment), and the mysteries take us to lots of mansions, ransacked offices, museums, boats, woodland cabins and occasionally a catwalk. And of course, lots of disguises and fun gadgets too.

And it's peppered with lots of intriguing twists in the detective work, clashes with the Californian cops, mild comic relief (""Finders keepers?"" Honey muses after rescuing stolen designer dresses), and plenty of table-busting action. Ericson does most of the punching and wrestling, but Honey gets her fair share also (not always convincingly), and she adds some clever twists during the action scenes. For example, one episode has two attack dogs homing in on Honey's distinctive perfume -- until she splashes the bottle all over their master. Guess what happens.

""Honey West: The Complete Series"" has aged quite well since the 1960s -- it may be in black and white, but the solid mysteries and excellent heroine keep it fresh. Nice vintage crime series.",1224115200,,4099,5.025036818851252

It is definitely dated, but allowing for that, the only weak points are that Anne clearly does not do her own stunts, and nor does someone who looks even remotely the same ( you might as well have placed a guy in a wig; I am guessing that they could not find a stunt-person who had Anne Francis's great curves). Some of the villains look more like photo models, so I am assuming that it was hard to get the right males for certain roles.
Overall this is fun; would have been nice to get some Anne Francis or relatives commenting on the series and how she saw it, thats about all I thought it lacked.",1224115200,8,873,4.2023809523809526
3477686,4,B001B0H7DG,"I had never even heard of the show ""Honey West"" until now.  I was expecting something a bit campy with bad acting, but I was pleasantly surprised.  As others have noted, the plots are a bit rushed, but the acting is good and the dialogue is frequently snappy.

I suspect that anyone who was old enough to watch this show when it originally aired will know if they want to buy the set or not.  Others might not be sure.  If you already like shows from the era then definitely don't pass up on this one.  It's dated, but it IS better than ""Gomer Pyle.""  And if you're into the history of TV and how women have been depicted ""Honey West"" will open your eyes.  Before ""Alias,"" there was ""Honey West."" It will make you wonder why there was 40 years between the two shows and there were so few programs with strong female action lead characters.

I can't say this show has turned into my favorite series nor does it bring on any feelings of nostalgia.  But it was interesting to watch.",1224028800,,979,4.300546448087432
3477687,3,B001B0H7DG,"I remember thinking that the title character was a hottie when I was a boy growing up in the 60's.  I couldn't say that I remembered any thing else until I viewed the DVD's.  The series is in B&W, something that caught me by surprise after seeing the cover art: this was, after all, early TV.  The show should have been an hour long for better plot development. As it is, too much is going on in such a short time frame; my 11 year-old son kept asking what was happening throughout the episodes.  The plots are often dated and I never can understand how such a martial arts expert with a panoply of James  Bond equipment keeps needing to be rescued by her sidekick, but in 1965 any sort of independent female detective was a stretch.  The real interest for the 2008 viewer is seeing the tremendous change in the 40+ years.  Did people really drink so many martini's?",1223769600,5,866,4.375
3477688,5,B001B0H7DG,"How cool were the 60's?  If this show is any indicator, the 60's were like, UberCool.  Somewhere between the innocence of the 50's, and the love-ins and be-ins(and sometimes violent protests) of the late 60's and early 70's, were the early to mid-60's.  The country and the world were in a state of transition, and the entertainment of that era reflected it.  Beach parties and Beatlemania was upon us, pop groups became TV stars, and spy shows were played both straight and for laughs.  The one common thread through all of these things was that they were perceived as COOL, at least for their time.

HONEY WEST is a prime example.  I have vague recollections of watching some episodes during its initial run, but it may have been too ""serious"" for my 12 year old mentality at the time.  Looking back on it now, it really was a great show, and Anne Francis was drop-dead sexy in the title role.  Curiously, the show was only a half hour series, and I think many of the stories could have benefited with a longer time slot.  Perhaps the network execs of that day thought it was too lightweight to hold its audience for a full hour.  All I know is that the stories are tightly written, move along at a terrific pace, but are then over before you know it.

In any case, HONEY WEST is truly a rediscovered gem from a bygone era.  The DVDs are crystal clear and sound great, and the packaging is compact and efficient.  Though the shows are almost like a mini time capsule, they hold up surprisingly well even today.  The clothes, the cars, the ""sophisticated"" gadgets, the 60's style karate chops - all make it seem both dated but somehow quaintly cool, like some of the early Bond pictures.  It's a real blast from the past, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who either lived through that decade, or wants to have a look back at when things were REALLY cool!",1223683200,4,1864,4.470414201183432
3477689,4,B001B0H7DG,"Honey West has several attractions.  As a detective show, it covers the basics of a new mystery in each episode, seemingly packing as much into its half-hour format (25 minutes without the ads) as many hour-length shows.  It's got action, if mostly of the most rudimentary kind--rock'em-sock'em fights with karate chops, and a few more elaborate set pieces.  There are spy gadgets, though nothing very exotic: communication devices in sunglasses, surveillance gear, a little knock-out gas, that sort of thing.  It's got attitude, both tongue-in-cheek humor and some early feminist chic--Honey West is in charge, sexy and smart, kicking butt with martial arts while also remaining sweet and hardly offensive to any male insecurities.  And it's got attractive stars, not only the bemoled Anne Francis in the title role but also John Ericson as her partner with the equally pulpy name Sam Bolt, who looks at various angles like Warren Beatty or Kurt Russell, and who seems to be doing a bit of young Brando at times.  There's also Irene Hervey as Honey's Aunt Meg, who brings a homey charm.  And of course there's Bruce Biteabit, Honey's pet ocelot, emphasizing Honey's own feline qualities.

The script formula

The formula for the show is pretty simple.  A typical episode starts with some provocative event, such as Honey stealing a museum artifact, or gunshots followed by Sam jumping through a window and running to Honey's waiting car.  Honey has been hired or will soon be hired to investigate something related to the opening scene.  Honey and/or Sam often gets a job at some crucial location (they seem to never have trouble getting hired!) to do undercover work, during which they sometimes communicate by talking into their fake eyeglasses or the like.  Often Honey ends up in some skimpy clothes or elegant gown.  Almost always Sam does surveillance from his Econoline van, fitted out with a periscope, listening equipment, and monitors to watch from remote cameras.  There's a lot of witty banter, or at least tongue-in-cheek banter, especially between Honey and Sam, and sometimes between them and the criminals who are happy to explain their plans before attempting to kill them.  At some point there is a fight where Honey, often joined by Sam, usually knocks someone out with karate chops.  If it's the last fight of the show, it's topped off with a witty remark or two.  Then there's a brief final scene where it's time to relax or celebrate, often with Sam and Honey going out for dinner.

Some romantic tension between Sam and Honey is maintained, but not much ever comes of it (it is the first season, after all).  Sam is devoted, Honey merely friendly.  They're a team, each backing the other and sometimes taking the lead, though Honey often frustrates Sam by doing whatever she wants despite his worries for her safety.

Guns are of little use.  If someone brandishes a gun, it will usually be knocked out of his (sometimes her) hand, leading to a fight in which Honey will flip the bad guy over by the arm, and chop him unconscious.  Honey and Sam get their share of concussions too--thank goodness they're both quick healers!

A favorite technique to transition between scenes, used about once per episode, sometimes more, is to start a sentence in one scene and finish it in the next.  For example, after Honey and Sam have a tiff, Aunt Meg says to Honey, ""You'd make a nice couple.  Why not get married, then you can fight ..."" [sudden scene change to Sam telling Honey apropos something else entirely] ""... legally, that's the only way to do things, legally.""  Or, as a variation, Sam yells at Honey, ""It's not the first time you shaded the facts!  Are you doing it now?  Because if you're fencing ..."" [cut to scene with Honey watching two people fencing].  Just another fun touch.

The scripts are by a bunch of different people (and there were about as many directors) but are consistent enough in characterization.  The quality of the mysteries varies from pretty good to absurdly silly, but both kinds have their pleasures.

1965

The series has plenty of period atmosphere.  The clothes precede the height of 60s fashion, and Honey's high-class wardrobe is mostly in a less obviously time-bound style, but ""flood"" pants are in evidence, along with thin ties (almost all the men wear them, mostly with suits), a few floral prints.  The decor is more late 50s and early 60s than what the 60s came to be known for.

There are a few attempts to show ""mod"" culture, the clothes, hair, attitudes and dancing--very tame, mild stuff but amusing.  One episode features Bobby Sherman as a rock-and-roller with a substantial acting role.

There are lots of big cars with big engines, many of them convertibles.  Honey's own car is a tiny, very sporty brand new convertible Shelby Cobra, with a Ford 289 engine.

Fans of Gilligan's Island will recognize the lagoon in one episode, along with a few other borrowings in others.

Special features

The special features add to the retro experience.  On each of the four DVDs, separate from the episodes, there are some vintage TV ads such as would have been played during the show, about 50 altogether.  They're for cigarettes and cigars, makeup, perfume, ordinary stuff, along with some promos for the series itself.  All in black and white.

There are also some still photos in a sort of slide show on the first two DVDs.

Guest stars

Since the show only ran for one season it didn't rack up the list of guest stars that many series do, but there are several faces you'll recognize.  Besides Bobby Sherman, there's Dick Clark, a very young Maureen McCormick (Marsha Brady), Wayne Rogers (Trapper John), and a bunch of popular character actors, including Joe Don Baker (CIA agent Jack Wade in GoldenEye) in his first credited role, John McGiver (the friendly Tiffany's salesman in Breakfast at Tiffany's), Michael J. Pollard (Barrow sidekick C.W. Moss in Bonnie and Clyde), and Warren Stevens (Doc Ostrow in Forbidden Planet).

Music

The theme and score is light jazz, with some of the campy lounge style that was used in TV themes of the day.  Lots of sax, muted horns, blaring horns, marimbas, discreet electric guitar, double bass, drums.  Joseph Mullendore (1914-1990), the composer/arranger of the score, worked on many TV shows and several films in the 50s through 1970.  A soundtrack album is available on CD (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/B0009SC7R2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>).

Cancellation

According to Anne Francis and others, despite being up against more popular shows, Honey West was expected to go into a second season, in color, but ABC decided they could buy the US broadcast rights to the British series The Avengers, which had been part of the inspiration for Honey West (along with the more tawdry Honey West books), for less money than making their own series.  Francis said that this might have been a blessing for her, as she had a four-year-old child at the time and found the intensive schedule of a TV series very taxing.

Picture/sound quality

I'm with the crowd who thinks this one is good in black and white.  It fits the noir detective aspects and keeps the limited production values of a mid-60s TV show from being even more obvious.

The picture quality is pretty good.  If you look closely, it's pixelly, with lots of ""jaggies,"" some moire, but it probably looks better than it did on a lot of TVs when it was broadcast, with pretty good detail and contrast, not oversharpened.  The prints are clean, with only the occasional speck.

The sound is generally good clear mono, out of sync in a few places, but not too badly.

Where are they now?

The stars of the series had careers in both film and TV before their TV work well kept them mostly on TV.  (It used to be that film producers just wouldn't hire TV actors.)  I hadn't seen them lately and got to wondering whatever happened to them.  Here, for the curious, is what I found (updated for 2011).

Anne Francis did some movies and a *lot* of TV roles after Honey West, including a reprise of that role for a revival of Burke's Law in 1994.  She had what was supposed to be a major role in Funny Girl in 1968, but most of it (and much else) was cut to focus more on Streisand.  In 1970 she wrote, directed and produced a short art film about rodeo life called Gemini Rising (shown at festivals and on PBS), but it didn't open doors for her in those professions.  That same year she became the first single woman in California to adopt a baby.  She published an autobiography in 1982,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Voices-from-Home-An-Inner-Journey/dp/0890873402/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Voices from Home: An Inner Journey</a>, that focuses on her personal development and includes accounts of spiritual and paranormal phenomena.  She pretty much retired from acting by 1999 (her last and only other film role was in 2004) and lived in Santa Barbara, California.  At her website (annefrancis dot net) she posted monthly newsletters, several of which dealt with her bout with lung cancer in 2007-8.  (Those old webpages can be found by the web-savvy via the internet archive at archive dot org.)  She died of pancreatic cancer on January 2, 2011, age 80.  Time did a fine memorial, ""Honey from the Forbidden Planet: Remembering Anne Francis (1930-2011),"" which can be found online by searching the title.

John Ericson lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he has been active in the theater, served on the state film promotion board and, lately, acted in local film projects.  After Honey West he, like Francis, did a few movies and lots of TV, until 1989.  After a long hiatus from film, he costarred in a small independent film, Birthday, about a young woman and a dying man, and had a supporting role in the wild (and critically panned) feminist Western&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Far-Side-of-Jericho/dp/B000Q677EU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Far Side of Jericho</a>, both made in 2006.  In 2008 he appeared in an episode of the TV series Crash.

Irene Hervey was already through most of her career when she appeared on Honey West.  Between 1968 and 1981 she did a few more TV episodes and a couple movie roles, including radio station owner Madge Brenner in 1971's Play Misty for Me.  She worked as a travel agent in her later years, taking advantage of the travel benefits to go around the world to see her son, singer Jack Jones, perform.  She died in Woodland Hills, California, in 1998.

According to Ralph Helfer, the animal trainer who provided them, Bruce the Ocelot (Bruce Biteabit) was actually several ocelots of more than one subspecies.  I was unable to discover their later careers.

Honey's Cobra (the car, serial # CSX 2540) is alive and well in Indiana, currently owned by Joyce Yates.  After being lent to the show, it was reportedly sold in 1966 by Shelby American as a used car for $3,900.

In sum

Honey West is fun.  It's good light entertainment, a for-the-time unique feminist twist on the detective show, with attractive stars, a little mystery, a little action, some gadgets, some clever dialogue.  Not always top-drawer, but still enjoyable even when coasting.  Moonlighting fans will find many of the same attractions here.",1223251200,15,11369,4.9640211640211644

Watching the actual Honey West episodes was fun, but never overly engaging. You do get every Honey West episode here though. All 30 half-hour episodes are spread across 4 DVDs. That might be enough to recommend the DVDs for fans of Honey West. But the extras make this a great addition to my personal DVD collection.

Besides the publicity stills shot for Honey West, each DVD is filled with vintage commercials. These were great fun. Every commercial is in black and white, just like the episodes. There are makeup ads, packaged foods ads, cigarettes ads, ads for other TV shows. Every disk has a new set of vintage commercials from the 60s. There's a cool cigar ad featuring George Burns on disk 3. I also really enjoyed the ad for a the local Dallas ABC affiliate on disk 4 starring Anne Francis, aka Honey West, promoting the entire evening line up.

Honey West is a detective, but that's about all the resemblance to the Perry Mason TV series.  While Honey West is entertaining and a fun look back at 1960s TV, the story lines didn't grab or engage me as much as Perry Mason.

3477694,4,B001B0H7DG,"Reading the other reviews it seems all's been said.
Sometimes in intense detail. So, just a few comments

Honey West, the pert, sexy-for-the-60's private-eye girl who was 'way ahead
of her time. Anne Francis was perfect for her character. You'll be surprised at
her athletic abilities and applaud how she manages to walk the line between the
60's TV vision of women and the judo-tossing tough-talking sports-car driving
LA PI. It's interesting seeing how far TV action/crime series have come, while recognizing how much today began back then.

The format's virtually the same for most all 30 episodes. The crime, the chase, the gruff cops, the humorous (maybe then but tame now) comments, the clues, the fights, the off-beat characters, finally revealing and trouncing the villains. Just like today's series, only in back & white, set against an LA very different from today. It's really 'cool' to see those classic cars rolling down nearly empty LA streets. And the super-sprayed hair styles. Pop art, leering men calling women girls, coy comments, hippies and some plots and dialogue to peg those naive yet emerging times.

A caveat: Don't do the marathon-watching thing, seeing episode after episode
straight through. You'll notice the the same sets with minor revisions with
plots and characters that are remarkably similar. Logic is regularly ignored,
editing often careless and acting, well... pretty stiff and corny. Many episodes
have men in gorilla, bear or robot suits, or there just to leer at the snugly-
leotarded Honey.

Each disk in the series offers 'vintage' TV commercials that are interesting on their
own. Hair sprays, cigarettes and cigars, laundry detergents and facial creams. Ads too have changed alot, while in some ways staying basically the same. Like, maybe, everything else.",1223078400,2,1803,5.206896551724138
3477695,4,B001B0H7DG,"As a long time fan of the spy type genre, I had high hopes for this 1960's series, which lasted for 30 episodes.  My favorite show of all time is Get Smart, which was filmed around the same time in color (Honey West is in B&W).  Anne Francis (Honey West) plays a Private Invesigator who along with her partner Sam Bolt (played by John Ericson) solve tha cases of missing treasures and mysterious identities.  It is entertaining enough, but it isn't quite up to Get Smart's standards.  There are plenty of fight scenes in high heels and sparkling jewelry and high speed car chases in classic cars.  There are enough entertaining moments to keep you interested.  If nothing else, it does open the door for other female spies and PI series such as Alias.  So as a 60's series goes, it is enjoyable and worth watching especially if you are a fan of shows like Get Smart and Alias.",1223078400,2,876,4.471698113207547

The gadgets are cool and the stories are pleasantly breezy.  I'd always mention this to friends who claimed that empowered women came to TV at a later time, and now I have proof.  And Anne Francis goes right up there with Raquel Welch and and Ann-Margaret as one of the most charming and gorgeous stars of the Sixties.

This series is a lot of fun and Anne Francis is great to watch.  The remastered picture and sound quality are quite impressive for a series this old.  Only a scant few shots are very grainy at times, but overall the episodes look very good.  While the Photo Galleries and Vintage Commercials are a nice touch, it would have been even more fun to include interviews and/or commentary tracks with Anne Francis herself.  She no doubt would have shared a lot of insightful stories that went on during the filming of this classic series.  The show itself has a nice blend of action, drama, and tongue & cheek humor that's fun and exciting.  In one scene, where the ""bad guys"" fall into an electrified pool of water, a man asks Honey, ""Are they dead?""  Honey slyly replies, ""No, just stunned.  Electrocution is illegal in California.""  Pick this series up and rediscover Honey West all over again.

3477698,5,B001B0H7DG,"This is a spectacular DVD set of 1960s television series Honey West, similar to Rockford Files but with a difference. The show stars Anne Francis as a private investigator who works with a male partner named ""Sam"" (John Ericson). She runs her late father's Los Angeles detective agency with such gadgets only to be seen in a James Bond movie; tear gas earrings, a radio transmitter disguised as a martini olive or a pendant necklace and many other forms of electronic devices. Honey is not only sexy and glamorous, but also proficient in karate and judo and not afraid to use a firearm to defend her-self. The first episode, ""The Swingin' Mrs. Jones"" establishes the show's cool vibe and cult appeal in which she goes undercover as a society matron to quash a blackmail ring that preys upon wealthy women. In the episode, ""Whatever Lola Wants...."" Honey is hired to escort a man to a charity ball; unaware that he is a murderer. She gets caught in a scam involving the horse racing. Ultimately with the help of her partner she manages to catch the bad guys. In the episode, ""The Princess and the Paupers"" Honey is called by the father of a kidnapped rock musician for help. First it appears as a publicity stunt, but turns into extortion and a murder mystery. In another episode, Honey saves young girl when she is lost at the airport (""In the Bag""). This cleverly plotted half hour black-and-white episodes feature witty dialogue, jazzy scores and great action. In 1965, when Honey West premiered, spies and detectives rivaled cowboys in popularity. Honey was the first female detective with her own series, the first season aired 30 great episodes and they are available in 4 DVDs (one set). Supporting role is greatly provided by Sam; he usually sits in the high-tech surveillance van talking to Honey via a radio. Their relationship was kept platonic, and professional, in spite of this the show gets better and better as you watch all the episodes from beginning to end.

3477699,5,B001B0H7DG,"From VCI Classic TV comes the little-known and short-lived 1965 series, Honey West, starring Forbidden Planet's Anne Francis as the unflappable girl detective; John Ericson as her indispensable partner, Sam Bolt; Irene Hervey as Aunt Meg; and Bruce the beauty-cream-eating ocelot as himself.  The set consists of 4 single-sided DVDs packed in one standard-size keepcase.  The collection contains all 30 half-hour adventures (all of which are in black-and-white), but does not include the episode of Burke's Law that first introduced the Honey West character.

Honey West is sort of a female version of James Bond who deftly fights off blackmailers, counterfeiters, gorillas and giant robots with a devastating barrage of karate chops and judo flips before escaping in her slick AC Cobra sports car.  She and her assistant, Sam (who's always monitoring the situation from the H.W. Bolt & Co. TV Repair spy van) utilize a limitless array of clever gizmos like walkie-talkie sunglasses, wristwatch cameras and smoke bomb earrings to gather evidence on the bad guys.  Most of the adventures require Honey to work undercover as anything from a nurse to a Hollywood stuntwoman and there's always a surprising plot twist at the end.  The shows are endlessly entertaining, even when some of the plots get a bit far-fetched toward the end of the series.

Throughout these fun-filled episodes, you'll see many noteworthy guest stars, such as: The Bad Seed's Henry Jones in ""The Abominable Snowman;"" Hazzard County sheriff, Roscoe P. Coltrane (James Best) in ""A Matter of Wife and Death;"" teen idol, Bobby Sherman, in ""The Princess and the Paupers;"" Marcia Brady (a.k.a. Maureen McCormick) in ""In the Bag;"" Invasion of the Body Snatchers star, Kevin McCarthy, in ""The Gray Lady;"" Mayberry's own Floyd the barber, Howard McNear, in ""A Nice Little Till to Tap;"" James Bond's steel-toothed nemesis, Jaws (Richard Kiel), in ""King of the Mountain;"" Alan Reed, better known as the voice of Fred Flintstone, in ""Don't Look Now, But Isn't That Me;"" a trampoline-jumping Grandma Walton (Ellen Corby) in ""Come to Me, My Litigation Baby;"" Marvin Kaplan (Henry from the popular 70'sTV series, Alice) in ""The Fun-Fun Killer;"" and TV icon, Dick Clark, in ""There's a Long, Long Fuse A' Burning.""

Aside from a couple of slideshow-style photo galleries, the chief extra in this collection is a nostalgic smorgasbord of vintage commercials that ran when the program originally aired.  Isn't that wild?!  I wish all classic TV DVD sets included this feature.  Amid these classic ads are pitches for revolutionary products like Intensified Tide (dirt can't hide from it); Sylvania Blue Dot flashcubes; Sweeta artificial sweetener from Squib; and the first ever soft margarine from Chiffon--so soft, it comes in a tub.  Other innovative items spotlighted include Hunts Steak House Catsup; a delicious lineup of creamy salad dressings from Seven Seas; NEW Carnation Instant Breakfast and Coffee Mate non-dairy creamer, the creamer that needs no refrigeration.  You'll also learn about a new filtered formula of Breck hair set mist, as well as a hairspray from White Rain that claims to be ""the holdingest"" due to the little umbrellas in the spray...of course if all else fails you could try the Dippity-Do setting gel.  Men are reminded to put a sword in their razors with Wilkinson before using the High Sierra Ice aftershave by Mennen...and don't forget the Old Spice deodorant stick, it goes on fast and it's never sticky.  Non-smokers may cringe at the sight of a cold sufferer eating a Sucrets to soothe his sore throat so he can smoke yet another cigarette (maybe he should try a naturally mild El Producto cigar, endorsed by the legendary George Burns).  There's also a plethora of promos for TV shows like The FBI (starring Ephram Zimbalist, Jr.); Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea; 12 O'clock High; The Legend of Jesse James; and A Man Called Shenandoah.  All these commercials are enough to put you under a spell not unlike the spell of Chanel.

If you're particular about classic TV detective shows this is a show worth fighting for.  You'll flip for Honey West!",1222646400,6,4139,5.078171091445427
3477700,4,B001B0H7DG,"I wasn't sure how a show like this would hold up, especially knowing that it aired almost two decades before I would be born. Honey West is a whole lot of fun, with the lovely Anne Francis busting the mold of what women on TV could do. The episodes are quick and entertaining. Nothing too deep to be found here, but you will find yourself coming back for more. Even if you don't like a particular episode, Anne Francis is always fun to watch, if you know what I mean.",1222473600,6,467,4.2
3477701,5,B001B0H7DG,"I turned 11 in 1965, the year of Honey West's broadcast premier. I was, at the time, intensely conscious of being on the cusp of puberty and was therefore very interested in the appearance of those popular young-adult female celebrities of the time whose appearance I hoped to emulate. And at that time, we had some kickin' ladies to look up to--much cooler, if I may say so, than what's out there now.
In addition to the ""dolly birds"" of The British Invasion (Jean Shrimpton, Jane Asher, Patti Boyd, et al.), we had the formidable home-grown talent I came to think of collectively as ""The Adorables,"" whose ranks included the likes of Lee Remick, Yvette Mimieux, Donna Douglas, and, of course, Anne Francis. None of these non-anorexics were megastars (Miss Remick came closest), nor did they measure up to the almost frighteningly gorgeous likes of, say, Elizabeth Taylor and Ava Garder. But in a way, The Adorables had something better going for them because not only were they...well...adorable (and sexy), but they seemed accessible and human as well--so much so that I managed to not grow up with too much of a complex, even though I didn't have a hope in hell of ever looking that good. In fact, they were so pleasant to watch that you couldn't even begrudge them their adorableness, plus they conducted themselves like ladies rather than witless, drugged-out sluts with toilet mouths. Ah, the good old days...
Always a sucker for nostalgia, I was happy for the chance to view and review this short-lived (one season) blast from my past  which, research discloses, was based on a series of novels written in the late 50's and early 60's. I remember watching Honey West in the sixth grade on Channel 7 in Detroit (ABC), including at a sleep-over party with classmates, which indicates that it must have run on Friday evenings. Not only was it an exciting show with neat plots, but Honey had a PET OCELOT named BRUCE!!! How cool was that?!
Anywho, back to the show. The 30 half-hour episodes (not all of which I've watched at the time of this writing) are clever, stylish, and loads of fun, spread out over four DVD's and looking and sounding terrific in this restoration. This is before color TV really took off, so it's in black & white. Extras include some really nice  stills of Miss Francis (who I always thought should lose the mole) and quite a few vintage commercials in which no one seems on the verge of engaging in sex. My few complaints include one I have a tendency to beat to death: no hard-copy chapter index. In addition, every once in awhile, the sound and visuals seem very slightly out of synch and finally, the mispronunciation of the surname ""Mainwaring"" in the first episode is a tad irritating. Other than that, it's not only a sweet trip down Memory Lane for us B-Boomers, but younger viewers might enjoy it as well--viewing a sexy show with class is certainly a worthwhile alternative to video games.
A beautiful, single, independent, heterosexual lady P.I. who practiced judo and karate, had a successful career, a hot partner, AND a pet ocelot--between Emma Peel and Honey, is it any wonder that I ended up ranked in four martial arts (including two black belts) and the owner of an early-generation Bengal? Television provided some worthwhile inspiration in those days and I think this puts to paid the nonsense that positive female role models in entertainment didn't exist prior to the women's movement. Pop some popcorn, hunker down on the sofa with your kids, and watch Honey do her stuff--maybe your daughters will end up inspired to acquire a black belt or two of their own as they make their way through life.",1222473600,4,3648,4.752365930599369
3477702,4,B001B0H7DG,"The 1965 detective-action series, ""Honey West,"" starring Anne Francis, is an iconic pop culture touchstone for many retro enthusiasts, hipsters, and fans of old classic TV (including many viewers who were around to see these shows when they were first broadcast...)

The series is stylish and lighthearted, features a fair amount of buxom T&A (generally accompanied by great Mod-era clothing) but it also packs enough of a punch to qualify as a legitimate action show.  One of Aaron Spelling's earliest productions, and has an interesting relationship with his later hits, particularly ""Charlie's Angels,"" which also featured vivacious female crime-fighters.  Unlike ""Charlie's Angels,"" however, ""Honey West"" didn't hinge solely on the perceived glamor of its female lead -- the stories are generally straight crime dramas, and the series' noirish feel is greatly enhanced by the black-and-white cinematography. It's not the greatest TV show ever, but it's fun and a great time capsule of 1960s pop culture.  If you enjoy ""Mannix,"" ""The Avengers"" or ""Perry Mason,"" you might want to give this a spin as well.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1222387200,9,1145,5.374301675977653
3477703,4,B001B0H7DG,"I've never heard of Honey West or her TV show until it was offered up on Amazon Vine. Like a couple other products there, it's one I likely wouldn't have gotten had it not been on Vine, and like the others, I'm glad I did!

The TV series centers around Honey West, a gadget-carrying PI with a sidekick named Sam and an ocelot named Bruce. It's clear which of the two is more important to her.

These four discs contain all 30 episodes of the series and, impressively for someone living in an era where a half-hour show is actually twenty-two minutes, these episods actually run the full thirty minutes! It makes me wonder how they managed that run time with commercials (several classic ones are included on these discs, incidentally).

Anne Francis is entirely entertaining as Honey West, looking comfortable and unflappable no matter what she's doing, be it getting a suntan, driving a car or stealing a sculpture of an owl. Sam provides nice backup and does all the sidekick duties with a reasonable degree of skill. The presentation isn't terribly over the top and stands up generally well even now (though the incidental music kept making me flash back to other 1960's shows, like ""Bewitched"", ""Gilligan's Island"" and ""The Brady Bunch"").

The show isn't perfect. It gets a little camp at times, and the cases Honey solves don't always require a lot of brain power to see through. Still, the show is very fun, very lighthearted and very enjoyable!

You get all 30 episodes on these discs, plus the vintage commercials I mentioned. Additionally you get some behind the scenes footage. Not a huge number of extras, but not bad for a one-season show canceled 42 years ago, and at this price, if you even THINK you might want it, you should buy it!",1222300800,6,1748,4.680781758957655
3477704,5,B001B0H7DG,Great show. I enjoyed it today as much as I did when it first came out. Anne Francis is great in this role.,1222300800,2,107,3.6956521739130435
3477705,5,B001B0H7DG,"I can remember 1966 on Friday Nights watching Honey West and having my first television crush.
Anne Francis was so beautiful.
Really enjoyed the show 42 years later but what I didn't remember was Honey West episodes were only 30 minutes long.
This show was a Trailblazer in the fact that Honey was a Judo chopping, Smart, Sexy,Private detective before The Avengers hit the airwaves in the States One Year Later.
Just wish the show lasted more than one season.
To THINK in Honey West's time slot the competition was Gomer Pyle.
GOLLLLLY!
Honey West was very stylish and cool and would make an interesting Retro movie.
Would be very curious to see who'd be in the title role.",1222214400,2,673,4.663865546218488
3477706,5,B001B0H7DG,"Younger generations may not remember that, at one time, Anne Francis
('Forbidden Planet', 'Bad Day at Black Rock') was widely considered
to be the dishiest doll on the block - with the most famous mole
this side of Cindy Crawford - and this short-lived TV series pretty
much guaranteed her a spot in the Male Baby-Boomers Hall of Fame.
This TV series actually didn't need to run any longer than it did
because, like most of its episodes, it made its point fast and clear.
There's a lot of retro fun to be had here and VCI is to be commended
for making this show available to what-will-surely-be a new generation
of Francis fans.  Honey West kicked some serious butt and managed to
look extremely fabulous doing it.  No wonder producer Aaron Spelling
would, ten years later, times Honey by three and call them 'Charlie's
Angels.'  Actually though, you can really see the influence of this
show on the '80's series 'Moonlighting'.  And while male lead John
Ericson (who was also Francis' co-star in 'Bad Day at Black Rock')
is no Bruce Willis, this series had more charming erotic innuendos.

3477707,3,B001B0H7DG,"Long before ""Veronica Mars"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" this 1965-1966 TV series tried to present a woman who was both feminine and able to hold her own with tough guys. Fast-forward 40-odd years and this early attempt seems dated, almost tame. For example, Honey can't stand the sight of a dead body. Even if she killed the guy herself, she has to seek comfort on Sam's shoulder for a moment or so. Whether someone intuited the necessity of this conceit or perhaps even tested it on audiences, they somehow decided that folks wouldn't accept a female character who had steeled herself to the reality of death. Only villainesses could get away with that. A woman's equality with men was not just limited in those days, it was inconceivable. So it is not easy to remember that even with her nods to convention, Honey West still went further than women had before this on U.S. TV. (We in the U.S. had yet to discover British TV's Emma Peel.)

Since action scenes are a significant aspect of ""Honey West"" let us say that TV fight scenes have gotten better since then; although I think perhaps ""Honey"" was part of that process; possibly, the fight scenes improve from the first to the last episodes of this show. (I think there remains plenty of room for improvement especially on TV.)

There was more to a TV series in those days. Today there will be only 20 to 22 episodes per season, whereas in those days more than 30 was the norm. So in that respect you are going to get your money's worth from ""Honey West."" Being yet another guy who was going through puberty when ""Honey West"" was on, I found this a real trip down memory lane. Anne Francis still appeals to my (long since) formerly adolescent libido.

This show was on during the first era of households with two-plus TVs, which was why I was able to watch ""Honey West"" on the small TV while my father watched ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C."" on the big TV. Most of the country watched ""Gomer"" instead of ""Honey""; no doubt this contributed to the demise of ""Honey"" after only one year, even though I'll bet her absolute number of viewers was higher than CSI's today. But those were the days when networks could treat audiences almost as captives; the idea of cable as we know it, or ""pay TV"" as the idea was called back then (cable systems in those days had been used mainly in remote areas where mountains and valleys prevented reception), was still on the horizon and its implications for viewer choice were not fully understood.

The features on the disks in the ""Honey West"" set are not essential but they are amusing. The galleries of still photos give an edge to glamorous nostalgia and the commercials...these old commercials bring back memories while at the same time making me think, ""Didn't they look slicker back then? Aren't these just bad parodies of what I used to watch?"" What must people who don't remember the sixties think of these ads? The (unintentionally)funniest one is the ad in which the man takes Sucrets throat lozenges so that when his sore throat has been relieved, he can now light up a cigarette. It is obvious that nobody connected with this ad saw any irony in it.

If you remember ""Honey West"" fondly, this DVD set might teach you that you can't go back and find a show to be exactly the same as you remembered; nevertheless, I wouldn't have wanted to miss this opportunity to see it again.

8280854,5,B001B0H7DG,"ANNE FRANCIS' personal charisma was so captivating that even if the show had no story line or other actors, I wouldn't notice!  As ""HONEY WEST"",  Anne was the first female detective to have a leading title role in a TV series.  No doubt her cool persona and black belt inspired the future detectives Emma Peel (The Avengers) and the Girl From UNCLE.  The beautiful and talented Anne Francis won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Emmy for her role as Honey West.  And considering Anne's multitude of loyal fans, her series certainly deserved a longer run.",1517529600,,560,4.673469387755102
