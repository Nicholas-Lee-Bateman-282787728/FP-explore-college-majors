This is YC in a more jazz trio setting than is usual. He is amazing as usual. His band mates which include Thiago do Esprito Santo on bass guitar, hang with him well. This isn't my favorite band setting for YC. His recent group recordings are more arraigned but this is an amazing trio of improvisers.",1463011200,,493,4.369565217391305

8383269,5,B000CSUNH0,"What can I say about Cesar Camargo Mariano, just that his piano playing is unique. This is my Oscar Peterson, my Bill Evans in Brasilian Music. I started enjoying Cesar when he recorded with his late ex-wife Ellis Regina, o my!!!

Now he has realesed several recordings latly, such as this one with singers of the profesional level of Leny, antoher fantastic production with Leila Pinheiro and brasilian guitarrist Romero Lubambo.
