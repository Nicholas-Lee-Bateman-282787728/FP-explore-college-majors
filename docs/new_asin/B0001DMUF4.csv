1991993,4,B0001DMUF4,"Like her fellow detective fiction writer Ngaio Marsh, Margery Allingham developed a number of plots involving actors and/or artists.  Allingham's debonaire sleuth has a different background, than Marsh's Allyn or Sayers' Wimsey. Although of somewhat noble birth, he was born on the `wrong side of the covers' and his name does not reflect his pedigree. The name Campion is taken from a small white field flower that he sometimes wore in his buttonhole.

Unfortunately, this and other bits of trivia are missing from these DVDs, because the BBC videos are missing `Mystery Theater' hostess Diana Rigg who introduced the stories to PBS viewers and related additional information about the background of the protagonist and his sidekick valet-sometimes house maid, the former house breaker and very talented Mr. Lugg.

The second season includes episodes that feature: 1/ the royal claims of the Pontsbright family to a newly formed country in the Balkans also of interest to the Nazis; 2/ Evil happenings involving dancers and death;  3/ Murder at a publishing house; 4/ Mobsters and Turkish smugglers.

Like Christie, Allingham excelled in the creation of plots and her characterization of Campion (played by Peter Davison -- `All Creatures Great and Small' and ""At Home With the Braithwaites) and Lugg are well done. Some of the peripheral actors are also well developed and many of faces are familiar.  The episode `Sweet Danger' introduces the woman Campion will eventually marry, but only those who read the series or saw the PBS presentation will know that bit of trivia.",1105833600,17,1575,5.181102362204724
1991994,5,B0001DMUF4,"The second series of Campion is every bit as wonderful as the first.  Why, oh why were there only two?! Ah, well.  We have eight amazing episodes to watch over and over on DVD (sixteen, I suppose, if you count each half as an episode), and there are certainly worse things.  I should start off by mentioning that the order in which they've advertised the stories on the side of the box is WRONG.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.  As they were originally presented in 1990, ""Dancers In Mourning"" was the first, followed by ""Flowers for the Judge,"" ""Mystery Mile,"" and THEN ""Sweet Danger"".  Do NOT watch ""Sweet Danger"" first -- it must be saved till last.  Trust me!

Now, on to the episodes themselves: ""Dancers In Mourning"" is my personal favorite of the four, tied in my book with the first season's finale, ""Death of a Ghost"".  It (Dancers In Mourning) deals with a series of murders that occur within a group of actors performing in a musical, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat till the very end.  And there is a sort-of-romance for Campion on the side, to boot! This one is not to be missed.

The sophomore episode, ""Flowers for the Judge,"" is the story of a murder that occurs at a publishing company.  Although parts of the story seem just a tad contrived (and here I am referring solely to the jury process in the court scene - horrific!), it's a good story.  Plus it has a terrific ending.

Number three, ""Mystery Mile"" (the name of a seaside town, as it turns out) is another captivating tale.  Its plot is complex and I hesitate to give too much away anyway, so I'll leave it ambiguous and intriguing by saying merely that it involves a magician; quicksand; visiting ""Americans"" (read: good British actors employing atrocious accents and almost managing to make themselves look bad, and one of whom incidentally is a doppelganger for Topher Grace).  And, best of all, there is Campion in a sailor hat.  (*Homer Simpson-esque gurgling noise*)

Finally, there is ""Sweet Danger.""  ""Sweet Danger,"" which leaves so much to be desired -- not because the episode is bad, quite the opposite; but because it breaks off Campion's story just where you MUST KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT!!!  (Footnote for those who have seen it: I was later informed that the character of Amanda Fitton was supposed to be a teenager.  Who knew?)

And last but not least, I feel it is my duty to review Peter Davison.  Ahh, Peter Davison...what can one say? He manages somehow to be even lovelier and more charming than in the first season, and this is no mean feat.  This man has the funniest, sweetest smile on earth.  If for no other reason, watch this series for that!",1105574400,36,2654,4.560253699788584
1991995,4,B0001DMUF4,"Peter Davison and Brian Glover as the Golden Age detective Albert Campion and his 'varlet' Magersfontein Lugg, are terrific. The screenplays follow the books, which is great. The action is somewhat slow but more than makes up for speed by quality of actors portraying secondary characters. All of Agatha Christie fans would delight in the series. The quality of DVD is poor and could have been bettered by making an effort especially at the price they are charging (even with Amazon Discount). Highly recommended for the lovers of British Mysteries. Ms. Allingham has been called rightly, a shining star.",1097798400,9,604,5.111111111111111
1991996,2,B0001DMUF4,Not worth the time. There is no CC or subtitles. Hard to  understand Brittish accent. Thunbs down!.,1093910400,11,99,4.823529411764706
1991997,4,B0001DMUF4,"Although I enjoyed reading all of Margery Allingham's Albert Campion series, I wasn't sure if I'd like the film series.  Sometimes the characters and ambience that are in your mind as you read are so different from those presented by putting them into three dimensional reality.  I needn't have hesitated, however, since Peter Davidson's Campion and Brian Glover's Lugg are just as I imagined them.  While the latter would be a fairly simple character to enact, the former is by no means easily captured.  The Campion in the stories is a complex character, slightly foppish and light hearted, like Lord Peter Whimsey, yet no ones fool.  Davidson gives the character just the right blend of wittiness, intellect, and affability.
Each of the stories in the collection are a treat for anyone interested in period settings, and the 1920s and 1930s are among the more enjoyable.  The architecture, furniture, automobiles, clothing, make-up, and hairstyles encapsulate the era beautifully.  The mysteries themselves are quite clever and entertaining.  A lovely visit to a pleasant time and place and interesting people.
Of this foursome I enjoyed Flowers for the Judge, about a murder in a publishing house, the most enjoyable, with Sweet Danger the dearest of the set.  Dancers in Mourning seemed to wander a little like it was having trouble finding its solution, and Mystery Mile seemed a little too contrived and melodramatic.  Still all four are worth watching more than once just to spend time with the characters.",1088985600,27,1514,5.117886178861789
1991998,5,B0001DMUF4,"If you enjoyed Campion's first season you will probably love this season. Well at least if you like some thriller action. The first season was a little lofty and whimsical. This season draws you into intense intrigue and action from the start. The first movie finds Campion allying himself with a couple chums to ferret out a great mystery. They must determine why a wealthy gangster is trying so hard to grab up items that will prove the heritage of an heir to a small but mineral rich kingdom in Europe. I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole episode fearing the worst for his new found romantic/intellectual interest.
The second movie finds Campion investigating two murders at the theater.  Campion must investigate an interesting group of performers that make you suspicious of them in one way or another. The third movie has him investigating how a man was murdered and locked into a strongroom at a publishers vault. The coroner's findings shed some light on the case, but make it difficult not to jump to conclusions. The fourth movie is mystifying and interesting and we are given puzzles like a maze leading to a missing person, quicksand that is not forgiving, and a frightening revelation when one of the ladies is kidnapped. The criminal behind it is cunning and Campion must keep his wits. This was a very exciting episode and I enjoyed it and the first one in the set the most.
Great production values as usual with the same high quality standard for detail in the sets and costumes. All in all a excellent addition to your DVD collection. A must have for any that bought the first season. After seeing this set I only wish they had made more seasons of this wonderful series. Ashame how often when a series finds its legs they pull out the rug from under them.",1085011200,50,1784,4.610062893081761

The mysteries are in two parts.  I suggest watching both episodes together to maintain the flow of the story.  If you like Peter Davison try watching The Last Detective.

Watching this on my Kindle fire let's me take the time to really absorb the stories, some improbably funny, and also to spot actors who appear in more current programs. There's no gore, no sex and no special effects, just a romping good time solving mysteries.",1424390400,,484,4.987654320987654

We only watch British DVD'S, and we tried hard to like Campion, but we just couldn't finish the set, because they were so inane, and unbelievable.  Such a pity.

The plots can be uneven but if you love those old time period British country house murders which are as cozy as a mug of hot cocoa and Oreo cookies on a cold winter night before the tv, you'll like Campion. Its been around a long time and some of the plots don't wear too well. But overall they're long on great character acting, atmosphere and their insights into the British upper class of the 1920s or so. Worthwhile watching.",1418947200,,561,4.73469387755102

1992107,3,B0001DMUF4,"Not bad, but not all that good, either.  The earlier series with Petherbridge was better, and followed the books more closely.  The final episode of this season is one of the worst ever--plot makes absolutely no sense as Campion leads a small group of semi-arisocrats into a den of armed villains and emerges (of course) victorious.  The whole season is bland and a disservice to the original material; better off just re-watching Morse or etc.",1415059200,,444,4.8933333333333335
1992108,5,B0001DMUF4,Excellent early 1900's mystery series set in England.  Variety of interesting plots and characters.  Campion get much more personally  involved with the people he is helping than the traditional male British consulting detectives of that era.

1992136,3,B0001DMUF4,"I give three stars because I enjoyed the previous season so much and like the basic premise of the series.  Season 2 disappointed in that the Campion character became petulant and ""unpleasant"" as the season progressed.  He ended the season crippled in a wheelchair which pretty much represents the health of the second season.",1410393600,2,326,5.018518518518518

This is a wonderful series, while some episodes are better than others they all are a delightful.",1410393600,,316,5.3
1992138,5,B0001DMUF4,"We love Campion.  We always enjoyed Peter Davison in ""All Creatures"" back in the 80's as Tristin Farnan. Campion is a whimsical throwback to the 1930's with a serious story each time. We're only sad that only 2 seasons were made, and they were based on the author's stories, Margery Allingham. We especially enjoy Lugg, although his heavy accent provides a challenge, and unfortunately these DVD's don't have close captioning on the menu, a feature we usually depend on when watching British shows, because even their expressions are unfamiliar in the USA.  This is clean material, unlike ""The Last Detective"" series, which we threw out because of filthy vulgar language and video. Peter really went downhill on that one. Must have Really needed a job to stoop to that. His character was ok, but being a part of the show itself disappointed us.  Again, Love Campion, and a really great performance by Peter Davison.",1410048000,,915,4.928571428571429

1992153,4,B0001DMUF4,I turned to Campion when I could not tolerate another dynamic hero or explosion.  He is the civilized alternative.  Of course the background of the English countryside helps create a calm atmosphere into which the viewer can step.  This is not award winning stuff but viewers need a place to relax and enjoy. There is humor and plot enough to justify your watching.,1406764800,,365,4.761904761904762

1992171,5,B0001DMUF4,This is our third time to watch this series. Love the classy campion and his companion Lugg. They make a great team when solving mysteries. Lugg works with the downstairs staff while Campion mingles with the upper class. Love the theme music. Have noticed that with all the BBC mysteries the theme music is perfect for each series.

1992182,5,B0001DMUF4,Am giving 5 stars even though I have not watched much of it yet. I assume it will be a great at Season 1. British storytelling at it's finest. Subtle humor. Classy background of the 1930's. Interesting characters. Found it by accident through Prime membership and will watch all episodes eventually.,1401235200,,299,4.882352941176471

1992199,5,B0001DMUF4,"Good writing and better character development really pushed the second season of Campion. There was actual fighting in this season, where Campion goes in to fisticuffs with Lugg and together they fight the bad guys even in quick sand. The elegance of the period, the contrast of those ""in service"" and those ""of wealth and substance"" is well done and relationships better explained by more crisp and clear writing. Good show that had come of age.",1400112000,,446,4.881578947368421

1992222,4,B0001DMUF4,"This is a charming series. I first watched it more than 20 years ago and I think it's held up very well. Peter Davison and Brian Glover both give performances that more than do justice to the characters from the pages of Margery Allingham's marvelous novels.

1992228,5,B0001DMUF4,The in-depth story line and near perfect casting are characteristic of both season one and season two of 'Campion'.  Everything is true to the period (late 1930's) and the plot lines are all designed to keep you guessing.  Great entertainment!,1394841600,,243,5.05
1992230,4,B0001DMUF4,"Campion is presented so very charmingly that you become  engrossed in the characters and pay  little attention to the actual murder.

1992233,5,B0001DMUF4,"In typical BBC fashion, the Campion series is intelligently written, beautifully staged, and performed so well, you fell as if you are there in 1930s England. The plots are always interesting and unique. Too bad there were only 2 seasons available.",1394064000,,248,5.073170731707317
1992234,5,B0001DMUF4,"Some may think Campion a second-rate copy of Peter Wimsey, but these stand very well on their own, thank you.  Magersfontain Lugg is an entity unto himself - Sayers never came up with anything like him!",1393891200,,202,4.611111111111111

1992239,4,B0001DMUF4,"This is a marvelous series from the UK that lasted two seasons and was subsequently broadcast on US TV. Adapted from the book series and short stories of Margery Allingham. Created as a parody of Dorothy L. Sayers famous detective Lord Peter Wimsey, the aristocratic Albert Campion (a pseudonym) and his butler, major domo, former burgler, and man Friday Magersfontein Lugg, manage to get themselves in and out of trouble while assisting deserving victims, damsels in distress, and  representatives of Her Majesty's interests in matters dark and mysterious. A romantic look at the time between the wars in Great Britain wonderfully written and wonderfully acted by Peter Davison, who later went on to play Tristan Farnon in All Things Bright and Beautiful and was the fifth Doctor Who,  in the title role of Campion and Brian Glover as the ever present and always useful Lugg. If you like Downton Abbey, you will appreciate Campion.",1393113600,,932,5.045454545454546

I envy the actors their opportunities to sit behind the wheels of such delightful vehicles.",1392940800,,302,5.02
1992241,5,B0001DMUF4,I moved very quickly through these old Campion episodes.  Had seen some years ago but didn't mind seeing them again.  the screen scripts were right on target for the wonderful work of Allingham.,1392940800,,194,4.848484848484849

1992249,5,B0001DMUF4,"Campion is such a genteel character he makes his adventures relaxing and enjoyable, as well as challenging.
It's a treat to unwind with this series because one is not constantly treated/bombarded with ""adult"" language or situations.",1391817600,,232,5.472222222222222

1992271,5,B0001DMUF4,This show is really good.  The mild mannered way that Campion goes about solving crime is humorous but there is also drama,1391299200,,122,4.545454545454546

1992280,4,B0001DMUF4,I like this show because it is a bit off beat.  Peter Davison (my favorite Dr. Who) does a wonderful job in his role as Albert Campion.  He brings a lot of charm to the character.  I also love like the 1920s background of this series.,1389225600,,234,4.043478260869565

1992282,5,B0001DMUF4,"""Sweet Danger"" in two parts starting season 2 is one of the best, if not the best of all the Campion series - full of intriguing and sometimes humorous twists and turns, Campion is at his best in getting to the core of the mystery and the discovery of that which will legitimize Young Hal's claim to the throne of Lavernia.  It's also when he meets his later to be become wife, Amanda, the perky redhead who shares in his adventures in later years.  If you are a fan of Campion and haven't seen this, be sure you do!  You'll love it.",1389139200,,533,4.205882352941177

1992285,5,B0001DMUF4,"The opening was changed to a kind of ghostly looking appearance of Campion & Lugg in the roadster superimposed on something that looks like a tangle of pale vines, the theme was changed to a more traditional 30s wah-wah sounding coronet (?)(not being critical on the wah-wah sound) and the season opener was at times hard to follow and incomprehensible.  The story about the publishing family was a little hard to follow as well; I didn't quite get the relationships and their significance.  The theater story was fun with a twist at the ending.  Albert Campion looks much older in this season, falls in love more often and engages in more fisticuffs.",1388880000,,651,4.794642857142857

1992359,5,B0001DMUF4,"Watching this second series of Campion again, gave even more pleasure, than the first time, some years ago. The emphasis is on the light touch, the humorous approach, with which the this English Gentleman Detective unravels the puzzles coming his way. The length falls between the lengthy multiple episodes granted Carmichael's early Lord Peter and the single hour allotted many of the later BBC series. This 2 episode format gives sufficient time to build up some of the supporting roles but not enough for the leisurely pace of the much more expensive multi-episode productions. The compromise a very popular show like Poirot was able to achieve, with both single episode and movie length treatments, apparently was not available for this two season relative failure. At any rate we have Peter Davison doing a distinctive and delightful Campion, with his man, Lugg, played by Brian Glover, equally fulfilling, as his ex-hooligan man-servant and accomplice in crime-solving. Each episode offers a historical setting, early and mid-thirties in this volume, with scenic design up to the standard expected from BBC. Similarly, supporting players are always accomplished although occasionally the role calls for a period foppishness which might seem weak to current eyes. I find both this and the previous, Set One, quite entertaining, with all the class of such outstanding TV as we were given in Morse, Poirot, Miss Marple, Sherlock Holmes, and the other top BBC offerings. Both sets are highly recommended for the classic detective story fan and for most general viewers, other than those who need bang-bang action, sexually charged, fare (which do have their place-but never in this particular sub-genre).",1327795200,,1706,5.2988929889298895

As in season I, these are all in two parts but with either the DVD, if you're a collector, or the streaming video you don't have to wait for part 2 as we did when it was being broadcast.

As in Season 1 you'll find 4 stories divided into two parts each for a total of eight episodes. In Season 2 the opening was revised but other than that you will find familiar ground as Campion solves the mysteries with the indispensable help of Lugg.

1992369,3,B0001DMUF4,"I adored the first season of Campion, and have been eagerly awaiting this season, but was a bit disappointed in it.  Yes, Peter Davison is just as superb as ever, in his role as the mischievous and charming Campion, as is Brian Glover, his wry and unusual manservant Lugg, but I think my main complaint is that the focus of this season is on action, and not so much characterization.  Campion is still very much an enigma, and I was looking forward to getting to know him better, but that didn't really happen.  I think this series would have definitely benefitted from another season more in line with the first one - with an emphasis on character, especially to include Amanda Fitton, who was enticingly introduced to us only to leave us in the lurch.  Those who have read the books know that Campion will marry her eventually, but it would have been lovely to see that play out!

My other major complaint is that in two of the episodes - Dancers in Mourning and Flowers for the Judge - have been filmed in such a way that half the time the actors heads are cut off, and all we see are their mouths moving at the very top of the screen!  I was relieved that Mystery Mile and Sweet Danger (definitely my favorite episodes of this season) do not share this defect.

This series is still very good.  Even a disappointing Campion is better than much of what passes for ""mystery"" nowadays.  If the first season made you crave more thrills and adventures, than you might very well prefer this season.",1176163200,32,1496,4.470588235294118

I watched the Campion series on PBS' ""Mystery!"" when it first aired - I was only a young teenager, but as a life-long anglophile, not to mention sucker for 1930s mysteries, I was absolutely enamoured.  I awaited a re-run of the series (to no avail), but finally we have Mr. Campion and friends on DVD!  Peter Davison (""All Creatures Great and Small,"" ""Dr. Who,"" ""The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries"") is pitch-perfect as upper-class sleuth Albert Campion, and Brian Glover is incomparable as his manservant/sidekick, Lugg.  As with all BBC productions, all details of the series are impeccable, and the scenery is positively delicious.  (The Dower House, not to mention the Manor, in ""Mystery Mile"" is particulary stunning.) Unlike many of his literary peers, Mr. Campion possesses great wit, and uses it disarmingly, even in the most stressful of situations (for instance, when the Bad Guys are practically upon him - hardly a time for anyone but our hero Campion to be cracking wise! -- most people just can't carry that sort of thing off, dontcha know...).  Even that other high-tone sleuth Lord Peter Whimsey can't match Mr. Campion!  Sit back, watch the adventures of Campion, and have a spot of fun!",1137628800,15,1525,5.163265306122449

8010775,5,B0001DMUF4,"""Campion"" Series 2 first aired on the BBC in 1990 in eight 55-minute episodes that constituted four mysteries based on novels by Marjory Allingham published between 1930 and 1937. ""Mystery Mile"" is the last mystery of this series but was only the second book in the Campion oeuvre. I was skeptical of Campion's characterization at the beginning of Series 1, but Peter Davison has grown into the role and I like him here. Campion has a flippant demeanor that can be off-putting, but some depth is evident in this series. Campion resists the label of ""gentleman"", even mocking the concept, but he shows himself to be very much the gentleman in ""Dancers in Mourning"" and ""Flowers for the Judge"". His misanthropic manservant Magersfontein Lugg (Brian Glover) is insolent and enjoys making Campion dance to his tune as much as vice-versa. He's generally unpleasant. Campion's friend, Inspector Stanislaus Oates (Andrew Burt) is absent entirely from ""Flowers for the Judge.""

I found ""Dancers in Mourning"" and ""Mystery Mile"" to be the best mysteries of this series. The writers didn't quite capture Campion's crisis of conscience when he removed himself from the case on account of being attracted to the suspect's wife in ""Dancers in Mourning"". ""Stanislaus, I don't want to be involved,"" he says flatly. I think this is one of the best mysteries, but a short voiceover might have helped the audience understand Campion's feelings when he discovers the identity of the murderer, especially since voiceover is sometimes used for no particular reason. Why not use it where it's needed? ""Mystery Mile"" is Campion's most dangerous case, in which he faces off against the head of the Simister gang, a criminal mastermind who is a sort of Moriarty to Campion's Holmes. ""Sweet Danger"" is preposterous in a charming way: impoverished would-be aristocrats, loopy village doctor who practices witchcraft, feisty young female sidekick, and send-up of a butler.

I still wonder why Campion's old school friends and family friends, who must have known him by his real name, always call him ""Albert"" without ever slipping. By the end of this series, Peter Davison's Campion had endeared himself to me, and I appreciated the humor more than I did the first series. ""Campion""s humor is as odd as his pseudonyms and living arrangements -sometimes mocking, sometimes silly. It's unfortunate that only eight mysteries were made into films, as Allingham wrote eighteen Campion novels.

The mysteries are:

""Sweet Danger"": Campion and Lugg travel to the small East Anglia village of Pontissbright. On the way, they pick up Jonathan Eager-Wright (Valentine Pelka) and his friend Augustus ""Guffy"" Randall (David Haig). Campion has been engaged by Whitehall to prove that Averna, a small country in the Balkans, is British territory due to its historical rulers, the Earls of Pontissbright, none of whom are living. But there was an illicit marriage of Giles Pontissbright that resulted in a child, quickly disowned by his aristocratic family. Campion is to prove the marriage took place and prove the Earl's dominion over Averna. So it is off to Pontissbright with Eager, who became involved while hiking in the Balkans, and Guffy, where they meet the impoverished Fittons: comely Amanda (Lysette Anthony), Mary (Sally Spencer-Harris), and young Hal (Christopher Haley), the claimant to the tile. But Brett Savanake (Iain Cuthbertson) aims to beat Campion to the evidence.

""Dancers in Mourning"": Campion is asked by Inspector Oates to investigate a series of pranks directed at Jimmy Sutane (Ian Ogilvy), star of the musical ""Over the Moon"". Lugg is stationed backstage to intimidate the culprit, while Campion pokes around. Sutane invites Campion and Lugg to his home, where he is rehearsing a new show. Among the residents and guests are Jimmy's wife Linda (Pippa Guard), with whom Campion is immediately taken, his younger sister Eve (Nina Marc), overprotective masseuse Miss Finny (Gabrielle Lloyd), composer Squire Mercer (Nicholas Chagrin), jealous understudy Benny Konrad (Philip Dupuy), and an older actress determined to revive her career, Chloe Pye (Patricia Brake). Jimmy Sutane runs into the house late in the evening, screaming that he's killed Chloe. She fell off a rusty bridge in the middle of the night, in her bathing suit, landing right under the wheels of Jimmy's car. But she was dead already.

""Flowers for the Judge"": Campion is invited to Sunday tea at the home of Gina Brande (Amanda Royle), wife of publisher Paul Brande (Terence Beesley), cousin of Campion's friend Mike Barnabas (Neil Daglish). They are joined by cousins Ritchie Barnabas (Barrie Ingham) and John Barnabas (Robert Lang), who is senior partner in the family's publishing business. No one has seen Paul Brande since Thursday, but his wife dismisses it as one of her husband's ""lightning dashes."" On Monday, Brande is found dead of carbon monoxide asphyxiation in the publisher's basement ""strong room"". But Mike was in the vault on Sunday and should have seen the body. The press is rife with speculation of an affair between Gina Brande and Mike Barnabas, motive for murder. Campion believes Mike innocent and sets out to prove it, focusing on a centuries-old manuscript by playwright William Congreve, which is the property of the publisher and which Paul wanted to publish.

""Mystery Mile"": On a transatlantic ocean voyage, Campion saves the life of American Judge Lobbett (Brian Greene), who is traveling with his adult son Marlowe (Gary Parker) and daughter Isopel (Lisa Orgolini) to escape death threats in New York. In London, Marlowe visits Campion to ask his help in protecting the Judge from the Simister gang, a criminal syndicate. Campion finds the perfect hiding place in the country home of young friends Sir Giles (Andrew Castell) and Biddy (Elinor Morriston) Paget, who need the money they will get from letting their home to the Lobbetts. Judge Lobbett thoroughly enjoys the famed English culture. On the Lobbetts' first night at the house, an ""itinerant palmist"" stops by to tell their fortunes. Then the kindly Reverend (Geoffrey Bayldon) commits suicide. The Judge disappears while exploring the garden maze the next day. And a badgering art expert, Mr. Alistair Ferguson Barber (Robert Robinson) has come to appraise a painting.",1521158400,,6314,5.184313725490196
