8703177,5,B00TUPPHK4,The dvd arrived in perfect condition and faster than I had expected too! The only bad thing was that it was the wrong region code for my dvd player but that was my fault not the fault of the seller. So after a much needed new DVD player we thoroughly enjoyed the dvd! We had already seen the movie several times but didn't have our own personal copy but now that we do we watch it at least once a week cause Lemmy is AWESOME!!!!,1454112000,,428,4.047058823529412
