8531203,5,B008VR7UG6,3 Fantastic films from il maestro Fernando di Leo. Very entertaining films - Great quality video and audio. Well done Raro video!!,1395446400,3,130,4.954545454545454
8531204,4,B008VR7UG6,"these films combine cuteness and violence the way only the Italians seem to be able to do. The combination of the old man with the kitties in a basket setting off violent murder in""shoot first die later"" was priceless.the other two films were also violent and memorable(and bizarre).",1393718400,5,283,4.916666666666667
8531205,5,B008VR7UG6,"I own volume one of this collection of Fernando Di Leo on blu ray, which has much better movies.  Even so, this one will be a must purchase for lovers of Italian cinema.  Raro releases are by the far the best Italian dvds and blu-rays I have seen, and this one has an extra for each of the three films (usually a making of documentary, but there are a couple of more extras).  The image quality and sound are phenomenal, and even the worst of these movies fascinates simply because of the pacing and cinematography.  Luc Merenda is always great in these movies -- a top notch actor.  Highly recommended.",1383350400,7,603,4.445454545454545
8531206,4,B008VR7UG6,"While not really beeing quite as awesome as the first volume the second one still comes highly recomended. Both newcomers and genre fans should definitely check out this collection of Fernando Di Leo crime titles. These are great blu-ray releases of great movies and for a good price at that.

If you love these kind of swinging 70's crime movies from italy you should most definitely pick both this and the first volume up. This is a great buy!",1379980800,8,445,4.632911392405063
