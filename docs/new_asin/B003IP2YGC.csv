8397604,3,B003IP2YGC,"Having just finished viewing and listening to the performance from the Teatro Reggio, Turin, of Cila's opera, ""Adriana Lecouvreur"", I find it to be a worthy and interesting performance and production and I consider myself lucky to have come across it and to possess it.

The costumes in the Turin theatre's production are perhaps the most beautiful and sumptuous of any on the numerous DVDs and Blu-ray discs available. The staging, spare but not ugly or inappropriate in any way, works quite well, although the multiple articulated, mobile raised platforms in the First Act did not always make obvious sense as they shifted positions on stage. Turin's Teatro Reggio clearly does not have the huge stage and bountiful resources of the Teatro alla Scala, in Milan, or of some of the other leading opera theatres in the world (e.g., the Bolshoi or the Palais Garnier in Paris, to take the most humongous examples!), therefore grandiosity would not befit its theatrical proportions. Those who conceived the production found good solutions to make the most of the space on the Reggio's stage available and not to permit things to become too congested; that could have been a real danger in the third act, was which is handled as deftly as any of the opera's tableaux. The ballet is acceptable, neither better nor worse than what one usually sees, a darkly reflecting surface at the rear creating a striking effect; the choreography and its realisation are no match for La Scala, that's for sure, nor is it handled so well as in in R.A.I.'s film of the mid-1950s that features Marcella Pobbe in the title role!

Since some other DVDs already are being mentioned by this point, and will be further on in this review as well, it is a good idea to present a list of them, for the reader's easy reference. Aside from the Turin production, which is at the head of the list with all of its principal and some of the secondary roles listed more fully, the DVDs of the opera (in the North American or U.K. release editions which I own, showing, for the video of the Turin production only, also the Blu-ray release number) are listed by alphabetical order of the conductors' last names (all in capital letters to facilitate displaying and finding them), naming only whom the most notably accomplished vocal soloists, in my estimation, who are among the casts (even if that results in listing the roles unequally from one citation to the next):

Adriana Lecouvreur. The principal and other noteworthy vocalists are Micaela Carosi (soprano, in the title role), Marcelo lvarez (tenor, as Maurizio), Marianne Cornetti (mezzo-soprano, as the Principessa di Bouillon), Alfonso Antoniozzi (baritone, as Michonnet), Simone del Savio (bass, as the Principe di Bouillon), and Luca Casalin (tenor, as the Abbate di Chazeuil); chorus and orchestra of the Teatro regio, Turin, conducted by Renato PALUMBO (DVD + ill. partly col., but mostly b&w booklet of 30 p., of credits, synopsis, and notes + promotional catalogue, together in the same container). ArtHaus Musik 101-497. N.B.: The release on Blu-ray is ArtHaus Musik 101-498.

Adriana Lecouvreur. The principal solo vocalists are Angela Gheorghiu (soprano, in the title role), Jonas Kaufmann (tenor, as Maurizio), Olga Borodina (mezzo-soprano, as the Principessa di Bouillon), and Alessandro Corbelli (baritone, as Michonnet); chorus and orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, conducted by Mark ELDER (2 DVDs + ill. booklet, of 39 p. of credits, synopsis, and notes). Decca 074-3459-DH-2.

Adriana Lecouvreur. In series, La Scala Collection. Among the cast are Mirella Freni (soprano, in the title role), Peter Dvorsky (tenor, as Maurizio), Fiorenza Cossotto (mezzo-soprano, as the Principessa di Bouillon), and Ivo Vinco (bass, as the Principe di Bouillon); chorus and orchestra of the Teatro alla Scala, conducted by Gianandrea GAVAZZEINI (DVD + booklet, of 30 p., of credits, synopsis, and libretto, in Italian, untranslated, together in the same container). Opus Arte OA-LS-3011-D.

Adriana Lecouvreur. Among the cast are Montserrat Caball (soprano, in the title role), Jos Carreras (tenor, as Maurizio), and Fiorenza Cossotto (mezzo-soprano, as the Principessa di Bouillon); recording of the live performance in Tokyo, 20 Sept. 1976; Gianfranco MASINI conducts the Union of Japan Professional Choruses and the N.H.R. Symphony Orchestra (DVD + [1] leaf of [2] p., together in the same container). V.A.I. (i.e., Video Artists International) 4435.

Adriana Lecouvreur. This one is a music film, i.e., a cinematic (but still faithful) treatment of the opera, made for television broadcast (first aired 26 March 1955). Among the cast are Marcella Pobb (in the title role), Nicola Filacuridi (tenor, as Maurizio), Fedora Barbieri (mezzo-soprano, as the Principessa di Bouillon), Otello Borgonovo (baritone, as Michonnet), Carlo Badioli (bass, as the Principe di Bouillon), and Gino di Signore (tenor, as the Abbate di Chazeuil); orchestra and chorus of the Radiotelevisione italiana, Milan, conducted by Alfredo SIMONETTO (DVD + folder of [1] leaf fold. to [4] p., of notes about the performers). Immortal (I.M.C. Music) IMM-960025.

If it were not for Renato Palumbo's often leaden conducting and at times too slow tempi, the whole show in Turin would have attained a level of excellence that it did not reach. It really does help, one should know, to have a conductor with real taste, imagination, and grasp of effective leadership in opera, like Gianandrea Gavazzeni (La Scala), Alfredo Simonetto (R.A.I. film version), or even Mark Elder (Royal Opera, Covent Garden). The first act, especially, drags and thus droops needlessly due to unduly slow tempi. Palumbo manages some sections with real delicacy, but at other times he does not hone orchestral balances effectively enough to make the most of Cila's lovely orchestration.

The real star of Turin's evening in the theatre is Marcelo lvarez, who sings Maurizio. He has a voice of real distinction, up there with (each in his own way) Kaufmann and Carreras. He most reminds me of Peter Dvorsky (in La Scala's cast), but lvarez has a much finer, truly beautiful voice. However, Dvorsky and lvarez are both about as ugly-looking as two wildebeests afflicted with severe cases of the mange; that would help, if anyone really were in doubt, to put Carreras and Kaufmann, both dashingly romantic, at the top of the tenorial heap, being the best-lookers who happen, as well, to be the finest singers of them all.

Micaela Carosi is a good Adriana, even if she looks a bit too much like Barbra Steisand in need of just a little dieting. She does not have the musical or dramatic imagination, however, of the best video Adrianas, e.g. Pobbe or Caball. Carosi's voice is a bit ordinary (but good) sounding but with the heft and projection needed. She is worth seeing and hearing.

Those portraying the small comprimario roles are pretty dreadful, alas. The caterwauling resulting from too much vibrato (downright wobble in most cases) and screech among these minor cast members, and some bad intonation among them, make the big ensembles in bustling Act One pretty hard to endure. However, there are not too many stretches in the opera where this prevails sufficiently to count too unduly against the Turin Blu-ray (or DVD). The most important of the comprimario roles, that of the Abbate di Chazeuil, on the other hand, is well done here. Luca Casalin, in portraying an older abb, like the more youthful Abbate di Chazeuil of Gino del Signore (R.A.I. film), is manly and avoids preciosity or hints of any ""gay old queen"" male dopiness, as the other abbs on the DVDs listed have portrayed him.

Alfonso Antoniozzi, as Michonnet, after a weak start while his voice is warming up during Act One for its better form later in the opera, is quite effective. It is hard to choose objectively, apart from sheer vocal finesse, among those who sing that role. My own favourite is Otello Borgonovo (with Pobbe for R.A.I.), whose dramatic quirkiness is so endearing and who absolutely sings better, indeed impeccably well, compared to any of the others in that role on any videos (or LPs or CDs, for that matter) in my experience. Of the other Michonnets, it is mostly (although not entirely) a matter of taste which among them one rates most highly for either drama or for the singing.

Marianne Cornetti, as the Principessa di Bouillon, most reminds me of Olga Borodina in looks and, somewhat, in sound. She acts better than Borodina, but it is Borodina who has the better voice. My two favourites as the princess are Fedora Barbieri, truly sublimely effective in the part, and the younger Fiorenza Cossotto (in the performance with Caball and Carreras that Simonetto conducts). Cornetti, at any rate, is a real asset, being, along with lvarez, one of the best two solo vocalists in the Turin production's cast.

For most collectors, if one must choose only one of these available DVDs or Blu-rays of Cila's ""Adriana Lecouvreur"", it probably would be either the La Scala or Tokyo performances, although my own favourite, despite its early vintage, old-fashioned (but potent!) acting style, and Immortal's poor technical work, is the R.A.I. b&w film of the opera. For most viewers, however, La Scala puts on the best show with a good enough cast that will please mightily. For all of that, however, the Turin production makes an excellent second or third choice for those who may want to own more than one video of this jewel of the ""verismo"" period's great operas.",1431561600,,9550,5.059085133418043

8397606,2,B003IP2YGC,"I have over 100 opera and ballet DVD/BR's that I watch on a projected screen about 7' 8"" wide and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the left and right speakers are about 9' 6"" apart. The room has sound treatments. The goal is to make the viewing experience as if I was there in a middle seat in one of the front rows.

The picture quality is good, as is usual with a Blu-ray.

The DTS-MA 7.1 track has a soundstage not much wider than stereo, voices come mainly from the center, surround is used little.
The orchestra is recorded o.k. However, although the singers wear mics., 3 of the 6 principal voices (Carosi, Alvarez and Cornetti) distort at louder passages (another reviewer called it ""rough in tone"").
The voices are also a bit too loud relative to the orchestra.
There are 2 audio engineers given for the recording and 2 for the mix.
My guess is that one of the two responsible for recording got it wrong and recorded his half too hot.
I can't recommend this one.
The DVD with Dessi/Borodina/Larin from Milan (a recording from 2000) has better DTS 5.1 sound than this Blu-ray.
The Blu-ray with Georghiu and Kaufmann is also a better choice audiowise.",1327449600,3,1169,4.535545023696683
8397607,4,B003IP2YGC,"This is another BD I have bought , exploring opera (hate to think how many I have), and especially, exploring some of the lesser known opera houses that can be found in Europe. For many parts of Europe, it is mandatory that a reasonably sized city has its own opera company, and there are many fine singers that move around the various companies, and still not quite ""live out of a suitcase). But, unfortunately, are quite often only known to dedicated opera buffs in the English-speaking world. Much to our loss!

Here, in Australia, we had an operatic expert supremo, John Cargher (spelling?), who was well know internationally. He had a radio program for something like 40 years, called, ""Singers of Renown"". This was his favourite opera (I think, even above the Ring!!!!), and it is a total mystery that it is so little known. It is as passionate, beautiful, and melodic as anything Puccini wrote, and is based on a reasonably solid libretto.

This production doesn't use realistic sets, but an abstracted (rather than ""abstract"") one which melds with the lavish period costumes. And the performance? I have not given 5 stars (I wish I could give 4 1/2) as the singing, although excellent, beautiful and very passionate is slightly (and I mean slightly) rough in tone on occasion. However, the cast, orchestra, designers, conductor etc., all worked with a united approach to presenting the opera. In  these days of video releases, where cameras can get close-ups, the performers really must act, to make the whole thing work. (In fact, on a large projection screen, and good surround sound, you get a better viewing of the opera, than any-one in the audience. But you do need a screen at least 100"", and good surround sound system).  And this production Works! It is an opera that needs slightly older performers than we see in productions with Netrebko, Villazon, et al., and the slightly older, and slightly plumper performeras look exactly right (that's in addition to singing and acting). If you like Puccini, then don't hesitate, buy this one. It is not likely that anything better will appear for years. As is usual for blu-ray, the image is sharp 16;9, and the colour depth is excellent, even though the muted colours of most of the elaborate costumes don't always make this apparent. Sound is exactly what we expect these days. Production was recorded in 2009 in Turin, Italy.",1324944000,3,2388,4.85995085995086
8397608,3,B003IP2YGC,"I have viewed the DVD of ""Adriana Lecouvreur"" and I found it quite well done, on the whole. The main singers were quite competent. I especially liked the lead tenor (Maurizio - Marcelo Alvarez), Adriana (Micaela Carosi), Michonnet (Alfonso Antoniozzi) and the Abbe (Luca Casalin). They all had well focused intonation without excessive vibrato and had good quality. I thought that Alvarez, with his ringing Italian tenor voice, was exceptionally good in his role. I was somewhat less pleased with the princess (Marianne Cornetti), whose vibrato was somewhat wider and not always centered right on the actual note. However, she seemed to improve as the Opera proceeded.
If you don't insist on Pavarotti, this recording will be a fine addition to one's Opera collection.
