5691987,4,B00C6WHSRI,"A hard core crime thriller about survival being a undercover cop and  his rise in the underworld  and decisions he made to keep his cover and deal with a dirty superior. This movie remind  me of other films previously made like the Departed and Deep Cover,but the slick direction and crafty editing turns this movie into a violent and thrilling roller coaster ride that will keep you guessing until the conclusion,this movie and Johnnie To's Drug War are currently the best crime thrillers out there to me right now! Both are must haves in your collection!",1376956800,,556,4.770833333333333
5691988,4,B00C6WHSRI,"What if criminals organized themselves like corporations?  'New World' starts with that premise as a power struggle ensues upon the death of the chairman of the organization that resulted from uniting three factions.  Very interesting dynamics as heirs apparent scheme to take the top spot.  Throw in an undercover cop who is no longer sure of his identity and ambitious and ruthless police chief who wants to control the top dog at any cost, and a tightly constructed drama-thriller is born.  Superb acting by all players.  Apparently this is a part of a trilogy, and a prequel might be in the works soon.",1376524800,,606,4.844660194174757
5691989,3,B00C6WHSRI,"""New World"" is a Korean gangster film with plenty of twists and turns as well a healthy helping of unrated-style violence. The head of the Goldmoon crime syndicate is dead, leaving his two lieutenants to vie for the top job. Seizing the opportunity, the police launch an operation called ""New World."" The boss' right-hand man, Ja-sung, has been an undercover operative for eight years, under surveillance by Police Chief Kang. With a baby on the way and in mortal fear of being exposed as a mole, Ja-sung is torn between his duty and honor as a cop and the fiercely loyal gang members who will have his back. Using inside information from Ja-sung to damage the relationship between the two feuding contenders, the police fuel suspicions that a traitor lives in the gang's ranks. Ruthless Jung escalates the game by hiring hackers to search the police database.

""New World"" borrows elements from many American gangster movies: sharply dressed thugs, elaborate funerals, endless stakeouts, cryptic meetings with informants, and shoot-outs. The film is shot with style by Park Hoon-Jung and features some good action sequences. Ultimately, however, the gangsters are depicted as pretty stupid, raising doubts as to their ability to survive on those mean streets.

The Blu-ray release is in Korean, with English subtitles.",1374883200,2,1319,5.158878504672897
5691990,5,B00C6WHSRI,New World is a classic mob/Gangster movie. This movie is a Must have for fans of this genre. You will not be disappointed after viewing this movie.,1374710400,2,147,4.481481481481482
5691991,5,B00C6WHSRI,"Since The Departed, what has Hollywood given us in the realm of quality gangster films? American Gangster? That's a good flick. Public Enemies? Okay. Lawless? Eh, alright. Gangster Squad? Oh, wait, what? It just appears to keep getting worse in Hollywood. Not so much in South Korea. Between A Bittersweet Life, A Dirty Carnival, and now New World, these guys are on fire.

The film opens with the brutal dispensing of a rat within Goldmoon, the biggest crime syndicate in Korea. It is a cold, not-so-subtle warning of what happens to a rat and undercover police officer Ja-sung knows it: either via a pair of concrete boots or by concrete ingestion, you'll sleep with the fishes. After 8 years, he's successfully infiltrated Goldmoon and become the right hand man and ""bro"" of Goldmoon's 2nd in command, the half Chinese Jung Chung. The stakes are as high as he sees they can get, and for that reason, he wants out.

Meanwhile, after successfully being acquitted of all charges due to lack of evidence, Goldmoon Chairman Seok Dong-chul is killed in a mysterious car accident, throwing the massive syndicate into a succession crisis, with Ja-sung caught right in the middle of those loyal to his ""bro"" Jung Chung, those of the full Korean Lee Joong-gu, and those of his manipulative and lying boss, Police Section Chief Kang Hyung-chul, who seeks to influence the succession in the Police's favor. As you can guess from the title of my review, it may be needless to say I found the ensuing events in this Korean ""Game Of Thrones"" immensely gripping. I won't go in any further to avoid spoilers.

Written and Directed by I Saw The Devil's Park Hoon-jung, New World has convinced me that it's the best entry in the Gangster genre since The Departed. With the exception of the closing scene (which comes across as almost an afterthought), the film is an out and out masterpiece. It is very easy to see why Hollywood shelved out $600,000 for the remake rights. Impeccably acted, scripted, shot, and directed, the film is (edit: was) a major contender for the 'Best Foreign-Language Film' Oscar at the upcoming Academy Awards.

What's bad? Aside from the closing scene feeling like an afterthought, I really can't think of anything. Is it too violent for kids? Yes. Is there a lot of bad language? Yes. Is there a whole lot of sex? Not really. Is it really the best Gangster film since The Departed? Yes. And that's pretty much all the reason a real movie lover should need to check out this wonderful gem.",1373760000,23,2501,4.755760368663594
5691992,5,B00C6WHSRI,"Wow, simply wow!  This movie blew me away.  Moody, tightly scripted.  There is not an ounce of chaff in the storyline.  After renting this movie on VUDU, I decided to it for keeps.  It is that good.",1373760000,3,198,4.243243243243243

Though not shown in explicit detail, these bad guys know how to make their enemies ""feel the pain!"" Even the supposedly ""good guys"" have their bad side, when it comes to fighting crime, but this story is more believable than the typical what you might be expecting.

5691995,4,B00C6WHSRI,"Good modern Korean gangster drama with lots of excellent plot twists. Make no mistake though; this movie is a drama thriller. Don't expect action. There's very little. It's very good at what it does though, so if you like plot, this is for you. I actually mistakenly bought this not realizing I had already watched it before.",1501632000,,325,4.719298245614035
5691996,1,B00C6WHSRI,"A great thing is that all the South Korean films I've watched turned out to be good. But the bad thing is that this film is the only one which isn't good. NEW WORLD, seeming to be extremely amazing from the promos, synopsis and IMDb rating, turns out to be a major downer despite of a great performance from the seasoned actor Choi Min-sik. The other lead characters simply overdo their parts. The film is supported by good music, visuals and a handful of action, but is let down by a poorly executed story and screenplay.

The biggest problem with NEW WORLD is that it chooses the melodramatic way of telling a story which needed a faster pace and sharper execution. The first hour of the film is totally wasted in setting up characters which don't seem to be impressive. And they unfortunately turn out to be the lead characters. Despite of a lot of time being given in character development, one of the lead characters looks simply underdeveloped. The film, which I was expecting to be a solid one, turned out to be a disappointment because it didn't stay true to the genre it was expected to stay to. It's a crime drama, but as it progresses, it turns out to be a ""crime melodrama"" instead.

Choi Min-sik is the saving grace of this film. And only he is. Hwang Jung-min disappoints. Lee Jung-jae doesn't show any other expression other than the one he sports. Park Sung-Woong was a total surprise package as he performed very well. But sadly, his character isn't well written and neither does he get a proper scope to perform. Others actors too are disappointing.

The story and screenplay both seem to be poorly written and after a point of time, the film turns into a yawnfest. The film fails to evoke or convey any emotion. It's indeed hard to figure out what is being tried to convey with this film. The first hour being totally bland makes you lose interest even when the second hour seems to get a little back on track. But sadly, it never actually gets back on track. The moment you feel it's suddenly back on track, it just gets derailed with the next shot. In other words, the editing is another major negative point of the film as it's too slow paced to engage you. Many portions are overlong, especially the pre-climactic episode, and they generate no tension at all.

But I mustn't forget to praise the cinematography, music and one well choreographed action scene. But these are the only things one will remember. For a full time watch, NEW WORLD doesn't seem to be a right film.

South Korean films never disappointed me so getting disappointed with this one is something I didn't expect at all. Don't think I don't like drama films. I do like intense dramas apart from action and thriller films. But this film seems to be having almost no intensity at all.

Still, I must say I have no ""new word"" for NEW WORLD to describe it as something more than bad. I am not saying that don't watch it. Watching it depends on you, and not watching too. Just note that the film lacks the kick of action films, the intelligence of crime films, emotion of drama films and the edge of the seat sharpness of thriller films. Instead, watch Lee Byung-hun's INSIDE MEN: an excellent film of the same genre which is both far longer and million times better than this ""world"" of 135 minutes",1501286400,,3287,4.534569983136594

5692002,5,B00C6WHSRI,"This is my favorite movie in the crime genre.  My second favorite is Godfather, Parts 1 and 2.

New World is funny, gritty, intelligent, suspenseful, and beautifully acted.  The characters are complex, multifaceted and lifelike.

At its core, the movie is a story about 2 guys that rose through the ranks of a gang and became brothers.  They struggle in a sea of sharks where absolutely no one can be trusted.

I've watched this movie about a half dozen time and I'm only starting to see the strategy and schemes.  A part of the story includes the game ""Go"" or Chinese Chess.  I think this is a metaphor for the strategy that is deployed in the story.  I don't play Go, so this is just a guess.

One last thing.  Someone here said the ending scene was meaningless.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The ending scene explains the entire movie.  Watch the movie and see for yourself.

Hwang Jung min is so good. Other actors are brilliant as well. I also love the background music which is somewhat mesmerizing.

5692027,5,B00C6WHSRI,"This film has to be one of the best Gangster movies of recent years.  ""New Wolrd"" keeps the viewer engaged throughout the flim.  The acting is superb, the script is awesome!  As one of the reviewers mentioned that they may as well do a prequel and sequel to this, I hope they will too!
The story revolves around an undercover police officer, who is used as a mole, not knowing exactly what his chief's final plans are, he is constantly to told to just follow orders.  There isn't a whole lot of action in this film, but to me it was well balanced between story and action. This is probably Lee Jung Jae's best performance that I've seen him do, maybe he has evolve over the years, or maybe the director had something to do with it.
Watch this film, if you enjoyed infernal affairs/departed and similar movies.  Heck watch it even if you enjoy other types of movies.  Excellent film!

5692043,4,B00C6WHSRI,"An undercover cop within the biggest crime organization in Korea is caught between loyalties when the police initiate its sweep-up operation.

After the untimely death of Koreas biggest crime syndicate Goldmoons chairman, power struggle between top lieutenants begins - mobs rank no. 2 Jung Chung (Jeong-min Hwang) and no. 3 Lee Joong-gu (Seong-Woong Park) are the potential heirs to the throne. In order to control and observe this transition, the police begin a new operation called New World. Sitting at the pivot of this operation is none other than Jungs right hand man, Ja-sung  Lee(Jung-Jae Lee), who has been working undercover for 8 years. Police chief Kang has been his handler since the beginning, and he knows how fragile Ja-sung is at this moment. With a baby on the way, Ja-sung has been wanting to leave the job for some time, before hes exposed as a mole and traitor by the mob. Hes torn between his duty and honor as a cop, and members of his gang, whom he knows will follow him to hell and back. Adding fuel to the fire, Section Chief Kang (Old Boy, Min-sik Choi ) uses mobs internal information he obtained from Ja-sung to worsen the relationship between Jung and Lee.  IMDb.

Cops, gangsters, deceit.

From the writer of I Saw the Devil (a big South Korean hit in 2012), and starring Oldboy himself Choi Min-sik, New World takes us into the intricate political world of cops and robbers, this slick thriller starts off brilliantly but meanders in the last hour.

Everything that happens in it is justified and interesting it just needed a little finer editing.
Performances are solid, standout is Hwang Jeong-min as gangster Jeong Cheong, whom Id seen before in the excellent A Bittersweet Life.
Choi Min-sik is always on it bringing to life the world weary cop who is not much different morally than the main gangstas. Lee Jung-jae as our protagonist delivers a sturdy rendition of a man trapped betwixt 2 worlds.

Its still a gangster film that has quality plastered all over it, the costumes, the music, the performances but this is the director Park Hoon-jungs second film and I feel it lacks experience especially in the composition.
(Although Ridley Scott has had a bunch of experience and he still churned out American Gangster, so what do I know?)
Some of it was too protracted and it took too long to say what it could have said in much simpler, clearer terms.

Id much rather see an above average South Korean film any day of the week as opposed to a Liam Neeson/Jason Statham thriller.
Not the best film in the world but if you dig a classy gangster tale told in a way only the South Koreans are bringing it then chickety check it.

5692055,5,B00C6WHSRI,"""New World"" is a complex thriller about a cop who has successfully infiltrated the Korean Mafia or Kkangpae (literally ""thug"" in English). Whilst not as pervasive as their foreign counterparts, Kkangpae are nevertheless a powerful force in the Korean underbelly, as well as in parts of the diaspora.

As the similarly themed ""The Departed"" was adapted from the superior Chinese ""Infernal Affairs"", so South Korean ""New World"" will be re-made for American viewers - Sony having already bagged the rights with a six figure price-tag.

Unfortunately, as ""Infernal Affairs"" won numerous Asian awards while being ignored at the Oscars, leaving Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"" to scoop 4 awards for his worthy adaptation, so ""New World"" may be correspondingly sidelined. There have been criticisms about the subtitles, but they seemed fine to me.

Note : Surnames first, per Korean etiquette.

Director Park Hoon-jung wrote the screenplay for the outstanding ""I Saw the Devil"".  Veteran actor Choi Min-sik, who has won numerous awards, for his roles in ""Oldboy"" (also re-made - poorly) and ""I Saw the Devil"" among others, is equally brilliant as Section Chief Kang.

Lee Jung-jae as mole Lee Ja-sung reporting to handler Kang, and the rest of the cast's solid performances keep you on the edge of your seat. Between them, they have created a winner in ""New World"". The title of the movie is the name of the mission.

Korean protocol - the depth of the bow as a from of greeting denoting seniority/respect lets you know who's who in the pecking order. Even though smoking is restricted in Korea, senior members of the mob flout this rule to prove that they above the law. They dress like ""salarymen"", not thugs.  Yes, there are some grubby enforcers who fit in where they belong - at the very bottom of the food chain.

The film opens with the grisly torture, murder and disposal of a suspected ""rat"", specifically as a warning to any other snitches who may be lurking in the shadows.

Shortly thereafter, the head of the Goldmoon crime syndicate is killed in an ""accident"", leaving rival factions developing around two prospective leaders vying for top spot. With a fair amount of infighting and double crossing they are hell-bent on rooting out informers and traitors.

Ja-Sung has moved up the ranks to right hand man to the deceased second-in-command (who held the real power), and will probably enjoy similar status alongside whomever succeeds him.  But the strain of 8 years of leading a double life and fear of exposure is taking its toll.  Ja-sung wants out, but Kang is not done with him, alternately threatening then dangling the carrot of a new life. The police want to steer the selection process of the new leader to their advantage in controlling the crime organization.

What follows is a series of unexpected twists and turns. Just when you think you know where it's headed, it detours off on an abrupt tangent. At times it may appear contrived, but through nuance and flashbacks, is anything but.

Be warned though - this is not for sensitive viewers. The violence is graphic, but not gratuitous.

As with many classics - Seven Samurai vs The Magnificent Seven to cite one example - the original is best.",1395360000,,3215,4.904059040590406
5692056,4,B00C6WHSRI,"New World (2013)  not to be confused with Terrence Malicks The New World  is a South Korean gangster movie directed by Park Hoon Jeong, writer of Kim Jee-woons I Saw the Devil. Now, those who like Korean crime movies know that Park Hoon Jeongs sophomore film as a director is going to be very intense. Yes, it is intense, and bloody, too, but what is most impressive about New World is a moral question that the film raises.

Head of Goldmoon, the countrys biggest crime syndicate, is killed in a car accident, and a power struggle to succeed his position is about to begin. Higher level police officers including Police Chief Kang (Choi Min-sik) take that as a chance to weaken the crime organization by using an undercover agent that has been inside the syndicate for eight years. But what if he is tired of his mission? Or worse, if he has developed a rapport with the very person he was to bring down?

Thats all I can say without spoiling much about the unpredictable story. Certain sections of the film may remind you of a Hong Kong crime noir Infernal Affairs (2002)  or its Hollywood remake The Departed (2006)  but similarity ends when the protagonist is forced to make a more drastic move.

The crime drama is notable for the superb acting from the stars. The characters are memorable, including the syndicates hot-tempered second-in-command Jung Chung (Hwang Jung-min), his faithful right-hand man Lee Ja-sung (Lee Jung-jae), and of course Choi Min-siks disillusioned Chief Kang, who uses his agent as bait, but not without a conscience. I think the film is a bit overlong and some part of is incredible (even by the standard of the genre), but New World is engrossing nonetheless.",1394496000,5,1692,4.7542662116040955

However there is a third party and could be a mole for the police but also a contender for the top spot.
The films premise is cliched but the events that unfold are definitely not. It has all the production values and some very good acting by all the cast.

5692061,5,B00C6WHSRI,"Crime dramas are pretty frequent, and often filled with cliches. Very few are intelligent and most of the time seem to exist solely to showcases torture scenes or acts of mindless male bravado. Even fewer have surprising plot twists, or could be called political in scope. When I started watching the film New World, from writer/director Park Hoon-jung, I didn't believe I was getting one of those rare crime dramas. What I found was a clever, political, character driven mafia movie whose violence was tastefully placed to satisfy the story, instead of shock value.

 Lee Ja-sung, played by Lee Jung-jae, is an undercover cop who has infiltrated the criminal organization of Goldmoon, for over almost a decade. He works under one the top men in the organization, Jung Chung, played by Hwang Jung-min. Jung Chung is a cocky comedic type of person, like Joe Pesci, smiling and joking like nothing matters one moment and then coldly bashing in someones head the next. Ja-sung wants out, and wants to lead a normal life, with his now pregnant wife, played by Kim In-seo. However, his handler, and one of the few people in the world who knows who he really is won't let him. That man is Section Chief Kang Hyung-chul, played by Choi Min-sik, of Old Boy fame. When the head of Goldmoon is killed in a mysteriously timed car accident, Chief Kang wants Ja-sung to help rig the election of the next leader in the organization. This starts a power struggle between Jung Chung and another top dog in the family, Lee Joong-gu, played by Park Sung-woong. Ja-sung is torn between getting out, and sending everyone to jail and helping Jung Chung, who he has grown close to.

 While the plot doesnt sound all that complex, there are plenty of twists and turns.  The police are not really that interested in putting people in jail, they would rather guide the organization into a co-existence with society. In other words, tame the group rather than killing them and leaving a vacuum for another group of criminals. They are using Ja-sung to attempt to do this. They feed him limited information through Chief Kang, who is manipulating people around Ja-sung as well, and a young cop named Sin-woo, played by Ji-hyo Song, who poses as Ja-sungs chess teacher. However, Ja-sung is unaware that his bosses are pulling other strings within Goldmoon. Suspicion and mistrust quickly develop between Jung Chung and Lee Joong-gu. While both gangsters think they are calling all the shots in their path to the top they are being manipulated into their actions. Saying any more would spoil the fun.

 New World is aptly named. While the name of the crime syndicate is called Goldmoon, I kept thinking Goldman, as in Sachs. Goldmoon is in part a legitimate business, but with a criminal underbelly, not that much different from todays white collar criminals. The fact that the police would rather have some form of influence over such an organization instead of destroying it is also telling of the times. Government and greedy criminals working together has become a theme the world over in all news sources. All this ties into the great political drama of the story. The struggle for control over Goldmoon is like the politics over the succession of a king. There is a lot of traps and hidden cards, so to speak, in this game of power. You are never quite sure who is really working for who, or is responsible for what.

 The violence is well done. It never becomes too much to handle. It does get very Sopranos, with golf clubs, hammers, knifes, and very large oil barrels filled with cement. Yet, there is never a point where the violence becomes too much. There is a great scene of a hit performed in a parking garage. It is like a small medieval battle with guys in suits swing baseball bats and knifes. It stays very realistic and incredibly bloody, no kung fu heros here. The climatic killings at the end are filmed with the skill of Scorsese, with the people dying in style, or in utter surprise.

 New World is a modern crime drama, driven by its character and its politics. All the actors give great performances. Choi Min-sik plays a great cop with a real hard edge, a mixture of Bronson and Columbo. Hwang Jung-mins character is a cocky yet silly funny man, always making jokes but hides a core of seriousness. Park Sung-woongs character is a man used to having power but is slowly losing it, and he portrays much anger and fatalism. Lee Jung-jae plays a straight man who is being pushed to the edge by what is being asked to do. Living two lives is tearing him apart and all he wants is some control. The story never gets bogged down, but keeps moving quickly. The interactions between the characters are quick witted and intimate.  All in all, New World is worth seeing, especially if you have not seen a good crime drama in a while.",1391126400,2,4820,4.691124260355029

Park Hoon-jungs New World is a top notch crime drama from South Korea. Its complex plot features Jung-Jae Lee as Lee Ja-sung, an agent whos been undercover with the Goldmoon crime syndicate for eight years now and has managed to reach the position of second-in-command to the groups leader. When the latter is taken out in a hit, Jung-Jae naturally assumes that his assignment will likewise be terminated and that hell be allowed to return to a normal life with his pregnant wife. However, his actual boss, Police Chief Kang (Min-sik Choi), has other plans for him, namely to stay an active member in the gang  and to eventually fill the vacuum left by the assassinated leader. This, however, will necessitate eliminating the top two lieutenants, Jeong Cheong (Jeong-min Hwang) and Lee Jung-gu (Seong-Woong Park), his two potential rivals for the throne.

At times brutal and bloody, New World, nevertheless, remains predominantly a drama of character and ideas, as the good figures in particular must find their way through the moral morass that is the world of crime, where the fine line between good and evil, right and wrong, often has to be crossed in order to secure a desired end. And somehow they must do so without losing both their humanity and their soul in the process. For the embedded Jung-Jae, for instance, there is the inexorable pull to the dark side as well as the inevitable shifting of loyalties that comes from immersing himself so deeply into this brotherhood of criminals, while Kang, the Javert-like figure of the piece, is so obsessed with bringing down Goldmoon that he is even willing to sacrifice some of his own operatives to bring it about.

Sharp writing, intense performances, excellent pacing, fine direction and an ironically preordained conclusion all combine to make New World a must-see film.",1387065600,12,1839,4.980456026058632

This is a near-perfect psychological thriller in the guise of a gangster flick. It's got more twists that you will ever expect, and starts good then keeps getting better. All the performances are rock solid, while writer/director Hoon-Jung gets an A on both counts. The script never falters, with some very nice wry lines here and there. This is not a mindless action jam; there's lots of character development to make it all mean more than most gangster sagas. H-J also knows how to move a camera well without showing off and detracting from the story. There's an artistry to New World that adds a layer of class to an otherwise harsh tale.

The only caveat here is that there are about a dozen moments of very brutal violence, so if blood and guts turn you off, this is not for you. But it's not gratuitous, always serving to highlight the truly depraved nature of this sort of people.

New World is one of the best shoot-em-up/carve-em-ups that I've seen in years, and is bound to become a genre classic as time rolls by. Looking forward to more from Hoon-Jung. This guy knows how to make a great movie.",1377475200,,1117,4.54726368159204
