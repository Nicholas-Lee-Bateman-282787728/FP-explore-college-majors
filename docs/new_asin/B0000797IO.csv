1803577,4,B0000797IO,"""The Good Girl"" is one of those movies that comes around that is not for everybody, but for some people this movie will be a well written, well acted film that will find their way into their hearts time after time. The film is very much like most ""Catcher in the Rye"" type stories. But with a special touch that gives that something more. The film is contains the best performance Jennifer Aniston has ever given. Jake Gyllenhaal is also very good as the put-upon young man. The only detriments to this DVD version is that the video transfer is terrible. Where there should be black shadow you get blue noise, and it can really get annoying. The disc also does not contain the trailer for the film which I enjoyed. Overall the film is quite wonderful, but this disc could have been way better.",1041897600,,793,4.475862068965517

One day at work Justine comes to a crossroad in her life where she decides to have an immoral affair with a young cynical writer with the pen name Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal) from Catcher in the Rye.  During the affair she recognizes the daily melancholy that she is experiencing and she understands that she needs to get away from it, but moral issues prevent her from doing so.  This is a dilemma that she struggles with in order to get out her self-destructive path.  Good Girl is a film for those who do not mind introspective laughs and melancholy on the silver screen.",1041724800,2,697,4.642276422764228

Aniston plays Justine Last, a clerk at a discount store, whose life is the picture of tedium. Justine has spent her life in this small Texas town, avoiding college for fear that it would cost her her husband working at the same dreary job for years... The two enter into an elicit affair that stretches the boundaries of what Justine thought her life was about and causes her to reevaluate everything she holds dear.
This movie works, but it's not on the strength of the writing...film bills itself as a comedy, but for the most part is far more dramatic. Most of the really funny moments all seem to come at the hands of Zooey Deschanel who plays a cynical worker at the department store who has fun with the public address system and with unsuspecting cosmetics customers.
Which brings us to where this movie does work -- the performances. Deschanel is great in her cynical voice, with impeccable comedic timing. Gyllenhall is also good as the young man who wants to be J.D. Salinger so badly he's already planning to disappear after writing one novel. Reilly, as Aniston's husband, takes a character that could very easily have been a stereotypical tank-top wearing, wife-beating husband and injects some real humanity. You get the impression that Phil Last is a man who genuinely cares about his wife and would do anything for her, he's just too stupid to realize there's a problem. Nelson, who's almost always good, compliments Reilly's bumbling good-hearted character well.
Aniston, however, really shines in this film. Her accent seems quite natural -- the only times it ever feels out of place is when you remind yourself how long she's played the spoiled rich girl on Thursday nights and compare the two voices. She is convincing as someone who has painted her entire life into a corner and doesn't know how to escape. Director Miguel Arteta uses a very understated style that works for the movie -- it's never too flashy, never too loud. The movie knows its pace and keeps it well. Only the script by Mike White keeps it from being a truly great work...
Although you can see the end of the movie coming a mile away, the performances of ""The Good Girl"" make it worth checking out. Perhaps for the first time in her career, Aniston has proven she can play a good deal more than this particular title would imply.",1037059200,11,2324,4.698529411764706

1803600,4,B0000797IO,"Made about 15 years ago now, ""The Good Girl"" proved that Jennifer Aniston is a bonafide movie star...when given the right vehicle.  Too bad she has strayed from that path recently with bad career choices, like ""The Bounty Hunter.""  In fact, ""The Good Girl' is probably her career-best performance to date.  Aniston plays ""Justine,"" the prim and proper grocery store clerk who seems just plain bored in her marriage to ""Phil"" (John C. Reilly), a clueless hoot, though she claims to still love him.  Enter ""Holden"" (aka Tom), her new young co-worker, fittingly played by Jake Gyllenhaal like a needy puppy, creating very unusual circumstances and choices for Justine, but would you watch if they were very normal circumstances and choices?

1803633,4,B0000797IO,"This is a film that really does not have a genre.  There are comedic and funny moments (pretty much all dark) but it is not a comedy per se.  Likewise, there is drama, and surprising drama at that, but I would not really call it a pure drama either.  Whatever you personally see it as, I think it is a well done, enjoyable movie.  Although a little quirky.

The story centers around Jennifer Aniston's character, who is in a sterotypical dead end life with a job she hates, a husband who is more interested in getting high than pretty much anything else.  In a quest to break out of that life she ends up having an affair with Jake Gyllenhaal's character Holden (after the main character in the book Catcher In The Rye) which ends up having unintended consequences.

The acting in the movie was very good all around.  It is one of the few movies that Aniston has been in that did not just focus on her being hot.  Ironically she probably shows more in this movie than she has in any of her others, but unlike some of her other movies that was not really the focus.  It is probably her best movie acting job up until the more recent comedies she has done.  It definitely has a low-budget independent movie feel, but it did not need to be a big blockbuster to tell the story it did.

As far as extras go.  It is one of those two sided DVDs with a widescreen version and full screen version on each side.  There are about 8 min of deleted scenes, a gag reel, and a couple different commentary tracks.  Nothing major, but okay for what is there.  For the price, it is definitely worth checking out.",1398470400,5,1594,4.298657718120805

While the plot of a woman feeling stuck in her boring life may seem appealing once that ""bad boy"" outsider-type comes along to ""set her free"", it is not pulled of at all.  The husband of Aniston's character comes off as so pathetic that it's sad...you're not rooting for her to get away from him because he's not a nice guy, you're just rooting for the film to end so you're rid of all of them.  And that ""bad boy"" outsider...Dear God!  He is no Holden Caulfield as he claims to be...Holden would just shake his head at this guy.  Those sleep-walking customers in the store probably have the right idea...it's the only way to get through any of this.

You'll love this one all the way as a drama and character study. Only gripe is credulity being strained a bit: in real life, small-town girls this beautiful, sharp and full of potential do not generally hang around in their dreary little home towns after high school, marrying the ugliest brute from high school and selling shower caps at the Bargain-o-Rama.

1803643,5,B0000797IO,"Very often actresses stay away from realistic films,especially lower class
dramas of life,dark and somber. Jennifer in this piece plays the role different than i expect and i was thrown off at first but then i saw where the drama was going. At first we are introduced to budding novelist with the Salinger name of the classic american nover cathcher in the rye,probably the most well known,though short,novels of modern america. This type of character which not only is a source of drama but evokes commentary throughout is interesting,and he leads the character into a series of scenes adultery(where she is never
emotionally/sensitively involved,which is why the director expends explicit scenes showcasing them). The film shoots like a play,ideas of being cuckolded
and the dreary effects of urbanization around the focal point of a walmart type
establishment,which like in the novel Dickens Hard Times wears down on the characters as they become increasingly alienated and have little inner life
or values,just parts of the environment,except the male character which shows some life but is done away with at the end and is thought to be crazy(or
perhaps too sane). The one part of the film i did like was the attempt to
show christian revival as a counterpoint to what's draining much of life in
the modern world...but it never really gets anywhere and the characters dont
seem that interested,and the spouse of Jennifer seems antagonized by the nazarene character and his wife's feelings for him,that's what occupies these
crudish male characters their wives personal feelings and bonds to other men,
which they can never quite deal with,and their is good drama about a romance
among friends. A dark comedy of modern life,bringing up old themes in the
fictional world of st catharines a small towm representing small town
characters,the one star,and the inability of the characters to impose change
on their environment,and they become sticks and driven like the wind by their
stimulus-response type reaction not only to sex, but everything,the director or
writer comments on characters with little mental life,sensualist at the
core and completely conditioned by their environment, making them what they are.
Of all the actresses films,and i'm one of those old fashioned critics who
likes virtuous females not succumbing so much to their environs and having
some inner resilience,for that reason i like this role least,although her
acting is good and so is the film,it has a depressing aura around  it true to
life though it is. All to true...the characters resemble all too frankly what
is wrong in our own haunted worlds,spectors and cuckolds like the holloween
imagery,and our failure is that they so dominate our worlds to the neglect and solace of the revival spirit which is quenched like all redeeming values in this
excellent art like film. The actress offers a very good commentary on this film
which shows her excedding and illuminating the bounds of conventions,although
I like her roles in other films. I've seen this film a few times,and it had a good run.",1332547200,,3076,5.103174603174603

1803645,5,B0000797IO,"The Good Girl is a 2002 slice-of-life dark comedy starring Jennifer Anniston as Justine, a small town woman bored with her life and disappointed by her wasted potential. After reading numerous negative reviews on Amazon about this film I just wanted to contribute my own thoughts on this movie. First, this is not your generic Hollywood comedy that i think many viewers were expecting. If you're looking for the usual formula of ""confused but cute girl meets amazing guy and goes through series of wacky slapstick events and misunderstandings that leads to breakup only to conclude guy was perfect the whole time and finally makes public speech that fixes everything"" then skip The Good Girl.

The Good Girl is about being bored, craving excitement and the sometimes stupid actions people do in their pursuit of happiness. For those that enjoy independent films or interesting character studies and appreciate sarcasm or dry humor- this is a great film.

Justine works at the retail rodeo, married right out of high school and has settled into a monotonous routine of work, home and sleep. Her husband paints houses and also smokes pot on a regular basis with his co-worker. Justine is frustrated that her life is boring, her husband has no ambitions and that ultimately she is wasting her time in a dead end job.

Things change when a new and eccentric boy Holden (Jake Gyllenhal) starts working at the Retail Rodeo. His arrival starts an affair that is exciting for Justine but also brings her lots of guilt. As events unfold we follow Justine and watch her make good and bad decisions as she tries to decide what is best for her and the people around her.

The film is a slow because real life is sometimes slow. The script is filled with plot twists and lots of dry humor and cynicism. If you look deeply at each character and try to understand their feelings and motives its a very sad film as well.

I found this film to be funny, sad and very compelling - telling the story of many real people who quietly dream of doing more but feel trapped by their situation.",1326499200,2,2069,4.688705234159779
1803646,4,B0000797IO,"A great film on a centuries-old topic: the boredom of small towns and the trouble people get into when they try to spice up their lives a bit by doing something radical -- like having an affair with a work-mate under the nose of their unsuspecting spouses.

Justine (Jennifer Aniston) is a small-town department store clerk bored silly with her job and domestic life. She is married to the house painter Phil (John C. Reilly) who seems to be living in his own stoned-out world with his cynical buddy Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson).

Into this picture enters the newly hired cashier Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal) who keeps his nose buried into J. D. Salinger's CATCHER IN THE RYE. Just like Justine, he also thinks life is not treating him fairly. Soon the two alienated characters get close to one another at lunch and coffee breaks and start a torrid affair. What Justine does not expect is the way Holden takes their affair a bit too seriously and starts to make demands that Justine cannot meet.

Their relationship is eventually discovered by others in the small community, and different additional demands (including straight forward blackmail) start to pile up on Justine. At this point Justine is in a full panic mode.

Just when you think the plot cannot get more convoluted, Justine realizes she is pregnant even though her husband is sterile. It's clear that she is carrying Holden's baby. What gives?

At the end of the third act, the story resolves on a sweet note after one of the key players eliminate himself from the scene.

In the end Justin learns her expensive moral lesson and life goes on just the same but with a deeper understanding of the gift that any status quo usually is. As Joni Mitchell says in her famous song: ""You don't know what you've got 'till it's gone...""

John C. Reilly is one of those much-neglected B-list actors that I like. If a movie has JCR in it, I go for it. Never been disappointed so far. That's why this film is no exception.

Don't most  of us watch movies to escape into worlds that are more dramatic than our own?  That just isn't the case with this one.

The sheer dreariness of the beginning of the film is actually well done. The movie REALLY portrays the pointlessness of Justine's life. It's a testement to the movie that we continue to watch it in spite of the lack of action at the beginning. So no, this isn't a comedy, although there are some funny parts.  Yes, it is very dark.  No, there isn't a lot of action. And yes, the acting is actually quite good.  I would love to ask the actors what they thought of the film.

1803652,5,B0000797IO,"I could watch The Good Girl over and over, every day, which is why I give it 5 stars. (Except I would skip the two sex scenes, especially the 2nd, which is painful to watch.) Part of why I love this, is you can make up your own mind about the ending, which shows Justine Last and her husband playing with their baby. But Justine got pregnant after she had sex with her coworker/lover, Tom ""Holden"" making you believe it's probably his baby, not Phil's (Justine's husband.) But it could be Phil's, because they had been trying to have a baby for a long time, prompting Justine to take Phil to a doctor to check on his sperm. Or, it could even be Bubba's, Phil's friend, who saw Justine cheat with Holden at a motel, and tells her she has to have sex with him, or he'll tell Phil. But Bubba isn't really a candidate for Justine's baby daddy in my mind. You can pick, because Justine denies it's Holden's baby, but sounds unsure when she promises Phil it's his baby.

Anyway, this is a droopy, sad movie. Everyone is depressed, and everyone happy ends up dead. (A coworker, Gwen, who was about the only upbeat character, dies from food poisoning.) It is about Justine having to make choices, to be with her lover, or be with her stoned husband who cares for her, but is always high. Justine seems torn, but as she narrates her story, it seems she's made up her mind of dropping one of them.
The first time I saw this movie, it made me depressed, as all the character's were. That is why I like it, not because I like being depressed, but if a movie can make you feel a certain way you wouldn't have felt unless watching the movie, then it does a good job. This is my opinion of an effective movie, maybe not a great one, but effective at changing your mind about things, making you think, changing your emotions, or making you want to know more.

I loved this movie, because while being depressed, it made me think about the horrible choice Justine had to face. This DVD also claims to be a romantic comedy, there are a few funny moments, but I would never call this a comedy. A story about a sad married woman, who loves her younger coworker, but can't leave her husband. If I were Justine, I would have chosen Holden most likely. But after I thought about it, they are only bonded and their relationship is where it is because they're both depressed, and that's it. They seem to share little similarities beyond depression and hating everything.

So, I loved it. I own it, and I've watched it 3 times in one month. If you don't like being sad, or sad movies, or romance, or anything similar to the plot of this movie, don't watch it. But if you like the idea of this, sad movies, romance, and some spread around jokes (Zooey Deschanel is amazing in this!) then you'd like this.",1279497600,3,2776,4.365570599613153
1803661,3,B0000797IO,"I know that three stars may seem like a contradiction to my title, but for me a solid C+ can be a good movie.  It's not a great one, and it certainly is a masterpiece, but it is a decently entertaining and at times even remarkably moving film about adultery both physically and emotionally.

The film centers around a woman named Justine who is just stuck.  She hates her job and she hates her husband and she hates that her life seems to have absolutely no meaning or purpose.  She is just longing for something, anything to break her mold and provide her with some sort of joy.  Her husband is a loving man who doesn't understand how to provide Justine with what she needs, and worse yet he doesn't even seem to understand that she needs anything.  He's painfully oblivious.  When Justine starts conversing with an equally `stuck' co-worker named Holden (obsessed with `Catcher in the Rye') she starts to find something in her life to hold onto, which leads her down the rapturous course of infidelity.

The question is, what has she found and at what cost has she found it?

In parts, this film works very well.  Jennifer Aniston holds the movie together with her emotionally void performance that really allows small glimmers of inner complexity shine through the cracks at just the right moments.  Personally, this is John C. Reilly's shinning moment, and he delivers a remarkably moving performance as the dim-witted husband who just wants to be happy (and that slap puts Ruby Dee to shame).  While these two stars chew up the scenery, Jake Gyllenhaal tends to play on clich and deliver a rather bland performance.  I blame a lot of my issues on the script there (I don't think that his character was written very well) and so he comes off as just someone I didn't like.  Tim Blake Nelson also plays up a caricature instead of really taking advantage of the subtleties to make his character seem more relevant (both Phil and Bubba are characters that speak volumes when played right, yet only Reilly understand how to play it right).

The supporting cast is all top notch though, especially Zooey Deschanel (when is she not superb?) and John Carroll Lynch.

The script has some holes I didn't like very much (like I said, the development and really existence of the Holden character felt like a lazily constructed gimmick) but when we are focused on the marriage itself and those effected, the film really shines.  Anytime that Reilly and Aniston are sharing a moment, the film dramatically improves, and when we are left with Justine's contemplation of her actions we are brought to an honest and moving place.

Like I said, in parts this film is really good, but as a whole if starts to suffer.

So, this is a good film, but it could have been great!  I still highly recommend this one and consider this to be star moments for Reilly and Aniston, for neither has ever been this in tune with their characters.  The films flaws are forgivable (but not invisible) and so it is a film that can be provoking and engrossing.",1266451200,,3026,4.639774859287054

1803664,3,B0000797IO,"The Good Girl / B0000797IO

Although I wasn't certain if I'd like ""The Good Girl"", I definitely felt a resonance with Aniston's character Justine, as she struggles with being stuck seemingly indefinitely in a rut of existential angst. This sort of modern existential angst of being stuck in a life that you didn't intend to choose, of having missed opportunities for something more or better (education, work, or spouse), and of never seeing any end or change in sight is something that many people recognize and can identify with, particularly anyone who has worked at a low-level, minimum-wage, customer service type position.

Whereas movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Employee-of-the-Month/dp/B000LC3ICE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Employee of the Month</a>&nbsp;make light of this angst as the characters maintain sanity by choosing to not take life too seriously, ""The Good Girl"" hits closer to home by emphasizing that, for many people, this way of life is a matter of survival, not of frivolity. Indeed, Justine would fit in easily in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nickel-and-Dimed/dp/0805088385/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nickel and Dimed</a>, as she struggles to work up the energy through her depression to come to work every day, because the money isn't going to come in from anywhere else - certainly not from her frequently-stoned, unreliable oaf of a husband. Out of desperation and boredom, Justine agrees to an affair with younger co-worker ""Holden"" (self-named for the main character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Catcher-in-the-Rye/dp/0316769177/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Catcher in the Rye</a>), who not-so-subtly begins to spiral into madness like his unfortunate namesake.

Here is where the movie gets full points for sheer realism. Justine realizes that there is no bright, explosive, happy ending waiting for her and Holden. They are not Bonnie and Clyde, and even while Justine may passionately dream of living a different life as someone else, somewhere else, she recognizes with the maturity of her years that life just doesn't work that way. Holden burns out with the ferocity of youth and Justine returns, resigned and likely still depressed, to her life of drudgery, only slightly relieved by the knowledge that her husband is as depressed with life as herself and not a 'mindless cow'.

Though I felt this movie was a realistic portrayal of modern existential angst and disillusionment, and though I appreciated the movie for espousing the sad truth that Justine really *is* trapped in her situation, or at least one very like it even if she moved away from that particular town, job, and husband, I can't say that I ""enjoyed"" the movie in the strictest sense of the word. I appreciate harsh truths and painful realities, and the courage it took to convey them in this well acted, carefully produced movie, but I can't imagine ever wanting to sit down and watch it again and it certainly isn't a cheerful movie by any stretch. I would definitely recommend that everyone see this movie once, but I wouldn't expect anyone to want to see it again. Sometimes the truth just hurts too much.

1803666,4,B0000797IO,"Poor, pitiful Justine (Jennifer Aniston) works her days away in a dreary predictable discount store and returns home at day's end to her painter husband and his slimy sidekick, who together spend their nights ensconced on the couch smoking dope and watching mindless television.  We see in her listless, slumped shoulder walk the look of desperation and resignation.  How can we feel anything but empathy and pity for Justine, for the life to which she has been condemned?  Is the director making us a witness to yet another yarn about the stifling dullness and  persistent hopelessness of the small town cocoon?

One day out of the fog of dreariness and predictability a new male employee at Justine's place of employment catches her eye.  The young man, who is roughly 9 years her junior, is, as we discover, a candidate in good standing for bipolar poster child of the year.  The young man has shed his ""Slave Name"" Tom and adopted the name of Holden, because he sees himself as the embodiment of the main character in Catcher in the Rye.  Justine is attracted to his impetuous and flamboyant personality, because she sees in him an escape from her horrid dull life.  As the relationship develops and moves from the mental and spiritual to the physical, Justine withdrawals more and more from her friends and responsibilities.  She and her beau nouveau are lost in each other and the possibility of a better life somewhere else.  All is going swimmingly until Justine and her Holden are discovered by Justine's husband's sidekick as they emerge from the hotel room after one of their romps in their field of dreams.  Things get very complicated after that.

As a result of being found out Justine is forced to make other compromises to hide the extent of her relationship with Holden.  This is very taxing for Justine and at one time she even considers religion as an answer to her dilemma.  Holden also becomes very upset when he discovers some of what Justine has done to cover up their dalliances.  To the very end Justine makes decisions and lies to protect herself, while Holden tragically disappears from the picture.

What is the lesson, message or insight that we the viewer should take away from this movie.  At first glance it seems a simple tale about the consequences of the choices we make in life.  Each step we take will to a great extent determine what the next step after that will be.  After letting this movie run around in my head for a few days, I have decided that the Good Girl is perhaps the psychological dialectic to the Garden of Eden story.  In Eden, Adam and Eve had everything they needed to make them happy and in The Good Girl, Justine and Holden believed that because of where they lived and how they lived that they had nothing of what they needed to make them happy, to fulfill there dreams.  Out of these two different worlds, one full of hope and one, from full of despair we see the rise of the same human impulse to break away, to change, even though, the provocations that engendered the need to change things were different, both Adam and Eve and Justine and Holden had to change because the sameness of their lives was too stifling.  Perhaps the lesson is that it is ok to break away, to explore more deeply that which makes us human, but do so with your eyes open. Who knows? maybe God wanted Adam and Eve to leave Eden. Perhaps the lesson is that what we don't have always looks more appealing and feels more desirable than what we do have, and the key is not getting what we want but wanting what we have. In both cases, I think we do have a choice, and for that, we are always responsible.",1231372800,,3638,4.571648690292758

You know those movies where you laugh, but every time you do you feel guilty for doing so? Yeah, that's The Good Girl. Arteta (Chuck and Buck) starts this off as if it's going to be a light, breezy (if mean-spirited) comedy, but things just keep getting more and more tragic. The brilliance of the film is that the more tragic they get, the funnier the script becomes. There are quite a few ways in which this film puts me in mind of Very Bad Things, and I mean that in the best of ways.

The story: Justine Last (Jennifer Aniston) is stuck. She's in a dead-end job, her husband (John C. Reilly) is a house painter with a serious dope habit and a bonehead for a best friend (Tim Blake Nelson), her own best friend (Deborah Rush) is about as deep as a pothole. Is this all there is to life? Enter Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal), a new cashier at her place of business, who feels the trials and tribulations of late adolescence just as Justine feels the trials and tribulations of adulthood, and the two of them strike up a friendship. Complications, as they say, ensue. And as it is in the movies, once complications ensue, everything that can go wrong does at the earliest possible opportunity.

This could have played out as a Lifetime Original Movie melodrama, but Arteta keeps his eyes on the prize-- making the viewer laugh, and making the viewer feel guilty about laughing. Aniston and Gyllenhaal both play their roles perfectly straight while everyone else around them plays for laughs, which only adds to the uncomfortable hilarity.

Jennifer Aniston proves she's not just another pretty face in this brilliant little indie gem.  After a string of romantic comedies for exposure, she proved she had a soul under all that cute ""Friend"" persona with ""The Object of My Affection"".  This movie was under- appreciated and scorned by some in Hollywood -- maybe the boy-toy character with the Morrisey haircut was too much for them (the Paul Rudd love-interest).  Anyhow, in ""The Good Girl"" she shows all her acting muscles as she portrays, with sensitivity, how a small-town girl can get caught in a rut and somehow, despite looks and intelligence, never really get out of it.

I grew up in a small, working class suburb of Baltimore and I know how some girls just get caught up in the life they have pre-ordained for them.  What didn't hold true for me was that Justine seemed too intelligent not to break out of this mold.  Most of the girls I know in this kind of environment would never have heard of Holden Caulfield.  If they had been forced to read ""A Catcher in the Rye"" they would not have understood it.  If they had understood it, they would not have stayed married to the John C. Reilly character.

These movies leave you playing with your thoughts, looking at life from a different point of view.  ""The Good Girl"" is one of those movies.

Jennifer Aniston made a complete U-turn by making this movie, because it is incredibly different then her signature character, Rachel in ""Friends"". In ""Friends"", she is quirky and goofy, but here, she is confused, depressed and, simply, amazing. Her portrayal of Justine Last, a woman who is mentally brought down by life and obligations, is sincere and Oscar-worthy. Aniston makes sure Justine is someone the audience can relate to, as she copes with the themes of solitude, love, infidelity and honesty.

Justine works in a ridiculous store, where every day is the same and nothing is ever interesting. Her husband paints houses, is stoned all the time and doesn't give much thought to whatever happens behind Justine's faade. Things change when she meets the new clerk, Tom a.k.a. Holden, who is a ""Catcher in the Rye""-obsessed existentialist. Partially because of his mysterious appearance, partially because of his age (he is ten years younger then she is) and mostly because he seems like he understands her, Justine falls for him and they start a relationship that is impossible to get out of. This provides a crucial decision Justine faces - is life about expectations and obligations, or is it about that little dose of craziness that is needed in order to stay sane.

What makes this movie a believable drama instead of a pointless downer, are the characters. John C. Reilly plays Justine's husband, and it seems like it is the role he shines in (remember ""Chicago"", or the very similar ""The Hours""?), whereas Jake Gyllenhaal nails Holden, his feelings and conflicts he faces. However, the show is stolen by Jennifer Aniston, who makes a statement with this movie, that she is a great actress. Her timing (both comedic and dramatic) is flawless, her walk, posture and accent believable and in character.  She makes this movie worth-buying and watching at least once a year, when one feels shallow or monotone.

1803730,2,B0000797IO,"If Jennifer Aniston's ""Friends"" character Rachel Greene ever had a weird dream I could imagine it to be just like this black comedy- a minimum-waged, woman's variation of ""The Graduate.""  But just like Rachel, I'd probably shake it off as a weird time spent in the twilight zone.

""The Good Girl"" would have us believe that somewhere in the middle of nowhere, U.S.A. Aniston is a frustrated 30 year old sales clerk in a mythical ""K-Martesque"" store called the ""Retail Rodeo."" Her name, pun intended, Justine Last. As we can deduce from Aniston's off screen monologue (which she reads in a Forest Gump-ish, ""Id-like-to-be-profound, but-I-just=got hit-by-a=baseball-bat"" kid of sound), she feels trapped just like all the seemingly robots around her.  Married to a pot-headed, dim bulb of a husband (the wonderful John C. Reilly), Last yearns to be rescued and believes she's finds her shining knight in the person of an introverted but passionate younger man named Holden Worther(Jake Gyllenhaal).  The sex is great, of course, and before Last can bask in her newfound sense of freedom and hope for a better life she must contend with a major problem- Holden is a lovesick loon.

From there on director Miguel Arteta and writer Mike White turn the tables on our own expectations for finding love in odd places .  No last minute romantic rescues here for ""The Good Girl"" is ultimately a cynical, extramarital version of the movie ""A Simple Plan"" where one misdeed leads comically (or tragically) to another.

It's all game for part of the way but ultimately the ""Good Girl"", for me, rings false.  It's another condescending, Hollywood take on life in ""fly-over land"" as a fate worse than death.  All the characters are made to speak a beat slower and drag around their surroundings as if they were zombies from the movie ""Dawn of the Dead."" Further proof of the filmmakers blue state status are depicted by having Gyllenhaal's parents act like the subjects in the painting ""American Gothic."" They're two  silent, moronic centurions.

Aniston, despite raves from major critics, seems too sitcom spunky and creamy-complected for the low-rent heroine.  Her home style accent comes and goes while Gyllenhaal's hair looks as if it was styled somewhere on Rodeo Drive. The movie's one bright spot is Zooey Deschanel as Aniston's morose co-worker.

What it becomes on film is an insulting example of Hollywood filmmaking at its worst. I use the word insulting because that is what I felt as I watched this movie. Aniston, Nelson, Gyllenhaal, all are trying so hard to be average that they seem on the verge of a ""Forrest Gump"" imitation.  Gyllenhaal and Aniston in particular seem to be doing a caricature of working folk. The way they slump around and furrow their brows as they trudge thru the tired dialog, it's as though each is fighting to understand what the other is saying.

The film itself is grey and dull. The other characters in the film flat and stereotypical (i.e. the coworker who invites her to bible study).

Overall this movie isn't worth the time or effort it took to transfer it to DVD. In another era it probably would have never made it to the screen. Oh how I miss that era.....",1156809600,5,967,4.391061452513966

1803733,4,B0000797IO,"You can have a lot of fun trying to figure out the logic for this DVD combos.  I figure this one is justified because ""G"" and ""K"" are close to each other in the alphabet.  In ""The Good Girl"" you have a recognizable star playing a married woman in a small town, while in ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" you have an unknown playing a single girl in the big city who discovers she might be a lesbian.  Just do not be surprised when you check these movies out because of Jennifer Aniston, but end up liking the other film a whole lot more.

In ""The Good Girl,"" a 2002 film from director Miguel Arteta, Aniston plays Justine, a 30-year-old clerk who is bored to tears by her job at Retail Rodeo where the only excitement is when Cheryl (Zooey Deschanel) makes one of her ""Attention, Shoppers"" announcements over the public address system and starts spewing insults and bizarre nonsense. Cheryl is dispatched to doing makeovers for women customer, while Justine notices Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal), the new kid at the store who is reading ""The Catcher in the Rye"" and who dispenses its wisdom. Holden's name is really Tom, which makes his rants about hypocrisy rather ironic, but clearly he is the first breeze of any kind in Justine's life in a long, long time. Whatever his name, a college dropout sure beats what is waiting for her at home.

Justine is married to Phil (John C. Reilly), who paints houses and always wishes it was raining so he can keep watching television. Phil spends more time with his best buddy, Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson). During the day they paint houses and during the night they smoke weed and watch the tube. Bubba thinks of Justine as the ideal woman and having turned his back on ever having a relationship of his own with a woman vicariously enjoys the happy marriage of his best friend. No wonder Justine falls pretty to Holden's advances and their first tryst at a fleabag motel turns into grabbing every possible opportunity to do it again. Unfortunately, the amorous couple are seen and in an escalating series of events we wonder how high of a price Justine is going to have to pay.

You know that in every small town in America there is a girl with looks but without ambition who parlays her attractiveness into marrying a local stud who would never get out of that town alive. Actually, none of this background is mentioned in the film, but it makes sense that Phil must have done something in the past to get a girl like Justine. What is important in this film is that whatever he had and whatever he offered Justine it is long gone. This is a marriage that has no reason to exist beyond the fact that it does, which helps explain the resolution of this film as much as anything. The performance by the four principles are solid enough, and the supporting cast offers a variety of eccentrics that flesh out this particular seedy little town. ""The Good Girl"" is as much a character study as anything else and whatever its limitations finds a large measure of redemption in the final scene between husband and wife (3.5 Stars).

The title character in ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" (Jennifer Westfeldt) is a nice, young Jewish girl who cannot find herself a man. Based on the montage of some of the worst (and funniest) first dates in history, a reasonable course of action would be for Jessica to just stop looking, but she answers a ""women seeking women"" ad placed by Helen Cooper (Heather Juergensen), who is bisexual. As you watch this 2001 film it becomes clear that both women are looking for love rather than sex, which is perfect because this film is not about sex.  The question here is not just whether the girl will get the girl, but what they are going to do when that finally happens.

There is something intrinsically sweet about the relationship between Jessica and Helen. Besides, the biggest obstacle to their happiness is not Josh Myers (Scott Cohen), Jessica's college boy friend, but Jessica herself, which remains both the character's curse and her charm.  Helen is not sure what to expect when Jessica shows up and getting physical proves difficult because they are so many places where Jessica does not want to be touched, but there is an undeniable something between the two young women that serves as the basis for a relationship, with or without benefits. Once Helen becomes aware that Jessica loves her, she suddenly shows a patience that we would not have expected from her. Yet Helen is even more uncomfortable with the idea of her family and friends knowing about their relationship than she is with actual physical intimacy, and there is no doubt that things will come to a head between them.

Westfeldt and Juergensen first created and played the characters of Jessica and Helen for their stage play ""Lipschtick,"" which certainly explains why they are both so totally comfortable in their roles. As writers they have created a script that is smart and witty, and one of the biggest surprises is that they do not give the film's best moment to themselves but to Tovah Feldshuh as Judy Stein, Jessica's mother. I have been a fan of Feldshuh's for years, but I was still blown away by her mother-daughter talk with Jessica, and the exquisitely powerful delivery of a single line. This is one of those memorable jewels of a moment in a movie where you know you will never forget it and just thinking about it invokes its power.  ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is not a great romantic comedy, but it is very good, which makes it stand out in that genre, especially with regards to same sex romantic comedies. Besides, any romance that treats both the heart and the head with equal regard is worth checking out (4.5 Stars).",1145491200,5,5655,4.64964964964965

 The characterisations are a set of peole deeply unfulfilled and either searching desperately for real connection and exploration of their true desires and talents or succumbing to their heavily ploughed roles as best they can. No one really achieves very much other than a dark realisation that what they are desperate to escape may infact be the most strongly available route in life open to them. Some make do and mend while others faulter in the horror of their findings.

 Thought provoking, damningly witty and terribly sad, none of Aniston's usual sugary fair here, you will see not one visible trace of Rachael Green in her performance; a formula so many of her other films has exploited to her detriment.

Gyllenhaal displays strong signs of his emerging talent also but for me the darkly and explosively funny performance of Zooey Deschanel is the show stealer. Well worth a look, a long afterthought and analysis.

1803740,4,B0000797IO,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. After seeing Brokeback Mountain a few times in theaters, and basically admiring not only his terrific acting in that film (which I secretly want to come out on dvd a.s.a.p.; although, still in theaters), I felt it was time to rent some movies w/him in it. I chose Donnie Darko, and The Good Girl. Serious, and Funny at the same time. I believe women (men as well) can really relate to this movie if they are in a place they didn't think they ought to be at this point in they're lives. Jennifer Aniston says it best in the movie when she says: ""Are you going to your deathbed with unlived life in your veins?"" So, she acts on it w/ consequences in tow of course. Aniston's first love scene is in this movie which she recalls in the commentary. I loved Jake Gyllenhaal's character, and his flaws. He starts off relatively sane; however, disapointed with the world around him, and this is what ultimately brings his, and Jennifer's character together. You feel for Jake's character, because as a person misunderstood myself...you feel overjoyed when someone comes into your life; that finally can really vibe with you, long after you've given up hope. Under the circumstances (Aniston's character is married) there is absolutely no way this can go smoothly. When the bumps in the road start to occur, things get uncomfortable, and Jake is not as stable as she once thought. Jake Gyllenhaal's character ""Holden"" comes across as immature, with unclear thinking in the long run. Jake Gyllenhaal played this character very well. Even after seeing this movie, and possibly putting yourself in that predicament...I personally would of gone through it just to be w/ that character. Then again Jake has a different kind of look...considering the beauty mark above his lips, and what I call the whole ""eye experience"" (the eye color itself, the eyelids, thick lashes, and eyebrows) make him a curious cute and handsome + the cute little lips (can't forget those). Aniston's character is impulsive, and at first a bit selfish, and ending; I look at it as self preservation. This is packed w/ some hillarious moments as well.

Reilly who is one of my favorite actors ever) who works a dead-end job at some Texas bargain warehouse.  She hates her job, hates her husband and most of all, in a lot of ways, hates herself for letting her life become what it is.  She then meets Tom (Gyllenhaal in a brilliant performance...you think Brokeback was good) who thinks he's the incarnate of Holden from Catcher in the Rye.  He hates his life and hates his parents and hates his job...and even himself.  She falls for him mostly because they have so much in common.  They start an affair that leads to Tina making some grave decisions that lead her to hate herself even more.  The film is a great case-in-point that infidelity can ruin, not only a marriage and a family but a persons spirit and as Tina realizes you have to let go of some of the best things in your life to save your soul from the hurt your causes it to 'put on'...A great emotional story that had my wife in tears and my mind working...recomended to anyone with a family.",1136419200,,1341,4.471311475409836

Maybe not to the extent that Jake Gyllenhal's character brought him to, but we've felt disenfranchised, misunderstood, pledged our love, written letters, and pretended to be someone we weren't.

The story of marriage, and who captures your mind and your heart, and keeps your attention, is told well, too. How can there still be romance and mystery if you're talking about house paint and trying to get pregnant?

Through out the film, I kept wanting her to confess about the tasteless affair she has with an emotionally disturbed young man who works with her at her retail job.

Genuinely and pleasantly surprising was Jennifer Aniston's performance as Justine, the bored wife of a burned out stoner/house painter. Justine works as a dazed discount store employee, always dreaming of bigger and better things, lamenting the things she could or should have done in her life instead of marrying Phil (John C. Reilly). She is smarter than her small-town trappings and finds herself idly dreaming and longing for something different. Enter the melancholy ""Holden"" (Jake Gyllenhaal), whose real name is ""Tom"" (but this, he says, is his slave name). He is a writer, a dreamer, and finally someone who seems to ""get"" Justine. Their friendship leads rather quickly to a passionate and torrid affair, which allows Justine to imagine a more exciting life. Still, though, despite the excitement, Justine is an adult with a good deal more life experience than ""Holden""; much of his optimism is unmasked as being naivete; Justine recognizes that their relationship cannot go on forever, although she acknowledges conflicting feelings on the matter. Her marriage with Phil is never going to go anywhere. When Phil's best friend reveals that he knows about Justine's secret affair, he makes demands on her. In many ways, her secret affair allows her to be manipulated into unpleasant or unsavory circumstances. Unfortunately, things do unravel with tragic consequences; though Justine's life is changed, most circumstances go right on being the same (in large part because her husband is too stupid to understand anything).

1803756,3,B0000797IO,"Even though it stars Jennifer Aniston of the thankfully canceled, obnoxious, fake sitcom Friends and it's written by Mike White, who wrote Orange County this is not a comedy movie, a romantic movie or a chick flick. More of a bleak drama with the feel of an independent movie.

In some dead-end Texas town a supermarket checkout girl longs for a more exciting life, stares off into space with a disconnected look and moans a lot. In one of her stares she connects with Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal), a lonely, borderline insane young writer. A much needed affair breathes some life into her existence.

I wasn't entirely satisfied with the film overall. There wasn't a good explanation for Justine actions and decisions in the film's climax. Who's baby is she carrying? Why did she betray Holden? She's not a good girl. Not by far. So I'm assuming the title is meant to be an ironic one.

Anyone expecting Friends or Picture Perfect or Along Came Polly or Object of My Affection or any of the endless incarnations of Rachel Green be warned...it ain't that way.

Probably the most mature work Jennifer Aniston has done. But there's still an incomplete feeling to it all. Worth watching with no pre-judgments.",1100304000,4,1202,4.792270531400966

1803758,1,B0000797IO,"First, an ongoing quibble: WHY, oh why, must movies take cheap shots at religious characters in hopes of a laugh?  Does ""The Good Girl"" really intend us to think Justine implicating the only Christian in the movie (a stereotypically Bible-thumping one at that) in her adultery, and her husband and his best friend, with whom Justine actually HAS had sex, subsequently beating the crap out of the poor man, is funny?!

This movie seemed like a pathetic attempt at proving that Jennifer Aniston can act.  Small-town girl with a boring life = NOT Rachel, and apparently that's all it took for Aniston to sign on.  The movie accomplishes its goal in the sense that Aniston abandons all her Rachelian sprightliness for a single, forcedly dull facial expression, though her hair is still fashionably mussed (without the classic Texan perm and hairspray) and her clothing is cool-sloppy, a la the Gap.

By the time Aniston's character gets into bed with her husband's best friend to keep him quiet about her adulterous relationship with an underage, depressed clerk, the movie had already abandoned all hopes for good taste.  And maybe the last scene, with Justine and her husband snuggling her new baby, is supposed to be heartwarming, but Justine's ignorance as to her child's paternity is disturbing instead.  My sympathies, as much as they were engaged at all, lay with Justine's husband, the only even semi-innocent person in the movie, even if John Reilly's sad-faced cuckolds are getting a bit old.  His willingness to trust and forgive Justine was slightly touching--certainly better than she deserved.  Justine herself was easily ignorable, and that's the best that can be said for her.",1096502400,12,1688,5.043165467625899
1803759,3,B0000797IO,"Jennifer Anniston leads a carefully constructed yet deadening life as Justine in ""The Good Girl"".  In one of those dead-end Texas towns (which I suspect exist largely on backlots in Hollywood) Justine works a dead-end job at a local department store, is married to a dead-end shlub (the latest in a long line of amiable, moron-losers played by John C. Reilly) and has nothing to look forward to.  Bubba seems incapable of having that same perspective - largely because he spends most of his free time smoking pot with his best friend, Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson - late of ""Holes"" and ""Minority Report"").  Justine is that critical age, when people who had thought themselves young adults realize that middle-age is in sight, and they've got nothing to show for it.  The world that had seemed a candy store to her when she was young, now looks like death row - bereft of possibilities.  Things change with the arrival of Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal) a wide-eyed young dreamer who hates his life, but has ideas for changing things.  Holden is a dreamer who patterns his life on ""Catcher in the Rye"" and the sense that he was meant for bigger things than their town allows.  Sensing Justine's wanting spirit, Holden fixates on her, spurring feelings Justine as well.  Much of the ""Good Girl"" follows Justine's dilemma - stick with her hated existence, or take a chance on a reconstructed one with Holden.  Though soon realizing that Holden's sense of imagination means trouble, the dilemma only deepens, and Justine only pines harder for a new life that's increasingly unattainable.  Never making a final decision, Justine verges in one direction, then the other - spurning, then giving into Holden.  Unfortunately, Justine will also learn the consequences that her new relationship will have, and how the tottering of her carefully-balanced life affects the delicate illusions of life for those around her - Holden, her husband and even Bubba.

""The Good Girl"" veers between being a dark comedy and a serious character study - sort of like ""In the Bedroom"" with gallows humor.  The script pokes relentless fun at the small-town Texas characters (a compulsively fundamentalist security guard, a goth co-worker, and her dead-pan boss) but remains weighted down by Justine's abject life.  At its worst, ""Girl"" is also infected by the same annoyingly arch and flighty personality that drives Holden - but our lives aren't as bleak as Justine's, so we're not as easily fooled, and we're left with a script that tries to be much smarter than any of its players.  It's almost as if Holden wrote it.  If ""Girl"" does succeed it's because the leads put more soul into their characters than the script does - with kudos to Reilly and Nelson.  If Bubba and Justine's husband aren't exactly sympathetic characters, they are characters who manage to inject some surprise into their predictable roles.  In short, this isn't a flick for a light-night at home, but it's one you won't soon forget.",1095724800,7,2969,4.915831663326653

I suppose it can go either way, it just depends on the moviegoer. It's a very good movie, very slow paced and humdrum, which is altogether fitting. The characters are comical, but depressing to watch at the same time.

Justine (Aniston) is bored with her life, working day to day at the Retail Rodeo and putting up with her stoner husband Phil (marvelously played by John C. Reilly). Then one day she strikes up a conversation with new cashier Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal) and perhaps sees a bit of herself in him. Their relationship grows, though it's more like a weed than a rose.

Jake Gyllenhaal is fanstastic in this movie. His droopy look and depressed demeanor make his performance intensely believeable. Aniston also delivers, prooving that she's more than just Rachel on Friends. Zooey Deschanel also gives a great perfomance as one of Justine's co-workers, who does little to hide her anger that she has to work at the Retail Rodeo. This is a stellar cast!!Awesome script by Mike White, who also appears in the film as a bible-thumping security guard.

Go ahead and call 'em Odd Lots, Big Lots, Dollar General, Family Dollar, or the old fashioned phrase of Five & Dimes, but every town has one and usually they employ some strange people to boot Let me tell ya, there are LOADS of strange characters in ""The Good Girl"".

 Justine ""Teeny"" Last, played surprisingly & extraordinarily well by none other than Mrs. Brad Pitt/Jennifer Aniston is a clerk/cashier/cosmetics counter employee at the local Retail Rodeo. Who knew that Jennifer could really act? Not me! For her to break out of the Rachael mold was exciting to watch for I was quite pleased with her performance even though I am not a huge fan of ""Friends"".

 The unhappy, trapped in her loveless & babyless marriage, Justine meets the morose Tom Worther, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, the ""brandy new"" cashier at Retail Rodeo and well... they start up an affair. Tom is his ""slave name"" as he tells Justine, so he has re-named himself after ""The Catcher In The Rye"". Justine asks, so your name is ""Catcher""? He states, ""NO, Holden, from Holden Caulfield, the main character in the book.""

 Teeny and Holden start meetin' for their lovin' in the back store room of Retail Rodeo, the town's seedy motels, and even Teeny's car, they form a bond and above all else, seem to really understand one another like no one has understood either one of them before in their whole existence. They sweetly refer to it in the film as ""Gettin' Got""...

 Even Justine's pothead housepainter of a husband, Phil Last, played deftly by John C. Reilly (Boogie Nights) never has really ""got"" Justine.

 Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson) , Phil's best friend, co-painter & pot smoker in crime and his dog Bits find out about Holden and Justine and then things sure do git interestin'!

 Zooey Deschanel from ""Almost Famous"" has a hilarious part as Cheryl, a smart aleck and edgy store employee, Mike White as the gospel preachin' Nazarene security guard, ""Corney"", Deborah Rush as Gwen, and your Retail Rodeo Store Manager, Jack Field is played convincingly by John Carroll Lynch.

When she meets a new employee, a disturbed but more intellectual young man, she thinks she's found an escape from her daily drudgery.
From this point on, events spiral downhill and the movie becomes disappointingly predictable.  The element of surprise is lost and viewers are taken on a formulaic ride where predictable consequences come from foreseen actions.

1803780,4,B0000797IO,"Can Jennifer Aniston do anyting better than ""Rachel"" after the successful TV drama that went on very long (or too long)?  ""The Good Girl"" is the answer.  Yes, she can, and in a surprising way.
Justine (Aniston) is working at a mini-mart in Nowhereville, Texas, completely dissatisfied with the humdrum life with her pot-smoking husband (John C. Reiley), who just doesn't care anything about his life.  Her work is boring, always in a drab uniform which makes eveything in her life quite hopeless.
But one day, she notices that a young boy working in the same shop is interested in her.  She is attracted to this boy (Jake Gyllenhaal, ""Donnie Darko"") who has, however, a slightly troublesome tendency.  He calls himself ""Holden"" because, yes, he identified himself with that anti-hero of ""Catcher in the Rye,"" and like Holden, this boy perhaps thinks too much.
Now, Justine thinks: ""Could this strange boy is the last and only help offered to her?""  Can she escape from the dull reality of life?  And if escape, how and where?  It's the same case as Madame Bovary, whose name is briefly referred to in the film.
""The Good Girl,"" written by Mike White (who wrote alarmingly unique ""Chuck and Buck""), follows the life of Justine with a wry humor.  Written with skewed perspectives, the film is never predictable, giving us a few surprising moments and one very serious decision Justine has to make.  It is effectively supported by original characters played by Tim Blake Nelson, Zooey Deschanel, Deborah Rush, and Mike White himself as church-going guard.
Its dark humor is not for everybody's taste, and the undercurrent statement on life is often disturbing.  But Jennifer Aniston's acting as Justine is strong (though you may  still see something of Rachel in her.)  The film, in its own quiet way, will make you grin, and then think ... think particularly about life as it is, not as it should be.",1084060800,3,1898,4.8390092879256965
1803781,5,B0000797IO,"Jennifer Aniston's work has never struck me as being either deep or watchable, but I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and engaging quality of 'The Good Girl'.
Aniston's character, depressed and miserable in her marriage and in her job (a dead end job that she probably only ended up with because she was undereducated, a point another reviewer below sadly missed, judging by his misinterpretation of her response to a comment by her coworker regarding 'The Catcher In the Rye'), begins a friendship with a coworker several years younger than herself. She both enjoys and fears this relationship because although it makes her happy, she is terrified that her husband will find out about it. Her anxiety and fear increases when her husband's best friend finds out about her relationship and blackmails her into having sex with him.
She reaches a crossroads, a point at which she must choose between the husband she loves and despises in equal measure and the relationship that she had begun with her coworker.
I found it intriguing that when faced with what was the most important decision of her life, she made the choice that lead her back to the existence she hated. Ultimately, neither choice probably would have made her happy but she chose the path toward the familiar, deciding that the awful life she knew was preferable to a leap into the unknown. Her decision had dramatic, tragic consequences, both at work and at home.
Aniston's acting was brilliant. I was amazed and completely drawn in by the film and by her performance in particular. She has a genuine talent and range I was completely unaware of, and now I'm anxious to see her future projects. 'The Good Girl' is wonderful in every aspect, from the writing to the cast, and the direction is flawless, lending a very real sense of the desolation and loneliness that is this woman's day to day existence.

""The Good Girl"" is like no movie I've ever seen.  That's not a compliment, and it's not a criticism, it's just an observation.  I don't want to pigeonhole it into any one genre.  The movie has plenty of very funny moments, but it's not a comedy.  It's also rather depressing (at first) but it's not ""black.""  It's dramatic, but can't really be classified as a typical drama (although that's the section it's in at the video store).
In short, it's just a bunch of stuff that happens.
THE GOOD:
There are a lot of very funny moments that will have you laughing out loud- sometimes at moments that you're not sure you should be laughing.  The cast performs every character in ""The Good Girl"" superbly, from Jennifer Aniston's ramshackle Justine to Jake Gyllenhaal's sullen Holden to Justine's slovenly but affable husband Phil (played by John C. Reilly).  Of course, I must mention Zooey Deschanel as cynical cashier Cheryl, one of the funniest and all-around best supporting acting performances I've ever seen.  And yes, I am now officially a fan of Jennifer Aniston, even though I'm decidedly a non-fan of ""Friends"" (I tried watching it after seeing ""The Good Girl,"" but couldn't get into it).
THE BAD:
Although the acting is great, it sometimes seems like they're acting in different movies.  Holden's movie is a bleak tragedy, Justine's is a finding-yourself drama, and Phil's is ""Half Baked"" (cheap joke, I know).  Justine is a hard character to empathize with, because you come to dislike Justine's paramour Holden more than her husband.
However, you do want Justine to find happiness.  But you know it's going to be hard for her to do so with any of the people in the movie.  She's not a heroine, she's not a villain; she's just a human.  She screwed up and she knows it.  It'll help to keep in mind while watching this movie that all it's characters should not be looked at as either protagonists or antagonists, they should be looked at as humans.
The movie left me a little depressed after watching it, but the more I thought about it the more I liked it.  It's a good cautionary tale.  One of the things that tells me if a movie is good or not is how much it sticks with me after I see it.  I rented this, watched it twice, and cannot get it out of my head.  I'm planning to buy it.

The vulnerability of (lower?) middle class, the desperation in people endowed with limited choices and the moral dilemma they face with regard to decisions impacting family.
For those with an eye for subtlety and belief in myriad goodness of human emotions, this is a must-see. The morality of small time (self-made?) capitalist in Retail Rodeo owner, who cares for the health of his team and bereaves the dead; the unsung bond that willy-nilly develops between a couple regardless of fertility or masochism and many other nuances.

But all the characters in this screenplay are rich with texture; and all actors here with a speaking part are memorable.  Not necessarily because of what they do so much as who they are.  The depth of this movie is so subtle that it will probably be missed by most people.  All the actors here play their characters to the hilt.  From the Goth-chic check-out girl to the Bible-thumping security guard, they all enter your mind and linger.  John C. Reilly, the most reliable supporting actor in the business, is excellent as the sturdy but flawed husband.  Jake Gyllenhaal, of ""Donnie Darko"" cult fame, is mesmerizing as the ""demon"" in Jennifer Aniston's life.  But the jewel in this film is Jennifer Aniston, with her touching performance that comes across real and surreal, emotional and confused, subject to fantasy but grounded.

1803796,2,B0000797IO,"""The Good Girl"" starts out as an honest, unsentimental, and modest film (a la the amazing ""You Can Count On Me"") but quickly loses it's focus and falls victim to what independent movies are not supposed to do, which is sacrife characters for plot development.
When we firt meet Justine, played in a very un-""Rachel"" manner by Jennifer Aniston, we see small-town woman desperate to escape all aspects of her monotonous life. Her discount-retail job feels like prison, she's married to a stoner who seems to connect more with his best buddy than her, and seems to yearn to have a chance to do it all over again as all her dreams seem more than gone. She might as well be dead.
Without giving too much away, I can say that when she meets a sullen 22-year-old named Tom (Jake Gyllenhaal) who for his own reasons seems to want out of this world. It isn't long before their friendship becomes an affair, and I'll leave the rest to you if you have not seen the movie.
As good as Aniston's performance is, and it's a gem, Gyllenhaal seems to truly become his character. It's a performance like few I've seen in a while and for a while makes for a promising movie.

The whole getting to know you process is well supported by strong supporting performances and the director's eye for small town desperation. The huge problem in this movie is almost everything that follows plotwise after the aforementioned two characters meet and start to get to know one another.
Despite the strength of the performances, this film never quite realizes the poignancy it seems to be aiming so it tries to fake it with plot twists to add punch to what started out as a great character study. The movie slowly starts to self-destruct by creating unbelievable dramatic scenarios and situations that belong in another movie or third rate soap opera needing shockers. Two major life threatening developments take place and I can't say which one is handled worse as one is just thrown in for good measure while the other is weighed down by sappy movie of the week melodrama.
There is one moment towards the end of this movie where it has a chance of getting back on course but choses to go for a big, multi-character ""payoff"", which is unnecessary in a film of this scope. The ending is an unearned as it is unsatisfying as it neatly wraps up people/events/feelings which should never be given such thoughtless treatment.
I am very disappointed by this film as I enjoyed the director's debut and here he seems to be suffering from a major sophomore jinx. I hope that his next project goes back to starting out with a strong script and avoids the need to heighten the magnitude of his work by using cheap plot twists.",1070150400,7,2684,4.603340292275574

Sure it had a few comical parts (especially the lady who gave make-overs, plus a pretty good cast). But I could've wrote this movie myself, I guessed what would happen within the first 20 minutes of this ridiculous time wasting movie, almost in a jokingly way and everything I predicted was right.

They begin having an affair and she puts her job and marriage on the line.
This movie is a dark comedy and Jennifer Aniston does a great job conveying the misery and disillusionment the character feels.  There are scenes in this that are hilarious while others are disturbing.  I know people just like this and felt it was more real than most of the movies out there.  Of course, there are times you want to kick Justine especially when she sleeps with Bubba but I guess that's the point.  People do crazy things out of boredom and desperation.  So the Good Girl isn't a good girl in the traditional sense.  She was a good girl gone bad.  The thing about her that irked me was that her life wasn't all that bad and she could have taken a class or done something positive rather than have an affair.
Ok, this might be a spoiler...
At the end, she has to realize what is more important: escaping her life or doing what is right.  I feel she made the right choice.

Justine and Holden instantly relate because they're both put upon by society, they hate their lives, and they're looking for an escape.

1803801,1,B0000797IO,"This is a thouroughly dissapointing movie. The plot is driven by deus ex machina, and in moments of crisis the characters do not stay true to themselves. I could not empathise with Jennifer Aniston's character who unforgivably brings about misery into the lives of many people. Sure, that could have worked, but why is it that in the first few scenes Aniston's primary concern is the damage she will cause her husband, yet she is able to have a complete change of heart by the finale (I won't spoil it!). The support cast are entertaining, but nonetheless limited to the stereotypes the writer chose to play them as. The problem with this was the 'suburban misery' lacked any insight, and I for one failed to care. The choice to use voice over was explainatory - i.e. ""Oh, I am so miserable in this hick bible bashin' town"" - and utterly depressing to think that someone would CHOOSE to stay so miserable. This is a poor attempt at minimalism, it was patronising, poorly told and lacked insight. Jake Gyllenhaal was especially disappointing to be playing the same character type from Donnie Darko, all over again. He is a good actor who could go along way if given the chance - The Good Girl offers nonesuch oppurtunity. ""Leaving Las Vegas"" does what ""The Good Girl"" strives for, far more effectively if a downer is your cup of tea.",1067817600,9,1332,4.648305084745763

One could think of this movie as a candy store, with it's various asthetic delights.  The scenary, the actors, the script.
Let us not dwell on the magnificent display of talent Jennifer Aniston has in The Good Girl, with her slow way of speaking, her schlumpy body posture, her every being resonating the hopelessness her character, Justine, feels.  It's Oscar worthy and the Academy made a huge mistake.
But let us focus instead on the stellar cast that are just pitch-perfect to every line of Mike White's screenplay.  They round out the story perfectly, paralleling Justine's transformation to quiet brooding housewife/cashier to adultress.
The movie is also filmed beautifully, with vibrant scenes shifting throughout the various seasons, also mirroring the shift of Justine's character and integrity.  It's like Phil( Justine's husband)'s line. ""The wind. It's blowing different.""  Justine undergoes a radical change in character, making poor choices and being anything but good. But at the core, she is 'the good girl'..she does what is right. What is expected.
'The Good Girl' is at best, a dark comedy that deftly drives the idea home that the choices we make are everlasting, and they affect everyone around us.",1066089600,2,1275,5.140096618357488

Well, Jennifer did a surprisingly good job. It represented fairly well the drab and bleak existence of those of us with useless jobs and not much to look forward to, which is crucial because it would be an insult to do otherwise.

I can personally relate to ""Holden"", and Jake pulled that character off fabulously. He was just so apathetic and misanthropic, it was great. Notice how his last name, Werther,  is taken from the German tragedy ""The Sorrows of Young Werther"" (pronounced vair-tair) by Goethe, which this film could almost--but not quite--pass as an adaptation of. The end is directly lifted from that tale, at least the end as far as jake's character goes.
Of course, like any other red-blooded American male, I was primarily interested in Jennifer's first sex scene. Bravo to her for going for it, but of course the lack of any distinct nudity is cause for lament.
Ultimately the film was a great vehicle for Jennifer to show her stuff (talents, I mean) and she definitely steals the show. Very entertaining, but certainly not the ""comedy"" that it is mysteriously being sold as.",1064102400,,1272,4.8842592592592595

1803812,3,B0000797IO,"After hearing reviews of Jennifer Aniston's(the not so good ""good girl"")most recent cinematic achievement, I was interested.  I had no idea of the intensity, the raw reality of it, and that Mike White, a scriptwriter in need of serious psychotherapy, had written it.
The story is about the miserable Justine(Aniston), unhappily married to Pothead Phil(John C. Reilly), and very soon to be adultress with Holden(Jake Gyllenhaal).
Justine works at the Retail Rodeo at the make up counter.  An odd ensemble of characters works there, and it is where she meets Holden.  Both caught up in their miserable lives, they
""Get each other"".
Once Justine wants the breaks put on it all, is where things really start to get weird. Holden becomes obsessive about Justine.  She isn't sure what she wants out of life, and she isn't sure who Holden really is much less herself.
Life for our ""good girl"" just keeps getting weirder and weirder, and the more I watched Justine and her reactions to the bizarre situations that arise, the more I kept thinking, this is not a good person.  Just what is Mike White trying to prove here? That a very dishonest woman who cheats on her husband is good.  If that's good, I would hate to see his version of bad.
I know I know, I could've shut it off. But I was intrigued. and I was blown away at the acting of Aniston, Reilly, and Gyllenhaal.  They were all brilliant and really gave their all to these oddball characters.
Do I recommend this movie?  If you like Mike White's body of work maybe.  If you can appreciate watching a movie of stark reality(as I know ""good girls"" like this one) and some of the best acting of the year 2002, this might be a good rental choice.",1059868800,,1693,4.598006644518272
1803813,5,B0000797IO,"I got this film because I really enjoyed Mike White's first script, Chuck and Buck, but I have to admit I was skeptical about Jennifer Aniston; however, the script was as good as I'd hoped and Aniston did a wonderful job as Justine, a bored clerk at Retail Rodeo and the childless wife of stoned housepainter Phil (John C. Reilly). She even wears horrible clothes! Aniston's voiceover is very good, and adds to the story, and the cast is flawless, from Phil's friend Bubba and Jake Gyllenhall's Holden/Tom to all the interesting characters at Retail Rodeo. The subplot of the store's cosmetic makeovers is also very funny. There are some great visuals here, incuding an overhead shot of employees pouring out of the store to grieve a coworker.

I think this film is similar to About Schmidt but with some crucial differences. While Schmidt has been detached from his family and is trying to connect again, Justine has been bled dry by her boring work and her marriage and her friends, and she seeks instead to detach herself -- if only she had the energy to do something desperate! Then she meets a new employee, Holden, an attractive but troubled young guy who brings her excitement and joy -- for a while.  As Justine realizes that other people know about her indiscretion, she sees that what was once fun has become complicated and tawdry.

MILD SPOILER: In one incredible series of scenes, Justine makes love to Holden, then is blackmailed by Bubba into having sex with him (the look on her face while she waits for him to finish is wonderful), and then she has to let Phil hold her breast while he masters his domain at a fertility clinic.  (These scenes are reminiscent of a funny little movie that come out in 1968 called Candy, in which every guy Candy meets wants to seduce her and uses his own bizarre line/style to get her into bed.)

You can watch the film in English or Spanish, and you have the same choices for subtitles.  There is a commentary track featuring writer/actor Mike White and director Miguel Arteta as well as 14 minutes of comments by Aniston; 9 deleted scenes totalling about 8 minutes; and a  2-1/2-minute gag reel (including a very brief shot of two unfamiliar young guys sitting on a bed -- anybody know what that is?).",1059868800,3,2252,4.64321608040201
1803814,4,B0000797IO,"""Bruce Almighty"" is obviously the movie in which Jennifer Aniston is the leading lady that has made the most money, but it is by no means a Jennifer Aniston film.  If she wants to point to something other than ""Friends"" to show what she can do as an actress then ""The Good Girl"" is probably going to be her first choice.  In this 2002 film from director Miguel Arteta she plays Justine, a 30-year-old clerk who is bored to tears by her job at Retail Rodeo where the only excitement is when Cheryl (Zooey Deschanel) makes one of her ""Attention, Shoppers"" announcements over the public address system and starts spewing insults and bizarre nonsense.  Cheryl is dispatched to doing makeovers for women customers (whatever is management thinking?), while Justine notices Holden (Jake Cyllenhaal), the new kid at the store who is reading ""The Catcher in the Rye"" and who dispenses its wisdom to his new friend.  Holden's name is really Tom, which makes his ranks about hypocrisy rather ironic, but clearly he is the first breeze of any kind in Justine's life in a long, long time.  Whatever his name, a college dropout sure beats what is waiting for her at home.
Justine is married to Phil (John C. Reilly), who paints houses and always wishes it was raining so he can keep watching television.  Justine would like it if he bothered to fix the television set and to have himself tested to see if he is the reason they have not had a child.  Phil spends more time with his best buddy, Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson).  During the day they paint houses and during the night they smoke weed and watch the tube.  Bubba thinks of Justine as the ideal woman and having turned his back on ever having a relationship of his own with a woman vicariously enjoys the happy marriage of his best friend.  No wonder Justine falls pretty to Holden's advances and their first tryst at a fleabag motel turns into grabbing every possible opportunity to do it again.  Unfortunately, the amorous couple are seen and in an escalating series of events we wonder how high of a price Justine is going to have to pay.

""The Good Girl"" does not represent so much the dark side of Jennifer Aniston as it does the sad side.  You know that in every small town in America there is a girl with looks but without ambition who parlays her attractiveness into marrying a local stud who would never get out of that town alive.  Actually, none of this background is mentioned in the film, but it makes sense that Phil must have done something in the past to get a girl like Justine.  What is important in this film is that whatever he had and whatever he offered Justine it is long gone.  This is a marriage that has no reason to exist beyond the fact that it does, which helps explain the resolution of this film as much as anything.  The performance by the four principles are solid enough, and the supporting cast offers a variety of eccentrics that flesh out this particular seedy little town.  ""The Good Girl"" is as much a character study as anything else and whatever its limitations finds a large measure of redemption in the final scene between husband and wife.",1059350400,,3122,4.554561717352415
1803815,2,B0000797IO,"Sometimes a film can have a performance in it that is so good, and yet in the end you find yourself asking, `What's the Point?' That's the way I felt sitting through Michael Arteta's (Star Maps) THE GOOD GIRL, a film with one great character and many unrealized ones.
Jennifer Aniston (Picture Perfect) plays Justine, a clerk at a local Wal-Mart type store somewhere in west bumblefreak Texas. It's a small town where everybody knows your name, and more than likely everybody knows what your up too. When Justine begins to have an affair with a local boy named Holden (Jake Gyllenhal, Donnie Darko) Justine's life begins to unravel.
THE GOOD GIRL is a good movie. It has some heart and it has some really good laughs. It is also has a nice small town feel to it. Everything has that lower middle class waffle house look, and of course in any other film I'd expect a satirical look at this world, where all the characters are too big for their britches, but there is enough authenticity here that gives the film a strong visual feel.
Jennifer Aniston is wonderful as Justine. It's miles away from anything she's ever done before. This A-List Hollywood actress gets frumpy, without looking out of place. Every one of her character arcs is full and realized and in the end it's a gut wrenching performance without her having to go over the top.
There is a tendency in Hollywood films to play every horrible revelation in a melodramatic fashion. This film is full of death, birth, love, and humiliation and everything is understated. This works for the film when they concern the lead character. Those beats are powerful and strong.
It's when the subplots of the story branch off into the bizzaro world of the minor characters that I felt the movie lost its credibility. A character dies in the film on a note that felt fake and we soon learn that it was designed to emphasize a joke at the very end of the movie, that isn't very funny. I also didn't appreciated the, I won't tell your husband sex scene that also branched off into a world of stupidity.
Much of the problems with those scenes are that while Justine's character is fully realized none of the supporting cast seems to be. Ghyllenhal's Holden has two modes, over-stated and understated and they never quite gel. While he does a good job with his character his moods are motivated not by true character but by plot developments. I wish the screenplay by Mike White (Chuck and Buck) had played with the `Catcher and the Rye' character they kept alluding too. But alas he felt half-realized and that's a shame.
Also John C. Rielly (Chicago) and Tim Blake Nelson's (Oh Brother Where Art Thou) Bubba and Phil are also half realized. Two characters whom you wanted so much more from than sperm problems and silly infatuations. I really wanted to know more how these guys ticked, but alas most of what they gave back was underwhelming.
My final beef with the film is it's unbearably slow, and the end is kind of a let down. There's a perfect moment where Justine is at a crossroads it's a really great climax, and when she makes that final decision and the film goes on for 15 more minutes. Why? To try to tie thins up. I wished they had left them dangling.
Yes I have may problems with the Good Girl but I still think it's a good film, if anything to prove Jennifer Aniston could have a career past FRIENDS. Let hope she keeps making films like these. But she probably won't.",1058918400,5,3429,4.5591572123176665

1803817,3,B0000797IO,"I don't know if I just missed it between the rather disgusting sex scenes, but I didn't catch the theme of this story. I really liked the acting - Jake Gylenhaal is proving himself to be a big new talent, Jennifer Aniston was great as always, and John C. Riley turned up a fantastic supporting role with next to nothing script-wise. However, I didn't really get if this was supposed to be a movie about corruption or redemption. The whole beginning of the movie seems to suggest the former, but the ending doesn't fit with that. In the end, Justine's voice over (which may have been the best part of the movie)declared that she had two choices to make. It was never really clarified why she made the one she did. In any case, the plot of this movie would have led to two or even one star (the many times lackluster dialogue and unclear theme were a little too much for me), the great acting turned in by Gylenhaal (Who was intense and a little creepy), Riley (who turned his dope addicted character into a very sympathetic one), and, yes, Aniston (who did a very good job, but not great) brought this movie up out of the gutter to give it three stars. For all the hype, 'The Good Girl' wasn't really very good. If you want to see Gylenhall, Aniston, and Riley in separate, good movies, try 'Donnie Darko', 'The Object of My Affection', or 'Chicago'. 'The Good Girl' tries to be deep, but it only scrapes the surface. Worth a rent, but don't waste your money on the tape.",1057449600,4,1470,4.408088235294118
1803818,4,B0000797IO,"Before watching The Good Girl all that I had heard of it was that Jennifer Aniston was very good in the role.  In fact there's a lot more to it than that.  The movie concerns a bored 30 year-old woman Justine (Aniston) who begins to wonder whether her life could take a more exiciting turn than her dull life with her husband after meeting young co-worker Holden.  Rapidly beginning a passionate affair with him Justine suddenly discovers that passion and excitement can be found even in the most hopeless of places.  What makes the film special really though is the fact that The Good Girl doesn't fulfill the audience's dream.  If Justine had run away from her yobbish husband and found happiness with a younger lover it would have been a beautifully evoked yet still simplistic story.  As it is each character has their own complexities and in the end it is the question over whether passion and excitement are mere pipe dreams or whether there are some people who are just content to give up on them is driven home so subtly yet resolutely by the end that you cannot help but identify with such realistic characters that have no idea as to the answers just as the audience doesn't.
The acting, just as hyped, is sublime.  Aniston sheds Rachel of Friends forever and proves once and for all that if one of the cast has a chance of making it big in the movies then it's her.  Her endearing nature and ability to act like a down-to-earth shop assistant and really make you believe that underneath it all she harbors the same disappointments and regrets as everyone else is extraordinary.  Aniston's performance is superbly supported by Jake Gyllenhaal (who made such a fascinating breakthrough in Donnie Darko), who plays the young co-worker who offers Justine an opportunity to escape.  For those who might have worried that he would be unable to put in anything but a darkly intense performance as he did in Donnie Darko, he lightens up significantly in his love of Justine.  He, just like Aniston, is though equally able to play two sides to the persona, as his obsessive nature gradually takes over his love.  For Magnolia fans there's also a gentle turn from the increasingly popular John C. Reilly.  This makes it the kind of cast that any well-versed movie fan will relish.
Whilst it's true that The Good Girl may not be as humorous as it has been deemed, it is nonetheless one of the most impressive movies to have been released during the past year.  Its complexities and involved character interrelations in addition to a script that fails to pander to an audience that may want an easy resolution ensure that it will stand out as one of the forerunners in an indie scene that is becoming evermore popular.",1057449600,,2717,4.668763102725367

A film that should have been about love, loyalty, and desire for something more than the odinary, turned into one completely about sex. With so much potential and honest acting, it is a shame that ""The Good Girl"" turned out the way it did. I wish I could recommend this movie, but the crudeness of it outweighs all of its positive aspects.

Perhaps the movie IS boring in a way, but this was only done to portray the dull, lower middle-class lifestyle that the wife (Jennifer Aniston) has lived out each and every day. She gets to a point where she begins to question whether she's taken the right path in her life and whether she wants to continue it or to  start a new one. That is the entire focus of the film, and there are certainly a lot of people who could relate to this premise.
The cast is very good, but the actor I specifically want to mention is Tim Blake Nelson, who plays the husband's idiot friend, Bubba. He's such a riot!

Ms. Aniston stars as Justine Last, a thirty-year old woman who is caught in a dead-end job at a store called Retail Rodeo and in a stagnant marriage to Phil (John C. Reilly).  Phil is a shiftless slob who is constantly sitting in front of the television smoking dope with his painting co-worker, Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson).  At work Justine starts falling for a troubled new cashier, Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal).  Holden is a twenty-two year old college dropout and has a troubled life of his own.  His real name is Tom, but he adopted the name Holden from Catcher In The Rye and he wants to be a writer.  Just like Holden Caufield, Tom has psychiatric problems, but he makes Justine feel alive again and they enter into a [love] affair.  Justine is torn between her love for Holden and the guilt she feels for having an adulterous relationship.  Justine and Phil are trying to have kids, but have been unsuccessful and in one very humorous scene at fertility clinic, Phil asks Justine to help him in providing the clinic with a sample.  Justine does become pregnant, but the movie leaves it uncertain to who is the father.  One is lead to believe its Holden, because the fertility clinic tells Phil that his sperm is no good, but they never divulge the secret.  At the end of the film, Holden robs the Retail Rodeo of about $20,000.  He asks Justine to run away with him and Justine must decide whether she goes with Holden or stays with Phil.  The film is a dark and somewhat depressing tale, but is tempered nicely with comic relief, most notably provided by Zooey Deschanel as Cheryl, an acerbic co-worker of Justines at the Retail Rodeo.  She starts the film off as the P.A. announcer in the store and her bizarre and hilarious announcements on store specials are priceless and she has the habit of slipping the most inappropriate words into her sales pitches to customers at the cosmetic counter where she applies the most garish makeup looks to be both herself and customers.  John Carroll Lynch is an underrated character actor and he gives yet another strong and under appreciated performance as Retail Rodeos store manager.  Director Miquel Arteta creates a perfect visual landscape for the film.  The dusty and windy setting of the nameless Texas town where the story takes place fits the despair of the film and screenwriter Mike White adds all the right touches to the script as well as acting as a security guard at Retail Rodeo who is a religious zealot.  In the end, this film relies on Ms. Anistons performance.  The film tries to make her look unglamorous and douty and that doesnt quite work, but she gives a very strong performance and is worthy of the praise she received for the role.  I wouldnt go so far to say it was Oscar worthy, but it is by far the best acting job she has done outside of her brilliant work on Friends and it was definitely among the ten or fifteen performances from an actress in 2002",1053561600,3,3097,4.576086956521739

Although Jennifer Aniston is the ""name"" on the box, this is, in reality, a very strong ensemble piece, with each actor bringing great things to their characters, no matter how little time we see them on screen.  The casting is brilliant all the way around.  This is a touching story about average people, which is what makes it so powerful.  As viewers, we can recognize ourselves and our loved ones in the characters.  In a market saturated by simplistic ""good guy"" ""bad guy"" sterotypes, this script and film encourage us, as the audience, to really THINK and to consider the multi-faceted emotions, decisions, complications, and actions that make us human.  We are able to see our own strenghths and faults inthe characters as they evolve; we are able to empathise because we relate to the dillemas in whch the characters find themselves.  This script is wonderful, and obviously owes its inspiration to John Steinbeck's little-known play ""Burning Bright"".  ""The Good Girl"" does a wonderful job giving Steinbeck's play a modern edge, and makes it truly accessible for the viewing audience.  I highly recommend this film for anyone looking for a thought-provoking and enjoyable movie.  If you're looking for brain candy, this is not the one.",1052611200,,1276,5.033333333333333
1803837,3,B0000797IO,"This movie has received so much attention that it is really hard to rate. Jennifer Aniston does manage to shake off the cloak of Rachel which is a good thing as she had become stuck in a rut but I wouldn't say that it was Oscar worthy, although there are some good moments, usually when she is in close up.
Aniston plays Justine, a clerk at Retail Rodeo who is bored to tears with her life and her stoner husband Phil. She is attracted to Holden, a new cashier who is depressed, younger and claims to be a frustrated writer. The movie revolves around their affair, the way Justine feels that she is becoming ""bad"" and the decisions she makes in her attempt to become ""good"" again.
It is a comedy, and this is done to make the tragedy appear more real, the most comedic parts being Anistons narration which is in excellent deadpan, and some of the peripheral characters, especially Zooey Deschanels bored clerk.
The biggest problem I have is in Justines relationships. John C. Reilly is great as her husband but you can't see how they ended up together in the first place and because you don't care about their relationship until the end, you don't care about her having an affair either. I had trouble sensing any spark between her and Holden either, he is so depressed and depressing I can't see where any passion could have arisen. It is easier to imagine them getting drunk together and passing out. The directors did say that Justine was written as more stupid than Aniston played her and maybe that caused the disconnect. The performances are all good so maybe it is the writing or direction. It just seems that this movie came really close but just missed hitting the spot.",1052006400,2,1679,4.562913907284768

The skinny: he falls in love, becomes obsessed, gets her pregnant,  robs the retail store and then......I won't blow the ending.  Did I mention she was married to John C Reilly? Anyway, she tells him the baby is his and they live happily ever after in Normalsville.  The story drags, though there is a very suspenseful pivotal moment for her (at a stoplight), but overall the film falls flat.

It defies any category, but that seems to be the writer's method.  He was responsible for the equally disorienting CHUCK AND BUCK!  Jennifer Aniston plays a bored cosmetics cashier in a small Texas town that dreams of something more, even if she has no idea what that MORE is.  In a strange series of events she becomes living proof of ""Be careful what you wish for.""  The cast is great, and the story is moving even if it moves at the slow pace of the town she is living in.
Much has been made of the moral ambiguity of the film.  I think it captures a poignant struggle for anybody when they realize the choices they have made and begin to question them.  The ironic title adds to this ambiguity.  It's a movie about a moral crossroads where a girl has to chose what is right and what is wrong for herself.
The DVD includes full-screen and widescreen versions of the film, a commentary with the director and screenplay author, a ""selected scenes"" commentary with Jennifer (which clocks in at 15 minutes maybe), gag reel (mostly people flubbing takes and laughing), deleted scenes, and the usual lot of trailers and photographs.  Transfer is great!  It looks better than when I saw it at the theatre, but remember it's a low budget film with a purposefully low budget look.",1050883200,6,1426,4.574803149606299

The basic principle--that people can be moved to dumb acts by boredom/dissatisfaction--is good enough. But the film tries too hard to be too many things. At moments it's a comedy; at other moments, it's dark. The humor is brought along by Zooey Deschanel's terrifically irreverent performance--applying Kabuki-like makeup to hapless customers and delivering nutty, unheard PA announcements to store customers. John C. Reilly is sweetly unpredictable as Aniston's good-natured, ...smoking, clunkhead husband. The camera loves Aniston and she's intriguing to watch; it's just not entirely clear who she's supposed to be--she doesn't quite manage to inhabit the character of Justine to the extent that she's believably almost as much of a clunkhead as her husband. And unlike his astonishing performance in Donnie Darko, Gyllenhaal just doesn't pull it off this time. He's not at all sympathetic. Again, he plays off the surface of Holden, without burrowing in deep to bring enough to the character to make us care. See this film for Zooey; she's hilarious and delivers the only completely three-dimensional character.",1050192000,,1192,5.345744680851064

Jennifer Aniston stars as a bored girl exhausted by her supermarket job, and her pot-smoking dull and lifeless husband. Entranced by the gothic self-styled Holden from Salinger's <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>, Aniston's character decides to risk everything -- which is pretty much nothing -- and have a fling. The fling turns into one of those languishing romances where the nerd-boy threatens to commit suicide should she leave him. Meanwhile her husband's best friend catches her at a motel with this kid and threatens to squeal should she fail to sleep with him as well.
Lameness escapes in every minute of this mangled, lifeless waste of precious time. Dull and pedantic, the character's go through a mindless dance with forgetable scenarios and a plot so thickly-lined with stupidity it leaves you with a sense of general dread for not having stopped the insanity when you still had a chance.
Avoid this movie. It is _terrible_.",1049500800,4,1186,4.818627450980392
1803843,4,B0000797IO,"Having read several reviews of this movie before renting it, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Some people seem to think it's a comedy, others think it's a ""dark"" comedy, and others claim it's a bleak drama. The truth is, it's not a movie that comes with a built-in genre indicator, which may be why some reviewers found it so frustrating. Certainly, if one was hoping for a light-hearted comedy, this movie would be a big disappointment. Jennifer Aniston plays a young woman stuck in a dead-end retailing job in a dead-end town in a dead-end life...her husband is a well-meaning schmuck and throughout the film she wears this look on her face like life has already passed her by. When a dark and brooding new co-worker exchanges meaningful looks with her, an ill-fated romance begins that is clearly more about her needing to find an escape from her life than any actual connection between the two of them. Things quickly become complicated.  Not in a wacky comedy kind of way, but more in a real-life kind of way. People at work are noticing them spending too much time together. Her husband's best friend catches on and uses the information to blackmail her. Soon, Jennifer Aniston is stuck in a situation that has no ""right"" answers. Ultimately, ""The Good Girl"" is a morally ambiguous film that challenges the viewer to form her/his own opinion about the lead character's choices.  Are moral compromises inevitable? Is it fair to put one's own happiness before one's responsibilities? Is romantic self-destruction really all that romantic, or is it just a way to distract oneself from the daily grind? A very satisfying movie with no easy answers, ""The Good Girl"" has none of the gloss and glitter of a Hollywood film.

 Jennifer Aniston is searching for more, more than what she has.  Working all day in a super-market, going home to a man she doesn't really love, then doing the whole thing over and over and over again. Because of her inability to change her environment, she has an affair with a younger man who works at the super-market too, who just happens to have as many problems as she has.  Unfortunately, adding to her dismal existence.
The entire film is filled with dissatisfied, robotic, people who cannot or will not change.  Who accept the situations they are in.  Who are, put mildly, stuck in a big, fat rut.
In reality, many people are living like this.  Just settling for whatever it is they feel they deserve.  A loveless marriage, a job they detest, no direction.

The title is really a question, because the audience can go back and forth as to whether Jennifer Aniston's character is truly an innocent person in a bad situation or the product of her own bad decisions.  She is one of those people you know who always have bad luck but when you break it down they really just make poor choices.  You never know whether to tell such a person that they're to blame or to just let them vent.  In THE GOOD GIRL, I rooted for Aniston early and felt that she was in a bad situation, but as the movie unfolded and we saw her make many bad decisions and eventually those decisions seemed like a life pattern.  The movie is really funny in a dark way, but also sad in that she doesn't really learn any lessons from her experiences.  She does a lot of harm throughout the movie but barely recognizes it.

1803879,4,B0000797IO,"I frequently experience the one-hour mark in a film as the threshold of disinterest. Something about the writing often loses coherence after an hour or so. The Good Girl firmly held my interest for just about that long. Jennifer Aniston, in particular, is so compelling at first that it is easy to become lost inside your wish to continue getting to know her indefinitely. She is a women full of longing and despair for whom everything is ceasing to matter. Suddenly there is another soul within her reach whom she fantasizes may share her sense of displacement and ennui. A boy, really, just on the verge of finding out that craving for drugs and alcohol is nothing compared to the extreme states desire for a women can produce. The two are each in their own way existentially adrift and trying their best to cope with the increasing sense of alienation they feel. Desire fulfilled is initially highly pleasurable for the lovers and they believe they are falling in love. But Justine is found out  (she is married) as they pursue an almost impossibly stupid liaison at a local hotel. This is the moment the narrative fails for me. All the tension so carefully cultivated to this critical juncture is dissipated in a flash. Action takes over. Too bad. I wish the director might have had the courage to explore more fully  what was happening between Justine  and Holden (her young partner in crime) as they explode out of their castings and give life to passion and a child. But what certainly rings true in The Good Girl is that in too many instances passion when ignited is fueled by the reality that someone is going to get fried for having wantonly entered into the territory of transgression. I think here of Damage (directed by Louis Malle) where the true price of transgression is calculated viscerally during every moment of that story. In The Good Girl a believable confrontation with the inevitability of doom is forsaken, sacrificed to contrived action with the need for a neat resolution stealing the subtle resonances, created during early story development, at every turn. John C. Reilly gives a self-less performance of great subtly as Aniston's cuckolded husband in The Good Girl. And Jake Gyllenhaal has moments of brilliance in his role as Aniston's lover. But primarily  it is Jennifer Aniston's work which carries the storyline and holds our attention throughout this effort. She is a good girl with a naughty streak.

1803890,4,B0000797IO,"Jennifer Aniston breaks out of her ""Friends"" persona to play a bored housewife desperately trying to make a change in her life. Aniston totally transforms herself to play this role. Not just in terms of adopting a southern accent, but also in terms of body language. Jennifer moves and behaves in ways that we have never seen her before and should be commended for it. Another notable aspect of her performance is her ability to get the audience to root for her despite some questionable choices her character makes in the film. She deservedly got an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Female Lead.
The film is peppered with a host of interesting characters as a result of Mike White's off beat screenplay. He's written some very funny lines here. Tim Blake Nelson, who plays ""Bubba"" in the film, get one of the bigger laughs with the line, ""I want to be a slut. A lesbian slut."" Another one comes after ""Justine"" (Aniston) when she asks Jake Gyllenhaal's character why his parents call him ""Tom"" instead of ""Holden,"" that she knows him by. You'll have to see the film for that one.
There some intriguing plot developments that take the viewer on an unpredictable ride to the finish. Without giving away the ending, I'll just say that it is not a ""Hollywood"" one. This may not sit well with the crowd that likes formulaic ""by the book"" stories.

Perhaps it has something to do with being transplanted to California from a life in Kentucky that I know would have wound up just like Justine's.  But I know there is more at work here to make this film so thought-provoking.
The basic plot, without spoiling anything, is this:  Justine is a young married woman whose husband is a gentle but somewhat slow pothead.  She involves herself with Holden, a co-worker, hoping for a temporary diversion from what she sees as the dead end of her life.  She underestimates Holden's immaturity, however, and her efforts to reverse her initial poor decision cause things to get more and more out of control for her.  Yes, it isn't a terribly action-filled plot, but who of us leads a life that would read like a James Bond film if summarized in five sentences?  And therein lies the genius of this little film: accurately reproducing the little mannerisms and patterns that mark day-to-day life.
The script, written by supporting actor Mike White, contains some geniunely comic moments.  The character of Cheryl, Justine's sarcastic co-worker, provides consistent humor, and Zooey Deschanel steals all of her scenes.  However, the poignant and dramatic scenes could easily have come off as cheesy if portrayed by actors any less accomplished than the ones cast.  Jennifer Aniston gained my complete respect with this performance, which is leagues away from anything she has done in comedies or for TV.  She portrays Justine's quiet desperation with finesse and expressiveness.  Jake Gyllenhaal, reprising the ""disturbed young man"" role he did so well in ""Donnie Darko"", manages to express a range of emotions with very little shift in facial expression, showing a mastery of his art that is positively precocious at his age.  At this point the only problem Gyllenhaal has is that he is so good in this role that he risks being typecast.  The supporting cast is great as well:  John C. Reilly offers yet another dead-on portrayal of a cuckolded husband, Tim Blake Nelson is the perfect typical stoner with darker desires percolating in his subconscious, and Mike White has written himself into the film perfectly as the religious-zealot security guard.
This is not an easy film to watch.  Its themes are troubling, its ending does not neatly wrap up everyone's stories, and the characters we are supposed to root for sometimes make decisions that are extremely hard to justify.  But the film does a great job at getting behind the decisions people make that sometimes seem incomprehensible to others.  In short, this is a film you should see if you don't mind that it may not leave your thoughts for several days.  It manages to amuse at times, but ultimately leaves you with questions of ""Why did that happen?"" and ""What did that mean?"".  Kind of like life itself.",1045094400,7,2915,4.862348178137652

Is her character, Justine, a discarded wife? I'm not sure, her husband seems to have discarded himself too and I sure didn't see Justine valuing him too much either. Reviewers who are talking about ""her destiny lies in her own hands and not in the hands of those around her"" are pretty far off the mark in my opinion. This plot is a tangled web of interwoven interpersonal interactions, nicely done with a good number of unexpected twists and decisions by the characters that make sure you can't predict what will happen next.

1803927,4,B0000797IO,"Jennifer Aniston gives a near flawless performance in this bleak, depressing, and wonderful movie, a seductive tale of love and loneliness. Justine (Jennifer Aniston) has always been THE GOOD GIRL. Thirty years old and working in a Texas discount store, she is dissatisfied with her routine life and disgusted by her lazy, pot-smoking husband (John C. Reilly in another perfect performance). Her life is nearly at a standstill, until she suddenly notices Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal, wonderful once again) a few cash registers away. He is young and seemingly as lonely as she is, and together the two forge a passionate connection destined to shatter everything Justine stands for. As Justine struggles to cover up her affair, she unwantingly makes things much worse for herself.
The movie is a dark comedy about false dreams and lost illusions -- and, thanks to a fine cast and a smart script, it's an effective one, working on plenty of different levels. Director Miguel Arteta and writer-actor Mike White, the clever duo behind ""Chuck & Buck,"" make Justine an anti-heroine at the same time they make fun of her and her world. They make Wasteland, Texas, the quintessential town to escape -- except that in this film, the characters seemingly can't.
This is a fine movie, and the perfect role for Aniston. She has certainly opened a lot of eyes and garnered much deserved attention because of this film. The film was slow moving, sometimes excruciatingly, but the running time is fine, therefore it doesn't seem absolutely unbearable. The performances alone, especially that of Aniston, are worth checking out the film for. It's an unusual film, full of depressed, suicidal, and psychotic characters, and I think that's what I loved about it. This is far from conventional for Aniston and I can't imagine anyone else in the role. Not for all tastes, but definitely worth seeing.",1044316800,2,1876,5.035369774919614

1803929,1,B0000797IO,"When you hear the buzz about Jennifer Aniston's performance in ""The Good Girl"", you just expect that the vehicle will be worthwhile, as well. Both assumptions are a mistake.

 The ""buzz"" is about Jennifer playing against type; not only non-comedic, non-romantic, but also non-interesting. I've never been able to recognize why Jennifer would be any better or more deserving of an Emmy than the other two women ""Friends"", and this role does not change my mind about her. Hollywood wants to make her a star, an award-winner; it's not about the talent or the choices she makes, it's just about the golden image.

She's fine in ""The Good Girl"". Yup, you can believe that Justine is quietly desperate to end a dull marriage to a pothead and a dead-end job. What you can't believe is how she ever got herself in the position she's in, in the first place. Justine seems to accept all the lackluster characters around her, from her co-workers (""the Bible Study guy"", Gwen the optimist, and the strange young girl who takes Gwen's place and performs acts of cosmetic terror behind the makeup counter) to the man she married, (the capable John C. Reilly, who has exactly ""0"" chemistry with Miss Aniston) to his odd little pothead friend (Tim Blake Nelson as Bubba). No attempt to flesh out her character or attitude by understanding her childhood is made here.

It is believable that she would begin an affair with someone different, Tom, (he likes to call himself Holden), a young, troubled and aimless ex-alcoholic from town, who still lives with his mom and dad. Jake Gyllenhaal is the object of her affections, but frankly, there's no chemistry in this relationship, either.

What is impossible to understand is why she would choose such a moody young thing, and callously and quickly determine to end the relationship when she finally, finally recognizes what a child he is. Impossible to believe how she could dump her friend Gwen with a life threatening illness at the door of a hospital, and never go back. Or, how she could possibly make such a deal with the devil (Bubba) when he explains to her WHY he needs to sleep with her.

Why is it called ""The Good Girl""? There's nothing good about Justine, including Aniston's accent...really a waste of 90 minutes of your time.",1043884800,5,2270,4.778061224489796

Aniston's facial expressions and even her posture contribute to the overall picture of the never-ending sameness of her character's life.
""The Good Girl"" is a terrific character study. We see a young woman trapped in a life that she has fallen into....we just know that she married Phil out of sheer inertia many years ago and that nothing has changed since.
Justine is living a life of ""quiet desperation"" when she encounters Holden and they are drawn to each other.

I thought that Jennifer Aniston, playing a white trash gal trapped in her numbingly shabby small-town life, did a good job breaking away from her well-known role as Rachael, on TV's <i>Friends.</i> I also enjoyed her supporting cast as well, particularly John C. Reilly as her clueless but well-meaning stoner husband, and I got all wrapped up in knots as the plot got ickier and more uncomfortable.  But the resolution was skillful and nuanced only by Hollywood's standards, and the emotional coil-up dissipates almost instantaneously.  Even while the film gives a glimpse into middle America which is pretty close to the mark, it's also condescending and in many regards heartless.  I suppose that's the point: Aniston's is an antiheroic role, and the film gains points by creating a new set of easy answers that run counter to the same-old movie cliches, but which have the same general impact on its audience.

As her depressed lover, Jake Gyllenhaal is also good, making us root for him while at the same time asking, ""what is the matter with him?""

1803934,4,B0000797IO,"Jennifer Aniston does a surprisingly good job at portraying Justine, the fed-up Retail Rodeo employee who begins an elicit affair with Holden, a co-worker 8 years her junior.  I find it funny that one of the reviewers thought of this movie as a ""comedy"".  The dialogue is humorous at times, but I think this story has a lot more to it than meets the eye.
Justine sees her life as a prison, as does Holden. He swings open the door of curiosity in her life that makes her wonder if there's more for her in the world.  Yet, the ""good girl"" mentality she holds throughout the movie obligates her to deny her feelings for Holden and stick with her pot-smoking, impotent husband.
As you watch, you at first root for Holden and Justine.  You want them to escape their small town and find out what life holds for them.  Then you start feeling like that isn't right either; Holden is, after all, only 22...and a depressed, rather mentally disturbed 22 at that.  Justine sees in him a possibility, but still a bleak possibility.
This leads to a battle of motivations:  do you stick with the life you are familiar with and is socially acceptable, even if you're depressed out of your mind, or do you escape into a life more exciting that could very well be as bad or even worse?  This is what makes me not know what to think.  Justine obviously has personal issues she needs to work out, but she sees her answers in other people and not in herself.  This makes her a sympathetic character, but you hate her all at the same time.
The story is very well-conceived, and the actors do a marvelous job portraying Justine's equally-dysfunctional co-workers, family, and friends.

Aniston is obviously comfortable within the character's personality, as she is very believable and at times, drolly comical as the girl who can't get a break. Her days are a real drudge as she works the makeup counter at the local discount store in her small town. Not much happens in this town other than going shopping and going to church.
It's an escape from this humdrum life that Aniston's character, Justine, wants so badly. She's married but not very happily and the events that follow are nothing you'd find in her romantic comedies. Saying that the movie is a welcome departure from roles she's taken on in the past, showing her audience she's more than capable of handling dark comedy, as well as the happy-go-lucky stuff she's been doing on Friends all these years.
The other standout performance that provided huge comic relief is from Zooey Deschanel, who plays Justine's co-worker, Cheryl. Deschanel has some of the funniest moments in the film, all delivered with a deadpan style so fitting to her character's outlook on life.

1803962,3,B0000797IO,"The Story:  Justine, the protagonist of this film is fed-up with her life. She shows this with her drooping shoulders, drony voice, and the way she leans against her counter at the Retail Rodeo, head in hand.  Her eyes sweep over the place constantly and disgustedly, she sighs to herself.  In one of those sweeps she takes in the mysterious new employee, Holden, whom no one knows much about as he keeps himself to himself.  He always has his head in a book which, when prompted by curiosity to introduce herself, Justine discovers is ""The Catcher in the Rye"".  She also discovers that Holden is named for the hero of the book (and no his names not Catcher.)
Justine is drawn to Holden.  His quiet demeanor hides an inner struggle with his lot in life.  Although younger, Holden ""gets"" her.  She, entranced by his big soulful eyes and her desperation to make something beautiful to contrast her drab life, begins a romantic affair with this sensitive young man.  Theres only one problem, Justine is married.
Phil, her husband, a housepainter who spends most of his time smoking pot on the couch with his ever-present friend Bubba, is completely oblivious to his cuckold status.  In fact, he seems to think that everything is wonderful and that they are trying for a baby.  He believes that Justine is infertile, but is alarmed to discover that smoking doobies kills sperm.  He may be the infertile one.
Meanwhile, Justines relationship with Holden continues to blossom.  They eat lunch together everyday and make mooney eyes at one another from their respective corners of the Retail Rodeo.  They meet at an out of the way motel (under the disapproving eye of the desk clerk). It is after one of these trysts that Justine discovers the truck of Bubba, Phils ubiquitous friend, parked out front. Thats when everything starts to unravel for her--tragically.
My Thoughts:  Though laced with moments of humor, this movie is sad.  Jennifer Anniston, in the main role of Justine, is very good.  She is extremely believable as a world-weary and dissatisfied woman who needs a change so desperately that she enters into a serious relationship with a disturbed, immature young man (convincingly played by Jake Gyllenhaal.)  I could relate to her frustration with the empty sameness of day-to-day living.  Life in the small Texas town where she lives is predictable and stifling.
I liked the desperation of Justine and Holdens relationship.  I believed that two people in their situation would try to fan the flames of passion in order to infuse their lives with some sort of meaning. I also liked the depressed looking employees of Retail Rodeo especially the announcement/free makeover girl who insults customers subliminally.

1803997,3,B0000797IO,"After hearing the raves of Jennifer Aniston's performance in this movie, I was really looking forward to seeing it. She does a great job portraying Justine, a 30-something retail clerk who's unhappy with her life.
The problem is, Justine as a character is so completely selfish and unsympathetic that by the time the climax of the movie rolled around, and it was time for Justine to choose between going back to her old life or running away with her young lover, I realized I didn't much care which she chose.
I can understand and even somewhat relate to Justine; she sees no way out of her humdrum, unhappy life. But that, in my opinion, did not excuse her subsequent behavior: she dumps her ailing coworker, Gwen, at the hospital, says she's going to park the car, then drives off for her first rendezvous with Holden. She later uses the dying woman as her alibi for further romantic trysts. When Holden catches her sleeping with Bubba (to prevent him from telling her husband Phil about her affair with Holden) and, upset, call her a whore, she decides then that he's a child, and the only way for her to move forward ""on the road to redemption"" is to dump him...which she proceeds to try and do by buying him a tin of the blackberries she believed fatally poisoned Gwen. Justine then gets pregnant (by whom, we're never 100% sure) and convinces Phil it's his baby, despite the doctors just having told him he has a low sperm count. Holden, who robbed the store safe for money to run away with Justine, is turned into the police by her (to save her name from being associated with the robbery), with tragic results.
I suppose you could take the view that the title is meant to indicate irony: Justine is anything but a ""good girl.""

She has become rich and famous due to the long running TV series [while also becoming Mrs. Brad Pitt in real life], but from her penchant for taking roles in small, independent movies, it's clear that she has been searching for artistic recognition. ""The Good Girl"" gives it to her in spades.
This is the story of a woman who has been crushed by the inertia of her life. Justine [Aniston] lives in a small, nondescript town where she works at the Retail Rodeo, a smaller, kinder version of Wal-Mart. Her husband, Phil [John C. Reilly], and his ever present best friend, Bubba [Tim Blake Nelson], paint houses by day and smoke dope by night. These guys are likable enough but choose to be on the tour bus of life, traveling day after day to nowhere. Little wonder, then, that Justine becomes fascinated by Holden [Jake Gyllenhaal], a man ten years her junior who is obsessed by the novel, ""The Catcher in the Rye"". They begin a serio-comic love affair that leads to disaster but not to a stereotypical cinematic conclusion. You will be left thinking about Justine and hoping that her choice was the right one.

Be careful not to let Anniston's melancholy fool you into the thinking this is a drama.  She does a nice job here, but unless you're a ""Friends"" fanatic, that's not the real story.  ""The Good Girl"" is a creative comedy with good characters, such as John C. Reilly as Anniston's husband.  He is cornering the market on the well-meaning but dopey as s**t husband this year (""Chicago"" as well).  His turn in ""Good Girl"" is richer than in ""Chicago"", however, because his character isn't so one dimensional.  By the way, he got a Goden Globe nom. for ""Chicago,"" so if you want to see that part expanded upon, see ""Good Girl"" for added depth.  Jake Gyllenhall's (sp?) character is fun also.  He's a self-suffering, flatulent writer with deep, deep feelings, ie; testosterone.
There are no easy answers for Anniston's character in this movie, and there are no easy answers in real life.  The movie is unconventional and as a result, rewarding.
The end of the movie may have seemed sudden or unrewarding to others, but trust me.  Just trust me.  The ending of ""The Good Girl"" is as beautiful, uplifting, and heartbreaking as I have seen in a movie.  Period.",1042070400,,1306,4.641921397379913

Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

Its always a risk to try and give that breakthrough performance and show the world you can really act. In The Good Girl, Jennifer Aniston takes that risk and succeedsbig time. Both she and John C. Reilly were seriously gypped out of Oscar nominations that year.

Its a tale as old as modern times (because in the good ol days, women really were good girls and stayed at home, right?) but the performances make this movie stand out. Small town, impoverished couple Aniston and Reilly are trying to slog through their unhappy lives. Aniston is the title character and has never done anything bad before, but in walks a young, supposedly charming fellow to turn her head.

I saw this movie when I was a teenager, and when the end credits rolled, I couldn't stop crying. Its pretty heavy, and it features Aniston in her first onscreen sex scene, so hide those eyes, kiddies! But if you're the type of person who likes to watch depressing movies strictly for the actingI am, toothis movie will be right up your alley.",1497225600,,1067,4.575916230366492
