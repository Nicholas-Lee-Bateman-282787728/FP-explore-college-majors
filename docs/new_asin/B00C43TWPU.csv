Don't mind the subtitles, the acting is excellent, the scenery fabulous and the plotting is good.  Recommended for mystery fans.  Looking forward to more of these.",1379808000,18,263,5.341463414634147
5690441,3,B00C43TWPU,"People who are really, really interested in wine would probably enjoy this more than I did.  For me, there was nothing exceptional about this series, and that includes Season 2.  The stories seem overly slow, and too much time is spent on grape growing, disease identifying, wine tasting, etc.  On the technical side, the sound quality varied greatly, depending on location.  All in all, the series is not great but not bad.",1378425600,5,424,4.847222222222222
5690442,5,B00C43TWPU,"We have really enjoyed this series and hope there are more episodes to come. The scenery is beautiful and the story lines are
interesting and keep you guessing until the end.",1376611200,6,174,4.645161290322581

5690445,4,B00C43TWPU,"Delightful series, but an acquired taste. Although visually stunning, the first episode of Season 1 was a little hard to swallow.  The story starts off with likable characters and a fairly interesting premise but then gets muddy along the way and ends with a somewhat unconvincing finish.  Moving on to the second and later episodes, however, the stoylines start to flow much better, and the wine themes interwoven into the plots are clever and impressive.  Please note that anyone interested in this series will have be lovers of what I term ""The Miss Marple Effect.""  By this, I mean the effect Miss Marple had on people, whereby just about everybody would open up to her and freely share information and secrets.  Benjamin Lebel, our mystery-solving wine expert, seems to have a similar trait.

And, yes, the show will entice you to open your own bottle of wine.
So,  don't drink and drive, but do drink and watch BLOOD OF THE VINE!",1449964800,,935,4.770186335403727

5690447,5,B00C43TWPU,"Excellent acting, excellent plots (a little 'hokey' in some cases, but I guess it's hard to do amatuer crime solving with a wine/winery theme all the time) and beautiful scenery/locales. What's not too like! I didn't even mind the english sub-titles. Sign me up for Season 2 - or a trip to Southern France wine country.",1443139200,,319,4.714285714285714

5690455,3,B00C43TWPU,"Great to visit France, the show is a little corny and not as sophisticated at the books were. A lot of plots and characters have been changed in this adaptation, so if you read the books, it's pleasant to find that the TV shows are original in terms of plots and character development. Some things are the same but a lot is changed. On the whole, quite enjoyable.

I was a bit dismayed to find that I was not permitted to sell my once viewed DVDs on Amazon due to restrictions so be forewarned - you will have to list this one on eBay. In addition, the shows are available on Amazon's streaming service, which I had not known.",1435708800,,626,4.260504201680672

Buy it anyway, and the other series: both great.",1406851200,,194,4.416666666666667
5690475,5,B00C43TWPU,"A unique series with the premise of using a wine expert to decipher evidence from grape beverages.  Beverages, because each episode features a different wine, and even the wine-based cognac.  Each episode also features a different wine region, so along with the wine, you get beautiful scenes of the countryside of France.  The acting is excellent, and the characters have wonderful complexity.  Get both seasons.  The characters develop over time.",1403395200,2,448,5.3428571428571425
5690476,4,B00C43TWPU,I enjoy learning all the wine lore and seeing the beautiful French scenery.  Pierre Arditi still sexy and riveting mysteries.,1403222400,,125,5.25
5690477,5,B00C43TWPU,"Who'd have thought that a series of shows that takes place around a wine expert could be used as a backdrop of murder, mystery and intrigue? Blood of the Vine does just that however and pulls it off very well.

This series is a French one, so everyone is speaking French! (Big surprise there!) There are English subtitles however and one gets used to reading them after awhile.

Pierre Arditi is a joy to watch, he's just so laid back and cool and appears so natural that he totally embodies his character.

There is a season two, so I hope they keep making these shows, despite the Pierre Arditi internet death hoax, he's still around to continue playing in this excellent series.",1394928000,2,681,4.565573770491803
5690478,5,B00C43TWPU,"This is an impressive and enjoyable series. The filming is flawless. The cd's are top quality HD. Storylines are creative and not gloomy, leaning toward lighthearted. (not that murder is lighthearted, but if you watch Midsomer Murders you will understand.)

Some of the scenery associated with the story content takes place in vineyards and chateaus in France. You may learn a bit about wine along the way!
Having purchased, watched and totally enjoyed Seasons 1 and 2, I can only hope there will be a season 3 and 4 and....",1392768000,8,524,4.822222222222222

5690480,5,B00C43TWPU,"This is a beautiful series.  The actors are wonderful, the scenery divine and the mysteries intriguing. If you like Midsomer Murders you will like Blood of the Vine.  I wish there were more episodes.  I have season 2 as well.  I will be watching them over and over again waiting for season 3.",1387756800,4,292,4.452830188679245

5690482,5,B00C43TWPU,"I have both seasons of this series and I love it.  The plots, the characters, the scenery, information about wine production- all of these elements make it a fantastic series.  You will fall in love with the character , Benjamin Lebel .  I was sad that there was only 2 seasons.  This is a series that I will watch over and over.",1383609600,3,329,4.258064516129032

8577226,5,B00C43TWPU,"Blood of the Vine is an engaging French mystery series that centers around a wine expert who becomes involved in wine related crimes.  Unlike many French films, if you have an intermediate knowledge of the language you can follow the dialogue, if not, the subtitles work fine. There isn't a lot of action but the plots are interesting, the characters engaging and the scenes of  Bordeaux are enchanting. If you don't know much about wine, you will by the end of the series.",1503878400,,473,4.686746987951807
