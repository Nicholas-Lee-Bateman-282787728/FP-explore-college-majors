It is an honest, and clear, presentation of swordsmanship for a beginner to learn, or for an advanced user to be reminded of the basics--upon which everything depends.",1467504000,,286,5.1063829787234045
8043362,1,B0006U6KJ4,"Hopefully, those of you looking to buy this DVD haven't purchased the first one and are just looking around. If that's the case then I'm glad for you, because I just save you $40. George Alexander has no affiliation whatsoever with Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu (the actual fighting style of Miyamoto Musashi). Alexander's credentials stat he has a Phd, which clearly seems to be in marketing. He may be selling you ""Eight Deadly Samurai Sword Cuts,"" but none of which belong to Miyamoto Musashi.",1171584000,2,487,4.809523809523809
8043363,5,B0006U6KJ4,Anyone interested in Samurai swordsmanship needs these dvds. I highly recommend all three!! Really awesome!!,1170892800,,108,6.266666666666667
