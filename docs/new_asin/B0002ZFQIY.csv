2152236,3,B0002ZFQIY,"""The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald: The Legend of Grimace Island is, simply put, one of the trippiest things I've ever seen. Made by the McDonald's Corporation for kids, it's 40 minutes of lots of Grimaces, pirates, deception, and some of the most insufferable musical numbers (from an adult's perspective) you will ever sit through. I screened this for a young child, and other than the blatant commercialism (but what kid doesn't already love McDonald's?) it's fast-moving entertainment that's well-suited for little minds. I was trying to think how best to describe this adventure, and the best I could come up was to try imagining a combination of equal parts ""Pee-wee's Playhouse"" and ""The Perfect Storm,"" add dashes of ""Moby Dick,"" ""The Enemy Below,"" and the ""Teletubbies,"" stir well, and that will get you close enough to conceptualize a rough outline of this oddball production.

Kids may be confused by the weird mix of animation and live action footage, while adults may be confused by the mysterious potato bird creatures that I finally deduced were supposed to be McNuggets (I think...right?) After a treacherous ocean crossing to Grimace Island and temporarily angering The High Grimaceness (who wears an interesting feather-laden headdress,) Grimace Island turns into one big dancing, singing party while the pirates are dispatched by tickling (obviously,) after a fishocalypse is inadvertently triggered. Grimace's bravery provides the concluding theme, which is probably reasonable given all the associated weirdness it took to get to that point.

Obviously this is a cartoon for kids, and young kids will love it despite it having nil educational value to speak of. While it's largely nonsensical, it is colorful and attention getting: just be forewarned that you may have a difficult time forgetting the musical interludes this feature packs no matter how much you may want to.",1399766400,,1901,5.270627062706271

2152244,5,B0002ZFQIY,"This VHS came out just in time for my birthday (which is in October).

My mom bought this movie for me to watch on my birthday (years ago, when it came out). All my friends from school and the neighbrhood watched it while having yummy food and birthday cake. We ALL Loved it! I was a kid (I'm in my 20s now) and I truly enjoyed this movie. It's fun, silly, and had some really catchy songs.

I watched it many more times over the years. It's PERFECT for Halloween :)

Enjoy!",1250467200,3,474,4.130434782608695
2152245,5,B0002ZFQIY,"When a colleague recommended these videos for my second graders, I was skeptical that it would hold their attention.  I was surprised to find that the children were very engaged with the video, often singing along with the songs.  The videos are around 40-45 minutes and each teaches a moral lesson.  I would say that young children up to age 9 or so would enjoy this video.",1235088000,,374,4.552238805970149

8035218,5,B0002ZFQIY,"The kids usually like these videos. I borrowed a couple and took them to school. They loved it, watching over again with the same delight. This one was a gift, actually. They loved it over there.--If you listen, you will hear a familiar 'witchy-poo' voice. If you watch, you will see a familiar, colorful similarity to H.R. Pufnstuf. No, really. I thought so, first. Then I checked it out to be true. There's an interesting outside story that goes along with these great adventures.",1409356800,,482,4.75
