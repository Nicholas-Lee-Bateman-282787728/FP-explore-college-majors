8330355,4,B001OCB0PM,"We were pleased to find this in order to supplement a history unit on the Mughal Empire our 3rd grade son was studying. He had learned about Babur, Akbar the Great, and Shah Jahan. This animation helped bring a new dimension to his understanding of the culture, religious tolerance, and ruling empire of the time. Nonetheless, this was a production we chose to borrow from the library / mail order dvd rental rather than purchase b/c it was needed only for a unit of study. This is not a dvd we desire to own.",1235088000,,509,4.425531914893617
