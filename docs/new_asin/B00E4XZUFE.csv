8601287,1,B00E4XZUFE,"It makes sense to be prepared for natural disasters like tornadoes, heavy storms, earthquakes and major fires. Perhaps the power will be out for a while, water supplies will be contaminated, and your local supermarket will be sold out of practically everything. Or maybe you'll need to evac in a hurry because a major fire is about to destroy your home. So some degree of preparation is sensible for most people.

Preppers, on the other hand, envisage the end of the world as we know it. Although the means by which such an end arrives are usually unclear or hopelessly unrealistic, they are convinced that the end is nigh and only a major stash of weapons and food will enable them to survive the apocalypse. On the other hand, they are incapable of actually thinking the whole thing through. So in this series we see a bunch of under-educated folk who are mostly seriously overweight and physically inadequate deluding themselves into believing that they can be ""prepared."" The four marines around whom the series is based attempt to help these folk with advice, but the reality is that such people can't really be helped at all because they are delusional. They are the equivalent of a four-year-old with a cardboard sword imagining that he can slay real-world dragons.

It takes a huge amount of commitment and effort to remain in adequate physical condition (e.g. for men, at a minimum: being able to run 5 miles in under 37 minutes, being able to perform at least 30 straight-arm pull-ups in under 2 minutes, being able to tab over rough terrain with a 55 pound pack for 30 miles; putting at least 1,000 rounds  against moving targets in realistic conditions on a weekly basis, being competent at dealing with blunt trauma injuries, and basically being able to keep going when everything goes pear-shaped). None of the ""preppers"" featured in this series seem to have the vaguest idea that physical conditioning is the very first step in ""being prepared.""

The majority of ""preppers"" featured in this series seem to imagine that any disaster will conveniently strike when they are at home surrounded by their kit. Should disaster be so inconsiderate as to hit when they're away (at work, shopping, at the movies, visiting friends...) few would be capable of getting home. I knew a guy years ago who was convinced that his ""disaster plan"" was foolproof: walk 17 miles across country to reach his bug-out location. He died of a heart attack when his car ran out of petrol and he tried to walk quarter of a mile along level paved road to the nearest gasoline station. Like the ""survivalists"" featured in this series, it never occurred to him that he was so badly out of shape that he was utterly unfit to survive a minor inconvenience never mind a real disaster. The lesson: you can't waddle your way through a crisis.

Additionally, few of the featured ""survivalists"" seem to have any clue that they rely on modern aids for medium-term survival. How many could perform an appendectomy or remove a decaying tooth? How many are dependent on blood-pressure medication and other aids because they are so badly out of shape? Apparently all these very basic issues are totally invisible to most ""preppers"" as they fantasize about surviving TEOTWAWKI in their homes surrounded by dried food and ammunition.

It would be funny if it wasn't so tragic.

If you want some insight into this disturbing sub-culture these episodes are valuable. But if you think you're going to learn how to survive a disaster, that's another story entirely.",1420675200,,3530,4.8344370860927155

8601289,2,B00E4XZUFE,"From the description I was thinking this would be a video put together by ""experts"" with tips and advice, and not the typical ""Doomsday Prepper"" fare.  What this turned out to be was a lot like DP, only focusing on one group of experts coaching several preppers on how to accomplish a single goal that varied for each group.  They really skipped over the details that would have made this more useful and informative, and instead presented what amounted to a television show with virtually no ""show"" to it.

The show started out interestinginly enough, with the ""experts"" going to advise a prepper family on how to set up a defense for their home and property.  As a former Air Base Defense Officer for the Air Force, I had to agree that their initial assesment was dead on - no way to mount a defense of the whole place under the restrictions that where present.  They even worked out a ""plus and minus"" chart.  But, not too long after that, the show lost its uniqueness and started to be shot like DP - the discussion of the homeowner's options and plans took place not in the main house area like all the previous interactions, but in a storeroom, with the area behind the subjects looking like they were filled with ""preps"", including, I kid you not, what appeared to be bars of silver sitting openly on a shelf behind the homeowner's head, and appearing nearly center frame so the viewer could not miss it.  After that, I think the show started sliding downhill.  By the time the last segment was presented - a very short and almost useless overview of weapons recommended for preppers - I was almost glad to see the credits.  Of course the producers had to include the ""experts"" shooting watermelons and cans of food, which seems to be an obligatory part of every ""prepper"" show now from Nat Geo.

I keep putting the word ""experts"" in quotes for a reason.  While I won't question the qualifications of the individuals that the show is centered on, the advice and actions, as presented in the show, are not the insights and expertise that a professional could bring to the situations presented.  They are inputs that anyone could get off of Google and Youtube, without spending a lot of time searching.  I know this program was edited heavily, but the editors really did a disservice to the people who were presented as  the ""experts"".

Unless you're totally new to the concept of ""prepping"", this is really a waste of money, in my opinion.  There was little advice, and even less of ""how to"".  Instead, I would classify it as ""Doomsday Preppers Lite"", minus the occasional good idea or entertainment value.

I rated it two stars instead of one because someone may find this informative - it wasn't a total disaster, and the rating is based on my personal opinion, not poor quality or bad/misleading information.  I did not know that this had been a Nat Geo series that was cancelled, and not a special.

If you are brand new to the concept of prepping, I guess it could prove useful.  If not, I wouldn't spend the money (again) on it.  Honestly, I wish I could return it and get something else.",1403222400,,3100,4.577898550724638
8601290,5,B00E4XZUFE,"Zombies? It's just silly.  Luckily, this series has no zombies or people who believe zombies are real!

But, there are real world situations that do happen.  Where shows like Doomsday Preppers seek to find many of the most silly, hide-in-your hole preppers out there, Apocalypse 101 actually tries to give real world insight into how to deal with desperate and realistic situations.  Situations that might lead to you having to defend yourself or your family.  Situations that might require that you band together with others.  Situations where food and water are just much more important than guns and ammo.  They teach improvisation and combat mindset far more than gear storage.

Total collapse of the world economy?  Pretty unlikely.  Better than zombies, but really, think about some recent real world situations:  Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Sandy, World Trade Center.  In other countries, events like those in Syria or Mexico.  Those are realistic situations even if they seem far fetched in the U.S. today, they are not impossible.

So, if you want to survive a bad situation, watch this; not some crazy show about burying yourself in a tomb when the zombies arrive.

Apocalypse 101 + Surviving Disaster are both excellent.  Too bad both seem to have only one season...",1377388800,4,1278,5.101449275362318
