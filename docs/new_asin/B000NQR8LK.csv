8180969,5,B000NQR8LK,"Shaoran's crew has arrived in a world where a kingdom is ruled by a tyrannical magic user. The citizens are oppressed and live day to day. Our heroes meet a young girl whose mother was killed by the king. She can also use magic, and has been causing trouble for the ruling body. Together with her and the other citizens of the kingdom, Shaoran's crew starts a revolution. Overthrowing the king might just get them one of Sakura's feathers.",1355097600,,439,4.569620253164557
8180970,5,B000NQR8LK,"Here we have the conclusion of the first world they were in, retrieving Sakura's feather from the kudan that absorbed it (you won't believe who's it was!). So of course, they go and jump to the next world. This has got to be one of my favorite set of episodes. This world, they land in a village where the town is being oppressed and controlled by an evil lord named Tombal and his son. Tombal has a power called hijutsu, and guess what's amplifying it? That's right, Sakura's feather! This set of episodes has alot more action, and emotion, then the other set of episodes. It's just totally breath-taking. Will they be able to storm the fortress and get Sakura's feather back? Well, you'll just have to watch and find out!",1253059200,,723,4.526717557251908
8180971,5,B000NQR8LK,"As our heroes embark upon a new world with new adventures.  The action is pretty much on display throughout this volume that contains 5 episodes.  They are on the verge of finding another feather to help Sakura with regaining her memories.  But run across an evil wizard, his son and a sorceress being controlled by the wizard.  He's using the feather to keep the townspeople in check terrorizing them on a daily basis and the last time they rebelled against him.  He captured a bunch of them and they haven't been seen since.  It concludes in episode 10 with Syaoran face to face with the evil wizard who holds Sakura and another prisoner as bargaining chips.

Great continuation and the story keeps building for our heroes.  A worthy buy especially if you've already bought the first volume as this one doesn't disappoint either.",1207612800,,831,4.7622377622377625
8180972,3,B000NQR8LK,"i was waiting for this series for a while now and when it finally arrived and i watched it, i was a little disappointed. First of all, and don't like the actress who plays as sakura, her voice doesn't go well with the character and syaoran and sakura don't show much emotions,to top it off the show drags, they've gotten 3 or 4 feathers in 26 episodes?! The only reason i'm going to finish watching the anime is because i've already started watching it.",1200182400,,453,4.404761904761905
8180973,5,B000NQR8LK,The continuation of the first disc. Here they go to a different country where they battle new enemies and make new friends. It's a must if you bought the first volume.,1188432000,2,167,4.419354838709677
