7877418,5,6304794452,"I was a long time resident of the Alton, Illinois area before moving to Virginia. I was living in the area right before they started building the new Clark bridge. The area is rich in history including the explorations by Lewis and Clark. For many years I crossed the Missisippi river on a two lane narrow steel girder bridge or on a Ferry further up river. From time to time you would hear about a bad accident on the old Clark bridge since it was very narrow. For many Illinois residents it was necessary to cross the bridge to go to jobs in the St. Louis, Missouri area. My mom and uncle crossed it everyday to work at McDonnell Douglas. Quite honestly I'm amazed there weren't more accidents. Any time there was an accident it tied up the bridge for hours since a tow truck would have to be called and then for them to get out onto the bridge and get the car off was a nightmare.

When I returned to the area after the super bridge was built I couldn't believe how easy it was to cross and how much it changed the face of the town. It was like it got a facelift and was welcoming new ideas and new business. The old downtown had changed substancially with new businesses and a nice park. The movie is very well made and gives a good look at not only how a suspension bridge is built, but the impact it has on the people and the community. I highly recommend it. This is the type of documentary that will interest most family members. NOVA did an exceptional job of making this more than just a story about the technical fetes accomplished. I wish this would come out on DVD, since I'm sure in time my VHS will wear out.",1173830400,,1623,4.235483870967742

This is a powerful documentary on many levels. I would never have guessed that a show on building a bridge in middle America could be so riveting. One of the reasons is that the film-maker adds the human element in to the mix--a aspect often overlooked in similar documentaries. You begin to care about the well-being of both those that are building the bridge and the people that need it so desperately. On a deeper level, Super Bridge turns the subject of erecting a bridge into the stuff of myth. There are powerful underlying psychological, sociological, and religious themes in the film. The show embodies the themes of human struggle and triumph and especially the inevitable cycle of death, rebirth... and death. Any talented film-maker can chronicle an engineering feat, but it takes a true artist to turn  the subject into a narrative of the human condition.
As Super Bridge pointed out, the triumph of the completed bridge must be tinged with sadness-it will eventually decay and turn to rubble, even as the proceeding bridge did. The pride of human accomplishment is certainly merited-the bridge is a masterpiece of form and function. However, as with any human endeavor, hubris is not allowed.
I've seen the show twice and I'm going to get the tape of this film to show to friends. Though I don't remember it, I went over the old bridge more then once as a child. I hope to return to the new one as an adult.",1086998400,2,1550,4.698529411764706

It moves from the conceptualization to the completion of a huge and formerly impossible task.  The sheer variety of skills, guts, teamwork, planning, ...the foresight of it all was an amazing testimony to human ability to overcome giant obstacles.  I will watch it again and again",999993600,4,434,4.876712328767123
