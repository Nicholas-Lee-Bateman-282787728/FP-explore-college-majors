8642527,1,B00IJE1BSY,"This is the worst film either of these two major stars made.  The script is awful, the kid actors are obnoxious, and there is a cheapness about the entire production that suggests the driving hand of Harry Cohn, the tyrannical head of Columbia studios.  There is not an amusing or believable moment in the film. So why would Amazon charge so much for a long-forgotten turkey?  Caveat emptor.",1483920000,,391,4.720588235294118
