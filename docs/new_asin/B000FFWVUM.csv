8121983,2,B000FFWVUM,"I like Tal Farlow, and Jody's a good instructor. He'll ask a question, which Tal will respond to using definitions that make sense to him and Jody, but left me scratching my head. And there is no book included so you can follow along. Occasionally Tal will show you a chord, but his giant hands hide that chord, a book would have really helped. And it could have added a few definitions. Was Tal talking about quartal harmony, he was saying something about 4ths? Based on that criticism I can't recommend this.",1189209600,4,510,4.554347826086956
