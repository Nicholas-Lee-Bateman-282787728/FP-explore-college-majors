8077298,5,B000AARKGC,"I owned UNO, and I did not purchased it, through Amazon I found this disc at a local record store about eight years ago. I look at the cover and read the back of the disc to get somewhat of a idea, and The movie La haine, Dark and Life & Lyrics came too mind. My intuition was right! I've watch this movie at list a thousand times and some. Not everybody like to read subtitles in movies, sometimes I don't put the subtitles in, and I don't speak Norwegian. That how good this film is, Oh and the sound track is excellent to. Now the year is 2013 and there many more to explore, like this British flick call( Shifty). UNO is grade A Classic in my book.",1372896000,,652,4.062015503875969

8077301,4,B000AARKGC,"I have to admit, I bought the Uno DVD not because I was expecting an amazing movie or even because I careed about the film itself.  Rather, I bought the DVD because Ulver contributed some music to the soundtrack.  As expected, Ulver's music didn't disappoint.  Aside from Ulver, the soundtrack featured some tracks by another musician, Tom McRae I believe.  His stuff sounded pretty good too.

As far as the movie goes, it was pretty solid.  I'm not a big movie buff so I don't have much intelligent to say about the movie itself other than that I enjoyed it, especially the ending.",1155859200,,582,4.601941747572815
