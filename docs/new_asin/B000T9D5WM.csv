2895091,4,B000T9D5WM,"After her brother dies having not made the decisive kick in a soccer game against their school's arch rival, Gracie determines to join the boy's team and win one for her brother.  She has to prove herself with literally everyone from her parents, the coach and other players, to the school board.

""Gracie"" is not just good general family fare, it's a film for every young girl in athletics to see just how far womens sports have come.",1193356800,4,435,4.564102564102564
2895092,4,B000T9D5WM,"One of my favorite sports movies is ""Bend It Like Beckham"".  I was attracted to this movie because it is supposed to be similar to ""Bend It Like Beckham"".  This movie is a lot more realistic and has more believable characters. Carly Schroeder does a great job of portraying Gracie, the 15 year old girl who displays a fierce determination of making the boys varsity soccer team (Columbia team) and of replacing her beloved older brother Johnny in winning a game against the arch-rival Kingston team.

This movie is inspired and based on the real-life events of the Shue family (Elizabeth Shue and her older brother Andrew Shue, both of whom grew up loving soccer).  Andrew Shue is the real-life ""Johnny"" who always looked after kid-sister ""Elizabeth"".  Director Davis Guggenheim is Elizabeth Shue's husband.  So this movie is put together by the Shue family and it deals with a family that struggles to hold on after the tragic loss of their son, Johnny, who was a great soccer player for the boys varsity team.  The Shue family did a great job of putting together this movie about families.

Other reviewers have done a great job of summarizing the story so I won't repeat that.  As noted by other reviewers, this is a very familiar sports movie that has been done to death.  The girl makes the boys' team, the team plays in a big championship, and guess who carries the day?  You've seen it before a number of times (Bend It Like Beckham, Remember the Titans, Hoosiers, etc.)  What I wanted to comment on is the rich character development and the focus on relationships.

1) This movie is centered upon the relationship between Gracie and her dad (played by Dermot Mulroney).  Gracie struggles so much to gain the attention and affection of her dad, and is hurt so deeply when she senses that her father doesn't trust in her ability to make the boys' team.  Gracie acts out in rebellious ways and starts to fail in her classes, until her dad comes to the rescue and shows her genuine love and attention.  He finally agrees to train her for making the team.  Dermot Mulroney (who actually plays soccer) does a great job of conveying gruffness with tender care and affection.  As Gracie's dad, he doesn't want her to get hurt both physically and emotionally.  He is trying his best to protect his only daughter.

I thought the relationship and bond between daughter and father was the most touching element in this movie.  Also touching was the tender affection between the older brother Johnny and Gracie.  Johnny is the only guys who totally believes in Gracie and encourages her to pursue her dreams and develop her abilities.

2) The film also portrays Gracie's need to prove herself in a family that respects boys rather than girls.  At the dinner table, she has to endure constant verbal jabs that belittle the feminine race.  Girls are not supposed to pursue their dreams but guys can.  Girls can't do this but guys can.  Gracie resents that and wants to do what no other girl is able to do.  Carly does a great job of portraying Gracie as a girl who is vulnerable yet displays great inner strength, perseverance, and determination.  We see both aspects of her personality.

3) Gracie's need to prove herself and make it in the boys' team is her way of dealing with her grief over the loss of her beloved brother.  She believes that the way to pay her respects to her brother is by making the team and achieving the victory that her brother was not able to achieve before his departure.

4) As Gracie trains with her dad (who finally agrees to train with her) and she works out in the gym before class, in the try-outs, and late at night, she gains the respect of her dad, the soccer coach, and even the skeptical guys on the soccer team.  It was great to see this development.  Carly Schroeder had to train hard to tone her soccer skills, and she is totally believable in the role.

There are a couple of interesting commentaries (a feature commentary by David Guggenheim, and one with Elizabeth & Andrew Shue).  There is also a making of the film documentary, which interviews the cast and directors.

I was very pleased with this movie.  ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a funny movie about an Indian girl who wants to be a soccer star, against the wishes of her family.  ""Gracie"" is a much more believable and realistic movie of a girl who is determined to pursue her dreams and go where no female teen has gone before, in the world of soccer.

I also really liked the soundtrack which features hit songs in 1978, from groups such as Boston (""Don't Look Back""), Sweet (""Fox on the Run""), Roberta Flack (""The Closer I Get to You""), etc.

Incidentally, in 1978, Mia Hamm (the women's champion soccer player) was only 8 years old at the time.  Look where she is now.",1191974400,4,4767,4.5928994082840235
2895093,4,B000T9D5WM,"It might not be clear until the end credits (or even until you check out the DVD extras), but ""Gracie"" is a Shue Family project.  That would be the Shues as in Elizabeth Shue (who in my mind's eye is always the hot chick sitting on the hood of a car in the credits for ""Call to Glory,"" even with the Oscar nomination for ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leaving-Las-Vegas/dp/0792838068/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leaving Las Vegas</a>,"" although my kids all know her from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adventures-in-Babysitting/dp/6305428050/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adventures in Babysitting</a>""), her brother Andrew Shue, who is also an actor, and her husband Davis Guggenheim (Oscar winner as the director of Al Gore's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-Inconvenient-Truth/dp/B000ICL3KG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An Inconvenient Truth</a>"").  The last two, along with Ken Himmelman, came up with this soccer story, and the Shue siblings both plays roles in ""Gracie,"" as the mother and the assistant coach respectively.  One of the characters is based on their brother, William, who died in his twenties, but the story is by no means autobiographical in any meaningful sense of the word.  Instead it is inspired by the love of the Shue family for the game of soccer.

That being said and adding that Dermot Mulroney plays the family, it is Carly Schroeder as the title character who makes this movie worth watching.  Gracie Bowen is the only daughter in a family where the dad loves soccer and his idea of parenting is to coach his boys to be great soccer players.  Her older brother Johnny (Jesse Lee Soffer) is a high school soccer star, but who always has time for his adoring sister.  After the big game, Johnny is killed in a car accident that devastates Grace and her family.  When she stops crying, Grace comes out of her bedroom and announces that she is going to play varsity soccer at the high school and help them win the big game next year.  Her other brothers laugh at the idea and her father immediately teaches Grace a harsh lesson about how impossible this particular dream happens to be.  Denied her dream and having essentially lost her father as well as her brother because of the accident, Grace starts to put herself at risk.

""Gracie"" is supposed to be an inspirational movie, with Grace's efforts to play soccer being put in the context of Title IX and the revolutionary effect it had on women's sports in general and women's soccer in particular (which makes it ironic that the American team just lost in the semi-finals of the World Championship this week).  But Grace is not trying to prove a point about women playing sports; she is trying to heal after a devastating loss.  She does not care that her father disapproves, that the guys on the team do not want her, and that she will be considered a dyke for wanting to play.  In her grief she decides this is what she needs to do to be whole again, and she does what it takes to do it.  As Gracie, Schroeder pulls this off by playing it straight down the middle, by which I mean that she is neither an actual tomboy nor a potential prom queen.  She is a very determined young girl, who is going to cry when she gets decked until she finally reaches the point where there are no tears left.

If we use the original ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky/dp/B000ICM5VM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky</a>"" as a reference point for films having to do with athletic training, then what you see in ""Gracie"" reminds me more of the first time Rocky gets up to run in the morning, when the point is how brutally hard it is to do this kind of thing.  I find it key that throughout the training sequences composer Mark Isham (who also did the score for ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invincible/dp/B000J3OTT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invincible</a>""), never goes for the uplifting theme music ala Bill Conti.  What Gracie is trying to do requires hard work and that is communicated.  It is also emotionally draining, which Schroeder communicates wonderfully when we get to the climactic big game.  I love her reactions to the multiple big moments that happen during the finale, and the way that the big game is both choreographed and shot.  It might seem paradoxical to say this 2007 film is moving without being inspirational, but that simply reflects the fact that I see ""Gracie"" as being about the struggle of a young girl to make herself whole again and not as striking a blow for sports equity.",1191024000,7,4671,5.2319034852546915
2895094,4,B000T9D5WM,"Synopsis: After the tragic death of her older brother fifteen-year old Gracie (Carly Schroeder) decides she wants to make the boys high school soccer team as he had. With the town, the team and even her own family against the idea of a girl playing on a boys team she finally convinces them all of her passion and fire to compete and gets her chance to show everyone what she's capable of.

Critique: The '07 release 'Gracie' is one of those feel good sports movies about an underdog triumphing over seemingly insurmountable odds to win the day on and off the field of play. Reminiscent of a Disney or Hallmark production the film follows a tried and proven formula that we've all seen many times. However it's quite well done, Carly Schroeder delivers an engaging performance and the contemporary soundtrack is infectious. All and all 'Gracie' is a film that will provide positive and enjoyable family entertainment for one and all.

My Rating: -4 Stars-.",1190419200,16,956,4.787878787878788
2895095,3,B000T9D5WM,"""Gracie"" is a young woman who battles social conventions to achieve her dream of playing varsity soccer. Actress Elizabeth Shue and her brother Andrew were inspired by their own competitive, soccer-obsessed family to co-write and produce the film. Elizabeth Shue's husband Davis Guggenheim directs. Many details of family life were taken from or inspired by the Shue family. They put a lot of themselves into this film, which is dedicated to their brother Will Shue. But the storyline itself is fictitious and, I suppose, meant to comment on the personal power of sports and  the foolishness of letting others define your limitations.

It's 1978 in South Orange, New Jersey, and the Bowen family is preoccupied with soccer, as always. Bryan Bowen (Dermot Mulroney) was a star player in his youth and has infected his entire family with enthusiasm for the sport. After a family tragedy, teenaged daughter Gracie (Carly Schroeder) pours her grief into training and is determined to play on her high school's varsity soccer team next year, which is a men's team. Discouraged by her father's indifference and the ridicule of other players, Gracie finds more rebellious outlets for her feelings. -Until her parents encourage her to petition the school board for the opportunity to try out for the team.

""Gracie"" is pleasant enough, even though I've seen this story countless times before. But the father-daughter relationship and Gracie's arc feel contrived. The coach's actions and the macho father's casual presumption that his wife will support the family are just not credible. Gracie's dialogue is smarter than she actually seems to be and therefore unnatural. I like ""Gracie"" more as a 1970s nostalgia film than as a sports movie or a feminist film. The material from the Shues' life is authentic and interesting enough, but this script is lousy. ""Gracie"" is mildly entertaining but neither the plot nor characters hold up to scrutiny.

The DVD (New Line 2007): Widescreen and full screen versions are on the same disc. Bonus features are a theatrical trailer, 2 audio commentaries, and a featurette called ""Bringing Gracie to Film"" (27 min). This interviews Andrew and Elizabeth Shue, Davis Guggenheim, the cast, and others about developing the story from the Shues' family life, casting, working with family, and filming soccer. The 1st audio commentary is by director Davis Guggenheim, who talks about the details taken from his wife's family, locations, themes, the characters' experiences, his decisions and intentions. The 2nd audio commentary is by Andrew and Elizabeth Shue, who compare their experiences and traditions with those represented in the film, and talk about characters, real locations, and shooting the film.",1190332800,13,2731,5.242562929061785
2895096,5,B000T9D5WM,"I know what you are probably thinking. You're thinking something like, ""Oh, Great! Just what we don't need. Another underdog sports movie!"" Well, before dismissing this film as such, you might want to watch it really carefully and take some time out to think about a few things. The heart that Gracie displays in this film is something that every youth needs to see, and exhibit, today, especially in light of how ""lazy"" today's youth seem to be. Especially with how they seem to expect to have everything handed to them on a silver platter. Well, I'm sorry to report on the reality, but victory does not come this way. It only comes with determination and perseverence, which Gracie demonstrated to the maximum degree. This film also made me realize that both women and minorities have absolutely NOTHING to complain about in today's world. What Gracie faced in 1978 was REAL sexism and descrimination. Hey, I'm a guy and I thought it completely unfair the way she was treated and I was rooting for her all the way!

This film also reminded me of ""Invincible"", about the true story of Vince Papale who, although being up in years, got a chance to play for the Philadelphia Eagles. After viewing both ""Gracie"" and ""Invincible"", I'm left to thinking that there is not a coach or recruiter alive today that would not give their arm and leg for players like Gracie Bowen and Vince Papale--players who have HEART and really LOVE the game they play, and are not just a couple of posers who are just in it for the money and fame.

Bottom line is, I highly recommend this film. The acting is convincing and the story is very inspiring. Well worth at least one viewing",1186963200,14,1660,4.623728813559322
2895097,5,B000T9D5WM,"The fact that this quiet yet beautiful gem of a film was released on the same weekend as the summer blockbuster ""Knocked Up"" may give some indication as to why it came and went relatively quickly in the theaters. Still, if you saw the previews for this and/or went to see it when it came out, chances are you agree that it was an impressively well-told story of courage, redemption, and the realization that life simply is never perfect, regardless of how much effort is put forth.

Contemporary sport films have become a distinctive genre that is all their own, and simply seeing the poster for this film may instantly suggest something about defying the odds, standing up against adversity, and meeting with huge successes that are the result of hard work. Isn't that, after all, the general formula of many of the inspirational sports movies that are out there?

However, while ""Gracie"" emphasizes all those things and efficiently plays out those typical messages, there is something much stronger that makes this film worth your time. It is loosely based on true-life events of actress Elisabeth Shue, who made a name for herself with the 1980's hit ""Misadventures in Babysitting."" Beyond her acting career, though, there is a story of her childhood that is carried through the character of Gracie Bowens, a teenager who is growing up with a slew of soccer-playing brothers. You can sense immediately that she is struggling with feelings of inadequacy as she fights to be part of the family athleticism, but when a jarring tragedy strikes with her oldest brother, so begins her journey toward making a difference and taking his spot on the varsity soccer team. Gracie knows she cannot take this on without her father's consent in training her--a tall order that creates several barriers against her, even with her own parents. If there's anything that this movie strives for most, it's the sobering honesty of the families, schools, and communities that are not always supportive of what certain people deem as valuable.

Perhaps the single factor that drew me in the most about this film was the execution of Gracie's rebellion early in the plot. In an attempt to curb the pain of her family's loss and cope with Dad's rejection, the young girl compensates with alcohol, skimpy outfits, and flings with guys that go well beyond first base. The scenes were so thoughtfully done, and there was a certain authenticity with how a 15-year-old girl in that situation would be feeling and reacting. Though it's clear that her father's attentiveness would be the one thing to pull her away from his danger, the entire issue is proof of the theory that involvement in sports affords young people the discipline to stay out of trouble.

Beyond this, the theme of ""Gracie"" basically focuses on the price we pay for pursuing a far-fetched dream (and let's face it, it's not usually a cheap deal). Our heroine is a girl who obviously has the passion and grit to do well, but it is hardly a smooth road, and much of the film focuses less on the glory and more on how much this young lady must do every single day to have a shot at what she is doing. Even when she manages to earn the opportunity to try out for the guys' team, the male world of soccer is not exactly kind to the likes of a girl trying to ease her way in. Viewers will find themselves searching hard for a moment during which they can share in celebrating Gracie's success, but the truth is, the film's plot makes it as tough for us as they do for the main character. The ending is enough to generate a smile without feeling that the story went too far with the saccharine and unrealistic, and to me, that is the mark of a unique, credible movie.

If you did not get to catch this film when it was originally released in theaters, I hope you will get your family together to watch it when it arrives on DVD in September. Aside from a solid script that has something important to say for anyone who watches, it is filled with strong, hard-fought performances from the entire cast. Carly Schroeder has the ideal ""athletic beauty"" combination that film critics have been talking about regarding her performance, and though she is a relative newcomer (she had a recurring role in Hilary Duff's ""Lizzie McGuire"" TV series and theatrical film of the same name, but this is her first major role), she lends all the right elements to the character and indicates a promising future career in the Hollywood business. As Gracie, she is a bag of bolts, a fighting spirit, and while she thrives under her father's careful guidance, the real test comes when it is time to get out there and show everyone if she can do it. The way Schroeder executes it is brilliant, and there's no doubt that the casting crew got it just right when they chose her. Dermot Mulroney is terrific as always, delivering big as a grieving and conflicted father. His love for his little girl--his only daughter--is never questioned, but his hesitation in helping her realize her biggest goal involves far more intense factors, especially in a society where female prejudice is still a major issue. Elisabeth Shue--who is, again, the inspiration for the title character--steps in as Gracie's patient mother. Always hopeful, yet never afraid to come forward with the truth, it is an all-around enjoyable film that seeks to inspire in its own way.",1185235200,37,5363,4.72542735042735

I used the film to have a discussion about title nine and the evolution of women's athletics with a girls youth sports team; for the purpose, the film was good.  For them, ""Gracie's"" choices were the interesting topic, especially the choices the character made after a tragedy in the film.

For any parents reading the review, there are 2 places where she is kissing a boy heavily (once by a car and once in a car, but the dad comes and gets her out of the situation).  It does not lead to anywhere, but it will just depend on how strict you are are.  I just paused the movie and talked with my daughter about the situation.

2895136,2,B000T9D5WM,"This is a very dated movie in that the idea of a girl's playing on a boy's HS soccer team is completely unthinkable, and Gracie's dad doesn't help any by refusing to train her (he coached her older brother, who died tragically). It's also way too melodramatic. And Mom never steps in and says, Look, Jerk, your daughter is asking for you to spend time training her for soccer - get out there and do it, you mysoginistic pig!
Anyhow - It wasn't SO horrible that I felt like I wanted my 1-1/2 hours back, but it was close. Of course at the end there's the predictable all-is-well ending. It's predictable and a letdown. Maybe rent it at Redbox but I wouldn't buy it if I could go back in time.  I'm just a sucker for all things soccer. This was a bad investment.",1368057600,,760,4.277777777777778

2895148,4,B000T9D5WM,"This movie is by no means a little girl movie. It has way too much mature subject matter (sex, drugs, alcohol, and etc...). That being said, it stayed true to its real life events (that most of us would rather have left back then) events of 1970 era.

This is not a movie to watch if you want to learn new ground breaking sills, techniques, drills and insight for soccer. Sadly, the over-the-top recreations of the lack of girls sports and the reactions of the boys (and worse yet the way her female contemporaries treat her as well!) is thrown in your face.

This is a movie to see if you want to learn about the spirit inside of one very special girl's heart (that has very little athletic ability and little help) to succeed in boys' soccer after the tragic death of her brother.

Thanks for reading.

2895149,5,B000T9D5WM,"Gracie is a movie about a teenage girl, Gracie Bowen, in the late 1970s who can play soccer or football just as well or better than her brothers. In this film which is loosely based on Elisabeth Shue who plays the mother and school nurse's own life, the film is very Disney without the Disney quality. There is only one curse word and it's not one of the bad ones used twice. There are few scenes where she is kissing a boy and a guy in the car down the shore before her father catches her. The film was filmed on location in Northern Jersey like South Orange where Elisabeth and Andrew Shue were raised and Maplewood. The story about Gracie Bowen has lessons to teach and inspire today. It's a shame that it's rated PG-13 because I think schools should show this movie. It's not really driven by cliches.

Gracie is a movie that you can watch with your family too. The story of a teenage girl who loves the game of football/soccer and who decides to carry on her older brother, Johnny's legacy. He was the star athlete in the family and the two had close bond. I think Elisabeth Shue and Dermot Mulroney are perfectly casted and suited in the roles of the parents that they are very believable. The Bowens are a working class family. He works for a moving company but loves the game and was a star athlete. He cares for his elderly father who lives with them and Gracie's two younger brother.

Gracie has to compete and prove herself time and time again against the star athlete who wants her and does everything possible to make it difficult for her to fill her brother's place. Her best female friend who is terrified that her affiliation with Gracie will label her as an outcast and her best male friend who doesn't know what he has until it's gone.

I was one of the lucky people to see this film in the movie theatre maybe because I wanted to see what they filmed in New Jersey. I thought it was charming and worth watching again even for television or in the classroom. This film could have been a huge hit if it wasn't the rating. A lower rating and more publicity could have made this film a sleeper hit.

Regardless watch the credits until the end, you will understand why Elisabeth Shue is who she is today in part thanks to playing the game. The star, Carly Shroeder, does an excellent job without being over the top as Gracie. Andrew Shue plays a coach in the film too.",1245110400,,2382,4.37020316027088
2895150,4,B000T9D5WM,"Watched it with the family- loved it!  There are a few scenes where we chose to cover my 10-year olds eyes-- teenage kissing, promiscuity, smoking... but a great inspirational story, especially for soccer girls (and boys).

2895151,5,B000T9D5WM,"Gracie, a strong, determined, athletic 15 year old who loves soccer and is determined to play. This movie shows how the family deals with the loss of Johnny, the 17 yr old soccer star. Bryan, the father (D. Mulroney), immersed in his own grief, eventually uses his love of soccer as the only way he knows to reach his daughter, Gracie, who is starting toward destructive behavior in her efforts to deal with the loss of her brother, also her best friend. Johnny encouraged Gracie in soccer and had a lot of confidence in her skills.  The movie also shows a lot about soccer skills that Gracie develops under the watchful eye of her father who becomes her coach. The whole family is involved. The music is very repersentative of the time including two Bruce Springteen songs that he allowed as it takes place in NJ, his home state. I love it...all of it.",1218067200,,853,4.538961038961039
2895152,3,B000T9D5WM,"When high school soccer star Johnny Bowen is killed in a car crash, his grieving kid sister vows to keep his memory alive by taking his place on the team.  But first Gracie will have to overcome the strenuous objections of both the coach and her own misogynistic father to her plan.

Although it has many of the hallmarks of a Lifetime Original Movie - souped-up gender conflict, an overdose of sentimental uplift, and a plucky, inspirational heroine at its core - ""Gracie,"" which is set in late 1970's New Jersey, transcends many of its stereotypes and cliches through heartfelt performances, unpretentious writing and earnest direction.

Carly Schroeder has grit and charm to spare as the indomitable Gracie, while Dermot Mulroney and Elizabeth Shue acquit themselves nicely as her ultimately supportive parents.

It`s true that ""Gracie"" provides us with nothing we haven't seen a thousand times before - from ""The Karate Kid"" to ""Bend it Like Beckham"" - but inspirational-sports-movie fans should still find themselves cheering on this latest underdog story.",1209427200,3,1061,5.187134502923977
2895153,5,B000T9D5WM,"""Gracie"" is not just another feel good `underdog' film!  It is the true story of the Shue family (Elizabeth Shue and brother, Andrew, are both in the film) that touched me more deeply once I learned this fact.  A young girl is desperate for the love of her father, who dotes on his athletic boys as he coaches them to play soccer.  When Gracie's soccer-star brother is killed in a tragic accident, she becomes determined to try out for the boys' soccer team and asks her father for help.

The acting is fine and the story is good. I did think it was a bit much that none of the adult men took up for the girl when she was punched.

2895158,5,B000T9D5WM,"Prior reviews have given a good synopsis of this film, so I will not repeat the plot.  As the father of a daughter, I am always looking for the kind of film that matter-of-factly informs girls that, through desire and plain hard work, you can achieve your goals.  That is a common, obvious message, but ask yourself how many movies are delivering that message to girls without also referring, whether overtly or by implication, to appearance and sexuality. The universe of those films is tiny.  Well, finally, here is one!!  Unfortunately, this movie was marketed poorly and did not do well at the box office.  That does not mean, however, that it should die on the vine as a dvd.  If you think a simple positive message of grit and determination for girls is worthy of wide distribution, then its going to take word of mouth to do it, because clearly the studios don't care.  Spread the word about Gracie!!",1193702400,4,907,4.63125
