690979,1,630363642X,What were the actors in this movie thinking when they got involved with this highly political movie. It was sad to see some big names preaching their political philosophy.,1387843200,8,171,4.931034482758621
690980,5,630363642X,"THIS FILM SENDS A CHILLY MESSAGE ABOUT OUR RIGHTS AS A WOMAN. THOUGH I MYSELF WOULD NOT HAVE AN ABORTION, IT IS A RIGHT THAT ALL WOMEN SHOULD HAVE. IT IS BETWEEN HER AND GOD.",1376870400,2,174,4.0
690981,5,630363642X,"I saw this movie on a local channel, with commercial breaks, with great interest.  I'd never heard of it.  I have since ordered a copy of it with great difficulty.  Why is that I wonder?

Could it be because this is a film of America after the repeal of Roe v. Wade?  A time set some 60 years from now.  A film that illustrates just exactly where the anti choice activists and politicians are taking us even if they do not realize it themselves.

Imagine a world where the abortionist, the illegal abortionist, is not the only felon but the pregnant woman who seeks to terminate her pregnancy is also.

Only one politician, in Mississippi which has the dubious distinction of recently ending all abortions no matter what the circumstances, has faced the ugly truth of America without abortion choices.  He stated that if women resorted to coat hangers so be it.  He really, REALLY, said that in public before cameras for the record.  If women resort to coathangers so be it.

But in this film even the women resorting to coathangers, not only those who went to an abortionist, are subjected to an invasive investigation sanctioned by the U.S. Government.  An investigation that includes forced gynecological exams to determine prior pregnancy and ""illegal termination"".  All in the efforts to prosecute these women and send them to jail.

To Federal Penitentiares that are especially set up for such women.

I'm not surprised this film is easier to see and find in the EU than here.  Something else about ""Rain Without Thunder"" I discovered; difficulty in finding a copy.  Here we are ruled by extremists of every variety who decide what is right for all of us; whose minority opinions rule us.  They reach out even to venues that sell films and books and make their opinions like the force of law.  What other explanation can there be for the rarity of this simple film that screams at us about a world without choice?

I fear Roe v. Wade will end.  Too many people who believe in choice are complacent about fighting for it.  And very sensibly they are cautious to fearful in engaging the anti-choice groups who indulge in insane violence and even more insane ideology to promote their views.  Who wants to challenge a crazy person or crazy group of people.

But this film illustrates brilliantly this country AFTER the end of Roe v. Wade.  What we will be like then.  Chris Matthews pointedly demanded from a Catholic bishop what would happen to women who sought abortions if he and others succeeded in getting Roe overturned.  Because as I know and Matthews knows, the only choice governments have when recriminalizing abortion is to ALSO punish the pregnant woman.  But of course the bishop could not, or would not, engage in that discussion.  Noone wants to talk about this country AFTER Roe is repealed.  Because we all know what will happen.

""Rain Without Thunder"" shows us exactly what our world will be like for all of us.  Watch this film and be politicized to stand up and support a woman's right to choose.",1341792000,9,3020,4.713193116634799
690982,5,630363642X,"This movie was made 20 years ago, yet it is probably more relevant now than it was when it was released.  I'm sure that if it were remade today, it would make headlines everywhere and be banned in several areas.  This mockumentary is striking in its honesty.

In 2042, abortion is illegal.  ""Barrier devices,"" such as condoms, are legal.  ""Irritants,"" such as IUDs are illegal, but still available on the black market. Since they are not administered by a medical professional (or even sterilized), women often become septic.  If they are caught with such a device, they may be sentenced to three years in prison.

This story shows the glaring differences between different socioeconomic classes as well as racial divide in laws, or rather, how laws are prosecuted.

The scariest thing about this movie is that it chronicles exactly how easy our rights can be sucked away from us.  We have become complacent. We, as a society, need to do more to protect our rights.  Even to those of you that welcome government into your wombs by allowing restrictions on reproductive freedoms, this movie shows how restrictions can spread.  ""Search and seizure laws"" get slashed, allowing entire neighborhoods to be searched in order to control ""hypercrime.""

""People will invest more energy into protecting their jewelry than protecting their liberty.  Women not only placed their anatomical liberty on their doorstep, they elected the people who snatched it way.""

Rain Without Thunder should be shared with everyone concerned about maintaining and expanding personal freedoms.",1341187200,20,1564,5.154761904761905
690983,4,630363642X,"I saw this movie for the first time this week. This is a movie that is filmed entirely as a series of interviews by a television reporter, following the imprisonment of a wealthy and White mother and her teenage daughter. The unmarried teenaged daughter had recently become pregnant in the year 2042, and she and her boyfriend had decided marriage and parenthood were not options they could pursue. Unfortunately, current laws made it criminal for women to seek abortions (or ""P-Terms"", as it would be called then). Women who could not afford to leave the country for abortions were often caught and imprisoned (usually non-White, poor mothers), while wealthier women were getting abortions overseas. The government debate on how to catch the wealthier women was chilling - the debate included questions of pregnancy-testing all women at the airports, and ultimately concluded with a legislative decision to create the ""Unborn Child Kidnapping Act."" Thus, pregnant women leaving the country were charged with the crime of kidnapping for the intent to murder an unborn child.

Interviews with various individuals examining the imprisonment of the 2 women addressed issues of racial and economic inequality, ""federally-mandated motherhood,"" the history and evolution of the abortion debate (pointing out that the year 2000 saw an overwhelming change towards the conservative right - remember this was filmed in 1992), and the complacency of women towards the abortion debate. It was this complacency which was partially blamed for the radical changes in Roe v Wade, which in fact occured by courts ""whittling it away"" with small and seemingly insignificant changes.

The interview style and the futuristic jargon used in the movie can be tedious and distracting. There is little to no ""action"" in this movie - it is strictly a series of interviews looking at the multifaceted picture of how abortion rights could change over the next 50 years (the film was made in 1992, and the movie takes place in 2042). The predictions are chilling, as several of them have come true, 13 years after the film was released. I thought the interviews with the ""Atwood Society Director"" were the most predictive of future trends. I count myself as one of those people who moved from activism to complacency over the past 13 years, and saw that comfortable denial being exposed by this film. It is an angry and scary film, and many viewers could get turned off by the pounding message of the movie - which I think is unfortunate. It has a message which, like ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" should rouse us from our complacency and call us to action.",1164931200,20,2623,5.04147465437788
690984,5,630363642X,"The critics did not get or understand this film when it was released.  Although there were good reviews, many critics, particularly the NY Times, just could not get past the film's style.  Notwithstanding the ""talking heads,"" ""Rain Without Thunder"" is edited and composed in such a way as to be both dramatic and timeless.  The acting is superb, naturalistic and interesting.  It is a shame that the film remains locked away in the vaults of MGM collecting dust.",1097366400,22,462,4.884615384615385
690985,5,630363642X,"I give Rain Without Thunder 5 stars because of its message. In 1992 when this project came to fruition, it was a futuristic fantasy. In 2002 It is about to happen.

691199,4,630363642X,"This was a well made mock documentary.  My having given it 4 rather than 5 stars was the lack of a more relevant socioeconomic premise for criminalizing abortion than religious and moral concerns.  I think that if societal pressure as acute as that experienced in Japan currently were to hit the United States, this might be a plausible basis for the 28th amendment, but this was absent from the film.

691366,5,630363642X,"I just finished watching ""Rain Without Thunder"" for the 1st time.
I kept looking at the actors, thinking ""Why do they all look so young?""
The movie came out in 1992.
That is when my blood ran cold.
Everything between 1992 and our present, had not happened when the story was written...yet much of it has come to pass...my fear, of course is that the future depicted, from our present 2014 to the year 2047,
may also be likely to come to pass as depicted if we do not get our collective shtuff together!
The future as depicted in Margaret Atwood's ""The Handmaid's Tale"" is alluded to in this film as the name of a ""women's right's"" organization, The Atwood Foundation.
Every bit of terrifying as Atwood's story, Rain Without Thunder let's us see the path between here and the world of the Handmaid.",1403740800,25,797,4.541666666666667

This is just a 'what if' look at a possible near future.  Nothing running amok, just running pretty much like we are now.  The story is presented in documentary style, all talk, no action.
