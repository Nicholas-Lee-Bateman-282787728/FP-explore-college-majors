Basically Ruben Guthrie (the character) is very successful in the advertising industry, he's the best and he knows it. He also does most of his work while high or drunk and doesn't see anything wrong with this. However during a celebration party at his house for some big award he just won, in his inebriated mind he thinks it will be a good idea to jump from the top of his house into his pool. Of course it isn't and he misses the pool anyway. Expecting his fiancee who's a model, to keep him company while he recovers at home he is shocked and angry when she packs her bags and tells him she's going back to Europe. He pleads with her not to go but she's having none of it, but tells him if he can remain sober for a year, she will return to Australia. He decides to give it a go, but isn't just going to have to fight the temptation of another drink, but a best friend who comes to stay who just wants to party, a father who is always drunk and won't take no when he offers a drink, a mother with her own issues, and a boss who doesn't like the quality of his work when he's sober.

Ruben Guthrie from the plot description doesn't sound like the most interesting film in the world, but it is actually a lot more entertaining than you think. It's not a film you will remember in years to come but it's a film that will more than amicably pass the time.",1451520000,,1562,4.172185430463577
8744698,4,B019D234P8,"Ruben Guthrie, based on a popular Australian play of the same name, is about a fella who gives up the bottle for one year in order to win back his supermodel fianc&eacute;e, Zoya (portrayed by real-life supermodel Abbey Lee, who you may have seen as The Dag in the recent Mad Max). As most psychologists will tell you, that's not the best reason for committing to sobriety. Nonetheless, it casts Ruben off on a voyage of figuring out why he became and remained a functional alcoholic who had a successful life as an ad man. Bored yet? This obviously isn't for everyone, but it's probably enough to leave many questioning how the tale will end.

The are several odd things about Ruben Guthrie, including its final 10 minutes, which are philosophically yet entertainingly puzzling. Interestingly, the man who wrote the play & screenplay (Brendan Cowell) had gone through a year of self-imposed sobriety after a ""rollicking bender,"" chronicling the time in a diary he titled ""A Year Without Beer."" While I don't know if Cowell did it with the help of a 12-step program, plenty of the plot revolves around Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and the subculture of AA (again, it sounds a bit dull but is surprisingly not).

The cinematography in Ruben Guthrie is outstanding, and alone is worth the price of admission. Locations chosen for the filming were absolutely fantastic. Patrick Brammall was perfect as Ruben, and Harriet Dyer was a good fit as the quirky Virginia from AA. Abbey Lee was pretty convincing as Zoya, since it wasn't a stretch to act a supermodel. The hero / antihero of the film, Ruben himself, has an unwavering will that may be hard for 12-step devotees to swallow (e.g., keeping a fully stocked bar and substance-abusing best friend in your house during abstinence).

In full disclosure, I quit drinking a few years ago (without a 12-step program), so Ruben Guthrie probably has special meaning to me. Regardless, I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a good Aussie dramedy, and as an added bonus you get some insight into a nation and particularly a city (Sydney) of binge-drinking.",1450396800,,2097,4.868347338935574
