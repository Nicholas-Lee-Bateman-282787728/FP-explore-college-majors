2325492,5,B0009VRHLK,"Almost a year after its US launch, The Brown Bunny will finally be released on DVD!

For those that don't know the story - Gallo plays Bud Clay, a Motorcycle racer who travels across the country

to his next race and to find his one true love, Daisy. On the way he meets women that share the same pain that he has. When he finally arrives in California we get to witness some of the best film making (not talking about the explicit oral scene for which this movie is famous for)in American Cinema History.

Vincent Gallo's ""Brown Bunny"" is one of those films that is heavily bashed during its opening and then 5-10 years later is looked back on as a masterpiece.

The Brown Bunny was said to be ""the worst film in the history of the Cannes Film Festival"", by Roger Ebert. But then after it's release in the states and after Roger Ebert interviewed Vincent Gallo, He gave it a 3 out of 4 stars.

The problem is that the press hates Vincent Gallo, they think he is conceded and obnoxious and a jerk, but after they meet him and sit down for a one-on-one interview they find out that he is one of the smartest and coolest people on earth.

His first indie breakthrough film ""Buffalo '66 was also  bashed at the cannes Film Festival and then later labeled as ""the best independent film of the last 10 years.""

I really hope that Vincent Gallo continues his career in Directing because he really is a genius and there is no one else in this world like him.

I also hope that this DVD includes the full unedited version(with commentary) that was shown at Cannes because I have yet to see that version.",1118188800,10,1595,4.361486486486487

2325518,3,B0009VRHLK,"It has taken me eight years to be able to even begin to embrace this film. I've disliked this film immensely for the past several years, and when I re-watched it recently to be able to properly write this review, I dragged my feet on the ground until I wore a hole in my shoe. My sister warned me it was awful, but I didn't heed her warning. The first time I ever saw it was when it came out on DVD. It was unavailable at most video stores, and the ones that did carry it tended to always have their copies rented out, and most other stores just stuck it in the ADULT section. Being underage, that would've made renting it out from those stores impossible, so I ended up just buying the DVD from a local Borders. I was about sixteen years old at the time, but luckily I knew the clerk who sold it to me. He was (and still very much is) a queer like me who knew I was always on the prowl for challenging films with intense subject matter. I also knew that he hated this film but really was eager to know what I thought about it. I had seen Buffalo '66 prior to this and loved it, and I was already familiar with Vincent Gallo as an actor with films like The Funeral and Freeway 2: Confessions of a Trickbaby. When I sat down and watched The Brown Bunny, I was completely put off by Gallo apparently just like most moviegoers who saw the picture tended to be. The Brown Bunny is an infuriating experience, full of awkward scenarios of uncomfortable and, frankly, inhuman behavior that resembles the worst and the most banal aspects of everyday reality. I remember telling my Borders friend exactly those words. Oh boy did I hate this film. Sitting through it was so difficult for me, in fact, that I ended up injuring my right shoulder due to how much I was cringing and squirming throughout. I had to remove all of my clothing because the picture was making me feel like I was about to have an anxiety attack. If there is one thing that I can safely say about The Brown Bunny, it's among one of the most difficult films to actively sit through. If you're going into it thinking it'll JUST be a meditative, hypnotic experience that puts a microscope above everyday human behavior, prepare to be greatly disappointed. This film is deliberately pessimistic, angry, creepy, and emotionally and staggeringly hateful. Just about the only kind words to say about it is that its more light-hearted and more entertaining than Gus Van Sant's Gerry. This was my reaction the first time I viewed The Brown Bunny.

Since 2005, when I first viewed The Brown Bunny, I have watched the picture six times. That's five more times than I've seen Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. To put that into a more honest perspective, I've seen Atom Egoyan's Felicia's Journey roughly around twelve or thirteen times, all of these viewing in the span of a good two years when I was utterly obsessed with the movie. I've watched the William Hurt film The King about eighteen times total. I've attempted to watch Gosford Park about ten different times. I still haven't finished it. The point is, I love to re-watch strange art films that are difficult to swallow. The stranger the better. I can hardly wait to re-watch Wendy and Lucy, which to me is a similarly troubling film that I reacted very similarly to as I did The Brown Bunny. The Brown Bunny is one film that I have a difficult time re-watching. I've only ever watched it by myself, which is honestly probably the best way to watch it I feel. Every time I've watched it, it puts me through the emotional ringer. There's nothing that makes me more uncomfortable than emotional dysfunction, I've come to realize upon my latest re-watch. The Brown Bunny is not only a film about that, but it also explores it in what could be the most horrific way to explore material like this. Each time I've viewed this film, I've appreciated it slightly more and more. The first time I viewed this film, obviously as you can tell from above, I hated every aspect of it. Couldn't even begin to appreciate any element or scene of it. To me, it was just one big embarrassment. I refuse to call the picture a vanity project. A vanity project implies that the end result holds some sort of beauty, whether subjective or objective, and I don't even think defenders of this film can say that the subject matter or the imagery of this film isn't ugly. It's beautifully shot, sure, and it's beautifully presented, but do the ideas hold any kind of beauty to them? I don't know, I guess it depends on the person. The second time I watched it, I found the finale of the picture itself to be rewarding, but the fact that it takes place at the end of such an agonizing and humiliating experience of a film somehow made it feel futile to even begin to try and embrace. The third time I watched it, I was struck a lot more by the weight of the circumstances of the main character, Bud, who spends the whole movie driving his truck, occasionally stopping to re-visit and speak to acquaintances, drive his motorcycle, and have bizarre and cruel interactions with random females, before ultimately confronting an old girlfriend of his played by Chl&ouml;e Sevigny.

The forth and fifth time, I found myself enjoying more and more of the hypnotic imagery. The sixth time, I found the combination of long, meditative shots and intense emotional quality to be more interesting, but couldn't get past the dry atmosphere. The seventh time I watched it, I began to understand its darker elements a lot more, but was still put off by the sheer anger of the presentation. Now I've seen it again, back in late July of 2013. I am now starting to truly realize why I have such a difficult time with the picture, and why it is such a brilliant work of art. Make no mistake, the experience of The Brown Bunny is one that gets me shaking with fear, but now I can properly put into words what specifically makes it so off-putting and ugly. Vincent Gallo very much bared his heart and soul into this picture, and the reason why I initially rejected it is because I, along with many other men out there, have a deep personal fear of showing emotion and showing any sort of fragility. This is a film that explores the inherent weakness in men in the most personal way possible. It is a film that explores why masculinity will truly be the death of us all. I am ashamed to really say this, but as of writing this I am in my mid-twenties and I still sometimes feel like I've never grown up and am afraid that I never will. What does it mean to grow up? Who we have in this film is Bud, and I think the film makes it fairly obvious that he has not grown up nor does he have the mind of a typical adult. I think his behavior in this film is mostly childish, and he still very much shows a genuine fear of women through all the weird and disturbing behavior he exhibits throughout the story. He loved his ex-girlfriend Daisy (Chl&ouml;e Sevigny) so much because she represented someone who could actually take care of him and raise him like some kind of child still. He could act and behave like an adult, and even be in love with her and find her attractive and would even be willing to engage in sexual intercourse, but when it came to having a healthy relationship with no strings attached and no complications, he was a genuine failure. That's what makes the finale so heart pounding to me. He is completely lost and aimless in this world without another woman to take care of him. He is, I'm afraid, representative of many of the men out there. Many men haven't truly grown up and feel the need to have a woman in their life because they feel that's the only way that they can have any sort of guidance. Unfortunately, in the case of Bud, Daisy was a drug addict and was extremely self-destructive, and that's why this film is so troubling. We're watching a despicable man pursue an interaction with a woman who we all know is not healthy for him, and his understated obsession with her is what makes this film so deeply disturbing and difficult to sit through for me. I can think of hundreds of films that are all about the loneliness of the road and how much of a lie the American dream is, but I cannot think of as many films that are so damn bitter about it as this one is. If it were starring a woman and directed by a woman, critics and audiences would embrace it and celebrate it because that's what they expect. Here, the only thing that gets exploited in The Brown Bunny is Vincent Gallo himself. Even in the infamous hardcore blowjob scene, it is Sevigny who is very much in power and in control. Gallo spends the entire film laying bare everything that is physically wrong with himself. His large chin, his lanky frame, his high-pitched voice, his birdlike scowl, all are on display for about 75% of the film's runtime, and in the end he ultimately is exploring the idea of how it is the weakness of men and their libidos and their constant desire to adhere to tradition and dignity that has destroyed America the most. He presents this idea in the most non-elegant way possible. He paints a portrait of a man who cannot accept death or the idea of someone dying, and it is that kind of inability to move on that leads to the destruction of the human soul and the degradation of the human body.

To make matters worse, Bud is a scumbag. The women he picks up throughout the film all look and appear angelic. I'll give you one example of how painful this film is. The first girl, a teenager, has a striking resemblance to many girls that I know and grew up with. She has simplistic facial features. She is one of the most realistic looking girls I've seen in film. Her facial features have an unusual kind of beauty to them. Bud, with his creepy facial features, gets her to fall in love with him by showing a vulnerable, scared side of himself. He plays a different character, essentially. Then he ditches her at her home after he convinces her to quit her job and run inside to get clothes for the road. The scene is one of the scariest scenes in the film, for you almost fear that she'll run out of her home and see Bud drive away. The look on her face, in your mind, will be a look of tragic disappointment and shame. Luckily, she doesn't come running out, however, her face continues to haunt you for you just know that she'll look upset and sad, and seeing such a cute face with such crushed disappointment is an uncomfortable and utterly maddening feeling. You start to wish she had so that you could at least have a look of disappointment that doesn't match the horror you picture in your mind. It's almost as if the sadness of the scene itself could never match the tragedy your mind conjures up. That is, I feel, where the true horror of the film lies. It's the Taxi Driver syndrome. The feeling of wishing to see graphic images so that you can take your mind off of the image in your head of a character you care about crying and having an emotional breakdown. As powerful as this film is, The Brown Bunny will always be an uncomfortable, awkward, and creepy experience and always will be. The Brown Bunny is basically the Merchant-Ivory version of The Passion of the Christ. Both could be viewed by some as pornographic pictures that exploit the men rather than the woman. The only difference is that The Passion is slightly more S&M-themed.",1380499200,,11341,4.440978886756238

Gallo is Bud Clay, a motorcycle racer on a trip across the country to California. On the way he's looking for an old girlfriend he hasn't seen in a long time. He stops at her parent's house and at her old apartment trying to find her. He also has several encounters with random women that are strange and short-lived. You don't find out until the last 10 minutes of the movie what happened to the girl and why Bud is the emotional cripple he is.

I get what Gallo was trying to do with his film but he did it badly. The final 10 minutes are the only interesting moments and by then you've watched an hour and twenty minutes of dull, monotonous meandering.

2325529,5,B0009VRHLK,"In my humble opinion, Sicilian-American avantgarde filmmaker, actor, and artist Vincent Gallo is an underrated genius and deserves respect. The Buffalo, NY native's 'The Brown Bunny' is definitely not for everyone. It's notoriety surrounding an on-screen fellatio scene stunned (and disgusted some) audiences at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival that blacklisted it and the director. Gallo's war of words with Roger Ebert soon followed, giving 'The Brown Bunny' a tainted reputation. I'm never one to tell people who disagrees with an opinion on a film that they just don't get it. But with this art film, I can't help but come to that conclusion with many negative reviewers. Gallo superbly and powerfully captures the emotional state of sadness of a man on the run to no where with breathtaking scenes of the American highways. Yes, many are through a dirty windshield of a beatup van, however, the backround theme and Gallo's cold, quiet demeanor and glare are saying a million words throughout the film. The story is about a New Hampshire motorcycle racer named Bud Clay who drives cross-country to California to see his lover, Daisy (Chlo Sevigny).

It's not just ""shots of his head and the windshield"" (even though there is alot of that); There are lots of different, interesting shots, nicely done and it's not just his own turmoil; others' are shown as well.  It's a compassionate film.  Is it vain? So what if it is; it's his movie; if he wants to make a movie and watch himself so be it; nobody else has to watch it. I think he's an interesting looking and intrigueing enough person, just like Chloe.  This is basically a travelog, no different from what thousands of Americans have shot. I've driven cross country 4 times alone and it's pretty much exactly like this.  It also has some jarring emotional angles thrown in to make it a movie.  As far as Chloe's involvement, hey, if it strokes his ego to have thee Chloe suck him off, and Chloe is willing to do it,  good for him- the thing is is that he has spendt most the movie giving us time to think n' wait, thus giving the filmic catharsis weight.

2325532,1,B0009VRHLK,"This is about the most misleading and deceptive title one can imagine.

You won't believe this but somebody I know actually bought this movie sight unseen thinking it was actually about a brown bunny!  He thought it was a kids movie.  He didn't watch more than 10 minutes, saw it wasn't what he thought, and tossed it aside.  It was with several DVDs that he said he was through with.

I watched it.  It was, as many people say, a lousy movie.  No heroes or heroines, lots of pain and despair, ugly degrading sexual assault of a drugged woman, wasted time and a boring pointless storyline.  I would imagine that some of the guys who bought the movie copied the 5 minute oral sex scene toward the end to a hard drive and threw the DVD away.

A few small positives:  I kind of like road movies, i.e., movies about trips, and there were 5 or 10 minutes of road scenes that were interesting. Also, an underlying theme is the bad things that can happen to a woman who gets hooked on drugs.  People need to be warned about this but there are far better vehicles to do it.  Finally, Gallo plays a psychopath who uses other people, women in this case, entirely to satisfy his whims.  A good example of who not to be like.

There's no doubt half the viewers shut it off after 20-30 minutes. There's very little dialogue until nearly the end...if you can hear it. However we do get endless shots of Bud driving. Bud sitting. Bud staring. Bud being sad.

Now it sounds like these are all complaints, which they only half are. I'm pretty open minded and I can usually get something out of any movie. He does set a mood at least, and Vincent Gallo no doubt thinks he has an amazing set of eyes. He does kind of. Chloe Sevigny doesn't even come into the movie for over an hour. Her part is about the last 25 minutes. She mumbles and performs oral on Bud. Without question it's the ""climax"" of the film. Graphic yes, but if you've ever seen a porno in your life it's not much of a big deal. I found her desciption of being abused by some other men more disturbing. This isn't the first film she's done where she was on drugs and raped (Kids).

Overall I guess it's worth a watch, just so you can see the epitome of an anti-Hollywood movie. Did I mention it's slow?

My overwhelming pre-viewing impression was that this was a screamingly indulgent film--hyped for its one crucial, highly aruably groundbreaking scene--so I struggled mightily to give it a fair shake.  In the end, it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  Indulgent?  You betcha.  But that's just about a given for a true art film, and that's what you've got here.  Gallo is putting out some extremely personally meaningful art here, but the main problem is that I'm having trouble deciphering it.

Good art makes you think, though, and I've been cogitating on this film's story and its characters for the past two days, and I've got to admit now that the story is entirely plausible, and very intriguing.  The payoff comes only in the final minutes, which retroactively recasts the entire film.  Watching it again knowing its secret seriously alters the intake of the preceding 90 minutes, but it still drags, quite a bit.

Synopsis: Motorcycle racer Bud Clay drives his van from New Hampshire to Los Angeles as he struggles very, very deeply with loss, guilt, denial, his views and expectations of women, his past, his future, etc.  This poor guy really, really needs some professional help.

I found little enjoyable about this movie, not even Sevigny's famous oral sex scene, as that notable part is really quite ugly and non-erotic.  It's some mighty powerful filmmaking, you betcha, but what exactly is the point?  I keep wondering how that scene developed from writing to script, to Gallo discussing it with and then convincing Sevigny that the scene truly was integral to the story and his artistic vision.  He managed to do that, obviously, although it escapes me how this very arguably brave (on both Gallo's and Sevigny's part) act of filmmaking is crucial to the story.

This film is all about our central figure, Bud, played by writer/director/editor/producer Vincent Gallo.  He struck me as a cross between Woody Harrelson, with that jutting cro-magnon profile and the sunken eyes and searching, melancholy allure of Viggo Mortensen, but with the eyes a bit more sunken, just on the wrong side of normal-looking.  Bud looks downright greasy in every single shot.  We do get to see him shower, thankfully, but he comes out with his hair all gnarly once again, and he puts on stained clothing.

Kissing is a big deal in this film, and he does a lot of it, with a few different ladies.  But, the endless, groping face-pawing during the kissing was massively distractive, with Gallo's big ol' hands and just about creepy-long fingers.  Both Bud and the girls just pawed each other's faces constantly, like they were petting--blech.

And what of this brown bunny, then?  Early on Bud drops in to visit Daisy's parents, and Bud is either at the wrong house, they don't know what's happened, or they're in just as much denial about the ugly truth as he is.  Later Daisy talks about eating a giant chocolate bunny...well, that's a brown bunny, too, so what is the crucial meaning that has it titling the film?  Beats the hell out of me.

Bottom line: this is a movie that I really didn't enjoy watching, but now having thought about it for a few days and taking another look, am slowing warming to.  It was slow, visually dull and repetitive, and ultimately very, very unhappy.  The main reason I can think of to recommend watching this film is so that if and when it ever comes up in conversation, you can say that you have, in fact, seen it.",1285459200,3,3931,4.91060606060606

Seriously, viewers who aren't fond of their safe little comfort zones being horrendously discombobulated and shattered into tiny pieces need to stay far away from this one.

It's about a guy named Bud Clay, who is a competitive motorcycle racer that is constantly running away from his inner demons.
I will admit, much of this movie is uneventful. It just shows Bud wallowing in his own loneliness and detachment as he travels across the country to his next race. You're left wondering what has left him so flustered. This stagnant narrative is actually a perfect setup, it all culminates in an ending that is so emotionally searing, so graphically shocking and sad, I'm still trying to recover.

The end has an explicit oral sex scene performed by Chloe Sevigny. The Amazon editorial review labeled this graphic scene as completely unneccessary. I understand their opinion, but I think they might be overlooking a startling point. It's much more than a repulsive or gratuitous deed.

At times it feels like an invasion of privacy which is something you never feel during sex scenes in movies.  At one point in the film, Daisy says under her breath, ""Can we turn off the light?"" and ""Can we go under the covers?"". The character obviously insecure about her body.

I'd say it is much better than hundreds of one star reviews on the Netflix movie's site lead you to believe. I personally agree with Vienalle Film Festival that awarded to ""The Brown Bunny""  FIPRESCI Prize ""For its bold exploration of yearning and grief and for its radical departure from dominant tendencies in current American filmmaking"". In  exploring loss, regrets, yearning, grief, loneliness, inner numbness as the way to cope with pain caused by guilt, longing for the contact and inability to communicate, Vincent Gallo, writer/director/star/cinematographer/editor for ""The Brown Bunny"", definitely drove his point across (no pun intended). I think that Gallo found the right way to create a mood of quiet and unbearable desperation. The movie brought to my mind the line from one of the poems by  Paul Verlen, French poet of the 18th century, ""I walked, accompanying my own grief"".  Grief was the passenger in Bud's van and kept him company on the long journey across America, from New Hampshire to California. They had a lot to talk about but their conversations were speechless - that's why there is so much silence in the movie and only shots of Bud's face and his eyes.

Many viewers (and reviewers) mention in their comments the notorious explicit scene of oral sex between Bud Clay (Gallo) and Daisy (Chloe Sevigny), the one true love of his life. Those who dismissed the movie as totally worthless say that without the scene, nobody would every bother watching ""The Brown Bunny"". I would not speak for everyone but I would've liked the film even without two minutes of graphic sex  that in the context of the film is appropriately more disturbing and sad than anything else.

""THE BROWN BUNNY"" plays out like an Andy Warhol-inspired exercise that was warped into a vanity project. It's like a home movie on a family road trip where nothing is really going on and whoever has the camera is just killing time out of boredom

Some moments are quietly effective and inspire little musings in our heads. But far too much feels like something little that a brown bunny left behind... that's also brown.

Either the bunny or Gallo. He serves as writer, director, producer, composer and cinematographer. I think there's more, but I just don't have time.

The film stars Gallo as Bud Clay, a professional motorcycle racer going on one big long odyssey on the road to his old haunts to rediscover himself.

He will uncover a lot of things along the way, particularly that he is trapped inside a movie that just plain isn't very good.

Vincent Gallo's ""The Brown Bunny"" is a self-indulgent exercise in futility. Although Gallo may consider this a compliment, I mean the making of the film itself, not this hero's story. So masturbatory, I actually wished I was blind before I was even 1/4 of the way through.

But it could have been. If Gallo had cut more of the scenes (and I don't just mean a few), put some music down on the soundtrack, shown more of the beautiful outdoor landscapes... and less of the interior of the car, Gallo himself just sitting there, preening. Striking a model-like pose in long, long, unbroken shots that feel endless.

Like they're a half-hour long. Gallo is a strikingly good-looking European man, but not nearly so that we can watch him for that long without getting itchy and restless.

You kind of wish the filmmaker (and there's only one--Gallo himself) had conjured up more music and put it on the soundtrack. Some more music might have helped pump up a lot stillborn scenes.

My description of the the first 3/4's of the film torturous boredom doesn't even begin to do it justice. Gallo keeps the entire ""Brown Bunny"" moving at the pace of moss growing on a tree or rock.

There's a lot of flat, still dialouge with a lot of dramatic pauses (in a pathetic attempt to pump it up), the acting isn't much (except for Gallo and Sevigny) and the long, unbroken static shots with Gallo is staring off into the distance (which there are more than TOO MUCH of) inspired me to itch so much, I thought I came down with a horrible rash.

Hell, at one point, I actually wanted to throw things right at the screen. No lie, it actually came to mind--I would rather see some of the lowest points of ""Howard The Duck"" than look at Gallo's god dammed face for three more seconds.

Yes, that's how bad it got.

I know that the cut of the movie that was screened at Cannes (the film was not finished yet, but Gallo was pushed into releasing it) was indefinitely worse. But although I think that much of the editing was for the better (from what I've heard, it was vital), Gallo still needed to cut a few more scenes out of the movie and lay some more music here and there.

Despite talent on Gallo's part and some ambition to tell a worthwhile story, ""Brown Bunny"" moves at the pace of moss growing, no one throughout the film as a character is particularly intriguing or well-developed, not even Gallo's own character (the exception is Chloe Sevigny) and there are too many slow spot where we're just waiting for something, anything to happen.

We don't have any idea exactly what Bud is thinking most of the time (or God help us, Gallo even). Maybe we're supposed to figure it out for ourselves. Perhaps Gallo wants our minds to speculate and wander. Is he leaving the thoughts of this odyssey up to our imagination? Or did he just not think this one through.

I was often bored and shifting back-and-forth in my seat, all throughout (except for the ending). I thought the movie needed more scenes of dialouge, more moments where Bud and those he encounters on his journey interact.

Also, much of the dialouge throughout every scene throughout the film was written is so badly recorded, I couldn't understand a word they were saying. I had to turn on the SUBTITLES just to understand what the hell they were saying.

I'm capable of appreciating a deep, slow-paced movie. But this one isn't just slow, it's d.o.a.

Many European filmmakers know how to make a slow movie work like a chess match or a staring contest, so that even when nothing is happening, it FEELS like Hell itself is breaking loose. Gallo obviously hasn't mastered that himself. He should have seen more of their work and studied it before putting ""The Brown Bunny"" into effect.

The late, great Stanley Kubrick himself defined and cornered the market on quietly brooding, suspenseful films. I would suggest Gallo pop in some of HIS movies in if he ever wants to make another movie in this vein.

But Gallo himself has admitted he is no filmmaker--or artist. In any sense of the word. He is a hustler. A Midnight Cowboy of sorts. He has acted, modeled, directed, wrote, painted... have I painted enough of a picture myself?

He is a man of innumerable talents. But he has no major. He hawks his skills to whatever at any given moment. He may not be a household name, but those that do know his name... look at him as something a little more than mortal.

Ted Curson, Jackson C. Frank, Vincent Gallo are credited for the musical score. At least Gallo admitted he needed some outside help there.

Reformed supermodel Cheryl Diggs doesn't really provide anything else but filler to kill the static. Hey, maybe she serves a vital purpose after all.

Chloe Sevigny (""Kids"" and ""Trees Lounge"") is such a good actress and has such a touching character, it's a damn crime against cinema she doesn't have more scenes. She should have been such a more sustantial part of the film. She is a part of the fourth act where the comatose ""Brown Bunny"" almost bursts to life.

At the end of it all, there is the smallest ray of hope. Not just for Gallo's character, but for Gallo. And us. And his film. And what of that brown bunny that sits in the cage? That holds the film's prominent title? What of it? What's it's story?

I would have loved to see this world through it's eyes. What would it have to say? Do you wonder... ?

2325552,4,B0009VRHLK,"It's hard to describe Vincent Gallo's ""The Brown Bunny"" in words because it does not operate on a narrative level.  Most movies tell a story, The Brown Bunny tells an emotion.  Were it that easy to describe that emotion, I would, but like the emotions that come with love and the loss of it, it's not simple to explain.t

This movie is best left to each viewer to decide his or her own opinion.  Most people will either love it or hate it.  I'll admit that it is, for the most part, boring.  18 second long shots are common (the average in Hollywood is 2-5 seconds), there is very sparse dialog, and there is not much plot involved.  Simply put, Gallo plays Bud Clay (who is a polar opposite of his character in Buffalo '66).  Clay is softspoken, seemingly sensitive, and holds secrets from the viewer.  He departs on a journey looking for a lost love, all the while not much is known about his motives or what transpired between them to lead to his current, lonesome state.  Without saying too much, most of the importance of the film is in the end, which definitely drives Gallo's vision home.  The rest of the movie is not to be ignored, however, as it sets the viewer into an odd, emotional state on par with no other movie I've seen.

From a technical sense, the shots are simple, but beautiful.  Constant long shots of lonely driving transports the viewer to a similar frame of isolation.  Unknowingly, and effected viewer feels something for Bud Clay, even if he or she is unaware of what the feeling is.  These scenes, coupled with an incredible soundtrack, present an experience unlike others offered on film.

Yes, the movie is flawed in that it is inherently boring, but driving long trips in one shot (on one's own) often is.  Unfortunately, it is a necessity to allow the viewer some empathy in viewing this film.  Just be  glad that about 30 minutes was edited out of the film.",1205884800,,1891,4.508823529411765

Scene after scene of roadside travelogue with breaks of awkward interaction with people all makes sense in the last scene of the film.  A heck of a last scene it is too.  Yes, it has a graphic oral sex scene but it's really sad when you realize what haunts Bud (Vincent Gallo).  We discover that Bud's obsession with his old girlfriend carries deep emotional scars.  Apparently, she was an addict and not even being pregnant could curb her habit.  Bud's anger over this leads to an even more troubling event.  We see exactly what haunts Bud as he relives the moment when he's revisited by his old flame.  This version was heavily edited by Gallo from the original 102 minutes film festival version that caused such a sensation.  I gather the film was improved by this cutting and perhaps more editing would have made an even better film.  I get it, Bud did nothing when action was needed and now he prefers to squander the rest of his life without anything happening.  Or, he is so wounded that he cannot move past it and that makes for a very poignant moment.  But this brief flash of brilliance does not make up for the vastly dull and numbing travelogue provided beforehand.  Except for his random make-out sessions with lonely women (which is heartbreaking as he attempts to reconnect), everything else is mundane.  What's up with those drawn out close-ups of the back of Bud's head, or frames of just his ear, or countless other mind numbing moments?

Of the 93 minute running time, probably a good 70 minutes are nothing but shots of the road taken from the van. There is one exciting scene in which we get to see Gallo take his bike out of the van and run it at high speed across the Bonneville Salt Flats. While that would ordinarily be boring, it livens up this movie. Gallo is haunted by an anguished relationship with Daisy, the love of his life, played by Sevigny. The actual resolution of the disparate plot points at the end of the movie partially redeems the film, although the controversial scene immediately preceding that wrap up, which evidently involves a stand in (of sorts) for Gallo, isn't worth all the fuss. By that point I was just screaming ""End...End!"" in futility at the television.

Along his journey, Gallo meets three other women, Violet, Lilly, and Rose. Nothing furthering the plot happens with any of these women, they are there simply to demonstrate Gallo's generalized angst about romantic relationships, and possibly to demonstrate his love of horticulture given their obvious floral monikers. (I'm sure it is no coincidence that Gallo's character name is Bud, an immature flower...) I thought the women were all quite good in their roles. Sevigny was strong as Daisy, Cheryl Tiegs is good as a silent lost soul at a rest stop, and Anna Vareschi was great as Violet, the gas station attendant. I thought that Mary Morasky as Daisy's mother was excellent and provided just the right amount of pathos in a difficult scene.

This excremental movie is amongst the most boring things ever made. I didn't so much hate this movie as I was relentlessly bored by it. It is oddly framed (how many close-ups of Gallo's ungroomed sideburns do we really need?), in dire need of severe editing, and generally amateurish in every respect except for the acting in the female roles. The final ten minutes do provide some thematic enlightenment, but by then it's too late to save.

I have learned two lessons from this movie. First, if Roger Ebert says that something is awful, pay close attention; second, I really should be careful who I send Ebert's books to.",1187049600,5,2678,4.701492537313433

2325565,5,B0009VRHLK,"Yes, well, of course most people don't like this movie. If people don't realize by now that Brown Bunny is aimed at a limited audience--especially after all the hullabaloos (hullabali?) raised by this film--I don't know what to say about the movie-viewing public. The following are the facts of the matter; let them serve as either a warning or invitation to prospective viewers.

(1) The film is (materially) uneventful. By this, I mean that nothing much ""happens"" as far as dialogue, events, or otherwise obvious Hollywood razzmatazz. There are no car chases, explosions, fist fights, cute romantic foibles, jokes, sight gags, or secret government plots. What there is, is a lot of driving--of a van, across the U.S. There are minor, nearly wordless encounters scattered around, but the film is predominantly a mood piece, meditative, allusive, cathartic, evocative... If this doesn't sound appealing to you, then by all means save yourself the hassle and avoid this film like the plague. But to all those who think this is nth degree in a director's self-indulgence, this movie doesn't even come close. See a movie like Goodbye Dragon Inn or, for that matter, any of the major Taiwanese directors, and then you'll see a slow movie! (But not necessarily a bad one, however.)

(2) The movie is brutally depressing. If you make it all the way through (and many will not), you'll unlikely be whistling a merry ditty or feeling particularly chipper. It is certainly not a feel-good movie; in fact, it might qualify as a feel-very-bad movie, which I prefer anyway. A lot of people complain about depressing movies--they would rather watch something light and diverting. But here's the discrepancy: this isn't the cinematic version of Muzak, here to pacify the populace; it is art--which may (fear or fears!) be distressing at times. Life's like that. Get used to it. We have more than enough ""entertainment"" around to neutralize us into thoughtless zombies... pop music, magazines, TV, sports, and (ahem) the internet, just to name a few.

(3) Okay, here's another doozy, and this is the reason the movie has gotten any public notoriety whatsoever. There is an actual sex scene containing actual oral sex (apparently anyway) between Vincent Gallo and Chloe Sevigny. But, if you are visiting this page, you probably already know this. After all, why would 95% of people be visiting this page? If you are thinking of watching this film for the erotic factor, skip it. There are countless adult films better formulated to satisfy your needs. This scene is hardly what I would consider titillating. It's more sad, in a way. And, no, Chloe Sevigny hasn't destroyed her career by doing this, nor has she made an especially bad choice. (Notice that not many people accuse Vincent Gallo of destroying his career by doing the same thing. But of course many people strongly dislike Vincent Gallo anyway. I myself don't like his right-wing politics, but I still love this film.)

Okay, those are the three main obstacles preventing most casual viewers from ""enjoying"" (is that even the right word?) this film. If one or more of them seems unappealing to you, then save yourself the ninety minutes. It's as simple as that.

It was very appealing to me, however, and I imagine that some other people out in the world will find this film as important, moving, and meaningful as I have.",1173312000,34,3368,4.943462897526501

2325571,5,B0009VRHLK,"The Brown Bunny is a radiant metaphorical film about the nebulous landscape of intimacy.

The camera follows Bud Clay - a man of indeterminate age whose demeanor is heavily  imbued with sadness and insecurity - as he travels cross-country to reach California.

Melancholy, haunting music, and smoldering, impressionistic images of cityscapes and  countryscapes during the dusk and nightfall convey to viewers the tangled emotions Clay is  tormented with as he finds his way to California.

The further Bud drives forward towards California, into the future, the further back in time  Bud's mind and emotions travel as he relives painful memories of a young woman he once  loved; Bud is nostalgically reliving the same cross-country journey he once had with the young  woman in his memory, reliving all the emotions and twists and turns.

Brief, tenuous encounters with three lonely, alienated women (who represent different aspects  of the woman he loved) further confuse Bud and hinder his ability to escape memories that  plunge him into a synthesized, emotionally arresting knot of anger and impassiveness and  resentment and emotionless.

After Bud reaches California and enters a hotel room he once shared with the woman he  loved, we realize that Bud has been trying to break free of her memory by diminishing her and  her love: he has been trying to delegitimize her life and her love for him, and he has even  emasculated himself in order to justify his anger and resentment and confusedness towards  her, and to justify eliminating her memory.

But in the afterglow, we know that Bud will never eliminate her memory, she will always be in his mind, his past actions (or lack thereof) will infinitely haunt him, the sum total of their acts will engulf him, and his mind will circuitously evolve around his memory in the same manner that the sun rises and the roads turn and the sun sets - ad infinitum.

Magnificiant cinematography and use of desaturated colours, haunting soundtrack score  (Come Wander With Me, The Dying Song [which should have been played in the film]),  flawless acting and direction by Vincent Gallo, courageous choice by Chlo Sevigny; this film  is the pinnacle artpiece of Gallo's career and oneof the most underrated, underappreciated, and misunderstood films of the 21st century.",1167696000,6,2313,5.093085106382978

I think the movie is a good piece of art and the whole road part skillfully serves the purpose of preparing us to feel the depth of the main character's loss. By the way the scene everybody was talking about here that initially triggered my curiosity was not erotic at all (too much talking) but I don't think Gallo intended it to be.,1165104000,2,563,4.271028037383178
2325573,5,B0009VRHLK,"There are a few things that need to be understood about this movie. The first is that this not a typical movie in any sense. It's a kind of a road movie, but like all the best road movies the journey serves a symbolic as well as a narrative sense. The closest precursor to this film I can think of is Monte Hellman's ""Two Lane Blacktop,"" a film that drew similar derision 35 years ago but has gone on to become a kind of classic within film appreciation circles. Gallo's film takes some of the basic ideas about a road journey as existentialist metaphor from the earlier film and develops and tweaks them in interesting ways, resulting in one of the more ambitious and rewarding American films of recent years.[...]

So try to look beyond your initial reactions and take the movie on its own terms. One final note - Chloe Sevigny does not deserve the outrage that some of the guardians of public decency have levelled against her. She was and remains a fine actress, and while I cannot attest to her personal character, there is no reason to assume that her participation in this movie necessarily reveals her to be an immoral person. Remember, she and Gallo have been intimate in the past, so she doesn't do anything in this movie that she hasn't done before - while many other actresses routinely have very steamy scenes with actors they have never had a relationship with! Watch this movie carefully first, and reserve your judgments for later. When you do, you might just discover a bold and exciting experiment in American film.",1164585600,4,1533,4.615384615384615

If you prefer something action-packed, explained, traditional cinema, then this may come off as boring and/or pretentious. But if you are able to enjoy film that ventures to the netherregions of cinematic convention, then this is one that IMO is a winner.

Much of the film is Bud Clay's cross-country trek filmed with little to no dialouge with scenes lasting more than several minutes of mere face shots and road scenes accomponied by sad ballads. All we know is that he is traveling to a race from PA to CA and is trying to locate his ex-girlfriend whose brown bunny has outlived the possible lifepan of a bunny.

2325578,5,B0009VRHLK,"There is a lot about the Brown Bunny that didn't make sense, but in the end I found myself haunted by it. I find it rather ironic, that Bud Clay loved Daisy despite the fact that she didn't make sense, and in the end he was haunted by her.

In any case, the Brown Bunny is a film about a motorcycle racer who travels across country for his next race which happens to be in California, near where the love of his life, Daisy, lives. There is little more I can say about the film without giving away spoilers, for this is a film with a minimalist plot. Bud does meet some women across the way; women he is attracted to, yet, who are not Daisy.

Many say that the Brown Bunny is junk, but it did a lot for me. Here goes...

First, the scenes with Bud and the woman were some of the best man - woman interaction I have seen on film. With little to no words, I felt myself attracted to them. Gallo does a marvelous job of using the camera to convey attraction. Despite the quirkiness of the 3 flowers, Rose, Lilly and Violet, I found myself oddly attracted to them. This was due to the filmmaker and the acting between Gallo and said actresses. In these 3 minimalistic scenes, Gallo shows us everything that can be good about film romance, and everything that Hollywood is missing. Call it a lesson on chemistry, if you will.

Second, the film felt familiar. It felt like my journey, and a journey I have taken. The journey built up suspense as to what Bud was up too, and in the end delivered. But more than that, the journey is familiar because each of us (or most of us) have had those confusing days where a relationship has wavered and we are trying to figure life out. Bud's journey is our journey, and the Brown Bunny, despite using little words, conveys that well. Those who have never had a dysfunctional or soul mate-gone-wrong relationship might think this point is silly.

Third, the acting was brilliant. The immersion, off the scale. The intangibles were huge. Often the camera seemed to say a thousand words when the dialog said little. The silence spoke volumes. Sunsets, scenery and sadness.

Lastly, I walked away from the film thinking and feeling. It made me think about love, and live, and those I have yearned for but lost. I went to bed a ball of mixed emotions. Few films do this.

In the end, Brown Bunny is minimalistic with little dialog, but it is a movie well worth seeing. It makes you think, makes you feel, makes you wonder, and leaves  glad you watched the film, for better or for worse. Just like Bud Clay.

I loved it. I hated it. I loved it. If you don't understand dysfunction, Bud Clay, or the movie, you won't understand why I say this.

2325579,5,B0009VRHLK,"Since this movie is known most for the controversy, I am going to start and finish with it to reflect people's habit of starting and ending their impressions of something with a scene out of context. It wasn't porn, and my argument for that comes completely from the context... what happens directly before and after that moment. Basically, people have been angry at Gallo for being self-involved in this movie, especially that scene, but during that scene the self-involvement is literally the point. It's masturbatory, but the key is that it drains him, just like masturbation. One thing the DVD box says about it is that it's one of the ""frankest portrayals of male sexuality on film"" and so let's be frank here.

His sexual confusion is part of his grief, and part of grief is the habit of trying to deny it actually happened. So when he starts acting dominant during that scene with what's happening, it's his subconscious trying to throw a sort of male sexual dominance over something he doesn't understand and hasn't allowed himself to accept. But when it drains him, he's forced to admit that he doesn't only grieve for her but hates her for forcing him into that grief, and from there comes probably one of the best conversations (or inner dialog) I've seen in film in a long time.

But does it necessarily need to be ""shown"" rather than implied?

Well yes. Because the character's focus is so involved on it, it literally is all his mind is allowing him to care about in that moment. Basic rule of a close-up: if the camera focuses on something like that, then the director is trying to point something out. If it's porn, it's meant to arouse... but this scene isn't arousing, especially because of its context.

But enough of that, because I want to discuss something else about this movie. Partly because of the controversy around this movie, and partly because of the publicity, I had the initial impression that Gallo was an abrasive and over-masculinized character in this film. Wow, complete opposite... I totally related to his character. Of course, his short relationships with those women don't seem to work at first, but once we get an idea of where he's coming from in his grief (and men's general dislike of expressing it or asking for help), the relationships make perfect sense in terms of being representational (thus the obvious motif of all of their flower names and his name as ""Bud""). Basically, the first woman fits what he's looking for courteously, the second emotionally, and the third emotionally, but none of them match the full attraction he has to the only woman he's ever loved. I liked it.

And the long continuing imagery of the road trip was really neat too, as it actually really captured that introspective feeling of it. Most roadtrip movies show the car in moments of time from the exterior... which kind of changes the perspective of what a roadtrip is. This movie shows it literally from the passenger seat, complete with the dirty/smudged window and the long road stretched ahead. I think there was only one shot that was actually an exterior of the van when on the freeway, the rest of the exteriors were when the van was parking or he was stopped somewhere. I find it very lovely, ultimately, and as my mother once said, ""The road trip is something of a rite of passage amongst American males. It's a moment when they take on as much of the world as they feel necessary all on their own."" Gallo seems to have the same idea, though there is a major American film genre built around that idea as well: the road as a literal transfiguration of self-discovery.

So, going back to the controversy, it really disappoints me that this film has to be known for that when there is so much more art and beauty and innocence it has to offer. I also find the controversy rather inconsistant, considering most people have absolutely no trouble with the female body in various states of arousal, yet as soon as ""the male gender"" is shown, it's pornographic! The funny thing is, it contributes to that very male sense of fear and dominance they feel they must assert sexually. So I guess I could make an argument that Gallo did that scene to attack that inconsistant form of sexual censorship, but if I didn't already know that basically Sevigny and he agreed to do it because, ""Why not, we were in a relationship, we did it before, might as well just show it!""

2325580,5,B0009VRHLK,"This movie has a lot of moments that can make the viewer feel awkward or uncomfortable, with very slow pacing and, especially towards the end, with material that seems more [...] (I don't think it could have possibly been a real body part, by the way). One starts to wonder what is this all leading up to? This movie, however, needs to be seen in its entirety and then all of its parts will make sense, nothing is really done without reason; only then will the viewer realize what a masterpiece it is.

It is kind of like a retelling of Huckleberry Finn, the plot consisting of nothing more than a journey, except in this film, with the loss of childhood innocence. It is interesting to note that when the young Bud and Daisy first made their way to the wonders of California, escaping the drudgery of their life in rural Buffalo, NY, they really ended up in the same place from where they started, back to suburbia hell, except this time with palm trees and smaller houses. One can also look at this movie as a retelling of the Great Gatsby, as well.

Pay close attention to the different narrative styles. Throughout much of the film, Vincent Gallo's character is telling his story, which is really more narrated to himself than to an audience; the filming is very choppy and at times out of focus or some of the action is actually off-screen (so much so that it makes you think that Gallo just set up the camera and is actually doing all the filming himself). There's not a whole lot of talking, as he travels from one motor bike race to another. He seems almost lost, even though he knows the route. At the end of the film, when he meets up with Daisy and they talk together, for the first time we see Vincent Gallo's character and much of the action  in clear focus in the full frame and there's more of a dialogue. Gallo has done an excellent and thoughful way of presenting the characters, by portraying inner and personal dialogues, feelings, thoughts, emotions that all go on inside the person versus an outside perspective, how one appears to others from the outside, that can still be revealing about a person.

I thought the female actreses were all great, especially Cheryl Tiegs and Chloe Sevigny. Gallo uses the ""flower"" girls/women cleverly to represent the different stages of Daisy's life, and yet shows that as a person, Daisy is irreplacable.

Gallo has made an incredible film, exploring an area of life most directors wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole, and yet affects us all, or at least some aspects of it.",1148169600,11,2532,4.556043956043956

Yes, he's even the Director of Photography. This movie is odd. It's unlike anything, even 'Buffalo 66'. All the shots in the movie are way too closeup or too far away or too grainy. But that's the look of the movie, so It's OK. That's the way the movie needed to look. Then there's the storyline. This film is 92 minutes long with very little dialouge. It's almost as if someone put a camera in someone's van and just let it film them as they drove across the country. Except, there's no radio in their van. There's nothing. This movie really is dull and seemingly uninspired; but that's what Gallo wants it to be. It's not a just a movie showing us a lonely guy...It wants us to feel his loneliness. Gallo plays Bud Clay, whom we meet as he competes in a motorcycle race which he loses. He gets in his van, with the bike in the back and drives. He stops at a gas station and meets an attendant named Violet. He tells Violet he's going to California. She mentions that she's always wanted to go to California. He says ""go with me"". She says ""I don't know you"". He says ""go with me"".

Then she's in the car. He leaves her at her house and continues to drive.

He eventually meets a woman named Lilly. Well, kind of...He doesn't meet her. He sees her sitting on a bench looking as lonely as he does, so he sits next to her. Then he gets back in his car and drives. This is pretty much how the film goes until 75 minutes in, Bud ends up at the motel to see the love of his life Daisy (Sevigny) and we've all heard a thousand times what happens at this point. A lot of people, especially viewers but a lot of critics too, see this movie as a film maker who thought he was making a masterpiece who instead makes a boring, slow, ridiculous movie. This movie is boring, there's barely even a plot. But, as I said, that's what Gallo wants it to be. Unlike 'Buffalo 66' our questions are answered at the end of the movie for the most part...But that doesn't mean we're given a resolution. Just an explanation. Bud is a lonely guy, suffering a devastating loss and if the movie continued to follow him we'd no doubt watch Bud Clay finally committ suicide. This movie is not for everyone. This movie is not a movie you rent Friday night, kick off your shoes with some popcorn and watch. This is an art-house film that takes some tolerance from the viewer. The fact is, the most powerful scenes of the movie occur in the last 15 minutes. During and after the oral sex scene. This is not just a pointless sex scene Gallo wanted to put in to intrigue people. This scene needs to be in here, in it we see the pain of a man.

If the moments leading up to these final minutes had been more entertaining and less dull; a lot more people would like this movie. But, it's simply not so.

So, yeah. I liked this movie. In the end it becomes a beautiful and poignant film. I'm not saying you'll like it or even agree with what I've said in this review. But, this is life, love, and loneliness told in the most painstaking boring way possible. It's Vincent Gallo's ""The Brown Bunny"".

I think you just have to relax and get into it and not worry about it not having a traditional narrative structure.

It's atmospheric and beautifully shot, just a nice movie to watch.",1143158400,15,293,4.509433962264151
2325584,2,B0009VRHLK,"David Lean once said, describing the scene in Laurence of Arabia where Peter O'Toole rides from the distance towards the viewer that the producers lost their nerve and cut the unblinking shot down by a minute, that the longer version was ""better"". In a similar vein, the much maligned scenes looking through a van windscreen in The Brown Bunny, are weakened only by being cut short. This is because the impact of the fleeting human contact between driving is heightened by the endless hypnotic quality of driving. This is the real feeling of driving around: time ceases to be a factor when you are not trying to be somewhere but just keep moving towards a continuously receding point on the horizon. There is a cultural factor here as well: we are familiar with a roadside America via any number of road movies, pop videos (U2 spring to mind) and novels (Lolita is far more absorbing in its descriptions of mid 20th Century motel life than the workings of a paediphile's mind). But spectacular scenery, slick cuts, special effects, draining or saturating colour all romanticize the sheer dullness of travel. By contrast Brown Bunny plays on the familiarity to convey an ordinariness which is entirely lost in films which try to grind out the metaphor of personal emptiness by picking unusually bleak settings.

The people too are ordinary which makes the ultimately revealed back story all the more shocking even though, it is also ordinary in its way. This leaves the message ""there but for the grace of god"" all the more indelibly imprinted on the memory. I find it difficult to connect emotionally with characters who show no emotions but Bud shows exactly the kind of pain, indecision and yearning which go straight to the heart of loss.

The other obvious charge levelled at this film is that the fellatio scene is gratuitous. This is a moot point. This is a normal sexual act filmed without any kind of exaggeration; it is dealt with in exactly the same cinematic manner as talking, kissing or driving. If doesn't stand out or jar against the flow of the film. Showing a couple about to copulate and then playing music and cutting to extreme closeups of sweat droplets - that is gratuitous. Moreover it carries the story forward. What most people seem to miss is that this is not pornography in the sense of watching sex to masturbate - this is watching the sexual fantasy of someone masturbating. Sexual fantasies are not coy. This is made all the more evident by the lack of any other nudity or sexual activity up to that point - many European films lose the impact of sex by over-abbundance of nudity (maybe a sign of my Anglosaxon uptight attitudes).

This is the ultimate guilt trip: on the surface Bud is looking for redemption but at the same time he has the same physical desires as any man, the same desires that caused all the trouble in the first place.",1141948800,13,2870,4.713147410358566
2325585,2,B0009VRHLK,"I was gonna write a really condescending review of this movie. The film's first hour inspires mostly derision from the vewier: see man drive, see man park, see man drive some more, with occasional awkward conversations with strange women and a prostitute. The last 30 minutes, however, are undeniably powerful and disturbing. We finally get an answer as to why Vince Gallo's character is so screwed up. If only the previous 60 minutes were as good. So, The Brown Bunny is not terrible. But it is tedious and unfulfilling. Even after the almost 30 minute cut that separates the Cannes Film Festival version from this one, the movie still feels about 25 minutes too long. The Brown Bunny could pass as an interesting, 45 minute student film at NYU or USC. But for an experienced director, Gallo should be better at polishing, driving the narrative, and fleshing out his characters.

But what's especially remarkable is that Chloe allowed Gallo to finish inside of her mouth. Believe me when I tell you, that is a hallmark of a fine woman, who in this film delivered an awesome performance, replete with sounds of ecstacy as she was doing it. Simply divine. The sequence is what the A-B repeat function on your dvd player was MADE for.

2325590,2,B0009VRHLK,"Well, this is certainly much ado about practically nothing. As anybody who keeps up with the current cinema scene outside the ""Sound of Music"" type of offerings knows, ""The Brown Bunny"" is supposed to have one of the most controversial ""live"" sex scenes of any legitimate movie ever made. And perhaps it does. But if you are not careful you will have fallen asleep and will miss the ""money shot,"" since what causes all the consternation from the public occurs in the last 5 or 10 minutes of the film. It is also at this late date of this 90 minute film that that you find out what has been ailing the morose Bud Clay all along. He is mourning the lost of the love of his life Daisy (Chloe Sevigny), certainly a respectable subject for any work of art. She gets resurrected, of course, to perform the sex on Clay.

The actors to a person mumble-- if they talk at all-- the first 10 minutes or so of the movie are about a motorcycle race with no dialogue at all. In much of the movie we see the director/actor Vincent Gallo driving across the U. S. with shot after shot of a closeup of his profile that covers about 1/3 of the screen. Then we have a section where all we see are the windshield wipers against out-of-focus rain. The camera often jumps as well. Even in so-called ""art"" films, shouldn't whoever is shooting have the technical skills necessary to do a professional job? This movie reminds me of something an acquaintance showed me he had made in a beginning film class. I was embarrassed when I watched the film since he was so proud of his creation and expected compliments. About the only good thing about the entire movie is the soundtrack, particularly the song by Gordon Lighfoot.

Supposedly because of negative reviews after this film was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, Mr. Gallo edited it, thus producing a better Bunny. I cannot comprehend of a version worse than this one.

This movie can be summed up in one word, boring.",1135900800,6,1947,4.494350282485875
2325591,3,B0009VRHLK,"This movie garned lots of press at international film festivals for its ""racy segments.""  Gallo is a one-of-a-kind actor/director, and I was early awaiting his latest offering on DVD, especially if it was sensationalist and scandalous.  If you check this movie out, be prepared for some veeeeeery slow action for 99% of the film.  We get many scenes of driving--driving at night, driving during the day, driving with a bug-splattered windshield, driving through small towns, driving past truckstops, driving in the mountains, and more.  You will definitely ""get it"" and feel like you are on an endless, monotonous car trip with no point.  My recommendation for surviving the driving scenes is to make judicious use of the ""skip ahead"" button once you've seen the first few minutes of driving.

All of the action happens in the last 20 minutes of the movie.  There is a brilliant plot twist that actually comes close to making the film worth it, and there is the infamous *real* oral sex performed by Ms. Chloe Sevigney.  The scene is actually the climax of the movie, because the conversation they have during the interlude highlights everything going on in their relationship.

All in all, I'm glad I saw this movie, if only because it was made famous by the insults traded back and forth between Gallo and Robert Ebert.  If you watch it, know that the last 20 minutes is where it is at, so don't give up hope during the early pointless scenes.",1135555200,5,1445,4.790322580645161
2325592,5,B0009VRHLK,"I could watch this movie forever.  It looks stunning.  I just want to hop in a van and drive until I die after watching this movie.  You could throw in more characters or dialog or whatever, but I'd still look at the green hills, the sunlight filtered through the bug splattered window, and every other beautiful sight in this movie.  Some of the places aren't traditionally breathtaking, like the lights of a cluster of gas stations and restaurants at night, or a wide city expressway in the rain.  But I see these things, and they remove my breath.  With scenes of mundane events and Bud's utterly bizarre social behavior sprinkled evenly about, the movie seems to get to LA in no time.

Once Bud is LA and he is reunited with Daisy, we get a lot of plot filled in, and Daisy gets a lot of mouth filled in with Bud's penis.  The oral sex is the least erotic thing I've ever seen, but the lens flares and the contrast between the brown clothes and the bright background looks fantastic.

The ""story"" in the movie happened before what we see in the movie.  The movie is an epilogue that drops tidbits of information about the story.  The story happened from when Bud and Daisy met as kids until the night, decades later, when Bud last saw Daisy.

2325595,3,B0009VRHLK,"The 'road', as an open highway to emotional oppurtunity, is a glistening blue and gray effect in Vincent Gallo's notoriously criticized, ""The Brown Bunny"", the portrait of an eccentric lone wolf who packs up his motorcycle in the back of his van and travels from New Hampshire to California. As a road picture, it seduces the viewer to kick back and comfortably watch the winding highways and impending horizon, despite the genuine nutcase driving the van. Singer-songwriter, Gordon Lightfoot's ""Beautiful"", becomes a crackling, cheery and upbeat ode to love, through the bug splattered windshield, in one perfectly pristine scene. I could have driven for hours, but by the time he reaches California, and the infamous oral sex scene, with a nearly comical (and egotistical) stunt-male organ, things get a bit, um, tasteless. Our hero's delusions turn out to be not very complex, and the significance of a flashback detailing his history, amounts to a character study the equivalent of a criminal and psychotic mind on network TV. As for the symbolism of the brown bunny, (there actually is a brown rabbit in the film), I fear it goes no further than a geometric shape children might see in the commode.",1133827200,4,1203,5.02
2325596,4,B0009VRHLK,"I suspect most people end up viewing ""The Brown Bunny"" because of the controversy surrounding it, because writer-director-actor Vincent Gallo's 2003 film is not exactly the sort of film you are going to stumble across.  If you are a fan of Chlo Sevigny or Cheryl Tiegs that might be the case, but given how earnestly the promotion of this film courts the controversy that will almost invariably be the conduit by which most people come to see it.  The teaser trailer has the scathing line from ""Entertainment Weekly"" that ""No one in America will ever see a frame of this film,"" shows us only Gallo in profile driving his van, lists the main actors, and then fades to white with the final enticement ""ADULTS ONLY.""  The other, second, trailer should be avoided because it gives away the twist at the end of the movie and what is the point of having a twist if you see it coming?  Rethinking the movie in terms of that new knowledge is a retroactive experience, or something that should be reserved for a second viewing, and not anything that should spoil the first viewing.

However, the controversy that is being stoked is somewhat disingenuous at this point because after the disastrous screening of ""The Brown Bunny"" at Cannes, which initiated the angry exchange between Gallo and the critic Roger Ebert, the director re-edited his film and cut out 26 minutes of the film.  So this version is not the original version, and apparently everyone who has seen both versions (including Ebert) finds this version to be superior.  One choice example can explain why: when Gallo's character, motorbike racer Bud Clay visits the Bonneville Salt Flats he takes out his bike and rides off into the distance.  Originally there was a shot of him coming back as well, which could well produce a laugh at the rather pointlessness of the exercise.  See Bud go.  See Bud come back.  But by simply letting Bud disappear in the distance before resuming his cross-country trek gives the scene more weight.

At the beginning of the film Bud finishes a motorcycle race, shot in long distance so that sometimes the sound fades away, and then decides to head for California to race.  Before he goes he does two things.  First, he persuades the young girl at the convenience store where he buys gas to come with him, only to abandon her when they stop at her house for her to pick up a few things.  Second, he visits an elderly couple and tries to get them to remember that he used to live next door.  Together these two scenes provide our initial oblique cues as to what this journey is about.  But it is hard to know if a character is running away or running towards something or someone if you do not know the reference point, and therein lies the maddening quality of watching this film.

""The Brown Bunny"" is what I would most decidedly call an art film, based mainly on Gallo's preference for leaving the camera in place and letting action take place on the other side of the car window with the characters not always adequately captured by the frame.  However, this style matches the substance of the film, because these moments in Bud's trip across the country are neither clearly seen nor completely understood.  Consequently it is not surprising that many people would give up on watching the film because they find it to be so tedious, while others will look at the same thing and find it indulgent.

I picked up on a key clue regarding the twist when Daisy (Savigny) appears in Bud's hotel room, but I did not see it coming and I have to say that it was more Gallo's performance at the end that bothered me that the sex or the final revelation.  He says so little for most of the film that when we finally get to the point where he talks he whispers and then he whines.  The former is unsettling once you understand what he is saying to Daisy and since the latter sets up a jarring contrast between their tones that reflects the dynamic.  So if a film intends to provoke an emotional response adn does so, that would speak to some level of success.

Finally, is the sex scene gratuitous?  No, because throughout his journey Bud has essentially been saving himself for this moment.  Is the graphic depiction necessary?  I would argue yes, provided that it is indeed a prosthetic, because then I can see it as fitting into the twist.  If not, then it is an example of gross indulgence.  Despite the claims of some that it was real I think the fact there is no difference between the before and after shots (which may be a telling clue in itself), and that Gallo avoids rendering the whole question moot by showing the point of connection, confirms my suspicions.  More importantly, if it is really real then it destroys the illusion Gallo works so hard to craft in the climactic scene of his film.  ""The Brown Bunny"" gives you plenty to think about, if you are so inclined to try to unravel it all and come to your own conclusions.",1133740800,10,4918,4.572405929304447
2325597,5,B0009VRHLK,"Warning: This review may contain some spoilers for the uninitiated.

For those readers remotely familiar with Vincent Gallo's Buffalo 66, I need not really say much to pat the man on his back. Buffalo '66 film had layers of dark humor, lots of heart, & quirkiness to make us fall in love with his craft.

Gallo returns with a another love story of sorts but there is really no dark humor or quirkiness here whatsoever. This time around he introduces us to a lonely, lost soul by the name of Bud Clay traveling solo on the highway after just finishing a bike race. Along the way back to California, he meets three different women who all appear to be lacking what it seems he longs for. Love.

In between the meetings of these three unique women, we see many long shots of driving while hearing rather somber music while often iinclude shots of rain which prolong this deep feeling of sadness that our protagonist can't seem to shake. Thus, Brown Bunny is essentially a lugubrious ballad placed on film about the journeys we sometimes make only to find that we can never go back to what we once had. Gallo shows us how much we really want to have hope even though our heart has all but convinced us that there is literally no hope to be found.

Contrary to what reviewers have written, Brown Bunny is a very soft if not slow moving film with very tender scenes much like some of the moments in Buffalo '66. Although the ending will burn you for a long time, the film does have a tremendously huge heart & the ideas Gallo presents here will stay with you long after the final frame.

Brown Bunny itself has two basic meanings although I'm sure each viewer will pick up something totally different. Bud Clay's girlfriend left a pet bunny with her mother when she moved to California & never came back for it. My interpretation: Bud felt like he'd abandoned his love interest when she needed him the in the most crucial moments. Also, Clay had given his girlfriend a chocolate bunny for Easter which she had eaten completely (or so we learn through dialog) & thrown up shortly afterwards. In the most heartfelt dialogue between the two main characters , we learn that he kissed her anyway because he truly loved her even after she vomited.

And now the part you've been waiting for. There is a very graphic oral sex scene at the end of the film (the last ten minutes to be exact) but I personally didn't feel this took anything away from the film. The ending was intended to be very dramatic, emotional, & raw. Highly recommended!",1132617600,14,2526,4.504366812227074
2325598,2,B0009VRHLK,"Written, directed, and produced by Gallo, `The Brown Bunny' not surprisingly stars Gallo himself. When a film is made this way, people would naturally think that the film is all about Gallo and his life. In brilliantly original `Buffalo 66' it worked. In `The Brown Bunny' it fails because of the now notorious love scene, which is not only pointless but shows Gallo's ego-tripping film-making.

Gallo plays Bud Clay, a professional bike racer who is heading for California. In the rather lengthy opening scene, we see him riding a bike on the race course, making a circle again and again, suggesting the hero's never-ending search for something.

For Bud, 'something' is Daisy his love. But we are not allowed to know anything about his and Daisy's past until the last 20 minutes. Instead, during the road movie style narrative, Bud keeps on driving, going to the west, occasionally meeting girls whose names are all those of flowers.

And finally, the oral love scene with Daisy played by Chlo Sevigny. If you can find any meaning in this embarraing scene, (I mean, not in `love' but in 'oral'), please let me know. Explicit sex scenes (which I do not particularly dislike) often blur the other merits of the film, and this is exactly the case here. As you know, Gallo decided to cut the film by about 30 minutes after the debacle at Cannes Film Festival, but the sex scene remained in the film. What made Gallo include that part? Or what made Sevigny accept the role in the first place?

For all its self-indulgence, I like certain part of the film. The film beautifully captures the bleak atmosphere of the roadside in America, and though you may not agree with me, I don't find Gallo's acting so awful. But that may be because I now come to think that Gallo is always playing himself, a coolest guy with sad eyes who knows he would never be in the mainstream, and if you like Gallo (like my cousin), you would not hate him whatever he does.

Still, even avid fans of Gallo should admit that his recent films are not as good as pre-`Buffalo' era including amusing `Palookaville.' Why `The Code'? Why `Freeway II'? and why wretched Italian `The Undesirables'? And most of all, why this?",1132099200,3,2189,4.675324675324675

This is not a movie you should watch if you have recently lost a loved one through death, divorce or breakup because if you weren't suicidal before, you will be afterward.  It is basically a stream-of-consciousness type of film that centers on lonliness and remorse after the tragic loss of a loved one.  Anyone who has gone through a devastating loss or breakup will get this movie.  The rest will be puzzled and bored. I had the advantage of knowing a little about the story line beforehand, which helped me appreciate the film more than most reviewers here.  What I liked most about the movie was the lack of ""Hollywood dialogue""....this just looks completely improvised (and perhaps it is), and therefore has a gritty, realistic, truthful feel to it.

For crying out loud, when we say performance, baby, you got to PERFORM.  This is what has been missing from art all of these decades, real make-believe realism.

The rest of Vincent Gallo's film is from the Gus Van Sant school of ""watching paint dry"" cinema.  Introduced in the 60's by Andy Warhol, who filmed a man sleeping all night and also focused a stationary camera trained on the Empire State Building for a full day,  these cinematic exercises in tedium had actual idiots sitting through their entire 8 or 12 hour presentations.  I suppose they thought it was art.  Well, Gus and Vincent seem to be attracting the same type of intellect.

So, if your idea of entertainment, or enlightenment even, is to watch a gloomy narcissist endlessly driving across country, with intermittent inane encounters; if you deplore actual dialogue with purpose, characters with depth, and a dramatic strucure that illuminates artistic intent and insight; if you prefer the cinema of turning on a camera and letting it run, this is the flick for you.

For the curious, ninety percent of the film is this boring drivel of shooting out the windshield as Gallo drives, or motorcycle races, or dumb mumbling with vapid women, and Vince doesn't get his k shine until the last 10 or 20 minutes of the film, so you can skip ahead if that's what you want.

Keep in mind that the highway shots appear between all other sequences.

Firstly, I really didn't mind those highway bits - at first. In general I liked the music in this movie and the highway shots were fairly nice, but they might work better projected onto a wall in your house while you're doing something else. Something like the film equivalent of ambient music.

Secondly, the movie is excrutiatingly boring. I can't stress that enough. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate long movies, or subtle ones, but this is too much. You can only watch Vince Gallo bury his face in his hands so many times...

Thirdly, no matter what you read by Roger Ebert, the ending IS graphic and excessive. I'm not a prude and I think Tipper Gore is an idiot - but I did not need to see Chloe Sevigny give Vince full service. It doesn't serve the 'plot' either.

Lastly, once you see the ending (in which Vince Gallo's acting is a bit whiny and weak), the rest of the film makes sense and you ALMOST want to forgive it. You can ALMOST say that the movie has a point to it. Then you remember the agony that was the last hour and a half of your life and decide that you hate 'the Brown Bunny'.",1130457600,9,1561,4.409722222222222

I will not provide you with all of the boring details because it's been done so well by others reviewers, and I will not bore you in the same manner Gallo did me.  I am a writer though, and it pains me to slam on a man who supposedly put his heart and soul into his venture.  I can tell you that I've been writing a long time, and I have piles of material.  I have what I consider to be great, poor, and downright awful.  The awful pieces I've written are vanity stories in which all the women in the world love the man.  This is basically what Gallo has written.  Written, what did he really write?  This thing could've been condensed to a 20-30 minute short.  Gallo directed it, but what did he really direct?  My favorite part of this movie is reading how many others were as ticked off by this piece as I was.  I read a few who loved it. I read them, but I don't think any of them were convincing.  I even read a couple who said that this is the type of movie that they wanted to make.

2325609,5,B0009VRHLK,"This is an odd and haunting independent film, the brainchild of Vincent Gallo, who wrote it, directed it and stars in it.  He's saying something in this film, something that seems a bit distorted.  But he says it well and because of this, there is a discomfort in watching it.

This is the story of Bud Clay, who we meet as he loses a motorcycle race in New Hampshire.  He puts his motorcycle in is van and then takes off for California, where he is scheduled to participate in another motorcycle race.  We ride with him in that van, long stretches of roads through middle America.  And we also feel his pain about something although it takes a while for us to understand that he is obsessed with the loss of his true love, Daisy.  Mr. Gallo could be called a homely man.  His features are craggy and awkward, his nose looks misshapen.  But he has deep and sorrowful eyes and his fine acting makes his character seem real.

I understand the film has been cut from the original and now runs a mere 90 minutes or so.  This is good because even though there is not much action I was never bored as I watched this long journey.  Along the way he meets some women, but he just can't get over his love for Daisy.  And then, just as I thought that Daisy was a mirage and never existed at all, we meet her.  Chloe Sevigny plays this role and even though she is on screen for just a short time, she is wonderful.  There's a scene then that probably has caused this film to be banned in many places because it is extremely explicit and violates whatever censorship rules are usually in place.  And yet, it is sad and very real and necessary to the film.

How it all turns out is not pleasant as I realized that the whole film was a mix of reality and fantasy.  I will probably never forget it.  I thought it was a small piece of art even  though it is too weird for the average viewer.  Some will be bored.  Some will be disgusted.  And many will be sad.  So don't bother with this film unless you're prepared for something very different with an overtone of melancholy.  I therefore recommend it for only a few adventurous film buffs.",1128384000,7,2125,4.292191435768262
2325610,3,B0009VRHLK,"""The Brown Bunny"" is, in many ways, the antithesis of the American movie.  It is not loud, contains no explosions, nor is it marred by the quick-cut editing necessary to keep the attention of the MTV generation.  It is, however, guilty of the narcissism of Hollywood's ""high concept"" bore fests.  Gallo takes an effective short story and tries to stretch it into a novel.  Like Kubrick on morphine, Gallo drags us through pointless scenes that seemingly go on forever.  The DVD version is almost a half hour shorter than the version shown at Canne.  (I simply can't imagine staying conscious through the longer cut.)  The infamous final scene puts everything in perspective, but is so jarring to the viewer that is disengages us from the film.  The viewer is so caught up in wondering (a) is it real, (b) how did he convince Chloe to do the scene, (c) how was it shot, etc. that he/she is catapulted out of the film's hypnotic trance.  Thumbs up for Gallo and Chloe's willingness to push the boundaries and take chances in an industry prone to cookie-cutter standards.  Thumbs down for this Uneasy Rider that drowns in its own admiration.",1128124800,2,1138,4.730964467005077

2325612,1,B0009VRHLK,"Bud is sad.  The motor-cycle racer played by Vincent Gallo is carrying some sort of grief.  We know this because he spends a lot of time driving his van cross country and looking unhappy.  He conveys this unhappiness much of the time by rubbing his face in a way that demonstrates world-weariness.  Do we know WHY he's sad?  Nope, although we suspect pretty strongly it has to do with a girlfriend named Daisy.

If you want to see a movie about a sad man...here you go.  We see the sad man put gas in his van.  We see him purchase a cola at a roadside rest-stop...putting in about 8 coins.  We get to see him drink a bit of it.  We get to see him take his motorcycle out of his van and ride in on the salt flats in Utah.  We even get to see him use a urinal and at one point...take a shower!!  The whole shower we get to experience...and it includes a LOT of face rubbing and pausing to look contemplative.

My favorite scene involves Bud stopping at a little house in California.  He goes to the door and knocks on it.  He waits.  Knocks again.  Waits.  Looks in the window.  Waits.  The scene takes (no exaggeration) at least two minutes.  It tells us Bud can wait long past the time most of us would have given up.  That's how sad he is.

Finally, near the end, Bud checks in to a hotel and we're led to understand that he may be visited by Daisy.  Sure enough, she shows up and they have some dialogue (which is very exciting, because up until now we've had five minutes of dialogue stretched across 70 minutes of film).  The dialogue allows us to learn some things about their relationship, and then we are able to see them kiss a lot and then Daisy (Chloe Sevigny) explicitly performs a sex act on Bud.  It is graphic and not faked.  It is also distinctly unappealing, because Bud berates Daisy throughout the act.  When it's over, we get to finally find out what the ""secret"" Bud has been carrying around is. And the secret, when we understand it, is squalid, sad, and deeply uninteresting.

I hope you get some idea of the movie now before you run out to see it because you want to see two semi-well-known personalities engage in a sex act.  This curiosity factor aside, there is no GOOD reason to see the film.  It would only be to see for yourself just how bad a movie made by someone who actually knows how to make films can be.

Don't believe the reviewers who say their ten year old brothers could do the same.  It takes a REAL ego to actually make some of the stuff that's on this film.  There's a scene with a truly sad looking Cheryl Tiegs that nearly made me want to weep for her, because she is so dreadfully abused as a performer.  Her part mostly consists of looking sad and then kissing Vincent Gallo for minutes on end because apparently he's just so darn irresistible.  Don't believe the people who claim the film is saying something about male relationships with women and that it is some expose of how men really feel.  It is simply a movie about a guy who is sad and feeling guilty and having a hard time dealing with it.  Rather than tell us his story (except in the last 10 minutes) or reveal something about grief and how it can affect others, it simply shows how a person who is sad would actually look sad and move in a slow manner to suggest sadness.

It also shows a lot of boring countryside through a bug-splattered van window.  Minute after endless minute of that.

And Gallo himself is supremely annoying.  He has a singularly unappealing, whiny voice.  In an early scene, he is exhorting a convenience store clerk to go with him to California.  The dialogue is:  ""Go with me to California.""  Pause ""Please.""  Pause  ""Please.""  Pause ""Please Go With me!""  He says this while staring intensely at her...so naturally she agrees to immediately throw away her life to leave with this complete stranger.  And the great thing is this...his voice sounds like Alvin Chipmunk whispering.  Imagine yourself throwing your life away for that!!!

The Brown Bunny is nothing short of spendid.  As someone who deeply respects the works of very, very few directors alive today, I feel Vincent Gallo has proven, without a doubt, that he belongs in the ranks of the world's finest filmmakers.

Gallo understands fully that film has a transforming, transcendental effect when it is employed as a visual medium.  For those of us who have had relevatory experiences with film, for those who know what I mean when I say ""art is a religion"", the ranting and raving of critics like Ebert and the disdain of the uninformed are simply par for the course.

It's one of those movies that everything within was telling me wasn't good, but yet I felt there was some pretentious urban coffeeshop connoiseur in a tight retro t-shirt and coke bottle glasses somewhere sniveling at the ignorance of people like me for not understanding the genius of this film.

So I pondered it for a while and decided that, while there are certainly aspects to respect, in the over-simplified classification of good-or-bad, I still have to lean toward the bad.

When done well, excessively long, silent shots can work very well to subtly further a story or emotion while drawing the viewer into its rhythm. I cite ""Goodbye Dragon Inn"" as an example. While I appreciated the desperation and loneliness conveyed by the lingering shots in Bunny, after a while I felt as though they had nothing more to convey, and they worked to the detriment of their initial impact.

While I appreciated the twist of his ditching his first flower-named female while she was packing (preventing a predictable storyline to follow), as well as the inner turmoil evidenced throughout, I didn't ultimately feel as though the message of the movie was really profound enough to justify the plodding build-up to get to it - it didn't pay off for me.

And as for the sex stuff at the end, I can't really believe people still make a big deal about seeing that stuff. Someday maybe we'll get over it.",1126742400,9,1553,4.698529411764706
2325621,4,B0009VRHLK,"After the critical acclaim of Buffalo '66, there was a certain amount of anticipation for what its writer/director/star Vincent Gallo would do next. He responded with The Brown Bunny, a film that, to put it mildly, polarized critics and audiences at the Cannes Film Festival. It met with harsh criticism and cited by some as the worst film ever to be shown in competition. This was largely in response to the film's notorious ending with co-star Chloe Sevigny and Gallo that outraged many. The film's deliberately slow pacing also didn't endear it to audiences. Gallo, not one to back down from a fight, engaged Roger Ebert in a highly publicized war of words that got quite nasty. Now that the dust has settled and the film has been quietly released on DVD, people can see for themselves what the fuss was all about.

Stylistically, Gallo favours long, static takes, often holding on a shot for as long as he feels is necessary. In some respects, it's a throwback to the minimalist cinema of Monte Hellman, specifically Two-Lane Blacktop with its judicious use of dialogue and no frills production values. Gallo certainly has an ear for the right piece of music for the right scene, like the sad, wistful music of Gordon Lightfoot (""Beautiful"") and Jackson C. Frank (""Milk & Honey"") playing over shots of the road to create a particular mood.

It would be so easy to dismiss Gallo's film as a vanity project run amok. After all, he wrote, directed, edited, produced, shot and stars in it. The Brown Bunny lacks Buffalo '66's humour and this seems to be a conscious decision on Gallo's part. In every respect, this movie is the antithesis to anything Hollywood is producing. Like Gus Van Sant's Gerry, Gallo's film is a cinematic endurance test-can you watch a man drive around for close to 90 minutes with the occasional interaction with other people? Yet, there is a certain poetry to The Brown Bunny, a certain simple beauty in observing every day things, like someone eating dinner or shopping for a rabbit or just driving cross-country.

The movie works best as a road trip film.  I enjoyed going across the country with Vincent in his van.

When it came time for various characters to sit around talking to each other, I started to tune out.  None of the characters were nearly as interesting as the American landscape as seen from Vincent's van windows.  Yet the only dialog scene that brought the movie to a dead stop was the scene with the grandparents (and the title bunny).  It actually took awhile for me to get back into the movie after an eternity of sitting around the kitchen table with these elderly people who had nothing to say.  I wish this scene had been cut out entirely, or at least trimmed to a quarter of it's current length.

I did enjoy the interaction with Daisy at the end of the movie.  And the controversial oral sex scene did not disrupt the film for me... it just seemed like what those two characters would do at that point in the story.  It did not de-rail the film and it was refreshingly honest.

Though not really pulled off with a lot of filmmaking expertise, I did like what the final (flashback) scenes of THE BROWN BUNNY were trying to say.

Gallo's DIY filmmaking is wonderfully daring, but I wish he would let others in on the process from time to time.  I appreciate the freedom he has as an artist, but perhaps surrounding himself with more crew would add more quality to his film.  It is hard to get past the many out-of-focus and poorly framed shots in THE BROWN BUNNY.

2325627,1,B0009VRHLK,"Two actors in ""The Brown Bunny"" may not survive the ordeal, so be warned: career suicide is never pleasant. Chloe Sevigny actually has a career, appearing in such films as ""Boys Don't Cry,"" ""American Psycho,"" ""Dogville"" and ""Shattered Glass."" She's now with Bill Murray in the indie ""Broken Flowers"" (2005), so she may have a chance. As for that ill-tempered rebel bad boy Vincent Gallo, he's solely to blame for the infinite boredom of this film. He's its star, director, writer, producer, editor, publicist and photographer.

Gallo's adroitly cast 1998 indie ""Buffalo 66"" stirred some interest, but only that. Previously he had bits in a good film (""Goodfellas""), a bad one (""The House of the Spirits""), and a dozen you never heard of; he's now got three in the pipeline you also may never hear of. In any organized effort, after ""The Brown Bunny"" we never would expect to hear from him again. But independent moviemaking is disorganized. Anything can happen. And although nothing happens in ""The Brown Bunny,"" Gallo might yet resurrect himself.

It's about a moody motorcycle racer driving a minivan to California. He's moody because of a life-traumatizing episode we learn about at the very end. Until then, he drives across America, rain or shine, on freeways and through towns. That's it. Sleeping, showering, pumping gas, buying Cokes or take-out, chatting with stray women, these are major events in this movie. In a motel room, Sevigny performs oral sex on him, a gratuitous but explicit act (no faking here) that is the film's real reason for existing and it's only excitement.

And also its only suspense. Will the self-indulgent star of ""The Brown Bunny"" (how to phrase it?) rise to the occasion? Hey, it's cool. The writer, editor, publicist, photographer, producer and director all told him to stick to the script. I'm not making any of this up, you know.",1126137600,14,1869,4.964856230031949

You don't have to see it. Apart from an incredibly graphic oral sex scene, there really is nothing eye catching about the film. The only thing I got from the film was that the people involved had to be incredibly STONED in order to do the things on film that they did (Chloe Sevigny, what were you thinking?).

I'm not gonna waste too much time with a rambling review because enough of my time was wasted on this film about a guy who is driving across country trying to forget his girlfriend.

The second he walked into a gas station and in an INCREDIBLY CREEPY way... asked the high school age girl if she would come with him cross country... twice he says... 'please' unblinking eyes, staring... 'please'.  It gave me the willies... and the willies weren't intended. In fact, the exact opposite is intended. He's supposed to be appealling.  In fact though, he is more APPALLING than anything.  What is more appalling is that the girl GOES WITH HIM!!

In fact, the creepy looking Vincent Gallo is apprently a chick magnet... even at truck stops.

Dear lord this movie was incredibly pointless and boring and would have been better if they had extended the porn theme across the entire film and released it as XXX.

The film seems to work no matter what ones feelings are for it. In a maze of films where people have their heads blown off every 10 seconds, THE BROWN BUNNY comes through cheap,fast and thought prevoking.

2325637,4,B0009VRHLK,"Another review below has made the point that the critics started a process whereby this film has become vilified.  I won't rehash that, but it's unfortunate.

Gallo certainly does test the limits of his audience and, as a result, this film will not have a wide audience.  But if you're someone who appreciates the power of cinema you may well find something to like in this film.  Gallo makes things difficult on himself by forcing the film to rely almost entirely on a visual language.  Gallo's character says almost nothing.  What we know about him is what we see: his appearance, his motorcycle, his van. What we see him doing is less important than what we *never* see him doing: he doesn't seem to have a job or any fixed responsibilities or schedule, and he's certainly short on human contact. From his relationship with his ex-girlfriend we learn that others see something of value in him that he himself can't.  But while he seems fully isolated from the world, he also seems universal.  In his isolation he is like each of us, and Gallo steadfastly refuses to give the character any more personality than is necessary, so as to avoid interfering with the character's universal quality.  I think what makes the film so unsettling to many is that Gallo's pointless odyssey is not so different than the one many of the rest of us are on.

As to whether it's the worst film ever made, well, that's not even remotely accurate.  It's true that The Brown Bunny won't do the tricks of a mainstream Hollywood film, but it is powerful in its own way and never hits a false note.  It is far more deft, controlled and virtuosic in its own way than, say, a mess of a film like ""Kingdom of Heaven."" It makes David Lynch look downright vaudevillian. With its echos of Bergman, Fassbinder, Wenders and Hellman it's quite an accomplished work.  (Those of you who can't agree with me should at least try the somewhat more communicative ""Buffalo 66"").",1124755200,7,1941,4.640350877192983
2325638,3,B0009VRHLK,"Gallo is in the driver's seat, literally. This film is an exercise in patience. All of the shots through-the-windshield were a bit tedious. But Gallo does what he can to make you a passenger on his long, lonely journey.

Sorry, no big explosions, witty one-liners, etc here. Instead, a man on a mission, a pilgrimage. Perhaps a second viewing with the realized ending in mind will effect you differently.

By all means, not the worst movie ever. Just extremely personal.

I still rank Buffalo '66 as my favorite Gallo film and one of my all-time favorites, period. If you haven't seen it, please do yourself a favor and give it the once over twice.

2325640,5,B0009VRHLK,"I lost a lot of respect for Roger Ebert for bashing this film the way he did. As Vincent Gallo himself has said, it was irresponsible of such an influential film critic to attach the ""worst movie ever"" stigma to a film like this. Sure, Ebert used the minor edits to this film as an opportunity to atone for his irresponsibility and make a complete about-face, but the damage was done by then. This film's reputation was damaged, very possibly beyond repair, forever. Now you have people attracted to the film just because they want to see a trainwreck; a lot of people who wouldn't normally have been inspired to see a film like this, who very likely wouldn't have understood it anyway, just wanting to laugh at and rip apart the alleged ""worst film in the history of the Cannes film festival."" A soulless Hollywood blockbuster type film can withstand that kind of criticism; a difficult, ""not for everyone"" indie film, especially one made by such a polarizing figure as Vincent Gallo, cannot. I've seen worse movies than 'The Brown Bunny'. I've never seen 'Gigli' or the '05 'Dukes of Hazzard' starring an all-star cast of master thespians like Johnny Knoxville, Stiffler from 'American Pie' and Jessica Simpson, but I strongly doubt this film is worse than either of them. It isn't even worse than 'The Dreamers', 'Elephant', 'Garden State' or most of the other bullcrap that gets praise in the indie film world today.

As for the film itself...it's nothing like what you've heard. Many people watched this film and saw a tedious excersize in narcissism, ""endless"" driving scenes, and finally, graphic oral sex. I saw a fascinating portrait of a broken man's confusion, complication, emotional immaturity, and his resultant misery and emptiness, set against some beautiful scenes of the American landscape. 'The Brown Bunny' is not for all tastes, but in no way is it among the worst films ever made. It's not even close. To me, this film stands as proof of three things: first and foremost, Vincent Gallo is still a misunderstood genius (now more than ever); major film critics have incredible power when it comes to the reputation of independent film; and finally, people love to whine, complain and tear things down, and any time you give then an excuse to do so, they'll jump all over it. If you can't take ""independent"" cinema that is truly unconventional and creative, go watch 'Garden State' or something. Everyone else should watch this film, try their best to forget the naysayers, and remember that many great films, music, and other pieces of art were misunderstood and written off upon their initial release because people weren't ready to understand or accept them. If you don't like it, you don't like it. But calling Vincent Gallo's 'The Brown Bunny' the worst movie ever? To paraphrase the man himself, ""save that for when they make 'Rocky 10' and put Nicole Ritchie in it.""",1124582400,12,2892,4.854251012145749

The best scene in the movie? The oral scene but it was totally blown to hell when the buy busts into tears and gets on the bed in a fetal position. If this is ""male sexuality"" at its best, then every guy in the world needs counseling along with everybody else that watched this p.o.s. movie.",1124582400,10,590,3.966386554621849
2325642,4,B0009VRHLK,"I used to work as a security guard in an art museum. I always enjoyed the days when I was assigned the modern and contemporary art galleries, not only because of my love for the art, but because I took great pleasure in overhearing the comments and conversations of patrons passing through.

What I gleaned from my time at the museum is that the average person doesn't like modern art because he doesn't know what to make of it. When one looks at a Mark Rothko or Ad Reinhart painting, it's meaning or intention is not immediately apparent. The viewer must actively search his feelings to understand what the art means to him, how it makes him feel, and only then can then he begin to understand the motivations the artist had to create the work in the first place.

And so it is with Vincent Gallo's latest film, ""The Brown Bunny."" For those looking for a film to give them everything, you'll be most disappointed. You may even be angered. But like last year's sublime, understated and underrated ""Elephant,"" ""The Brown Bunny"" rewards those viewers who are willing to invest themselves emotionally, to see themselves through Bud's eyes, to make his pain and loneliness and sorrow their own.

Rather than having much in common with other fictional films, ""The Brown Bunny"" easily recalls the band documentaries ""Instrument"" (about Washington D.C. indie stalwarts Fugazi) and ""Meeting People Is Easy"" (about Radiohead's recording of ""OK Computer"" and subsequent tour). Both documentaries share the bleaker side of being a band on the road, with lengthy passages of film shot from inside tour bus and van looking at passing scenery from one nameless highway after another.

I will admit I was expecting another ""Buffalo '66"" when I walked into the theatre. And for the first twenty minutes I was unsettled and bored as I struggled to check my preconceived notions of what I thought I'd be getting with what I was actually watching. Once I let my preconceptions go, I easily settled into the film's warmly unsettling and emotionally frail fabric. Leaving the theatre, I felt that the cross-country journey, and the pain and saddness suffered along the way, had been my own.

""The Brown Bunny"" is the filmic equivalent of whatever album you love listening to with the headphones on, lying in the dark, wallowing in loathing and self-pity. Put yourself in that special place, and you'll find ""The Brown Bunny"" to be beautiful and tragic, refreshingly honest, and, above all, emotionally cathartic.",1124409600,9,2492,4.909738717339668

""The Brown Bunny"" is obviously not for everyone. It breaks the conventions of storytelling even by art house standards. But that does not make it a bad film; in fact I think it was a great film. Most of the complaints I've read on this film revolve around Gallo's inabilities to provide us with information about anything, especially about the main character Bud. This film is not about spoon feeding information to the viewer but rather, the viewer extracting information about Bud that is deliberately not provided to us by Gallo. It's not about what we see on screen but what we piece together about Bud's tormented life. This film interestingly enough solicits our attention and imagination as active film viewers rather than passive film viewers.

Ultimately, ""The Brown Bunny"" is about hanging on to imaginary things that do not exist. It is a metaphor about living in a make believe world rather than the ""real world.""

If you can put aside logic and plausibility for summer films then you can be patient and appreciate this film for what it is. But, if you're looking for a film with a regurgitated story line and spoon fed plot points then this film is obviously not for you.",1123545600,10,1244,4.723502304147465

2325649,5,B0009VRHLK,"Because Vincent is my friend, you'll think my opinion is biased, but now that that is out of the way, here goes...

Vincent said to me one day, ""Bunny, I'd like to make a movie about you."", and I said ""Sure. As long as it has absolutely nothing to do with me, and so long as it has lots of aliens, a carnival scene, killer special effects using monster trucks, and a few people eating cereal.""

But it didn't turn out that way, such is life. The only suggestion of mine that I demanded be included in the film was the monster truck stuff. But instead, Vincent had motorcycles. But that was OK because he can ride em' pretty well.

Anyways, now that I have established my credibility, on to the movie review. I never actually saw the film. I just know a lot about it, because Vincent and I spoke about it all the time over tea in the afternoons.

He assured my it was a great film but had his doubts. I believed him because he was so sincere and he also spent hours and hours designing the posters and all. Besides, why would someone go through all the trouble picking out the perfect colour for a poster for a film that was like, not great in the first place?

Between filming, we watched a few episodes of Twilight Zone, and we liked some of the songs in one of them, so he included it in the film. I'm not sure, but I think the character in The Brown Bunny had some similar struggles with the particular character in the Twilight Zone episode.

So if you like Twilight Zone episodes, I have no idea whether or not you'd like The Brown Bunny or not, because people can be so wishy-washy all the time. This guy likes Planet of the Apes and Seinfeld, while that gal likes The King and I and Soilent Green.

We find out this is his way of escaping reality- and the film is experimental in the way the scenes drone on- because it wants you to be enveloped in the same way he is- without thinking of anything else- just washing your thoughts away. The film is interactive in that sense.

2325651,5,B0009VRHLK,"kubrick says, ""One man writes a novel, one man composes a symphony, and one man directs a film"". Of course Gallo obviously embraces this point of view, but the motivation is not about narcissism. Kubrick gave himself up for what he loved didn't he? Its about personalism, honesty, and being bold without compromise. What Gallo does here can be appreciated on many levels, and at the same lacks all pretension. The superficial metaphors and 'juxaposition' that film school tries to celebrate as 'expression' cannot be located in his work. Don't get me wrong, theres plenty of ambiguity and poetic visions throughout the film, but isn't it nice to be 'left alone' by a film as opposed to being taken hostage like most of modern cinema. The generosity of the style and the temporal narrative, the emergent quality of the films composition and music, and subtle performances.. If you haven't noticed, American cinema has been largely uninteresting in recent times, and because of our nostalgia for past works, the filmmakers have no insight that warrants singular, let alone repeated viewings. This film is 'open' in the philosophical sense, for speculation and discourse, and can shed light on the behaviors we exhibit in times of pain and terror. Of course Gallos aesthetic sensibility has been cultivated in such a way, that he goes to his subject with the eye of a child, in the best sense, and shows us a reality that we could normally miss. 'Time', 'future', finitude', 'attachment', all work at once in our everyday existence, just as he presents, and doesnt always come in totally unique and extreme scenerios.  Now isn't this kind of reflection, posed by an avid intellect, what film is all about.  Here Gallo only does what every heavyweight director has done, which is to introduce an artistic language that has only existed in other mediums up to that point, to stretch the possibilities. Minimalism his obvious choice. Much has been said about the explicit scene, and the question of its neccessity. Film is about IMPACT, it always has been, the nature of the shot gives it its psychological power, and leaves the viewer having to take a look in the mirror at his or her own sexual practices and the pathologies behind them. Of course you could have an Oliver Stone inferiority complex with added penis envies to boot and hate the the personality of the filmmaker, but the film itself, is still very special...",1118534400,12,2419,4.897560975609756
