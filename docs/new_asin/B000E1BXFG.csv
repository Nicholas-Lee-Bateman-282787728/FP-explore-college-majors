2478732,3,B000E1BXFG,"Let me be frank here, I'm not dogging the film really, it's just, it was EXTREMELY CHEESEY, which makes it great in a sense.  And I love all 'Zilla flicks to include ""Rodan"", ""Mothra"", this one and whatever else Toho did.  But this costume was really bad.  His eyes were as blank as a piece of printer paper, and his posture had me literally laughing out loud.  One scene in particular stands out.  When he comes out of the cave and looks up at an airplane or chopper I think.

Also, he seemed a bit smaller than in Godzilla vs. King Kong.  The scale-job done on this is pretty pitiful, which again makes it even more fun to watch I guess because you can't take this movie seriously like you would ""Green Mile"" ""Schindler's List"" or ""Silence of the Lambs"".  I recommend this because I think anyone's kids would love this, as I did growing up watching all of the Godzilla flicks or just an old fan like myself.

It is better entertainment than the newest installment done by Peter Jackson and maybe more entertaining than the 1933 version simply because it is a bit slow and depressing by the end of it.  I do sort of have a closet liking to the 1976 version the best of all King Kong movies. This might be a distant second or third.  I own it, so should you if you like the old Godzilla movies from the 50's, 60's, and 70's.",1174953600,2,1324,4.27710843373494
2478733,4,B000E1BXFG,"What else can be said about this kiddie kaiju flick? I actually first saw this IN THE THEATER at the age of 6 when it was released.

This explains so much.

Ah, to go back to the days when having a decent plot, acting and effects didn't really matter ...as long as it filled seats.

In that regard, not much has changed about the movie business, but seeing this again brought back primal childhood memories. Kingukongu no gyakushu (King Kong Escapes) features what is possibly the worst gorilla suit made by man, which is why this didn't scare me in 1968. You just knew it was fake. In fact, that is much of the charm.

Just the little things takes me back: The unspeakable cuteness of Linda Miller, and her badly dubbed voice. The horrific lower dental work of Eisei Amamoto and his voice dubbed by Paul Frees (yep, the same guy who voiced Boris from the Bullwinkle cartoons). The classic monster movie riffs of Akira Ifukube. The fact that the lone native on the island takes three shots to the chest at point blank range and survives long enough for the good guys to arrive (possibly weeks later) so he can give an extremely vague description of the villain.  (""What's that, Lassie?  It was Dr. Who?"")

This is one of those flicks that it is so baaaad ...it's good.",1168473600,3,1268,4.48695652173913
2478734,5,B000E1BXFG,"This was a staple of Saturday afternoon monster flicks that aired in the pre-cable days of UHF TV.  Haven't seen it in decades - and true to 60's Toho form, it's just as colorful, fun, entertaining, and silly as I remember.  As a Toho/Rankin-Bass co-production, released through Universal, it has probably the highest production values of any film in the heyday of Japanese sci-fi/fantasy, the 1960's.  The dollars went into impressive arctic sets and assorted miniatures, which are larger and more realistic than usual. Especially impressive is the submarine miniature, the tower where the climatic battle takes place, and the aircraft carrier that Kong smashes at the end of the film. The glowing frozen tunnel where Kong and his robot counterpart mine ""Element X"" is also visually evocative and memorable. This film also has a fair number of composite shots, some more successful than others. A great one is Kong snatching Linda Miller out of the water as she tries to swim to the sub.

Unlike some other US/Japanese co-productions, the American actors are part of the cast, rather than inserted, often clunkily, later - ala Raymond Burr in Godzilla.  The scope of the sets and international cast gives the film a semi-epic feel. It should be noted that this was also scored by Akira Ifukube, who never fails to deliver a memorable theme. The distinctly morse-code Mechakong theme I remember vividly since seeing this film as a kid.

If you're familiar with this film, the knock on it is the Kong suit. Yes, it's weird, silly, not even remotely realistic... My take is that this film was intended as a live-action version of the animated Rankin-Bass Kong series, and this Kong was designed around the animated Kong from the cartoon. In fact, the Dr Who (no relation to the british sci-fi series) character in the movie - complete with cape, long gray villianous locks, is  the cartoon's main villian. Perhaps the ties between this film and the animated series were intended to be closer than one realises 40 years after the film and animated series was aired. This would explain those absurd oversized cartoon eyes on the beast. He was designed around the animated character of the cartoon series, hence Kong looks more ""cartoony"" than real. Then again, it could be that the Toho monster suit makers just suck at making ape suits. Dinosaurs, dragons, giant robots? No problemo. Anthing but a giant ape. Perhaps this is why they decided to use Godzilla instead of Kong in Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster. It finally dawned on Toho that ape costumes weren't a forte, and they decided to stick to their core concentration.

So, why did I title my review, ""The Best Kong, Ever?"". While I'm sure nobody will agree...

1. King Kong (1933). Classic, yes. But long, talky, dated (sorry, it is), takes too long to get going, plus we all know the ending.
2. Son of Kong - forgetable follow-up to the original, despite great FX work.
3. Godzilla vs King Kong - Really a Godzilla movie with Kong as the kaiju dujior.
4. King Kong Escapes - Old but not dated. Still a fun, vivid, colorful and most of all entertaining Kong adventure from the heyday of Toho-style Kaiju Eiga with what might be the most novel and exciting monster battle Toho ever staged on the Tokyo tower.
4. King Kong (1976) As dated today as the 1933 original, and mostly an insincere excersize in blockbuster hype than a genuine movie
5. King Kong Lives - yeah, right...
6. Kong Kong (2005) - Overblown, overrated, over-long, overbudgeted, over-hyped, over-serious, dated upon release, excessive in every way but  NOT fun in any way 2005-style CGI-fest ego trip from Peter Jackson.

Fourty years later, I can still get a kick our of King Kong Escapes. Not sure I can say that (and some I definately can't) about any of the other Kong flicks. Though not without faults, it's the best by default. It's just fun, and has a certain charm about it which is utterly absent in most of the others.",1165881600,13,3946,4.771260997067449
2478735,4,B000E1BXFG,"Just as Rankin & Bass had tackled Tolkien before Jackson did, they also did a King Kong movie.  Once again we have a remote island where Kong lives.  He also meets a blonde beauty and falls in love.  But this version has more.  We have an evil villain who has constructed a giant robot Kong to aid him in his schemes.  But the villain, Dr. Hu, discovers that the real Kong would work even better.

Now add some gorilla mind control, suitmation, miniature sets, and titanic battles between giants and you get an unforgettable epic (even if you want to forget it).  The result is a film that fits somewhere between the original and a Godzilla film.  Visually speaking the film is pure Godzilla-style and a credit to the Kaiju films of its day.  While not as polished as some modern Kaiju films no Kaiju library should be without one.  The dubbed dialogue actually adds to some of the fun as the villain gloats and compares the two Kongs.  Check it out.",1161043200,16,950,4.465116279069767

Friendly in this his previous adventure romp with Godzilla. Rediscovered by a submarine team on mondo island kong is soon shanghied by the evil
Dr. Who to dig up a lethal power source (element x) and fight a giant robot kong to boot. If the plot sounds like that of ""King Kong"" cartoon series of the same era you wouldn't be far off.

2478767,3,B000E1BXFG,"A typical mad scientist, with the unfortunate name of Dr. Who (Eisei Amamoto), needs someone or something to dig Element X for him but its radioactive.  So he builds a ginormous, too cute for words, robot but the metal contraption breaks down, its brain circuits fried by radiation.  Why not get the real Kong to do the digging?  Easier said than done, Kong isn't willing but he is easily drugged and hoisted onto a waiting vessel for a quick trip to the North Pole.  Unfortunately for the mad scientist, Kong has friends who are willing to risk life and limb to save the ape and thwart the evil plans of Dr. Who.

It is painfully obvious that this movie was made especially for children; the concept was provided by Rankin/Bass (of Frosty the Snowman fame).  The story is basic and familiar, with model Linda Miller as Lt. Susan, acting as Kongs love interest (like Fay Wray before her).  Her kewpie doll voice was provided by someone else, she was furious with Rankin for not allowing her to do her own voice work.  It is also unfortunate that Paul Frees famous cartoon voice was used for Dr. Who.  The dialog is hopeless enough without that too familiar voice trying to sound villainous and not succeeding.",1463875200,2,1209,4.61214953271028

2478772,4,B000E1BXFG,"Silly, fun mid-60's Japanese-made, English-dubbed sci-fi dumbness.  Dr. Hu (or Who) finds an element (Element X) that can fuel a super-bomb and plans to make a bundle from it.  He's financed by a secret government (apparently not the Yanks or the Russians) and a representative named Madame X, with her Jackie Kennedy wardrobe and looking like a particularly clean-cut prom queen, protects her government's investment by riding herd on the bad doctor.  Hu invents a giant robot that looks like King Kong to mine the ore.  The radiation from the mineral takes all the oomph out of the 'bot so Hu decides to jack the giant great ape to do the mining dirty work, figuring Kong will withstand the rads a tad longer.  Hu goes after the UN crew of a sub who have sort of befriended Kong because the ship's nurse is a cute, pert blonde who has awakened Kong's gentler, loving instincts.  When Kong won't co-operate Hu sets Mecha-Kong against him, they start hammering each other with their fists and suddenly it's trash-Tokyo-time.  Tons of goofy fun.  The Kong suit is particularly ratty, the face is immobile, the mouth is full of piranha-like fangs, and the plastic-looking eyes look like they have cataracts. On top of that the guy in the ape suit walks on all twos.  Never does he go on all fours.  A million miles and years away from Kong's glory days.  Highly entertaining and certainly not to be taken seriously.  The movie's picture is clear and the color is great, like most Japanese sci-fi and fantasy films of that era.  The Universal DVD is excellent quality.  Highly recommended.",1452988800,,1586,4.761904761904762

2478812,5,B000E1BXFG,"King Kong Escapes was not, as you might expect, based on the original King Kong (1933) or the popular King Kong vs. Godzilla, which I think still ranks, adjusted for inflation, as the most profitable Godzilla movie in the franchise. No, this movie was based on the cartoon series The King Kong Show, which hit American small screens between 1966-1969. It, like the movie, was produced by Rankin/Bass, which is perhaps better remembered for the many stop-motion animated holiday TV specials they produced, including Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, The Year Without a Santa Claus, and the movie Mad Monster Party.  This was a co-production between the company and Toho Studios, much like The Green Slime and The Last Dinosaur.

Most people look at King Kong Escapes as probably the worst Kong movie every made. And mainly they're looking at that atrocious gorilla suit. Much like the aforementioned KK vs. G, there wasn't a lot of money spent on the primate star of the movie. Even Bob Burns legendary and somewhat ratty suit wouldve looked better on screen then the plasticine-faced monstrosity we were shown. You can see seams a-plenty, flaccid lower arm extensions that often make it look like Kong has two elbow joints, and a flap on the back of the head that has a tendency to flutter when the hero gets tossed around too much.

But if you discount that suit, this is actually not a bad movie. The special effects are really top notch for a G-rated movie, the sort directed at kids  its head-over-heels better then most of Daieis Gamera output of the same era. The miniatures, for the most part, are as good in any of the good Godzilla movies, and even the green screen work is exemplary.

This film was the first appearance of the monster that would later become known as Gorosaurus. Hes pretty much just a dinosaur, though with a kangaroo-like predilection for jumping and kicking opponents. The suit is one of the best dinosaur presentations of the pre-CGI era, and looks really good.

The acting is hammy and on a kids level. Dr. Who, played by Eisei Anamoto, is dubbed by the inimitable Paul Frees, star of many dubbed kaiju flicks over the century. Rhodes Reason stars as UN Commander Carl Nelson,  and does a good job as the square-chinned male lead. He appeared in an episode of Star Trek and in a barn full of action oaters. He was the younger, nearly identical brother of Rex Reason, perhaps best remembered for This Island Earth.  Linda Miller was a model who worked in Japan, and this was one of only two movies she appeared in (the other was The Green Slime). Shes pretty, but really dull as a performer. Akira Takarada portrays the other male lead, who appeared in loads of kaiju flicks for Toho. The sultry Madame X was Mie Hama, who appeared in numerous Japanese films and hit international shores in the James Bond vehicle You Only Live Twice and the dubbed Woody Allen film Whats Up, Tiger Lily?

I know the film kept me rapt when I saw it on the CBS Late Night Movie back in the seventies.  Its just a fun little monster flick. The highlight of the movie was the Robot Kong that Who created from Nelsons plans. When I first saw the movie, I was amazed at how cool the robot looked, and the opening sequence where Robot Kong attempts to uncover the Element X deposit was spellbinding on a 9-inch black-and-white set. Yeah, I was easy to please back then. Oh, and while every source seems to note this, the robot was never called MechaniKong, no matter how cool that name might sound.

The Blu ray DVD of King Kong Escapes was put out by Universal Studios in 2014. The print they use of the film is pretty good  at least I didn't notice a lot of film scratches, and I didn't see any pixelation or any problems with the playback. The disc is barebones, having only a commercial for Ultraviolet (which, naturally, doesnt cover THIS movie), and nothing else. No trailers, no behind-the-scenesnot even a menu. But with Amazon Prime, it only case me $8.99, so it wasn't a big loss or expenditure either way.

I love monster movies, and this one is no exception. Many people will grind it down for the Kong outfit, but any viewing that chooses to go beyond that will see a fun, kinda goofy movie, with some otherwise pretty good production values. Definitely something every kaiju fan should see.",1425686400,8,4310,4.63302752293578

2478824,5,B000E1BXFG,"Just finished watching ""King Kong Escapes"" released by Universal.
Nothing pays a writer more homage like when other writers steal from him; and in ""King Kong Escapes"" the stealing, why is as colossal as the great ape himself.  How Universal avoided a LAWSUIT from when this movie was first released is beyond me...however SPOILERS AHEAD:
Doctor Who - that's right fanboys, a cape wearing Japanese Doctor Who modeling himself after Jon Pertwee's Third Doctor is busy constructing a 60-foot tall King Kong Robot to mine tons of Element X which will make country sponsoring his ""research"" the world's lone superpower.  Unfortunately for Doctor Who, his giant robot can't function in the presence of Element X, so he needs to finds the living King Kong
Madame X, not from the tear jerker movie of the same name, isn't amused by the mechanical failure of Doctor Who's evil robot.  Fortunately for Doctor Who, Commander Nelson and his submarine crew - seems in the movie Admirial Nelson of the SeaView from Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea - got a demontion - have to seek port in the harbor of the island where King Kong lives.
Hoping to see the living giant ape for themselves, Nelson, and his second in command, Lt. Commander Jiro Nomura,and lovely blonde haired nurse Lt. Susan Miller - yep Doctor Who fans, the heroine's name is Susan - head out to the island in a hover car much like the SeaView's flying submarine.
Naturally, King Kong rescues Susan from a giant dinosaur; and when Nelson, Jiro, and Susan make their report to the U.N. Science Council, Doctor Who sets into motion plans to kidnap King Kong and Susan so that he can mine Element X and get paid millions of dollars.
Of specail note in this movie is the romance between Jiro and Susan - a first for its time in science-fiction/fantasy movies, if I'm not mistaken.
""King Kong Escapes"" is a perfect Saturday Matinee Movie.  It never takes itself too seriously and it's great fun.
It's a shame that a sequel was never filmed.  It would have been fun to see Nelson, Jiro, and Susan on another adventure; but perhaps the threat of two lawsuits had put an end to any sequel, if one had ever been envisioned.
Highly Recommended!

I was 9 or 10 at the time. It aired on WOR channel nine in New York on a Saturday afternoon, and I never forgot it. It had everything, King Kong, Mechanical Kong, a real bastard of a bad guy, good guys, a real good heroine who got Kong's affection. It also has good acting, great special effects, and great fight scenes. And last but not least, it has ""Heart"". You will find yourself cheering Kong, the good guys, the heroine, and booing the bad guys. As far as the blu-ray quality goes, I was very pleased with the transfer. There are still a few light scratches here and there. But overall the picture is very clean. Slightly grainy, but still clean and clear, and full of nice details that I never noticed before. Very good 2.0 mono also. No sound distortions that I could notice. There are no extra's here, but for the price and just to have this in my collection, makes it worth it.

2478916,4,B000E1BXFG,"BOTTOM LINE: If you're a fan of King Kong, dinosaurs or old school sci-fi and adventure, then this flick is an easy recommendation. Forget what you know of Kong from the '33 & '76 films and just go with the flow. This is grand silly fun in the classic Japanese giant monster tradition! An entertaining 5 STAR film, (but I subtracted 1 STAR due to this Blu-ray having no extras). >Boo!<

THE STORY: A team of U.N. scientists head to remote Mondo Island via submarine to investigate the rumors of the colossal ape monster known as King Kong. They encounter Kong and witness his might as he battles the beastly dino-terror: Gorosaurus! (Watch out for that devastating kangaroo kick, Kong!) Shortly after the U.N sub departs, Kong is ape-napped by nefarious international criminal, Dr. Who, (No! not THAT Doctor Who, silly!!). Seems that Who constructed a full-size robotic replica of Kong in order to unearth an ultra-rare radioactive isotope known as Element X. When Element X unexpectedly shorts out Mechani-Kong's controls, the evil Who is forced to steal the real Kong from Mondo Island to finish the job. Our U.N. heroes race to stop Dr. Who and rescue Kong. Can King Kong survive exposure to deadly Element X? How will our heroes save him? When Kong is pitted against his mighty mechanical twin who will emerge victorious? And what can stop Who? I don't know. (Third base!) Don't think about all this too much folks, just pick up a copy of this colorful adventure and find out for yourself!

THOUGHTS: One of Toho's more fun and interesting films. It certainly adds plenty of new wrinkles to the lore & legacy of King Kong. Although many don't know it, the plot of this film is based around the animated 1966 Kong TV show (available on DVD). There are some typically groovy Toho monsters (Gorosaurus and Mechani-Kong rule!), for our hairy hero to duke it out with, and a double dose of American star power, in the form of stiff leading man Rhodes Reason & go-go girl gorgeous Linda Miller. (Yes, Kong still has a weakness for blondes.) Sturdy supporting roles from several Toho regulars, with a special call out to  Eisei Amamoto (in a wild zebra-striped wig & requisite black cape), as the villainous, skeleton-thin Dr. Who, (with a bizarre bass voice-over from legendary Paul Frees that, despite the visual/audio juxtaposition, somehow just works). KING KONG ESCAPES is a breezy 96 minute adventure that's suitable viewing for the entire family.

THE BLU-RAY: When I saw that KKE was being remastered for Blu-ray and knew I had to upgrade. And it's worth it! The transfer is beautiful. Picture is rich, with vibrant colors & sharp focus. (Not as sharp as new movies, but pretty spiffy looking for a Japanese giant monster film that's 45+ years old.) Minimal artifacting, pixelation & crush, thankfully. Film's soundmix is equally clear & strong. (I usually have my TV volume set about halfway, but had to dial it down to 1/3 here to keep from being deafened! LOL.) Please note, this release only includes the American version of the film. Sadly, the original Japanese version w/English subtitles is NOT included. English dubtitles for the deaf or hearing impaired are included, and it also has subtitles in French. KING KONG ESCAPES comes highly recommended!",1397001600,7,3263,4.863309352517986
2478917,4,B000E1BXFG,"The final collaboration between director Ishiro Honda and his longtimecinematographer Hajime Koizumi, and one of the last partnerships between Honda and his special effects supervisor Eiji Tsuburaya, ""King Kong Escapes"" was one of the director's more appealing efforts.
Kong is somewhat better served than he was in his earlier Toho effort ""King Kong vs. Godzilla,"" and this story is fast-paced with interesting characters and is fun to watch.
MechaniKong was the forerunner of the future MechaGodzilla and the battle between Kong and his mechanical double on the Tokyo Tower is a Japanese fantasy film highpoint (another highpoint is Akira Ifukube's stirring and occasionally moviing score).
In glorious color from a pristine print, this release could have benefitted from some special features, but all-in-all is a wonderfully entertaining film and well-worth a purchase marking as it does one of the last fine films from Toho's Golden Age of Monster Movies.

2478920,4,B000E1BXFG,"This movie is a hoot. The miniatures are BEAUTIFUL in this film - the shot of Mechani-Kong rising up out of the hangar is almost breathtaking. The shot of Mechani-Kong standing at the edge of the ice as Kong swims away, while a helicopter approaches on his right, is. (that shot always makes me think of a Mechani-Kong voice over: ""Come back!...he'll never know how I really felt about him"" which makes me laugh popcorn out my nose).

Other highlights:

*The tops of Linda Miller's stockings! AAAGGHH  AAAAAAAAGGGHHHHHHHH
*Mechani-Kong HEADBUTTS KK. Wonderful. Far too short a monster rumble, but one of the all-time best moves.
*The logic behind the building of Mechani-Kong.
*The idea that if some guy draws a picture of a giant gorilla, and then you turn that drawing into a FUNCTIONING STEEL ROBOTIC COLOSSUS, that that is somehow stealing.
*Everything about Dr. Who.
*A supervillain junk drawer? With a corncob pipe?! This is the scene that blows my mind the most. Seriously, pause this shot when it happens. Does Dr. Who smoke a corncob pipe? Then who does? Madam X?

In a way, KKE makes me a bit sad. We have in KKE an example of What Could Be: a showa-era kaiju eiga with (comparatively, at least) superb production values, an international cast, an engaging script, yet without any pretensions. In some* ways, it's the equal of Mothra vs. Godzilla, IMO. I'm ignorant as to the actual production schedule, but am I right in assuming they had longer to work on this one? It just feels as though they took their time with it. It makes LZ's squandered potential more poignant.

Pop this one in your player ""any day, anytime"" (I just quoted the movie, so you know this is a good review) for an Instant Saturday Afternoon.

I will not bother to buy a blu-ray with nothing but the English version. Not only because of the language, but also because the edits of the movies are very different from each other.

2478923,5,B000E1BXFG,"This April will see KING KONG ESCAPES and KING KONG VS. GODZILLA finally coming to Blu-ray, but in a release that could have been so much more.  In spite of the space available on a Blu-ray disc, not only are the films not being paired up as the obvious double feature (ala FORBIDDEN PLANET and INVISIBLE BOY), but they're not even being packaged together as a two disc set.  Each is being sold individually, no doubt to cash in on the interest generated by the upcoming new Godzilla film that will be hitting theaters.  And, like their DVD counterparts, there appear to be no extras...not even the trailers.  Fortunately other companies out there better understand both the fans and the format; May 13 will see Twilight Time releasing two other classic Sixties sci-fi movies: Gerry Anderson's THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO and THUNDERBIRD 6 as a double feature on Blu-ray.

On the plus side, the remastered film will look and sound better than ever, even when this was brand new and playing as part of a Saturday sci-fi matinee at the local cinema.  It's too bad Toho and Rankin & Bass didn't collaborate on more movies together.  (R&B teamed with Toho for this outing, inspired by their weekly Saturday morning Kong cartoon series in the Sixties.)  It's also too bad Toho couldn't have brought Kong back for another outing.  (GODZILLA VS. THE SEA MONSTER was originally slated to be a Kong film but, when the rights to the character couldn't be cleared, the project was reworked into a Godzilla vehicle.)",1391472000,,1496,4.767441860465116

An evil genius who goes by the name of Dr. Hu (or Who) wants to kidnapped the real King Kong when his robot Kong cannot secure Element X. When the devices fall off Kong's ears, Kong is no longer under Dr. Hu control and swim towards Japan. There King Kong and Mechni-Kong fight one another and duke it out on Tokyo Tower. You can guess how the rest of the movie ends. There are some similarity from the original King Kong. Both King Kong go ape over some blonde hot chick and both do battle with a giant lizard and kill them in the same fashion by splitting their jaws open. Finally this would be King Kong's last appearance in a Japanese film, though the ape suit would be used in some later films. If you like low budget Japanese monster films then King Kong Escapes is a good one to add towards your collection. King Kong Escapes gets an A+.

2478933,5,B000E1BXFG,"The Movie--This film, a co-release from Toho (Godzilla) and Rankin-Bass (Rudolph) is loosely (laughably) based on a King Kong cartoon from the 60's, featuring a mustache-twirling, scene-chewing villain named Dr Hu (no relation), a beautiful helpless, useless blonde. (!!! How does such an idiot get to be part of a SCIENCE team???) and two brawny heroes, one Caucasian, one Asian, so no one is left out. The plot is goofy and has more holes than a used Kleenex, but it's goofy fun. Kong is suitably destructive and adorable, falling for the unattainable girl as he does. Dr Hu is cacklingly entertaining, with his giant robot monkey out to (say it with me) RUUUUUUUUULE THE WORLD! It's Kong and the Good Guys to the rescue of poor planet Earth from the clutches of a madman., with good old kaiju-style wrasslin involved.
As a note for Toho fans, it marks the first appearance of Gorosaurus, who fights Kong early in the film. This is only notable, because, while the film does not seem to fit in Toho's psychotic continuity, Gorosaurus appears in Destroy All Monsters, this time fighting alongside Godzilla. Go figure.

Just thinking about the plot and trying to convey it here makes me laugh; and watching this film never gets old, as it has such a 'no holds barred' silliness about it that keeps the story moving, and the viewer engaged. The new DVD release is great; I had no idea just how impressive the look of the film was, as prior to buying it, the last time I saw this movie I was a kid, myself.

The complaints that people lodge about the film are rather misguided in many ways and there is some serious confusion that needs sorting out. The female lead (Linda Miller) was dubbed by another actress, so the complaints about her performance are a bit moot, as nobody ever seems to care when the voices do not fit in the Kung Fu movies, so why take a King Kong picture so seriously?

A note of importance is that this movie is NOT a sequel to King Kong Vs Godzilla.  In this movie, Kong is a myth discovered to be real, and being utilized by the villains to dig a mine system and/or tunnels.  I know, I know... but that's what they're doing to him when he is discovered.  So, I guess technically, he was discovered by others before being 'discovered'.  See what I mean.  Silly.  :-)

IF you are looking for high tech, CGI special effects, well then, you're years too early.  This is one of those Giant Monster movies that makes great use of big rubber costumes, swimming pool and desolate field battles, and beautifully scaled city-scapes.

WOR TV channel 9 and WPIX TV channel 11 would show weekend monster movies.

This stuff is very radioactive however, so Dr. Who(he he) builds a robot King Kong to dig it out.  Why you would bother to make a digging apparatus in the likeness of King Kong is beyond me.  It seems more like a waste of time than anything.  But Robot Kong isn't as effective as Who thought, and Who manages to kidnap the real King Kong instead.  Three Naval officers, one white, one Japanese, and one an attractive blond chick(of course), attempt to stop Dr. Who's evil plan and free King Kong.  It all ends with a King Kong/Robot Kong smackdown in the middle of Tokyo!

Okay, this isn't the greatest movie ever made. There are probably not lots of people who would put this film in their personal top ten or top 100 or even top 1000, but for me this film is just one heck of a good time.  The evil doctor was awesome.  The hero was obviously in it for the pay check and the heroine was there for...well, I'm not sure, but she was there.  She was the nurse on an atomic submarine crewed by all men.  Yeah, right.  Anyway, one of the things I found so great about this movie was the way our nurse, Susan, played by Linda Miller, delivered lines so horribly that I could not believe she was really a professional actress.  Then I found out that her voice has been dubbed for this version of the film.  I apologize to her for my bad thoughts about her acting.  The bottom line here is that KING KONG ESCAPES is not a threat to win any awards.  It's lame, cheesy and the script is ridiculous.  That's why I gave it 5 stars.

2478960,4,B000E1BXFG,"A Toho/Rankin-Bass co-production, King Kong Escapes offers an imaginative, engaging story, with some surprisingly good special effects, and a first-rate musical score by Akira Ifukube. This is the first and only movie to feature MechaniKong, one of Toho's most popular creations. With a few nods to the original Kong as well as the Rankin-Bass cartoon that spawned it, King Kong Escapes makes for some of the best escapist fun anyone can have at the movies.

As colorful and imaginative as it is ridiculous, King Kong Escapes is one of several films Toho co-produced with U.S. studios in the late 1960s to expand its international audience. Although the King Kong suit itself is awfully cuddly (meant to appeal to kids who enjoyed the Rankin-Bass King Kong cartoon), the big ape turns in an entertaining performance--falling head over heels for almost-actress Linda Miller, fighting the giant rubber dinosaur Gorosaurus, and wreaking havoc at the North Pole. The crowning grace of the movie, though, is MechaniKong, the simian's 60-foot metal counterpart, engineered by that international Judas, Dr. Who (played by Eisei Amamoto). Toho's special effects department went to town with King Kong Escapes; it's a beautifully photographed, very colorful movie with some highly impressive miniature work.

The American version presented here is virtually the same as the original Japanese; only a few minor differences exist between the two. This Universal DVD, though bereft of extras, offers such a beautiful widescreen print that I consider it an irresistible item. This is half of a two-fer from Universal, the other half being King Kong vs. Godzilla.",1265500800,6,1649,5.314176245210728

2478962,5,B000E1BXFG,"I have always been a fan of the older Toho films and this Kong epic is one of the most action packed and fun entries from the studio. It's hokey to say the least, but it does have a lot of charm for those who grew up with these pictures. The story basically retells the original Kong story, but with silly sub plots including the villainous Doctor Who(Hu) creating a robot Kong(MechaKong)! The film is truly hilarious and the dubbing only adds to the fun.

This film was produced by non other than Rankin & Bass which gives it a strange fantasy quality that only they could bring. Doctor Who's voice over dub was done by one of Rankin and Bass's favorite heavies from their animated Christmas specials, I can not think of his name, but when you hear that voice you will immediately think of those classic holiday specials.

I give this film 5 stars for its fun factor and because it is full of hysterical action sequences. If you're a fan of Godzilla and these types of films this is a real treat! My review is for the older release that was available in a two pack with King Kong VS Godzilla. I don't know if the newer edition has added anything to warrant buying it as I can not find any info about it. This is usually not a good sign and I suspect it to be the same DVD with a new cover.

This older DVD has a very clean DVD transfer and it is in widescreen, but there are no extras at all, not even a trailer! Buy the two pack and enjoy these are both really funny films!",1256774400,5,1475,4.186619718309859
2478963,5,B000E1BXFG,I love this movie as much as anyone does. But I see no indication this dvd is any different than the one that was released with King Kong Vs Godzilla as part of a two-pack a few years ago.,1246233600,,188,3.8461538461538463
2478964,4,B000E1BXFG,"I've been trawling through the very worst of the King Kong wannabe movies that the world has produced and I am glad to say that this one is a real hoot. It's lots of fun to watch if you don't take it seriously and just enjoy the silliness.

The plot is pretty daft to say the least. An evil genius called Dr Who has created a robot King Kong which he intends to put to work excavating a rare ore called ""Element X"", at the request of a mysterious ambassador from an unnamed ""certain country"", who is willing to pay hefty sums of money for it. At the same time, a UN submarine runs into trouble (I forget why) and the crew find themselves on a remote island called Mondo island, which just happens to be the home of the REAL King Kong. Dr Who finds all this out somehow (I forget that bit too) and decides to capture Kong to take over the digging work from the robot Kong who has somehow malfunctioned. It's then action all the way as the UN crew try to thwart the evil Dr Who and the two Kongs fight it out together over Tokyo.

Well as you can probably tell, the plot didn't make enough sense for me to remember the details, in fact it has massive holes in logic all over the place. But the fun comes from the big monkey antics of course, and there are plenty of these. You better realise up front that the King Kong you will see here is light years away from a realistic looking gorilla. With a big lumpy suit, an immobile plasticky looking head and seams showing all over the fur costume, this Kong is a laugh a minute. But I don't wish to completely insult him - despite his big glassy eyes (complete with papery eyelids that actually blink!) and fang filled mouth, this Kong actually has real character. I don't know why, but I found him a pleasure to watch in every scene. Certainly a hell of a lot better than the monkey mistakes in films like ""A*P*E"", ""The Mighty Gorga"", ""King Kong Lives"" or ""The Mighty Peking Man"" (oh yes, I've seen them all!), this might be down to the skills of the guy in the costume because as crazy as it sounds, I actually believed this Kong had a real personality. Albeit a dopey and easily confused one.

But anyway, lets move on to other highlights of the film. Sadly, ""King Kong Escapes"" does not even TRY to deviate from all the cliches that these wannabe films seem to keep re-using. Witness if you will, Kong saving the heroine from a T-Rex, placing her in a tree while he battles the monster, and killing it by pulling it's jaw apart. Watch as Kong scales a tall tower in the final, with the heroine, again perched precariously on the high ledge. I mean, come on! It really can't be that hard to think up something new!

The ridiculous script is what really annoyed me. Several times the heros are captured by Dr Who and imprisoned, then let go, then rounded up again, then left to escape, then chased again, while the mysterious ambassador from a  ""certain country"" swaps loyalties between Dr Who and the good guys but is left entirely free to do as she pleases in the Who compound, simply releasing our heros when she feels like it. In one crazy scene, the Who crew even leave the keys to the prisoners handcuffs lying on a table and the cell door wide open - convenient eh? The dialogue is also laughable - the dubbing doesn't help, and many of the lines that the actors are reading out are pure nonsense. And poor Linda Miller, who plays the heroine (and Kong's love interest, naturally) has the worst possible voice for a female lead, seemingly dubbed by Chuckie from ""Rugrats""!

But it all adds up to silly fun and certainly never gets boring. Even in the slightly duller moments you can marvel at Dr Who's disgusting brown, gappy teeth (can't evil genius's afford dentists?) and the kitsch 60's fashions (Linda Miller's outfits are pretty cool  - some submarine doctor's uniform that is!). I enjoyed this a lot and I think others will too.",1232582400,14,3888,4.384188626907074

8103781,5,B000E1BXFG,I know King Kong is an American monster but the Japanese really know how to work King Kong into their world. This was a really good King Kong monster movie done in the typical Japanese style. This is a great monster movie I wish they would have made more after this.
