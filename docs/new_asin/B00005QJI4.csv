7950597,5,B00005QJI4,"It is a pity that this DVD is out of stock. We have been fortunate in Australia in the fact that the whole series was shown twice over on free-to-air television. They are very hard to find , so, if you come across them anywhere, grab them, trust me, you and your children will like them. Some of the series are animated, others are filmed using articulated doll-like figurines.
I particularly like 'ELIJAH', because, along with the excellent animation, music from the oratorio 'ELIJAH' is used for dramatic effect. If you like the Welsh baritone Brynn Terfel you are in for a treat. The storylines in the series are true to the Bible
and contain profound theological truths. Check out their lastest release too, ""The Miracle Maker"".",1022457600,3,732,4.771653543307087
