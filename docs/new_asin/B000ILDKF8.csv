8146044,5,B000ILDKF8,They don't do movies like this any more. Ariane Mnouchkine and Philippe Caubre capture the saltimbanco spirit of Molire. Its a story about the roots of theatre and no-tech pure creativity. Don't think an equivalent has ever been done for Shakespeare.,1393545600,,250,5.121951219512195
8146045,1,B000ILDKF8,"I could not view this item, as it is not designed to be played on US DVD players! When I brought this matter to the attention of two Amazon representatives, they both seemed blithely unconcerned. Indeed, I note that the item is still available for sale on the Amazon site without a caveat of any kind.",1378252800,2,301,4.392857142857143
8146046,5,B000ILDKF8,"Several impressions from the viewing I had of this film 30 years ago.

As when in Japanese films, each frame sometimes seems composed by Hokusai, so each frame and scene in this seems composed by Vermeer. Exquisite lighting complements but never upstages the incredible direction.

From the scenes from Moliere's early childhood, through his fame which he puts aside to honor his inspirations in the commedia del arte troupe from his childhood, his intrigues in the court of Louis XIV, his surrender to old age and then his death, this is a monumental film. One scene comes to mind often of the powerful Cardinal Richelieu marching down a marble hallway trailing his ermine train, and turning right to go down a hallway to the right while his child attendants struggle to keep up with his speed to keep the train from picking up dirt from the marble floor....

I remember 30 years ago as if it were yesterday, emerging from a 6 hour showing (with an intermission half-way) and my girlfriend and I too moved to shout and to elated to weep, walking down the street, wordless....

This is a perfect argument against current copyright laws that do not protect artists and even stifle the display of their work while financiers in tall buildings argue about""ownership.""  Otherwise this would be on Netflix at least.  And it is a great argument likewise against the region codes that presume to stop piracy, but only stop good films and books from the international marketplace.

Art is made be artists; copyright laws are made by accountants and lawyers.",1329004800,8,1549,4.84469696969697
8146047,1,B000ILDKF8,"Be careful--the reviews may be for a different version of the DVD from what is being sold! And there are several product numbers with the same three reviews. Confusing!

Like the other reviewers, I've wanted to see this film again for such a long time! I studied enough French that I thought I could take a chance on a version without subtitles, as the other reviews describe. But the product description said there were subtitles! Great! I emailed one of the sellers and asked if what they were selling had subtitles. I got an automated response that said, in effect, ""sorry, we have so many DVDs we can not respond to questions about individual ones.""

Unfortunately the Amazon.com product description at the time I was shopping did not say that it would not play on standard US DVD players. Now it does.

But I also see that one of the sellers says it will play on computers! I'm not sure whether to take that chance or just send it back.",1319155200,2,941,4.523529411764706
8146048,3,B000ILDKF8,"The other commenter is correct -- this version is NTSC (compatible with USA televisions) but has NO English subtitles.  Very annoying because there is a version in PAL (compatible with British televisions) that DOES have English subtitles.  Since someone has done English subtitles, why aren't they on the NTSC version??  There is no reason why the NTSC version cannot have subtitles.  The manufacturers of this are losing a pretty big market for no logical reason.",1174176000,21,465,5.16
8146049,4,B000ILDKF8,"I was not paying attention when I ordered this movie, it is in French with no subtitles. I remember watching it as a child on PBS with subtitles. Am very sad I don't speak French but will watch it non the less!",1173744000,17,210,4.023809523809524
