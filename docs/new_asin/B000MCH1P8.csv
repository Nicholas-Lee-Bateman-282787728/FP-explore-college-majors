8621252,5,B000MCH1P8,"1988 Indian Television series in Hindi language, Mirza Ghalib was a huge success. The dialogue, acting, lyrics, and music made it a memorable series. Sri Naseerudin Shaw played the Ghalib part so well, certainly contributing to the popularity of the show. The ghazals and songs by Jagjit and Chitra Singh are historic. Later the series was available on DVD, with English subtitles.",1354492800,3,381,5.161290322580645
8621253,4,B000MCH1P8,"After having enjoyed the Jagjit Singh's music from this TV serial for many years, it was delightful to watch it come alive in this very well directed TV serial by Gulzar.  Naseeruddin Shah makes for a very credible Ghalib.  The English subtitles were helpful.  Highly recommended if you enjoy Ghazals - or poetry in general.",1185408000,,324,4.8545454545454545
