Dr Michael Wolf had more experiences in the field of ET's than most of us would only dream of.  All of this information should be in an open arena so there could be more acceptance in what is really going on.
Wake up World and stop being afraid.  There is so much to learn and understand.",1248134400,2,353,4.176470588235294
8208600,5,B000TCX6G4,"It amazes me to watch this rare and thorough interview with Dr Wolf. He bares his soul and is honest about how much the government is really hiding when it comes to UFOS and Aliens. Despite his credibility and credentials, people still choose to believe the old government explanations of swamp gas, misidentified aircraft and conspiracy theorists running around and making up information about UFOs. Well, I am here to tell you that Dr Wolf is the real deal and we had better listen to what he has to say. He's been right on so many things, so I believe he deserves the benefit of the doubt. When is the last time the government told you the truth about anything???",1242604800,,666,4.558333333333334
8208601,2,B000TCX6G4,"I just finished watching this. I've also read the subject's book, The Catchers of Heaven. The book was interesting but disjointed and hard to follow., the DVD is a long interview with Michael Wolf by someone who is... very simpatico with him. There are no probing questions here, no followup, no explain further. Well, what else is new in UFO stuff. heh. All of it is just too breathless by half and too coy to be much beyond frustrating. To everyone in the field I would say; be clear, no more coy, no more dancing around, just tell something useful or shut up.",1230249600,,562,4.466019417475728
8208602,5,B000TCX6G4,"The patronizing review of Charles Wright reveals far more about himself than it does about the late Dr Wolf. All free-thinking individuals know by now that this is not a world for Pollyanas. Those, like Dr Wolf, who suggest we have constructed a doomed and deceptive materialistic paradigm, are worth listening to.

Dr Wolf claimed to have been part of a government team that was specifically mandated to maintain public ignorance of things outside of the box. This makes him a ""nut"". Meanwhile the real perpetrators of delusion hide behind religious and pseudo-scientific doctrines that are recycled ad nauseum, with the net effect of prolonging human suffering and dim-wittedness. Charles Wright, consciously or otherwise, is merely another spokesman for our institutional brainwashers.",1214092800,6,788,5.459016393442623
