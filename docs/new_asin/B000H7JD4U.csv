2630890,1,B000H7JD4U,This was a defective product.  There was nothing on the dvd.  I tried playing the disc on at least 4 dvd players and nothing would play.  I returned the item and requested a refund.  I'm still waiting for my refund.  This is the first time this has happened with any item I've ordered from Amazon.  This incident will not prevent me from ordering with Amazon again.,1200182400,,365,4.454545454545454
2630891,4,B000H7JD4U,"I really enjoyed the Songs that John did by himself.  All the background singers and band members seemed to draw the attention away from his vocals.  I debated on whether to give it 3 stars or 4 and I finally decided on 4 because he sings so well and the lyrics stir you.  The Blu Ray edition looks beautiful in High Definition, and it sounds superb.  They did a good job packaging this DVD full of beautiful songs.  If you enjoyed hearing John Legend on CD or on the Radio, check out this Well edited, well shot film.",1187827200,6,518,4.244897959183674

8137448,3,B000H7JD4U,"More of the same, john is good, maybe even great at his craft but, he seems a little stuck in his limited style, so the DVD is less than riveting.",1428192000,,146,3.9

8137451,5,B000H7JD4U,Will not disappoint. Pop this in while you are chilling with your lady or potential lady. Let John Legend sing her panties off and then you do the rest. Song after song just a fantastic show.,1402704000,,191,4.333333333333333
8137452,5,B000H7JD4U,I'm a HUGE John Legend fan!! My husband & I keep our marriage alive by listening to his music on weekends. It's become a anthem for our marriage in a sense. We really loved that we were able to watch him perform the songs that we both knew so well. It certainly ignites a spark for us!!!,1395360000,,287,4.052631578947368

8137454,5,B000H7JD4U,I first heard John thro my boyfriend.  I listened to his cd and fell in love!!! not only with his royal hotness but his voice.  I then rented the dvd from my local library to make my boyfriend happy.  I am now purchasing the dvd for MYSELF!!  I just love it.  I am soooo impressed with his music and how diverse a fan base he has.  I just wish he would get more airplay on my local stations!!  John keep it up!  I love ya and your music touches me in a way I have felt in a long long time!!,1204675200,,490,3.782178217821782
8137455,5,B000H7JD4U,"The first reviewer who gave this disc one star because she couldn't play it on four different DVD players is very misleading and would probably deter some folks from an otherwise great Blu-ray title.  First off, this is NOT a DVD.  This is a Blu-ray disc, which you will need a dedicated Blu-ray player or a Sony Playstation 3 to play it on.  That would explain why the reviewer saw nothing on four different DVD players.  Second, reviews of products should be based on the disc content itself, not whether or not it plays on their incompatible machines.  With that said, I found this disc to be highly entertaining, and any John Legend fan owes it to themselves to add this title to their collection if they own a Blu-ray player.  He performs his big hits exceptionally well and sounds great live.  Both the picture and sound quality are outstanding, and worthy of being considered high definition.  This is what music is all about, and it's even better on Blu.  Enjoy.",1201737600,,970,4.625730994152047
