8508825,5,B0072FGFGE,This is a beautiful film about a village in Japan that grows and dries persimmons. I dry persimmons from my one big tree the same way. I hang them to dry from my umbrella clothesline in October. Curious neighbors usually ask me if it is a Halloween decoration. I bought the film to share with interested master gardeners and simply to enjoy.,1409356800,,341,4.516129032258065
8508826,5,B0072FGFGE,"If you like growing fruit and hearing about the traditions of other cultures, this is the DVD for you! Although this film was made before video photography was as good as it is today, I still found this documentary heart warming. There are subtitles, so I watched it twice. Now I'm going to get my rare fruit growers club together so I can watch it with an appreciative audience. As our elders pass away, so does their knowledge. I'm very grateful that this film was made in time to hear from such willing to share persimmon growers.",1379808000,,533,4.505154639175258
8508827,5,B0072FGFGE,"This documentary is a moving, subtle, and loving look at a local and disappearing culture/community in Japan. Beautiful imagery, allied with sincere, charming, and sober interviews culled from a generation of people whose lives revolve around growing, harvesting, drying, and selling persimmons. I loved it.",1377993600,,307,5.844444444444444
