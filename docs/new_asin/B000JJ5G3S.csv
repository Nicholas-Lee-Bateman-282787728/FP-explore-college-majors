8150616,5,B000JJ5G3S,"My seven year old son is in love with this series. I think he has watched every episode on all five discs at least a dozen times.  It is well written and the characters fleshed out.  We actually prefer the series to the movie by a large margin.  Lian Chu is formidable and kind and Guizmo really has everyone interests at heart and Hector, their little dragon that lugs everything around for them is great comic relief. How can anyone dislike a warrior who knits?  The female characters are strong and positive. That the theme music is by The Cure is an extra bonus.",1288051200,2,566,4.413461538461538
