3829868,1,B001YTOIRW,They've edited this set within and inch of it's life. Removed some of the best classic skits like when Ruby and Buddy win the Truck in Hype....gone completely. I'm VERY VERY VERY sorry I wasted money on this. Don't make the same mistake I did.,1250035200,15,243,4.4222222222222225
3829869,1,B001YTOIRW,"The cover of this DVD says ""As Seen On HBO."" That is a BLATENT LIE!
There are OBVIOUSLY huge sections of the episodes that are missing.
Language is SO CLEARLY censored. In some episodes, she says things like ""I don't give a fig"" and anyone can easily see that is NOT the word that came out of her mouth. I can understand network T.V. editing language, but NOT a DVD. If they're going to advertise ""As Seen On HBO"", then that is what they should deliver. Fans deserve better than this crappy, heavily censored, hatchet job. Why censor a DVD? Don't waste your money.",1248134400,30,564,4.4326923076923075
3829870,2,B001YTOIRW,"It's been a number of years since I've seen this show in reruns (on HBO), but it is not hard to see that these shows have been EDITED. There are two episodes (two of my favorites) that I remember well and they are missing at least 3 or 4 minutes each. This set is advertised as the ""COMPLETE Season 3 & 4"". IT'S NOT. It even says ""complete"" right on the front cover.
I would think that such false advertising is illegal.

I would rather have paid a few dollars more and had these shows unedited. Perhaps if this were a 4 disk set (again, as advertised) instead of 3, there would be room for each episode in it's entirety.",1247788800,32,621,4.175
3829871,2,B001YTOIRW,First off the set is only 3 discs and not 4 as described. I was hoping I had a defective set or not the right one. I am still watching the first disc and one show was cut down to a little over 3 minutes. Once I found out my set is not defective I have started watching it again. I love the show and the scenes that are on the set. I just wish they advertised that it is a compilation of the last 2 seasons and not complete. I hate how the music industry controls the rights and makes it impossible to release tv shows the original way they were made and broadcast.,1247788800,10,564,3.9130434782608696
3829872,1,B001YTOIRW,"Unless my set is defective, Vivendi seems to have taken the 21 Season 3-4 episodes and butchered them literally beyond recognition.  Maybe this should have been obvious in advance, because if you do the math, 366 minutes of runtime leaves only 14 minutes per episode after the 72 minutes of bonuses are subtracted.

And indeed, some episodes are as short as 5 minutes, and it looks as if every one has been edited to some degree. Why bother to issue such a hack job?  I couldn't be more disappointed.",1247788800,32,500,4.595505617977528
3829873,5,B001YTOIRW,"Tracey Takes On... was ahead of its time.  Thankfully the Emmy Awards took notice and presented it with a ton of awards.  Who could forget Ruby, Fern, Chic, or Linda?  Kay, from ""The Tracey Ullman Show"", also joined the roster.  It was hilarious to see Kay's home life with her invalid mummy.  The best episodes in this set, in my humble opinion, are: Hollywood, The End of the World, Smoking, and Man's Best Friend, but they're all excellent.

The bonus bits, dedicated character episodes, are hilarious as well.  I love having an entire episode dedicated to Ruby Romaine (like the lettuce)!

Get this set!  You won't be disappointed!",1247443200,2,635,4.805555555555555
8348136,5,B001YTOIRW,Awsome!,1496966400,,7,7.0
8348137,5,B001YTOIRW,Tracey is so talented. It is hard to believe she can do so many diverse types of people-male and female. If you like her and  have never seen her HBO series I highly recommend these dvds. My personal favorite is Fern Rosenthal.,1477958400,,227,4.404761904761905
8348138,5,B001YTOIRW,"I bought these dvds a while ago and have enjoyed them immensely over the years. I miss her show very much. She is the queen of comedy in my book. If you love to laugh, this is for you.",1461369600,,184,3.7435897435897436
8348139,5,B001YTOIRW,"Its great price,and fast delivery",1452902400,,33,5.8

8348142,2,B001YTOIRW,"Why language is censored in an HBO sketch comedy series? I don't know. And why is each disc only two hours long when it could have been three? I don't know. With the exception of ""Smoking"", ""Dating"" & ""America"", almost every episode is edited to within an inch of its life. The ""Obsession"" episode is edited down to just over three minutes. And ""Religion"" is entirely missing. Gone are great segments like Ruby in the ""Marriage"" episode, Erin in the ""Drugs"" episode, Sheneesha in the ""Drugs"" episode, Linda in the ""Drugs"" episode, Chic in the ""Lies"" episode, Fern in the ""Books"" episode"", and of course Ruby's ""Hype"" segment. And also gone is the characters lip-syncing to ""They Don't Know"" at the start and close of every episode (one of the things I loved the most about every episode). In its place is the season one theme song, with only a black background stating the episode's title and series credits.

8348143,2,B001YTOIRW,"As other reviewers have stated: the third and fourth seasons of Tracy Ullman's classic HBO series have been edited down to what could and should be called ""Highlights of Tracy's Third & Fourth Season.""
