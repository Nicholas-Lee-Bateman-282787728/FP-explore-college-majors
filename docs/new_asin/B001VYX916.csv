8346829,5,B001VYX916,"This is a wonderful DVD of the standing Ba Dua Jin set. The movements are very easy to follow, and Tu Jin Sheng repeats every section with very clear instructions. What really inflated my positive opinion, was the added bonus at the end of the DVD: The Hua Shan Sleep Qi Gong. A Taoist qi gong which has you place your body in specific postures while you sleep, to achieve desired health effects.

The quality of the video is great, the audio is equally good. I particularly like the soundtrack, but that's a matter of personal preference. All the camera angles are perfect, and allow you a full view of each posture and motion. A solid 5/5.",1376697600,2,641,4.478632478632479
8346830,5,B001VYX916,The dvd is perfect for a workout at home. You get to work all your muscles and will feel better for the effort.,1374019200,,111,3.869565217391304
