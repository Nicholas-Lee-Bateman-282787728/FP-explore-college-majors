7012916,1,B00TLXINQ0,Worst movie I have ever paid for. Horrible acting. I mean bad. I don't know how I made it through the entire show. My wife said it reminds her of a bad high school play. I think more like junior high. They had some very sad attempts at humor. The BOO factor of the movie didn't even make us jump. Can't take it seriously. The trailer isn't bad but don't be fooled!,1437264000,2,364,4.069444444444445
7012917,1,B00TLXINQ0,Terrible movie and terrible acting. 99 minutes of your life you'll never get back. Don't waste your money or your time.,1437177600,2,119,4.714285714285714
7012918,5,B00TLXINQ0,"This blew my mind away!  It far exceeded my expectations!!  Let me start of by saying that this is an independent horror film.  I do enjoy horror movies, whether independent or not.  I think independent ones are a little bit better anyways, and this certainly beats those low budget Hollywood movies.  They did a good job with the stunts, tricks, and makeup effects.  Camera job could have been just a little bit better, but it was still very good.  This movie does start out a bit slow (especially during the first half), but in the second half, things really speed up and it leads to a nice long climax with nice twist in the end to leave you hanging (in other words, it leaves you wondering what could happen next, like all great movies and books).  The previous reviewer to me didn't even say why they thought this movie was bad and it shouldn't be trusted.

Please do not think that this movie has to do with the infamous dutch colonial house on Ocean Avenue in Amityville, as it does not and I did not expect it to.  It doesn't even make a reference to said house, and again, I did not expect it to.  The reason why the infamous name of Amityville is in the title is because the story takes place in Amityville, but it has nothing to do with the house that Amityville is known for.

This is better than a lot of independent horror movies I have seen.  I would have to say that this is a higher budget independent movie.  If you are a fan of good spooky story, or independent horror films, this comes highly recommended from me!  If you aren't, but know someone who is, it is a recommended gift item!",1437004800,2,1605,4.3389261744966445
7012921,2,B00TLXINQ0,"No offense to the makers of this ""film"" but it isn't any good. The dialouge is super tough to take and not much ever happens. Just a lot of standing around and talking. They go to an abandoned theater where nothing much happens other than a pimple being popped and a few kids getting possessed by some bad CGi. Sorry guys to offend but I would love to save my fellow movie fans from this flat dull lifeless boring waste of time.",1442361600,,428,4.2317073170731705
7012922,1,B00TLXINQ0,"I'm trying to find something nice to say about this movie,  but I can't. The acting is just horrible and nothing actually happens. I'm pretty sure the good reviews were written by the actors' moms or something.",1440547200,,210,4.675675675675675
7012923,3,B00TLXINQ0,"the amityville theather can't we leave the name to rip dose everything have to be with that title?  nightmare on amityville st or friday the amityville 13 th  i know they didn't make that you get my drift.  Why don't they just remake it tell the real story on killer ron the remake was great but far from the  true story. this movie is about haunted possed theather slashed with the amityville title to get us to buy it or rent it . I like haunted theather themes midnight movies , the last showing but this  is a pretty cool idea but the  wrong title to use it's far from what the real fans know about amityville.  movie fans have always had mixed opions on things so this might  be a great movie or a terrible piece of film.  I gave it a three for the theme and idea but zero on name uses remakes are usual bad now rehashing name titles i love amityville remake and part 1.-3 and about time but this is too much i bought it at video store for $5.47 because it was a no renter so i took it for horror theme and ideas but not the title i hope this is the last movie to abused the word amityville in a movie unless it's a remake of part 2 . update I am watching it & it like the  blair witch project 2 book of shadows so far trying to make this  real and scary with reality and making it look low budget you have  three guys and three girls kyle the jason biggs rip off who has smart comments for everything and one guy who spooked out  and other has no clue and fawn harriman owns the theather just wants answers and to  reopen it and wendy is the strange gothic chick who cliams that she lives in the theather and the asian girl who was bored at first and now totally freaked out. this is the weirdest amityville movie to ever be made . we should have a vote children of the corn vs amityville horror  vs child's  play vs texas chainsaw massacre we need no more films or remakes except the right one on amityville movie not  a ghost or demonic story we need it on the real topic Ron who killed his family and why and how not this horror hollywood made up story",1440460800,,2061,4.049382716049383
7012924,5,B00TLXINQ0,"A very interesting and worthy addition to the AMITYVILLE series!  It concerns the history of the village of Amityville more so than the actual haunted house we all know and love.  Decent special effects, a compelling storyline and some genuinely spooky scenes make this one worthy of a view.  Check it out!",1439769600,,306,4.846153846153846
7012925,1,B00TLXINQ0,This is the worst movie I have ever seen! Acting is horrible and the plot is no where to be found! Don't waste your money people....,1439769600,,132,4.115384615384615
7012926,1,B00TLXINQ0,I can't say enough bad things about this poor excuse of a horror film. I have never seen acting that bad ever! I'm just pissed that I wasted money on it. We couldn't even stand to finish watching it!,1439596800,,199,4.128205128205129
7012927,5,B00TLXINQ0,This movie I saw at a store as I was looking at dvds something about it caught my eye soooo I just trusted my instincts and grabbed it and checked out and said this is low b independent ima like this.....so the first time I watched it it started off nice to perfect and I got sooo creeped out later on in the movie.....and I was in lovve with the main character she was a catch in my eye and for me being a gay guy I just felt related to her I understood what she went through ive been through in life.....now this movie is independent and for those that love to watch films that you know noone will hear of which is why I picked up this gem.....go for it acting verrryyyy spot on all characters likeable indie I couldn't stand but I got over it and she grew on me the punkie chic fell in love with her considering she dresses like me and I loved her right away she was sooo cooooollll but respectful to others which is why I should say great character development and awesome scenery makeup great job too the characters loomed amazing. Now this movie is about a girl who inherits a ace from her parents so she and her friends go there to spend time party and things go awrly wrong then everyone turns against each other which gets them into trouble.  I really lime this movie and im watching it my second time if your into independent which I always find better cause the acting is always more like real life then go pick it up you won't be disappointed :) glad to have another independent fantastic gem to my collection,1438560000,,1521,4.22680412371134
7012928,1,B00TLXINQ0,Terrible! No redeeming value at all....,1437696000,,39,5.666666666666667
7012929,1,B00TLXINQ0,"The film has the word ""Amityville"" in it so we know it has to be scary and somehow related to the 10,000 other films with its name in it. And we know this is the REAL Amityville because there is a car with a magnetic sign that says ""Amityville"" plus other cardboard signs. Pay no attention to the distinctive Manitoba license plate with ""Friendly Manitoba"" blurred out.

Fawn (Monle LeStrat) inherits the theater from her recently deceased parents who died in a cabin fire by a Canadian lake. She wants to ""check it out"" with an overnight group of friends. The theater showed opera by day and adult films by night. The theater was shut down in 2010 while the last film on the marquee was ""Valley of the Demon"" a 2013/14 film.

The sound was uneven and the soundtrack consisted mostly of a piano with two keys. I initially laughed at Fawn's delivery of bad dialogue until I watched the rest of the cast, who were actually worse. Director  John R. Walker carved himself out a role in a subplot in a confusing teacher's spot which includes an odd scene of Brits discussing American History.  Other odd scenes include the motel room rental and the knock out and release scene.

The demonic voice enhancer is a dead low budget give away and is normally used in zero budget films. I wasn't sure why they whipped out a Ouija Board and have it play such a minor role other than Ouija boards are cheap. You don't have to use everything you learned the day you spent at film making school.

This borders on ""so bad it is good.""

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Kyle makes numerous homophobic statements.

Congrats Mr. Walker on getting this into Walmart and Amazon UK and the impressive 2.5 IMDB rating.",1437350400,2,1694,4.5130718954248366
7012930,1,B00TLXINQ0,"...to say it is as bad as a junior high production is an insult to some of the great productions I've seen at middle schools.  The acting is appallingly and painfully horrible -- but it is actually better than the attempts at special effects.  I rented this for a too-hot-to-do-anything day and only did so because according to the Amazon Prime display on my TV, it had 5 stars.  I'm guessing that that individual either directed or ""starred"" in this film.  It has nothing to do with the house on Ocean Avenue -- and the back story is confusing and ambiguous.
Spare yourself any pain and avoid this.",1437264000,2,599,4.518518518518518

8702240,2,B00TLXINQ0,"One of the worst Amityville movies ever made in the series, take everyone else's word for it or unless you're in for collecting them all you should pass on this one. Disappointing!!!",1498176000,,182,4.71875
8702241,2,B00TLXINQ0,"This was a tough one to get through but instead of pointing out everything wrong with it I'll mention what I liked about it. The concept, though far removed from the original story, is pretty awesome. After seeing Amityville movies revolving around a lamp, a clock and a mirror it was nice to have a story that was about a building again. If you're going to base a horror film around one main location a theater is a great place to do it. For me, the acting was so bad that it kind of became so bad that it's good. The young character's do warm up a little after a while and once it gets more adults in the picture it broadens the horizon. I'm not sure how I feel about the whole conspiracy element of the story but it does put a different twist on things. This movie was very restricted by it's budget but it makes the most of what it has. Bonus points for lead Monele LeStrat resembling a 1960's French ye-ye singer! Note: This film is also known as Amityville Playhouse.",1480291200,,973,4.264864864864865
