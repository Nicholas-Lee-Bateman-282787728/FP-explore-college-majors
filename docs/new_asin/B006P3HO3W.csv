5012084,4,B006P3HO3W,I was a little disappointed that the movie was not a little longer. It was both funny and cute. I would like to see another movie involving the kittens and Puss in Boots,1390176000,2,169,4.151515151515151

5012090,5,B006P3HO3W,Have watched it several time with my grandsons and we all loved it. Will enjoy it for many years to come,1375056000,,104,4.0
5012091,4,B006P3HO3W,It was a decent film. It is not a complex in the storyline or good as the Shrek movies. I was a bit disappointed in the overall story. It did make me laugh and had some great animation. It had memorable characters and I liked it overall.,1370476800,,237,4.0638297872340425
5012092,5,B006P3HO3W,This DVD is an adventure of Puss in Boots and is a delightful spin off from the Shrek movies.  The Three Diablos is about 3 kittens that Puss in Boots shows how to deal with life.,1359936000,,179,3.9722222222222223

5012094,5,B006P3HO3W,"The Three Diabos is short, but adorable to watch. As a fan of cats in general, enjoyed how the movie captures the realistic qualities of felines. Story is a bit long, but animation is spot on.",1358035200,,192,4.361111111111111

5012097,5,B006P3HO3W,"This is one of the few ""cartoons"" that I've watched as an adult that:

#1 Kept my interest (the story is good, the music is great, ...)

#2 Made me laugh out loud

#3 I would watch again

#4 Is appropriate for all ages

I bought this originally for my youngest nephew who is fascinated with cats although he's not allowed to have one yet.  (I have two, so he may have fixated on mine.)

To my surprise Guillermo Del Toro is behind this and I liked it so much I may have to by myself a copy!",1355097600,,490,3.938775510204082

5012099,4,B006P3HO3W,"We loved the Puss in Boots movie!  SO cute and funny.  But I would pass on the two disc set, as the second is just a short mini-movie.",1349740800,,134,3.75
5012100,5,B006P3HO3W,"Ever since I took my daughter, now 10, to see this movie, she was always asking me to buy the DVD for her.  It was a good movie for her because she is very active and can easily lose attention in something if it does not hold her attention.  This movie did this as she loved all the Shrek movies so she wanted to see this movie.  The character is captivating as he vacillates between the cute kitty cat and the swashbuckling hero who is here to save the day and take credit.  Think of Zorro as a cat as Antonio Banderas played Zorro and voiced this character.",1347926400,,559,4.148148148148148
5012101,5,B006P3HO3W,"This movie is great and fun to watch.
The picture quality is very good and the sound is wonderful.
The short movie 'The 3 Diablos' is very good.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puss-in-Boots-The-Three-Diablos-Two-Disc-Double-DVD-Pack/dp/B006P3HO3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puss in Boots / The Three Diablos (Two-Disc Double DVD Pack)</a>",1345939200,,382,8.341463414634147
5012102,5,B006P3HO3W,"The creators of ""Puss in Boots"" must have had cat lovers in mind when they made this delightful movie gem.  Intertwined with human - qualities is cat behaviour so familiar to cat - lovers and owners!  Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek made a great (and very funny) team, as they lend their voices to the title character and his love interest, Kitty Softpaws.

Besides being highly - entertaining, the film contains messages about morals, friendship and facing one's mistakes in life.  Movie scenes pay homage to such films as  ""Fight Club,"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""Lord of the Rings.""  Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris are hilarious as Jack and Jill, who are more reminiscent of Bonnie and Clyde than characters in a children's tale.

Also, I enjoy the Latin flavour that threads its way throughout ""Puss in Boots"" and its storyline.  Especially the music!  Even Lady Gaga - whose song 'Americano' is featured - gets in on the act.

And, I suspect,  the film's Humpty Dumpty is a gay character.  At least, that's the impression I get.",1343606400,5,1043,4.76536312849162
5012103,3,B006P3HO3W,"I liked Puss in Boots, especially when they showed him as a kitten, so I wanted to see the Three Diablos short film. It's only 11 minutes. The animation of the kittens is not the same quality as Puss in Boots. They don't look furry, but more like a Sims character with a pattern over a flat surface. There were a couple cute moments but it wasn't too entertaining. I would want to see more of Puss in Boots as a kitten, but Three Diablos doesn't satisfy that for me.",1342742400,3,466,4.188888888888889
5012104,4,B006P3HO3W,"This movie was O.K.  It was not as entertaining as we had hoped that it would be, but, it was fair for the price.  It was not as good as other animated that movies we own.",1341014400,,171,3.7222222222222223

5012111,5,B006P3HO3W,"If I had known that ""The Three Diablos"" movie included with ""Puss in Boots"" was only 12 minutes long I would have saved a few bucks and purchased only ""Puss in Boots"".

""Puss in Boots"" rated higher in my opinion than reviews by critics.",1333756800,,236,4.363636363636363
5012112,5,B006P3HO3W,"I first saw this movie in the theater, in 3D, because I ""had"" to go with a group, and they had young children.  I was actually looking forward to taking a nap for a couple of hours after getting only 4 hours sleep the night before.  But after the first couple of minutes, everything changed....

From the very beginning, this movie captures your attention and doesn't let go.  The graphics were absolutely outstanding!  And the jokes were actually... funny!!!  And the MUSIC?  Totally engaging and blanketed the entire film with a Spanish ambience that only added to the already exciting experience.  The 3D from the theater was superb, I might add.  But many weeks after leaving the theater, I saw this was available on Amazon... and I just HAD to HAVE it!  Everything the movie offered couldn't possibily have been diminished to the point where ordering this DVD to watch at home in 2D would be pointless.... just for the music alone!

Every twist and turn in the movie was unexpected and exciting.  Every time I thought I could predict what would happen next -- BAM! Within seconds, the movie took a new turn with head-slapping moments of disbelief.

I wouldn't dream of putting any spoilers here to rob you of the level of enjoyment I had when viewing it for the first time.  I was no fan of Puss or anything remotely related to Shrek as far back as Shrek 1.  But THIS movie?  IT WAS OUTTA SITE!!!!!!!!!

Note on the Three Diablos:  This product does have The Three Diablos DVD in the package for several dollars more than buying the featured movie alone.  This movie/short doesn't have the impact the feature movie does, nor did I expect it to.  It's only 11 minutes in length, and features three ""baby"" pusses with swords as the ""stars""... sort of like ""little pusses in boots,"" the way the ""baby muppets"" spun off the original muppets.  I only saw parts of this short, but that was on You Tube (the full 11 minutes version) and before I purchased this set.  The only reason I ordered this set and not the movie alone was that I knew I'd be pulling it out for some of my friends' kids who visit from time to time and thought they may enjoy it (kids' taste do often differ from adults' taste ... never met a kid yet that said ""I hate that cartoon!"" -- they love everything!!).  And I certainly didn't want to enter a situation where those kids knew about the second movie's existence or may have had it at home and then ask ME if I had it.  I didn't want to disappoint the yunguns who would be watching this and thought the little bit difference in price was not unwarranted and was worth having it on hand.

Ages 1 to 101, get the popcorn and enjoy!  Adios, amigos!",1331510400,13,2671,4.455670103092784
5012113,3,B006P3HO3W,"I ordered the double pack (puss in Boots movie and the Three Diablos ""movie"") for my 5 yr old daughter because she saw a commercial for the movie and it said it came with the Three Diablos movie. It finally came in the mail, she was super excited, she popped in the Three Diablos, and it was 11 minutes long. She was extremely disappointed, as was I. Now I know why in the ""description"", it didn't say the length of the ""movie"". She loves the Puss In Boots movie, its a great movie. She just thought, as did I, that she was getting another Puss in Boots movie.",1331078400,3,560,4.194444444444445
5012114,5,B006P3HO3W,"This movie was even better than I thought it would be.  The voice of Puss is purrfect.
