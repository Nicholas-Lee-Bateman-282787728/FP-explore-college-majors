6761662,5,B00OU4MORY,"Let me add my praises to the others here for this extraordinary story.  I completely agree with Mr. Wolf's assessment that this is equal to ""Foyle's War"" in production values and historical accuracy.  There are not superlatives enough to describe the excellence of acting, the revelation of true events, these young women were real people who faced not only the rigors of war, but in a time when women were not  perceived as capable of anything outside of the domestic realm.  These women rose to the challenge, and surpassed what was expected of them.....true heroes of the war, they paved the way for modern nurses in the service.  I highly recommend this for those who enjoy historical accounts, and for anyone who has an interest in World War I and for nurses everywhere who will cheer at the representation of some of their profession's finest persons.  Thank you Acorn for bringing this to viewers in the States that might have otherwise missed such a treasure.",1422748800,9,967,4.83030303030303
6761663,5,B00OU4MORY,"ANZAC GIRLS. In this Australian television series, four idealistic, nave young Australian nurses --and one New Zealander-- arrive in Egypt to serve in World War I. They are full of romantic notions; expect war to be a splendid adventure.  Then  they face the carnage of the convoys of the wounded from the battles of Gallipoli in Turkey, and the Somme campaign on the Western front; horrific living conditions, British/ army prejudice, and devastating personal loss. As they rise to meet their challenges, they find love and lasting friendship in their hearts. Based on Peter Reess book The Other ANZACs, drawing on the real nurses letters, photos, journals, and historical records, this acclaimed Australian miniseries tells the nurses harrowing story.  The production has been called a ""beautifully shot, multilayered drama"" by The Sunday Telegraph, Australia, that ""brings these little-known stories vividly to life"" by The Daily Telegraph, Australia. I received this as a review copy.  The box set consists of 6 episodes, 6 hours worth on 2 DVDs.  And it has behind-the-scenes featurettes (34 min.), cast interviews (18 min.), photo galleries, and historical context. And subtitles, thank goodness, else some of us would be struggling with the down under accents.

I am not familiar with the young Australian actors who constitute the leads of this series, but don't think anyone could have done better.  Their performances are further enhanced by more than 1200 actors and extras. The photography is outstanding; furthermore, the production  seems extremely historically accurate in the costumes, transport, props, interiors, etc.

The episodes are, with thanks to Acorn/RLJ Entertainment,
Disc 1
Episode 1: Adventure
Following the outbreak of WWI, the Australian Army Nursing Service is hastily deployed. Four Australian nurses and one New Zealander arrive in Cairo in early 1915. Flirtatious Alice catches the eye of a handsome lieutenant, while her roommate, Elsie, carries a secret. The carnage of the Gallipoli landing in April is worse than anything the nurses could have imagined.

Episode 2: Duty
The August Offensive results in some of the campaign's worst casualties. Grace and Olive are sent to the barren Greek island of Lemnos to care for the wounded. Once there, they find no supplies, no hospital, ghastly living conditions, and a commanding officer who doesn't want them there. Elsie fights for her husband's life in a British hospital, and Grace receives devastating news.

Episode 3: Endurance
By autumn 1915, widespread illness and low morale are taking their toll. Lieutenant Harry Moffitt, the man Alice loves, has been sent back to the Australian hospital in Cairo with severe typhoid. The chipper, resilient Olive, still on Lemnos, faces her darkest hour. After the withdrawal from Gallipoli, the ANZAC girls are reunited in Cairo. Elsie must make a difficult choice.

Disc 2
Episode 4: Love
In spring 1916, Allied forces are sent into France. Alice, Olive, Hilda, and Grace are temporarily posted to a British hospital in Rouen, where they are treated with scorn by the nursing staff. Olive reconnects with Pat Dooley, a young orderly she met on Lemnos. Grace is promoted and sent to London, and Alice receives shattering news.

Episode 5: Mateship
The war in France drags on into the winter of 1916. With no proof of Harry's death, a grief-stricken Alice grasps at hope. Hilda discovers a talent for anesthesia, then learns that Australian nurses are banned from that work. Luckily, she's a Kiwi. Olive defies her parents to follow her heart, and Elsie Cook returns as a Red Cross nurse.

Episode 6: Courage
In late summer 1917, after years of bloodshed, the war rages on. Olive has resigned and left for Australia with Pat. Alice and Hilda are in Trois Arbres, very near the front line. Elsie is at the Red Cross hospital in Amiens. All but one of the nurses serve until the very end. Looking back years later, Alice outlines the rest of their lives.

According to Wikipedia, the blood-soaked Gallipoli campaign, around which the first three episodes center, is often considered as marking the birth of national consciousness in Australia and New Zealand.  The date of the first landing, April 25, is known as ""Anzac Day"" which is the most significant commemoration of veterans and military casualties of WWI in those two countries.  The experts believe that the Gallipoli campaign was plagued by ill-defined goals, poor planning, insufficient artillery, inexperienced troops, inaccurate maps and intelligence, overconfidence, inadequate equipment and logistics, and tactical deficiencies at all levels. Casualty figures for the campaign vary between sources, but it is believed that by the time the Gallipoli Campaign ended over 100,000 men were dead, including around 53,000 British and French soldiers , 8,709 Australians -- and 2,721 New Zealanders, about a quarter of those who had landed on the peninsula.  Furthermore, many soldiers became sick due to the unsanitary conditions, especially from typhoid, dysentery and diarrhea: it is estimated that at least 145,000 British soldiers became ill during the campaign.

The Battle of the Somme is central to the last three episodes of the series. According to Wikipedia, it took place between July 1 and November 18, 1916 on both sides of the River Somme in France. The battle was one of the largest of World War I, in which more than 1,000,000 men were wounded or killed, making it one of the bloodiest battles in human history.  The original Allied estimate of casualties on the Somme was 485,000 British and French casualties and 630,000 German.

What I loved best about this series was the remarkable strength these women showed, conquering physical exhaustion, demoralization, primitive living conditions, personal loss, random bombings while facing the need to have to prove themselves over and over again to those who doubted their strength and qualifications.  While wearing the horrendously restrictive clothing of the time, of which we get a good look: corsets and crinolines, skirts that drag in the mud.  While fighting tirelessly to save every life they couldGerman as well as Allied-- amidst the horrors of this war. Finally, we learn that all these remarkable nurses went on to productive, high-achieving lives.  Five extraordinary women, unsung heroes, are at last given their due, a century late.  What took you so long, Australia?",1422057600,38,6432,5.221359223300971
6761664,5,B00OU4MORY,"I had a chance to watch this before it was released in the USA and was riveted by the story. It is based on the ANZAC Girls, aka Australian and New Zealand nurses of WWI and the women depicted were real women. You can find more about them in a wonderful book, also titled ANZAC Girls here on Amazon. The actors were amazing, if you like shows like Downton Abbey or any BBC, Canadian, like Bomb Girls, or Australian production, like Miss Fisher, then you are already familiar with the high quality acting in the shows and mini-series they produce. This one does not disappoint, in fact, I thought these actresses were far better than most of my favorite shows or movies. I felt like I was living the story with them, the characters were real, the story raw and emotional, and as far as I could tell, the costumes, battles, locations, etc. were spot on. I felt like I had been transported back to WWI and was walking beside these women in WWI experiencing it right along with them. I could go on and on, but I will just say, this is a powerful mini-series that highlights these brave women and the amazing things they did during WWI, right on the front lines, no less! I highly recommend you also buy the book that gives even more detail into the women's lives portrayed here and the war. As it's not rated, there are romantic situations, sexual innuendos, death, and war/battles with blood and some gruesome scenes. I'm looking forward to owning this on DVD!",1421539200,95,1457,4.50188679245283
6761665,5,B00OU4MORY,"6 stars.
Gobsmacking --- really good -it's BONZER!
`ANZAC Girls' equals `Folye's War' for historical accuracy of costumes, props, sets, suspense, action, and characters. 6-STARS perfect.
It is the TRUE story of 5 REAL nurses who enter war duty a bit nave but who meet the unbelievable challenge of medicine on the warfront. ANZAC: Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. This is a seldom mentioned part of WWI finally getting it's due a century late. And what a remarkable realistic presentation has been created. Extraordinary women face the brutality of war and make a difference for every war that followed. Epic in scope, heart wrenching in spirit, unsurpassed in cinematography, & one of the finest docu-dramas ever produced about `The War to End all Wars.' Hats-Off to our Outback mates for this compelling, educational, and eye and heart bursting miniseries.
I was so got by these nurses that I wanted to salute them.

Adapted from `The Other ANZACS' by Peter Rees, plus authentic war records, and photos, letters, and diaries of the nurses themselves.

SDH SUBTITLES are provided for feature episodes and bonus.
6 episodes on 2 discs; the first half dealing with ANZAC activity in Egypt (Gallipoli), and the second half on the French front (Somme). It is not rated, battlefield and hospital scenes often bloody and realistically graphic, so, preteen thru adult.

I found it refreshing to find such a well done piece of history that shows the other, more unspoken bunch of hero's for the war and all wars for that matter. AG shows the resilience these women had to hold within themselves while having to prove themselves over and over again to those who thought them lesser qualified to be there when time and time again, they showed that THEY were the superior. An uplifting story of the strength of women overall. Highly recommended.",1418169600,49,492,4.6022727272727275

While a little slow at times and not highly choreographed, it is incredibly poignant, moving, and heartbreaking. It can be very intense. The acting is very good and this series is well worth the time; very rewarding. For those interested in a content review: There is one sex scene between a married couple though no nudity and there is almost no profanity, which is surprising but appreciated.

6761690,5,B00OU4MORY,"I have to say, all of the positive reviews on this program that have been posted are quite merited.  My Mother and I both really enjoyed this program.  The first three episodes were very heavy on the war aspect as far as the constant arrival of wounded servicemen and then the last three episodes focused more on the nurses themselves.  The last three episodes, especially, my Mother and I really enjoyed.  The series focuses on the experiences of five Australian New Zealand Army Corps nurses who sign up to aid the military men early on in WWI.  Although desperately needed by the wounded soldiers, the army hasn't mentally prepared for the concept of nurses close to the front.  And so they are faced with the dilemma of trying to nurse an overwhelming number of wounded and ill coming in daily from Gallipolli, with few resources and not even a shower with which to maintain their personal hygiene. Under the leadership of Miss Wilson, they maintain their bravery and determination to aid the soldiers at all costs and one is really left in awe of their dedication to the sick, wounded, and dying.  And also impressed at the end when they give the updates on the nurses' lives after the war was over.  They all were quite accomplished and some resumed their services during the second world war.  It is a clean program and very well done.  I look forward to more production from Australia with this kind of quality.",1460937600,,1419,4.662650602409639

6761704,5,B00OU4MORY,"Women have generally been given short shrift in history books.
That's especially true when it comes to those books that chronicle warfare.
I suppose that's not surprising since most histories are written by men and most of those authors have never seen combat.
So it is that the stories of women like Nancy Wake - a highly decorated Special Operations Executive agent who once killed an SS soldier with a punch in the throat while on a mission - and Major Wanda Gertz, who received Poland's highest award for valor in recognition of her service fighting the Nazis in World War II, are all but unknown to the general public.
Until recently, the brave Australian and New Zealand women who served as nurses during World War I were also relatively unknown. The brilliant mini-series ""Anzac Girls"" has thankfully changed that even if it did take a century for their story to come out. The series revolves round the true stories of five women who signed up when the war broke out. It is based on the exceptional book ""The Other Anzacs"" by Peter Rees and on the letters and diaries of the women themselves.
It's important to note that these nurses did not serve far to the rear, away from the fighting. Some were, for example, stationed aboard a hospital ship that was torpedoed while anchored off Gallipoli during the ill-fated and ill-conceived effort by Australian and New Zealand troops to gain a foothold on Turkish soil. Others, meanwhile, weathered primitive conditions on the island of Lemnos not far from the fighting and later, after the disastrous Gallipoli campaign was abandoned, they were bombed and strafed while serving in France. If the threat of death was not enough, the nurses faced antagonism from the men who ran the military medical units they were assigned to and from British nurses, who looked down on them as ""colonials."" Despite that, in the best traditions of nursing, they soldiered on, doing their duty regardless. Some of them - including Sister Alice Ross-King - were among the few women who were decorated for bravery during the war while others, such as Sister Hilda Steele - pioneered new roles for women in medicine.
This is not just a series that focuses only on the war itself, however. It is also a story of friendship, loyalty, and love; of women who risked not only their lives but also their hearts. As such, it gives a well-rounded picture of the lives these women led during the war as casualty figures reached truly horrific proportions, the likes of which had never before been seen.
There are no weak links in the cast but I would single out Anna McGahan - as Sister Olive Haynes - and Caroline Craig - as Matron Grace Wilson - for their truly excellent work in the series. The cinematography of Geoffrey Hall is outstanding and the direction by both Ken Cameron and Ian Watson is top notch. Both directors give their actors room to work within a well-paced series.
The verdict?
You will truly enjoy watching this story of women at war. It is a series that I cannot recommend highly enough.",1451692800,5,3031,4.7315689981096405

It is beautiful, flowing, emotional and powerful in following five women's accounts (based on the letters and diaries of five real life nurses) and their response to the Great War and bloodshed they would witness. This is a unique snapshot of Australia and New Zealand's service in the war and how they shone despite their devastating losses.

BRIEF HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE AT BOTTOM OF REVIEW

Stories of WWI nurses and their extraordinary contributions are rarely told, let alone those of the Australian New Zealand Army Corp (ANZAC).  This extraordinary 6 part series gives an amazing perspective by following the ANZAC nurses as they begin in Cairo and off Turkey, later joining the Western Front in Rouen, France.  It was inspired by the Peter Rees book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Other-Anzacs/dp/1459603834/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Other Anzacs</a>&nbsp;and based on diaries, letters, historical documents.  Here is a cheaper reprint coinciding with this release&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anzac-Girls/dp/1743319827/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anzac Girls</a>.  All the main protagonists are real people.  However,some relationships and timelines have been altered to bring these extraordinary women into one story.  The general structure remains fairly faithful.  In many cases the dialog is taken directly from their correspondence.  The historical changes made shouldn't be judged too harshly.  A strict documentary would note receive this kind of a profile (though I would love to see one).  The filming is stunning and the character development is outstanding.  This is one of my favorite shows made in conjunction with the WWI centennial.  If you enjoy this type of program, you may also like a more fictional drama&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crimson-Field/dp/B00VC1YFBG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crimson Field</a>.  This was a turning point in history, but also a turning point in the history of women.

THE STORY AS IT RELATES TO THIS PRODUCTION (no spoilers):  The story begins with a group of nurses, 4 Australian and 1 New Zealand, arriving in Cairo at the 1st Australian General Hospital (1st AGH) in preparation for the Gallipoli campaign.  Central character Alice Ross-King is the youthful and wide eyed adventure seeker who feels she is ready for anything.  She has fierce intelligence and self assurance, yet also  beauty, romanticism, and vulnerability.  All of these traits seem to attract a lot of male attention and it doesn't hurt that she knows how to flirt.  Olive Haynes is a little less  refined, but very gregarious and steadfast.  Though she can seem all business at times, she is also the outlandish personality that boosts moral when things are worst.  Elsie Sheppard is elegant, but always willing to roll her sleeves up.  She has societal ties, but hides a secret that could jeopardize her standing as a nurse.  Hilda Steele is the New Zealander and is more quiet, less self assured.  However, her skill and intelligence will eventually pave a way for nurses to perform tasks once reserved for men.  These four women and one matron Grace Wilson will make up the five primary characters in this tale.  The nurses find immediately that the army holds them as a low priority.  They are treated with ambivalence at times, and sometimes disdain.  Male officers feel they should not be near front lines.  They start together in the story, but quickly split for various assignments more accurate to their real history.  The story of these extraordinary women is like a headline of exotic places and awful events during WWI.  Cairo, Port Said, Alexandria, Isle of Lemnos supporting Gallipoli, and later Rouen France supporting battles like the Somme and Ypres.  The hardships at Lemnos are extraordinary as they arrive and operate without even basic shelter at first.  Then arriving in France and working at forward clearing stations, even combat situations find them as they suffer gas attacks and aerial bombardment.  The main characters are fully certified nurses not V.A.D.s (Volunteer Aid Detachment).  However, not only must the ANZAC nurses fight for respect from the army, they encounter a hostile environment from  British nurses when they first arrive in France.  All along the way they are proving themselves and even innovating procedures and time honored rules.  Love will find some and loss will find others.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  WWI didn't just change upward mobility in the social classes, it changed the role of women in society as well.  This beautiful drama is inspirational and also heartrending at times.  It's great TV, but there was also tremendous effort placed in historical details.  The actresses are each extraordinary in their own way as well.  Anna McGahan as Olive Haynes has such a unique way of speaking, what a terrific character!  Laura Brent as Sister Elsie Cook is so elegant appropriate to the social ties she represents, but has plenty of strength for the rougher duties.  Georgia Flood as Alice Ross-King is most exceptional of all.  They give her such an amazing ""Gibson Girl"" face and costume, but the strength, wonderment and charm just exude out of her.  The character looked like she could have walked out of a Frank Benson painting.  I don't know if Georgia was that well known in Australian TV/Cinema before, but she was brilliant here.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE:  Like British Army nurses, fully certified ANZAC nurses were also called Sister, wore nun like clothing, and were not allowed to be currently married.  The accounts depicted in this drama were heavily drawn from diaries and correspondence of three of the nurses in particular.  Alice Ross-King, Olive Haynes and Elsie Sheppard Cook.  Elsie's diaries are in the Australian War Memorial Museum, Brisbane.  Matron Grace Cook had already been a matron (Brisbane Hospital) prior to WWI as you may expect.  She also was awarded the first Medal for Nursing Excellence in Australia.  She was actually with 3 AGH traveling to France at the beginning of the war and was in England preparing to go forward when they re-routed the 3rd to Lemnos Island instead.  She served in many high nursing leadership roles even into WWII.  Alice Ross-King appears very youthful in this show.  In real life, she did start nursing in Australia before she was old enough to take formal courses.  She worked in many capacities, became certified, and even served as acting matron in a private hospital before WWI, so she also had leadership experience though young.  The Alice-Harry relationship is also generally true.",1431734400,9,6479,5.458207452165156

6761753,5,B00OU4MORY,Another part of history I was not familiar with. WW1 seems so distant that I barely remember it being covered much in school. Some college courses in the 80's that I took later in life did a better job.  What was amazing is that very little was said about the Aussies or New Zealanders.  This story of the nurses and especially the war with the Turkish Army was barely mentioned.  I so enjoyed the story and the detail was so exacting that I almost felt I was there.  This is a must see for any history buff and certainly for someone who has the time to enjoy looking at a part of world history and knowing this is true to detail.,1430611200,3,630,4.181818181818182

This movie gives an authentic look at the lives of war nurses working on the front lines of World War I.  The characters play real people and are very intriguing.
 When the series was finished I went away with a new appreciation of the part women, especially the nurses, have played in wartime.
 Acorn, BBC... has Hollywood beat when it comes to making good movies.  The writers, directors, producers,and  actors,  do such a terrific job of telling a story without all the trash of bad language, and focus on graphic sex. A good story gives you hints and lets you fill in the rest.
