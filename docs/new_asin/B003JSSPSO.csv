This movie wasn't the greatest... it was... alright. Yeah, just alright. I mainly bought this one just to add to my 3D collection. I should have known better?  Once again I've bought a movie I've never heard of before, not realizing it was an older film (2008, 4 years)... only to be disappointed by the LACK of 3D!  As most images in this have no depth, it's another processed (or is it???) 2D movie sold as 3D Blu-ray that falls short of being 3D. This 3D Blu-ray (if you want to call it that... I don't) production gets a 1 star rating because it's packaged as something it's NOT!!!!!",1347062400,6,672,4.455284552845528
4131377,3,B003JSSPSO,"I thought it was a watchable movie. it had a nice couple of plot twists and a good ending.
Not bad at all.",1341446400,,106,3.652173913043478
4131378,4,B003JSSPSO,"If you need a movie fix, consider The Job. Dark and twisted with a comedic element.  It just might scratch the itch.",1330214400,,116,4.2727272727272725
4131379,4,B003JSSPSO,"This is a really great black comedy (just to be clear, the genre is from from the French, 1935: humour noir).  Though it's paced like a thriller, it is actually more 'comedy' than 'black.'  And for me, it just plain works:  the only time I wasn't grinning, I was laughing.  But like all black comedies, the grins are what you came for, not belly laughs.

For some reason, THE JOB reminds me a little of the late, great Paul Bartel.  I think the first ""indie"" movie I ever saw, and certainly the first humour noir, was Bartel's 1982 cult masterpiece, ""Eating Raoul."" (And that was in, uhhh, 1982.)  Even if THE JOB is a bit less over-the-top, I can easily imagine Bartel making this flick, or perhaps appearing in it as one of his many, many droll cameos in other indie director's films.

There's almost nothing I can say about the plot without spoiling something, so I won't.  The actors are all good, especially Ron Perlman -- he's great here, a cross between Tom Waits and Sid Haig (and that's a big complement, not that I would expect anything less from Perlman).

Let me be clear: there is very little violence, blood, sex or even action in this movie.  Even the bad guys are totally tongue-in-cheek.  But if you're in the mood for some big grins, and more whimsy than action, then kick back with THE JOB.  And don't blame me if you get a headache from wearing a stupid grin for an hour or two.",1305849600,2,1398,4.4140625

8398471,5,B003JSSPSO,"great movie, the plot had me guessing until the very end. definitely a movie to watch over and over again.",1394928000,,106,4.35
8398472,5,B003JSSPSO,One of those flics nobody every seems to know about. It is a good twist type plot. I really enjoyed it,1393718400,,102,3.9047619047619047
8398473,3,B003JSSPSO,"ron perlman, you are a good actor...what were you thinking? enjoy ron perlman movies, just wish he would be in a big movie.",1367193600,,123,4.391304347826087
8398474,2,B003JSSPSO,"this movie is ok. It should have been a lot better, because the cast and concept are great. But it's not very good. Poorly directed and edited.",1364860800,,143,4.333333333333333
8398475,3,B003JSSPSO,"Do you know what an Allegory is? That is this movie. It is really abstract. This movie is written like a Greek play, or a Shakespear play. If that is your thing you might like this movie.

However, given that I went into the film, expecting something more B-Movie thriller, less Oedipus or the Odyssey, it was kind of a disappointment.

Now some would say, ""Deception"" was a complicated film with layers. Comparing that film, to this work, is like comparing Pre-Algebra to Linear Calculus.

Overall the movie was somewhat entertaining. But not in a going out with your friends and partying sort of a way, more in a putting together a puzzle kind of way. I was expecting something different going in to the film.

If this is the kind of film you want to see watch it. If not, you won't enjoy watching it. If you don't know what an Allegory is off the top of your head, this film will likely be very unsatisfying.",1360886400,,911,4.437125748502994
8398476,2,B003JSSPSO,"The writing, directing, pace, acting and entertainment are all here.

TOO BAD...... the full story line is completely incoherent.

For me, the bizare (string you along with events that make no sense at all) story is only worth telling if it actually ties together in some way eventually.

I enjoyed looking forward to experience the conclusion of this tale, until it never arrived.",1358467200,,381,5.015873015873016
8398477,1,B003JSSPSO,"In addition to what the other reviewer said -- The movie itself is incredibly boring, and a complete waste of time... Which begs the question, of all the movies to spend money on to convert 2D to 3D... why they Hell pick this movie!? _ It wasn't successful (and with reason)... and it's a Indie-Film that didn't have a lot of money to spend on it's creation (clearly), so I would love to know what idiot thought making this crap into ""3D"" was a good business venture? (Rhetorical) _ Unlike the 1st reviewer though, I rented this movie because I wasn't going to take the chance of buying it and Hoping it was good... only to see my Dollars go down the toilet (which is where this film belongs). __ So, 3D quality aside, which having seen it in 2D, I can attest to it not even being a good candidate for 'conversion'... The movie itself stinks anyway... so don't waste your money even buying a 2D version! (If your curiosity is too overwhelming, you can 'Stream' it on Netflix)  ('Stream' = Watch the movie online)",1350172800,3,1012,4.440860215053763
