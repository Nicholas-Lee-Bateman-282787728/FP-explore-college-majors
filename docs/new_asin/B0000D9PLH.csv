8000366,4,B0000D9PLH,"In this DVD you will find a nice collection of short films. It is a refreshing reminder that the short film remains a valid art form. The films themselves are not the most profound thing one will ever encounter but we see themes and techniques that you rarely encounter at the megaplex. These films can afford to take a risk and at worst come off as ""quirky"".
  My only complaints are with the packaging. I wish there had been more information about the films themselves. The outside packaging only mentions the year two of the films were made for instance. Another quibble is the use of using ""star"" names as a draw for these films when more often than not the name actors only make brief cameos when the real star actor is barely mentioned.
  Overall, this is a worthwhile collection to watch and one can hope that in the future short films will get more recognition.",1072915200,3,869,4.515923566878981
