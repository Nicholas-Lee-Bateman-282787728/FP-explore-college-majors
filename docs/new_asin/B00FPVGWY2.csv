6019704,4,B00FPVGWY2,"Mike is a lonely boy at his suburban Australian school. He is a regular latecomer and clearly not one of the in crowd.  Then a new boy turns up and the English teacher pairs them up to do a project on Romeo and Juliet. New boy is the shyly handsome William who lives with his alcoholic, bullying father. He suggests doing a video remake based on classic monster tales and they go for Frankenstein and the Wolfman  which they make themselves up with none too convincing results  brilliant.

As the video develops so does their relationship and soon the burgeoning hormones of adolescence are set to take over and we are all set for another take on the star crossed lovers.

There is no real bedroom action here either but that is not the point of the story as t is a coming of age and coming out tale. I really enjoyed this independent film. It does have flaws and one is that it seemed to take a while to get going, but once it does then it soon finds its rhythm. Some of the scenes just looked too staged and yes I know they have to be but you can almost hear and action! Also some of the acting is a bit am  dram but the two leads in Tristan Barr as Mike and Lucas Linehan as William are both convincing and had proper screen chemistry.  Still despite all of the above this was a very good and credit worthy film, it is like an old T.V. that takes its time to warm up, and hence is very much worth the effort of bearing with it. I hope the team don't take too long before they have another film out.",1384646400,44,1501,4.13745704467354
6019705,1,B00FPVGWY2,"This is a bad movie, bad in the way gay movies too often are.  It is amateurishly acted, the script is weak, and the directing is naive and technically just barely competent.  Characters behave too often in ways that make no sense, that are poorly motivated or seemingly unmotivated altogether by anything that has happened before.  Purely accidental circumstances are thrown in to justify some critical events.  In short, the movie lacks narrative and psychological logic.  The plot is creaky and much of it unbelievable.  The whole kitchen sink, to use a clich, of tired gay clichs is thrown in:  dismal, broken homes, a cruel father, a distant father, one brain-damaged mother and another who is just batty.  The best friend with a crush on the lead character is a fat girl.  An older woman tries to seduce him in a video store and then, accusing him of assault, gets him fired.  Except for a kindly teacher, the rest of the women are nearly all stereotypes as well, and even the school teacher is at best a sort of caricature.  These clichs, stereotypes, and cartoonish characterizations would be bad enough in any movie, but what is worse is that the film is about a half century behind in its view of gay life and of boys growing up discovering their sexuality.  It harks back to the era (spoiler alert) of ""People like that kill themselves, don't they?""  If it were a rigorous or penetrating look at gay suicides among, say, bullied kids, it might be worth seeing.  But it is not that.  What happens feels largely arbitrary, thrown in to fit the film's need for melodrama and sentimentality.  And the end is sentimental beyond enduring in most respects.  Watch it and weep, but for all the wrong reasons.",1384560000,22,1711,4.6879194630872485

6019711,5,B00FPVGWY2,"I've watched this movie more times than I can count. Each time I appreciate it more. While I would give high ratings for all the acting, Tristan Barr deserves top awards. This moves stands apart from other first loves and even first gay loves. The ugliness and horrors they face aren't solely the common homophobia as seen in many films. Sometimes the realities of real life seem unbearable whether you are gay or straight. Also, their connection is not a result of the overactive hormones of youth, but finding a kindred spirit in a very lonely and often unfair world. Yes, this is a low budget film. Big deal. A higher budget wouldn't have significantly impacted the touching effect this film will have on you.",1511654400,6,712,4.704

The film is a play upon ideas: Romeo and Juliette updated to modern times as a  school class  project, then the idea reworked into the film itself. Really sensitively built. The two main character's downfall is caused by a minor, minor character rejected by one of the boys and then who lies and gets that boy fired from his job, leading to his mother finding a playful but private video tape the boys had made. Her discovery of the tape starts the now nearly inevitable ending. That one selfish act by the minor character destroyed almost any chance the two boys had for happiness.

I loved it when the wolfman gives Frankenstein a kiss on the cheek I just thought it was just beautiful I love this film from start to finish. The ending took me by surprise!

The two lead actors were fully invested in their characters, making their feelings visible to all. They were entirely believable. The only part of the story that didn't make sense was the one character's dramatic action near the end of the film. That character, in spite of a miserable family situation, for the most part portrayed strength and confidence.  Then, at the point where he finds love and acceptance, he gives up?  I guess that plot line was needed to bring the film to its somewhat satisfying conclusion. Among a cast of very good performances I was impressed by the actor who played Mike's father.

I can say that like so many other films this one deals with adolescence issues complicated with forming one's identity and coming to terms with the truth of that. But something I can't quite put my finger on kicks this one right to the front of the line for me. Maybe it's how William ultimately deals with his identity dilemma because it hits so damn close to home with my own struggles and plans at that age. Anyway, this is an OUTSTANDING film.

6019779,3,B00FPVGWY2,"A great but underdeveloped idea creates a disjointed movie that fails to create impact from the troubling undercurrents and metaphors. The comedy falls flat due bad pacing and delivery. The main characters do come across as likable, I just kept hoping their story would develop. An awkward young geek boy is dealing (or more correctly, not dealing) with being bullied at school, a tight but fragile friendship with a girl in love with him, sexual advances by an older female customer at his video store job and his burgeoning homosexuality. None of it adds dimension, it just happens. Into class walks a cute, kind of brooding new guy who sits next to our awkward lead. This hot new guy, would not start at any school being an outcast, though the story doesn't interplay him with other students, except when an out of nowhere prom date is necessary. The two end up teamed for the semester project to convey Romeo and Juliet in contemporary terms. They plan to create a home made monster movie to tell the story. The movie we're watching makes no sense out of that, except to set up a mawkish bit at the end that unfortunately is the most effective scene in the entire film. There's not enough chemistry between the actors to believe it but the boys develop a bond and then...
Turns out the new kid is dealing with some serious issues at home. The boys witness each others burdens but lack the ability to help each other (ineptitude by immaturity could have been a strong thematic point had the filmmakers realized what they were doing.) They become romantic, say sweet stuff, even play out boy gets-looses-gets back boy. By virtue of pacing and editing issues, the movie misses making a narrative, much less emotional connection with the conflicts and helplessness the boys are experiencing. Our lead would not be just inept but oblivious (and as a plot device) He has a clue the seriousness of his boyfriends situation, but without explanation does nothing. The character has good relations with his family, just tell someone(!?!?!?!?) The other people in the movie, the antagonists so to speak, are vital but aren't fleshed out enough to impart the gravitas intended. Though badly handled the movie has on display all the ingredients to be better than it is, much, much better. The makers simply fail to use them properly to develop character, emotional investment or justify outcomes. Uptick to 3 stars for characters and potential; down-tick to 3 for clumsy editing, unclear intentions and ineffective acting.",1420416000,,2513,4.873831775700935

I  liked the main characters, although I agree with some of the negative comments by others.  It was gratuitously bleak, and while I don't think every film should have a happy ending (life isn't that way), this tragic end did not flow from a tangible motivation.  This was not a kid trapped with no escape - as many teens are.  He'd found love with a wonderful person.  I  just didn't feel the motivation and think a sweet ending would have been the natural path.  Triumphant endings don't have to be trite or predictable.",1417824000,,532,4.585106382978723

I do not understand the need to make an ending tragic and the couple can never have a fulfilling relationship! It appears that the same industry  celebrates gay and lesbian relationships is the same industry that never allows them to flourish.",1417219200,9,516,4.722222222222222
6019786,2,B00FPVGWY2,"When I watched this movie, I thought: if it were 1985 in Smalltown Anywhere, it might be enough to simply see 2 gay young men on a screen.  After viewing the description - after watching the video - I felt somewhat less surprised, seeing that Monster Pies was conceived 19 years ago by a 15 year old. Hopelessly bleak, even by 1995 standards - that it was conceived by someone with so little life experience shows. The coupling of the idea of monsters with the ultimate tragedy, Romeo and Juliet, begs the question: where's the tragedy?

Tragedy is when some horrible outcome is unavaoidable. The protagonist is caught up in an unfolding of events that cannot be avoided - not by logic, pathos, or divine intervention. The story compels the viewer to watch, even knowing all is lost.

This is NOT a tragedy. The denoument is completely arbitrary, as is most of the narrative. I never believed the main characters were adolescents with hormones - let alone 'in love.'

If this is a taste of all the gay content available on Instant Prime: I will stick to mainstream well-made romances, and simply transpose the gender of the heroine.

I did NOT feel compelled to watch this, other than for prurient eye-candy. Had I known how this would end as it did; I would not have wasted the cost of the rental.",1415836800,3,1298,4.6017316017316015

Truly a great love story between Mike and Will, and an amazing contrast between Mike's father and Will's father. Mike's mum was there for him when he needed her the most.

6019792,5,B00FPVGWY2,"This was like ""Beautiful Thing"" (1995) meets ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005)---two extremely hopeful but depressing films.

Monster Pies a coming of age film with wonderful performances. Two high school boys (Mike and Will) work together on modernizing Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Both characters comes from tragedy - Mike lost his brother in a car accident and Will 's mum was brain damaged due to his dad's abusive ways. During the course of their project, they realize they have feelings for each other.

Most of the film was hopeful, with convincing, authentic characters, coming to terms with their sexuality. However, it all came to a tragic (and cliche) climax as with most gay and lesbian films. I was so disappointed with the tragic ending. Why can't gay and lesbian films end on a happy note?  Why must the ending be tragic and the couple can never have a fulfilling relationship? It appears that the same industry that celebrates gay and lesbian relationships is the same industry that never allows them to flourish.

On a positive side, the indie, folk/rock music was great, the visuals of the film were both stunning and gritty. It had a 1980's aesthetic, yet it was not a period piece. I was hoping for something more positive and uplifting, but the ending was depressing with no resolution.",1412121600,7,1305,4.945205479452055

6019800,4,B00FPVGWY2,"I've read some reviews that talk about the amateurish feel of this film- and there's no denying that it has some awkward moments, is a bit too heavy handed at times and tries to shoot for comedy that almost, but doesn't quite, hit the mark. There's one particular subplot which really left me scratching my head and, whilst I see how it tied in, I think it could have been omitted for a simpler strategy. You'll know this when you see it.

However, the surprise is that these things do not spoil what turns out to be an incredibly moving and thoughtful film. By the second half of this film, I was engrossed in a film that was both sad and uplifting. The leads were both likeable and the love story felt authentic, and the music is great.

I'm proud that this low budget film came from Australia- we haven't done a lot of gay themed movies. This one deserves recognition for overcoming its weaknesses in a way bigger budget international productions often can't",1408147200,,961,4.517241379310345

6019815,3,B00FPVGWY2,"I would like to give this flick 3.5 stars. I think the film's presentation is very clever indeed, i.e., layering or imbedding the Bard's great love theme/story (Romeo and Juliet) not only in one context, but in three. The first context is the mundane class reading, the second context is the student's attempt to add their own spin on the story, the third context for the two protagonists is THEIR personal ""Romeo/Juliet"" love story that happens within the second context--the student's 'spin' on the story.  For our protagonists, it becomes more than an assignment. It becomes, in fact, the reality of their lives--life imitating art--if you will, as they fall in love. That's kinda clever. The acting is sincere though a bit contrived and stagey, but that's high school, sometimes. All the key points in the Bard's telling are here as well. The budding of true love, the secretive forbidden/unconventional nature of the love; the raging parents and of course the death scene. Good effort.",1403308800,,990,5.0
6019816,1,B00FPVGWY2,"I was really troubled by this film.  It could have been beautiful (see the recent German film ""Harvest"" for example). In the mid-1980's, our beloved Vito Russo produced ""The Celluloid Closet"" - a history of the way in which Gay men and Lesbians had been depicted in film until that point in time.  It was a thorough, brilliant history that made its point - gay and lesbian characters never survived the end of a film.  Those of us who were young gay activists at the time vowed to change that - and over the next 15 years, AIDS notwithstanding, we started to see really beautiful films, depicting Lesbians and Gay men in a different way.  (Desert Hearts; Maurice).  So why are we still making films in which young gay men - fortunate enough to have found love in each other - commit suicide?  I'm not suggesting it isn't a serious problem - still.  But this is not the type of film which young gay men or lesbians should see.  We need positive outcomes.  This film is anachronistic.  It belongs to a period 30 years ago.  Or are we returning to that cinematic place again (Brokeback Mountain).  I'm not interested in going back to that time.  I want a world in which love between two men or two women triumphs in the real world, as well as on screen.",1400371200,14,1250,4.4298245614035086

I love the fact that both boys had a lot in common both from dysfunctional families and through doing a project for literature class they discovered their love for each other but in this tragic twist to the story.  Love was not enough to keep William from committing  suicide which is powerful message in itself that sometimes love does not cure all things that happen in life.,1397865600,2,606,4.383928571428571

And while the actors in the two lead roles are much more than adequate, few of the supporting players are convincing.  That said, the core of this story is a semi-sweet retelling of adolescent first love.  It is not coincidental that the plot involves a school project to rework the tale of Romeo and Juliet.  Everyone seems to want a happier denouement;  but I do not think it necessary for either Mr. Galea or Mr. Shakespeare to supply a sweet and sappy one for every tale.  While there well may be a few too many tragic elements heaped onto the shaky structure of this story, the moments of joy that we witness between the two boys provide reason enough to recommend that you see it.",1394409600,13,786,4.5

Something made me buy this film.  One gets to see what being gay is like when you're not a prince charming, a jock or popular as many gay movies out there depict.  This film has as its two leads two young teenagers with whom the average gay person can identify with.  Yes, the ending is not what I expected.  No, it will not change my mind about the film.  I think its a great film and if you enjoy a good cry and are not ashamed to say that you enjoy it, this film will certainly affect you in that way.  Its not for cynical, analytical people who have to dissect everything and try to come up with explanations about this, than and the other thing.  Why can't people just enjoy a movie for what it is....entertainment, without having to tear everything to bits.  I loved this film and the chemistry between Tristan Barr (Mike) and Lucas Linehan (Will) was the best I HAVE EVER SEEN in any gay themed movie.

(SPOILER ALERT BELOW!!)

They are both so endearing that they tear your heart out.  One has to have a heart of stone not to be moved.  And the beautiful lines that flowed out of Director/Producer/Writer Lea Galea's word processor touch the heart as well...a prime example being when Will tells Mike:""I know it sounds silly but when I'm in bed at home I try to think of something nice before I fall asleep.  It used to be really hard for me.  But lately, I've been thinking of YOU, and what a beautiful person YOU are and how good You've been to me"".

Here is a young man who masks his sensitivity beneath a tough exterior and what makes this line all the more touching is the fact that he sees Mike from the inside, not the outside as Mike is certainly not a ""pretty boy jock type"" which often grace most gay themed films.  This is what makes their chemistry super hot.

Probably the three most beautiful scenes in the film are:  1)  The garage scene where Mike has set up a film projector and a make shift screen and he surprises a blindfolded Will, who has never been to a drive in movie.  There is no dialogue...only music in this sequence...and this speaks more than words ever could.  When Mike takes the blindfold off Will and Will sees what Mike has done he is tickled to pieces.  Will has never known much happiness in his life and this is probably the happiest he will ever be and his face radiates with love, wonder, innocence and, yes, a sad pathos as well to see what Mike has done for him.  Mike, in turn, delights in Will's happiness and it is clear that he loves this boy with all his heart and soul.  Mike's face radiates as well because he is happy that Will is happy.

Scene number two is the dance scene at school.  Will leads Mike into a beautiful dance (Music by the great Pina Tuteri and the song ""Love to Love"") behind the stage curtain where no one can see them.  They look into each others eyes and convey with their eyes what words will never adequately express.  Just a sweet, innocent, pure declaration of their love.  (Who needs bedroom scenes filled with sex???)

Scene number three is the final shot of Mike and Will together under the tree.  Right before this scene Will has had a confrontation with his abusive father and runs out of the house.  Mike finds him.  Will tells him to go home because he doesn't want him to get hurt by his father.  Mike tells Will that he is not leaving and that he loves him.  Will collapses crying into Mike's arms.

Then, the next shot is them beneath the tree where both are physically and emotionally exhausted and Will whispers to Mike, ""I love you too.""  Then there is a medium long shot with Mike asleep hugging Will around his rib cage and Will, asleep too, his arms cradled around Mike's knees with both their heads leaning against each other.  Probably the most beautiful shot I have ever seen in a Romantic Film, gay or straight.

I have watched this movie practically every night since I bought it in January and I never get tired of it.  This is the most perfectly cast gay themed film I have ever seen and as I said before, Linehan and Barr's haunting performances will stay with you forever.

This is destined to become a classic and to my knowledge, Lee Galea, the Producer/Writer/Director, is working on a new film called ""The Neon Spectrum"".  I only hope he re teams Barr and Linehan in his new film and if its half as good as ""Monster Pies"", it will be incredible.",1390348800,2,4512,4.36374549819928

we have interviewed thousands of them.  This film  focus on two ""gay""

film, where already being gay can be stressful, and ended with a feeling
of emptiness.  We do not recommend this film to any gay individual.
It encourages suicide. It places suicide as an ""only way out"" from
problems that are temporary.  Hey - life, carnal life, is temporary.
Since all problems of any given person are only temporary, should
not we be focusing on a temporary positive solution?  No stars.

6019858,5,B00FPVGWY2,"Tristan Barr and Lucas Lineham as high school boys Mike and William are better than the movie, maybe. Maybe the rambling movie gave them a lot of room to be good. Either way, Monster Pies breaks your heart. The thing I didn't expect is that it appears to be a period piece, from the not too long-ago past, looks like early 90's, maybe late 80's, I suppose set small-town Australia. It's a movie about two high school boys not long ago that find each other and fall in love. In finding each other, they're lucky. It was rarer back then than I imagine it is now. But they're so honest with each other you just like them. Captivating because the characters love each other. Because of who they are, not what they are, just like Romeo and Juliet. Nice work from the entire cast. If you like friendly romance, drama, and talented young actors, give it a shot. You'll be captivated, too.",1388275200,4,881,4.444444444444445
6019859,3,B00FPVGWY2,"Mike is a shy loner, a closeted gay teen who develops an instant crush on the cute new guy in school, Will, with whom he is paired in a Literature project.  Both boys have dysfunctional families and lots of emotional baggage, and having that in common is part of their initial attraction to each other, which turns into the first love for both of them.  They struggle with self-acceptance, and then argue about how open they can be with classmates and parents.

This is a sweet indie film from Australia, which won Best film at the Melbourne Queer Film Festival.  It is an ambitious effort to show the obstacles faced by many gay teens, cleverly illustrated in the couples class project, a love story between two movie monsters who were alienated and shunned by others.  Unfortunately, the writer/director/producer/editor goes a bit overboard with the constant drama the two teens face alone, perhaps realistic for a decade or two ago, but it seems extreme in todays internet-connected world of growing acceptance and resources for LGBT youth.  This carries through to the climatic ending, which was powerful but I also found a bit unrealistic.  On the plus side, the two young actors playing the couple were capable and seemed to have a good chemistry, despite their being surrounded by the overacting in supporting roles.

Film is unrated, but would be a light R for partial male nudity.  Extras include a short, unrelated film, outtakes and the trailer.  Overall, I give it three stars out of five.",1386547200,12,1501,4.874015748031496

6019861,3,B00FPVGWY2,"It's really just ok. The story is great on premise. The sweetness between the two young main characters was nostalgic for me a lot. I actaully wanted to tear up from some of the tender moments. However, the ending sucks, I will never view another coming-of-age film and do nto know why we keep seeing them. Things have changes, not for every one, but for so many so let's focus on the good stuff.  Change the ending and you'll have a gem...",1385942400,,440,4.365853658536586
6019862,4,B00FPVGWY2,"Monster Pies is really two films in one. The story of first love and romance, made more difficult for the two lead actors because they are both male, and a depiction of what leads a person to suicide as a choice to resolve a complicated life situation.
The acting in the film is first rate. The chemistry between the two leads very believable, and the life situations that they are growing up in rings true.

More than a gay story, I found this film to be a story of alienation. Both the characters are alienated in their school environment, lack supportive adult figures in their lives, and are left to their own devices to fend for themselves. And, to boot, they are young teenagers with little knowledge of the world and skills to make their way through all the hurdles they face.
It's been said many times that teenage love is the most intense of all loves. I agree. Without any of the filters that people have because of dealing with loves that did not work out, a first love is faced head-on and all the emotions come to play.
The pacing of the film is good as well. One thing leads to another and another, and while there are several scenes that appear to be random, life is a lot like that as well. Who knows what's going to come up tomorrow, or even today, sometimes?

I read somewhere that hetrosexual relationships involve meeting ""the other"" in the relationship, while in homosexual ones, you meet ""yourself"". An interesting way to look at things. It seemed to ring true for me while watching Monster Pies.
While it would be a good idea to warn a viewer of the suicide of one of the leads in the film, it can be enjoyed both as a love story, and study of what leads someone to take their own lives. A good film throughout.",1385424000,3,1734,4.398753894080997
6019863,5,B00FPVGWY2,"WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! Monster Pies is a sensitive, intelligent and deeply moving piece of cinema. This film was made with an extremely low budget, which is definitely noticeable, but in no way mitigates the beauty of what it achieves. I will not discuss the narrative at any length as I would rather people watch the film rather than read about it. Just watch it - Monster Pies is a story you will not easily forget.",1385251200,4,414,4.533333333333333
6019864,3,B00FPVGWY2,"Monster Pies is the story of two average, slightly nerdy guys in high school who fall in love and experience practically everything guys have experienced in gay movies since The Boys in the Band - in other words: too much. Too much for THIS movie, anyway. Robert Altman could have juggled this much melodrama, but this is a small movie that staggers under an unnecessarily heavy load.

It's as if Lee Galea, the movie's writer-director-producer-executive producer-editor-etc, had a long list of things he felt compelled to include in his one shot at a feature-length gay movie, and most of them just get shoehorned into the story in places where they don't fit. The result is a painfully clumsy movie, in which the viewer gets slung around from one trauma to the next, with no sense of continuity or understanding of why all this stuff is happening. It's arbitrary, it's tiring, and it makes it very hard to care about these kids, since they live in some slightly skewed universe in which nothing makes sense.

So... why did I give this wreck of a movie three stars? Because of the two kids. Five or six times in the course of this disaster there is such sweet, strong, simple and pure affection between them that it makes all the other crap worth suffering through.

It's like gentle magic. You're wrestling with this movie, trying to enjoy it but finding that an impossible feat, and then Will and Mike look at each other, and say something so tender and so lovely that you can't help loving them.

Only when the two guys are alone together is this movie worth watching, and not always even then. Those few magical scenes last a total of maybe fifteen minutes, and they're scattered through the movie almost at random, like diamonds in a landfill. They make Monster Pies well worth watching, but it's rough going in between.",1384992000,4,1826,4.696875

How many times  have we seen  the  gay bashing/verbal abuse  of kids at school,a drunken father, broken homes  etc.  in gay  films. They are becoming tired  clichs. Despite all this,the film is  certainly better than most of the American  rubbish that poses for gay cinema. The script would have been better if it  further explored  the  two deaths in the film.
