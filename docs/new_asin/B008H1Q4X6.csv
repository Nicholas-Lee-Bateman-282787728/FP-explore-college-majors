8527833,3,B008H1Q4X6,One would think they would hybrid this one but other than that it's a good classic Anime.,1524441600,,89,4.294117647058823
8527834,4,B008H1Q4X6,"Back in 1978 or 79 I was in graduate school in NYC. I didn't own a TV, but the residence hall I lived in had one on the top floor, and I would watch at random times when I had nothing better to do. When I discovered this series I was absolutely charmed, and I made a point of watching it as often as I could. Years later, I when I needed an example of how strange and different other cultures could be, I would bring up this series, and tell people about the episode with the skeleton, or the snow planet. I'm delighted I won't have to rely on 40 year old memories any more!

For the record, since it doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere, the four DVDs in this set contain the first 38 episodes -- i.e., Seasons 1 & 2, and the first five episodes of Season 3. It looks like you can stream all six seasons (113 episodes) on Amazon Prime, but for now this is enough for me. I'm perfectly happy with the video quality. I originally watched these episodes on a 1970s era TV, and the quality here is at least as good as that!

I never though I'd see these again, until I thought to look. Hey, is the Internet amazing or what!",1489449600,2,1121,4.067873303167421
8527835,5,B008H1Q4X6,"Galaxy Express is, in my opinion, one of, if not the most, influential animes of its time and a MUST watch/own for any anime fan.
GE holds a strong place in Japanese anime history and included some high hitting anime characters such as  Captain Harlock and Space Pirate Queen Emeraldas and is a front runner for space anime as we know it today,

As a longtime fan of both the series and movies, as well as the spin off series that came out in the  last 2 decades, I can tell you that for the longest time it was IMPOSSIBLE to find ANY of these episodes without digging through torrents and forums, and even then you would be lucky to even find up to episode 120+ (It took me over 2 weeks of downloading at 100-500kb/s  YEARS ago to finally get my hands on the full series). This series was never localized, and even this release is a subbed version.
If you want to own anime history, this is it.

Edit I commented on a review about the bad quality of the release.
""While I do agree with you that it does deserve a better release (GE is my all time favorite anime and is what ""got me into"" anime all those years ago), one thing you have to understand when it comes to quality is that there honestly is not good quality of this show available, like at all. It was only ever officially released on VHS as far as I am aware, and even then never in the US or ever outside of JPN. The only versions of it I have ever seen are 360p or around there, and to improve it would require a full remastering, which with 150+ episodes would cost an absurd amount or money and require some sort of kickstarter or something of the like, and let's be fair here, GE does not hold that big of a modern audience, SADLY :( . I would love to see such a release, and would gladly throw $100-300 at a BluRay 480-1080 HD full series release, but it will not happen unless some ""good"" company bought the license to release, and even then they would run into the same issue this company did, low sales for an actual expensive release (somewhat).

8527836,5,B008H1Q4X6,These DVD'S are great.  Just like what we watched when we lived in Japan.,1478217600,,73,4.214285714285714
8527837,5,B008H1Q4X6,It was everything that I expected and was worth the money.  I can only hope that S-more entertainment releases the rest of the series.,1457136000,2,134,4.583333333333333
8527838,4,B008H1Q4X6,It's hard subtitled. Big deal.  Most people cant speak Japanese in this country anyway.  The picture quality isn't amazing but its not awful.  From these reviews I was expecting it to be VHS quality or something. Amazing show.  Leiji is a genius.  It's a shame there won't be a part 2!,1441324800,4,285,4.509803921568627
8527839,4,B008H1Q4X6,"I am a big fan of the show, however the tv series has never been released in its entirety in the USA.
When I was a kid i used to watch the japanese eps subtitled in english through the the lease time Japanese language FCI  tv programming block in NYC (it was a UHF channel--i think it was ch. 31.) The series itself is excellent and i would highly recommend it to anyone interested in thought provoking, philosophical anime.

Unfortunately, S'more Entertainment went on record saying they were putting Volume 2 on indefinite hiatus--translation they gave up on this series and there will be no further releases. Their quote was that to go to the trouble of releasing a 4 dvd set and getting only 2000 sales was extremely disappointing and a loss of money. Link to article: [...]

Perhaps if they had taken the time to actually make this a quality set they would have sold more units of the first volume. The hardcore anime community is a small circle and there is a rabid demand for classic anime like Matsumoto's Galaxy Express 999, however bad word of mouth will kill any project really quickly. I think it is fair to say that fans were extremely disappointed by the low quality of the release and S'more ended up paying the price. However it is unfortunate that, after all is said and done, the complete series still remains unreleased in the USA.",1403481600,5,1350,4.570247933884297
8527840,1,B008H1Q4X6,The video quality is pretty bad. It looks to be about the same as the Crunchyroll stream which was 360p resolution I believe. It also has hardsubs. Another reason not to by this is that S'more Entertainment has no plans to release future box sets due to poor sales of this release. [...],1379116800,12,287,4.433962264150943
8527841,5,B008H1Q4X6,"I found absolutely, nothing, wrong with this dvd set,picture quality or the sub-titles,you should be happy that someone finaly released it,in north america at all. i have waited a long time for this series. i can not wait, till the next set come's out.",1374624000,4,252,4.75
8527842,1,B008H1Q4X6,"I have been looking forward to the Galaxy Express TV series ever since it was announced for U.S. release, but man, this is not exactly what I was expecting. First, the video quality is compressed to death! It's comparable to the watching the series on the streaming service Crackle (I'm not joking). The reason why the video is so horrible is that S'more Entertainment has crammed nine to ten episode per disc, which doesn't offer a lot of headroom for a decent video transfer. The second strike against this release is the series is hard subtitled! You can not remove them because they're part of the video. The last time I bought anime with hard subtitles was on VHS. I'm very disappointed with S'more Entertainments handling of this classic animated TV series. With all of the delays I really though they were going to release a quality product. Maybe down the line somebody else will do this TV series right (Discotek Media please!).",1353369600,41,937,4.754601226993865
