Just ashame that the western people were not allowed to be anything else than tourists.",1398211200,,167,5.0
8238120,1,B0010OIPAM,"Any report from or about Tibet must contain the fact that Tibet is an occupied nation and is and has suffered unspeakable torment from China's domination.  China's criminal repression of Tibet constitutes crimes against humanity.  China has done everything possible to eliminate Buddhism in Tibet by destroying over 6000 monasteries, murder or torture and jailing of countless monks and nuns, and systematic infusion of Han Chinese to delute and eliminate Tibet culture.  It is unlikely pilgrims would have anything authentic to visit or see.",1318377600,2,542,5.428571428571429

8238122,2,B0010OIPAM,"This documentary of a pilgrimage to holy sites of Central Tibet in 2002 with Lama Zopa and 50 (!) of his Western students could have made for an interesting story, but it turns out it will probably appeal mainly to people from that group (and the wider FPMT family). Tibet is a wonderful land - a mix of tough, strong  and simple landscapes, peoples and religious devotions, and it has an interesting and engaging history. Unfortunately this film never gets much beyond the surface drama of this group of modern devotees. The filming is okay, but a bit amateurish, and the pilgrimage looks to be rather tame as well - no feeling for the kind of spiritual challenges a pilgrim often has (my pilgrimage experiences have always involved some form of death-rebirth, and not remained all idealistic and romantic like this one does). There is a lot of idealized projection onto Tibet these days (well, for the past century or so, by both Westerners and Tibetans), but I find this ""Magic and Mystery"" view of Tibet tiresome and superficial. Below the surface of Tibet's simple and austere land and culture is a rich and complex history - it is, like anywhere, a mix of good and bad, silly and sublime. This documentary conveys none of this complexity and ambiguity.",1271289600,17,1258,4.744292237442922

This is a great companion to the Discovering Buddhism DVD. This documentary follows one of the great Lamas of our time. Lama Zopa Rinpoche leads students to the famous pilgrimage sites of Tibet. The high production values gives you a feeling of accompanying the group on their journey. I highly recommend this DVD.",1204243200,11,471,7.137931034482759
8238124,5,B0010OIPAM,"This DVD is super and shows what a trip to Tibet should be like. I hope that one day i get a chance to go to Tibet in the presence of a spiritual expert like Lama Zopa Rinpoche who can transform a sight seeing tour into a mystic journey.

Lama Zopa's explanation of all the holy places in the DVD was inspiring and the DVD really conveys the special quality of the places when viewed from a different angle. The soundtrack was fantastic and the sights will remain in my memory until I see them for real.",1202774400,20,503,4.185567010309279
