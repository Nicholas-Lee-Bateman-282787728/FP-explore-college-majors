8178605,5,6305371660,I finally found this movie & boy was it worth the wait. If you enjoy your kung fu movies fast paced & full of action this one is a must buy. I rate this movie in my top ten of all time. Up there with Warriors 2 & Shaolin Intruders. Its stars the two best leg fighters of all time in John Lui & Hwang Jang lee. This is a hardcore Martial Arts extravaganda. Good revenge storyline & plenty of fights. I highly recommend it,1019260800,,420,3.9529411764705884
8178606,5,6305371660,"This is without a doubt an all time classic my friends.  featuring some of the best kicking to ever grace the screen. a non stop barrage of fight scenes every so often interrupted with some of the worst dialougue i've ever heard.  If you want a good movie, go away,  if you want great picture quality, leave right now,  but if you are looking for a chinese T.J kirsch kicking (...) and his monkey boy friend taking names, then this is the flick for you!  Forbidden treasures is right, this movie is so good it should be against the law...  Hot Hands Hiyati better look out! not even ""blackbelt"" Joe Inzero can handle this guy,
to sum it up: Malinky to the EXTREME!  mama",1008201600,,670,4.354838709677419
8178607,3,6305371660,"This movie is originally titled Secret Rivals, good movie mainly due to the presence of Hwang Jang Lee, the two good guys Wong Tao and John Liu I don't like that well, which is why it didn't get a five, they could have picked two better heroes, this movie would have been great. Not much of a plot except good guys teaming up to whip the bad guy.",974073600,,346,4.102941176470588
