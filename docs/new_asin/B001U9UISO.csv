8343239,2,B001U9UISO,"The acting by all the characters is very good, but the movie suffers from a poorly written/structured script. Some of the scenes offer no transition and it can be confusing to follow the story. It's a plateau all throughout the first 3/4 of the movie (boring, no rising complications). If not for the acting skills of the characters, I would've turned it off.",1340236800,,359,4.714285714285714

acting very good.  had some trouble figuring out the cast as they related to the story.  would have rated higher if i had been able to understand them.
 would be nice if description said no subtitles.",1245110400,4,219,4.425
