8256847,2,B000T2V8UU,"A good performance from Carlinhos and company. Excellent wide-screen video. But the audio mix is rather lame and the video editing is horrendous. Closeup cut after closeup cut, mostly focusing on faces - no cut lasting longer than about two-three seconds. It's all flash. Your eyes never get to actually focus on a single instrument or player. Were the editors getting paid per cut? This constant flashing of image after image renders the video virtually unwatchable.

Disappointing.",1188000000,2,483,5.2727272727272725
