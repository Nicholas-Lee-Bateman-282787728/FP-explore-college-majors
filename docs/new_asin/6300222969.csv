7806733,5,6300222969,I love this tape.  I have had this tape and let someone borrowed it and did not return it.  I am so happy to have it again,1358640000,,122,3.4814814814814814
7806734,5,6300222969,"I won't lie - it is a tough workout but so worth the effort!!  I have been exercising consistently for over 20 years and I have tried other leg exercises, including Leg Magic.  Nothing reduced the size of my hips and thighs like this workout.  I always come back to it.  I highly recommend this if you want to firm up your lower half!!",1313798400,,335,4.1875
7806735,5,6300222969,"Scary scary scary! This 15 minute shock treatment for the legs is definitely for quite advanced exercisers. Six months won't cut it for you. You need more experience than that to master this workout. To me, this is Greggain's scariest workout. I have yet to conquer it, but I highly recommend it because in only 15 minutes, she will redefine your legs if you commit to it. If you've got bad knees, then use a thick bed pillow to rest your knees on, because the entire workout is done on all fours. If it ever becomes too easy for you which I doubt, then use ankle weights.",1249776000,,572,4.355140186915888
7806736,5,6300222969,This workout creeps me out. I haven't tried it yet because I'm working my way up to it. This is the scariest lower body workout I've ever seen. But it last only 12 minutes. So you can get more benefits with Joanie in 12 minutes than you can with anybody else in even 2 hours! If you got big balls then go for it!,1231804800,,312,3.890625
7806737,1,6300222969,"Despite what may be claimed on the cover, this tape does not have a real warm up/stretch section.  Her definition of a warm-up is some squats.  You then spend a lot of time on all fours without being prompted to sit back into ""child's pose"" to take care of your shoulders and back.  If you are into the compulsive masochistic type  of workout, you may get into this tape.  I'll be doing my other workouts instead of this one.
(By the way, it is about 15 minutes.)",1083542400,,463,4.275862068965517
7806738,4,6300222969,"This is a killer workout, so if you're not used to working your legs, take it easy at first.  I only did half of it and my legs hurt for three days!  It's a quick 15 minutes and really sculpts your legs fast.",997833600,,208,3.813953488372093
