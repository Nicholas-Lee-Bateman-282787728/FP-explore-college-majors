6937366,2,B00RZ9EOPG,"With Camille gone & Fidel whisked away, the show takes a dive. ""Floar-ah nce"" & J.P. who replace them are colorless & 1 dimensional characters.
Camille had a casual class & was at least somewhat interesting. Floar-ah nce, (they make a big deal about pronouncing her name that way!) on the other hand, starts out very proper & business like, then suddenly a she starts  Sporting  Daisy Duke short shorts , off the shoulder blouses & form fitted dresses that zip up the back.

This is the first series when I can never guess who done it though there are plenty of hints - is always a surprise and a clever ending. With all the murder mysteries on tv it is amazing that this one is so original in plot.  All the characters including the suspects are always excellent and intruguing and throw up a good smoke screen to make it hard to identify the killer.  Beautiful scenery and photography as well.",1479168000,2,562,4.427184466019417

6937397,4,B00RZ9EOPG,"The departure of not one but two series regulars is often the death knell for a television series.
When, for example, the actors who had been a staple of the brilliant British detective series ""New Tricks"" began leaving the show for various reasons its audience diminished despite the fact the men and women who joined the cast to replace them did very nice work.
The result: ""New Tricks"" lasted one final season with its completely new cast and was then cancelled.
I hope that's not the fate awaiting ""Death in Paradise"" because I have very much enjoyed this comedy/drama and I think its new cast is doing a very good job of bringing to life the small police force of Honore on the Caribbean island of St. Marie.
This season saw the departure of the beautiful Sara Martins, who played Sgt. Camille Bordey for the first three seasons, and Gary Carr, who played Sgt. Fidel Best. The writers - wisely, I think - did not kill either of those two characters off the way they did when Ben Miller, who played Detective Inspector Richard Poole, left the series after two seasons. The writers handled his departure in a clever way by having him, in essence, solve his own murder but that was a one-off and is not something that could be repeated. In this season's series Martins goes off to Paris to work and Carr has taken a new position with a nearby island's police force. That leaves the door open for them to reappear at some point in the future, which could make for some interesting story lines.
Season Four is notable, in my opinion, because it is more character driven than the previous three. Kris Marshall's character - Detective Inspector Humphrey Goodman - has a crush on Bordey but ultimately has to allow her to pursue her dream of going to Paris. Throughout the season he wrestles with that choice and then has to deal with the fact that she is no longer nearby. Danny John-Jules as Officer Dwayne Myers also gets an opportunity to deepen his character when two new officers join the force. A laid-back cop, Myers has provided many of the lighter touches that ""Death in Paradise"" has become known for over the years. This season, however, he also has an opportunity to dig a little deeper, proving that - when all is said and done - he takes the job pretty seriously.
Newcomers Josephine Jobert, as Sgt. Florence, and Tobi Bakare as Officer JP Hooper, have blended into the cast replacing Martins and Carr. The writers have consciously not made them carbon copies of their predecessors, which is a wise decision on their part. Jobert is a beautiful woman but she does not resemble Martins, who has supermodel looks. Quietly sexy, she plays her part as Sgt. Florence in a much more understated way than did Martins. Bakare, meanwhile, brings a quiet intensity to his role.
If I have a quibble with this season's episodes, it is the fact the writers have relied too often on the same formula to end each show. Each episode this season ends with a dramatic gathering of all the suspects in the case followed by Goodman's exposure of the villain. That worked well for Hercule Poirot back in the day but too much of a good thing is, well, too much.
That said, I still find this a wonderful series with great characters, an exotic locale, and very nice performances by a very good cast.
The verdict: 4.5 stars.",1477526400,7,3312,4.60575296108291
6937398,5,B00RZ9EOPG,"I think the losses of Camille, Poole and Fidel were sad (especially Poole) but the replacements are excellent and do give the show a fresh new atmosphere. This may turn out to be the secret to a long-running series!

Dwayne is the un(der)-sung heart of the show. We need him! He provides continuity. Let's hope he and the producers can keep it together!

But I was completely hooked and kept watching.  It was nice to see Humph finally stand up for himself to his father at the end of season 4.

6937425,4,B00RZ9EOPG,"Everyone seemed to be bored in season three. They solved the problem by Episode 5 in season four. A classic case of addition through subtraction.

Sending the character of Camille off to Paris was the first sensible thing the producers have done since Season 2. The exit of Ben Miller was simply wretched. Without Camille the character of Goodman is stronger.  Goodman is now a detective, first and foremost instead of a potential suitor to Camille and a whiny one at that.

Camille and Richard were a. pair of opposites that matched in an odd way.  They were fun to watch as we like to watch Beatrice and Benedick. Goodman and Camille do not share this.  Goodman is not up to sparring with Camille, but the character of Poole intentionally, or unintentionally was a match for Camille (Poole irritated Camille, and Camille confounded Poole).  The character of Camille was pretty much a dead end for the series.

Camille's replacement, Josphine Jobert as Florence Cassel, is a better match in terms of her easy and natural manner of managing the boss. Jobert lights up the screen with her presence. The character of Florence Cassel is a very pleasant surprise and well played by Jobert. Cassel as we see in her management of Dwayne and later Goodman, is a quiet and smart addition to the team with a wisdom that seems beyond her years. There are some possibilities for this character.

Fidel's replacement works with Dwayne's character in ways that are more interesting",1470009600,3,1468,4.820717131474104

6937448,5,B00RZ9EOPG,"Welcome, again, to the Caribbean island of Saint Marie and the Honore police department. The rumpled, clumsy and brilliant DCI Humphrey Goodin leads the team. Sergeant Fidel Best has already left (since Season 3) to take a job on the island of St. Lucia. Goodin's other sergeant, Camille Bordey, will break everybody's hearts by leaving in the 4th episode of Season 4. I thought they did a very good job with story-arc of Camille's decision to leave.

I thoroughly enjoyed Season 4. These are well-crafted mysteries. Red herrings. Impossible crimes. It's not just fun viewing, it's good viewing. It's puzzling viewing. And there is a lot of comedy, too. It may take a while to get used to new people, but it works for me.

The 8 episodes of Season 4 of ""Death in Paradise"" originally aired January/February 2015. All together, they total a wonderful 472 minutes of mystery viewing. That's a lot of minutes compared to some series. If you buy the DVD set, the episodes are presented in 16:9 anamorphic and stereo. English subtitles are available for all episodes. There are no bonus extras on the DVDs. I would love to hear more about the music used in the program.

The TV show as aired, and on the DVDs, has no episode titles.

Episode One
Tonight is Saint Marie's Fete Mouri. As Camille tells Humphrey, ""It's the Voodoo festival of the dead, when we summon any spirits still trapped on earth and command them to move on to the afterlife."" It may be the perfect night for a sance, and Elias Thomson, owner of the Thomson Rum Distillery, holds one at his house. He wants to expand the distillery, which means tearing down some old buildings. One of those, the old barrel store house, is said to be haunted by a woman who was killed there in the 1850's.  His workers refuse to go into it, much less tear it down, unless the murdered woman's spirit, Mama Beth, is exorcised.

A closed room, five people holding hands around the table, curtain drawn on the only window. Then the candle is blown out and Elias is stabbed with a very real knife. As no one let go of anybody's hand, it can only be the work of the vengeful Mama Beth. Right?

Episode Two
Jake Peters, former pro surfer, now runs the Sandy Cove Surf School with his wife. He's in his shed, working on a surfboard when his best friend, Dr. Karl Slater, arrives for poker night. That's why Karl is on hand to break down the locked door of the shed after everybody hears a shot.  There's Jake, lying on the floor, dead of a close-range gunshot wound. But there's no weapon with him, and no way to get in and out of the locked shed. This is that mystery classic, the Locked Room Mystery!

Episode Three
On a sandy beach, the Saint Marie Heritage Society is practicing their reenactment for tomorrow's anniversary. For 461 years before, the first French explorers landed on Saint Marie. They go so far in their verisimilitude that they forage among the plants to make an authentic stew. Unfortunately, they all get food poisoning, and one, Francis Davison even dies from it. It would be ruled a tragic accident except that Davison had called Goodin an hour before to say, ""Somebody is out to get me.""

Episode Four
At the swanky Dolore Sands Hotel, Jenny and her three bridesmaids are on the last day of her ""hen party"" - five days of partying without the guys before she ties the knot with Simon.  At the end of the day, Jenny heads up to her room for a bath, the water strewn with flower petals. She never makes it out of the tub and they find her the next morning drowned. And it seems another impossible crime.
(The only part I dislike about this episode are the terms ""hen party"" and ""the hens"".)

Episode Five
Sergeant Florence Cassell is promoted out of uniform. Now she's Detective Sergeant and can wear shorts and her hair down. She isn't Camille, but I think she does  a good job as Goodin's foil. Taking her place as Sergeant is TJ Hooper -  he's the sober-sided counterpart to Constable Dwayne Myers. The new team has to jump right in, with a celebrity murder.

Twenty years ago, the UK band ""Flowers of Progress"" had one hit album and then dissolved. Cheryl Moore, the band manager, brings them back to Saint Marie to record a new album at the same studio where they put together the first. There's a surfeit of suspects when one of the band turns up dead. As Goodin says, ""Stevie Smith, habitual wild child and lead singer. Lived life on the edge. And died the ultimate rock 'n' roll death, electrocuted in a swimming pool.""

Episode Six
Tomorrow is the hotly contested final of the 2015 Inter-Island Beach Volleyball Championship. Team Saint Marie will battle their fiercest rival, Team Isla Jonas. Both teams arrive at the practice volleyball beach. But Isla Jonas' best player isn't there. They find out why when a teammate finds her dead body at the back of the team jeep. Family dynamics are important in this episode.

""Literary inaccuracies aside, we all create our own Frankensteins.""

Episode Seven
Bill Williams runs outdoor team bonding experiences for corporations. This week he has a group lead by Annette Burgess, CEO of an online travel agency. When she's found dead of a bullet wound, Constable Dwayne Myers spends a lot of time trying to get her hotel room safe open. When he does, all they find is an envelope holding an unused roll of scotch tape. Why would she lock that up? And why would that get her killed?

Episode Eight
Humphrey's 71 year-old father is coming to visit, which sets the detective all in a tizzy. For good reason, when, for example, his dad urges Humphrey to ""put an end to this protracted and, frankly, quite ridiculous, gap year,"" and come home to England. But in the meanwhile, there's a job to do. Jack Harmer was in a courthouse holding cell when someone managed to shoot him. The Commissioner puts on just a little pressure to find out who killed a man in police custody.

If, by any chance, you haven't seen the first three seasons of ""Death in Paradise"" yet, you're missing a treat:

The other new characters must go and are in the way;, except for Humphrey. He was a wise choice and I grew to like him. The inspector and Dwayne must remain. They add the flair the series needs! A great series if they bring back Dwayne and Camile!",1439942400,8,376,4.385714285714286

I loved Poole and Camille, but now they're gone.  Who's next, Dwayne?  I do not like Goodman or the new girl trying to look like Camille enough to hang around.",1439164800,10,301,3.901639344262295
6937455,3,B00RZ9EOPG,"With Sarah Martins' departure, Death in Paradise has lost the interpersonal/romantic subtext that made the series more interesting than the standard police procedural. As a result, the episodes in the last half of this season have little to offer beyond the now-somewhat-worn plot device of bringing all the suspects into a room and gradually describing how one of them did the nefarious deed. Those expositions have gotten too long, and there's little to counterbalance them. The little human-interest elements involving the other cast members seem contrived and forced, and Kris Marshall, as DI Humphrey Goodman, seems a bit less engaged.

Camille's replacement, Florence, is played by Josephine Jobert, who, in her first few episodes, has the same problem that many actors have with dialogue that's not in their own native language: it seems forced and artificial to hear a person with a strong accent speaking in perfect, syntactically- and idiomatically-correct English. Martins had this problem in Season 1, but eventually overcame it, and, in her last few episodes, seemed very comfortable with the language, and with the obviously flirtatious but seemingly innocent role that the writers used to keep us (and DI Goodman) guessing about when/if she and Humph would get together romantically.

It wouldn't work well for Florence to simply fall into the same will-they/won't-they role, of course (not this season, at least, and she does seem much too young for Humph...), but that leaves her in limbo; another smart and pretty detective on the team, charged with helping Humphrey to find his notes and to avoid bumping into that flowerpot, but that's not quite enough to flesh out her character. Her stilted language (which is more the writers' fault), and her inexperience with comedy, lend an awkwardness to many of her scenes.

Overall, Death in Paradise has treaded water for the last half of Series 4. Here's hoping that Season 5 comes up with some new twists and challenges for all the cast members. The audience certainly doesn't want it to be completely believable - we want Fantasy Island, after all, not Criminal Minds Caribbean Edition - but that will require bringing back the sense of fun that the series has lacked in recent episodes.",1438128000,20,2253,5.133514986376022

6937459,5,B00RZ9EOPG,"Loved the originals and love the replacements. I was shocked and horrified when the original detective was murdered - I adored him and just like you do in real life I kept hoping it was all a joke or a mistake.  But his replacement is very endearing besides being happier in the tropics and with the island ways.  And, yes, I love Camille but I think that actress has gone on to other roles where I enjoy her as much- one in a French series entitled The Detectives.  You can see it on MHZ Worldview.",1432252800,36,499,4.231578947368421
6937460,5,B00RZ9EOPG,"Camille's replacement is not a perfect replacement (how could it possibly be?) but OK and I think that she will expand and grow into the part (She IS pretty, intelligent and well made!).

 I am beginning to appreciate Gary Carr's replacement; Nothing personal, but in my opinion, he just didn't fit in originally; too scatterbrained and irresponsible! However, his character seems to be coming alive and he is giving Dewain a real run for his money and is beginning to contribute well into the operation of the team. He seems to grow on you and is becoming very likeable.

After reading a published interview with 'Camille', I get a strong feeling that a great part of her problem with this production is bad preparation and management in directing and management in the daily routine of shooting the series which results in a serious wearing down of the performers.

Want a real kick out of life, wait until you see how Harry meets Humphrey's father in episode 8!!! Harry has become a really endearing character in this series and if he disappeared, I would seriously miss him (I even nicknamed my really great Toyota Camry 'Harry' in his honor).",1430611200,40,1147,4.777777777777778
