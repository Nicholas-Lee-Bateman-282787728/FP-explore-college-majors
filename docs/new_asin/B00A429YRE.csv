5381531,4,B00A429YRE,My son LOVES Slugterra so this was the perfect birthday present. He has already watched it several times! Great gift idea!,1363478400,2,122,4.857142857142857
5381532,5,B00A429YRE,"My daughter is almost seven and she loves this show. She wants a Slugterra birthday party! She likes how the slugs in the show require being treated humanely (unlike the ghoul slugs which need healing) and she likes how the slugs just want to be hard workers and do what it is they know how to do. She is so thrilled and excited when a slug hits 100 miles per hour and reaches its potential for greatness. Good thing they have ""Trixie"" in the Shane Gang so the girls have someone to identify with. Trixie will come on and my daughter will say ""watch"" as if something terribly important is happening. Although this show does have slug shooter things that look like guns the real power the show has for my girl is the power of transformation, cooperation, and the possibility of healing for those we might otherwise give up on. Way to go, Slugterra!",1360713600,9,847,4.470967741935484
5381533,5,B00A429YRE,"Slugterra Return of the Shane Gang DVD contains 5 episodes along with Bonus features. This series is based on science fiction with lots of adventure. These 5 episodes explain Eli's journey through Slugterra along with his friends Trixie, Kord and Pronto in their effort to defeat the evil mastermind known as Dr. Black.

Dr. Black is the one responsible for disturbing the peace, by transforming normal slugs into vicious Ghouls. Making friends and finding slugs along the way. Their efforts to stop Dr. Black create entertaining and riveting plots with each episode.

Slugterra is about an underground world 100 miles below the earth's surface. The main source of power and entertainment are slugs that when launched at 100 mph they transform.  The animation effects during transformation are my 10 year olds favorite to watch on the DVD.

Very few top dwellers have ever seen Slugterra; however families known as the Shane's are the guardians of both sides. This responsibility falls on the shoulders of young Eli Shane who has to keep the peace all throughout Slugterra. My boys are 10 and 13 and could not wait to watch Slugterra including bonus features.",1360627200,4,1159,5.020833333333333
5381534,5,B00A429YRE,"I had never seen this series before, but was interested to see what it was all about. I have say that I was impressed with the writing in the series, I am the artistry in the cartoon itself. Also, the writing in the DVD itself was quite strong, and though I would see many boys flocking to the series, my girls also enjoyed as well. The DVD was fun and about my girls to experience something new which opened their eyes to a new series that now they want to find more of.

5381545,4,B00A429YRE,"In 2012, the new sci-fi action animated series ""SlugTerra"" made its debut on Disney XD in October 2012.

An American/Canadian co-production created by Asaph Fipke (co-founder of Nerd Corps Entertainment and worked on series such as ""Beast Wars"", ""Beast Machines"", ""ReBoot"", ""Heavy Gear"" and ""Max Steel""), the animation is produced by Fipke's Animation studio Nerd Corps Entertainment.

With 22 episodes aired on television, the first five episodes will be released on DVD titled ""SlugTerra: Return of the Shane Gang"" in February 2012.

""SlugTerra"" is a series that begins with Will Shane, the protector of SlugTerra taking on his arch nemesis Dr. Thaddius Blakk.  As Dr. Blakk tried to unleash an evil power using a ghoul slug in SlugTerra that would envelop Will Shane, Will uses his blaster to shoot out his slug Burpee to find his young son Eli to find a letter before he is enveloped.

Burpee shows young Eli a letter that his father left to him, just in case something bad has happened to him.  Will wrote about how many in the long line of the Shane family had ventured to SlugTerra, to protect the area which is located 100 miles below Earth.  But the condition if he chooses to accept, is that he can begin his adventure as a Shane in SlugTerra when he turns 15-years-old but also that he must keep the existence of Earth as he knows it, a secret from those living in SlugTerra.

Fast forward to a teenage Eli, who decides to venture to SlugTerra, knowing that he may not be able to get back home.  And upon arriving, he arrives to his fathers hideout where his weapons, gear and mecha beast vehicles are located.

While his father left him a blaster, he must find his own slugs which is a key to surviving in SlugTerra.  How each slug has a special ability and gets stronger over time.  If the owner bonds with the slug, the better the relationship.

Eli eventually meets several people who try to teach him the way of living in SlugTerra and join him as part of the Shane Team.  Pronto the Magnificent is a molenoid tracker, so he says.  But he seems to get everyone in trouble but also manages to help him the team once in awhile.  Beatrice ""Trixie"" Sting is filming a documentary on slugs but she is also wonderful in fighting competitions and is great strategist.  And there is Kord Zane, a huge cave troll who loves technology, and is a mechanic who loves upgrading blasters and vehicles.

Meanwhile, when Dr. Thaddius Blakk and his group find out a Shane is back in SlugTerra, he is determined of ridding Eli as he did with his father.  But Blakk has found away to convert innocent slugs to evil ghouls and trying to recruit people to cause havok in SlugTerra.

Here are the following episodes featured in ""SlugTerra: Return of the Shane Gang"":

  EPISODE 1: The World Beneath Our Feet, Part 1 - Eli goes down to SlugTerra and meets Pronto the Magnificent, Trixie and Kord Zane for the first time.  And his new friends try to help him prepare for the slug duel tournament.
  EPISODE 2: The World Beneath Our Feet, Part 2 - Eli reaches the final of the tournament but before his final, he and the group meet Dr. Thaddius Blakk.  And finds out the truth of what Dr. Blakk has done with slugs.
  EPISODE 3: The Trade - Eli finds out that in order to upgrade equipment, sellers trade equipment for slugs.  But can Eli trade the slugs that he cares about?
  EPISODE 4: The Slug Out - Eli must find Redhook, the Blastersmith after his slugs become too powerful for his old blaster and breaks it down.  But when they arrive to Redhook's village, the Shane Gang finds out that the village is being tormented by a group that works for Dr. Blakk.
  EPISODE 5: Deadweed - What happens when Eli and the Shane Gang get trapped in a haunted underground location and what does that location have to do with Dr. Blakk?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""SlugTerra"" is presented a series that blends CG animation with hand draw animation.  Produed by Nerd Corps Entertainment, the style of ""SlugTerra"" almost has an anime mashed with Disney style.  Colors are vibrant and colorful, character designs for the humanoid characters are well done but also for the slugs which are cute or crazy or mean looking slugs. But the characters are well-shaded and art backgrounds are also nicely done.

Mechanical design is also created quite well from the beast vehicles to the blasters, for the most part, ""SlugTerra"" is a series that looks good as one can expect on DVD.

The series is presented in Dolby Digital and dialogue and sound effects are clear.  And while there are no subtitles, closed captions are included.

EXTRAS:

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have to admit that when I first hear about ""SlugTerra"", the first thing that came to my mind was ""not another Pokemon type of anime series""!

Having seen series such as ""Monsuno"" and ""Kaijudo"", I was curious to see how ""SlugTerra"" would differentiate from these other titles.  And sure enough, ""SlugTerra"" turns out to be a fantastic animated series.

It does have the similarity to Pokemon, in the case of ""SlugTerra"", collecting Slugs with special abilities and dueling other competitors with their slugs.

But where ""SlugTerra"" becomes interesting is its primary antagonist.  Dr. Blakks is the person responsible for the death of Eli Shane's father and he is taking innocent Slugs and converting them to ghoul slugs, making them evil and stronger but doing so against their will.  Everyone partnered with Dr. Blakks look evil and hard to beat.

But its the protagonist Eli that makes this series so interesting.  He has a lot to learn but his compassion towards slugs and his belief in his team is optimistic.  May it be outdueling Dr. Blakks people or saving slugs, Eli Shane and the members of the Shane Gang are quite intriguing.  Each are different but yet they are able to come together and become one heck of a team.  Pronto is clumsy and unpredictable, Trixie is great at observing and Kord is great in upgrades and mechanics.  And somehow this team manages to achieve a good level of success.

Each episode is fresh and quite different and so, it's not as banal as other series.  Also, the look and feel of the characters is much different thanks to the use of CG and its pretty cool character and mechanical design.

While only five episodes are featured on the ""Return of the Shane Gang"" DVD, I'm really looking forward in watching more episodes.  I watched the series along with my nine-year-old and he was really getting into it and also asking me if there was a toyline associated with the series (which I don't see any toys available at this time).  But he really enjoyed the action and also the humor associated with the series.  But also the positivity of its main protagonist!  And he's not perfect, just a regular teenage guy wanting to make a difference, respect people and the slugs but following his father's footsteps.

Overall, ""SlugTerra: Return of the Shane Gang"" is a pretty solid animated series for children or the young at heart.  Cool characters,  well-written stories with plenty of action and humor and a lot of awesome potential!  Parents looking for a safe animated series on DVD for their children who love action and sci-fi, will definitely enjoy ""SlugTerra: Return of the Shane Gang"".
