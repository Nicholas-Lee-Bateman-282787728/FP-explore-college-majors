5672983,5,B00BTRKMNI,"There are really two types of people who would be reading this review: those who've never seen Archer and are wondering if it's good, and those who've seen the first 3 seasons and are wondering if the 4th rises to the same offensively comedic standard. Answers are yes and yes.

If you've never watched Archer, jump right in. Although there are inside jokes that build through the series, the episodes are largely self contained. Archer is a drunk spy... there, you're up to speed. You can jump into any season or episode and enjoy it. You will also have the overpowering urge to then start the series from the beginning, so you won't miss anything. The show, though a cartoon, is definitely not for kids. At all. Even more so than something like Family Guy, though if you like Family Guy you will probably also like Archer.

So basically if you like offensively adult cartoons, and the idea of a drunk misogynist spy blowing stuff up sounds like good fun, this show is awesome and you have been deprived by not watching it sooner. This show, much like a Will Ferrell movie, is just as funny (often funnier) the 2nd through 100th times through. This makes it a good pick to actually buy on DVD or Bluray, as you'll find yourself watching it over and over, unlike something like Entourage or Lost that you watch once and then it sits.

If you've seen Archer's first 3 seasons, season 4 simply continues the trend. Same crazy schemes, same dysfunction, same jokes. Nothing about that should imply a bad thing. This is simply the same great level of humor that we've come to expect (nay, deserve).",1371772800,41,1594,4.605633802816901
5672984,5,B00BTRKMNI,"""...love Sterling Archer?"" Or, as I'm sure he'd describe himself, ""Women love me. Men want to be me. Well, except for Cyril. And probably my mother.""

I've been an Archer fan since first catching episodes via Netflix, and already have the DVD versions of the first three seasons. While I do think that some parts of season 4 weren't as strong as, say, The Heart of Archness (S3) -- and nearly all of season 3 was great -- season 4 still has several of what I consider classic episodes.

And my definition of 'classic' basically translates as, ""Do I want to see it again?""

Among my favorites:
- Legs: Ray gives in to Krieger's nagging and allows himself to be fitted with bionic legs, much to Archer's panicked consternation.
- Once Bitten: Archer is bitten in his perineum and suffers intense hallucinations.
- The Papal Chase: Archer and the ISIS team try to prevent the Pope from being assassinated...and it so happens the Pope looks -exactly- like Woodhouse. Look for Archer disguising himself as a very familiar and iconic Italian-American priest from SNL, right down to the mustache and tinted oversized glasses.

And of course the season finale: Sea Tunt (parts 1 and 2) -- a crossover episode that does everything but specifically mention ""Sealab 2021,"" a cult show from the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. With Captain Murphy voiced by 'Mad Men' actor Jon Hamm, doing a terrific job of copying the original Harry Goz's voice and mannerisms. (In short, he's as crazy as Cheryl.) In this one, note the name on the toppled soft drink machine...

Anyway, I'll have this on pre-order, but figured there was no harm in writing a review on the episodes themselves for folks considering whether to get it or not.",1367193600,16,1711,4.766891891891892
5672985,5,B00BTRKMNI,I never heard or seen Archer on television. Saw it on Netflix and wondered what it was. I am hooked. Very much in a Archer is an alcoholic sex craved secret agent and the rest of the organization he works for are just as messed up. This cartoon makes me laugh as much as Family Guy.,1367193600,7,282,4.053571428571429
5672986,5,B00BTRKMNI,"Archer is a consistently great and hilarious show and this season is no different.  Every episode is fantastic, but my favorites are the two-part season finale featuring Captain Murphy of Sealab 2021.  And don't miss the soda machine filled with Goz soda, (the late Harry Goz was the voice of Captain Murphy on Sealab).  Highly recommended.",1365897600,14,340,5.035714285714286
5672987,2,B00BTRKMNI,"After Season 3, I felt that Archer was getting better and better.

5673015,5,B00BTRKMNI,"Archer really hits its stride here. The animation is the best since the beginning (which was ...not good, at least not in Season 1), and the writing is the usual snarky, quick-witted, hysteria-inducing, insult-loaded laugh-fest -- except even BETTER.

If you love Archer, you will probably love this season. If you didn't love the preceding seasons, but you liked them, you'll probably love Season 4.

Also, other characters get to stretch their wings here, to hilarious effect.

It's also not as cracked out as later seasons (Seasons 5 and 6, I'm looking at you...) (but then, those had their own cracked out charms, too) -- it's full bodied and mature in its immaturity, like the best Boone's Farm wine.",1463184000,,705,4.907563025210084

5673072,5,B00BTRKMNI,"The creator of 'Archer' has called it 'Arrested Development' meets a spy spoof. A pretty good sum up. This has some of the absurdist, insane feel of 'Sealab' or 'Venture Brothers', but also grounds it in richer characters.

By nature, this kind of wild, raunchy, ribald, gross, un-PC, very clever, joke a second romp is going to be a hit or miss affair, but the batting average in 'Archer' is surprisingly high, and a lot of the wordplay is really sharp.

The show grows each season, getting ever funnier, and having the characters and situations branch out in some great unexpected ways. From what started out in season 1 feeling like it would be a one joke idea that would quickly wear out, this somehow found a way to transcend and use the audience familiarity with the characters not to just repeat the same jokes, but to walk a great tightrope of giving what is expected, but then finding a way to just push it one step further. By season 3 the show is really consistently full of surreal hilarity.

Another big plus here is the voice acting. The whole cast is terrific, as are the many guest stars that show up. The fun they all seem to be having doing the show is infectious, and they manage to give their characters a surprising amount of range. Special credit has to be given to H. Jon Benjamin, along with the writers, for making the egotistical idiot of a lead not only very funny, but somehow also likable enough that he never wears out his welcome.

If you like animated insanity, this is very much worth checking out to see if it's for you.",1423267200,,1554,4.480565371024735
5673073,5,B00BTRKMNI,"It's Archer. Recommend you watch prior seasons to get all the subtle inside jokes that without prior knowledge, may just leave you scratching your head.

The humor of this season seems a touch different, You can tell they were trying to break free from some of the jokes they are renown for, but still it was nice to see they were trying to think outside the box.",1422921600,,540,4.454545454545454

A great shout-out to Bob's Burgers and some terrific guest voices, as well. Probably the most solid season so far, with more cast interaction than before. The animation just gets better and better (check out the scene on the side of Tuntmore Towers), as do the obscure references that pay-off after repeated viewings (or a thorough knowledge of history/art/literature/pop culture/ and all things Burt Reynolds).

Although most of the episodes are great there are two that I skip over every time...they are Agent Kazak and The Coyote episodes.  There were a lot of random links revealed in season four which I like, but the sudden presence of Ron Cadillac is odd.  He is a great character, but where the hell did he come from and how did Malory meet him?  We finally got to meet Cheryl/Carol's ""gross brother, Cecil"" and his girlfriend Tiffy.

But there are a few of those for shock effect thrown in.  Archer is/was a secret agent that thinks very highly of himself (to say the least) and has a drinking problem, an unlimited appetite for debauchery, mother issues, an extreme penchant to annoy and mock almost anyone he interacts with, an utter disregard for his own mortality, coolness under extreme circumstances, and always knows what to do when he finds himself in the ""danger zone""!

Jon Benjamin's (voice of Archer) Fox series ""Bob's Burger's"" which could have been TOO much of an inside joke, but is so cleverly woven into a dream story (a la ""Wizard Of Oz') it actually works. The characters are etched into the personalities we now expect and Mallory is the animated version of Lucille Bluth with her sharp tongue and handy martini.

Just be aware that some of the language and action is not for children, but if you're not afraid to look at life through the eyes of a super agent who is a little twisted, then you'll enjoy the odd mix of people doing what real people do in their everyday lives, be themselves!

5673174,5,B00BTRKMNI,"The fourth season of this hilarious series begins with a wonderful Bob's Burger crossover, and the twisted fun never lets up right through to the end, with another crossover of sorts that shall remain a surprise. For me, Archer kept its wit and invention through this fourth season, though as I write, it has shed its spy milieu in a fifth season that shows signs of repetitive lack of invention, but we'll see. In any case, if you enjoy cultural references too numerous to count, jokes that don't hit you until the third time through, and occasionally sick humor, as well as top-notch animation, this is the series for you -- at least through season 4. Highly recommended.",1394496000,,673,4.711864406779661

5673179,4,B00BTRKMNI,It wasn't uncensored which was my whole point of buying the season's but it's still hilarious I love Archer I have every season can't wait until season 5 is on BLU RAY,1394064000,,167,4.25
5673180,5,B00BTRKMNI,"OK, so this season opens with a shot of Bob's Burgers... PRICELESS!  As with the previous three seasons, Archer is quick, witty, well written, clever, engaging, action packed, hilarious and appropriately rated (TVMA).  For those who don't know, H. John Benjamin (Archer) also voices both Bob from Bob's Burgers (which is another hilarious show), so starting the season with Archer acting as Bob was hilarious!  This season does not disappoint... even though if I'm honest I wish there were more than 13 episodes in this disk.  There are lots of hilarious scenes and adrenalin packed action/comedy.  This season utilizes a lot of plot devices from previous seasons (expect Katya and Barry) and keeps the humor and typical Archer action alive.  Notable guest voices include the two voice actors who are the voices of Gene and Louise from Bob's Burgers, which is an added level of awesome.

OK, bottom line, I could NOT wait for Archer to show up on Netflix so I bought it on DVD.  This season is hilarious and I'm glad I bought is as SOON as I could... it is too funny, witty, clever, fun, hilarous,ac on-packed, well written and CLASSIC as ever!",1394064000,,1144,4.801020408163265

If you like Archer, these discs make the experience of watching even better. I get ""oooh's & ahhh's"" from everyone I show them to because they are just so clear. ""Phrasing""",1393977600,,443,4.414634146341464

5673202,5,B00BTRKMNI,"When I saw the cool cover with cameraman 'Randy' I knew this was something special.  This series keeps getting better and better each season(see my other reviews for specifics)!  My only fear is that our expectations will be so great they may reach a point where it's impossible to top themselves(as Dr. Kreiger would say 'Awwwww')..

As for the actual Season 4 itself, I give it 5 stars without hesitation.  Possibly the best so far(which is impressive considering how strong it started)!  The first 3 episodes are the funniest things I've ever seen on television.  The Bob's Burgers premiere had me rolling!  The stories continue to be fresh and the humor still very 'adult'.  I've said this in all my other Archer reviews and I'll say it again here in case you don't know: THIS IS NOT A KID'S SHOW!!!  The language can be a little(who am I kidding - a LOT)blue and there's plenty of suggestive sexual innuendo.  The humor can be dark sometimes, but it can be very intelligent also if you pay attention.

If you haven't seen it yet and want to find out what all the buzz is about, take my advice and start with the first season.  I believe you can find the earlier seasons pretty cheap and just read Amazon recently bought rights to show episodes on Prime for members.  You will be rewarded by seeing the character development(at least as much 'development' as self-centered, dysfunctional, sex/drug addicts can have) over the seasons.

I also want to take a moment to give a shout out to Amazon ... the second disc had an issue and wouldn't play ... but Amazon's Customer Service came through as always - seriously, I have NEVER had a problem - I was able to return the set and am expecting a new one shortly.

Back to the show ... the writers and voice actors are genius.  I don't know which I like more ... the show or my husband laughing hysterically at it.  If you have a chance, check out the show on You Tube, especially the New York CommiConn from last year.  It's a hoot!",1391990400,,778,4.0855263157894735

5673224,5,B00BTRKMNI,"OVERVIEW:  The comedy series ""Archer,"" created by Adam Reed, was first announced on FX in the fall of 2009.  Reed credits the inspiration for the show to a personal experience in which he was unable to muster up the charisma to hit on a beautiful woman; he later fantasized about a suave, debonair spy who would always have the right moves.  I have absolutely fallen in love with ""Archer;"" I can't get enough of the continuous wit and exceptionally clever dialog.  Unlike other animated shows, ""Archer"" utilizes complex plotting as well as character development, allowing viewers to watch and rewatch episodes without sacrificing entertainment value.  I am personally humbled by the various cultural references employed by the writers--it just goes to show how involved intellect must be in creating comedy.  I fully understand that much of the show's content may be deemed offensive to some viewers, so to enjoy it, it's best to keep in mind that ""Archer"" is written in a satirical manner.  It is fair to warn, however, that the series earns its TV/MA rating quite well through use of crude language, violence, and sexual situations; basically, it's probably not suitable for children or anyone who isn't a fan of that sort of comedy.

The storyline centers around Sterling Archer (H. Jon Benjamin) who is the sort of spy Reed had imagined, only with a few extra character `flaws'--he is pretty much a sociopath.  Despite bearing the codename Duchess, Archer is considered the world's most dangerous spy; were he not absorbed with promiscuity, alcoholism, expensive toys and tactlenecks, he might also be considered the world's best spy.  Archer works for his self-centered and emotionally distant mother, Malory Archer (Jessica Walter), at the International Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS) based in New York City.  Fellow ISIS employees include agent Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler), comptroller Cyril Figgis (Chris Parnell), agent Ray Gillette (Adam Reed), HR Director Pam Poovey (Amber Nash), Head of Applied Research Dr. Algernop Krieger (Lucky Yates), ISIS whipping-boy Brett Buckley (Neal Holman), ISIS armory `librarian' Rodney (Andrew Donnelly), and nut-job secretary Cheryl Tunt (Judy Greer).  Other recurring cast-members include:  cyborg KGB leader Barry Dylan (Dave Willis), cyborg KGB leader Katya Kazanova (Ona Grauer), and Archer's valet, Woodhouse (George Coe; Roy McCrery in flashbacks).

Season 4 Guest Stars:  ODIN agent Lucas Troy (Timothy Olyphant), Malory's husband Ron Cadillac (Ron Leibman), ""Bob's Burgers"" owner Bob Belcher (H. Jon Benjamin), Bob's wife Linda Belcher (John Roberts), ""16"" owner Lance Casteau (Anthony Bordain), Coyote Mercedes Moreno (Carla Jimenez), mechanic Mr. Ford (Bobby Ford), mutineer and eco-terrorist Captain Murphy (John Hamm), stalker Ruth Anne Litzenberger (Judy Greer), Cut-Rate James Mason/Turkman Leader/Archer's father (Peter Serafinowicz), Border Patrol Agent (Nick Searcy), Cardinal Giancarlo Morelli (Rene Auberjonois), the Pope (George Coe), Cheryl's brother Cecil Tunt (Eugene Mirman), and Cecil's girlfriend Tiffy (Kristen Schaal).

ARCHER:  THE COMPLETE SEASON FOUR--kicked off in January of 2013.  The fourth season carries some of the long-running jokes from Seasons One-Three, but also begins to show a more sensitive side to Sterling Archer (for brief moments, he almost borders on `mature').  Some of the continuing themes include:  Who is Archer's father?  Why does Archer hate crocodiles?  Will Brett finally die?  What is Barry's master plan?  What will Katya do as the new head of the KGB?  Will Lana and Archer get back together?  What is to become of the rivalry between Barry and Archer?  Who will Lana choose as the father of her baby?

SPECIAL FEATURES:  [13 Episodes/2 Discs/286 min.]  Fisherman's Daughter and Archer Live!

EPISODE SUMMARIES (contains spoilers):

Episode 1:  ""Fugue And Riffs""--Thanks to Barry (still trapped on Horizon and tracking Archer's every move), a KGB hit-squad mistakes Bob Belcher, family man and owner of ""Bob's Burgers,"" for Sterling Archer.  To protect his wife and children, Bob goes into hiding (at a luxurious spa).  In reality, Sterling has amnesia and, for the past few months, has been living as Bob.  Attempting to promote situational recall, Krieger and Cyril pose as KGB agents.  When the real KGB shows up, Lana, Bob, Cyril, and Krieger find themselves cornered; Lana calls a ""Code Zulu,"" but Ray pretends he didn't hear it.  Archer finally remembers what triggered his identity crisis:  Malory has married Ron Cadillac.

Episode 2:  ""The Wind Cries Mary""--Item 5 of the agenda:  following an ant infestation, Malory closes the ISIS break room.  Item 6:  Pam's peer-reviews.  Item 7:  ODIN agent and Archer's beloved BFF, Lucas Troy, was undercover as a nuclear scientist in a mission gone-bad.  Troy is believed to have stolen the cash and uranium stores; all of the agents on the operation are dead, including Troy (who's `body' is found among the wreckage of a getaway plane).  Lana and Cyril tail Archer to Vermont where he has rendezvoused with a rogue Lucas Troy.  To better control ISIS inventory (and irritate ISIS employees), Malory hires Rodney as the new armory `librarian.'

Episode 3:  ""Legs""--Now that Ray is for-real paralyzed, he struggles to cope with being handicapped.  Dr. Krieger convinces him to be fitted with bionic legs.  In fear that Krieger might be creating a ""gay terminator,"" Archer attempts to shoot through the operating-room door; Brett, despite being nowhere in the vicinity, is somehow shot in a ""magic bullet"" scenario.  Because Rodney denies him the proper equipment for infiltrating Krieger's lab, Archer is left to spend the weekend crawling around in the ISIS ventilation ducts.

Episode 4:  ""Midnight Ron""--Archer calls for an extraction from Montreal.  Since Malory and Ron are having a marital dispute, Ron jumps at the chance to retrieve his stranded stepson.  In order to evade border patrol, Archer (and a suitcase full of dirty money) is smuggled in Ron's trunk.  When a gang of robbers ambushes Ron's car, the Cadillac ends up totaled.  A few dirty truckers and one cargo-train later, Archer manages to get Ron back in time to see ""Carmen"" with Malory.

Episode 5:  ""Viscous Coupling""--A desperate and dateless Archer makes a brief but convincing attempt to get back together with Lana; when Archer receives a call from his ex-fianc, Katya Kazanova, he quickly recants his play at Lana and rushes to Katya's apartment.  To Archer's dismay, Katya is actually just seeking help in locating her beloved Barry.  Knowing that Barry is still trapped on Horizon, Sterling agrees to help--hoping Katya will be so grateful that she'll dump Barry to get back together with him.

Episode 6:  ""Once Bitten""--Sterling, Cyril, and Ray are on a mission to blow up an oil pipeline in Turkmenistan.  Amid nothing but desert, Archer takes a potty break and receives a curious bit from a Caspian cobra.  His insistence on continuing to drink only worsens the poison's effect, leading to dream-like hallucinations that take the form of Archer and James Mason visiting important moments from Sterling's past.  The journey through his memory exposes the root of Archer's inner torment.

Episode 7:  ""Live And Let Dine""--Lance Casteau, TV chef and owner of the restaurant ""16/Seize,"" is hosting dinner for U.S. and Albanian diplomats.  Due to a vague security threat, the ISIS team is brought in to pose as restaurant staff.  Archer (Randy), Lana (Mitzi), Cyril (Chet), and Ray (Gilles) become the stars of this week's episode of ""Bastard Chef.""

Episode 8:  ""Coyote Lovely""--The ISIS agents are sent to the South Texas border to capture a Coyote named Moreno.  After intercepting the Coyote's truck full of illegal immigrants, Archer discovers that Moreno is actually a beautiful seorita; he quickly betrays Cyril, Lana, and the rest of the mission to run away with Mercedes Moreno.  Attempting to cross into Mexico with a station wagon full of aliens, Archer is routed by the border patrol; he takes two bullets in the back before Mercedes can subdue the border agents.

Episode 9:  ""The Honeymooners""--A team of North Korean agents plan to make a cash exchange for enriched uranium at the Tuntmore Towers Hotel.  Archer and Lana go undercover as newlyweds--enticing Pam, Cheryl, and Cyril to follow along on a colleague-spying venture.  While scaling the building, Lana slips and makes a free fall, giving Archer the opportunity to make a heroic rescue (after which, Lana makes an important decision).  When Lana and Archer fall into Korean custody, Cyril leaves his peeping-post to rescue them.

Episode 10:  ""Un Chien Tangerine""--After acing the ISIS Field-Agent Aptitude Battery test and proving her weight in combat, Pam requests to be trained as a field-agent.  Sterling and Lana are in Tangier, Morocco, to extract agent Kazak--who turns out to be a very large and smelly Mastiff.  Lana has finally had enough of Archer's antagonism; she quits ISIS and storms off into the desert (without her GPS, gun, sat-phone, or life-saving water).  When Lana gets kidnapped, Archer and Kazak team up to rescue her.

Episode 11:  ""The Papal Chase""--Cardinal Giancarlo Morelli contracts ISIS to protect the Pope from Swiss assassins.  Lana is upset to learn that Malory has chosen Sterling and Pam as the undercover agents (a priest and a nun, respectively) instead of her.  Because the Pope bears a striking resemblance to a certain valet, Lana is put in charge of bringing Woodhouse to Vatican City for use as a decoy.  As it turns out, Cardinal Morelli hired ISIS believing they would blow the operation, making him next in line for Popehood.

Episode 12:  ""Sea Tunt:  Part I""--A B-52 carrying a hydrogen bomb has crashed into the Bermuda Triangle; Malory plans to recover (and later ransom) the bomb before the Russians can get their hands on it.  Because they need use of his submersible vehicle, ISIS agrees to bring Cecil Tunt and his girlfriend, Tiffy, along for the mission--only Lana is skeptical of Cecil's reasons for involvement.  On their way to the research vessel, Cecil prods the ISIS team for testimony on his sister's `idiosyncrasies;' Cheryl discovers that Cecil is actually gathering evidence so that he can be granted conservatorship over her share of the inheritance.  When they reach the Tunt's ship, Cecil confesses that the bomb was a hoax; he tricked ISIS into the mission in hopes of using them to regain control over his rogue underwater research laboratory.  Captain Murphy (the mutineer, lead scientist, and eco-terrorist) is threatening to launch VX-Nerve Gas missiles into the U.S.

Episode 13:  ""Sea Tunt:  Part II""--Knowing Murphy is seeking publicity for his `save-the-ocean' cause, Cecil disguises Lana, Archer, Cyril, and Ray as a news-crew for admission into the Sea Tunt.  While in the submersible vehicle (DSV), Lana becomes nauseated and Ray gets a bloody nose; since Lana doesn't have any tampons and Archer replaced the onboard first-aid kit with alcohol, Ray's nose is just left to bleed.  Lana is noticeably agitated, but refuses Archer's boozing offer.  Back on the surface vessel, it is revealed that Cecil (along with his inability to manage funds) has blown his share of the inheritance.  Once they arrive at the Sea Tunt, Lana's interviewing skills lead Murphy to reveal that he doesn't actually have any missiles and that he is just doing this for attention.  During a standoff, Archer shoots a hole in the observation glass; pods 1-6 flood almost immediately (since the sea-lab is insured at 3x actual value, the Sea Tunt's demise makes Cecil rich again).  When it is discovered that there are only three scuba suits (and that Lana is pregnant), Archer volunteers to drown so that Lana, Cyril, and Ray can make it safely back to the DSV.  After reaching the submersible vehicle, Lana succeeds in restarting Archer's heart by use of a defibrillator; in full celebration-mode, Archer accidentally defibrillates the CPU for Ray's bionic legs, rendering Ray--once again--paralyzed.",1391472000,5,12070,5.2204888195527825

5673235,4,B00BTRKMNI,"I would hate to publicly admit how many times I have watched the episodes of seasons 1, 2 and 3...over and over and over again.  There are layers and layers of humor which, sometimes, aren't discovered until the second,third or fourth viewing.  Needless to say, I believe ""Archer"" is the funniest show around and the writers of this show have set a high bar.  But I was somewhat disappointed with season 4.  It just wasn't as funny.  The stories are weak and the humor isn't exactly fresh.  There were some bright spots (Kazak, the  chrono-synclastic dog with gas) but overall, the writing in this season feels strained and unimaginative.  Granted, I write this review after one viewing so maybe my opinion will improve with further viewings.  But until then, four stars (...compared to the earlier seasons but five stars compared to most other TV shows).  I will amend this review if subsequent viewings warrant the addition of a fifth star.",1390348800,,942,4.83125
5673236,5,B00BTRKMNI,Archer is my favorite show. I own all of the seasons on DVD. Season 4 is the best yet. If you like to laugh you will love Archer.,1390089600,,129,3.642857142857143
5673237,5,B00BTRKMNI,"I have purchased a lot of media in my lifetime and this is the first time I ever experienced a flawed disk. It wasn't visible to me but my PS3 and bluray player certainly noticed; however, I find Archer so hilarious and entertaining that I cannot even subtract a star. Amazon rushed a replacement and I was relieved to have a working copy and confirmation that my bluray players didn't suddenly break.",1389916800,,401,4.583333333333333
5673238,5,B00BTRKMNI,"Who likes to go to work? Not me...So I watch any season almost everyday before work. It always puts me in a good mood. I mean who doesn't want to hear the phrase ""I was bit in the taint by a cobra"" before a crappy morning commute... baby.",1389830400,,238,3.9791666666666665
5673239,5,B00BTRKMNI,"The fourth season, I am aware, is not a favorite of several fans.  I still found the shows thoughtful, well-written, and just as funny as always.  I loved the stories about Pam in this season as well as seeing more of Dr. Krieger.  Both of those characters play a bigger role in this season than they did in the series' early days.

The dialog moves at a breakneck pace--which means that a viewer can still pick up new aspects of the humor on repeated viewings.

Like the other seasons, this is a show for adults.  It uses humor that is not appropriate--and, in many cases, would not be understood--by younger viewers.",1389744000,,618,4.5225225225225225
5673240,5,B00BTRKMNI,"Archer is outstanding, I think the fourth season is the best so far, Archer really out do himself as always !!!!!",1389657600,,113,4.428571428571429
5673241,5,B00BTRKMNI,"Four seasons in and still one of the best shows on TV! While I would recommend starting from the beginning if you haven't seen the show yet, it really doesn't matter where you jump in because every episode is gold and the inside jokes/continuity is relatively easy to pick up on. The important thing is it's never too late to start watching! Although it probably isn't necessary; the show takes place in a private spy agency called ISIS, though comparing it to the intelligence business may be a misnomer. Pretty much all of the characters have a significant role to play; some more than others of course but everybody has a developed background. It's a classic suave spy story in the present day, except it's a comedy with some science fiction and even a bit of realism thrown in.

Season four starts off with a hilarious Bob's Burgers crossover and ends with an great Sealab 2021 homage. Everything in between is just as good, and there's even some decent guest appearances, which is a welcome addition that is becoming more frequent in this show. I am still not overly impressed with the extras for these box sets, especially considering the show averages only 13 episodes a season with nine months between it ending and being released for purchase, but the extras aren't the reason I buy the seasons, and Archer is still a fairly niche show anyway, so that aspect doesn't effect my opinion of the whole product. To sum things up, step into the Danger Zone and watch this show immediately!",1389484800,3,1492,4.694656488549619

5673243,5,B00BTRKMNI,"Archer is back in season four in this animated tv show with LANA and his other fellow agents up to their old tricks! You wonder how they can catch anyone, with the back stabbing, drinking, the ""SEX!!!"" The drugs and cussing going on. And let's not for get ARCHER always screwing things UP!!! I gave it FIVE STARS because i LOVE the show! I recomen Blu-Ray and it is in WIDESCREEN!! Parents this is for ADULTS not for CHILDREN.

That may have come off harsh but I'm figuring you already have 1-3 so why are you even reading this review?! BUY IT! WATCH IT! THANK ME LATER!

5673246,4,B00BTRKMNI,"Archer is a very funny show that knows what it is, crazy storylines and funny lines.  The show is about Sterling Archer - the world's greatest spy and the other agents of ISIS (International Secret Intelligence Service).  Archer is a suave and incredibly self-centered master spy that has to deal with global espionage and a controling and emotionally distant mother who is also his boss, Malory Archer.  Archer must also must deal with his ex-girlfriend and fellow ISIS agent, Lana Kane as well enemies within the international spy world.

In this season 4 Archer and his team travel the globe,going from the Bermuda Triangle all the way to the Vatican.  The show is very well written and has some great lines in it.  I enjoy the show and found myself laughing out loud many times during this season's episodes.  I would definitely recommend this season of Archer to others.

Thank you for reading my review.",1388361600,4,909,4.819354838709677
5673247,5,B00BTRKMNI,"Watched the whole season when it aired new. Not sure why they won't release DVD's of a season until the next one is almost on, but regardless I'm buying. It's just more Archer. This is a show that keeps going strong and has not gotten weaker like many shows do after a few years. Slightly dark and very quick witted humor spread all over the show, with many references that come out of nowhere you often have to Google after watching an episode. Anyone I get to watch this show (appropriately aged of course) bust out laughing constantly, even my parents and uncles/aunts who are usually the 'stiffs' who only watch shows from the 80's and before because all new stuff is bad to them.",1386547200,,684,4.48
5673248,5,B00BTRKMNI,"This is by far (and above) the funniest show on TV (but not for kids of any  age). I have never laughed out loud at any TV show so much in my life. After 4 seasons, I feel like I know the characters (although they are animated). Archer and Lana are  hysterical as the love/hate couple, and the  interaction between Archer his mom is so funny I  nearly pee myself from hysterical laughter. My highest  recommendation for anyone who loves politically incorrect adult comedy",1386288000,3,471,4.559523809523809

This season has anything and everything that will give you ants!",1378944000,32,270,4.645833333333333
5673253,5,B00BTRKMNI,"Offensive?  maybe....depends on your sense of humor. OK, I lied. It is offensive, but in a belly-laugh kinda way.

If you like Lewis Black, Eddie Izzard, Monty Python and Ron White then Archer is right up your alley.  Hilarious characters, wonderfully funny writing. My brother and I are hoping they will make a motion picture, as the industry has done for so many shows. We have all seasons, constantly re-watch episodes and can't wait for the next installment.",1376956800,17,462,4.897435897435898
