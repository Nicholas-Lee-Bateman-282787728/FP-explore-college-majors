8587422,2,B00CXXVCBI,Received my DVD and popped it in immediately-- to my dismay it was damaged and couldn't watch to completion. From what I did see the video seemed to have good information but not executed in a way that I could follow well. The yogis in the video are dynamic with passionate energy -- and have good information to share but might consider organizing how they approach the teaching of it.  Still watching for other works from these two!,1392854400,5,434,4.564102564102564
