Phillip Ko is once again the villain. He is ruthless,shows no mercy,kills his opponents,has a long braid that he uses on his victims to choke them.",1360281600,,552,6.076923076923077
8136583,2,B000H5U6DE,"I thought this movie was boring. Not going to go in depth of the synopsis, as morgoth has highlighted that in his review.  Yeah there's action and training scenes but the story was weak. I was not the least bit drawn into the movie nor the main lead. Dont get me wrong, Cliff Lok can move and is very agile.  I liked the interviews in the extra section more than I liked the movie, if that should tell you something. Even if the picture was better or if the subs were redone and not burnt in, I don't think this movie could have improved. Ko Fei couldn't save this flick for me either. This is among the least of my favorite Rarescope releases.",1223769600,,644,4.227642276422764
8136584,3,B000H5U6DE,"I have yet to see a Cliff Lok film that I liked I'm just not impressed with his fighting techniques, althougth the old masters and Philip Ko character give this film some life.",1204848000,,176,4.363636363636363
