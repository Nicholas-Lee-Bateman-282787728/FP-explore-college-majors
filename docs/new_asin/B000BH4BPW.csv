8324989,5,B000BH4BPW,Great content. No nonsense. Straight forward. Beautiful finished flute on the first try. Can't go wrong with this dvd.,1424995200,,118,5.2631578947368425
8324990,4,B000BH4BPW,"I have used this instructional DVD to teach woodworking in middle school wood shop. This DVD is a well done overview of one way to build an athentic wooden indian flute. The only thing wrong is Raymond Redfeather advocates for, but does not display good shop safety while demonstrating how to make his flutes.  I hope it becomes available again in the future as I have several friends who would like a copy.",1318377600,,407,4.575342465753424
