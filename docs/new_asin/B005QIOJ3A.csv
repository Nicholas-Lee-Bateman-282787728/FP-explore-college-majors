4858342,5,B005QIOJ3A,"Whew! After the 20th season debacle, I thought it was all over.

In the 14th season DVD, there is commentary on every episode. Though only four episodes have Matt Groening, each episode has at least seven people commenting with one episode containing 12. Guests Joe Mantegna, ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, Tony Hawk, Mark Hoppus, Scott Thompson and David Byrne join the regular writers, animators, directors and cast during the commentaries. In fact, there are noticeably more visits from the cast in these commentaries (no Harry Shearer or Julie Kavner, though).

While the storylines and jokes may be a tad weaker, the 14th season is the first season to utilize digital animation and coloring, abandoning cels, ink and paint, so the overall LOOK of the show is different, probably better and crisper.

Homer also is stupider than in previous season with some gags falling flat, making one wonder if Homer is too stupid/less funny in this season. However, remember that in season 14 Homer died in the first episode when he was first over the cliff chasing the giant donuts hanging from the helicopters. The Homer in the rest of the episodes is a clone. That is how I am rationalizing the ultrastupidity of Homer this season.

Also, the usual deleted scenes and animation showcases are here. The menus are formatted the same as the last few collections with menu animations worth sitting through their entirety before they loop. In other words, it's the same comfortable format fans of the DVD sets have been used to and sorely missed in the 20th season DVD set.

If you are a collector of all the seasons, then do not hesitate with season 14. Just pretend that the 20th season set didn't happen.

If you hate the ""accordion"" packaging of seasons 11-13, you'll hate this packaging, too. It's the same.

Life is back to normal.",1323129600,61,1817,4.841935483870968
4858343,5,B005QIOJ3A,"Although this does not have as many classic episodes as previous seasons, there are still plenty of gems. It's easily worth the price.",1322611200,2,134,4.869565217391305
4858344,5,B005QIOJ3A,"1. Don't know why this season is given a bad rep just because it was after the simpsons ""steep decline in quality"". This season was the first to be nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Musical or Comedy Series and it has 22 episodes. It won four Annie Awards, including its 12th consecutive in the Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Television Production category. The other awards won were Best Directing in an Animated Television Production (Steven Dean Moore for ""'Scuse Me While I Miss the Sky""), Best Music in an Animated Television Production (Alf Clausen, Ken Keeler and Ian Maxtone-Graham for ""Dude, Where's My Ranch?"") and Best Writing in an Animated Television Production (Matt Warburton for ""Three Gays of the Condo"").""The Dad Who Knew Too Little"" (written by Matt Selman) won a Writers Guild of America Award in 2004 in the animation category. It won  two Primetime Emmy Awards. ""Three Gays of the Condo"" became the eighth episode of the series to win the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour).Hank Azaria won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for voicing various characters in the episode ""Moe Baby Blues"". So it must be a good choice to get after it comes out.

The entire Season 14 is here, with the normal greeting from Matt Groening along with lots of extras, like fun deleted scenes and trailers. Definitely worth a buy for the avid Simpsons fan!",1477612800,,488,4.433333333333334

While the quality definitely has gone down over the past few years, even the not so great episodes still manage to entertain and amuse me. This season is definitely after the Simpsons' prime years, but before the show really went downhill for me. It still maintains the Simpsons magic that brought so many, including myself, so much joy. If you're new to the Simpsons, I recommend this season later on in your viewing. Start from the beginning instead. This one is still good, but you'll enjoy it much more later on.",1451347200,,572,4.673267326732673

I've seen the show change throughout the years and all the highs and lows. I also remember when I fell out of love with this show which was around season 10, but now that I own all the season so far released the later seasons have grown on me.
 I think the reason why I stopped obsessively watching the Simpsons was because the dip in quality and the fact that I was burnt out. Season 1 I was 7 by season 10 I was 17 and it was just getting old, plus the fact that the show seemed to go from top notch writing to all over the place was all too boring for me. But now that I've watched all the seasons on dvd over and over again I've realized it wasn't as bad as I remember it being and by season 12 the show seemed to get better for awhile. Yeah some episodes are terrible but there is a lot of funny moments on this season. Sometimes I wonder if some of the newer writers watched the show at all before and other writers got it right. These days I try not to worry about the bad episodes, I just skip passed them and all is better. What you get with season 14 is some great episodes, some good ones, some alright ones and some bad ones, but it's still worth buying.",1349049600,10,1306,3.9657794676806084

4858514,4,B005QIOJ3A,"It came out awhile ago, but I just recently got it and finished watching the episodes and bonus features. Unlike any other DVD review I've done, I won't bother to review each individual episode this time, but I'll instead list some of season fourteen's highlights, as well as some of the duds.

I can say right away that I was surprised by this season. After season 10-ish, I haven't really enjoyed any of the seasons on DVD... bland stories, weak jokes, and just general mediocrity. For season fourteen though, I was happy to find that I actually LIKED a lot of the episodes.

Before watching any of the episodes, I read a lot of people's reviews complaining that Homer is beyond dumb in this season... that his IQ had dropped 30 points, and that he changed for the worse. While there are gags in some of the episodes that make Homer come off as a complete retard, most of the time the jokes were still funny to me, so the new Homer didn't bother me this season.

The season as a whole is average or slightly better throughout ... I found myself rating most every episode between 3.5 and a 4.25 rating out of 5. My favorite episodes of the season include ""Treehouse of Horror XIII"" (Mostly in part to the 'Send in the Clones' bit), ""Helter Shelter"", ""The Dad Who Knew Too Little"", ""Three Gays of the Condo"", and ""Dude, Where's My Ranch?"". Those five episodes I gave 'season high' 4.25s to. The worst episode, and the only one to get a 3.25 from me, is ""Pray Anything"". It's just a boring episode with very little to chuckle at. Regardless, the season averages about a 4/5 for me. Even though I wouldn't call a single episode from this season GREAT, I'd willingly watch most of these episodes a second or third time over again.

As for the bonus features, they're like the menus -- based almost entirely around Treehouse of Horror episodes from seasons past. I don't have any issues with this, but I don't understand why they haven't just released a Treehouse of Horror I-XX or XXII box set or something. I assume they'll do it at some point...

The other features include the usual... commentary on every episode, art galleries, and deleted scenes. I haven't and usually don't watch episodes with commentary, so I can't comment on how they are, but apparently Matt Groening isn't in many of the episodes.

Overall, The Simpsons: The Complete Fourteenth season is the best season to me since the tenth. Although nothing about this season will blow you away, you'll more than likely approve of more episodes than you disapprove.

4/5",1343174400,4,2532,4.613333333333333
4858515,5,B005QIOJ3A,"I didn't see many of the Season 14 episodes when they originally aired, and I was against buying anything after Season 13 cause I thought that was when the show got into its crappy period. But every episode had me cracking up at least once. Sure they don't have the classic Simpsons feel, and there are some cringy moments(Blink 182), but they're still a great batch of episodes. I'm looking forward to Season 15.",1338249600,2,413,4.594594594594595
4858516,5,B005QIOJ3A,The simpsons dvds are the only ones in which i will watch the video with commentary. only a minor problem for some odd reason the dvds would not play on my PS3 on worked perfectly fine on all other dvd players.,1337385600,,210,4.146341463414634
4858517,5,B005QIOJ3A,"The perception is that around this time (or earlier), The Simpsons dipped in quality.  Now, there is no question that these episodes do not reach the peaks of seasons 4-6, but this season is actually really strong overall.  There are three reasons for this.  The first obvious reason is that the show was still well-written at this time: the banter between the characters is often very amusing, especially secondary characters like Moe, Chief Wiggum, and Mr. Burns.  The second is that the gags are less frequent and more subtle, not drawing attention to themselves, but rewarding an attentive viewer.  For one very small example, when Homer is in the hospital and Marge says he needs to get a cell phone, Lindsay Neagle emerges from the Morgue to try to sell him one.  (Nowadays, the show is exhausting to watch because it reaches constantly for laughs with big obvious gags, which often just aren't that funny.)  The final reason is that the plots, while undoubtedly silly at times, rely on the good will that the show had built up toward its universe of characters.  The Simpsons has always had consistent and human characters at its core, and Season 14 does a good job in that department, even if it sometimes goes in ridiculous directions.  So, overall, a very entertaining and funny season that I really enjoyed going back through again after buying this.",1337212800,6,1361,4.831896551724138

4858519,3,B005QIOJ3A,"The sharp decline that The Simpsons suffered in the early noughties is glaringly evident in this lackluster season. Of the 22 episodes a few are well-written and smart, a few are lazily-written and boring, and the rest are forgettable without being particularly bad. The first episode (Treehouse of Horror 13) is horrible, despite a promising opening. Things do not improve with episode 2, featuring unnaturally shoehorned-in guest appearances by The Rolling Stones and other aging rockers. We've already seen Homer interact with these types in the Season 12 episode 'A Tale of Two Springfields'. It's just an easily recycled gimmick that fails to make for a memorable episode. As for the other 20...well, when you browse through your Simpsons collection looking for a classic episode, you will never pick out Season 14.

The production design of the package is lovely. Fox have gone for a Halloween theme for this one and it looks great. The Blu Ray presents each episode in 1.33:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound. There are a decent amount of extras, which are entertaining. But the best of them is the fact that disc 3 contains two Treehouse of Horror episodes (V and VI) from 1994 and 1995. These episodes are actually the best Treehouse of Horrors (V was heavily cut in the UK due to the gore and violence), and I suspect they were included to make up for the fact that the Halloween episode in Season 14 was so bad. I should also point out that Treehouse of Horror V and VI look much better on Blu Ray than their DVD counterparts, proving that earlier seasons could benefit from being released on the format. But since Fox have been releasing The Simpsons to the home video market since 2001 and are only at Season 14 I wouldn't hold your breath.",1336608000,3,1747,4.727868852459016
4858520,5,B005QIOJ3A,"Many of the later seasons of The Simpsons are as good or better than earlier seasons. Why do people think they're worse? Because they're not nearly as familiar as the classic episodes. Familiarity is a major predictor of likability. These episodes are fantastic on their first run through, but they're even better after twenty views. Why? In addition to the whole familiarity effect, it's because the writers usually pack in so many jokes you miss one or two a minute, just with normal lapses of attention. So, quit putting down the later seasons, be thankful such a wonderful show still continues after all of these years, and find how wonderful life is without so much cynicism!",1335484800,,680,4.870689655172414

The episodes on this season include many that don't live up to the hilarity of the seasons that preceded it, or even many of those that followed. Still, while this represents the doldrums of the Simpsons, it's still better than most of the crap on TV. As far as this product, I did notice that FOX is skimping a bit on the packaging and some of the glue has already come loose, but it still contains some quality artwork and amusing extras.",1332892800,,569,4.377358490566038
4858523,4,B005QIOJ3A,"I've been a fan of the Simpsons since the beginning...however I do think a lot of self-proclaimed ""hardcore fans"" are just nitpicking about their perceptions of the quality of the show in later seasons. This is a show that just recently aired its 500th episode. Not every show will be a work of art...I take the Simpsons for what it is...a very culturally aware piece of pop satire that considers nothing sacred and explores different ways to achieve what it sets out to do constantly. Granted, I haven't been absolutely in love with every single episode, but to ask that would be impossible. One episode of ""M*A*S*H"" that that show's cast all seemed to love was an episode called ""Dreams""...and it was one of my least favorites ever. Again, another long running series that had its own groundbreaking episodes as well for its time. I enjoy watching The Simpsons to this day and like many other fans, I sure do wish they'd catch up on the DVD season releases. There are still seasons 15 through 19 plus 21 and 22 that a lot of people would love to buy...but as somsone else said, the reason those aren't out yet is probably the syndication value of those seasons (translated: if they were available now, people wouldn't have to tune into the reruns to see them). I will say, however, that after receiving my copy in the mail, that this has some of the worst packaging I've seen yet. You have to physically pull the discs out from a cardboard sleeve that practically begs you to rip it just to get at the disc, and the sleeve is a fold-out that holds all four DVDs. I gave up and put the discs into four of those little white CD envelopes from Staples and ut them back into the box the collection comes in along with the booklet.

See, I've been following the Simpsons since their first episode (even before actually ;) and am a huge fan, but I sort of slowly started to drift away around season 13. The episodes just didn't seem to have that same brilliance I'd grown accustomed to. I'd check back in from time to time, but it seemed Homers head was just getting stuck in things for the sake of it? Eventually I drifted away completely and became accustomed to re-watching the classics on DVD. I've enjoyed reliving the experience, the first Christmas episode, trampolines, horses, elephants, military school, but that time has come; Season 14. With this purchase I'm reminded why I began to wander off in the first place, and the angst that accompanies the groans of disappointment has revisited me. I'm sorry Matt...I'm really, really sorry.

4858539,4,B005QIOJ3A,"As I've seen the quality of The Simpsons decline over the previous two seasons, I was very hesitant to buy season 14. I had not seen these episodes before, as i do not have/watch broadcast/cable TV. Being desperate to get a fix of one of my favorite shows, I ordered S14 not expecting much. To my surprise, the quality of this season is an improvement over the last 2 seasons- and a big improvement over season 13.
  The commentaries (one of my favorite features of the DVDs- and alone worth buying the DVDs for) are again relevant and entertaining (In S13, they seemed like they had stopped caring and had run out of steam...but thankfully, these commentaries on S14 are as good as ever).
  This was the first year they went digital, as far as the actual animation goes...and I have to say, that it looks great.  While this season may still not be up to the standards of seasons 2-10, it is definitely getting back on track. The absurd plots of the last few seasons are gone; The disjointed separate ""A"" and ""B"" stories are gone- with each episode now centered around one unified storyline.
  Homer's annoying screaming and bumbling are largely gone (Thank you!)....and many of the things we loved about the classic seasons have returned- like the inclusion of many of our favorite secondary characters.
  Still, the show is a little flat compared to the classic years; It is not as funny as it once was...and much of the good intellectual humor is still missing...but this is a vast improvement over the crapfest which the show had become over the last few seasons.
  I can only hope that this trend continues with season 15- and maybe there will yet be some good seasons of the Simpsons to come, which rival the quality of earlier seasons. (If only they'd release seasons in a timelier manner!)
  So if you have been put off by the declining quality of the past few seasons...cheer up and give this season a try- it is on the rebound! Sure, other than the commentaries, there isn't much in the way of worthwhile extras (But who cares? We have good commentary on EVERY episode!) and they're still packaging this show in the abhorrent cardboard accordion ruin-a-disc  cases (at least now they've got little cheesy plastic baggies over the DVDs to protect them from scratches).....but [in Krusty voice] Whadduyah gonna do?
  After season 13, seeing this season was a relief! While I wouldn't want to pay a high price for this because of the terrible packaging, I got mine for around twenty mazoolahs...so I am satisfied. While this season really doesn't have any ""favorite"" epsiodes...it doesn't have any real bombs, either...which is an accomplishment for this time period of the show.",1326672000,14,2686,4.744086021505376

4858541,3,B005QIOJ3A,"If you are thinking about buying this you probably own the first 13 and like me still is debating whether or not to actually buy season 20.

Season 14 seems to be the time when the show became less relevant than it used to be. The episodes about Marge are throw aways and though I love Homer and Lisa stories ""The Dad that knew too little"" seemed meh at best. Episodes are never fully resolved and b stories don't even seem to exist anymore.

The packaging is the same accordion style paper rubbish, but at least Kang or Kudos has a nice shiny eye. My suggestion is to watch the episodes with the commentary on first then rewatch the show. It actually makes them better. Check out ""Bart vs. Lisa vs. The Third Grade"" for a glimpse of Bender and ""Treehouse of Horror"" for Family guy's peter.

No matter what, you know if you are looking to buy this season; you already have made the decision to.",1326067200,9,894,4.341317365269461
4858542,4,B005QIOJ3A,I love every season of the simpsons its my favorite show of all time but seasons 14-19 are easily the worse in the series but I still love them seasons 14-19 are stil better than anything else on tv but they are not as good as seasons 1-13 and 20-present but this is still a excellent buy just make sure you get on blu ray if you don't you get the worst packaging EVER! as comic book guy would say it this has the same cardboard packaging that season 11 had but if you get it on blu ray you get much better packaging the packaging is like a playstation 3 games packaging overall it still makes me laugh so hard I poop my pants but the old seasons made me laugh much harder and this has amazing extras and has commentary on every episode,1326067200,,736,4.082758620689655

4858545,5,B005QIOJ3A,I was really impressed with this run of episodes.  It's been quite some time since I've seen some of them and they were great.

4858548,4,B005QIOJ3A,"The answer is, yes.  Yes it does.  The Simpsons was most definitely past its prime in its 14th season, but let's face it - Many of us want to own all the seasons regardless, and furthermore, there's still plenty of gems sprinkled throughout this run anyway.

So, I'll spare you the review of the season itself as most of you already know how you feel about it and get right down to it - The common complaint from people is that this Blu-ray isn't TRUE HD because it's an upconvert in the video department.  As true as this is, we should be very clear about one thing - The upconvert the studio are able to do from the source is going to look ten times better than what your Blu-ray player or TV can do from a DVD.  The result is that this is still very much an impressive looking show on Blu-ray in its 14th season, and nobody should really hesitate to pick this up over the DVD.  If you need further reasons, the fact that the episodes are on less discs, and are on scratch resistant coating for that matter, should also sweeten the deal.",1325376000,4,1039,4.248730964467005
4858549,4,B005QIOJ3A,"Considering that I'm a die hard fan of ""The Simpsons"" and that I've seen nearly every episode of this season recently, I felt like I was fit to review this season.  While there aren't any episodes that could be considered classics like ""Itchy and Scratchy Land"", I still feel like this is a very watchable and funny season.  Truth be told, I hadn't seen many of these episodes since they originally aired almost 10 years ago, and while I too was a little skeptical at first, I was pleasantly surprised that this season gave us some pretty funny episodes.  Some episodes may be a little bland, but if you're a true Simpsons fan, I don't know why you wouldn't like this set.

Another thing is the awful packaging that started with the 11th season, come on people like myself pay anywhere from $30-$40 and as soon as you open a set the discs are already scratched. But anyways, this season for me was a hit and miss.

4858554,4,B005QIOJ3A,"The episodes of ""The Simpsons"" speak for themselves, and, as always, the unifying theme of this season's set (""Treehouse of Horrors"") is very well executed.  However, the bonus features, which the season sets of ""The Simpsons"" were once known for, are far more lacking and much less imaginative than in previous years.  It's as if the producers of the set have stopped trying to include interesting bonuses and just slapped something together to add anything they could, as opposed to the total lack of bonus features on the released-for-the-anniversary 20th season set.  Buy this set for the episodes, and you'll be very glad you did, but expect to be disappointed by the so-called bonus features.",1323648000,4,698,5.052173913043478

It is appalling to think that this company expects to sell a defective product and get a premium price for it.

I know: 1 star for packaging and not reviewing the content.  It isn't a viable product. Pure luck if you get good playable discs. Fox should be ashamed.",1323561600,6,479,4.266666666666667
4858556,3,B005QIOJ3A,"You know I have been a fan of the Simpsons since the first episode.  NEVER did see it on the Tracy Oldman show.

Now, I understood when they started releasing the seasons on DVD about putting supporting characters on the packaging.  But since they started that the last few seasons have NOT been if this makes sense major minor supporting characters.  Kang or Kodos?  How about Barney, Moe, Mr. Burns or Flanders?

Then making this themed after Kang & Kodos THEN releasing it December 2011?  Sure, you need that to promote Christmas.  And, why December 2011 & season 13 released August 2010?  What was with the delay?  At least they did NOT do what they did for several years-release it Christmas week.

Aren't we glad they stopped the starting each season AFTER Halloween making Treehouse of Terror the 1st episode of the season?  This was 1st season they did this.  Stupid idea, post season baseball but why miss September?

This season was also the down fall I noticed of how funny the shows were.  My favorite episode on disc 1 ""How I Spent My Strummer Vacation"" with Mick and Keith.  Disc 3 ""Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington"" featuring Krusty is good as well.

Now, the DVD packaging  is TERRIBLE.  Hard to get the discs out in this horrible design.",1323561600,5,1251,4.63013698630137
4858557,3,B005QIOJ3A,"This season is incredibly bland right down to the disk art which is probably the reason they decided to put kang on the cover.  There are tons of memorable characters to choose from that are regulars but putting kang on there pretty much is a marketing tactic.  I don't really study the art on the disks but i seems familiar to the last couple of seasons; just the number of the disk and a simpson.  If you put these in a dvd binder you'll have no clue what season they're from unless you add an identifier.

I still like the simpsons but this season just is too marge centric, too many guest stars, and incredibly un-funny.  How do you make weird al unfunny?  Poor writing. You might actually fall asleep watching a lot of these episodes (I have).  I guess this was where the show completely jumped the shark.  Frank Grimes Jr?
