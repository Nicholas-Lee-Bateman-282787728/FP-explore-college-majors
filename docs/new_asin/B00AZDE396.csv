8559529,2,B00AZDE396,I bought this a few years ago and  basically forgot about it. I guess I was waiting for my kids to enter school. Well my youngest will soon enter kindergarten. So we popped it in the DVD player. And It was hard to watch even harder to follow. I  appreciate the concept and effort. But the editing was awful the sound was awful it sounds like a refrigerator was humming in the background on some parts. It skips from clip to clip so randomly. Mr. Numbers you have a great concept if you put some money into a professional quality DVD instead of random clip mostly of a presentation you may be justified in selling this. It should of been free on YouTube. He seems like a nice person passionate about teaching and I feel really bad being so negative:( sorry!,1464825600,,756,4.3546099290780145
