2696149,1,B000KMGN0O,"I purchased this set and was extremely disappointed to see that they were copies made directly from TV, probably using Betamax or VHS. They are snowy and unwatchable. My daughter also purchased this set was very upset, having paid more than one hundred dollars for them. I subsequently found another source and the quality is superb.",1264204800,52,333,4.964285714285714
2696150,1,B000KMGN0O,"Whoever owns the rights to these shows, please can you sell them to someone who can give them the treatment they deserve ! It was a great old T.V. series but the quality of these D.V.D.s is lousy. I have older T.V. shows that have been remastered or whatever it is they do & they are of great quality, if only black & white but who cares about that. I sent mine back for a refund & happily got it. I would pay top $ for better quality.",1263945600,42,435,3.9545454545454546
2696151,1,B000KMGN0O,"Adventures in Paradise is a great drama from the golden age of television. Having stated that, the video transfers  from this manufacturer are of terrible quality, the sound is horrible (much too low). Also, the person transcribing the episode titles should learn how to read properly (they have The Archer's Ring listed as The Archer's King. The Fires of Kanau as The Fires of Kanua). They also have no dates of broadcast for the episodes and they are all out of season order. What a MESS! Don't waste your money until a professional video company remasters this great classic series.",1260489600,11,585,4.85
2696152,4,B000KMGN0O,"Out of 64 episodes,  we had 3 that were poor quality.  One was so dark it was unwatchable.  Then  2 others were out of focus.  We were nice and gave the sender 4 stars.  It probably wasn't his/her fault.  We don't want our money back. That has proven a mistake.",1243468800,9,261,4.1
2696153,4,B000KMGN0O,"Although 2-3 of the episodes were unwatchable, the majority were in good shape and were a joy to watch. We saw one a night for quite a while and thoroughly enjoyed reliving our youth when we had first seen the series. The Tiki is a neat boat and the areas of the South Pacific were beautiful back in the fifties. Gardner McKay was a hunk!",1229472000,32,338,4.2153846153846155
2696154,3,B000KMGN0O,Many of the episodes are repeated on multiple discs.  There are actually only 51 unique episodes in the three volumes I received.,1219104000,98,129,4.863636363636363
2696155,5,B000KMGN0O,"I have this set in the original black and white, and I noticed there were originally 91 episodes to the entire show. I would like to find out when, where and if the missing episodes will ever become available. I would like to complete my collection of this TV Series so I can enjoy the whole show and pass it on to my kids. Gardner McKay made the entire show a success. Hopefully the ABC Corporation will acknowledge that this series is worth releasing all 91 episodes and make them available soon.
Thanks.",1186531200,95,506,4.451612903225806
2696156,3,B000KMGN0O,"It is nice to have all the episodes but the picture quaility is lacking.
This series is excellent as far as the story lines but the old films need to be digitally enhanced.",1183593600,74,172,4.242424242424242
2696183,4,B000KMGN0O,"The set is pretty good,  however it was called a complete set, and it is only 64 of 93 episodes, and some of them aren't even playable.  I realize how old they are so I'm satisfied but it shouldn't be listed as complete.",1398556800,4,220,4.093023255813954
2696184,1,B000KMGN0O,Some sections are ok but a lot of the episodes are simply unwatchable because of static and hopeless picture quality. It's an amateur copy.,1396828800,3,139,4.833333333333333
2696185,3,B000KMGN0O,"While the video images are great vintage black and white, the sound quality on the various individual programs is below standards.  One of the dvd's was totally unwatchable due to the snapping and static that overwhelmed the sound track.  Delivery was on time and well packages so no issues other than the disappointing sound quality.",1391990400,3,334,5.054545454545455
2696186,5,B000KMGN0O,"Great to re-live the adventures of our childhood. It was always an experience of 'things unreachable', ie Tahiti, which are now so much closer",1379462400,,142,4.958333333333333
2696187,3,B000KMGN0O,The sound quality was very poor on some of the disks.  Overall it was an interesting nostalgia trip into the past.,1377820800,2,114,4.428571428571429
2696188,3,B000KMGN0O,"I too would pay a pretty price for a quality copy of the series. I am sure there are others. Why doesn't ABC come out a with set. You can get Dragnet & all kinds of junk, why not something of this quality?",1372204800,2,205,3.7906976744186047
2696189,1,B000KMGN0O,"The episodes of Adventures in Paradise floating around are manufactured by a company that sells material that
they claim is out of copyright and thus can legally be sold on the public market.  It is unbelievable to me that the studio
allowed their copyright on this magnificent show to expire.  I have to assume that someone got fired over that.

The product copies of most episodes are bad, a few episodes are decent.  The copies are bad because the
manufacturer does not have the original prints, the stdio presumably still controls those.  So the current
seller is, I suppose, relying on home made copies off home video equipment, i.e., using copies someone(s)
made on their home video recorder from television broadcasts of the show.  Since the copyright is evidently
expired they can legally do that.

Hopefully some day the present owner of the original prints will sell the DVD's to the general public.

I would pay quite a bit for a mint copy of the entire series for my collection.",1371945600,14,990,4.7823529411764705
2696190,3,B000KMGN0O,"A bit disappointed in the quality of some of the discs. Yes, the series was made between 1959 and 1961 but some of the episodes are almost unwatchable - all grainy and ghosting. The better ones are fine. They all look as if they are copies of copies rather than originally sourced prints. Given the cost that is disappointing.",1364688000,2,326,4.5423728813559325
2696191,3,B000KMGN0O,"Poor quality video. Video frame not centered. White line down left edge. Content seems to be complete, commercials are mostly edited out although it would have been nice to have the ads included at the end as an extra.",1359331200,2,218,4.615384615384615
2696192,2,B000KMGN0O,"I thought I was getting something professionally transferred onto dvd and was upset that the reproduction of these disks is terrible. The background noise is deafening, film blurry and scratchy and volume non existant. For the money it's not worth purchasing and the seller should have done a  better job by editing properly - the old US adds are not necessary, and by making picture clearer and deleting the background noise that at time takes over the entire show making it imossible to watch.
Do not waster your money.",1358208000,7,521,4.853932584269663
2696203,5,B000KMGN0O,"I received this great product from Amazon Partner Mary's Bargain Shop. The true test of a partner is what is done to correct a problem. When one of the disks in Volume One had an audio problem, Mary quickly sent a replacement- thus passing with ""flying colors""
  When the series, one of the greatest in the great ABC lineup, the recently deceased Gardner MacKay was THE heartthrob of all of the pre-teen girls in my class.
  The series was exciting and most enjoyable: Adventures in far off exotic lands with an implied moral at the end of each Adventure. This was a favorite that my parents also enjoyed.
  I was pleasantly surprised to see the set offered for just a bit over $100 for all 24 new DVDs at Amazon partner Mary's Bargain Barn. Sure, at times the transfer is not perfect BUT THIS IS ADVENTURES IN PARADISE!",1349395200,5,820,4.506756756756757
2696204,5,B000KMGN0O,This series was a favorite of mine when I was a kid. I think it would appeal to all ages. It's agreat example of a time when people didn't need special effects and violence to be entertained.,1340236800,2,191,4.1891891891891895
2696205,5,B000KMGN0O,"This product was everything I expected it to be.  Actually arrived much sooner than expected, this was a pleasant surprise.  Quality is great for an older black and white series.",1326153600,,178,4.9
2696206,2,B000KMGN0O,"The general production of this product is poor - particularly the vision and sound quality. Some DVDs have background noises that overpower the audio of the episodes.

While some loss of vision quality is expected in old movies etc - the poor vision & sound detracts from enjoying many of the episodes.

Better production is essential.",1321228800,18,335,4.964285714285714
2696207,1,B000KMGN0O,"Received in package labeled Adventures in Paradise. The actual discs were for Paradise / Guns of Paradise series starring Lee Horsely ( the only thing which was right)... TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED!!! The quality was horrible.  Some episodes did not play or would only play for a few minutes, and then stop. Shipped from China for approximately $25.00.  Very expensive with very poor quality.  Contacted customer service and was told that the problem was my DVD player was too old.  Replaced said player with a new Blu-Ray player.  Same problems and quality.  Total waste of money.
  DO NOT RECOMEND FOR ANYTHING!!!  EVEN RATING A ""ONE"" IS TOO HIGH!!!",1311465600,3,645,5.009433962264151
2696208,5,B000KMGN0O,"As this was the first time I have purchased anything on line I wasn't sure what to expect. Thank you for getting my order out to me so quickly and efficiently its been great especially as I'm laid up with a broken leg.
cheers alana",1302393600,,231,4.155555555555556
2696209,4,B000KMGN0O,"The opening credits atribute ""authorship"" of the series to James A. Michener and this is also listed in Wikipedia. I remember watching the series on TV when I was a child and I am very glad to have these DVD's available. For those who love Tahiti, Bora Bora, Tonga and the the South Seas there is no other source of this type of material featuring a roving South Pacific trader with multiple stories. Where else will you hear Pago Pago pronounced or even mentioned correctly. (Pronounced Pango Pango) At least one episode mentions the famous Papeete bar famous for wild drinking and it's unisex, no stalls, restroom (latrine, water closet,etc) One of my favorite episodes involves a Paul Gauguin ""like"" painter who's paintings are being widely sought and purchased while he is still alive and involves skulduggery to buy up all available art by this artist. While criticisms of this product are valid, some episodes are black with no picture available and other episodes are totally silent, it is like finding a partially finished manuscript by Raymond Chandler that is both a treasure and a disappointment because it is incomplete. SOMEONE NEEDS TO PUT OUT A BETTER COPY OF THIS MATERIAL. Until then I will continue to enjoy this flawed product because what was/is so valuable to me would otherwise be totally lost.",1300320000,,1316,4.9058295964125564
2696210,1,B000KMGN0O,"The quality of the transfers on these discs is just appalling. Somewhere, someone has the original b/w films. Please do us all a favour and re-master them, instead of peddling these third rate quality transfers on amazon customers. I, too, would pay good money to see this fabulous series given the treatment it deserves.
After all, it's the reason I jumped on a ship out of Australia and became a captain in the Merchant Marine.
Amazon should not even be selling such poor quality merchandise.",1290384000,69,494,4.823529411764706
2696211,4,B000KMGN0O,"I agree that the transfer could have been done more professionally [there are ghosts of 60's commercials throughout; sound sometimes drops off; picture is sometimes too dark] Many of us are, naturally, spoiled by High Definition; it's hard to imagine that 60p (yes, SIXTY) was an industry standard when this was shot so it's no small wonder that it suffers greatly in the transfer. All that notwithstanding, the stories have casts that are veritable who's who of TV and stage in the 1960's. Gardner McKay seems often a bit out of his element and it's obvious that the background and guest stars redeemed many an episode from floundering. Watch this for the slice of 60's TV Americana that it truly is.",1279670400,6,701,4.801652892561983
2696212,3,B000KMGN0O,"I was happy to recieve these cds of adventures in paradise. It takes me back a ways but unfortunatly some of the episodes are not easy to watch as they flutter and the sound is bad. But over all, it's fine. thankyou",1270684800,13,215,4.142857142857143

8158205,1,B000KMGN0O,"My Brother bought me this set some years ago and I have never had the courage to write a review.
Well I wish I could get him his money back.  This is the worst set of DVD's in existence - appalling quality transfer - I know he paid quite a bit for this set and it is a rip off entirely.  Please do not spend any money getting this set.
I loved this show so hoped that Amazon would sell a quality product as I have spent a lot of money and have never really had any problem.  I was so upset when I viewed the DVD's - even to the very last one.
The DVD's are hardly viewable.",1432944000,,573,3.7983193277310923
8158206,5,B000KMGN0O,"this show is my favorite tv program of all time,i was too little to remember it when it was on but my mom told me about it and so i watched an episode on you tube seven years ago and fell in love with it,most of the episodes take place in tahiti and the tropical isles in the south pacific and gardner mckay is wonderful as captain adam troy and his sailing ship is the tiki he is an korean vet who hires his boat out for customers for money and each episode is exciting as the next one i highly recommend this tv show",1425859200,2,518,3.942857142857143
8158207,3,B000KMGN0O,"I have never seen this on TV, just a couple of episodes on Youtube before they were
removed for copywrite infringement, the idea of a free lance sailor that moves freight
and people around the south Pacific is great, but the reviews of the picture quality
is not very good, and for a black & white show thats pretty bad. I enjoy the look and
feel of most movies from the 50s and 60s and have been fascinated with the South
Pacific since I saw Mutiny on the Bounty with Marlon Brando. but I am going to
wait and see if they come out with a version thats better quality.",1420848000,,568,4.172727272727273

8158209,3,B000KMGN0O,These are ok if all you want is remember those years but be aware the quality of the recordings is not the best. I bought it for my husband and he was happy with it.,1406246400,,165,3.742857142857143
8158210,4,B000KMGN0O,"Received promptly and have watched the first three disks. Some episodes are better quality than others; but I am enjoying reliving the TV series that inspired a love of the tropics, adventure and Gardner McKay in a young Missouri girl back in the 1960s.",1405209600,4,253,4.7727272727272725

8158212,1,B000KMGN0O,"I watched the original series of Adventures in Paradise on TV when I was a child ... fifty years ago ... and I loved it.  (OK, I loved Gardner McKay.)  I looked for years to find DVDs of the series and was so excited when I found this set ... until I received it and started watching.  Or, should I say ""tried to start watching"".

Most of the episodes are dominated by the sound of a projector clicking away, over the dialogue, which is often inaudible as a result.  The picture quality on most episodes is poor to appalling and some episodes simply do not appear.  Overall, the transfer quality doesn't even deserve the word 'quality' to be associated with it.  Why this kind of exploitative material is available on a reputable site like Amazon eludes me.

Surely, one day, whoever has the copyright to, and masters of, this series will realise that there is a market out here that would gladly purchase a decent set of DVDs of the series.  After all, if this rubbish sells, then a quality set will.

It just broke my heart trying to watch these.",1403049600,17,1048,4.439790575916231
