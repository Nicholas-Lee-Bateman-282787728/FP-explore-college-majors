5250710,5,B0092U7JSU,"I'll start by admitting that the plot to the entirety of the ""Outpost"" series so far is a bit silly but I can't help but admit that the series has some really fantastic original stuff in it. Both cool and gory this series is pretty badass in a multitude of bloody ways. Both Outpost and Outpost Black Sun have been scary, gory and yes even a bit silly from time to time. I mean lets face it, this is the closest thing we are ever going to get to a ""quality"" nazi zombie film right?

Outpost which was released in '08 was surprisingly a scary film. There were some true moments of terror and fear in the film. Such as the dead body sneaking up behind the solider, the torture scenes and the atmospheric nazi ghosts and settings. It really did scare the shit out of me from time to time. It was an independent horror film that really stood on its own and had some action and horror all mixed up into one package. I mean I enjoyed it alot!

And then here comes Outpost Black Sun. The sequel to Outpost which I was pretty pumped for since I heard it was going into production. And yes it delivered! The budget was greater, the acting was a greater step up from the first. There was a much larger multitude of gore, action and plot introduced which I thought was a great way to give the audience something even more than what we had received the first time. Outpost Black Sun had many more layers than Outpost and to that I have to give credit for. This film had some great scary moments too. I felt the film left an impact. And I had loads of fun with it!

If its one thing this series so far has illustrated it is that its shown that it can take its self seriously but also have fun with the idea of bringing the 4th Reich back from the dead. Some of it is laughable, some of it is scary, some of it is gore filled and violent and even some of it is action-packed. But overall I have give the series a triple thumbs up for being cool, original and fun all in its own right!",1352678400,36,1970,4.125
5250711,2,B0092U7JSU,"Having enjoyed the first part (Outpost) despite it's low budget and numerous flaws and plot holes, I was looking forward to the long awaited sequel.

Sadly this just goes to show that a bigger budget (I assume) and more studios & production companies sticking their oar in, doesn't necessarily make for a good film.

Won't go into great story detail other than to say that it lost just about all the dark moody and genuinely frighting aspects that worked so well in the first. Such as the limbo based WW2 German soldiers materialising in rooms behind characters and suddenly looming up behind them or stepping out of the dark to dispatch them (chilling for sure).

Here we have them turned into the usual Hollywood type monsters that lumber around dragging bodies about so the main characters can spy on them whilst hiding under a corpse or from behind furniture (which just makes them generic - swap them for Freddy or Leatherface or Jason or Michael Myres and chuck in a bunch of pretty teens to be killed one by one).
Also in the first, there was no urgency to their murdering, because they couldn't be killed and therefore just walked everywhere or as I said above appeared and disappeared in an instant. However here we have them chasing soldiers and the main characters almost 28 Days Later style, running around outside or walking around buildings making strange strangled squealing sounds.... why..?? (and fully visible which again takes the fright away somehow because they now run around in the daytime).

I read a review on IMDB saying something along the lines that in Jaws you hardly see the shark, yet in the sequels for some reason, the studios think the audience has to see more and more of it continually and it really doesn't work for the good, which is a similar failure here.

The EMP idea to disable the 'device' that keeps the soldiers in limbo, whilst isn't bad, why couldn't they just helicopter one in or drop it by parachute and remote activate it if it has a 6 mile radius...???

The old fraulein crow like witch introduced at the end was unnecessary and totally pointless and clearly only done for a cheap scare and to creep you out (we then go back to usual Hollywood routine and the family of backwoods cannibals where we see the mother suddenly appear) as there has never been an inkling that a woman was involved in the tests back during the war.

Won't point out any more issues I had with it as this would spoil the film by talking about the climax of the film

The main girl was very unconvincing as a 'Nazi Hunter' (assume this was just so they could get a female lead but it could have been done better by having her as a soldier or one of the villagers even) and why have the second male lead (played by a Brit) use a dodgy American accent..??

The British soldiers the leads team up with were almost all unlikeable and you don't spend long with them (thankfully), therefore you could care less about their fate and to be honest, they were about as professional as sending in a bunch of blokes you rounded up in a pub.

Perhaps because it lacked the likeable character played by Ray Stevenson and his 'charming' redneck buddy (and the rest of the soldiers to be fair) it just fell flat.

Wanted to like this as much as I did the first, but sadly it was a bit of a let down.",1347148800,7,3369,4.438511326860842

Granted, the science behind how the electromagnetism generated by the tech reanimates and weaponizes life is dodgy, but the acting is good and sells the premise.

5250723,3,B0092U7JSU,"Outpost II-Black Sun (2012)

 I enjoyed Outpost very much and I thought that the movie makers did a commendable job with a limited budget, or hardly any budget at all.  They successfully produced a profit making venture which gave them the courage and the funds to make a second stab at the movie business.  Outpost II-Black Sun improves on its predecessor in every respect.  Outpost II-Black Sun serves as an exemplar of what we want in a low budget Zombie flick.
 Set in the former Yugoslavia but like the first film the actual production took place in Scotland.  They used some of the same sets and to my eye might have used some clips from the first film.  The story spins out the tale of Nazi SS scientists near the end of the war doing fiendish experiments involving a combination of serum and an electrical device that exudes a unified field.  This results in a battalion of Zombie storm troopers, dormant until the device is re-started (see Outpost).  The Nazi Zombies have a terrifying aura about them.  The scientists apparently used big soldiers as their base stock.  Nearly all the observed Zombie kills of humans are done up close and personal with edged weapons or bludgeons.  The dead soldiers can use firearms and do so but seem to prefer to see the people they kill.  The Zombiefying process also degrades their speech ability and perhaps their intelligence.  They do however move at a scurry as their best speed.
 A lot of the movie is filmed in the dark or in smokey or misty conditions, which gives a scary edge to the whole enterprise.  We never know when some SS Oberwachmeister might come out of some dark corner of the underground outpost and grab somebody.  Which happens, giving us a nice startle reflex.
 Writer/director Steve Barker returns from his duties in Outpost.  His writing companion Rae Brunton also comes back to help write.
 The story opens with a young woman entering an old folks home in Paraguay.  She seeks very old Nazi war criminals.  Shortly she shifts to the former Yugoslavia where Lina meets up with Wallace, a science scavenger who is also looking for the Nazi lair.  She seeks revenge, he looks for loot.  In the first Outpost we had Ray Stevenson-one of my favorite actors-playing a leading role as a mercenary.  We have two accomplished actors in the new film in the leading roles.  Catherine Steadman plays Lina.  Steadman, young as she is, has a long string of credits including roles in About Time (go see it!), Salmon Fishing in the Yemen and everyone's favorite soap opera Downton Abbey.  She can really act.  Similarly, her co-star Richard Coyle has some 48 credits.  He also has excellent abilities.  Coyle has a recurring role in the TV spy show Covert Affairs.
 Good Nazi Zombies, good acting by genuinely talented and professional people, an acceptable plot and careful directing all weigh in on the positive side of the balance.  Only the small budget, however cleverly disguised, prevents this fine little Nazi Zombie film from getting more than three and a half brains.  I want to see the next in the series and see if they get more cash to spend on it.
 This UK made film does not have a rating but should be R for violence and very foul soldier language.  The dead Nazi soldiers mostly kill by stabbing or bashing the living.  The run time is one hour and 41 minutes, a bit longer than usual.
 I liked this one.  Some call this the best Nazi Zombie film to date.  This notion can be defended (but Dead Snow remains my favorite).",1419638400,,3496,4.656301145662848

5250725,4,B0092U7JSU,A very good sequel that picks up where the first left off.  This time around with a slightly larger budget the movie is packed with explosive firefights and impressive special affects.  In regards to the story it has some holes that will leave you scratching your head if you take it too seriously.  The movie itself has the feel of a big production with high production values which is darn impressive considering its 3 million dollar budget.

Take these geriatric, senile, decrepit, old guys into a UN court room and put them on trial when the only eye witnesses to the crimes are ALSO in their 80's or more than likely DEAD?  Plus they're so old that you can't put them in a prison into the general population, they need round the clock medical supervision.  All that you could really do to them is try to make them pay reparations, that is if they don't die halfway through the trial.  Or put them under house arrest, which won't matter, they can't go anywhere anyways!

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

Okay so our main character Lena tracks down this Nazi war criminal who is so old that he's in a wheelchair, is covered in age spots, has so many cataracts that he's practically blind.  Yes, quite a threatening antagonist for her to hunt down isn't he?

So she starts torturing him by snapping his fingers and he screams out in pain, and NOBODY hears him yelling out.  So is everyone who works at this retirement home deaf?  Then she finds some ""secret"" documents that are in his desk drawer.  They can't be too secret, because that's a pretty crappy hiding place.  Then she demands to know why the Nazi war criminal is funding some guy's research.  What research?  There was nothing there to indicate any research at all!  All she found was a map and some guy's driver's license, there was nothing on those documents mentioning any kind of research!  So how did she jump to the conclusion that there was some kind of research going on and this guy is funding it?

Moving on we find out that Lena is looking for some Nazi guy named Klausner, so she can kill him and then she feels that justice will be done.  Then she teams up with this physicist guy and they go into an active warzone to go find a Nazi superweapon.  Yes, I'm sure that the U.N. just lets people waltz into active warzones  and just pass right by their military checkpoints because the person said, ""Oh we're journalists,"" yet they show not one piece of ID to back this up.

Later they run into the Nazi zombies, but instead of actually biting or clawing their victims, these zombies just club their victims to death.  Plus the zombies are wearing Nazi uniforms from the 1940's and they are perfectly preserved.  No rips, tears, no mud, no blood, nothing.  They are in perfect condition even though they've been sitting on rotting corpses for almost 70 years.

Anyway, our two main characters meet up with a U.N. taskforce who is going in to disable the Nazi super weapon that is keeping the zombies invulnerable.  I won't bore you with the boring parts where the movie tries to give our military red shirts some kind of character development before they are killed.  Eventually they find the weapon and Lena takes the ""core"" of the weapon out.  Which by the way has some scientist dangling over it like the queen alien was in AVP, only he's apparently also a Sith Lord because he can also shoot purple lightning out of his fingers.

Eventually our physicist guy steals the weapon, betrays Lena and takes it to the Klausener guy and tries to sell it to him for like 50 million bucks or something.  Lena then calls him and tells him that he is now on her ""list"" and she is going to hunt him down.  What exactly is she going to do?  She could barely handle a senile, wheelchair-bound, geriatric guy.  Plus when they were in combat all she did was run away.  I'm not really sure what this little girl playing secret agent is going to do to the physicist.  I mean I see she now has a gun but I doubt she even knows how to use it.

She has one top dog left: Klausener (David Gant). Well it just so happens Klausener has created a magnetic zombie stormtroopers machine and is slowly taking over Eastern Europe. Lena gets caught in a war between the Stormtroopers and NATO.

The soldiers weren't zombies in the modern movie sense, although they pretty much acted like it and meet the definition. The film did not have the scare value of a horror film, but was more akin to an action/war film with zombies. Lena teams up with Wallace (Richard Coyle) to hunt them down.

I am not as excited about this film as I am other recent zombie films because it lacks the horror. The plot, sets, special effects, and acting were all par for this type of production. I enjoyed ""Gangsters Guns & Zombies"" more than this film. For a really good zombie film check out the new ""Night of the Living Dead.""

In this regard, these aren't your typical ""virus"" or ""evil"" curse type zombie flicks. In fact, I'm not sure ""zombie"" is technically the right nomenclature. At the end of WWII, you've got the Third Reich experimenting with quantum physics and Unified Field Theory to create an unstoppable army of death - they never left the bunker where these horrors originated. Though, that changes with events in the two movies as the ""machine"" is restarted.

is investigating  the Nazis and .....why bother....i really didn't care for her
acting as it messed up the movie....she did get a bit better near the end when
finally her face got dirty..but it was too late...
Looks like the filmaker wanter a female hero to continue the series...bad move
and to add more insults....they left the end of the movie opened for another
chapter.....that ticked me off....cant they just create good movies with quality
ending instead of looking for the next mini series.

All through the film, I kept thinking that Catherine Steadman could resurrect the Alien(s) series.  She is a good actress, and has what it takes to do an action film.  Could she be ""Newt""???  If we ignore Alien 3 and 4, why not???  She has my vote.  Anyway, this is a good film.  My dollars well spent.  Enjoy...",1358035200,2,454,4.481481481481482

5250775,3,B0092U7JSU,"Three words could describe this film, ""Zombie Nazi Stormtroopers."" Lena (Catherine Steadman) has spent her life hunting Nazi war criminals with her parents. She has one top dog left: Klausener (David Gant). Well it just so happens Klausener has created a magnetic zombie stormtroopers machine and is slowly taking over Eastern Europe. Lena gets caught in a war between the Stormtroopers and NATO.

The soldiers weren't zombies in the modern movie sense, although they pretty much acted like it and meet the definition. The film did not have the scare value of a horror film, but was more akin to an action/war film with zombies. Lena teams up with Wallace (Richard Coyle) to hunt them down.

I am not as excited about this film as I am other recent zombie films because it lacks the horror. The plot, sets, special effects, and acting were all par for this type of production. I enjoyed ""Gangsters Guns & Zombies"" more than this film. For a really good zombie film check out the new ""Night of the Living Dead.""

5250780,3,B0092U7JSU,"Let me start out by saying how much i loved the first one.. I found out about the original Outpost whilst on a hunting trip up north with family and friends. A friend had brought his collection of foreign movies and among them was a little gem called ""Outpost"". Outpost had everything a good independent horror film could have-especially for its incredibly small budget. A good script, good sets, phenomenal acting, and good effects.

Flash forward a few years, and the sequel has arrived. Excited, I rip open the box I received from amazon, put it in the DVD player, and let it rip. Now, I won't go into detail about the movie for fear of spoilers, but I will say this: you really need to watch it to decide for yourself whether its a good sequel to the first. I will say that it's like ""Aliens to Alien"", whereas the sequel is more of survival-action than of horror. The two main problems that I only had with the movie weren't of concern with the script or story, those aspects I think they got right with. The problems I had with were the atmosphere and the ""zombies"" themselves. Outpost had a really gritty, Gothic look to it that made you wonder what was around the corner, and the sequel, really, quite doesn't. The other main issue were the ""zombies"". Although the atmosphere tied in with this a bit, the nazis weren't supernatural ghosts, but more of an invincible army that screamed as if they were traditional zombies.

All in all, I think it's really up to you, the viewer, to decide. I personally didn't regret watching it, and after watching it twice, it has sunk in better for me. If you are a fan of the original Outpost or even if you're just a fan of nazi/zombie movies, give this a shot. You might find it enjoyable.

3/5 Stars",1354924800,11,1746,4.467084639498433
5250781,4,B0092U7JSU,"It's 1945. A German scientist, by the name of Klausener, is working on a new technology that has the power to create a massive army of Zombie Nazi. Present Day, Two investigators team up with a Special Forces Unit to venture deep inside a war that's raging between the military and that massive army of Nazi Zombie Stormtroopers. Their mission? to fight their way behind enemy lines, locate the technology at the source of this growing threat and prevent the inevitable rise of the 4th Reich.

Despite the fact that the plot sounds an awful lot like The Asylum's ""Nazis at the Center of the Earth"", I decided to give Outpost: Black sun a chance and I'm glad I did. While it might not be as entertaining as ""Nazis at the Center of the Earth""(watch that movie & you'll figure out what I'm saying), it certainly is engrossing and intense. More like a war movie than a Zombie Nazi movie. I really liked it and aim on hunting down the first movie.

One of the better zombie movies out there. I recommend it!",1353283200,16,1002,4.469945355191257

8534889,1,B0092U7JSU,"The first ""Outpost"" was quite a unique ""merc"" action film with enough skilled writing, plot twists and good acting where you cared where the film went and what happens to the characters. I even purchased the film because it was a surprisingly good flick.

Unfortunately, ""Black Sun"" went the way of the stereotypical industry garbage. Since there wasn't a woman in the first film, I guess the makers of ""Black Sun"" felt the need to go all-out by having an obnoxious, big-mouth female character who (after twisting the fingers of an extremely old man at the beginning) does absolutely nothing except get soldiers killed. Oh, she also feels the need to shame them into action because she (not even being 25 years old?!?) is some heralded war crimes hunter who always gets her man. What a crock.

At times, it amazes me how one character can torpedo a film, but it stands true in this one. Did the various people working on the script not realize she was a complete drag on the film? Either way, this sequel sucked. The good news: there's a third installment focusing on the Spetsnaz... not sure if I'll bother.",1471564800,,1108,4.676923076923077
