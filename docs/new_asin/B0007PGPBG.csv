The overall experience was akin to watching a very brief amateur video of a 1960's sock hop. No introduction, no commentary, no useful information. A poor investment of $27.00.",1283212800,6,341,4.7
8050223,1,B0007PGPBG,"I paid over $27 including shipping for this DVD and was truely disappointed.  The movie is in B&W showing only one dance that lasted less than 10 minutes. I did not learn anything nor get anything out of this DVD.  It is truely a waste of time and money.  Again, please do not buy this DVD and waste your money.",1263168000,12,311,4.15
