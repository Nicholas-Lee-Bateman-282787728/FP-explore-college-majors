2244849,2,B0007US7E4,"I saw this movie last night and have to say that the premise for the movie,an online game with a hellraiser cult worshipper party, is excellent.

This opened up all kinds of plot variation possibilities .

Unfortunately,after the first 20 minutes the movie goes downhill fast and the plot becomes really scattered and erratic.

The cast,other than Lance Hendrikson ,is very forgettible and you really don't care much about them at all.

They're just cardboard cut-outs with no ppersonality.

It's not much of a slasher movie and there's hardly any horror.

It felt like they were just making plot up as they went along.

The real cenobites were non-existent basically until the last few minutes and they might have well left them out of the film entirely for what impact they had.

I know that if i wrote the script and had the chance to have pinhead and crew encounter a whole house of 200 partying hellraiser fans who thought they were bad-ass there would have been some funny,nasty stuff happen but they wasted this opportunity completely.

The explanation of what happened during the movie by lance's character  at the end of the film was really lame.

Hopefully the next Hellraiser installment will be better.",1126051200,,1214,4.873170731707317
2244850,1,B0007US7E4,"I recently went back & watched Hellraiser 5-8. I enjoyed the films, it's like a television series featuring Pinhead. It's like Twilight Zone or Freddy's Nightmares. Anyways, this one basically takes every teen horror film clich of the last decade & throws it into this film. I liked Hellraiser series because it's for adults & Clive Barker imagery. There is no teens running around getting slaughtered & Pinhead isn't making jokes like Freddy Kruger. This film takes the first 7 films & craps all over them. It is like we need a new audience so lets try every clich we can think of. The film is basically Hellraiser is a game played by teens & they are invited to a party for the game. The black dude is one of the most annoying, stereotypical characters in horror film history. The story is confusing & made for teens rather then adults. It sucks, avoid but recommend the other films.",1125964800,,885,4.6075949367088604

Not only are their opinions meaningless....but their star ratings end up skewering the overall average - also making the star system meaningless. There should be some mechanism in place not to allow ""pre-reviews"" - or at the very least, to not allow them to assign stars.

2244854,5,B0007US7E4,"I must admit, after seeing ""Hellraiser: Deader"" (See my review for that for info! Dont worry, no spoilers included.) I do hold some hope for this 8th film in the series.

Sadly after ""Hellraiser: Inferno"" and ""Hellraiser: Hellseaker"" I thaught this franchise was finished but ""Hellraiser: Deader"" does seem to bring some life back into it. The thing I am really hoping for in ""Hellraiser: Hellworld"" is more appearances from the almighty ""Cenobites"".

I know people complain about them but they are what sustains ""Hellraiser"" and to make this series great again we need more about them. Hellraiser was never better than when the cenobites played a major part like in ""Hellraiser"", ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"", ""Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth"" and ""Hellraiser: Bloodline"". Its no conincendce that the films began to slide when the ""Cenobites"" apperances became more rare.

I just hope this sequel adds to the series and there are ""Cenobites"" is abundance!",1119225600,2,952,5.1688311688311686

Both this and Hellraiser: Deader have been complete and sitting around for the better part of two years.  Not sure why the delay--even Doug 'Pinhead' Bradley didn't know the reasons behind the holdup in a recent interview.

Hoping these films are faithful, at least.  The last two films weren't bad at all, even for straight-to-DVD releases.  I thought they kept the spirit of the Hellraiser stories while limiting the gore and the Pinhead-isms, using the Cenobites as framework for two demented tales.  A shame they didn't use Kristy Cotton a little more in her return, but what can you do?

2244864,2,B0007US7E4,"And so my quest to watch the Hellraiser sequels continues, although up until now I've been mildly surprised, don'y get me wrong they're not great, but have been watchable. Until I watched this one. My interest was piqued when I saw Lance Henrikson's name on the credits as he's usually entertaining to watch, but while he is the best part of the film he isn't enough on his own to lift it.

The main issue is that it's fairly standard horror with the Hellraiser element being little more than branding for a fairly pedestrian series of deaths. The setup was mildly interesting in that there is an online game based on the cenobite mythos, winning the game grants an invitation to a Hellworld party and it's at the party that the victims meet the host, played by Lance Henrikson.

There are a few twists along the way, but for the most part it lacks imagination. The cenobite appearences are little more than slasher murders and lack the disturbing pain/pleasure combination that the series is famed for.

Eventually we reach the end and there's a series of reveals that managed to raise an eyebrow, but only in congratulation to myself at predicting their occurence. I've not watched them all, but for me this is the worst Hellraiser sequel yet.",1389916800,,1245,4.701834862385321

2244867,1,B0007US7E4,"Whenever a Great movie spawns multiple sequels you are guaranteed that everybody will have an opinion on which movie is the worst.
But here are some clear concrete reasons why this movie is to be avoided unless your the type who must experience everything possible.

1) This originally wasn't even a Hellraiser movie. It was an idea that movie writers couldn't sell to the studios until some ""Genius"" said ""Hey lets tweak it 5% and slap a proven name on it and pass it off as Hellraiser."" *gag*

2) This might be the best reason why to miss this. Pinhead and the cenobites have less than 5 minutes of air time (Approx) in a 95 minute movie... And technically they really aren't even really in the movie until the last few minutes...

You see this movie tells you that videogame makers (I love videogames but not here)make an online videogame based on the Hellraiser mythos.
It gains a following. a group of friends go to the funeral of a friend who killed himself because he was obsessed with the game.
Then they all go back to playing it until everybody wins an invite to a SECRET Hellraiser Party held in this huge house somewhere.
They arrive and all these ""Hellraiser Fans"" are stripped down to horny teenager stereotypes.
The Gang of Friends are drugged by some guy and they start tripping and dieing...
There is a secret of who actually kills them and how...but I won't spoil it for those who decide to watch this as it is the only part of the movie that was sorta good...and yet horribly ruined the movie at the same time because you realize too late that this creative twist proved you were conned by the hellraiser name.
I watched this...and here is my last word.
If you can get this dirt cheap or free go for it...but other wise watch all the other Hellraisers. Even Watch ""Revelations"" trust me that movie didn't deserve the hate it got...If you wanna know why read my review on that movie...I gave Revelations 4 stars because I ACTUALLY WATCHED IT UNLIKE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO POSTED 1 STAR REVIEWS BEFORE IT WAS EVEN RELEASED WHEN THEY FOUND OUT PINHEAD WASN'T BEING ACTED BY DOUG BRADLEY.

2244879,3,B0007US7E4,I got this because as a fan I wanted to collect all the movies. This was disappointing more of a saw movie the a hellraiser.,1369612800,,124,4.0
2244880,4,B0007US7E4,"Lance Henriksen really helped this movie.  He adds so much to any and all films he does.  He's the only reason this was 4 stars and not 3.

It stayed more or less within the known facts of the Hellraiser series to the extent that it attempted to use them at all.  It updated the series by relating it to a game called Hellworld.  Interesting idea.  That sort of makes it all right to deviate from the real Hellraiser movie since few games are exact matches to the movie they mimic and vice versa.

The plot was okay and much of the acting was good (Lance was GREAT of course.)  I liked Winnick the best and Cavill the least of the young cast members.  Doug Bradley as always was great as pinhead, though it seems to me he had fewer pins this time than previously.  I'd have to go back and look at that in the original, but it just seemed different to m.

The script had its moments of good dialogue and action, and in the end, that's all I have come to expect from this type of movie.  After all, its number 8!  At least it took a different tack this time with the Hellworld game concept.

All in all, I'd recommend it to Horror fans and even Hellraiser fans, though Hellraiser purists are not going to like the deviation from the original story.  Of course, pretty much all of the recent ones have deviated quite a bit from the original.  I'd too would like to see a remake of the original with additional material to explain things better or at least a sequel that really stuck to the story line and filled it out a lot more.  I hope those who take my recommendation will enjoy it!",1369267200,,1583,4.223333333333334

Plenty of nail biting moves that keep you clued to the chair waiting for the next thing to pop up around the corner. Actors did a great job playing their roles and convincing you it was really happening. Story goes as five gamers are invited to a special party thrown by Hellworld,  the unforgettable terror they receive is unspeakable and with Lance Henriksen playing in the movie it's got to be fabulous. Well no more clues as not to spoil it. The special effects are fantastic helping this movie being rated an A grade plus. It's creepy and full on horror and suspense so go get the movie, pick up the popcorn and put your feet up and relax while watching this marvelous thriller.

2244882,3,B0007US7E4,"Five friends find themselves in a fight for their lives when a popular role-playing game based on the Hellraiser movie series comes to life and starts killing them one by one. HELLRAISER: HELLWORLD comes from the same breed of low-end pop Slashers that gave us films like HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION and STAY ALIVE, trying its hardest to be hip and edgy while failing at both. Lance Henriksen stars as the mysterious millionaire that gathers game players for the annual Hellworld party, but unlike in PUMPKINHEAD 3 and 4, he actually manages to have some fun with the tired old material. Although certain artifacts and elements from the video game are taken from Barker's world, the inclusion of Pinhead and the Cenobites seems incidental to the plot, as if the characters have just been plugged into some other generic script with the HELLRAISER name slapped on it. What it lacks in depth, HELLWORLD at least makes up for in gore, but even the deaths and special effects are tame when compared against series that spawned it. The sappy ending shows just how little the writers know or care about the source material, tying a cute pink ribbon around the film that reassures us that everything is going to be OK.

This movie had the potential to be a really good movie. I like the concept of the film. One reveiwer stated it made the Hellraiser community look like a bunch of h0rny teenagers... Well,...I agree...because we WERE. It pokes fun at the whole horror/goth society, horror movies and Hellraiser franchise. Once in a while, you need a movie that doesn't take itself so seriously. Very tongue-in-cheek.

Unfortunately, the majority of the acting is substandard. But even if it had good acting, it would still feel more like an episode of Tales From The Dark Side, or Hammer House Of Horror, than a Hellraiser film. The film quality looks like video and not quality cinematography. Cheap shock, cheap gore and cheap T'n'A...which...is what you'd expect. Right?

2244887,3,B0007US7E4,"This not a review of the film, its a review of the Blu Ray TRANSFER itself from a non-tech language savvy guy.

DO NOT buy any Miramax BD's! So far they all look the same.

I bought Hellworld, From Dusk Till Dawn 3, Dracula 2000 and others. They all look the same.

If you've ever seen an 80s movie where the scenes take place in a smoke filled bar, then that is exactly what you are gonne be watching in these so called
""Stunning Hi Def 1080p"".... Uh....Yeah...Right. Hi Def mosquito noise more like it, but if you like watching mosquito noise in HD, then this is for you.
If you've ever watched the Blu Ray of Predator then you know exactly what I'm talking about.

In my opinon there are no artifacts or ""jaggies"" like you get watching an upscaled dvd. So its actually above an upscaled 1080i dvd, but below a true 1080p BD.
Pulse on BD is another hideous BD transfer. That one is even worse than Predator.

Blade is just like all these BUT Blade 2 was actually very nice, not WOW!!! but decent BD transfer.

The colors are flat, they are not bright, but the picture is sharp in the sense that there are no artifacts. Just that never ending cloud of smoke, mosquito noise etc.

You feel like you need to wipe your tv screen down. These movies actually ten times better on dvd watched on a standard tv (which thankfully I kept)

Also most of these have no sub-titles. I actually like watching movies with sub titles on but thats just my pref.

You have been warned.",1346630400,,1467,4.324817518248175
2244888,3,B0007US7E4,"Given the nature of the last four Hellraiser movies, I've felt for the past two weeks like I've been in one of them myself. Everything is disconnected, it all has vague connections to reality, I see hints of familiarity, but then, without warning, I find myself somewhere else with a sense of dj vu and lost time and oh look, there's Pinhe--oh wait, he's gone again. And then the dream starts over, like watching an old 8mm film on which someone has spilled their Pepsi and the syrup from the drink has gummed up the works and then I leave the room to get a drink and I come back and oh look, there's Pinhe--oh wait, he's gone again. Then the dream starts over again, this time somewhere else and I'm surrounded by different people and oh look, there's Pinhe--dang, missed him again. But this time Lance Henrikson is there, so that's always good, at least. And Henry Cavill managing very well to NOT pull off a convincing or consistent American accent. All I can say is I hope he does better in THE MAN OF STEEL.

Anyway, so HELLRAISER: Hellworld is the 8th installment of this franchise and the 4th in a row to begin life as something other than a Hellraiser movie. Originally, Hellworld was a story by Joel Soisson called ""Dark Can't Breathe."" But apparently it's become the in thing to take a movie that's not a Hellraiser movie and make it into one anyway, like Smokey's mother in FRIDAY. ""That's not enough."" ""Make it enough.""

The story this time revolves around a group of friends of indeterminate age, a group of 5, the player, the black guy, the goth chick, the pretty girl, and the angry guy (usually this character is the nerd, and I have a feeling that Christopher Jacot's ""Jake"" character is definitely smarter than the rest of the gang, but in this story he's more angry than anything), all of whom are mourning the death of their friend Adam who died as a result of his addiction to an online game called Hellworld, which is basically a role-playing game centered around the Hellraiser mythology.

Two years after the funeral, the gang is still playing, and they all win invitations to a Hellworld party, held at the Leviathan House, and hosted by Lance Henrikson who is, as usual, 10 kinds of cool and 15 kinds of scary as sht!

The Host takes the gang around the house, filling them in on its history. It was the second crowning achievement of Philip LeMarchand and has been during its history both a convent and an insane asylum. Now it's just Hellworld party central. The Host gives everyone a faceless mask with a number printed across the forehead. Everyone gets cell phones. If you see someone amid the crowd you like, just dial the number on their forehead and sneak off somewhere to do whatever it is horny young people do in movies like this. Or rather in lesser movies, because dangit this is Hellraiser, and from the beginning this franchise has established itself as being something more than its contemporaries. How the mighty have fallen.

So the gang all go their separate ways, lose themselves in the crowd, and one by one begin to fall victim to the machinations of the Lament Configuration. Except, in this movie, the puzzle box, the Cenobites, Pinhead himself, it's all just part of a made-up mythology. So how can Pinhead be appearing to the ""kids"" only moments before they die?

The answer to this and other questions is FAR from original, but I have to admit, even knowing what it was before I watched the movie didn't ruin the experience for me. In fact, I probably liked it even more BECAUSE I knew ahead of time what was what. I think otherwise, if I'd gone into this movie cold, I would have simply dismissed it as one more reality-altering mind warp Hellraiser sequel. Instead, this one plays like a typical slasher movie, but with a very different climax and resolution. The payoff here works. It's a disappointing addition to the Hellraiser franchise, but as a movie in and of itself, I think it works. But really that just makes me wish I'd seen this as the ""Dark Can't Breathe"" story instead. I think I can figure out pretty much what details would have had to be changed to make the DCB to Hellraiser transition, and I can see what plot details were probably true to the original, and, yes, I think I'd have liked the original story better.

This is Rick Bota's third time directing a Hellraiser movie, and I think this is probably the best job he's done. He doesn't get any better a performance from this cast than he has either of the previous two movies (with the obvious exception of Dean Winters in Hellseeker), but at least he manages to make the real world/hell transitions a LOT smoother and less grating, which goes a long way.

Again, Doug Bradley has almost nothing to do in this movie--even LESS than he did in his 10 minutes of screentime in Deader--and it's getting really old. I could see some justification for the 5th movie being a retrofitted non-Hellraiser script if they felt it was time for another sequel but hadn't written one yet. Once I can understand. But 4 times? Come on, man, you mean to tell me there are NO actual Hellraiser scripts in Hollywood? Maybe something that returns the series to its roots, where the Cenobites were an actual force to be feared? I believe the original idea was those who opened the box were seeking to expand their understanding of the limits of pleasure and pain and the Cenobites were there to administer it. That was a Hell that intrigued me. But from Hellraiser 5-8 Hell is just a Mobius strip of bad dreams and comeuppance. Big friggin' deal. I want mythology, I want progression of the SERIES, I want consistency and continuity. I don't think that's asking too much.

HELLRAISER: Hellworld is an interesting idea, an okay movie, but it does absolutely nothing in helping to return the Hellraiser franchise to required-viewing status. But at least it had Lance Henrikson.",1343779200,3,5882,4.621052631578947

2244902,3,B0007US7E4,"Since this one's been out a while, I'll leave out the review of the actual movie...this is for those who are curious how the blu ray presentation is.

So far I've hated Echo Bridge's horror blu rays...it's no secret that they've been doing some poor and sloppy work from the mastering to the graphic design.  But being a loyal Hellraiser fan I decided to get this  anyway as a potential replacement for my DVD.

I first put it in and was on the brink of complaining...soft, kinda grainy picture, yellowish and faded.  But then I put in the DVD for comparison, and that's how that opening scene looks.  I could tell the blu ray is sharper...not night and day, but you can see a difference.  After watching some more, I decided I'm pretty happy with it.  It isn't really demo material for your HDTV, but that could very well be due to the quality of the source material.

Picture is cropped to 1.78:1 while the DVD is 1.85:1...doesn't make much of a difference to me.  Audio sounded nice all the way thru - 5.1 surround, bassy where appropriate.

There is only one special feature - the commentary from the DVD.  I don't like listening to commentaries over movies, so I'll never use that.  They left off the behind the scenes thing...not a big loss, but it's something I probably would've watched again.  So... pretty much a fail in the special features department for me.

It has the movie in decent quality.  If that's all you're looking for, this is a worthy purchase.  I wouldn't recommend paying much more than $15 for it unless you love it and have to have it.  I'd say this upgrade makes me hate Echo Bridge a little less.",1311897600,8,1627,4.494880546075085
2244903,2,B0007US7E4,"Throughout the years we've seen the face of the ""Hellraiser"" series, Pinhead, go through many personality changes and strange journeys. Whether he was kept in the shadows or presented as a Freddy Krueger-type who enjoys his job just a little too much, it's safe to say that there's never been much consistency with the character. Likewise, we've seen him thrust into deep space and slum in a cheesy night club as well. It's safe to say at this point that ""Hellraiser"" fans have come to expect this series to try just about anything. True to form, this eighth outing pegs Pinhead as an internet phenomenon and host to a wild and crazy party. Sure, why not. ""Hellraiser: Hellworld"" it is.

Doug Bradley returns -- yet again -- as Pinhead and slashes his way through an assortment of b-grade college kids. This time his playground is the large house of a mysterious and wealthy man, played by Lance Henriksen. It doesn't take long before the lame-brained characters fall victim to their own devices, and as the plot twists and turns towards its nonsensical ending, we wish them a quick and speedy death. Director Rick Bota dishes up his third serving of ""Hellraiser"" and it's safe to say at this point that he knows the game well enough. In spite of a silly and dated script, Bota delivers with a film that at least looks good and boasts some surprisingly solid special effects. Sure, the characters are terrible (ranging from bland to grating) and Henriksen is obviously in auto-pilot mode throughout, but there's a sort of cheap charm that works in the film's favor. At the end of the day, you feel dumber having watched the film, but at least you got some cheap and cheesy b-horror amusement out of a cash-in flick with the ""Hellraiser"" name slapped on it.

In all honesty, ""Hellraiser: Hellworld"" is hardly the worst thing to happen to the ""Hellraiser"" series. Truth be told, this franchise was sent to Hell many a sequel ago. Who could blame the Weinsteins for cashing in? At least on some level, this chapter delivers cheap entertainment that can be enjoyed on some level. Whether that level be of the heavily intoxicated or not is left up to you, the potential viewer. Expect something on par with the 1987 classic and prepare for disappointment; lower your standards a bit and revel in some cheap entertainment you might.",1293667200,,2326,4.7407407407407405

2244905,2,B0007US7E4,"To start this one off, let me first say that this film is not really worthy of carrying the Hellraiser title.  Do you remember the ""Freddy's Nightmares"" TV series or the ""Friday The 13th"" TV series?  Remember how they carried the names and the titles of their predecessors but none of the story?  This is similar in concept, though it does actually feature the cenobites and the Lament Configuration -- the puzzle box.  But without these most obvious characteristics there is very little in the story to link it to the Hellraiser film franchise.  The story completely deviates from the Hellraiser path.

What I find most disappointing about this film is that the bulk of the lead characters are taken out of the game so fast that you don't even get a chance to like or hate them.  And the characters themselves seem very shallow and petty and uninteresting. So, the bulk of the main characters that you are exposed to early on in the film are essentially inconsequential to the story, which cheapens the viewing experience.

A difficult part of the movie to tolerate is the constant feeling that the movie is not following any kind of plot, that it is just a bunch of scare scenes cobbled together.  I was pleasantly surprised at the end to discover that this feeling was wrong.  Throughout the bulk of the movie, the story has little cohesion and makes very little sense, which can be somewhat frustrating to sit through, but if you can wait patiently until the end, the writer actually did a decent job of wrapping up the story and giving you closure.

As for the horror aspect of the movie, I have to say that it is mediocre.  There are moments that are somewhat suspenseful, but all-in-all you generally know what is coming and when it does come it is not that scary.  The beauty of the Hellraiser franchise is that, even though there is the concept of gateways into hell and demons like the cenobites, the real horror can be found in the normal humans and their greed and selfishness and the hellish aspect is purely the gavel coming down in judgment of the accused -- and maybe the bystander as well.  This movie touches on this concept only vaguely and generally deviates from the normal Hellraiser course to a point where they should have just changed the whole theme entirely and taken ""Hellraiser"" out of the title.

To sum it all up, I think this movie would have been far more enjoyable were it _not_ a Hellraiser film and instead were its own, unique slasher film.  Had they done that they probably could have better augmented the story and the characters and built more on the suspense and mystery to make a more well-rounded and complete film.",1283644800,3,2658,4.623404255319149
2244906,5,B0007US7E4,"Hellraiser: Hellworld follows this basic premise:

There is a game on the web called ""Hellworld,"" which people play, and get addicted to. Very modern of course, more so than the creepy underground cult people from the equally (if not better) Hellraiser: Deader. One kid gets too obsessed, and not unlike some predecessors, meets a deadly end. The kids in the movie were the closest thing he had to family, but they keep playing the game. They all ""win"" tickets to a secret Hellworld party, where ""The Host"" (played by Lance Henriksen)is well, the host.
What happens? He brought them there, because he is the father of ""Adam,"" the kid who died. In reality, all of them are presumably drugged and asleep, suffering Hellraiser delusions to real-life deaths. One uses a cell phone after waking up and manages to save I believe herself and one other guy.
What ensued was extremly gruesome, like Deader is up to par with the first 4 (if not 2) movies, as Inferno and Hellseeker both lacked in the usual bloodshed that should come with Hellraiser. This happens in the Leviathan House. There is someone getting stabbed by a giant hook, which includes appearances by Pinhead of course, but also the teeth chatterer, and another new cenobite who has like leather bands around his face, he is pretty cool. Blood falls everywhere.

For some reason people have been off this series since ""Hellbound"" (which was by far the best in the series), but they need to give all of the sequels (except Hellseeker which was nothing but a bad copy of Inferno)a chance. Everyone but Hellseeker is very unique in storytelling, they have different styles, functions, and Hellraiser: Hellworld is no exception.
Here's to hoping the remake/reboot can live up to the Hellraiser Legacy. It is by far one of the better horror series, filled with horrifying terror and far above the normal level of acting in horror movies.

Reccomended: All of the Hellraiser movies, in this order: Hellraiser, Hellraiser2: Hellbound, Hellraiser3: Hell On Earth, Hellraiser: Bloodline, Hellraiser: Inferno, Hellraiser: Deader, and Hellraiser: Hellworld.

2244908,3,B0007US7E4,"This is the eighth Hellraiser entry.  I love this series, but it's not always ""good.""  I think the films are fun, but I wouldn't recommend them to most people unless they're a fan of, say, Evil Dead or Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn.  These are graphic, bloody films (but no more so than the Hostel films or most Friday the 13th entries).  But that's part of the fun of slasher/monster films.

So it should come as no surprise this entry is entirely unoriginal.  Using Lance Henriksen to draw fans of Aliens in a dwindling horror series?  Been there (see - actually, don't see - Pumpkinhead 4: Blood Feud, Screamers: The Hunting, The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena, Scream 3, etc.).  The tag line, ""Evil goes online?""  Been there (the cover is an almost direct copy of The Matrix including colors and just alters The Matrix tag line, ""The future will not be user friendly"").  A website that can kill you?  Been there (feardotcom, Halloween: Resurrection, Pulse, etc.).  A giant party promoting debauchery by some stranger?  Been there (An American Werewolf in Paris, From Duck 'Till Dawn, etc.).

So what DOES Hellraiser: Hellworld offer?  Doug Bradley and Henriksen in reliably strong performances and actually challenge the heroes for screen time, which is a nice change in this series.  Hellworld also offers far more intentional humor than the usual dread-drenched or unintentionally funny Hellraiser entry.  I thought the film was enjoyable and fun, but as a bad film.

This film is certainly not well-made with questionable special effects, a nonsensical script, horrid acting often lacking any emotion, boring and stagnant cinematography lacking any creativity, and even sometimes predictable death scenes.

Nowhere near the quality of the first two feature films, but enjoyable none the less. ""Hellworld"" actually has a decent premise, and by throwing Lance Henriksen into the mix it should be a winner. Unfortunately, this latest entry in Pinhead's series is just a painfully dull 1980's slasher style rehash.

The basic storyline for ""Hellworld"" is that there is a massive online game called ""Hellworld"" and several friends have become addicted to playing. One friend's obsession actually leads to his own suicide. The remaining friends blame themselves for letting things go so far and this upsets them for about 4 minutes, until they receive an invitation to a secret ""Hellworld"" party being held in a huge mansion. Lance Henriksen plays the sinister host, and things begin to go downhill very quickly as the friends find themselves playing for their lives.

Gratuitous nudity and sex, throw in some gore, and almost every horror cliche available and you have 80 minutes of film padding. If you are into cheap scares, illogical storylines and lousy treatment of the cenobites, then you will enjoy this film. If you are looking for a genuine ""Hellraiser"" film, go back to an earlier entry...or simply wait as I hear Clive Barker is helming a remake of the original film, but avoid ""Hellworld"".",1234742400,2,1423,5.02542372881356

2244921,5,B0007US7E4,"I'm really not sure as to why everyone seems to hate this movie so much. After reading all of the negative reviews, I approached the idea of watching this movie with a severe sense of trepidation. I have enjoyed all of the Hellraiser films, so I wasn't really understanding how 1 of them could have been so horribly bad, while the others seem to have gotten ok review. Well, I sat down last night and pressed play. To my amazement, this movie was heads and tails better than the last few sequels.

I think what everyone is complaining about is the complete deviation from the traditional ""Hellraiser approach"". The atmosphere has a much more updated feel to it, almost in a Generation X Scream kind of way. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Scream was a great comeback for the slasher horror genre, but there HAVE been some pretty poor attempts at copying that style of movie. Hellraiser: Hellworld though, I think, succeeds at being a very clever update of the traditional Hellraiser theme. I think the problem with the last few Hellraiser movies was the fact that they were trying to capitalize on variations of the same old theme. The movies were fun, but a little stale. This movie seems to rejuvinate the same concept with an updated theme.

I really don't think people are seeing how clever the theme of this movie is. Much like Blair Witch 2, (which was just as critically reviled), this is really a movie about a movie. For some reason, people seem to hate that concept, almost as if the movie doesn't belong in purely a fantasy realm anymore, but is a possible reality. This tends to hit a little closer to home, with the violence being less fantastical, but a little more realistic. Speaking of violence, there is much to be found here. Gore galore! I don't think that I have actually seen violence this visceral since the first 3 Helraiser films. The special effects are great, especially considering this, as well as the last few Hellraiser films, were straight to video sequels. The acting is also pretty decent. no Oscar winners here, but the acting fits the movie really.

Pinhead DOES make a more balanced appearance in this movie as opposed to the brief cameos of the last few films. The Cenobites are also in the film and, as usual, are quite unsettling in there appearance. No complaints there. Lance Henrickson also does quite a good job as the Host of the Hellworld party. He just has that sinister air in every role he plays. Good stuff!.

All in all, I think this is a clever, enjoyable film that people are not really seeing for what it is, and if you like good horror, I think you ought to give it a shot.",1233100800,2,2632,4.569915254237288
2244922,1,B0007US7E4,"This movie actually plays out more like feardotcom or a million other ""the interwebs is teh bad"" movies (popular of late) mashed up with haunted house movies. It's mildly watchable if it's on cable and there's nothing else on, but not particularly recommended. Lance Henrickson turns in his standard character performance. Pretty generic stuff.

Also, metafilmic themes were actually explored competently in Wes Craven's New Nightmare, whereas in this it feels like a plot device to shove in Hellraiser material and reference it for a new audience.

Here's the problem with the movie - it's not a Hellraiser movie. It has virtually nothing to do with the franchise in tone, or theme. The makers tried to update the franchise into being a teen slasher flick. They failed, miserably. The use of Hellraiser material is incidental and is in no way central to the story. I have a lingering suspicion that this was a script for another movie with Hellraiser elements shoved in at the last revision.

2244923,1,B0007US7E4,"""This place has nothing to do with the box,"" says Hellraiser enthusiast, Chelsea (Katheryn Winnick).  The young blonde is referring to a strange Hellraiser party that she and her friends were invited to after solving an online version of the Lament Configuration (the Hellraiser puzzle box).  Have I said the word ""Hellraiser"" enough times?  Let me say it again: Hellraiser.

I'm sorry.  I'm repeating myself because I really wanted to watch a Hellraiser film, and just as Chelsea observes, this thing isn't even close.  The movie and the party it's about are cheap, showy, and barely convincing.  And, let me hammer it home, they have little to nothing to do with the franchise that Clive Barker made a name setting up.

But I'm pragmatic, and I'm not some kind of Hellraiser junkie.  I can enjoy a movie on its own terms, if that's what it deserves.  So, ignoring for the moment that this pretty much bankrupts a once promising premise, if this isn't really about Hellraiser, what IS it about?

Five friends who ARE Hellraiser junkies find themselves gathered at the funeral of a sixth, who apparently took the mythos too seriously, ending his life in a fit of role playing passion.  Two years later, the five still dabble a bit (now Pinhead's box is web-based), and one day they all receive a special invitation to the aforementioned party.  Once there, bloody and boring things begin to happen.

One of the five is an inconsolable fellow named Jake, who is bitter and judgemental of the other four.  He attends this erotic S&M party, but broods from room to room, scowling and refusing to have a good time.  The other four enjoy the house and its oddities with stupid and over-acted enthusiasm.  They are the kind of people who spray themselves in the face with a stranger's antique, collector's-edition Hellraiser perfume.  Without even asking!  They say the phrase, ""It's just a game,"" around fifty or sixty times, and then they die right on cue.  The deaths are a brief but welcome change of pace, because these haunted house nuts are, of course, asking for it.

They're a lively bunch, though, especially the asthmatic Derrick (Khary Payton), who mugs and camps his way from line to line.  When he's playing the online Hellword game, we mostly see his unconvincing smile and vacant, eager eyes.  What glimpses we are given of the computer game don't make it look very interesting or well-made.  That's the movie for you.  And much like a computer game you spend two years of your life mastering, at the end of it you have to ask yourself if it was really worth your time.",1227830400,2,2579,4.741573033707865

* Too campy for scary or atmosphere, not campy enough for a Saturday Night Live feel.

* Characters are shallow and are billed as hardcore gamers, but come across as being technological Luddites.

* Story has holes you could drive a bus through, end result, you just don't care.

* I'm a photographer and so am sensitive to camera work in a film, this had poor composition, amateurish and garish lighting and was uninspired in use of props and environments.

* How many CDs does it take to hold the soundtrack on? Several, I'd guess as the songs changed every 30 seconds. Yet another splinter to remind you that you are wasting your time on this poor product.

That's what I felt coming into this episode with no expectations. This is the ""The Crow - Wicked Prayer"" for the Hellraiser series.

2244926,2,B0007US7E4,"What is it with my favorite Horror franchises just majorly falling apart around their eighth (and usually final) entry? Michael Myers becomes a game show contestant in Resurrection, Freddy Krueger gets ""real"" in New Nightmare, Jason Voorhees buys a ticket-to-ride to the big apple and turns into a child in the process in Jason Takes Manhattan, and even Pinhead himself becomes a slasher-for-hire in Hellworld.

I guess when Horror characters get long in the tooth, the powers that be just try too hard to come up with something new for them to do, but alienates the fans that put them there in the process. Such with Hellworld, Hellraiser's eighth (and last, until dreaded ""remake"" time) installment. Director Rick Bota back around 2003 was given the opportunity to make two new Hellraiser films back-to-back to add to the franchise and give Dimension Films something to add to their bad sequel catalog. Strangely though, both scripts he ended up with were never intended to be Hellraiser films in the first place, but stand-alone projects that only were altered to feature Pinhead and company in small, cameo-like roles. His first, Part 7:Deader seemed more Hellraiser-ish to other direct-to-video chapters like Part 5:Inferno & Part 6:Hellseeker. More based on one character's slow trip through madness, ending up in Pinhead's clutches towards the end. Not the case with Hellworld, for the first time all the rules are out the window, Pinhead's going for it in ways he's never done before...or really should have either.

In it, there is a popular on-line videogame called ""Hellworld"" based upon the Lament Configuration (y'know..the box?) and it's guardians The Cenobites, with Pinhead being it's ""Mario"" of the bunch. In this movie everybody knows the Hellraiser legacy, however I'm pretty sure that unlike say New Nightmare or Blair Witch 2, they don't know of any of the actual movies based on them...whew! When one of a group of friends kills himself over too much playing of the game, the five surviving friends go their separate ways until two years later when they reunite due to a special invitation to a Hellworld themed house party. Once there they're host, always welcomed and enjoyed Lance Henriksen, takes to the group and shows them around his private collection of Hellworld rarities and oddities. And then strange things start to happen to each of them, making them question what is real and what is not, as if they were playing the game right then and there...and with Pinhead stalking them the whole way.

That's right, ""stalking"" them. Pinhead's never been one to play Jason or Michael but he does so here. And even though his new techniques are somewhat explained by the film's end, you sort of wince when you see this once great character lose his originality. Gone are the chains/hooks of death replaced with knives and wooden stakes, and early on you question how did Doug Bradley let himself get stuck in a script like this. At least the visuals look nice, with a decent (yet cheap) amount of gore, nudity, and flash, but all the way feeling empty and foreign to the Hellraisers we've seen before. So by the credits roll, you feel the same way as you did when you probably saw Friday The 13th V:A New Beginning..hopefully that won't spoil it for you too much.

So to a Hellraiser fan, it's a must once see film, but you won't stop watching at least four other chapters for it. Sure, you do get to see Pinhead more in this film compared to three chapters before it, but sometimes ""less is more"" is a phrase that isn't used often enough.

Unfortunately, this film simply does not belong under the same title.  It is simply a low-budget generic horror flick which borrows the name HELLRAISER, but does not merit further comparison.  This film is a big disappointment on several levels.  Most notably, it has very little to do with the Hellraiser story, and even Pinhead has a small role, his limited presence relegated to an explanation too stupid and lame to indulge, though I won't spoil the plot for those still curious.  Secondly, the draw of the storyline was a website/web-based VR game called Hellworld, which draws in the players to their own doom.  I like the premise of a website or video game with supernatural overtones, and even will get a look at movies which turn out not to be so good.  Again, the premise of Hellworld will prove to be a considerable disappointment.

Like I said, this would have been a middling, unimpressive though tolerable film if it had just been of a nondescript generic origin.  Since it tries to milk the HELLRAISER franchise for audience, then it also has a standard it should and will be held to, and should be judged accordingly (2 stars instead of 3).  So instead of spoiling the movie, I will give my opinion in hopes of preventing your waste of time & money.

It is a shame that Lance Heinrickson is becoming the icon for movies that made one too many sequels (HELLRAISER, PUMPKINHEAD, PREDATOR, ALIEN).  It does not bode well that Kari Wuhrer, lovely though she is, is now the icon for movies whose sequels come to an inglorious end (PROPHECY), and who is starring in the latest/last HELLRAISER installment (HELLRASIER: DEADER).

There are really some scary moments which surprised me (because the series has been going downhill for a few years now). Pinhead shows up more than he has in the last few films but he quite doesn't make any type of point when he confronts anyone. He needs to be more complex with his words and needs to scare the crap out of the people he's about to seize. He needs to give the others something to really wrap their heads around. He really doesn't tell these people why he's killing them. And there's only a few bizarre torture devices. There needs to be more. The ending is the most disappointing. Pinhead should appear at the ending which he does for a minute or two and he should really be agitated and sum everything up with riddles and metaphors and really put people through hell but the end just kind of fizzles and you're left with really no overtones from Pinhead.

2244951,2,B0007US7E4,"I've seen so many god awful movies in my lifetime. I've seen plenty of films and thought why was this ever made? This movie fits directly into that category. Have you ever wondered what were they thinking when they wrote this? Who knows maybe I'm not alone when I say this but it just seems like the Hellraiser films go downhill with each new sequel. Although I did find the 6th film to be much better than the previous entry that came out before it. Hellraiser Hellword however is easily the worst in the series and quite possibly one of the worst horror films I've ever seen. I've waited maybe a year or two for this movie to come out and the long wait really had me anticipating it much more. Hellraiser Hellworld is about a group of friends who get invited to a bumping party filled with others who are connected to an online video game. More specifically it's a Hellraiser party thrown by the man who is the online game's biggest fan. Soon after the kids find themselves struggling to survive as they are slowly being killed off by Pinhead and the rest of the Cenobites.

Much different from all the previous films, Hellworld plays with the idea of the well known Hellraiser franchise. Much like the plot to Wes Cravens New Nightmare, all the characters in the film are well aware of Pinhead and the other legions from hell as if it were like a huge fan base (much like real life). Being a fan of the series I had a hard time trying to deal with the fact that everything seems to be well known. You'll see characters wearing Hellraiser t-shirts and playing an online video game based on the puzzle box. Like a lot of genre films today there isn't much interaction between the main characters where you would feel for them and want to survive. Luckily I didn't watch this film for the main characters anyway. The only characters I were interested in seeing were the well known Clive Barker created characters and the other character played by Lance Henriksen. Seeing Lance Henriksen in a Hellraiser film caught my attention from the very beginning. I've seen the actor in a bunch of movies and I really enjoy his work. The character he plays in the pictures seemed to really fit in well.

On the other hand, the rest of the film is just a mess. All the aspects from every previous film isn't present in this picture. I suppose it's their way of trying to do something different, but for me it just ruins the whole idea. Hellraiser Hellworld runs like a typical slasher film. Instead of having a huge mystery where the entire film is like one giant nightmare you have to fallow these braindead characters as they are being killed off one by one. It's almost nothing like the original concept and Hellworld just seemed to go the route of a slasher film. It does feature some decent acting and gory death scenes but it's just a total mess. Turning Hellraiser into an 80's style slasher film is like training a dog to write your homework, it just doesn't work. To top it all off the film the film features a plot twist which doesn't make any sense. By the time you figure our what's going on you're already in a loop as to why you're even watching the rest of the film.

Worst of all the way the film ends just wasn't sweet. The overall plot and twist near the end pretty much ruins everything, but the films ending just seemed to add more to the time that is wasted. I don't know too much about the making of the picture and I don't know what went on behind the scenes but I can see why this film was kept buried for so long as well with the 7th film. Hellraiser Hellworld for me is an insult to the series and to the fans who take the time to watch these pictures. It's great to see old characters again but placing them with this plot just didn't fit at all. Unless they can find some great way of bringing back life to this series then I don't see any reason why they should continue making them. Although making a new film isn't such a bad idea since the series itself ends on a bad note with this picture. Hellworld is not only the worst entry in the series but it was also a waste of time and money.",1146268800,3,4106,4.3507170795306385

Deader was a much worse film but got good reviews.  Maybe someone should pass me some of the crack their smoking but, Hellworld (aka not another teen movie) wasn't that bad.

Considering the box was Digitally opened (metaphorically) It can be conceivable that they did step into hellworld.  Also with a great set, wonderful effects and no errors seen evident it stands on it's own much better than Deader.  I didn't think Bota could make me love Hellraiser again.  Although I love this in the sense I loved inferno.  This is more a tale of the box circulating and taking random victims and forming it's own urban legends around the world.  Still very much a story about 7 deadly sins and the angels or demons, however you see them.  Pinhead didn't use cheap lines used in pervious sequals and it was tastefully ended with a good twist.  Even let the real demons come in and finish off the story the right way.

I can't understand hellraiser fans.  Maybe it's because the real fans stopped watching the films and gave up after part 3 and went to part 4 with hope but just gave up from there.  Maybe it's because people writing the reviews don't have much ""film"" knowlege to notice plot or continuity errors.

2244955,2,B0007US7E4,"Hellraiser: Hellworld (Rick Bota, 2005)

Hot on the heels of the seventh Hellraiser-franchise film comes Hellworld, the eighth. As with Deader, its predecessor, Hellworld actually has little to do with the mythos itself, and what it does have to do with it is presented in quite a clever way.

Four friends-- Chelsea (Two Weeks Notice's Katheryn Winnick), Derrick (Khary Payton, recently in Latter Days), Allison (gorgeous newcomer Anna Tolputt), and Mike (I Capture the Castle's Henry Cavill)-- are heavily involved in an online videogame called Hellworld, based on the Hellraiser mythology. They are acquainted with another pair of friends, Jake (Going the Distance's Christopher Jacot) and Adam. Adam, who allows the game to take over his life, ends up killing himself, and the movie opens at his funeral, where the four are excoriated by Jake, whom they never expect to see again. Two years later, Chelsea no longer plays the game, but the other three do, and all four are invited to a party well outside town celebrating the game. They go, and find their host (the indomitable Lance Henriksen) a rather interesting sort of fellow. Everything seems to be going great, until Jake shows up...

Once again, this is basically a Hellraiser film only in name; most of the connection has to do with the characters' involvement in the mythology, rather than the actual events of the flick. Unlike Deader, however, this is not a movie that could have stood on its own. It borrows too heavily from the mythology, and a number of other series films besides (A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors is especially in evidence). There's also an exceptionally annoying little plot point that I'm sure most of the movie's defenders are going to be able to explain away with spoilers: party guests are invited to choose their own cell phones, so how is it the caller ID always comes up with the right name? (No, the explanation you're considering giving me doesn't work. Think about it.)

All that said, Lance Henriksen is always a joy to watch, even in Z-grade horror films, and he pretty much makes this a watchable film. There are a few decent gore effects, but nothing spectacular. It's not bad-- certainly superior to Inferno or Hellseeker-- but it's not great, either. **",1142208000,,2268,4.9138381201044385

Granted, it is better than the one that proceeded it DEADER! But that's neither here or there now. I mean really, when Hellraiser was released Clive Barker had made me a fan for life. Pinhead is the ulitimate demon straight from HELL. However, they have destroyed the franchise and polluted the storyline. I should've known because it went straight to video, and that was clue number 1 that it would suck. We all know they make the movie sound so glamorous on the box, and when you take it home you see that it's trash. I guess I got what I expected from it, but it's still a disappointment.

2244960,2,B0007US7E4,"The Hellraiser series, now at entry #8, has suffered its shares of ups and downs, no one will deny that.  But at least the other entries had the undeniable stamp of the franchise on them.  Even #7""Hellraiser: Deader"", which gave minimal screen time to Pinhead and his Cenobites, had the classic Hellraiser feel, with an emphasis on pain, S&M and a dark, gothic feel.  In ""Hellraiser: Hellworld"", director Rick Bota throws all of this out the window and gives us something completely different.  He replaces the British setting with an American one.  Uses a teen cast instead of an adult one.  Makes it comedic and self-referential instead of gothic and mysterious.  The result is something that resembles a mediocre by-the-numbers slasher of the like that studios like Lion's Gate and Artisan Entertainment like to pump out with inhuman regularity.

The story revolves around a group of teens who receive invitations through a Hellraiser website to attend a ""Hellworld"" party.  They then find themselves in a huge mansion party with lots of debauchery Hellraiser style.  The party is hosted by the Lance Henriksen character.  Then one by one the gang start to die at the hands of Pinhead and the Cenobites at the urging of the host, who apparently has a hidden score to settle with each of the teens.

Very similar to the awful Halloween: Resurrection, we get a movie that likes to self-reference itself to death.  Bubbly teens wearing Pinhead t-shirts and Cenobite masks, cellphones, Hellraiser websites, the list of atrocities goes on.  Every time one of the teens made a mockery of  the Hellraiser mythos (such as The Box) it felt like a direct spit on the franchise.  Jesus wept!

Despite all of this it could have still been an okay film because it's obvious that all involved were trying VERY hard.  The actors (except for Henriksen) are intense, there's lots of action, lots of gore but for some reason the movie just doesn't work.  It's too self-referential for its own good and the characters are among some of the most bland I have ever witnessed.  The idea of Lance Henricksen in a Hellraiser movie should have been an exciting one, at least it would have been 15-20 years ago.  Now Lance just looks old, tired, bored, sore-throated and like he's desperately trying to milk his ""genre icon"" status to the last penny.

Anyone complaining that entry#7""Deader"" should have had more Pinhead in it needs to be careful what they ask for.  Yes, there's a lot more Pinhead, and a lot more gore this time around but despite that ""Hellworld"" is easily the worst Hellraiser film so far.  In fact, I'm convinced it has put the nail in the coffin of a franchise that so many horror fans cared deeply about.  And for that Mr. Rick Bota may myself, all other Hellraiser fans and Clive Barker cast your film to the lowest depths of Hades!",1134345600,,2833,4.767967145790554
2244961,3,B0007US7E4,"This is a tough one.  Hellraiser: Hellworld is a Hellraiser movie, but it's not really a Hellraiser movie, except that it sort of is.  You know something's just not right when Pinhead shows up and just lops off a dude's head without uttering a single one of his gleefully evil aphorisms, not even a quick ""Time to play.""  The Cenobites are all about the sweet pleasure of pain, the beautiful anguish of suffering, the exquisite knowledge that comes with the most intimate exploration of the flesh - but Hellraiser: Hellworld is about death - pure and simple death.  And let's face it - there's just no fun in that.  Basically, this is a slasher film - until the end, when the filmmakers sort of make a mess of things by redefining the nature of everything we have just seen.  It doesn't really work, and - despite a last-minute palliative - sort of leaves a bad taste in the mouth of us Cenobite fanatics.  Clearly, the Hellraiser series has lost its focus.

It's not exactly original, but I like the basic storyline.  Imagine that there is an addictive, online game called Hellworld, and it's based on the Cenobites we know and love, the puzzle box, etc.  A group of friends - who lost one of their other friends two years ago when his obsession with the game consumed him - can't resist the temptation when they win a ticket to a private Hellworld party.  Their host is a wonderfully creepy fellow played by Lance Henriksen, who adds a much-needed sense of menace to events as they unfold.  After a gnarly tour of the place, the friends wander off to themselves and explore the big Leviathan House - and you know what happens to horror film characters who wander off on their own.  The deaths aren't all that satisfying, though, as that's all they are - deaths, messy but much too quick.  Eventually, we're left with two characters (one of whom, fortunately, is the film's designated hot chick) who try to figure out what exactly is going on and just try to survive.  Then comes the ending, when everything is thrown on its ear, some justification for Pinhead's odd behavior is offered, and a final attempt to appease Hellraiser fans falls a little flat.

You don't need to have seen all of the sequels to understand what is going on here - as long as you have a basic understanding of the Cenobites, you're good to go.  As a slasher film, Hellraiser: Hellworld isn't all that bad and does feature a decent amount of blood and gore.  As a Hellraiser film, though, this is just a real oddity.  It doesn't exactly hurt the series all that much, but it certainly does nothing to enhance and build upon the Hellraiser legacy.",1133740800,19,2623,4.566239316239316

If you have seen the previous film Deader, and like me, you found it very entertaining, then you probably had high hopes for this film also.

Hellworld stars the fantastic Doug Bradley and Lance Henriksen, which are the only two big names in this movie. Rick Bota, who directed the last two or three Hellraiser movies also directs Hellworld. After the fourth Hellraiser film, the movies took a different direction. Each film shows less and less of Pinhead and the cynabites, and each film is either turned into a mystery or a puzzle. This has surely disappointed a lot of Hellraiser fans that want to see more screen time for Pinhead and the cynabites. The last three films have all been put together so well with such good ideas and stories that even with Pinhead and cynabites having limited time on screen the movies still have been very impressive.

After the last four films, Hellworld turns out to be the worse. In this movie Pinhead gets the least amount of time on screen and is shoved into the movie at very odd times that don't help the film at all. Hellworld gets worse as the story goes on and by the end of the movie you are just left with an ending that is half decent at best.

2244971,2,B0007US7E4,"First off, this is another ""psychological"" horrror film; that means it is confusing like a drug trip. The movie ends like a bad trip too. Lance Henrickson is in this film, which is the reason why even bothered to watch it. Boy, was that a mistake.

  The Eighth(!!) in the Hellraiser series, Hellworld tells the tale of a bunch of teenagers who decide to go to a party in the middle of nowhere because of an on-line invitation (this is where the ""horror goes on-line"" blurb comes from). One by one, they meet a Pinhead-sponsered end. This movie has some good Hellraiser-esque touches but there is no substance to Hellworld.

 Why don't the producers of these films simply give us Hellraiser-philes what we really want: A story where Subject A gets the box, he/she opens it, the mayhem ensues and Pinhead and his buddies ARE IN THE ENTIRE FILM FROM START TO FINISH.

 To me, the 4th installment of this frachise was the last, true Hellraiser movie.

Before you can say ""acupuncture"", the film takes off, trying to stay faithful to it's source but in the process, completely ignores much of the logic the series relied upon when it was first conceived to film.  Rick Bota is once again in the director's seat, and his direction is uninspired, the plot laughable, and by the time Pinhead (Doug Bradley) shows up, it's apparent that Hellraiser: Hellworld finds the series diminished to the point of being a teen slasher.  Pinhead hasn't been scary in quite some time, and here, he's just laughable.  Like Hellraiser: Deader, Hellword is beyond bad, and even Henriksen's great performance can't save the film.",1127260800,,901,5.0675675675675675
2244973,4,B0007US7E4,"I actually thought this one was ""ok"" They had a very low budget and seemed to use it fairly well. The movie was actually adapted from a story that originally had nothing to do with the hellraiser series or pinhead. They basically thought it would be a good idea to throw pinhead into an existing story about hell. I thought it was an above average horror movie, but at the same time, not really a hellraiser movie.  As others have mentioned, it played out more like a teen slasher flick. Maybe I'm just a sucker for revenge plots and slasher flicks, because I really liked the story in this one. I think the story was strong enough to stand up all by itself without rehashing a hellraiser movie. The story is one of the reasons I gave it 4 stars. The other reason I gave it a high rating is THIS IS THE MOST YOU WILL GET TO SEE PINEHAD OUT OF THE LAST 4 HELLRAISER MOVIES MADE!!! Its so sad this series has strayed so far away from its roots. To this day, the first 2 Hellraiser movies are 2 of my favorite horror movies, it's a shame what they are doing to this series. BRING BACK MOVIES WITH PINHEAD IN THEM!!

2244974,4,B0007US7E4,"First off i'd like to say im a huge fan of the hellraiser series. I enjoyed hellworld for 2 reasons. One its very different, much better than the last 3. Better acting, great story. The second reason pinhead's time is divided up better in this movie, more spread out. Lance Henriksen's role (as the host) was a nice touch. His presence carried the film. Hats off to Rick Bota.

These people who write these reviews. I have 2 things to say to u. 1-this is a low budget movie. what do u want? Its alot better than most horror movies out there. Sure Id like to see more pinhead. But if u think about it Pinheads only in the first hellraiser for 10 minutes if that. 2-Did any of u watch the movie? The movie has a good plot,good gore,nudity and decent acting. All elements needed for a good horror film. A must see for all hellrasier fans. Even if u know nothing of the series, watch this movie.",1127088000,3,891,4.272189349112426
2244975,2,B0007US7E4,"After Bloodlines it really makes me wonder why they keep on making bad sequels to Hellraiser. Ok-so what-(yawn)a bunch of spoiled brats go to a party (for sex and booze) and end up getting murdered. How many times have we seen this before? So much for originality. These young actors actually got on my nerves-not good acting in my opinion, and it makes me wonder how each of them got the part. The wacko host of the party also got on my nerves. To me it seemed like he was more reading script off of cue-cards than acting. I was thinking you gotta be kidding. How did he get the job? Probably to save money? The party was a kind of cheap imitation of the ""Boiler Room"" of a previous hellraiser. And let me emphasize cheap imitation.

Well, I guess it suits a bad script with an even more disappointing ending. (I *really* felt cheated with the ending. They could have put more thought into it.). Throughout the movie, they were even more conservative with the gore (to save money??)--not one time did I ever flench. Not one scene at all.

And something about the cellphones. That was a major thing in the movie...and major stupid too. Those cell phones got on my nerves big time. Very very irritating.

If you are a Hellraiser fan of the original movies, you keep on hoping to see something decent; only to be disappointed again and again. I guess it's okay to rent it--I seen worst horror movies, but I do not think it's worth any more than four dollars. I definitely would not like to see it twice.",1126915200,,1501,4.431159420289855
2244976,5,B0007US7E4,"With the advent of the internet and new technologies all forms of entertainment have been going through a series of upheavals. Some are for the better, others are for the worse. So, The movie industry is no exception. For studios, producers and investors it's been riskier and riskier to try and produce blockbusters or release theatrical movies due to several factors, ranging from lack of resources to instability in economy and politics - even widespread piracy is the one to blame .So studios have been  producing  low-budget movies instead of expensive movies. Computers in part are the ones to blame too. CGI can practically generate any kind of (impressive or risible) image, so the magic or artistry of mechanical effects seems to be getting lost in the process. It's cheaper to hire unknown actors than famous ones. Filming schedules are getting shorter and shorter, as well as budgets and resources. A real horror fan knows that at least 80% of all horror movies made in this world are low-budget or homemade. Very few horror flicks are made with a lot of dough. Since the very beginning the HELLRAISER saga has followed this pattern, little money is spent but there's a lot of style. Once the effects were mechanical , photographic or  just physical - now they're mostly CGI, but still well made considering all sorts of restraints these brave movie makers face. Today movie watchers really don't know what they want to see. Do they want matter over substance or substance over matter or both? Lots of those so-called horror fans simply don't pay attention to what they watch - just check any forum sites and you'll see what I mean. When they pay attention to everything all they care about is spotting the mistakes and flaws seldom what makes the movie good. All we hear is this painful whine : ""the worst movie ever"" or ""it sucks big time!"". Hellraiser 1 & 2 are among the best and goriest horror movies ever produced, still lots of those horror movie ""lovers"" tear these original classic films to pieces. Others wanted to see more of PINHEAD. Hellraiser 3& 4 were made to show us more PINHEAD in action. The same people who demanded more PINHEAD screening time are the same who pan these movies. Even Clive Barker was crucified - he conceived the BOILER ROOM MASSACRE seen in HR3, for example, just to please his fans.  Because of all factors I mentioned above the studio and the producers decided to take a different path, and still are being criticized by those who now want to see more CENOBITES and PINHEAD in action. Humans are so difficult to please! That's why I love animals and hate people !Why don't you whiny fellows  invest whopping sums of money in the next HELLRAISER films or write good quality scripts or even try to direct the next instalments? If you never enjoyed HELLRAISER why bother watching the old and new episodes?

I liked this movie as well as the other instalments . A good horror film is the one that holds your attention,that has flaws, that has good effects and interesting characters. And in my opinion this one has got it. About the teen characters : they have a reason to be there - mostly teens watch horror movies ! Only a handful adults watch horror flicks - I'm almost 40 (!). Teens are most times boring,reckless,and unstable people when they want to be and this movie show us that. I am so happy I have all HELLRAISER instalments on DVD / VHS and all the action figures too. I am not going to spoil anything by making remarks about what happens throughout the movie. It's up to you to watch and assess it. I did and I enjoyed it 100% !!! If you don't... I don't really care!",1126656000,3,3628,4.625776397515528
2244977,2,B0007US7E4,"As a diehard Hellraiser fan, I must admit that I was excited about this film. I rented it last night and found the acting to be laughable, the plot slightly intriguing at best, and the ending ... oh Dear God almighty that awful ending! I liked the fact that Pinhead was used sparingly, making his appearances that much better. His dialogue sucked in this film as opposed to some of his more poetic versus in other installments, but I liked watching him stick to basics and kill characters slasher style. I found myself enjoying this film, and I must also admit that I did like the Lance - Pinhead showdown at the end. But that payoff with Lance and the girl? **Spoiler alert** The burial alive with Nokia cell phones (blatant pathetic product placement all around) inside the coffins? Have screenplay writers become so claimed by the film industry's creative drought that they are reduced to this crap? All in all, this is a film that is worth RENTAL ONLY from diehard Hellraiser fans. Anyone who goes to best buy and drops $23 on this should probably be buried alive themselves.",1126656000,,1079,4.654450261780105
2244978,2,B0007US7E4,"I was actually looking forward to this movie for several months now, so I must say that I was pretty disappointed. The whole ""deadly website"" thing is a great premise, but I have yet to see anyone who actually does it right. I had hoped that they would do so in Hellworld, but that wasn't really the plot of the movie anyway.

I like how all the HellRaiser movies are different from one another, unlike a lot of other horror franchises. I know how important some people think having a sequel is, but I'm sorry, but if you're just going to repeat the formula the same way with different faces just to have a sequel, I don't see the point. HellRaiser doesn't do this, and for that I am grateful. They try different things with Pinhell and the Lament Configuration, some of which works better than others. Unfortunately, HellRaiser doesn't really work well as a teen slasher movie. I'm not really too much of a fan of teen slasher movies anyway, so I guess that probably worked against Hellworld. But in a lot of ways I guess it did fit well as a teen slasher movies as it had generic characters that you realy don't care about and bad acting.

On the positive side, there is some sense of continuity as they do remain true to the HellRaiser mythology. Unfortunately (and this REALLY turned me off to the movie), much of it was looked upon as little more than an old wives tale, just a game and nothing more; a bunch of BS. It seemed more like a shallow teenage fad than anything else, and I didn't like having to see Pinhead like that, and it certainly would not be how I would want to remember the franchise years down the line.

Inferno, HellSeeker, and Deader had gotten a lot of heat by some of the HellRaiser fants, but I actually enjoyed those movies, and I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed with this one. The fact that the picture quality wasn't all that great probably didn't help matters either, I suppose. I was also sad to see that Pinhead never gave any of his speeches regarding the beauty of suffering either.",1126483200,,2027,4.428954423592494

I can't believe the money that is wasted producing horrible movies these days. Hellraiser 8 only solidifies my opinion that the entertainment industry has gone to Hell. Freddy Vs. Jason, Alien Vs.

2244982,3,B0007US7E4,"I posted a review for Deader after viewing it for the first time and had to say I really enjoyed it.  I thought it was put together pretty good.  With that in mind, I went into Hellworld with the same attitude I had towards Deader.

I gave it three stars due to the fact that the Cenobites (there are only Pinhead, Chatterer, and Bound included in this one) have a little more screentime and do more than just stand in one place.  The ending with Chatterer and Bound literally dropped my jaw!

I know a lot of people didn't like Hellraiser 3: Hell on Earth because of the fact that Pinhead was a more prominent character, but in this one their screentime was necessary to keep the story alive.  Aside from that, the story is ok...a little twisted which is good.  The acting and script kinda made the movie a little tiring for me.

I look at this way. This series has 7 sequels, it has stayed alive for this long, and at least we get to see some decent kills at the hands of Pinhead. I do hope that the next sequel will return to the original hellraiser formula. As For Hellworld it wasn't terrible but it wasn't great. That's my review.",1126137600,,635,4.530434782608696

We get Hellworld.  HELLRAISER IS NOT A TEENAGE SLASHER SERIES!!  The story is complete crap and the characters are completely forgettable.  This movie is a total disgrace to Clive Barker's original vision which was Hellraiser.  The series needs a writer and director who understands the Hellraiser world as it was portrayed in the first two films.

The characters are so horrible you cant wait to see them die (I mean there's a token black guy for Christ's sake), and their deaths are not satisfying enough considering the awful proformances they put you through.

8051937,1,B0007US7E4,"I enjoyed parts I-VII only to utterly despise this sequel.  Very bad, both as a Hellraiser sequel and as a random horror flick.  Just bad.

Directed by Rick Bota (Haven, Hellraiser VI-VIII), this eighth installment to the Hellraiser franchise follows Inferno (2000), Hellseeker (2002) and Deader (2005) by presenting another stand-alone story.  But unlike Botas other sequels (VI and VII), I can comfortably say this is the only Hellraiser film I was completely unable to enjoyalthough I haven't seen part IX yet.

This direct-to-video movie feels like just that, with lousy acting, deplorable special effects and a script that doesnt even try.  In fact, the only thing this flick delivers effectively is nudity.  Honestly, Im a bit confused.  How and why were Botas other Hellraiser sequels so superior to this?

In this uninspired franchise installment, Hellworld is a popular interactive videogame and such notions as Cenobites and opening the Puzzle Box are common objectives of the game.  A group of savvy gamers (including Katheryn Winnick; The Dark Tower, Vikings and Henry Cavill; The Immortals, Red Riding Hood, Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice) find themselves invited by a mysterious host (Lance Henriksen; Pumpkinhead, Harbinger Down,The Pit and the Pendulum) to the Leviathan House for a Hellworld-themed carnal sex party.

To say this sequel was phoned in would be polite.  Nothing about this felt like a Hellraiser movie.  Pinhead (Doug Bradley; Hellraiser I-VII) was just forced into the script, the Boxs mythology isn't developed, the Cenobites didn't matter at all, and the kills could have been from any stupid Saw knock-off.  We didn't even get the hooked chains!  And when someone did get killed the effects were awful (maybe basic would be a more fair term here).  Even the depictions of the game were aggravatingly lazy.

Despite all the dialogue about the game, it never really felt important.  Nothing did.  This film serves as an example of the complete and utter failure to contemporize a long-running horror series.  I wonder if this films quality had to do with it being filmed almost immediately after part VII.  Sigh

This film is bad, both as a Hellraiser story and as a DTV horror flick.  I wouldnt even recommend it for Hellraiser film completists.  Theres no reason to watch this except for self-abuse.",1504915200,,2340,5.113456464379947
