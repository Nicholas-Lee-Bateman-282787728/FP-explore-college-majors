8426237,5,B004DXXAA2,"Hysterical and intelligent humor the way only the Brits can do.  We bought the DVDs, along with the multi-region DVD player, because we didn't want to be without this series when it cycles off the Netflix/Hulu platforms.  We did the same with the Miranda series.  It's a shame we don't have humor like this in the US.",1494115200,,317,4.526315789473684
8426238,5,B004DXXAA2,"I have struggled to find this show online since Netflix dropped it, but have to resort to discs etc.  One of the funniest sketch shows in recent years.  It's British in its execution, but even folks who don't typically go for that should enjoy this edgy show.  My personal favorite is the evil genius's henchman who gets tired of all the needlessly ambiguous innuendo... ""'Have him removed'? 'Take him out of the picture'? I thought we agreed that these terms were needlessly ambiguous? We all agreed that when we want someone murdered, as in deliberately killed to death, that's what we were going to say!"".  Not to mention the inappropriate sports announcers, caveman CSI, or the question of where all the people who actually bought avocado colored bathroom fixtures went.  Innovative and tightly edited, it's a good watch.",1490140800,,825,4.949275362318841
8426239,3,B004DXXAA2,"3* because i love this series, BUT THIS IS NOT A BOX SET, IT IS THE FOUR SEPERATE SERIES DVDS GLUED TOGETHER. A RIP OFF FOR THE PRICE PAID FROM AUSTRAILIACONSOLES, ORDER THEM FROM AMAZON UK!!!!",1455062400,,193,4.388888888888889

8426241,5,B004DXXAA2,"If you only catch one Mitchell & Webb sketch in your life, make sure it's the one where MI-6 is discussing the fool-proof way they murdered Princess Di on the orders of the royal family at whose ""beck and call they are always at"". They surgically debunk the conspiracy theories in a way that will leave you laughing and embarrassed if you ever gave one a serious moment's thought.",1411344000,,380,4.521739130434782

8426243,5,B004DXXAA2,"Back when I had Netflix, they had this on instant stream... for awhile.  But then, away it went, and unfortunately, it doesn't appear to be available on Region 1 DVD.

This show is hilarious.  I agree that it has hints of Python-esque humour but with a totally modern bent.  At moments it is little more than barely controlled chaos- and those are the best moments!  I haven't had a show make me laugh so consistently in a long, long time.  Possibly the best sketch comedy I've ever seen.",1388880000,12,488,4.488636363636363
8426244,5,B004DXXAA2,Absolutely top notch British sketch comedy. Reminiscent of Monty Python with modern day attitude excluding of course David's characteristic posh sensibilities.,1375056000,4,159,6.619047619047619
8426245,5,B004DXXAA2,"I'm a big sketch comedy fan, but I'm also very picky.  These guys are great.  Almost every skit is a hit.  They find humor in so many places you wouldn't think of.  I like the show so much I bought a PAL DVD because that's all that was available, even though I'm in the USA.",1353196800,5,274,3.9272727272727272
8426246,4,B004DXXAA2,"Sketch comedy is a fraught design-- it relies, by necessity, entirely on the indulgence of its audience to appreciate the merit of a single gag, then the next, repeatedly, in quick succession and with minimal context, and if those gags don't play out to the audience's expectations (and taste) each skit, and thus the whole show, is a washout.  That given, the talented Messrs. Mitchell and Webb (of 'Peep Show' fame) do an excellent job of carrying on the burdensome tradition here by combining the silly and the cerebral, the mannered and the vulgar, the accessible and the abstract, with just the right touch of ageless wit, nods to pop culture and edgier fourth-wall-busting self-awareness (they regularly perform 'unscripted' bits between sketches, including one based on the hit-and-miss nature of their chosen format), the result of which is an occasionally hiliarious and generally very entertaining series that may not be quite Pythonesque in historical scope but puts most of the last 30 years of SNL to shame.  3 1/2 stars.",1330732800,10,1034,5.076470588235294
