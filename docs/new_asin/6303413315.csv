7845850,5,6303413315,"Don't let the title fool you, this video is not 2 hours of droning poetry.  It contains some of the finest music I have ever heard and watched.  Michael Martin Murphey and the Sons of the San Joaquin do an incredible two versions of ""Mi Corazon"" that leaves you in tears.  And anyone who has either sold or lost their farm or watched the years force many of your neighbors to move to town will also weep at ""The Ones the Wolves Pulled Down"".
And see and hear the late Buck Ramsey, author of one of the greatest poems ever written - ""Anthem"", sing and recite.  (Yes, I said greatest poems not greatest cowboy poems - a short version is recited here, but read the full poem and see if you agree.)  Enjoy comedy with Waddie Mitchell reciting poetry on buying his wife a bra or Paul Zarzyski on ""Rocky Mountain Oysters"".
My favorite has to be Don Edwards (seen in movie ""Horse Whisperer"") singing ""Coyotes"".  Ian Tyson fans will get a treat also.  And anyone who has ever loved a horse will love ""The Pearl of Them All"".
Even family members and friends who don't like Cowboy and Western poetry and songs have enjoyed watching this video.  (And yes there is a HUGE difference between western and ""country"" music and this is NOT country music.)",1006473600,7,1238,4.446902654867257
