Here is the boring and depressing stuff that happened the year you were born!""  Not what I expected.  Will not buy for any other birthdays for friends or family.",1507420800,,433,4.5
8669920,3,B00M2X09AE,"I was a little disappointed about the subjects of the CD, I was expecting a little more positive and upbeat facts,  it was a little depressing for a birthday gift.
It was informative and interesting, just would have liked to see some more upbeat facts",1462838400,,251,4.5777777777777775
