8276127,5,6305125775,"My partner and I really enjoyed this movie. A young Japanese man heads to Alberta to meet his childhood penpal and to fulfill his dream of becoming a cowboy. Never mind that he and his penpal have not corresponded in quite  some time and he has no idea she is a lesbian! His newness to the English  language, his friend's fear of being ""outed"" and her mother's  trying to set them up make for some comedy. Full of gentle Canadian humour,  eh.",930528000,8,442,4.353658536585366
