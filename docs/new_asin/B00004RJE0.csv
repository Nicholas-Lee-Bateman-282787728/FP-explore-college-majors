7921392,4,B00004RJE0,"I've been a fan for Lee Evans for a while and his Live in Scotland DVD is one of his best, not the best just one of.  Not too long and not too short, Lee Evans punches out hilarious jokes and sketches with perfect timing and comedic ease.  Lee Evans delivers tear jerking laughter while using everyday occurences and impersonations of unknown common people as his subject matter.  This DVD is a perfect example of what kind of comedian Evans is.  Using physical comedy mixed with voice acting and clever stories, Lee's performance will but a smile on anyones face.

A highly recommended comedy DVD from one of Britains most successful and treasured comedians.",1150934400,,659,4.745614035087719
