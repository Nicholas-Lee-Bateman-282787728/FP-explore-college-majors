8554907,4,B000A37H3U,"Flix Leclerc, directed by Claude Fournier in 2005 for the Canadian Television is a 4-part mini-series tracing the life of one of Qubec's greatest sons. Christian Larsen wrote: 'Flix Leclerc is to the Canadian chanson what Trenet was to the French chanson: a revolutionary, a turning point, and a leader.'

The film will be of interest to people who are interested in the following subjects:
1. Flix Leclerc (1914-1988), the great French-Canadian songwriter/singer (the subject of the film)
2. Daniel Lavoie, the great French-Canadian songwriter/singer (who plays the title character)
3. The history of Qubec in the mid-20th century
4. The history of a francophone chanson in the mid-20th century

The film traces the life of Flix Leclerc, who was discovered in his 30-s by a French impresario Jacques Canetti (Marc Berman), and went on to make a great impact on the history of the chanson both in France and in his native Qubec. The director presents Flix's singing career (leaving his literary and theater work mostly aside) against the background of the Qubec's liberation movement which was an important part of Flix's life. The film also follows Flix's complicated early family life and his late romance and marriage to Gatane Morin (Catherine Snart).

The acting in Flix Leclerc is top quality and despite a somewhat quirky script the film is quite entertaining. One of the film's strengths is the participation of the incomparable Daniel Lavoie who recorded 30 of Leclerc's songs for this film. Qubec's beautiful landscapes (especially that of its le d'Orlans beloved by Flix) are another attraction. In fact, these landscapes could be counted as another character of this poetic and inspired film.

The product is packaged very well. The only problem that I would like to mention is the lack of English subtitles, which makes the film less available for non-francophone audience.",1283558400,2,1886,5.15359477124183
