8655378,1,B00K2OBUR6,I couldn't  make heads or tails  of this very poorly written script . It just made absolutely  no sense at all . The acting was sorry cast awful  . Im still confused as to who is Janet Taylor ? Is she real ? or a story to raise awareness about the slave trade of young abducted women .I got lost along the way in the poor script and acting .,1410912000,,341,3.8285714285714287

The great reviews are fakes. Don't believe them. Waste of time and money.",1410134400,3,82,4.857142857142857
8655380,1,B00K2OBUR6,"I'm in disbelief at the shotty production and performances that is Border Break.  All involved should find a new line of work, clearly you've made a wrong turn down the highway of life.

This movie was utterly painful to watch and even harder to hear.  Actors should be able to articulate and deliver their lines so that the viewer can understand what is being said, they missed the mark dreadfully.

I rented this film based in large part on the IMBd rating which must be a typo or a kick back between those that own this junk & the publication reviewer because this is just, dare I say, garbage.  Shame on you IMBd, the publication should be forced to watch this crap again as punishment for the high rating which misled me into renting this atrociousness.  The 5-star reviews:  One reviewer has the same last name as a supporting actor the other has reviewed only one film - BB.

Fair warning friends - avoid at all costs. Less than zero.",1409961600,,941,4.4941176470588236

A real eye opener for a collage and high school students",1401321600,2,108,4.190476190476191
8655382,5,B00K2OBUR6,I saw this film at a festival and it had everyone on the edge of their seats.  It blurs the line between what is real and not real in such a good way that I still don't know if this girl that is kidnapped in the film is a real person.  The director gets great performances out of her actors and her shooting style keeps the pace up the entire film.  Film also tackles the subject of sex trafficking which I see in the news everyday so hopefully this film brings some visibility to that issue.,1401321600,2,492,4.104166666666667
