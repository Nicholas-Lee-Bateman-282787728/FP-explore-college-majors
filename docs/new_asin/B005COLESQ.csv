4653738,5,B005COLESQ,Great price and fast service. My son borrowed them and is enjoying them so much he has yet to return them. I can not wait to see them for myself.,1337212800,2,145,3.8666666666666667

4653740,5,B005COLESQ,"Lost Boys has long been a favorite of mine. It's fun all the way! A tightly wrapped plot, combined with an excellent soundtrack, make this a classic in it's genre. Cry, Little Sister is haunting and is the perfect pick for the theme song.",1420329600,,238,4.431818181818182

4653744,3,B005COLESQ,"I always liked the first movie, the second one was boring and the third one was better than the second one and at least held my interest. What I didn't like was the packaging. In this trio the DVD's are on top of each other to add to possible scratching issues since they don't have their own compartment. I felt the company cheaped out or was looking for future sales as you needed to replace the DVD's sooner due to their packaging",1410912000,,433,4.2926829268292686
4653745,5,B005COLESQ,Only every seen the first one but the price for all three was to good to pass up. Still haven't watched them to scared of what they may have done but the first one is awesome!,1410652800,,175,3.888888888888889

4653750,4,B005COLESQ,"I like all vampire good movies and I had seen the Lost Boys, but not the other 2.  The quality was great",1393459200,,104,3.727272727272727
4653751,5,B005COLESQ,"Came in safely and on time, if not sooner. but yes I love this movie set, it was a great buy and had all 3 movies in it not damaged at all, I watch it every day and it was worth the price of buying it.",1386547200,3,201,3.391304347826087
4653752,5,B005COLESQ,"Love vampires? Love the good old days where stakes and crosses actually worked on them in movies? All the old time 'lore' works here and none of them sparkle. (Although there are good points to the more modern vampire movies). If your looking for some kicking vampire action, these movies are for you.",1375488000,,301,4.69811320754717
4653753,5,B005COLESQ,"All three in one place makes this a DVD to have in your home!
though the first was the best its good to have all three!",1371859200,,119,3.6153846153846154
4653754,4,B005COLESQ,"Sutherland really is a fine actor.  There's nothing dated about his performances.  He has a terrific instinct with his acting.  I was surprised to see the late Jason Miller's son, Jason Patric (Jackie Gleason's grandson!) in it, as well!!  Handsome guy & a good actor.  His sensitivity in the role is reminiscent of his father's acting, but without all of the torment etched into his face.  The man should write a book!!!  What a family tree!!

Anyway the first film is great, if you're not terrified by the HAIRstyles!!!  The other two...you'd be better off just buying the first by itself, unless you're a diehard fan of this genre.",1367107200,3,634,4.743119266055046
4653755,5,B005COLESQ,"I won't say much because other reviewers have covered everything. These are 3 great and scary movies I love having them all in one disc case, the actors Corey Feldman and others are freakin awesome, excellent plot, and lots of scary vampireness muwhahaha. Sound color, picture and clarity are great",1366070400,,298,4.98
4653756,5,B005COLESQ,"Awesome set of movies, starting off with the original Lost Boys from 1987 which was pretty good for back then. Lost Boys The Tribe is the second one 20 years later, the only few original cast are in this movie, but you viewers would have to find out. And lastly the Lost Boys the Thirst is the 3rd and final one. You have to see how it turns out.",1364601600,,346,4.028985507246377
4653757,5,B005COLESQ,"Quality script declines as second and third movies progress, but the first is vampire movie perfection.  Worth the cost for just this film alone.",1360281600,,145,5.041666666666667
4653758,4,B005COLESQ,"I know except for the first movie the others are cheesie, but this is not a movie review, it's a product review. It shipped ontime, the price was great, and they arrived with out any scratches. What I was not happy with is that it did ship wit out the protective plastic and that got me worried about damage.",1357257600,,308,4.237288135593221

8465737,4,B005COLESQ,"Lost Boys and The Thirst are both great films, but The Tribe is a terrible movie.  The package sold as a 3-pack is a deal, so I was satisfied with the purchase.",1491004800,,160,4.0
