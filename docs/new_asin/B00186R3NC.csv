8268545,5,B00186R3NC,I really enjoy being able to watch and hear how to do something more than reading it.  Just seeing it is so much better for me. It was instructional without being mechanical and didn't add anything that was redundant or remotely resembling fluff.,1371254400,2,246,4.72093023255814
8268546,5,B00186R3NC,"Steve's set of books and the two DVD's that go along with his Reiki Master program are invaluable for the Reiki Practitioner. The Reiki Master Attunement DVD gave me a true attunement, enhancing my healing abilities. Steve's books, Reiki the Ultimate Guide, Ultimate Guide Vol 2, Ultimate Guide Vol 3, Ultimate Guide Vol 4, and Reiki Beliefs Exposed For All are fabulous and filled with a wealth of information. His DVD, A Reiki 1st, Aura and Chakra Attunement Preformed, is an excellent companion to the books demonstrating the actual processes of performing attunements. I will use this set again and again as reference along my path of Reiki healing.",1258329600,2,653,5.0
8268547,5,B00186R3NC,"Building upon his previous dvd How to Contact Spirits Vol. 1. Steve Murray does an outstanding job of precision direction and understanding to seances and spirit boards. Demonstrating in person, the appropriate steps and stages in each example. Understanding what is involved, what to be aware of, and how to end each session. I don't believe there is a more concise dvd available on this matter.",1254268800,2,396,5.015151515151516
8268548,5,B00186R3NC,"This is a must have informational dvd on spirit contact and using the Ouija board.  Picture and sound quality are excellent.  Directions are very clear, concise, and easy to understand.  I highly recommend this dvd and will be recommending it with all of my ouija boards I make on my home site.  Thanks for providing a quality dvd, it is very refreshing.

8268549,5,B00186R3NC,This is a well produced DVD and a great sequel to the volume one by Steve Murray. I personally liked learning how to use the Spirit Board.,1218758400,2,138,4.148148148148148
8268550,5,B00186R3NC,This is second of two of Steve's new DVDs and like all his programs very good. I would recommend to all who have an interest in contacting spirits and their spirit guides.,1218067200,2,171,4.375
8268551,5,B00186R3NC,I felt that this was the clearest instructions for using the Ouija board that I had ever seen. It answered my questions about how to safely contact those I love who are not physically present any longer. This was done in a straight forward manner without a lot of fear tactics or phoney dialogue. I appreciate the direct answers and methods used and thank Steve for his approach to a difficult subject. Great teaching as I have come to expect from this Gentle Man,1217376000,2,463,4.523809523809524
