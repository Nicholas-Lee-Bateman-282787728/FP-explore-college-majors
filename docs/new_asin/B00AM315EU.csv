8553495,4,B00AM315EU,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrera (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like Ring Of Honor, DragonGate, Evolve, and Championship Wrestling From Hollywood.

The PWG Championship was defended in a triple threat match with Champion Kevin Steen vs. Michael Elgin vs. Ricochet which saw three different styles clash throughout the match with Ricochet's speed, Elgin's power, and Steen's unique styles of brawling that saw various interactions between all three men with Elgin doing a double samoan drop, Steen's package piledriver one guy onto the other, and Ricochet's shooting star press onto one guy on the outside followed by another in the ring.  Davey Richards went against Sami Callihan in a match that started with a brawl in the crowd within the first minute before evolving into a heavily submission based matched that saw everything including anklelocks, trailer hitch, indian deathlock, unique variations of the crucifix & cloverleaf, figure four, sharpshooter, and stretch muffler.  Other matches include the return of Kenny Omega teaming with El Generico vs. Young Bucks in a highly competitive match that went ""Over The Top"" at one point, Michael Elgin working double duty against Eddie Edwards that saw both men showcasing athletic ability, Famous B & B-Boy vs. RockNES Monsters that saw a new side of the Monsters working a heel style, Willie Mack vs. Brian Cage in a Grudge Match, Joey Ryan vs. Ryan Taylor, and the impressive debut of Rick Swann vs. Roderick Strong.

You can't go wrong with a P.W.G. event & this was no different as very match was strong wrestling that had a taste for everyone so check this event out.",1365379200,,1817,5.128378378378378
8553496,5,B00AM315EU,Well worth the $15 especially when compared to the chaff the WWE releases for $50. My favorite matches were the Calihan vs Richards bout and of course Willie Mack vs Brian Cage. The title match was a little disappointing but not bad however the tag team match made up for it.,1356739200,,275,4.411764705882353
