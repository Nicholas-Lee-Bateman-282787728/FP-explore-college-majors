4995182,4,B006JPD30E,"I love this movie, there is something about Korean horror that resonates with me. The things that are supposed to frighten us seem scarier in Asian films than they are in US films. This is the usual 'science gone wrong' plot' but in a location I haven't seen before. The characters are a bit 2-dimensional but still likeable. I didn't get as emotionally invested as I might have liked, but the movie is more about scares than anything else. The movie has a lot of action and a few great moments, and a few silly ones. Just one thing the epilog is lousy, there is no reason for it being there. As I said, scary with a lot (but not tons) of action. If you are not afraid to read subtitles watch this movie",1417392000,,703,4.253731343283582

A really annoying film with some SUPER annoying characters and one just totally over-the-top ""clown"" or mime who just seems a totally psychotic creep from the start.

A ""monster on board"" movie. Very typical, not badly done, with some fair acting a good production, but a Non-descript script.

HOWever! The closing scened ARE WORTH THE WAIT!! Spectacular stuff and a monster like you've never seen. It is gonad-wrenching terror! :)

Watch it!

Buy it!

4995203,4,B006JPD30E,"This is a high budget flick with tons of computer generated effects. In fact many of the sets are half or more computer generated. and it's a high grade of generation. (for 2011) these days two years later the effects would even be slightly better at the same budget.  So I reject the one star reviews that say the effects are bad. they are excellent for a high b or lower a movie. The 3d is post conversion , which never looks as good as a film shot in 3d. But this one looks as good as any Hollywood big budget post conversion film. And far better than let's say 'spiderman' did. Or 'john carter' even. This has lots of depth and if they had shot it in 3d it would have been a lot better as there are MANY shots that take  advantage of depth!.  The actors handle their roles very well too. And of course the lead actress really pulls the whole thing off. She's tough and scar covered but you wouldn't mind it because she's also very sexy and brave. The monster here is what we would have seen in many sci fi flicks of the 80'd , deep horizon etc only they have better effects today in some ways.  I liked those a lot those!.  The monster is super quick and super indestructible basically.  So it appears everywhere it's needed. Ok, this isn't  a great film but it's a good popcorn movie. A movie that is just about people fighting a big monster (although the monster just wants to eat and make babies so it's just a battle of survival really)  in a interesting setting. that's what you get here.  nothing less or more. And they pull it off , just remember that this level of effects would have been stunning twenty years ago. today it's a lower a film! That is how far we have come. but frankly those who trash this film should not review older sci fi films that are just like this one but with far less action! or modern effects. I can't imagine how they would trash those old flicks!  This one though is almost pure action!. So don't expect much character development. Sometimes I miss those old monster flicks where most of the film was about characters. But that doesn't matter this is a fast paced and exciting monster flick.  A good simple popcorn film.",1384819200,2,2161,4.311111111111111
4995204,2,B006JPD30E,"It took a while for the creature to show and when it did...well it was pretty bad CGI.  I also got tired of watching the lead actress ride a motorcycle....it looked rather fake since the scenery as she was riding by was void of co-workers.  There wasn't a big suspense build up when the workers were running from the creature...the viewer could see who was going to be killed.  In the final showdown...the timer is set to explode the rig but the final fight would take way longer than 10 minutes so I don't get why the makers timed it that way.  It seemed like they forgot they had a countdown then suddenly remembered then ohhh lets do another motorcycle ride.  The relationships between the characters weren't very developed either.  The guy liked the girl and we assume she likes him; however, she rarely shows it....poor character development and plot along with cheesey CGI and slow motion motorcycle rides do not make for an interesting monster movie.  Alien was much better and came way before this one...very disappointing.",1374883200,,1031,4.758426966292135
4995205,2,B006JPD30E,"7 Gwanggu (Sector 7) (Ji-hun Kim, 2011)

The first stop on this particular train ride actually has very little to do with this movie. It is Joon-ho Bong's megahit The Host, filmed five years before and, for a while, the highest-grossing film in the history of South Korean cinema. (Wikipedia still lists it as such, though some outlets are reporting that it has been overtaken by Hwan-kyung Lee's Miracle in Cell No. 7.) Why? Because you can no longer make a monster movie, especially one with a seagoing monster, in Korea and not be compared to The Host any more than you can make a giant-killer-shark movie in America and not have it be compared to Jaws. Just ain't gonna happen. Which brings me to the question surrounding the making and release of this film that should have, it seems to me, been painfully obvious: if you're going to take the same basic formula and then strip away everything from it that made The Host such a success, should you expect your movie to bomb?

Plot: On an oil rig off the coast of South Korea, one of the massive drills stops working. The diver sent down to check what's going on discovers something very strange indeed...and ends up paying for the discovery with his life. Fast-forward to a time in the future (I couldn't exactly tell how long--the time scheme in this movie doesn't quite make sense). Sector 7 has been closed to drilling since the accident, and is slated to be officially decommissioned, but the folks in charge, convinced that there is oil to be found there, decide to try a bit of covert drilling to see if they can get rich before shutting down the rig. Almost immediately, people start dying, and it's up to Hae-joon (Phone's Ji-won Ha) to figure out why before she ends up looking like the rest of the crew.

First off, one of my pet peeves, and I will simply mention it and say no more: any movie that requires an ""I brought you all together to explain how I solved the crime!"" scene a la Poirot is going to push my buttons, and not in a good way. Yes, there is one here, just before the climax. As usual, I wondered why [the person listening to the explanation] didn't simply shoot [the person droning on endlessly] [NOTE: spoilers removed]. But man, if you're going to make what is essentially a Host rip-off, at least come up with some good monster effects, you know? And I have to say, watching that first scene, where the diver first encounters the creature, I had hopes for this movie. It's gorgeously-shot, with wonderful underwater camerawork, including watching a massive whale pass slowly by the camera, and I absolutely loved it. Things went downhill from there pretty quick.

Still, well, it's not the worst monster movie I've ever seen, thanks to the raft of crappy monster movies unleashed by the Sci-Fi Channel over the past twenty years--but do yourself a favor and watch The Host again instead. Joon-ho Bong understood that playing it cheesy was the way to go, where Sector 7's biggest problem, even with all of the above said, is that it plays this movie as straight as it can. Very bad move indeed. **",1372118400,,3081,4.586206896551724
4995206,5,B006JPD30E,"You must applaud South Korea for producing such an ambitious SF/action film. Set on an oil rig, it is at once reminiscent of ALIENS and films like Leviathan, Deep Rising, and The Abyss. Although it is a somewhat evident ""green screen"" film - actors set in a combination of real sets with CGI fill-in - it is equally obvious that the set-ups are elaborate, with many takes required to produce all dimensions of a single shot. Comparisons will arise with THE HOST, the superior South Korean beastie flick. And THE HOST is the better film owing to it's unique story, deeper emotional core and family themes and beautiful cinematography. This film is more of a straight-up actioner with tacked on emotional notes, yet it doesn't pretend to be more than that, so enjoy it for what it offers, for here we have a Korean Ripley vs. an Aquatic Alien. Though the creature effects are a tad limited in their final rendering (compared to A-List Hollywood CGI), they are wonderfully designed and animated. The action choreography is a tad stagey at times - we're aware of a coordination of elements in a composited environment - but the film continuously compensates for its limitations with beautiful visuals, good acting on the part of its principals, and delivery on its core promise: solid creature action. If you have to buy one Korean creature film, start with the lovely THE HOST. If you find yourself wanting more, pick up Sector 7 with somewhat reduced expectations. Yes, we've seen it all before, but you'll find yourself rooting for these filmmakers for their valiant, if derivative, efforts.

4995213,4,B006JPD30E,"Compared to 'Alien' for good reason, this South Korean mega-hit (and the first film to be released in Korea in both 3D and Imax) has, as its setting, an oil drilling rig set way out to see off the coast of Korea, in sector 7.

4995215,3,B006JPD30E,"[Includes mild spoilers]

Looking for something like ""Alien""? Or a Korean monster flick ""The Host""? The story of a new Korean thriller ""Sector 7"" may be similar to that of Ridley Scott classic or Joon-ho Bong's critically acclaimed monster flick, but ""Sector 7"" lacks the thrills or sub-texts that make these two films something special. The film (shot in 3D) looks more like a ""Leviathan"" with better effects.

In ""Sector 7"" oil rig workers (with a few researchers) get involved in a serial murder perpetrated by some mysterious being. Set in an isolated oil rig floating in the ocean far off the coast of Jeju Island, South Korea, someone in the crew must have done that. But for some reason the crew's veteran Jeong Man (Sung-kee Ahn) remains calm. Maybe he knows something about these bloody incidents.

And of course we know the truth. It's a monster that did it. My point is, it takes too much time for the film to start telling the real story. That most characters are stock types is not a big problem. What we want is action, which arrives too late here. The film Ji-won Ha cuts a fine figure as the fighting heroine, but somehow the director Ji-hoon Kim seems more interested in showing the creature.

And the creature(s) - depending how you count - is pretty impressive. Special effects are decent and the set of ""The Eclipse,"" the isolated oil rig, is well done. With a faster pace and more skillful storytelling, ""Sector 7"" would have been much effective action thriller.",1355356800,,1483,4.714285714285714

4995219,4,B006JPD30E,"Korea's first 3D action film  ""Sector 7 arrives in American shores on Blu-ray 3D and Blu-ray courtesy of Shout Factory!

""Sector 7 generated a lot of excitement in Korea when it was first released.  Produced by ""Tidal Wave"" director JK Yoon, the film is directed by filmmaker Ji-hun Kim is best known for his drama ""May 18, the true story of the 1980 Gwangju massacre in South Korea, a film which earned him a nomination for best film at the 2007  Blue Dragon Awards.

This time around, Kim takes on an action film, in this case ""Sector 7, the first 3D action film to be released in South Korea.

""Sector 7 would star actress Ji-won Ha (""Tidal Wave"", ""Phone"", ""Sex is Zero""), Sung-kee Ahn (""The Warrior"", ""Battle of the Warriors"", ""The Divine Weapon"") and Ji-ho Oh (""Love Trilogy"", ""My Wife is a Gangster 3).

And now, this film will be released in the United States courtesy of Shout! Factory on Blu-ray 3d/Blu-ray (both versions on one Blu-ray disc).

VIDEO:

""Sector 7 is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1). The film can be viewed in 3D or 2D, but for 3D, one must own a 3D-enabled TV, 3D glasses and 3D-enabled Blu-ray player.

While I felt the CG work for the film was amazing, especially when it came to creating the monster for the film, on Blu-ray, you see quite a good amount of detail for the antagonist and also the scenery. The CG work was really well done and making you feel the film was shot in the ocean.  The film is not too violent.  We do see blood, but we do not see the characters getting bludgeoned or eaten by the monster.

It's important to note that one of the key criticisms that the film received in theaters was that it was too dark for certain scenes.  So, they had to lighten up the film a bit.  I personally didn't observe any problems with scenes that were too dark.  Black levels were good, really nice and deep.  There were good details when it came to the monster and the clarity of closeups on the character's faces.  While the CG work was well-done, I did notice a few scenes with mild artifacts, especially on scenes with a lot of bright red.

Bare in mind, this is South Korea's first foray into 3D action but they did manage to create a good amount of depth especially during the most perilous moments of the film.  I don't want to spoil the action segments so much for the viewer but the depth for scenes that involve one hanging off a ledge of Sector 7 or scenes featuring the monster and its use of its killer tongue was nicely done.  But I will give JK Film and CJ Entertainment some credit for getting into 3D action films and ""Sector 7 being the first.  But even for modern American 3D films, aside from ""Avatar"", many Hollywood films didn't utilize 3D all that well and with ""Sector 7, the 3D was good but it'll be interesting to see how far they utilize the technology especially for Blu-ray in the next few years.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Sector 7 is presented in Korean DTS-HD MA 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 and English Dolby Digital Stereo.  The lossless soundtrack is pretty awesome.  Because of the high level of action featured in the film, with many gunshots, explosions, motorcycle revving, metal pipes dropping everywhere, glass shattering and the monster screaming constantly, there is a good use of the surround channels in ""Sector 7 as well as a good amount of LFE.  While not too immersive as I would have hoped, ""Sector 7 still has a solid lossless soundtrack.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES

EXTRAS:

""Sector 7 comes with the Blu-ray 3D and Blu-ray version of the film on one disc.  A slipcover case is also included.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Sector 7 is a film that comes off with mix results.

In many ways, it's an action film that contains many sci-fi cliches and also utilizes JK Youn's style of screenwriting which involves comedy during moments where people are close to dying.  It was used quite a bit in his film ""Tidal Wave"" and it was a comedic style that received mix results by western viewers who were not used to seeing tragic or near-tragic moments of the film.

And the same happens in ""Sector 7.  The film centers around actress Ji-won Ha's character of Hae-jun, similar to Ripley of the ""Alien"" films, she is a strong woman who is blunt and determined to find oil around Sector 7.  Not afraid to show off her strength in front of the guys, nor is she afraid to race a motorcycle with her boyfriend Dong-soo on board the oil rig, she is a very strong character.

And while we have Hae-jun as the strong protagonist of the film, her supporting cast are not as strong.  Her boyfriend Dong-soo is often criticized of being the woman in the relationship with Hae-jun and then we have two male crew members (a gay couple) who are often cracking jokes with one another and then you have mechanic who is often seen as a character who acts as if he's mentally disabled, inebriated or just crazy.

There was no doubt that these characters were added to balance out the film's horrifying moments and action, but at the same time, there is a banality throughout the film that these people are just fodder for the monstrous entity that is stalking them.

In one scene, while the two crew members are being eyed by the monster, the captain orders them to know the crates down.  But instead, one misinterprets it as clapping.  So, while the crew is armed with weapons and waiting to attack the beast, the crew member is just clapping.

As for the mechanic, he's often seen as a weird man making weird faces and trying to get the scientist onboard to like him and possibly be her girlfriend.

And for western viewers, the comedy incorporated into this action-film during these more unnerving moments may seem unnecessary or just all out weird.  But I have watched many Asian films to know that these things occur quite often, may it be a zombie film or a horror film.  Knowing the cast members and seeing comedians is a big indication that there will be comedy and more often, they are going to be fodder to monsters, zombies, aliens, etc.  And the same goes for ""Sector 7.

In many ways, ""Sector 7 reminded me of the film ""Sunshine"", where a killer goes after the whole crew, in this case, it's a huge monster that appears to not have many weaknesses and watching it, you wonder who will survive (especially since a few of the characters seem to be created as monster fodder).  While ""Sunshine"" utilized visual effects of a space station and the sun, ""Sector 7 is a film that relies on blue/green screen and CG technology.  From the monster to the environment of ""Sector 7, for the most part, the oil rig in the middle of the ocean looks very convincing on film, but there are some action-driven moments that didn't look right, especially one scene featuring Hae Jun walking away from an explosion.

But still, ""Sector 7 is a major step forward for a Korean studio.  Back in 2007, filmmaker Hyung-rae Shim really took the risk of trying to make ""Dragon Wars"" internationally friendly and unfortunately, it was the film's biggest problem.  Instead of trying to appeal internationally by hiring unknown actors that speak English, I'm so happy that ""Sector 7 maintains its Korean identity.  Asian action cinema tends to have its own style much different from a Hollywood film and may the action be over-the-top or humor placed in unusual moments, it's part of what I enjoy about Asian action films, especially Korean films, because of the unpredictability.

""Sector 7 is actually quite predictable and full of sci-fi cliches.  As mentioned, there is a bit of ""Sunshine"", a bit of ""Alien"", a bit of the ""Abyss"" and the monster and the fighting, it reminded me a lot like the video game ""Resident Evil III: Nemesis"".

Korean filmmakers (and screenwriters) will spare no expense to kill off a protagonist or to win you over and then suddenly give you something quite unexpected and tragic.  While ""Sector 7 is a film that shows a strong female protagonist and has an Ripley vs. Alien type of feel, ""Sector 7 is first and foremost a popcorn action film, with an ending that left you feeling complacent but at the same time, making you feel a bit cheated.  But I suppose, the endings does leave things open for possibly a sequel.  Who knows?

While the special effects of ""Sector 7 are impressive, the only thing that I felt was a bit uneven was mainly makeup effects.  There are times when the main character Hae-Jun was cut, full of blood and sweaty and then next thing you know, she is not as sweaty, looking much better.  There is a moment when her right arm is jacked up but then she is OK and able to fight with it.  The film loses its consistency when it comes to these details.

And last, the major plus of this film is that audiences all over the world, especially here in the United States, will be treated to a Korean action film in 3D for the very first time!

""Sector 7 is a step forward for Korean action cinema and for it's use of CG work but as for the film itself, well... it was OK.  Western viewers probably will not see the 3D utilization of this film as groundbreaking and some may find the humor a bit bizarre.  But still, there is something about the film that makes it quirky but yet enjoyable.  If anything, you just want to see how much damage this monster can create, especially how these characters die.

Overall, ""Sector 7 is a solid first entry from Korea's JK film/CJ Entertainment into the 3D action genre.  The film definitely seems to have been inspired by well-known sci-films and possibly even a few video games, but for the most part, it's a banal, sci-fi action film with its fair share of sci-fi cliches. But for a Korean popcorn action film that can be enjoyed in 3D or 2D, despite its shortcomings, ""Sector 7 manages to be a fun film with a lot of humor and off-the-wall action!",1352419200,3,10394,4.553879310344827
4995220,2,B006JPD30E,It was an okay movie.  The plot and dialogue were kind of helter skelter and did not flow very smoothly. But it was somewhat entertaining.,1351468800,,138,4.52
4995221,3,B006JPD30E,"There was enough here to keep my interest for maybe a half hour but the effects were sloppy, heavy handed drama mixed with  hammy comedic moments and some serious over acting. The creature sucked as well - and I don't mean that in the horrific horror movie sense.
  About on par with a mediocre SyFy channel clunker. There was more potential here. Production and directorial mismanagement probably kept this from becoming something worthwhile.
  Save your money for something good unless you're a completist and just have to add this to your Korean horror collection.",1350864000,,567,4.98936170212766

The movie itself is a pretty good movie. Good plot,good charicter development and like others have said really fun 3D.

There was a really good general depth through out the movie and a lot of fun pop outs too. Some may have been a little corny but never the less it was still fun to see and made me jump at times too.

4995236,3,B006JPD30E,"Sector 7 is a serviceable monster movie that was worth a watch-thru in my personal opinion.  It plays out similarly to other creature features where the heroine butt heads with a nearly unstoppable monster; amongst her somewhat inept, treacherous, or unlucky colleagues.

A few men will display heroics, but you know what happens to those guys in a movie like this.  In short, there will be no deviation from similar monster movies.

The main draw for me was the starlet, Ha Ji Won, who is a veteran of the Korean movie/TV industry at the young age of 34.  Here are a few samples of her other starring roles available here on Amazon:

The creature in question is quite ugly, detailed, and nicely animated.  However like many lower-budget CGI films, the monster looked a little ""off"" from the rest of the world.  So a suspension of belief will be necessary to accept the monster as `real', and enjoy the movie; the payoff is in the final battle between Hae Jun & the monster.

In conclusion, I cannot really recommend this movie as a ""must see"" or ""must buy"", despite my fondness of Ha Ji Won and monster films in general.  Still...  the movie is a fair purchase to those:

- That enjoy B monster fares.
- A fan of the actress.
- The price is reasonable to you.
- General collector of films.",1341792000,6,1883,6.395256916996048
4995237,4,B006JPD30E,"This is an average sci-fi monster movie about a drilling team on an offshore rig that are attacked by a mysterious creature.  Their options are limited because a storm hits and they have limited weapons.  The mystery is what is the creature and why is it there.

Overall, the movie is enjoyable - but I am a big sci-fi fan.  The movie was recorded in Korean but there is the option to listen to a version dubbed in English (rather than watch the Korean version with subtitles).  I am very grateful for that because I get tired reading subtitles.  However, the sound quality is not as good in the dubbed version.  In particular, some of the subtle background sounds seem to be missing.  And the voice inflection is not as good as in the Korean version.  So I actually enjoyed the movie more in Korean.  The movie is in 3D.  But I cannot comment on that because I do not have a 3D TV.

Overall, the movie was enjoyable.  Yes, there are some flaws.  But that is true with most sci-fi movies.  I give it 4 stars for the Korean version and 3 for the dubbed version.",1340928000,,1060,4.309644670050761

4995239,4,B006JPD30E,"Sector 7 is a action-horror monster film from South Korea. It's got some comedy in it as well. The movie is about an oil rig crew that has had no luck getting oil at Sector 7. Soon after most of the crew leaves the rig, they are attacked by an unknown species. There are some twists to the story pertaining to the monster that I won't spoil. Overall, the story isn't that innovative, but it is one amazing thrill ride.

What did I like? I'm a fan of monster films so I definitely liked the subject. The monster's design was also cool. The film has bits of comedy spread out across the film that I actually liked. The best part of the film was the action, though. As soon as the monster appears, it's thrill after thrill after thrill. In one word: THRILLING! It has a couple of slow-motion scenes that I actually enjoyed, even though it was over-done sometimes. Also, the pacing was fast and smooth. The whole concept of being stuck on an oil rig with a monster was creepy and effective. The acting was fine most of the time, and the music was good. Ultimately, it's an absolute blast to watch!

What did I dislike? Sector 7 really doesn't try anything new. The explanation of the monster's creation was new, but not really extraordinary. Also, some scenes just looked very bad, particularly the scenes on the motorcycles. I believe this is because I watched the 2D version, but it still looked and felt out of place. The ending was also generic and predictable, which I didn't expect coming from South Korea (they usually don't follow the same Hollywood formula).

I highly recommend checking out Sector 7. It's a great action-horror film. It had elements from movies like  The Host, Relic, Deep Rising, and Aliens; it may not be better than Aliens and The Host, but it's up there with them. I'll have to try and watch it in 3D soon since it looked effective and well-made, but that's just an assumption. If you're even slightly interested, Sector 7 is available on Netflix Streaming as of 6/26/12 and I recommend you watch it whenever you have the time.

No sex or nudity, only some violence and gore. (safe compared to other monster films)",1340668800,21,2141,4.55064935064935

I ordered the region ""A"" Hong Kong 3D+2D blu-ray that was released on February 23. Nice transfer. Good film. Good special effects. I haven't watched the 3D version on the Hong Kong blu-ray yet to comment about it. If you enjoy films like ""The Host"", ""Troll Hunter"", ""Attack The Block"", ""Monsters"", ""Chaw"", ""Cloverfield"", ""Super 8"", ""The Mist"", ""The Relic"", ""Mimic"" and other good creature features, then you enjoy ""Sector 7"" as well.
