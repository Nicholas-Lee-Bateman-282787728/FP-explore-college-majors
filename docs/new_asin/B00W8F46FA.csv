7126772,5,B00W8F46FA,"A very intelligent presentation dealing with the ""supernatural"". It combines historic settings with eyewitness accounts that does leave one asking ""perhaps there IS something"" to spook, spirits and hobgoblins!!!!",1436054400,,212,6.344827586206897
7126773,5,B00W8F46FA,Really interesting show lovely places and good stories but no. Real ghosts,1435968000,,74,5.25
7126774,5,B00W8F46FA,"A note to those who are considering watching this: it is not the usual scary re-enactment type ghost docu-drama. Instead it is a documentary that features the most haunted pubs, hotels, and private residences in the UK with a lot of historical background provided. If you enjoy watching a documentary that features interviews with local historians and provides perspectives that might help explain ghostly sightings and poltergeist activity in these places, then this show is for you. There are no reenactments, instead the format is basically this: a female host goes from place to place, covering the various regions in the UK, and focuses on the most haunted places; she then enlists the help of local experts (historians, owners of the residences in question, paranormal investigators) to help provide tours of the place as they explain the possible causes of the hauntings and point out places where people have experienced supernatural encounters.

I enjoyed this show very much because I'm a self-confessed Anglophile who can only dream of visiting these historic, haunted places some day. The historical background provided on each property as well as the wonderful cinematography makes this a compelling watch. I also loved seeing archival photographs from days long gone by featured in each episode. All in all, I found this show educational and interesting.",1435622400,4,1368,5.275229357798165
7126775,5,B00W8F46FA,I love seeing all the old buildings in England. Wether their are ghosts or not I would still find them interesting.,1435276800,2,115,4.523809523809524
7126776,5,B00W8F46FA,"I love this show.  Other than the fact that the thick British accents can be hard to understand, the stories are spellbinding.  Here in the states we don't have any 800 year old haunted castles.",1433980800,3,194,4.514285714285714
7126777,3,B00W8F46FA,"I wouldn't spend any money on this. While the presenter is very likable, It's not at all scary, and even when people say they have photos with apparitions in them, photos are never produced. There's no evidence of any paranormal activity.

The ghost stories are  interesting, but all but a few are very well-known, and there was no new information.",1433894400,,348,4.783333333333333
7126778,4,B00W8F46FA,Love the history behind everything. It's a fun Watch with some creepiness. Did not know Great Britain was so haunted?!,1433808000,,118,4.95
7126779,3,B00W8F46FA,Verbal renditions on each location. No videos or photos of the haunts. The locations are interesting.,1433721600,,101,5.375

7126784,2,B00W8F46FA,I really wanted to like this show but it was kind of boring. Ghosts should never be dull. Boo! hoo.,1444953600,,99,4.0
7126785,1,B00W8F46FA,Why do you have a male voice over for a female? Oh and the show is cheesy by the way.,1444694400,,85,3.3
7126786,4,B00W8F46FA,Great for Halloween time!,1444176000,,25,5.5
7126787,4,B00W8F46FA,"Each episode is good, but this Halloween one was kinda of ruined by the fake seance. The smarmy guy in the black shirt really looked like he was moving the glass.",1444089600,,162,4.258064516129032

7126795,3,B00W8F46FA,"I love the locations. The narration seems odd as it is a man speaking, but the host is a female. They often mention EVP  sessions, but they do not physically show the results.",1441929600,,175,4.303030303030303

7126802,5,B00W8F46FA,"There is nothing terrifying here, nothing even scary really. But if you love history and a detailed look at some pretty amazing, VERY old places in GB this is a good series. It is not overly dramatic like US ghost shows are, they are actually kind of relaxing and really, some of the places are so unique and impressive because of their age and history. If you like traveling this is a nice way to do it from your living room.",1440374400,,426,4.271604938271605
7126803,3,B00W8F46FA,More interesting than some 'ghost' shows.,1440374400,,41,6.0
7126804,5,B00W8F46FA,"Great show.  Incredible locations, behind the scenes look, history and legends.  This is the best ""ghost/paranormal"" show I've seen.  Most are phony with no integrity, and sensationalized.  Skip the goofy American shows and try this one.",1439251200,,237,5.5
7126805,5,B00W8F46FA,"Unlike US shows, one can tell Britons take their ghosts seriously & to heart!!  They've been doing it longer & better!! Long live Yvette Fielding!!",1439078400,,147,4.88

7126807,1,B00W8F46FA,Boring and poorly made.,1438387200,,23,5.0
7126808,5,B00W8F46FA,I loved the second season as much as. the first.,1436745600,,48,3.9
7126809,5,B00W8F46FA,I love this show! Someday I hope to travel to Great Britain and visit these ghostly and amazing sites.,1436140800,,102,4.421052631578948
8712521,3,B00W8F46FA,"This series is OK for the reason that it is fascinating to see the insides of these old 400 year old homes and photos and memorabilia from the past centuries.  When it comes to ghosts, all these stately homes make their money selling rooms to folk and of course are going to say the homes are filled with ghosts to keep people coming back and new tourists visiting, that is how they all make their money.  But, because everything is hearsay, you can bet that all of these homes are 99.9% ghost free.",1502755200,,499,4.354838709677419

8712524,4,B00W8F46FA,"I often wonder why Great Britain has so many ghosts. Perhaps it is because the British have such a bloody past, with invasions and wars and such.",1476230400,,145,4.407407407407407
8712525,4,B00W8F46FA,The locations are the real stars and part of the charm of this series.  The stories themselves were entertaining.  I watched both seasons and thoroughly enjoyed them.,1463702400,,166,5.111111111111111
8712526,4,B00W8F46FA,"enjoyable, informative, and entertaining.",1460764800,,41,9.5
8712527,4,B00W8F46FA,Good series with interesting sites for sure. The history about each building was more interesting than the ghosts that haunt them. Getting to see some great early English architecture was a highlight for me.,1455580800,2,207,5.117647058823529
8712528,3,B00W8F46FA,Interesting,1454198400,,11,11.0
