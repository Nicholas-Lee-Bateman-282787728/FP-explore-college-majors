8440627,5,B004TEPM2Y,"I bought the Video tape a long time ago (the 80's). This is a concert of a younger, vivacious Gary Moore. He was on the cusp of transitioning from hard driving rock to the softer blues that he has become known for of recent years. This is a show that most people that have knowledge of his past and recent work will appreciate. The track at the end of the concert is worth it all... The Loner. What a wonderful piece of work. I can only hope the DVD is as well engineered",1308787200,,471,4.075268817204301
