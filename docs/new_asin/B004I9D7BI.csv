4384745,5,B004I9D7BI,"I loved this series so much, I watched it twice in 4 days and I want to watch it again! This was so worth it. This series is a great addition to my Korean drama collection. All my children love it too. It is romantic, dramatic with enough comedy to balance everything out.",1325462400,5,272,4.150943396226415
4384746,5,B004I9D7BI,What an amazing story from beginning to end!  Interesting how the characters each provided a story and really brought it to life!  A favourite of mine!,1324857600,2,151,4.769230769230769
4384747,5,B004I9D7BI,"Awesome show, awesome cast. Nothing bad about this show. I loved it from beginning to end!! This is my favorite show so far!! Love it!!!",1324252800,,136,4.48
4384748,5,B004I9D7BI,From the first episode I was hooked. It is one of the best dramas I have ever seen. You'll love it.,1322956800,3,99,3.761904761904762
4384749,4,B004I9D7BI,"I recently saw an episode (someone around 12) on Korean TV (without subs) and thought it was intriguing despite the language barrier, so I searched around so I could watch it from the beginning.

I found this show to be very addicting and their stopping points always left me needing to see the next part.  The con to this is that they would replay the last few minutes at the beginning of the next episode which is obviously their way of saying, ""Last time on ...""

Overall, there was drama (and I understand why Koreans call TV shows dramas, not shows), which is expected, but it didn't appear to be over the top until the end of the series.  I was slightly disappointed as the beginning was very well-done.  Still, I think you can say that about most TV shows, so I don't hold it against this one.

I think if you like historical dramas, romantic comedies or are simply interested about Korean culture, this would be a good show to watch!",1313712000,4,941,4.441860465116279
4384750,5,B004I9D7BI,"This drama is one of the best! The characters are awesome as well as the acting! I love the music so much too! If you are a Kpop fan the group JYJ does some of the songs for the ost.  Also Micky Yoochun, a JYJ member is the male lead! I never found the story slow. I think even if you aren't a fan of historical dramas you are going to love this one! I couldn't even become loyal to one ship because I love the characters so much! Its a must see!

This drama is a great introduction to Korean dramas.  It is also a good introduction to historical dramas.",1312156800,15,554,3.972972972972973
4384751,4,B004I9D7BI,"This is a fun historical drama-comedy. I watched it without expectations, and was quickly drawn into the story. It's witty and intriguing, and there's romance, too, with plenty of comical misunderstandings and tension.

The subtitles are good until the last two or three episodes, when whoever was translating seems to have been drunk or inattentive: fragmented sentences, incomplete thoughts, and just downright nonsense. However, the gist of story can still be inferred from the actors themselves and from the occasional subtitle that makes sense. (For a better set of subtitles, watch the series online on Hulu.)

5 stars for the story, only 3 stars for the subtitles, so I give this 4 stars overall.",1301788800,2,703,5.157894736842105
4384752,5,B004I9D7BI,"Sungkyunkwan Scandal is a very entertaining Korean drama which is set in the latter part of the Joseon era, during the reign of King Jeongjo (approximately 1790). Sungkyunkwan is a university (which exists to this day, although in different form) where the rich sons of the noble class would train to be government officials. During that period, there was a rigid division of social classes and gender. Women had no value at all; they were not allowed to study (other than basic studies at home) and could only hope their parents would arrange a good marriage for them. Smack in the middle of this scenario, there is one young girl, Yoon-Hee, who had to pretend to be a boy so she could earn money for her sick brother's medicines, and for her widowed mother. Without going into details, she ended up as a student at Sungkyunkwan (through a series of convoluted events), and had to use all her wits to keep anyone from learning she is a girl, especially the two students (both male of course) with whom she shares her dorm room.

Part of the story revolves around King Jeongjo's desire to build a new city where social classes don't matter. In order to accomplish that, he needs to find a document which was lost ten years earlier, detailing the abuses committed by some members of the government elite. It's a bit more complex than that, but I want to keep this review as simple as possible for those who don't know Korean history. The greater part of the story revolves around Yoon-Hee's (who is using her brother's name, Yoon-Shik) stratagems to keep her gender secret, and the camaraderie she develops with three of her fellow students. There are also a few villains, in the persona of the student-body president and his boot-licking cronies, who are out to make trouble for Yoon-hee and her friends.

Eventually one of her roommates discovers her secret, and he becomes her unacknowledged bodyguard and protector, and secret admirer. Her other roommate falls in love with her mind, personality and intelligence, but since he thinks she's a man, and that he has fallen in love with a man, he has to first accept the fact that he is ""gay"" (which goes completely against the social norms of the time, and his own principles). I loved how he wrestled against his own feelings, and the angst he went through before deciding to throw all cares to the wind and saying what was in his heart.

In the end everything works itself out, but this is one drama where the best part is the ride, rather than the destination. Somewhere along the line you will fall in love with all the characters in this drama. After every episode you'll say ""that was the best episode"", until you watch the next episode, which will become the ""best episode"", and so on.

You won't need to know Korean history to enjoy this drama. It helps if you know a little bit of the history of the era, but even if you don't, this drama doesn't depend on historical accuracy (in fact there are a few inaccuracies).  The drama deals mostly with human nature, emotions, feelings, and other human qualities which are universal and do not change from one era to another.

I've seen a lot of Korean dramas over the years, some I've liked a lot, some I've liked a little, some I haven't liked, and some I thought were okay at the time, but I wouldn't want to watch again. This one falls into the category of ""OMG, I love it, it's my favorite, and I want to watch it again and again.""

May 25, 2011, Follow-up to above review:
This particular version of the DVD may no longer be available, because a Director's Cut version has now been issued with lots of extras, deleted scenes, behind the scenes, interviews, etc.  It's available from other sources (overseas), but I'd like to wait until Amazon gets it because their service is so much better. But be prepared to pay: the cost of the Director's Cut DVD is approximately $170.00.",1299974400,5,3890,4.609826589595376
4384753,5,B004I9D7BI,"Great customer service, quick delivery and excellent quality. I received my order 2 days after I purchased. About the drama: I've read some reviews comparing it to the F4 boys in the Boys over Flowers, which made me purchase this movie. It turned out to be different storyline and everything else, but it's still a great series.",1358380800,,328,4.771929824561403
4384754,5,B004I9D7BI,"I LOVE Kdramas, and this is by far my favorite. Micky Yoochun, the lead actor, does a phenomenal job in the role. With Song Joong Ki and Yoo Ah In also featured, the cast is hard to beat. I highly recommend this drama to any Kdrama fan, whether you're a fan of historical ones or not.",1358294400,2,284,4.089285714285714
4384755,5,B004I9D7BI,"Fast service, excellent quality DVD set.  English Sub-titles are good.  Would definitely recommend buying this DVD set from this vendor.",1353801600,,136,5.75
4384756,4,B004I9D7BI,"In Sungkyunkwan Scandal, Kim Yoon Hee, a bright young woman in 18th century Korea, poses as a boy to work to support her family. She ends up in an all-male school and hijinks ensue as she tries to conceal her secret.
  Sungkyunkwan Scandal doesn't break much new ground. Girl-posing-as-boy stories are plentiful and all the things you'd normally expect to see in these stories happen - everyone comments on how pretty ""he"" is, main love interest wonders if he's gay as he realizes his feelings are growing for his supposedly male roommate, and there are several close calls involving our heroine almost getting caught in situations that require her to remove some or all of her clothing. (With this being a Korean drama, though, there's nothing really risqu about how it's all depicted)
  What elevates Sungkyunkwan Scandal above its unoriginal plot are a combination of factors. The acting across the board is excellent, with many of the actors endearing themselves to the audience with loads of charm. Sets and costumes are very pleasing to the eye, and comedy, drama, intrigue and romance are balanced deftly. The pacing is good. At 20 hour-long episodes, this show feels just right, not too long and not too short.
  If I have one gripe, it's the love interest for our heroine! Lee Sun Joon, the uptight son of a minister, is the least appealing of the three main prospects for Kim Yoon Hee. Her other two companions, Moon Jae Shin and Gu Yong Ha, are much more interesting! Moon Jae Shin, a skilled archer and indifferent student, wears three different faces during the series. The one you see him in the most often is fortunately the most flattering. He dons commoners robes and wears long hair, which is a nice change from all the topknots. He is gruffly kind, and very much fits the role of a reluctant hero. The outrageously flamboyant Gu Yong Ha is a hoot! This character has some of the series best one liners. Though he often seems detached and committed mainly to his own amusement, that masks a savvy young man who usually ends up doing the right thing and, on more than one occasion, saving the day.
  I suppose he could just suffer by comparison, but Lee Sun Joon seems kind of dull. This character is frequently remarked upon by most of the other characters as being uptight and not much fun. He has a strong moral fiber and there's more than one instance of him admonishing other characters for breaking rules or not adhering to the most proper form of behavior. I think the intention was to paint him as being possessed of a firm sense of justice but to me he mostly just seems irritatingly self-righteous.
  It's all a matter of taste, of course, but the chemistry between he and Kim Yoon Hee feels a bit lacking sometimes and I wonder how it would have been with my preference, Moon Jae Shin, or even, though it's making me laugh as I write this to think of it, Gu Yong Ha.
  Oh, well. There will definitely be and are Lee Sun Joon fans, and the love story aspect should be quite satisfying for them. Sungkyunkwan Scandal makes it pretty clear from the start that there's only one man for Kim Yoon Hee. And even if you take out the main love story, there's plenty to like here. A happy ending is also guaranteed for those who don't like those tragic, weepy k-dramas where a beloved character dies of some exceedingly rare or poorly explained illness. Sungkyunkwan Scandal is a worth a watch. (or five)",1352678400,,3422,4.619439868204283

4384758,4,B004I9D7BI,"So, I have watched lots of K-drama's and have used the Korean verison of Boys over Flowers as my benchmark of a true 5 star show.  I would have given this show a 4.5 out of 5, but I can't.  Since it is a period peice, it takes a few episodes to get used to the setting, but the story is great and has many layers.  I would recommend for any K-dra fans.",1341878400,,352,3.7945205479452055
4384759,4,B004I9D7BI,"I enjoyed this show very much.  The actors where all SO adorable!  I fell in love with all of the four main characters.  Their chemistry was great and they just drew me in.  I would have given this five stars except I felt at times like I was getting preached at on the equality of all.  I totally agree that all people are equal but I think it didn't have to be so in my face at various points of the show.  I think this story was a little simple and could have gone to a totally different level if they added a bit more tension.  Overall, however, I really enjoyed it and plan on watching it again.

As for family friendly...overall I would not recommend for those under 12 as some may find the basic plot concerning.",1341273600,,719,4.159420289855072

4384761,5,B004I9D7BI,"I adore these characters and storyline. This worst part of this series is that I don't have enough time to watch more than a couple of episodes per day. I totally recommend it. I am not Asian, I accidently was exposed to this while surfing the net. There is tons of intrigue and eye candy. When I'm not watching it, I'm thinking about it. This is my favorite show ever. It is a real departure from the normal young people shows. These young people are very respectful and have a dignified demeanor. Yay Korea Next Old Boy and Bad Guy.

4384762,4,B004I9D7BI,"This series was a very fun, cute show but those guys must have been seriously naive to have not realised that the main character was female. That said, it was entertaining and, for once, had a happy ending..it is after all, geared toward a younger audience..can't have a dark ending. Product was good--no glitches in the discs, translation seemed to flow pretty well (what do I know? I don't speak Korean).",1327881600,5,406,4.732394366197183

The plot was decent too, and nothing too dramatic.
The box set was great as well. If you can't get the Korean versions, the best ones after them in the YA Entertainment versions, if you can. They're the best!

8430351,5,B004I9D7BI,"I love Micky Yoochun of  Super K-KPOP group TVXQ/JYJ. Matter-of-fact as I type this review I am watching their music video ""O""
Anyway, moving along. I loved this drama, not because of my bias toward Yoochun but because it was really good. The story line, the beautiful scenery, the supporting cast. All superb. Though I have noticed, the theme of Sunghyunkwan Scandal is used alot in Korea. Basically, a young woman is forced to enrolled in a all boys school/enviroment to earn a living for her family.  For instance, it has been used it in dramas like (You're Beautiful, Coffee Prince, and To The beautiful You"" in each case the plot is basically the same, a woman has to pass off as a man, while at the same time, falling in love with her main chracter, who has to check his manhood to make sure he's not falling for a man. Sound simple, right. I guess it is how you look at it.  I enjoyed each of these dramas, the writing was fresh, crisp, and emotional. The females acting was great, as the women had to pretend to be men and it really drew you in. My only complaint was that, the women didn't look like men, in the real world the men would have known it. But I guess that is why they call it ACTING. Still I would recommend, Sunjkyukwan Scandal.",1363564800,,1251,4.360515021459228
