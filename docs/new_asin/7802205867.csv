People in an office work to 6 PM. They take the Underground Railway home. One man returns to his home. [Note the manual sewing machine.] He wants a better life. A letter from a rich uncle offers him money for a better life. They cross the channel on their way to Paris. They see the sights. They visit the Folies Bergre. Prayer before bedtime. Then to Marseilles for a cruise ship to the Far East. The sun sets, a man talks to Emily. Fred suffers from mal de mer. There are shipboard activities. Commander Gordon talks to Emily and spends time with her. Fred is still abed. Then Fred recovers, but is hit by a thrown game piece. They see Port Said. Merchants offer goods for sale. Fred and Emily become separated. Then its the Suez Canal and Carnival. Fred spends time with the Princess. She says Cabin 19"". Fred dances with another woman.

Emily spends time with Gordon. The voyage comes to an end. And the shipboard romance? They arrive at Singapore. Gordon tells Emily that the Princess is an adventuress, just out for Freds money. Emily returns to Fred and talks. Is everybody a sham? Fred refuses t listen; goodbye. Gordon sends a goodbye letter to Emily. Fred learns the Princess has left him after borrowing 1,000! This left him nearly penniless. They take a cheap boat home. There is a bang, people run around. They are trapped in their cabin! Im sorry. They escape through the porthole. What can they do now? A Chinese ship arrives, men climb aboard to scavenge. Their ship sinks. They are fed. Finally they return home wiser and poorer. Or are they? They bicker again.

This is a comedy of manners where a couples dreams of happiness lead to unexpected problems. There is a lesson to this. Many people who win a lottery prize spend it all then go bankrupt. Was Commander Gordon teamed with the Princess for this scam?",1456012800,,1856,4.5675675675675675
