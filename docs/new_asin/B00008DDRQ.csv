1835437,2,B00008DDRQ,"I have come to expect a lot from Broadway Theatre Archive. They save the best, I thought. However, this is defintely not the best version of Tartuffe that I have seen. I first saw it onstage, presented by the Trinity Square Reperatory Company in Providence, Rhode Island. The audience, including me, laughed so much we almost fell out of our seats. But, this version, unfortunately, is boring. If you want to see a really funny version, watch the BBC filmed version of the Royal Shakepeare Company's production of Tartuffe. It's a great laugh!",1170201600,24,543,4.849462365591398
1835438,5,B00008DDRQ,"If you see only one Tartuffe in your lifetime, skip the one about which you are currently reading. Grand, to be sure, it is 2nd best to the 1st best Tartuffe: the 1983 BBC/Royal Shakespeare Company's production of ""TARTUFFE, OR THE IMPOSTER"" by Molire, (Jean-Baptiste ""Crazylegs"" Poquelin)

A Faitour de Force of Giggles and Grandeur . . .

Comedy is notorious for its inability to properly translate from one language to another or from once upon then to the here and now. It is quite undeniable that the fitful psycho-familial rantings of King Lear do move us so; as do other 17th Century sensations such as Henry V's Azincourt call-to-arms or our Jew of Malta's enkindled response to a naughty daughter's apostatizing Semitical dis (the burning down of her nunnery to kill NONE but her; but instead killing ALL but her) . . . alright...that has the merit of mirth in a rather sick, sad, base, colour and hue. But genuinely intended time-worn giggles and humour from yesterday invariably fall flat upon contemporary ears and sensibilities. Flat they fall invariably, BUT FOR Jean-Baptiste Poquelin a.k.a. the grand French playwright of clever comedies, Molire.

Without too much contemporary tinkering, Molire's 17th century play 'Tartuffe, or the Imposter' is the Royal Shakespeare Company's brightest and most pleasant production. Chris Hampton's adaptation from the original French text is faithful AND funny-the text DOES translate-and this a supreme credit to Molire's transcendent creative merit.

The casting is as good as for one could wish for such a production. Nigel Hawthorne is Orgon, the inforbearant father taken twice by our imposter Tartuffe. Alison Steadman is Elmire, his wife and better-minded better half into whose knickers our principal wishes to get. Try as she might, Elmire can not nearly sway away or temper Orgon's supplicative genuflexions for Tartuffe.

Lesley Sharp and Ian Talbot play Mariane and Valre, the in-and-out-of-love, might-be, could-be lovers; and Stephanie Fayerman plays (and quite obviously love to play) the family's impertinent maid. A girl, by her low birth and ignoble breeding, so often improperly punctures her way into any and nearly all conversations her opinions, which as invariably as her interruptions are in opposition to father Orgon's. And then there is our principal; the man to which this play lends a title: Antony Sher: the Imposter.

The acutely brilliant Sir Antony Sher is herein as acutely brilliant as ever before or since. Sher is unquestionably a Tartuffe that would find love with Molire himself. He is the ever-so-well-played clever Tartuffe; he is the ever-so-well-played wicked and dissembling Tartuffe. But standing tall and inclining in oblique coital preparedness above all, he is the Tartuffe hopelessly aroused by Elmire's (Steadman's) ample merits. Setting is eyes and other assorted bits upon Orgon's wife, Elmire, the perfidiously prophetically wise Tartuffe wages all earned faith and currency from the family for a less ecumenical inclination toward Elmire.

The 1983 BBC Royal Shakespeare Company's production of 'Tartuffe, or the Imposter' is, I'm sure, available at better libraries and rental outlets. It is well worth the effort of renting; and for others better worth the effort of purchase.

Molire's works-this Tartuffe MOST among all others-shall never corrode. It is a clever play and a funny play that is rendered so well by the Royal Shakespeare Company; and not a play without some distinct relevance to today's world of demiprophets, prevaricators, shanks, shysters and story-tellers. As comedy is the voice the clever mind at muse, so Antony Sher is the voice, and Molire his muse; and this is a  clear masterwork of humour.",1111190400,25,3727,5.271500843170321
7981672,4,B00008DDRQ,"Great film and expertly acted, but this version of the play is much more ""serious"" than others I've seen.  The play lends itself to be silly and exaggerated - I wanted the actors to have more fun with it (and a quicker pace would have helped), but I guess that was the director's vision.",1491955200,,287,4.314814814814815

7981674,5,B00008DDRQ,"Tartuffe, written by the 17th-century playwright Moliere who lived under the patronage of King Louis XIV, is as relevant today as it was in the 1600's. After its premiere in 1664, it was attacked by French Catholic fanatics who interpreted the play as a criticism against the Roman Catholic Church, which was already reeling from the Protestant Reformation during the 16th century. Louis XIV and the general French public admired it, but the king did, for a time, suppress the play because of pressure from these aristocratic Catholics. However, despite the censorship, Tartuffe has become a standard in the theatrical repertoire and regarded as a masterpiece of political and religious commentary, as daring as any of the plays by William Shakespeare.

Ironically, Tartuffe does not propagate against religious belief and/or practice, but it does put into question religious fanaticism and blind loyalty, hence its relevance today as 350 years ago. Briefly, the story concerns a wealthy lord named Orgon who has taken into his house a kind of ascetic wanderer named Tartuffe. Tartuffe preaches religious piety and gratitude daily to Orgon, who has become enthralled and rather mesmerized by this man who was homeless before the lord of the house opened his doors to him. When anyone questions Tartuffe's motives, Orgon is the first to defend the man he regards as his spiritual adviser. But as the play unfolds, we learn that Tartuffe has ulterior motives that cast a shadow of doubt upon his supposedly religious humility, pious wisdom, and unselfish devotion. Despite its rather serious subject, humor permeates all through Tartuffe rendering it a masterful theatrical blend of comedy and drama from start to finish. In other words, there is never a dull moment until the climax when all is revealed.

The TV-movie in question, which has the look and feel of a 17th-century play rather than a movie, is an excellent English-language rendition of probably Moliere's most famous play. Of course, the standout is Donald Moffat as Tartuffe who gives a tour-de-force performance as the wily and unpredictable Tartuffe, who can discourse himself out of almost any situation. The rest of the cast is equally superb, with a very subtle and interesting performance by Tammy Grimes as Orgon's wife Elmire who begins to see through Tartuffe's charade. And look for the very young Victor Garber (of Godspell and Titanic fame) as the young suitor Valere. All around a breath of fresh air, considering the cookie-cutter output of most of Hollywood today. The film would also make terrific viewing followed by discussion for young people.",1431734400,,2626,5.161971830985915
7981675,3,B00008DDRQ,"I'm giving this three stars since:
(1) I just bought it,
(2) I was undecided about buying it based on the reviews I see here,
(3) I am disappointed at the lack of a good English language version (or even a subtitled French version) is not available
(4) I bought a couple of French copies of this, but they have no subtitles.

I will come back and revise this after watching the video.

Fortunately, I am bilingual and can watch this in the original French, but tant pis there are more than a few of the people I love who I wish I could share this with.  At one time, there was the version with Gerard Depardieu available on VHS and Laserdisk, but that did not make the cut to DVD/bluRay.  As I said, there are more than enough versions from France, but they are in French. I don't even see copies of this in either English translation or with subtitles in the UK, despite the praises of the 1984 RSC Version I see in the other reviews.

There is the FW Murnau version, but that is incredibly old and it is a silent movie as well.

More the shame since the RSC version is on youtube.  Yes, the video quality is lacking, but it is an English language version. I was unimpressed with that version due to the poor video quality. Not to mention no one in the arts community gains from its free distribution (nor will there be much incentive to produce a quality version).

Moliere is to French what Shakespeare is to English. I would say this is his most accessible play.  Given those facts, it is a shame that this is not produced in a quality production for Anglophones to appreciate.  I may bought a used copy despite the reviews just to see the quality of the performance. Not to mention I hope purchasing the only English language copy will spur demand.",1427068800,,1753,4.3496932515337425
7981676,4,B00008DDRQ,"This production, based on the Richard Wilbur translation, may not be to everyone's taste. However, see no need to denigrate it as other some reviewers have done.  I have seen on youtube the 1983 BBC adaptation reviewers highly recommend  in place of the Broadway Theatre archive DVD .  The BBC version is worth seeing. It has an excellent cast, and it's always a treat to watch Nigel Hawthorne.  But there are two problems with it:  first, the text has been heavily cut; second, the translation is in blank verse, not in alexandrines with rhymed couplets.  So the BBC version has skeletal version of the plot with some stage business thrown.  Some people obviously prefer a loose translation.  That's fine with me.  But if you want to get a close English translation in order to measure any given performance against, I strongly recommend Maya Slater's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Misanthrope-Tartuffe-and-Other-Plays-Oxford-World-s-Classics/dp/0199540187/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Misanthrope, Tartuffe, and Other Plays (Oxford World's Classics)</a>&nbsp;(2007).  Slater's inventive, nuanced translation, her introduction, and her notes are all worth their weight in gold.  I suggest viewers and readers consult as many translations, Wilbur's among them, and performances as possible.  No need to skip any and confine yourself to just one.  And many are free on youtube, some in French.  The video quality of the BBC production is poor unless you watch it on an iPhone or iPad.  Still, it is watchable even on a 60"" flatscreen TV.",1419811200,7,1587,5.693617021276595
