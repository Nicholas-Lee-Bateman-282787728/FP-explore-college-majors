1018677,4,6305318123,"""Cranky Bugs"" is a good Thomas video.  Our family has watched it dozens of times and we still find it entertaining. The animation appears more realistic than earlier Thomas videos and the stories are fun. The only  thing that bugs me about it is the narrator, Alec Baldwin.  This is his  first Thomas video and occasionally, he fails to distinguish the  characters' voices well enough to determine which one is speaking.  Although the kids didn't seem to notice, I found it a bit annoying until I  watched the video several times and became more familiar with the stories.  Nonetheless, it's a very useful video and would be a fine addition to your  Thomas the Tank Engine collection.",942105600,,684,4.777777777777778

1018730,5,6305318123,My oldest son LOVES Thomas & Friends and this was the movie he asked for at Christmas.  He absolutely loves this movie.  I think it is pretty short but it doesn't bother him at all!,1200096000,,181,4.142857142857143
1018731,1,6305318123,"We ordered this DVD for our son after borrowing the same version on VHS from a friend.  My son loved the ""Night Train"" song so much that we ordered this DVD for the song alone.  However, the ""Night Train"" is not on the DVD version, which makes absolutely no sense that the DVD and VHS versions would not contain the same stories (and the ""Night Train"" was listed as the last story on the VHS).  We now have endless requests for the song and will now have to order the VHS.  This DVD was a ripoff.  Just order the VHS and save your money.",1142553600,,537,4.125
1018732,5,6305318123,"Cranky Bugs, along with Make Someone Happy, is one of my favorite Thomas video. The stories on here are hilarious. Especially in Lady Hatt's Birthday Party. In that one we get to see Sir Topham Hatt like we've never seen him before. This is also a very important Thomas video because it was the first one that Alec Baldwin narrated. I think that Alec Baldwin is one of the better storytellers because he was creative with the voices. James and Gordon were the only trains that he made sound bad, but in the later ones, he changes their voices back to normal. Here are the story stops:

Cranky Bugs 5/5:
Meet Cranky, the rude and cranky crane, hence his name. He starts bossing Percy and Thomas around at the docks. This soon causes confusion and delay and Sir Topham Hatt thinks that Thomas and Percy are to blame. But when a huge storm comes and knocks Cranky over, he ends up confessing that he caused all the confusion and delay.

Lady Hatt's Birthday Party 5/5:
It is Lady Hatt's birthday and Sir Topham Hatt must not be late to her party. But his car breaks down and that causes him to run a little late. Then he falls in a ditch. Sir Topham Hatt's nice suit is soiled and he has no source of transportation, will he be able to get to his wive's birthday party?

Double Teething Troubles 4/5:
Sir Topham Hatt gets a new diesel to help Bill and Ben at the quarry. But the new diesel has teething troubles because he is new and nervous. This causes some trouble for Bill and Ben.

Thomas, Percy And Old Slow Coach 5/5:
Thomas and Percy find an old coach at the scrapyard named Old Slow Coach. She is going to be broken up pretty soon because she is old and slow. Thomas and Percy want more than anything to help her but they can't figure out how. Meanwhile, there is a fire at the workman's hut. Their hut is destroyed and they don't have a home anymore, but there is an ideal home for them that they don't know about yet.

Busy Going Backwards 5/5:
Toad, Oliver's faithful breakvan companion, wishes that he could go foreward for a change, instead of going backwards all the time. The freight cars get mad at Toad because they think that he has no right to complain because he lucky enough to be able to look after them. So the freight cars come up with a plan that will teach Toad a lesson and make his wish of going foreward finally come true.

A Better View For Gordon 6/5:
Gordon is boasting again about  being the finest engine in the world. One day, he is sent to test out the new station. When he gets there, he is disappointed with the view. He thinks he should have a panoramic view, where he can see people and people can see him. He soon gets his view, but in an unexpected way.

""Night Train""(Music Video) 4.5/5
A slower music video that is mostly about Henry and The Flying Kipper.

Again, Cranky Bugs is a great Thomas video and Alec Baldwin did great in this one. If you don't already have this one, buy it today.",1099958400,19,2932,4.316363636363636
1018777,4,6305318123,I usually critize Alec Bladwin in almost all of my Thomas reviews but I think Cranky was a good addition to the cast Derek who I don't think is ever going to be in another episode. Toad was good in this one but similar chases have occured already like in A close shave for Duck and later on in Spills chills and other Thomas thrills. I've always liked Toad and Oliver and I have like all of their stories. Old Slow Coach was good and she was in another episode. Night Train is the best song in the series. My problem with Thomas is they keep releasing new characters without using the old ones. Daisy has had three episodes total. BoCo doesn't have much either. This tape does mark a change in Thomas but I hear Alec Baldwin got fired. Of course we have to wait another month to see if the new guy is any better. This tape also introduces the new station but I don't think the other big station is still around I haven't seen it in any other recent tape. Overall this tape was good and your kids will probabaly like it.,1076803200,4,1019,4.204081632653061
1018778,3,6305318123,"I like Alec Baldwin and I like George Carlin. But i think the three best Thomas tapes are Thomas Breakes the Rules, Better Late than never, and my absolute favorite Tenders and Turntables.
This tape was the first of Alec Baldwin's and the tapes sort of changed then. He's a good narrator but they've changed Thomas isn't the same anymore. I would recommend the early tapes instead. And why did they redo the Ringo Starr ones.",1065916800,2,425,4.605263157894737
1018779,3,6305318123,"my son likes to watch this video, but not as much as the others. alec baldwin's voice is annoying and his james role is obnoxious. the character cranky is not the best; the way the diesel is treated by the other engines for being the new guy is not the greatest either. the toad story is nice, but lady hatt's birthday is certainly not the best--more negative female roles (caroline doesn't want to work or drive fast; lady hatt is really shallow). there are better videos out there, such as ""make someone happy"" (if you don't mind baldwin's characterization of james) or maybe ""the best of percy.""",1053734400,2,598,4.598130841121495
1018780,3,6305318123,"Thomas & his friends like to get the job done, but Cranky, a new
crane, thinks it's fun to call Thomas & Percy little bugs.  Cranky laughs until a storm knocks him over & Thomas & Percy have to rescue him. This video is a must own to your collecion!
The stories on the tape are very good. The songs are good too.
I quite like the one where Toad the brakevan goes a little too
far when he goes forwards for a change. The one about the new
diesel gets teething troubles is good too. I hope you enjoy it!",1049328000,,501,3.9603960396039604
1018781,5,6305318123,"my son, jack, 2 1/2, loves loves loves all of the thomas and friends movies.  as a family we highly recommend any and all of the movies.  they teach patience, understanding, cooperation, and many other valuable lessons.  my husband loves the narrations by george carlin and i especially love alec baldwin's female impersonations.  pick one or all of them up today, you'll be glad that you did!!!",1026259200,,395,4.850746268656716
1018782,5,6305318123,"This tape was our first exposure to the Thomas series and quickly became a favorite of our collection.  Remarkably, after watching it 500+ times, I can still sit through it and find that I enjoy it!  I attribute it to Alec  Baldwin's wonderful narraration.  He puts great effort into giving each of  the characters their own personality. The older tapes seem monotonous in  comparison. I look forward to getting the next tape he works on!",944524800,9,438,4.773333333333333

It's got 6 great episodes narrated by Alec Baldwin and a good song called ""Night Train"". However, the DVD version of this release isn't that good as you can't skip the preview to get to the menu quickly and the DVD version doesn't have the Night Train song but instead 2 different ones. For that, I would recommend the VHS version over the DVD.",1509667200,,450,4.433734939759036
