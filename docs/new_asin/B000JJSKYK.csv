8151330,2,B000JJSKYK,"The three brothers are genuine artists at their trade. Since the album is in Spanish, many people may not experience the full flavor of the lyrics. All in all, the album is very good. As far as melody is concerned, they do it all. It's easy to listen to and visualize. I recommend this album to Latin music lovers.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Los-Tres-Reyes-en-Concierto/dp/B000JJSKYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Los Tres Reyes en Concierto</a>",1234396800,,484,6.348484848484849
8151331,4,B000JJSKYK,"A real delight! The music is so sweet and beautifull it will wet your eyes. The 'Tres Reyes' prove that they have been and still are one of the worlds best 'Trio's'. They give a hack of a performance which is highlighted by their full three voice harmony singing. The 'Requinto' (spanish guitar tuned differently for solos) player makes you shiver whith his blazing speed, precision and superb technique. I was very impressed by the 'Los Panchos Medely' lyrics. The DTS audio is very good and video quality is superb. A little more inclusion of the audience by the art director would have made it even more interesting but even so I think it's one of the best Latin Music productions of the year.",1198886400,2,696,4.620967741935484
8151332,5,B000JJSKYK,"i wish this would have been a 1950's concert but this is still great.

the singer they have is almost an aviles imitator.

the concert is only about an hour or more. they played a good selection of songs but i wanted to hear enganada.

gilberto plays his guitar great still but his hands do shake a bit.

his soloing in odiame could be cleaner but was ok.

if your a fan, you need this in your collection.",1170460800,4,405,4.141025641025641
8151333,5,B000JJSKYK,"I've been waiting 31 years to watch Gilberto Puente play the solo's featured on these songs that I've listened to all of my life.

My dad told me that he had the honor of helping one of them carry a guitar into the venue they were playing at one night in Guatemala. Ever since then I always wished I could see them in full motion as he once did, instead of being limited to audio & the images on the record sleeves.

I've always imagined Gilberto fingering the frets, always wondered what picking style he used. Always wondered if it was studio tricks, if they sped up the tape.

I've had a never ending amount of time to wonder.

It is incredibly fulfilling to finally witness the technical marvel that his playing really is. He has such a clean playing style, is blazingly fast & does it with absolute ease. I started tearing up just watching this.

I am so thankful that this has finally been documented. It is such an important part of musical history that I feel is getting lost between the cracks of the spanish music of today, which sounds more like circus music, than the intricately textured, longingly beautiful lullabies of Los Tres Reyes.

Although I was born around 18 years after they released their first record, for what it's worth, I feel it is a wonderfully fulfilling representation of who I remember them to be.

One thing I was expecting was that the songs would be variations of what they once were & not live replica's of what was recorded so many years ago. Thankfully, the songs have been kept true to form, with a sprinkle of tasteful improvisation here and there.

I urge you to buy this. Not only because it would make a wonderful addition to your DVD collection, but because music like this needs to continue to be passed on so it can live on forever.",1169596800,13,1780,4.472222222222222
