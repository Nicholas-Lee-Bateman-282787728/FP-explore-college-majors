3920628,5,B002EZLO72,"I have had this video on VHS for several years and it was my favorite.  Then it quit working . . . oh no, I need to get it on DVD.  So I purchased it from Amazon and once again I can enjoy this delightful piece.  I especially like how the music and the pictures are timed together.  It's great!",1299110400,6,294,3.85
3920649,5,B002EZLO72,Super Nature movie,1428105600,,18,5.333333333333333
3920650,5,B002EZLO72,My mother bought this from Reader's Digest years ago for my children on VHS.  So happy to find this on DVD to share with my grown children and now grandchildren.,1427068800,,161,4.366666666666666
3920651,5,B002EZLO72,"I purchased this on VHS, as the Wildlife Symphony back in the 90's. I am thrilled to see this collection on DVD! It is not HD but I don't care! The music and pictures set a great ambience! Thank you!",1423958400,,199,4.0
3920652,5,B002EZLO72,JUST WONDERFUL .  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.,1414108800,,50,4.555555555555555
3920653,2,B002EZLO72,Poor product.  Looks like someone made a bad copy and put it on Amazon for sale,1413504000,,79,3.9375
3920654,1,B002EZLO72,"Terrible picture quality..grainy, definitely was not recorded in high definition. Looks like this one will go into a white elephant gift exchange stash or garage sale.",1407801600,,167,5.461538461538462
3920655,1,B002EZLO72,The scenes change every two seconds and it is a busy DVD which left me feeling anxious.  Beautiful photos but change so quick that the viewer is unable to take everything in before the scene changes again.  I really enjoyed the other DVDs I purchased that only changed scenes every 10 to 60 seconds.  Save your money on this one.,1400371200,5,329,4.45
3920656,4,B002EZLO72,"I originally got this on VHS tape.  I loved it for years, then it got lost in the back of my cabinet.  I am transferring my tapes to DVD but decided to buy this new on DVD.  I still like the video but, sadly, the DVD edition is starting to show its age.  The video is really grainy in places on my modern monitor and it is not wide screen like modern tapes.  I wish they had done better doing the DVD edition. I still like it though.",1395705600,,433,3.875
3920657,3,B002EZLO72,"I got this DVD because I wanted something soothing to help me fall asleep. Fat chance! While the scenery was beautiful, much of the music was far from relaxing. One song would be soothing, but the next would be loud, thundering, or suspenseful sounding music that made me feel anxious and wakeful. At least every other song was that way. So...if you're looking for a film to provide some sort of aesthetic background to provide atmosphere, this may be the thing for you. However, if you want something calm and soothing to help you relax, I would NOT recommend this DVD.",1392595200,6,570,4.653465346534653
3920658,5,B002EZLO72,"This is incredibly beautiful! The music fits the scenery perfectly! It's great for relaxation.  Lovely scenery, gorgeous music!  I love it.",1384473600,,139,5.571428571428571
3920659,5,B002EZLO72,"A very soothing tape to watch or just to listen to.  It came on time, and in good condition.  Lots of breath-taking photography.",1377993600,,128,4.521739130434782
3920660,2,B002EZLO72,If you are looking for something relaxing this is not it in my opinion. It's too fast moving. The quality is not the best but then I was watching it on my laptop. So it may be better on a regular TV screen.,1377734400,3,206,3.813953488372093
3920661,5,B002EZLO72,I really like the pictures on this DVD.  We recognize some from Yosemite and Yellowstone National Parks.  Good choice of classical music to accompany the nature video. I found it relaxing to watch.,1376784000,,197,4.9393939393939394
3920662,5,B002EZLO72,Absolutely love music and nature.  I'm a music teacher always looking for ways to introduce my students to classical music.,1376179200,,123,5.15
3920663,3,B002EZLO72,I was expecting something much grander. This was an amateur level production. I will probably give this away next xmas as a stocking stuffer.,1373673600,,141,4.916666666666667
3920664,5,B002EZLO72,"I chose this as a gift for a friend in the hospital with lukemia.  It's a very good program, beautiful scenes and great music.",1361404800,,126,4.25
3920665,5,B002EZLO72,"It is awe inspiring.  Great photography.  Composition of music with wild life is just amazing, at times funny. I would like to buy all of this series.
Would recommend greatly to lovers of nature and beautiful music.",1345075200,7,215,4.783783783783784
3920666,5,B002EZLO72,"I purchased this for my mother, who was laid up for many months in a rehab facility following an auto accident.  She absolutely loves it!  Restful, classical music combined with gorgeous scenes from nature - it helped in her healing process.  There is also an added educational feature (user can turn on or off) where one can answer 'quiz' type questions about national park monuments and geography.

I have since purchased all of the Reader's Digest offerings in this genre (Wildlife Symphony, Climb Every Mountain, etc.) and we like all of them!",1320451200,13,547,4.913043478260869
3920667,5,B002EZLO72,"Yes, this DVD was exactly as described AND MORE!

It captivates the wonder, simplicity and grandeur of Nature and shows adventures of animals in their daily surroundings... succincts phrases of serenade & concerto etc with certain facets of nature...depicts beauty of sunsets here & there. A facinating experience of Music embracing Nature_ I loved this Work of Art! The chipmonks are gorgeous and flowers delightful!

I would love to show this DVD to all my friends and family, I was so taken with it's beauty and light-heartedness...I laughed and sighed on occasions and played it again, the following day. ENJOY!!!",1318291200,17,617,5.16

8368548,5,B002EZLO72,A most wonderful music video. The alignment of music and the natural scenes was magnificent. About the best I have ever scene.,1481500800,,126,4.7727272727272725
8368549,4,B002EZLO72,"Beautiful photography but my only comment would be the amount of water, wonderful to watch but more animals would have enhanced  this DVD. The music was great and fitted well with the scenery.",1472083200,,192,4.818181818181818
8368550,1,B002EZLO72,"BEWARE: DVD arrived covered in odd TOXIC, white powdery dust, burned our hands and eyes. Ouch !!  DVD is fast paced with Classical fast tempo music driving quick bursts of scenery, not a slow paced relaxing video.. But",1456617600,,218,4.7368421052631575
8368551,5,B002EZLO72,Well worth the money.,1452124800,,21,4.5

8368555,5,B002EZLO72,"This is an excellent product--countless beautiful pictures for 60 minutes, with calm, quiet symphony music. Item: QD8113;
ISBN: 978-1-59464-459-7 As near as I can tell, it is identical to the ""older"" Reader's Digest, Nature's Symphony, showing a waterfalls on a darker jacket, Item: QD752; ISBN: 1-56855-902-X. This item is less expensive than the older one. Music is not the least bit annoying or boring. There is no looping feature.",1439510400,,434,5.304347826086956
