3495166,4,B001BN4WHM,"I like this show because it has lots of music colors and sounds, plus my very young child can now sing the songs and he loves it. The story is a long for very young kids, but mine still likes it for the amount of time he can actually stay focused.",1356825600,2,247,3.8627450980392157
3495167,5,B001BN4WHM,"The Wonder Pets version of the Nutcracker really is quite brilliant.  My daughter is just past two and last xmas she saw this flick many times.  We also had the full music for the nutcracker on alot and they worked well together.  Then we had to depend on 'On Demand' but now I'm very glad to have the hard copy.  I'm a teacher and composer - and believe The Wonder Pets shows to be one of the best kid shows - actually the only one we watch at present.  They have continuous music, like little operas... the constant singing is good for kids, my Sofia sings the main song on her own now.  All kid shows can get annoying at some point! But I highly recommend this one.  Play the wonder pets nutcracker and then let play one of the real ballet versions on the tv... they'll make the connection!",1334188800,,793,4.246666666666667

3495169,5,B001BN4WHM,"I cannot tell you how many times my children have watched this dvd since I bought it for my son (2) this Christmas. His sisters, 4 and 6, love it equally as much as he does and I'm sure if I let them they would watch it every day multiple times each day. Very sweet and catchy - I will buy more Wonder Pets - cute stories, good message and so nice to find something all 3 of my kids ADORE.",1231804800,3,389,3.814814814814815
3495170,5,B001BN4WHM,"Not only has this become my granddaughter's (almost 3) new favorite DVD, but it is also mine.  There are funny and adorable subtilities which an adult ""gets""...perhaps the child does, or not...but it is high quality entertainment, a good introduction to the music of The Nutcracker, and, as usual, full of excellent morals and lessons without being preachy.  I LOVE THE WONDER PETS!",1229990400,8,382,5.0476190476190474
3495171,5,B001BN4WHM,My 11 month old absolutely loves the Wonder Pets. When I pop in the dvd she sits up & starts clapping her hands.

3495172,4,B001BN4WHM,"If you kid hasn't tired of the Wonder Pets and their rescuing animals antics, they will like this DVD.  But, if they're big fans of The Nutcracker, like my almost 4 year old daughter is, they will really love this DVD.",1227916800,5,218,4.317073170731708
3495173,5,B001BN4WHM,"If you are considering getting a Wonder Pets DVD, this is the one to get.  Besides the magical Nutcracker episode, it also has some of the best Wonder Pets episodes ever created: The Adventures of Bee and Slug, and the Pangaroo.
The Wonder Pets Save the Bengal Tiger (on a different DVD) is also an excellent episode.",1226188800,12,317,4.56140350877193
