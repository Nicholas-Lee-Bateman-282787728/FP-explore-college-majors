3803605,5,B001URA5XY,"This is an amazing little gem of a movie...

It captures the essence of trying to fit in and failing... and then over coming in spite of that failure.

It also captures the stupidity and insipidity of certain creatures that live in the ""real"" world vs those that live in fantasy.

Its a wonderful little movie... and I will look for more from this director, who also wrote the screen play.",1247011200,,389,4.450704225352113
3803606,2,B001URA5XY,"This was an ok film - but I was SO aware of the 'acting' going on that it wasn't believable for me. I thought Bill Pullman, although he didn't have many scenes, the most believable. Elle Fanning . . . in my mind I kept seeing the director say, ""now ACTION"".She got on my nerves with her 'so perfect' diction and wide-eyed wonder at everything. And Felicity Huffman, I guess if she changes her hair color it makes her a better actor - but not here. Patricia Clarkson's character was just plain silly. I felt like I so wasted my time watching this movie.",1246665600,,552,4.3173076923076925
3803607,5,B001URA5XY,I agree with the other reviewers that this is a brilliant movie and especially Ella Fanning's ability to handle the part very convincingly as has her sister Dakota has done in her roles-- talent seems to run in the family. I will however disagree that Phoebe had OCD -- I am not a psychiatrist and don't think much of psychiatrists. Instead I feel the whole country of adults are obsessed with a compulsion to not listen to children going back to the ageist chauvinistic philosophy that children should be seen and not heard. This observation is not without merit as I noticed the theatrical version doesn't even list Ella Fanning as one of the actors. Possibly another rating is needed. We have PG (parental guidance) and could use a rating CG (child guidance).,1246579200,,762,4.7368421052631575
3803608,4,B001URA5XY,"This is an odd tale of a young girl who turns out to have several OCDs that cause her problems at home and especially at school.  Elle Fanning does a fantastic job as Phoebe, who doesn't know why she does these things and wants to stop.  Her sister is adorably outspoken, and the kids in the movie are more fun to watch than any of the adults.

Campbell Scott is oddly cast as the principal, while Patricia Clarkson gives her usual strong performance as a drama teacher who is eccentric yet caring.  Felicity Huffman and Bill Paxton play some rather strange parents who seem to live a life of the mind as writers but also have a nice house and apparently a nice chunk of income too.

There are also some interesting visual effects that occur when Phoebe imagines herself interacting with the characters from Wonderland.

Worth watching for young Fanning's talent.",1246147200,5,863,4.644736842105263
3803609,5,B001URA5XY,"By now, you know this is not another rendition of Alice or some x-rated story. However no review can come near to preparing you for what you are about to watch.

An intelligent young girl is facing people that force structure in everyday life on her and seem to have an unreasonable in for her.  Her mother defends the daughter's actions, as children will be children. Phoebe seems to do best when she is concentrating on a school play of Alice in Wonderland. Yes, the film centers on Phoebe but looking at the story and you will see that most of the major characters from the family, to the school, to others each carries their own emotional baggage and not just through Phoebe's eyes. How each person deals with Phoebes' onset of OCD; will they recognize it?

More important is how would we react as any of the charters in this drama?",1246060800,,836,4.4868421052631575
3803610,5,B001URA5XY,"Wow. I put this on at 2 am thinking it was a kids movie that I could watch as I drifted to sleep. I was very wrong. Instead, it's a complex, deep, insightful masterpiece that made me cry two or three times.

Don't be fooled by the cover. This is not a movie for children. The story focuses on a free-willed family with writer/scholar parents, and very bright young daughters. The lightheartedness slowly gives way to a deep heartfelt story of a young girl developing OCD and Tourettes while just trying to keep her lead in the school play of Alice in Wonderland. Her drama teacher, played by Patricia Clarkson, is a quiet, Nanny McPhee-type who is able to connect to Phoebe a little bit better than everyone else. I almost got annoyed with that, since it is rather cliche, but it's really Phoebe's mom (the brilliant Felicity Huffman) who connects with Phoebe the most. You'll laugh one moment and cry the next as you take this journey with such an endearing and interesting family. Phoebe befriends a young boy named Jamie who has a lot more theater experience than she does, and wants nothing more than to play not the White Knight, nor the King of Hearts, but rather the Queen of Hearts. This decision leads the other children to call him ""homo"" and ""faggot"", which results in the usually wisely reserved Miss Dodger (Clarkson) showing the only anger she shows in the film when she confronts them and challenges their mimicry. Maybe I am mistaken...maybe some older children should be exposed to this film. Not only will they learn how to imagine, but they will also learn how to tolerate differences, and to love a person for who he or she is, despite wanting to go against gender roles and play the Queen of Hearts, or having to wash her hands a certain number of times.

If I am not mistaken, this is Elle Fannings first lead role, and man does she do an amazing job. She's already begun to surpass her sister when it comes to acting chops. I can't wait to see where she goes.",1245801600,30,1982,4.518105849582173
3803611,4,B001URA5XY,"The hype of this film prior to me even getting it in the store was higher than I had anticipated and I am actually having to order twice as many now. After playing it for screening audiences, word of mouth is making the demand even greater.

The Amazon editorial delves plenty deep into all of the characteristics and relationships being played in this film and to what adequacy the acting appeared. I was thoroughly impressed with how everyone filled their roles to where both kids and adults would get something out of this. The visuals of fantasy and reality blurring together were done believably, and the resulting outlooks left with the viewer about adults in a kids world were moving and well written.

Pullman was useless in the film as a father, but he played it perfect, as did Huffman in another obscure mother character role. Fanning proves she has a bright future with how she convinced both kids and adults what she was feeling and seeing in both worlds. The quality of the picture was adequate, and would be a solid case for HD with all of the colors used. The 5.1 gets used more often than one would think for a dialogue and fantasy film, but they stopped short with no special features of any kind.

The two cover art DVDs are exactly the same except for the picture, no content or feature differences (both 100 minutes). For parents that are wondering about the rating, the PG13 does exist due to several gay themed words being used and a couple cuss words. Hope you enjoy.",1245456000,9,1491,4.5767790262172285
3803622,4,B001URA5XY,"When it's good, it's terrific, including an amazing performance by a very young Elle Fanning as a mentally troubled 8 year old, and good work by Felicity Huffman, and the always wonderful Patricia Clarkson.

On the other hand, the very talented Campbell Scott is stuck playing a character that's one note joke, and the tone of the film is all over the place; odd quirky comedy one moment, a child contemplating suicide the next.

But the real problems are when the film's Lifetime network roots show through, and suddenly there's that warm, fuzzy, phony feeling that being a kid with severe emotional problems isn't all that bad, and everything will be just fine. It undermines the film's valiant attempts to really get inside a
struggling kid's head.

None-the-less, in a world of cookie-cutter filmmaking, the film gets real points for trying, and about 80% of the time, this is a very good, and very original film.",1447804800,,917,4.865384615384615

As a grandmother of a little girl with Tourette Syndrome, this movie takes you through all the stages of  grief from denial that anything is wrong with Phoebe other than her exercising her uniqueness,and  finally to acceptance...accepting Phoebe for the unique child she, in fact, IS, and the disorder that holds her captive.",1394928000,,354,5.086206896551724

It is one of the more artistic movies I've seen in a whole year or two. It is enchanting in a most real way. The characters are unique and endearing and the actors each give very moving performances, especially Patricia Clark as Miss Dodger, the drama teacher. Her performance alone is worth watching the movie for. However, Elle Fanning is brilliant in this role and, I believe, surpasses her sister in her ability to act, at least in this performance. The one thing I told people after watching this was that Miss Dodger would go down in my book of memorable characters with the likes of Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow and Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan.

3803640,2,B001URA5XY,"It was easier for Phoebe and Alice to get into Wonderland than it was for me to get into this movie.  I should have known better since I never liked Alice in Wonderland, and while drugs were not an option for me, Alice's escapades served as my version of a bad LSD trip.  But since I thought the storyline focused more on a little girl's battle with Tourette syndrome than this Lewis Carroll tale, I approached it with interest.

In spite of the extraordinary talent displayed by young Elle Fanning, her character was overshadowed by the peculiarities of other cast members.  Her school was run by an incompetent principal who was successful only in providing comic relief.  Her family consisted of a precocious sister, a concerned but ineffective father, and a loving but controlling mother who was coincidently writing a book about Wonderland.  But Phoebe was most drawn to a courageous little boy who didn't care if his classmates thought he was gay and an unconventional drama teacher who appeared to have come straight from Alice's famous tea party.  While their stories weren't fully explored, compared to these two, Phoebe was somewhat less than remarkable.

Equally overshadowed was the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome.  It was often masked by symptoms of an obsessive-compulsive disorder and self-mutilation.  And in view of Phoebe's vision of Wonderland characters, one could make an argument for borderline psychosis as well.  Even uncontrollable speech, the most obvious symptom of Tourette's, took on a subtle effect.  With the exception of a few brief and sudden moments, Phoebe's outbursts were repetitive comments originally uttered by elders, and they appeared to be nothing more than the usual antics of disrespectful and mocking children.  And what child wouldn't want to spit at disruptive classmates who were taunting her?

Surprisingly it was the diagnosis of Tourette's itself that proved therapeutic for Phoebe.  While her mother rejected that diagnosis for years, Phoebe sought refuge in the label that would define her.  She was still an enigma to her peers, but they now looked at her somewhat in awe as she explained her affliction.

But this movie was neither a childhood fantasy nor a fictional account of a family dealing with Tourette's.  It was more about a student and teacher making a connection to each other and to something that perhaps lies within the looking glass.

If you are into psychology or are an Alice fanatic, this movie might catch your interest.  For everyone else, it's hardly worth the adventure - unless you too are writing a book on Wonderland.",1287360000,3,2598,5.053990610328638
3803641,4,B001URA5XY,"Back in 1998, Kate Beckinsale played the title character in a modern adaptation of Lewis Carroll's ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"". The adult Beckinsale went into the reverse world behind the looking glass in a confusingly marketed children's film that many potential viewers believed was for mature audiences.

  Ten years later ""Phoebe In Wonderland"" provides another visit to the looking glass world. The title character is played by a child (Elle Fanning) and thanks to more confusing marketing, this time potential viewers think that it is a children's movie. I've even seen the DVD of this PG-13 film proudly on display in the children's sections of video rental stores.

  It's not a children's film although there are sequences in the film that would appeal to many children. It is a strange blend of ""Girl, Interrupted"" and Jena Malone's 1997 film ""Hope""; with the same thematic structure as ""The Dust Factory"". Writer/Director Daniel Barnz has crafted a puzzling little film that seems to have a lot to say but doesn't do a very clear job of saying it. I suspect that much of the story is autobiographical. The story is told from the point of view of the title character and Barnz does an excellent job of acting for the camera direction with all members of his film's strong cast. Which means that the confusion seems to lie not in the execution but in the construction. Branz apparently intends the story to be more allegorical than real; with general themes about freedom, individualism, conformity, and expectations. The only clear message is the importance of having the courage to live life to the fullest, to not let fear or the need for acceptance keep you from letting go of security and ""jumping"" (like Alice jumping down the rabbit hole although technically that is a different story).

  The Tourett's Syndrome stuff is inserted as a literary device. Everyone spends much of their interaction time suppressing the impulse to ""spit"" out a few assorted truths and unkind comments. These things are better left unsaid and the task of leaving them unsaid is more difficult for those who tend to resist conformity and have the least need for the approval of others.

  Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1281484800,,2233,4.893899204244032
3803642,5,B001URA5XY,"I show this movie to my Middle School students every year. I do this, usually, after reading ""Alice"" and studying Lewis Carroll.

3803643,2,B001URA5XY,"I recently rented this movie, mostly due to my interest in the famous Lewis Carol's book. The movie is about a young girl struggling with a psychological disorder while she becomes involved with a school play. I found the acting to be mediocre at best and the script to be unrealistic. Many of the children don't behave as you expect children to behave. The mother and father are overly-emotional (especially the mother) and don't even get me started about the drama teacher, yikes. The principal and the psychiatrist provide some unintentional comedic relief, but not much. For those interested in Lewis Carol's book, there's not much for you here. For others, I do not recommend this one unless you like sappy movies.",1261958400,2,719,4.901639344262295
3803644,3,B001URA5XY,"This movie is very hard to rate. First off, the trailer I saw completely misrepresented this movie, making it seem like it was a cheerful, light-hearted movie about a young girl who is offbeat, imaginative, and misunderstood. Going into the movie with this expectation threw me off because the movie is not this at all, but it takes a while to reveal what it really is about. Meanwhile, I kept wondering when the lighthearted part was going to start. It is not lighthearted. It is a very serious movie about ...

BEGIN SPOILER

... a young girl, Phoebe, who is developing Tourrette syndrome with some associated OCD behavior. (As an aside, the Tourrette syndrome behavior pictured in this movie is pretty accurate.) She knows something is wrong but she just can't help saying and doing the things she is doing that are causing so much disruption in everyone's lives. Her mother is in denial about the severity of the problem and also blames herself for Phoebe's behavior, thinking she just hasn't been a ""good enough"" mother.

It doesn't help that Phoebe's been attending a school that is more about rigidity and mindlessly following the rules than it is about preserving the natural creativity all children have before they enter public school. A new drama teacher, played brilliantly by Patricia Clarkson, brings some wisdom into Phoebe's life, but ultimately there is no real happy ending. (There are hints that the teacher has a mild form of Tourrettes herself.) Phoebe has the disease, she isn't going to get better (though she might be able to manage her symptoms with medication), and that's that.

Also, Phoebe sees and talks with characters from Alice in Wonderland. That is never fully explained. Is it her imagination? Is it a different mental symptom? We never find out, though the movie seems to be leaning toward it being part of her Tourrette syndrome.

Some loose ends with her parents are left untied as well.

END SPOILER

BUT. The acting is incredible, especially from Elle Fanning. The writing and cinematography are excellent. The pacing is a bit uneven, but overall fine. The story itself is perhaps one that needs to be told. But the movie is sad. It is a drama. It has real people behaving in real ways, for the most part, and that is also on the plus side, but it was hard to watch all the way through because it became clear that Phoebe was a train wreck happening in front of our eyes and there was nothing that was going to happen to prevent that wreck. The only positive thing is that people finally acknowledge the train has wrecked and decide to cope with it.

So, overall, five stars for the acting and the script, one star for the misleading trailer, three stars for the pacing...it averages out to three stars total. maybe three and a half.

This is not a family film. I would not have young children watch this. Teenagers and above, yes. But be prepared to talk about it and to ask some of the questions that are only hinted at.",1260748800,12,2963,4.6826923076923075

Elle Fanning is phenomenally fine as Phoebe, the beautiful and strange ten year old. You will love her performance.

A small but unforgettable film in which Patricia Clarkson shines as the kind of teacher we all hope our kids will have, at least once. Instead of seeking to control, restrict or punish children, she allows them to fully expand and embrace their individuality as they grow, and come alive!",1255824000,3,550,4.49
3803646,5,B001URA5XY,"Elle Fanning (Dakota Fanning's Younger Sister) is the lead in this haunting and painfully beautiful film centered around Alice in Wonderland.  You may recognize Elle as a younger version of Dakota in ""I Am Sam"" and she was also the ""Future Granddaughter"" of Fern in Charlotte's Web opposite her sister. However, she definitely takes center stage all on her own in Phoebe in Wonderland.

Phoebe is a disturbed young girl who is ""different"" according to her mother. When she gets up enough courage to try out for the school play, she's cast as the lead in Alice in Wonderland.  Outside of the theater, Phoebe worries that she will ""be fired"" from the play unless she completes certain tasks such as counting the bricks in the sidewalk to her home and leaping up the stairs in odd sequences.  After her parents see her bruised hands from endless hand washing and bruised knees from falling on the stairs, they send her to see a child psychologist who thinks Phoebe might be OCD and wants to put her on medication.

However, Phoebe is completely different when she's in the theater and on stage rehearsing; she is happy and much like a normal everyday girl.  Yes, the other girls think she is still different.  She spits at them when they taunt her.  Phoebe becomes friends with a young boy named Jamie who is also a bit different, having tried out for the part of the Red Queen and won the role.  The children taunt him too and call him names for wanting to play a female role.  However, both of the ""special children"" are applauded by the whimsical and strange Ms. Dodger who is the theater teacher and encourages the children to ""do what they want.""

When Phoebe starts to interact with actual characters from the story, things start to get out of hand and Phoebe might get thrown out of the play.  Felicity Huffman and Bill Pullman do a decent job as Phoebe's parents struggling to want to understand what is troubling their daughter and making her act out.  Mom is also writing a book about Alice in Wonderland, but this storyline is not explored as much as I would have liked.  However, the connections between Mom and Daughter are there.  There is one scene where Phoebe is crying in bed and her Mom is holding her.  The pain the child is going through because she does not know why she is acting out will rip out your heart.

The film moves at a slow detailed and hypnotic pace ultimately leading to a few conflicts that you hope will not leave you feeling empty hearted and even more sad than Phoebe.  When both child and parents discover the true sickness that Phoebe suffers from, it is all wrapped up nicely in the end and few plotlines, if any, go unanswered.  This is a great film for both children and adults to share in order to teach children that it is okay to be different.  Bullying is also addressed, as well as the possiblity of a child being homosexual.

Throw in the world that is Alice and the White Rabbit, and you have a great film overall that left me pleasantally surprised.  I'll remember this one and be suggesting it to others for a long long time to come.",1253491200,3,3084,4.518918918918919

Finally it comes out in the movie that the mother can't stand the daughter who has a similar dislike and distrust for the mother. A typical non-functional family made worse by the mother's interference with the daughter's therapy sessions. The daughter is the real victim in this situation who is suffering from a genetic illness.

3803648,2,B001URA5XY,"In ""Phoebe in Wonderland,""  Phoebe Lichten (Elle Fanning) suffers from OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) and can't control what she says.  She feels like an outcast at school, surrounded by peers who don't understand her condition and teachers who are annoyed by her constant disruption.  Her mother, Hillary (Felicity Huffman), an aspiring author, goes head to head with a psychiatrist and school principal more concerned with medicating Phoebe so she'll conform to appropriate classroom behavior than with seriously attending to her issues.

A new drama teacher, Miss Dodger (Patricia Clarkson), is staging a production of ""Alice In Wonderland"" and, unlike other teachers, allows the kids to make suggestions, ask questions, and discover the theme of the play by themselves.  Inspired by this new teacher, Phoebe decides to audition for the role of Alice.

This is a so-so film that never really engages the viewer completely.  This probably explains its limited theatrical run.  Fanning, four years younger than her famous sister Dakota, brings empathy to the role of Phoebe and displays a mature understanding of the character and her frustrations.  Huffman plays a woman trying to finish an analytical book while maintaining a household and dealing with the demands of her daughter's condition.  Her frustration seethes just below a veneer of civility until it boils over at the stonewalling of narrow-thinking professionals.  Hillary's dark hair distances the character from Huffman's famous ""Desperate Housewives"" TV role.
Clarkson - a wonderful actress -- looks like a zombie in most of her scenes, displaying little dramatic range.  She's capable of much better work.

Clarkson's character, however, is interesting.  We've all encountered these ""rebels"" -- those who treat children as intelligent, thinking beings.  She sees in Phoebe a kindred spirit, and the bond that emerges seems real.  Jamie (Ian Colletti), another aspiring actor in the play, befriends Phoebe and brings his own costume to audition for the role of the Red Queen.
 Writer/director Daniel Barnz uses the theme of the misfit to tie the story together.  Aside from Miss Clarkson, performances are above average with young Elle Fanning anchoring the film.

The DVD contains no bonus extras.",1248307200,2,2270,5.415954415954416
3803649,5,B001URA5XY,"What is a child to do when she begins to realize that she is not like other children?  And that her 'different-ness' is taking a toll on her family and alienating her friends, classmates, teachers, and others?  In this lovely film by Daniel Barnz, the child ""Phoebe"" is beyond quirky, and she suffers not only from her own behavior but from the guilt she feels when her family members are affected by it.  Lost in a world that is confusing and often harsh, she has to find her way back to what others call ""normal.""

I am a huge fan of anything Patricia Clarkson has done in the last ten years, and in this film she plays the loving, oddball drama teacher, ""Miss Dodger.""  The movie is worth seeing simply for her performance, but added to that is the completely convincing way Elle Fanning plays Phoebe, making us truly believe that she is a child at wit's end.  Bravo to Miss Fanning and I hope we see much more of her.

I recommend not reading too many reviews as there is a 'reveal' in this film that other reviewers will feel compelled to give away.  If you are a very pragmatic, concrete personality, you may not be able to appreciate the scenes meant to show us the world through Phoebe's eyes, so this movie may not be to your liking, but anyone who understands and loves the 'different-ness' of all children will enjoy this film.",1247875200,5,1338,4.43265306122449
3803650,4,B001URA5XY,"While perusing for a video rental, the store manager literally insisted that I take, 'PHOEBE in WONDERLAND,' home for viewing. By surveying the DVD cover and synopsis, I was less than enthused, but I didn't want to hurt her feelings by sneaking it back on the shelf.  Boy, was I proven wrong!

This dark, family drama won the: Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award. I can certainly understand why, and recommend you keep tissues handy, because I suspect you will, too.  It is both heartwarming and heart-wrenching, as it delves into the gradual escalation of Phoebe's mental illness;  the dual diagnosis of OCD, with Tourette's Syndrome.  We begin to witness this 9 year old child, exhibiting objectionable behaviors and becoming an outcast; behaviors she doesn't understand and can't control.  She escapes her challenging reality into her favorite fantasy world---that of Carroll's, Alice in Wonderland.

Elle Fanning's portrayal of Phoebe, ranks as one of the best child performances, for her age group, that I have ever seen.  Such a young actor couldn't possibly understand the dynamics of such a serious mental illness, yet she brings the character to case-study, textbook perfection, with the added dimension of raw emotion.  If you don't viscerally experience her pain, you're stronger than I.  She was brilliant!

Meanwhile, Phoebe's parents are experiencing angst that would be expected when learning that your child isn't just 'brilliantly creative, and different,' but carrying a life-altering diagnosis.  Felicity Huffman provides a stellar performance moving between severe denial, into anger, followed by all-consuming guilt, as she faces she was not always the best mother with this difficult child.  Bill Pullman portrays the confused and loving father, who is more realistic in his assessment, but censured by those not ready to accept the truth.

Patricia Clarkson, is extraordinary as the teacher and mentor, who chooses Phoebe to portray a very integral role in the school play; one Phoebe has coveted.  As their relationship develops, Clarkson's ethereal, magical, and trusting guidance, begins to help Phoebe embrace some of her 'differences,' but not without pain and loss for both of them.

My only grievance is that the ending seemed to wrap up too quickly; it didn't take advantage of sharing more information about OCD and TS. It also wasn't made clear that Phoebe had a dual diagnosis of OCD and TS, which is not uncommon, but complicates the prognosis.  In fact, the very person who recommended this movie to me admitted she was confused about the extent of Phoebe's illness.

The primary focus of this film was on embracing individual differences; our uniqueness, regardless of obstacles in the way.  This is definitely a good philosophy to live by, but some rays of hope might have been nice, too.  There are treatments available that often provide some relief from the repetitive, intrusive thoughts, and ritualized behaviors. Also, that many brilliant minds have had very successful lives with TS. It is believed that Mozart was one of them. For families that might be dealing with a new onset of such an illness, I wouldn't want them to have false hope, but to realize that all symptoms and outcomes are not the same.",1247529600,4,3250,5.154285714285714
3803651,4,B001URA5XY,"I picked this up thinking it was a child's movie full of surprises and fun. I was wrong - this movie was much darker and more serious then anticipated.  It was still a very good movie, and my family enjoyed it even though it was not a lighthearted kids movie.

It becomes apparent early on that something isn't right with cute little Phoebe. She seems to have a great family and she lives in a great house where both her parents are writers. Her mother is turning her dissertation into a book on Wonderland and coincidentally, Phoebe auditions for the part of Alice at her school and gets the part. However, Phoebe does things such as wash her hands a certain number of times, or repeats people inappropriately. She has to walk on the squares in front of her house a certain number of times and things like that.

When she is practicing for the play she is fine, but when she worries or is at home she begins to do strange things that no one can figure out why. A doctor's diagnosis helps with things but it's not until a few dangerous occurances force Phoebe's mother to deal with the troubles her daughter has been having.

Phoebe also escapes into an Alice in Wonderland fantasy world at times in which the characters are kind of a distraction to her from reality.

The girl who plays Phoebe is great as are the other actors in the cast. This is a well made, good movie. If you are out for laughs, don't get this until you'd like material that is a little more serious and the PG 13 rating is for the content and serious nature of the movie not because they slip in a few bad words. It's a serious thoughtful movie.",1247443200,3,1618,4.344370860927152

8344734,2,B001URA5XY,"My wife, who works with autistic children, bought this video as a training tool.  I sat down to watch it with her, even though I'm a crotchety old geezer who can't stand watching TV programming for kids.  Luckily for me, we didn't get very deep into it before my wife came to the conclusion that it's not suitable for children.  Foul language doesn't bother me, personally - except when it's in the wrong company or when it's gratuitous.  And I think the language in this movie was gratuitously foul, and inappropriate for the intended audience.

As to whether or not it has any production value, I couldn't say.  As I said, I didn't see it in its entirety.",1471046400,,657,4.52542372881356

It does a nice job of explaining some of the habits that children with mental illness or special needs develop, as well as the need to give them a space somewhere in life where they feel they can be comfortable. Another focus of the films deals with the parents and how they may be unwilling to accept that their child is special needs or has a mental illness, thinking that they'll grow out of a quirky stage.",1447804800,,557,4.264150943396227
