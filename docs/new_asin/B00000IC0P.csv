8594888,4,B00000IC0P,"This may not be the last known interview of marley, but if you fast forward through the introduction, its an invaluable piece of footage recognizing the 'man behind the name'. to my knowledge, the last known marley interview was in november of 1980, it was a phone interview. a small excerpt of that can be heard in the Time Will Tell documentary.

i recommend this not because of the bad packaging and falty advertising, but because of the interview itself. any true Marley fan would want to have this as a part of his/her collection.",1108944000,,535,4.631578947368421
8594889,2,B00000IC0P,"As stated below by another review this video CAN NOT BE THE ACTUAL LAST INTERVIEW.  The interviewer in the video makes references to Marley's ""Latest album titled Survival""  Most reggae/Marley fans also know  that Marley spent a while in German hospitals while fighting cancer before  flown to Miami where he later died.  The interview takes place in Jamaica  which would have been before his 80/81 tour through the U.S.  Obviously  Marley DID interviews after this on only in the United States.  Maybe the  video is partially true as it MAY have been the last ""known  interview"" in Jamaica, but certainly not his Last interview ever.  The  video does have some good Q&A not only from Bob but from other band  members as well; however the video is definetly NOT worth the price listed  above...Sorry guys!",952646400,3,805,4.859259259259259
