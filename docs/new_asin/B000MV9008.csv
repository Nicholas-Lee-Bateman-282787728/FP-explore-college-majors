2750195,2,B000MV9008,"See the Original (over 100 chapter series) instead of buying this overly dense, tightly cropped cut and paste job of a DVD. Why is do I recommend the Original? Because key characters and parts of the story are missing and the DVD makes little to no sense as a result.",1408320000,2,267,4.36

2750197,3,B000MV9008,"Another Tai Seng re-edit from a joint HongKong Taiwan China and Singapore produced manga style sword and sorcery drama series.
Unlike other Tai Seng releases, the re-editing is pretty poor resulting in a rather incoherent and confusing film with unexplained plot changes.

Action choreography is good in parts but as this is a manga style sword and sorcery tv series one must expect some low budget special effects.

Still better than a 70s or 80s one dimensional old skool Hong Kong or Taiwan martial arts flick but if you want substance then wait with bated breath or petition Tai Seng to release the full 30 episode drama series with English Subs. I understand that the series garnered pretty good reviews in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia when first aired on local TV.",1324512000,,770,4.825757575757576

Realistic Supernatural martial arts film great fun

Great surreal Supernatural special effects martial arts film with so many intriguing different characters. At one point a lightsaber comes into play Golden Dragon Dagger to fight off a group of musicians who were using their music in an evil enchanting way. Also a character whose leg stretches out for many feet to attack and kick. Also there is swastikas in this film. Even if you look up in the Holocaust Museum information and explain that this goes back possibly twelve thousand years meaning good fortune? Not the perverted Nazi Symbol.",1497312000,,1002,7.333333333333333

Their Wuxia (similar to medieval heroes/swords and sorcery) comedy is something you can watch with your teens and everyone can enjoy. it is light and playful not the normal hardcore Chinese opera. Crazy weapons, mystical martial art styles and an easy to follow plot with a little twist make this a winner if you are looking for something fun to watch.",1467331200,,405,4.884057971014493
