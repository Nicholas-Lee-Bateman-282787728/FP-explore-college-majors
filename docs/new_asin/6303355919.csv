7844523,5,6303355919,"This movie is one of about 8 with a dog named Flame playing the part of Rusty.  It concerns a mysterious and unfriendly stranger that moves into the town and the really great part is that Rusty takes a instant liking to the man's pet german shepherd Barb.  The plot is pretty predictable but Flame is such a great dog - there is a wonderful segment with Danny ""training"" Rusty as a detective dog.  I would highly recommend this movie.

The downer about these movies is that they make you want to see more of Flame.  Unfortunately, this movie and ""Adventures of Rusty"" (the only one with Ace the Wonder Dog) and ""Rusty's Birthday"" are the only ones available.",1244332800,2,658,4.495798319327731
7844524,3,6303355919,"Columbia's ""Rusty"" series of the late 1940s were small-town dramas centering around Danny (Ted Donaldson, one of the better juvenile actors) and his German shepherd Rusty (a handsome animal). This entry has Danny and his pals encountering a mysterious, uncommunicative stranger in town, and running afoul of the man who owns the land where their clubhouse is. Youngsters will enjoy Rusty (and Rusty's girlfriend, Barb), but some of this plays like an instructional film; the morality-play script spreads the civics lesson mighty thick as the kids learn about good citizenship. The film is well made, like most Columbia's ""B"" pictures, and the print is gorgeous. A technical note: some copies of this title are in the extended-play mode and may not track properly on all machines.",970099200,4,779,5.190476190476191
