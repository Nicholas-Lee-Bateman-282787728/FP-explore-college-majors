7909095,5,B00000GOCK,"""Undercover"" is a good soft-core thriller starring the very sexy Athena Massey.  There are a few really good sex scenes in this tape.  But beware of the DVD, it's rated R, unlike the unrated VHS.  And the plot isn't too bad, actually.",992217600,6,234,4.523809523809524
7909096,4,B00000GOCK,"A welcome surprise! Although this makes no pretensions to be anything more than soft-core porn, there was enough attention to detail and funding to make a movie pleasant to watch, with some semblance of a plot and enough  characters and locales to make you pay attention even when there is no  flesh on-screen. Athena Massey is a wonder to behold, and when Meg Foster  (who is always a delight to see) tells her to strip, the combination of  shock and insecurity on her face shows that she actually has some acting  ability. There is a charming sequence set to music where Ms. Massey tries  on a wide variety of hooker-wear, and in fact the number of outfits that  she is shown either getting into or out of throughout the movie is as  interesting and varied as the sexual encounters, which encompass straight  sex, menage a trois, girl/girl, voyeurism, S&M/B&D et al. The end  confrontation with the killer actually has some modicum of suspense. I put  this up with ""Paris, France"" as an example of fine film-making in  soft-core which stands up to repeated viewings, and not altogether  unsuitable for couples to view.",946080000,9,1120,4.770833333333333
