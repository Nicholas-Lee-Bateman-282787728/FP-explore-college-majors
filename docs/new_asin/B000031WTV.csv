7916464,5,B000031WTV,"Remember the Mickey McGuire series? No? I remember seeing it maybe once on tv in the late 50's-early 60's. For those of you who don't remember, one look at Mickey Rooney in his derby and you'll remember the look! Rooney is fantastic in this late '20's/early '30's series - he'll make you a fan all over again! Obviously, this ain't The Little Rascals, and plotlines suffer. But there is so much happening in these films you don't care about plot. There are mistakes that are intentionally left in, technicians laffing off camera, kids REALLY crying, animals and kids being yanked around by harnesses...SO MUCH of this stuff you couldn't get away with these days in film! The kid actors look like they're really put in danger atop a skyscraper...Billy Barty tangles with a REAL alligator - not a fake one! Real wild scenes, crashes through walls & roofs, unruly goats and mules, a train smashing into a stalled car on the tracks and TONS more....wow! The box set contains 5 videos with 10 episodes, eight featuring Rooney (the other two feature some kid I'm not familiar with). Even though Mick was turned down by Our Gang, I think it was a good career move. If he had been a member of Our Gang (Little Rascals), Hollywood might've cast him aside once he became a teen and we never would have the fine performances he turned in as a teen and adult. If you love Our Gang, Mickey Rooney, or just old comedies in general, either way you won't regret purchasing this video collection. I hope there will be more sets to come! Now...where can I send Mickey Rooney a complimentary letter?",977270400,,1580,4.6263345195729535
