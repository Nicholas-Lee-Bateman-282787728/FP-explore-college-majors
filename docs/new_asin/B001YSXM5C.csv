Red Ryder tells the telegrapher to send the message. The bad guys henchmen shoot at him, then leave. Will the bad guy be able to change the report? A Bridge Out sign forces a detour. The Land Commissioner arrived.

Can a new land survey create new boundaries to enrich one land owner? That young boy needs an operation, but it can be dangerous. His next of kin must take responsibility. But Dickies Aunt May is in cahoots with Lambert! The operation is a success, it will take time to recover. The Sheriff tells Coonskin he is on Brayons land and must move out in ten days! Peoples horses and cattle are run off, buildings burned out. People plan to fight this. Aunt May goes against Lambert by wanting a specialist doctor from Denver. Red Ryder checks the boundary stakes, they are inaccurate. A man shoots at Aunt May, this attracts Red Ryder who stops her wagon. Coonskin tells Red Ryder about the boundary stakes, who goes to talk to Big Bill.

Is the new Land Commissioner honest? Red Ryder sees something of Aunt May in Lamberts office and questions him; there is a fight! The Sheriff arrives to arrest Red Ryder. Lambert talks to Aunt May. Coonskin tells Lambert about the events. The Duchess will take Dickie to Denver for a medical treatment. Aunt May stops the stage to Denver and gets on. Somebody throws a not and a key into Red Ryders jail cell; can he unlock the door and ride away? Is this a scheme to shoot Red Ryder? But Red Ryder gets away to Coonskins ranch and learns the Duchess is on the stage. The chase is on! Red Ryder catches up to the stagecoach, there is shooting. Red Ryder drives away the bad guys, but Aunt May is shot before Lambert. Dickie recovered and gets his own pony to ride.

It seems as if scenes were omitted from this version but most of the story remains. It has one of the classic stories where there is a land swindle, the important citizen in town is in cahoots with the crooked sheriff and his bad guys. But it all ends well for the good guys. One feature is how Lambert wants to control communications with the outside world for his benefit. Who controls your newspaper and broadcast stations? Red Ryder began as a newspaper comic strip in the late 1930's and lasted until 1964. Many comic strips from that time are also gone.",1511049600,,2740,4.441351888667992

8348232,5,B001YSXM5C,"I give this five stars mainly because I'm so glad that somebody cares enough about the history of trains in America to even make these videos. There is some beautiful archival footage here.

Until Ken Burns (or someone on that scale) takes on the history of American rail, these Charles Smiley videos are probably the best you can get.

Having said that, you should be aware that the videos are rather dry, somewhat low in production value, and are often disorganized in terms of presenting history and chronology.

As far as this specific video (Southern Pacific Vintage West) is concerned, my main criticisms are that it doesn't give a clear sense of the birth, growth, evoloution, and demise of the once thiriving railroad. In addition, for a railroad company that covered most of the west, the 75 minute video concentrates far too much on SP lines in the Bay Area. Yes, Southern Pacific was headquartered in San Franciso, but it would have been nice to learn more about lines north of Sacramento and south of Los Angeles.

It seems to me the makers of this video assume some historical knowledge of railroads on the part of the viewer. I think the presentation suffers from that asumption.

But if you love trains (and who doesn't really?) then there is historical footage here from the 1950s-70s that will delight you.",1343952000,,1323,4.785087719298246
