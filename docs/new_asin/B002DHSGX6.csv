8365235,5,B002DHSGX6,"I bought this when my daughter got a job as a historical interpreter at Jamestown. It is a very well-done documentary of the construction and sailing of a replica of the ""Godspeed"", one of three British ships that brought the original settlers to Jamestown in 1607. All of the original sailing vessels have been reproduced using such original sources as are available and employing a mixture of old and new technology; the ships do have engines, though they are only utilized when necessary.

The presentation is excellent, with plenty of both technical and historical background. It is not, and does not claim to be, a full history of Colonial America, or even of the Jamestown Settlement. If you're contemplating a trip to our Historic Triangle, this video might well enhance your understanding.",1284940800,8,797,5.037878787878788
