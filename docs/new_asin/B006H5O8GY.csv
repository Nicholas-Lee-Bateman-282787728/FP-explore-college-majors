8498206,2,B006H5O8GY,"Very disappointing DVD - the sound quality is so poor, and what makes that such a disability is that the narration is the ONLY identification for the ballet footage.  No titles come on to show you who is dancing, so if you cannot quite understand the narrator, you are left only with guesswork. There is little footage on here which is not on other Russian classic vintage ballet recordings. In addition, the program is repeated on the DVD, so it runs twice. The whole thing seems very incompetent to me. There are doubtless other titles in this category of greater value to balletomanes.",1514246400,,588,4.70873786407767
