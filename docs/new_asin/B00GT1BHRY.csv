6111778,5,B00GT1BHRY,Huggy came to my hometown Evansviile Indiana he was funny and I loved  him every since. Anything new come out let me know. All my family and friends love it also. Let me know if he comes close to me I will go to see him!,1390262400,,220,3.782608695652174

6111781,5,B00GT1BHRY,"I enjoyed Chris Paul's honest take of life humor, but Huggy Lowdown was OFF THE HOOK funny!  The things he comes up with, and his comedic timing is genius!  I really needed this!
Thanks!",1390003200,,186,4.4411764705882355
6111782,4,B00GT1BHRY,"Chris Paul and Huggy Lowdown are Hilarious! They are innovative, quick witted and very funny. If they ever come to your town you must try to see them Live.",1389312000,,155,4.379310344827586
6111783,4,B00GT1BHRY,"Hearing both Chris Paul and Huggy Lowdown on the radio, I think I was expecting more.  However, it wasn't too bad and had some laughter for me in it.  It was a gift for my husband and so we watched it together...that added more laughter for the both of us.  I would recommend it to others.",1389139200,2,289,4.125

6111786,5,B00GT1BHRY,This is one of the best comedy DVDs I have seen in a very long time.  You will not be disappointed.,1386028800,11,99,3.7142857142857144
6111787,1,B00GT1BHRY,Chris Paul wasn't really funny and the packaging was cheaply done. Huggy should have performed alone for the complete show.,1393718400,,123,5.2
6111788,2,B00GT1BHRY,I enjoy both Huggy and Chris on the TJMS and they always leave me laughing-this dvd just did not live up to my expectations-I ordered it to watch with my son while on vacation in FLA and was so disappointed I left it with him,1393113600,,225,4.022222222222222
6111789,3,B00GT1BHRY,It was funny but I wouldn't have bought it if I had known they would insult an entire race.  I wrote the maker of the DVD but got no reply,1393027200,,138,3.6
6111790,3,B00GT1BHRY,Huggy Low Down as always was HILARIOUS. Could have done without Chris Paul. You could just pay to go see Huggy live at a venue and not suffer the agony of Chris Paul. He is soooo not funny,1392595200,2,188,3.973684210526316
6111791,5,B00GT1BHRY,"This cd was so funny, I think huggy and Chris Paul did a wonder job. My husband and I are still laughing we have watched it over and over again. Yes!!! I would recommend that anyone who loves comedy to purchase this DVD.
