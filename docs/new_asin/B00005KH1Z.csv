1619691,5,B00005KH1Z,"This film is a blend of raw humanity and brutal honesty. It was so refreshing to see the issues delt with done with so much style and not the usual sentimental [stuff]. As a huge Dolly fan and a director of performance myself, I have only this to say: Yes, Dolly is not a Liz Taylor, but few performers has ever reached her level of honesty in character and emotion when it comes to playing any character. Instead of boring crocedile tears, Dolly shows us inner pain - as does this whole film. This is a movie for people that understand what it means to hide your pain so that the show can go on. Deeply moving and profoundly liberating if you are able to leave soap operas behind you for a minute or two.",1054512000,17,705,4.229629629629629
1619692,5,B00005KH1Z,"This is a great movie....Dolly Parton goes through a journey with many ups ans downs. She is a singer that is trying to make it big. She performs at a friend, Ruby's, bar. Will she make it big, or be stuck in the wrong gear?..highly recommmended especially Dolly fans!!",1049587200,2,269,4.510204081632653
1619693,5,B00005KH1Z,"Touching, simple, real-life like story, wonderful movie, with gorgeous music with Dolly sounding like an angel.  Like every other Dolly fan I would love for someone somehow to publish
a copy of ""We Might be Inlove"" as it has never been released outside of the actual movie, and there is no soundtrack...
As for the ""Editorial Review"" The movie was WRITTEN based on Dolly's song ""Blue Valley Songbird"" off her ""Hungry Again"" Album, and the whole bit is to explain Leanna's origins, and how she came to be where she's at.... and to explain what's REALLY been holding here back through the years, so if you get beyond your opinion that Dolly can't act you'll see there's another depth to this story.... Highly recommended to anyone who loves Dolly, music and or Romance!!!",1012867200,23,769,4.7819548872180455
1619694,5,B00005KH1Z,"Dolly's 1999 made-for-tv movie has finally made it to home video.  Dolly's musical and acting abilities both shine on this release. The movie, based upon Dolly's fictional story song ""Blue Valley Songbird"" features Dolly playing the read headed Leanna Taylor.  The plot centers around Leanna trying to make it big as a country sginer by playing night clubs and fighting to get on a major label.  Dolly songs featured in the movie are ""Blue Valley Songbird"", ""Wildflowers"" (peformed beatifully by Dolly accompanied only by her autoharp!!!), ""I Hope Youre Never Happy"", ""Runaway Feelin"". Two songs never recorded by Dolly, also appear in the moivie these are the gospel standard '""Angel Band"" which is by far the BEST version ever!!! The other new track is the Dolly penned duet ""We Might Be In Love"" which is peformed several times as a duet by Dolly & co-star Billy Dean.  This movie will please any Dolly or Billy Dean fan!",1002844800,7,924,4.86624203821656

' Was in the mood for sweet entertainment.  You could definitely do worse for an hour and a half of your time.

Never an active seeker of country music per se, although there is much to be said about the talent thriving in this genre, Dolly keeps us smiling with her universal talent.

Unique, gentle natural vibrato to her voice.  And others may disagree, but I find her acting refreshing for its pure honesty.

So happy to have watched this.  It was like a glass of mint ice tea on a hot day - very refreshing and much appreciated.",1462665600,3,565,4.3238095238095235

1619858,5,B00005KH1Z,"By the late 1990's Dolly Parton was not receiving any good theatrical movie scripts, but this one called ""Blue Valley Songbird"" came her way. Based on a song of the same title Dolly wrote for her underrated ""Hugry Again"" album in 1998 ""Blue Valley Songbird"" originally aired on the ""Lifetime"" network to huge ratings. Dolly plays a lounge country and western singer who is trying to make it big in Nashville and to land a major record deal. She is involved in a triangle between two men as well, one played by then hot Billy Dean who duets with Dolly on ""We Might Be In Love"", one of Dolly's most beautifully-penned love songs. The script is strong, the acting honors belong to Dolly of course and the film is very involving and features Dolly singing many songs throughout including her sensitive ""Wildflowers"", originally appearing on her ""Trio"" album from 1987 with Emmylou Harris and Linda Rondstant, ""I Hope Your Never Happy"" from 1985's ""Real Love LP and ""Runaway Feelin' from 1991's ""Eagle When She Flies"". All these songs are newly arranged and recorded just for the film. Unfortunately, there was never a soundtrack release from ""Blue Valley Songbird"" although there was and still is a great demand for it from Dolly's fan base.

 The movie was shot entirely on location in Nashville and is the only time in Dolly's career that she wore a red wig for the role.",1354752000,7,1369,4.7238493723849375
1619859,1,B00005KH1Z,"I love Dolly and Dolly movies in general.  But this one was about a singer who is unmarried and living with her manager and in a time of weakness and semi-despair sleeps with her guitarist, who granted, is the genuine dude who probably does love her, at least in the end.  But it's not going to be part of my family friendly collection.  That's not the story, mind you, well, maybe it is more than not!--but the storyline is laid on top of that as it's foundation, that and an abused childhood we see bits of in flashback.  I'd recommend skipping this one and head straight to the made for TV movie called Smokey Mountain Christmas, which is a great story with Lee Majors and Dolly.  It's better acted too, btw. Blue Valley Songbird is not overly convincing.  Whoa! I just checked the price!  Plus they don't seem to have put it on DVD yet.  That is a great oversight!  Wish they would do so soon.  I have the video, but always wanted a DVD too.  Even the video is out-of-sight!  Used $29 and new $65.  Now that is amazing.",1338681600,,1023,4.321052631578947

1619861,4,B00005KH1Z,This was an enjoyable movie with lots of good singing that only Dolly can do with her country voice & giggily laugh.  Songs were ones I hadn't heard before.,1318982400,,156,4.379310344827586

1619864,2,B00005KH1Z,"This is actually not a movie.  It is a concert strung together with glimpses of a tyranical father and scenes with a controlling boyfriend.  After 30 minutes of having these scenes repeated, we have got the idea.  There is an urge to say, ""Okay, okay, now move on to something else!""  But no.  It's another 55 minutes of the same scenes and glimpses telling us the same things.  There is one event only, after 85 minutes of film, in which she finally sees what the audience has seen ages ago: that her boyfriend is like her father.  She sings for a record company and then--bang--another concert as a star.

As a movie, this has to rate two stars.

For Dolly fans and for people who like rockabilly, this will be worth the price.

So, know what you're getting and be sure what you want.  For Dolly AND a movie, I recommend ""Unlikely Angel"" or ""Straight Talk"" or even ""Rhinestone"".",1184889600,7,880,4.471698113207547

7943172,4,B00005KH1Z,"Dolly Parton is somehow irresistible when you're in the right mood for one of her films. She's got the cheery voice but it somehow always seems genuine. Thanks to her, this movie was engaging. Guess that's part of the way I can tell it's a good movie, for me, there's no feeling to fast forward through parts of it and I forget to get up and get snacks. I love music; many genres of music and her voice is rare and pure, if you ask me. The film had a deeper healing in it along the baseline of the story and seemed quite realistic in many ways.",1515974400,,544,4.093457943925234
