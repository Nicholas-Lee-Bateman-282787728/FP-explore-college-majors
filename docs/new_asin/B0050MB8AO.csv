8451500,2,B0050MB8AO,"When I found this DVD I thought it'd be a great addition to our collection! However the way Nat Geo did this series was difficult to follow at times. I was expecting a show similar to Who Do You Think You Are with a Nat Geo twist instead I got something that was difficult to follow at times with bad cgi and aggravating photo angles. Some documentaries try hard to make images of the past come to life but In this attempt I feel as if they went overboard with the cgi, green screen and photo recreations. Stories are interesting but would definitely be better if they stuck with one or two stories at a time. Too much camera jumping. Also it'd be nice if they would labeled more of where they were.",1374278400,,699,4.2631578947368425
8451501,5,B0050MB8AO,"Curious collection of Civil War related documentaries. The main documentaries concern themselves with descendants of people who fought in or were affected by the Civil War learning more about their ancestors in the places they travelled to. These docs are interesting, though slightly hampered by the re-enactments, which could have been left out entirely or done in a better fashion. It's the special features which are better than the main programs. Two are full length documentaries, one is an update. The first tells of the sinking of a ship in the aftermath of the war, with a cargo of gold on board. The second documents the Hunley, the first submarine to sink an enemy ship in combat, though the sub sank shortly after. The documentary on the Hunley details the efforts to raise the sub, its challenges and archaeological value, and the work conservators will face when the sub is out of water. The update gives us the current status quo of the Hunley, years after the fact. Highly recommended for the backup documentaries.",1344729600,,1030,4.925287356321839
8451502,4,B0050MB8AO,This is a pretty good dvd.  The idea of taking a close personal look at three different individuals and how the war affected them is pretty good.  Informative and entertaining at the same time!!!  We will keep this one in our collection.,1328313600,,237,4.595238095238095
8451503,5,B0050MB8AO,"National Geographic has put out an amazing 3 DVD set about the Civil War - but it personifies the war in a manner not usually done. We follow several descendants from that time as they discover the land, the buildings and what their ancestors went through. It is both touching, horrifying and educational. We see the pictures of those who lived through the war. There are some reenactments, sometimes blending into the scenes of today. Sometimes the resemblance between those of today and yesteryear is amazing. We see Charles Latham put on a uniform as his great-great grandfather William Fletcher did and discover how hot, smelly and uncomfortable it is, along with the 40lbs of equipment he has to carry. He goes to the battlefield, and fires the same type of rife. We also discover how the bullets of the Civil War era were more devastating than those of today. It is an education in why there were so many amputations - not just because the medical standards were not those currently in use.
Among the descendants are those of a battlefield surgeon, soldiers, slaves, ordinary civilians and a southern lady. These make for a fascinating story that would engross many, even if history is not their favorite subject.

At times the pictures flash too fast and are distracting and then there is the old film of Ft Sumter's cannons firing the first shots of the war, but there is snow, which would not possibly have been there. Unlike the talking heads which is irritating in so many historical films, these experts are actually, for example, walking through a Civil War barn/hospital and showing someone what the war was like.

The 3 discs contain; Families at war, Free at last, The hard war. These are subtitled for the hearing impaired. There are bonus features of; Civil War gold - finding a shipwreck that contained gold coins of the era, Raising the Hunley - a southern submarine that sank and Inside the Hunley. These bonus features are not subtitled and at time the narration is soft and even talks over the men on the recovery ships.
Still this is an extraordinary look into the Civil War. One that is worthwhile even if you have seen other Civil War programs.",1316649600,7,2170,4.738095238095238
