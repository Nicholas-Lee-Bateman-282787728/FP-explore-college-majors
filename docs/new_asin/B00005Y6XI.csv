1674666,4,B00005Y6XI,"""Doctor Who"" fandom has generally been split when judging the 7th Doctor/Sylvester McCoy era of the show.  With ""Remembrance of the Daleks"", usually hailed as one of the 7th Doctor's best stories, now out on DVD for the first time, that split is as obvious as ever.
""Remembrance"" is set in London, in November, 1963, opening ""Doctor Who""'s 25th anniversary season by revisiting events from the show's very first episode. The script, written by then 25 year-old Ben Aaronovitch (who later made a big splash in the subsequent ""Doctor Who"" book line) is a terrific one, layered with references to the show's past, to the societal fears of the time (uncertainty over the burgeoning civil rights movement, and the Kennedy assassination, all linger over the story), and, of course, gives us a more descriptive view of ""Doctor Who""'s signature monsters, the Daleks, than ever before.  The production, on the other hand, seems stretched paper-thin, with ultra-wobbly Daleks, a really awful '80s-synthesizer incidental score, and primitive CGI effects that dated as rapidly as '70's DW's fascination with Chroma-key.
The DVD commentary track is recorded by Sylvester McCoy himself, and by Sophie ""Ace"" Aldred.  The on-screen chemistry between these two, for which the McCoy era is fondly remembered, is present on the commentary track, which is sadly a little dull when compared to Peter Davison's comedy stylings on the ""Caves of Androzani"" DVD, also out this month.  Aldred audibly enjoys the story, but McCoy's final reaction is ""HMMM..."".  I agreed with both of them.
The notable extra is a stunning montage of 13 deleted scenes, with linking text describing their place in the originally-conceived story.  This presentation is as handsome as the presentation of the deleted scenes in ""The Godfather"" box set.  Honest!  Also welcome are McCoy's on-camera jokes and bloopers -- the man is a human outtake reel and he's quite funny in these.  The best of an obligatory photo-gallery is a shot of McCoy on location watching his stunt-double in action.
""Remembrance"" can also be watched with pop-up production notes, which sometimes border on the painfully obvious (""TV sets took a long time to warm up in 1963"") but which add interesting trivia.  You can also select a ""music-only"" option, but the Casio drums and the synthesized handclaps are so painful that you're probably best off skipping that.",1019433600,9,2391,5.139175257731959
1674667,5,B00005Y6XI,"""Remembrance of the Daleks""...a great story with dazzling special effects. There are some nice tributes to William Hartnell & Jon Pertwee in the story as well. One of the great scenes is a Dalek climbing the stairs...something that never has been done before.",1019260800,,259,5.046511627906977
1674668,2,B00005Y6XI,"While this story actually has a decent (if not contrived) plot, the production fails to do it justice despite having an expensive look to it.  In 1988, the in-jokes and nostalgia references were welcomed by most fans, but time has not treated this story well.  The same references and in-jokes come across as irritating and pointless and do nothing but to detract from the story and its (re-)watchability.  Much of the 7th Doctor era makes references and in-jokes rather than just telling stories.
I will admit that ""Remembrance"" was a 25th Anniversay show.  Still, the writer and production team could have spent the time to make the references less obtrusive and even more accurate.  Yes, some of the nostalgia references were inaccurate!!!  There are so many that it's not worth mentioning.  Fans of the show can readily spot any reference, accurate or otherwise.  Those unfamiliar with the show will wonder why the story is making references to some obscure items... that is, until they watch the older stories that references are made to - after which they'd start complaining about the inaccuracies and pointlessness of the references too.  The main story being referenced is ""An Unearthly Child"" (1963).
Why do I think the story is contrived?  Mostly because of the references and in-jokes, but partly because it revises the show's rather long-running history.  For 25 years, viewers were led to believe that the Doctor was just a wandering Gallifreyan, bored with events and policies on his home planet, fighting evil for the sake of helping those in need.  Now all of a sudden, viewers are forced to believe that the Doctor left his home planet, taking a bunch of high-tech weapons and leaving them on Earth so he can come back in his future to destroy evil he hadn't even met when he dropped them off!  (""Silver Nemesis"" is another story dealing with another weapon the Doctor had apparently created but left on Earth after leaving Gallifrey...)

1674669,5,B00005Y6XI,"After leaving the scrapyard by Totters Lane, London, in 1963 with Susan, Ian & Barbara, the Doctor, in his seventh incarnation, returns  with a new companion, Ace, to retieve what he left behind. Truely a classic Who serial. Rembrance of the Daleks not only celebrates the return of the Daleks, but it also brings the viewer back to where it all started. What can be said about Remembrance that hasn't been said. The direction, execution, acting and effects are top-notch. Ben Aaronovitch's first script for Doctor Who has a sort of revisionist continuity that Genesis of the Daleks displayed so many years ago.
Plus, the transfer to DVD is perfect! The clarity and audio has never been better! And, this disc has a good number of extras for a program that aired in the 80s. Kudos all around!",1017792000,,792,4.739130434782608
1674670,5,B00005Y6XI,"This is the best dalek story with the exception of genesis of the daleks. The McCoy era got off to a pretty shaky start with stories like Time and the Rani and Dragon fire,but Remembrance marked the start of Who actually getting watchable again.
McCoy shines in what should have been the 25th anniversary story,with explosions,death,destruction and more daleks than McCoy could shake his umbrella at this is entertaining from beginning to end and features possibly the best cliffhanger of the series 26 year run.
The effects in this are probably the best the series ever produced (the technician responsible for all those shoddy effects must have been off with a sprained wrist).The dalek weapons look menacing and the explosions are unreal. The only let down would be some of the shuttle and mothership effects which could have been so much better. But on a special effects budget of about 5000 per episode,what more do we expect?
The extra features were ok,the commentary was pretty good,but the ""multiple camera angles"" were actually two different camera shots for about two different scenes,so that was a bit of a let down. But otherwise this is one of McCoys best outings as the doctor with the exceptions of The curse of fenric and survival.
If you are a who fan then this DVD is a must,even if you aren't a big fan of the McCoy era.",1017532800,,1339,4.75107296137339
1674671,4,B00005Y6XI,"Remembrance of the Daleks is the only Sylvester Mcoy Dalek story and it's the best 7th Doctor they made. It involves the Doctor returning to the very Junk Yard where the program began in 1963 just a few days after his first incarnation left. For some reason, two warring factions of Daleks have traveled back to this time as well. Why are they there and what do they want... and what exactly was the Doctor doing in 1963 London back in the first episode anyway? All these questions will be answered.
It is so cool that Dr. Who is coming out on DVD with all the extras you could want. It's a pity other show DVDs such as the recent Farscape episode don't have such extras. Hopefully the forthcoming Star Trek DVDs will. Here's a list of the extras you'll get...
commentary by Sylvester McCoy & Sophie Aldred, deleted scenes, out-takes, on screen production note subtitles, multi-angle scenes, the original trailers, photo gallery
Ths commentary is pretty good. More consistent and informative than the Robots of Death Commentary but not quite as entertaining as The Five Doctors Commentary or the Caves of androzani Commentary. Sophi and Sylvester talk a lot about things that happened on the set and the careers of some of their costars in the story. Pretty interesting stuff...
On another note... if you're looking for new Dr. Who material. Look for the audio releases of the missing episodes. Look for my list ""Missing Dr. Who's on Audio and Video"" to find out about this. [....]Look for ""The Web of Fear"" for starters. ""The Dalek's Master Plan"" Audio Release is awsome too. Also check out Big Finnish productions for the new audio adventures of Dr. Who featuring Doctors ranging from Peter Davison to Paul Mcgann. Was this review helpful?

1674672,4,B00005Y6XI,"A great adventure for the Doctor from the programmes' 25th anniversary.
Once again the Doctor is caught in a battle between two rival factions of the Daleks, but who is the Emperor Dalek? Could we have met him before?
The Doctor returns to Earth, 1963 to put the 'Hand of Omega', a device of infinite power, out of harms way. However, the Doctor and Ace soon discover that there is another interested party!.
This is one of the more comic-book adventures, with plenty of action. The special effects are the best the programme has had to offer!
On the minus side, as this is an anniversary story the makers couldn't resist couple of in-jokes. I personally feel these could have been left out, but don't let that put you off! It's one of the best 7th Doctor stories, and certainly deserves a place on the list of the all-time greatest Dr. Who adventures.
This DVD edition has great image and sound quality, and together with a bag of great extras it is a real treat.
Just don't expect to be able to escape the Daleks by running up a staircase, you may be in for a nasty surprise!",1011916800,2,1077,4.444444444444445
1674673,5,B00005Y6XI,"This review is based on the VHS release.  The region 1 DVD includes extras such as commentry and deleted scenes.
By the time Sylvester McCoy took over the role of the Doctor, the BBC had practically killed the series by imposing restrictions on the producers with regards to what type of scripts they could use, what level of violence they could display, what target audience they should aim at and a reduced budget to boot.  It was commented in a lot of newspapers that the most evil villan the doctor had to face was not the Daleks or Cybermen, but rather the controller of BBC 1!!!
The first few McCoy episodes were awful and it seemed as if there was no hope for the series, but Rememberance of the Daleks proved that McCoy's Doctor could have some truely ""classic"" episodes along with ""Ghostlight"" and ""Curse of Fendrick"".
The Doctor takes Ace back in time to Earth in the early 1960's and seems to stumble across a lone Dalek in a junk yard (looking for cleap parts for it's spaceship perhaps?).  He assists the military in destroying it and, with the help of their scientific adviser from the British Rocket Group (does the name ""Professor Quatermass"" mean anything to you?), he tracks another souce of alien activity to the local school - Coal Hill School.
As the plot unfolds we discover that the Doctor has been planning these events for some time and wants to use a secret Time Lord device called the Hand of Omega as bait to attract and destroy the Daleks.  Unfortunately, two rival groups of Daleks show up looking for the device and a war breaks out between the Imperial and Regular Dalek forces...
A good storyline, breath-taking cliffhangers and excellent effects help to turn this story into one of the all-time greats and should have been the tenplate for all further episodes.  We see the return of the ""white"" Dalek design from ""Revelation of the Daleks"", along with a new ""Special Weapons Dalek"" and the ""Emperor Dalek"".  The Dalek shuttlecraft is looks convincing when landing, the Dalek weapons now fire ""bolts"" that pass through objects rather than the old ""static line"", and when a bolt hits someone we get a decent ""kill"" effect instead of that awful ""negative"" effect of the past.  Even better is the visual proof that Daleks CAN go up and down stairs!!!
Doctor Who fans will have a blast as they notice subtile links and references to first Doctor Who story.  For those who havn't followed the series from the beginning, Coal Hill school is where Susan, the Doctor's granddaughter attended classes and where Ian and Barbara (his first companions) taught English and Science.  The classroom where Ace battles a Dalek is Ian's science classroom and the copy of the French Revolution that Ace picks up is the one that Barbara loaned Susan and which Susan was horrified to discover was full of errors.  The junk yard where the lone Dalek is destroyed is the same junkyard where we first see the TARDIS... I could go on, but see how many you can find ;)",1011744000,17,2976,4.673040152963671

1674677,5,B00005Y6XI,"If you have to own one 7th Doctor story, (and I think no classic Who collection is complete without a little sampling from every Doctor) you probably can't go wrong with this one. There is a lot to love with this one: Davros, the special-weapons Dalek, references to older Who episodes, good special feature extras, a history of the character Davros, the under-rated dynamic between Ace and the 7th Doctor, and a great performance by the Doctor himself Sylvester McCoy.
A criticism of classic Who in its later years was the writing and stories weren't stacking up against its earlier years, but I think people will really appreciate the 7th Doctor with this one. Another great 7th Doctor story is The Curse of Fenric (uncut version). Its on Netflix so check it out.

1674680,5,B00005Y6XI,"After a very weak Season 24, Remembrance of the Daleks is a shot in the arm to the Seventh Doctor and the series as a whole. The story is easily the best Dalek story since ""Genesis of the Daleks,"" and one of the best directed stories of the 1980s.

Remembrance of the Daleks features a superb guest cast of characters including the group who would eventually become Counter Measures. We also have a Dalek Civil War and some fantastic concepts including the Special weapons dalek.

The action scenes are terrific, and Ace establishes herself as the most physically capable companions since Leela. We always see a transformation of the Doctor from to a darker more manipulative character. McCoy is great in playing this version of the Doctor. Some fans love it, some hate it. I have mixed feelings, but as his predecessor would have said, ""He's the Doctor whether you like it or not."" And this version of the Doctor would be the one developed over the next decade, not just on television but in the Virgin New Adventures series that would defined many people's idea of who the Doctor.

The biggest drawback to the story is music which continued to be distractingly bad. Still, this is one of the best stories of the 1980s, and a must-watch story.",1431043200,,1244,4.671232876712328

The Daleks and their human minions are presented to the audience as the ultimate racists.

In fact, it is shown that he's been plotting to do so from the very beginning.

The plot is rather complicated, two groups of Daleks are fighting each other on earth. And, both Dalek groups are fighting humans. The Daleks want the Hand of Omega, the Doctor left it on the earth in 1963. The extras are very good, but the audio in the commentary: it is difficult to hear Sophie, McCoy is fine. Sophie is not close enough to the microphone. But, if you listen closely it's a very good commentary. I'm very happy with this DVD. I like being able to buy individual episodes.

This is a great story and I'm glad I purchased it. The special features, especially about the evolution of Davros was very entertaining. Ace is one of my favorite companions because she has a lot of emotional baggage and they explore this on the show like few companions before. This was a precursor to the new Doctor's companions like Rose having complex lives beyond the box.

I won't go into the story, as Doctor Who fans have likely seen it. I wish Davros had more screen time, but the little girl playing the part of the battle computer was brilliant. The acting was crisp and the interplay between the ensemble was great.

Not since Jon Pertwee have I been so immediately captivated by an incarnation of the Doctor, and my fondness for him only grew as the serial progressed.  Ace is also one of the best companions.  The story was just all-around excellent.  The civil war between the Daleks was especially intriguing.  And of course this Doctors chess master strategies cannot be praised enough.

1674704,3,B00005Y6XI,"I am a big Dalek fan. I have all the classics that are still obtainable on DVD and even an alarm clock that threatens to ""Exterminate"" me every morning, so I was eager to see my old friends again. Now I wish I had not.

One thing about the Daleks that I always loved is even with the limited effects used in classic ""Who"" they still managed to be an intimidating enemy. Even in their first appearance they were still ""Daleks"". However in this story they are little more then pest, not scary, not all that dangerous, and easily defeated by every weapon used against them. Their charm is gone and they are puppeted worse then ever before. They wiggle, they wobble, the shake at the costume seams, they can be stoped by a door. I had to turn my Dalek figur on the mantle the other way so it could not see this disgrace. Basically they appeared to think that Daleks are scary because they roll around and shoot at things. Totally missing the core part of what makes Daleks scary, the totality of their evil, the way they will scrap an entire planet for a valuable grain of sand and clearly have the means to do so.  Wimpy Daleks mean a bad Dalek story.

The story itself is silly. The Doctor would never just bring something so dangerous to an inhabited planet. Even the roughest of his incarnations would never willing put people at risk for a hiding place. Sure the idea of trying to make a close link to the first story for the 25th was nice, but it was poorly done. The Doctor was a traveler, he could have been on earth for a million reasons, watching us take our first steps into space, it was an interesting time in our planets history where we were becoming more of one world then just waring empires, lots of nifty stuff, but endangering our planet hardly sounds like the Doctor.

I won't get into the portrayal of the Doctor because I am new to Mr. McCoy as the Doctor and it takes a bit to get used to a new guy in the old TARDIS.

1674709,5,B00005Y6XI,"The answer is a bit complicated.

In 2007, 2entertain in the UK decided to release a Davros Box Set in their market.  It would contain all five of the classic series stories that featured Davros.  Four of them had been released before, however, with only Destiny of the Daleks being new to the DVD market.  With that in mind, they decided to try and soup up the box set a bit.

They had been unhappy with the original UK edition of Remembrance of the Daleks.  It had faults in the restoration that meant some special effects had gone missing, and one of the featurettes didn't work as intended.  (Both of these problems had been repaired for the later North American edition that's been on our market since 2002.)
They decided one way to improve the Davros Box Set would be to make a Special Edition, with those faults fixed and some new special features added.

They also decided to make special arrangements with Big Finish Productions, the licensed makers of audio dramas of Doctor Who and its related characters that have been producing new stories regularly since 1999.
These arrangements were to include all of the titles they had made to that point that featured Davros on a DVD/Audio Disc, plus one new story with Davros exclusive to this box set.  And to tie the audios and the TV stories together, they made a further featurette, Davros Connections, and gave it its own disc.

BBC Worldwide Americas soon announced plans to release this set in North America as well, however they soon had to retract these plans and were only able to release a single title, Destiny of the Daleks, the one we hadn't had in our market yet.  The retraction occurred because the price point they wanted to sell it at, $100 for the whole set, would have undercut the UK's price point by about 50%.  2entertain were concerned that this would cause UK consumers to simply import the North American edition and not buy the UK one, and told them they had to increase the North American price to match theirs if they wanted to release it.  BBC WA felt they couldn't sell it at that price and chose not to try. The UK price was inflated on this occasion due to the inclusion of the Big Finish audios, which at the time sold from Big Finish for $25 per title.  It was a big discount to a consumer to buy all 8 of them as this DVD-Audio, but was still a back breaker price wise for the North American market.

BBC WA did try (and in fact did announce this) to release the Remembrance of the Daleks: Special Edition on its own at that time, but 2entertain prohibited that as well as it wasn't yet available on its own in the UK market.  In the summer of 2009, however, it was finally released on its own there packaged along with the Davros Connections featurette disc, and this March 2010 North American release is effectively the North American mirror of that UK summer 2009 release.

If you buy this title and become interested in the audio drams you hear clips of in the Davros Connections disc, where you can buy them in either CD form or as a direct mp3 download (for about half the price). The stories are the four part ""I, Davros""  miniseries (which do not feature the Doctor), and the three Doctor Who audio drama stories: ""Davros"" starring Colin Baker, ""The Juggernauts"" starring Colin Baker and Bonnie Langford, and ""Terror Firma"" starring Paul McGann, India Fisher, and Conrad Westmaas.  They all also star Terry Molloy as Davros (who also played him in the three 1980s TV stories). (The story that was exclusive to the UK Davros Box Set was called ""The Davros Mission"", and it is not available from Big Finish, as again, it was exclusive to the UK Davros Box Set.)",1266883200,9,3657,4.538812785388128

If the BBC wants to refund the purchase price of the 'flawed' sets or exchange the new sets for them, that would be great. Why should fans have to 'double-dip' in our own pockets for production mistakes?

If you do NOT already own this release, by all means, but the 'corrected' version, because the story is excellent. I cannot condone RE=PURCHASE, however.

1674711,5,B00005Y6XI,"""Remembrance of the Daleks"" is not only one of the best Dalek episodes in the entire Doctor Who series - it may well be the very best of them all.  Which is particularly surprising given the rather weak stories of the Sylvester McCoy years - not to mention that McCoy's Doctor Who is generally considered to be the least effective  of the entire series.  Not only was this a great Dalek episode, Sylvester McCoy's Doctor in this particular episode was one of the best portrayals in the series.  The only other McCoy story I've seen so far that I really liked was ""Survival"" - but I didn't care for McCoy's Doctor in that one.  The one thing I didn't like about ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" was the Doctor's companion, Ace.  In every other episode I've seen her in, she was fantastic - and a great help to the Doctor.  But in this one, she came across as a total buffoon who nearly ruins everything the Doctor's trying to accomplish.  Apart from that, everything flows like clockwork - even if the viewer, like the characters in the story, doesn't realize until near the end just how intricately the Doctor has set up his plan to save the day.  All in all, this is a fantastic Dalek episode, incorporating an unexpected aspect of the Daleks - which makes the story all the more appealing.",1252368000,,1286,4.508620689655173

1674713,5,B00005Y6XI,"Sylvester McCoy was a good Doctor, but he didn't get the best stories. The only thing the producer and script editor did right with his Doctor was making him more mysterious, but other than that... most of his stories were crap with confusing endings and what's with the Doctor always setting his enemies and companions up. I thought it was much more interesting when the Doctor had things happen to him unexpected instead of him laying the whole thing out in advance. I also don't know why the Doctor would want to set his companions up either. I can see why they cancelled the show shortly afterwards. They weren't all bad though. Check out his premiere story ""Time and the Rani"". Also check out ""Ghost Light"" and ""The Curse of Fenric"" (although those ones were a bit hard to understand at first, but watch them a couple of times and you'll get them). But this one was his best. Not only one of the best Dalek stories, but also one of the best Doctor Who stories ever. Packed with mystery and action all the way through. You've got two warring Dalek factions fighting to conquer the universe on 1963 Earth. You get to learn a little bit more about Time Lord history. You also get an insight on how the Time War might have begun. Good special effects for Dr. Who at the time. And the Daleks are as menacing as they ever were. Plus this featured the first time a Dalek was seen climbing stairs with their new hoving capability. The Emperor Dalek was a bit silly looking though, but you've got a surprise waiting for you towards the end that makes up for it. To be quite honest, I would have a hard time coming up with a reason for you not to buy this one. This was a very good one indeed. Better than all of the other Dalek stories of the 1980s, and certainly better than ""Revelation of the Daleks"". Highly recommended!",1232409600,,1819,4.416666666666667

1674718,5,B00005Y6XI,"For fans of Doctor Who both old and new, this is a very good title to add to your collection.

The plot and dialog in ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" are both quite strong. This story takes the Doctor and his new companion Ace back to the very location where Doctor Who started its run in 1963. The Doctor's oldest enemies, the Daleks, make great villains as always. In this case there are two factions of them fighting each other and the Doctor. Basically one faction represents the classic Daleks under their creator Davros whereas the other is a faction of renegade, mutant Daleks. Both are fighting for an artifact the Doctor left on Earth back during the first Doctor Who serial in 1963. It's a fun way to connect the lives of two incarnations of the Doctor though separated by over twenty years. This is classic Who at its best. The commentary track is very good- watch the show and listen to it for interesting tidbits. Was that the Doctor's script sticking out of McCoy's pocket throughout the show? No way!

Compared to some television-to-DVD transfers, this one is nearly flawless. The video and sound go off without a hitch. The special effects, while generally b-grade or thereabouts throughout the run of the classic Doctor Who years, are actually quite good. By the late 1980s, Who had a decent budget and the availability of early computer generated special effects helped some as well. While very wobbly due to the wheels they rolled on, the Daleks for instance manage to go up stairs for the first time ever. They also manage to move about freely for the first time because with their new wheels they didn't have to rely on flat services for movement.

It's interesting that the Sylvester McCoy years (Seventh Doctor) are widely held to be the worst run in the entire history of the series. This is because during that time, the cast and crew decided to show the darker side of the Doctor and played around with a darker wardrobe and darker, more pessimistic dialog for the character. Despite all that, McCoy proves in this serial that he was more than capable in the role. He brings a fair amount of slap stick comedy to the part (he was actually a bit of a comedian by profession anyway). He also nails down the serious side of the Doctor with his harsh conversation with Davros and his dismissal of some of his human companions as intellectual inferiors.

This DVD is a good purchase for any Doctor Who fan. It's fun, true to the spirit of Who and is very possibly the best story arc from the McCoy years. Even new Who fans familiar with the Ninth (Chris Eccleston) and Tenth (David Tennant) Doctors will find something to enjoy here.",1194480000,2,2650,4.619957537154989
1674719,5,B00005Y6XI,"By 1988 ""Doctor Who"" was a show with a long enough history that it could time travel into its own past, and yet a fine enough show that it could do so and still be fresh and engaging rather than musty. ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" brings the Doctor and his relatively new companion Ace back to the old London junkyard where it all started back in 1963, and countless little continuity references and in-jokes pepper the story throughout its four episodes. Sometimes this can bog a story down and be confusing for new viewers, but here anyway these pitfalls are avoided--though they cleverly add an extra level of significance for the long-time viewer, they are pretty much unobtrusive so that the story flows coherently without an encyclopedic knowledge of ""Doctor Who"" lore. Except for the biggest continuity reference of all, the Doctor's arch-enemies (also vintage 1963) the remembrance of whom give this storyline its title. They require a little explanation, and that's exactly what the viewer gets in the first episode as the Doctor recaps for Ace more than two decades of Dalek background in a few seconds laced with hilarious comedy while hurtling down the road in a ""borrowed"" military van. And so a plot device that could've been static, stale, and boring is in fact ingeniously rendered dynamic, fresh, and engaging for old-timer and newbie alike. Just one more example of why the longest-running sci-fi series on our planet just never gets old.

Actually, the Daleks are really at their best here in a way we haven't seen for a long while, and not just because of the revamped special effects making their death rays look more deadly and finally granting them full conquest of the staircase obstacle (which made the poor devils seem so ineffectual back in ""Destiny of the Daleks""). In fact, I suspect their recovered evil luster is probably related to the fact that the withering presence of Davros is absent until his disappointing and slightly anti-climatic appearance in the last episode, his last diminishing return in the show's history (knock on wood!). No, for the vast majority of the story the Daleks are the principle villains--two warring factions of them, in fact, which adds a wicked twist to an old tune while picking up the melody where ""Revelation of the Daleks"" left off. But Imperial or Renegade, the Daleks are again portrayed as ruthless and deadly, manipulating human victims through mechanical implants when not exterminating them dead on sight and without warning, and all according to their own malevolent initiative and according to their own sinister masterplan. Once again the Daleks really feel like a serious menace, and the story is superbly thrilling as a result. The special-weapons Dalek is also a nice touch, though he's a bit heavy-handed--um, well, heavy-turreted rather.

More to the point, this is indubitably a ""Dalek"" story rather than merely a story featuring the Daleks. What I mean is that the characteristic xenophobia of the Daleks is seriously foregrounded on multiple levels, both as their primary motivation as characters--even their internecine warfare is due to the fact that ""they hate each other's chromosomes""--and as the overall theme of the storyline, the point of the tale as it were. Daleks, such sublimely logical creatures and yet their actions are motivated by that most irrational of urges: hatred of those different from themselves. For this they will conquer, enslave, and murder without pity. Kind of sounds like human beings on a bad day, doesn't it, and many aspects of the plotline and script explore the ""Dalek"" in us all, and yet cleverly within the specific historical context of British society in the 1960's. That such is the overarching theme of ""Remembrance"" is signaled to the attentive viewer in a rather magnificently subtle fashion by a dramatic pre-title sequence (somewhat unusual for the show's format during its classic run): you see a close-up shot of the Earth in its entirety while hearing 1960's radio waves emanating from our globe into space, the first of which goes ""Our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet, we all breathe the same air, and we all cherish our children's future..."" and goes on to Martin Luther King's famous ""I have a dream"" speech even as a Dalek spacecraft lumbers menacingly into view ""Star Destroyer"" style, closing in on its blue-green target. Positively chilling. This is one thing great science fiction always does: explore the human through the alien, the familiar through the fantastic, the present through the future. This is also a hallmark of ""Doctor Who"" throughout the years, one big reason why we can look past lame special effects and minor flaws time and time again and enjoy this show year after year.

Of course another reason the show never gets old is that the Doctor regenerates time and time again, giving the main character a new face and style each time and giving a new actor a chance to craft his own spin on our favorite centuries-old vagabond of a renegade Time Lord. ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" in fact marks the opening of Sylvester McCoy's second season in the role, but still it's the earliest story of his tenure to make it to DVD thus far. What are we to make of his take on the Doctor? How are we to judge the Doctor in his seventh incarnation? Well, maybe the high quality of his enemies gives him a boost here, but this here seems to be the real...oh never mind, that's a wretchedly predictable pun, but still true in so far as it goes. He has a masterful (""doctorful""?) grasp of the character's underlying personality traits, magnifying many of them while giving them all his own particular imprint: Delightfully eccentric, bumblingly curious, wonderfully arrogant, deeply ethical but not ostentatiously so, sarcastically compassionate, highly irreverent, likeably alien--a goofy mastermind (""doctormind""? okay okay enough) starkly out of place and yet cozily right at home anywhere and anywhen he goes. McCoy's timing and delivery are often spot on, too, convincingly making sudden shifts from comedic to serious mode and back again. At his most deeply serious, there's what I now personally consider a mostly overlooked high point of the show's long history, a deeply reflective scene with him at a late-night cafe chatting with the guy at the register about the course of history and cause & effect and all, meditating (as we realize later) on the enormity and potential consequences of what he's preparing to effect through the most cunningly poker-faced guile: the total and utter extermination of the Daleks along with their entire solar system. I never thought that the fourth Doctor's classic ""Have I the right?"" scene from ""Genesis of the Daleks"" might have anything close to a rival, but what that one accomplishes on an dramatically epic scale this one does in a hauntingly quiet register that's almost (almost, I say) as effective and in some ways more moving actually. ""Every large decision creates ripples,"" he comments thoughtfully, and yet this time, this time thank goodness, the Doctor doesn't hesitate!",1188691200,4,7105,4.999155405405405
1674720,4,B00005Y6XI,"""Remembrance of the Daleks,"" considered by many to be one of the best McCoy stories, is pretty good.  It attempts to make the entire series up to that point come full circle for the twenty-fifth anniversary of Who.  No anniversary celebration would be complete without the good Doctor's greatest (and most loved by fans) enemies--the Daleks.  In this tale we find the Doctor and Ace back where William Hartnell was so many years before them and the ""Professor"" has returned to finish what he started.  Two warring factions of Daleks have come to Earth to do what they do best:  exterminate.  They've also come to collect a device to aid them in their time-hopping destruction.  The Doctor, Ace, and some well-meaning humans combine forces to stop them.  The only problem is that there are a few in their ranks who can't be trusted.  Will the Doctor and Ace be able to figure out who's who before one of the Dalek factions grabs hold of the Eye of Omega?  ""Who"" knows?

This particular adventure has plenty of action and mystery in it to keep the viewer interested.  McCoy and Sophie Aldred (Ace) have great chemistry on the screen, and that makes the story even more enjoyable.  While many see McCoy as one of the worst incarnations of the Doctor around, I like him just fine.  He, along with the writers, explores the Doctor's darker side that seems to have originated with Patrick Troughton's Doctor and came through even more with Colin Baker's turn as the Time Lord.  Aldred, full of youthful exuberance, steals most of the scenes that she is in.  She's given a love interest in this tale that allows us to see Ace go from bat-wielding tomboy to blushing beauty.  The rest of the cast gives solid performances as well.

As with all of the original ""Who"" tales, the show suffers from bad special effects.  To many, including myself, these subpar effects actually make the show more enjoyable.  In this particular adventure, however, they become annoying at times.  This is best highlighted by the wobbly, jittery movements of the Daleks.  It's hard to believe that the fiercest enemy of the Doctor suffers from a bad set of shocks.

The DVD, much like all of the DVDs in the original series' catalogue, comes with some great commentary from the Doctor and his companion, a fun blooper reel, a Who's Who feature on the primary actors in the show and multi-angle scenes.

Look beyond the lumbering movements of the Daleks and you've got one of the better Doctor Who adventures in ""Remembrance of the Daleks.""  Fans of the original series will be glad to see the old Doctor in all of his glory.  For those of you who only know the Doctor from the new series, you're in for a treat.",1186531200,5,2681,4.651063829787234
1674721,2,B00005Y6XI,"You used to always be able to count on the Daleks and the Cybermen to liven up an otherwise boring season, but not in this case.  The production team went too far in making the Doctor something more special than he was originally intended to be.  For most of his time as a renegade Time Lord, the Doctor was just that, an outcast from his society trying to do good in the universe.  But the 7th Doctor was put forward as something like a god among the Time Lords.  In Remembrance of the Daleks, he tells Davros that he is the Lord President of Gallifrey!  How did this happen?  Where did that come from?  True, the Doctor was elected President in The Invasion of Time, but he abdicated the position.  True, he was elected again at the end of The Five Doctors, but he fled from Gallifrey, a de facto abdication confirmed in the Trial of a Time Lord.  The production team said that too much had been revealed about the Doctor over time and they wanted to introduce more mystery into the character, but it truly did NOT work!  It added an untenable stream of discontinuity into the show.  One more gripe: If the writers and producers wanted to pay homage to the early days of the show by going back to Totter's Yard, they should have left Davros out of the script!  Davros was so used and abused after Genesis of the Daleks that he totally detracted from the episodes he appeared in after Genesis.  No one could play him like Michael Wisher making him an unbelievable character!  Remembrance of the Daleks stands as one of the worst examples of Dr. Who, outdone only by the other tripe put out during his tenure as the Doctor.

UPDATE: I recently viewed the ""what if"" commentary on the DVD release of Survival.  I never thought I'd say this, but thank God they canceled the program!  The commentary on the Survival DVD explains why the Doctor was made out to be more than he was originally intended to be - it was by design.  The Script Editor Andrew Cartmel had decided that the Doctor needed to be more mysterious, that too much of his past and origins had been revealed.  To this end, he was basically written as someone involved in the creation of the time travel facility of Gallifrey, someone crucial to Gallifreyan history, as one of three Gallifreyans responsible for the creation of the Time Lords.  Obviously not much of this was revealed in the scripts.  How ridiculous!  None of this works with the series history and it just shows how out of touch the WHO team was by the end of the 1980s and how JNT had lost control of the series.  Remembrance of the Daleks is a prime example (though not the best example - see Time and the Rani, Greatest Show in the Galaxy and almost any other McCoy serial) of why the show had to go!",1174262400,8,2732,4.409181636726547

They changed the entire background of the Doctor during this era, going from a mere timelord who absconded with a TARDIS from Gallifrey to a near God-like figure.  I can't understand how this is acceptable in the minds of some people.  Why is it that they have a problem with the 6th Doctor shooting Cyberman and asphyxiating a sadistic killer like Shockeye but are ok with McCoy's manipulating Davros into destroying his own Daleks?

He certainly had the worst writers for his stories. That being said, ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" is one of his ""best"" stories. The plot is a bit confusing, but less so than other 7th Doctor stories. The story is also a bit forced. The writers at this point were unable to write a Dalek story without including Davros and when watching this episode you get the feeling they are forcing him into the script. Other than that, it is a great platform for McCoy's Doctor. His Doctor's personality is at full strength. The chemistry between he and Ace (Sophie Aldred) is firmly established.

Despite some superficial glitz, the production, often mentioned as a highlight, is bad. The daleks look slow, tottery, very fake and their voices don't sound right. The renegade dalek faction apparently seem to have picked up a time-travelling device in a homewares gift-shop and Davros sits in a little painted sphere, draped with wires. People often mention the 'eyestalk' view in the first junkyard scene as being a strong point but this is so amateurish as to be pathetic, looking more like an eighties computer game and a bad one at that.

Sylvester McCoy was not Doctor Who. In fact, the whole series should never have been resuscitated after the sixth doctor fell over. Why can't we let these things rest in peace and enjoy them as they were, rather than trying to milk them dry to the very end? - a lack of imagination, I guess. But I digress.

As well as making the daleks completely idiotic, Davros finally completes his 'mutation' from the intelligent, cunning and ruthless shell of a man from 'Genesis' to the hammed-up villain he finds himself here, lurching from one ridiculous escape to another.

What's more, remember how the Doctor, frustrating but true to character, would struggle to kill his enemies when given the chance? (Genesis, Resurrection) Well in this story he seems to think nothing of sending the entire Skaro system into oblivion.

While on the other hand, McCoy's characterisation seems to lack the edge and authenticity of any of his predecessors. I'm sure he's a nice guy - maybe too nice?

Anyway, stay away from this story - a token revisitation upon the dalek myth which tries so hard to please but infuriates even more. Enough!",1119312000,9,2004,4.7277936962750715
1674728,4,B00005Y6XI,"Calling this one of the better Sylvester McCoy stories -- a repertoire that includes suck dreck as ""Delta and the Bannermen"" -- isn't saying much, but McCoy displays a charm and effectiveness that belies the oft-horrific dialogue he was saddled with. I actually enjoyed his Doctor more than Peter Davison or Tom Baker, and I thought ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" was superior to ""Genesis,"" ""Destiny"" [one of the worst Dalek stories IMHO], and ""Ressurection."" The audio commentary is nice as well. Would have liked to have seen a few more Sly episodes... if he had succeeded Davison, the show might had never been cancelled.",1107561600,7,621,4.980769230769231
1674729,5,B00005Y6XI,"Having been a Doctor Who fan for over twenty years, I only recently had the opportunity to view Remembrance of the Daleks. What a story! At last, the Daleks have special effects befitting the would-be conquerors of the universe. The plot is fantastic and fast-paced, and slyly ties back to the original story, and has numerous other references to the series' 26-year history. This is one story that I was sorry to see end, and anxiously awaited a couple of days to pass so I could watch again (with a minimum of complaint from my wife!). This is easily one of the best Doctor Who stories ever, and as far as I'm concerned, it's a very close second to Genesis of the Daleks. Sylvester McCoy (my favorite!) is excellent here, adding more mystery to a character who epitomies mystery! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1104451200,6,801,4.6879432624113475
1674730,2,B00005Y6XI,"Wow,  If this story-line really is among the best of the Sylvester McCoy years, I completely understand why Doctor Who was cancelled after his third season.
No fault with McCoy, really, although his portrayal of the doctor as a caustic misanthrope certainly didn't help my enjoyment of the program, but neither did it seem utterly heretical, as did the story's major flaws.  I am a big fan of the series leading up to the Peter Davison era and what I find most enjoyable about the show during these years is its ability to tell a riveting Sci-Fi tale despite the hinderances of a low budget (namely the shoddy effects and cobbled together sets.)  Pre-1980's Doctor Who  relied on the strengths of the BBC, excellent writing and acting, and managed to consistently present an entertaining, interesting story.
Not so, I'm afraid, with ""Remembrance of the Daleks."" Well crafted plot has been jettisoned in favor of hollow action scenes,  actor driven suspense has been buried beneath an obtrusive synth-rock score, and the viewer is left with a superficial mess with all the charm of an ABC After School Special.
Based on the worth of the story alone, this product deserves only one star.  However, I've given it two because the DVD has many interesting extras, including a commentary that almost makes it possible to sit through all four episodes, and, well, I think the ""Special Weapons"" Dalek was actually pretty cool.",1068508800,10,1418,4.912133891213389
1674731,5,B00005Y6XI,"The story is absolutely excellant, and has an epic feel to it, depicting large-scale plot details, such as the Hand of Omega etc.
The Daleks themselves look superb. Their guns are very convincing. They are smooth and shiny on the outside, but green, slimy, and wonderfully icky on the inside.
One of my favourite scenes is where the casing has been destroyed, but a dark green claw lunges out...Wonderfull.
The scenes near the beginning, when the Dalek is looking at the soldiers through its gun seem to be influenced by Predator (a great idea), and the music here is deliciously ominous.
Aaronovitch seems to have deliberately tried to make this story something monumental, because not only does he depict the Doctor trying to wipe out the Daleks once and for all, but he also proves that DALEKS CAN CLIMB STAIRS! SO STOP THAT FLIPPING STUPID JOKE!!! AAAAARRRRRGGGHH!!!!
McCoy is simply fantastic as the Doctor. He is sometimes grossly underrated. One person on the internet actually said he was the worst actor to take the part. YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE! AND I WILL HAVE MY VENGEANCE! AARRGHH!
It's a bit of a cliche, but his Doctor closely resembles Patrick Troughton's in his humour,  and his manipulative ways. Alright, it's a masive cliche, but I digress.
All of the acting is very good.
The cover art on this this American release of the DVD is lush. It isn't on the British one.
I can't really say much more that hasn't been said already. Ben Aaronovitch's story reveals Doctor Who at its very best, the extras are sumptously bountiful, the comentary by McCoy and Aldred being the best extra, and just about everything about the whole disk is excellant.
Now go and read the other reviews.",1064016000,4,1692,4.755102040816326
1674732,5,B00005Y6XI,"Even the very title, REMEMBRANCE OF THE DALEKS, suggest that nostalgia is going to play a big part in the story.  This breakthrough 1988 episode by Ben Aaronovitch once again pits the Doctor against his oldest enemies, and for a Doctor Who serial, the scripting is unusually fast-paced, with not only an inordinate amount of action and better-than-average visual effects, but also some very well-developed characters and unexpected surprises.
Sylvester McCoy has by now very firmly established himself as the Doctor and kicks off his second season by re-introducing an air of mystery to the role.  Just when the fans thought they knew everything there was to know about their hero, along come some new plot twists and hushed moments of dialogue to turn the Almighty God Of Plot Continuity on its head.  New companion Ace (Sophie Aldred) wastes no time in establishing her rapport with ""The Professor,"" and the two of them are already forging a partnership that will be the best-loved duo since the days of Tom Baker's Doctor and Elisabeth Sladen's Sarah Jane Smith.
More than a mere hat-tip to the series' own pilot episode, REMEMBRANCE actually returns to 1963 London and familiar settings last seen haunted by William Hartnell's incarnation of the first Doctor: to include Coal Hill School (including some prominent scenes in the Chemistry lab), and Foreman's junkyard in Totter's Lane.  The long-standing question of just exactly what the Doctor was originally DOING here is finally answered as two warring schisms of Daleks emerge out of space-time and begin the all-out battle that viewers have been waiting for since 1984's REVELATION OF THE DALEKS.  The Daleks somehow don't quite come off as terrifying as audiences may remember them; despite their murderous ways and their unending grating screams of ""Exterminate,"" they present more like long-absent friends than the ultimate threat to the universe.  Even the ""Emperor"" Dalek, last seen in 1967's EVIL OF THE DALEKS, has undergone a makeover in the style of the old Dalek cereal box comics.
More central to the story, however, is the wonderful character development and the repeated emphasis on racism.  Sophie Aldred's 1990's teen spirit is justifiably thrown off by the ways of the early 1960's --besides being baffled by the old English monetary system, she runs up against harsher realities such as the ""No Coloureds"" sign in the window of the boarding house run by Mike's mother.  From this we can guess where Mike (Durslet McClinton, in a tragically handsome romantic foil for Ace) soaked up his ""look out for your own"" attitude, and how that idealism in turn caught fire with Ratcliffe (George Sewell) who once found himself at the wrong ideological end of what passed for ""patriotism"" in World War II.  Ratcliffe's resentment has brought him into a reckless partnership with the renegade Dalek faction, who are themselves in turn despised by the ""racially pure"" Imperial Daleks.  (Ace's deep revulsion to racist attitudes will be more fully explored in the later episode GHOST LIGHT.)
REMEMBRANCE launches Doctor Who into its final triumphant run on BBC --Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred shepherded the series through its two final seasons with some of its best-ever writing and production values (which, alas, would not be enough to save the series from its ultimate cancellation by the Beeb in 1990).  McCoy's unreadable ""man of mystery"" performance is first glimpsed in this episode, mostly in form of hints and verbal slips that do not go unnoticed by Ace.  The grander backstory of the Time Lords is widened out as well, and there are quite a few references to past episodes that longtime fans will enjoy.  The  script even manages a couple of gags at the series' own expense, as well as providing a plausible ""early origins"" basis for the secret military agency that will later be known as U.N.I.T.  Simon Williams' Captain Gilmore appears to be played mostly for comic effect in a kind of exaggerated foreshadowing of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart.  The performances by Pamela Salem as Rachel and Karen Gledhill as Alison go a long way towards solidifying the ""peacetime chaos"" that was English society in the early 60's.  The opening pre-credits shot of the Dalek mothership looming over an unsuspecting Earth is brilliantly accented by a background babble of 1960's media sound bytes, to include speeches by John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King.
Besides some hilarious commentary by McCoy and Aldred that demonstrates just how closely the two worked together during their time in the series, the DVD has cleaned up the eternal problem of Doctor Who background music dampening out the dialogue.  Special Features are little more than the obligatory biographies, blooper outtakes, and alternate camera angles of two effects sequences --not all it's cracked up to be.  Aaronovitch clearly has some big shoes to fill (this being the first Dalek serial in the series NOT directed by Dalek creator Terry Nation), and he carries it off very well.  No character (least of all Ace) is left standing around looking for something to do, the story's pacing proceeds at a comfortable rate with very little filler, there are a number of total surprises (even to hardcore fans who think they already know all about Doctor Who), and of course plenty of action scenes with lots of Daleks going kerboom.  Definitely one of McCoy's best outings as the Doctor, as well as the best Dalek serial ever (with the possible exception of 1974's GENESIS OF THE DALEKS).  This episode occupies a place in my own personal Top Ten list of Greatest Doctor Who Stories Ever.",1061164800,26,5621,5.047516198704104
1674733,4,B00005Y6XI,"Ah, the seventh Doctor. Loved by some and hated by many, the dying days of Doctor Who (1986-1989) were undeniably full of hits and misses. ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" remains one of the better stories of this era, stronger in dialogue and plotting than many of the others. The outstanding performance of Sylvester McCoy, who at last keeps the pantomime to a minimum, the impressive action sequences, and the emphasis on drama over comic book melodramatics also help to make this a respectable outing. Unfortunately, the story relies so heavily on continuity from the past that it will be inscrutable to non-fans. There's also some predictable story elements and cliches (Davros escapes in an escape pod again?) that make for a lackluster conclusion, but overall, this is a satisfying adventure.
Tremendous credit is due as always to The Doctor Who Restoration Team for the extra features. In addition to commentary from the lead actors, there's also some amusing outtakes and fascinating deleted scenes (though the latter might have been better if included in the program). And with production information text, alternate camera angles, and episode trailers this disc, like all Doctor Who DVDs, is an outstanding value.",1053820800,,1219,5.192893401015229
1674734,4,B00005Y6XI,"Since the string of DVD releases began `properly' with ""The Robots of Death"" in 2000, the stories selected have been classics, ones that - with little exception - will be praised by the fans as a whole, provided they like that Doctor's era to begin with. One of the most obvious choices is that of ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" as the first Sylvester McCoy release. It's not that ""Remembrance"" is considered the best McCoy adventure; however, it has a sort of generic action-adventure feel and relative lightness of heart that keeps the regular fan from feeling alienated or confused, unlike those stories. Therefore, this is likely to be the McCoy DVD that appeals to the most fans overall, and I can well see the logic.
Upon starting the story, it is instantly apparent that this DVD boasts the clearest picture yet seen on a Doctor Who DVD. Detail is excellent, black level spot-on, picture blemish-free, and colours very vibrant and true - the colours seem more...well...colourful than on the videocassette. Unless I'm greatly mistaken, ""Remembrance"" was shot entirely on video, unlike most ""Doctor Who"", and the consistent nature of the quality makes it easier to concentrate upon the story. Sound is also quite admirable; while the dialogue is very good, music and SFX are both astoundingly clear (again, somewhat unexpectedly so). It's unfortunate that a 5.1 mix couldn't be had, but I am more than willing to settle for this 2.0 track.
Merits of the story aside, it is obvious from putting the disc into the player that this will be a fun DVD. The thing is choc-a-bloc with extra features, including items well-known among the fan community but never released commercially. The ""Extended and Deleted Scenes"" are a collection of thirteen very interesting cut sequences, ranging from an extended version of the caf discussion, to the famous ""more than just an ordinary Time Lord"" lines. These are in every bit as good a shape as the actual episodes, having obviously been sourced from a high-quality format and cleaned up as appropriate. Other interesting extras include the original trailers for episodes 1 and 2, an isolated track of the musical score, cast biographies, and production trivia subtitles. Regrettably, the included commentary - featuring lead actors Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred - is rather dull and entirely skippable, focusing mostly on working with other actors and shooting on location (which merely regurgitates a lot of the production subtitle track). The remaining features, such as an outtakes reel, aren't actually that high on the entetainment scale either, but they're worth viewing at least once.
Don't take me wrong; despite a few lacklustre extras, this is definitely a keeper of a disc. If you like ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" you will certainly want, and enjoy, the quality DVD presentation. It is becoming increasingly clear just how fortunate we Doctor Who fans are to have such marvelous DVDs of a cult TV programme; hey, take a gander at the Star Trek discs in comparison. Here's looking at many more fantastic Who releases to come.",1037923200,5,3078,5.037254901960784

This is Sophie Aldred's (Ace) first full story with Sylvester McCoy as the Doctor, and she plays such a wonderful new companion. The chemistry between Sophie and Sylvester is great, and you can see they picked the right person to play Ace.
The Daleks have more powers than they had before, but you'd be impressed to see what they can do now, that they couldn't do in Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker/Peter Davison and Colin Baker eras.

1674739,4,B00005Y6XI,"This is a Doctor Who adventure I thought that I would never buy.
After the departure of Tom Baker, I along with many others, waited to see what the new Doctor would turn out to be like. Peter Davison, was a nice enough chap but never quite made it as the Doctor. When Colin Baker took over, that was it for me. I was not impressed by Sylvestor McCoy at first either and resumed other activities.
With this story I received a call from a friend urging me to give him a second chance as Remembrance of the Daleks looked like a pretty good story and it was set in the original junkyard. Oh yes, he said, and you will like Ace.
This was to be the turning point and I became an avid viewer once more. There is not much I can add to the content of the other reviews here (aside from the fact that I liked the Chase) but I am in agreement that this is certainly an excellent McCoy story and one of the best Dalek stories to be transmitted.
Not too long after this, I took a party of students to visit Longleat where there just happened to be a Doctor Who exhibition on.

A good story, lots of action, with a somewhat weak ending.  This episode also adds some mystery to the Doctor: Is he a contemporary of Omega? IS he Omega?

(I hope.) Remembrance was far and away one of the the best Dalek stories ever, ranking with the original Daleks and the Invasion Earth story. The extras alone make it worth the price of admission with two seperate trailers, audio commentary, deleted scenes and multi-angle shots of Ace in the climatic firefight scene at the end of episode two.

All I kept thinking was that Sylvester McCoy really could have used a good cleaning for his teeth, especially with all of the close-ups he was given.

1674743,5,B00005Y6XI,"The Doctor's 25th anniversary season starts off with a bang with the instant classic, ""Remembrance of the Daleks.""  If you're a Who fan, this is where the McCoy years go from mediocre to great and never look back.
The story takes Who back to it's roots--and the junkyard of Totter's Lane where we first met the Doctor. This time around, the Daleks are there, having pursued the Doctor to gain access to the Hand of Omega, a stellar manipulator the Doctor ""borrowed"" when he left his home world. But what the Doctor didn't count on was that two factions of Daleks would show up in 1963 London to claim this prize. Or did he?
The Doctor/companion team of Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred really gels here into one of the best the show has seen. The script by Ben Aaronovich is smart, fast-paced and puts a new spin on the ""typical"" Dalek storyline. All that and after 25 years, the Daleks finally get the ablity to go up stairs (in one of the BEST cliffhangers in all Who history).
But it's the extras on a DVD that make it worth the price of admission and, once again, the BBC is up to the task.  Remembrance features a good commentary by Aldred and McCoy, a couple of deleted scenes (they're nice but you can see why they were left out) and some bloopers.  All in all, the extras are good, though not as strong as Caves of Androzani.
That said, Remembrance of the Daleks is yet another stellar Who entry on DVD and one that fans should consider a must-have.  New fans will enjoy it as well, though you may be thrown by the Dalek history referenced throughtout the show.

1674745,5,B00005Y6XI,"This story is terrific fun. It is amongst the all time greats of Doctor Who. I would probably give the story 4 stars, but overall the package rates 5 stars.
First, the commentary with Sylvester McCoy & Sophie Aldred is quite good. They seem to remember a great deal about the production and reveal some facts about the story that I didn't know.
Second, the deleted scenes section is quite extensive. Most of the scenes are very good, and it's too bad that some of the scenes weren't in the story that was broadcast. There are, of course, a few bits that would have slowed down the story if they had been left in. The extended version of the scene with the Doctor having a mug of tea in the cafe is particularly good. There are also a few 'bloopers' which are pretty amusing, as well as a trailer for part 1 of the story.
Third, The production subtltles feature that I enjoyed very much on 'Spearhead from Space' returns on this release, as well as on the other new North American release, 'Caves of Androzani'. It's a bit like 'Pop Up Video' Doctor Who style. It would be nice to see more US feature releases would use this feature. New Line's Infinifilm line uses a similar feature, which is nice. The production subtitles are full of neat little facts, some of which I knew, but many which I didn't.
'Remembrance of the Daleks' is a terrific Doctor Who adventure. The visual effects are top notch and will knock the socks off of those folks who think of Doctor Who as 'cheap'. The story isn't terribly deep and meaningful, although it does touch on such issues as racial prejudice and how the little decisions we make can make a huge difference on the future.
In my opinion, this is the best Dalek story since 'Genesis of the Daleks' and really adds some new twists to the Daleks' continuity. I particularly like the revelation about Davros in episode 4. And that Episode 1 cliffhanger is a beauty.
Terrific performances by Sylv and Sophie, along with Simon Williams of Upstairs Downstairs fame and George Sewell, who was in Gerry Anderson's UFO series.",1019520000,3,2055,4.556756756756757

An earlier incarnation of the Doctor had left the Hand of Omega, a Time Lord device of amazing power, hidden in plain sight. The Daleks want it for the power; The Doctor wants to keep it out the hands of the Daleks...or does he?

The story has nice bits of cleverness as the Doctor tries to get his plan to come off. He's assisted by Ace, a 1980s girl who makes her own explosives and carries around a baseball bat and a boom box. When a Dalek tries to eliminate her, she doesn't shriek for the Doctor's help. She gets the bat out! She is a refreshing change for a classic female companion to the Doctor. The episode also has lots of big, credible-looking explosions (how else can you kill a Dalek?) and is otherwise on the high end of the BBC's production values. McCoy's wit and physicality are put to great use, especially when he confronts the Dalek leader. The blend of fun and drama is near perfect.
