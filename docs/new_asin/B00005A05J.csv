7934550,5,B00005A05J,"My first youthful impression of this film was not favourable and I knew very little about Paradjanov, many years ago.
I have seen it twice within three weeks of recently purchasing it. It is a simple story told with the camera placed before the cast and they play their roles as the camera observes from a stationary position. The detail of the settings, costumes, rugs, curtains, brassware, pottery, birds, farm animals, all give the visual aspect much richness. The bonus extras give interesting information into the life of Paradjanov and if watched first, help you understand his individual art of the cinema.",1368489600,,613,5.019607843137255

7934552,5,B00005A05J,"This is a beautiful movie about a fortress that keeps collapsing and a man who abandons his first love, who becomes a fortuneteller and predicts that the only way to save the fortress is to have the son of her faithless lover bricked up alive in the walls.  The movie itself is richer than the plot, though, as it gives a feeling of the wide-open spaces of ancient Georgia and the rich interaction of cultures there.  I was impressed by the way in which Christianity and Islam are shown as coexisting and even intertwining rather than as enemies.

The features are quite good too.  The interview with Paradjanov's wife Svetlana Scherbatyuk is very interesting, and the translation is better than for some of the documentaries on other DVDs in this box set.  There's another woman in the documentary who I assume is Paradjanov's second wife, although she's never identified, which is a bit frustrating.  There's a short documentary on the great Georgian tragic actress Veriko Andzhaparidze, who also was in Repentance, as well as an impressive b & w short on ""The Architecture of Ancient Georgia,"" which is an evocative look at some of the locations in the film and several other examples of Georgian architecture. The photo album and filmographies round it off nicely.

I'd definitely recommend that people watch this, with the understanding that this isn't Hollywood and has little in common with your run-of-the-mill realist movies.  For those who love cinema, it's worth it.",1273795200,3,1477,4.951417004048583
7934553,1,B00005A05J,"I'm tired of Kino productions that only slap the first negative they find onto DVD format and put it on the market. I know these won't sell well, but could you at least try and restore the negative a LITTLE bit? Ashik Kerib is so blurry at times it's a disgrace to Parajanov's memory, not to mention difficult to watch. The gaudy green title cards in English that look like they were done as a junior high computer class project are also worth singling out for criticism.
No special features, nothing. Oh, and the irremovable, burned-onto-the-negative subtitles are simply inexcusable in this day and age of DVD production.
Ironically, the only way to tell Kino that you want them to work harder on their releases is by buying this.
There is, however, an alternative. Ruscico, the Russian Cinema Council, has put both of these wonderful films on DVD at a reasonable price, with a clear, sharp, restored negative that puts Kino's release to utter shame, and REMOVABLE subtitles!
Search for it online. The only drawback is the unremovable russian voice-over on the Legend of Surami Fortress DVD. Otherwise, skip the Kino, and get those. These beautiful films are worth it.",1069632000,20,1170,4.855
7934554,5,B00005A05J,"Paradjanov invented his own unique film language.
THE LEGEND OF SURAM FORTRESS is simply one of the greatest film experiences I've had. This surreal story of the sacrifice of a man to build a fortress is told in the tableaux style Paradjanov first used in the brilliant ""Color of Pomegranates"". Stunning visuals and a special treatment of georgian influenced music to make one of the most gripping music scores I can recall. This film is really special.
ASHIK KERIB is an extraordinary fairytale telling the odyssey of a wandering minstrel. Kerib tries to earn enough money to marry the girl he loves. This time Paradjanov's visual style is more dynamic, and the film's subject is brighter than usual. Highly visual, eccentric and surreal.
To finally get access to some of Paradjanov's films on DVD is great. I do think the quality of the transfer could have been better though. The color contrast seems a bit too low, and clearly nothing has been done to all the traces of dust and hair on the film. The subtitles are unremovable and a bit dominating in the frame at times. But the magic of the films is still there, this package is worth buying to grasp that. Paradjanov's films might not be everyones cup of tea, but if you're into film poetry in the field of great directors like Tarkovsky and Sokurov, treated in a unique style, then SEE THEM.",996796800,20,1348,4.69198312236287
7934555,5,B00005A05J,"Almost 15 years after shooting his greatest masterpiece ""Colors of pomegranates"", after suffering accusations, spending years in prisons and concentrations camps, Parajanov finally returns with ""The Legend of Souram Fortress"". His first two movies were shot in Ukraine and Armenia respectively, this one was a work of GruziaFilm (Republic of Georgia). Here the action takes place in medieval Georgia. The last wall around the Souram fortress constantly collapses no matter what the builders try to... A spurned woman denied be the man she loves makes a prophecy and advises the prince who abandoned her to bury his son in the walls of Suram Fortress to protect it during a siege. According to the prophecy the only way to complete the wall around the fortress is to immure the hero into the wall.
Parajanov's worldwide success came ""Shadows of forgotten ancestors"" and ""Colors of pomegranates"" in 60's. While this movie didn't achieve the similar success, it's till among the must-haves for any follower of Parajanov's talent.",986860800,8,1026,5.224242424242425
