Institute Benjamenta was visually amazing and the musical score along with it haunting. It is hard to compare with their collection. Definitely a must-see but I did start to lose interest towards the end.  Maybe this type of cinema is better in short films. Their next project should be a collection of short films with real actors.  I hope that they continue to produce!",1011312000,2,474,4.686746987951807
7891256,3,6305537410,"Okay, so this film has almost no narrative and the characters are as flat as cardboard.  I knew that going in and I still enjoyed it.  Why?  Well, some movies you just can't watch as narrative experiences, they exist by a different set of rules.  As I was watching I realised that the most interesting thing was the movement of the actors.  There was a lot of choreography involved, so much so, that I came to realise it was more of an elaborate peformance piece than a film (think Pina Bausch).  There isn't much to interpret, but then, there usually isn't in a dance, you just enjoy the motion.  Also noteworthy is the lighting and the use of moving spotlights to animate the setting.  The characters are awash in light of various qualities, some spectral, some soft.  The set decoration and production design are also wonderful, always something to look at in every frame.  The camera movements are odd and quixotic, just like in any Quay Brothers film.  The performances, especially those of Gottfried John and Alice Krige, are nicely articulated, given that they contain only the merest whiffs of character development.  All in all, this is a lovely piece of visual poetry. Watch it in bed and let it waft past you.",978566400,14,1220,4.676056338028169
