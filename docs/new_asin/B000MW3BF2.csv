8173146,5,B000MW3BF2,"The multi-angle feature and the fun no-nonsense style of this DVD makes it the best buy of all similar products. This DVD is very clear to follow. Clear pictures, clear sound and you can see it from 3 different angles. i have not seen it anywhere else. The music is also great.",1351987200,,277,4.346153846153846
8173147,2,B000MW3BF2,"I purchased this video when I was starting out with Salsa Danncing in 2009.  There are some good things to the video and many bad things about the video.  The good is that I liked the multi-angles.  I like the clear instructions.  Now the bad.  The video does not count the correct steps for Salsa.  She counts only six steps.  Yes, there are only six steps, but there are 8 beats to any Salsa music.  That means that she forgets about the 2 pauses, the 4 beat and the 8 beat.  In social dancing, the name of the move is not called.  The guy has to lead the girl into the pattern or move.  There is no explanantion on how to lead a girl from one pattern to the next.

I am now an Intermediate Salsa Dancer, but she is teaching a style of Salsa that I do not recognize.  With the calling of the move, it more resembles Casino/Rueda than Salsa Dancing on 1, 2, or 6.  Also, the Basic Step is totally different than the Traditional Salsa Basic.  Now that I am more experienced, I might be able to understand the patterns and incorporate them into my Salsa Dancing.

For the True, Beginner Salsa Dancer, I would not waste my money on this product.  Overall, the video is of high quality and has some features that you will not find in other videos, but you will not find anybody dancing this style of Salsa.  At least not in the North East of the United States.  For the Intermediate/Advanced Salsa Dancers, you will be able to bypass a lot of the instuction in the beginning and maybe be able to use many of the patterns that are taught at the middle/end of the first disc and in discs 2 and 3.

I should have returned the product, but I was overseas at the time and I was afraid of a problem with returning a video from an overseas location.

This DVD could have been a great DVD if it taught Traditional Salsa Dancing.  I would download the Podcast, Addicted2Salsa by Anthony Persaud.  In these Podcasts, he teaches traditional Salsa Dancing on 1 and sometimes he shows the same step on 2.  The Podcasts are free, other than a request by Anthony to donate money to the cause of making High Quality Salsa Podcasts.",1335744000,,2112,4.302030456852792
8173148,5,B000MW3BF2,"Excellent product.  It's not easy to create danse DVDs which are instructive and a pleasure to watch, this one is great.
Delivered very quickly internationally.
Thanks.",1323734400,,168,5.461538461538462
8173149,5,B000MW3BF2,"I bought this because, I've worked through all the Salsa Crazy DVDs through intermediate 2 level (which btw are also excellent).  But it's been a while and I wanted something to spice up my salsa dancing some more.  So I tried this set and I'm very glad I did.

There's two caveats that might not make this a good choice for an absolute beginner buying in the US.  First, after the first few patterns on the beginner DVD, they basically do what in ballroom dance is called a ""change of feet"" for the guy.  This makes his footwork appear ""wrong"" for the way salsa is normally danced in the US (it's not wrong btw, it's just the style/culture of the people who made this DVD).  However, I've found that if you ignore this part, the patterns pretty much work out anyway.

Second, to me the patterns are demonstrated well enough -- but they aren't broken down and explained in the great detail that you'll find on something like the Salsa Crazy DVDs (which I'd highly recommend for absolute beginners through intermediate).  On these DVDs you need to be able to watch, and either understand it or else reverse engineer what they're doing.  That's probably more than the absolutely beginner is up for.

Personally I also find the woman, who narrates most of the steps, amusing to listen to.  She often says ""then you do this automatically"" while she's talking through patterns.  Which makes me laugh.  I want to know where she gets her partners, because when I dance salsa it seems like almost nothing happens ""automatically"".  But anyway....

But especially if you're dancing salsa in the US, and you're looking for some new ideas and patterns to work with, I found that especially the intermediate and advanced DVDs are loaded with stuff.  I'm still working through it all (note I have not looked at the team dance DVD yet, I've never seen anyone do that in the US), and quite pleased with it.  Lots to chew on and it'll take me a while to digest it all.

If you're an absolute beginner, go get the basics down somewhere else first, then come back to this one -- it's worth it.  If you're a more advanced salsa dancer in the US, this could open your mind up to a bunch of new possibilities.  It almost seems like they dance using two slots, running at 90 degree angles to each other.  I'd never seen it done quite that way before.

All in all I'm very glad I bought this, and would definitely buy it again given the chance.  Kudos to the people who made these DVDs.",1311379200,,2462,4.495495495495495
8173150,2,B000MW3BF2,"I think the steps are pretty cool, but they are absoutley horrible at teaching. I think they suck. How can someone make a video and not stop to show the steps step by step. I Would NOT recomend this to anyone new or experienced. There are way better instructional videos out on the market. DO NOT WASTE your money. TRY ""Dvida"" Instructional videos",1298246400,,347,4.523809523809524
8173151,5,B000MW3BF2,"This really helped refine my salsa skills. The teachers were fun to watch, the video production was so clear and good, and it really taught me how to salsa dance. I highly recommend it for new comers and people who want a review and learn more technique.",1228521600,,254,4.425531914893617
8173152,4,B000MW3BF2,"The multi-angle function is great - being able to switch between different angles during viewing is just brilliant. Gigi's instruction is nice and clear, Pedro complements her by jumping in and adding his 2 cents' worth from the leader's perspective. This is a very polished production as far as salsa DVDs are concerned, despite a few hiccups here and there (sometimes the cuts can be quite noticeable).

Glitches:

First off, the hyperlink [...] highlighted in the menu is a dead link. What a blooper.

Secondly, Gigi likes to call the moves - now, while this is fine for rueda it does not work for social dancing. Compounding to the problem is the fact that there is little mention about leading, which is a key aspect of salsa partnerwork.

Thirdly - and this is a MAJOR omission - the DVD makes absolutely NO MENTION of what type of salsa it is teaching, which is incredibly silly. LA/NY slot-style dancers won't like the feeling of being conned into buying this DVD.

One small gripe - Gigi's heels keep making that loud CLACK! CLACK! CLACK! sound all throughout the 3 DVDs. It becomes annoying after a while until you force yourself to ignore it.",1197331200,2,1153,4.7164179104477615
8173153,5,B000MW3BF2,"I'll have to be honest when I say I've always objected to instructional DVD's, of any kind. Why sit at home in front of your tv, often by yourself, to learn someting, you can learn in real life. The real world is more exciting, more fun and as I formerly thought, more efficient.
Now the day I decided I wanted to learn Salsa, I looked for the best Salsa clubs in town and went there twice that week, just to find out I really wasn't gonna be able to dance like this. I couldn't seem to find the logic and basics of this dance, which made it quite impossible to lead a woman.
So I gave in and got my very first instructional DVD and it was amazing. A lot cheaper than taking classes from beginner to advanced, very exciting since I did it together with my new girlfriend and after an hour I understood the logic and basics to Salsa completely.
The Quick and Dirty Guide to SALSA, is clear, efficient, covers about anything you need to know (I've asked an expert) and with the 3 different view angles defiinately the best purchase I've made in the last few years!",1182902400,8,1062,4.288557213930348
8173154,5,B000MW3BF2,This DVD set is amazing!  It can pretty much take you from two left feet to actually feeling confident on the dance floor.  The quality is better than any other instructional video I have watched (which led to a bunch of Telly awards).  The instructor is very clear and concise with some pep to go with it.  Obviously  nothing is a complete substitution for learning on the dance floor but practicing with this DVD made it so much easier. I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to learn or just sharpen their skills.,1181260800,4,520,4.48936170212766
