5579815,5,B00BCV3IN2,"As someone who has studied and written about life sciences since 1970, this was absolutely, gaspingly gorgeous.  It meant a lot to someone who remembers the first time we saw earth from space, as all the views of the planet are from satellites.  It may be a bit over the heads of young children, but even fourth grade and up would enjoy and learn.  I loved how the program tied together the effects of one system on other systems (geological, biological, chemical, magnetic, weather patterns, life forms).  Fascinating to learn what each satellite ""sees"" and measures down to the millimeter.  The imagry is gorgeous and makes technical examples easy to understand, such as the flow of cold water starting at Antarctica, its cycles northward, and how the water temperature affects weather patterns.  It's beautiful, educationsl, and entertaining.  Excellent quality compared to most natural science programs.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nova-Earth-From-Space/dp/B00BCV3IN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nova: Earth From Space</a>",1362528000,13,1066,6.0198675496688745
5579816,5,B00BCV3IN2,"I saw this on PBS, re-watched it online and had to pre-order the DVD. It is by far a near perfect science documentary about the planet we live on. The graphics, the music, the narration all combine with some really fascinating information about our world that seems more like a complex living entity than merely a ball of water and rock.",1361923200,9,337,4.540983606557377
5579817,5,B00BCV3IN2,"There is a lot of talk the ""oneness"" and ""connectedness"" of our universe, but I wonder if they are mostly understood as an abstractions or magical thinking by most people. This film depicts these concepts in a very practical way, yet capturing a startling beauty that is beyond the limits of our normal perception. This is science and technology interpreting reality in a way that is much more inspiring and fantastic than any science fiction or religion I have encountered.",1361491200,3,474,4.9375
5579818,5,B00BCV3IN2,"THis is by far the BEST Nova program I have watched.  I pre ordered.... I doubt that anyone will give it less than a 5...
If I could I would give it an 8 out of 5....

JUST as a follow up.  This Video is free to watch on PBS/Nova....  There is also a  DISCOVERY Version on Utube.  The discovery
version is NOT as good as the PBS version.  In fact the reason I can  follow the Discovery version  is because I watched the PBS version.
SO if they are BOTH available online , why did I pre order the PBS version.  I want to copy it to my IPAD.. The retinal display
is STUNNING...  So what are you waiting for ... ORDER NOW!!!!",1360972800,21,622,3.935483870967742
5579819,5,B00BCV3IN2,"""The Earth from Space""  is one of the best Nova productions ever.  It presents what we have learned about climate, ecology, geology and a host of other topics from satellites.  Stunning graphics show how Earth systems work in unison to make this home of ours function.  I knew a lot of the facts that were presented in the video but the graphics gave me an even clearer picture of how things coordinate.  I am purchasing this one because it is so amazing.",1360800000,25,455,4.5
5579820,5,B00BCV3IN2,"No this is not a copy cat of BBC's Planet Earth.  This is a scientific program from years of collecting data from  satellites and researchers put their findings all together.  You'd be amazed how much detective work goes into it, such as how 1/5 of the planet's oxygen is seemingly trapped in the Amazon forest, but travels out via method of rich sentiments dumped into the ocean and then allowing plankton to regenerate the o2.  Just watched 2 hours of this on PBS, and thinking, if every nookie of earth still remains to be discovered, man's thirst and quest for knowledge just never ends. You can view this program on PBS website before deciding if buy.

5579846,5,B00BCV3IN2,"I was extremely impressed with this documentary.  The many facets of Earth's fundamental inner-workings are brought to the surface using (among other things) satellites that can see beyond the limited spectrum humans are able to see in, and through the use of this specialized imagery, the information that is compiled and gleaned over time was combined to complete a very interesting picture of how the Earth operates.  The bonus is that it's narrated by Jay O. Sanders.  We may never fully understand the depth and breadth of Earth's mysteries (or the universe for that matter) but the journey attempting to find out is AWESOME!",1458604800,,630,5.038461538461538
5579847,5,B00BCV3IN2,"I've watched this 2 hour episode of Nova at least five times now.  It's not that it's hard to understand -- Nova always does a good job of explaining things -- it's just that it covers so much territory.  There are a number of satellites in orbit around the Earth that monitor everything from solar activity to ocean currents to the amount of dust coming from the Sahara desert that winds up in the Amazon.  All of these things and much more is covered here and it is enough to get you started if you want to learn more about any of the things covered.  We all know that the Earth is a complex place, but it's only been recently that science has been able to look at it in so many new and powerful ways.  This is a very nice update.

Highly recommended.  And also available from Amazon Video in Volume 9.",1457049600,,804,4.215686274509804

5579920,5,B00BCV3IN2,"This PBS Nova program pushes Earth-facing satellites.  As an astronomer my preference is to point in the other direction, toward stars and not planets.  The program does convey the factors that are currently important in our planet's evolution.  However from an astronomical point of view, our planet has evolved to the present circumstance, and will continue to evolve as the human race fills our ""petri"" dish to capacity.  Raising red flags doesn't make scientific sense while the population factor is the driving force that is uncontained.  Few if any advocates of ""alternative"" energy solutions have taken even a first course in thermodynamics.  It does appear that most who have, have forgotten their lectures on entropy and energy conversion--Carnot engines and the ability to store and recover energy.  As we are learning, there are consequences to all energy conversion--solar and wind provide as much employment for lawyers as for engineers and scientists.  Enjoy the fossil fuel energy sources while they last.  The alternative ones cannot and will not provide the conveniences to which we are accustomed.",1409270400,,1115,5.325714285714286

If you want to know what NASA **Really** does, this is the video for you. Step by step they go through a few of the 120 Earth observing satellites currently in orbit and look at each piece until they are all combined to show how the entire planet runs as a self-regulating system. They tie it up with a a reminder that in the next 10 years there will be barely 10 earth observatories left, including crutial weather prediction capabilities. NASA's 2013 buget represents 0.48% of the federal budget. Every year Congress cuts their budget because people simply feel that NASA wastes money playing around in space. Whether you are showing this to a child to spark their interest in science or you just want to better understand the world we live in, the information is laid out a format anyone can understand while not being talked down to and the production value is phenominal, absolutely top notch.

Very detailed climate models have been refined, the key role of Antarctica, phosphate from Africa moving to the Amazon, etc.",1382832000,4,279,5.829268292682927
5579997,5,B00BCV3IN2,"This documentary is awesome. It is well written, well narrated and it covers a lot of terrain. It also places Earth, and ourselves, in context and makes a great case on why endeavors such as the exploration of Earth from space is so important. I think that this also implies exploration of space in general.

In anycase, it is a great example of peaceful and useful use of technology. I wish more satellites, more scientists, engineers, manufacturers, etc. were supported to this kind of research and understand better what is we, as humans, can do to live in this planet without destroying it or eventually be destroyed by it. It is a far more novel cause than the industry of war and fear; it is the industry of peace and light.",1380844800,,730,4.572519083969466

It is beautifully produced; the computer graphics, explanations of our scientific satellite system and dialogue help to explain the basic processes that make the earth such a unique place to inhabit. The news is not all good but one can't help but believe we have in place the scientific tools to better understand human impact on this fragile planet. This is a great DVD for families with older children and all adults interested in knowing how weather affects the planet's growing seasons, life in the seas, animal migrations and so on. It's science on a grand scale. Oh, did I mention that the photography throughout is superb so you get to see nature in its full glory.",1377993600,,804,4.7913669064748206

5580010,3,B00BCV3IN2,"On the upside, this PBS NOVA feature contains scientific information that has been around for sometime, though hardly cutting edge. Also, it contains beautiful graphics of NASA satellites. However, it was funded by Charles KOCH, not to be confused with genuine, disinterested patrons of science, like the KECK foundation, and the telescope which bears their honorable name. Mr. Koch, is entitled to his views about the natural world, our planet's atmosphere, and ever increasing human activity, which may enhance, or diminish the environment we share; but, it should not be presented, and mistaken for , any an intersubjectively honest viewpoint: i.e., reality.",1375833600,10,661,5.490196078431373

5580033,5,B00BCV3IN2,"This is a beautifully done film. It shows not only wonderful photography and imagery, but concentrates on the ""payoff"" of satellite technology - immediate and expected in the future. It would be difficult to think of another space-related program on which money, public and private, has been better spent. Should be a must for high-school and most college science classes. I saw it on PBS and then bought it for viewing for the whole family. I could see it for the third time and still enjoy it and learn from it.

I watched this on TV and I was amazed at how everything science has touted as happen-stance is/and has been in reality so Divinely caste, I find it ironic that anyone could say ""there is no God"" and fully believe it.  Such minute direction and orchestration of nature can only come from God.  My opinion, but mine.  In any case, this is a fascinating documentary on earth and would be worth watching for anyone who loves nature.",1375228800,,559,4.5049504950495045

5580069,5,B00BCV3IN2,"This documentary ambitiously, yet effectively, takes on the basic processes in all of the Earth's great ""spheres"" - atmosphere, lithosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere. The graphics are amazing! The material is presented to emphasize the connections among the various processes across our planet - that our planet is a SYSTEM.  I am a geography professor and teach a physical geography course, and I was astonished at how perfectly this documentary parallels the topics presented in the major ""introduction to physical geography"" texts in use at US colleges and universities. The annoying yet persistent questions, ""why does geography matter,"" or ""just what is geography anyway,"" are powerfully answered in this documentary.  I will be recommending it to my students.  It is a geographer's ""dream documentary.""",1364947200,7,810,5.569105691056911
