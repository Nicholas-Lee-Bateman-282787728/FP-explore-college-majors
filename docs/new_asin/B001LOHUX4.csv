8319356,2,B001LOHUX4,"Let's be positive here first:

This DVD - Iron Leg, by Alex Tao, has the SINGLE MOST exciting introduction scene in any QiGong video on earth.
The history of Chinese Traditional Arts, along with the explanation of Teacher Tao's system, are well done, along
with the fighting footage running behind the narration.

The narrator is easy to understand, and the instructions are presented in a clear way, with breakdowns and normal
speed, so the movements would be seen and interpreted without confusion.

I WANT to give this DVD 5 stars!  I want to give it 4...heck, I want to give it 3...but 2 is enough.

Ok, so here's the critique:
This ""hard QiGong"" here is not for anyone to learn at home.  The isometric exercise can raise blood pressure...
and the student is asked to do breath retention during isometrics, which could be REALLY BAD for anyone
not properly trained...or even a properly trained person who makes a mistake.

There is a huge amount of ""visualizing yourself as fire or energy"", and not much focus on the body mechanics, which
could seriously endanger the practitioner.

I do not recommend this DVD.  It may be something that Teacher Tao could teach his students in person, after several
years of instruction, but it simply is too complex mentally and physically for me, after training over 20,000 hours in
Chinese QiGong.

To offer a suggestion, the teacher should break this DVD down into 4 or 5 differend DVDs, and teach the individual skills related
to this set, in a safe, slow way, to prevent any possible damage to the practitioner.

Great guy, not a great DVD",1461283200,3,1583,4.761904761904762
