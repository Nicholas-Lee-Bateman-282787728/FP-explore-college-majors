8586757,5,B00CVB6XW0,"Robert Taylor has a way to make his character closed and open; confident, vulnerable, capable, and with that raw edge, beautifully expressed and revealed from those sources of insanity that make our headlines and become The Last Hunt. There is no lack of confidence and commitment for a man in love who makes other character's priorities align with his; the power and the prize.",1445299200,,378,4.921875
8586758,4,B00CVB6XW0,"Good film with another solid performance by Robert Taylor. And what a delight it is to watch and hear the voice of Sir Cedric Hardwicke. In my copy there is a significant segment (starting right before Taylor leaves for London) in which the picture turns into a mirror image of what it's supposed to be! Notice, for example, the ads on the London buses and the left-hand shakes. I don't think I've ever seen this kind of thing in any other film. It's a distraction of sorts, but I didn't let it interfere with my enjoying the movie.",1384646400,2,532,4.438775510204081
8586759,5,B00CVB6XW0,"I caught this astounding movie by accident on Turner Classic Movies last month, and attempted to find a public library copy.  Not one
library in all of Connecticut had it, so I turned to Amazon.com and had it in a few days.  The NY Times called it ""impressive...sharp and sophisticated.""  It made me wish I had written it, though that's overestimating my writing talent.  This B&W 1956 masterpiece stars
Robert Taylor, Burl Ives, Mary Astor, Sir Cedric Hardwicke and a magnificent Elisabeth Mueller, known chiefly for this CinemaScope
film and a few others before devoting herself to live theater.  The Warner Brothers ""Archive Collection"" had the good taste to preserve this unique work, adapted from Howard Swiggett's best-selling novel.  Bob Cumming",1379721600,5,752,5.1735537190082646
8586760,4,B00CVB6XW0,"In the mid 1950's movies that depicted the ruthless in-fighting for money and power by ambitious men to dominate and run large corporations were a popular theme. The best known movies of this genre - ""Executive Suite"" - 1954, ""Women's World"" - 1954 and ""The Man to the White Suit"" - 1956 are all excellent examples of this type.  However , ""The Power and the Prize"" released in 1956 is significantly different  from these other films in  how  it depicts some very unusual  and disturbing themes of  the ruthless nature of American corporate capitalism at its ""Eisenhower  Era"" peak  revealing  flaws as a viable business  model.

A Darwinian struggle of ""The Survival of the Fittest"" would at first seem to be the major theme of this film.  The ruthless  boss of Amalgamated World Metals George Salt {Burl Ives} wants control of a revolutionary cold  smelting  process  owned by an old line  British West African mining company  "" Carew Limited "" no matter what and sharing  control of the process is not on his agenda ! . Carew's chairman {Sir Cedric Hardwicke} is a gentleman businessman of the old school that stands on his word and agreements but is not going to be bullied or intimidated.

Centered between these two very different men is Cliff Barton {Robert Taylor} Salt's right hand man, surrogate son, engaged to Salt's niece Joan {Nicola Michaela}, his chosen ""heir apparent ""and {seemingly} a ""George Salt clone"" .  However Barton is not as ruthless nor as uncompromising as his boss - he has a latent conscious.  Salt sends Barton to England with instructions not to negotiate with Carew on the basis of previous agreed discussions but to bludgeon the Brits into an agreement because they need 40 million dollars of Amalgamated capital to develop their process and their West African mineral resources - but the Americans will run the show!!

Alone In London and out of sorts because of the dishonest negotiation  position he had to assume he meets by chance a beautiful refugee Miriam Linka {Elizabeth Mueller} who despite surviving  Nazi and Soviet oppression has a freshness and {still} positive world view that is  in various stages infuriating, confusing, intriguing and  {ultimately} very attractive to Barton. Fighting his feelings, Barton nevertheless falls hard for the attractive refugee. Once smitten with Miriam, Barton comes to review/rethink his core beliefs as a businessman and as a man of honor. He returns home empty handed with no deal and questioning Salt's  business ethics and  this clash of wills between Salt and Barton will subsequently force  Barton  to put everything on the table that he  holds dear -  friendships,  reputation,  career,  engagement and  the Carew  business deal  because he  realizes that  he cannot become  a"" ""George Salt clone"" - to gain the world but ""lose his soul"". But can he do this without destroying himself AND in a unexpected development - destroy Miriam too!!

The performances are uniformly excellent. Robert Taylor is handsome, sober and stalwart very effectively projecting the strength and character of Barton. Burl Ives is an intelligent, rapacious scoundrel for whom success isn't just everything  "" it's the only thing""!! Sir Cedric Hardwicke ably portrays a patient realist whose business mantra  MAY be past but he will remain true to his core beliefs despite the enormous profits  that could be had by knuckling under to Amalgamated  bullying. AND there are two additional beautifully nuanced performances by veteran character actor Charles Coburn {Guy Elliot} as the aged watchfull  {and still powerfull} chairman of the  Amalgamated Board and the wonderful Mary Astor playing Salt's loving, loyal, neglected ,steely willed wife.  Elizabeth Mueller is attractive but is too inexperienced an actress to give her character much depth and this detracts just a tad from the film.

Filmed in the wide screen format with sharp black and white photography by ace cameraman George Folsey, this is a thoughtfull, entertaining movie with  surprising depth and twists and I recommend it with a 4 star rating.",1376265600,9,4079,5.075414781297134
