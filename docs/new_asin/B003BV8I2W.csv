4107551,1,B003BV8I2W,"Not to impressed that there is a picture of a girl on the cover, yet its a guy who is doing the teaching.

The menu doesn't work! I can't bring up one specific dance routine to learn off of the menu, I can only hit
""play all"" then fast forward to the routine I want to work on.

Plus on the first dance he starts out doing the dance for like 3-4 minutes, then he teaches you the steps, then another minute of dance time... shouldn't he begin with teaching the steps, then go into an extended dance time?",1324944000,10,503,4.070707070707071
4107552,3,B003BV8I2W,"My grandaughter and her friends are having a great time with this DVD and learing to line dance.  It is very easy to follow, apparently, and we had a demonstration after the kids reviewed it a few times!",1324339200,,203,4.342105263157895
4107553,5,B003BV8I2W,Good. I like it. Very good. Enjoy learning. Going to buy more tapes. My friends come over to dance. Good,1399334400,,104,4.25
4107554,1,B003BV8I2W,production values were not professional at all - The presenter was uninspiring to say the least - absolutely not worth buying,1392854400,,125,5.0
4107555,4,B003BV8I2W,"The product arrived in excellent condition but was not what I was expecting.  I don't think I is the fault of the seller but of the manufacturer.  The front of the dvd shows a woman on the front.  (I would have preferred a man but you did not have any with the type of dances I wanted to learn.)  But the instructor in the video is a larger man wearing jeans and an un-tucked t-shirt,  So to the dealer, you did good in the delivery, I just am not happy with the video.",1390176000,,469,4.0
4107556,1,B003BV8I2W,"OMGosh!!!!! So glad I checked this out from the library first!!! This is a terrible DVD for several reasons.....the biggest, and this is strange even for me to admit, is that there is a pretty girl on the cover, but it's ""Uncle David"" with a big pot belly on the screen!!!! What the heck is that about?! Bait and switch! LOL! Besides that, the guy goes way to fast and it's just not for beginners. YUK!",1387152000,,402,4.302631578947368
4107557,5,B003BV8I2W,"The DVD arrived in perfect condition.  I have really enjoyed this DVD, and will still keep enjoying it in the future.",1386460800,,117,4.571428571428571
4107558,4,B003BV8I2W,"Very simple to follow -- really for a first time line dancer it is great.  Just a few dances and simple.  You have to pay attention to set up the language in English when you start up the disc, but it isn't too hard.  The fact that they put a woman on the front and the teacher is a guy is strange, but I really did appreciate the simplicity of the dances (having never line danced before I started).  I also really appreciated the fact that his back was to me so I could learn the dance with the same moves and same direction that he was facing + there were a ton of repearts of the moves of the steps before he would do the whole dance at the end -- making it easy to repeat the steps I needed most.  I have now moved on to some other instructional videos.",1379116800,,758,3.960526315789474
4107559,5,B003BV8I2W,So easy to learn from.  Good instruction and watching how the footsteps are performed very clear and precise.  Pratice a few times and you are ready to have lots of fun.,1367625600,,169,4.419354838709677
4107560,4,B003BV8I2W,I liked this.  The instructor repeated the steps several times & slow enough for a beginner. Very informative. Much better than the previous DVD I purchased,1362960000,,156,5.0
4107561,1,B003BV8I2W,"First, the DVD was produced in Germany, and you have your choice of the instructor speaking in his native German or dubbed into English. Second, the German-language menu works, but the English-language menu does not. The only way to navigate through the English version is to either fast forward or keep jumping to the next chapter. Third, this is not for beginners. I'm a beginner and I should know.",1340928000,4,400,4.811594202898551
8393999,1,B003BV8I2W,This disk DOES NOT DO what it claims. It starts off with a guy showing you a dance and doing it way to fast to even keep up with. Definitely not for beginners!!,1520899200,,160,3.878787878787879

8394002,1,B003BV8I2W,"I was NOT happy with this item. While the picture on the front shows a young lady, the video turned out to be a rather ""large bellied"" man in a cowboy hat.  I was hoping to learn how to line dance, but I found the DVD difficult to play both from the technicality of getting it started, going beyond the warnings, other languages, etc., and when I finally got it to play it was not very helpful and difficult to watch. It was NOT what I expected.",1456790400,,445,4.114942528735632

8394005,1,B003BV8I2W,I found the DVD boring. It was not at all what I expected. The music was poor and instructions were impossible to follow.,1436832000,,121,4.304347826086956
