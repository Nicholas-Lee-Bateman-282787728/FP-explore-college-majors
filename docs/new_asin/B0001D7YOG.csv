1989711,3,B0001D7YOG,"For the age, this movie was okay. The story was decent, and weird enough that I watched all of it to find out what would happen. I don't need to see it again.
Do older movies just get slapped with a PG rating? This movie has a frenzied tavern scene where men and women are paired off, and a number of women have their clothing ripped. The scene contains full-view, topless women which was unexpected. The violence is nothing like in today's films, but there's plenty of killing.",1369785600,2,478,4.443181818181818

What a great movie, Vincent price, an African witch doctor, British accents, and a guy walking around in a red hood. What more can you want from classic horror?",1350259200,3,249,4.681818181818182
1989714,4,B0001D7YOG,"This was the last film American International Pictures did in the Poe series and unfortunately has little to do with the Poe classic.  Much tragedy hit this film as it was being produced, with one of the screenwriters dying 11 days into production.  What's up with that?&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Oblong-Box/dp/1594567468/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Oblong Box</a>

The film has a lot of atmosphere, dark colors, eerie Psycho-like music and debauchery from colonial Britain ripping off the Africans and treating them badly.  In retaliation for killing a boy from a tribe that worked a family-owned plantation, one of the Markum brothers got a voodoo curse (the start of the film has Edward being nailed to a tree, ouch).  It's a very pro-Black, anti-colonial Britain film in a lot of ways.

Edward returns to England mad (as in totally nuts) and Julian (Vincent Price) has Edward locked and chained in his room.  Unable to escape, Edward hatches a plot with a witchdoctor and Julian's family lawyer, Trench. Trench has a mind of his own however, and in the confusion kinda ""forgets"" that Edward is pretending to be dead in an oblong box and ends up being buried alive.

That would have been the end of the film right there but for Christopher Lee's character, a creepy doctor who likes to experiment on cadavers, the warmer the better.  As Dr. Newhartt collects Edward's remains, the remains reach up and attempt to choke the good doctor and through blackmail gets his cooperation.

The overall story is somewhat predictable with a few twists and turns to keep the viewer entertained.  The prostitutes in a bar, the barfights, the murders that Edward performs (but the blood is so fake and the slashing of the throats looks very unrealistic).

Four stars are mainly for the sympathetic Julian and the murderous Edward (played callously by British actor Alister Williamson).  Edward's on and off sexy maid girlfriend Sally (Sally Geeson) was a bit flighty and weird but cute, in a horror sort of way.  Hilary Dwyer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Witchfinder-General-aka-The-Conqueror-Worm-from-Matthew-Hopkins/dp/B000IG5SY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Witchfinder General (aka The Conqueror Worm from Matthew Hopkins)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cry-of-the-Banshee-Murders-in-the-Rue-Morgue/dp/B00008973G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cry of the Banshee / Murders in the Rue Morgue</a>also with Price)  plays the overemotional fiancee to Julian.

Recommend seeing with Scream and Scream Again, the second film where several of the actors in Oblong Box return for an encore.

In this tale we have both actors in the movie but never sharing a scene. Too bad but you take what you can get. The story is convoluted and the revenge plot does not really play out well.

Excellent performances by Vincent Price and Christopher Lee, as well as all of the others in the cast.

1989730,5,B0001D7YOG,"Under rated horror film classic. Inexplicably, some critics have panned what may be among Vincent Price and Christopher Lee's best films; with, Hammer Studios. Moreover, the respective villains that populate the story line are both sufficiently menacing and somewhat unpredictable. Furthermore, the film culminates with an unexpected plot twist and perfect down beat ending; with, Vincent Price's character becoming the victim of the zombie curse originally and inadvertently placed upon his brother. Also, the shock effect of the protagonist (i.e., Vincent Price's character) with a progressively decaying face and gradual, but obviously inescapable, descent into madness is unforgettable. While, the fiancee of Price's character reacts with horror and revulsion upon intially seeing him; after, Price's character has been bitten and infected by his zombified brother serves to graphically punctuates the film's perfect down beat ending. Essentially, there's no happy ending for any of the protagonists and retribution is the fate of both the just and the unjust. This film defies traditional cinematic horror film rules and both the good and the bad fail to escape the dark and evil forces that pervade the film. In essence, one of the pervasive themes of the movie is that evil an inescapable entity that is no respecter of persons; regardless, of the respective character of it's victims whether righteous or wicked.",1457740800,6,1420,5.518348623853211
1989731,3,B0001D7YOG,"This review is for the blu-ray version released by Kino Lorber.

The transfer is decent, however I still find the picture to be dark in areas and sometimes unclear. This is probably because of how the movie was filmed and not because of a poor transfer. Still I always enjoy an upgrade in picture even if it's not perfect. I'll take what I can get.

This is the type of movie that probably should have been packaged together with another movie. $20 for two classic movies or $10 per movie sounds about right. It would be better as part of a package much the may the Vincent Price Collections that have recently been made available. But then again, fans of these types of movies are probably going to buy them anyway so it's probably a smart decision by Kino Lorber even if it isn't a great value. I did wait awhile before purchasing to see if the price would go down within a few months of release as some of these releases of older movies on blu-ray have.

The movie itself is just OK. The plot is decent and Christoper Lee is not used a whole lot. He is definitely second fiddle to Vincent Price in this movie and plays a supporting role rather than that of a co-star.

The movies is about an owner of an African plantation who is wrongfully accused of a crime his brother committed and is horribly disfigured by a native witch doctor. His brother (Vincent Price) keeps him locked away out of sight in his attic for the remainder of his life. The deformed brother plots to escape by being buried alive. The plot goes awry and the deformed brother seeks revenge on just about everybody...

A big complaint is the appearance of the deformed brother.  The movie builds up his appearance as if he is so horribly disfigured that nobody could stand to look at his face. When his face is finally revealed it is quite a disappointment. While disfigured, he is not nearly so bad as you were led to believe.

If you are a big fan of the genre go ahead and upgrade but you might wait and see if you can get a used copy cheaper down the road.

Recommended for fans of 60's horror, Vincent Price. Not so much for Christopher Lee fans and fans of the Edgar Allen Poe written stories.",1457136000,3,2171,4.369727047146402

1989744,5,B0001D7YOG,"England 1865.  Two brothers share the same house but one has the freedom to walk about, the other is confined to an upstairs room, shackled.  He has fits which come and go.  With the help of a disreputable barrister (Peter Arne as Trench), the fitful brother fakes his death and is soon confined to a coffin.  Said coffin is quickly buried.  Happy is the brother (Vincent Price as Julian) who can now marry a much younger woman (Hilary Dwyer as Elizabeth).  He is finally free of the thankless duty of caring for his disabled brother (played by one actor, voiced by another).  All was expected to end well for Julian and his new bride but for some pesky grave robbers who dug up the not quite dead brother, bringing him to a ghoulish doctor (Christopher Lee) for experiments.  The poor doctor soon finds himself blackmailed into housing a homicidal maniac.  This cantankerous plot also involves a certain amount of revenge murders and an inside/out voodoo curse.

The original script was written so that Vincent Price could play twins, making the curse aspect of the story more understandable.  But, that was scrapped in favor of what ended up on the screen.  Prices role was scaled down in favor of the wronged brother.  Poor Christopher Lee got stuck with a bit part that didn't allow him to do much of anything.  Still, it is a fun little thriller of sorts.  I bought it for my Vincent Price collection.",1447977600,6,1406,4.658536585365853

Poor Edward went quite mad after being disfigured by a voodoo priest in Africa. Fortunately for Edward, he has friends who are willing to aid in his escape. By using more voodoo, they will give Edward the appearance of death, and whisk him away at the opportune moment. Easy-peasy. Wellll, unfortunately, these ""friends"" are more interested in money than in Ed's freedom! Just when you think things can't possibly get worse for him, dear brother Julien nails him into a coffin and buries him alive! After a serendipitous happenstance releases him from his grave, Edward winds up under the care of Dr. Newhartt (Christopher Lee- THE MUMMY, THE WHIP AND THE BODY, ISLAND OF THE BURNING DAMNED), who helps him recover physically, while, shockingly, his mind is completely gone.

However ""Oblong Box"" does not fall into this category- it's a mish mash of voodoo and Jack the Ripper style night stalking; attempting to create a full length movie out of a simple idea from Poe.  There are a few lurid moments, however, but the main objection to this film has to be the unforgivable mistake of not making Price the active villain and reducing him to that of a sinister observer to all the action.  Christopher Lee is similarly wasted in the same regard.",1419724800,,756,4.792307692307692

1989788,3,B0001D7YOG,"I saw this @ 8:00am this Halloween morning on an Los Angeles local station! Yes, it's a very dated 1969 British horror film (not from Hammer Studios, however), but I *erally* enjoyed the directing! It takes place in Victorian England and director Gordon Hessler, who directed another Edgar Allen Poe adaptation, Murders In The Rue Morgue, has an effective claustrophobic camera style that translated the cramped, gin-soaked, heavy-fabrics and smoke and fog living and entertainment quarters of the time. Every frame fairly seethes with sweat and dim, candle-lit poverty, and the poshness of the upperclass homes seems tarnished as well.

And I disagree with the other reviewer who stated that the throat slashings didn't look real. Yes, the blood is impossibly garish, but the stabbings had an uncomfortable veracity to them! Only the murder's supposedly hideous face deformed by Zombieism was a let down at the end. But the rest of the film was fun and moved along, no creaky pacing as is usual in these old horror films.

""The Oblong Box"" spawned two pop-culture references: British television juggernaut, Absolutely Fabulous, has an episode where Edinas father dies and get accidently displayed as modern art in her living room! When she sees him lying in his coffin she describes it thusly to her friend Patsy, Its an open, oaken, oblong box! And German jazz outfit De-Phazzs song, Not Sally, must be homaging the scene where the murderer visits a prostitution den and calls one of the women Sally after his estranged girlfriend. The slattern then says to him, I can be Sally if you want me to be. The De-Phazz song directly comments on this form of female seduction!",1414713600,3,1671,4.985663082437276
