8115229,5,B000EWHPRU,"I grew up watching this movie on black/white tv and to have it on DVD is a great find!  I've had the video tape version for more than 20 years and was afraid I was going to lose it forever.  I can now put it away.  Amazing that a foreign country was able to convert it to a DVD and not the U.S.  In any event, the vendor was prompt in sending the item and I'm happy with the entire experience.

Thank you Amazon.",1286582400,,412,3.857142857142857
8115230,5,B000EWHPRU,"Despite being a box-office hit in its day, and despite being directed by John Ford, universally acknowledged as one of the top directors of all time, this movie is little known today. That's a pity, because it may be the best disaster movie ever made. The storm arrives late in the picture, smashing the lives of characters we have come to care deeply about. And unlike newer disaster films, there is little foreshadowing of the coming horror. It is more terrible and merciless and draining on the audience than any natural disaster on film, even though it was made in a studio, and even though a few ill-conceived shots threaten to break the illusion. The cast is uniformly excellent, and character stalwarts Raymond Massey, C. Aubrey Smith and John Carradine keep their hammier impulses in check. Conflicts between ""civilized"" westerners and ""primitive"" islanders are handled with wisdom, compassion and taste, not least because Dorothy Lamour made a convincing Polynesian and leading man Jon Hall was half-Polynesian.",1284163200,,1020,5.150602409638554
8115231,5,B000EWHPRU,"I love this movie, I love this movie. It was packed well and I would buy from this seller again.
They just don't make movies like this anymore and would be a great addition to any collection. I had not seen this movie since I was a child and thanks to amazon I can watch it again and again",1269129600,,289,3.9152542372881354
8115232,5,B000EWHPRU,"I was delightfully surprised upon viewing this film for the first time.  I had never heard of it, and took a chance because the price was right and I had other Dorothy Lamour films.  I believe this to be either her best or second best next to My Favorite Brunette (with Bob Hope).  I couldn't believe that this film isn't better known.  It's got a great story line, interesting characters, and is superbly directed by Ford.  Dorothy Lamour is young and looks great (1937).  The special effects are great and don't have a ""staged"" feel or look to them.  I've seen more modern films with worse special effects.  They did a terrific job putting this film together and making it look as realistic as it does, especially for 1937.  I have a feeling White Cargo (1942)  starring Hedy Lamarr which was released a few years after The Hurricane was influenced by this film.  Not all of it, but certain parts of the films are similar.  Hedy's character in White Cargo and Dorothy's character in The Hurricane are complete opposites, nothing alike.  But both have a well-meaning, heavy-drinking doctor as well as a ""by the rules"" guy in charge, as well as some other plot aspects.  I must give The Hurricane a very strong recommendation.  Very entertaining from beginning to end.  You won't regret giving this a viewing!",1260316800,,1309,4.700440528634362
8115233,4,B000EWHPRU,Beautiful period film. A wonderful addition to the collection of anyone interested in classic Hollywood productions of the 1930's.,1238544000,,130,5.894736842105263
8115234,5,B000EWHPRU,"A tip-off that this is a vintage film is the lack of confusion with the more recent ""Hurricane,"" which portrays the life of boxer Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter.  This movie is of an entirely different genre, a natural disaster epic comparable to ""The Perfect Storm"" or ""Deep Impact"" (flood), and just as riveting.

The story centers around a Pacific islander named Terangi (Jon Hall) who is incarcerated on Tahiti for a minor offense during an era of colonial racism.  Terangi's plight is worsened as he keeps trying to escape and gets socked with more prison time.  His home island governor, De Laage played by Raymond Massey, is an unbending martinet who wants to make an example of Terangi.  His efforts are in vain, for the islanders revere Terangi and shelter him when he makes good his escape after eight long years in prison.

Meanwhile, Terangi's wife Marama (Dorothy Lamour) has given birth to a daughter whom Terangi has never seen.  Just as they finally reunite, the mother of all storms kicks up and they have to use all their wits to survive.  The storm (typhoon) is loud and frighteningly realistic.  Monster waves obliterate the island and all life still on it.  Fortunately for De Laage's wife Germaine (Mary Astor), Terangi takes her with his family and saves her life too.  When De Laage returns to her after riding out the storm at a distance, he is a changed man and buries his grudge against Terangi.  A great story of love, injustice, and redemption.  Fr. Dennis",1236384000,,1479,4.775590551181103
8115235,5,B000EWHPRU,"For a film that's billed as a romance movie, this has got a surprising amount of good suspense and action. It's really an adventure story with a romance angle. It's also very interesting and a good film with decent special effects, at least for when this was made. I'm thrilled to order this on DVD here at Amazon as I could never find it in any store.

It's almost a ""Count Of Monte Cristo"" story with an innocent man imprisoned on an island and finally succeeding in escaping. However, in this story, the escapee ""Terangi"" (John Hall) also has to battle a hurricane after escaping!

The film starts slowly in the first half hour, but stick with it, it's worth it. The story becomes very involving as ""Terangi"" begins his battle against ""the law,""  and the weather.  Dorothy Lamour is likewise fascinating as ""Marama,"" Terangi's wife.

The cinematography is very good and the direction excellent. Then again, one of the best directors of all time did this film: John Ford. It also has a nice cast. Look at the supporting actors: Mary Astor, Raymond Massey, C. Aubrey Smith, Thomas Mitchell and John Carradine!

A solid Golden Age adventure story and one of the best of the 1930s decade.",1235260800,,1187,4.6826923076923075
8115236,5,B000EWHPRU,"This film is seldom mentioned in John Ford retrospectives, possibly because it doesn't easily fit into the genres of his most notable work. It's a rouser: an entertaining, melodramatic, and engrossing story about a strict island governor (Raymond Massey, terrific performance) who makes life difficult for Dorothy Lamour and her lover, Jon Hall, before nature intervenes, settling several scores. The climactic hurricane effects are stunning, even after seventy years, and the film is populated by an ""all star"" cast that includes Mary Astor, Thomas Mitchell, and C. Aubrey Smith. This DVD (which looks to be out of print, or at least not easily available) is from a clean, sharp print, and the movie looks fine. There's some artifacts and a bit of scratching, but it's quite acceptable, all things considered. An interesting story of injustice, calamity, repression, and redemption, ""The Hurricane"" is in so many ways a precursor to the less subtle ""disaster films"" of the seventies, and more recent spectacles like ""The Day After Tomorrow"".",1215216000,,1042,5.283132530120482
8115237,5,B000EWHPRU,"I think this is an incredible movie and far ahead of its time. It dealt with discrimination, unjust punishment and a natural disaster.  The ""special effects"" for the movie were done long before computers could ""help"" and were done fantastically. I had TiVo'd the movie and didn't start watching it until later at night and I couldn't turn it off and go to bed until I saw the end. Now I am interested in reading the book it was based on.",1214870400,,437,4.395061728395062
