8327952,5,B001NV75QW,The 13 episode version of WWII in colour with Robert Powell narrating is now available for sale on iTunes and for streaming on Netflix. Idk if that helps anyone.,1452038400,14,161,4.586206896551724
8327953,5,B001NV75QW,"The 5 Stars are for the excellent 13-part series that I saw on television; HOWEVER, like the others who have written comments here, I have had trouble figuring out (1) exactly what series I watched, (2) where I can buy it, and (3) whether it is available in a format that is compatible with devices used in the US.

I found some information on Wikipedia (yeah, I know, not necessarily reliable) that I think (HOPE!) will be helpful. If anyone finds a place where a USA-device-compatible version can be purchased, please let us know!

Here is the info from Wikipedia (cut-and-pasted on 12/9/15): ""World War II In HD Colour is a 13-episode television documentary series recounting the major events of World War II narrated by Robert Powell.[1] The show covers the Western Front, Eastern Front, North African Campaign and the Pacific War. It was on syndication in America on the Military Channel (now American Heroes Channel).[2] The series is in full colour, combining both original and colourised footage. It was made by World Media Rights in 2008/2009.[3]""

The Wikipedia article includes a description of each episode. The link is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_in_HD_Colour",1449619200,22,1187,5.2368421052631575
8327954,1,B001NV75QW,"This is NOT World War II in Colour as aired on the Military Channel (AHC).
The packaging, dvd boxes, disk labels and disk menu all say they are World War II in Colour
When played disks are The Color of War, narrated by Peter Coyote.
This is a major disappointment. The Color of War is not near the WWII documentary.",1410480000,13,315,4.266666666666667
8327955,5,B001NV75QW,Very fast delivery and as advertised.,1405641600,,37,5.333333333333333
8327956,1,B001NV75QW,"This DVD - advertised only as ""Blu-Ray"" - is not as it at first appears. It is a European-only-compatible DVD (possibly PAL format) and will not play in Blu-Ray players here in the United States.
They gave me a refund but no apology for misleading labeling. I can find no US-compatible DVD.",1390176000,6,290,4.596153846153846
8327957,1,B001NV75QW,"""WWII in Colour"" (note the British spelling of the word ""colour"") is an excellent, British-made series that I originally saw on PBS, and was the actual series that I wanted to buy.  However, THIS series (which is completely mis-titled) is actually the History Channel's series entitled ""The Color of War"" (note the American spelling of the word ""color"").  That History Channel series is decent (I'd give it a 3 or 4 star rating), but it is NOT what I wanted, nor what I ordered (thus the 1 star rating)!",1369353600,46,503,4.640449438202247
8327958,5,B001NV75QW,I bought this DVD set for my husband.  He is a history buff.  So he loved the DVD.  Very informative.,1365206400,,101,3.95
8327959,5,B001NV75QW,"I saw this series on Television and wanted to own it.  Its a good series.  But what was odd is when I got the product, it was NOT the series I saw on TV!  After much investigation I found out that the Military History Channel has at least TWO distinct series of DVDs called ""WWII in Colour""!  I had to order the second set from Amazon UK as I could not find it in the USA.  When I got the set, its a different box in the pictures used, but says ""WWII in Colour""!  And still, is NOT the series I saw on TV?  So...  I got two good documentaries - and they are good - but still are not what I was after.  No complaints really though...

The Vendor did take a long time to deliver - almost two weeks - not what I am used to from Amazon, but the Vendor DID make that clear in ordering, and I was will to wait.  So no complaints there - just a heads up, it takes a while to get the product.",1361145600,27,884,3.802197802197802
