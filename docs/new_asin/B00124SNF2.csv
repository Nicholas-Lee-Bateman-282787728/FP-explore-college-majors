8243771,4,B00124SNF2,"I bought this only for the film ZOMBIES, aka (I EAT YOUR SKIN).  I will not be commenting on the other two films on the DVD.  Zombies is about a womanizing writer and his agent/publisher? who end up, with the agents wife, stranded on a Caribbean island that is chock full of zombies, voodoo practitioners, and mad science in a lab.  I understand that this may have been filmed in Puerto Rico.  If they did and they used some local talent, the locals may speak Spanish but they speak it rather ungrammatically.  I KNOW.  Still the film is entertaining.  The film on this DVD release is the best quality I've seen yet.  The picture is clear and the black-and-white photography is pristine.  Highly recommended.",1409961600,,708,4.645161290322581
