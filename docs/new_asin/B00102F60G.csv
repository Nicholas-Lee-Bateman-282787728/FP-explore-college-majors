8236621,4,B00102F60G,"ST. CLAIR's triple feature RONALD REAGAN SIGNATURE COLLECTION contains a western, a WWII-era musical extravaganza and a documentary Reagan narrated concerning a construction project the Allies hoped would help stymie the Japanese invasion of China.

SYNOPSES--
STILLWELL ROAD includes actual footage of the creation of 478 mile Ledo Road, which linked with the cut Burma Road beyond where the enemy's army held it. Even after completion (at a cost of 1,100 Americans lives, as well as others), Stillwell's India to China highway never carried more frieght than was airlifted into China via ""the Hump"" of the Lower Himalayas.

THIS IS THE ARMY--  Dozens of Hollywood luminaries contributed their efforts to this story of a former WWI soldier who organizes a Broadway show starring his son (Reagan) and other military men. The first Warner Bros. musical filmed in Technicolor features Irving Berlin singing (after a fashion) his composition, ""How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning.""

SANTA FE TRAIL--  Highly fictionalized pre-Civil War account of future Conferedate cavalryman J.E.B. Stuart (Flynn) includes a strong supporting cast. Story has nothing to do with the named trail, and everything to do with John Brown's activities in Kansas and at Harper's Ferry. Stuart's friendship with George Custer (Reagan) is depicted, as well.

This Is The Army
Santa Fe Trail
Stillwell Road

Santa Fe Trail is the only real movie on the disc.  This Is The Army is a musical with a very small story to go along with all the musical numbers.  Stillwell Road is a documentary in which Reagan is the narrator.  As someone who already owns a dozen Ronald Reagan movies (two of which are on this disc), this ""collection"" is quite poor.  Santa Fe Trail is a good movie, but I don't know why the other two were picked of all the movies he has been in.  I bought this disc because I didn't know what was on it.  Still, for the price I really can't complain.  You probably pay that much for a good coaster.",1207958400,4,688,4.112781954887218
