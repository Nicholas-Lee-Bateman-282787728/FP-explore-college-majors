No matter who you are; even if you're female, lesbian, transgender, or a misfit of society'' This movie will remind you that even the people accepted as a cog in ""society"" lack the option to stray and observe without being ostracized and cast in to a depressing state consisting of public shaming and poverty..

Bursting with acting talent (Natalie Portman at 15 was already on her way) Beautiful Girls dealt with the various complications between a group of buddies since their high school days and their respective girlfriends. Not much of a storyline, but it is done so well, so realistically, and the participants are for the most part so likeable, that it's hard not to love this film.

800394,4,6304167660,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  The main characters are believable and likeable young adults, except  for the Natalie Portman character, who is a young teenager.  For my money Natalie Portman steals the show.  She is flirtatious, cute, and smart.  No wonder Timothy Hutton falls for her.  There is a lot of realism in the script;.  Everyone has a fault that they must learn to live with.  Even Annabeth Gish, a successful, charming attractive lawyer, is somewhat lacking.  She is not a supermodel!  As in real life, everyone's reach seems to exceed their grasp.  Then the characters meet the perfect woman, played by Uma Thurman.  She has it all--beauty, success, class.  But she is just small-town slumming.  She shows the local yokels what they are missing, then  goes back to the big city.  This comedy is grounded solidly in the human predicament.  Most of us will not be very happy or successful.  Life is just settling for second-best.  Be thankful you have that.",1465603200,,976,4.877300613496932

Director Ted Demme puts a spin on the Brat-pack tradition, and gets a lot out of the odd-ball collection of actors, whose characters are all facing various life crises at the end of very protracted adolescences, in a decaying Rust-Belt town. Special kudos to young Natalie Portman, in her 3rd movie role, as an incredibly mature teenager who bonds with Tim Hutton.

Timothy Hutton is also fun to watch as Willie, an apprehensive Peter Pan under Marty's spell. It's all innocent, by the way, enough so that Will's raunchy and loser buddies, all professional snow plowman in Minnesota's eternal winter, even crack jokes about his pedophilia in the midst of their own romantic angst and struggles against maturity. Rosie O'Donnell is also great at just being Rosie, although she'd never pass as a Minn. native with her Bronx accent.",1429488000,,692,5.078947368421052

801582,5,6304167660,"Beautiful Girls is about Willie Conway,who goes home for his high school class reunion at New England. He is at a crossroads in his life and he can not decide if he should marry his girlfriend. Also,he can not decide if he should quit his music and take a job as a salesman. Over the course of the story, he spends time with his old friends who are all at similar crossroads. By the end they all discover what it is that they want.

This conversational film is about the gaping chasm between what men say and what they feel. It may not tell us anything new, but its eloquence is quietly rewarding. Nevertheless,it really succeeds with its warm treatment of ordinary hang-ups like no life-shattering revelations or pain repressed since childhood, just the genuine, everyday trials of life. Also,this coming of age tale is about guys in their 20's who refuse or are unable to mature as evidenced by the captivating relationship is between Timothy Hutton and the 13-year-old Natalie Portman,which steals all scenes and it is a delight. This is definitely a smart film about relationships and growing older that's funny and smart that many would surely enjoy.",1428105600,,1155,4.775

The Americans' Noah Emmerich is in one of his first acting roles and an adolescent Natalie Portman shows great promise playing Marty, the neighbor of Timothy Hutton's father and brother.

802722,4,6304167660,"In a lot of ways Beautiful Girls reminds me a great deal of the short-lived TV Series October Roads. Same small university town atmosphere though this one is shot in the middle of winter after the Christmas Season. It is not about the girls of course but the commitment-shy boys pushing 30 who are still stuck reliving their high school glory days. If for no other reason it is worth watching to see the cocky Matt Dillon get the s*** kicked out of him. Mind you it is remarkable for the fact that here snow plough operators get out of their warm cabs to sand driveways and shovel sidewalks though sharing an over-heated cab with a Saint Bernard....

In this large ensemble cast Oscar-Winner Timothy Hutton rates only fifth. Darth Vaders love interest Natalie Portman then 14 plays the precocious Marty, the little girl next door. Rosie ODonnell is insufferable as the pontificating purveyor of wisdom. The unnamed town is a place where it is safe to walk the streets at night and save for Dillons philandering payback little violence ever occurs. The movie plays on every possible small town stereotype. Wills Father comes off as someone entering dementia and his brother as mildly retarded. At the class reunion the fat boy takes great pleasure in telling off the homecoming queen who treated him so poorly back in the day.

During the course of the movie we visit every bar and greasy spoon in town. There is much drinking and camaraderie and a lot of dialogue. Paul delivers a prescient bit of philosophy when he points across the bar at four old guys and declares, Thats us in forty years, or words to that effect. Reminds me somewhat of Paul Newman in Nobodys Fool also shot in a small town in winter. This is a movie about people and their relationships and has a quaint feel to it. If you're looking for action look elsewhere.",1408406400,,1834,4.64

The movie is very well done, has a wonderful cast who play their respective parts with sensitivity and understanding, and there is not much of an overall plot besides growing up to meet their age there are a number of sub stories going on with the individual members of the group of former classmates that are interesting in their developments during the movie. The best dialog in the movie takes place between Timothy Hutton's character, a musician who has settled in New York but returned for the reunion, and a 13-year old played by Natalie Portman in one of her first roles.

For one thing, what little you saw of Rosie O'Connell she was too ""potty mouthed"" even for my taste - and I am certainly no prude.  The movie listing on Amazon Prime is rather misleading.  It highlights Matt Damon and Natalie Portman.  Natalie Portman was an unknown ~15 year old actress when the film was made.  She was cute and a did a good job in the movie as a 13 year old infatuated with Dillon's character.  Certainly not the best film I've ever seen!",1401667200,,515,4.257731958762887

802971,4,6304167660,"Real life isn't neat and tidy, desire is even messier -- and the notion of coupling and forever is daunting.
Tim Hutton goes home, lost in his own life and so far beyond where he grew up. What he finds are his friends in various states of treason (to themselves and others) as the films explores male/female dynamics amongst regular people.
Uma Thurman as the exotic; Natalie Portman as the precious child next door; Rosie O'Donnell as the sassy, salty truth-teller. There are archetypes on display, but also a strong thrust the conflicts that impact all relationships, and often pull us under.
Comedic for the occasional tension busters, it is the quiet insight, the robust shove of knowledge, even the communial sense to how  life unravels that tempers the film. Smart; genuine, marked by flaws and defined by realization and healing, ""Beautiful Grls"" more than ups the ante on what binds us together, how we fall apart and sometimes how what we know when we choose to see it can truly set us free, put us solidly in our life and give us the clarity to thrive where we should be.

It has a multi-faceted, character-driven, storyline, as we see these high school friends, back together for their ten year reunion, finally grow up. There is both sadness and humor in the story, especially in the poignant, star-crossed relationship between the adult, Willie (Timothy Hutton) and the too young tween, Marty (Natalie Portman). While the other characters in the movie have their own subplots with various emotional twists and turns, it is the relationship between Willie and Marty that is central to the development of Willie into full adulthood and provides us with a glimpse of how we change from childhood to adulthood.

Male-female-relationship drama left and right, but with just the right touches of warmth and humor (despite some abrasive language and inappropriate adult themes), and the short-but-sweet scenes between ""Willie"" (Hutton) and 13-year-old next-door neighbor ""Marty"" (Portman), completely innocent, together create an on-screen relationship that's the movie's most genuine, endearing, and memorable.",1388275200,,1160,5.934131736526946

The scene where they rate women on a scale, commenting on their face, body and personality is a dead give away on how the writers were viewing women as just pieces of meat.....that the guys were holding out for the prime cut, instead of settling for anything less.  Note:  Many of the were not married and had very long term girlfriends that they kept on a string, but never put a ring on it.

Only if that girlfriend on a string threatened to cut it did one of them act and she said it very well ""that he should WANT to give her a ring, not HAVE to give her a ring to keep from loosing her"".

And the relationship between Will and Marty - okay, a little more than weird.  No mature adult man should be even thinking about ""well, I can wait so many years until she grows up""....that only happens in Twilight, people.

803319,2,6304167660,There are quite a few current stars in this movie who acted in this when they were young.  The stories were about sleazy relationships.,1378944000,,135,4.625
803320,5,6304167660,I already owned this movie but ordered it as a birthday present for my niece.  I love this movie.  The characters are people who you actually care about.  The whole storyline is something that actually is common to a lot of people that age - trying to find yourself and decide what to do with your life.  It is a completely believable movie and is my all time favorite!  I have watched this so many times I know the lines before they are said but I can still watch it over and over. I absolutely love Timothy Hutton in this role.  Matt Dillon also gives a great performance.  Needless to say it is now one of my niece's top five favorite movies and she says its the best gift she got this year!!!,1378771200,,696,4.18796992481203

My favorite part was when Rosie was in the grocery store shopping with the two guys following along behind her and she did a whole monologue about men and their proclivity for beautiful girls.  Pretty funny stuff.  There's a young Natalie Portman doing a great job acting in this, but the dynamics between her character and the main character creeped me out a bit.  I understood what she represented to him in the movie, but it was still a little ""pedophilic"".

803323,5,6304167660,"What makes ""Beautiful Girls"" great?

First, its cast is top-notch. In almost all instances, the actors (Natalie Portman, Matt Dillon, Uma Thurman, etc.) have gone on to have stellar careers. Their collective talents are already evident in realistic, compelling portrayals of their characters.

Second, the portrayals of the key male characters are, sad to say, all too realistic, featuring a half dozen men closing in on thirty who are still somehow lost, both in their relationship with their wife or girlfriend, and also in their ability to graduate from youth into the responsibilities of a mature and stable adulthood. (As a male who took a long, long time to ""find"" myself as an adult, I could certainly relate to this.) Each of the individual stories is truly believable.

Third, there is the also all too real male sense that one's partner (long-term girlfriend or wife) is perhaps not quite the right person, that there's someone better ""out there"" who is cuter, will offer more excitement, and is one's true soulmate.

Finally, ""Beautiful Girls"" features a truly charming relationship between Willie (Timothy Hutton) and 13-year-old Marty (Natalie Portman), in which Willie is drawn to a girl less than half his age because of her vivacious character and their common intellectual passions, one that we know from the start is not going to work but which amply illustrates that attraction far transcends the sexual or the realistic.

There's very little to criticize in this movie, other than that the introduction of the characters is sufficiently abrupt and disjointed that it takes a bit of time to sort out the various relationships.",1378512000,2,1645,5.100371747211896

803384,3,6304167660,Lots of big name actors.  I found it a little boring and trite.  Gave it three stars because it is a classic and one of those movies with a few memorable moments.,1378425600,,162,4.03125
803385,3,6304167660,"In Beautiful Girls (1996), 13-year-old Martie (Natalie Portman) breaks up with her boyfriend, Scooter, and informs middle-aged Willie (Timothy Hutton), ""You're my new boyfriend Willie."" But she warned that they would have to, ""Wait five years. I'll be 18. We can walk through this world together."" Otherwise, ""You'll go to the penitentiary and I'd be the laughing stock of the Brownies.""

803388,2,6304167660,"For almost 2 hours, this movie drones on and on about what seems to be mostly a bunch of men who refuse to grow up and the sad, pathetic women trailing behind them hoping to pick up the crumbs of whatever attention may be left after they've consumed their fill in porn. Annabeth Gish is repeatedly described as ""meh"" in the looks department by none other than Timothy Hutton, who - let's face it - wasn't exactly first in line when they handed out good looks and can't decide whether to commit to Annabeth Gish (his successful lawyer gf who also cooks!) and the 13 year-old neighbor girl, played by Natalie Portman. Mira Sorvino delivers a predictably half-baked performance as the, snif snif, doormat to Matt Dillon's pound-some-other-guy's-wife jerk who wrestles with the demons of not living up to his own expectations.

Basically, this is a movie about what happens when you grow up in a small town where nothing ever changes and where, even when people get older, some people never ACTUALLY leave high school from a mental perspective.

I don't understand the point or appeal of this movie. Even if you want to think of or approach it from a ""coming of age"" point of view, it falls flat for me. Trite, boring and, at best, makes you glad you didn't grow up in wherever this is supposed to have taken place at.",1377734400,,1314,4.587234042553192

Another thing that this has going for it is the actors. The entire cast is made up of movie stars, although a couple of them were popular only in the '90s, many of them remain favorites, such as Matt Dillon, Natalie Portman and Timothy Hutton, to name a few.

When Natalie Portman is skating and quoting Romeo and Juliet I kept wondering what the significance of that dialogue was. Very little if any- we move from Shakespeare to the ensemble cast singing, ""Sweet Caroline.""  And that too had the failed high jump of pulling the plot and characters together in any profound way.  Each development in story and character was kitsch at best and very little of the sentimental resolutions mattered.  It would have been better to just keep it as it was- a tired plot of a reunion of 20 somethings mourning the end of childhood. Nothing in this film was funny, smart or otherwise unique.

The cast however did indeed redeem its own lack of substance. Portman is the only high point- one scene with Rosie O'Donnell was funny (although cliche) and Uma always has some sort of provocative edge.  But my God- what a loser of a script.",1376438400,,945,4.696969696969697

803577,4,6304167660,"It seems like there are hundreds of 10 year reunion movies and to one degree or another, they all pretty much follow the same story line.  The jock, the homecoming queen, the funny guy, the sweet girl all having gone their separate ways, return to reunite like they were still 18 again.  Frankly there's not much different here.

But...  Looking back some 17 years now check out the cast.  Matt Dillon, Noah Emmerich, Lauren Holly, Timothy Hutton, Rosie O'Donnell, Max Perlich, Martha Plimpton, Michael Rapaport, Mira Sorvino, Uma Thurman, David Arquett, Sam Robards and the remarkable Natalie Portman.  Why does Portman stand out?  While everyone else is just short of 30, Portman's character, Marty, is only 13 and lives next door to the Conway home.  Willie Conway (Hutton) has returned home to this New England small town, after years in the city (Boston? New York?) playing piano in small clubs.  Disillusioned, he's thinking of changing careers.  He's also not sure where his relationship with Tracy (Annabeth Gish) is going.

He strikes up a casual conversation with Marty and finds her engaging, smart and quick witted.  As Marty says of herself, ""I'm an old soul.""  Marty develops a crush on Willie.  Willie sees the characteristics in Marty that he wishes Tracy had.  Before this sounds like it is going into the icky stage, it doesn't.  But that doesn't mean Marty and Willie aren't marking their calendars ahead, 5 years as far as Marty is concerned, 10 for Willie.  Their byplay is what makes the film special and Portman is amazing in what was her 3rd film after ""Leon: The Professional"" and ""Heat.""

Another excellent performance comes from Dillon as Tommy who is currently playing house with Sharon (Sorvino) but also getting it on the side from the married beauty (Holly).  Also watch for Rosie O'Donnell as Gina, who has a memorable rant about skinny fashion models, especially those that adorn the room of Paul (Rapaport).  Director Ted Demme must have felt like he was wrangling cats with this ensemble, but it all works.

Don't expect much on this Blu ray version.  It comes in 1080p and has a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  While it is certainly watchable it is flat and lifeless.  I noticed several darker scenes with background noise.  The audio track is DTS HD-Master Audio 2.0 and it is OK but again nothing special.  The extras are pretty lame.  A 27 minute ""Behind the Scenes"" and 3+ minute piece of what the cast sees as ""True Beauty.""  Yawn.",1371081600,4,2462,4.8253588516746415

803582,5,6304167660,"Beautiful Girls is one of a handful of movies that I don't get tired of re-watching. The whole cast, including a 15-year-old Natalie Portman (""Marty""), give outstanding performances. The soundtrack is great, and will have you singing along on at least one scene. The story is about a guy whose life needs to change, going back to his small town, and all of his high school friends who are still there. The relationships all feel real, the friendships, the romances, and even the affairs, are all credible. The opinions and suggestions that the friends give each other, are just like what we have heard from friends in our lives. We watch Willie (Timothy Hutton) struggle with which path to take, professionally and romantically, and his uncertainty is evident. We feel for Mira Sorvino (""Sharon"") and want to throw Matt Dillon (""Tommy"") under his snow plow, but we are drawn by the story and it's satisfying conclusion. Great movie.

I've been waiting for this Blu-Ray release for a few years, now, and will have a viewing party once it finally arrives. Because this is a low-cost release ($5.99 pre-order), I doubt there will be any special features.

803625,4,6304167660,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2011 'UK RELEASED BLU RAY' ***

A should-be-doing-more-than-this-with-his-life William 'Willie' Conway (Timothy Hutton) takes a wad of crumpled notes out of a beer glass - slurps down his last whiskey of the night - and closes the lid on the bar's battered upright piano. With his dollar tips firmly wedged in his pockets, he then trudges through the cold streets of New York heading for the Port Authority building on 6th Avenue. Onboard the Greyhound bus and bound for his hometown in Massachusetts, he looks out through the neon-reflected glass and ponders what lies ahead. First will be his slightly loony family (Robert Bright and David Arquette play his monosyllabic Dad and simpleton brother) and worse - a high-school reunion full of memories, achievers and awkward questions. The big city boy who left Hicksville in the dust finally returns triumphant...or maybe not...

But while the seasons change in snowbound Knight's Ridge (his home town) - it seems little else does. Willie is met at the other end by his sorry-assed crew of former college buddies. Paul obsesses over his ex-vegetarian girlfriend Jan who is are now dating a meat-cutter (Michael Rapaport and Martha Plimpton) while his best buddy Tommy pushes a snow plough in suburban driveways which he quickly follows with some pushing of another man's wife (Matt Dillon and Lauren Holly). Watching all of this from the sidelines is Maz Perlich as the permanently squinting hat-wearing Kev who doesn't seem to want much from life except maybe a beer with his mates and a good hot meal - while the unexciting but steady Michael (Noah Emmerich) is a genuinely nice guy trying to hold down his job and keep his marriage together. Even Willie's 13-year neighbour (a cleverly cast Natalie Portman) acts weird towards him - developing an instant crush on the thirtysomething to the point where she asks him to wait 6 years until she's 18 and they can ""...walk through the world together..."" Willie is so confused about his place in life and women in general - at one point - it's an offer he seriously considers...

Then there are the other side of the relationship coin - the town's long-suffering women. Michael's wife is Sarah (a lovely Anne Bobby) - who is ever understanding and supportive. In fact most of the ladies of the town seem to exude stoical patience - they simply sigh and put up with their men's shortcomings and immaturity. Miro Sorvino's character Sharon loves Matt Dillon's character Tommy - but dies inside just once too often as he deposits his cockiness in someone else's bed. Michael Rapaport's character Paul festoons his walls with pictures of lingerie models because he is convinced they represent some kind of love nirvana - ladies who can do no wrong and bring only joy into your life simply because they're ""...beautiful girls"". The scene where Rosie O'Donnell bawls out the boys in a supermarket about obsessing over these fake fantasies in glossy magazines - is both brilliant and ball-breakingly funny. She makes a good point too. The boys do need to ""...get a grip!""

And into this heady mix is thrown some genuine temptation - a visiting Uma Thurman who effortlessly knocks all the boys for six (even the faithful ones) as she wanders into their regular waterhole Stinky's bar (Pruitt Taylor Vince). The habitual womaniser Tommy and smooth musician Willie fancy their chances with her - while the less-attractive boys just fancy her but would never have the nerve to do anything about it. There later follows some delicious dialogue moments - Hutton's character half-heartedly wooing Thurman in the bar and ice-hut afterwards - and especially when Hutton is sparring with Natalie Portman about how she will grow up anyway and have a great life with her own memories to savour (even at 13 she showed extraordinary star quality and acting chops).

But when Willie's classy girlfriend Tracy finally flies in from New York to meet his family - she quietly wows them all. In fact they want to touch Willie to see how in God's name he got this lucky - she's a lawyer, she's warm-hearted, she's got the 'boob thing' going - Tracy is a catch and the clan Conway knows it (a lovely turn from Annabeth Gish). So Willie finally has to be mature now and decide...and on it goes to a wholly satisfying ending...

Directed by TED DEMME and written by SCOTT ROSENBERG - as you can see from the names above - this 1996 movie featured an extraordinarily good ensemble cast - and each of them given real meat to work with. The women's parts (even if they were merely a cameo) were so well written. It was popular at the time - effortlessly hip too - and is a smart choice for reissue on BR (UK released Oct 2011).

Transfer-wise - the BLU RAY picture is defaulted to fit the entire screen and is a vast improvement over the DVD (even if the opening credits to David A Stewart's score contain a few scratches and glitches). Once it gets to the snowbound town - day or night - the clarity is lovely and blemish free and really adds to the film's homely vibe. The outdoor sequences on the ice-rinks are particularly clear and eye-catching. It's a damn shame there's no extras though - a real let down.

To sum up - ""Beautiful Girls"" doesn't really seem to be about anything in particular - but nonetheless you enjoy its company immensely. It's like a good night out with the boys - or girls - or preferably both. ""Beautiful Girls"" is like life itself - enjoyable one moment - heartbreaking the next. It's just working out which one to side with.

My advice - go with this small movie with a big heart - and enjoy...

PS: Blink and you'll miss it 'cameo' is by JOHN SCURTI as a Greyhound Bus Ticket Dispenser at the beginning of the movie (barely gets 2 lines). He later became the leading character Kenny Shea in Denis Leary's superlative ""Rescue Me"" TV series about New York firemen post 9/11.

803626,5,6304167660,This is one of my favorite films. The story line is fairly simple but well written which is why it's so easy to relate to. The characters are all people we know doing things we've all done. The cast is outstanding. You will recognize most of the actors although they're all pretty young. Natalie Portman is particularly interesting to watch as her talents are easy to appreciate in this film.

803629,3,6304167660,"...but still not a very good transfer.  I rate the movie itself a solid 4.5 stars and the DVD quality 1.5 stars.  I'm assuming many of you were like me, waiting for a anamorphic release of this movie.  Well, the wait is over, but I'm not sure it was worth it.  This is a poor transfer from Echo Bridge.  Do a search on this company and you will see that they are famous (infamous) for producing cheap DVD's and Blu-ray's.

In addition to lot of scratches on the film, there was a black border all the way around the picture.  And before you comment that I have my settings screwed up, I double checked them.  It is set up for 0% overscan (basically a pixel-to-pixel rendering or just-scan setting).  The black border disappears when I set my Blu-ray player to 5% overscan, so maybe that's why they did it, but it's not right.  Every other DVD that I have does not have this black border (it's about a 1/2"" wide on my 54"" plasma TV).

Anyway, if you are looking at this product, you probably are a fan of this movie.  And this is probably the best it is going to look for while now that Echo Bridge has the rights to it, so take the plunge and get it.  At least it is priced about right - it is a really great, underrated film.  If you are looking for reviews of the actual movie, take a look at the 130+ mostly positive reviews from the Buena Vista release (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beautiful-Girls/dp/6305327084/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beautiful Girls</a>).",1312675200,,1506,4.65530303030303

803682,5,6304167660,"Set amidst a realistic ten-year reunion, Beautiful Girls inhales a slice of apple pie on its way towards sublime Americana.  Complete underrated in every way, the movie focuses on a group of friends from the upper-northeast who have all approached crossroads or midlife crisis moments in which they must all embrace a decision and stick with it.

Perhaps the best I've ever seen, the ensemble cast nails each and every role seamlessly, creating realistically poignant situations in which every viewer can find similarity.  Played by Timothy Hutton, the lead character is a bar pianist named Willie who returns home to a strained relationship with his successful girlfriend, an awkward familiarity with his father and younger brother (David Arquette), and a next door neighbor who soon complicates Willie's life.  Natalie Portman's performance as a 13-year old with an ""old soul"" is utterly convincing; it is perhaps the best performance of her career to date.  While the nearly 15 year age gap may put off some viewers, the skill of both actors makes the situation believable and, more importantly, understandable.  Male viewers can easily empathize with the hint of doubt in Willie's mind telling him to simply wait 5 years for the perfect girl.

Among Willie's friends is Paul (Michael Rappaport) and Tommy ""Birdy"" Rowland (Matt Dillon), neither of which are typically favorites of mine.  But, once again, the casting is perfection.  Paul's infatuation with models - named his dog Elle McPherson - and refusal to grasp his colossal mediocrity is the very definition of Rappaport.  Birdy, on the other hand, is the big man on campus, star quarterback who parties hard and gets to choose between girls like Mira Sorvino (Sharon) and Lauren Holly (Darian).  Ten years later, however, they are not so keen to compete, particularly when Darian is married with children and Birdy has parlayed his high school stardom into a dead-end snowplow operation gig.  If that isn't the definition of Matt Dillons across America, then I don't know what is.

The power of this movie is in the casting and the realism.  Among other familiar Hollywood faces is Rosie O'Donnell, who predictably plays a bitter fat chick who can't take the fact that men dream of supermodels, and Uma Thurman, who plays an integral role as the film's pseudo-muse, a visitor whose beauty is overhyped but whose wisdom is enough to provide directions, if not answers.  Linked to the characters' believability is the sharp, witty dialogue written by Scott Rosenberg.  In each conversation there is a hint of each viewer's past, present, and future; they are discussions we have all had.  A very powerful screenplay makes this movie really sink in.

Ultimately, this film balances the precarious chick flick tightrope, managing to create acceptable date movie content while engaging male viewers.  Easily one of my favorites, Beautiful Girls is film about friends and relationships, a film in which we can all see ourselves.

803687,5,6304167660,"Well this is the first review that I have ever written, so my grammar and punctuation are really lacking, my college days are far behind me. I have been watching movies for over 50 years(like a few other reviewers), and I felt I had to say something about this movie. How I missed this movie over the years, I do not know, but it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I had caught the movie (Leon-The Professional) on television, and wondered who that little girl was that played such a fantastic part in what I thought was to be just a action flick. I did some research on the net and found out who she was, and ran across her name cast in Beautiful Girls, so I purchased the DVD just to see what part she played in it. Man how lucky I was to find such a goldmine! Definitely a collectible to be watched many times. I was able to relate to all of the characters in the movie one way or the other, and it brought back so many memories of my twenties life. Natalie Portman (Marty) and Timothy Hutton (Willie), knocked my socks off. I have had a couple of encounters of the same kind in my lifetime,and it is like two people have the same heart and soul, but the age and timing were always wrong. It left me wondering sometimes if I had been born at the wrong time in life. The way their scenes were portrayed was amazing. At first the scenes seemed too fast, and it was hard to understand every word. I had a hard time with the New England accent, being a southern boy, so I put on the closed caption, and played it in slow motion. Marty kinda started it off with her lines, ""I'm 13, but I have an old soul"",and ""my name is the bane of my existence"".She told Willie he was a ""you're a dude in flux"".Her intellect,personality, and perception were way beyond her age,plus she was a (beautiful girl). The scene with Marty and Willie at the ice pond was the best for me,when Marty wanted Willie to be her boyfriend, with lines like ""but if your feelings for me are true, you will wait"",""Yep,wait 5 years for me I'll be 18"",and ""we can walk through this world together"". Awesome! Then Willies denial with the Winnie the Pooh, and Christopher Robinson, comparison was great. Their gestures and eye contact were realistic, heart moving, and sad, in all their scenes. I do not know if Willie really denied Marty completely or not. At the end of the movie he drove off with his girlfriend, still staring at Marty in his rear view mirror. Plus Andera(Uma Thurman), threw him a curve in the ice fishing hut. Surely wish there had been some kind of sequel, this is a movie that you did not want to end.
All of the characters played excellent parts, and would recommend for all above (R) rating age. A tremendous movie about real people, in the real world. Kudos! to all. I am sorry I missed the rest of Natalie's growing up, she has already graduated from Harvard. Well Done Nat! Okay, enough said.....Enjoy this Movie!",1261526400,2,2913,4.336996336996337
803688,5,6304167660,"I enjoyed this movie very much, fast paced humor, lots going on between all of the characters.",1250553600,,94,4.588235294117647
803689,5,6304167660,"I both titled and tagged this review for Natalie Portman. I'm a fan of this rising star and I wanted her other fans to find this movie. Although the film has a large cast, this really is Natalie Portmans movie. She plays Marty, a wise beyond her years 14-year old with some truly great lines. The rest of the cast, particularly Timothy Hutton, are very good and the film is pleasant, but the real reason to watch this film is to see a young kid with amazing screen chemistry. Two other Portman films easily overlooked, are: Garden State and Closer. Both are excellent.",1242604800,,568,4.524271844660194
803690,4,6304167660,"I saw this movie back in the 90s and didn't think much of it. A few gray hairs and a decade later, I have nothing but good things to say about the movie. It has substance and a valuable message to men in their late 20s or early 30s. As an added bonus, Natalie Portman is such a joy to watch. The dialogue between her and Timothy Hutton is so endearing and sincere that it almost felt like they're star-crossed lovers.",1237593600,2,417,4.160493827160494
803691,4,6304167660,"Beautiful Girls is an ensemble comedy, with star power to burn. Hutton and Sorvino are both Oscar winners, while Dillon Thurman, and Portman have Oscar nominations. The title of this movie, Beautiful Girls, should clue you in to what it's about. It is a celebration of the beauty of women, but at the same time, it is also a cautionary tale about how men put Beauty on a pedestal that sometimes interferes with them making a commitment to a mature adult relationship with a real woman. In spite of the stellar cast and lofty premise, it probably went straight to DVD. I have no recollection of this movie being released theatrically. I thought that because of this it would be a big stinker, but it was actually quite good. I have a few theories about why it performed so poorly at the box office:

It had a rather diffuse focus, since it featured a group of high school buddies still hanging out, trying to get married and settle down, but finding it hard to accept adult life. Tommy, Paul, and Willie (Matt Dillon, Michael Rappaport, and Timothy Hutton, respectively) are the main three protagonists, and each of these three has two female antagonists to antagonize them. So, the story has not one but three love triangles, and thus it is hard to fully focus your attention on any one of them. Furthermore, none of the stories take the most exciting story arc, where two star-crossed lovers defy the odds, choosing to be together in spite of the world's scorn. No, they choose the path of least resistance, the status quo. They settle for comfortable. So they didn't capture lightning in a bottle.

On the other hand, there is a lot to like in this little movie that could. Great scenes, such as the sing-along 'Sweet Caroline' in the bar. High School Reunion retributions. Great locales in the snow drenched winter of Knight's Ridge. Beautiful Girls is chock full of blue ribbon dialogue. Even Paul, who wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, gets a grand soliloquy:

------------------------------------
Paul: Supermodels are beautiful girls, Will. A beautiful girl can make you dizzy, like you've been drinking Jack and Coke all morning. She can make you feel high full of the single greatest commodity known to man - promise. Promise of a better day. Promise of a greater hope. Promise of a new tomorrow. This particular aura can be found in the gait of a beautiful girl. In her smile, in her soul, the way she makes every rotten little thing about life seem like it's going to be okay. The supermodels, Willy? That's all they are. Bottled promise. Scenes from a brand new day. Hope dancing in stiletto heels.
========================

Willie is put off by Paul's infatuation with Beautiful Girls, i.e., Supermodels. His dog is named Elle McPherson. His room is a shrine, with high fashion photos of Supermodels tacked on every available surface. It gives him the Willies:

------------------------------------
Willie Conway: I am now going to check your freezer for human heads.
========================

Willie should talk, for he has issues of his own. Home from the road (he is a piano player, but he doubts his talent--and with good reason) he feels ambivalent about his fianc&eacute;, yet strangely attracted to a cute neighbor girl; but what could have been super creepy is only creepy, as the mutual attraction between the two is handled tastefully, and remains unrequited. His attraction is meant to be more about his own mid-life crisis, his inability to commit to a mature adult relationship, though it also provides some very insightful comments from Marty (Natalie Portman), who is portrayed as a most precocious young woman--an old soul wise beyond her years. From the mouths of babes:

------------------------------------
Marty: If I'm not mistaken, you've come back here to the house of loneliness and tears, to Daddy Downer and Brother Bummer, to come to some sort of decision about life, a life decision if you will.
========================

There is a scene where Willie sees Marty ice skating. They awkwardly flirt, kind of joking as a defense until they determine that the attraction is mutual. Finally she says, again kind of joking--but serious on some level--that he could wait for five years for her. He declines, but in such a sweet way, comparing themselves to Christopher Robin and Winnie the Pooh, because in the end of the story, Christopher outgrew Pooh:

------------------------------------
Willie Conway: I can't play Pooh to your Christopher Robin.
==================================

In some ways Tommy (Matt Dillon) is the character most trapped by his past, when he was a legend in High School. His ex girlfriend Darian Smalls (Lauren Holly) is married now, with a little girl of her own, but she still clings to the past, when she was the hottest chick in school and Tommy was her boyfriend. Tommy is dating Sharon Cassidy (Mira Sorvino) now, and though she is perfect, he can't see it, because his high school sweetheart still has her claws in him deep.

Sharon suffers like a fool for him, pouring her heart out to Gina (Rosie O'Donnell) in the hair salon. Sharon doesn't really have much to do here, considering that Mira Sorvino just won an Oscar for Mighty Aphrodite. Rosie O has a better part, and for a change was well cast in this role. In your face, with all the facts from a to z about men and their multifarious shortcomings. Her advice about Tommy is to just walk away. This is how she cheers her up about the break up:

------------------------------------
Gina: At first, after the breakup, you'll have these visions. Of you alone, 57, 58, walking around, wearing a nightgown, your hair in a bun, maybe you're a librarian, heating up a can of soup for one, and worrying about the cobwebs that are growing in your womb.
==================================

Uma Thurman is thrown into the mix for some reason (I mean, it was getting a little mundane, so Thurman was thrown in to give it a little bit of that Beautiful Girls magic that Paul spoke so eloquently about). Not that I'm complaining. Uma pours shots of whiskey like a pro, likes watching fights where hockey breaks out, is beautiful, and offers expert counsel. She goes 'out' with both Paul and Willie, and even encounters Tommy while walking after midnight. She, however, remains true to her love back home:

------------------------------------
Tommy: Can I ask you a question?
Andera: Go ahead.
Tommy: How long have you been going out with your boyfriend?
Andera: Eight months.
Tommy: And it's good?
Andera: It's very good.
Tommy: He makes you happy?
Andera: Yeah. I look for that in a man you know. The ones that make me miserable don't seem to last.
Tommy: Right.
Andera: You know there are four words I need to hear before I go to sleep. Four little words. ""Good night sweet girl."" That's all it takes. I'm easy, I know, but a guy who can muster up those four words is a guy I want to stay with.
==================================

Ted Demme, the director, died of a heart attack while playing in a celebrity charity basketball game. An autopsy revealed cocaine. He was only 37. He might have gone on to be a genius director, but as it is he left us with a couple of promising films after Beautiful Girls. 'Blow' and 'A Decade Under the Influence', to be bitterly ironic.

------------------------------------
Marty: It's a tragedy of Elizabethan proportions.

From my 58 year old vantage point, they are leaving their shallow and immature adolescence for the deeper and more meaningful commitments to mature, real (not mythologized) partners who love them for who they are. They are ready to embrace their lives both present and future and let go of the ever more distant and irrelevant past.

The Hutton character is certainly tempted by Thurman.  Though he admires and cares for the 13 yr old Portman character, he is always aware that her desire for him will not be returned by him. He relates to her impatience to grow up, recognizes her puppylove feelings for him, but never considers abusing her affection for him.

This is a wonderful ensemble cast.  Though more polished than its predecessor, this film reminds me of the early John Sayles film ""Return Of The Secaucus Seven"".",1163462400,3,1119,4.832460732984293

803720,3,6304167660,"Giving this movie three stars may be overrating it a bit.  It is pretty interesting but the conclusions are deadly.  We are left with the moral that a young man has to give up his dreams, give up on love, and settle for someone he rates a seven and a half, and that is what it means to grow up and be a man.

One character falls for a 13 year old girl, but ends up giving her up and returning to his lukewarm buddy, who he is definitely not in love with.  The 13 year old girl is a darling, played by Natalie Portman.  She is the star of this movie as far as I'm concerned.  Some 13 year old girls are very advanced for their age.  She is the only interesting girl in the entire movie.

Another character, an absolute moron, has a girlfriend who has been waiting years for him to propose, but instead he dreams of supermodels and undervalues the girl he has.

Another guy is having an affair with his married ex-sweetheart but has a different girl as his girlfriend, one who is in love with him.

In all three cases, the guys end up with the girls they aren't wild about, and give up on their dreams.  I suppose there is something very realistic in all that.  Doesn't that happen to a lot of us?  Still, it's a downer to see.  You get the impression that all these people would be better off dead.  The guys will never be happy settling for a life that doesn't really interest them, and the girls will eventually get bored and start cheating, because they aren't loved, and so what if they were, they'd still get bored and start cheating.

There are no happy couples in this movie, and the portrait it paints of American couples is a depressing one.",1152835200,6,1649,4.237179487179487

A lot of people out there don't ""get"" this movie, and that's ok. Of those that do, we are very passionate about it. You'd have to see it to understand.

You have to watch this during winter, or at least with a little snow on the ground.

As for the movie itself: It features Matt Dillon before he became, MATT DILLON.  Timothy Hutton who is by far one of my favorite actors.  He is underrated in Hollywood and we need to see more of him.  Most everyone in the movie is SPOT ON.

Natalie Portman was perfect for her role, but delivers some of her lines incorrectly: ""your brother's missing that thing that thing that having a mom gives you"". She could have been an even more powerful character if she just slowed down her lines a bit. Still, I loved her in this movie.

The movie is about these old buddies, and the women that surround their lives in different ways. Men, in general, are obsessed with beautiful girls.  And it's rare that you find a girl who is IT for you (ie: Moe is the only happily married of the bunch, but even he lusts after Stinky's cousin). The men have different issues with women, from commitment phobias to cheating with married women, and this movie brings these issues to light.

803793,2,6304167660,"I wanted to like this movie, but it was so saturated with Hollywood fakery - artificial dialog, arch & trite movie-style wisdom, forced plot-twists - that simply watching it seemed impossible.  Timothy Hutton is Willie - the first of a group of men we'll meet who inhabit a small town in a quiet and snowy part of America.  Willie is a small-time, New York City area musician who cleans out the tip-glass and heads home for a reunion.  He's made little impact on NYC, though we can pretty much guess why he left home.  When he gets back, he hooks up with his old buds who (this being a Hollywood movie) have aged without ever maturing.  The guys include Matt Dillon and Michael Rapaport, both exhibiting serious problems relating to women.  Surrounding the men are their smarter halves - women who are also unable to mature despite being much smarter than their men.  Between the two groups are Marty (Natalie Portman) and Gina (Rosie O'Donnell) - each of whom are meant to be as wise as they are unconnected to men. (Portman looks to be about 15 in this movie - to young to have a relationship with Will, but not too young to immediately engage him in unbelievably arch dialog;  Rosie O'Donnell's character is simply too annoying to have a relationship with anybody.)

Not much happens in this movie - which never becomes more than a loosely connected stream of scenes in which wise women try to get their dim boyfriends to grow-up and grow past their outdated ideas about women.  Though set in Smalltown, USA, the script is full of the sort of dialog you'd expect to here in some Screenwriter's Writing Workshop:  ""I can't play Pooh to your Christopher Robin"", Will says; Marty has an even more arch line - ""If I'm not mistaken, you've come back here to the house of loneliness and tears, to Daddy Downer and Brother Bummer, to come to some sort of decision about life, a life decision if you will."" - which would have sounded bad enough if her character wasn't high-school aged;  The chief indignity is heaped on Michael Rappaport's character, who must explain his open adoration of supermodels - ""A beautiful girl can make you dizzy, like you've been drinking Jack and Coke all morning. She can make you feel high full of the single greatest commodity known to man - promise. Promise of a better day"" but sadly not a better movie.  Does that kind of dialog exist anywhere outside of a Hollywood movie?  (Will, who's stuck on the receiving end of Paul's wisdom, quips about checking Paul's refrigerator for human heads, laughing at Paul while accepting the idea that men like him actually exist, and of course laughing at anybody who buys into those ideas as well, even if they wouldn't have known of them without seeing this movie.)

Ironically, ""Beautiful"" is so wedded to the idea that men don't know real beauty when they see it, that it falls back on familiar faces to play the small-town sweethearts - Mira Sorvino, Uma Thurman, Annabeth Gish and Portman.  ""Beautiful"" pokes fun at men who ignore real women because they're obsessed with beautiful women, then casts some of those beautiful women to play the ones the men are ignoring.  Nothing in ""Beautiful"" is all that insightful or funny, and bery little of it actually reaches to the level of being ""pretty"".",1123200000,6,3271,4.680628272251309

803823,5,6304167660,"Humphrey Bogart would say the Beautiful Girls in this film are the ""stuff dreams are made of.""  They stand for the idealized version of women that men seek and never find, the constant promise of a better woman just around the corner that keeps men from being able to commit to the real women in their lives.
The principle men with that ""beautiful girls"" hang-up are Willie (Hutton), Birdy (Dillon) and Paul (Rappaport).  They hold on to that dream of a better life with a better woman and thus sabotage (consciously or not) all their relationships.  Birdy clings to the memories of his high school flame, Paul papers his walls with supermodels and names his dog Elle McPherson, and Willie just wants something beautiful in his life.  Although in a relationship with a nice-looking attorney, Willie grudgingly acknowledges she would only score a 7.5 on a 1-10 scale.
While not actively looking to replace his  ""above-average-but-not-great"" girlfriend, Willie stumbles into the most charming and memorable sub-plot of the film: his relationship with his thirteen year old neighbor Marty (a totally engaging Natalie Portman).  Willie sees in her all the possibilities he dreams about: she is kind, sensitive and dazzles him with her knowledge of psychology and Shakespeare.  When she develops a teenage crush on him, Willie must consider the possibility of waiting  for this great girl to become an even greater woman.  Even though parallels are drawn to the pedophilic exploits of Roman Rolanski and Jerry Lee Lewis, there is nothing creepy or sexual about Willie's feelings for the young girl.
The stories play out in a picturesque New England town, deep into a frozen winter.  All the guys are re-uniting for their ten-year high school reunion and are forced to deal with the personal revelations accompanying that important moment.

There aren't many young ladies who could've stolen a scene or two much less a whole movie of this caliber.  She takes what could've very easily been a throw away part without a lot of substance and turns it into something that makes you realize you're seeing a truly special actress.

I find it difficult to imagine that she will ever surpass this performance.  Marty was written for a bright and alluring girl of around 13, who, in her own words, has ""an old soul"".  She is more than a match for the drifting pianist, Will, whose girlfriend is rated ""seven and a half"", in a revelatory scene where three nearly grown up highschool buddies give girls they know points for looks, personality, and other qualities.

Uma Thurman has a small but pivotal role as the sister of a local tavernmaster, but I've never seen her as particularly captivating, so all the fuss is lost on me.

803858,4,6304167660,"A terrific ensemble cast brings this film to life, which focuses on the difficulties some face in making that final, ""mental"" leap from adolescence to adulthood, and spend way too many years trying to sort it all out.  As one of the characters so tellingly puts it at one point, ""I'm not anywhere close to being the man I thought I'd be--"" and the denial, that failure to accept the fact that time stands still for no man, and the inability to choose which path to take when you hit that inevitable fork in the road, forms the basis for director Ted Demme's examination of how human nature affects the process of maturating, in ""Beautiful Girls,"" a drama featuring Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillon and a young Natalie Portman.
Willie Conway (Hutton) is back home in the Midwest for his high school reunion, but more than that, to try and make some decisions about his future.  He finds that nothing much has changed-- the town, or his old friends, most of whom seem to be exerting more time and energy attempting to cling to what was, rather than moving on with their lives.  Tommy Rowland (Dillon), for instance, the high school ""hero,"" as it were, now drives a snowplow; for all intents and purposes, his life ""peaked"" in high school, and he can't seem to get past it.  Then there's Paul (Michael Rapaport), who just doesn't seem to want to grow up; after a seven year relationship with Jan (Martha Plimpton), he refuses to make that final commitment-- after all, ""What's the rush?""
All of which does nothing to help Willie with his own dilemma; the only words of wisdom he gets from anyone, in fact, come from the precocious thirteen-year-old, Marty (Natalie Portman), who lives next door.  But in a couple of days, Tracy (Annabeth Gish), the girl Willie ""thinks"" he wants to marry, is due to arrive from Chicago, so it's time to move beyond the crossroads; for Willie, it's decision time.
Demme delivers a story that just about everyone in the audience is going to connect with on some level, because everyone's gone through (or will go through) these kinds of things at one time or another.  Who hasn't experienced, if only for a moment, that sense of either wanting to stay as they are or going back to what they were, when life was better, or at least simpler.  Or more fun.  Working from a screenplay by Scott Rosenberg, Demme examines the relationships between this eclectic group of individuals in a way that offers some insights into human nature that will no doubt elicit some reflection on the part of the viewer.  It all points up that, no matter what it may look like on the surface, underneath it all we're not so different from one another; we all share that common bond of learning life's lessons one day at a time, albeit in our own particular way, which corresponds to who we are as individuals.  And Demme succeeds in telling his story with warmth and humor; by tapping into the humanity at the heart of it all.
The story may focus on Willie, but the film is a true ensemble piece, realized as it is through the sum of it's many and varied parts.  It's a talented cast of actors bringing a unique bunch of characters to life that makes this film what it is, beginning with Hutton, who anchors it with his solid portrayal of Willie, a challenging role in that Willie has to be an average guy who is unique in his own right.  The same can be said of Dillon's Tommy, in whom traces of Dallas Winston from ""The Outsiders"" can be found; Tommy is, perhaps, just Dallas a few years later.
Mira Sorvino gives a memorable performance by creating the most sympathetic character in the film, Tommy's girlfriend, Sharon.  This is the girl who was never going to be prom queen, and who up until now has lacked the self-confidence necessary to create a positive environment for herself.  Lauren Holly, meanwhile, succeeds with her portrayal of Darian Smalls, the absolute opposite of Sharon, a young woman who is probably too positive for her own good and who lives the life of a perpetual prom queen, an individual who-- as another character succinctly puts it-- was ""Mean as a snake,"" back in the day.  Good performances that add a balanced perspective to the film.
There are two performances here that really steal the show, however.  The first being that of Michael Rapaport, who as Paul so completely and convincingly captures the very essence of an average Joe with not too much on the ball, no prospects for the future to speak of, but who is, at heart, a good guy.  There's humor and pathos in his portrayal, which personifies that particular state of being the film is seeking to depict.  Excellent work by Rapaport, and decidedly one of the strengths of the film.
The most memorable performance of all, however, is turned in by Natalie Portman, who at fifteen is playing the thirteen-year-old Marty, the girl mature and wise beyond her years (""I'm an old soul,"" as she puts it), with whom Willie forms a kind of bond as she, in her own way, helps him to sort out his feelings and find his focus.  Portman's performance here-- some three years before she would forever become Padme Amidala-- exhibits that spark and charismatic screen presence that has served her so well since, in films like ""Anywhere But Here,"" and ""Where the Heart Is.""  She has for some time been, and continues to be, one of the finest and most promising young actors in the business.
The cast also includes Noah Emmerich (Mo), Rosie O'Donnell (Gina), Max Perlich (Kev), Uma Thurman (Andrea), Anne Bobby (Sarah) and Pruitt Taylor Vince (Stanley), all of whom help to make ""Beautiful Girls"" a memorable and satisfying cinematic experience.

There are lots of memorable scenes like Rosie O'Donnells' lecture in the convenience store, and Natalie Portmans' discussions with Timothy Hutton about Shakespeare.
Just watch it and you'll know what I mean.

With an all-star cast including Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillon, Lauren Holly, rosie O'Donnell, natalie Portman, Michael Rapaport, Martha Plimpton, Uma Thurman and Mira Sorvino and a wonderfully matched soundtrack this movie is hard to top.
Will (Timothy Hutton) is trying to figure out the path his life will take, should he get married or not.

Add to the mix Uma Thurman's out of town character that is beautiful and witty and Will is getting more muddled all the time.  The local boys plow snow, drink beer and have affairs with married women, date women for nine years without proposing and raise kid with not clue how to do it.

The film does a great job of giving you insight into the characters lives, and making you genuinely interested in them.  They could have continued to follow these characters for several hours, and I don't feel like I would have ever lost interest.

The cast is great, with Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillon, Lauren Holly, Annabeth Gish, and Uma Thurman portraying classic characters in their late twenties. Natalie Portman nearly steals the show as a precotious 13-year-old, who sets her heart on Timothy Hutton.
We all know people (friends) like these characters. They ring true to our life experience. I think all guys struggle with the issues these guys are struggling with. (Maybe its true for women and the female characters as well?)
Do you look back to your past with longing for what could have been, or forge ahead into the future with whatever it brings?
Do you cling to the wild and independent spirit of your youth, or settle down into ""commited"" and maturing relationships?
Throw in a bar fight, some car crashes (all excused as raging male hormones), and you have a mix that could result in disaster (movie-wise), but director Ted Demme keeps it all together, and with just the right level of finese, comes up with a film that works, and works well!",1019865600,10,1124,4.739795918367347
803865,5,6304167660,"""Beautiful Girls"" is a movie that might have escaped your eyes, and unfortunately, that's a shame. For those of you who haven't seen it, you're missing one of the best films ever to be released in the 1990s, and with an ensemble -- yet not mega -- cast, the basic plot is rendered beautifully.
Revolving around a bunch of twentysomething friends awaiting their 10-year high school reunion, Beautiful Girls never makes us feel pity. Taking place in a small New England town during the winter, the characters never offer apologies for sticking around their bleak city streets. To them, it doesn't matter that they're plowing snow, cutting hair, or tending bar. The fact remains that the town is their home, and only Willy, Tim Hutton's character, is the ""outsider"" now. He's a piano-player who has returned from his big-city ""life"" to attend the reunion with his old pals.
But it's the title of the movie that gives it its life. When Uma Therman comes walking into the picture, everything changes. You see, each man has a ""beautiful girl"" in his life that affects him. For Matt Dillon's ""Birdie,"" it's Mira Sirvino (Sharon, girlfriend) AND the delicious (but married) former high school girlfriend Lauren Holly (Darien). For Michael Rapaport (Paul), Martha Plimpton (Jan) is his main squeeze, but he's enamored with supermodels, as evidenced by his collection of centerfolds on his wall and his dog, ""Elle MacPherson."" To him, beautiful girls not only represent life -- they give it. In Mo's case (Noah Emmerich), he's the married one, dedicated to his wife and kids. As for Kev (Max Perlich), well, he's got his own issues. But Willie presents the most entertaining dialogue with his ""girls."" He's got his steady lawyer girlfriend Tracy (Annabeth Gish) coming into town, much to the dismay of the next-door neighbor, Marty, played with unabashed gusto by the beautiful Natalie Portman. Marty's age difference presents the real challenge to Willie, but the relationship is almost adult. Their dialogue is perhaps the best thing about the movie, and the viewer will actually come to realize why Willie is so infatuated with this 13-year-old ""beautiful girl."" Portman's character has a way of connecting with the male audience that needs to be seen.
But Uma Therman's Andera is actually the girl that comes and makes sense of each man's life. A big-city advertising exec, Andera can drink whiskey with the best of 'em, turn on the charm, and offer up wisdom and a helping hand to each of the guys. Her presence awakens the realization of every man in the movie that the best thing about their beautiful girls is the simple things. Although she seems to be ""the perfect girl,"" she makes the guys come to realize that other men see their women in exactly the same light. She represents all the things that the men simply can't see in their beautiful girls. If they look more closely, it's all there.
Rosie O'Donnell makes a wonderful appearance in the movie as well, but Natalie Portman's Marty is the real reason to watch this one. She is simply sensational.
A great story with witty one-liners and some stuff that can make you shed a tear, ""Beautiful Girls"" won't easily be forgotten.",1019433600,4,3180,4.87985212569316
803866,5,6304167660,"I'm pleasantly surprised to see that this film has such good Amazon reviews. Even though it's a beautifully done, charming film, my friends insist on scoffing at me when I mention it as my favorite of ALL TIME!! My hunch is that it's a film that must be watched for it's subtleties.
In print, the plot is average. It's the tale of some average guys (and a couple of beautiful girls) who get together in a small New England town to attend their ten year high school reunion. Of course this would be completely drab if not for the loveable characters and unbelievable chemistry of the cast. In fact, the most intriguing sub-plot (the May-December crush between Willie and Marty) would've been an on screen disaster had not the chemistry between Timothy Hutton and Natalie Portman been so on.
And as for subtleties, I've watched this film an estimated 25 times and always pick up something new; a line, joke or other character dynamic that went past me before jumps out and I guess that's why I've watched it so much.
The only warning I have is this. This movie is billed as a comedy. In reality, you might be choking back more tears than laughter. Although there are some good comedic moments, as a from-the-gut drama, this movie sparkles!",1018915200,,1237,4.627272727272727
803946,4,6304167660,"This movie is one of those true gems that no one I know had seen before suggesting it to.  Do yourself and relations a favor, go buy or rent this movie soon.
The cast is the best ensemble cast I have ever seen.  Each and every character works in the movie, there are no awkward or misplaced actors here, from beginning to end.  With the likes of Tim Hutton, Matt Dillon, Uma Thurman, Natalie Portman, Mira Sorvino, Noah Emmerich et al. all sharing the spotlight equally- make this the kind of movie you will enjoy wathching over and over.
It's 10 year high school reunion time in 'the ridge', a small, working class town that seems to keep most of its graduates in close proximity, except for Willie (Timothy Hutton) who ventured off to the big city as a musician after school.  His character plays a wonderful guide through the whole movie, undoubtedly the one that most viewers would best relate to.  We are taken by many of life's obstacles in this picture, albeit fairly small ones, but they are so much easier to see and understand than the large ones.  That is where I find most of the joy in this movie, in its confronting and questioning the challenges of adult life.
Beautiful Girls is a 'smart' movie, but not so much that it becomes a burden to watch.  It makes you feel really comfortable really fast and immediately turns you into that unseen character that we all play while watching a movie.
After the acting, the hilarious script will keep you thinking about it long after viewing it.  It also has an INCREDIBLE SOUNDTRACK that you cannot miss that features some great indie and classic rock.
If your mood tells you to see a movie that is fun, talks to your soul, makes you sit back, relax and enjoy without any overt action or violence.....(well, almost none) then grab it and go!
My 4 out of 5 rating relates to the DVD, which includes NO special features or extras...too bad.

803948,5,6304167660,"The premise is simple enough: a man returns home to go to his ten year high school reunion only to be confronted with the choices he and his high school friends have made. In ""catching up"" with his once tightly-knit group of friends, he takes a look at what has brought each of them to the point in there lives they are at.
One has chosen the traditional path of a wife, kids and a house, one man still lives in the glory days of his high school football career and cannot commit to a woman who seems to truly love him. Another is struggling to be mature and only understands what love is after he decides to let his go.
Then there is the main character. He is both an observer and intimately connected to both the town and the insecurities that the rest of his friends have about their lives. He falls in love with a beautiful girl - Marty (who's name is, she thinks, ""the bane of [her] existence"") played exquisitely and painfully adolescent by a 13yr old Natalie Portman (Star Wars: Episode 1, The Professional) and he grows in the film to understand that his potential, and hers are the same.
All this is brought to the front of everyone's consciousness by a beautiful cousin (Uma Thurman: Pulp Fiction, The Truth About Cat's and Dogs) who is visiting and shakes everyone's reality by just being proud of herself and consistent in her morality. He also comes to understand that it is better to live in the present than in the past, and he makes a choice that we should all remember when laboring over life decisions.
This is a very sensitive movie if you look past the mediocre acting of both Matt Dillon and Michael Rappaport. The setting is good (I swear it was set in my town). The script is thorough, if a bit ambitious. The feeling is warm and real, if a bit fairytale with Uma's character as a Fairy God Mother. A good representation of what precedes that fabled mid-life crisis; it reminds us all that Christopher Robin finally did leave the Hundred Acer Wood he called home.

Dillon and his group of friends make you remember those times of hanging out worrying about trivial things like where you were going to drink beer that night or if you could make it another month with your girlfriend.  Relating to this show is easy and it makes you miss those confusing times that you relate to.  One of the best parts of this show to me is when the ""gang"" is in their neighborhood tavern run by one of their friends, his cousin played by Uma Thurman comes in and catches their attention.  All of the guys react and do their best to impress the girl from the big city.  Friends being there for each other in different ways makes this a very uplifting show.",1007856000,,844,4.25
803950,5,6304167660,"I came across this movie at the exact time I attended my 10 year highschool reunion.  Timing could not be more perfect.  I guess this is why this movie touched me especially because the movie is about a bunch of friends who meet again for there 10 year highschool reunion.  Alot of the questions that were asked by Timothy Hutton at the crossroads of his life I have personally asked myself.
The plot is about a bunch of highschool friends, with emphpasis on the guys, that reach that infamous crossroad of their life - the late 20 year olds who have to make a decision on whether or not to take a more permenant path in life or continue to chase childhood dreams and past glories.  They see some of their friends who have settled down and have raised a family and live in utter bliss and they ask themselves what to do next in their life.
One especially touching conversation for me was a conversation between Timothy Hutton and Uma Thurman when they went Ice fishing.  Timothy Hutton has for sometime been in a relationship with a woman that he could certainly settle down with.  However he meets Natalie Portman and the feeling of new love starts to overcome him.  Timothy Hutton and Uma Thurman discuss the issue of settling down with a stable relationship or living life continously experiencing new love.  After all, nothing feels like the feeling of new love.  A discussion that many of us have asked at one time in our life when we reached that age when we realized that we weren't getting any younger.

803951,5,6304167660,"One the best movies I've seen. Its strength lies on the scenes between Portman and Hutton. I have never seen two actors fall into such ideal roles so naturally and fully. Her portrayal of the idealistic girl is so inspiring, she invokes an underlying feeling of loneliness and sadness, perhaps unknowingly, which we can only imagine must accompany a 13 year old who has so far matured that she is making a thoughtful late 20 year old man second guess himself. When Marty and Will speak near the film's conclusion, we see she is in tears as she packs away her sled. The tears are a bit too good however, and it seemed something didn't quite add up; not with Scooter, not even with William. Is such a bright, strong, ""old soul"", crying because she's having a hard time finding the right guy for her, or because she's realized there's a good chance no one ever will be?

Michael Rappaport was hilarious with his obsession with supermodels and St. Bernard named ""Elle."" ... ""they're all sisters, Will.... leave it alone.""
This is not only a ""girl"" movie, or a ""date"" movie, its an everyone movie because its true to life full of guys that can't commit, girls with low self esteem trying to hold onto their men, and guys that just want ""something beautiful"" and will go to the ends of the earth to get it.

For those, she's not in the movie that much and when she is she's really funny.  However, the real reason to see this movie is for the Precocious Portman.  There hasn't been a tragedy of this magnitude since Romeo and Juliet.  Lines like, 'I just want something beautiful,' are so sad, and then Moe responds, 'We all do,' but unfortunately poor Moe just doesn't get it, as is the case for many men.  Most of the reviews give good appreciation to Willie and Marty's relationship- so I won't dwell on what could have been perfection.  One addition I think most people miss is when Willie's girl friend arrives: Based on his brother bummer and daddy downer's reactions, Willie thinks he's pretty lucky.  Suddenly a solid 7.5 looks a lot better than a 0.0 that his bro and dad are stuck with.  Listen to the song as the brother and dad have excited smiles saying 'she was superb' and waving bye as Willie drives away looking at her like 'this was meant to be.'  The lyrics go 'It's so easy, to be stupid,' which perfectly describes what's going on.  Don't settle for someone who doesn't excite you!  The DVD has a great picture pretty good sound and the best reply value, so it's worth owning.  I just wish they included some extras.  On the back of the box is a picture of Natalie and Timothy sitting together talking.  That scene is not in the movie, but it must be somewhere out there.

And granted, there are a few occasions when you want to reach through the screen and slap the male characters in the head to tell them to get on with their lives.  Personally, though, it's still my favorite film.  One that I watch repeatedly and find myself quoting on a daily basis.
Full of snappy one liners (""Who are you Rex Harrison?""), memorable exchanges (Noah Emmerich's explosion, ""You beat up my friend, you beat up me...""), and great performances by Natalie Portman, Timothy Hutton, Michael Rapaport and the entire cast make this an extremely pleasurable film experience.
The beauty of Beautiful Girls is that it can be taken it at so many levels.  It contains everything from over the top pop culture references (""You gonna' watch 'Rich Man, Poor Man'...) and crude sophomoric humor (David Arquette as Bobby Conway), to literary references and cautious, yet effective handling of taboo societal discussions.  It's a guy movie, a date flick, a comedy, an ironic social commentary, a coming of age tale, and a remember-the-wonderyears film in one quirky and charming package.",976060800,,1131,4.962962962962963
804027,3,6304167660,"This is a good film...not a great one, and certainly not as great as some reviews here would have you believe, mostly due to some of the worst screenwriting I have been forced to hear and witness in a long time.  A previous reviewer was very correct in singling out the ""Sweet Caroline"" singing scene, for one; it stands out as one of the most embarrassing-to-watch scenes of any movie I've seen in many years.  Others that are just jaw-dropping in their brainlessness include the ""Bottled Promise"" speech by Michael Rapaport's character and a large proportion of Natalie Portman's lines (""colored girls go doot-da-doot"", ""honey-limbed lovely""...agh!  shoot me now!).
As for Natalie herself, I'm one of her biggest fans, but I don't think this is one of her better showings; that too is severely overrated in the reviews here.  In her defense, I think it was because she was given nothing to work with; she really has the worst lines generally of any character in the movie.  To her credit, though, she still manages to use her innate charm to salvage the character and obviously, make it a favorite of many.  Still, if you want to see her at her most brilliant, check out ""Leon - The Professional"".
All this said, it's not a bad film overall...still worth 3 stars.  What makes it worthwhile, more than anything else (to me at least), is its star power and chemistry.  Timothy Hutton, Mira Sorvino, and Matt Dillon are especially wonderful, and I wish they would be given more Hollywood visibility in general (together would be even better, judging by their chemistry here).  The story itself is ok, but frankly the chick-flick-for-guys philosophy misses more often than it hits here.
And for those that care about DVD technicals, the quality of the voice tracks is much poorer than most DVD's I've seen, with a lot of them being (frustratingly) not loud enough.",973987200,4,1862,4.8119122257053295
804028,3,6304167660,"Ahh...beautiful girls. Beautiful girls. As one character (played by the ever-annoying Michael Rapaport) theorizes, a beautiful girl is  ""nothing but bottled promise-the promise of a new tomorrow!""  Oddly enough Ted Demme's BEAUTIFUL GIRLS revolves little around the subject  of beautiful women, but focuses on the promise of a new tomorrow-and does  so to a middling effect.
BEAUTIFUL GIRLS is largely a slice-of-life tale  detailing the means by which Willie (an able Timothy Hutton) transverses a  sort of early-mid-life crossroads. He's come to a point of ambiguity in his  life: his career as a bar-pianist hasn't quite panned out like he'd hoped  and his successful lawyer/girlfriend of eleven months wants a commitment  for which he's not certain he's ready. Just in the nick of time, comes  Willie's ten-year high school reunion-a time to visit old friends and sort  out the mess of his life.
The film becomes an ensemble piece soon after  Willie's arrival home. We meet his old High School buddies (none of whom  have had any motivation to leave their small town) and find they have  problems of their own. Tommy (Matt Dillon)-much to the dismay of his  present, long-suffering girlfriend (Mira Sorvino)-is hopelessly infatuated  with Darian (Lauren Holly), his now-married, ex-High School sweetheart.  Paul (Michael Rapaport) has just been dumped by his girlfriend of seven  years (Martha Plimpton) for a meat-cutter because he refuses to commit.  BEAUTIFUL GIRLS weaves in and out of these several stories sometimes with  verve and sometimes without.
The most interesting of these stories is, of  course, Willie's own. Upon arrival to the house of his youth (now marred by  the death of his mother a few years prior), he meets Marty (a sublime role  essayed by young Natalie Portman), the 13 year-old daughter of some  neighbors who have moved in since his own departure. Through a series of  conversations chock-full of literary references (to Shakespeare, Milne,  Nabakov, etc.) Marty develops a crush on Willie who remains sixteen years  her senior and Willie begins to seriously contemplate waiting for this  young sweetheart. As ""dirty-ol' man"" as this might sound on  paper, the audience, due to Portman's and Hutton's acting, is actually  given a glimpse into what might drive such a fascination. The chemistry  between Willie and Marty is undeniable and in fact, possibly stronger than  that between Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney in OUT OF SIGHT.
Another  aspect that added to the film's quality was the manner of resolutions:  though many loose ends are tied up in the final moments, like real life,  many things (to the movie's credit) remain unresolved. All told, BEAUTIFUL  GIRLS hits in some aspects and misses in others, but shouldn't be missed if  for no other reason than to catch Natalie Portman and Timothy Hutton in  fine form.",966556800,8,2860,5.150326797385621

Watching this movie, I kept thinking to myself how, even in the face of situations that were  highly implausible and with dialogue that is impossibly polished, the  characters were all believable.  Each character struck me as a real person,  with real motivations and fears and desires.
Ms. Portman, with her  precoscious acting, truly steals every scene she is in, but Mr. Hutton is  more than her equal to make their scenes believable, yet not creepy or  disturbing.  My only complaint, in regards to the actors, was Mr.  Rappaport, who was somewhat over the edge.  Nevertheless, I would be lying  if I did not know at least one person like his character.

The only thing that i  didn't like about this movie was how Willie used the winnie the pooh story.  I was really hoping that he would decide to wait.  This is the one of the  few movies that i actually dreaded to see end.  Its just a movie that you  wish would never end.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.",956620800,2,720,4.2611940298507465
804032,2,6304167660,"Have you ever watched a movie and felt embarrassed for an actor- understanding how they must have felt having to speak a line or do something in the movie?  Well, that's how I felt for everyone involved with  that stupid ""Sweet Caroline"" number. Sure, they all looked like  they were having fun, but you know a lot of those guys were cringing on the  inside, thinking ""I can't believe I'm singing a Neil Diamond song in  public.""
Beautiful Girls was an incredibly difficult movie for me to  like because of moments like this.  I was left wondering why so many good  actors were attracted to this tedious story of how guys are mental midgets  who can't see the soulfully beautiful women in their midsts.
The actors  do the best they can, but they are basically left with nothing to do.  If  this is what it's like to live in a blue collar tiny town, then I pray my  right hand falls off before I ever have to go.
Yet there is one redeeming  thing in this movie that would make me move to town in a heartbeat, and  that's Marty.  This is the first movie I ever saw Natalie Portman in and I  am awestruck everytime I see her performance. Marty is the kind of girl you  have a crush on if she's your babysitter, and the kind of girl that people  can't believe comes from a small setting like that. Like Willie, I was  jealous of the 12 yr old kid just because ""he gets to be her age,  right now."" Marty's  understated beauty, her innocent yet worldly  understanding of adult situations, and her childlike shrugs yet assured  body language stole the show from the more ""mature"" actors on  set.  The way she looked at Willie when she told him to wait for her made  me want to scream ""Take her up on her offer, ya bonehead!""  The  friendship that Willie and Marty establish has to be one of the most  bittersweet coulda-beens in the movies today.
On the whole I do not  recommend this movie, but it is worth seeing based on her performance  alone.  Watch it, but speed through any scene that doesn't have Marty in  it.  Alright, you might want to check out the scene where Rosy O'Donnell  lectures the boys about how the girls in magazines are a fiction and the  scene where they almost beat up Darian's husband is pretty cool, but that's  pretty much it.",952473600,4,2248,4.366504854368932
804033,2,6304167660,"Don't you hate it when a drama is labeled as a comedy? Anyway, there were only three things this movie had going for it; the script, the theme (What is considered to be a beautiful woman? ), and Micheal Rappaport's very  juvenile character as the only comic relief in this bore *sorry Rosie*.  ""Beautiful Girls"" had the potential to be a nice male soap opera,  but it couldn't hold my attention. I considered the part where Matt  Dillion's character landed in the hospital the ending and just turned the  VCR off. I'm sure that I didn't miss anything beyond that part.",950832000,3,568,4.584158415841584

The characters were so well developed that when it  was over I had a hard time convincing myself that what I just experienced  was a movie.  Their interactions made them not only completely believable,  but made me feel like I knew each one of them as well as the other  characters did.  The chemistry between Timothy Hutton and Natalie Portman  was especially amzing to watch.  If only the Academy gave an award for an  ensemble cast!  But as impressive as the ensemble was, Natalie Portman's  performance alone would have made this a five star movie.  It was a true  standout, a sight awesome to behold!",924307200,5,776,4.686567164179104

The return of Timothy Hutton to his home town(small town) is an exact replica of what i go through every time i return home to my small town. The friends never change  and neither does the town. The only one who changes is Timothy  Hutton(Willie). It was an excellent movie for a standpoint of friendship  and loyalty. Also presents both the typical male and female perspectives on  the opposite sex. A very funny movie with quick-witted dialogue.,918259200,,498,4.823529411764706

Its not about being attracted to a teenager, its about not wanting to get old and wishing to be a teenager again. This is a movie about 4 friends whos lives are not what they expected or wanted. Four men who have beautiful women (physically and emotionally) in their lives but are too caught up in their own self pittty to realize until its almost too late. A wonderful film about coming to terms with who you are and where you are even if its not what you expected. This movie does not objectify women as some say, it is a brilliant look at how petty men are and how they can get hung up on the unimportant. Pay attention to Rosie ODonnels character, shes the only voice of reason in this film full of men with a peter pan complex.",1515196800,,878,4.263473053892215

However with that said, I view certain aspects of this movie very differently  then I once did. I once thought the quirky relationship between Timothy Huttons charachter and a young Natalie Portman(her 2nd big role)was adorable but now its rather uncomfortable. Especially given light to social awareness that maybe wasn't as identified in the 90s. Are we supposed to recognize a longing of youth from Huttons charachter? Or are we dealing with the attraction between an adult man and a 13 year old girl. Even The other characters question him on this. Now if that was the antogonist of the story that would be one thing but instead its just made to look like this sweet innocent crush and In my initial viewing bought it hook line and sinker. Now tho......honestly it just creeps me out. I wonder if the actors  or Director have revisited these characters and now reflect on them differently? If anyone else has a similar response I would love to know.",1515110400,,1088,4.781914893617022
