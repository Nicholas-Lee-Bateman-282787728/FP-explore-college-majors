Elvin McBrant (Sam Ronick), the semi-zombie nerd-hero of the film, is the ultimate super dweeb.  Sporting the taped up glasses, disheveled bow tie, and an amazing ""utility belt"" (which I am currently lusting over) where he carries his flashlight, ketchup bottle and other such vital supplies.  Sam Ronick manages to be both nerdy, and somehow slightly tough-guy with a voice that echos a rougher pre-Matrix Keanu Reeves growling, and saying ""Suck my balls"" quite a bit.

Samantha Falk plays Judy, who's sweet looks hide her wildcat intentions.  Interaction between her and Elvin being absurd and goofy. Watch for the 24 ways to say ""sex"" scene.  I don't know how Falk managed to say all the lines with a straight face.

The film itself is a parody explosion with clips and action laid over the classic Night of the Living Dead.  They've changed the story, added some hilarious sound bites (with lots of farting) and this one has tits and cussing.  I expected some continuity issues, but besides in scene changes I found very little.  The sound is occasionally queued differently between scenes, but not in a way that harms the film.  Just slight wavering in volume between scenes.

Watch it for what it is, an indie parody.  Love it for it's well put together scenes, hilarious quips, and to make a drinking game out of ""Suck my Balls"".  I've watched more then my share of parodies and spin-offs of Night of the Living Dead, and this film as earned a place in my heart and permanent love on the zombie awesome shelf of doom.",1311984000,,1655,4.76140350877193
