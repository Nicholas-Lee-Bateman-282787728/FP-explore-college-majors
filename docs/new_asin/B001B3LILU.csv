3481074,5,B001B3LILU,"A Grandpa for Christmas is a heartwarming tale of reconciliation. Ernest Borgnine is his usual somewhat crusty but loveable self, and Juliette Goglia, who plays his granddaughter, gets to show off her beautiful singing voice. If you like a story about family members coming together for the first time and helping each other, this movie is for you. I've seen it on TV twice. Now, I'm buying it!",1216857600,31,394,4.8088235294117645

When she does then the Daughter and Granddaughter stay's with her Dad forever because they were going to move back after the Daughter get's hurt in an accident but she changes her mind because the Grandpa changed his life around and they started fresh.

3481335,4,B001B3LILU,"Not even one time that whenever I think of Christmas does Ernest Borgnine's mug come up. But his 2007 movie, A Grandpa for Christmas, is a lovely little movie that warms your heart and compels you to hug your gramps. It's about old, solitary curmudgeon Bert O'Riley (Ernest Borgnine) whose daily schedule consists of waking up, mulling over moving into a retirement home, shrugging into his ratty old sweater, and passing time with his creaky old pals, most of whom are retired showpeople.

There's heartbreak in that Bert and his estranged daughter Marie (Tracy Nelson) both inhabit the same city and yet haven't spoken to each other in twelve years. It's to do with Bert's having abandoned his wife and 2-year-old daughter all those years ago. But Old Bert's routine is shattered when he must take in his granddaughter he never knew he had while Marie lies in a coma after a horrific accident.

10-year-old Rebecca (Juliette Goglia) is an unhappy little girl. Her mom's job has it so that they're always relocating. She's working on her fifth school change in three years. She all her life has heard nothing but Bert-bashing from her mom and grandma, and you see why she's predisposed to hate on him. But, slowly, slowly, she comes around about her grandpa. The biggest icebreaker is their shared love of music. Come to find, Becca has a wonderful singing voice and she wants to try out for her new school's Christmas pageant. And, come to find, Old Bert has a background in entertainment, being an ex-actor who used to play heavies on the silver screen but whose passion was always ever the song and dance. As Bert and his grandddaughter grow closer, an opportunity surfaces for a reconciliation with his own daughter.

It's a Hallmark holiday movie, and as such it holds no surprises. It's a modest, feel-good story that showcases Goglia's singing and Borgnine's affable mugging. Young Juliette Goglia is really good. I like that, as Becca spends more time with Bert, she tries to get to the truth of why he really left, instead of just settling for all the badmouthing that's gone on against him. And Goglia shines when she's singing and dancing; she's a star performer. Add in television veterans Katherine Helmond and a very spry Jamie Farr as Bert's showbiz cohorts who end up mentoring Becca as she preps for the pageant, and it's a movie that can't help but give you the warm fuzzies.",1419379200,,2394,4.777777777777778

3481359,5,B001B3LILU,"What a wonderful movie with a legendary actor as the grandfather, some other actors that played in so many other shows, yet a new star in the young lady.  I want this to be one of the movies I go to each and every year as it tells the story of so many families that are separated by misconceptions and the grandparents are the ones that lose out.  The worse part is the young ones also lose because they don't get to learn from their ""older"" generations and that is sad.  But this story shows how two generations come together and a middle generation learns to ""rekindle"" a friendship.

This is a very good story told in a wonderful way, with talented actors.",1416787200,,659,4.333333333333333

Tracy Nelson, Ernest Borgnine, and a cast of well-known and well-loved actors and actresses make up the cast. Of course, the prime subject is the granddaughter who has to learn about a grandfather she has been taught to dislike and distrust. Along the way, she learns to sing, dance, forgive, and love.

3481400,5,B001B3LILU,"This is a light-hearted movie, just a joy to watch. Juliette Goglia has one of the sweetest voices I've ever heard and Ernest Borgnine is, well...Ernest Borgnine at his most lovable. An 11-year-old girl and her 80-year-old grandfather have never met but circumstances bring them together. At first they make the best of it but then the best of each of them shines through. Actually, the movie is predictable - you know the ending almost from the beginning - but that doesn't matter because getting there is more than half the fun.",1388534400,,530,4.771739130434782

Things warm up between Grandpa and granddaughter... and finally between daughter and Daddy. In a heartwarming turn of events, decades of lies and wrongs are set to right and a family is re-united for Christmas. Highly recommended.

This hits home.  A must have movie!",1388102400,,350,4.338461538461538

3481438,5,B001B3LILU,"...with the Hallmark kind of touch. With the Christmas theme and the dynamic of ""will mother and daughter believe in grandpa?"" it seemed reminiscent of Miracle on 34th street - and the surprise of Becca's amazing singing and the show music and rehearsal scenes had some of the fun of High School Musical, It's a sweet story with fabulous actors,  and really cute and funny scenes. I just thought Borgnine  was adorable, the way he laughs and his eyes twinkle and he tried so hard. (Again, a little bit of a ""Santa"" figure.)The chemistry among everyone worked very well - the actors are so professional they made it believable. I liked every character (Except Heather's mom who took offense too easily after she was the one who invaded Bert's privacy the minute she met him with an agressive question about why he had never met his granddaughter.)  Hedmond was great, gracious and believable, and I loved seeing Jamie Farr again - he has a great screen presence. There is nothing in this movie that is inappropriate for family viewing, though the hospital scenes are a little graphic, yet not more than is customary these days... still, they could have keyed down on the mom's face. It will be one of my favorites ever. The happy ending was heartwarming and tearful - I will watch this again and again.  Reconciliation, forgiveness, and going forward living from THIS moment, not the past, with a clean slate - a beautiful Christmas theme.",1362787200,3,1438,4.763052208835341

3481478,5,B001B3LILU,"The story addresses one of the major issues that face divorced and single parents, what does a father do when the mother does not want you around your child? Do you fight for your child, which can take years, and cost tens of thousands of dollars, or do you simply walk away as she wishes? In the case of Bert, he fought to see his daughter, only to lose at every turn, until he finally gave up, never to see his daughter again, until she is injured, as presented in the movie. Unfortunately, his ex-wife tells the daughter, as well as anyone else, that he is uncaring and unsupportive of his daughter, physically or financially.

In taking in the granddaughter, he never knew about, he is faced with the resentment toward him due to these stories told by the grandmother. Bert is faced with the dilemma of whether to tell his granddaughter, and later his daughter, the truth, which if they believe him, may ruin their memory of the late grandmother, or stay quiet. The dilemma is resolved when one of Bert's friends tells the mother the truth.",1293840000,2,1044,4.553191489361702

I heard his work ethic amazed everyone, especially at his age. 80 at the time, he has made 14 more movies since then (2007). The man is just amazing!  Juliette is wonderfully believable as a kid needing some fairness in life and finding a grandpa to anchor her life on is heartwarming.  The supporting cast also made huge contributions to making this story work.  Katherine Helmond as Roxie, Richard Libertini as Karl, and Jamie Farr as Adam were each a joy in their characters.

And the supporting cast is excellent...Jamie Farr, Richard Libertini, and Katherine Helmond are a hoot together.  Mix 'em all together in an interesting story about an angry child forced by circumstances into a new school with new friends, and a new home with a grandpa she's never known before, and you have a cute, funny and heartwarming story full of likeable characters...especially the leads played by Borgnine and Goglia (yes, that really is her singing).

Mr. Borgnine is superb as usual and little Ms. Juliette is certainly the character. This is definitely a movie for the whole family.

Rather than finding ourselves caught up with the plot, we felt overwhelmed by the clumsy writing that attempted to pad the content -- dragging it out with endless focus on pointless dialogue and scenes that in no way served to move the action along. We could just about imagine the sweat stains on the script's pages. The need to stretch the thin plot out was that desperately obvious.

Three stars are for the valiant efforts by the veteran actors who turned in the most charming performances possible with the little they had to work with. This would have been a wonderful thirty minute show.",1230854400,,801,4.555555555555555
