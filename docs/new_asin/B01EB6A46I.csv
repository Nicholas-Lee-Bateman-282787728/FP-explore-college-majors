7734302,1,B01EB6A46I,"Not Amazon's fault, but the cover and rear DVD packaging clearly states CINEMASCOPE ... we hilecthe item description offers NO aspect ratio information whatsoever. With that in my mind, I readily ordered this film favorite of mine that I have been dying to own for many years. Much to my dismay, when I sat down to enjoy reading the reverse side package info ... I was ENRAGED to find that FOX for whatever the Hell reason chose to release this DVD (not even on blu-ray) in god-awful PAN & SCAN 4:3 ... are we living in the middle ages of VHS??? I now have absolutely NO Respect for those CHEAPSKATE MORONS at FOX for pulling such a pathetic move! If they weren't going to offer this movie in its original aspect ratio (CinemaScope), then I'd rather they had not released it at all. FOX SUCKS!!! I guess I'll have to be satisfied with what I have, because we all know that there will never be another properly restored release of this film ... as long as FOX owns the rights.",1461888000,24,975,4.4222222222222225
7734303,1,B01EB6A46I,"Whatever else its merits or demerits, this film was shot in widescreen (2.35:1) while this DVD is pan-and-scan fullscreen. It is unacceptable to release anything so shoddily butchered in the present widescreen TV age.",1461283200,22,217,5.411764705882353
8758271,4,B01EB6A46I,"THE FOUR STARS IS FOR THE FILM. THE DVD ONLY RATES 1 OR 2. This is a 1950's movie about test pilots and testing men and planes for future pace flights. It covers basically what ""The Right Stuff"" but this is a work of fiction, and it is a few notches below ""The Right Stuff"" but is still a pretty good movie which also does focus on the personal lives of the pilots and the stress on them and their families with generally good performances. I have found that a number of men like myself who love the older science fiction films also like these since what they were training for made 1950's science fiction about space exploration science fact in the 60's. THIS IS A POOR DVD. THIS IS AN EARLY FOX CINEMASCOPE FILM AND WAS FILMED IN 2:55 TO, WIDER THAN LATER 2:35 TO 1 SCOPE FILMS AND THE CHEAP CORPORATE LACKEYS AT FOX RELEASED A PAN AND SCAN DVD. THE PICTURE QUALITY IS ALSO POOR. This is inexcusable when all the other studios, MGM, Warners, Columbia etc. are releasing their wide screen films in wide screen and in good picture quality. If they can do Fox can. THIS SHOW A COMPLETE LACK OF RESPECT FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS. I go mine and immediately traded it in. I Can't recommend this film as it is.",1515888000,,1199,4.3097345132743365
8758272,1,B01EB6A46I,"Being a collector of sci-fi space movies, I was ""duped"" by the title. IMDB didn't have any description of the so-called plot, so I didn't realize that this was grand documentary by the US Air force. Very little action, dull dialog, a waste of some good actors. If you like aviation history, you'll love this yawner. Otherwise, go watch ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" again.",1514764800,,374,4.681818181818182

8758274,4,B01EB6A46I,"On the Threshold of Space. Is an early Hollywood attempt at explaining the origins of manned space exploration. And it's good for its time frame, the mid 50's. The age of the Test Pilot!
But there are documentaries that go into early space flight. That explains that period much more in-depth. So as a Piece Hollywood docudrama it's good. But as Always with its Fox Cinema Archives series. The Murdoch Brothers does these old films an injustice by refusing to release them in their Original formats! So if they are going to release them on the Cheap. Then the price should be lowered to 10.95 plus tax! Asking the public to pay 20.00 plus tax for a cheaply made DVD is too Much!",1496448000,,678,4.520325203252033

8758277,1,B01EB6A46I,"Well . . . like other's have wrote in about, FOX, who invented Cinemascope, or what I call LETTERBOX, have yet again ruined another release.
This time, "" On The Threshold Of Space "" and another "" The Sweet Ride "" have been put out in the lousy 1.33:1 / 4.3 Pan & Scanned, VHS style antiquated aspect ratio, and or format. The people at FOX doing this should be fired. PERIOD !
Also, I notice, that FOX, and even other DVD companies, are now cropping down 2.35:1 ( same as Cinemascope ) filmed movies to 1.85:1, which I call Widescreen. Movies that are originally at 1.85:1, are being cropped to 1.77:1, which is 16X9, for these new TV's, ( a phony aspect ratio, really ) is so to make the average TV watcher ( who does not know the difference anyway ) not complain about the black bars on the top & bottom of the picture, that SHOULD BE THERE PEOPLE ! ! !
So, as it goes, many of the original films ares still being modified. Will it ever end ?
On one good note, FOX did release  "" Blue Denim ""  in the original Cinemascope format. I guess that one slipped through some idiots hands by mistake.

8758279,1,B01EB6A46I,"Headline says everything. Really Fox? Pan & Scan of a Cinemscope movie? Thats Sodom and Gomorrah for every movie-goer.
And selling it for approx. $ 18 ??
Good movie or not is right now not important. But are you expecting really that someone will buying this title this way?
I'm NOT! Sorry Fox.",1468972800,7,294,4.566037735849057
8758280,3,B01EB6A46I,"THE STORY: During the infancy of the space race the U.S. government spent considerable time (and mountains of taxpayer money) devising ways to get ships & their pilots into (and beyond) our atmosphere. This is the tale of a few of those brave men who dared to defy gravity (and common sense!) in order to pursue that lofty dream.

THOUGHTS: Though listed in some reference sources as a sci-fi film, ON THE THRESHOLD OF SPACE is only marginally (and in the broadest terms) of that nature. Guy Madison is our brave boy in blue, while his nervous wife, played by the lovely Virginia ('Jan in The Pan' from The Brain That Wouldn't Die) Leigh, wrings her hands & worries over him. Dean Jagger (did this guy EVER have any hair?!?) is the egghead who concocts new ways to try and get our good Guy killed. Warren (Forbidden Planet) Stevens & a boyish Martin (Adam-12) Milner ramp up the star power a notch or two, as Madison's fellow test pilot buddies.

THE DVD: This is a no frills MOD (manufactured on demand) release, so don't expect much in the way of extras or goodies; the film's theatrical trailer is the only gimme. Video is amazingly strong, with good sharpness & outstanding color. Minimal artifacting & pixelation make this a joy to watch, and the sound is clean, level & clear. But now the bad news... As the handful of others who took time to review this movie have bemoaned, the folks at FOX Cinemas Archives really fumbled the ball with the unfathomable decision to bring this gorgeous CinemaScope motion picture onto home video in a sacrilegious pan & scan format. The nature of this film (and cinematography of it) made terrific use of the super-wide CinemaScope lenses, so it just leaves you shaking your head in bewilderment & disgust that FOX would choose to release a butchered version of the film on home video in this day and age. I don't know if we'll ever see this film get a hi-def release but if so let's hope that smarter heads prevail and it's shown in its proper 2:35to1 aspect ratio, so we can enjoy the ENTIRE picture instead of just a percentage of it. In the meantime, this edition is all we have to bookmark a spot on our video shelves until that day comes - if ever. 4 STARS for the movie itself, minus 1 STAR for the 4:3 butchered video formatting.",1466985600,12,2278,4.526699029126213
